DICKMAN, COMMANDING ARMY OF OCCUPATION. The training of the 3rd Division was started at Camp Greene, N. C, under a serious climatic handicap and con- ducted principally along the lines of the traditional doctrine of American infantry. The offensive and skill with the rifle were inculcated rather then the defensive with grenades and trench warfare. The work gave early indications of good results and was continued along the same lines after arrival in the training area of Chateau -Villain, Department of Haute Marne, France. After the German advance from the Chemin des Dames to the Marne, the call for troops became urgent. The training, about half finished, was suddenly called off, and the Division, preceded by the 7th Machine Gun Battalion, was rushed to the Marne in the region extending from Chateau -Thierry to Conde-en-Brie, where it soon became apparent that they had arrived not a moment too soon. In a strange land, among a foreign people, under a higher command whose views and methods were different from ours, the cheerful willingness, bravery and initiative of officers and men rose superior to the hardships and annoyances they did not fully understand, and disregarding all personal considerations they gave the best there was in them for the common cause of liberty. 191747 The details 01 the- military qjbejfatio^s in which the Division took part on the Marne, in t' advance to ttr *urcq and the Vesle, in the reduction of the . l Mihiel salient, m the Argonne- Meuse offensive,: the advance on Sedan, and the march to the Rhine, are recorded in the pages which follow. The casualties of the Division are exceeded by those of only two divisions, which arrived in France fully six months sooner. The record of the 3rd, or \"Marne Division\", and its spirit and bearing under all conditions, have brought it imperishable fame. When the general history of American participation in the great war comes to be written, certain erroneous impressions created in non-military circles by exaggerated newspaper accounts and catch phrases will be eliminated along with other froth of the turmoil of war by the crucial test of the official record, and the Third Division with its Component Units will receive full credit for heroic conduct on the Marne and in subsequent campaigns. In the mean-time the Third Division is steadfast and as strong as ever and will so remain to the end. (ft €L< O (Headquarters, Army of Occupation, Coblenz, Germany, March 13th, 1919.)

In compiling this History of the THIRD DIVISION all efforts have been concentrated on the earnest endeavor to present, in an historical form, a readable history, and at the same time, a truthful history, based on official records. The History that one will remember in the days to come, is not composed of such facts as - the number of rounds of small arms ammunition fired, or the daily percentage of shrapnel wounds, - it is the personal experiences, the vivid mental pictures, the sense of duty well done, the long night marches in the rain and mud, the pride of battles won, the memory of machine guns taken, the facing of death time and again, and a hundred and one other things. This story, mere figures and reports could never tell. The history of a division is a history of the units that compose it. The best narrative is written by the unit itself. So it was, with these facts in mind, that four selected officers of each unit were designated to write the histories for each unit respectively. The copy they submitted is given practically verbatim. These officers did their work well, and the man who can read the pages that they have written and not have his pulse increased, and laugh, and set his teeth, as the case may be, must be made of mud, and not of flesh and blood. The war was not won by any one Division, nor by all the Divisions in the American Expeditionary Forces, but by 2 XVII the Allies and the United States of America. And the men to whom the greatest share of the glory is due, is that ever glorious Army of Men who gave ALL that they had, in order that right and justice and civilization should not perish from the face of the earth. Let us forever give them credit. If errors are found, or omissions noted, be charitable. If some acts are not praised, or pthers overrated, remember that the organizations themselves were the authors. Above all, remember that you belong to the DIVISION, to the DIVISION as a WHOLE, to the Division that has been indelibly written in the pages of history as, \"THE MARNE DIVISION\", and that the glory of being a member of the THIRD is greater than the glory of belonging to a separate unit. F. V. H. DIV. HISTORIAN. XVIII WHAT A DIVISION IS. There are undoubtedly many readers unfamiliar with military organization who will scan the following pages. To help them understand just what a Division is, even a very brief description may be of value. A full Infantry Division is, roughly speaking, composed of 27,000 men and is commanded by a Major-General. In- cluded in this organization are two Infantry Brigades of two Infantry Regiments and one Machine Gun Battalion each, and an Artillery Brigade of three regiments, two lights (75's) and one heavy (6\" Howitzer). Then there are, for their respective special duties, a regiment of Engineers, a battalion of Signal troops, and a Divisional Maschine Gun Battalion (motorized). Each brigade has its headquarters, consisting of the Brigadier-General commanding, and the personnel of his staff and assistants. The Division Head- quarters Staff numbers approximately 50 officers and 126 men. To complete the division, add the Headquarters Troop, Train Headquarters, Military Police Company, Supply, Sanitary, Engineer and Ammunition Trains, the Mobile Ordnance Repair Shops, Mobile Veterinary Section, Division Salvage Squad, Railhead Unit, Clothing and Bathing Unit, Mobile Field Laboratory, Sales Commissary, Machine Shop Truck Units, a Bakery Company and a Laundry Company. Each and every unit, whether combatant, or otherwise, has its own particular function and duties and its efficient operation and performance of duty is essential to the success of the Division as a whole. XIX CHAPTER I. THE DIVISION. In as much as the history of the Third Division is narrative in form and not in the nature of a formal official report, it is only necessary to give from the divisional viewpoint a brief resume of the life of the division from the time of its birth. The individual narrative histories of the respective units check and crosscheck with each other, and after being all read, blend, in the reader's mind, into the record of the division, as a whole. The Third Division was born at Camp Greene, Charlotte, .N. C, on November 23, 1917, in compliance with instructions contained in two letters from the Adjutant General of the Army, dated the 19th and 23 rd of November, respectively. The 4th and 7th Infantry Regiments and the 8th Machine Gun Battalion constituted the 5th Infantry Brigade, and the 30th and 38th Infantry Regiments, with the 9th Machine Gun Battalion, constituted the 6th Infantry Brigade. The enlisted personnel to complete the units named* was furnished by transfer from other units at Camp Greene! The commissioned personnel, with the exception of Division and Brigade Headquarters, was supplied by transfer of officers then at Camp Greene. The number of permanent regular officers assigned to a company was limited to one to a company and the number of provisional or temporary officers, to two per company. The necessary remaining vacancies were filled from the Reserve Corps. The 7th Machine Gun Battalion was organized from troops stationed at Camp Greene, and the officers limited as follows: three regular, two provisional or temporary, and two Reserve Officers to each company. The organization of all units was made in conformity with Tables of Organization, Series A, August 8th, 1917. The Brigade Commander and commissioned personnel for Headquarters of the 3rd Field Artillery Brigade were assigned by the Adjutant General and directed to report at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, to Brigade Headquarters. The Brigade was made up of the 10th Field Artillery at Douglas, Arizona; the 76th Field Artillery 1 at Camp Shelby, Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and the 18th Field Artillery at Fort Bliss, Texas. The 6th Engineer Regiment, at Washington Barracks, D. C, was designated for early duty abroad with the 3rd Division, and was directed to be ready to sail in November. It embarked for Europe on December 3rd, 1917. The Train Headquarters and Military Police, Supply Train, and Ammunition Train were organized at Chickamauga Park; Georgia. The Quartermaster General was directed to designate the Head- quarters personnel and six truck companies to constitute the 3rd Supply Train, and to complete the organization and equipment of the unit for early duty abroad. The Train was organized at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The Surgeon General was directed to organize at Fort-Clark, Texas, the Headquarters Ambulance Section and Headquarters Field Hospital Section of the Sanitary Train, 3rd Division. Ambulance Companies and Field Hospitals Nos. 7, 26 and 27, at Fort Clark, Texas, and Ambulance Company and Field Hospital No. 5, at Leon Springs, Texas, were designated to constitute the remainder of the Sanitary Train. So much for the early organization of the Division. December, January, and February passed, and the Division, under the guiding hand of Major- General J. T. Dickman was ra- pidly put into shape and trained and prepared for the momentuous part that it was destined to play in the great war drama that was being enacted on the blood-stained fields of Europe. The 6th Engineers were already overseas and in the critical days of March were fighting shoulder to shoulder with the British and bringing honor and recognition to the Division with which they were destined to fight through the war. March, April and May quickly passed and the Division found itself in a Training Area in France. Division Headquarters and Advance Party left Hoboken on the transport \"Leviathian\", on March 3rd, 1918, arrived in Liverpool, England, March 13th and in France April 4th. May, in the Chateauvillain Area, was a really wonderful month. The fields were dotted with myriads of wild flowers, and the summer breezes were warm and gentle. Vague rumors of impending battles and offensives spurred us all, and the 29th of May found the Division in the height of its training, and the stage was set. On the 30 th we stepped into history. Lt. Col. Raymond Sheldon, then Chief of Staff of the 2 Division, described the momentuous events of the next four weeks as follows: \"On May 30th, 1918, orders issued from G. H. Q., A. E. F., putting the Third Division, less Artillery and Engineers, at the disposal of the General commanding the Group of Armies of the North. In his order assuming command over the division, General d'Esperay indicated that it would be employed to assure the de- fense of points in the passage of the MARNE. Influenced by the course of the German advance toward CHATEAU-THIERRY, a later order from General d'Esperay's Headquarters put the Division at the disposal of the VI. Army, which turned it over to the 38th Army Corps, (French) operating in the CHATEAU-THIERRY region. The movement of the division into this sector was commenced bv the Motorized Machine Gun Battalion when it left its station on the afternoon of May 30th for CONDE-en-BRIE. The movement of the two Infantry Brigades, which was by train, began in the night of May 30 and was completed June 3rd when the last unit arrived in the new area, having marched from its detraining point at PROVINS, many kilometers to the south. The divisional trains made the journey overland, arriving at their destination in good time. The orders for the 7th Machine Gun Battalion required all possible speed in its change of station, and upon arrival at desti- nation, after being on the road over twenty-four hours, it was rushed to CHATEAU-THIERRY, the then most threatened point in the line. After brief reconnaissance, the two companies of the battalion took up positions in the town late in the afternoon of May 31st. Those positions were maintained, although subjected to severe bombardment during the entire night, and at dawn, in conjunction with the French Colonials, a fierce attack and attempt to cross the MARNE was repulsed. The splendid work of the 7th Machine Gun Battalion, when fighting for the possession of the town was the fiercest, caused General Marchand, under whom it was operating, to make special mention of it to the Army Corps. Individuals, officers and men, so distinguished themselves that it pleased the Division Commander to recommend them for decorations for their gallant conduct. Meanwhile the 5th and 6th Brigades were arriving, and bat- talion by battalion moving into position in the sector which ex- tended easterly along the MARNE from CHATEAU-THIERRY to DORMANS. This country was held by the 10th and 20th French Divisions at the time, and its organization gave rise to frequent changes of positions of our troops. At one time (the second week 3 in June) the two brigades were distributed along the MARNE from La FERTE-sous-JOUARRE to COURTHIEZY. The duties performed varied likewise. These troops along the MARNE above CHATEAU-THIERRY faced the hostile positions, whereas the duty of those distributed below that point to La FERTE-sous-JOUARRE was to guard the bridges and the railroad. Members of the 3rd Division aiding refugees. Notice the human pathos of the picture - the white-haired old man and his wife, the pretty little girl peeping from the car ahead, and the American doughboy at the right, filled with righteous anger at the sight of the unfortunate inhabitants. On the right the Third Battalion of the 7th Infantry, supported by guns of the 8th Machine Gun Battalion, was in the line at COURTHIEZY for six days. On the 8th of June the Second Bat- talion 7th Infantry, began taking over a front-line position at REUILLY, which it held until moved to the sector of the 164th Division, (French) for the purpose of guarding bridges in the region of NANTEUIL. In this mission it followed the other battalions of the regiment, which had reported previously to General Gaucher, commanding the 164th Infantry Division.. After five days of this duty, the regiment was ordered to relieve a regiment of Marines of the 2nd Division, U.S., in the line near BELLEAU WOOD. While holding this position, the regiment participated in severe fighting of which the successes gained and the casualties bear ample testimony. To the credit of the regiment be it also said that on quitting the command of General Putois, 20th Division, and General Gaucher, 164th Division, each of these commanders took it upon himself to mention in orders of the division, and let- ters to the commanding officer, the splendid service of the regiment. During this time the other units of the 3rd Division were not inactive. In the second week of June the Engineer Regiment and Train joined the Division. This regiment had hitherto been oper- ating independently of the 3rd Division, having preceded the latter to France. Early in the occupation of the sector the General Commanding the Army Corps ordered the formation of a corps reserve, formed of our own and French troops. This group was, however, in existence only for a short time. The Corps reorga- ' nized the sector and with General Dickman in command, the di- vision occupied the center of the corps sector. At this time, troops equalling in numbers scarcely a brigade, constituted the division in spite of the fact that the front held along the river measured some eight kilometers. Two battalions of the 4th and 38th Infantry Regiments occupied the front line, supported by the 9th Machine Gun Battalion and the French artillery. The 30th Infantry and the 7th Machine Gun Battalion were at this time still attached to the 10th Colonial Division on the left, while the 7th Infantry and 8th Machine Gun Battalion were operating under the French 20th Division on ourright. The organization of the 3rd Division sector, both as to ground and the disposition of troops proceeded. Eventually, the 4th Infantry was replaced by the 30th. While in the sector of the 10th Colonial Division the 30th Infantry took part in the battle for the possession of HILL 204, and after its arrival there the first battalion of the 4th carried on this work. The employment of the 7th Infantry during this time has been indicated above. Meanwhile, many days passed and no identifications of the enemy opposing the corps front from CHATEAU-THIERRY to DORMANS was in our possession. A memorandum from the Corps on June 13th left no doubt as to the necessity of getting 5 identifications. The mission of taking prisoners rested on the 30th and 38th Infantry Regiments. Nightly patrols were sent out, and after overcoming by determined efforts the difficulties of GENERAL PERSHING speaking to Third Division winners of the coveted D. S. C. passage presented by the river, they were at last successful and able to give to the Army the important information on the enemy order of battle in our front. Four patrols which crossed the river brought back eight prisoners besides wiping out one of the enemy patrols encountered. 6 The missions gave the opportunity for individual initiative and bravery, and those who participated in the raids were not slow to size it. Splendid work was done which the Division and the Army recognized. The General commanding the Army was pleased to congratulate the Division Commander' on the success of these operations and the participants have been rewarded by mention in Divisional orders and in many cases recommended for distinguished service decorations.\" The last week in June and the first two weeks of July were spent in preparing by every manner of means within our power to meet the onslaught that we all knew in our hearts was impending. There occurred the usual rotation of units in the front line and all possible speed was maintained in the organization of ground. The weather was perfect and all were beginning to believe that war was not so bad after all, when, as one of the unit historians described it, \"on the 15th of July, Paradise became Hell\". To correctly understand the exact position in which the 3rd Division found itself on that memorable day, and to have a true conception of the tactical side of one of the most decisive battles of the war, and the one that marked the turning point of the war, it is necessary to give to the reader the official report, in part: \"On July 14th, 1918, the Division held a sector extending along the southbank of the MARNE River from the eastern edge of CHATEAU-THIERRY to a point on the River one kilometer due west of VARENNES, a distance of 9 kilometers on an east and west line and of almost 12 kilometers measuring along the river bank. The Division sector was divided into four sub-sectors, each held by one regiment, with one battalion in the front line one battalion in support, and the third battalion in reserve. Machine gun battalions were assigned to brigade sectors and the guns employed for the defense of the sectors were echeloned in depth to provide a deep checker-board formation. The Division Reserve consisted of only three companies of the 4th Infantry, located in rear of the left subsector. From west to east the subsectors were held by the 4th, 7th, 30th and 38th Infantry Regiments, respectively. The 10th Field Artillery had taken position in the eastern half of the division sector and had been assigned to the support of the 6th Brigade; the 76th Field Artillery in the western half of the sector was assigned to the support of the 5th Brigade. The 18th Field Artillery was on this date just coming into position, the last battery being caught on the road by the bombardment of the night of July 14th/ 15th. The units of this 7 regiment and the French Artillery units already in the sector were given the mission of general support in the zone of the Division. Four general lines of defense had been, organized, but the defensive works constructed were in a rather elemental stage, due to several circumstances, the most important of which were the more or less open character of the recent fighting, the lack of engineer personnel and the constant shifting of units in the early stages of organization and the continual changes in sector limits, occasioned by the Army or Corps organization and re- organization. The first of these lines, consisting of isolated pits and machine gun emplacements along the river bank, was intended to serve principally as a line of observation. Close in rear of this line a more strongly garrisoned defensive position providing a more or less continuous line of rifle fire (in compliance with orders 38th A. C.) had been established along the railroad track. The so-called main line of resistance extended along the slopes of the first hills south of the MARNE; although this line was intended to be continuous eventually; the main reliance was placed upon certain groups or strong points fairly well organized. The 4th (or support) line followed the slopes about the crest of the 2nd ridge to the south of the MARNE, extending into the SURMELIN Valley on the east. In rear of the Division, a fairly strong position on the reverse slope of the hills had been organized by the VI. Army, and was garrisoned by the 28th Division, U. S. and the 73rd Division, French. As stated above, the organization of the position held was far from being completed. Dugouts for use as P. C's. and dressing stations and a number of splinter-proofs had been installed. Fire trenches existed along the front edges of the woods and at certain isolated points, but were not of sufficient depth to afford reaso- nable protection from shell-fire. The small, isolated pits in the forward areas were, however, much nearer completion and were all fairly well camouflaged. A bretelle position garrisoned by three companies of the 7th Infantry and a Machine Gun company, was in process of construction from Le ROCQ Chateau to BOCHAGE Farm, and another bretelle garrisoned by one battalion of the 38th Infantry had been commenced with a view to extending it along the eastern edge of BOIS de la JUTE and the northern edge of the woods south of ST. EUGENE. Four battalions of the Division had been retained by the Corps or the Army for the purpose of garrisoning Army positions, but on the 13th of July all but one of these battalions were returned, 8 to the Div'sion and on the night of the 14th of July, this one remaining battalion had been put at the disposal of the division commander to accomplish the relief of one batta'ion of the 30th Infantry. Each subsect r was held in general by one battalion in the forward area, and one battal on in support. Three companies of the 4th Infantry constituted the garrison of the Le ROCQ bretelle position. Two companies of the 38th Infantry were in the BOIS de la JUTE on a short bretelle and the remainder of the units were in position at the disposal of the Regimental Commanders. Division orders outlining the plan of defense prescribed that all units hold the ground entrusted to them and that lost ground be immediately regained by local counter-attack. Pursuant to Corps orders, it was directed that this stubborn defense begin at the most advanc d line and be continued by each unit, however small, even though the enemy succeeded in gaining ground to both sides, and in rear of that unit. The use of gas and smoke had been foreseen and subsector commanders had been directed to prepare their plans of defense accordingly but this particular point was not yet sufficiently covered so that proper precaution could be taken without loss in personnel and great confusion resulting there from. The enemy artillery was known to have been heavily rein- forced during the first part of July, and every prominent point in the 3rd Division sector had been accurately registered upon. Just previous to the 14th of July,, there was considerable decrease in the enemy's artillery activity, with a corresponding increase in his aerial activity. On a number of occasions, reports of observers indicated that \"metallic cylinders\" were being handled from wheeled transportation on the north bank of the river an i that work, accompanied by pounding upon iron, was progressing. Although absolutely no movement was noted during the day, every night observer reported movement of individuals, groups, wagons and other forms of transportation. Prisoners taken by our patrols which had crossed the river on several occasions, reported having heard remarks of an offensive, but were unable or unwilling to definitely locate the objective of this offensive. Information was, however, finally gained by the Army from a captured officer who located DORMANS as one of the probable points of crossing. This information when pieced together served as a warning and enabled the artillery to prepare and open their counter-offensive prepara- tion before the enemy's bombardment had commenced. On July 14th a gas-shell attack on the enemy's positions north of the MARNE had been ordered by the 38th Army Corps, to begin 9 at 8 P. M. Shortly after the shelling commenced, telephone orders were received directing that general counter preparation fire be delivered, to commence at 11.30 P. M., as a German attack was expected before daylight. At this time all of the 3rd Artillery Bri- gade, with the exception of one battery of the 18th Field Artillery (155's) was in position, and, thanks to the data secured by the French units which had previously occupied these positions and to the careful dispositions made by the Commanding General, 3rd Artillery Brigade, all of the artillery supporting the division was able to open at once a very effective concentration of fire upon all of the avenues of approach on the north bank of the MARNE and upon suspected points of enemy concentration. At midnight, the enemy commenced a violent bombardment with gas and high- explosive shell. Bombardment was especially violent on the rear line of defense and in the wooded areas, \"and lasted for about four hours. The enemy bombardment extended from CHATEAU-THIERRY to DORMANS and well into the rear areas. This preliminary bombardment gave way shortly to a barrage which continued upon the front lines until about 3.30 A. M., and upon the rear lines until after 10 A.M. About 3.30 A.M., July 15th, the enemy commenced his crossing by means of boats and pontoon bridges. One regi- ment of his troops was caught by our artillery fire at the exits of BOIS de BARBILLON and suffered very severe casualties, according to statements of prisoners. Another regiment, after three attempts had been made, gave up the plan of crossing opposite the 38th Infantry, due to our heavy artillery and machine gun fire and moved to the east where crossing was finally effected, resulting in a mass movement upon the positions of the 38th In- fantery. Shortly after the first troops of the enemy crossed the river, the troops on the right of this division gave way, with the result that at 5 A.M., July 15th, the 38th Infantry was devoid of any support on its right flank and was forced to present a line of resistance facing the east to resist enemy pressure from that direction. In the meantime, the enemy had crossed the Plain of MEZY, and his heavy masses of troops were hurled against the advanced elements of the 30th Infantry and the 7th Infantry. Such of these elements as were not entirely destroyed were finally forced to retire to the woods on the slopes north of CREZANCY and in the vicinity of FOSSOY. This in turn exposed the left flank of the 38th Infantry which still held its ground. At this time the 7th Infantry started a movement to regain the lost terrain and 10 was successful after twelve hours of effort, during which a number of patrols and small bodies of troops penetrated into the woods east of FOSSOY, and on to the Plain of MEZY. The lines of the 30th Infantry, in the woods north of CREZANCY maintained their position and delivered a deadly machine gun and rifle fire upon the advancing German troops, with the result that no Germans V/hat a direct hit did on the \"Marne\", July 28, 1918. Notice the hungry horse - the lone survivor, calmly grazing, with a gaping wound in his flank. reached the FOSSOY-CREZANCY road at any time and that no German reached our positions in the woods and remained alive and uncaptured. The advanced elements of the 38th Infantry were withdrawn toward evening on the 15th and that regiment was directed to prepare for resistance along the western crest of the SURMELIN Valley in the event of a heavy German attack delivered from the east. From patrols that had penetrated into the woods east of the SURMELIN Valley and the statements of prisoners cross- n examined, some estimate of the German forces which had crossed the river was made possible. The Division Commander wished to secure at least two fresh battalions from the Army Corps Reserve, 28th Division, and some French units, with which to make a counter-attack in the direction of REUILLY and clean out the JAULGONNE salient. After repeated requests, permission was finally obtained to deplete the strength on the left of the Division (4th Infantry) and with the troops so obtained, coupled with a few divisional reserve units which still remained available, to make this attack. It was then too late however, as the German troops had already commenced their re-crossing of the river. The Division immediately moved forward to keep contact with the retreating enemy and crossed the river; the 4th Infantry, by means of the CHATEAU-THIERRY bridge on July 21st, and late the same evening, one battalion of the 7th Infantry near FOSSOY by boat. (Table No. 1.) From this date until the Division was relieved in the line, the fighting assumed a more or less open character and consisted almost entirely of machine gun fire and flanking movements directed by our small units upon the positions assumed by the rear guard of the enemy. The Division was finally relieved by the 32nd Division, U. S., the last unit being relieved early in the morning of July 31. The casualties of the division were heavy, amounting in all to approximately 7500 men and 205 officers. No attempt was made to compute the number of German killed. It is known, however, that a great many German killed and wounded were carried off by the retreating troops and in the few trenches along the banks of the river, German bodies were found piled several deep. A great many bodies that fell in the MARNE were carried downstream. Approximately 700 prisoners were taken by the di- vision and a great number of machine guns with their equipment and ammunition, several one pounder cannon, and three77fieldpieces. Countless feats of courage, fidelity, and duty well done could be told of the individual officers and men. For instance, certain officers of the 10th F. A. commandeered and served abandoned French batteries on two occasions, and the artillery liaison agents, after all wire communications had been completely wiped out, showed remarkable fidelity and an utter disregard of personal danger. An examination of a map showing the line held by the enemy before and after the \"Battle of the MARNE\", makes clear the fact that the 3rd Division not only effectually stopped the two German divisions opposed to it and there by rendered possible the stopping of the German advance, but also that the advance made toward 12 O IB 4> _j <— ra n- o S r-JS •« g«i >. « S 2 2 r- • \" S5 r/l ■— (/I •x o rt !2 O u C K ^ « s a gjc <u OS T3 ~ S. 5 £ c s\" ■o u ft,, > -> *> s 5 w « a.

S - a a © ■a S3 the VESLE River was, in no small measure, due to the manner in which certain elements of the division advanced up the CHAR- MEL Valley in plain view of the enemy's observation posts and under his concentrated artillery fire to positions on the high ground north of Le CHARMEL. This valley in fact constituted a sort of chute which was strongly organized by the retiring enemy and Camouflaged pontoon bridge, near Mezy, constructed of captured German boats, July 24, 1918. which was taken, only after having suffered heavy casualties, by the excellent leadership displayed by the commanders of small units and the wonderful fighting qualities of the individual men. Such was the official report of the \"Battle of the Marne\", although written with the precise exactness of a formal military report, its words bring out all the pathos of the scenes, and the courage, and self-sacrifice that are contributed by those who fight a modern battle. During the night 29th/30th July the last troops of the 3rd Division 13 were withdrawn from the line. This unit was the 5th Brigade, and its P. C. closed at Le CHARMEL at 9.00 A. M., on July 30th. With the Division P. C. at CHIERRY, the division was assembled in the region south of CHATEAU-THIERRY by the 1st of August. The 6th Brigade which was in billets in the vicinity of COURBOIN, moved in camions during the night of August 2nd/3rd and the next day, to the support of the 3rd Army Corps (French). Their operations for the next few days are graphically described in the narrative histories of the units taking part. The Brigade was re- lieved on the night of August 10th/ 11th, and moved to COURBOIN, from which place it joined the division, now in the GONDRE- COURT area. The division had entrained and moved the GON- DRECOURT area on the 15th, 16th and 17th of August. Training and reorganization were immediately began, and repla- cements were received. Then, as in the last days of May, orders came to move. Trains carrying everything from soldiers to duck boards had been rolling through for days and we all sensed the fact that something big and quiet and sudden, was about to happen. It did. We left for the VAUCOULEURS area, by night marching on September 4th and 5th, and arrived by two columns at a posi- tion in readiness, just south of an east and west line through ETANGE DE BEAUCE on the 8th of September. On the 10th of September the 3rd Division was in reserve, supporting the 4th Corps attack, with the 42nd Division in its front, the 1st Division on the left and the 42nd and 89th Divisions on the right. Then the some- thing happened, happened quickly and most completely. The ST. MIHIEL Salient disappeared, as if the censor had taken a gigantic brush and painted it out of existence with one stroke. The American Army, this new unknown quantity, had performed an operation in forty-eight that many had been wishing to see done for four years. It was an All-American party and everything functioned like clockwork. The 4th and 5th Army Corps, U. S. effected a junction at YIGNEULLES and the 2nd Colonial Corps (French) cleaned up the captured ground. The 3rd Division, less artillery, Motor Section Ammunition Train, 7th M. G. Bn. and 6th Engineer Train was withdrawn and the 5th Brigade assembled near the BERNECOURT- FLIRY Road, while the 6th Brigade collected near MANCHES. The divisional P. C. was at UHERMITAGE, the 5th Brigade's at BERNECOURT, and the 6th Brigade's at BEAUMONT. From this location the division proceeded by night marching and bus move- ments to the FORET DE HESSE where on September 26th it consti- tuted a portion of the Corps Reserve, 3rd Corps. 14 The stage was being' set' for the last great act of the war in which we were to plav our Dart. The Division P. C. moved up from BLERCOURT to E5NES.\" On the 27! h the 6th Engineers were detached and placed at the disposal of the 3rd Corps. Aerial activity considerably increased, and enemy 105's paid us occasional visits. The Division passed into the 5th Corps on the 29th of September and on the 30th moved into the front line taking over the sector of the 79th Division. The 5th Brigade was in the front line and the 6th Brigade in reserve. The 57th Artillery Brigade and the 304th Engineers were attached to the Third Division at this time. The Division P. C. closed at ESNES at 10 hrs. on September 30th and opened at CUISY roadfork, on A40NTFAUCON-MALANCOURT Road, same date and hour. The 80th Division was occupying the sector on our right and the 32nd Division the sector on our left. The 3rd of October passed without unusual activity. Preparations were made and orders issued for the 5th Corps attack on October 4th. The 5th Brigade was designated as the assaulting brigade, with the 6th Brigade in reserve. The objectives were, BOIS des OGONS, BOIS de CUNEL, and the heights to the east of ROMAGNE. The 6th Engineers returned to duty with us and the division P. C. opened at the famous \"Crown Prince's dugout\", in MONTFAUCON, at 6.00 P. M., October 3rd. \"At 5.25 A. M., October 4th, the attack was launched, covered by a rolling barrage, and supported by the 13th, 14th, 16th and 17th Battalions of French tanks, from the NANTILLOIS-CIERGES road. The 5th Brigade had launched its attack from the jumping off line NANTILLOIS-CIERGES road, without artillery preparation, being preceded only by the prescribed rolling barrage. The 4th Infantry was on the right and the 7th Infantry on the left. Each regiment had one battalion in the front line, one battalion in support, and one battalion in reserve. Company A, 8th M. G. Bn. was attached to the 7th Infantry and the machine gun company of the 4th Infantry was also with that regiment. The other machine gun companies of the Brigade were placed under command of the Commanding Officer, 8th M. G. Bn. and accompanied the reserve battalions. At 6.45 the Commanding General 5th Brigade went forward from his post of command at La CHAPELLE de MALADES and at 8 hrs. a new Brigade P. C. was opened at 08.9 — 80.1. * * NOTE: These and similar numbers are map coordinates. When points are given thus, even though confusing to the reader, it must be rerembered that it was impossible to describe the locations in any other manner. 3* 15 At 7.15 th-: CO. 1st Bit. 4th Ini'anfry reported his battalion in Woods 268, between 81.4 and 82.0. and his P. C. in south edge of woods. Oiitf pounder fire iv0m Hill 253 and machine gun fire hindered the advance ci \"both legiments of the 5th Brigade. At 1 1 hrs. the 7th Infantry line ran approximately from Hill 241 to the west, and bending south to Hill 299. The companies of the 7th Infantry were somewhat scattered, most of the line being held by a part of the 1st battalion, with a part of the second battalion to the east of Hill 241. At 1 1 hrs. two platoons of Company C, 8th M. G. Bn. were on Hill 241 — one platoon was south of Hill 239, Company A was south-west of Hill 241 and with some shelter. This was about point 07.9 — 81.5. An enemy machine gun nest with six or seven guns at point 6.5 — 82.5 held up the advance of the infantry. A section of machine guns went forward to attack the nest but were only able to cause it to slightly change its position. At 11.10. ten Boches planes flew over Brigade P. C. and machine-gunned the 30th Infantry. At 1 1.30 Boches planes bombed the 30th Infantry. By excellent rifle fire two of the planes were brought to the earth. At 12.10 the Commanding General 5th Brigade asked for art- illery fire on the south edge of Woods 250. At 15 hrs. the Command- ing General 3rd Division notified the Commanding General 5th Brigade that Corps Artillery would commence firing at once on ROMAGNE and would continue firing until ordered stopped by the Commanding General 5th Brigade. At 16 hrs the C. O. 4th Infantry reported that his 1st Bn. had been relieved by his 2nd Bn. Companies E and G were leading and the forward elements were entering Woods 250, at about 09.8 — 82.4. These two companies had to work well to east on account of enemy fire from Hill 253. F Company was moving out of point of woods 268 at 09.9 — 81.9; H Company was along south east edge of woods at about 09.5—81.5 and 09.7—81.6. The 80th Division on the right was held up and the 2nd Bn. 4th Infantry was unable to locate any elements of the 7th Infantry on its left. The 1st Bn. 4th Infantry was reorganizing and the 3rd Bn. (in reserve) was near the patch of woods at point 09.8 — 81.05. At 16 hrs. the C. O. 7th Infantry reported that he was starting attack in conjunction with the troops of the 126th Infantry on his left, using a smoke screen. The C. O. 7th Infantry was using all of his troops, including his reserve battalion. At 16.30 the C. O. 8th M. G. Bn. reparted the locations of 16 Companies A and C, 8th M. G. Bn. were unchanged; Co. C being on Hill 241 and Company A, one-half kilometer southwest of HiH 241; that Company B, 8th M. G. Bn. was at 09.3—82.5, and Co. D at the southeast edge of B01S de BEUGE; and that the 7th Infantry M. G. Company was at the southern edge of BOIS de BEUGE. At 18.25 the Commanding General 5th Brigade directed the C. O. IXh Infantry to halt his troops, organize their positions and get liaison with troops on right and left. At 21.30 the Division Commander met the Commanding General 5th Brigade and all four regimental commanders at P. C. of the 5th Brigade, at which meeting it was determined to attack again at 6.30 on the following morning without ro ling barrage. The 6th Brigade had remained in its present positions and with the same mission as the previous day. The 3rd F. A. Brigade was in the following positions: The 76th F. A. in the western portion of the sector south of CIERGES; the 10th F. A. in the eastern portion due east of the 76th F. A., and the 18th F. A. southwest of and near MONTFAUCON, with all regimental headquarters and Brigade Headquarters at MONT- FAUCON. On ihe Morning of October 5 at 6.30 the attack was cont- inued, and by infiltration we advanced our lines slowly against stubborn resistance from enemy machine guns in the BOiS de VALOUP and northern edge of Woods 250, to the western edge of the BOIS des OGONS. During the night of the 5th of October efforts at infiltration were made by elements of the 5th Brigade and small groups of men made some minor advances. The 5th Brigade launched no formal attack on the 30th but endeavored throughout the morning to locate hostile positions and its own positions, to reorganize units, connect up the elements of the line, and to push forward to better positions where local conditions made it advisable. At 9.30 the C. O. 8th M. G. Bn. reported as follows: \"Three guns, A Company, in position on Hill 253, supporting left flank of 7th Infantry front line, at 08.5—82.8; the guns A Company on west nose of Hill 241 at 08.1 — 81.9: two guns A Company in hedge in ravine at 07.8- 81.4; one gun A Company at 08 — 81.5; two guns A Company near corner of woods at 07.5 — 81.3; Two guns C Company on Hill 241 at 08.9—81.9; two guns C Company 08,9—81.5 ; two guns C Company^ at 09 — 81.2.

One platoon 4th Infantry M. G. Co. has gone forward to help organize position on south edge of Wood 250; two platoons 4th Infantry M. G. Co. are in position in sunken road leading from NANTILL01S to BOIS de BEUGE. Two platoons of D Company, 8th M. G. Bn. held in readiness in eastern edge of BOIS de BEUGE; 7th Infantry M. G. Co. in reserve southern edge of BOIS de BEUGE.\" At 11.05 the liaison officer with the C. O. 4th Infantry re- ported that there were still machine guns in Woods 250, but that the C. O 4th Infantry was unable to ask for artillery fire on them until he had definitely located the troops which had infiltered into these woods. At 12.55 the liaison officer with the 4th Infantry reported that at 12.15 a fifteen minute barrage would be laid down on Woods 250, after which the leading battalion 4th Infantry would advance. At 12.15 the following information was received by 'phone from the 7th Infantry. \"Captain Strickland of F Company reports that woods 268, 10.08 — 1.9 is now occupied by the enemy with large number of machine guns. Captain Riggins with 80 men of G Company is at 08.18 — 1.8. Three officers and 170 men of F Company are dug in south of CIERGES-NANTILLOIS Road between 08.5-80.8 and 09.3 — 80.8 Lieutenant Waite has 95 men of G Company at about 08.3 — 81.8. H Company has no officers, but a sergeant has four scattered platoons at about 08. — 8!. 7. Lieutenant Sikes, with B Company (number of men unknown) is on Hill 241. Captain Hallowell of L Company has been slowly advancing with the 3rd Bn. up ravine and reports considerable enemy movement on our front and flanks, and that enemy are apparently coming from edge of Woods 250, about 09.8—82.5.\" At 15 10 the Regimental Intelligence Officer of the 7th Infantry reported the ridge of Hill 253 as occupied by the enemy from Woods 250 to a point 200 yards east of the ROMANGE-C1ERGES Road. The enemy had dug trenches and manned the ridge with two pieces of artillery and machine guns. At 15.30 report received from aviator that the enemy was forming up in trench line between 07.0 — 84.0 and 09.0 — 84.3. The batteries opened up on this position and the 7th and 4th Infantries were warned to be on the lookout for a possible counterattack from that direction. 18 At 16 hrs. the C. O. 8th M. G. Bn. made the following report' of the situation at 15 hrs. 'Companies K, L, and M of the 7th Infantry are on the south slope of HILL 253, left flank about 08.5. Three machine guns of Co. A, 8th M. G. Bn. are protecting their left flank and front. Companies G and H of the 7th Infantry are on HILL 241, with two machine guns of Company A, 8th M. G. Bn., on their left flank. The remaining guns of A Company are in position formerly reported, covering raving to the west of Hill 241, and raving south of 241. C Company 8th M. G.

Company 7th Infantry in reserve in the southern edge of BOIS de BEUGE. At 16.05 the Division Commander notified the Commanding General 5th Brigade that our artillery fire on the German trench line 07.0—84.0 to 09.0—84.3 would continue until 17hrs., at which hour the 7th Infantry would attack. At 16.25 both the 7th and 4th Infantry were notified of the attack by 'phone, and the Brigade Adjutant went to the 7th Infantry to explain the details of the attack. The 6th Brigade had remained practically as before. During the night of October 4th and the day of October 5th, 3rd F. A. Brigade instituted fire on enemy strong points and machine gun nests in the vicinity of ROMAGNE and the BOIS de CUNEL. The enemy artillery was very active during this period and his shelling of CIERGES-NANTILLOI5 and the BOIS de BEUGE was very heavy. During the night 5th/6th October, the 4th and 7th Infantry (5th Brigade) advanced their line, toward Hill 253 and organized out- 10 post positions on its slope. A company of the 7th Infantry was pushed forward to the Trench de la MAMELLE, but finding it too strongly held, was forced to retire slightly. The fighting all day on the 6th and 7th of October was very bitter and stubborn. The 4th Infantry particularly met with deter- mined resistance from the BOIS de CUNEL. During the afternoon of October 6th reports were received that the enemy was fleeing out of BRIEULLES and burning it. Many fires were notices also in towns to the northwest. At 8.10 hrs. on 6th October the C. O. 7th Infantry reported that Companies K, L and M had at 17.25 hrs. the day before, advanced without resistance to HILL 253, and that Company I had advanced through the ravine RAU de MOUSSIN, but upon arrival 100 yards north of that ravine, had met heavy machine gun fire from its immediate front and to the west. As the mission of Company I was to occupy the Trench de la MAMELLE and to push out patrols to ROMAGNE, and as that mission was rendered impossible by this fire, the Company, in accordance with orders, withdrew to Hill 241. Companies K, L and M are entrenched on Hill 253. At 4 hrs. the 1st Bn. (less Co. A) and the 2nd Bn. withdrew from Hill 241, as per order, and entrenched in positions just south of CIERGES-NANTILLOIS Road; at 5.30, Co. A was sent forward to locate and mop up machine guns and snipers supposed to be located in ravine l'ANDON. This company searched the ravine as far north as 226 and encountered no enemy resistance. I and K Companies followed L and M Companies into the woods. From 13 hrs. to 16 hrs. the 155s and from 15 hrs. to 16 hrs. the 75s fired on the BOIS de CUNEL and the Trench de la MAMELLE; and at 16 hrs. the 4th Infantry in connection with the 80th Division on its right attempted to enter the BOIS de CUNEL, but without success. The 57th Artillery Brigade was relieved from duty with the 3rd Division on the night 6th/7th October. It moved out of the sector and took up a new position in support of the 32nd Division. The 203rd R. A. C. and Group REIGNER were attached to the 3rd F. A. Brigade, Group Reigner consisting of one battery each of 155s, 155SL Chaumond and 105 mm guns. At 8.15, 7th October, 1918, pursuant to orders of the Divi- sion Commander, the C. O. 4th Infantry was directed to discon- tinue the attacks upon the BOIS de CUNEL and to organize the northern edge of Woods 250. During the day about 20 men of 20 Company C 4th Infantry, who had managed to gain the edge of the BOIS de CUNEL, during the three heroic attempts of the 4th Infantry to capture it in the face of murderous machine gun fire the afternoon previous, were withdrawn a few at a time, there being no way of supporting them in the perilous position in which they found themselves. The 6th Brigade relieved the 5th Brigade on the night of 7th/8th October and the 5th Brigade passed into Division Reserve. The 30th Infantry took over the right -sector and the 38th Infantry the left sector. Relief was completed according to report of the 6th Brigade, at 2.05 hrs., 8th October. The 5th Brigade P. C. closed at 21 hrs. at 08.9—80.1 and opened at MONTFAUCON. The 6th Brigade P. C. moved from MONTFAUCON to the southern slope of Hill 254. The relief of the 8th M. G. Bn. was completed at 23.45. The enemy activity throughout this day was confined to the usual spasmodic bursts of machine gun fire and harassing artillery fire. To show the strength of the front line brigade, the following effective strength report of midnight 7th October is given: UNIT OFF. MEN. M.G. RIFLEMEN A. R.

P The fire during this period consisted mainly of concentration on enemy strong points which were delaying the advance of the infantry. In addition harassing fire and some counter- battery work was executed. F. O. 64, 5th Corps, 7th October, 1918 received. Division F. O. 49 was issued at 18.30, October 8th, 1918, and in conformity with advance telephonic instructions followed by F. O. 40, artillery plan for the attack of October 8th was laid out as follows: Artillery preparation to commence at 15 hrs., October 8th, 1918, and to consist of a heavy destructive fire by the 155s on the Trench de la MAMELLE. From H hour on, the execution of a covering fire on all strong points, in accordance with time-table adapted 21 to that of the rolling barrage executed by the regiments of 75s.

D Southern edge of BOIS de BEUGE. The operations of the 6th Brigade during the 8th of October were as follows: 'Early in the morning the 38th Infantry and the 30th Infantry each sent out one company as a combat patrol. The latter returned at daylight. The Company of the 38th Infantry attacked Hill 253 at 6 hrs. The Captain of this company was severely wounded while the attack was in progress. They encountered severe machine gun fire which stopped their progress, after taking several prisoners, near the top of the hill. Position held and men dug in at 7 45. This patrol joined by another company from the 38th Infantry finally reached north side of hill, and met heavy machine gun fire from both flanks. Dug in at 8.45. Machine gun fire heavy. Retirement to southern slope of hill forced for protection, leaving O. P. on crest of hill. Many losses suffered during this action. Three prisoners were taken during the action. While being brought in, one tried to escape and was shot by the sentry. A little later the other two prisoners and sentry were killed by machine gun fire. The enemy line was 75 yards from our line at this point. The enemy attacked Hill 253 at 16.45 in small 23 numbers; at the same time a smoke screen was sent up from the Trench de la MAMELLE. The attack was broken by high explo- sive and phosgene. The attack continued at 8.30, A.M. October 9th. The 5th Brigade remained in Division Reserve. As a result of this attack the 6th Brigade took and held Trench de la MAMELLE and BOIS de CUNEL, taking many prisoners and concrete pill-boxes north of Hill 253. At 8.30 October 9th the 5th Coips attacked. The 3rd Division attacked with the bth Brigade in the front line, regiments side by side, one battalion of each regiment ahead. Our mission was to capture the heights east and west of ROMAGNE. By noon the Trench de la MAMELLE was in our possession and we continued the advance. Our front line advanced slowly throughout the afternoon and drove the enemy from a number of well-hidden and well-placed machine gun nests. The front line at nightfall was approximately as follows: From point F 7984, north east 300 meters, thence directly east through the line of trenches which lies partly in' the east side of Square 84 and run through the middle of Square 94, to NANTILLOIS-CUNEL Road. The operations of the 5th Brigade during this day were as follows: By 2.30 Company I had been relieved by the 126th Infantry. At 12.15 the 7th Infantry was ordered to a position of read- iness south of the BOIS de BEUGE and at 14.12 moved out to take up that position. At 14.35 the Division Commander ordered the 7th Infantry to take up position in readiness south of Woods 250, the 4th Infantry to take up a position south of Woods 268, and the 8th M. G. Bn. to take up position south of the BOIS de BEUGE. At 15.33 the 2nd and 3rd Bns. of the 4th Infantry had moved out; and at 17.50 the C. 0. 8th M. G. Bn. reported that all the companies of his battalion had moved out by small detachments. At 18.15 the C. O. 7th Infantry reported that he had estab- lished his P.

At 23.55 the Division Commander telephoned the C G. 6th Brigade that CUNEL was excluded from the 6th Brigade sector and that maps for the new sector were being sent by fast motorcycle. Division F. O. 52, 3rd Division, stated that the 3rd Division had broken through the Hindenburg line and prescribed that the attack would continue at 7 hrs. October 10th. In view of the advances of the preceding two days by the infantry, it was now rendered necessary that the artillery move for- ward. One battalion from each of the light regiments and one battalion from the heavy regiment moved forward. The 2nd Bn. of 76th F. A. to a point of about 1 Vs km north of CIERGES; the 1st Bn. of the 10th F. A. to a point astride the NANTILLOIS-CUNEL road southwest of the BOIS des OGONS; the 2nd Bn. 18th F. A. to a point just south of CIERGES. Throughout the night of October 9th/ 10th, harassing fire and fire on known enemy batteries was carried out by the 3rd F. A. Brigade. On the morning of October 10th at 7hrs. the Division continued the attack, its mission being to capture BANTHEVILLE and the heights east and west of that town. The advance developed slowly, being retarded by the enemy's concentrated machine gun fire. At 1.30 the Chief of Staff, 3rd Division, directed that one more battalion and the M. G. Co. 7th Infantry be placed at the disposal of the C. G. 6th Brigade. This order was transmitted to the C. O. 7th Infantry. The situation of the Brigade was now as follows: Brigade P. C. — MONTFAUCON.

Com- pany E, 4th Infantry, was selected for this duty. At 16.55 October 10th the Division Commander directed that the troops of the 6th Brigade capture the trench just north of BOIS de CUNEL in the 30th Infantry sector. The trench was taken at 2.30. Some prisoners were taken in the operation and somelosses sustained. Enemy machine gun nests situated in the extreme west end of the trench were not completely cleaned up. The work of the artillery during the battle of the 1 Oth, commenced at 7.35 with a heavy rolling barrage covering the terrain between ROMAGNE and CUNEL and then progressing in a northwesterly direction beyond BANTHEVILLE. At the same time the 18th F. A. executed concentration fire on the enemy strong points. No material advance however was registered, but the enemy's organized strong points were so developed that the artillery was able to fire destructi- vely upon them throughout the night following. On the 1 1 th of October the attack was continued under the same general conditions as existed on the previous day. Fight- ing continued throughout the day, with the result that while no material advance was made, the enemy was completely exhausted and our lines improved. Prisoners reported that the 458th and 459th Regiments of Infantry had entirely melted away in our front, with the 136th and 457th rapidly approaching the same condition. The 7th Infantry was placed at the disposal of the C. G. 6th Brigade by direction of the C. G. 3rd Division and was used with the 6th Brigade in the attack north of the BOIS de CUNEL on the morning of the 1 1 th. Commencing at 7 hrs October 11th, a heavy artillery fire was delivered by the 3rd F. A. Brigade in front of our infantry. This consisted of concentrations of 155 s. The same rolling barrage as was delivered on the 10th was again laid down and in addition a heavy combing fire on the western edges of the BOIS de la PULTIERE and the BOIS des RAPPES,to a depth of about 500meters. One battalion of the 59th C. A. C. was attached to the 3rd 26 F. A. Brigade. However, this unit passed from under the command of the 3rd F. A. Brigade two days later, without being called on for any fire. On the evening of October 11th, the artillery was notified that an enemy tank had been observed moving south, and it was directed that two pieces from the 10th F. A. be ordered to a forward position from which point direct fire could be executed on any tank advancing from the north. On the 11th/ 12th October the 80th Division on our right was relieved by the 5th Division, while the 32nd Divison on our left remained in position. In accordance with F. 0. 71, Hq. 5th Army Corps, 12th October 1918, 10 hrs. the 3rd Division passed to the tactical control of the 3rd Corps at 15 hrs., details of supply remaining as before. Division F. O. 55, October 12th, 1918, 19.15 was issued, directing the relief of one battalion of the 5th Division which held the front line from about 10.0— 84.8 to 11.0-85.5. During the night 1 2th/ 13th October, hampered by a heavy rain and a thick fog, and during heavy shelling of the entire front lines • by the enemy, the relief of the 5th Division on our right was suc- cessfully completed. The 3rd Division now held the line from the CIERGES-ROMAGNE road to within approximately one kilometer of the MEUSE. The 5th Division being relieved, assembled in the woods of NANTILLOIS-CUNEL road, in a position in readiness for the attack the following morning. The operations of the 5th Brigade were reported for this date, as follows: \"At 17 hrs. a warning order was received to the effect that the 30th Infantry would relieve the right element of the 5th Division and that two battalions of the 4th Infantry would relieve the elements of the 4th Division which held the west edge of the BOIS de FORET ' to the east end of the BOIS de PEUT de FAUX. The C. O's. 30th and 4th Infantry had already received their orders from the C. Q. 3rd Division direct. At 18.30 the 1st and 3rd Bns. of the 4th Infantry passed through FARM de la MADELEINE en route to their new positions. At 20 hrs. battalion commanders of the 30th Infantry left FARM de la MADELEINE, taking with them stragglers carrying up water and rations. One battalion of the 5th Division was relieved by a battalion of the 30th Infantry. The elements of the 4th Division were relieved by the elements of the 4th Infantry. The right brigade 27 now became the 4th and 30th Infantry, and was under the command of the C. Q. 5th Brigade, while the 7th Infantry was under the command of the C. G. 6th Brigade. This was necessitated by the geographical location of the regiments and Brigade P. C's. F. O. 55, 3rd Division, received October 12th, pertaining to transfer of the 3rd Division from the 5th Corps to the 3rd Corps. American officer surveying the ruins of the Church in Montfaucon (Meuse-Argonne Offensive). F. O. 28, 3rd Corps called forth F. 0. 58, 3rd F. A. Brigade making a new grouping of the artillery. Under this order the 10th F.A. Brigade, plus one regiment 75s and one battalion 155s (13th F. A.) from the 4th F. A. Brigade were designated to support the 3rd Division in its attack ordered for H hour, October 14th. The main mission of the 3rd F. A. Brigade was that of forming a rolling barrage for the 5th Division, who were to attack at the same 28 hour and date, and in addition to execute a gas attack on the western border of the BOIS des RAPPES to a depth of 300 meters with the regiments of 75s while the 155s were to execute fire for destruction on strong points. For this operation the 77th F. A. and 25Qth R. A. C, were attached to the 3rd F. A. Brigade. On this same date (October 12th) the French units attached to the Artillery Brigade on October 6th passed from under its command. October 13th preparation was made and plans were laid for the general attack which was to take place on October 14th. The artillery executed some firing throughout the day on call from the Infantry. At 6 hrs. the relief, which had been progressing during the night, was reported complete and liaison established between the 30th Infantry and the 4th Infantry. Between 14.20 and 15.25, the front lines of the 4th Infantry suffered a very heavy enemy bombardment which was followed by a determined counter-attack. This was repulsed. The 6th Brigade units in the front line also repulsed a heavy counter attack from the northwest, the entire line holding with the exception of one small piece of woods in which artillery con- centration was so heavy that the troops withdrew a short distance for protection and then when the artillery fire slackened, advanced to their former position. The enemy's resistance from machine gun fire throughout the day was strong and his artillery fire well directed. At 8.30, October 14th, the 3rd Corps attacked, the 5th Divi- sion passing through our lines between ROMAGNE and CUNEL with the mission of driving through toward BANTHEVILLE. The mission of the 3rd Division was to hold that part of its line through which the 5th Division passed and to advance to the Army First Phase Objective on the right. The 30th Infantry was assigned the special task of cleaning up the BOIS de la PULTIERE and the BOIS des RAPPES, in cooperation with the 5th Division which was attacking these woods from the southwest. The attack developed slowly, meeting with stubborn resistance; and night found us in possession of the BOIS de la PULTIERE, and with our line well advanced into the BOIS de FORET. At 5.30, October 14th, the 76th F. A. and the 18th F. A. delivered a gas attack on the BOIS de la PULTIERE and the BOIS des RAPPES with non-persistent gas. From H- 1 (7.30 A. M.) 4 29 to H-4.30 minutes, the 18th F. A. executed heavy concentration on strong points in consecutive jumps conforming to the timetable of the barrage executed by the regiments of 75. The barrage executed by the 76th F. A. and the 77th F. A. was reinforced by the 250th R. A. C, which regiment executed its barrage 300 meters in advance of the barrage line of the other two regiments. The entire barrage took four hours and fifteen minutes to execute and was fired at the rate of two rounds per piece per minute the first hour and one round per piece per minute for the balance. The starting line was about 200 meters north of the CUNEL-ROMAGNE road and the final line north of GRAND GARRE FARME. The distance covered from the most eastern point of the barrage line to the most western was 2100 meters. After completion of the artillery plan for the attack all firing was delivered on call from Brigade liaison officer with the infantry or on targets signaled by the forward O. P's. At 7.30, October 15th, the attack was continued, but outside of a general local improvement of the line no advance was made. A detailed report of the movements of the 5th Brigade on this date is as follows: At 10.30, 15th October, 1918, Brigade P. C. was moved from MADELEINE FARME to concrete dugout at 09.9—84.7. At 14.45, one Company (C) of the 6th Engineers was placed at the disposal of the C. G. 5th Brigade and this company and another battalion of the 7th Infantry (2nd) was reported to the C. O. 4th Infantry. The 2nd Bn. 7th Infantry was placed in support along the line of narrow gauge railroad along the southern part of BOIS de FORET. Company C of the 6th Engineers was sent to help Companies A and L, 4th Infantry, who were undertaking to capture la MI-NOEL WOODS and HILL 299. The 6th Brigade reported that the troops had succeeded in occupying the northeastern part of the BOIS de la PULTIERE, and that many casualties were suffered by the troops, and a few prisoners taken. Throughout the day the artillery maintained close liaison with the infantry, and all fire called for was promptly delivered. This fire consisted mainly of heavy concentration on strong points temporarily holding up the advance of the infantry, in addition to harassing fire on the enemy front, and interdiction fire on the rear areas. The advance of the infantry was slow but steady, the enemy putting up a strong resistance. A message from 3rd Army Corps, 2.45, October 15th directed 30 that the attack be pushed with vigor and that division and corps artillery be advanced in time for close support. Division F. 0. 58, issued October 15th 1918, at 22 hrs., stated that there would be no general attack on the 16th and units would dig-in and reorganize. During the day there was no mentionable change in position of the various units. Troops held the ground already gained. The 5th Brigade was designated by F. O. 59, October 16th 1918, 14.55 to relieve the units of the 6th Brigade in the forward area. The 38th Infantry took up position just south of MONT- FAUCON; the 30th Infantry took up position on the CUISY-MONT- FAUCON road just south of MONTFAUCON, in accordance with the provisions of the Field Order. The P. C. 6th Brigade to be at MONTFAUCON. This relief was completed as ordered the night 16th October 1918. Division F. O. 60, issued October 16th, 1918, at 21 hrs., was received by the brigades. The F. A. Brigade was relieved of the command of the 77th F.-A. and the 280th R. A. C, and the 10th F. A. returned to its command. The brigade again found itself in support of the 3rd Division which was holding the sector directly west of the MEUSE, extending to CUNEL. Such fire as was called for by the infantry was delivered, and an offensive barrage and O. C. P. prepared. In addition, a concentrated bombardment by Corps and Divi- sional artillery was carried out on October 18th on suspected and known machine gun nest, hostile lines of resistance and artillery emplacements. This fire continued throughout the day. Total of ammunition to be expended. For each 75mm Bn. 100 rounds per hour. For each 155 mm Bn. 30 rounds per hour. Fire to commence at 7 hrs. Fire to cease at 17 hrs. In compliance with prior Corps orders the artillery plan of employment for defense of the sector was finished during this period and submitted. The plan however was not put into execution as F. O. 61, 3rd Division, was issued on October 19th calling for an attack at H hour D day on BOIS de CLAIRS CHENES and HILL 299. The 16th F. A. was attached this date to the 3rd F. A. Brigade. On October 17th the division occupied the front line described below (from west to east); BOIS de la PULTIERE (east edge] — Point 10.5-86.0 — «* 31 11.3-86.3 - 12.3-86.4 - thence following the border of the BOIS de PEUT de FAUX, to the Point 12.2-84.8, on the CUNEL-BR1- EULLES road, with the 5th Brigade in the front line. (See Map - MONTFAUCON - 1/50,000). The detailed movements of the units of the 5th Brigade on this date, were as follows: The relief of part of the 4th Infantry by the 7th Infantry was not completed before daylight due to the fact that the C. O. 2nd Bn. 7th Infantry did not receive his orders for the relief until 5 hrs. By 21 hrs., the left of the line, which was held by the 4th in- fantry and a company of 6th Engineers, with some men of the 1st Bn., 7th Infantry, mixed with them, had been relieved by the 2nd Bn. 7th Infantry. At that hour, Companies L, B, C, D and M, 4th Infantry were in the front line from left to right in the order named; the line held by them running as follows: From 11.5-86.0 to 11.75-85.85 to 11.8 -85.4 to 12.0-85.4 to 12.6-85.4 to 12.7-85 0. Companies A, F, G and I (4th Inf.) were in support at 11.4-84.8. The 2nd Bn. 7ih Infantry was disposed on the left in four combat groups at the following points: 10 6-86.0 to 10.8 86.2 to 1 1 .0-86 3 to 1 1 .3-86. 1 ; the remainder of the battalion being in support. The 6th Brigade remained in position of reserve throughout the day. There were no changes in the position of the artillery, and the amount of firing executed by them throughout the day was below normal. F. 0. 32, 3rd Army Corps, 17 October 1918, 10 P. M. received directing an improvement of positions and continuance of the ad- vance and mopping up of the BOIS de FORET and the CLAIRS CHENE5. There was no general attack on October 18th. At 15 hrs., the 1 1th Infantry on our left was to attack and clean up the BOIS des RAPPES, and the 7th Infantry had orders to be on the alert to seize any opportunity to advance its line which might be offered by the attack of the 11th Infantry. The C. 0. of the front line battalion of the 7th Infantry (2nd) sent out liaison combat groups to the left to keep contact with the 11th Infantry and three patrols toward HILL 299. The patrols toward HILL 299 were stopped by enemy machine gun fire and the combat liaison group failed to gain contact with the 11th Infantry. It was later learned that the 1 1th Infantry made but slight advance into the southern edge of the BOIS des RAPPES. 32 The 6th Brigade was ordered to relieve the elements of the 4th Division holding the line in the BOIS de PAYS, BOIS de BRIEULLES and the BOIS de la COTE LEMONT, the 30th Infantry taking over the right sector extending to the MEUSE, the 38th Infantry the left sector connecting up with the 5th Brigade at that point. P. C. 6th Brigade in the southern edge of the BOIS de SEPT SARGES. This relief was completed night 18th/ 19th October and the general position organized in depth. There was no general attack on October 19th. The day was spent in preparation and consultation with reference to the attack on the 20th. Memorandum 365, G-3, dated 19th October, 19.30, was issued, prescribing D day as October 20th and H hour as 7 hrs. One Company of the 7th Machine Gun Battalion was placed at the disposal of the C. G. 5th Brigade. On the morning of October 20th, 1918, at 7 hrs., the 3rd and 5th Divisions, in close cooperation, attacked. The mission of the 3rd Division was to clean out and hold the BOIS CLAIRS CHENES and HILL 299. The attacking troops consisted of elements of the 5th Brigade reinforced by part of the 1st battalion of the 6th En- gineers and the 7th Machine Gun Battalion. At 7 hrs. after five minutes artillery fire on the south edge of CLAIRS CHENES, the attack started. A moving barrage pre- ceded it at the rate of 100 meters in 10 minutes until the barrage reached a point 300 meters north of the northern edge of the woods where it remained for a half hour and then moved to HILL 299. At that point it was to remain until the C. O. of the attacking troops requested that it be lifted by a rocket signal. At 14.30 the BOIS CLAIRS CHENES was reported cleared of the enemy. It subsequently developed that but a small detach- ment under the Commanding Officer of the attacking troops had reached the northern edge. The remainder of the force, after ad- vancing into the woods withdrew under belief that the enemy was filtering in behind them from both flanks. C. 0. 7th Infantry organized a counter-attack and at 18 hrs. the BOIS CLAIRS CHENES was again in our hands, with three officers and 112 other rank of the enemy in our possession. We were successful in taking BOIS de CLAIRS CHENES, but did not clear HILL 299 of the enemy. Therefore, on October 20th, F. O. 62, 3rd Division, was issued ordering a further attack on HILL 299. The hour for the attack was 12 noon, October 21st. During the night of October 20th/2 1st a change in position of the 2nd Bn. 7oth F. A. and the 2nd Bn. 10th F. A. was executed, the first 33 moving into position in the northern part of the BOIS des OGONS and the latter in the northwest portion of the BOIS de CUNEL. On the 21st of October 1918, the attack started at noon against HILLS 297 and 299. The attacking troops were, besides the elements of the 5th Brigade, the 6th Engineers, one battalion from the 6th Brigade and the 7th M. G. Bn. At 14.30 a message was received by the C. O. 7th Infantry from a lieutenant with the assaulting troops, as follows. 'I am 100 yards north of la MI-NOEL WOODS and have ad- vanced on HILL 299. Minenwerfers to the rear of the Hill and light artillery to the northeast are giving us trouble. Two com- panies of the 38th Infantry and two machine-gun companies are in reserve, and at 1.25 were sent forward to complete the capture and organization of HILL 299.' However, because of the heavy enemy shelling the position on HILL 299, which was completely exposed, was not organized until night came and gave us protection for digging-in. A detailed report by the 5th Brigade of the day's action is as follows. Shortly after midnight, 21st October 1918, F. O. 62, G-3, 3rd Division, was received, ordering an attack on COTE 299; the time of the attack being fixed by a separate Memorandum for 12 hrs. October 21st, 1918. At 2 hrs., F. O. 12, 5th Brigade, was issued, directing the C. O. 7th Infantry to arrange the dispositions of the attack, using troops of the 7th Infantry, and any of the following placed at his disposal: Co. E. 4th Infantry; one battalion 38th Infantry; 3 com- panies, 6th Engineers, and the 7th M. G. Bn. The attack started ten or fifteen minutes late in heavy enemy barrage. Two companies of the 38th Infantry were in advance, flanked by four machine guns of the 4th Infantry on the left and two machine guns of the 8th M. G. Bn. on the right. One company of the 4th Infantry was in support. A detachment of the 7th Infantry operated separately onthe right againstlaMI-NOEL WOODS. Two companies of the 38th Infantry, which were in reserve were, at 13.25, sent forward to assist in completing the capture and organization of HILL 299. The attack was successful, and at 15 30, the line had been extended around the northern edge of CLAIRS CHENES and thence along the crest of HILL 297, thence along the southern edge of the patch of woods which are just north of COTE 299 and just south of the CUNEL-CLERY LE GRAND road, thence to the northeast corner of la MI-NOEL WOODS, thence east about 100 meters, thence south. About this time, while all available infantry were engaged in the attack, the Boche, coming from the northeastern edge of the B01S des RAPPES, attempted to enter the BOIS CLAIRS CHENES from the northwest, and some of the troops, having fired most of their ammunition, withdrew, and a few Boche penetrated the woods C. O., 7th Infantry, hastily organized runners and such other men as were in the vicinity of the P. C. which was in the northern edge of the BOIS de la PULTIERE, and personally led the troops through the woods and cleared it of the Boche and again estab- lished the line along the edge of the woods. During the afternoon and evening the enemy continued to shell heavily HILL 297 and COTE 299. Many casualties were suffered throughout the entire action. The German machine guns, being well placed, toss heavy toss of our advancing troops. Beginning at 6 hrs., October 2 1st, the following program of fire was carried out by the 3rd F. A. Brigade, reinforced by the 16th F. A. At 6 hrs. gas attack on HILL 299, nothwest edge of BOIS de FORET, woods in Square 17. This same fire repeated at 8.50 same day. From 11 hrs. to 12 hrs. a concentrated bom- bardment on Hill 299. From 12 hrs. until termination of the attack, covering fire on woods north of HILL 299 in Square 17 and in northwest edge BOIS de FORET. In addition, a defensive barrage was figured to be laid after taking HILL 299, in event of a counter-attack. There was no general attack on the 22nd October 1918, by the 3rd Division. Liaison was established on HILL 299 between the 4th and 7th Infantry. At 9.30 it was reported to Division Headquarters that patrols had penetrated 500 yards to the east of the BOIS de FORET and encountered no resistance. The 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 30th Infantry were placed at the disposal of the C. Q. 5th Brigade. At 13.45 he reported that the enemy had left the BOIS de FORET and that our troops held the northern and eastern edges of the woods. The enemy at this time was seen entrenching on HILL 281. Our artillery im- mediately opened up on the hill, with direct observation by their forward liaison officer, and the enemy soon cleared out. Our troops occupied the position at nightfall, with strong outposts. At 15 hrs. the 3rd Battalion, 30th Infantry reported at the P. C. 5th Brigade with 5 officers and 300 men and were sent forward to report to the C. 0. 4th Infantry. At 16 hrs. the 2nd Bn. 30th Infantry reported to Brigade P. C. with 4 officers and 298 men, and were placed in reserve near the Brigade P. C. At 20.30 a patrol of the 7th Infantry reached HILL 281 and found it cleared of the enemy. The artillery was not called on for much fire during the day, the infantry requesting that no artillery fire be delivered on the BOIS de FORET during the afternoon, later informing the 3rd F. A. Brigade that the enemy had been driven from these woods. On October 23rd, the only operations reported by our troops were minor patroling and general organization of the line. C. O. 4th Infantry sent a company of the 38th Infantry, as a patrol into BRIEULLES and found it clear of the enemy. This company was, however, re-called shortly afterwards, its position in BRIEULLES giving us no advantage and placing the company in a precarious position tactically. Officer patrols were sent out by the 4th Infantry and tried to work into CLERY le PETIT, but were stopped at the outskirts of the town by machine gun fire. Telephonic information from the Corps reporting that the enemy was retiring caused us to keep up constant patroling throughout the night. In the meantime, advantage had been taken of all available opportunities to redistribute the artillery by echelon without inter- fering with its ability to function. This gradual movement had commenced on October 19th and on October 23rd the units of the 3rd F. A. Brigade were in position as follows: 76th F. A. - Regimental P C. - MONTFAUCON; 1st Bn. about Va km. south of BOIS de CUNEL; 2nd Bn. east part BOIS des OGONS. 10th F. A. - Regimental P. C. - MONTFAUCON; 1st Bn. south portion BOIS des OGONS; 2nd Bn. northeast portion BOIS de CUNEL. 18th F. A. - Regimental P. C. - MONTFAUCON; 1st Bn. directly north of NANTILLOIS; 2nd Bn. about 1 km due east of NANTILLOIS; 3rd Bn. north of CIERGES. On this same date (October 23rd) the 90th Division on our left attacked BANTHEVILLE and BOURRUT. Throughout the day the Artillery Brigade fired principally upon advice from its liaison officer with the infantry, and the infantry was successful in cleaning out the woods directly north of HILL 299 and in Square 17. On October 24th troops remained in their position, organizing and improving them to the best of their ability; and were assisted in this work by the Engineers, particularly in the wiring of strong 36 i points. An officer-reconnaissance was made by three officers of the Valley of the ANDONNE, between AINCRE-VILLE and CLERY le GRAND. The Andonne was found to be a narrow creek, average width 300 meters, average depth 3 feet, average height of bank not over 3 feet, with a gradual slope to the water. The officers reported that corduroy road, with a small trestle bridge would suffice for the crossing of moderately heavy artillery. Patrols sent out by the 7th Infantry between midnight and daylight, on the information from the Corps of a possible enemy retirement, were all met with rifle and machine gun fire as they approached the ANDONNE River. Some dugouts along-side the river were found by the patrols to be empty; but the enemy was holding the heights on the opposite side of the river and were in position to easily prevent a crossing. Patrols from the 4th Infantry were likewise held up at the ANDONNE between CLERY le GRAND and CLERY le PETIT. The 5th Brigade, including 2 battalions of the 30th Infantry, five companies of the 38th Infantry, and two companies of the 7th Machine Gun Battalion and the Machine Gun Company of the 30th Infantry were designated to form the zone of outposts, and the 6th Brigade the principal line of resistance (less units detached) and with the addition of the 7th Machine Gun Battalion. This was in accordance with the Plan of Defense for the sector occupied at that instant by the 3rd Division. The 25th passed even more quietly than the 24th. The artillery spent the day in adjusting its fire on enemy . trenches on the east bank of the MEUSE opposite BRIEULLES and two batteries of 75s designated to cover the same. Some fire was delivered throughout the day on request of the infantry, on various designated points, and some, minor counter-battery work was executed. On the night 26th/27th October, pursuant to advance instructions received from the 3rd Corps, the 3rd Division was relieved by the 5th Division, the 3rd Division passing into Corps Reserve and assembling approximately in the following locations: 5th Brigade and the 7th M.G.Bn., in the BOIS de TUILERIES; 6th Brigade, near SEPTS ARGES; 6th Engineers at NANTILLOIS. The 3rd F. A. Brigade was placed at the disposal of the C. G. 5th Division, and the command of the sector passed to the C. G. 5th Division at 8 hrs. 27th October, 1918. Then came a much needed rest for the 3rd Division which had been twenty-seven days straight in the front line, fighting almost 37 continuously night and day, and advancing seven kilometers against organized defenses. It had accomplished its difficult mission in breaking the hinge to the line of the entire German army. The advances of the division that took its place in the battle line, showed the fact that the enemy who had opposed the 3rd Division had' been literally fought to pieces. Beyond the fact of practically continuous fighting, ten distinct attacks had been made. By days of the meanest, most bitter fighting that one can picture, the 3rd Division had broken defenses that had been organized for four years and had paved the way for the victorious American advances that followed. The troops that advanced, walked on the pavements laid by the stubborn work of the \"MARNE DIVISION\". One brigade at a time, the division (less 3rd F. A. Brigade) assembled near RECICOURT, south of MONTFAUCON, and em- bussed for the TANN01S Area. On November 2nd, its headquarters opened at TANNOIS, a small village about four kilometers south of BAR-le-DUC and the various units of the division settled down in this area to rest, clean up, and train, preparatory to entering the line once more. All were required to be \"on their toes\", for it was rumored that only a short time would be devoted to restore the organizations before the training would begin. New officers and men arrived daily to fill the gaps in the ranks caused by the hea- vy losses the division had suffered in the last action. On November 11th, at 5.00 P. M., news came that the ar- mistice had been signed, and a complete change came over every- one. Word was received that the 3rd Division was to be one of those to occupy part of the COBLENZ BRIDGEHEAD. On the 14th of November the troops embussed and were taken north through BAR-LE-DUC, ST. MI HI EL and VIGNEULLES, to the vicinity of ST. MAURICE, where they bivouaced. The journey lay over part of the old ST. MIHIEL SALIENT, to a point imme- diately south of the last battlefield and near the last \"No -Man's Land\" of the war on that front. German battle relics were in evi- dence everywhere; German railroads, graveyards filled with elaborate monuments, officers' houses, dug-outs, and \"pill-boxes\"; all matters of great interest to our men. From the 14th until the early morning of the 17th, the divi- sion headquarters was in the ruined village of ST. MAURICE. For the first time near the front, the troops were bivouaced in the old fashioned way - \"pup tents\" in rows and company streets laid out with military precision. The men seemed to care little about the cold weather; the joy over the fact that the war was over seemed to warm them. At 5.00 A. M., November 17th, the troops were prepared to cross \"No-Man's Land\"', beginning their long hard march to the When we reached Conflans we saw what American aeroplane bombs had done. Rhine. The camp fires burned, tents had been rolled and men stood around the fires in groups awaiting the order to \"fall in\". At 5.30 the two columns were under way. The artillery, which had not had the opportunity for a rest, having been attached to another division after the two in- fantry brigades had been relieved in the line, joined the columns in time to begin the march. The three artillery regiments had marched from the vicinity of VERDUN and when they caught up to the infantry kept on marching until the division stopped for the night. It was a long, hard day's march. 3Q Difficulties encountered in passing through No-Man's Land were slight. The front lines were distinguished by a few shell holes and numerous \"fox-holes\", where the last line the infantry had held marked itself. The country was desolate, except for the pre- sence of a few thin and dilapidated looking ex-prisoners, whom the Germans had released, presumably from the BRIEY mines. These prisoners were made up of Russians, Canadians, English and Americans. Although weary, they were in high spirits, as they trudged along past us toward a better land, the land we were leaving. At JAULNY the head of General Sladen's column was met by a delegation of French citizens, who had been out of touch with France, their native land, for four years. We received a royal welcome and with General Brown at the head, these re-born men, women and children, led the 7th Infantry band through the town followed by our troops. We finally reached CONFLANS, where the division headquarters was located for three days. French and American flags were in evidence everywhere. These latter had been made by the civilians in the short interval of a few hours which marked the Germans' withdrawal from and our entry into the city. One of these flags was presented by the officials to one of our regiments as it passed through the city upon the resump- tion of the march on the twentieth. After three days rest we moved again, this time into Lorraine with division headquarters in MOEUVRE LA GRAND. Lorraine, which had not been French since 1870, welcomed our troops; a large civic demonstration proved the sincerity of the people and showed that they appreciated the relief from the bond of the German military rule. Many of the women and little girls were dressed in the native costumes of the people of Lorraine, and although they only spoke German, they were, nevertheless, French in sympathy and in spirit. On the next days' march, November 21st, our troops passed through THIONV1LLE (D1EDENHOFEN), one of the largest cities of Lorraine. The soldiers were not warmly received, but people lined the streets, curious to see these Americans. Among these •on-lookers were many German soldiers, in uniform and wearing rosettes of tricolor, who had been released from the army since the signing of the armistice. The headquarters the next day was located in a picturesque old chateau in the little village of LA GRANDE FRANCOIS, two kilometers north of THIONVILLE. The Germans had stripped the place, leaving nothing but bare walls. The tapestries and all the furnishings except those in the chapel, had been taken to Germany. 40 The next day, November 22nd, our troops moved into Luxem- bourg with division headquarters at FIXEM. The terms of the armistice did not permit us to enter Germany; to cross the MOSELLE, A French woman of Confians and her idea of the Stars and Stripes. The flag was made stcretly by her while the Germans were still in possession of the town. She did her best, but placed nine stripes running vertically. until December first. FIXEM proved to be extremely unfitted for the division headquarters and the next day it was moved to REMICH. a beautiful little city on the banks of the AIOSELLE. The majority 41 of the people of Luxembourg seemed to be glad of our coming and we were welcome arrivals in a little country which had tried to be neutral during the four years of war. From the 22nd until our departure from Luxembourg, into Germany, the troops were busied in cleaning up, preparatory to the more difficult phase of the march to come. A great moment in History - American troops passing over the bridge from Luxemburg into Germany. The 3rd Division as part of the IV. Army Corps, occupied the extreme right of the Third American Army when the march across the MOSELLE into Germany started at 8.00 A. M., December 1st, 1918. Billetted in Luxembourg, in towns along the MOSELLE, from REMICH to SCHENGEN, the division crossed the MOSELLE bridges at these two places. Prior to the march from the MOSELLE to the RHINE, the divison was in Luxembourg for about nine days, cleaning up equipment, painting rolling stock, and training. Due to the hurried 42 trip from the vicinity of I3AR-le-DUC, the organization was unable to equip itself entirely, even with a week at its disposal, because of lack of sufficient motor transportation and due to the great dis- tance from the railhead, it was unable to move the complete supply of all necessary clothing and equipment. However, handicapped as it was, the 3rd Division marched across the MOSELLE on December 1st and presented an excellent appearance. Several organizations had painted their wagons, caissons and limbers, and other rolling stock, namely the 8th and 9th Ma- chine Gun Battalions and the 76th Field Artillery. It presented a fine appearance and set a high standard. The 6th Brigade moved across the REMICH bridge and the 5th Brigade across the bridge at SCHENGEN. The roads across the hills to the valley of the SAAR were one way, country roads, badly cut up by the heavy traffic of the\" German Army which had passed over them but a week before. Motor transport suffered the most and had it not been for the presence of a tractor, a number of trucks would have been ditched. Wagon transport was assisted over the steep grades by detachments which marched in the rear. The march discipline of the men improved. Commanding Officers paid particular attention to the uniform manner in which packs were rolled, helmets carried, and to the intervals between various units. Wagon trains were watched carefully in order to see that proper distances were kept, that only authorized drivers rode, and that when at a halt, wagons were far enough over to the right and that men were present to assist up steep grades. Infractions to all these rules were discovered, but as a whole the column presented an appearance second to none; a credit to the American Army. The first night in German territory, the Third Division was located along the SAAR river from SCHODEN, south to METTLACH. Division headquarters was at SAARBURG, where the only bridge available for our troops was situated. On the morning of December 2nd, the second day's march began at 7.00 A. M., the 6th Brigade preceeding the 5th Brigade. The 3rd F. A. Brigade and trains rested on the west side of the river in the vicinity of SAARBURG, crossing the next day. The march on the second was a particularly difficult one. A very bad hill between SAARBURG and NIEDERKRANTZ delayed the march considerably. Motor traffic was particularly handicapped, and only the good work of a tractor made it possible for all of the motor vehicles to surmount the hill. The destination for the 43 night of the second was reached by all troops before dark, the line generally. HILL 269 — RUWBR CREEK — WALDRACH (inclusive). The work of the Engineers, who reconnoitered each day's march ahead, made it possible for the division to proceed over the best available roads. It was often possible for units to pro- ceed over roads not previously used by the German 5th Army, thereby making the march a little longer but easier for both troops and transport. The Engineers placed signs on cross roads and in towns, and where traffic of two columns touched, an engineer officer was present to regulate the columns."
