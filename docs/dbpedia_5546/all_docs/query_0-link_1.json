The lower half displayed the Bavarian lozenges. Inbetween the crown of the lion had been omitted. Simmern gained city rights in 1330, partially confirmed in 1555, lost the status of a city in 1794 but regained it in 1857.\n\nSource: Stadler 1966, p.58\n\nKlaus-Michael Schneider, 11 Feb 2023\n\nThe date of approval of the banner is unknown.
