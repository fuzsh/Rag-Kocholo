Well I had planned to make this a stamp but I can't seem to shrink it anymore without runining the quality and making the text unreadable. If anyone knows how to do that feel free (and thank you in advance)

The Legend of White Fang was my favorite cartoon as a kid, more so than any other. It's a little known Canadian series that ran on HBO during the 90s. This show inspired so many of my original characters and stories; I used to "roleplay" out adventures with my "White Fang" toys (wolf figurines)

I recently got the entire series on DVD and have been rewatching it for an awesome nostalgic trip.

I took every one of these screencaps myself (seriously you can't FIND any good images for this series online, someday I might take more if anyone is interested) Images are from the following episodes: The Trap, The Gold Nugget , Leap of Danger and the series intro.

Anyways enjoy a random White Fang icon/stamp. I in no way claim the images used here, only the time taken to capture the screens.
