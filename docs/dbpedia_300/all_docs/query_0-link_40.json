Snoopy (Peanuts)\n\nSnoopy is a major character in the Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. He is the pet beagle of Charlie Brown (his best friend) who cares for him. Snoopy is blessed with a rich, Walter Mitty-like fantasy life.\n\nBreed: Beagle\n\n3. Santa’s Little Helper (The Simpsons)\n\nHe is the pet greyhound of the Simpson family. The dog was introduced in the first episode of the show, the 1989 Christmas special “Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire”, in which his owner abandons him for finishing last in a greyhound race. Homer Simpson and his son Bart, who are at the racetrack in hope of earning some money for Christmas presents, see this and decide to adopt the dog.\n\nBreed: Greyhound\n\n4. Scooby-Doo (Scooby-Doo)\n\nThe title character in the Scooby-Doo animated television series created by the popular American animation company Hanna-Barbera. Scooby-Doo is the male dog and lifelong companion of Shaggy Rogers and in many iterations, including the original series, is regarded as a unique Great Dane dog who is able to speak in broken English, unlike most other dogs in his reality, and usually puts the letter R in front of words spoken.\n\nBreed: Great Dane\n\n5. Scooby-Dum (Scooby-Doo)\n\nScooby-Dum is a supporting character in The Scooby-Doo Show, voiced by Daws Butler. Scooby-Dum, a Blue Merle Great Dane with spots and buck teeth is Scooby-Doo’s slow-witted cousin/brother (his lineage is dubious because Shaggy has said that he is his brother on one occasion but also his cousin, though it is most likely that they are cousins). In the episode “The Chiller Diller Movie Thriller”, his cousin Scooby-Dee stars.\n\nBreed: Great Dane\n\n6. Scrappy Cornelius Doo (Scooby-Doo)\n\nA puppy created by Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1979, with the famous catchphrase “Let Me At ‘Em” and is the nephew of the already mentioned cartoon star Scooby-Doo.

Droopy (Droopy)\n\nDroopy is an animated character from the Golden Age of American Animation. He is an anthropomorphic dog with a droopy face, hence his name. He was created in 1943 by Tex Avery for theatrical cartoon shorts produced by the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon\n\nBreed:Basset Hound\n\n8. Goofy (Mickey Mouse)\n\nGoofy is a funny animal cartoon character created in 1932 at Walt Disney Productions.

Spike (Tom and Jerry)\n\nSpike, occasionally referred to as Butch or Killer, is a stern but occasionally dumb grey American bulldog who is particularly disapproving of cats, but is gentle towards mice (though in his debut appearance, Dog Trouble (1942), Spike goes after both Tom and Jerry), and later, his son Tyke.\n\nBreed: American Bulldog\n\n11. Hong Kong Phooey (Hong Kong Phooey)\n\nThis goofy cartoon is one of Hanna-Barbera’s more original efforts. Hong Kong Phooey is the alter ego of Penrod Pooch (voiced by Scatman Crothers), the janitor at the police station. When a crime is committed “Penry” leaps into his file cabinet to change into the famous Hong Kong Phooey. In his Phooey mobile, the kung fu-fighting superhero sets out to save the day – which generally amounts to bumbling and leaving mayhem in his wake while his loyal cat sidekick, Spot does the real work. Invariably, Phooey awakes from whatever damage the villains have done to him and is stunned to see that he’s triumphed after all.\n\nBreed: Anthropomorphic mutt (has spaniel-like look)\n\n12. Huckleberry Hound (Huckleberry Hound)\n\nA blue dog that speaks with a Southern drawl and has a relaxed, sweet, and well-intentioned personality. He first appeared in the series The Huckleberry Hound Show and was also a star of a television film The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound.

Muttley (Wacky Races)\n\nMuttley is described as a mixed breed dog, identified in the Wacky Races segment “Dash to Delaware” as a mix of a bloodhound, pointer, Airedale, and hunting dog; best known for his distinctive snickering laugh, he is owned by accident-prone villain Dick Dastardly.\n\nBreed: Mix of bloodhound, pointer, Airedale, and hunting dog\n\n14.

Astro (The Jetsons)\n\nClumsy and dim-witted, but loyal to the Jetsons. He is more advanced than present-day dogs, in that he had a rudimentary grasp of the English language, albeit with r’s in many places they shouldn’t be, or replacing other letters. For example, “I love you, George” would be “I ruv roo, Reorge”.\n\nBreed:Great Dane\n\n17. Ren (The Ren & Stimpy Show)\n\nRen is a scrawny, violently psychotic, emotionally unstable Chihuahua dog who lives together with his best friend Stimpy, a Manx cat.\n\nBreed: Chihuahua\n\n18.

After October 1997, he began walking regularly on two feet, instead of all fours, like Garfield.\n\nBreed: Beagle – Dachshund – Terrier mix\n\n19. Bolt (Bolt the movie)\n\nBolt is a fictional White Shepherd and the eponymous protagonist of the 2008 animated feature film Bolt. In the film, he is voiced by John Travolta.

In the show, Bolt must use his superpowers to save his owner and co-star Penny, whom he loves dearly, from the evil Dr. Calico.\n\nBreed:German white shepherd\n\n20.

He is a fun-loving dog who speaks English via a special collar that translates his thoughts into speech, invented by his former master, Charles Muntz.\n\nBreed: Golden Retriever\n\n22. Dog (Catdog)\n\nCaninius “Canine” Dog is one of the two protagonists in CatDog. He is very fun-loving and enjoys chasing garbage trucks, chasing cars, and exploring many things in which Cat does not want to take part. He is voiced by Tom Kenny who also voices the legendary SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nBreed: American Foxhound / Jack Russel Terrier\n\n23. Dante (Coco)\n\nDante is Miguel’s best buddy and his companion to the land of the dead. He’s a street dog in the neighborhood and he helps Miguel conceal his love of music from his family.

Kyle (Despicable Me)\n\nGru’s ferocious, black, grey-eyed pet dog of an unknown species, which has the personality of a bulldog and the fang-like teeth of a piranha. At first, Kyle won’t hesitate to take a bite of anything that looks food to him, also hates to be hugged by Agnes. Along with Gru, Kyle warms up over the course of the film; in the end, Kyle ends up not minding about sleeping with the girls, especially Agnes.\n\nBreed: Unknown (speculated that it is altered Brussels Griffon)\n\n25. The Beagle boys (Scrooge McDuck universe, DuckTales)\n\nThe Beagle Boys are a group of comic book criminals from the Donald Duck universe. Created by Carl Barks, they are a family clan of organized criminals who constantly try to rob Scrooge McDuck.\n\nBreed: Beagle\n\n26. Brain (Inspector Gadget)\n\nBrain is the tritagonist in the Inspector Gadget franchise. He is Penny‘s dog who is the only one that knows Penny is the one who solves Gadget’s missions.\n\nBreed: Unknown (speculated that he’s a Beagle-greyhound mix)\n\n27. Bandit (Jonny Quest)\n\nBandit is Jonny’s pet bulldog, so named because he is white with black markings – including what appears to be a black domino mask around his eyes. This coloration is occasionally instrumental in foiling adversaries. Bandit is unique among his fellow Hanna-Barbera dogs (such as already mentioned Scooby-Doo, Huckleberry Hound, and Hong Kong Phooey), as he is a regular non-anthropomorphic dog. Still, he seems uncannily able to understand human speech and is capable of complex facial expressions.\n\nBreed: Bulldog\n\nDid we miss your cartoon hero? Maybe you have suggestions? Let us know!"
