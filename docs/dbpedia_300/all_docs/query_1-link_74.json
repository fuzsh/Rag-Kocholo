        "text": "03/01/2018 - The animated film by Alexandre Espigares, an adaptation of Jack London's novel, will make its world premiere at Sundance, in the Kids section\n\nWinner of an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film in 2014 with Mr Hublot, the Spanish-Luxembourgian filmmaker Alexandre Espigares, will berevealinghis debut feature film in world premiere in the Kids section at next year’s Sundance Film Festival (18 to 28 January 2018). White Fang is a French majority production, co-produced with Luxembourg and the United States and whose graphic universe was designed by Stéphane Gallard and Antoine Poulain.\n\nWritten by Dominique Monfery, Philippe Lioret and Serge Frydman and adapted from the eponymous novel by Jack London, White Fang tells the story of redemption. That of a wolf-dog driven into a spiral of violence, to the point of becoming a legend due to his cruelty, feared by all. Until one day some humans are able to awaken feelings that are buried deep within him. With a wolf father, and a dog mother, White Fang leads a life in tune with the laws of nature. From a very young age, the disappearance of his father and famine forced him to understand the fragility of existence. Like any young wolf, he experiences the power of nature, which can be both generous and cruel, gradually getting to know its ways. His meeting with a North American tribe opens the door to a new world, to which he adapts very quickly. But this new world, that of humans, brings with it a certain kind of danger that is even more insidious than that of the Far North. Indeed, his adoption provokes such an outburst of jealousy and revenge on the part of the other dogs in the tribe that White Fang is permanently marked by the rejection and hatred of those he believed to be his own. When his Native American master sells him to an unscrupulous white man, civilisation and his vices get the better of him. His new master mistreats him in order to incite the rage within him and thus use him in illegal dogfights. White Fang will find his salvation in an honest man, who will finally give him the chance to reveal his loyalty and the true depth of his nature.\n\nProduced by the Parisian company Superprod, White Fang was co-produced by France 3 Cinema, by the Luxembourg company Bidibul Productions and by the American outfit Big Beach. Also pre-purchased by Canal+, Ciné+ and France 4, the film was supported by Film Fund Luxembourg, the Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur, Grand Est, New Aquitaine, Alsace and Reunion regions, and the department of Charente. The film was also developed with the support of Cofinova Développement Puissance 5, Devanim (a Back Up Films fund), CNC and Procirep-Angoa, and won the Gan Foundation Award for Best Work in Progress at the Annecy Festival 2016.\n\nWild Bunch will distribute White Fang in France on 28 March, international sales are being driven by the American company SC Films.\n\n(Translated from French)"
