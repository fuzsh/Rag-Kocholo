        "text": "Netflix has released an animated adaptation of Jack London's classic novel White Fang. Now available on the streaming service, check out the trailer below.\n\nBy MattIsForReal -\n\nFiled Under: Movies\n\nJack London's classic novel White Fang has seen plenty of adaptations in the form of films television series (both live-action and animated). Well, now Netflix is taking a crack at telling the turn-of-the-century tale of the half wolf, half dog. Available to watch the streaming service right now, Netflix has released a trailer for White Fang, which you can first check out below.\n\nAs you can see, Netflix's White Fang - directed by Academy Award winner Alexandre Espigares - has both a unique art style and star-studded cast which includes the likes of Nick Offerman, Rashida Jones, and Paul Giamatti. Although presented as a kid's movie, White Fang has a pretty strong message about the contentious relationship between humans and nature due to greed and consumerism. Speaking to Deadline, Offerman explained it was that precise message that attracted him to the film.\n\n“Something I thought really came across was the message that I think is very important for the world, but especially for America right now. The protagonist in the film is sort of nature, and greed, or consumerism—represented by the Europeans that show up for the gold—that’s a bad influence. I just really appreciate that overall message that if you don’t worry about chasing the gold and be nicer to the elements of nature, we’ll all get along a lot better—and have delicious chickens.”\n\nWhite Fang is told through the dog-wolf's perspective as Espigares went through painstaking efforts to ensure a realistic behavior for the animal. “It’s a movie where the animals don’t speak, they don’t sing. They behave like animals,\" the director said.\n\nWhite Fang is currently available to stream on Netflix right now.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Toonado.com is protected under the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) and...
