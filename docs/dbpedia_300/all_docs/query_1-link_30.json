He is half-wolf and half-dog who was born wild, but becomes more dog-like after Grey Beaver domesticates him. He becomes a fighting dog after Beauty Smith buys him. He eventually becomes more loving and friendly after he is bought and tamed by Jack Conroy.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nWhite Fang[]\n\nWhen Jack encounters White Fang who has been cruelly mistreated by his owner, he rescues the wolfdog from the jaws of death during a fight with a fierce bulldog. Aided by his friend, Jack nurses White Fang back to health, and he becomes a close companion to Jack.\n\nWhite Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf[]\n\nJack passes the torch to adventure-seeker Henry Casey, along with White Fang. While transporting gold from his Alaskan mine by raft, Henry and White Fang get knocked into the river's current. They're rescued by an Indian princess, whose tribe believe Henry is the embodiment of the \"spirit wolf,\" sent to save them by bringing back the caribou that have vanished from their land.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]"
