        "text": "Man Reportedly Punches Grizzly Bear In The Face To Survive Attack\n\nA man reportedly punched a grizzly bear in the face to survive an attack in Northern British Columbia. Now, his story is being shared like some sort of Canadian Davy Crocket.\n\nPeople often question what you’re supposed to do if confronted by a grizzly bear. Do you run? Do you make yourself big and loud? Do you go on the attack first? There are so many options and if it happens you have merely split seconds to decide what to do. This guy appears to have opted to square up!\n\nMan Punches Grizzly Bear In The Face In British Columbia\n\nAccording to CBC, a cyclist in British Columbia, Canada is now recovering after a run-in with a grizzly and its 2 cubs that concluded with the man punching the bear in its face. It sounds crazy but you have to do what you have to do!\n\nThe incident happened on a trail close to Anderson Flats Provincial park when the cyclist had the misfortune of running into a momma grizzly and her 2 cubs, per CBC. Reports say the bear immediately went into protection mode and attacked forcing the man to use his bike as a sort of shield or fence between him and the bear.\n\nAccording to the CBC, the man remembered hearing a story about successfully getting a bear to stop attacking by punching it in its face so he gave it a try. To his astonishment, it worked! The punch sent the bear running into the nearby bush, the CBC reports. It worked this time but it’s not always recommended!\n\nThe man is now recovering from minor injuries suffered from crashing his bike but was actually not hurt by the bear during the attack! He should be counting his lucky stars. You don’t want to come between a mom bear and her cubs!\n\nHow To Protect Yourself From Bears\n\nIt’s always best to plan ahead and understand how to avoid bears to begin with. According to the National Parks Service, most bears will avoid humans if they hear them coming. So, if you’re hiking in an area where you could run into bears, try to noise so you don’t surprise them. While it might sound good to try to blend in and go unnoticed, you actually want to be noticeable.\n\nIf you happen to run into a grizzly bear, the National Parks Service says to identify yourself, stay calm, and do not run. If you are being attacked by a grizzly bear, the NPS says to play dead and lay flat on your stomach with your hands behind your neck. However, if you are being attacked by a black bear the NPS says do not play dead and try to escape or fight back. It’s important to understand the difference and what you’re up against!\n\nCort Freeman was born and raised in Metro Detroit. He was named Clarkston High School 2009 Class Clown 13 years after graduating. Totally normal thing to happen. That’s thanks to his time spent as an Intern at Comedy Central and Social Media Correspondent for The Colbert Report. Cort has done comedy across the country, both standing up and sitting down. When he’s not trying to make you laugh on-air and online, he’s probably at home enjoying his favorite shows like Seinfeld, South Park, and The Office. He’s also totally uncomfortable writing about himself in the third person. Cort enjoys writing about comedy, food, sports, and entertainment. So, basically anything and everything."
