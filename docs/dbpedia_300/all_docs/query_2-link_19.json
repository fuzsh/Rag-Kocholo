        "text": "YES this IS a cartoon version of Jack London's Whitefang.\n\nThe names are the same but the situations are..... not.\n\nWhitefang remains in the north instead of going to California with Wheaten Scott.\n\nWheaten Scott has a daughter(and no other family as opposed to the large household he had in the book) and Whitefang is a big arctic wolf(dog) who pals around with Wheatens daughter, Wendy, as opposed to paling around with Wheaten. Whitefang and Wendy share many Yukon adventures. many of them absurd, outlandish, unrealistic, just plain silly..... BUT for a child, it's heaven.\n\nI LOVED this show when i was a kid. I didnt have cable tv, let alone HBO, but my friend did. the highlight of every morning was getting to her house early in the morning so we could tune in to the next adventure before catching the bus. Imagine that..... a fifth grader who can wait to jump out of bed and catch the bus!*boy were our parents fooled!!* I was head over heels in love with the world of Jack London and his stories of the Yukon. I loved the wolves, the sled dogs, the wildness of the land, the HISTORY.... i guess i was a very strange kid. but none the less i aced my history classes and excelled in reading!\n\nI have waited YEARS to finally get my hands on this! I recently bought this collection mainly for my own nostalgic peace of mind, but it turns out my two sons (4 and 5 yrs old) both love it too! That just makes it all the more enjoyable because i dont have to listen to them whine and complain when i watch it - as opposed to when i tried to watch some other movie that wasnt on their level.\n\nMy ONLY complaint, and its not even worth removing a star for, is the packaging..... i absolutely HATE that each DVD is in a paper sleeve inside a thick box. again... i have small children who dont know they are small.... they want to do things for themselves and these sleeves can tear easily or become lost, OR thrown away by accident. But thats easily remedied. i keep the set on the top shelf and out of their reach...\n\nI Say Give it a try... buy the used copy if you're worried you wont like it.\n\nGranted, it IS cheap animation..... but if you have a kid who likes wolves, sled dogs, history, and Jack London(or if YOU like all those things) then its worth it to add it to the collection.\n\nAnd if you're just totally cowardly about it.... rent it from netflix first. Yep. they have the DVD's too, which was what tipped me off in the first place. i almost rented them when i decided to see if Amazon had them instead.\n\nNo regrets!\n\n*slight warning to parents*\n\nThis is a historal accounting, and while much of it is pretty far fetched, you may want to be aware that a lot of the topics deal with dog fighting, attempted murder, stealing, gun violence, arson, violence in general(one scene where a big burly claim jumper chases Wendy with an ax if i'm not mistaken) and animal trapping.\n\nFair warning if any of that bothers you. Watch it for yourself before you make a final judgment whether or not your children should see it.\n\nI cant say anything about the bonus episodes because i havent watched those yet. when/if i do, i'll update this review."
