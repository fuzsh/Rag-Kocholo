        "text": "An improvisation on Jack London’s eco-fable, White Fang miraculously conjures the snowswept wilderness of Canada’s Yukon plains, ranged by white puppet wolves, from a stuffy corner of one of London’s smaller studio spaces.\n\nJethro Compton’s production, which arrives at the Park theatre from the FreeFall theatre in Florida, is certainly ambitious. Compton, who multitasks as writer, director and designer, starts more or less where London left off: White Fang has been adopted by hunter Weedon Scott and his Native American “granddaughter”, who live in a remote shack, eking out an eco-friendly living from the fruits of gun and bow, while prospectors circle menacingly around them.\n\nWhere London’s fable was largely told from White Fang’s perspective, Compton’s puppet wolf is never quite central in a ballad opera in which key scenes are punctuated with sung and spoken recitative, covering stretches of narrative as vast as the landscape in which it takes place.\n\nThe versatile six-strong cast make a strong a cappella ensemble, fragmenting into a credibly rugged crew of outdoorsmen, with standouts from Mariska Ariya as the ardent Lyzbet, and Robert G Slade as her hard-drinking grandfather, a good man eroded by the civilisation he despises.\n\nThe trouble with the show is that the symbolic power of the partnership between girl and wolf competes for attention with all the other issues that we are informed Lyzbet faces. She is an outsider whose ancestral hunting grounds are being grabbed while she herself is to be sent for re-education – and possibly to an early death – at a reservation school. All this is spelled out by a well-heeled white woman, with whom she forms a romantic attachment over a folk remedy for frostbite. Bebe Sanders’s luminous Curly is the benign, feminine face of a macho society – a lover-in-waiting but also the principal balladeer, and a mother figure who helps Lyzbet to understand that pets die and their death is part of growing up.\n\nWhile this is a true and important part of Lyzbet’s rite of passage, I left feeling that her story would have been even more resonant were Compton to have had the confidence to stick more closely to the wolf – in other words, to show more and tell less."
