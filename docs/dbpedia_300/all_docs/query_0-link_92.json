        "text": "Bao is a Pixar short directed by Domee Shi. I will review the short and talk about the refueling of Pixar‚Äôs creative well and how they are tapping talent from their shorts.\n\nBao uses food to convey a metaphor about an overprotective mother and her son. More than that, it presents food as a language of love and as a way for families to bond. What I really like about this film is that it says something universal about human nature while also being grounded in a specific real-world location. The visuals constantly show that this is a Chinese-Canadian family living in Toronto. We see the food they cook, the bus they use and the Chinatown bakery they visit (it really is all about the food). It feels very personal to the director and to her experience growing up in that location, which in turn makes the short feel more unique.\n\nI also like that the character design has Domee Shi‚Äôs fingerprints. Instead of going for the standard Pixar character design (like the humans in Inside Out and Coco), this short goes for something unique, and it looks almost exactly like a 3D version of Domee Shi‚Äôs 2D drawings, down to the caricatured faces and short stubby hands. Domee Shi organized to film her mother cooking dumplings at Pixar so that the animators could use that as a reference for the food and the cooking scenes. She also mentioned that the costliest thing to animate was the dumpling because of its soft texture and malleable shape. They wanted that to be perfect.\n\nDomee Shi is also the first woman to direct a movie at Pixar (unless you count Brenda Chapman, who has a directing credit on Brave, but who got replaced by a man halfway through). She credited films like Coco and Sanjay‚Äôs Super Team for paving the way for more diverse storytelling at Pixar. But as much as the cultural context makes Bao novel, it‚Äôs a short that feels very Pixar in its construction. It reminded me of Up because of the super deformed character design, the magical realism serving as a metaphor for life, and the heart underlying the story. It also had hints of Finding Nemo‚Äòs overprotective parent and Ratatouille‚Äòs foodie flair.\n\nIt looks like Domee Shi will be heading a feature for Pixar. Will it be the next original after Onwards? Or is that too soon if she‚Äôs just now finished on Bao? It‚Äôs definitely exciting to see short directors move on to feature films. I was very impressed by Sanjay‚Äôs Super Team. I wish Pete Docter would consider giving Sanjay Patel a feature. As far as I can tell he is still at Pixar as he worked on Incredibles 2. His book illustrations of Hindu mythology are spectacular so I can only imagine what it would look like in a movie. His short used a visually distinctive animation technique, which is rare for Pixar. Maybe Spider-Verse will inspire Pixar to take risks.\n\nA third short director worth retaining is Leo Matsuda. He‚Äôs from Disney, not Pixar, but his short Inner Workings was another boldly personal concept. It was clever, funny, touching, and best of all, it mixed 2D with CG. That‚Äôs intriguing, right? If I were in the shoes of Pete Docter and Jennifer Lee, I would try to get Leo Matsuda to come direct his project Yokai Samba (a fusion of his mixed Brazilian and Japanese origin) at Disney or at Pixar. He previously sold the idea to DreamWorks, but since DreamWorks was purchased by Universal they might be up in the air. Like Sanjay Patel, Leo Matsuda has an experimental side worth exploring.\n\nThis leads me to wonder: is Disney/Pixar holding its creators on too tight a leash? Would a creator like Leo Matsuda be unable to carry his authentic vision on a project like Yokai Samba at Disney or Pixar? Domee Shi‚Äôs film, while personal, stayed well within the confine of the Pixar home style. Is that what Pixar prioritizes in features? Onward, which will be directed by Monsters University‚Äôs Dan Scanlon, sure doesn‚Äôt seem like it will break the mold. Meanwhile, Robert Kondo and Daisuke Tsutsumi, the two Monsters University animators who made The Dam Keeper in their free time, have left Pixar to pursue their own venture.\n\nThere is one sign that Pixar might be willing to try new animation styles, and that‚Äôs Pixar‚Äôs latest experimental short program, ‚ÄúSparksShorts‚Äù, launched in 2017. The first three shorts, Purl, Smash and Grab and Kitbull, will be shown on YouTube in February 2019. The next three, Float, Loop and Wind, will be released on Disney+ when the streaming service launches. While Purl and Float appear to be using standard CG animation, Kitbull uses minimalist 2D, and Smash and Grab looks like tech heavy sci-fi. The short that sounds the most promising to me is Loop, in which a non-verbal autistic girl must partner up with a chatty boy on a canoe trip.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that Disney has four release dates booked after Onward for ‚Äúuntitled Pixar films‚Äù. I‚Äôm curious to see who‚Äôs directing these films so I hope they tell us soon!"
