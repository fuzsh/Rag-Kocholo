        "text": "That's it. You can take them out and you lose nothing of value plot wise. The fact that they are group fighting for the rights of faunas doesn't affect the plot or their actions in the slightest. Unleashing grimm in the breach does not further their goals, attacking Beacon (one of the most progressive schools) doesn't further their goals and attacking Mistrial doesn't further their goals, It furthers Salem's and Cinders objectives, you could replace the White Fang with Roman's goons and you lose absolutely nothing.\n\nAnd before anyone mentions Sienna's White Fang, it doesn't exist. It was nothing more than patch work for the writers, there's was zero indication that their was inner conflict within in the White Fang in the earlier volumes, we barely see this supposed less bloodthirsty White Fang and Sienna dies anyway while making no impact or affecting anything. Adam could have been the White Fang leader from day one and you lose nothing.\n\nThis is even more true when you take into account what happens after their defeat. Salem isn't affected by losing manpower as she has the grimm who are limitless, the White Fang in Atlas is non - existent, they're gone from the story and nothing changed. And because the White Fang don't matter and massive part of Blake's character doesn't matter.\n\nThat's all."
