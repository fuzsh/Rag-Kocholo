First Minato's statement..\n\nHis father had respect on the same level as the legendary \"Sannin\"... - Namikaze Minato\n\nFrom this, we know that Sakumo had the same level of respect as them. Now, the databook.\n\nDatabook 2: TWF > any sannin in SKILL\n\nIn front of his skills, it is said that even the three sannins’ names would have been overshadowed.\n\nFull translation of the databook entry below. Source is\n\nDatabook 2 - Mokuton no Jutsu\n\nSpoiler:\n\nLegend of White Fang\n\nIn front of his skills, it is said that even the three sannins’ names would have been overshadowed. In Kakashi flows the blood of a great hero.\n\nKakashi’s father, Hatake Sakumo was known as White Fang. He left countless legends. Through the hands of his son, the source of his nickname, the white chakra sword, defeats the Leaf’s enemies after his death. Also, Sakumo’s legend does not stop with only honors on the battlefield. Always concerned with the mission and his companions, his way of life that left a mark on the Ninja’s way of life for the future progeny, is still approached with awe.\n\nSo.. In conclusion, The White Fang Hatake Sakumo was a badassmofoka who you shouldn't mess with, and was stronger then any of the three Sannin. What I am wondering is, if the translation means all 3 at once(doubtful).\n\nrespected and strengh are different\n\nsakumo was as respected as sannin TITLE\n\nkakashi no sharingan is more respected and famous in the world than itachi uchiha or hochigake kisame\n\ni just quote what kakashi think about jiraiya\n\n\" did he really manage to take on all the 6 ? \" ( he was talking about jiraiya without aknowlege)\n\nthe difference btween kakashi and jiraiya is even bigger than against zorro and Mihawk ..\n\nJiraiya was forced to use his strongest genjutsu on THREE pain bodies because there was nothing else he could do. All his taijutsu and ninjutsu were being negated. He said that himself. When the 6 bodies appeared, everything from there until jiraiya's arm was smashed occured off panel. Jiraiya did nothing but play defense from what we know of. He did not put up any sort of real fight against them. It's laughable to think that he might have when he couldn't take on more then 3. Though, I do realize if all 6 were captured in frog song, he could have won. That's pain playing it smart though. So, I really don't think that comment is too much to look into.\n\nThe Sannin apparently gained their fame around the time of the ninja war and were just given a title by Hanzou when he saw what they were capable of. At this time, I am sure Sakumo would have been stronger than them. We never saw any hints of summons or anything used by them in the Hanzou fight.\n\nYears later, Oro and Jiraiya could basically fart out summons and were completely different shinobi. They were nothing like their old selves, and I seriously doubt Sakumo would be able to top them. They became monsters towards the end of their lives. I would say Sakumo is a stronger version of Kakashi.....but that would still not be enough to take on Oro and Jiraiya prime\n\nI keep seeing people confusing Minato's statement in the Manga, and arguing that he wasn't greater then the Sannin. The manga isn't where this is stated. It's in the Databook. First Minato's statement..\n\nFrom this, we know that Sakumo had the same level of respect as them.

In conclusion, The White Fang Hatake Sakumo was a badassmofoka who you shouldn't mess with, and was stronger then any of the three Sannin. What I am wondering is, if the translation means all 3 at once(doubtful).\n\nGreat thread. What's more, you're a terrific smart ass (I'm particularly found of your work in response #5). Have some rep.\n\nI doubt it will ever be done, but I would have loved for Kishi to delve into his story more. It's a shame. I have no doubt that Sakumo was of a caliber surpassing that of the Sannin. Inasmuch as using Kakashi to gauge the power of his father, I have heard others make mention of an important factor.\n\nAlthough Kakashi's Sharingan has been in many ways a blessing, it could be an incredible burden/dead load on his chakra. With such an unnatural ability gifted to him, he probably hasn't developed as he would've (without it, naturally). Does it balance out? I'm not sure. Add to this Kakshi's comments of subsequent generations surpassing previous ones and it becomes a real mess.\n\nHowever, I don't think Kakashi's done developing. I'm interested if recent events with his father (after Kakashi's death & rez) had an impact on his chakra. Also, their might be further happenings with his eye before the story ends. This might reveal more about his power that could be used to better gauge his father's genius, ability, and power.\n\nFor reference, the statement as translated in the Viz manga is:\n\n\"In his time, the 'Three great Shinobi' of Konoha legend paled beside him.\"\n\nNo reference of reputation, so the statement in the databook isn't the only one talking about his strength.\n\nBut no single translation (unless it's by the absolute best: Nihongaeri) should be looked at solely. You should look for the idea presented in the statement.\n\nYakushi Kabuto said:\n\nThere's a reason why they were called the \"Legendary three,\" and he was just called \"the white fang.\"\n\nMinato himself states that \"The White Fang\"'s skill was far greater than the \"Legendary Sannin.\"\n\nSo apparently how cool the titles sound is worthless.\n\nKitsukaru said:\n\nKey words there \"It is said\". Clearly not stating fact.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, it is a fact.\n\nOtherwise, there'd be no use in such an obscure fact being stated.\n\nSeriously, look at quotes given what you'd imagine the author's intent is.\n\nEither way, I posted Viz's translation and it states outright that it's about strength.\n\namaterasu_41 said:\n\nThe databook entry is empty hype.\n\nThere's no such thing as \"empty\" hype. No single statement in the manga needs to be proven for anyone to believe it.\n\nYes, he was very strong. Does that mean he was better than any of the sannin? Probably not.\n\nIf he was specifically stated to be far stronger than the early 30's Sannin, then how strong do you think the author wanted us to think he was?\n\nBathroom Mop said:\n\nAt this time, I am sure Sakumo would have been stronger than them. We never saw any hints of summons or anything used by them in the Hanzou fight.\n\nThe statement referenced once the Sannin were already well-known as being \"legendary.\" Hanzou just gave them the title \"sannin,\" the \"legendary\" bit was something that they earned in subsequent wars.\n\nThe statement was likely referring to when the Sannin were in their early 30's.\n\nSannin age:\n\n51 in part 1\n\n38 when Naruto was born\n\n36-37 when Minato was made Hokage\n\n35-36 during the Kakashi gaiden\n\n30-31 when Sakumo was alive, and considered far beyond them\n\nJuracule Mihawk said:\n\nDon't expect Sakumo to be much more powerfull than current Kakashi, who's now almost on the league of the current Sannin.\n\nKakashi is nowhere near the league of the current Sannin. The fact Naruto needed a massive powerup to move from Kakashi's level up to Jiraiya's is proof of that...\n\nAnd current Kakashi is likely not near powerful enough to have been in a different level than the early 30's Sannin like his father was.\n\nSpoiler: OP in Wraps\n\nI keep seeing people confusing Minato's statement in the Manga, and arguing that he wasn't greater then the Sannin. The manga isn't where this is stated. It's in the Databook. First Minato's statement..\n\nFrom this, we know that Sakumo had the same level of respect as them. Now, the databook.\n\nDatabook 2: TWF > any sannin in SKILL\n\nFull translation of the databook entry below.

In Kakashi flows the blood of a great hero.\n\nKakashi?s father, Hatake Sakumo was known as White Fang. He left countless legends. Through the hands of his son, the source of his nickname, the white chakra sword, defeats the Leaf?s enemies after his death. Also, Sakumo?s legend does not stop with only honors on the battlefield.

In conclusion, The White Fang Hatake Sakumo was a badassmofoka who you shouldn't mess with, and was stronger then any of the three Sannin. What I am wondering is, if the translation means all 3 at once(doubtful).\n\nYou see people arguing points like this and using statements like this as strengths for their arguments and frankly, its useless. Kishimoto illustrates to readers great feats (a.k.a. Hype) for certain ninjas b/c they are better than others. Not only does he show us visually he also has characters say things like\n\n- \"greatest ninja in his/her generation\"\n\n- \"God of Shinobi\"\n\n- \"greatest student ever\"\n\n- \"Knowledge of vast amount of jutsu\"\n\n- \"Defeated <insert character>.\"\n\nyada yada yada\n\nWe as readers should take these visuals/comments as markers, to show that the subjected ninja is in fact a great ninja and should be feared. Arguing that one feat is greater than another is moot.\n\nIn this case, take Minato's comment as \"the White Fang was a great ninja\". Nothing more, nothing less."
