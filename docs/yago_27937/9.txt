Marty Feldman plays a meek monk who emerges from the monastery he's lived in all his life to get the money needed to save it. He travels to the big city and meets a number of characters who are obsessed with religion, money, or both. This movie manages to show devotion, delusion and hypocrisy with clarity and, yes, grace, while providing plenty of laughs. Blessed are the meek, for they get off easy in this one; the greedy and vicious are not so lucky. Andy Kaufman's performance as Armageddon T. Thunderbird is brilliant, chilling, and not to be missed.
