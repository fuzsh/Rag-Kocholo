        "text": "The ACT exam is a national college entrance exam published by American College Testing. The ACT is America’s most widely accepted college entrance exam. It assesses high school students’ general educational development and their ability to complete college-level work. The multiple-choice tests cover four skill areas: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science. A 30-minute essay at the end is optional.\n\nMarty Feldman recommends that a junior take at least 2-3 ACTs in 11th grade: The December test is helpful for many students, or April if that’s too soon for you. February is good because it yields an early diagnosis and also may boost the March SAT. Definitely take JUNE for your best score. Another test in September of 12th grade is useful for some students. Check out the ACT website for more details.\n\nMarty Feldman uses a semi-private\n\ntutoring method whereby the students are taught strategies as they complete timed test sections of real PSATs, SATs and ACTs. Please check our schedule to view the time, dates and location of the classes offered.\n\nAfter paying $795 for a group course, return for any course for just $395. Private tutoring students also receive a discount on group coursework.\n\nSAT students get ACT discount!\n\nClick on the links below for ACT information:"
