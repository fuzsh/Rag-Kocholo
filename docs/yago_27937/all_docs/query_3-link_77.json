        "text": "Marty Feldman is being celebrated in 2016 in a new West End show called Jeepers Creepers, which is directed by Monty Python's Terry Jones. This review of a biography of the comedian, who had a mild, wild life, was first published in November 2011.\n\nThose bulging egg eyes helped make Marty Feldman a comedy megastar but he was always quite deadpan about his looks. After being cast in Gene Wilder's award-winning 1974 film Young Frankenstein, Feldman said: \"I am the only guy ever to appear in a horror film without make-up.\"\n\nThe \"freaky\" appearance, as he described his face, belied an intelligent, inquisitive mind and a nature drawn to, and inspiring of, mayhem. The most enjoyable sections in Robert Ross's fine 2011 biography of the actor are about the days before Feldman made it as a Hollywood star.\n\nBorn in London's Canning Town, to Jewish emigrants from Kiev (who changed their surname), Feldman had a hunger for rebellion. He was repeatedly thrown out of schools – \"my whole outlook was 'ya-boo-sucks'\" he said – and left home in his early teens, nourishing a hatred for the 1950s English ethos of \"cold showers and mathematics\".\n\nFeldman believed there was something deeply unappealing about the uptight, respectable Englishman, saying once: \"The British produced a great number of passionless mass murderers. . . little bank clerks, the neighbourhood doctor. They all have the sort of bald, bony heads and wear pebble dash lenses and raincoats.\"\n\nFeldman said he had consciously chosen to be a misfit because it was \"more interesting\". In his late teens he drifted around Soho – and Paris – indulging in a life of petty crime and getting his kicks on Benzedrine and heroin.\n\nYet he was ambitious, drawn to writing and performing. After working at a fairground, he found regular employment as part of a travelling nude revue show called Saucy Girls. The girls were supposed to stand absolutely still, to avoid titillating audiences, and it amused him when he overheard the advice from a seedy theatre manager to a girl if she was spotted by an official from the Watch Committee moving her nipples. \"Tell 'em the rostrum's rickety.\"\n\nThe life of \"putrid\" regional theatres and crummy B&Bs is brought wonderfully to life by Ross. One landlady once brought Feldman and his troupe their vegetables in a chamber pot. The book is well-researched and there are lots of new interviews, and excerpts from exisiting ones including with Feldman's long-term writing partner, the late Barry Took.\n\nIn the 1960s, Feldman's imagination brought him success – with shows such as The Army Game, Bootsie and Snudge and Round The Horne. He certainly had a gift for offbeat ideas and language. Describing one acquaintance, Feldman wrote: \"If Orson Welles were dying of cancer and bought himself a fright wig, he would have looked like this man.\" It was Feldman who co-wrote the Four Yorkshire Men skit so associated with Monty Python. The Pythons were fans and it is Terry Jones who is directing a tribute stage show to Feldman called Jeepers Creepers. Jones described Feldman as \"a very, very funny man\".\n\nFeldman always desperately wanted to perform and this meant, ultimately, exploiting the look of his eyes, which he said were \"the product of a thyroid condition caused by an accident when somebody stuck a pencil in my eye when I was a boy\".\n\nA move to America, and the success of Young Frankenstein, made him a world star but he was never really happy in Beverley Hills. He hated the gaudy rich and was most at ease when playing football with a group of Italian waiters he had befriended.\n\nFeldman remained a football fanatic throughout his life. He once had a character in a sketch called Reginald Sweet who worked for the Football Association, purely so he could answer the phone and say: \"Hello, Sweet FA.\"\n\nFeldman treasured a prized shirt once worn by his Chelsea hero Charlie Cooke. It tickled him that when he took his wife Lauretta to see Chelsea, she commented: \"What pretty costumes they've got on.\"\n\nAlthough wild, he was oddly principled about some matters. He appeared at the Oz trial – daring to ask the Judge: \"Am I waking you up?\" – and wasn't afraid to offend Frank Sinatra even when he had gone to hear him sing. Feldman was announced as part of the audience at a concert but declined a request to meet the famous singer, saying, \"I don't like his politics.\"\n\nFeldman was not principled about his sex life, though, being repeatedly unfaithful to his Lauretta, his wife for 23 years. He claimed he had been in love 500 times and joked that \"success has gone to my crotch\".\n\nThe years after Young Frankenstein are a tale of painful decline. His brave film In God We Tru$t, which exposed organised religion and greedy evangelist preachers, bombed. His name was toxic at the box office. He became depressed, took even more drugs and allegedly attempted suicide. There were conflicting stories about his death, at the age of 48, in Mexico City in December 1982. A fall on set, food poisoning and drugs were variously blamed for contributing to the massive heart attack that killed him.\n\nJazz was the other real love of his life. Although he described himself as \"the world's worst trumpet player\", he adored playing in bands, including the first that saxophone player Tubby Hayes ever joined.\n\nFeldman's life, incidentally, offers a object lesson in the maxim that you should not meet your heroes. \"I met Groucho Marx and all he did was talk about his bowels,\" said the comedian.\n\nFeldman fared no better with jazz giant Charlie Parker, whom he met in Paris. \"All he did was talk about snooker. I was so pissed off,\" Feldman said.\n\nHis funeral was fitting. A jazz band played I Can't Give You Anything But Love as he was buried in Los Angelese near Buster Keaton, the comedian he revered above all others.\n\nFeldman's life is an engrossing, tragi-comic story. He was a manic depressive, an addictive personality embroiled in many, many strange adventures. On his 21st birthday, for example, he was beaten up in Cardiff by a Scottish dwarf.\n\nFilm director Mel Brooks described him as \"the most complicated human being I have ever met\" and Ross's thorough biography brings you up close to the strangeness."
