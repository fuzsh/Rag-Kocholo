        "text": "l watched this film when I was younger and after watching lots of times over the years it still makes me belly laugh!\n\nIt's always good to see the late Marty Feldman, whose has a comical face and is just perfect for this film.Teri Garr is at her best and looks very pretty. With the great talents of Gene Wilder, Madeline Kahn, Gene Hickman, Peter Boyle, and Cloris Leachman playing alongside, it makes a memorable movie with a lot of memorable scenes, with a lot of memorable people.\n\nLooking at the Frankenstein \"monster\" in a tuxedo, sitting up in bed, I think the actual description “monster” is disappointing . I know that it was meant to be a funny Frankenstein but I just did not like the look of it at all. But I LOVED the dance that he did . I basically loved everything he did and have watched the film over and over again and still find many scenes hilarious.\n\nKudos also for Mel Brooks, having the good sense to film this in black-and- white. It may have been his best film, although \" The Muppets Movie \" would definitely give it a run for its money in my opinion . My only complaint was Wilder's constant shouting does become annoying and can give you a headache after awhile! Still, this has to be one of the best \"comedy classics\" ever !!!!!!!!!! This film will stick with me for the rest of my life and be a firm favourite. 4/5 !!!!!!\n\nPrint this review"
