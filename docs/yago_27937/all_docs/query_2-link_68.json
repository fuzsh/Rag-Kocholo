        "text": "For example, those of us of a certain age were weaned on the likes of Mike “And this is me” Yarwood, Dick Emery and Arthur Haynes; names that mean little or nothing to the digital generation. To that list I fear we may add that of Marty Feldman.\n\nPaul Merton has done his bit for Haynes and now with his book, Marty Feldman: The Biography of a Comedy Legend, Robert Ross has gone some way to redressing the balance for Feldman.\n\nThroughout the Sixties and Seventies Marty was a mainstay of mainstream telly but somehow slightly separate from it. Despite a warm screen presence, Marty’s shows were never what you might call cosy. The eponymous series Marty may have enjoyed a prime-time slot but he was never really Mr Saturday Night: he was far too much of an iconoclast for that. Remember, with his comedy writing partner Barry Took, this was the man responsible for Julian and Sandy on radio’s Round The Horne.\n\nMarty Feldman is, as John Cleese says, “a true cultural icon”\n\nThis was also a man whose career spanned music hall as part of an act called Morris, Marty and Mitch, through the golden age of TV to eventual movie success (of a sort).\n\nThere was also the issue of his physical appearance. He never looked like a slick middle-of-the-road entertainer. According to Marty, he started life as a mop-headed cherub, “a sort of Gothic Shirley Temple”, but along with a squint, an unsuccessful thyroid treatment for Graves’s disease left him with his trademark poached-egg eyes. The effect was supposed to be temporary. “The doctor said they would pop back. I’m still waiting,” he said a decade after the event.\n\nIt was all grist to his comedy mill. With his googly eyes, Harpo Marx hair and bent nose Bill Oddie said Marty was a “clown in kit form”.\n\nMarty was painfully aware of his looks. “I’ve always been treated as a freak anyway and in a sense I am,” he once said. “I’ve always felt like an alien who never belonged anywhere, just a temporary member of the human race.”\n\nIt’s a mindset that could have taken him in one of two directions: a life of birds, booze, drugs and crime or one of fame and fortune. For Marty, like his eyes, it went both ways: his early life was a catalogue of misery, his later life a litany of triumphs.\n\nAccounts of Marty’s early life are equally skewed. He was born Martin Alan Feldman in Canning Town in 1934. He claimed his parents were always “slipping out of digs because they couldn’t pay the rent” but at some point they had enough money to send him to boarding school, the first of 13 educational institutions he attended.\n\nA bright but inattentive pupil, no school could hold him. Feeling alienated, he found solace in jazz, lured siren-like to a bohemian existence in Soho.\n\nFrequent rows with his parents resulted in his leaving home at 15. “I couldn’t live my parents’ life and they couldn’t countenance my life because it involved all kinds of disreputable carryings-on.”\n\nF or a time he lived on the streets of London, sleeping rough in Green Park, before embarking on a series of dead-end jobs. From busking on the streets of Paris to a short season at Dreamland in Margate, Marty’s life was heading nowhere. There were two choices: crime or show business. He tried both.\n\nFortunately for the latter, Marty was no good at the former. “I was a failed criminal,” he said. “I couldn’t beat anybody up, I couldn’t even beat anybody down.” He was a getaway driver who worried because he didn’t have a licence!\n\nSo, showbusiness it was. It was while performing on the halls that he met a trumpet player named Barry Took. They formed both a friendship and a partnership, eventually writing The Army Game, Bootsie and Snudge and On The Braden Beat before reaching new heights of delirium with Round The Horne.\n\nThe BBC in the Sixties was a very exciting place to be and people like Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, Ned Sherrin and David Frost made the light entertainment department the most exciting of the lot.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Not part of the Oxbridge set, he was yet again the alien.\n\nStill primarily a writer, Marty slowly began to make a name for himself as a performer. At Last The 1948 Show led to his own series, Marty.\n\nMarty was always something of a loose cannon. Bill Oddie claims he recognised symptoms of a bipolar disorder in Marty but it led to some inspired and influential, comedy, including him as a singing Jack the Ripper (“Give me the moonlight, give me the girl and leave the rest to me”).\n\nWith Every Home Should Have One, Feldman enjoyed a brief flirtation with film (and indeed his leading lady, Julie Ege). “Success has gone to my crotch,” he told Porridge writer Ian La Frenais when he saw the two arm in arm.\n\nFor a time he went off the rails again, hitting the booze and drugs and cosying up to a few more women. “Lauretta [Marty’s wife] was long suffering beyond belief,” recalls Oddie.\n\nBy the mid-Seventies Marty was commuting between Britain and America and it was in New Mexico that he died in 1982 while making the film Yellowbeard. He was 48.\n\nSuccess in films within the Mel Brooks/Gene Wilder stable, most notably as Igor in Young Frankenstein, had made Marty something of a movie star in Hollywood.\n\nHe ended up writing, directing and starring in his own movies, none of them a success. Hollywood then did what it does best: it dropped him like a stone.\n\nHowever, as a catalyst for the likes of The Goodies and Monty Python, and co-author of Round The Horne, Marty Feldman is best celebrated for his contribution to Britcom. He was, as John Cleese says, “a true cultural icon”.\n\nMarty Feldman: The Biography of a Comedy Legend by Robert Ross is published by Titan Books at £18.99.
