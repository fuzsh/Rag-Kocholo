        "text": "Martin Alan Feldman (8 July 1934 – 2 December 1982) was an English comedian and BAFTA award winning actor who began his career as a comedy writer. He was known for his bulging eyes.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nComedy, like sodomy, is an unnatural act.\n\nThe Times (9 June 1969).\n\nSex is two plus two making five, rather than four. Sex is the X ingredient that you can't define, and it's that X ingredient between two people that make both a man and a woman good in bed. It's all relative. There are no rules.\n\nInterview in Speaking Frankly by Wendy Leigh (London: Muller, 1978).\n\nI was about five and a half or six when I converted [to vegetarianism] … I was brought up the first five years of my life in London, in the working-class part of the city, where the only animals that a child is liable to see are domestic animals, or cats, or pigeons, or horses, none of which one eats. Then I was evacuated onto a farm when the war came, and billeted with this family of farmers, and I got very friendly with a rabbit—George, the rabbit. Then one day, George the rabbit was George the lunch. For a farming family there was nothing obscene about that. They kill animals; they serve them up at table and say, \"Hey, yes, that's the animal you were playing with yesterday!\"—which is not abnormal. It was obscene to me as a child.\n\nInterview in The Vegetarians by Rynn Berry (Brookline, MA: Autumn Press, 1979), p. 30.\n\nHookers have to deliver on their promise... unlike politicians.\n\nMarty Feldman - Six Degrees of Separation, BBC4.\n\nI feel about Keaton the way an organist thinks of Bach.\n\nMarty Feldman - Six Degrees of Separation, BBC4.\n\nI carry Keaton's photo around with me to remind me what happened to him. If the Hollywood system can destroy him it can destroy me.\n\nMarty Feldman - Six Degrees of Separation, BBC4.\n\nWhen I quoted Bulwer Lytton's \"The pen is mightier than the sword\" to Marty Feldman he added reflectively, \"Yes, and considerably easier to write with.\"\n\nKenneth Williams Acid Drops (London: Orion, [1980] 1999) p. xvi.\n\nI won't eat anything that has intelligent life, but I'd gladly eat a network executive or a politician.\n\nAs quoted in He Who Laughs Lasts by Shawn Lovley, p. 51.\n\nMisattributed\n\n[edit]\n\nMoney can't buy poverty.\n\nBy J. Paul Getty [1]\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
