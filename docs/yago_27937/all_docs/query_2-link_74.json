I hope this helps\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nGARRON STEVENS\n\nNetwork On Air.\"\n\nMark Evanier has posted on the show, most recently in one which notes \"For some time now, we've heard that the original uncut episodes were going to be released as a DVD set in the U.K. but I don't believe that's happened.\" www.newsfromme.com/\n\nToo right.\n\nMore on his understanding of the etiology of the show here: www.newsfromme.com/2012/11/01/todays-video-link-720/\n\nThanks to the first Youtube link, I've now seen Groucho Marx in a sketch with Frances de la Tour. Come to think of it, Leonard Rossiter would have made quite a good Groucho...\n\nPost by John Green on\n\nSeems the Youtube uploader has cut the has cut the musical spots from the Eng.-lang. uploads, left them in for the German-dubbed ones.\n\ne.g. \"What a find for COLOSSEUM fans! Two songs, both played live: A short \"Tanglewood '63\" (04:40) and a very rare \"Upon Tomorrow\" (36:00) which as far as I know was never released on an album til the 6-CD-Box Transmissions: Live At The BBC came out in 2020, with a version of this song from the BBC Radio 1 show SOUNDS OF THE 70s on September 10th, 1971, shortly before the first split of the band. \"Upon Tomorrow\" is perhaps the most extreme example of Chris Farlowe's virtuosity and range. What a joy to see my favorite band on the same show as the great Orson Welles!\"."
