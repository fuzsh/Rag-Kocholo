Even if it only lasts an hour and forty-six minutes. And nothing puts a larger smile on my face quite like Mel Brooks’ classic horror-parody, Young Frankenstein. I watched this movie with my family on a skit trip when I was eight years old, not knowing what I was getting into...\n\nThis was my introduction to the Mel Brooks Cinematic Universe, one that can put both DC and Marvel to shame. It stuck with me ever since. My entire family laughed and the kids laughed along too. It became a classic in the O’Keefe household and we ended up having it on DVD (a DVD which I stole when I moved to Los Angeles). It’s a film I watched on long road trips, sleepovers and when I didn’t have wifi for two days. Like most of my over and overs, I watch this movie when I need a laugh and I want to be comforted. Nothing gets me quite like Gene Wilder’s wild antics, Marty Feldman’s excellent comedic timing, Cloris Leachman’s accent, Peter Boyle’s gruffness, Teri Garr’s bubbliness and Madeline Kahn’s fabulousness. It all works together in a great homage to horror classics of the 1940’s without overdoing any of the comedy or taking itself too seriously.\n\n*QUICK PLOT DESCRIPTION* Gene Wilder plays the grandson of the late famous (and crazy) Victor Frankenstein. After Victor’s death, Frederick (Wilder) travels to Transylvania where he realizes his grandfather might not have been as insane as people thought and tries to finish his work of reanimating dead bodies. Along with the help of Igor (Feldman) and Inga (Garr), his laboratory assistants, they bring back a volatile and hilarious (tap-dancing) monster to life that wreaks havoc amongst the townspeople. This movie has become so ingrained in my system that it’s hard for me not to repeat all of the lines as the movie plays. Brooks doesn’t treat the audience like they are idiots and most of the humor may be goofy but it’s also dry and smart with witty dialogue that has become gold over time. On a personal note, Marty Feldman’s Igor (EYE-GORE) is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. His timing and movement is impeccable and his craziness (along with his unusual appearance due to a car accident in his thirties) makes him the one to watch for me. Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder even stated in the DVD commentary that Feldman was “the heart” of this film. And that’s all the validation I need.\n\nThis movie can make anyone smile, and it made me discover the hilarity and joy of Mel Brooks films. With the way the world is at this moment, a little escapism and distraction can be good for the mind every now and then. So come on over to my place and watch this film with me, but don’t leave too early cause I’m gonna make espressoooo…"
