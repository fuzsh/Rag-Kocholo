        "text": "I was flipping channels and caught the end of the Get Smart movie starring Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway, and while it was mildly entertaining, I couldn’t help think how it paled in comparison to the brilliantly written series.\n\nOf course, I can watch that whenever I want – a majestic box set.\n\nAnd it made me miss Mel Brooks. Yes, I know he’s alive, and a spry 85 at that (pickles are nutritious, you know). But Woody Allen keeps spitting out films at a rapid pace, occasionally hitting the high marks again. But he’s long since given up zany comedy. Most of today’s comedy films are so broad and cliché that they quickly fade from memory. But the world of today is a crazy, insane place. We need crazy, insane comedy.\n\nWe need Mel Brooks now more than ever. I know he has lost so many of his reliable company; Harvey Korman, Marty Feldman, Dom DeLuise, Rudy DeLuca, Madeline Kahn, Ron Carey and Kenneth Mars have all left this mortal coil.\n\nBut as Mel himself would say, “we have much to do and less time to do it in.”\n\nHappy Birthday, Mel! Now get busy…\n\nLost another great one last night at 75 years young. Most famous for his film associations (and friendships) with Mel Brooks and Burt Reynolds some people amazingly only know Dom Deluise as a chef, despite decades of success as a TV and movie actor. Old school fans remember his breakthrough appearances on The Dean Martin Show.\n\nHe was never the most famous, and many of the movies he made are long forgotten, but he was a very funny actor and a loyal friend who was beloved by all who knew him. I’m sure there’s a big hole in a lot of hearts today.\n\nRest in peace, Dom Deluise.\n\n“Wronnnnnnnnnnng!” Dom Deluise steals the end of the show in Blazing Saddles!\n\nDominick The Great – the world’s most inept magician – on the Dean Martin Show.\n\nA descendant of the greats of the silent era like Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd, Dom was pretty good at it himself, like in this clip Out Of Order.\n\nHis job in Burt Reynolds movies like Cannonball Run seemed to be twofold- act nuts, and crack Burt up.\n\nAs a gluttonous Ceasar in Mel’s History of the World Part One.\n\nAnd of course, Silent Movie with Mel and the great Marty Feldman."
