        "text": "MEXICO CITY -- Marty Feldman, the madcap comic of the distinctive bug-eyes, prodigious nose and frazzled red hair, died of a heart attack just after completing work in his latest film, it was announced Friday. He was 49.\n\nFeldman, who made his 1974 American movie debut in Mel Brooks' 'Young Frankenstein' after building a cult following in Europe, died in his hotel room Thursday night.\n\n'He died last night immediately upon completion of his role in a movie called 'Yellowbeard,'' his manager, Michael Maslansky, said in Los Angeles\n\nMaslansky said paramedics and doctors were summoned to Feldman's room, but he 'expired after all efforts were used to revive him. He died of a massive heart attack.'\n\nMaslansky said Feldman's body would be flown out of Mexico City Friday night and private services were tentatively scheduled in Los Angeles, where Feldman owned a home in the Hollywood Hills, for Monday.\n\nFeldman, an established writer and director as well as comedian whose trademark was his bulging eyes that seemingly rolled about uncontrollably, once said his distinctive face 'is me, the sum total of the disasters of my life.'\n\n'My nose is testimony to the fact that I was a poor fighter. My eyes are the product of a thyroid condition from an accident. The scar on my forehead proves I'm a very bad cricket player.\n\n'Physically, I am basically equipped to be a clown.'\n\nBorn in London July 8, 1933 of Polish-Russian parents, Feldman started his career in school theatricals. He left school at age 15 to form his own jazz group in Paris and later worked as an assistant to an Indian fakir whose act featured flying tom-toms, arrows and clubs.\n\nTogether with two other young men, Feldman toured the British provinces in 1952 and 1953 with a comedy act that made a splash when it premiered on British television the next year.\n\nFeldman spent the next ten years mainly behind the scenes writing for a number of highly popular British television and radio shows. He appeared in front of the camera for the first time in the late 1960s in David Frost's 'At Last the 1948 Show,' which led to his own top-rated series 'Marty.'\n\nAfter moving into motion pictures, following a career in a number of British TV shows that made him a cult figure throughout Europe, Feldman made his American screen debut in Brooks' 'Young Frankenstein' in 1974.\n\nA number of collaborations with the madcap Brooks followed, including 'High Anxiety' and 'Silent Movie.'\n\nIn 1977, he made his debut as a writer-director in 'The Last Remake of Beau Geste,' and followed that with another multi-faceted effort in 'In God We Trust.'\n\nFeldman is survived by his wife, Lauretta, 46, who he married in 1959, and his mother Cissy, 70."
