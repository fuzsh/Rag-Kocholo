(1914–99). American professional baseball player Joe DiMaggio was one of the greatest hitters and center fielders in major league baseball.

Joseph Paul DiMaggio was born on November 25, 1914, in Martinez, California. He was the son of Italian immigrants who made their living by fishing. He quit school at 14 and at 17 joined his brother Vincent and began playing baseball with the minor league San Francisco Seals. (In addition to Vincent, who would go on to play for several major league teams, including the Pittsburgh Pirates, a younger DiMaggio brother, Dominic, played for the Boston Red Sox.) Joe’s contract with San Francisco was purchased by the New York Yankees, and he was brought up to the major leagues in 1936.

Dimaggio, known as “Joltin’ Joe” or “the Yankee Clipper,” played for the Yankees from 1936 to 1942 and from 1946 to 1951. (He missed three seasons [1943–45] serving in the military during World War II.) During his career with the Yankees, he helped the team win nine World Series titles—in 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1950, and 1951. He led the American League (AL) in batting in 1939 and 1940, with averages of .381 and .352. His consistency as a hitter led to one of the most remarkable records of major league baseball—DiMaggio’s feat of hitting safely in 56 consecutive games (May 15–July 16, 1941). The prior record for the longest hitting streak of 44 games was set in 1897 (and, at that time, foul balls did not count as strikes). With the exception of DiMaggio’s streak, no player has hit in more than 44 consecutive games since. In addition to his fine hitting ability, DiMaggio had outstanding skill as a fielder, tying the AL fielding record in 1947 with only one error in 141 games.

DiMaggio was chosen as AL most valuable player three times, in 1939, 1941, and 1947, and retired with 361 home runs and a lifetime batting average of .325. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.
