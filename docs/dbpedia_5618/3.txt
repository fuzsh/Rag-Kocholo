Joe DiMaggio (1914 - 1999), often hailed as one of the greatest baseball players of all time, left an indelible mark on the sport and American culture. Born in Martinez, California, DiMaggio's talent was apparent from a young age. He rose to prominence as a center fielder for the New York Yankees during the 1930s and 1940s, earning the nickname "The Yankee Clipper" for his graceful play.

DiMaggio's career boasts a multitude of accolades, including thirteen All-Star selections, nine World Series championships, and three MVP awards. However, his most enduring legacy may be his record-setting 56-game hitting streak in 1941, a feat that remains unmatched in Major League Baseball.

Off the field, DiMaggio is most famously remembered for his marriage to one of Hollywood's most famous actresses, Marilyn Monroe. The couple married in 1954 but divorced just nine months later. When they were together, the pair would enjoy intimate dinners together at the Steer in DiMaggio's private booth - Booth 26.

Both DiMaggio and Monroe were regulars at the Steer. After their marriage ended, Monroe secured her own booth directly in front of his - Booth 29 - and would come to enjoy a ribeye steak and glass of champagne on her own and as one of the "Rat Pack Mascots". It is rumored that once Monroe began to frequent the Steer more often, DiMaggio relocated to Booth 3, where he enjoyed dining on his favorite meal - a Filet Mignon with a side of spaghetti marinara.

Though DiMaggio passed away in 1999, his impact on baseball and popular culture continues to be felt, ensuring that his legacy endures for generations to come. To celebrate his life, legacy, and patronage to the Steer, we've dedicated Booth 3 to his memory.
