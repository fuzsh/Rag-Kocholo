        "text": "Joe DiMaggio is, till date, widely regarded as one of the most popular basketball players of all time. He was an iconic figure, who enthralled baseball lovers and created history with his 56-game hitting streak. The New York Times reported this particular achievement as ‘perhaps the most enduring record in sports’. Known for his reserved nature, DiMaggio was devoted to the sport and played with commitment, refinement and dignity. He began his Major League career with the New York Yankees and played a pivotal role in securing the World Series titles for the team nine times in the 13 big league seasons that he played with them. He epitomised the symbol of a sports hero during his years of success. His overwhelming popularity made him the face of many advertising campaigns. What’s more, he was all over the electronic media - in radio and television. He was popularly nicknamed, 'Joltin Joe' and 'The Yankee Clipper'. He married actress Marilyn Monroe and it is believed that he continued to be devoted to her even after their divorce. For his outstanding brilliance in the game, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall Of Fame. Furthermore, he was named the greatest living player in a poll taken during the baseball centennial year in 1965."
