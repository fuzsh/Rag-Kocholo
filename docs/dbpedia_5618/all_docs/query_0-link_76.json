        "text": "Saturday’s World Series finale brought an end to Major League Baseball’s season. During one of the broadcasts, I heard a commentator remark that the most frequently played song at MLB stadiums this year was John Fogerty’s “Centerfield.”\n\nWhat baseball fan doesn’t love that song? It’s catchy and beautifully captures the charm of the national pastime. “Centerfield’s” opening handclaps are as iconic as peanuts, popcorn, and crackerjacks.\n\nFogerty released two solo albums after leaving Creedence Clearwater Revival. Neither of which faired particularly well. A legal battle with his record label led to his refusing to record for the next decade.\n\nWhen he finally returned to the music scene, “Centerfield” was Fogerty’s first release. He wrote the lyrics, played all the instruments, and produced the track, which now plays on continuous loop at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\n\n“When I was a little kid, there were no teams on the West Coast,” Fogerty told MLB.com. “I’d hear about (Babe) Ruth and (Joe) DiMaggio, and as my dad and older brothers talked about the Babe’s exploits, their eyes would get so big.”\n\nFogerty grew to think of center field at Yankee Stadium as being “the most hallowed place in all of the universe.”\n\nMost people interpret the song as being a cry for playing time. They envision an eager player begging his coach for a chance at glory. Put me in coach, I’m ready to play today.\n\nBut there’s another contingency who chose to interpret the song as being more symbolic of a humble player affirming his willingness to embrace whatever is asked him. Put me in coach, I’m ready to play today—and I’m willing to do whatever you need me to do.\n\nThe first player has an entitled mindset. He wants to play because he believes he’s better than the players who are playing. He wants an opportunity to prove his belief.\n\nThe second player has a servant’s mindset. He loves his team and is excited for an opportunity to contribute in any way he can.\n\nPut me in coach, I can be center field.\n\nAt higher levels, the center fielder is revered. It’s an important position. Some of the game’s greatest players—DiMaggio, Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, and Ty Cobb—played center field. As Fogerty told The New York Times, the center fielder is “the king, the head of the tribe, the most special one.”\n\nThat’s not usually the case at lower levels. Center field is far less heralded in little league. Coaches usually hide the weakest players in the outfield. The position is not seen as a glamorous assignment.\n\nThis distinction plays into the song’s interpretation. The first player wants the attention and accolades that come with playing center field—for himself. The second player is willing to accept the lack of esteem that comes with playing center field—for his team.\n\nThe second player’s motives are in keeping with an individual who aspires to be a good teammate. Putting someone with his attitude into the lineup can change the game’s flow for the better. His is an attitude worthy of being “waved home.”\n\nAs always…Good teammates care. Good teammates share. Good teammates listen. Go be a good teammate.\n\nLance Loya is the founder and CEO of the Good Teammate Factory.
