        "text": "A Joint Resolution designating August 7 of each year as Mike Trout Day.\n\nWhereas, New Jersey native Michael Nelson Trout was born on August 7, 1991, in the City of Vineland, and was raised in the City of Millville where he played shortstop as a child in the Cal Ripken Baseball division of the Babe Ruth League; and\n\nWhereas, Nicknamed the Millville Meteor, Trout graduated from Millville Senior High School in 2009, where he was a member of the basketball and baseball teams; and\n\nWhereas, At Millville Senior High School, Trout excelled in baseball, earning the attention of both college and Major League Baseball (MLB) scouts by pitching a no-hitter in his junior year and setting a New Jersey high school record with 18 home runs during his senior year; and\n\nWhereas, After turning down a scholarship to East Carolina University to pursue a career in the MLB, Trout was drafted in the first round of the 2009 MLB draft as the 25th overall pick by the Los Angeles Angels; and\n\nWhereas, Prior to his major league debut, Trout played minor league baseball for the Cedar Rapid Kernels, the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, and the Arkansas Travelers, ultimately finishing his career in minor league baseball with a batting average of .342 and an on-base percentage of .425 with 108 stolen bases; and\n\nWhereas, In 2011, Trout made his major league debut with the Los Angeles Angels and, in 2012, had one of the greatest rookie seasons of all time, winning the 2012 American League Rookie of the Year Award while finishing second in the voting for the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Year Award; and\n\nWhereas, Trouts rookie season was compared to the rookie seasons of some of the greatest baseball players of all time, including Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Shoeless Joe Jackson, and Ty Cobb, as he ranked first in runs scored with 129 runs scored, second in batting average with an average of .326, third in slugging percentage with a percentage of .564, and first in wins above replacement with 10.8; and\n\nWhereas, In addition to his offensive prowess, Trout has also been praised for his defensive abilities in center field, which is largely considered to be one of the most important defensive positions in baseball; and\n\nWhereas, Since his debut, Trout has gone on to become a three-time MVP winner, one of only 11 players to win three MVP awards, and has been selected to play in the MLBs annual All-Star Game nine times; and\n\nWhereas, Trout has also been the recipient of the Silver Slugger Award eight times, the first Major League Baseball player receive the award eight times by age twenty eight; and\n\nWhereas, Given the long list of his impressive career stats and achievements, it is no surprise that Trout is heavily favored to be a future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee; and\n\nWhereas, In July of 2021, Trout celebrated his 10th anniversary with the Los Angeles Angels, and it is fitting to honor his already outstanding career by designating August 7 of each year as Mike Trout Day in this State; now, therefore,\n\nBe It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey:\n\n1. August 7 of each year is designated as Mike Trout Day in recognition of the outstanding career of Major League Baseball center fielder and New Jersey native Mike Trout.\n\n2. The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation recognizing August 7 of each year as Mike Trout Day in New Jersey.\n\n3. This joint resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nThis joint resolution designates August 7 of each year as Mike Trout Day in recognition of the outstanding career of Major League Baseball (MLB) center fielder and New Jersey native Mike Trout. Trout was born on August 7, 1991 in Vineland, New Jersey, and grew up in neighboring Millville, New Jersey. As a child Trout played shortstop in the Cal Ripken Baseball division of the Babe Ruth League. He attended Millville Senior High School where he played basketball and baseball. Trout excelled in baseball, earning the nickname the Millville Meteor as well as the attention of both college and MLB scouts.\n\nTrout turned down a scholarship to East Carolina University to pursue a career in Major League Baseball, a move that paid off as he was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels in the first round of the 2009 MLB draft as the 25th overall pick. Trout spent some time in the minor league with the Cedar Rapids Kernels, the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, and the Arkansas Travelers, ultimately ending his minor league career with a batting average of .342 and an on-base percentage of .425 with 108 stolen bases.\n\nTrout officially made his major league debut in July 2011 and had one of the greatest rookie seasons of all time, winning the 2012 American League Rookie of the Year Award. Trouts rookie season was compared to the rookie seasons of some of the greatest baseball players of all time, including Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Shoeless Joe Jackson, and Ty Cobb. During his rookie season Trout ranked first in runs scored with 129 runs, second in batting average with an average of .326, third in slugging percentage with a percentage of .564, and first in Wins Above Replacement with 10.8.\n\nTrout has gone on to become a three-time MVP winner, and is one of only 11 players in MLB history to win three MVP awards. Additionally, he has been selected to play in the MLBs annual All-Star Game nine times, and has received eight Silver Slugger Awards, the first player to receive the award eight times at just twenty eight years old. Trouts already outstanding career is already worthy of a Hall of Fame induction, and it is largely believed that he will be a contender for the honor in the future.\n\nJuly of 2021 marks the 10th anniversary of the Major League debut of Mike Trout. Given the incredible success of his career so far, it is fitting to honor Trout by designating August 7 of each year as Mike Trout Day in this State."
