        "text": "Overshadowed by Yankee icon and brother Joe, Dominick DiMaggio was a fine player in his own right. The youngest of three brothers – Vince the oldest also played – Dom broke in with the Red Sox in 1940.\n\nHe hit .301 in his first season and was an All Star in the next two. Like many fighting-age ball players, Dom joined the war effort. He missed three seasons due to his military service.\n\nHe returned in 1946 and made the All Star team. From ’46-’52 the centerfielder made five All Star teams. Perennially among the league leaders in many offensive categories, Dom paced the AL in runs twice and once each in triples and stolen bases.\n\nFrom 1948-1950 he played for Hall of Fame manager Joe McCarthy. Under his tutelage, Dom was consistently excellent. Each of the three seasons he received votes in MVP balloting. Twice he made the All Star team.\n\nWhile playing for McCarthy, Dom posted single-season career-best marks in hits, runs, doubles, triples, RBI, batting average, and on-base percentage.\n\nIn the collection is this letter handwritten by Dom DiMaggio writes. He writes, “In my estimation Joe McCarthy was an excellent manager and has to be rated with the best ever. Beyond that what else is there left to say?”.\n\nBelow that, DiMaggio pens his flowing and unmistakable signature.\n\nSeven-time All Star Dom DiMaggio performed well against the best the NL had to offer. Overall in All Star play he went 6-for-17 (.353) with two doubles, a walk, two runs scored and two RBI.\n\nDiMaggio’s finest showing came in the 1949 contest. Baseball’s first integrated Mid Summer Classic, it featured the Indians Larry Doby and the Dodgers Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, and Don Newcombe.\n\nDom went 2-for-5 with double, two runs scored, and an RBI in the AL’s 11-7 triumph. A happy affair for the DiMaggio family saw brother Joe go 2-for-5 with a run and three RBI.\n\nShown here is a 14-karat gold wristwatch. Given to American League president William Harridge in Brooklyn on July 12, 1949, it commemorates the historic All Star Game. Harridge is largely responsible for the creation of annual exhibition in 1933.\n\nJoe DiMaggio is a Hall of Famer, a Yankee legend, and a baseball icon. He also had two brothers talented enough to join him in the Major Leagues.\n\nThe oldest DiMaggio big leaguer is Vince. Born in 1912 the two-time All Star served a decade in the bigs. Two years Vince’s junior, Joe is a nine-time World Series champion. Youngest brother Dom is a seven-time All Star who received MVP consideration in six seasons.\n\nShown here is a correspondence between Dom and Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson. In 1977 Robinson mailed current and former stars of the game requesting their consent to lend their name to the Babe Ruth Foundation Advisory Board.\n\nDom responds favorably as he writes, “Count me in. I think this will do a world of good for our youth. Brooks, keep up the good work!”\n\nDiMaggio’s flowing signature is then below.\n\nThree DiMaggio brothers played Major League baseball, Dom, Joe, and Vince. Each carved his own distinct identity and legacy. By far the most famous of the brothers is Hall of Fame outfielder Joe DiMaggio.\n\nThe Yankee Clipper was a four-year veteran of the Pacific Coast League when Ed Barrow came calling on behalf of the Yankees. DiMaggio was playing for his hometown San Francisco Seals, coming off a 1935 season in which he hit .398. It would take a lot to persuade the young DiMaggio to leave a seemingly perfect situation.\n\nBarrow swaggered in with a $25,000 contract offer and the rest is history. DiMaggio’s calm presence and outstanding play ensured another successful era as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig wound down their careers.\n\nJoe’s MLB career spanned from 1936-1951. He missed three full years because of World War II. An All Star in each of his 13 years in the bigs, Joe played in 10 World Series and came away with nine rings.\n\nIn this photo, Joe smiles and shakes hands with Yankee owner Jacob Ruppert. DiMaggio has signed this boldly across his chest."
