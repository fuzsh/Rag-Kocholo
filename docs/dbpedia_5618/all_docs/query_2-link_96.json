        "text": "Since emerging as the New York Yankees’ starting shortstop at the beginning of last season, Anthony Volpe has been in the spotlight. The 23-year-old has been compared to Derek Jeter, the last great captain of the Bronx Bombers.\n\nAs the games tick by and the more experience he gains, Volpe is getting closer to some historical names within the New York organization and baseball itself. With a streak of 20 consecutive games getting at least one hit, Volpe is just two games shy of tying the mark set by Joe DiMaggio for Yankees players 23 years old or younger. DiMaggio, one of Major League Baseball’s most iconic legends, had two notable hitting streaks in 1937: one of 22 games and another of 21. Volpe, with his impressive performance, is on pace to match and possibly surpass one of these historic feats.\n\nVolpe’s Streak\n\nSince May 7, 2024, Volpe has shown impressive consistency at bat. In each of the last 20 games, he has managed to get at least one hit, standing out not only for his skill, but also for his tenacity and focus. The young shortstop is batting .285 with an OPS of .790, has hit six home runs, driven in 23 runs and stolen 11 bases in the 2024 season. His performance is a sign of his potential and the promise he brings with him for the future of the Yankees.\n\nJoe DiMaggio, the Yankee Clipper, is a name that evokes greatness. His achievements are legendary, including his 56-game hit streak, the longest in major league history. However, within the context of the Yankees, DiMaggio also had two notable hitting streaks at age 22: a 22-game hitting streak from June 27 to July 21, 1937, and a 21-game hitting streak from July 23 to August 12 of the same year. Volpe, with his current 20-game streak, is on the verge of tying and possibly surpassing these marks.\n\nBeating or matching a streak set by DiMaggio is a significant achievement for any player, but even more so for one as young as Volpe. This type of streak reflects not only consistency, but also the ability to maintain performance under pressure, an essential quality for any baseball star. Media and fan attention is focused on Volpe’s every at-bat, creating palpable anticipation as he approaches the 22-game mark."
