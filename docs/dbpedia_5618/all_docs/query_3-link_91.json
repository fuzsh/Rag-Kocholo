        "text": "Joe DiMaggio\n\nJoe DiMaggio was one of the best baseball players of all time. He set many records, including the longest wining streak in Major League Baseball history, it lasted 56 games. He came to America as the son of poor Italian immigrants, but grew up to be an American Icon.\n\nJoseph Paul DiMaggio was born on November 25, 1914.
