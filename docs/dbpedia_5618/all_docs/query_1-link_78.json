        "text": "Hello SDS,\n\nI may have missed it, but, I can't remember ever seeing a Joe DiMaggio card, or program. The same with Sandy Koufax. True, Sandy Koufax didn't pitch that many years, but, when he did... he was one of the most dominant left handed SP the game has seen!\n\nI see there is a Minnie Minoso card, but no Joe D? Where's the logic there? I hope you can at least come up with a 42 card or something better. Hopefully a 95 Diamond would be great. Even the \"greatest hitter\" (Ted Williams) said that Joe D was a better hitter than Willie Mays. He said that Mays has more power, but Joe was the better all around hitter.\n\nHow about a 90+ Diamond Milestone Card to commemorate the 56 game hitting streak? That would be pretty cool!\n\nA side note: The Field Of Dreams Program and stadium are awesome! Great job SDS!\n\nShoeless Joe: most likely correct.\n\n\"steroid era villains\": most likely false.\n\nNelson Cruz has his own player program. Which I don't think MLB would allow if there were an actual ban.\n\nMore likely, those guys came of age during the social network era and thus know the value of NIL. They're not going to be so willing to sign away their rights without a big, giant payday.\n\nShoeless Joe: most likely correct.\n\n\"steroid era villains\": most likely false.\n\nNelson Cruz has his own player program.

Minnie never played on the same team as Joe, and I'm not even sure that their MLB careers even overlapped. Minnie is a legit legend, and it feels a bit dismissive to say \"We've got this guy, but why no Joe D\" unless there's a clear connection between the two. If you want to be dismissive of one of the MLBTS \"legends,\" there's always Jason Bay.\n\nWhy did you single out Minnie Minoso?

More people remember Jolting Joe DiMaggio than Minnie Minoso!\n\nTo all the others that thought I was talking about Shoeless Joe?\n\nShoeless Joe Jackson & The Yankee Clipper Joe DiMaggio... two different players. Two different eras.\n\nHey Poksey - brush up on your baseball history - DiMaggio is more of a legend than Minoso. How many World Series was Minoso in? He played in the 1947 World Series, and never made it in the Hall Of Fame. DiMaggio helped the Yankees win the World Series in 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1950, and 1951. So, in the future, get your S**t straight before you take me on.\n\nI see there is a Milestone Card for a player with a 30 game hitting streak. Why not a Milestone Card for DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak? That record has stood since 1941! My point is the lack of F**king logic going into the creation of these cards!\n\nFinally - it's not about who played on the same F**king team or not! It's not about the same era or not! The reason for my post was the fact that there are no player cards or programs for DiMaggio or Sandy Koufax. Both are Hall of Famers!
