        "text": "About Joe DiMaggio\n\nI image almost every baseball fan is familiar with the name Joe DiMaggio. He is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time playing for at the time one of the greatest baseball teams, the New York Yankees. There is nothing much I can add to all of his stats. I have also painted DiMaggio a number of times but thought it would be fun to try and do a simple, small drawing of him. This ink drawing of Joe DiMaggio by sports artist John Robertson is 11 inches by 14 inches on\n\nwatercolor paper. Actually the paper is a little bit bigger by one in high to 15 inches. The watercolor paper I drew Joe on is in a spiral watercolor paper binder so when it is torn out it can be trimmed down to the standard frame size of a 11” x 14” size.\n\nInteresting Info about Joe DiMaggio\n\nIt seems the only way one generation (who have not followed baseball) of people know Joe DiMaggio is that he was a spokesman for the brand Mr. Coffee. The older baseball crowd knows him by his nickname “Joltin’ Joe” or “The Yankee Clipper.” He was called by his many fans “Joltin’ Joe“because he was such a strong, hard hitter. And others called him “The Yankee Clipper” because he sailed so gracefully through the outfield when making a catch in the wide center field of Yankee stadium. And one of the big reasons people knew him was that he was one time married to Marilyn Monroe. He was immortalized in the Paul Simon song, ‘Mrs. Robinson” with the line, “Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio / Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you” - meaning where has our heroes gone, where has the innocence of our youth gone and where are the days of the past as times have changes dramatically (this song was written in the sixties) and they are not coming back. That’s a bit sobering.\n\nJoe DiMaggio retired from baseball just as I was getting interested in the game. 1951. I was young and listened to the Yankees games on the radio – the LA Dodgers were still in Brooklyn and did not come to L A for another six years. So I was a Yankees fan and saw DiMaggio as a hero. Heroes diminish and I lost some of my interest in baseball until the Dodgers showed up in LA.\n\nFinal Thoughts about Joe DiMaggio\n\nHe was always being quoted and there are plenty around to draw from but I think the most interesting one must have been from when DiMaggio spoke about his days of his own innocence when he first started playing baseball. He said, \"I can remember a reporter asking me for a quote, and I didn't know what a quote was. I thought it was some kind of soft drink.\"\n\nBaseball Art: Joe DiMaggio Painting Portrait\n\nBaseball painting portrait of Joe DiMaggio is 50\" x 70\" acrylic on unstretched canvas by sports artist John Robertson\n\nAs a boy and like so many others I thought Joe DiMaggio was the baseball player to follow and worship. We did not have a major league team in Los Angeles at the time so the Yankees were the team we followed. (What? No TV? Nope. Not then. This was 1948-1951) Joe was nicknamed \"Joltin' Joe\" and \"The Yankee Clipper\" and was what we all wanted to grow up to be - American Major League Baseball center fielder for the Yankees. Dreams. Boyhood dreams.\n\nKevin Costner about Joe DiMaggio\n\nEven adults thought that Joe DiMaggio was something special. Kevin Costner, who made that great baseball movie, “Field of Dreams” said about Joe DiMaggio, “There are certain people’s names that are reminders of what men can be like. To this day, when I hear the name Joe DiMaggio, it is so much more than a man’s name. It reminds me to play whatever game I’m in with more grace and pride and dignity…He is a man who speaks to us about how to walk through life and how to receive the admiration only the famous can know…and about how to wear defeat and disappointment as if it were just a passing storm. Men like Joe DiMaggio are not just of their own time. They are men for the ages.”\n\nI remember in 1952 collecting Topps Baseball Cards – buying packs and packs of gum to get that Topps, Joe DiMaggio 1952 card. So I gathered about one-hundred-and-seventy-five cards before discovering that he retired before the production of the 1952 cards were printed. (I still have the 1952 Topps cards I collected as a boy. And no they are not in good condition. Who knew then. I glued the cards into a paper scrapbook so on the back of the cards there are these great hunks of Elmer’s Rubber Cement and bits of paper attached to the cards.)\n\nFor me this is where Joe DiMaggio went\n\nI continued to follow the Yankees until the Brooklyn Dodgers moved to Los Angeles for the 1958 season and my allegiance changed. But, to me, baseball was never the same with DiMaggio gone from the game. I really didn’t have much thought about DiMaggio being gone or what it might have meant to me until 1967. The was the year one of my favorite movies came out, “The Graduate” a coming of age movie about a college graduate entwined in the process of adulthood, the loss of innocence, manhood, etc. And in the movie soundtrack is one of the great Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel songs, “Mrs Robinson.” The classic lines in the lyrics:\n\n”Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?\n\nA nation turns its lonely eyes to you, wo wo wo\n\nWhat’s that you say, Mrs. Robinson\n\n‘Joltin Joe’ has left and gone away, hey hey hey\n\nHey hey hey”\n\nAt that time I kicked and fought not to be an adult. I had dropped out of high school - did my stint in the Navy, tried college a number of times and struggled to find direction. Somehow the movie helped. I was not alone but “Joltin Joe’ (had) left and gone away.”\n\nJoe\" DiMaggio November 25, 1914 – March 8, 1999) played his entire 13-year career for the New York Yankees. He is perhaps best known for his 56-game hitting streak (May 15 – July 16, 1941), a record that still stands. DiMaggio was a three-time MVP winner and an All-Star in each of his 13 seasons. During his tenure with the Yankees, the club won ten American League pennants and nine World Series championships. At the time of his retirement, he ranked fifth in career home runs (361) and sixth in career slugging percentage (.579). He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955, and was voted the sport's greatest living player in a poll taken during the baseball centennial year of 1969. ---- From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nQuotes about Joe DiMaggio\n\nThis is what a couple of other great baseball players said of Joe DiMaggio:\n\n(Joe) DiMaggio was the greatest all-around player I ever saw. His career cannot be summed up in numbers and awards. It might sound corny, but he had a profound and lasting impact on the country.\" - Ted Williams\n\n\"Heroes are people who are all good with no bad in them. That's the way I always saw Joe DiMaggio. He was beyond question one of the greatest players of the century.\" - Mickey Mantle"
