        "text": "Here is some hard truth: These are the highest-ranking living ballplayers inThe Baseball 100:\n\nNo. 3: Barry Bonds\n\nNo. 13: Roger Clemens\n\nNo. 16: Alex Rodriguez\n\nNo. 20: Mike Schmidt\n\nNo. 23: Albert Pujols\n\nIt tells you a lot that four of those five players listed are not in the Hall of Fame yet—though, obviously, Pujols will go in first-ballot and maybe unanimously. If I were doing The Baseball 100 again—as a dozen or so people ask me every day!—I very well might put Pujols ahead of Schmidt and A-Rod. But, generally speaking, this still feels right to me.\n\nI have absolutely no doubt at all that Barry Bonds is the greatest living ballplayer, lowercase. No doubt. Bonds could do everything, just like Mays, just like DiMaggio. And toward the end of his career, when he bulked up, he became the most dangerous and awesome hitter this game has ever seen. If we were still looking at greatest living ballplayer the way they did in the 1940s and ’50s, when Ty Cobb was the acknowledged one, yes, absolutely, that’s Barry Bonds.\n\nBut Greatest Living Ballplayer? No. I wouldn’t give Bonds that title. I’m not saying that specifically because of the steroid business or any of the other negative stuff that surrounded Bonds. I’m saying that because whatever you want to say about DiMaggio’s ego and insistence on being recognized as the GLB, he absolutely imbued the title with royalty.\n\nThe first was Sandy Koufax. In my view, Koufax is baseball’s singular legend right now. He is the player whose very name inspires emotions, tears, smiles, nostalgia, even if you were too young to see him pitch, as I was. Sandy Koufax, unquestionably, is the player who brings out the little kid in other players. He would carry “Greatest Living Ballplayer” with grace.\n\nBut… Sandy Koufax was a pitcher. There are two problems with that. One, the title “Greatest Living Ballplayer” just seems to point to an every-day player. I’m not saying pitchers are not ballplayers. But there are plenty of hitters who would argue that way, and, anyway. I’m not sure pitchers are the first thing anyone thinks when seeing that word, “Ballplayer.” If you saw a movie titled, “Ballplayer,” would you think it was about a pitcher?\n\nTwo, I wouldn’t say that Koufax is the greatest living pitcher, lower case. That’s not a deal-breaker—I think there were greater ballplayers than DiMaggio when he was the GLB—but when you’re talking about Greg Maddux and Randy Johnson and Clemens and Pedro Martinez, not to mention Steve Carlton and Tom Glavine and Clayton Kershaw and Mariano Rivera and others, I’m just not sure that Koufax, for all his awesomeness, quite carries the day.\n\n• So, I moved on to position players, and my second thought was Carl Yastrzemski. Yaz is the oldest first-ballot position player Hall of Famer.\n\nOldest position player Hall of Famers:\n\nYaz, 84\n\nRod Carew, 78\n\nReggie Jackson, 78\n\nJohnny Bench, 76\n\nMike Schmidt, 74\n\nThe answer is Rickey.\n\nOnly… is it Rickey? I started to question myself. I mean, Rickey is… quirky. We love his quirkiness, but there’s a certain majesty to the GLB title, no? I kept going back and forth, and finally decided that “Greatest Leadoff Hitter” fits him better.\n\n• And so, that led to my fifth choice. I lingered on a bunch of players—Albert Pujols is certainly worthy, Mike Schmidt, too, George Brett… I thought a lot about Cal Ripken Jr., I even thought some about Mike Trout and Mookie Betts and Shohei Ohtani—before I finally came down to my final answer.\n\nThe Greatest Living Ballplayer—the player who pulled the sword out of the stone for me—is Ken Griffey Jr.\n\nI mean, do I think, all in all, that Griffey was greater than the players listed above? No, I don’t. He was hurt a lot and wasn’t ever really a great player after age 30. But, when Junior was right, he was as great as anyone who ever played this game. And, like DiMaggio, like Mays (like others, too, Aaron, Musial, Clemente and so on), he inspired this feeling inside us fans, this wonder, this giddiness. He was magical that way.\n\nAnd he carries himself as the GLB. Old Hall of Famers love him and the way he played. Incoming Hall of Famers idolize him. Griffey has started to be more comfortable in the public eye after years away. He’s doing commercials. He’s making appearances. He’s the best of baseball. He’s my Greatest Living Ballplayer."
