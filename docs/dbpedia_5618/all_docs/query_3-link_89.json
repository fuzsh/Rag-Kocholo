        "text": "HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- At Yankee Stadium and the White House, from Dodgertown to Cooperstown, Joe DiMaggio's friends and fans paid tribute to a man acclaimed as baseball's greatest living player.\n\nThe reign ended Monday, when DiMaggio died at home following a five-month battle with lung cancer. His legacy, however, survives.\"He became the very symbol of American grace, power and skill,\" President Clinton said. \"I have no doubt that when future generations look back at the best of America in the 20th century, they will think of the Yankee Clipper and all that he achieved.\"\n\nA funeral will be held Thursday in DiMaggio's native California, with burial to follow in the San Francisco area. Meanwhile, eulogies poured in from ballfields and beyond with remembrances of The Streak and DiMaggio's many other achievements.\n\n\"He was to people all over the world what a baseball player was supposed to be like,\" said former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. \"If you said to God, 'Create someone who was what a baseball player should be,' God would have created Joe DiMaggio. And he did.\"\n\nTo many, Joltin' Joe's death at age 84 marked the end of an era. The Yankees center fielder captivated and inspired a nation coping with the Depression and World War II, and his fame endured and even grew after retirement in 1951.\n\nHe was remembered for his elegance playing the most glamorous position in baseball on the most glamorous team in sports.\n\nAmerican flags at Yankee Stadium, including one in left field's hallowed Monument Park, were lowered to half staff. So was the Hall of Fame flag in Cooperstown, N.Y., where a wreath was placed around DiMaggio's plaque.\n\n\"The reverence for him was unsurpassed,\" said Hall of Fame spokesman Jeff Idelson.\n\nDiMaggio spent his final years in a waterfront residence, living alone until he became sick. He spent 99 days in a hospital before going home Jan. 19 and died barely one month shy of the Yankees' home opener, where he hoped to throw out the first ball.\n\nAt DiMaggio's bedside when he died were brother Dominick, a former major league outfielder; two grandchildren; and two friends.\n\nHis estranged relationship with his only child was reflected in his last will and testament.\n\nA trust fund will pay $20,000 a year to Joseph Paul DiMaggio Jr., who works in a northern California junkyard and lives in a trailer. The bequest appeared to be the smallest gift in the document, which by comparison established trust funds of $500,000 apiece for two great-granddaughters.\n\nDiMaggio's place in baseball history was secure as early as 1941, when he hit in 56 consecutive games -- one of the most enduring records in sports. A popular song of the day reflected the common sentiment: \"Joe, Joe DiMaggio, we want you on our side.\"\n\nHe was the reason many Italian-Americans in New York rooted for the Yankees, just as blacks rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers because they made Jackie Robinson the first black major-leaguer.\n\nTed Williams, who played in the Boston outfield next to DiMaggio's brother, Dom, was the contemporary most often likened to the Yankee Clipper.\n\n\"There is no one Ted Williams admired, respected and envied more than Joe DiMaggio,\" Williams said.\n\nCal Ripken of the Baltimore Orioles, a beloved player who shattered the consecutive games streak of Lou Gehrig, a former DiMaggio teammate, said: \"I feel fortunate and lucky that I had the opportunity to talk baseball with him. I'm a baseball fan, and his accomplishments speak for themselves.\"\n\nEven those who never saw him play sensed DiMaggio's majesty.\n\n\"He was one of the best in the game,\" said Mark McGwire, a modern-day larger-than-life hero who never got a chance to meet DiMaggio. \"It's a big loss for the game and for life in general.\""
