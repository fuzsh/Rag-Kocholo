        "text": "The United States was a nation united in homage last night after the baseball legend Joe DiMaggio, the most elegant and admired American sports star of his era, died in Florida at the age of 84.\n\nDiMaggio died peacefully at his home in Hollywood, Florida, early yesterday, five months after undergoing lung cancer surgery. His brother Dominick, himself a major league baseball player, was at his bedside.\n\n'DiMaggio, the consummate gentleman on and off the field, fought his illness as hard as he played the game of baseball and with the same dignity,' Morris Engelberg, his long-time friend and lawyer, said.\n\nFlags flew at half-mast at Yankee Stadium in New York, where DiMaggio established a nonpareil reputation as a baseball player and sportsman in a 15-year career between 1936 and 1951. Outside the stadium, fans of all generations queued to pay their respects to the 'Yankee Clipper', a player who represented all that Americans love about their national game and more.\n\nThe man whose inspirational qualities were immortalised in his friend Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man And The Sea the father rallies his doubting son with the words 'Think of the great DiMaggio' was remembered yesterday as 'one of our own and one of the greatest of all time' by New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton said that the United States had lost one of the century's most beloved heroes. 'This son of Italian immigrants gave every American something to believe in. He became the very symbol of American grace, power and skill,' Mr Clinton said yesterday.\n\nOutside America, DiMaggio's fame rests largely on his 10-month marriage to Marilyn Monroe in 1954 and on the lamenting reference to him in Paul Simon's 1968 song 'Mrs Robinson'.\n\nWhere have you gone Joe DiMaggio?/A nation turns its lonely eyes to you./What's that you say, Mrs Robinson?/Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.\n\nBut those lines contain a strong clue as to why, even 30 years ago, DiMaggio had already transcended his fame on the baseball field and had come to embody a lost heroic era in American life, a status that he worked hard to retain to the day of his death.\n\nDiMaggio's life was the quintessential story of the rise from poor Italian immigrant's son to national hero and international fame. He was the son of a San Francisco fisherman and played in the local baseball leagues before the Yankees signed him in 1934, ushering in a career which made him the most admired baseball player of the years in which America struggled out of the Depression and helped to defeat fascism.\n\nAlways wearing his trademark number 5 shirt, DiMaggio led the Yankees throughout their golden age, winning nine World Series titles in 10 seasons. Of all his many records, however, by far the most famous was his 56-game hitting streak in 1941, which remains unsurpassed to this day.\n\nThose who watched DiMaggio in his prime, though, always emphasise the grace and athleticism which like the English cricketer Denis Compton of the same era he brought to a sport which, until then, had been dominated by tough and often crude sluggers. DiMaggio was always immaculately dressed, dignified in his behaviour and yet he invariably played to the limit.\n\nDiMaggio retained a keen sense of his own worth and dignity. As a player he pushed for record salaries, and later guarded his privacy and reputation tenaciously, always insisting that in any public appearance at a baseball event he had to be announced last and to be described as 'the greatest living ballplayer'.\n\nHis marriage to Monroe, three years after his retirement, united America's most potent male and female icons of the early 1950s. The marriage foundered because of DiMaggio's then traditionalist male expectation that his wife would stay at home to look after him.\n\nBut DiMaggio remained devoted to Monroe after the divorce. When she died, DiMaggio took charge of the funeral and always refused ever to talk about her.\n\nOne of his final public appearances came last year, when he was honoured at the 75th anniversary dinner for Time magazine. The actor Kevin Costner said in his speech then what America was thinking yesterday: 'There are certain people's names that, when spoken aloud, are reminders of what men can be. To this day when I hear the name Joe DiMaggio it is so much more than a name.'\n\nLife of a legend\n\n1914: Born Martinez, California\n\n1936: Makes debut for New York Yankees.
