        "text": "It’s a debate that’s been raging for more than 50 years. Who is the best center fielder in the storied history of the New York Yankees: Joe DiMaggio or Mickey Mantle?\n\nBoth of them has a legitimate claim to the title.\n\nDiMaggio was a 13-time All-Star, 9-time World Series champion and 3-time American League MVP. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1955.\n\nMantle was a 20-time All-Star, 7-time World Series champion and 3-time American League MVP. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1974.\n\nMLB.com tries to settle the debate once and for all, while listing the best center fielder for every club.\n\nYankees: Mickey Mantle (1951-68)\n\nKey fact: Won seven World Series titles\n\nAn immensely talented icon of his generation, “The Mick” was the most feared hitter on some of the most successful teams in history, hitting 536 career home runs. In 14 seasons from 1951-64, the switch-hitting Mantle led the Yankees to 12 American League pennants and seven World Series championships. A three-time AL Most Valuable Player Award winner (1956, ’57, ’62), Mantle enjoyed one of the greatest offensive seasons ever in ’56, winning the AL Triple Crown by hitting 52 homers with 130 RBIs and a .353 average. He gets the nod in center over another all-time great, Joe DiMaggio.\n\nDiMaggio and Mantle shared the field for one season: 1951. DiMaggio played center in his final season while Mantle played right field in his rookie year, as the Yankees went on to beat the New York Giants in six games to win the World Series.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
