        "text": "They remembered Joe DiMaggio fondly and sadly yesterday and with the familiar words that had become forever linked with the player who treated center field at Yankee Stadium like his own playground. Class. Grace. Dignity. Greatness. The men who played with and against DiMaggio took deep breaths, forced their minds to rewind and spoke in reverential tones about perhaps the greatest all-round baseball player.\n\nA day does not vanish without Al Gionfriddo being reminded by someone, anyone, of his wondrous catch against DiMaggio in the 1947 World Series. A fly ball does not sail into the gap without Bobby Brown telling himself that DiMaggio would have grabbed it, and without diving. A discussion with Yogi Berra about the most awe-inspiring dinner he ever had focuses on one of the meals that he shared with DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe. A dialogue with Stan Musial about superb hitters is incomplete unless DiMaggio is prominently mentioned.\n\n''Joe was the pride of the Yankees,'' Musial said. ''He was the pride of baseball. He was a great, great player and a classy guy. He was a really classy guy. But, in our era, a lot of folks are passing on. It's part of life.''\n\nBerra was stymied for a moment when asked to describe DiMaggio's legacy with the Yankees before raising his hands and saying: ''He's gotta be like Babe Ruth. The both of them. They were great.''\n\nWhether it was Whitey Ford getting misty about how he fell in love while watching DiMaggio as a 9-year-old attending his first game at the Stadium, Jerry Coleman chuckling as he discussed how DiMaggio told the second baseman to get out of the way if he heard him chasing a baseball or Hank Bauer revealing that the first time he went out for a drink with DiMaggio was 20 years after they first became teammates on the Yankees, splendid tales about DiMaggio abounded. There was so much to recall about DiMaggio, whose contemporaries referred to him as baseball's Sinatra.\n\n''I think some people have a hard time understanding how much of a hero he was,'' said Brown, who played six years with DiMaggio. ''The difference between then and now is the coverage on TV. Most of his career, there was no TV, or TV was in its earliest stages, so what people knew about him was not from a television image. It was the real thing. Once you saw him play and saw the way he carried himself, it was something that you didn't forget.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
