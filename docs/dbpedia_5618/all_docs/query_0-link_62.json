        "text": "For many professional baseball players, the love for the sport and their athletic abilities run in the family.\n\nMLB siblings have competed both together as teammates and separately as rivals.\n\nHere are just a few of the many brothers who have played in the MLB over the years.\n\nMLB STADIUMS ACROSS THE US: HOW MANY HAVE YOU VISITED?\n\nJoe DiMaggio, Dom DiMaggio and Vince DiMaggio\n\nPaul Waner and Lloyd Waner\n\nPedro Martínez and Ramón Martínez\n\nPhil Niekro and Joe Niekro\n\nGaylord Perry and Jim Perry\n\nFelipe Alou, Matty Alou and Jesús Alou\n\nKen Boyer, Clete Boyer and Cloyd Boyer\n\nWes Ferrell and Rick Ferrell\n\nAaron Nola and Austin Nola\n\n1. Joe DiMaggio, Dom DiMaggio and Vince DiMaggio\n\nThe DiMaggio brothers are some of the most well-known baseball brothers in history. The trio played in the 1930s through 1950s. All three of the brothers were successful during their baseball careers and each of them played center field.\n\nJoe, the eldest of the three, played for the New York Yankees for all 13 years of his baseball career. He was a legendary athlete and was a nine-time World Series champion. He missed three seasons with the team when he served in World War II, from 1943-1945.\n\nVince moved around quite a bit between teams. He played for a total of ten years between the Boston Bees, Cincinnati Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies and New York Giants.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MARCH 8, 1999, YANKEES LEGEND JOE DIMAGGIO DIES, ‘CULTURAL ICON’ ON AND OFF FIELD\n\nThe youngest brother, Dom spent his 11-year career with the Boston Red Sox. Like his brother, Dom also fought in the military during World War II. He was stationed in Australia in 1944 and remained there for the rest of the war which ended in 1945.\n\n2. Paul Waner and Lloyd Waner\n\nThe Waner brothers are the only pair who were both inducted into the Hall of Fame. Paul played ball from 1926 until 1945, and Lloyd, the younger of the two, played from 1927 through 1945.\n\nThey both spent the majority of their careers together playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n3. Pedro and Ramón Martínez\n\nPedro and Ramón played together and as rivals during their respective MLB careers.\n\nPedro and Ramón were both pitchers. They started their careers on the Dodgers, but Pedro was traded to the Montreal Expos. Then, he played for the Boston Red Sox in 1998. In 1999, Ramón left the San Francisco Giants for the Red Sox and once again, played alongside Pedro.\n\nBASEBALL QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THE AMERICAN SPORT?\n\nPedro ended his career with the Philadelphia Phillies, and Ramón finished with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Pedro was elected into the Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\n4. Phil Niekro and Joe Niekro\n\nThe Niekro brothers were also pitchers.\n\nJoe brought home a 1987 World Series win with the Minnesota Twins. Unfortunately, Joe and Phil, nicknamed \"Knucksie,\" were not playing together at this time. The brothers were teammates briefly both for the Atlanta Braves and the New York Yankees.\n\nPhil was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nGEORGIA BASEBALL WITH A TWIST: HOW THE SAVANNAH BANANAS PUT A SPIN ON THE SPORT, DELIGHTING FANS\n\n5. Gaylord Perry and Jim Perry\n\nThe Perry brothers were both pitchers and recipients of the Cy Young Award. They were the only brothers to earn the award.\n\nThe brothers played against each other only once in their MLB careers, in 1973, when Gaylord played for the Cleveland Indians and Jim played for the Detroit Tigers.\n\n6. Felipe Alou, Matty Alou and Jesús Alou\n\nThe Alou brothers all played outfield in the MLB. They made history when they all played outfield during a San Francisco Giants game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sept. 15, 1963.\n\nThe Giants played the final two innings of the game with all three brothers. The Giants defeated the Pirates with a final score of 13-5.\n\n7. Ken Boyer, Clete Boyer and Cloyd Boyer\n\nAll three Boyers played in the MLB, though Cloyd had the shortest career. He played with the St. Louis Cardinals for his first four seasons and finished his fifth with the Kansas City Athletics.\n\nKen's career spanned over 15 years. He played most of his career with the Cardinals and won the World Series with the team in 1964. During this series, he played against his brother, Clete, a New York Yankee.\n\nClete had the longest career of the siblings, but only by a small margin. He played for 16 seasons with multiple teams including Kansas City Athletics, the Yankees and the Braves.\n\nIn 1955, Cloyd and Clete played together on the Kansas City Athletics.\n\n8. Wes Ferrell and Rick Ferrell\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRick was a catcher and Wes was a pitcher. The brothers played on the Red Sox and the Senators together for a few seasons. Rick found himself behind the plate catching for his little brother, Wes, many times through their careers.\n\n9. Aaron Nola and Austin Nola\n\nAaron and Austin Nola made history in 2022, in an epic brother versus brother showdown.\n\nDuring the MLB postseason in 2022, Aaron, the younger of the two, was pitching for Phillies, while his brother Austin, a catcher, was playing for the Padres. This was the first time pitcher/batter brothers faced off against each other in a postseason game.\n\nTheir parents, A.J. and Stacie Nola watched from the stands.\n\nAustin found himself at bat against his little brother, during the game. The Padres beat the Phillies in a final score of 8-5."
