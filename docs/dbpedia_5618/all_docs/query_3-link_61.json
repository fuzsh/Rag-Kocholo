        "text": "Joe DiMaggio is a very heroic person. My hero played baseball and did other things too. When Joe was on his fifty-six game batting streak, he took people’s minds off the war. During the war, a lot of professional baseball players were put out of their baseball career to serve in the war. Sadly, the mighty Joe DiMaggio had to put his baseball career behind him and join his baseball friends and his brother “Dom” to get ready for combat. Joe was stationed in Santa Ana, California. In the year of 1943 the Yankees won their first World Series without Joe. Before Joe went to war he was called a hero because he had the best batting in a rookie season. Joe was the first Yankee to hit two home runs in one inning.\n\nJoe DiMaggio was born on November 25, 1914 in Martinez CA. Joe had five brothers and three sisters. First was Nellie, then came the rest of them, Mamie, Tom, Marie, Michael, Frances, Vince, Joe, and Dominic- nine in all. When Joe was little he was a very shy kid. He didn’t talk to a lot of kids he didn’t know. Even when Joe was young, he still had a talent at baseball that led him to his baseball career. Joe was a mediocre student. His IQ was not very good and as he got older, he didn’t go to college.\n\nJoe had a lot of challenges. He missed three spring trainings because of major injuries. Joe had a big problem when he went to war, in 1943. When he went to war he didn’t get paid a lot. Joe had to play with an eye infection in one game. He had a hard time and missed ball after ball.\n\nJoe was a very generous person. Joe’s parents were very poor, so Joe gave them $6,400.00. He also bought his parents a new house. He also bought a boat for his brother Mike. On a very sad day, Lou Gehrig died so Joe hit a home run to honor his friend.\n\nJoe got a lot of awards. He was so good he went to an all star game in his rookie season. Joe was a very strong batter. He was so good he came in second in the batting title. In 1939 he was awarded MVP. He also won the batting crown in 1940.\n\nJoe was a role model. 85% of major league players said they admired Joe DiMaggio. To honor Joe, the Yankees put his retirement speech on the wall of the Yankees locker room. Joe was also called a leader because he was demanding more money for baseball players. Joe also went to war to help America.\n\nThat is all I have to say about Joe DiMaggio and I’m sure we all will remember this baseball hero."
