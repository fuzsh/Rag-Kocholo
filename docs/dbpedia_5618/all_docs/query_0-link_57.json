The 21 year-old rookie outfielder lives up to the hype, DiMaggio collects two singles and a triple in six at-bats, helping the New York Yankees to a 14-5 win over the St. Louis Browns. DiMaggio’s first at bat came against Jack Knott, he reached on a fielders choice. He singled in his next at bats vs Earl Caldwell in the 2nd inning.\n\nLou Gehrig also went 4-5, but Joe’s roommate Lefty Gomez doesn’t make it into the 5th.\n\nBaseball is the only game you can watch on the radio.
