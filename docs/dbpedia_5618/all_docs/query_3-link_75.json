        "text": "It’s difficult to imagine Joe DiMaggio in any uniform other than the classic pinstripes of the Yankees. But for several years in the 1960s after his playing career. Joltin’ Joe wore the green and yellow of the A’s.\n\nWhen Joe DiMaggio retired at the relatively young age of 36 after the 1951 season he was a legend. In 13 seasons, DiMaggio won three Most Valuable Player awards, and finished in the top three for that honor six times.\n\nMost importantly for baseball fans in the Bronx, DiMaggio led the New York Yankees to ten pennants and nine World Series titles. He was famous for his 56-game hitting streak in 1941, which captured the attention of Americans, sports fand and non-sports fans alike.\n\nDiMaggio accepted an invitation from A’s owner Charles Finley to join the Oakland A’s organization in 1968. The job was as “executive vice-president and special advisor.” And for two years, Joe satisfied that contract. Briefly, he even donned the Kelly green and gold of the A’s as a member of the coaching staff in 1968.\n\n“I have become attached to these kids,” DiMaggio said. “I have never been around a group so eager to learn.”\n\nAnd so, DiMaggio was there in the A’s dugout with young players like Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando, and Rick Monday. His short time in uniform was not forgotten, even if it was a strange uniform.\n\n“I learned a lot just watching Joe,” Reggie Jackson said years later. “He was a professional, and I wanted to be the same way.”\n\nDiMaggio wore a Yankee cap on his Hall of Fame plaque, of course. But, for a brief time he wore the much more colorful garb of the Swingin’ A’s, a team poised to become champions."
