        "text": "Early Years\n\nGiuseppe Paulo DiMaggio was born into a large Sicilian family on November 25th of 1914 in Martinez, California. His mother and father immigrated to the United States in 1902. They arrived in New York before traveling to San Francisco to open up a fishing business on Fisherman's Wharf. Joe grew up in the North Beach section of San Francisco a poor immigrant child. He had a hard time with English in his younger years and often slipped into Italian; which was the basis for many jokes in the schoolyard. He played baseball in sandlot games and in a local community boy's club, but was not passionate about the sport. His older brother Vince was in love with the game and encouraged Joe to keep playing.\n\nBaseball Career\n\nJoe fell in love with baseball only after he began playing for the San Francisco Seals in 1934. Soon after, he set his sights on playing for the New York Yankees. His major league baseball debut with the Yankees was May 3rd, 1936. From the time between 1936 and 1942, the team became World Champions 5 out of the 6 World Series they played in within 7 seasons. The most memorable portion of his career was when he hit safely in 56 straight games during the 1941 season; setting a new record for major league baseball. However, Joe was enlisted in the Army Air Force for the 1943 to 1945 seasons. After the war, he came back to baseball and retired at the end of the 1951 season. The Yankees retired his jersey #5 in 1952 and he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.\n\nEthnic Diversity\n\nFrom Joe's childhood to World War II, Italian-Americans were referred to by the ethnic slur \"dago\". It was part of America's culture to discriminate against Southern and Eastern Europeans because they were the minorities of the \"white race\". When Italy joined World War II, many Italian-Americans, including Joe's parents, were placed under surveillance. They were required to carry special identification, could only travel certain distances from their homes, and were not allowed to speak Italian because it was thought of as highly suspicious. Some were even placed in internment camps under President Franklin Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066; the same order that relocated about 120,000 Japanese-Americans. Also during World War II, there was a movement in the American education system to embrace peoples of all ethnicities as a sort of rebellion in the face of the Nazi regime in Germany and as a consequence of anthropological studies dividing the Earth's population into three races; White, Black, and Asian. Teachers would have their students celebrate the \"gifts\" each culture brought to America in class. While the program may have had good intentions, it did not promote the change some people were hoping for. The class demonstrations were often stereotypical and shallow in thought. The movement succeeded in equalizing all ethnicities of the \"white race\", but fostered further discrimination of Native Americans, Blacks, and Asians. Because Joe was a star player in America's pastime, he avoided much of the societal discrimination and suspicion of Italian-Americans during World War II and served to build morale by playing exhibition games on Army teams during the war. He was consistently called \"dago\" by his teammates and others, but he did not seem to mind or let it bother him. His success served as a counterpoint to many of the stereotypes against Italians in America."
