        "text": "Joe DiMaggio (1955)\n\nDate of Birth: 11/25/1914\n\nDate of Death: 3/8/1999\n\nBirthplace: Martinez, California\n\nJoe DiMaggio came from a baseball family, with two brothers, Vince and Dom, who also played in the major leagues. However, they did not have the stellar career that Joe did.\n\nDiMaggio started his professional career in the Pacific Coast League. He was traded to the New York Yankees in 1934.\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nDiMaggio first played with the Yankees in 1936, and he was impressive in his rookie season. That year, he batted .323, with 206 hits, 44 doubles, 15 triples, 29 home runs, and 125 RBIs in 138 games.\n\nDiMaggio's best season was probably his second one (1937) when he led the AL in home runs and he had career highs in hits, triples, home runs, and RBIs. He finished the season with 215 hits, 35 doubles, 15 triples, 46 home runs, and 167 RBIs in 151 games.\n\nDiMaggio batted .328 in 145 games in 1938. He had 194 hits, 32 doubles, 32 home runs, and 140 RBIs. He walked 59 times and struck out just 21 times.\n\nIn 1939, DiMaggio won his first of three American League MVP awards, the Sporting News MVP award, and the Sporting News Major League Player of the Year award. He won the AL batting title with a career high .381 batting average. He finished the season with 176 hits, 32 doubles, 30 home runs, and 126 RBIs. He walked 52 times and struck out 20 times in 120 games.\n\nDiMaggio again won the AL batting title in 1940. He batted .352 with 179 hits, 28 doubles, 31 home runs, and 133 RBIs in 132 games.\n\nIn 1941, DiMaggio hit in 56 straight games, a major league baseball record that still stands as the longest hitting streak in major league baseball. That season, he won his second AL MVP award, the Sporting News Major League Player of the Year award, and the Associated Press Athlete of the Year award. He led the AL in RBIs with 125. He finished the season with 193 hits, 43 doubles, 30 home runs, and a .357 batting average in 139 games.\n\nDiMaggio had an average season (for him) in 1942, finishing with 186 hits, 29 doubles, 21 home runs, 114 RBIs, and a .305 batting average in a career high 154 games. For the following three seasons, he served in the US army, where he continued to play baseball.\n\nDiMaggio returned to the Yankees in 1946. That season, he batted .290 with 146 hits, 20 doubles, 25 home runs, 95 RBIs, and 24 strikeouts to 59 walks in 132 games. The following season he won his third AL MVP award. He finished the 1947 season with 168 hits, 31 doubles, 20 home runs, 97 RBIs, 32 strikeouts to 64 walks, and a .315 batting average in 141 games.\n\nIn 1948, DiMaggio led the AL in home runs and RBIs. He had 190 hits, 26 doubles, 39 home runs, 155 RBIs, and a .320 batting average in 153 games. He walked 67 times and struck out 30 times. The following season, he played in just 76 games, but he still had a strong season. He finished the 1949 season with 94 hits, 67 RBIs, and a .346 batting average.\n\nDiMaggio had a career high 80 walks (to 33 strikeouts) in 139 games in 1950. He finished the season with 158 hits, 33 doubles, 32 home runs, 122 RBIs, and a .301 batting average.\n\nDiMaggio retired after the 1951 season in which he batted .263 with 109 hits and 22 doubles in 116 games.\n\nAwards and MLB Records\n\nAL MVP (3 times)\n\nSporting News Major League Player of the Year (2 times)\n\nSporting News MVP in 1939\n\nAssociated Press Athlete of the Year in 1941\n\nAL Batting title (2 times)\n\nLed AL in triples in 1936\n\nLed AL in home runs (2 times)\n\nLed AL in RBIs (2 times)\n\nCareer Statistics\n\nStatistics for DiMaggio in 13 seasons (1936-1942, 1946-1951) in the major leagues include:\n\n10 seasons with over 150 hits, with a high of 215 in 1937\n\n7 seasons with over 30 doubles, with a high of 44 in 1936\n\n8 seasons with 10 or more triples, with a high of 15 in 1936 and 1937\n\n11 seasons with 20 or more home runs, with a high of 46 in 1937\n\n9 seasons with over 100 RBIs, with a high of 167 in 1937\n\n11 seasons with a batting average over .300, with a high of .381 in 1939\n\nCareer batting statistics for DiMaggio include:\n\n1,736 games played\n\n2,214 hits\n\n389 doubles\n\n131 triples\n\n361 home runs\n\n1,537 RBIs\n\n.325 batting average\n\nCareer fielding statistics for DiMaggio as a center fielder include:\n\n1,634 games played\n\n4,176 putouts\n\n100 errors\n\n.977 fielding percentage\n\nCareer postseason statistics for DiMaggio include:\n\n51 games played\n\n199 at-bats\n\n54 hits\n\n6 doubles\n\n8 home runs\n\n30 RBIs\n\n23 strikeouts to 19 walks\n\n.271 batting average\n\n.398 on-base percentage\n\n.977 OPS\n\nPost Playing Career\n\nAfter retiring as a major league player, DiMaggio returned to the Yankees as a batting coach.
