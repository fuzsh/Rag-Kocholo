This included batting .340 with 28 home runs in the first season, .341, and .398 in the following.\n\nJoe suffered a knee injury involving torn ligaments at the peak of his rookie career in 1934, which halted his baseball activities and put his career in jeopardy.\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE CAREER\n\nJoe was acquired by the New York Yankees on November 21, 1934, at the age of 19, in exchange for five other players and cash considerations.\n\nHe officially made his debut as a Yankee on May 3, 1936.\n\nIn his rookie season, he batted .323 with 29 home runs and helped the Bronx Bombers win the World Series.\n\nJoe, a rookie, made a huge impact on the field in front of over 43,0000 fans when he hit .346 against the Giants.\n\nDiMaggio had 53 RBIs in August 1939, tying Hack Wilson’s 1930 record.
