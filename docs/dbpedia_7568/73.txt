Last week, Sarah Silverman and Howard Stern were discussing Steve Martin’s brilliant wit.1

Sarah proceeded to share a story about Steve. One year, she helped to host an AFI honors ceremony. After the awards show, she went to an afterparty at Steve’s house.

The idea was to have cocktails and dinner. Sarah was toasting with legends. Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Candace Bergen, Nancy Meyers.

Martin Short, acting as a sort of host, was asking questions to get conversation going.

“So Candace,” he said, “when did you first meet Steve?”

“Well, I remember I was hanging out with Lorne and Paul, and Steve didn’t know what prosciutto was!”

And then Steve, immediately, goes, “Can you believe it? And now I drive one!”
