Each time I stepped on stage and grabbed the microphone felt like a giant step forward in my nascent comedic journey. As a newbie, you get 3 minutes to start. 3 minutes is a deceptively short amount of time to break the ice and make a group of strangers laugh. After one month of experimentation, I've found my voice and rhythm for the very unique and bizarre art form that is standup comedy - educate, entertain, and built rapport with a one-way monologue where laughter turns the dynamic into a dialogue. It's also helped me think more clearly and be a happier person! **Here's what I've learned so far** ‚úèÔ∏è Write Constantly, Edit Over Time: What I found to help me in my joke-writing process is to brain dump into a Google sheet. Random funny thoughts or scenarios that happen throughout the week. It's a gold mine of material to work with that I can then revisit if I'm going through a slump or need a funny way to close a set. üòÇ See the Humor in the World: Once I started the comedy journey, I realized I needed original material. The best way for me was to go out and be present. Less phone time, more time observing the world - whether it's local folks queueing in line, tourists blocking the road with large maps, or noting the limited selection of protein bars in Singapore compared to the US. Instead of being upset about minor inconveniences, try to make a joke out of it! Remember the story and the lesson - have a laugh at it! üß™Prioritized and Practiced Language: Being concise is hard. I subconciously use so many filler words in our daily conversations. Business jargon and qualifiers are my conversational crutches. On stage, the clock is ticking. The audience doesn't need the extra 15 seconds of backstory - practice cutting it out by distilling the joke into fewer words. This process of cutting down jokes to the core has helped me be a sharper thinker - identifying the core idea and trimming away the fat. ü™ûGetting Over Myself: Blame it on imposter syndrome, fear of narcissism, or just hearing my own jokes, I felt VERY uncomfortable watching my standup recordings. I had to accept myself and embrace my tendencies. This was the key to getting better - watching and critiquing my delivery, stage presence, and pinpointing where I could have slowed down to leave more time for a laughter break. Now that I've been bumped up to 5 minute sets, I'm getting more comfortable with sharing my past time with friends and inviting my network to attend. If you're keen to support or checkout my next show, I'll be going on on Monday November 27 at 7:30pm at the Blu Jaz Comedy Club in Bugis/Singapore.

The rest of the group took over and started debating it - basically the concern was: if you don't/can't gig that often, do you cease to be a comedian? This is one of the fundamental difficulties of stand up - not performing is an existential problem. This panic to fill your diary with all the gigs becomes all-consuming, and the weight of a blank calendar has driven many people with aspirations to run back to their day job - or worse. My firm answer was - you can call yourself whatever you want, but you know when you've earned it. It's after slogging away on the circuit, enduring endless budget travel, but - most importantly - building your act. This means putting real thought into what kind of funny person you want to be on stage, and what you want to say. These are the hard questions, and they not only give you impact as a comedian but they give you longevity. Anyone can get \"the bug\" from getting a few chuckles a handful of times, but being in it for the long haul means being mindful of your intention. This gives you the passion to stick with the craft, which will then give you consistency - not only in your performances, but in the rigourous hard work you put in. I'm constantly annoyed by stuff, like most city dwellers, and after an altercation with a bus driver today I realized I've turned into someone who processes everything through the lens of stand up comedy logic. It's how I get to the truth of how I feel, and how not to get overwhelmed by life's daily - and more long term - dramas. So this question came back to me, and I realized that's why I call myself a stand up comic. My workshops are all centered on using timed writing prompts and group discussion to get to the bottom of your authentic sense of humour and feeling - while framing them in objectively effective comedy formulas. I'm not one of these people who say you can't \"teach funny\" - I think that's total bullsh!t. If you encourage people to be real, and give them tools to express themselves in an accessible and engaging way, they will be. And if they put hard work and consistency into their practice - they can be over and over again.

I forgot the punchline for a joke, I said the words in the wrong order. I reversed and said the whole sentence again, then got the punchline right. The audience laughed as if nothing happened. The less attention I bring to my mistakes, the better experience the audience has. 2) The unexpected will happen. Less than 20 seconds after I started, I got unexpected audience participation. I decided to make a joke out of it. That joke got more laughs than the one I had planned in my script. If I were to have ignored it, it would've sounded like I just came there to say what I had written out, and not to engage with the audience. 3) I'm so glad I rehearsed. I rehearsed my set about 50 times start to finish. Each time, the jokes kept evolving, the punchlines kept improving, and muscle memory set in. At first, it sounded like I had rehearsed it too much but after a certain point. I had rehearsed so many times that it sounded 'natural.' 4) It was very difficult for me to 'unlearn' public speaking and learn 'comedy.' I'm so used to sounding 'polished' and 'assertive' while delivering keynotes that I didn't realize, that style really didn't do well in comedy. It took a lot out of me to remove those habits and relearn new habits that allowed me to put the audience at ease, put them in a good mood, and earn their laughs. I'll say this right now: Speaking in front of an audience is pretty routine for me, but being in front of an audience with the sole success metric being: Did they laugh? That's much harder. That's a skillset I intend on developing this year. 5) Unpredictable audience Whenever I do keynotes or workshops, I know the demographic. I know who's going to be in the audience, and I can tailor my jokes accordingly. Here, the audience was very different than I imagined and there really was no way of knowing who's going to attend. Some jokes landing with certain people, others landed with other people. It taught me to experiment and diversify my jokes. It also taught me that in my head, some jokes were a lot funnier than they were to the audience. And some things that I said that weren't even 'jokes' got the biggest laughs. I'll let the audience filter what's good and what's not. -- I'm really happy with this experience and intend on doing a lot more!\n\nLast year, I signed up for a standup comedy class. It was mostly on a whim, something fun and low-stakes to try after I embarked on a sabbatical in October, and only like 2-5% because I thought I could be the next Taylor Tomlinson. And, plot twist, the study of comedy turned out to be the study of how to live and work well: 1. Quality is about quantity. Comedy is a relational art. It is not just hard to figure out what will land well by pinging jokes around in your own brain; it is literally impossible. You can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs going to land until you try it out on real humans in the real world. You have to write 50 jokes to find the one gem that‚Äôs actually worth honing. So if you‚Äôre trying to hone first, joke‚Äôs on you‚Äîyou might find yourself polishing a turd. You know what‚Äôs also a relational art? Comms! Absolutely nothing matters in comms other than getting your point across to your audience, and sometimes you can‚Äôt figure out what will land until you experiment a little. 2. Perception is not reality. Our teacher required us to record our sets in class. More than once, I found myself thinking about how poorly a set had gone, only to listen and discover that wait, actually, people WERE laughing?! I KNOW reality and my perception of it often diverge. But knowing something is not the same as believing it. Recording my sets forced me to acknowledge the truth about what was landing and what wasn‚Äôt. 3. Find the feedback that resonates and throw away the rest. I have historically tried to be all things to all people, to get good grades and attend a good college and embark on a career path that made my parents proud/was interesting at cocktail parties/didn‚Äôt involve too much downside risk. Part of the muscle we built in class was to figure out when feedback was helping us get where we wanted to go‚Äîand when it wasn‚Äôt. It was empowering to be told to literally just ignore feedback that didn‚Äôt work for you. It was also scary, because it meant I had to actually know what my goals were outside of ‚Äúmake everyone happy and also no one mad at me.‚Äù 4. Do it scared. Sometimes in class, we weren‚Äôt given time to flesh out a few jokes before we were called to the mic. I HATED getting up without a single thought in my brain. And I am pretty sure the vast majority of my improvised riffs absolutely bombed. But one of ‚Äòem landed well enough to get molded into a bit for my final five-minute set. 5. Have an amateur‚Äôs mindset. As I‚Äôve progressed in my career, I developed a sense of where I ‚Äúshould‚Äù be and measured everything against that. But I had no expectations going into this class, which meant every piece of incremental progress felt really exciting. I‚Äôm trying to get back to that amateur mindset as I build something new for myself professionally. That celebration of the little wins.

What piece of advice was most helpful?\n\nüé§üí° Leadership Insights from the World of Stand-Up Comedy üí°üé§ In an unexpected twist, it turns out that the art of stand-up comedy offers profound lessons for leaders in any field. As someone who has experienced both the exhilaration and the challenges of leadership over the past 25 years, and my experiences in the Irish Comedy scene for the past 20 years, I've discovered that the principles guiding successful comedians can significantly enhance our leadership skills, particularly in the realms of self-awareness and vulnerability. Self-Awareness: The Core of Your Material Just as comedians delve deep into their experiences to find relatable, authentic material, leaders must engage in self-reflection to understand their strengths and weaknesses. This journey of self-awareness isn't just about capitalizing on what you're good at; it's about recognising where you falter and how those aspects can impact your team. A comedian's acute self-awareness allows them to connect with diverse audiences. Similarly, a leader's insight into their own character can bridge gaps, inspire trust, and foster a strong team dynamic. Vulnerability: The Strength in Letting Go If there's one thing stand-up comedy teaches you, it's that vulnerability can be a powerful tool. Comedians share their failures, fears, and faux pas, turning their vulnerabilities into a source of connection and laughter. In leadership, showing vulnerability isn't a sign of weakness; it's an invitation for others to see the human behind the role. It builds empathy and shows your team that it's okay to take risks, make mistakes, and be open about challenges. The Feedback Loop: Laugh, Learn, Iterate Every stand-up performance is an opportunity for feedback. Comedians listen to their audience's reactions - every laugh, silence, or groan - to refine their act. Effective leaders, too, must embrace feedback with an open heart and an eagerness to improve. It's about creating a culture where feedback is welcomed and acted upon, where every challenge is seen as a chance to grow. Timing and Adaptability Comedy is all about timing, and so is leadership. Knowing when to push forward with an initiative or when to take a step back is crucial. Similarly, being adaptable - able to pivot your approach based on the team's mood or the project's needs - mirrors a comedian's ability to change their set based on the room's energy. Conclusion: The stage of stand-up comedy, much like the arena of leadership, is not for the faint of heart. It requires courage, self-awareness, and the willingness to be vulnerable. As leaders, if we can embrace these lessons, we can create environments where creativity flourishes, challenges are embraced, and teams feel genuinely connected and supported. Let's take a cue from the world of comedy: be real, be you, and remember, the power of leadership, much like comedy, lies in connecting with people on a human level. üåü #Leadership #SelfAwareness #Vulnerability #management\n\nTonight, I attended an incredible comedy show, and it whisked me back to my past life as a comedian. Yep, I once braved the stage with a mic and a dream! The laughs, the lights, and the post-show mingling with other comedians trying to out-funny each other while pitching collaborations‚Äîit all felt oddly familiar. It hit me how similar networking in comedy is to the corporate world, especially in Learning and Development. Take first impressions, for instance. In comedy, your first joke can set the tone for the entire set. In L&D, your first workshop or training session can shape how learners perceive you. Whether you‚Äôre on stage or leading a training, putting your best foot forward (and maybe saving the knock-knock jokes for later) is crucial. Then there‚Äôs the magic of authenticity. On stage, being genuine wins hearts. In the business realm, especially in L&D, people can spot insincerity from a mile away. Being true to yourself resonates with others, no matter where you are. And timing‚Äîoh, timing is everything. In comedy, a perfectly timed joke can turn a good set into a legendary one. Similarly, in L&D, knowing when to introduce new concepts or give feedback is essential. The right timing can turn a simple training session into a transformative learning experience. Engaging with your audience is another common thread. Whether you're in front of a crowd or in a meeting, engagement is key. Asking questions, showing interest‚Äîit‚Äôs a dialogue, not a monologue. And after a great set, comedians know to follow up with clubs and hosts to stay top of mind. In L&D, following up with learners and leaders to check on their progress can make a significant impact. Finally, building your brand. Comedians have their unique style that sets them apart. In L&D, your personal brand is your signature. Whether it‚Äôs your teaching style, your approach to development, or your personality, let it shine. Who knew that my days of cracking jokes on stage would prepare me so well for the corporate networking scene and my career in Learning and Development? No matter the industry, the way you present yourself is essential. So, whether you‚Äôre holding a mic or a business card, remember to be authentic, engage, and follow up. Here‚Äôs to building connections and maybe throwing in a good punchline or two along the way! üé§‚ú® #Networking #Comedy #LearningAndDevelopment #PersonalBrand #Authenticity #CareerGrowth"
