        "text": "If this seems hard to follow, then welcome to the Michio Kaku world of Rick and Morty. “I consider it my job to service the insanity,” Harmon says, referring to Roiland. “I love the idea of serving the crazy guy instead of being the crazy guy.”\n\nHarmon has a reputation, be it deservedly or undeservedly, as a difficult genius. He’s one of the few people who can create a great show, then get fired despite the high quality of his work, as he did from The Sarah Silverman Program on Comedy Central and Community on NBC — which later hired him back, then canceled the show. “I forget my pain,” Harmon says. “I just move from one thing to the next. If I remembered my pain, I’d stop working.”\n\nLike South Park before it, Rick and Morty was never intended to be anything more than a one-off project. Its origins lie in a monthly short-film festival called Channel 101 that Harmon co-founded. “I had a history of occasionally going into Channel 101 with something that I made with the intention of just eliciting shock and screams, and this was certainly one of those times,” Roiland recalls of the original short, The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, in 2006. “I’d just gotten off a job [at Spike TV] that was creatively horrible. So I had this pure ‘I don’t give a fuck’ energy, which is sometimes the best energy because you have nothing at stake.”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\n“Ed Norton says in Fight Club, ‘I felt like destroying something beautiful,'” Harmon interrupts. “For Justin, that was Back to the Future.‘”\n\nRoiland continues: “There’s a part in [the short] where Mharti is disappearing and Doc says, ‘You have to jerk me off to stop it,’ and this huge, beautifully drawn erect penis appears. I couldn’t have been happier sitting in a theater with 300 people and hearing this massive swell of a reaction. It was one of the highlights of my life.”\n\nIt may come as a shock, but with this sensibility, Roiland had trouble getting his shows on network television. He’d had moderate success working on two Dan Harmon creations: The Sarah Silverman Program and a very-short-lived VH1 sketch show called Acceptable TV. But other than those, for a good 10 years, Roiland pitched network executives non-stop, selling, by his own count, three shows to Fox and three to Cartoon Network that never got picked up. “Observing Justin having project after project killed was really painful,” Harmon recalls. “He literally said to me, ‘I don’t know how much more of this I can take.'”\n\nSo when Adult Swim asked Harmon to put together an animated pilot, he decided to work on making Roiland’s humor palatable to a broader audience. “The challenge was: How do you make my mom understand how funny it is to see somebody vomiting diarrhea,” Harmon explain, then adds, glancing at his partner, “Not to pigeonhole Justin’s sensibility.”\n\nHarmon’s solution was to contain that energy in the character of Rick, and place him in an otherwise stereotypically dysfunctional television family. Rick, Harmon elaborates, is modeled on the idea of The Cat in the Hat, who bursts into the ordinary world and creates havoc.\n\nAlthough this formula has worked far beyond its creator’s expectations, Roiland still has a way to go before reaching his personal benchmarks for success. One involves seeing a bootleg t-shirt on Venice Beach of Rick smoking a joint. The other, going to a comic convention and seeing a man and woman dressed as Rick and Morty making out. “I did see a dude Rick and a girl Morty in Austin and asked them to make out,” he admits. “But they looked at me funny and told me they were cousins. So that’s still my white whale.”"
