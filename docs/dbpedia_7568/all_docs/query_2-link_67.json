        "text": "Jon Stewart will be forced to miss his regular Monday night gig hosting The Daily Show this week after contracting COVID-19, Comedy Central announced. In his place, the show’s longtime correspondent Michael Kosta is set to take on the hosting duties all week long. Kosta was a somewhat unexpected ratings hit when he served as Daily Show guest host last year, beating out big names like Sarah Silverman and Chelsea Handler. This week, he is scheduled to sit down with columnist Roxane Gay, former Daily Show correspondent Ed Helms and stand-up comedian Hannah Berner. Stewart plans to return to the show on Monday, Aug. 12, at which point he should have plenty to say about Vice President Kamala Harris’ soon-to-be-announced running mate. Last month, Stewart canceled and then rescheduled his Monday show following the assassination attempt on Donald Trump and increased security at the Republican National Convention that caused The Daily Show to scramble its plans."
