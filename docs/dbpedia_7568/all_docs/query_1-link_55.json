        "text": "Q: Are you still in touch with Matt Damon?\n\nA: Only telekinetically.\n\nQ: With the Matt Damon video and The Great Schlep, you’ve had two massive viral hits. What impact have they had on your career?\n\nA: They have made me known by more people, but I think it has made people think of me as a personality, and it makes it harder to be seen as an actor. I like to audition so I can prove I’m not limited to being me. I can be you. But it’s a small price to pay to be able to express myself so totally freely. Is that answer gay?\n\nQ: What feedback did you get about U.S. election day in Florida? Were there sightings of Gen Y types actually taking their grandparents to the polls?\n\nA: Yeah, people really did it. It was nuts! I was kidding! No, I think it may have actually helped in some small way. I’m proud to have been a part of it. We are living in exciting and inspiring times in all sorts of ways. Should I be giving you funny answers? I’m listening to sad music right now – it makes me sappy. Come on, Silverman, man up!\n\nQ: You recently won a Webby for The Great Schlep. How would you compare the Webbys, the Emmys and the MTV Awards?\n\nA: Much more p---y at the Webbys. Oh, snap! I’m back!\n\nQ: Is the internet the future of comedy? How web-savvy will comedians have to be?\n\nA: I think it’s informing a whole new level of comedy, yeah. Anyone has access; anyone with a laptop can put something out there. I think it’s cool.\n\nQ: What are your own internet viewing habits?\n\nA: I just watched a bunch of Jon Glaser’s Delocated shows online, though it’s a Cartoon Network show. It’s so amazing. Sometimes I’ll get lost looking up random things on YouTube like, \"woman falls\" or I’ll look up live music performances by great bands.\n\nQ: You were recently quoted in a New York Times magazine article about Zach Galifianakis, a fellow traveler in the indie comedy movement. What advice do you have for comedians about to break through and have their moment?\n\nA: Hmmm... I don’t know. Do it because you love it. Because it makes you laugh and it makes you happy. Any other reason isn’t worth it.\n\nQ: You grew up in New Hampshire, which doesn’t seem like a comedy hotbed. What made you want to go into comedy?\n\nA: Shockingly, it is a comedy hotbed. I’m from the same town as Adam Sandler and Seth and Josh Meyers!\n\nQ: Were there any comedians who inspired you as a kid?\n\nA: Yeah! Steve Martin, Ruth Gordon, Woody Allen, Eddie Murphy, Albert Brooks, David Letterman, Carol Leifer.\n\nQ: What contemporary comedians do you like?\n\nA: I love this question. Tig Notaro is brilliant – she gets the most laughs with the least amount of words. Louis CK, Chelsea Peretti, Heather Lawless,Todd Glass – I could go on and on!\n\nQ: Where does stand-up fit into your career now?\n\nA: It’s hard keeping up with stand-up when I’m working on The Sarah Silverman Program and going straight home to sleep at night instead of going to the clubs. Stand-up is something you need to do all the time or you fall out of practice, so it’s frustrating not being in the zone when gigs are only just sporadic between shooting weeks. But I have some songs from the new season of the show I’ll probably try out.\n\nQ: What was the worst night of your stand-up career?\n\nA: There are so many... the worst times have been when something bad or sad in my life is going on, and I still have to go up. You want to stay honest on stage and be in the moment, and there have been times or moods when I’m just not seeing anything funny. That’s the only time it feels like work. But sometimes, for reasons I do not understand, SOMETIMES those are the best shows.\n\nQ: You often court controversy in your comedy. What are your boundaries? Is there anything you won’t say?"
