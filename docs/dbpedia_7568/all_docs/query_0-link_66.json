        "text": "For this week’s comedy feature we spoke with stand-up comedian Alyce Chan. Alyce Chan is incredibly relatable and jokes about her everyday life, including her parents and being a mom. Her delivery is spot on and will have you enjoying every minute of her set!\n\nHow would you describe your comedy style?\n\nDry, deadpan, self-deprecating and a touch of raginess (if that’s a word)\n\nWho are some of your influences?\n\nKevin Nealon, Norm Mac Donald (Rest in Peace), Tig Notaro, Hannah Gadsby, Ali Wong, Margaret Cho, Sarah Silverman, Chelsea Handler\n\nWho was your favourite comedian growing up?\n\nLucille Ball, Steve Martin, John Candy and John Ritter\n\nWho is your favourite comedian now?\n\nKevin Nealon\n\nWhat is your pre-show ritual?\n\nI never eat or drink anything. I may take one small sip of water right before I go on stage but I definitely go to the bathroom at least 3 times before my set.\n\nWhat is your favourite place you have performed? Why?\n\nCaroline’s on Broadway in New York because it’s iconic, I took my first comedy class there and you get a blend of tourists and locals. And Havana Theater in Vancouver for the intimate edgy vibe and the staff couldn’t be kinder.\n\nWhat is your favourite bit you have written and why were you proud of it?\n\nI start off by telling people that I had two pregnancy scares. People get uncomfortable. A few giggles. I then expand and tell them that my pregnancy scars are actually my two kids and the room goes wild.\n\nWhat is your favourite medium for listening or finding new comics/comedians?\n\nI watch as many Netflix specials as I can. If I can go see someone I love live, that’s even better but it’s not always possible.\n\nDo you have anything to promote right now?\n\nYes, I’m producing an epic all-female lineup show on August 3rd. There are two shows that night 7:30 pm and 9:45 pm. I’ll be performing with local talents such as the incredible Yumi Nagashima and Julie Kim.\n\nHere is the link if you are interested.\n\nPeople can use MOMCOMVR for $5 off\n\nWhere can we follow you?\n\nInstagram | Website\n\nPAY IT FORWARD: Who is another local comic/comedian we should know about?\n\nEd Hill"
