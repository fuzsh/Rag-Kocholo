As a friend of the late Hutchison, Silverman also performed on the tribute album Tiny Changes. “He helped me get out of a downward spiral,” she says. “It’s just his music has such a different meaning now and sometimes it’s too hard to listen to, but I love it so much.”\n\nListen to Sarah Silverman chat about Someone You Love and more above, or watch below via YouTube.
