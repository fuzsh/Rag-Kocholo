        "text": "Comedy Legends Steve Martin & Martin Short Join Forces\n\nMartin meets Martin in this extraordinary meeting of two of modern comedy's greatest entertainers. Steve Martin and Martin Short present 'You Won't Believe What They Look Like Today', a Q&A style conversation between the two comedians and the audience with a musical twist. Expect an evening of banjo-tinged interludes and singing punctuated by the side-splitting humor and charisma of these comedy greats.\n\nGrammy Award-winning comedian and accomplished bluegrass pianist Steve Martin has had a stellar, almost 50-year-long career in film, stand-up, and television, winning the hearts of international audiences with turns in gems like 'Father of the Bride' (alongside Martin Short) and 'Bowfinger'. Since his break-out comedy debut on SNL, actor and comedian Short quickly crossed over to mainstream films and theatre, winning a Tony Award for his role in the 1999 revival of 'Little Me'. Catch Steve and Martin in the hilarious comedy 'Only Muders in the Building' - now streaming!"
