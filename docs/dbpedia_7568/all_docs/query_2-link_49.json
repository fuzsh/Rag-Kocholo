        "text": "There are so many items that I would love to talk about with David Cross. There’s his early history with the legendary “Mr. Show” HBO series, or his scene-stealing role as Tobias Funke on “Arrested Development.” One could spend hours talking about his other TV and film roles, or the series of comedy albums he released over the years on Sub Pop.\n\nI set those aside for something more important, however. Cross, along with other comedians such as Janeane Garofalo, Todd Barry and Sarah Silverman, always seemed to be the type you could run into at a record store or a Superchunk show. Of course, I had to ask about the similar music tastes of the ’90s alt-comedy scene.\n\n“Well, we were all friends with bands, too,” Cross says. “We were all coming up together and hanging out in the same communities. It wasn’t any calculated proactive thing. It was just how it turned out.”\n\nPressed to point out his favorite bands, Cross says it’s “tough to narrow down. When I was younger, The Who were really important. When I started to get into punk and new wave as a teenager, it was Elvis Costello, The Jam, X. Then it was the whole indie scene like Superchunk and Buffalo Tom.”\n\nWhile the rest of the interview primarily concentrated on his current “Making America Great Again!” tour, I had to throw out the question that just cannot be ignored. Will there be another season of “Arrested Development”?\n\n“I don’t know. I just asked that question after my show in New York last week. Ron Howard was there, and I asked him the same thing. I told him that whenever I do press, that’s the No. 1 thing every single person asks. He said, ‘Yeah, me, too. Same thing.’ I’ll tell you what he told me, which is that everybody wants it to happen, and it’s a matter of making it work out. That’s the same thing that happened the first time, which took a long, long, long time.”\n\nQuestion: Whether it’s musicians or comedians, I always ask about influences. Who were your early comedy heroes?\n\nAnswer: There’s a bit of a mix. As far as standup goes, I’d say the big ones were George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin and Andy Kaufman. They were the big ones as I was becoming aware of standup. To a lesser degree, but still important, I’d say Lenny Bruce and Jonathan Winters. I’m thinking back to the actual albums I had. Those are the big ones.\n\nQ: What led you to decide that comedy is something you wanted to do?\n\nA: I never had an epiphany or anything like that. I just grew up liking comedy stuff. I used to love “Monty Python” and “Saturday Night Live” as a kid. I was a funny kid, and I acted out a lot, so it was just natural. I never like sat down and made a list of the things I wanted or should become. I don’t know. I guess the short answer is that it was always sort of there, and when I started high school I’d go to open-mic nights and just started.\n\nQ: Was acting always a part of your goal, or did that just come along as the comedy career progressed?\n\nA: It was part of the bigger picture from the early age. I did a lot of theater when I became a teenager. I went to a school for the arts and started performing and doing these summer things when I was maybe 15. So I always had that sort of bug, too. I guess performing is what I liked.\n\nQ: I understand that this tour came about partly because you were laid up for a few weeks after shoulder surgery. Did you spend that time writing new bits?\n\nA: No, I can’t write standup. I’ve never been able to do that. Believe me, I wish I could because it would make my life a lot easier. I hadn’t toured in like five years at that point, so I just took all the material I had accrued over the years. I hadn’t stopped doing standup. I just hadn’t toured. I took all that material and put together what I thought was a good hourlong set. I started working on that stuff, and that’s basically how I do it. Then I hit the road.\n\nQ: You filmed a new special a few days ago. In the days prior, were you continuing to edit the material for that filming?\n\nA: Yeah, but not necessarily with an eye for the taping. This always happens, so I knew from experience this would happen. I’m trying to keep the set to an hour and 15 minutes, which I have not been very good at doing in the past. It’s always gone on too long, like an hour and a half to two hours. That’s way too long. All my material is spreading as I riff within it, so I’ve been dropping bits here and there. Like I said, that’s what I always do so I knew it was going to happen. With an eye towards keeping it to a tight hour and 15, I probably will still take it to an hour and a half. By the time I get back to the West Coast where I started in January, the act will be, I’d say, 40 percent different, if not half.\n\nQ: Having not been on a comedy tour for six years, were you nervous about facing a live crowd again?\n\nA: Yeah, in the same way that I always am before the very first show. You can’t practice in front of 1,800 paying people. There’s no practice. I did a couple of surprise hourlong sets in New York at various shows where I would drop in. I wouldn’t tell anybody. Obviously, the club knew. So I did two of those. I was confident in the material, but I wanted to make sure the structure of the show was right. It’s very important, and it’s tough to get it exactly right in the beginning. Should this part go here? Is it too much silly (stuff)? Should I move this over here? So when I did the very first show, which was in San Diego, I was definitely nervous. That happens on every tour at the very first show. You’re hoping you got it right. Thirty seconds in, you’re rolling and everybody is enthusiastic. You’re having a good time, so the pressure is off. I really don’t get nervous about too much stuff, except for that first show. I was also kind of nervous for the New York shows, too. Not really nervous, but just kind of distracted and couldn’t focus very well. I was chomping at the bit to do them, but as they were approaching I (started feeling that way). They’re the hometown. The venues are bigger. It just feels ... especially since it’s the middle of the tour. If it was just a one-off, I don’t think I’d feel that way.\n\nQ: I have to ask a few questions about other topics, but I want to start with your old “Mr. Show” partner Bob Odenkirk’s show “Better Call Saul.” It really is one of today’s great shows. Did you know that he was that great of an actor?\n\nA: (That show) is fantastic. Yes, absolutely. Even in “Mr. Show,” way before he was in “Breaking Bad,” there are some bits I can point to and say, “There is a great actor there.” I think that’s one of the things that gave “Mr. Show” a fairly unique sense. Some of the taped bits in those bits are pretty spot-on, and he brought a lot of that to funny comedy bits.\n\nQ: Is there any sort of competition between the two of you?\n\nA: No, not at all.\n\nQ: I read that you were one of the initial investors in Kickstarter, which has been a godsend to so many film and music artists.\n\nA: Yeah. I think it’s fantastic. The guy was a friend of my cousin’s, and she set up the meeting. I had to sign a nondisclosure agreement, and he told me over lunch this idea. I was kind of like, “How is this going to work?” He had all these ideas and just needed the money basically to get lawyers involved. When he explained it to me in more detail, I thought it was great. I’ve been a part of maybe 15 or 20 campaigns that were successful, and I also Kickstarted a thing for myself to get a movie (“Hits”) into theaters. It’s great. It’s fantastic, and those guys are really good, decent, ethical people.\n\nQ: The Ralphie May controversy of a few weeks ago originated in this part of the country. There really seem to be people who do nothing but search for things to use to go after comedians. What are your thoughts on these social media controversies?\n\nA: I agree with the overall basic sentiment that it has become too limiting, and kind of hypocritical in a sense, too. When people just troll on the Internet, you just have to have a thick skin. You have to roll your eyes and go, “I don’t even know who this asshole is,” and just shake it off. But when somebody is trying to damage somebody’s career, there’s a significant line that has been drawn. I definitely sense it. I’ve experienced it on this tour, and I’ve definitely experienced it prior to this. Not just once or twice, but numerous times. It’s definitely different than it was 20-plus years ago when I was starting out, but it was always there. When I would do shows in Cambridge or San Francisco, they were the worst shows. These are most liberal places, and they would literally hiss at you. So it’s not a new thing, but it has definitely spread. The thing is that a lot of these people in the context of standup don’t listen to the bit. They hear the words, and they hear the word they don’t like, and they don’t listen to the context of it. That could have been, although I don’t know because I’m not that familiar with Ralphie May’s situation, the situation of taking something out of context. I would have to see it, but I imagine he’s in the right.\n\nQ: May says that the final punchlines were cut.\n\nA: Then that’s a different thing, because that is somebody manipulating the material to get him banned. That’s not good. But I’m sure those people wouldn’t stick around for the turn, or the twist. Whether you buy into it or not is one thing, or think it’s funny or not, but if that was the intent, it’s a completely different thing.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Comedian David Cross’ “Making America Great Again” tour stop\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Friday\n\nWhere: The District, 4521 W.
