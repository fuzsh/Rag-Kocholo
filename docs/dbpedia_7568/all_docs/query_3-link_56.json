Once I really understood that, I saw it all around me.”\n\n-Sarah Silverman, episode 335 of Talk Easy with Sam Fragoso\n\nToday, we’re joined by comedian Sarah Silverman! At the top, we reflect on loss (7:16), her new special, Sarah Silverman: Someone You Love (12:35), and coming of age in the ‘80s (18:42).
