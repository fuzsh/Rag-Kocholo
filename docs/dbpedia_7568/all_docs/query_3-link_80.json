Sarah Silverman is back with a new season of The Sarah Silverman Podcast, where Sarah shares her thoughts and musings on anything and everything under the sun.

But weird is her sweet spot. New episodes of The Sarah Silverman Podcast from Lemonada Media premiere every Thursday. You can leave a voice memo for Sarah at speakpipe.com/TheSarahSilvermanPodcast.",
