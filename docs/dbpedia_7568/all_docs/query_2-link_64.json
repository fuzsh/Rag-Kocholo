        "text": "SATURDAY TV: Steve Martin receives AFI Lifetime Award\n\nTONIGHT'S MUST-SEE: \"AFI Life Achievement Award,\" 10 p.m., TBS, rerunning at 11:30. Any award or tribute show is brightened when Steve Martin arrives as a presenter. Now comes the ultimate, with Martin as the recipient; he'll speak last, after lots of funny friends. The ceremony was held June 4, leaving the tough job of cutting it in half for this slot. There were old-timers — Mel Brooks, 88, who hosted, and Carl Reiner, 90, who directed Martin's early movies — plus Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Steve Carell, Sarah Silverman and Dan Aykroyd. Martin Short sang — so did Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah — and did 10 minutes of Martin-mocking.\n\nTONIGHT'S MUST-SEE II: \"In an Instant,\" 9-11 p.m., ABC. It was the middle of a rush hour, in August of 2007, when an eight-lane Minneapolis bridge collapsed over the Mississippi River. Thirteen people were killed and 145 were injured. Now this rerun offers the most elaborate of the excellent \"Instant\" documentaries. Skillfully mixing first-person accounts, re-enactments and brief news footage, it tells of crises — a woman trapped in her car, 63 kids on a bus near a fire — plus mistakes, heroics and makeshift solutions.\n\nTONIGHT'S ALTERNATIVE: \"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\" debut, 10 p.m., BBC America. For a while, this fanciful miniseries tells us, England forgot about magic. It was 1806, the Napoleonic Wars dragged on, and the land of Merlin was magic-less. Then opposites emerged — the reclusive Mr. Norrell and the charismatic Jonathan Strange. Their competition would stir excitement and danger. That story, from Susanna Clarke's novel, is a seven-week tale in good company: It follows the splendid \"Orphan Black\" and is directed by Toby Haynes, who did \"Wallander\" and \"Sherlock\" films for PBS.\n\nOther choices include:\n\n\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003), 2:30 p.m., TNT. Sure, this film has way too many endings; still, it was wrapping up a superb trilogy from director Peter Jackson ... whose \"The Hobbit\" (2012) follows at 7 p.m. The full trilogy runs Sunday, at 8 a.m., 11:45 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.\n\nHockey, 8 p.m. ET, NBC. It's the fifth game of the best-of-seven Stanley Cup finals, with Chicago at Tampa Bay. That goes against baseball (varying by region) at 7 p.m. ET on Fox.\n\n\"The Whispers,\" 8 p.m., ABC. At first, this seemed like a supernatural tale — an imaginary friend, telling kids to do lethal things. But this second episode changed that: Maybe the amnesiac \"John Doe\" is talking to the kids, through vents and stuff; maybe there's a reason this all happens near Washington, D.C. Catch this well-crafted rerun, before the third episode airs Monday.\n\n\"Elementary,\" 8 p.m., CBS. In a rerun, a nurse whom Watson worked with wants help finding a missing acquaintance ... leading to another missing person. Also, Sherlock struggles with sobriety.\n\n\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" 9 p.m., CBS. Heading to a forensics conference in this rerun, the women — Jorja Fox, Elisabeth Shue and Elisabeth Harnois — are expecting poolside relaxation. Naturally, there's a mass shooting that puts them to work.\n\n\"Power,\" 9 p.m., Starz, rerunning at 10 and 11. Last week's season-opener (rerunning at 7:55 p.m.) brought jolts for James \"Ghost\" St. Patrick. A shooting left his nightclub temporarily closed and Holly (his partner's girlriend) near death. He learned that his mistress is an assistant district attorney probing drug traffic ... and that Simon Stern is his new landlord. Now come more jolts, in a fairly good episode.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live,\" 11:29 p.m., NBC. After seeing Martin Freeman star in \"The Hobbit,\" we can see him host this rerun. Charli XCX is the music guest.\n\nSunday\n\nTONIGHT'S MUST-SEE: \"Game of Thrones\" season-finale, 9 p.m., HBO (rerunning at 11:31) and/or \"Lord of the Rings\" films, TNT. Hollywood once seemed to have only two modes — small-and-skillful movies or large-and-loud-and-lame ones. Then a new generation of filmmakers created smart epics; two examples arrive tonight. If you have HBO, you're probably planning on \"Thrones\"; Stannis' army is on the march and Daenerys — fresh from her first dragon ride — is surrounded by strangers. And if you don't have HBO, catch Peter Jackson's \"Rings\" trilogy (8 a.m., 11:45 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.) and his \"Hobbit\" (2012) at 8 p.m.\n\nTONIGHT'S MIGHT-SEE: Basketball, 8 p.m. ET, ABC. Things return to the Golden State home court, where the Warriors — in the finals for the first time in 40 years — are hungry for a win. After having the NBA's best regular-season record, Stephen Curry's team breezed through the play-offs ... until colliding with LeBron James' Cleveland Cavaliers. That's preceded by a Jimmy Kimmel special at 7 p.m. and a preview at 7:31.\n\nTONIGHT'S ALTERNATIVE: \"The Crimson Wing\" (2008), 8-10 p.m., NatGeo Wild. Tanzania's Lake Natron might seem like a desolate spot; it dries up so quickly that salt islands remain. Somehow, flamingos decide that's the perfect place to court, to mate and to hatch their babies. \"Wing\" is part of Disney's splendid nature-film series, which finally has a TV home with NatGeo. Each of the annual films is beautifully done; this one is alternately gorgeous (an estimated million soaring birds), creepy (predators stalk) and funny, with stick-legged creatures walking in unison.\n\nOther choices include:\n\n\"Love Finds You in Charm,\" 3 p.m., UP. Fueled by Jane Austen romances, a young Amish woman wonders about the outside world of \"Englishers.\" Visiting Charm, Ohio, she meets two fine-looking Englisher specimens (played by Trevor Donovan of \"90210\" and Tiffany Dupont of \"Greek\"). \"Charm\" starts slowly and rushes its finish, but the rest is likable and ... well, charming.\n\n\"Crash\" (2005) and \"American Beauty\" (1999), 6:30 and 9 p.m., Sundance. Here's a chance to catch two best-picture Oscar-winners, each a portrait of modern life; \"Beauty\" repeats at 11:30.\n\n\"The Simpsons,\" 8 p.m., Fox. Lisa writes a town anthem; also, Homer's new cause is \"wide pride.\"\n\n\"Southern Uncovered,\" 8 p.m., Ovation. On the next six Sundays, Matt and Ted Lee will show a hip side to traditional Southern cities. In this fun view of their home town of Charleston, S.C., they visit a graffiti artist, a home-style chicken place and a guy who ages wine underwater in the harbor. We also see them finally learning (really) to dance the Charleston in Charleston.\n\n\"A.D.,\" 9 p.m., NBC. After a perilous start, this new Christian religion is making progress. James strikes a compromise with Caiaphas, the Jewish leader ... Paul gains followers after he resurrects Tabitha ... and the Ethiopian backer of the Zealot army converts to Christianity.\n\n\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" 10 p.m., CBS. This rerun – the apparent return of the Gig Harbor killer — was the second with Patricia Arquette as cyber-expert Avery Ryan. The character soon starred in \"CSI: Cyber\" ... which returns this fall, with Ted Danson moving there from the cancelled \"CSI.\""
