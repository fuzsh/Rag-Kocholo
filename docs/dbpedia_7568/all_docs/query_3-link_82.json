She will next be seen opposite Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson in the feature film Marry Me. Other upcoming projects include TBS’s Stupid Pet Tricks, an expansion of the famous David Letterman late-night segment, and the indie psychological thriller Viral, starring alongside Blair Underwood.\n\nHer first book, a memoir called The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee, which went on to become a New York Times bestseller, is currently being adapted into a musical with the Atlantic Theater Company to premiere in April 2022.\n\nSilverman served as creator, executive producer, and host of the Emmy-nominated series I Love You, America, which streamed weekly on Hulu and saw her connecting with people through honesty and humor. On stage, she continues to be recognized as a force in stand-up comedy. Her latest stand-up special, A Speck of Dust, debuted on Netflix in May 2017 and culminated in two Emmy Award nominations and a Grammy Award nomination.

I’m a wine drinker, and I love a few glasses over meals with friends. That said, I hate hangovers. For the last few months, all of the wine in my house has been from Dry Farm Wines. Why? At least in my experience, their wine means more fun with fewer headaches. Dry Farm Wines only ships wines that meet very stringent criteria: practically sugar free (less than 0.15g per glass), lower alcohol (less than 12.5% alcohol), additive free (there are more than 70 FDA-approved wine-making additives), lower sulfites, organic, and produced by small family farms.\n\nAll Dry Farm Wines are laboratory tested for purity standards by a certified, independent enologist, and all of their wines are also backed by a 100% Happiness Promise—they will either replace or refund any wine you do not love. Last but not least, I find delicious wines I never would have found otherwise. It’s a lot of fun. Dry Farm Wines has a special offer just for listeners of the podcast—an extra bottle in your first box for just one extra penny.

Have a listen to my conversation with Jerry Seinfeld in which we discussed the book that nudged him toward comedy as a potential career, how to generate and maintain a prolific wellspring of creative ideas, why the word “systemize” is such an important part of his personal operating system, self-rewards and other routines that keep him writing, and much more.\n\n#485: Jerry Seinfeld — A Comedy Legend’s Systems, Routines, and Methods for Success\n\nConnect with Sarah Silverman:\n\nTwitter | Instagram | Facebook\n\nThe Sarah Silverman Podcast\n\nThe Bedwetter | Atlantic Theater Company\n\nThe Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee by Sarah Silverman | Amazon\n\nMarry Me | IMDb\n\nSanta Inc. | HBO Max\n\nI Love You, America | Hulu\n\nA Speck of Dust | Netflix\n\nViral | IMDb\n\nComedians in Cars Getting Coffee | Netflix\n\nSarah Silverman Opens Up About Her Battle With Depression and Her Gutsiest Career Move Yet | Glamour\n\nXanax (Alprazolam) | Rx List\n\nCardigan Mountain State Park | NH State Parks\n\nSarah Silverman: ‘There Are Jokes I Made 15 Years Ago I Would Absolutely Not Make Today’ | The Guardian\n\nMein Kampf | Wikipedia\n\nDo You Have an Inner Monologue?

And I just remember the feeling of yelling it out and all these grownups giving me this wild approval despite themselves. And that feeling, I just became addicted. … Shock became my currency at three and four and five.”\n\n— Sarah Silverman\n\n“Hey, I’m not everyone’s cup of tea, and it’s okay if you don’t like what I say, and it’s okay if you’re no longer a fan.”\n\n— Sarah Silverman\n\n“With my stand-up, I’m a very slow honer. I’ll work on a joke for months, months, months, months, maybe even a year or two years and I hone it so slowly, even though it may sound kind of in the moment, I’m working on it inch by inch. And on the podcast, it’s very immediate. It’s messy.”\n\n— Sarah Silverman\n\nPEOPLE MENTIONED\n\nSeth Rogen\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nOwen Wilson\n\nDavid Letterman\n\nBlair Underwood\n\nJerry Seinfeld\n\nSarah’s Stepdad and Dad\n\nSarah’s Mom\n\nMary\n\nHoward Stern\n\nJason Fried\n\nTaika Waititi\n\nJemaine Clement\n\nJudd Apatow\n\nMartin Scorsese\n\nQuentin Tarantino\n\nTerry Gross\n\nChris Rock\n\nPaula Poundstone\n\nCharlie Kaufman\n\nBalaji Srinivasan\n\nNostradamus\n\nSarah’s Stepmom\n\nDoris Kearns Goodwin\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nFranklin D.
