        "meta_description": "This Saturday night promises to be a big one for comedy geeks. First off, Comedy Central is airing Bill Cosby: Far From Finished, the legendary comedian and sitcom star’s first new comedy special in over 25 years. Meanwhile, over on HBO, Sarah Silverman is starring in her first special for the network, We Are Miracles. Though the two comedians couldn’t be more different, both specials feel like landmarks: innovative, intelligent, and brilliantly funny. To celebrate this big night for televised stand-up, we put together the definitive list of great comedy specials created for television, home video, or digital (theatrically released concert films, like Silverman’s Jesus Is Magic, Cosby’s Himself, and — sadly — most of Richard Pryor’s filmed work, don’t qualify). Here’s our 50 best, of all time, with a couple of extras to boot: [November 18, 2013]\n\n[Missing Bobcat Goldthwait - \"Is He Like that All the Time?\" (1989)]",

        "text": "Chris Rock spent most of the early ‘90s sorta phoning it in on Saturday Night Live, a show that never quite knew what the hell to do with him; after leaving SNL, he did a brief stint on the well-past-its-prime In Living Color before going back out on the road and discovering that he’d kinda lost his chops as a stand-up comic. Some performers might have coasted, or thrown in the towel. Instead, Rock buckled down, rebuilt his act and persona from the ground up, and roared back onto the scene with the finest comedy special ever made, bar none. 1996’s Bring the Pain found Rock combining social commentary, personal introspection, and comic performance with a skill and finesse unseen since the glory days of Pryor; it brought the comedian back from the professional dead, and reminded us all of what the stand-up form was, and what it could be.\n\nAfter the failure of his HBO sitcom Lucky Louie, Louis C.K. decided to refocus on his stand-up act, working to become the best road comic in the country. And he proceeded to do just that. His second hour-long special, which aired on Showtime in 2008, finds him truly hitting his stride, taking on language, health, race, women, and 9/11 thoughtfully and uproariously. But his best material is the middle slab about fatherhood, wherein he finds a perfect mixture of wonder and bitterness at his kids — and their *beep* Chewed Up was recorded on March 1, 2008, the same night that George Carlin recorded his final hour; it feels like the night that the baton was passed, and that Louie took over the televised stand-up dynasty that Carlin had cultivated since the 1970s.\n\nWhen George Carlin is asked which HBO concert is his favorite, his answer is always, \"Jammin' In New York.\" The reasons are several: It was his first HBO show done live; it was the first he had done in his hometown, New York City; and it was the largest audience he had ever worked before: 6,500.But Carlin says it also represented a newfound sophistication in his writing. \"It was the first time I had done truly extended pieces consisting of separate sections all flowing together. It was a big leap for me.\"The show, taped at the Paramount Theater in Madison Square Garden and winner of the 1992 CableACE Award, is a perfect blend of biting social commentary and more gently-observed observational pieces.\n\nI might be in the minority on this one, but I actually prefer grouchy, angry, nihilistic older George Carlin to his quirky hippie younger counterpart. That variation of his persona had peeked out in earlier specials like Doin’ It Again and What Am I Doin’ in New Jersey, but it was fully formed and raging in this priceless 1992 HBO special, where he takes on such topics as the war in Iraq (the first one, that is), environmentalism, and golf. But most memorable is his epic riff on the insanity of airline announcements; do yourself a favor and cue that one up before your next big trip, and marvel at how George is still killing it.\n\nSome of the material (particularly the tired anti-gay stuff) hasn’t aged all that well — and neither has that red leather suit. But few hours of television are as revered among young comics as Eddie Murphy’s 1983 HBO special, featuring such classics as his riffs on pop singers, his memories of ice cream trucks, and the story of his drunken father acting out at family cookouts. A mere 22 years old at the time of its recording, Delirious grabs the hot young comic at his cockiest and funniest, before years of paycheck roles and family comedies sanded down the fascinating rough edges on display here.\n\nBarr was a top-notch road comic and Tonight Show favorite when she landed her first HBO special in 1987. It was the culmination of her act and persona, as a bitter, smartass “domestic goddess” who did not suffer fools (like her husband and kids) gladly. Explosively funny from beginning to end, it caught the attention of Cosby Show executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, who adapted that persona into Roseanne the following year.\n\nExecutive transvestite Eddie Izzard takes his show to San Francisco to give a brief history of pagan and Christian religions, the building of Stonehenge, the birth of the Church of England and of Western empires, and the need for a European dream. Along the way, he dramatizes Dr. Heimlich's search for a maneuver, the naming of Engelbert Humperdinck, Scooby and Shaggy as archetypes, Neil Armstrong on the moon, society's tolerance of mass murderers, how we sing anthems and carols, Hollywood adapting British films, JFK's trip to Berlin, thoughts on puberty, and how to work schoolbook-French phrases into Parisian conversation. Closeups catch the glint in his eye and his carefully-applied make-up.\n\nIzzard had made a name for himself in the United Kingdom throughout the ‘90s with a series of brilliant one-man shows, in which he looked at the history of the world and contemporary mores through his intelligently silly lens. But his worldwide breakthrough came in 1999, when a San Francisco engagement (presented by Robin Williams) of his one-man show Dress to Kill was taped by HBO. The result is one of the finest specials in their history, a jolly jaunt through all of civilization, with a very funny transvestite leading the tour.\n\nIt almost seemed as though the bold, confrontational, and thought-provoking Hicks had to get the hell outta the States to look at his home country with proper cynical detachment, and that’s what happened in the early 1990s, when he toured the United Kingdom and made the Revelations special for Channel 4. It ended up being the best special of his tragically short career, an angry, jaded, blistering look at the nonsensical injustices of the world and the unaccountably stupid people who inhabit it.\n\nMartin was quite possibly stand-up comedy’s first “rock star”—successes like Bill Cosby or Don Rickles played theaters, but when Martin blew up, he was playing arenas. It was all a little silly, a goofy guy in a white suit with an arrow through his head, playing the banjo and juggling on the massive stage of the Universal Amphitheater — and that’s what’s great about this 1978 NBC special (which mixes that material with taped sketches). The self-reflexive nature of his act is taken to its most absurd point, and the material is performed to perfection.\n\nGarafalo’s reign as ‘90s It Girl was in full effect when HBO aired this half-hour special in 1995 (just before her breakout in The Truth About Cats and Dogs). In the compact show, she covers pop culture, dating, feminism, and sex (I can’t describe exactly why the “STOP *beep* ME” bit is so funny, but it is), with cynicism and wit in a loose, disorganized style. It remains a funny show, and perfect snapshot of the transformations happening in stand-up at that moment.\n\nBecause I get worked up about such things, I’m irritated by all the press insisting that Far From Finished is “Bill Cosby’s first stand-up special in 30 years!” That’s incorrect, because a) Himself wasn’t a “special,” it was a theatrically released motion picture, and (more importantly) b) that timeline completely ignores Bill Cosby: 49, a marvelous 69-minute Cosby special released straight to VHS by Kodak back in 1987. The show captures the comic on the edge of turning 50, and most of his material is about approaching that milestone: changes to his body, his health, his eyesight, his eating habits, and so on (much of which he transcribed in his bestselling book Time Flies). But the best bit comes at the end: a 15-minute story about how he went into the Navy, and his first night there. It’s the kind of almost-rambling storytelling that would come to define his act in the years to come; it’s also the Cosby classic that should have been, a long, searching, deeply personal story that is fall-down funny and remarkably evocative, all at once.\n\nChappelle burst onto the stand-up scene with the skill and confidence of a prodigy; I still vividly remember how he appeared at Comic Relief VI, a 20-year-old ball of laid-back comic dynamite, and walked off with the show. His 2000 HBO special Killin’ Them Softly is solid from beginning to end, but it features one of his unquestionably iconic bits: the hilarious tale of a 3am visit to the ghetto in the back of a limo, and his encounter with a streetwise baby.\n\nWhen Williams was at his peak, nobody was better, his rapid-fire jokes and lightning-fast improvisation aiding a keen sense of social satire. This 1982 HBO special catches him at that peak (quite possibly with the aid of a bit of the ol’ “Peruvian Marching Power”), with a memorable performance on his home turf of San Francisco. The Reagan administration material and other topical references still work, but what’s most remarkable is his audience improvisation; he riffs and vibes with jaw-dropping skill.\n\nAmongst the loud likes of contemporaries Kinison and Goldthwait, Boston comic Steven Wright came up with the simplest and most effective of ‘80s stand-up gimmicks: arid dryness. With a deadpan persona that makes Buster Keaton seem comparatively animated, Wright quietly delivered a cascade of surrealist one-liners that made him a comic legend. He’s done frustratingly few specials over the course of his long career, and the best is still his first, a 1985 HBO hour that remains timelessly, hilariously funny.\n\nThis 2007 DVD remains, far and away, the finest showcase for the idiosyncratic comic genius of Mr. Galifianakis, who does a screamingly funny set at the legendary San Francisco club, trotting out his trademark piano one-liners and easel bits, as well as some first-rate crowd work. In between, he also plays his uptight, Christian conservative brother “Seth Galifianakis,” interviewed by former Daily Show correspondent Brian Unger. The temptation of untold riches from endless Hangover sequels may have sidelined Galifianakis as a stand-up, and that’s a shame; as this disc proves, he’s one of the most unpredictable and talented comics in the game.\n\nIn fall 1984, director Mike Nichols took then-unknown Whoopi Goldberg’s collection of character monologues to Broadway for a six-month run. Steven Spielberg saw that show and offered her the leading role in The Color Purple, and the rest is history. But more importantly, HBO’s cameras recorded the performance, capturing the multi-talented Goldberg playing everyone from a Jamaican housekeeper to a Valley Girl to a child to Fontaine, a streetwise junkie whose trip to Amsterdam takes an unexpected turn. Funny, challenging, and occasionally heartbreaking, it plays today as a reminder of the talent being wasted every day on The View.\n\nBirbigs isn’t just any stand-up; his most recent special (recorded for Netflix earlier this year) was honed in New York clubs and perfected during an off-Broadway run. As with his previous one-man show, Sleepwalk With Me, My Girlfriend’s Boyfriend utilizes an innovative, circular construction and careful pathos (along with Birbiglia’s shambling charm) to tell a story that is at once painfully confessional and hysterically funny.\n\nFans old and new have cause for celebration with the release of Sam Kinison: Breaking All The Rules, HBO Special. Along with being voted onto Comedy Central's All-Time Top 20 Stand-Up Comedians list and VH-1's Top Comedians list, Sam seemed to be in a whole other class by himself. This comedy special will blow away the Kinison fan, and will be a must-have collectible. \"Sam was the cuddly anti-Christ...\" - Robin Williams. \"Sam scared the hell out of you...and was the funniest comedian...\" - Jay Leno. \"Sam took no prisoners...\" - Richard Pryor. \"Sam was an absolute comic genius...\" - Rodney Dangerfield. \"Sam's humor was based on truth and pushed the envelope like no other...\" - Larry King. \"Sam's voice was the voice of outrage...\" - Tim Matheson. \"Sam was one of our generation's greatest stand-up comics...\" - Howard Stern. \"Sam was one of my all time favorite comics...\" - Johnny Carson. \"Sam was outrageous, bright and absolutely screamed the truth...\" - Tom Lykis\n\nLike Eddie Murphy’s ‘80s work, the homophobia of Mr. Kinison’s act has not aged particularly well. And like Murphy, even that objection doesn’t subtract from the considerable brilliance (and undeniable influence) of his comedy — particularly with regards to this, his first HBO hour, before the “rock star” excesses took over both his personal life and his onstage act. In this explosively funny hour, the former Pentecostal preacher takes on the Bible, organized religion, and his ex-wives with equal furor. A portrait of a ground-breaker, alive with the rawness of comic discovery.\n\nIf you think Sarah Silverman’s decision to shoot her new special for an audience of 39 was too grand and not quite intimate enough, we direct you to this recent VOD hour by the wonderfully weird Maria Bamford, performed in front of an audience of two. And it’s a tough crowd: her parents, frequently discussed during the act in question. The results are fascinating — a sly commentary on the thin line separating life and art. (Plus, y’know, funny.)\n\nOswalt spent much of the early 2000s quietly making a name for himself as a comedian’s comedian — sharp, funny, goofy, and brilliant. This 2004 Comedy Central special was his first hour-long show (after half-hours on CC and HBO), and it captures some of his finest material: Black Angus, homoerotic ‘80s music videos, “Dr. Pepper” the heroin-addicted open mic comic, NPR’s poor music choices, Stella D’oro Breakfast Treats, and true crime television. His follow-up specials, My Weakness Is Strong and Finest Hour, are outstanding as well, but this is Patton at his best.\n\nThese occasional benefits for Americans in need aren’t always a laugh riot — it’s a telethon, after all, so there are serious interludes, and its three regular hosts (Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg, and Robin Williams) have all become less funny (at differing rates of speed) over the years. But the original 1986 show, which aired on HBO, was full of memorable moments: a killer opening with multiple character turns by the hosts, a Sid Caesar/Carl Reiner reunion (with the former playing “Professor Ludwig von Knowitall); a surprisingly funny stand-up turn by Jerry Lewis; a Martin Short/Catherine/O’Hara/Harold Ramis Second City sketch; Bobcat Goldthwait doing his act in an on-stage shower; and, best of all, George Carlin performing “A Place for My Stuff.”\n\nThe immediate aftermath of 9/11 was a weird time to be a political comic — seldom have the boundaries of what people did and didn’t want to hear seem so impenetrable. (Even George Carlin had kind words for the job performance of George W. Bush in his fall 2001 special, though he couldn’t resist joking, “Someday, we oughtta think about electing that guy president.”) But Mr. Show’s David Cross wasn’t having it; his 2002 album Shut Up, You *beep* Baby! and this accompanying tour/concert film captured the troublesomely flag-waving national zeitgeist with appropriate anger and cynicism.\n\nThe following year, One Night Stand gave America its first good look at a charming blonde observational comic with a rather unfortunate early-‘90s mullet. Ellen DeGeneres had a quirky style and distinctive charisma that would serve her well throughout the decade the followed, as she took the traditional paths to television series and film. But it is this 2003 special that finds her at her comic peak, discussing everything from yogurt to sexuality (which would become so much a part of her public persona after coming out in 1997)."
