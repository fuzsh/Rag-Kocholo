        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nComedic actor Adam Sandler came close to an Oscar nomination for his dramatic turn in the Safdie Brothers' \"Uncut Gems,\" which was released on Monday May 25 on Netflix.\n\nPlenty of other actors and actresses mostly known for comedies have tried their hand in dramatic roles, including Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, Melissa McCarthy, and Bill Murray.\n\nHere are 16 of the best performances by comedy actors in serious films, ranked in chronological order.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhoopi Goldberg in 'The Color Purple' (1985)\n\nRole: Celie Johnson\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"A black Southern woman struggles to find her identity after suffering abuse from her father and others over four decades.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 81%\n\nGoldberg was a stand-up comedian for some time, which is where she came up with the stage name \"Whoopi\" (from a whoopie cushion). She also starred in comedies \"Soapdish,\" \"Sister Act,\" \"Corinna Corrina,\" \"Eddie\" and \"Rat Race.\"\n\nSteven Spielberg cast her in \"The Color Purple\" after catching her one-woman Broadway show \"Whoopi Goldberg.\" 'The Color Purple' earned 11 Oscar nominations, including a best actress nod for Goldberg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobin Williams in 'Good Will Hunting' (1997)\n\nRole: Will Hunting\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"Will Hunting, a janitor at M.I.T., has a gift for mathematics, but needs help from a psychologist to find direction in his life.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\n\nRobin Williams' 100-mile-an-hour style of stand-up comedy drew the attention of Hollywood, and he starred in a slew of beloved comedies including \"Aladdin,\" \"Hook,\" \"Mrs Doubtfire,\" and \"Jumanji.\"\n\nHowever, Williams also appeared in several dramas and earned best actor Oscar nominations for his performances in \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"Dead Poets Society,\" and \"The Fisher King.\" His most iconic dramatic performance, however, came in \"Good Will Hunting,\" which earned him an Oscar win (best supporting actor) on his fourth nomination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill Murray in 'Lost in Translation' (2003)\n\nRole: Bob Harris\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"A faded movie star and a neglected young woman form an unlikely bond after crossing paths in Tokyo.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 95%\n\nBill Murray starred in \"Caddyshack,\" \"Ghostbusters,\" \"Scrooged,\" and \"Groundhog Day\" amongst other classic comedies and became a pop-culture icon.\n\nSo when Murray appeared in Sofia Coppola's drama \"Lost in Translation,\" the quiet strength of his performance took everyone by surprise. He earned a best actor Oscar nomination, but lost to Sean Penn (\"Mystic River.\")\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Carrey in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' (2004)\n\nRole: Joel Barish\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a medical procedure to have each other erased from their memories.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 93%\n\nThe wacky Jim Carrey made a name for himself starring in larger-than-life comedies like \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,\" \"Dumb and Dumber,\" and as the Riddler in \"Batman Returns.\"\n\nLike Robin Williams, Jim Carrey gave a few dramatic turns in the 90s, including \"The Truman Show\" and \"Man on the Moon.\" But it was the early-2000s romance-drama \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" that remains the most memorable, helped all the more by the fact that he starred alongside Kate Winslet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack Black in 'King Kong' (2005)\n\nRole: Carl Denham\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"A greedy film producer assembles a team of moviemakers and sets out for the infamous Skull Island, where they find more than just cannibalistic natives.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 84%\n\n\"High Fidelity,\" \"Shallow Hal,\" and \"School of Rock\" are all classic comedies, and Black is one talented guy — but no one could have guessed his next move after \"Shark Tale\" would be to team up with \"The Lord of the Rings\" director Peter Jackson.\n\nBlack starred in Jackson's epic \"King Kong\" as greedy film director Carl Denham, giving a great dramatic turn in a world full of horrors. Also, Black nails the film's iconic line \"'twas beauty killed the beast.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEddie Murphy in 'Dreamgirls' (2006)\n\nRole: James \"Thunder\" Early\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"A trio of black female soul singers cross over to the pop charts in the early 1960s, facing their own personal struggles along the way.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 78%\n\nEddie Murphy's \"Raw\" and \"Delirious\" stand-ups have since gone down in comedy legend, and Murphy inspired a whole bunch of future comedians with his ground-breaking routines. His film career wasn't bad, either, starring in comedies like \"48 Hrs,\" \"Trading Places,\" \"Beverly Hills Cops,\" and \"Coming to America.\"\n\nHe further cemented his status as a comic icon with performances in \"The Nutty Professor,\" \"Mulan,\" and \"Shrek,\" but drew the attention of the Academy with \"Dreamgirls.\" Murphy came oh-so-close to winning best supporting actor, but had to settle for the nomination only.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill Ferrell in 'Stranger Than Fiction' (2006)\n\nRole: Harold Crick\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"I.R.S. auditor Harold Crick suddenly finds himself the subject of narration only he can hear: narration that begins to affect his entire life, from his work, to his love-interest, to his death.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 73%\n\nTwo years prior to \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" Ferrell starred in \"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\" probably one of the funniest American comedies in recent cinema and one of the most quotable movies ever made.\n\nHis cartoonish performance as Ron Burgundy was spectacular, but compared to his quieter, more restrained performance in \"Stranger Than Fiction,\" the latter proves that Ferrell can do quiet drama, too. He earned a Golden Globe nomination for his work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMo'Nique in 'Precious' (2009)\n\nRole: Mary\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"In New York City's Harlem circa 1987, an overweight, abused, illiterate teen who is pregnant with her second child is invited to enroll in an alternative school in hopes that her life can head in a new direction.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 91%\n\nMo'Nique was mostly known for comedy work, including stand-up shows, as well as her role in the sitcom \"The Parkers.\" She was also the host of a beauty pageant for plus-sized women: \"Mo'Niques Fat Chance.\"\n\nNone of this particularly pointed to the fact that Mo'Nique was going to be a future Oscar winner, but that's what happened. The actress starred in \"Precious\" as the title character's mean mother, and swept awards season, ending with a best supporting actress Oscar win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Coogan in 'Philomena' (2013)\n\nRole: Martin Sixsmith\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"A world-weary political journalist picks up the story of a woman's search for her son, who was taken away from her decades ago after she became pregnant and was forced to live in a convent.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 90%\n\nCoogan has starred in comedies like \"24 Hour Party People\" and \"Night at the Museum,\" but is best known for creating the inimitable \"Alan Partridge.\" But Coogan also has some dramatic chops, as shown in the first season of \"The Trip\" and in \"Stan & Ollie.\"\n\nIt's \"Philomena,\" though, that remains his best dramatic performance. Not only did he star in it, but he also wrote the film along with Jeff Pope, and the two were nominated for the best adapted screenplay Oscar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJennifer Aniston in 'Cake' (2014)\n\nRole: Claire Bennett\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"The acerbic, hilarious Claire Bennett becomes fascinated by the suicide of a woman in her chronic pain support group. As she uncovers the details of Nina's suicide and develops a poignant relationship with Nina's husband, she also grapples with her own, very raw personal tragedy.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 48%\n\nIt's almost pointless listing the comedy movies Jennifer Aniston has starred in (\"Picture Perfect,\" \"The Good Girl,\" \"Bruce Almighty,\" \"The Break-Up,\") as everyone knows Aniston as Rachel Green from \"Friends.\"\n\nBut her fame for \"Friends\" often gets in the way of how good an actress she can be, and her sweary role in \"Cake\" is a far cry from Rachel Green. She came very close to her first Oscar-nod for this movie, picking up nominaitons in all the precursor awards but ultimately missing out on the nomination that matters most.\n\nThe film itself wasn't exactly embraced by critics, with several suggesting the movie lacked depth and sophistication and relied too heavily on Aniston's performance, according to the Rotten Tomatoes critics consensus.\n\nUltimately, the film has been accused of being too simple, but critics agree that Aniston makes the most out of this character to give a complete performance.\n\n\"'Cake' finds Jennifer Aniston making the most of an overdue opportunity to test her dramatic chops, but it lacks sufficient depth or warmth to recommend for all but her most ardent fans,\" Rotten Tomatoes concluded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Carell in 'Foxcatcher' (2014)\n\nRole: John du Pont\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"U.S. Olympic wrestling champions and brothers Mark Schultz and Dave Schultz join \"Team Foxcatcher,\" led by eccentric multi-millionaire John du Pont, as they train for the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, but John's self-destructive behavior threatens to consume them all.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 87%\n\n\"The Office\" launched Steve Carell into Hollywood, and movies such as \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" \"Anchorman,\" and \"Evan Almighty\" confirmed him as one of the most beloved comedy stars in the business. His role in the comedy-drama \"Little Miss Sunshine\" showed how genuinely good his acting chops are (and \"The Big Short\" backs that up), and he gave a heart-breaking performance as the father of an addict in \"Beautiful Boy,\" with Timothée Chalamet as his son. But it was his dark, transformative turn in \"Foxcatcher\" that really signalled how talented Carell is. He is unrecognizable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKristen Wiig in 'Welcome to Me' (2014)\n\nRole: Alice Klieg\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"When Alice Klieg wins the Mega-Millions lottery, she immediately quits her psychiatric meds and buys her own talk show.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 74%\n\nSo many American comedy actors start off on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and Wiig certainly isn't the only person on this list to do so, but her \"SNL\" tenure led to \"Bridesmaids,\" which became a huge commercial and critical success and earned Wiig an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.\n\nThis led to Wiig being able to take on a greater variety of roles, including that of a mentally ill woman in \"Welcome to Me,\" a performance that the Rotten Tomatoes critics consensus says \"holds 'Welcome to Me' together and compensates for its uneven stretches.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeth Rogen in 'Steve Jobs' (2015)\n\nRole: Steve Jobs\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"'Steve Jobs' takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 86%\n\nThe multi-hyphenate behind movies like \"Superbad,\" \"Knocked Up,\" \"This is the End,\" and \"Sausage Party\" actually has some acting chops — and not the comic kind that is exemplified in \"Pineapple Express,\" but the dramatic kind shown in \"Steve Jobs.\"\n\nIt helps that Rogen is surrounded by a stellar cast including Kate Winslet, Jeff Daniels, Michael Stuhlbarg, and led by Michael Fassbender, but Rogen holds his own and masters the difficult Aaron Sorkin dialogue, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah Silverman in 'I Smile Back' (2015)\n\nRole: Laney Brooks\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"Laney Brooks does bad things. Married with kids, she takes the drugs she wants, sleeps with the men she wants, disappears when she wants. Now, with the destruction of her family looming, and temptation everywhere, Laney makes one last desperate attempt at redemption.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 50%\n\nAnother \"SNL\" alumni, Silverman had a successful stand-up career (and still does) including \"Jesus is Magic,\" before starring in her own sitcom \"The Sarah Silverman Program.\"\n\n\"I Smile Back,\" however, showed the opposite side of Silverman's skillset — and even if the film wasn't widely appreciated, her performance was (at least enough to get SAG nomination for best actress.)\n\nThe Rotten Tomatoes critics consensus reads: \"'I Smile Back' serves as a powerful showcase for Sarah Silverman's dramatic range, but fails to surround her committed performance with a movie worthy of its depth.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMelissa McCarthy in 'Can You Ever Forgive Me?' (2018)\n\nRole: Lee Israel\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"When Lee Israel falls out of step with current tastes, she turns her art form to deception.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 98%\n\nMelissa McCarthy is one of the few people to earn an Oscar nomination for an all-out comedy. She was given the nod for best supporting actress for \"Bridesmaids,\" which was unusual (but certainly not undeserved), considering the Academy's penchant for serious films and record for snubbing comedic movies.\n\nBut this nomination gave McCarthy's a career a huge boost, and she went on to star in \"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\" In this, McCarthy gave a layered, sad performance as a lonely, bitter, unlikeable woman who you can't help but pity and even root for. McCarthy thoroughly deserved the best actress nomination she got for this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdam Sandler in 'Uncut Gems' (2019)\n\nRole: Howard Ratner\n\nIMDB Synopsis: \"A charismatic New York City jeweler always on the lookout for the next big score makes a series of high-stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime. Howard must perform a precarious high-wire act, balancing business, family, and encroaching adversaries on all sides in his relentless pursuit of the ultimate win.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 92%\n\nLike Carrey, Sandler gained fame for a stellar stand-up career before churning out hit after hit of broad, slapstick comedies. These sorts of films led to a number of people disliking Sandler for his comedy movies, and won him nine Razzie awards.\n\nSandler did, however, earn good reviews for dramadies \"Funny People\" and Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Punch Drunk Love,\" suggesting that with the right material, he can be very good indeed.\n\nIn \"Uncut Gems,\" Sandler blews expectations out of the water. Taking on the sort of role that 1970s Al Pacino would have relished, Sandler is transformative and magnetic. He absolutely deserved to get an Oscar nomination for best actor, but didn't, and had to settle for an Independent Spirit Award win instead.\n\nThis film proves that Sandler is, in fact, an uncut gem himself: he's got incredible talent and skill, and in the right role, it's easy to see.\n\nRead next\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nAdvertisement"
