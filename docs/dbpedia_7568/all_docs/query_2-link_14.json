And I knew he was funny, so I was like, ha, ha, ha, ha, good see your legs. I realized just the other day. For some reason, I was remembering that and I realized I was wearing camouflage pants. And I think I didn’t get it because at the time, I knew they were called camouflage pants or camo pants, but I didn’t know what camouflage meant, or was used for. I just thought they were crazy pants. Anyway, to Chris […]. If you’re out there somewhere. I didn’t really get it, and now I do. And I just told Rory that we’re hiking. And he goes, I made up that joke in high school, and I was like, you may have but so did probably several other people.\n\nAmy 01:48\n\nYou saying that story reminded me that when you were at a light, something else that happened to you when you were younger, and that was the acting is.\n\nSarah Silverman 01:58\n\nReacting, I know I was at a light for that too.\n\nAmy 02:03\n\nAnd have you told that story? Because I think it’s so funny.\n\nSarah Silverman 02:06\n\nI think it’s in one of my specials, but I took an acting class and like fifth grade or something. And the teacher was you know, clearly this like bitter. You know, whatever, he’s teaching fifth graders like you’re either really psyched about it, love it, or you’re very bitter about it, and I think he was the latter looking back, but he was walking around us like acting is reacting. I was like reacting, like acting again. I knew what remained like re, like acting again when I didn’t really understand, and then, like 30 years later, I was at a light and I was like, oh reacting, right, yes, acting is reacting. You know, sometimes I think Rory thinks I’m being like condescending or something to him. When the truth is, I’m just in in some areas, really stupid. And he just takes it offensively because it’s not possible, I could be that stupid but it is stupid is not a nice word, but like I just, there’s a whole area of things. I don’t know. You know, I mean, we only know what we know, and as we get older, I think so many people are like, just pretend to they do know the things they don’t know because they’re ashamed that they don’t learn anything else. I guess it’s common because there’s that like, trope of now on social media like I was 20 years old when I […] Anyway, am I still talking? Let’s take some calls.\n\nRachel 04:01\n\nHi, Sarah. My name is Rachel. I live in Wisconsin with my partner and my dog, Georgie and Georgie and I listen to your podcast a lot. And we love it, and it keeps us happy, it’s really cold days like today where it’s negative six degrees outside. And we’re in here cozy with your voice and your listeners. So I love you and some of your co comedians like Tig Notaro, Maria Bamford. I love fortune Feemster and Mei Martin. I listened on a high on some podcast as well as all my friends and I’m wondering if all five of you would ever consider doing something together like either a live podcast show or a big Stand Up Show with all of you. I was recently watching the scene in Lady Dynamite where it’s you and Tig Notaro um, They’re by the pool, and that seems just so powerful because the three of you are so fucking funny together. So that’s my question. Love you lots and hope you’re doing well. And I’m sending love to you and Rory and your dog. Bye.\n\nSarah Silverman 05:16\n\nWell, I love all of those people, obviously. Tig and Maria and Fortune and Mae and you know, obviously Tig and fortune and Mae have their podcasts Handsome, which is they just started not long ago, and it’s so good. It’s just so fun. It just you just feel like you’re hanging out with them. And I, they just take questions from people, they don’t really have guests. And I was the first question on the first episode, which was, I believe, how, what is your process of washing your asshole? I have my own process, and I was curious about theirs. This funny that you brought up and I I’m just gonna have to tell the story because I brought it up. But I know I’ve told the story before. When Tig and I were shooting that scene for Lady Dynamite. We got in hair and makeup is very early in the morning. And we were waiting to shoot and I got a call that my mom had died. And it was not a shock. I knew she was, you know, it was like, I had just gotten to see her and she didn’t pass away, and I came back to LA and then she passed away that morning. And so it was It wasn’t like a shock, like, you know, but you know, my mom died, and I got off the phone, and I was sitting with Tig and I just I just said, my mom died. And then I just kind of like, like, whatever. And I said I don’t know what to do, or in hair and makeup and like, it’s not like I can get a flight until tonight anyway, we should just shoot the scene and she takes it Sarah, don’t be ridiculous. You’re not shooting the scene, we’re gonna like she just took care of everything. She’s like, she talked to the producers, whatever, they obviously were like, of course, we’ll, we’ll do a different scene, we’ll postpone the scene. She drove me home in my car and had someone follow us in her car drove me all the way home, turned on the ignition. And a song that was not playing. When I got out of the car suddenly came on it was Joni Mitchell blue, it was like bizarre. And she just took care of me and took care of the situation, then that’s what friends are. For me, it was I was so grateful. And you know, she had just lost her mom, like the year before, and she gave me just that great nugget of wisdom, which is listen, there are two kinds of people in the world. Those that have lost their mothers and those who have no idea what’s coming. And you know, as awful of as it was, it was a the greatest version of your mom dying because I had a great friend right there. And then, you know, God, I went home to New Hampshire. And I know I’ve told this whole story but and I was at her funeral and I it was a small funeral you know, and but and I I got up to speak and I didn’t I wasn’t like about to cry or anything and I looked out and I saw my friend Liz Winstead and and Hank Gallo she had just driven from New York City. She didn’t call me she didn’t email me she didn’t want to bother me. She just found out on Facebook, the details of the funeral and fucking showed up drove five hours and that made me cry. But um, yeah, what was the story? Oh, yeah. doing podcasts with comedian friends. Yeah, I would do that in a second or anything to hang out with them, I love them. I’ve done Fortunes podcast with Tom Papa bunch of times. Papa and Fortune. Yeah, I would do anything with them, we do shows together very you know, different combinations of the all those comics you mentioned. I love it. I love being a comic because doing shows in town especially, you know, we’re on the road a lot and we live these parallel lives. But when we do shows in town or festivals or if you’re, you know, it’s, you get to see all your friends and it’s it’s a good time. It’s really special, alright, what else?\n\nDevlin 09:49\n\nHi, Sarah. It’s your old pal Devlin in New York City. I often do feel like you’re my old pal because you’ve been a part of my life since I was watching School of Rock and a on a brand new VHS tape. And you’ve probably seen everything you’ve ever done since because you’re a total joy. Anyway, I’m finally calling into the podcast because I was so excited to hear you use that expression men’s liberation last week, you clarified that you didn’t mean that as like men’s rights or anything but more like people who are being called men being freed from the prison of masculinity, which is something I have experienced with, as you can probably tell by my voice. Anyway, that expression, men’s liberation got me to finally call in because I’m a queer historian. And I produce and host a podcast called Queer Cereal. And one of the topics that I covered was a gay rights activist named Jack Nichols, who was one of the first gay people to show their face on TV. And he was on CBS in the 60s. And he published a book in the 70s, called Men’s liberation, a new definition of masculinity. It was a super catchy title, because it sounded like oh, this men’s live book is going to teach me about my rights as a man. But then you start reading it and you’ll learn how men are kept very constrained by the rules of society with like, unspoken expectations for how men should behave. And then that’s why we end up having so much hate still in the world now. If only we could get a copy of that book and every politicians hands but I’m sure they don’t even read books. Anyway. I love you, I love the bed better. I can’t wait to see it again. I hope Bebe Neuwirth comes back to the show. Okay, love you Sarah, bye.\n\nSarah Silverman 11:17\n\nOh, um, I just want to write that down men’s liberation. That sounds amazing. I’m so I’m so curious about it. I’m so interested in it. I you know, it’s funny, I was thinking like, well, I want to talk about that, that’s really been on my mind, and I guess I did, but I my heart goes out to a lot of men, you know, at least in this country, you know, men are raised. And I think still, you know, a lot of most places to not have feelings, they feel they are not allowed to have feelings, that they’re not allowed to cry or be upset or be frightened or be worried in that, and what happens is their body just converts any feeling they have into anger, because anger is okay. Anger is a masculine emotion, and it’s just so fucked up. And it ruins the joy they could have in their lives, and I’ll be honest, it’s a it’s a real buzzkill for me too. So you know, the people that share this world with y’all, but, but my heart goes out to you, because that’s how they were raised. In society, you know, all of us have supported that have, you know, like, even like, throw like a girl and all that stuff that we’ve been fighting against is, is a part of that for them that, that these are our roles, and I’m this, and she’s that and we’re learning from the new generations that gender is a construct. I mean, yeah, there’s a there’s a vagina, or a penis, but in terms of gender, not sex at birth, but gender, and identity. It’s, it’s just this made up thing. It’s just this long, accepted definition of ourselves. And I think that the kids today, the kids today that reject that I find very inspiring and interesting. And I, you know, I have friends that I love to pieces that firmly roll their eyes at all that stuff. And I’m just totally into it. Because they’re like, there’s no way there’s this many, they’re just, it’s just popular. It’s just, you know, kids are cool, you know, it’s cool if they’re non binary, so they just do it. Alright, good, who cares? Why does that bother you? I’d rather have it be cool and more people identifying as non binary, then then what it will ultimately boil down to who cares? Why do you care? I’m happier that people are comfortable expressing themselves, and even venturing to figure out who they are to themselves, their own identity, whatever that looks like, not just, I mean, God, in my generation, beyond gender and that shit, but just literally, what we want in life was defined for us that it was a absolute gesture of, of rebellion, to not get married, to not have kids to realize what I want might be different from what the society tells me I’m supposed to want. And that’s not a defect in me, and in fact, I think if more people said, we’re expected to want to get married, we’re expected to want to have kids it’s that’s, that’s what humanity is, as, you know, we’re expected to, you know, I’m a comedian, so I must want to have a sitcom you know, even just like, very even in the most detailed minutia, that is your specific life. We have plotted out for us already. What our dreams are, what the way our life should, the way we should want our life to look. And that’s all bullshit, but to sit down and say, what do I want? What what do I even think I want? Maybe I’ll go towards that and realize no, I want this or want something else. That’s why it’s like with gender to see older people like roll their eyes. Oh, he’s they them now or whatever. Like, what do you give a fuck? So maybe he’ll be back to a he in 10 years? Or maybe it is a fad? Or maybe he’ll you know, like, it’s don’t fucking worry about it. You know, it’s just such an odd thing to you know, this is like, these are like the big dangers facing our country. According to the Republican Party, you know, it’s like, uh, have you looked in the mirror lately? I mean, are you fucking kidding me? It’s just roll with it, kid you know, like, anyway, I don’t know how I got here. But I’m going to check that out men’s liberation, the book by Jack Nichols, because I’m really interested in that, and I want to be an ally, to you, sis, straight men out there.\n\nPeyton 16:46\n\nHi, Sarah, my name is Peyton. I’m a new listener, and I think you give really good advice so here’s my dilemma. I just moved up to Indiana, where my grandparents have lived for close to 30 years. From South Mississippi. I’m 20 years old. And I’m thinking about going back to school. And I just feel stuck, you know, I moved away from the life I’ve always had in Mississippi, where I felt stuck there, and I feel stuck here and now and I’m super alone, you know, no friends. And I just, I’m tired of everything. I’m tired of life, you know, I just, I feel sad all the time. And I don’t know what to do. I want to do I want to be in the entertainment business like you and do things you do. And, you know, and do things with my life but I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to get there. I just feel stuck. And that’s the only thing I want to do. Yeah, and I see people I went to school with and they’re already doing things and it just makes me feel sad and pathetic. Because I’m not doing things like kids, I’m going to school with our but anyway, I love you. I love your show, thank you.\n\nSarah Silverman 18:16\n\nPayton Um, first of all, stop comparing yourself to other people stop looking at what people you went to college with are doing now. It’s first of all, it’s life is not a competition, you know, there’s just about your life and how you spend your days. If you have a dream, and you’re you seem to have some general kind of dream. All right, let’s go with it. Make a plan, a short term, a long term plan and the short term plans that will get you there and follow it. At some point you may find it’s not working for you and you’ll make a new plan. But as each day passes, that you do nothing to make your life happier. You know you’re responsible for your happiness, that’s really your number one responsibility. Do some thing every day that gets you closer to that. Whether it’s asking people questions, or getting a job so that you can support yourself so that you can do stuff at night that you really love or you know if if you said you want to do what I do. Do you want to be a comedian because boy, you know, there’s absolutely comedy in Indiana. I know Bloomington is a great town to be creative. You can find creative people and creative outlets anywhere you are. It doesn’t matter you know, you felt stuck in Mississippi you feel stuck In Indiana, the place isn’t the stuck part, that’s the “you” part. And you can change that. So you don’t have to focus about where you are. I’m not going to tell you, you should be in Hollywood because you want to be in showbusiness, no, stay near your grandparents, make some friends in Indiana, Indiana’s coolest shit. You know, go watch comedy. People come through Indiana all the time, go watch comedy goes to local comedy clubs, see what’s you didn’t even say you’re in to comedy, but any kind of art form or any kind of anything that might be amusing to you, or you might meet people? You know, I always say like, volunteering for a some sort of political candidate on the most local level or, or bigger levels, who knows? gets you into meeting like minded people, you know, being introduced to new ideas and new thoughts and, and having your own critical thought and saying, do I like this? Is this what I want? You know, so many people look to the right and left or look at their peers or look at the people they grew up with, and decide what they want in life based on what other people want in life. Who cares what Suzy fuckface wants in her life. All that matters is what Payton likes or is interested in, or might want to do or might want to learn more about. We’re so so often the things we aspire to aren’t even things we’ve even asked ourselves if we want to aspire to. It’s just what everyone wants, well, everyone wants to meet someone and get married and have kids and mobile what, do you? This is your life, it’s crucial that you design it as you see fit. And making a choice making a decision is just moving forward. It doesn’t have to be the right choice or the right decision. You know, I always think of that son move on from Sunday in the Park with George, which is just brilliant. Just listen to it, because it just talks about just moving on. Just making a choice. It doesn’t have to be the right one. It just moves you forward. You learn something new, oh, I didn’t like that, I don’t like that. It turns out I’m gonna go this way. But move, do something, go somewhere, take a walk. Don’t just sit in your house on your phone and let the days go by feeling stuck. Find a solution find the wrong solution. At least it gets you closer to narrowing down what Peyton likes in this world what Peyton wants in this world. It is a very stuck feeling tonight even know what you want. Try something, go for a walk, walk through the city. Look at other people. Observe the world around you and and wonder what you think of it. Don’t judge it, but just the more experiences you have, the closer you get to understanding yourself. I don’t know if that’s true, but it sounded smart. Alright, what else? Good luck.\n\nKaren 23:46\n\nHi, Sarah. I love your podcast. I love your attitude and your kindness and generosity towards people and the way you think about things. Very helpful. So I’m Karen, my question has to do with a text that I just recently got from my dad. I’ll see if I can read it out to you. He says, how’s your church going? Mine had to separate from their denomination because of doctrinal differences. They are ordaining homosexual pastors in California and rejecting biblical prohibitions about that. So we had to move away from that, but the Lord has blessed us for that decision by sending us new members. And I just responded back. Glad your congregation is doing well. So my question is, the next time I see him in person, because I’m I’m not having this conversation over text. When I see him in person, how should I handle this topic? And I love my dad. We see things very differently. I’m, and I suppose I want him to know that I respect him. But we’re, just on different sides. So how, how would you approach that? Anyways, thanks for listening, bye.\n\nSarah Silverman 25:18\n\nAh, I’ll just never understand people who certain people that follow Jesus and think that he would approve of hate, or not accepting people, and that was his whole vibe was inclusivity. I mean, it was his whole vibe, loving people just as they are. My question is, do you feel the need to talk to him about it? Because I’m guessing that he you’re not going to change his mind. And you want to just love him, you love him nyway, right? That’s what you’ve told me. And I think that’s beautiful. And actually, far more Jesus, like, than his church. If you really want to talk to him about it, or you want to just say your piece and not I don’t know, you may be something like, oh, Dad, we’re different. Like, boy, I would, I would leave my congregation if it wasn’t inclusive of all people so I guess we’re different in that way but hey, you want to get pizza tonight? You know, I don’t know, I don’t know, Dad, I believe God made gay people just like God made all the different people that make up our world and then move on, you know, if he argues with you, I mean, I think you’re not looking for an argument, right? Like, it’s very rare that you can change an older person’s mind, if they’re not open to it, you know, you can just go like, daddy, I’m not changing, you know, I’m not changing my mind, I’m not asking you to change your mind. Just letting you know that we feel differently about this, and I’m okay with that so I feel unfortunate, you know, I feel bad for you because I don’t see that as any fun way to live but should we get Chinese food? Or what do you want? I don’t know, I mean, listen, talk to him about it, don’t talk to him about it but keep your expectations wildly low. And be very grateful that you are not stuck in those that way of thinking, you know, and in that hopefully, this world is going to a much more progressive place, though. Not really sure of that. Um, all right, what else?\n\n27:44\n\nHi, Sarah. I just got a dog, and I’ve never had a dog before. And boy, do I love him. I am so excited to see him every morning when I get up and I think he makes me laugh more than any human ever has. I think it’s generally just his unbridled earnestness and enthusiasm for life but there are specific things like when he poops, he will like tap one of his back feet. And it almost looks to me like his leg is a crank. And when he’s tapping his foot, it’s helping him crank the poop out. Or he’s a chihuahua terrier, so when we first got him, he had these adorable, pointed, but floppy kind of a Doritos style ear, kind of like what Mary has. And then we woke up one morning and they were just sticking straight up. And it really changed to his outward personality but anyway, my question for you is, what are some things that your dogs do that make you laugh? Love ya.\n\nSarah Silverman 28:54\n\nWe always laugh at like, just the decisions they make, like Mary makes the way she makes decisions, I don’t know it really tickles us like, we’ll be on the couch, all four of us the two dogs and the two people like watching something on TV or whatever, and Mary is like all nestled in our lap or coiled in a ball like on a blanket or something. And she’ll just get up and go upstairs to go to bed and we’re just like, oh, goodnight, Mary. Like it just but I guess that’s normal, but it just it makes us laugh that she just like made a decision. Like when Mary will have like some dryness on her gums and her lip will like stick up above her tooth. That looks really funny, just the way both of them will demand being pat or having their bellies rubbed, is very funny. Just the way they communicate the things that they want is so interesting. You know, Sibi is an 80 pound dog who just jumps up on the bed and coils up on our laps like as if she were a seven pound dog. I don’t know. We love it, love those things, things animals. I mean, we take care of them. Sometimes I go Mary be free. We’re setting you free, it’s not fair for us to keep you any longer. And I just see where she goes and she just stays stands there like what are you doing? They really would not be okay on their own maybe Sebi but I don’t think so. They need to snuggle at night, wear their pack. And they’ve really started loving each other to like they sleep with their butts touching and it’s cute.\n\nAlly 30:46\n\nWhat up Sarah, it’s your best friend Ally. I have a question for you but first, I was just listening to your most recent episode, and you are talking about how you’re working on trying not to interrupt people more and cut people off and, man, that is definitely like a big thing for me that I’m trying to work on. I like the advice around just maybe not saying anything, I’m gonna take that one in and practice with it. My question for you is, I just had an amazing trip and vacation with friends who got married, and like 50 people stayed in a villa I knew maybe a third, but it was just like an incredible experience of love, and spaciousness and acceptance and beauty. And I’m wondering, what do you do to keep those like cherished memories alive? Do you have practices to revisit them or things you do to kind of help them sink in I’m spending a lot of time like, just thinking about it, but yeah, wondering how you preserve those really wonderful memories that make a lasting impression. Thanks, love you.\n\nSarah Silverman 32:01\n\nThere’s only so much you can do, it’s like in your memories, you know, but I’m really trying to take more pictures and videos. You know, I have so many pictures and so much video of my dad and my stepmother, I was just watching a bunch of it. And it made me so happy, and it was just so easy to just record on my phone during like a family zoom or when we’re all hanging out, and I really cherish it I, voicemails from them that I keep and I’m so grateful I have I mean, you know, I look back and it hurts my heart a little bit thinking of, you know, my mom was a photographer, and she was like the family historian and she was always like, everybody, everybody get on the street, you know, get out when she we’d go in the middle of the street we lived in, it wasn’t a busy street, it was like, in very rural New Hampshire, and take you know, take family pictures, and I’d always be like, Mom, oh, like, totally hated and get be so mad when she would insist on taking a picture before we all left or you know, we’re apart. And I fucking cherish those pictures. I’m so grateful for them. And it hurts my heart a little bit thinking how cunty I was as a kid and how impatient. And what also hurts my heart is that my mom is not in any of them, she took some and I have a feeling that’s a thing with moms, you know, or sometimes dads is they make sure to take these pictures and they’re, you’re ultimately so grateful for them, and you know, I don’t have a million pictures of my mom and I have like two videos of my mom. And I wish I had more. And I wish I took more pictures but all I can do is take more pictures now. And so I am I’m taking even you know from with friends and I maybe it’s embarrassing. I go I don’t care, we’re gonna want these one world these are archival, so just suck it up and and just take pictures, sometimes I don’t even know I have my glasses, I don’t even know if I’m taking good pictures, but I’m just trying to capture moments. Now you can’t totally live behind the camera because you want to also experience it, you know? And that was maybe a balance my mother didn’t have I don’t know but you know, it’s like when I see people when I see people taking pictures of fireworks. Like that is such an example to me. of people not experiencing the moment. You really think you’re gonna look back those pictures of fireworks and be glad you took pictures of fireworks? Fucking Google images fireworks. The thing about fireworks is supposed to be the experience which by the way, I don’t care for fireworks. I fucking hate the noise. I don’t know how you unring the bell. I don’t know how people can take in the information that fireworks cause massive PTSD to vets, freak out dogs, shooting victims PTSD. And still go, man yeah, no, I still want to light things on fire and make them explode. I just it’s I’ll never understand it. It doesn’t make you a patriot. Like you’re not more patriotic than me because you like making really loud surprising noises that fucking bomb people out. I just like to me, how can you hear that? Especially about vets are in dogs and then still want fireworks? It’s so bizarre anyway, I’m I really digressed. I think but I’m good memories, you know? Yeah, that’s all I can say. Try to record it, but don’t get in the way of recording it don’t be so behind the camera that you’re not enjoying the moment. It’s a balance of that, and also your memory and the senses. You know, there’s sense memory, so it’s like, you know, oh, we all went to this island and ba ba ba and I remember the smell of the bonfire. You know, like, I don’t know what I’m saying, but sometimes I’ll burn like, what’s it called Palo Santo. And it gives me like this kind of bonfire, vibe, camping kind of New Hampshire feeling and it makes me happy. So you know, their memories through your senses that you can kind of evoke. But you also just have to try to be in those special moments and not go, Oh, I’m gonna want to remember this. Oh, you know, like, what is that? That’s anxiety that’s thinking of the future and worrying that you’re not gonna remember this amazing moment that you’re already not enjoying, so obviously, there’s, there’s a balance, and that’s my answer I’m sticking to it. What else?\n\nAton 37:26\n\nHi, Sarah, I wanted to start out by saying thank you so much for the podcast I have really loved and enjoyed it. Listening from from the beginning so I think that you’re a really important voice in kind of guiding and moving conversations within our culture and being such a wonderful role model, and a voice for kindness and understanding. So thank you so much for all that you do. My question really involves the portrayal of therapists and counselors in entertainment. I am a licensed professional counselor. And I’ve found that I basically can’t watch any shows that feature therapists or counselors, because at best, they’re portrayed as incompetent and weird and bizarre. But more typically, they’re unethical and damaging. And it seems really troublesome to me. Because I think that it just adds to the stigma and discourages people to engage in therapy, and I think that’s a real disservice to people. A and I also think of some of your comments on the representation of Jewish women in particular in entertainment so I’d be very interested to hear your thoughts on that. And thanks again, for everything you do.\n\nSarah Silverman 38:55\n\nI didn’t really have an answer to this. I mean, you threw in Jewish women into demon in the last second, I don’t know how I can I mean, I you know, I yeah, sure. I don’t, I can’t think of like, if you named examples, like, for some reason, all I can think of is like the therapist in the sopranos, which, you know, brought the idea of therapy and into a very toxic masculinity-ish world and I think that’s a good thing, you know, but who knows, I you know, I’m not a therapist so maybe you feel represented in a negative or an enlightened way, I don’t know. There’s that show Shrinking that Brett Goldstein made with Harrison Ford and Jason Seagal. Alright, seagull. Okay, well, there’s lots of other things you can watch besides things that have therapists you feel are being poorly represented so that’s a good thing. Congratulations on that, there it you know, I asked Julie, I really liked this new season after all these years of that show in treatment with Uzo Aduba. Yeah, she is amazing in that I thought that was a really interesting representation of a therapist and therapy and, and humanity. I thought that was really interesting season, but yeah, besides that, I got nothing. All right, what else?\n\nAton 40:28\n\nAton, and I am from San Diego. And I was thinking about you a couple of nights ago and wondering what you thought about this. My son is into ASMR he’s only eight but he really likes listening to the ASMR sounds and the whispers and the talking. And I was listening with him and it was driving me crazy. Some of these noises and I thought oh my god, Sarah would go nuts. She could not handle this. So anyway, this was wondering if you’re familiar with ASMR if you’ve listened to it and if so it kind of gets gets you crazy, bye.\n\nSarah Silverman 41:09\n\nI expected ASMR to be my hell, but I kind of didn’t mind some of it. You know, I don’t know if Aton you know what kind of noises bother you? I’m not sure don’t have any nails. I just think that for some people, it’s very soothing maybe, maybe for your son. There’s something that is reminiscent of being in utero to have such a common voice. For me, it’s the mouth sounds in between the words like this. It makes me fucking sick. But in general, just the gentle tones and maybe the sound of a brush. Brushing against some fabric or some very long hard nails. Tip tapping I don’t know. I don’t know. It’s interesting though, Aton is this annoying to your ears? And Dad, can you believe it? First of all, Dad, I miss you so much, I just ache for you lately and I can’t stand it but I am okay.
