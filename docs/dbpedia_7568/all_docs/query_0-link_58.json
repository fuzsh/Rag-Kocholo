        "text": "Kevin Hart is a Philly-born former shoe salesman who has become one of the funniest actor-comedians in America today. He has appeared in films such as the Jumanji franchise, Get Hard and Central Intelligence. A lot of his material usually drawn from his personal experiences with family, friends and loved ones. Don't miss your chance to catch him live as he heads to a venue near you!\n\nEmmy-Award winner Hannah Gadsby is a name you should probably know, or if you don't you will soon enough! Hannah Gadsby took the comedy world by storm with her Award-winning show entitled Nanette. A sold-out Edinburgh Fringe run and multiple Netflix specials later, Hannah Gadsby returns to the road for a North American tour following her fourth special with Netflix from 2024, the Gender Agenda, which united gender queer comedians from around the world.\n\nSarah Silverman embarks on her brand new US tour, 'Sarah Silverman: Postmortem'. She may have become known for her no-holds-barred exploration of taboo subjects, but an incisive and brave performer lives underneath all that controversy. She rose through the stand-up ranks in the 00s, and created her own eponymous Comedy Central show, The Sarah Silverman Program. Be warned though - no subject is taboo for this leading comedian!\n\nAmerican film and television actor, comedian and bona fide eye candy indulgence Dane Cook is back on the road with the Fresh New Flavor Tour! The American Gods star is one of the country's most popular comedians, with a guy-next-door attitude that serves to expand his comedy with many audiences. Don't miss him as he continues to dominate stages and bring hilarious memories for all who attend.\n\nHe's back! Eddie Griffin returns to the stage this fall from Las Vegas to New York with his unique perspective of the world around him, his life, politics, religion and whatever else strikes his fancy. He has been listed as one of the top one hundred comedians of all time - and honestly, it is time you took the time to see him live on stage! It is all right if you don't know him for his comedy because you have likely seen or heard of him in a different media.\n\nMartin meets Martin in this extraordinary meeting of two of modern comedy's greatest entertainers. Steve Martin and Martin Short present 'You Won't Believe What They Look Like Today', a Q&A style conversation between the two comedians and the audience with a musical twist. Expect an evening of banjo-tinged interludes and singing punctuated by the side-splitting humor and charisma of these comedy greats."
