        "text": "Sarah Silverman offered a sincere tribute to the late Joan Rivers during The Hollywood Reporter’s annual Women in Entertainment breakfast on Wednesday morning.\n\n“Joan Rivers was not done,” said Silverman, speaking of her longtime friend and comedic contemporary. “At 81, she lived a life that could jam-pack ten lifetimes. She wasn’t the average person. She wasn’t done. She left us unfinished.”\n\nRead More Bonnie Hammer Tops THR’s 2015 Women in Entertainment Power 100 List\n\nSilverman was on hand to introduce Rivers’ daughter Melissa — but with her sudden September death still on many of the guests’ minds, Silverman also had her own words on Rivers’ career.\n\n“She once said she didn’t find her comedic voice until she was 70,” Silverman reflected. “And I love that. The only thing that was going to stop Joan Rivers was death. Touche death, and f— you very much. … It kills me that she was never seen as the actress she was. I know that it meant something to her. This is a woman who was banned from the Tonight Show for the crime of getting her own show.”\n\nSilverman also offered some insight into a recent interaction with Rivers — a 2013 episode of her web series, In Bed With Joan. Silverman was actually the first guest on the talk show.\n\n“I once went to Melissa’s house to shoot Joan’s web series, and Joan made me hide in her closet until she introduced me,” said Silverman. “In her closet was this hideous coat. I said Joan, this is the ugliest coat I’ve ever seen. … My punishment for not appreciating her coat was she gave it to me. … I cherish that coat because she’s right. It’s beautiful.”\n\nThe event was presented by Lifetime and sponsored by Gucci, Samsung Galaxy, Audi, Roberto Coin and Gersh."
