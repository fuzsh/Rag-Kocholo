She was renowned for her acerbic wit, flamboyant style, and her trailblazing endeavors in the entertainment industry. Her career spanned over five decades, during which she established herself as a formidable force in a field predominantly dominated by men. Rivers began her career in the late 1950s, performing stand-up routines in comedy clubs around Greenwich Village. Her big break came in 1965 when she appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. This appearance catapulted her into the national spotlight, setting the stage for a remarkable career that encompassed television, film, theater, and literature. Rivers was also recognized for her stint as the first female late-night television host on Fox's The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers. Throughout her career, Rivers faced numerous personal and professional challenges, but she remained unflinchingly resilient. She was known for her sharp-tongued humor, often self-deprecating and controversial, which endeared her to some and alienated others. Despite the polarizing nature of her comedic style, Rivers's impact on the entertainment industry is undeniable. She received a Grammy Award nomination for her comedy album, won a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host, and posthumously received a Grammy for Best Spoken Word Album. Joan Rivers passed away in 2014, leaving behind a legacy as one of the most influential comedians in American history.\n\nRobin Williams was an American actor and comedian who left an indelible mark on Hollywood.

Born Edward Regan Murphy on April 3, 1961, in Brooklyn, New York, he faced a challenging childhood marked by his parents' divorce when he was just three years old and the death of his father five years later. However, these hardships only fueled his passion for performance. As a teenager, Murphy honed his skills at the Roosevelt Youth Center, where he dazzled audiences with his comedic impressions. It wasn't long before his talent was recognized, and at the age of 19, he joined the cast of the renowned television show Saturday Night Live.

Subsequent roles in hits like Trading Places (1983), Beverly Hills Cop (1984), and Coming to America (1988) solidified Murphy's status as a box office sensation.

His early work included several television appearances and stand-up specials, but it was his role as the host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central that catapulted him into the international spotlight.

His distinctive humor and conversational style have not only entertained millions but also significantly shaped the landscape of modern talk shows. From his early days as a weatherman and radio talk show host in his hometown, Letterman showed signs of the unique comedic voice that would later become his trademark.
