        "text": "TV Weekend: Lifetime Achievement Award for Steve Martin\n\nWEEKEND’S MUST-SEE: “AFI Life Achievement Award,” 10 p.m. today, TBS, rerunning at 11:30.\n\nAny tribute show is brightened when Steve Martin arrives as a presenter. Now comes the ultimate, with Martin as the recipient; he’ll speak last, after lots of funny friends.\n\nThe ceremony was June 4, leaving the tough job of cutting it in half for this slot. There were old-timers – Mel Brooks, 88, Carl Reiner, 90 – plus Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Steve Carell and Sarah Silverman. Martin Short sang – so did Diane Keaton and Queen Latifah – and did 10 minutes of Martin-mocking.\n\nWEEKEND’S MIGHT-SEE: Basketball, 8 p.m. Sunday, ABC.\n\nThings return to the Golden State home court, where the Warriors – in the finals for the first time in 40 years – are hungry for a win after tying the series, 2-2, with a blow-out win over Cleveland on the Cavaliers home court. After having the NBA’s best regular-season record, Draymond Green’s team breezed through the play-offs ... until colliding with LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThat’s part of a sports-stuffed weekend. Tonight has baseball on Fox (7 p.m.) and hockey on NBC (8).\n\nWEEKEND’S ALTERNATIVE: “Game of Thrones” season-finale, 9 p.m. Sunday, HBO (rerunning at 11:31) and/or “Lord of the Rings” films, both days, TNT.\n\nHollywood has finally learned how to tell epic stories – strong on action and special effects – that also seem smart. One example is “Thrones”: On Sunday, Stannis’ army is on the march and Daenerys – fresh from her first dragon ride – is surrounded by strangers.\n\nThen there are Peter Jackson’s films. Today has the “Rings” finale (2003) at 2:30 p.m. and “Hobbit” (2012) at 7; Sunday has the “Rings” trilogy (8 a.m., 11:45 a.m., 3:30 p.m.), with “Hobbit” at 8.\n\nALSO TODAY:\n\n• “The Whispers,” 8 p.m., ABC. Before catching the third epispode (10 p.m. Monday), try this excellent rerun. It hints that the kids don’t really have an imaginary friend; it may be the amnesiac “John Doe.”\n\n• “In an Instant,” 9-11 p.m., ABC. Eight years ago, an eight-lane Minneapolis bridge collapsed over the Mississippi River; 13 people were killed and 145 were injured. Skillfully mixing first-person accounts, re-enactments and brief news footage, this film tells of mistakes, heroics and makeshift solutions.\n\n• “Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell” debut, 10 p.m., BBC America. Back in 1806, this seven-week miniseries says, England – the land of Merlin – had forgotten about magic. Then the reclusive Mr. Norrell and the charismatic Jonathan Strange stirred excitement and danger.\n\n• “Saturday Night Live,” 11:29 p.m., NBC. Martin Freeman, the “Hobbit” star, hosts this rerun, with Charli XCX as the music guest.\n\nALSO SUNDAY:\n\n• “The Simpsons,” 8 p.m., Fox. Lisa writes a town anthem; also, Homer’s new cause is “wide pride.”\n\n• “The Crimson Wing” (2008), 8-10 p.m., NatGeo Wild. Tanzania’s Lake Natron might seem desolate; it dries up so quickly that salt islands remain. Somehow, flamingos decide that’s the perfect place to court, to mate and to hatch their babies. “Wing” is from Disney’s splendid nature-film series, which finally has a TV home with NatGeo. This one is sometimes funny and often gorgeous.\n\n• “A.D.,” 9 p.m., NBC. After a perilous start, this new Christian religion is making progress. James strikes a compromise with Caiaphas, the Jewish leader ... Paul gains followers after he resurrects Tabitha ... and the Ethiopian backer of the Zealot army converts to Christianity."
