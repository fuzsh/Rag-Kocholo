This photograph.\n\nYou've never had a bigger fan than I,\n\nand I know, there are people who say that they were,\n\nbut it was me.\n\nAnd, so I used to just always say--\n\nNext to myself, of course.\n\nThat's true (laughs).\n\nOn three, everybody!\n\nHey Judd.\n\n[Everybody] Hey Judd.\n\nSo I used to always say to my grandmother\n\nwhen I visited California,\n\non the way, let's drive by Steve Martin's house.\n\nWe didn't ever think we would see you.\n\nWe just, that was the route.\n\nAnd I had a policy at that time,\n\nthat I would not sign autographs at the house,\n\n'cause it would just lead to a flow\n\nof people ringing my doorbell.\n\nBut you were just out in the front yard,\n\nso I ran up, and I said, Mister Martin,\n\ncan I have your autograph?\n\nAnd very politely, you said that,\n\nno I'm sorry, I don't sign autographs at my home,\n\nand then, I said, will you sign it in the street?\n\n(Steve laughs) And I thought that was\n\npretty good for 12, 13 years old.\n\nThat is pretty good. And you said, no seriously,\n\nI really can't 'cause then people will come\n\nby the house all the time.\n\nRight here, we have Judd Apatow's house (laughs)\n\nI know it's 7:00 a.m.\n\nAnd then I got back in the car,\n\nand I was just thrown, I couldn't understand your logic.\n\nIsn't it great to be here?\n\nHe'll sign your book, he'll take your picture with you.\n\nSo I took out a piece of paper,\n\nand I wrote, dear Mister Martin, I am your biggest fan.\n\nBut I think that you treat your fans like shit.\n\n[Steve] Oh really?\n\nAnd I said, I've bought all of your books,\n\nand albums, and gone to all your movies,\n\nand you wouldn't live in that house if I didn't pay\n\nfor everything you've ever done.\n\nAnd if you don't send me an apology,\n\nI will send your address to Homes of the Stars,\n\nand you're gonna have tour busses passing by,\n\n24 hours a day.\n\nI had a book out at the time, so I autographed the book.\n\nI said, sorry Judd, I didn't realize\n\nyou were the Judd Apatow.\n\nWhich is, this is prophetic!\n\nThat's right! The Judd Apatow.\n\nBecause you did become the Judd Apatow.\n\nHe's one of the hot comedy directors (laughs).\n\nI often think of the impact of this.\n\nI thought, if I can make him laugh enough\n\nthat he's gonna like write this joke, and send me this book,\n\nmaybe I could do this.\n\nAnd now, you've not only, you've surpassed your prophecy.\n\nWell thank you very much\n\nfor doing this today. Okay, thank you.\n\nAlright.\n\nSealed with a kiss. That's right.\n\n(energetic jazzy music)"
