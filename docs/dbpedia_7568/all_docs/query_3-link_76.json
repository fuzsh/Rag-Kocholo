During that time, she has advised executives on strategies for growing into new markets, pivoting to new sectors, and turning around failing organizations. She has also assisted with the development of state policies that transform teacher and leader preparation, evaluation, and training; led development of a national birth-through-workforce data dashboard; and facilitated coalitions to advance bipartisan policy solutions.\n\nAs a Senior Vice President at Whiteboard Advisors, she is responsible for collaborating with clients to build tools that address critical challenges in education and wellness, as well as providing sector expertise on public policy developments and trends. She leads development of innovative strategies for expanding access to services and tools that help make education more effective and efficient and assists companies and organizations building education tools to reach the markets where they are needed most. Recently, she co-authored A Leak in the Pipeline and Bridging the Gap, research reports on trends in recruiting and hiring of educators and the state of professional learning for U.S. educators relative to quality indicators in new federal legislation.\n\nPrior to joining Whiteboard Advisors, Sarah led the National Governors Association Education Division’s work on early care and K-12 education systems. Previously, she advised states and districts on performance management and teacher evaluation policy reform at The New Teacher Project (TNTP).
