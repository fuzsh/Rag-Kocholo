In her first starring role, that sparkle is gone.\n\n“I Smile Back,” stars Silverman as Laney, a suburban wife and mother who struggles with depression, reckless behavior and addiction. Within the first first 20 or so minutes of Adam Salky’s harrowing drama, based on the 2008 novel by Amy Koppelman, Laney goes on a drug and alcohol fueled rampage that causes her husband (Josh Charles) to check her into rehab. Silverman is astonishing in the role, fearless in her portrayal of a woman on the verge of self destruction.\n\nIt was oddly more difficult than I thought. I had really convinced myself, “I can still have belly laughs and have a fun time, and then they call ‘Action!’ and I do my thing, and then they call ‘Cut!’ and I can be silly.” And it really isn’t that way. So much is brought to the surface, and there’s just so much stuff and then they’d call “cut” and instead I would just be like, “Why isn’t there coffee? This is a fucking movie set!” You know what I mean?\n\nThe director was like “You weren’t cunt-y, you were great!” And I was like, “No, no, no,” but I could feel myself like funneling these kind of sad, scary, lonely, anxious, depressive feelings, and kind of funneling them into rage or dissatisfaction. There are so many people with misplaced anger, and this was like four weeks of that, of like just not knowing where to put it, you know, when “Cut!” is called.\n\nI have. But I blame my own laziness for that. Because most things I’ve done I’ve written myself or created a lot. And, you know, you look at “Bridesmaids,” and it’s like, you can do anything if you’ve got the goods, and you can write it, and you’re brilliant. So I’m not going to sit here and be like, “I was pigeonholed and playing the bitchy girlfriend.” That was just what was coming my way, and I didn’t write any movies for myself.\n\nBut yeah, first of all, women comics and Jewish comics, Jewish actresses… all that whole combination equals sassy friend or bitchy girlfriend, but that stuff is all changing, and I don’t blame anybody but myself, because we’re responsible for our own happiness, aren’t we?"
