        "text": "If Smith had slapped a white comedian, like Steve Martin or Sarah Silverman, he would have been hauled off the stage and escorted out of the Dolby theater. Physically if need be. He would have still won the Oscar, but the academy wouldn’t have allowed him to give an acceptance speech, and the audience wouldn’t have been subjected to the narcissistic, self-serving ramble Smith gave. They may have even rescinded the Oscar per a review had Smith hit a white person.\n\nWill Smith didn’t hit a white person. He struck another Black man. He slapped him down, humiliated him, turned around with a smirk, sauntered back to his front-row seat, and shouted profanities at Rock. All with no consequence. It was an assault. Textbook. One human being attacking another human being.\n\nWe haven’t come very far when the color of someone’s skin determines whether they are worthy of defending.\n\nNo one came to Rock’s aid (apparently the LAPD talked to Rock back stage following the attack, told him it was battery and asked if he’d like to press charges. Rock declined)."
