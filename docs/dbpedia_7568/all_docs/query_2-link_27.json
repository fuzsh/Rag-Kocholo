One year, she helped to host an AFI honors ceremony. After the awards show, she went to an afterparty at Steve’s house.\n\nThe idea was to have cocktails and dinner. Sarah was toasting with legends. Diane Keaton, Martin Short, Candace Bergen, Nancy Meyers.\n\nMartin Short, acting as a sort of host, was asking questions to get conversation going.\n\n“So Candace,” he said, “when did you first meet Steve?”\n\n“Well, I remember I was hanging out with Lorne and Paul, and Steve didn’t know what prosciutto was!”\n\nAnd then Steve, immediately, goes, “Can you believe it? And now I drive one!”"
