Carl always made our special evening a family affair, like going to your favorite uncle’s house – if your uncle happened to be a comedic genius. He did it all with heart and passion as we celebrated our shared love for the craft of directing together. It’s a legacy we continue to keep alive today.\n\nFor all these reasons and so many more, it was with great joy and deep respect for his many contributions to our members and industry that we bestowed upon Carl the DGA Honorary Life Membership Award in 2007. We will forever hold him in the highest regard. Our hearts are with Rob and the entire Reiner family.\n\nSAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris:\n\nA comedic genius behind the scenes and in front of the camera, Carl Reiner was a beloved entertainer who leaves behind iconic partnerships with Mel Brooks, Sid Caesar and Dick Van Dyke.

Our hearts go out to his children, Rob, Sylvia Anne and Lucas.\n\nChuck Lorre & ‘Two and a Half Men’ Cast Pay Tribute To Chuck Lorre\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nCoronavirus: New U.S. Cases Near All-Time High; California, Florida and Texas See Record Spikes- Update\n\nCoronavirus: Movies That Have Halted Or Delayed Production Amid Outbreak\n\nHong Kong Filmart Postponed Due To Coronavirus Fears; Event Moves Two Weeks Before Toronto"
