        "text": "In 2005, A.O. Scott, co-chief film critic for The New York Times, panned “Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic,” which was based on her one-woman show and involved taboo-breaking jokes about a range of topics including race. Suggesting Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor as reference points, our reviewer wrote, “She depends on the assumption that only someone secure in his or her own lack of racism would dare to make, or to laugh at, a racist joke, the telling of which thus becomes a way of making fun simultaneously of racism and of racial hypersensitivity.”\n\nThe critique “hit me hard,” Silverman later said, and led her to take another look at her act.\n\nIt’s rare that a review has that kind of effect, and as part of a series of wide-ranging conversations Scott is having with artists, he and Silverman recently sat down via video call to discuss that moment and why admitting you’re wrong (as Silverman asked our critic to do as well) can be freeing. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nA.O. SCOTT I want to start out talking about our strange history because it really is a unique event in my life as a critic: Somebody I wrote about in a critical way responded by engaging it and taking it seriously. It almost always happens that people ignore it completely, or if I said something nice, they were happy about it, or maybe they get defensive and push back. But in like 25 years of writing criticism, no one has ever done what you did and I’ve thought about it for a long time.\n\nI was impressed with your response, but I also felt bad. Because when I look back, I feel now I was singling you out for something that was bothering me that was going on in comedy and elsewhere in popular culture. It wasn’t entirely fair of me to scold you the way I did.\n\nAnd it’s gotten me thinking over the years about some of the challenges both of doing comedy and of writing criticism: You’re supposed to be honest, and you’re supposed to tell the truth and not worry about giving offense. On the other hand, what you do, what I do has a risk of hurting people. So I wanted to talk about that, about comedy and your own work and your sense of it is now.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
