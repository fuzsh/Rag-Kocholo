        "text": "Hollywood, Calif. — Sarah Silverman, during the first test run of her new political variety show, “I Love You, America,” introduced a nude couple in the front row. Next was a generic white male host behind a desk to her right, a familiar face, she said pointedly, for audiences to look to when things get uncomfortable.\n\nBut they weren’t the most surprising supporting players on this studio set, which looked like a cross between a roadside diner and an upscale thrift store. That may have been a Trump voter, part of a group of ordinary people interviewed by Ms. Silverman, a liberal comedian who spoke at the Democratic National Convention last year. Asked about his support for the president, he explained that Mr. Trump had fewer scandals than Hillary Clinton. Ms. Silverman cringed and the crowd murmured, anticipating a sharp comeback. Instead, she smiled politely and moved on.\n\nIs this really Sarah Silverman?\n\n“You’ve never changed someone’s mind by arguing,” she said the next day, sitting on a couch in her office watching footage from the show, which will have its premiere on Hulu on Oct. 12. “Or facts. Facts don’t change people’s minds, as crazy as that sounds.”\n\nMs. Silverman, 46, one of the greatest stand-up comics of her generation, pioneered a swaggeringly feminine brand of raunchy, button-pushing humor that paved the way for comics like Amy Schumer and Ali Wong. In recent years, she has pivoted from this style, embracing a more earnestly engaged voice. With this new show she moves even further away, risking alienating her fans and experimenting with the limits of political comedy in the Trump era. In this increasingly divisive moment, is there an audience for a comedy show that aims for common ground?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
