        "text": "By Martyn Taylor\n\nMary Rose Tudor, born in 1496, youngest sister of Henry VIII went on to become Queen of France, via an arranged marriage to the aged Louis XII at the tender age of 18; according to contemporary accounts she was quite a looker. Louis died just after three months marriage, albeit with a smile on his face! As a widowed queen, Mary was a valuable asset and so Henry dispatched a trusted courtier, Charles Brandon over to France to retrieve her.\n\nCharles had been brought up in the Tudor household as his father killed at the battle of Bosworth was Henry VII’s standard-bearer. Though no impropriety is known between Mary and Charles unbeknown to Henry, Mary had her eye on him and the upshot of it was all she married Charles reminding Henry she married Louis for duty but married for love this time! Henry incandescent with rage could have had both executed for marrying without his permission but they were eventually forgiven.\n\nThe couple now styled as the Duke and Duchess of Suffolk, lived at Westhorpe literally holding court in a pavilion when they visited Bury Fair. Mary however preferred to remind people of her royal status. They had three children survive infancy, one of these, Frances, would be the mother of the ill-fated Lady Jane Grey. Mary dogged by ill health, succumbed to the Tudor Curse, the sweating sickness, possibly tuberculosis, in 1533. Her lavish funeral, a huge cortege with French heralds was the last great event at the abbey church prior to the dissolution in 1539."
