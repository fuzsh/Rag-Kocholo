        "text": "This article analyses the main traits of reception of Latin (Roman Catholic) Christendom in Kievan Rus', drawing from the notion of its confessional »otherness« in relation to the Eastern Orthodox norm. The mentioned reception is studied according to the East Slavic narrative sources written at the end of the eleventh and beginning of the twelfth centuries, i.e., directly after the »Great Schism« (1054) between Constantinople and Rome. The author of this article accentuates the complexity of the Rus' attitude towards Latin Christians on various levels: 1) upholding the official Orthodoxy, following the Byzantine doctrinal themes as adopted in Church Slavic polemical literature, while, simultaneously, 2) respecting practical considerations of dynastic ties between the East Slavic political elite and ruling families of the neighbouring Latin world, 3) and venerating particular Latin saints. In this respect, special consideration is given to the travel diary on the Holy Land titled Life and Pilgrimage of Daniel, the Hegumen of the Land of Rus', serving as a prime example of encountering confessional differences. Daniel's Pilgrimage is placed within the political and cultural context after the First Crusade during the Frankish rule over Palestine; it brings some valuable testimonies about the »Latin-Greek« relations in the Kingdom of Jerusalem as perceived by an educated ecclesiastical traveller, himself originating from an Eastern Orthodox environment. Daniel's thematization of his confessional »other« in the Holy Land reveals a similar ambiguity in the case of Rus' itself: on a declarative level, the polemical writings of the Kievan metropolitans testify about a negative position on the »Latin heresies«; on the other hand, common veneration of particular saints, such as Olaf of Norway or Magnus of Orkney, and decisions of the East Slavic princes confirm the permanence of intercultural contacts and pragmatic willingness to cooperate with the neighbouring Catholic polities (Sweden, Poland, Hungary) in forming dynastic marriages and military alliances.\n\nLatin Constantinople in the 1240s and 1250s has often been considered a ripe fruit waiting to fall into the hands of one of the competing political entities in the region (Nicaea, Epiros, Bulgaria, etc.). This paper argues, on the contrary, that under Emperor Baldwin II (1240-1273) the Latin Empire remained a dynamic power in the post-1204 Byzantine world. The basis for this re-evaluation is a revisionist study of the genealogical relations between a number of leading families in the region (among others the Villehardouin, Da Verona, and Cayeux), creating networks both within Latin Romania and beyond. One of the main hypotheses advanced is that two Serbian queens – Stefan Nemanja’s third wife Anna (of Hainaut) and Stefan Uroš I’s wife Helena (Angelos/ Courtenay) – were in fact what one might call Latin imperial princesses. This in turn leads to a reconsideration of Latin-Serbian relations in the period 1204-1261.\n\nOn the basis of both normative and narrative sources, this study examines whether or not Latin Christian brides who married into the ruling clan of Rus' in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries were renamed and/or re-baptised. It suggests that while brides who married into the ruling clan of Rus' might have received an additional name of an Orthodox saint through the ritual of anointing, there is no way of knowing whether or not anointing was performed on a regular basis. It also suggests that a Latin Christian bride may have retained two names after her marriage in Rus': her natal name and an Orthodox saint's name in conformity with the practice of double-naming among newly converted elites in Poland, Rus', Hungary, and Scandinavia. Finally, the study examines the possibility that the eastern-rite ritual of chrismation could have been misinterpreted by Latin Christian observers as re-baptism. The article concludes by examining seven specifi c case studies of individual Latin Christian brides who were allegedly renamed in pre-Mongol Rus' and demonstrates that, in each of these cases, evidence for their respective renaming is lacking."
