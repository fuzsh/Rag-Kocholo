Challenged by his cousin Sviatopolk I Grand Prince of Kiev, following the latter's accession in Kiev, he defeated Sviatopolk at Liubech [1016] and forced him to flee to Poland, succeeding as IAROSLAV I \"Mudriy/the Wise\" Grand Prince of Kiev.\n\nSviatopolk returned in Jul 1018 with an army led by his father-in-law, Bolesław I King of Poland, and defeated Iaroslav at the Western Bug and forced him to retire to Novgorod. Sviatopolk entered Kiev again 14 Aug 1018 and resumed his rule.\n\nAfter King Bolesław returned to Poland, Iaroslav advanced once more on Kiev. Sviatopolk fled south to raise another force with the Pechenegs but was finally defeated by the river Alta in 1019, when Iaroslav resumed power in Kiev[140].\n\nIn 1024, his half-brother Mstislav Prince of Tmutorokan moved his headquarters north to Chernigov to challenge Iaroslav, whom he defeated at Listven. The half-brothers agreed a division of territories, Iaroslav taking the land on the western bank of the Dnieper including Kiev and Novgorod.\n\nWhile Iaroslav was absent in Novgorod, the Pechenegs laid siege to Kiev, but were defeated after Iaroslav returned with a formidable army to relieve the siege[141].\n\nHe succeeded in the territories of his half-brother Mstislav on the latter's death in 1036, becoming sole ruler or \"Autocrat of the land of the Rus\"[142].\n\nHis greatest project was the conquest of Constantinople but his armies were defeated in decisive battles in 1043[143].\n\nHe supervised the rapid expansion of the city of Kiev, modelled on Constantinople. His law code Rus'ka Pravda also contributed to the development and consolidation of his administration especially in the area around Kiev, although it appears to have had little impact in the north[144].\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the death of Iaroslav 19 Feb 1054 at Vyshgorod aged 76 and his burial place[145]. He left a testament dividing his territories between his sons, the substance of which is recorded in the Primary Chronicle[146] although no original text has survived.\n\n[m firstly ---. The fact of Iaroslav´s first marriage is indicated by the chronology of his oldest son, although as noted below no primary source has yet been identified which refers to this oldest son. Nevertheless, Iaroslav´s birth date, if accurate as shown above, does suggest that an earlier marriage is likely.]\n\nm [secondly] (1019) INGIGERD Olafsdottir of Sweden, daughter of OLOF \"Skotkonung\" King of Sweden & his wife Estrid of the Obotriten ([1000/03]-10 Feb 1050).\n\nAdam of Bremen names \"filius Iacobus et filia Ingrad\" as the children of \"Olaph rex Sueonum\" & his wife Estred, specifying that Ingrad married \"rex sanctus Gerzlef de Ruzzia\"[147]. Her birth date range is estimated based on the birth of her oldest child in 1020, and her youngest known child in [1036]. Morkinskinna names “Queen Ingigerđr the daughter of King Óláfr the Swede” as wife of “King Yaroslav [of] Russia”[148]. Snorre records the betrothal of \"Ingegerd the king's daughter\" and \"King Jarisleif…from Russia\"[149]. The Historia Norwegie records the marriage of \"sororem Olaui Sueonensis…Margaretam\" and \"rex Iarezlafus de Ruscia\" at her brother's instigation, after her betrothal to Olav of Norway was terminated[150]. It is more probable that she was the daughter rather than sister of King Olof if it is correct that she had ten children by her husband.\n\nShe is referred to as IRINA in Russian sources[151].\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the death of \"the Princess wife of Yaroslav\" 10 Feb [1048/50][152].\n\nGrand Prince Iaroslav & his first wife had one child:\n\n1.

The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Anna filia Georgii regis Sclavonum\" as wife of King Henri[177].\n\nShe was consecrated Queen Consort at Reims on her wedding day.\n\nQueen Anna caused a scandal in France by her second marriage and was forced to leave the court, although she returned after his death in 1074[178].

He was consecrated associate-king 14 May 1027, at Notre-Dame, Reims, despite the opposition of his mother.\n\nHe rebelled against his father, together with his brother Robert, 1029-1031, and captured Dreux, Beaune and Avallon[221]. He succeeded his father in 1031 as HENRI I King of France, at which time the duchy of Burgundy was given to his younger brother Robert.\n\nIn light of his mother’s continuing opposition to his succession, he was obliged to take refuge briefly in Normandy in 1033. He regained control with the help of Robert II Duke of Normandy.\n\nThe Annales Nivernenses record the death \"1060 II Non Aug\" of \"Henricus rex, Rotberti regis filius\"[222]. The necrology of the Eglise Cathédrale de Paris records the death \"IV Non Aug\" of \"Henrici regis Francorum\"[223]. The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"II Non Aug\" of \"Henricus rex\"[224]. The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records the death 4 Aug of \"Henricus rex Franciæ\"[225].\n\nBetrothed (May 1033) to MATHILDE of Germany, daughter of Emperor KONRAD II King of Germany & his wife Gisela of Swabia ([Oosterbecke] 1027[226]-Worms 1034, bur Worms Cathedral).\n\nWipo names \"filia imperatoris Chuonradi et Giselæ, Mahthilda\" when recording her death and burial at Worms in 1034, specifying that she was betrothed to \"Heinrico regi Francorum\"[227]. Her marriage was arranged to confirm a peace compact agreed between King Henri and Emperor Konrad at Deville in May 1033[228]. Her absence from the list of deceased relatives in the donation of \"Chuonradus…Romanorum imperator augustus\" to the church of Worms by charter dated 30 Jan 1034 suggests that Mathilde died after that date, while her absence from the list of the children of Emperor Konrad named in the same charter is explicable on the basis of her youth[229].\n\nm firstly (1034) MATHILDE, daughter of --- ([1025/26]-Paris 1044, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis).\n\nRodolfus Glaber records that King Henri married \"Mathildem…de regno eius ex Germanie nobilioribus\"[230]. Her precise origin is not known.

Jaroslav and Ingegard had nine children, several of whom were married to royalty: Anastasia to Andrew I of Hungary, Elisabeth to Harold of Norway and later to Sven of Denmark, Isiaslav to the sister of Casimir of Poland, Vsevolod to a daughter of the Byzantine emperor, Vladimir to a niece of a former queen of France, Matilda of Stade.\n\nAnne was married in 1051 to Henry I [1], king of France, whose first two wives [2] had died; she was consecrated queen at Reims when Liebert, bishop of Cambray was consecrated. Anne brought no land to the marriage, but did bring connections and wealth, probably including a jacinth which Suger later mounted in the reliquary of St. Denis (Bauthier, 550; Hallu,168, citing Comptes de Suger).\n\nAnne and Henry had three sons, Philip I [3], born 1052, Robert, born 1054, died young, and Hugh, born 1057, who became count of Vermandois by marriage.\n\nAnne is associated in four of Henry’s acts, towards the end of his reign:\n\n1. In 1058, a charter of concession to the monastery St. Maur-les-Fosses [4], “annuente mea conjuge Anna et prole Philippo, Roberto ac Hugone” (HGF, 11.600, XXXII); 2. A donation of Villas to the monastery of Hasnon, with the signatures of Henrici regis, Philippi Regis pueri, A. Reginae (HGF 11.599, XXXI);\n\n3. In 1059, assent to giving restored church to abbey of Coulombs, signed by Henry king, Anna queen his wife (Reginae uxoris ejus), and Philip, son of the king (HGF, 11.604, XXXV); and\n\n4. A concession to St. Martin des Champs, which the king, queen, and son Philip with his brothers confirm with their signatures, “Ego ipse Rex Henricus, et Regina pariter, et Philippus filius meus cum fratribus suis manufirmatam corroboravimus” (HGF, 11.605-6, XXXVI).\n\nBut when Henry died in 1160, Anne participated in the government of her son, although Baldwin V of Flanders, married to Henry’s sister, Adele, was technically regent. Baldwin described himself as “procurator et bajulus regni” but the bishop of Chartres speaks of Philip and Anne as his sovreigns (Prou, document VI, 1060).\n\nPhilip declares that as a child he took up the kingdom together with his mother (“ego, Philippus, filius ejus [Henrici] admodum parvulus, regnum unacum matre suscepissem,” Prou, XIII, 1061).\n\nAnne signed various royal acts during Philip’s reign:\n\nI, see Prou,\n\nII, reconfirmation of a document of Henry’s confirming a donation to a monastery St. Pere de Chartres,“Philipus rex cum matre regina, hanc cartam firmavit”;\n\nIII, confirming consent to the donation of a church to the abbey of St Pere, “Concessit autem hoc domnus meus rex Philipus, cum regina matre sua”;\n\nIV, gift to the abbey of St. Denis at the request of his paternal aunt, Adele, and the intervention of his mother, “per interventum matris mee A,” who signed it;\n\nV, renunciation of certain royal rights over a monastery of St. Lucien de Beauvais, “per interventum matris nostrae,” with her signature;\n\nVI, confirmation of a charter to abbot of Marmoutier to build a church, with the advice and will also of our most pious royal lords, “dominorum nostrorum piisimorum regum, Philippi scilicet et matris ejus, Agnetis”;\n\nX, donation to St. Nicaise of Reims, with the counsel of our beloved mother “consilioque dilectissime matris nostre Anne”;\n\nXI, grants exemption to basilica of St. Adrieu in the presence of the queen “Interfuerunt autem etiam huic adstipulationi Agnes regina, …”;\n\nXVI, concession to abbey of St. Crepin, which is signed apparently by Anne’s hand in Cyrillic, Anna queen; XVIII, confirming a gift to the abbey of St. Benoit-sur-Loire, signed Anna regina;\n\nXIX, confirmation of his father’s gift to St. Martin-des-Champs, with the good-will of his mother and count Baldwin, “favente matre atque comite Balduino”;\n\nXXXII, confirmation of renunciation of certain customs, signed Anna regina; according certain freedoms extended to other royal churches to a church restored by his mother, at her request, “mater mea, nomine Anna, divina inspirante”;\n\nLXXV, confirms the charter founding the monastery of Pontlevoy, signed Anne, matris Philippi regis.\n\nDocuments II-VI are dated 1060,\n\nX, XI, 1061,\n\nXVI, 1063;\n\nXVIII, XIX,1065,\n\nXXXII, 1067,\n\nXLIII, 1069,\n\nLXXV, 1075.\n\nWhen Anne signs, it is either the first signature listed, or the first following the king’s (in XXXII, several bishops precede the signatures of the king and the queen).\n\nThere is also a confirmation by Henry of a donation to St. Peter of Chartres, dated 1059, which Philip and his mother signed in 1062, after Henry’s death, “Post mortem autem Henrici Regis, secundo anno regni sui Philippus Rex cum Regina matre sua … manu propria firmavit” (HGF, 11.602-4, XXXIV). Hallu lists 23 acts of Philip's which mention Anne or carry her signature, four of them probably after her death, 185ff.\n\nIn 1061, Anne remarried to a powerful ally of the king, Raoul, count of Crepy and Valois, the Vexin, Amiens, Bar-sur-Aube, Vitry, Peronne, and Montdidier, who repudiated his wife, accusing her of adultery, to marry Anne. But the wife, Eleanor of Champagne, appealed to the pope; Alexander II responded to her complaint, asking the archbishop of Reims to investigate, try to save the marriage or take appropriate steps. Raoul refused to take her back and was excommunicated.\n\nNonetheless, he remained an important royal ally, signing some of Philip’s acts. Raoul died in 1074 and Anne returned to Philip’s court.\n\nThere is one document of Raoul’s which Anne signed along with Raoul’s son, mentioned in HGF 11.433, dated 1069, a concession to a castle.[5]\n\n---\n\nBiographical notes:\n\n1 Henry was a son of Robert the Pious and Constance of Arles who preferred her younger son Robert to Henry to succeed his father, but primogeniture prevailed. See Jean Dunbabin, “What’s in a Name? Philip, King of France,” Speculum 68 (1993), 949-68 and Chronica Regum Francorum, HGF 11.393.\n\n---\n\n2 Robert-Henri Bauthier notes that Henry was betrothed first to a Matilda, daughter of Conrad II of Burgundy and Gisela, who died before the marriage was consumated, then to another Matilda, daughter of Liudolf of Stade, granddaughter of the same Gisela, and niece of Henry III (Anne de Kiev reine de France et la politique royale au Xe siècle, revue des Etudes Slaves, Vol. 57, 1985, 543-45).\n\n---\n\n3 Anne is said to have introduced the Greek name Philip into the French royal family. Though, as Dunbabin notes, there is no recorded Philip in the Jaroslav family, the choice was probably meant to please her, as the name of an apostle important in the Greek tradition.\n\n---\n\n4 According to Hallu, p.72, this document included a prohibition to the king's cooks to make abusive requisitions of cattle for the royal table.\n\n---\n\n5 This biography draws on the following studies of Anne:\n\nBauthier, Robert-Henri.

At last he sent an embassy to distant Kiev, which returned with Anne (also called Agnes or Anna).\n\nAnne and Henry were married at the cathedral of Reims on 19 May 1051.\n\nAs a curious fact, several daughters of Yaroslav got married with catholic occidental monarchs; Anne's older sister Anastasia of Kiev, got married around 1039 with the king Andrew I of Hungary.\n\nChildren\n\nWith Henry I of France:\n\n1. Philip (23 May 1052 – 30 July 1108) - Anne is credited with bringing the name Philip to Western Europe. She imported this Greek name (Philippos, from philos (love) and hippos (horse), meaning \"the one that love horses\") from her Eastern Orthodox culture.\n\n2. Hugh (1057 – 18 October 1102) - called the Great or Magnus, later Count of Crépi, who married the heiress of Vermandois and died on crusade in Tarsus, Cilicia.\n\n3. Robert (c. 1055–c. 1060)\n\nRegency\n\nFor six years after Henry's death in 1060, she served as regent for Philip, who was only seven at the time. She was the first queen of France to serve as regent. Her co-regent was Count Baldwin V of Flanders. Anne was a literate woman, rare for the time, but there was some opposition to her as regent on the grounds that her mastery of French was less than fluent.\n\nA year after the king's death, Anne, acting as regent, took a passionate fancy for Count Ralph III of Valois, a man whose political ambition encouraged him to repudiate his wife to marry Anne in 1062. Accused of adultery, Ralph's wife appealed to Pope Alexander II, who excommunicated the couple.\n\nThe young king Philip forgave his mother, which was just as well, since he was to find himself in a very similar predicament in the 1090s.\n\nRalph died in September 1074, at which time Anne returned to the French court. She died in 1075, was buried at Villiers Abbey, La-Ferte-Alais, Essonne and her obits were celebrated on 5 September.\n\nNote\n\nIn 1717, Tsar Peter the Great stopped in the cathedral in Reims where the French monarchs were crowned. He was shown the missal on which all French kings since the 11th century swore their coronation oaths. To everyone's surprise, he began reading from the missal which was written in Old Church Slavonic, the ancestor of all literary Slavonic languages, and used in Christian Orthodox Churches during the services; its function was the same as Latin in Western Europe.\n\nAnna had brought the missal with her from Kiev to the Church where she and Henry had taken their vows. All French monarchs, save the Bonapartes, were crowned after swearing their oaths on it.\n\nAutograph of Anne: АNА РЪНNА which is understood either as Ane reine in Old French or Anna regina in Latin; among the oldest samples of the Cyrillic script.\n\nSources\n\nBauthier, Robert-Henri.

Por fim enviou uma embaixada à distante Kiev, que regressou com Ana (também chmada de Inês). Apesar da sua fé ortodoxa, diferente da fé católica romana de Henrique (que entrariam em conflito no Grande Cisma do Oriente de 1054), casaram-se na catedral de Reims a 19 de Maio de 1051\n\nO primogénito foi o primeiro príncipe da Europa ocidental a receber o prenome - na época exótico - de Filipe, cuja escolha é atribuída a Ana. A sua avó materna era descendente da dinastia macedónica de Bizâncio, que afirmava remontar a Alexandre o Grande e a Filipe da Macedónia, e na qual este nome era comum. [2]\n\nDepois da morte do seu esposo em 1060, foi regente do seu filho Filipe I, com apenas sete anos de idade, sendo a primeira rainha de França a desempenhar essa função, juntamente com o seu cunhado Balduíno V, conde da Flandres. Era uma mulher alfabetizada, o que era raro no seu tempo, mas havia alguma oposição à sua regência declarando que o seu domínio da língua francesa não era adequado.\n\nUm ano após a morte de Henrique I, Ana enamorou-se do conde Raúl III de Valois, cuja ambição política o encorajou a repudiar sua esposa para casar-se com Ana em 1063. Ana foi acusada de adultério pela ex-esposa de Raúl, que apelou ao papa Alexandre II. Este excomungou o casal em 1064, [2] mas o jovem rei Filipe perdoaria a sua mãe, e curiosamente seria também excomungado mais tarde por motivos semelhantes. Ana mandou construir uma igreja consagrada em 1065, e uma abadia dedicada a São Vicente. Quando Raúl morreu, em Setembro de 1074, regressou à corte francesa.\n\nMorreu em data incerta, 1075, 1076, 1079 ou 1089, segundo diferentes fontes. Foi sepultada na abadia de Villiers, Cerny, Essonne. [3] Abadia de Villiers foi destruída na revolução francesa depois de ser votada na assembleia nacional uma lei/decreto sobre a destruição de mausoléus. Posteriormente as pedras serão usadas para a construção de casas em La-Ferte-Alais, uma localidade próxima à abadia.\n\nSource: The book, 'Kings & Queens of Europe'\n\nBirthdate 1024 or 1036\n\nBIRTHDATE CONFLICT* NEED TO RESOLVE FOR MERGES. 08/09/10 comment added.

Would welcome other input.\n\nThere is also some mystery on her date of death. She died on September 5, but the year is contested. The Foundation for Medieval Genealogy posts her year of death as 1075/78. French Wikipedia says that she died between 1076 and 1089, most likely in 1079. English Wikipedia sets it as 1075. Russian Wikipedia cites 1075/1089 without giving a source. Likely the reason for setting her early death date as 1075 is that she survived her second husband, Raoul, who died in 1074. Once he had died, she was allowed to return to the Court of France (her marriage to Raoul was something of a controversy). Again, I would suggest using FMG for the death date, setting it at the later date of 1078.\n\nNote that none of these sources list a place of death. Further, he place of burial is apparently not altogether certain. The abbey in which she is cited as having been buried was actually not built until 1220, nearly a century and a half after her death. Further, the abbey was destroyed in the French Revolution for reasons that it was regarded as a shrine by the Ancien Regime (its stones were used to build several nearby buildings). However, a pre-Revolution record indicated that her burial stone did exist at the abbey before its destruction. This is perhaps why FMG lists it as her place of burial. But her date of burial is in question (she could have been buried there at death, and the abbey built there later, or she could have been transfered there from some other place after the abbey was founded).\n\nAlso, someone had apparently confused Anna with Anastasia. There were four daughters of Yaroslav (their pictures remain within the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev) that were married off to widely diverse lands (apparently a diplomatic effort of the Grand Prince of Rus):\n\n1. Agatha was speculated as being married to English heir Edward the Exile.\n\n2. Elisabeth was married to Harald III Sigurdarson of Norway.\n\n3. Anastasia was married to King Andrew of Hungary (according to Polish sources - Russian and Hungarian sources do not mention her by name)\n\n4. Anna, apparently the youngest daughter, was married to King Henri I of France.\n\nLastly, please note, Yaroslavna is a middle name, not a maiden name. Russian middle names are always a patronym (carrying the name of the father, with a suffix of -vich for sons, or -vna for daughters), even to present day. The patronym is part of a Russian woman's married name as well, in exactly the same way as an English or American woman's middle name likewise becomes part of her married name.\n\nBulgarian explanation, apparently along the same lines as Rurik being \"Lachin\", and again assertion without sources:\n\nIn English:\n\nOne of the sons of the world, Anna and Volyumir (or Vladimir) Yaroslav (or Georgi) was born a daughter - Anna of Kiev, Queen of France, married Henry I, and brought with her the Sacred Covenant (Bible?) of King Simeon, the Bulgarian Gospel of the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\n(Ben M. Angel notes: Old Church Slavonic, the language with which the Bible that Anna of Kiev had brought was written, was developed in Macedonia by the monks Cyril and Methodius, and so the description of the Bible that was later found by a visiting Peter the Great being \"Bulgarian\" is not that unreasonable - modern Bulgarian and Russian writing developed from this same Slavonic -, but the assertion that the Russian royal family was of Bulgarian origin has not been adequately demonstrated or documented - no primary sources have been referenced as yet.)\n\nNOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH:\n\nThe page of Anna's sister, Anastasia of Kiev:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_of_Kiev\n\nAnastasia of Kiev (c. 1023 – 1074/1096) was Queen of Hungary as the wife of King Andrew the White. She was the eldest daughter of Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev and Ingigerd of Sweden, and the older sister of Anne of Kiev, Queen consort of Henry I of France.\n\nAround 1039, Anastasia was married to Duke Andrew of Hungary, who had settled down in Kiev after his father Vazul took part in a failed assassination attempt aimed at King Stephen I of Hungary.\n\nIn 1046, her husband returned to Hungary and ascended the throne as King Andrew I after defeating King Peter I. Anastasia followed her husband to the kingdom. It was probably she who persuaded her husband to set up a lavra in Tihany for hermits who had come to Hungary from the Kievan Rus'. The royal couple did not have a son till 1053, when Anastasia gave birth to Solomon. However, Solomon's birth and later coronation caused an embittered conflict between King Andrew I and his younger brother Duke Béla, who had been the heir to the throne till the child's birth.\n\nWhen Duke Béla rose in open rebellion against King Andrew in 1060, the king sent his wife and children to the court of Adalbert, Margrave of Austria. King Andrew was defeated and died shortly afterwards, and his brother was crowned King of Hungary on 6 December 1060.\n\nAnastasia sought the help of King Henry IV of Germany, whose sister, Judith had been engaged to the child Solomon in 1058. By the time the German troops entered to Hungary to give assistance to Solomon against his uncle, King Béla I died on 11 September 1063 had died and his sons, Géza, Ladislaus and Lampert fled to Poland.\n\nThe young Solomon was crowned around 27 September 1063. On the occasion of her son's coronation, Anastasia presented the alleged sword of Attila the Hun to Duke Otto II of Bavaria who was the leader of the German troops. Between 1060 and 1073 King Solomon governed his kingdom in collaboration with his cousins, Dukes Géza, Ladislaus and Lampert who had returned to Hungary and accepted his rule. However, in 1074 the three brothers rebelled against their cousin, and defeated him on 14 March 1074. King Solomon run to the Western borders of Hungary where he could only maintain his rule only over the counties of Moson and Pozsony (Slovak: Bratislava).\n\nAnastasia followed her son, but they began to argue with each other and she moved to Admont Abbey where she lived as a nun till her death. She was buried in the Abbey.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nc. 1039: King Andrew I of Hungary (c. 1015 – before 6 December 1060)\n\n1.

She was the second oldest of the three children.\n\nAnne of Kiev (or Anna Yaroslavna) (between 1024 and 1032 – 1075), daughter of Yaroslav I of Kiev and his wife Princess Ingegerd of Sweden, was the queen consort of France as the wife of Henry I, and regent for her son Philip I.\n\nMarriage\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, Matilda, King Henry searched the courts of Europe for a suitable bride, but could not locate a princess who was not related to him within illegal degrees of kinship. At last he sent an embassy to distant Kiev, which returned with Anne (also called Agnes or Anna). Anne and Henry were married at the cathedral of Reims on 19 May 1051. As a curious fact, several daughters of Yaroslav married Catholic monarchs; Anne's older sister Anastasia of Kiev, was married around 1039 to the king Andrew I of Hungary.\n\nRegency\n\nFor six years after Henry's death in 1060, she served as regent for Philip, who was only eight at the time. She was the first queen of France to serve as regent. Her co-regent was Count Baldwin V of Flanders. Anne was a literate woman, rare for the time, but there was some opposition to her as regent on the grounds that her mastery of French was less than fluent.\n\nA year after the king's death, Anne, acting as regent, took a passionate fancy for Count Ralph III of Valois, a man whose political ambition encouraged him to repudiate his wife to marry Anne in 1062. Accused of adultery, Ralph's wife appealed to Pope Alexander II, who excommunicated the couple. The young king Philip forgave his mother, which was just as well, since he was to find himself in a very similar predicament in the 1090s. Ralph died in September 1074, at which time Anne returned to the French court. She died in 1075, was buried at Villiers Abbey, La-Ferte-Alais, Essonne and her obits were celebrated on 5 September.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Kiev\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Kiev\n\nThe primary source which confirms her existence as a daughter of Vladimir I of Kiev has not yet been identified.\n\nhttp://genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00007647&tree=LEO\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Kiev\n\nFrom the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy page on Russia Rurikid (covering her birth family):\n\nhttp://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/RUSSIA,%20Rurik.htm#AnnaIaroslavnad...\n\nIAROSLAV Vladimirovich, son of VLADIMIR I \"Velikiy/the Great\" Grand Prince of Kiev & his first wife Rognoda of Polotsk ([978]-Vyshgorod 20 Feb 1054, bur Kiev Church of St Sophia).\n\nPrince of Rostov 988-1010.\n\nPrince of Novgorod 1013-1015.\n\nHe rebelled against his father and refused to pay tribute from Novgorod in 1014. Challenged by his cousin Sviatopolk I Grand Prince of Kiev, following the latter's accession in Kiev, he defeated Sviatopolk at Liubech [1016] and forced him to flee to Poland, succeeding as IAROSLAV I \"Mudriy/the Wise\" Grand Prince of Kiev.\n\nSviatopolk returned in Jul 1018 with an army led by his father-in-law, Bolesław I King of Poland, and defeated Iaroslav at the Western Bug and forced him to retire to Novgorod. Sviatopolk entered Kiev again 14 Aug 1018 and resumed his rule.\n\nAfter King Bolesław returned to Poland, Iaroslav advanced once more on Kiev. Sviatopolk fled south to raise another force with the Pechenegs but was finally defeated by the river Alta in 1019, when Iaroslav resumed power in Kiev[140].\n\nIn 1024, his half-brother Mstislav Prince of Tmutorokan moved his headquarters north to Chernigov to challenge Iaroslav, whom he defeated at Listven. The half-brothers agreed a division of territories, Iaroslav taking the land on the western bank of the Dnieper including Kiev and Novgorod.\n\nWhile Iaroslav was absent in Novgorod, the Pechenegs laid siege to Kiev, but were defeated after Iaroslav returned with a formidable army to relieve the siege[141].\n\nHe succeeded in the territories of his half-brother Mstislav on the latter's death in 1036, becoming sole ruler or \"Autocrat of the land of the Rus\"[142].\n\nHis greatest project was the conquest of Constantinople but his armies were defeated in decisive battles in 1043[143].\n\nHe supervised the rapid expansion of the city of Kiev, modelled on Constantinople. His law code Rus'ka Pravda also contributed to the development and consolidation of his administration especially in the area around Kiev, although it appears to have had little impact in the north[144].\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the death of Iaroslav 19 Feb 1054 at Vyshgorod aged 76 and his burial place[145]. He left a testament dividing his territories between his sons, the substance of which is recorded in the Primary Chronicle[146] although no original text has survived.\n\n[m firstly ---. The fact of Iaroslav´s first marriage is indicated by the chronology of his oldest son, although as noted below no primary source has yet been identified which refers to this oldest son.

Morkinskinna names “Queen Ingigerđr the daughter of King Óláfr the Swede” as wife of “King Yaroslav [of] Russia”[148].

The Historia Norwegie records the marriage of \"sororem Olaui Sueonensis…Margaretam\" and \"rex Iarezlafus de Ruscia\" at her brother's instigation, after her betrothal to Olav of Norway was terminated[150]. It is more probable that she was the daughter rather than sister of King Olof if it is correct that she had ten children by her husband.\n\nShe is referred to as IRINA in Russian sources[151].\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the death of \"the Princess wife of Yaroslav\" 10 Feb [1048/50][152].\n\nGrand Prince Iaroslav & his first wife had one child:\n\n1.

A manuscript entitled \"Excerptum Historicum\" records the marriage of \"rex Henricus\" and \"neptem Henrici Alamannorum Imperatoris\", commenting that the couple had a daughter who died young and that King Henri's wife died soon after[231]. The Historia of Monk Aimon records that King Henri married \"neptem Henrici Alamaniæ Imperatoris\" in 1034[232].\n\nSzabolcs de Vajay[233] suggests that she was Mathilde, daughter of Liudolf Markgraf von Friesland [Braunschweig] & his wife Gertrud von Egisheim, her supposed father being the uterine half-brother of Emperor Heinrich III.\n\nThe Historia Francica records the death in 1044 of \"Mahildis Regina\"[234].

Jaroslav and Ingegard had nine children, several of whom were married to royalty: Anastasia to Andrew I of Hungary, Elisabeth to Harold of Norway and later to Sven of Denmark, Isiaslav to the sister of Casimir of Poland, Vsevolod to a daughter of the Byzantine emperor, Vladimir to a niece of a former queen of France, Matilda of Stade.\n\nAnne was married in 1051 to Henry I [1], king of France, whose first two wives [2] had died; she was consecrated queen at Reims when Liebert, bishop of Cambray was consecrated. Anne brought no land to the marriage, but did bring connections and wealth, probably including a jacinth which Suger later mounted in the reliquary of St. Denis (Bauthier, 550; Hallu,168, citing Comptes de Suger).\n\nAnne and Henry had three sons, Philip I [3], born 1052, Robert, born 1054, died young, and Hugh, born 1057, who became count of Vermandois by marriage.\n\nAnne is associated in four of Henry’s acts, towards the end of his reign:\n\n1. In 1058, a charter of concession to the monastery St. Maur-les-Fosses [4], “annuente mea conjuge Anna et prole Philippo, Roberto ac Hugone” (HGF, 11.600, XXXII); 2. A donation of Villas to the monastery of Hasnon, with the signatures of Henrici regis, Philippi Regis pueri, A. Reginae (HGF 11.599, XXXI);\n\n3. In 1059, assent to giving restored church to abbey of Coulombs, signed by Henry king, Anna queen his wife (Reginae uxoris ejus), and Philip, son of the king (HGF, 11.604, XXXV); and\n\n4. A concession to St. Martin des Champs, which the king, queen, and son Philip with his brothers confirm with their signatures, “Ego ipse Rex Henricus, et Regina pariter, et Philippus filius meus cum fratribus suis manufirmatam corroboravimus” (HGF, 11.605-6, XXXVI).\n\nBut when Henry died in 1160, Anne participated in the government of her son, although Baldwin V of Flanders, married to Henry’s sister, Adele, was technically regent. Baldwin described himself as “procurator et bajulus regni” but the bishop of Chartres speaks of Philip and Anne as his sovreigns (Prou, document VI, 1060).\n\nPhilip declares that as a child he took up the kingdom together with his mother (“ego, Philippus, filius ejus [Henrici] admodum parvulus, regnum unacum matre suscepissem,” Prou, XIII, 1061).\n\nAnne signed various royal acts during Philip’s reign:\n\nI, see Prou,\n\nII, reconfirmation of a document of Henry’s confirming a donation to a monastery St. Pere de Chartres,“Philipus rex cum matre regina, hanc cartam firmavit”;\n\nIII, confirming consent to the donation of a church to the abbey of St Pere, “Concessit autem hoc domnus meus rex Philipus, cum regina matre sua”;\n\nIV, gift to the abbey of St. Denis at the request of his paternal aunt, Adele, and the intervention of his mother, “per interventum matris mee A,” who signed it;\n\nV, renunciation of certain royal rights over a monastery of St. Lucien de Beauvais, “per interventum matris nostrae,” with her signature;\n\nVI, confirmation of a charter to abbot of Marmoutier to build a church, with the advice and will also of our most pious royal lords, “dominorum nostrorum piisimorum regum, Philippi scilicet et matris ejus, Agnetis”;\n\nX, donation to St. Nicaise of Reims, with the counsel of our beloved mother “consilioque dilectissime matris nostre Anne”;\n\nXI, grants exemption to basilica of St. Adrieu in the presence of the queen “Interfuerunt autem etiam huic adstipulationi Agnes regina, …”;\n\nXVI, concession to abbey of St. Crepin, which is signed apparently by Anne’s hand in Cyrillic, Anna queen; XVIII, confirming a gift to the abbey of St. Benoit-sur-Loire, signed Anna regina;\n\nXIX, confirmation of his father’s gift to St. Martin-des-Champs, with the good-will of his mother and count Baldwin, “favente matre atque comite Balduino”;\n\nXXXII, confirmation of renunciation of certain customs, signed Anna regina; according certain freedoms extended to other royal churches to a church restored by his mother, at her request, “mater mea, nomine Anna, divina inspirante”;\n\nLXXV, confirms the charter founding the monastery of Pontlevoy, signed Anne, matris Philippi regis.\n\nDocuments II-VI are dated 1060,\n\nX, XI, 1061,\n\nXVI, 1063;\n\nXVIII, XIX,1065,\n\nXXXII, 1067,\n\nXLIII, 1069,\n\nLXXV, 1075.\n\nWhen Anne signs, it is either the first signature listed, or the first following the king’s (in XXXII, several bishops precede the signatures of the king and the queen).\n\nThere is also a confirmation by Henry of a donation to St. Peter of Chartres, dated 1059, which Philip and his mother signed in 1062, after Henry’s death, “Post mortem autem Henrici Regis, secundo anno regni sui Philippus Rex cum Regina matre sua … manu propria firmavit” (HGF, 11.602-4, XXXIV). Hallu lists 23 acts of Philip's which mention Anne or carry her signature, four of them probably after her death, 185ff.\n\nIn 1061, Anne remarried to a powerful ally of the king, Raoul, count of Crepy and Valois, the Vexin, Amiens, Bar-sur-Aube, Vitry, Peronne, and Montdidier, who repudiated his wife, accusing her of adultery, to marry Anne. But the wife, Eleanor of Champagne, appealed to the pope; Alexander II responded to her complaint, asking the archbishop of Reims to investigate, try to save the marriage or take appropriate steps. Raoul refused to take her back and was excommunicated.\n\nNonetheless, he remained an important royal ally, signing some of Philip’s acts. Raoul died in 1074 and Anne returned to Philip’s court.\n\nThere is one document of Raoul’s which Anne signed along with Raoul’s son, mentioned in HGF 11.433, dated 1069, a concession to a castle.[5]\n\n---\n\nBiographical notes:\n\n1 Henry was a son of Robert the Pious and Constance of Arles who preferred her younger son Robert to Henry to succeed his father, but primogeniture prevailed. See Jean Dunbabin, “What’s in a Name? Philip, King of France,” Speculum 68 (1993), 949-68 and Chronica Regum Francorum, HGF 11.393.\n\n---\n\n2 Robert-Henri Bauthier notes that Henry was betrothed first to a Matilda, daughter of Conrad II of Burgundy and Gisela, who died before the marriage was consumated, then to another Matilda, daughter of Liudolf of Stade, granddaughter of the same Gisela, and niece of Henry III (Anne de Kiev reine de France et la politique royale au Xe siècle, revue des Etudes Slaves, Vol. 57, 1985, 543-45).\n\n---\n\n3 Anne is said to have introduced the Greek name Philip into the French royal family. Though, as Dunbabin notes, there is no recorded Philip in the Jaroslav family, the choice was probably meant to please her, as the name of an apostle important in the Greek tradition.\n\n---\n\n4 According to Hallu, p.72, this document included a prohibition to the king's cooks to make abusive requisitions of cattle for the royal table.\n\n---\n\n5 This biography draws on the following studies of Anne:\n\nBauthier, Robert-Henri.

At last he sent an embassy to distant Kiev, which returned with Anne (also called Agnes or Anna).\n\nAnne and Henry were married at the cathedral of Reims on 19 May 1051.\n\nAs a curious fact, several daughters of Yaroslav got married with catholic occidental monarchs; Anne's older sister Anastasia of Kiev, got married around 1039 with the king Andrew I of Hungary.\n\nChildren\n\nWith Henry I of France:\n\n1. Philip (23 May 1052 – 30 July 1108) - Anne is credited with bringing the name Philip to Western Europe. She imported this Greek name (Philippos, from philos (love) and hippos (horse), meaning \"the one that love horses\") from her Eastern Orthodox culture.\n\n2. Hugh (1057 – 18 October 1102) - called the Great or Magnus, later Count of Crépi, who married the heiress of Vermandois and died on crusade in Tarsus, Cilicia.\n\n3. Robert (c. 1055–c. 1060)\n\nRegency\n\nFor six years after Henry's death in 1060, she served as regent for Philip, who was only seven at the time. She was the first queen of France to serve as regent. Her co-regent was Count Baldwin V of Flanders. Anne was a literate woman, rare for the time, but there was some opposition to her as regent on the grounds that her mastery of French was less than fluent.\n\nA year after the king's death, Anne, acting as regent, took a passionate fancy for Count Ralph III of Valois, a man whose political ambition encouraged him to repudiate his wife to marry Anne in 1062. Accused of adultery, Ralph's wife appealed to Pope Alexander II, who excommunicated the couple.\n\nThe young king Philip forgave his mother, which was just as well, since he was to find himself in a very similar predicament in the 1090s.\n\nRalph died in September 1074, at which time Anne returned to the French court. She died in 1075, was buried at Villiers Abbey, La-Ferte-Alais, Essonne and her obits were celebrated on 5 September.\n\nNote\n\nIn 1717, Tsar Peter the Great stopped in the cathedral in Reims where the French monarchs were crowned. He was shown the missal on which all French kings since the 11th century swore their coronation oaths. To everyone's surprise, he began reading from the missal which was written in Old Church Slavonic, the ancestor of all literary Slavonic languages, and used in Christian Orthodox Churches during the services; its function was the same as Latin in Western Europe.\n\nAnna had brought the missal with her from Kiev to the Church where she and Henry had taken their vows. All French monarchs, save the Bonapartes, were crowned after swearing their oaths on it.\n\nAutograph of Anne: АNА РЪНNА which is understood either as Ane reine in Old French or Anna regina in Latin; among the oldest samples of the Cyrillic script.\n\nSources\n\nBauthier, Robert-Henri.

Por fim enviou uma embaixada à distante Kiev, que regressou com Ana (também chmada de Inês). Apesar da sua fé ortodoxa, diferente da fé católica romana de Henrique (que entrariam em conflito no Grande Cisma do Oriente de 1054), casaram-se na catedral de Reims a 19 de Maio de 1051\n\nO primogénito foi o primeiro príncipe da Europa ocidental a receber o prenome - na época exótico - de Filipe, cuja escolha é atribuída a Ana. A sua avó materna era descendente da dinastia macedónica de Bizâncio, que afirmava remontar a Alexandre o Grande e a Filipe da Macedónia, e na qual este nome era comum. [2]\n\nDepois da morte do seu esposo em 1060, foi regente do seu filho Filipe I, com apenas sete anos de idade, sendo a primeira rainha de França a desempenhar essa função, juntamente com o seu cunhado Balduíno V, conde da Flandres. Era uma mulher alfabetizada, o que era raro no seu tempo, mas havia alguma oposição à sua regência declarando que o seu domínio da língua francesa não era adequado.\n\nUm ano após a morte de Henrique I, Ana enamorou-se do conde Raúl III de Valois, cuja ambição política o encorajou a repudiar sua esposa para casar-se com Ana em 1063. Ana foi acusada de adultério pela ex-esposa de Raúl, que apelou ao papa Alexandre II. Este excomungou o casal em 1064, [2] mas o jovem rei Filipe perdoaria a sua mãe, e curiosamente seria também excomungado mais tarde por motivos semelhantes. Ana mandou construir uma igreja consagrada em 1065, e uma abadia dedicada a São Vicente. Quando Raúl morreu, em Setembro de 1074, regressou à corte francesa.\n\nMorreu em data incerta, 1075, 1076, 1079 ou 1089, segundo diferentes fontes. Foi sepultada na abadia de Villiers, Cerny, Essonne. [3] Abadia de Villiers foi destruída na revolução francesa depois de ser votada na assembleia nacional uma lei/decreto sobre a destruição de mausoléus. Posteriormente as pedras serão usadas para a construção de casas em La-Ferte-Alais, uma localidade próxima à abadia.\n\nSource: The book, 'Kings & Queens of Europe'\n\nBirthdate 1024 or 1036\n\nBIRTHDATE CONFLICT* NEED TO RESOLVE FOR MERGES. 08/09/10 comment added.

Would welcome other input.\n\nThere is also some mystery on her date of death. She died on September 5, but the year is contested. The Foundation for Medieval Genealogy posts her year of death as 1075/78. French Wikipedia says that she died between 1076 and 1089, most likely in 1079. English Wikipedia sets it as 1075. Russian Wikipedia cites 1075/1089 without giving a source. Likely the reason for setting her early death date as 1075 is that she survived her second husband, Raoul, who died in 1074. Once he had died, she was allowed to return to the Court of France (her marriage to Raoul was something of a controversy). Again, I would suggest using FMG for the death date, setting it at the later date of 1078.\n\nNote that none of these sources list a place of death. Further, he place of burial is apparently not altogether certain. The abbey in which she is cited as having been buried was actually not built until 1220, nearly a century and a half after her death. Further, the abbey was destroyed in the French Revolution for reasons that it was regarded as a shrine by the Ancien Regime (its stones were used to build several nearby buildings). However, a pre-Revolution record indicated that her burial stone did exist at the abbey before its destruction. This is perhaps why FMG lists it as her place of burial. But her date of burial is in question (she could have been buried there at death, and the abbey built there later, or she could have been transfered there from some other place after the abbey was founded).\n\nAlso, someone had apparently confused Anna with Anastasia. There were four daughters of Yaroslav (their pictures remain within the St. Sophia Cathedral in Kiev) that were married off to widely diverse lands (apparently a diplomatic effort of the Grand Prince of Rus):\n\n1. Agatha was speculated as being married to English heir Edward the Exile.\n\n2. Elisabeth was married to Harald III Sigurdarson of Norway.\n\n3. Anastasia was married to King Andrew of Hungary (according to Polish sources - Russian and Hungarian sources do not mention her by name)\n\n4. Anna, apparently the youngest daughter, was married to King Henri I of France.\n\nLastly, please note, Yaroslavna is a middle name, not a maiden name. Russian middle names are always a patronym (carrying the name of the father, with a suffix of -vich for sons, or -vna for daughters), even to present day. The patronym is part of a Russian woman's married name as well, in exactly the same way as an English or American woman's middle name likewise becomes part of her married name.\n\nBulgarian explanation, apparently along the same lines as Rurik being \"Lachin\", and again assertion without sources:\n\nIn English:\n\nOne of the sons of the world, Anna and Volyumir (or Vladimir) Yaroslav (or Georgi) was born a daughter - Anna of Kiev, Queen of France, married Henry I, and brought with her the Sacred Covenant (Bible?) of King Simeon, the Bulgarian Gospel of the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\n(Ben M. Angel notes: Old Church Slavonic, the language with which the Bible that Anna of Kiev had brought was written, was developed in Macedonia by the monks Cyril and Methodius, and so the description of the Bible that was later found by a visiting Peter the Great being \"Bulgarian\" is not that unreasonable - modern Bulgarian and Russian writing developed from this same Slavonic -, but the assertion that the Russian royal family was of Bulgarian origin has not been adequately demonstrated or documented - no primary sources have been referenced as yet.)\n\nNOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH:\n\nThe page of Anna's sister, Anastasia of Kiev:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_of_Kiev\n\nAnastasia of Kiev (c. 1023 – 1074/1096) was Queen of Hungary as the wife of King Andrew the White. She was the eldest daughter of Grand Prince Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev and Ingigerd of Sweden, and the older sister of Anne of Kiev, Queen consort of Henry I of France.\n\nAround 1039, Anastasia was married to Duke Andrew of Hungary, who had settled down in Kiev after his father Vazul took part in a failed assassination attempt aimed at King Stephen I of Hungary.\n\nIn 1046, her husband returned to Hungary and ascended the throne as King Andrew I after defeating King Peter I. Anastasia followed her husband to the kingdom. It was probably she who persuaded her husband to set up a lavra in Tihany for hermits who had come to Hungary from the Kievan Rus'. The royal couple did not have a son till 1053, when Anastasia gave birth to Solomon. However, Solomon's birth and later coronation caused an embittered conflict between King Andrew I and his younger brother Duke Béla, who had been the heir to the throne till the child's birth.\n\nWhen Duke Béla rose in open rebellion against King Andrew in 1060, the king sent his wife and children to the court of Adalbert, Margrave of Austria. King Andrew was defeated and died shortly afterwards, and his brother was crowned King of Hungary on 6 December 1060.\n\nAnastasia sought the help of King Henry IV of Germany, whose sister, Judith had been engaged to the child Solomon in 1058. By the time the German troops entered to Hungary to give assistance to Solomon against his uncle, King Béla I died on 11 September 1063 had died and his sons, Géza, Ladislaus and Lampert fled to Poland.\n\nThe young Solomon was crowned around 27 September 1063. On the occasion of her son's coronation, Anastasia presented the alleged sword of Attila the Hun to Duke Otto II of Bavaria who was the leader of the German troops. Between 1060 and 1073 King Solomon governed his kingdom in collaboration with his cousins, Dukes Géza, Ladislaus and Lampert who had returned to Hungary and accepted his rule. However, in 1074 the three brothers rebelled against their cousin, and defeated him on 14 March 1074. King Solomon run to the Western borders of Hungary where he could only maintain his rule only over the counties of Moson and Pozsony (Slovak: Bratislava).\n\nAnastasia followed her son, but they began to argue with each other and she moved to Admont Abbey where she lived as a nun till her death. She was buried in the Abbey.\n\nMarriage and children\n\nc. 1039: King Andrew I of Hungary (c. 1015 – before 6 December 1060) 1.

She was the second oldest of the three children. -------------------- Anne of Kiev (or Anna Yaroslavna) (between 1024 and 1032 – 1075), daughter of Yaroslav I of Kiev and his wife Princess Ingegerd of Sweden, was the queen consort of France as the wife of Henry I, and regent for her son Philip I.\n\nMarriage\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, Matilda, King Henry searched the courts of Europe for a suitable bride, but could not locate a princess who was not related to him within illegal degrees of kinship. At last he sent an embassy to distant Kiev, which returned with Anne (also called Agnes or Anna). Anne and Henry were married at the cathedral of Reims on 19 May 1051. As a curious fact, several daughters of Yaroslav married Catholic monarchs; Anne's older sister Anastasia of Kiev, was married around 1039 to the king Andrew I of Hungary.\n\nRegency\n\nFor six years after Henry's death in 1060, she served as regent for Philip, who was only eight at the time. She was the first queen of France to serve as regent.
