        "text": "A towering Tudor\n\nHenry VIII: Britainâs most famous king. Big, bold and brash, he is the epitome of 'Merrie England'.\n\nRuling between 1509 and 1547, his marriages to a succession of six women became something of a Tudor soap opera and probably his most talked-about legacy.\n\nSo, as king of England and one of Europeâs most eligible royals, what did he want in a wife, and, more specifically, a queen?\n\nA mother to a prince\n\nA male heir was crucial to continuing the royal line and securing the kingdom. It was probably the queenâs most fundamental responsibility.\n\nHenry was only the second Tudor monarch, and it was a dynasty founded primarily on conquest rather than heritage. A female heir was not good enough â in England thereâd never been a ruling queen and a daughterâs accession could be challenged.\n\nCatherine of Aragon, his first wife, became pregnant six times. Only one pregnancy produced a child that survived to adulthood â a daughter, Mary.\n\nThis became intolerable to Henry. In his crusade for a male heir he divorced her, creating the Church of England to do so.\n\nUnfortunately, Anne Boleyn, the woman he married instead, also only provided him with a daughter â Elizabeth.\n\nTo make matters worse for Anne, one of the children she miscarried was believed to have had a deformity. This was associated with unfaithful or abnormal sexual practices and signalled the beginning of the end for her. She was executed in 1536.\n\nWhen Henry finally did father a healthy son, Edward, the celebration was followed by sorrow. Jane Seymour, his third wife, died of postnatal complications 12 days later.\n\nAn unavailable beauty\n\nHenry liked beautiful women. A desirable queen was an asset, and it was expected that a king of his stature should have an attractive wife.\n\nAnne Boleyn was considered highly alluring. Her striking dark looks and sophisticated manners from the French court enchanted the king. They married in a secret ceremony in 1533 with Anne already pregnant.\n\nCatherine Howard, Henryâs fifth wife, was perceived to be beautiful, young and innocent. She was only about 19 when they married and Henry called her his ârose without a thornâ.\n\nHenry had never met Anne of Cleves, wife number four, before she landed in England to be his wife.\n\nTempted into marrying her after seeing a beautiful portrait by Hans Holbein, he was disappointed to discover she wasnât as enchanting as heâd anticipated. He famously went on to call her the âFlanders Mareâ.\n\nThe marriage was annulled almost immediately on the grounds it was never consummated. It was claimed heâd chosen to wait whilst he ensured she wasn't contracted to marry someone else.\n\nHowever, Henry treated Anne kindly after the annulment and they stayed on good terms."
