        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy has brought about a meeting between French and English to sign a peace treaty. Henry delegates negotiation of the treaty to his nobles while he woos Katherine, Princess of France, who agrees to marry him. The French are brought to accept all English terms, including Henry’s right to succeed to the French throne.\n\nEnter at one door, King Henry, Exeter, Bedford,\n\nWarwick, ⌜Westmoreland,⌝ and other Lords. At another,\n\nQueen Isabel ⌜of France,⌝ the King ⌜of France, the\n\nPrincess Katherine and Alice,⌝ the Duke of Burgundy,\n\nand other French.\n\nKING HENRY\n\n2973 Peace to this meeting wherefor we are met.\n\n2974 Unto our brother France and to our sister,\n\n2975 Health and fair time of day.—Joy and good wishes\n\n2976 To our most fair and princely cousin Katherine.—\n\n2977 5 And, as a branch and member of this royalty,\n\n2978 By whom this great assembly is contrived,\n\n2979 We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy.—\n\n2980 And princes French, and peers, health to you all.\n\np. 215\n\nKING OF FRANCE\n\n2981 Right joyous are we to behold your face,\n\n2982 10 Most worthy brother England. Fairly met.—\n\n2983 So are you, princes English, every one.\n\nQUEEN OF FRANCE\n\n2984 So happy be the issue, brother Ireland,\n\n2985 Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,\n\n2986 As we are now glad to behold your eyes—\n\n2987 15 Your eyes which hitherto have borne in them\n\n2988 Against the French that met them in their bent\n\n2989 The fatal balls of murdering basilisks.\n\n2990 The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,\n\n2991 Have lost their quality, and that this day\n\n2992 20 Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.\n\nKING HENRY\n\n2993 To cry “Amen” to that, thus we appear.\n\nQUEEN OF FRANCE\n\n2994 You English princes all, I do salute you.\n\nBURGUNDY\n\n2995 My duty to you both, on equal love,\n\n2996 Great kings of France and England. That I have\n\n2997 25 labored\n\n2998 With all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavors\n\n2999 To bring your most imperial Majesties\n\n3000 Unto this bar and royal interview,\n\n3001 Your Mightiness on both parts best can witness.\n\n3002 30 Since, then, my office hath so far prevailed\n\n3003 That face to face and royal eye to eye\n\n3004 You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me\n\n3005 If I demand before this royal view\n\n3006 What rub or what impediment there is\n\n3007 35 Why that the naked, poor, and mangled peace,\n\n3008 Dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births,\n\n3009 Should not in this best garden of the world,\n\n3010 Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?\n\n3011 Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,\n\np. 217\n\n3012 40 And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,\n\n3013 Corrupting in its own fertility.\n\n3014 Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,\n\n3015 Unprunèd, dies. Her hedges, even-pleached,\n\n3016 Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,\n\n3017 45 Put forth disordered twigs. Her fallow leas\n\n3018 The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory\n\n3019 Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts\n\n3020 That should deracinate such savagery.\n\n3021 The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth\n\n3022 50 The freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,\n\n3023 Wanting the scythe, withal uncorrected, rank,\n\n3024 Conceives by idleness, and nothing teems\n\n3025 But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burrs,\n\n3026 Losing both beauty and utility.\n\n3027 55 And all our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,\n\n3028 Defective in their natures, grow to wildness.\n\n3029 Even so our houses and ourselves and children\n\n3030 Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,\n\n3031 The sciences that should become our country,\n\n3032 60 But grow like savages, as soldiers will\n\n3033 That nothing do but meditate on blood,\n\n3034 To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire,\n\n3035 And everything that seems unnatural.\n\n3036 Which to reduce into our former favor\n\n3037 65 You are assembled, and my speech entreats\n\n3038 That I may know the let why gentle peace\n\n3039 Should not expel these inconveniences\n\n3040 And bless us with her former qualities.\n\nKING HENRY\n\n3041 If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,\n\n3042 70 Whose want gives growth to th’ imperfections\n\n3043 Which you have cited, you must buy that peace\n\n3044 With full accord to all our just demands,\n\n3045 Whose tenors and particular effects\n\n3046 You have, enscheduled briefly, in your hands.\n\np. 219\n\nBURGUNDY\n\n3047 75 The King hath heard them, to the which as yet\n\n3048 There is no answer made.\n\nKING HENRY\n\n3049 Well then, the peace which you before so urged\n\n3050 Lies in his answer.\n\nKING OF FRANCE\n\n3051 I have but with a ⌜cursitory⌝ eye\n\n3052 80 O’erglanced the articles. Pleaseth your Grace\n\n3053 To appoint some of your council presently\n\n3054 To sit with us once more with better heed\n\n3055 To resurvey them, we will suddenly\n\n3056 Pass our accept and peremptory answer.\n\nKING HENRY\n\n3057 85 Brother, we shall.—Go, uncle Exeter,\n\n3058 And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,\n\n3059 Warwick, and Huntington, go with the King,\n\n3060 And take with you free power to ratify,\n\n3061 Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best\n\n3062 90 Shall see advantageable for our dignity,\n\n3063 Anything in or out of our demands,\n\n3064 And we’ll consign thereto.—Will you, fair sister,\n\n3065 Go with the princes or stay here with us?\n\nQUEEN OF FRANCE\n\n3066 Our gracious brother, I will go with them.\n\n3067 95 Haply a woman’s voice may do some good\n\n3068 When articles too nicely urged be stood on.\n\nKING HENRY\n\n3069 Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us.\n\n3070 She is our capital demand, comprised\n\n3071 Within the forerank of our articles.\n\nQUEEN OF FRANCE\n\n3072 100 She hath good leave.\n\nAll but Katherine, and the King ⌜of England,\n\nand Alice⌝ exit.\n\nKING HENRY 3073 Fair Katherine, and most fair,\n\np. 221\n\n3074 Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms\n\n3075 Such as will enter at a lady’s ear\n\n3076 And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?\n\nKATHERINE 3077 105Your Majesty shall mock at me. I cannot\n\n3078 speak your England.\n\nKING HENRY 3079 O fair Katherine, if you will love me\n\n3080 soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to\n\n3081 hear you confess it brokenly with your English\n\n3082 110 tongue. Do you like me, Kate?\n\nKATHERINE 3083 Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell wat is “like\n\n3084 me.”\n\nKING HENRY 3085 An angel is like you, Kate, and you are\n\n3086 like an angel.\n\nKATHERINE, ⌜to Alice⌝ 3087 115Que dit-il? Que je suis semblable à\n\n3088 les anges?\n\nALICE 3089 Oui, vraiment, sauf votre Grâce, ainsi dit-il.\n\nKING HENRY 3090 I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not\n\n3091 blush to affirm it.\n\nKATHERINE 3092 120Ô bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont\n\n3093 pleines de tromperies.\n\nKING HENRY, ⌜to Alice⌝ 3094 What says she, fair one? That the\n\n3095 tongues of men are full of deceits?\n\nALICE 3096 Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of\n\n3097 125 deceits; dat is de Princess.\n\nKING HENRY 3098 The Princess is the better Englishwoman.—\n\n3099 I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy\n\n3100 understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no\n\n3101 better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst\n\n3102 130 find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I\n\n3103 had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways\n\n3104 to mince it in love, but directly to say “I love you.”\n\n3105 Then if you urge me farther than to say “Do you, in\n\n3106 faith?” I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i’\n\n3107 135 faith, do; and so clap hands and a bargain. How say\n\n3108 you, lady?\n\nKATHERINE 3109 Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.\n\np. 223\n\nKING HENRY 3110 Marry, if you would put me to verses or\n\n3111 to dance for your sake, Kate, why you undid me.\n\n3112 140 For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and\n\n3113 for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a\n\n3114 reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a\n\n3115 lady at leapfrog or by vaulting into my saddle with\n\n3116 my armor on my back, under the correction of\n\n3117 145 bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a\n\n3118 wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my\n\n3119 horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher\n\n3120 and sit like a jackanapes, never off. But, before God,\n\n3121 Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence,\n\n3122 150 nor I have no cunning in protestation, only\n\n3123 downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor\n\n3124 never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of\n\n3125 this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sun-burning,\n\n3126 that never looks in his glass for love of\n\n3127 155 anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I\n\n3128 speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for\n\n3129 this, take me. If not, to say to thee that I shall die is\n\n3130 true, but for thy love, by the Lord, no. Yet I love thee\n\n3131 too. And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of\n\n3132 160 plain and uncoined constancy, for he perforce must\n\n3133 do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in\n\n3134 other places. For these fellows of infinite tongue,\n\n3135 that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favors, they\n\n3136 do always reason themselves out again. What? A\n\n3137 165 speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad, a\n\n3138 good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black\n\n3139 beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald,\n\n3140 a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow, but\n\n3141 a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or\n\n3142 170 rather the sun and not the moon, for it shines bright\n\n3143 and never changes but keeps his course truly. If\n\n3144 thou would have such a one, take me. And take me,\n\n3145 take a soldier. Take a soldier, take a king. And what\n\np. 225\n\n3146 say’st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and\n\n3147 175 fairly, I pray thee.\n\nKATHERINE 3148 Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of\n\n3149 France?\n\nKING HENRY 3150 No, it is not possible you should love the\n\n3151 enemy of France, Kate. But, in loving me, you\n\n3152 180 should love the friend of France, for I love France\n\n3153 so well that I will not part with a village of it. I will\n\n3154 have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine\n\n3155 and I am yours, then yours is France and you are\n\n3156 mine.\n\nKATHERINE 3157 185I cannot tell wat is dat.\n\nKING HENRY 3158 No, Kate? I will tell thee in French,\n\n3159 which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a\n\n3160 new-married wife about her husband’s neck, hardly\n\n3161 to be shook off. Je quand sur le possession de\n\n3162 190 France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi—let\n\n3163 me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!—donc\n\n3164 vôtre est France, et vous êtes mienne. It is as easy for\n\n3165 me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so\n\n3166 much more French. I shall never move thee in\n\n3167 195 French, unless it be to laugh at me.\n\nKATHERINE 3168 Sauf votre honneur, le français que vous\n\n3169 parlez, il est meilleur que l’anglais lequel je parle.\n\nKING HENRY 3170 No, faith, is ’t not, Kate, but thy speaking\n\n3171 of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely must\n\n3172 200 needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost\n\n3173 thou understand thus much English? Canst thou\n\n3174 love me?\n\nKATHERINE 3175 I cannot tell.\n\nKING HENRY 3176 Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I’ll\n\n3177 205 ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at\n\n3178 night, when you come into your closet, you’ll question\n\n3179 this gentlewoman about me, and, I know, Kate,\n\n3180 you will, to her, dispraise those parts in me that you\n\n3181 love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me\n\np. 227\n\n3182 210 mercifully, the rather, gentle princess, because I\n\n3183 love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I\n\n3184 have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I\n\n3185 get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore\n\n3186 needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou\n\n3187 215 and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound\n\n3188 a boy, half French, half English, that shall go\n\n3189 to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?\n\n3190 Shall we not? What say’st thou, my fair flower de\n\n3191 luce?\n\nKATHERINE 3192 220I do not know dat.\n\nKING HENRY 3193 No, ’tis hereafter to know, but now to\n\n3194 promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will\n\n3195 endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and\n\n3196 for my English moiety, take the word of a king and\n\n3197 225 a bachelor. How answer you, la plus belle Katherine\n\n3198 du monde, mon très cher et divin déesse?\n\nKATHERINE 3199 Your Majesté ’ave fausse French enough to\n\n3200 deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.\n\nKING HENRY 3201 Now fie upon my false French. By mine\n\n3202 230 honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate. By which\n\n3203 honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood\n\n3204 begins to flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding\n\n3205 the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now\n\n3206 beshrew my father’s ambition! He was thinking of\n\n3207 235 civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created\n\n3208 with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that\n\n3209 when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in\n\n3210 faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear.\n\n3211 My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of\n\n3212 240 beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou\n\n3213 hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt\n\n3214 wear me, if thou wear me, better and better. And\n\n3215 therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have\n\n3216 me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the\n\n3217 245 thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress,\n\np. 229\n\n3218 take me by the hand, and say “Harry of England, I\n\n3219 am thine,” which word thou shalt no sooner bless\n\n3220 mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud “England\n\n3221 is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry\n\n3222 250 Plantagenet is thine,” who, though I speak it before\n\n3223 his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou\n\n3224 shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your\n\n3225 answer in broken music, for thy voice is music, and\n\n3226 thy English broken. Therefore, queen of all, Katherine,\n\n3227 255 break thy mind to me in broken English. Wilt\n\n3228 thou have me?\n\nKATHERINE 3229 Dat is as it shall please de roi mon père.\n\nKING HENRY 3230 Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall\n\n3231 please him, Kate.\n\nKATHERINE 3232 260Den it sall also content me.\n\nKING HENRY 3233 Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you\n\n3234 my queen.\n\nKATHERINE 3235 Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez! Ma\n\n3236 foi, je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur,\n\n3237 265 en baisant la main d’ une—Notre Seigneur!—\n\n3238 indigne serviteur. Excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon\n\n3239 très puissant seigneur.\n\nKING HENRY 3240 Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.\n\nKATHERINE 3241 Les dames et demoiselles, pour être baisées\n\n3242 270 devant leurs noces, il n’est pas la coutume de France.\n\nKING HENRY 3243 Madam my interpreter, what says she?\n\nALICE 3244 Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of\n\n3245 France—I cannot tell wat is baiser en Anglish.\n\nKING HENRY 3246 To kiss.\n\nALICE 3247 275Your Majesté entendre bettre que moi.\n\nKING HENRY 3248 It is not a fashion for the maids in France\n\n3249 to kiss before they are married, would she say?\n\nALICE 3250 Oui, vraiment.\n\nKING HENRY 3251 O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great\n\n3252 280 kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined\n\n3253 within the weak list of a country’s fashion. We are\n\np. 231\n\n3254 the makers of manners, Kate, and the liberty that\n\n3255 follows our places stops the mouth of all find-faults,\n\n3256 as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of\n\n3257 285 your country in denying me a kiss. Therefore,\n\n3258 patiently and yielding. ⌜He kisses her.⌝ You have\n\n3259 witchcraft in your lips, Kate. There is more eloquence\n\n3260 in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues\n\n3261 of the French council, and they should sooner\n\n3262 290 persuade Harry of England than a general petition\n\n3263 of monarchs.\n\nEnter the French power, ⌜the French King and Queen\n\nand Burgundy,⌝ and the English Lords ⌜Westmoreland\n\nand Exeter.⌝\n\n3264 Here comes your father.\n\nBURGUNDY 3265 God save your Majesty. My royal cousin,\n\n3266 teach you our princess English?\n\nKING HENRY 3267 295I would have her learn, my fair cousin,\n\n3268 how perfectly I love her, and that is good English.\n\nBURGUNDY 3269 Is she not apt?\n\nKING HENRY 3270 Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition\n\n3271 is not smooth, so that, having neither the voice\n\n3272 300 nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so\n\n3273 conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will\n\n3274 appear in his true likeness.\n\nBURGUNDY 3275 Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I\n\n3276 answer you for that. If you would conjure in her,\n\n3277 305 you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in\n\n3278 his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind.\n\n3279 Can you blame her, then, being a maid yet rosed\n\n3280 over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny\n\n3281 the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked\n\n3282 310 seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a\n\n3283 maid to consign to.\n\nKING HENRY 3284 Yet they do wink and yield, as love is\n\n3285 blind and enforces.\n\np. 233\n\nBURGUNDY 3286 They are then excused, my lord, when they\n\n3287 315 see not what they do.\n\nKING HENRY 3288 Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to\n\n3289 consent winking.\n\nBURGUNDY 3290 I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if\n\n3291 you will teach her to know my meaning, for maids\n\n3292 320 well summered and warm kept are like flies at\n\n3293 Bartholomew-tide: blind, though they have their\n\n3294 eyes; and then they will endure handling, which\n\n3295 before would not abide looking on.\n\nKING HENRY 3296 This moral ties me over to time and a hot\n\n3297 325 summer.
