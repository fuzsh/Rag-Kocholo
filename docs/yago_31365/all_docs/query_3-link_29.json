        "text": "Her great-grandfather Geoffrey Boleyn was a hatter.\n\nSir Geoffrey Boleyn was a hatter. He practiced this skill in London before advancing his career to become a mercer and later Lord Mayor of the city. Sir Geoffrey also boosted the Boleyn family’s standing as the provincial gentry. However, his brother Thomas Boleyn forged a distinguished career in the church and in education. Together they increased the family’s money, influence and prestige.\n\nAnne nearly married her Irish cousin, James Butler, Ninth Earl of Ormond.\n\nAnother interesting fact about Anne is that she nearly got married to her cousin. In early 1522, Anne returned from France betrothed to James Butler, Earl of Ormond. Her father and James’ father claimed the title belonged to Anne’s great-grandfather. Her uncle suggested that marriage would help solve the conflict between the two families.\n\nAnne nearly died of the sweating sickness.\n\nThe other interesting fact about Anne is that she almost died due to sweating sickness. It is suspected that this may have been a type of influenza noted for its ability to swiftly kill young and healthy victims. The sweat killed one of Anne’s ladies, terrifying King Henry VIII.\n\nAnne unwittingly caused the arrest of Sir Francis Weston.\n\nAnne was accused of adultery and incest. During her interrogation, she mentioned Sir Francis Weston, who had professed affection for her. Weston was popular at court and had not been included in the investigation during the initial stages. Notably, Anne’s statement was sufficient to lead to his arrest and execution.\n\nAnne Boleyn’s sister, Mary, may have given birth to one of Henry VIII’s daughters.\n\nMary, Anne’s sister, was rumored to have had a secret affair with King Henry VIII while married to William Carey Mary. She later married a lowly man over a decade later. Notably, during the time she was intimate with the king, Mary bore a daughter. The circumstances surrounding this conception are unclear. As such, it cannot be confirmed that she bore the king’s child.\n\nAnne Boleyn was also known as Anne Bullen.\n\nAnne Boleyn’s name varied, and she was sometimes referred to as Anne Bullen. This was common during this time and can be used to explain the bulls’ heads that were part of her family’s coat of arms. Notably, she was listed as Boullan in the court of Margaret of Austria and signed a letter to her father under the same name.\n\nAnne was of royal blood because she descended from Edward I. She had four siblings, among whom she was the oldest. When Anne returned to England, it was suggested that she was in her early 20s. 1521–22 was the prime of her life. Other records reveal that Anne Boleyn traveled to France in her 15th year. Anne was appointed lady-in-waiting to Mary Tudor, Queen of France. The record reveals that Thomas Boleyn requested Margaret of Austria to allow Anne to return to England, where she would accompany King Henry’s sister to France for a wedding. As such, the evidence suggests that she was among the ladies who were allowed to accompany Mary to France. Additionally, Camden began writing his account of Anne Boleyn in the late 16th century, which makes his account of her age accurate because he had access to William Cecil’s personal papers.\n\nWhat impact did Anne Boleyn have on history?\n\nAnne Boleyn was instrumental in promoting and protecting evangelicals and those wishing to study the scriptures of William Tyndale. Anne’s marriage to King Henry VIII was the root cause of the breakdown of the church from the singular Roman Catholic establishment that was predominant in England. Notably, Anne influenced the king so that he established his authority above the pope and became the supreme head of the Church of England.\n\nHow many miscarriages did Anne Boleyn have?\n\nThere are two recorded miscarriages, in 1534 and 1535, of Anne Boleyn and King Henry VIII. The first miscarriage is based on the evidence concerning her pregnancy. Additionally, a meeting was canceled because King Henry and Anne Boleyn could not cross the sea because she was long gone with her child.\n\nWhat is Anne Boleyn’s legacy?\n\nThough historians disagree on the extent of Anne’s involvement in the events, she is recognized as the monarch who contributed to the separation from the Roman Catholic Church. She is also remembered for her sharp wit and independent spirit, which helped her become a well-known figure in popular culture.\n\nDo any of Anne Boleyn’s belongings still exist?\n\nThere are a few belongings of Anne Boleyn that exist today. These include the Boleyn cup that was made for her in 1535 when she was the queen, shortly before her execution, and the silver-gilt clock. The latter was given to her by King Henry VIII. These belongings were passed down to her children and have been maintained throughout history.\n\nWhat were Anne Boleyn’s last words?\n\nAnne Boleyn was executed at the behest of her husband, King Henry VIII. She protested her innocence until the last minute. Notably, her final words were uncontroversial because she praised the king for his kindness and accepted the judgment that had been made against her. Some argue that her words were laced with irony because she was considering her daughter’s safety."
