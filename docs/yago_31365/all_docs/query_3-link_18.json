        "text": "Pilot\n\nAs King Henry is trying on a suit for his daughter Elisabeth's wedding, Catherine protests against Mary's return to court. Prince Francis comes in, not too pleased about having to marry Mary, but his father doesn't care. At least his bride has a country and an army, should he need it. Henry leaves the room once his suit is finished being adjusted by the royal tailor, leaving both his son and wife unhappy with him.\n\nTrumpets sound at the Scottish Queen's arrival. King Henry arrives with Diane de Poitiers and his son Sebastian by his side. Before Mary can greet the Royals she is stopped by Francis who cuts across the grass to meet her where she stands. They exchange hellos, and Francis and Mary walk arm-in-arm down the line of castle members towards the King and Queen of France for a proper introduction.\n\nThat evening at Elisabeth and Philip's Wedding everyone is celebrating with a grand party as Princess Elisabeth and King Philip have their first dance, before everyone joins in. Henry watches Lady Kenna dancing in the middle of the floor intently. Much to Diane's annoyance. Soon after Henry finds Kenna and requested to be close to her to wish she obliges as he brings his hand under her dress as they make out.\n\nMary seeks an audience in front of the king and Queen of France after Colin MacPhail attempted to rape her the night before. Requesting to speak to him herself. They both encourage her it's a bad idea, and Catherine tells her not to give mercy as the man tried to rape her. Mary demands to see her subject, but King Henry tells her it's too late, as he had already been exacted for his crimes at dawn.\n\nSnakes in the Garden\n\nIn the throne room, Catherine and Henry are talking about who they're going to betrothe their son Charles to. Catherine believes the young Lady Madeleine to be a brilliant match - she is French, therefore loyal to France, and very wealthy. Henry is unsure about it at first, but Catherine's arguments manage to persuade him. Francis is ordered to accompany Charles to the landing to show respect. Charles asks if Sebastian can come as well, but Catherine slams Bash for appearing in the throne room at all.\n\nMary volunteers to go as well, as she too was once a child who was sent away to a foreign land, so she may be able to soothe the girl's fear. Catherine suggests that they all stay here, as the journey may not be safe, but Henry assures her that the carriage will stay on the King's road, with a dozen of well-armed guards to protect it.\n\nThe next day, Catherine and Henry apprise Mary and her ladies of Colin's escape. Catherine blames the English for aiding him in the escape, even though as Mary points out, the escape took place before the English arrived. Mary asks them to bring Colin back, preferably alive, so that she can speak with him and find out who was behind her attack.\n\nAfter leaving Mary's chamber, Henry wonders why Catherine didn't tell him about Colin's escape when she first heard of it. Henry wants to be informed, because once Colin is found, he wants to hear whatever he has to say.\n\nAt a picnic for newly engaged couple that afternoon, Henry and Catherine walk arm-in-arm together, but Henry soon snubs her in favour of another woman.\n\nThe next day at Charles and Madeleine's Engagement Party, Henry and Catherine walked arm-in-arm, but Catherine was soon discouraged when Henry began his flirtatious behavior towards other women in front of her. Hours later, King Henry left the part to find Lady Kenna, asking if she would think about being with him.\n\nThe next night at court the sexually frustrated Henry watched Lady kenna as she flirted with men around her, including Robert playing cards. Henry approaches Kenna and wanted to know why Kenna won't be with him, and is informs, people like Robert are the people she needs to spend her time. Men that are available and she can marry, and can't be associated with him as his mistress.\n\nThat night Kenna opens her door to find King Henry with Robert. He immediately asks Robert if he will take Lady Kenna as his bride to which the shocked Robert agrees before being sent him away. He assures Kenna that being with him doesn't close doors, it opens them. They share a passionate kiss.\n\nKissed\n\nHearts and Minds\n\nA Chill in the Air\n\nChosen\n\nLeft Behind\n\nFated\n\nKing Henry II anounced the Tudor Queen was dying. She had not named her successor but many believe the rightful heir to the English throne should be Queen Mary Stuart. The second England's queen dies, King Henry wanted Mary Stuart to make her claim. Her marriage to Prince Francis would be moved up as it would strengthen her claim, and would show Europe that Mary Stuart had the might of France at her side.\n\nKing Henry II stated a new condition of Scotland and France's marriage alliance is that Mary Stuart deliver England to France. Support from The Vatican made him think he could get it, However, Queen Catherine cautioned Princess Elizabeth would have support too. Armies she'd been gathering for years. Laying claim to England could cost Mary Stuart her head, as it did Lady Jane Grey.\n\nWhen the English Queen dies, so would Henry the VIII's legitimate line, as Mary Stuart is his next relation by blood, because Elizabeth is King Henry VIII's daughter by Anne Boleyn and her parents' marriage was never recognized by The Catholic Church, because in God's eyes, she doesn't even exist. Elizabeth is Protestant and The Pope doesn't want to lose a nation to Protestantism. However, a Scottish Queen on the English throne, a daughter born of one of Henry's wives, dismissed would cause uprisings and wars.\n\nFor King and Country\n\nKing Henry told Mary Stuart that she would lay claim to England once the English Queen, Mary I was dead.\n\nMarie de Guise wants Mary Stuart to go after England, and Scotland wants her on the throne of England. They know it's a risk, but less with Prince Francis at her side. Scotland want Mary Stuart to wed the next King of France without delay.\n\nThe Vatican support Mary Stuart's claim to the English throne. However, Mary Stuart would only agree if Sebastian was named his heir. Mary and Sebastian's ascent to the throne would not be official until The Pope agreed. King Henry decided to go to Rome himself, to ensure the marriage of future King and Queen of France, Scotland and England.\n\nUnfortunitly, Queen Catherine would never agree to an annulment, thus her execution was schedualed, and Henry was preparing to marry Diane de Poitiers. When King Henry dies, Bash would become King. If Bash is survived by King Henry and Queen Catherine's children, the line of succession will revert back to King Henry's sons by Catherine.\n\nSacrifice\n\nInquisition\n\nRoyal Blood - (Mentioned)\n\nQueen Catherine confronts Mary Stuart. Telling her she warned her of the unrest that would result from changing the line of succession. Once The Vatican legitimizes Sebastian, King Henry will take off her head, and her other sons, Prince Charles and Prince Henri will be orphans. Mary reminds her,t ey have a father. Catherine asks how much attention does she think they'll get from him as he cavorts with his new bride Diane? As for Bash, as soon as he takes power, he will face unrelenting pressure to do away with them, Mary promises to never let that happen.\n\nConsummation\n\nHenry was very annoyed he had to deal with his wife once again about her funeral arrangements. It was turning out to be a very expensive thing for him indeed. It was costing him gold and silver, musicians, and a lot of money on food. Before they could finish their conversation, the Scottish Queen's mother, Marie de Guise had just arrived.\n\nHour’s later in the afternoon a messenger rode with news of the English Queen. Henry gathered everyone in the throne room AND informed them the English Queen was dead. She had not named a successor, so he demanded Mary lay claim to Britain, and demanded Mary Stuart choose a husband to marry that night. But she refused.\n\nFrustrated Henry retired to his chambers. His servant informed him Kenna wished to see him. Not in the mood to deal with her he told his servant to send her away, but was informed she was naked under her robe. He allowed her entrance. Kenna began seducing him, whilst requesting to know why he had not found her a suitor. She promised she would continue to be his mistress even after she was married. All he had to do was introduce her to a suitor, once a week until she found one she liked and promised if he did that for her, she would do things for him. With that, she took off her clothes.\n\nHours later, Henry was told the Scottish Queen had picked a husband. She had chosen Prince Francis to wed. He arranged they be married that night, in a beautiful wedding with the flowers and food from Catherine's canceled funeral.\n\nBefore the consummation ceremony began, Henry grabbed his other son Sebastian. Wanting him to remember what was, and was not his. He coldly bond his son's hands behind his back and forced him to watch the Consummation ceremony between his brother and Mary.\n\nDirty Laundry\n\nThe Darkness\n\nKenna is called to the King's room. Since Henry hurt her the last time she was there, Kenna is hesitant to carry on with his sexual escapades, but Henry reminds her of their agreement and promises to introduce her to eligible suitors if she indulges him. He then brings out Anna, a prostitute who \"cost a fortune\", and asks Anna and Kenna to entertain him. They begin drinking wine and making out, and it isn't long before Kenna falls into a delirious sleep.\n\nThat evening, Catherine walks in on Henry muttering to himself and looking at a map of Europe in his office. He appears drunk and angry as he curses Mary Tudor out for not dying yet. Catherine brings his attention to the dead girl in his chambers, as well as to the fact that his water has run black, and asks him to see Nostradamus. Henry dismisses the idea completely and argues that kings do not get ill, as the country would descend into madness if the people believed they did. As such, he makes Catherine swear to keep his condition a secret.\n\nTwo days later while walking in the hallway, Henry walks up to Kenna and begins flirting with her. He is then cut off by Catherine, who shoos Kenna away to talk to her husband in private. Having taken a tonic for his headaches, Henry is feeling better and more enlightened. He is done kowtowing to women after receiving a sign from God and warns Catherine that there will be others like Anna and Cecilia in the near future.\n\nMonsters\n\nLiege Lord\n\nNo Exit\n\nToy Soldiers\n\nMary and Francis appeal to Queen Catherine for military aid, but Catherine tells them they have worse problems do deal with. The ailing Mary Tudor named her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth England's next ruler, a move that infuriates Henry. He berates Mary for not being pregnant yet and for draining their resources while failing to provide him with England. The Protestants demand Marie's head on a pike and Henry warns Mary to be careful, or hers might follow.\n\nPenelope goes to Henry and claims to be pregnant with his child. However, Catherine calls Penelope out for lying and warns her not to push her luck, otherwise she may end up like the two dead girls before her.\n\nLater, Francis finds Henry maneuvering his toy soldiers on the map of Europe to plan his military strategy. His plan is to attack England from several sides beginning tomorrow. The soldiers will be marching northeast under the command of a new general, since Henry demoted the last one. Francis tries to talk him out of going through with it, as the French army is spread too thin and cannot take on England, but Henry believes that he will emerge victorious.\n\nNot long after, Henry summons Catherine and Francis to his office and tells them that he knows of their thwarting his military plans. However, no more, as he ordered his troops to march to Calais that morning with a general that doesn't report to Catherine. When Francis realizes that their troops are too weak to reclaim England alone, he offers up the Duke of Guise's army to help them. He argues that if France falls, so will Scotland, so he will have to protect France first.\n\nHigher Ground\n\nHenry is away in Paris.\n\nLong Live The King\n\nQueen Mary Tudor died and named her younger sister, Princess Elizabeth the new Queen of England.\n\nKing Henry said they'd take time to celebrate Calais, but mobilization had already begun. He wants to attack England within the week, and slay Queen Elizabeth and put Mary on the throne."
