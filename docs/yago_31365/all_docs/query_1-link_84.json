        "text": "Who was Raoul the Great?\n\n​Who was Raoul the Great, the historical inspiration for the middle grade series? Yes, Count Raoul IV of Valois was a real person and lived in 11th Century France. His most historic claim to fame is his marriage to France’s first Queen Regent, Anne of Kiev. I guess we could consider him, King Regent Consort Raoul.\n\nRaoul had the distinction of being called a “Master of Siege,” a clever and strategic man, who acquired a large area of North Eastern France. He was a staunch ally of King Henry 1st of France. His first wife was the King’s second cousin, Countess Adela Bar-sur-Aube. This promoted Raoul’s status on the King’s court.\n\nHowever, prior to becoming one of the King’s main men, under the influence of King Henry’s enemy, Count of Troyes, Raoul participated in an attempt to depose King Henry when he was a teenager. Raoul was captured by royal forces. We can imagine what conspired between Raoul and King Henry, but he managed to avoid prison (and death) and become the King’s loyal supporter."
