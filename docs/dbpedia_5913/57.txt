Spectrasonics Launches Artist Video Series

Last week, Spectrasonics debuted a new online video series to showcase notable artists performing and creating new original music tracks using the virtual instruments Omnisphere, Trilian and Stylus RMX.

The format of the new series features artists both in ‘Performance’ videos as well as in ‘Behind the Scenes’ videos revealing the process and production techniques of how the music was created.

The series kicks off with rock producer, composer, remixer, and Grammy-winning multi-instrumentalist Chris Vrenna (Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Tweaker) using Spectrasonics’ Trilian Bass instrument to create a new instrumental rock track. Vrenna is teamed with guitarist Nick Young (A.i.) and veteran engineer Rich Mouser (Spock’s Beard) co-producing the track. Check it out:
