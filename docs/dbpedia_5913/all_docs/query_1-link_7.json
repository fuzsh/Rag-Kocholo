        "text": "Earlier today I recorded a (live) video where I spent about an hour and a half with Keyscape. Unscripted, just my own impressions, noodling, thoughts, and browsing through sounds. I'm NOT an amazing keyboardist by any stretch so I was looking at it more from the viewpoint of a composer. I look forward to posting the YouTube video once I get it uploaded, but here are my thoughts:\n\nKeyscape sounds fantastic. The level of detail in the recordings is excellent. Everything is clear, crisp, and full-bodied. Much like Trillian and Omnisphere, every sound has life across the entire spectrum. This means in a mix context you will probably end up doing some high / low passing, but I would generally rather have more detail than less. The playability is wonderful (helped by the easy velocity curve editor.) The effects sound really great - particularly the spatial stuff like the shimmer reverb, chorus, phaser, and tremolo, which go a long way to really making the electric pianos shine.\n\nI thought the most interesting instruments were the unusual ones. The keys with plucked and bell tones, hybrid patches, and interesting attack characteristics. I got a lot of joy from playing these and they reminded me of the finest instruments from the Omnisphere library in the psychoacoustic / hybrid keyboards sections. The tremendous level of detail (dynamics, RR, noise layers) made everything sound amazing.\n\nIf you like vintage & retro keys this will be a particular delight. The rhodes, wurlitzer, and clavs sound incredible. Definitely the best I've used. The effects push this way beyond what Kontakt can do because (unfortunately) Kontakt lacks a really good chorus or phaser. The included presets are also great.\n\nIn terms of resource usage, these are not light instruments - though there are light patches available - so I would recommend an SSD without a doubt (or do the light installation). CPU usage seemed fine though.\n\nIs it worth the price? Does it fall short anywhere? That depends on your expectations. If you are looking for a very deep grand piano library, you may be disappointed. The Yamaha C7 sounds good. I'm biased since ISW released a similar library, but what I will say is that it does not appear to have multiple mic positions available. Thus if you want a hall concert grand type sound, you won't find it here, but I don't think that was the point of the library anyway. Likewise you won't find other grand piano models like Steinway etc. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The C7 is wonderful and versatile, and honestly, I'm glad Spectrasonics spent most of their effort on the other keyboard sounds.\n\nIf you're looking for inspiring, DEEP and playable keyboard instruments for scoring / soundtrack purposes then you'll find a lot to love. No question about it. I'm very interested in seeing what people come up with in terms of Omnisphere hybrid sounds, as those were definitely my favorites in the library. At the time I recorded the video I hadn't yet downloaded the Omni update so I didn't get the chance to use Keyscape in Omnisphere yet."
