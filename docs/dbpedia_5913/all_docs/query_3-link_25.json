        "text": "Northern Lights (O2|Unify)\n\nCheckout Added to cart\n\nNorthern Lights is a new unique patch library for Omnisphere 2.1 that explores the world of MOTION! Motion Pads, a multitude of Bells (that have lots of animation and motion to them) and over 50 Texture Patches that have magical qualities that will instantly inspire when played! This is also the FIRST LIBRARY I have released where we celebrate the ORB!! Lots of patches are saved with the ORB turned on and with a motion sequence recorded that causes sometimes slow evolving and other times, fast, abrupt, fun sonic transitions that are even TEMPO SYNC’d to your sequencer! This is a great addition to layer with Spectrasonics Keyscape Collector Keyboards!\n\nUpdate April 2021 – now includes UNIFY patches for all 257 Omnisphere patches! Layer 2, 3 or more PADS together to make incredible combination pads that are unique to YOUR productions! Unify opens up so many creative exciting doors!\n\nListen to the audio demos, watch the patch walkthru video and you will be impressed with what you can do when you add Northern Lights to your sonic horizons!\n\nOverview\n\nContents\n\nDetails\n\nGENRES: Ambient / Chill / Downtempo and anything that needs mellow!\n\nAbout the Programmer: This amazing library was created by Jason Schoepfer – a unique and talented sound designer and musician who lives near the heart of the Canadian Rockies – in Calgary, Canada. The patch names in many cases are named after beautiful locations in Canada. Jason has crafted sounds that are beautiful on a solo trek but are also truly magical if layered with other instruments (Piano, Strings and Guitars all sound amazing with his pads, textures or even bells as an underlying layer to thicken the sound). This was his first release and has followed up with a blockbuster cinematic tour de force – Northern Impakt V1\n\nLibrary Specifics: The envelopes for the pads are short enough to not get in the way and the motion will give special support no matter how they are used. Please watch the video walkthru below, listen to the demos and pick up a HUGE number of inspiring sounds for your musical productions with this library!\n\nModulation Wheel – Every sound has the Modulation Wheel assigned to change/modify the sounds in useful and often times, exciting ways.\n\n166 Patches:\n\n56 Texture Pads\n\n47 Synth Pads\n\n29 Bell and Bell Pad\n\n7 String Pads\n\n10 Pluck\n\n5 Piano\n\n4 SFX\n\n3 Unique Synth Leads\n\n3 synth basses\n\nBell:\n\n92 Multis:\n\n25 BPM Bell Arp layers\n\n40 Bell and Pad layers\n\n25 Synth Pad Layers\n\n1 Synth Lead\n\n1 8-part Multi to play the demo song “Aurora Dance” by John Lehmkuhl.\n\nNOTE: This library purchase also includes the Logic Pro X and BreakTweaker OMG!
