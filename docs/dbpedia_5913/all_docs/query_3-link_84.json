        "text": "by Robin Vincent | Approximate reading time: 1 Minute\n\nThis company is probably the least prolific and slowest moving developer of virtual instruments. Keyscape was their last release over a year ago and other than Omnisphere 2 that’s it for what feels like decades. Back at the turn of the century, they were one of the most awesome developers out there with Stylus, Trillian and Omnisphere giving us some fabulous noises. But then their ideas seem to dry up. Now they are back in the news, not with a new product but because their plug-ins can now be run standalone! Whew! That’s stunning, thank-you, Spectrasonics.\n\nNo, that’s about it. Apparently, there are a few enhancements and they now have an updater app that keeps your software up-to-date. At least the updates are free. They are spoiling us.\n\nI do love your instruments, I just wish there were more of them.\n\nMore information\n\nSpectrasonics website\n\nYou are currently viewing a placeholder content from Facebook.
