        "text": "Hi - Well, according to the Spectrasonics website you do need the latest versions of their instruments for Monterey [and the new M1] -- you didn't mention any specifics [what instrument, what software versions, etc], but I assume when you reinstalled it was the most recent Spectrasonics versions..? You've probably tried these already, but just in case here are a few standard troubleshooting steps that might apply.. - Do a hard shutdown/restart [if you haven't already]. - I assume audio is working with other instruments [the issue is specific to Spectrasonics], but if you haven't checked yet.. - Maybe check the UA Console utility to see if any settings there have changed..? - Check any Spectrasonics preferences/settings -- again, maybe the reinstall might have changed some settings.. Here's a Spectrasonics help page on troubleshooting No Sound From Instruments: https://www.spectrasonics.net/support/knowledgebase_view_topic.php?id=85&categoryID=20 It talks about what to do if you do or don't hear audio from the Preview button vs triggered by MIDI, so maybe that could be relevant..?\n\nReply"
