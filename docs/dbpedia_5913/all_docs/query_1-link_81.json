        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nSALES, UPGRADES, DELIVERY:\n\nWhere can I purchase Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nDownload sales and Upgrades are now available for purchase in our Webstore/Techshop. Physical sales (boxed with USB drive) are handled exclusively through our Authorized Resellers.\n\nIs there an upgrade for Stylus Classic users?\n\nYes! If you already are an Stylus Classic customer, you are eligible for the Stylus RMX Xpanded Upgrade - available now in the Webstore/Techshop.\n\nIs there a DEMO version of Stylus RMX Xpanded I can try?\n\nBecause of the size of our instruments, we don't offer Demo versions. However, you can contact one of our local dealers in your area in order to arrange a live demo of Stylus RMX Xpanded. To find a local dealer in your area, please contact your local Authorized Resellers.\n\nHow are Spectrasonics Instruments delivered to new users?\n\nAll Spectrasonics instruments are available in two different editions: Boxed and Download. The physical boxed editions now contain high quality USB drives and are sold exclusively to new customers through our Authorized Resellers. The download editions are now available and sold exclusively through our Webstore/Techshop.\n\nAren’t Spectrasonics Instruments delivered on DVD-ROMS?\n\nThey used to be, but this is no longer the case. All our physical boxed versions have now been revised with high-quality USB drives. For convenience, we now also offer download sales of new Spectrasonics Instruments direct to customers from our Webstore/Techshop. Both of these new delivery platforms offer much faster and more reliable installations than DVD discs.\n\nIf I buy the Boxed version, will I also be able to get a download in the future? If I buy the Download Edition, will I also be able to get a drive? If I have the DVD-ROM edition, will I be able to get the drive or future downloads if I need them?\n\nYes to all of the above! We are happy to announce that there are now alternative forms of installation available optionally to registered users - no matter which edition you have originally purchased.\n\nSpectrasonics is keenly aware that many users no longer have computers with optical drives and there are numerous scenarios when the convenience of downloading or the speed of a USB drive would be a preferred form of installation for different types of users. To address all the various user needs and scenarios, Spectrasonics has a new Support Services area that offers Alternative Installation USB Drives and Additional Download Installations for optional purchase. These services are available for purchase directly in our Webstore/Techshop for registered users.\n\nHow is the Upgrade delivered? Is it downloadable? How big?\n\nThe Stylus RMX Xpanded Upgrade package is a 14GB download which you can order through our Webstore/Techshop.\n\nIs the Stylus RMX Xpanded Upgrade available as a physical product?\n\nNot at this time. Our download service is highly reliable though... even with slower connections.\n\nWhere do I order the upgrade from? Can I get the upgrade through my local dealer?\n\nUpgrades are available exclusively through the Spectrasonics Webstore/Techshop.\n\nCan I download the upgrade?\n\nYes. The upgrade is now exclusively available as a download in our Webstore/Techshop.\n\nDo I need to have Stylus Classic installed before purchasing the upgrade to Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nNo, but you will need to have authorized and registered Stylus Classic.\n\nIs there a student discount price for Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nSpectrasonics doesn't offer student discounts, however qualifying schools and institutions can participate in our EDU program.\n\nDoes Spectrasonics allow for used sales/license transfers of Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nPlease see the License Transfer FAQs area of the Knowledgebase for more info on our License Transfer Policy.\n\nCan I upgrade if I bought a used copy of Stylus Classic?\n\nYes, but only if that copy of Stylus Classic has been properly license transferred through Spectrasonics.\n\nIf I upgrade my Stylus Classic to Stylus RMX Xpanded can I later resell and transfer the license of either instrument used to someone else?\n\nNo. Customers who participate in a special “legacy” upgrade program for any Spectrasonics virtual instruments are not eligible for license transfers either for the original instrument or its subsequent upgrade. For example, if an original owner of Stylus Classic takes advantage of our special legacy upgrade program to Stylus RMX Xpanded, the owner is not permitted to resell either instrument and no license transfer will be granted.\n\nSOUNDS:\n\nHow large is the core library?\n\nThe Stylus RMX Xpanded core library is 5 times the size of Stylus Classic - over 14 Gigabytes! There are thousands of different grooves and sounds.\n\nIs everything from Stylus Classic included in Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nYes, of course!\n\nWhat's the total number of sounds/grooves in Stylus RMX Xpanded now?\n\nNearly 10,000!\n\nDoes it contain all the samples from the original Stylus Classic?\n\nYes! All the original core library samples and enhanced versions of all the classic Stylus Classic sounds are included.\n\nWhich libraries are included with Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nThe entire core library in Stylus RMX Xpanded is specially created for this virtual instrument. It also includes all five Spectrasonics SAGE Xpander libraries (Backbeat, Metamorphosis, Liquid Grooves, Burning Grooves and Retro Funk - all previously sold separately.) Also included is the “Bonus Spectrasonics” library - which includes all of the Vocal Planet and Bizarre Guitar Groove Control material, a large selection of loops from the Distorted Reality libraries and more previously unreleased material.\n\nIs Stylus RMX Xpanded only useful for Electronic styles?\n\nRMX stands for “Remix”, so of course the focus of the core library is definitely on sound design and modern sonic elements. However, there is also a nice \"hi-fi\" selection of percussion loops and many single hit menus for use in many more traditional styles and the included Sage Xpander libraries have much more organic material. Because of the flexibility of Groove Control and the wide variety of single hits, Stylus RMX Xpanded has been successfully used in many traditional pop and rock settings too. There have been numerous hit records and filmscores that have featured the Stylus RMX core library in a vast array of genres. We’d recommend checking out the uses of Stylus RMX Xpanded on the audio demos page to hear it in a wide variety of styles.\n\nDoes Stylus RMX Xpanded have Kits and Playable sounds?\n\nStylus RMX Xpanded includes an extensive collection of over 250 hundred simple electronic Kits, over 3,000 kit modules and over 10,000 one-shot single hits in “Sound Menus” - all of which are great for creating your own completely custom rhythm tracks. The focus of the sounds are decidedly in the “modern remix” category. Although you won’t find many “traditional” acoustic sounds with extensive multisampling, there is a nice section of acoustic percussion and some hi-fi cymbals too.\n\nCONCEPTS:\n\nWhat is Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nIt's a Virtual Groove Module plug-in, which combines a massive 14 gigabyte core library with a powerful, yet easy to use interface for manipulating the sounds in unique and innovative ways. It includes all five Spectrasonics SAGE Xpander libraries (previously sold separately.)\n\nSo is Stylus RMX Xpanded basically a \"preset\" loop machine?\n\nNot at all. The whole idea is to combine powerful flexibility, with an easy to use interface. You can easily think of RMX as the ultimate Groove creation machine! Because of the power of Groove Control™, you can easily create and manipulate your own grooves using the core library as a starting point for your own explorations. It is not an exaggeration to say that there are millions of possibilities. Stylus RMX Xpanded is designed to be inspiring for many years to come.\n\nIs Stylus RMX Xpanded a Stand-alone app or a Plugin?\n\nIt's a plug-in that works in all the major DAWs and Plug-in hosts that support VST/AU/AAX/RTAS platforms.\n\nWhat is S.A.G.E. Technology?\n\nS.A.G.E.™ is our in-house core rhythm technology that is the foundation of Stylus RMX Xpanded.\n\nWhat is the difference between the original “classic” Stylus and Stylus RMX? Xpanded\n\nStylus RMX Xpanded is a completely new instrument that has a new sound library, a new interface, many new features and is the first instrument to feature our in-house developed S.A.G.E. technology. It includes all the original sounds of the Classic Stylus plug-in, which is now discontinued.\n\nSo does Stylus RMX Xpanded replace Stylus Classic?\n\nYes, Stylus RMX Xpanded is Stylus Classic's successor.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY/REQUIREMENTS:\n\nWhat are the minimum system requirements for Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nYou can view them HERE.\n\nIs it compatible with xxx?\n\nCheck our Compatibility FAQs in the Knowledgebase which we keep up to date with the latest info.\n\nWill Stylus RMX Xpanded replace my Stylus Classic plug-in?\n\nNo. Stylus RMX Xpanded is a brand new plug-in.\n\nDoes Stylus RMX Xpanded use Copy Protection?\n\nYes, please see the Copy Protection FAQs area of the Knowledgebase for more information on our system.\n\nWhat formats does Stylus RMX Xpanded import?\n\nStylus RMX Xpanded can import all the Groove Control® sample libraries and Propellerheads REX files as well... which vastly expands the capabilities of this instrument, since this opens up the potential of using your own audio loops and third party REX libraries.\n\nDo I need a MIDI keyboard to use Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nNo, you can use it completely with a mouse if you want. However, it is faster to use and more inspiring if you also use it with a MIDI keyboard, since Stylus RMX Xpanded can be \"performed\" in real-time.\n\nDoes Stylus RMX Xpanded include a manual?\n\nAll our instruments include a comprehensive online Reference Guide, which is accessible directly through the plug-in. The integrated Reference Guide is searchable and we can keep it up to date with the software releases. You can check out the Reference Guide HERE.\n\nHow fast of a computer will I need to run Stylus RMX Xpanded?\n\nNot very fast, but as with all virtual instruments - the faster the better. Stylus RMX Xpanded is designed to run optimally on modern computers. See the System Requirements for more information.\n\nDoes Stylus RMX Xpanded need as much CPU power as Omnisphere?\n\nNo. Grooves and rhythm require far less polyphony than most of the sounds in Omnisphere, and as a result typically require significantly less CPU power to run.\n\nIs Stylus RMX Xpanded 64 bit?\n\nYes! All our instruments are 64-bit native on both Mac and Windows. They are fully-operational in 32 bit hosts as well.\n\nCan I selectively install parts of the Stylus RMX Xpanded library since it is so large?\n\nBecause of patch compatibility, Stylus RMX Xpanded must always be installed with its complete core library. However, you can install the 14 Gigabyte library to a secondary or external drive if you wish.\n\nCan I install Stylus RMX Xpanded on a different drive?\n\nYes, you can definitely install the library to a secondary or external drive."
