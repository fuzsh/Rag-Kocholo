        "text": "i'm gonna copy and paste a response i wrote on another forum....it was addressing a question from a guy with only 2g of ram (spectrasonics' quoted minimum)...i think some of it might be useful, for you\n\nthe guy asked about running it on a 2g macbook with a 5400 rpm drive\n\nmy response\n\ni'm running omnisphere very happily on 3g of ram\n\nthere are some things to consider\n\n- omni has it's own kind of sample purge, allowing for savings in memory...\n\n- omni has 'lite' versions of each patch....considering that you will likely have many different elements in a mix, you really will not be able to tell the difference between the full and 'lite' versions...also, remember that there are tons of much lighter patches, patches that work on the synth only and the atmosphere library which, to this day, is an incredible soundset...i find i often prefer the atmosphere patches, because they are a bit more simple (though still very lush)\n\n- also, consider getting used to the 'freeze' function or rendering files to audio, when possible...you could maybe set the whole choon uo in 'lite' versions and then render, when you are more sure but 'freezing' is great, depending on how your DAW implements it....you might feel it's a compromise to workflow but, to me, omnisphere sound is worth it\n\nspectrasonics recommend 4gig but it isn't the minimum...as i said, i do quite well on 3....i'm sure there are some folk scraping through on 2, but don't quote me on it\n\ni would probably suggest finding somewhere that you can actually spend some time listening to it.....if you do, then i think it's a worthy investment....it's a massive synth with an incredible library of patches and soundsources....i also love alchemy, but i tend to hit omni, more often\n\nhopefully, someone else will chime in telling you that it will work with 2gig, in which case, you could get the synth first and then go for the memory, later, should you find you need it....the more memory, the better\n\nas for the 5400 drive....i had no problems with a 5400, though i have a 7200 at the moment.....one huge tip, regardless of drive speed, is to search for presets in 'preview' mode....this drastically cuts loading times (good for 5400rpm) and takes a huge frustration out of the searching process...once you have found the patch you like, choose normal or 'lite' quality\n\n***just looked on spectrasonics website for the 'system requirements'....2 gig of ram is listed as the minimum, so you should be good to just get the package, first, then expand as necessary\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\n• 2GB RAM or higher\n\n• Dual Layer compatible DVD-ROM drive\n\n• 50GB of free hard drive space\n\nMac Recommendations\n\n• 2.0 GHz or higher processor\n\n• G5 PowerPC compatible - Intel Core2Duo or higher recommended\n\n• OSX 10.4.9 or higher\n\n• AudioUnit, VST 2.4 or RTAS capable host software\n\n• Native Universal Binary for Intel Macs\n\nWindows Recommendations\n\n• 2.4 GHz or higher processor (Intel Core2Duo or higher recommended)\n\n• Microsoft Windows XP or later\n\n----\n\nobviously, the response differs slightly, in that i didn't know which DAW he was using...since we are both on logic 9, the only differences being a couple of notches in processing power, i would think you' have a similar experience to mine\n\nremember, also using buffer sizes creatively....in fact , the whole workflow needs to be a bit more creative, in thinking, if you are going to use omnisphere for anything other than the occasional pad (and you will)\n\nhope this helps"
