I’ve looked everywhere in the plugin and online.\n\nAlso just to put this out there, I HAVE SEARCHED THIS QUESTION not only on this site but everywhere. The only thing I find is from Spectrasonics website which talks about the settings menu in the standalone version which it says does not reflect to the plugin version.\n\nUseful x 1\n\nList\n\nAnd it is a great thing that they made it so easy to turn off and on - very handy!\n\nAgree x 1\n\nList\n\nyes, it's a new feature.\n\nI find it very useful - and also that you can turn it on or off depending on your need.\n\nthey added an length option which is even be more useful depending on the patches ( like evolving pads, and stuff )\n\nAgree x 1\n\nList\n\nI completely missed the little arrow next to the button to turn it off. Was driving me insane. Thanks\n\nLike x 1\n\nList\n\nI'm glad to help.\n\nIf you mark my answer as \"winner\" it will appear in your first question, so member who will come will find the right answer without reading the whole thread.\n\nLike x 3\n\nList\n\n@Olymoon I disagree with your asking the OP to mark your answer as \"Winner\". Here the proper thing to do by OP @hdxmula is to mark your answer as BEST ANSWER. That is how the thread gets marked as \"solved\" and other members will know it without having to open each thread. Indeed, we get many threads with similar issues because the OP failed to mark as BEST ANSWER the reply that solved his or her problem.\n\nLike x 1\n\nAgree x 1\n\nWinner x 1\n\nList\n\nRight! I forgot about that ... and I think Oly did too.... Maybe because only the thread starter sees that option ?\n\nSo, your reply deserves a best answer to Oly's reply, but I think that's not possible!\n\nAgree x 1\n\nLove it! x 1\n\nList\n\nIt is underserved it because @Olymoon either forgot, or-as you said- he did not see the option, or he did not want to be seen as arrogant as @The Pirate .\n\nFunny x 2\n\nList"
