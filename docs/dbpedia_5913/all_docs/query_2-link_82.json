In this video I take apart an organic-style sequence from my soundbank Halcyon Pt. 2 to show you how I created it from scratch, and to demonstrate why Omnisphere is my go to for ambient music.\n\nIn the video I discuss â€“\n\nChoice of sound sources to get the sound you want\n\nUsing the granular engine to create variation\n\nProgramming the sequencer\n\nUsing modulation to create movement\n\nUsing the built in FX to polish the sound"
