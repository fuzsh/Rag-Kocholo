        "text": "Bob Moog Foundation Announces Spectrasonics Benefit\n\nNew Spectrasonics’ Omnisphere Library and Contest to Win Custom OMG-1 Synth\n\nto Raise Funds for the Foundation\n\nMarch 21, 2011 — Music software developer Spectrasonics has launched a unique, multi-faceted tribute to honor the legacy of synthesizer pioneer Dr. Robert Moog. Spectrasonics has released the “Bob Moog Tribute Library” created by renowned artists for Spectrasonics’ Omnisphere® virtual instrument software, and also kicked off a contest designed around the library, where participants enter to win the one-of-a-kind “OMG-1” hardware synthesizer created by Spectrasonics’ Founder, Eric Persing. 100% of the proceeds from this Tribute go to benefit the Bob Moog Foundation.\n\nSpectrasonics’ Bob Moog Tribute Library features over 700 stunning new sounds for Omnisphere, Spectrasonics flagship synthesizer, and was produced by Persing. The sounds in the new library were created by more than 40 of the world’s top synth artists, remixers and sound designers, including Hans Zimmer, Vince Clarke (Erasure/Depeche Mode), Jean Michel Jarre, The Crystal Method, Jordan Rudess, Money Mark (Beastie Boys/Beck), Bernie Worrell (P-Funk/Talking Heads), Larry Fast (Peter Gabriel/Synergy), Roger Joseph Manning Jr. (Air/Fiona Apple), Ryuichi Sakamoto (YMO), Morgan Page (Madonna/Katy Perry), Keith Shocklee (Bomb Squad/Public Enemy), Steve Porcaro (Toto), Fredwreck (Snoop Dogg/50 Cent), Jan Hammer (Jeff Beck/Mahavishnu Orchestra), Michael Boddicker (Michael Jackson), Richard Devine (Aphex Twin), Patrick Moraz (Yes/Moody Blues), Eddie Jobson (UK/Roxy Music), Diego Stocco, Danny Elfman, The Moog Cookbook, and many more.\n\n“Through this stunning Tribute Library, Eric Persing’s passion for sonic innovation is manifested in a multi-layered homage to Bob Moog’s pioneering work and legacy,” said Michelle Moog-Koussa, executive Director of the Bob Moog Foundation. “That passion is continued through the myriad of synthesists and sound designers who have participated by donating sonic tributes in the way of patches and sounds. The Bob Moog Foundation is deeply grateful to Eric, Spectrasonics and the participating musicians for the creativity and generosity that has driven this project. Without a doubt, the funding generated from the Tribute Library will be a tremendous help in driving our mission forward.”\n\nThe grand prize in Spectrasonics’ contest, the OMG-1 hardware synthesizer, was designed by Persing as a live performance instrument and is not a commercial product  it’s truly one-of-a-kind, integrating the worlds of analog synthesis, computers, software synthesis and the latest multi-touch surfaces into one extraordinary instrument. The state-of-the-art dual manual OMG-1 combines a Moog Little Phatty® analog synthesizer, Spectrasonics’ flagship Omnisphere software synthesizer, a powerful internal Apple Mac Mini computer, dual Apple iPads®, dual iPods®, and Spectrasonics’ brand-new Omni TR iPad app  all integrated into a beautiful, hand-crafted curly maple cabinet created by American artisan Daniel Auon.\n\nContestants vying to win the OMG-1 buy and download the $100 “Bob Moog Tribute Library” for Spectrasonics’ Omnisphere software, then write one or more pieces of music utilizing the sounds from the library. The deadline for submission is July 15, 2011. Spectrasonics will be flying the contest winner to the October 2011 “MoogFest” in Asheville, NC, where Eric Persing will present the OMG-1 grand prize to the winner.\n\nLearn more about Spectrasonics’ Bob Moog Tribute Library: http://www.spectrasonics.net/products/tribute and about the contest to win the OMG-1 synthesizer: http://www.spectrasonics.net/contest\n\nTHANK YOU Spectrasonics for your tremendous generosity of time, energy, talent and spirit that brought this project to life! The Bob Moog Foundation is forever grateful. Many thanks to all participating musicians as well – your involvement added new dimension to this wonderful tribute."
