        "text": "Description\n\nKEYSCAPE™ is an extraordinary new virtual instrument from acclaimed developer Spectrasonics, which features the largest selection of collector keyboards in the world. From “holy grail” pianos to stunning keyboards you didn’t even know existed, this is a keyboardists dream come true!\n\nTen years in the making, each of these rare, sought-after keyboards was carefully restored and then deeply multisampled by the renowned Spectrasonics Sound Development team. After going to the ends of the earth to find each one of these special and incredibly rare instruments, they rebuilt them to optimal condition with the top technicians and expert craftsmen from each discipline. They even went as far as spending years redoing these instruments from scratch again and again until they were totally “right”! This incredible attention to detail and meticulous care given to each instrument allowed them to develop these sounds to a whole new level of authentic tone. These compelling and highly expressive unique sounds will inspire you to PLAY!\n\nWhile it’s every performing keyboardist’s dream to have the very best instruments available anywhere, Keyscape is equally useful for producers/remixers/composers as well, since these instruments can be easily transformed into amazing new unheard of sounds with the powerful STEAM Engine under the hood. This sonic transformation capability means that Keyscape can also easily turn these incredible instruments from History into innovative sounds of the Future!\n\nOther Spectrasonic products are available through Vintage Vibe.\n\nFeatures\n\nCustom Controls\n\nThe Custom Controls presented for each Patch allow you to go far beyond the original sound. The intuitive interface includes useful performance controls and high quality creative effects processing specially crafted for each Patch. Hundreds of included Patches showcase the remarkable versatility and ability to dramatically customize these iconic sounds to your music.\n\nAuthentic Expression\n\nWith many of these collector instruments, it’s really the imperfections that make them so interesting. Instead of cleaning up all the quirks and noises they make, Spectrasonics sound designers made sure to closely capture them since they are big part of their vibe. In addition to that, the software carefully models the authentic behavior and mojo of vintage amplifiers, classic effects units and unique subtleties like mechanical noises, pedal noises and release overtones to bring these sounds to a whole new level of authenticity and dynamic expression.\n\nHybrid \"Duo\" Sounds\n\nAlong with the hundreds of patches based on the 36 instrument models, Keyscape includes special hybrid \"Duo\" sounds, which combine two of the instruments to create something entirely new. The unique timbre of these Duo patches make them some of the most creative and inspiring sounds in Keyscape!\n\nSeamless Omnisphere Integration\n\nAs a bonus for Omnisphere 2 users, Keyscape also integrates fully as a satellite instrument within the Omnisphere® interface. Keyscape will simply appear as a library inside Omnisphere’s browser for users of both plug-ins. Not only is it a significant expansion of new patches and soundsources, this capability really allows Omnisphere 2 users to harness the full synthesis power of the STEAM Engine® to explore endless new sonic possibilities and combinations!\n\nFeature Specifications\n\n• Huge 77 GB library with over 500 “Best-in-class” sounds, 36 Instrument Models and Hybrid “Duo” Patches\n\n• Deeply Multisampled sounds with up to 32-way velocity switching, Round Robins, etc\n\n• Mechanical Noise, Pedal Noise and Release Noise behavior modeling\n\n• Patches feature authentic circuit modeled amps and effects\n\n• Optional “Lite” installation (30 GB) for stage use\n\n• Fast installation via reliable USB Drives\n\n• Full Omnisphere® 2 integration\n\n*Please visit www.spectrasonics.net/keyscape for full sound listings, audio demos and system requirements"
