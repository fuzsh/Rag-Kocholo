On a \"regular ol\" dvd drive it takes about that long per disk. Sorry you can't get into the site as they have step by step video tutorials on how to make sure you install into the STEAM directory properly. Come to think of it there should be those same tutorials somewhere on one of your Trilian install DVDs. Take a look. It can be confusing, but once you get your sample library in the STEAM folder correctly....it will be AWESOME! I think many times that folks (I did this once) create an \"extra\" folder they don't need to when trying to install into the STEAM folder. Look for those tutorials.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/doghouse-riley/tracks\n\nhttps://doghouseriley1.bandcamp.com\n\nWhere you come from is gone...where you thought you were goin to weren't never there...and where you are ain't no good unless you can get away from it.\n\nSPLAT 64 bit running on a Studio Cat Pro System Win 10 64bit 2.8ghz Core i7 with 24 gigs ram.

The main Spectrasonics website page is also up.\n\nBajan Blue\n\nMax Output Level: -55 dBFS\n\nTotal Posts : 2029\n\nJoined:\n\nLocation: Barbados & Cape Town\n\nStatus: offline\n\nRe:Prblems loading Trillian and problems trying to get onto Spectrasonics website (permalink)\n\nHi\n\nThanks for the replies - I actually got onto the site as well today, so I think it must have just been down over the weekend – also eventually managed to load Trillian – still could not get it to load into the already existing STEAM directory as the installations instructions said I should; it set up a completely new and independent STEAM directory – on the same hard disc just a different location.\n\nBut all seems to work OK so I decided to leave it and see what happens.\n\nThanks again\n\nNigel\n\nNigel\n\nCheck out the first single from our new Album, On Top of the World\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTLVCOeTcTc\n\nCheck out our latest videos on\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/DevineLie/videos\n\nCheck out our website\n\nwww.devinelie.com"
