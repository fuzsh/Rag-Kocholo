        "text": "It's important to have the latest versions of your Spectrasonics software installed, since we are continually adding new features and improving upon our instruments' performance, compatibility and stability. If you own Omnisphere and/or Keyscape, the best way to stay up to date with all of your instruments is by using the SmartUpdate system included in those instruments.\n\nSmartUpdate checks for any updates that are avialable for all of the Spectrasonics instruments that are installed to your computer, including Trilian and Stylus RMX, and compiles them into one convienent installer.\n\nIf you do not own Omnisphere or Keyscape and want to stay up to date with Trilian and/or Stylus RMX, you can always find the most recent updates for your instruments in the \"Updates\" tab of your User Account. To locate the current version of your Spectrasonics instrument(s):\n\nOmnisphere/Keyscape/Trilian: Click the Spectrasonics logo in the top-right corner of the Omnisphere/Keyscape/Trilian interface to display current versions.\n\nStylus RMX: At the bottom of the Utility Menu (press the floppy disk button in the lower right of the interface), scroll down to the bottom and the version number of your plugin will be displayed.\n\nThe simplest answer is that the standard license that comes with the purchase of a Spectrasonics Virtual Instrument covers any kind of musical use and does not cover non-music applications.\n\nHere are several different scenarios:\n\n• A “melody pack” or “chord pack’ could be collections of the user’s original musical phrases, presented as audio files which were created using Spectrasonics instruments. They may wish to distribute these musical creations to other producers. This type of use is allowed under our standard license, since it is essentially a type of music production and music licensing. The only exception is if the audio files are to be embedded in other software or hardware, which would require clearance with us.\n\n• A library of individual one-shot sound samples is not music, so the standard license that comes with our products does not grant a license to use our sounds in this way. If the sample collection contains one-shots or multi-samples that contain our samples, then you must secure special permission/license from us prior to distributing those samples. It does not matter how much they have been layered or processed, it’s still required to contact Spectrasonics before release. Legally, it is considered a \"derivative work\" when our copyrighted sound recordings are involved in the creation of new sound samples.\n\n• A composer/music producer creates musical pieces/tracks in different styles using Spectrasonics instruments for a music library company that wants to distribute them both with full mixes and with stems for maximum flexibility. Since it is music, this type of use is fully allowed under the standard license agreement that comes with Spectrasonics Virtual Instruments and does not require any special clearance.\n\n• A user creates her own sound effects based on the core library sampled soundsources in Omnisphere and would like to distribute these sound effects publicly online. Since this is a non-musical use based on our copyrighted sound recordings in the core library, she should contact us in advance to clear the use.\n\n• Same user creates her own sound effects based on her user audio or the DSP waveforms in Omnisphere and would like to distribute these sound effects publicly online. Since this is not using any of our copyrighted sound recordings in the core library, she is free to distribute them as she pleases and does not need to contact us in order to do so.\n\nNot a problem. This type of use is standard and perfectly allowable. The \"single-user\" is defined as the person who is licensed to use the software instrument for his/her lifetime. This means that the licensed user can use it on any musical projects he/she is involved in. This can be a person’s own project, a project where they are acting as a producer for another artist, or as a session musician performing on someone else’s project - live or in the studio. Most of our customers use their Spectrasonics Virtual Instruments on many different kinds of musical projects for different artists and collaborations.\n\nThe main point of our license agreement is the concept of a single, licensed user. A licensed Spectrasonics user must be musically involved in a project that is utilizing Spectrasonics Virtual Instruments - hence the restriction against simply renting the instruments or renting \"time\" to use the instruments as part of a studio’s services."
