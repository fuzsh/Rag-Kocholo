        "text": "Spectrasonics has released new 1.2 versions of their award-winning virtual instrument plug-ins Trilogy, Stylus and Atmosphere, which now include syncable LFOs. The plug-ins are available for registered owners as a free download from the Spectrasonics website.\n\nThe syncable LFOs allow a host program such as Pro Tools(TM), Cubase SX, Digital Performer, Garage Band or Logic to send tempo information to the plug-in and have the LFO rate “locked” to the feel of the music. Pulsing effects, auto-panning, and rhythmic percussive effects, all synced to the host’s tempo, for example, can be created with these new versions.\n\nSpectrasonics has also released a new version 1.1 update for its classic Stylus -Vinyl Groove Module, which benefits from these same code improvements."
