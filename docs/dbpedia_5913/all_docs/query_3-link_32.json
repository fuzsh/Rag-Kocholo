        "text": "My work cycle currently uses only C3 and my VSTs. When I have rehearsal I am fast enough to set VST, then splitting or layering on my controller, maybe with some rack or state. I don’t need a middleware tool to add another level of VST management.\n\nSo I don’t see any further help in VIP or Unify.\n\nAt home I use Analog Lab or Kontakt to look for some exotic preset, but after I find it, C3 will drive that peculiar VST alone.\n\nVIP or Unify are no match for C3 indeed for a live host. By now, I have migrated all my songs from VIP to C3 and won’t ever look back.\n\nAnd even if, as suggested by others, C3 could benefit from being a VST somehow (itself or by wrapping songs/racks), at least for me, it sounds like a bad idea:\n\nI can’t imagine importing my live layers/racks in the studio. Any sane sound engineer wants to have complete control of each individual elements in the DAW itself. And FX are often shared for sound coherence. Navigating between the DAW and C3 will be slow and the whole workflow will be cumbersome.\n\nI’m pretty sure some automations would be lost and any overhead will be a PITA.\n\nMake sure you have a listen to some of the patches in one of the intro videos though. I have VIP and it’s so confusing to use (I have given it a few chances), no built-in sounds; I wouldn’t get VIP if it was free (it was free with one of my Akai controllers). It also seems a lot more more heavyweight than Unify too. I wasn’t convinced about Unify until I listened to it and saw the ease of organization, patch creation/management.\n\nI had another look at VIP; it has too many limitations compared to Unify and doesn’t have any built-in patches. But neither are a Cantabile replacement of course (I said that earlier about Unify). VIP comes closer, with song set lists and such, but can’t touch Cantabile for features and ease of use.\n\nAs to performance vs. studio uses of racks, that’s a super-easy answer for me. Unify wins there. If I need to submit recordings “raw” to an engineer I can turn off all the FX really quickly. Creating racks isn’t just about FX of course… finding just the right pads to combine, set keyboard ranges, velocity parameters, and in Unify you can select controllers to perform multiple functions across multiple VSTs in a patch… all of that is supremely useful in composing in-studio. I wouldn’t want to have to rebuild all of those things in a DAW, track by track, as opposed to pulling up Unify, load the patch, kill any FX if I don’t want them.\n\nI’m insane.\n\nThat must be why I disagree with your take on this.\n\nThe only reason this is even a question is because ‘engineers’ these days can’t bear to commit.\n\nI would ask you to consider this; If the ‘engineer’ requires every if and and but to be supplied separately, do it.\n\nIf you wish to supply a composite sound (and who’s the ‘engineer’ to know anyway? ) then just provide it. I would suggest that having the option, which you can choose to ignore, is not a bad thing.\n\nIt’s fair enough that you can’t imagine it.\n\nWow, let’s calm down with the overstatements! We are doomed if every disagreement involves insanity\n\nI’m just stating this does not fit my philosophy and workflow. The people I work with do not fit your description.\n\nWhile we’re at it, I’m not the only one noticing the hyperbolic, conceited marketing of Unify. I preemptively respect the work done here, but they are not building trust with this approach.\n\nEDIT: some brainfart, sorry Ade\n\nI’m guilty of insanity as well then and I really misunderstood Ade’s comments at first, again, my apologies\n\nThank you for the clarification and if I understand you correctly @Ade, you believe the missing “work as a VST” feature from Cantabile is a threat to its longevity. And I now get it you expressed this already in the past.\n\nI guess this happens for every differentiating feature from a concurrent product, be it Work as a VST, graphics widget, scripting, VST3 hosting, Windows/Mac compatibility, price, sounds/vst bundling, patch browsing, specific hardware integration, etc.\n\nC3’s Trello address some of those issues and I find Brad’s approach of letting us know what is important for us exciting and unique. Him allowing the community to discuss this very subject shows some confidence I have not seen with other products. This is, for me, one of the biggest advantage of Cantabile, above all features we can imagine at this very moment.\n\nYes it was and I’m sorry I showed some arrogance here.\n\nIn all my studio experiences which involve playing, from “here is what you need to play” to “we have no idea, just play and we will see what comes out”, it always end like this: “That was interesting, now kill that reverb and split the layers and we will produce something” (I may or may not be involved in this last step).\n\nEdit: rarely, but sometimes for keys I also have “That was interesting, I will capture the midi from this”, which is even more radical.\n\nThis is obviously anecdotal but in my experience, it never fails. We go with St Exupery saying that perfection is achieved, not when nothing needs to be added anymore, but when nothing needs to be removed anymore.\n\nNow I’m guilty of total thread hijacking again… I have been taught by some masters here. You know who you are\n\nHey @Toto, are you meaning to refer to Unify? John is a pretty humble guy and doesn’t have much at all for marketing of this product. He does a weekly YouTube stream helping folks out with all kinds of plugins, synths, tips and tricks, and now of course added in how to use Unify. I’ve watched a bunch of them, learned some cool things I can use in my keyboarding. But I’ve not seen any hyperbolic nor conceited marketing. Maybe you’re thinking of some other product?\n\nAfter 7 months with Unify…\n\nJohn’s added more patches (now over 500 factory) with the Unify 1.1 free update\n\nAdded new MIDI effect features like MIDIBox (play a MIDI file on any or multiple layers, layers being one instrument or an embedded instance of Unify with multiple instruments), including a bunch of MIDI files for patterns (i.e. shaker patterns, etc.)\n\nAdded JitterBox for a “humanizing”/randomizing of timing.\n\nAdditional samples (John samples and does sound design)\n\nOne really cool capability is that because Unify is multi-threaded across each layer (one thread per layer) you can actually do more with CPU-heavy synths like Omnisphere or Serum. For example, I was using an Omnisphere patch in Cantabile along with a couple others for a layered sound. But I was getting crackling; take out Omnisphere and everything was fine. So I created a patch in Unify.\n\nWhat I did was use a feature called “PolyBOX” to create 8 layers of Omnisphere. What PolyBOX then does is that each note that I play it sends to a subsequent layer and repeats back to Layer 1 when I hit the 9th note. Now I could play far more notes at once (or hold them as long as I want) without glitches in my live set, making Omnisphere work over 8 threads. Added in my other instruments as additional layers and saved the patch. Now I can use this patch in any DAW, standalone, or Cantabile for live sets.\n\nYou can also leverage PolyBOX for “converting” a mono synth into a polyphonic one. John’s got video demos on how to do this. (Example of this at https://youtu.be/Z2ZudoH7H10?t=1035)\n\nYup, just looked it up at the Spectrasonics website: it appears their plug is built to run on one core only, so they actually recommend to distribute multiple parts to multiple instances when running into CPU limitations. Your approach with PolyBOX is taking this one step further - distributing voices instead of parts.\n\nOne more reason for me to stay away from Omnisphere & co…"
