        "text": "Keyscape® - Collector Keyboards\n\nKEYSCAPE® is an extraordinary virtual instrument featuring the largest selection of collector keyboards in the world. From “holy grail” pianos to stunning keyboards you didn’t even know existed, this is a keyboardist’s dream come true.\n\nTen years in the making, each of these sought-after keyboards was carefully restored and then deeply multisampled by the renowned Spectrasonics Sound Development Team. These compelling and highly expressive sounds will inspire you to PLAY!\n\nThe process began with going to the ends of the earth to find and restore each one of these rare and incredibly special instruments with the top technicians and expert craftsmen from each discipline. We even went as far as spending years redoing these instruments from scratch again and again until they were totally “right.” This incredible attention to detail and meticulous care given to each instrument allowed us to develop these sounds to a whole new level of authentic tone.\n\nWhile it’s every performing keyboardist’s dream to have the very best instruments instantly available anywhere, Keyscape is equally useful in the studio for producers and composers. Since these instruments can be easily transformed into amazing “unreal” sounds with the powerful STEAM Engine® under the hood, Keyscape easily turns these coveted instruments from History into innovative new sounds of the Future.\n\nCustom Controls\n\nThe Custom Controls presented for each Patch allow you to go far beyond the original sound. The intuitive interface includes useful performance controls and high-quality creative effects processing specially crafted for each Patch. Hundreds of included Patches showcase the remarkable versatility and ability to dramatically customize these iconic sounds to your music.\n\nAuthentic Expression\n\nWith many of these collector instruments, it’s really the imperfections that make them so interesting. Instead of cleaning up all the quirks and noises they make, we made sure to closely capture them since they are a big part of their vibe. In addition to that, our software team closely modeled the authentic behavior and mojo of vintage amplifiers, classic effects units, and unique subtleties like mechanical noises, pedal noises, and release overtones to bring these sounds to a whole new level of authenticity and dynamic expression.\n\nHybrid \"Duo\" Sounds\n\nAlong with the hundreds of patches based on the 36 instrument models, Keyscape includes special hybrid \"Duo\" sounds which combine two of the instruments to create something entirely new. The unique timbre of these Duo patches make them some of the most creative and inspiring sounds in Keyscape!\n\nOmnisphere Integration\n\nAs a bonus for Omnisphere 2 users, Keyscape also integrates fully as a satellite instrument within the Omnisphere® interface. Keyscape will simply appear as a library inside Omnisphere’s browser for users of both plugins. This capability allows Omnisphere 2 users to harness additional functionality like Live Mode, Stack Mode, Multitimbrality, endless FX routings and the full synthesis power of the STEAM Engine® to explore endless new sonic possibilities and combinations.\n\nKeyscape Creative Library\n\nKeyscape now also includes this cutting-edge library of over 1500 patches specially designed for users who also have Omnisphere 2. The richly detailed keyboard sounds of Keyscape have been dramatically transformed using Omnisphere’s deep synthesis capabilities. These truly amazing patches offer an extremely wide variety of incredible sounds for modern music producers.\n\nMore Details →\n\nStandalone with Recording\n\nFlow Capture™ is a special recording function built into the Keyscape standalone app - which grabs spontaneous musical moments in audio, MIDI and .keyscape sound format simultaneously.\n\nUSB Installation Drive\n\nWe highly recommend the physical boxed edition of Keyscape, which includes a fast and reliable USB Installation drive. The boxed edition of Keyscape is sold exclusively through our authorized dealer network, where you can also find the best deals and payment options.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\n• Huge library with over 500 “Best-in-class” sounds, 36 Instrument Models and Hybrid “Duo” Patches\n\n• Deeply Multisampled sounds with up to 32-way velocity switching, Round Robins, etc.\n\n• Mechanical Noise, Pedal Noise and Release Noise behavior modeling\n\n• Patches feature authentic circuit modeled amplifiers and effects\n\n• Available as Download (80 GB) or Boxed USB Drives Edition\n\n• Optional “Lite” installation (30 GB) for stage use\n\n• Full Omnisphere® 2 integration\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL USERS\n\n• 2.4 GHz Intel dual core processor or higher (i7 recommended)\n\n• 8GB RAM minimum\n\n• Solid State Drive recommended\n\n• 80 GB of free hard drive space (30 GB for lite install)\n\nMac Users:\n\n• macOS 11 Big Sur or higher\n\n• AU, VST 2.4 or AAX-capable host software\n\n• 64-bit host\n\nWindows Users:\n\n• Microsoft Windows 7 or higher\n\n• VST 2.4 or AAX-capable host software\n\n• 64-bit host\n\nAll musical instrument manufacturer and product names used in Keyscape are trademarks of their respective owners, which are in no way associated or affiliated with Spectrasonics.
