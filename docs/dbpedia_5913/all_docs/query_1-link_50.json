        "text": "[quote:1687]Craig is right about this... I also recommend you to watch all the Stylus RMX tutorials on the Spectrasonics website :[url]http://support.spectrasonics.net/instruments/rmx-tutorial-videos.php[/url] They are free for all registered users. There is one about using RMX with Logic. They're all an invaluable source of information.[/quote] Yes but then SAVE AN RMX Template so you don't have to do all of that again. I really think Logic shoukd address this in it's next incarnation. It's so simple in Cubase. Cheers Rich London\n\nHi Steve {Good luck with the Emmy} hi everyone What a great site and what great tutorials-Thank you chaps. Must the i-pod viewing forever be a dream? I too do an enormous amount of travelling. This would be a feature I would almost pay for twice.And I think I've got anout 80% of the tutorials already. I think the mixing and mastering is a great idea for another complete tutorial. As regards tips and tricks I'd love to see....... Yes more on Tempo mapping. Setting up a hardware controller. I've got a JL-Cooper 32.This unit should be a dream come true -especially for laptop work. But even with the Logic 7.1 updated manual i'm completely lost. Just a tutorial working with any controller might help me. Using the \"AU-looper\" which comes with Tiger. How could you use this effectively to do live looping in Logic. {Failing that could we have a tips and tricks for ableton Live that really does explain how to set up a mac to do what Kid Beyond does for his live looping act. {If you haven't seen this yet please check his video on http://www.kidbeyond.com/ He is an awesome talent - but he's really making the technology work for him. I too shall be prordering v.shortly. Richard London\n\nHey Richard, Kid Beyond rocks! I plan to do a tut on Beat (Tempo) Mapping...perhaps July's release if there is definate interest in it (anybody?) I'm not familiar with the AU Looper... where is it? I could do one on setting up controllers .... it's a little tough without a video of the controller too...I'll figure it out! Thanks![/quote] Hi Steve Thanks for replying so promptly. If I remember rightly the Au Looper is in the developers toolkit in Tiger. I remember it took quite a bit of finding. I was prompted to look for it by an article in Sound On Sound {A monthly column dedicated to Logic -I think Martin Walker was the author] where he described using it playing live with Logic. I'm still trying to find the article i think from about 2 years ago. As regards the Tips and tricks - yes please setting up controllers and also more on the environment, and if you chaps have any say with the guys at Apple. Please ask for a simpler way of instantiating a Multi-instrument. Many thanks Richard London.\n\nGreetings fellow tips and tricksters I felt I just had to share with you knowledge of an application that a friend of mine using Digital Performer has just shared with me. I've only had it a few hours and can see how already how it is going to change the way I work and save hours organising my audio for use within Logic and Live {and i-tunes for that matter]. It's called AudioFinder{donations of 69$] , it's for the mac only,and though it's primary function may be described as an audio organiser, it has amongst it's wide array of tools those specific to our cause APPLE LOOPS and preparing files for the EXS24. Please check out the demo{flick through the Manual -you'll be impressed} It can be found at www.icedaudio.com I hope you're not disappointed. Cheers to you all Rich {London}\n\n[quote:10134][I have it is an excellelnt program...I recomended this to someone this morning at studio central.....was that you? My handel there is RsntSoul[/quote] Hi Craig no I'm not on/at Studio central -is it web based{?} or a physical studio? My recommendation came from a friend in North London. I've just thought of another technique on which I would welcome a tutorial , Steve When doing vocal takes is it possible {as it is in Cubase} to assemble a number of diifferent takes -say, as a round robin which all end up on lanes relating to one track vox comping? I am still relatively new to logic -but even with the Tutorials{and the books] and the manual - I haven't been able to nail this yet. Many thanks Rich London\n\nhi Macnando It's on the page advertising the product, just click on the sample tutorial button. Are you on the mailing list? you should have been sent a direct link with 25% off for preordering.{Another much appreciated feature of your site Martin}. I too agree, the video is great especially when you go into the vaults, that scary environment...place.... towards the end and show us the \"under the hood\" stuff. Steve, You're an excellent tutor sir. Thank you. Rich London.\n\nHi Steve Yeh I too would love to see this as i've just got fully loaded with BFD and Toontrack. Also if you have any connections with the Logic programmers/designers, could you please courteously suggest that a simpler method of routing multitracked Virtual Instruments surely has to be a priority. I recently set-up for RMX and it was so convoluted compared to something like Cubase which allows you to stipulate as you launch the instrument how many of the available outputs you would like in your mixer. Can't wait for the next instalment. Cheers Rich London"
