        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nmy name is Marco, I am 30 years old and I am writing from Bologna (Italy). I apologize ahead of time for my writing degree in English language horrendous.\n\nNot yet a Pro Tools user, I joined your group to find some information about the degree of accessibility.\n\nI want to ask the following question:\n\nHaving already read some posts on your group I could understand how with the latest update of Native Instruments has become possible to manage the various plugins; but I did not understand if all this is possible only by dedicated MIDI controller or even more simply with keyboard commands with the help of voiceover. In addition, my biggest curiosity is to see if all other VSTI eg: Nexus, Stylus RMX, Trilian, Omnisphere etc ... are or are not sufficiently accessible with voiceover for optimum utilization.\n\nI am currently a user of Sonar and Reaper Windows operating system but my experience is not entirely satisfactory precisely because most of the external plugins such as those listed above are not vocalized by Jaws having to then use the additional HSC which unfortunately I do not know create, off all those VSTI I preferred being a music producer DUB / Roots / electronics.\n\nI conclude by thanking you for your possible answers.\n\nHello, thank you for your answer.\n\nMy biggest problem is precisely that of not knowing how to create HSC JAWS in order to make accessible all those plug-ins that would take me to compose the kind of music that I produce. Here is a small list:\n\n-REFX Nexus;\n\n-Spectrasonics Stylus;\n\n-Spectrasonics Trilian;\n\n-Spectrasonics Omnisphere;\n\n-XLN Addictive Drums;\n\n-XLN Keys;\n\nin addition to all the Native Instruments Complete 10 clearly.\n\nI write only these just to give you an example of the kind of VSTI I should and would like to use to compose my music. Acquaintances are the parameters of the various Plug'in can automate the same type of software interface Sonar, Reaper, Logich, Protools; but the big problem is that it can not intervene directly on the choice of the categories of sounds, sliding the same sounds, banck, presets. So I ask you: with Protools and Logich PRO can handle this type of commands in the graphical interfaces of VSTI, somehow, not directly from the interface itself, but also from the Protools or Logich platform?\n\nYou know in addition there is a web community where you can find this type of HSC JAWS on Windows or necessarily have to create them yourself?\n\nQuestion about Samplitude and Samplitude Pro X2 X2 PRO Suite:\n\nExcellent news that the upcoming software in question of accessibility work; but I wonder: What advantages we might have us Windows users still when there is already a beautiful reality like that of REAPER? Thinking that anyway even without HSC REAPER you can not handle the graphic parts of plug'in?\n\nI'm sorry if I have dwelt but my curiosity is great and a great lover I would begin to find useful solutions.\n\nThank you."
