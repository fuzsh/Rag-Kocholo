        "text": "Ok! here is how i use it! Create an audio instrument in the environment (name it stylus rmx), change the port setting to ALL! Next create a multi instrument object and name it the same thing. Now cable the the multi instrument to the stylus rmx track audio instrument. A messagea will p[op up, \"to remove port setting\" click remove! Now select the midi tool and activate channels 1-8 on the rmx multi instrument! Then goto the arrange page. create new track, and select stylus rmx, create 8 more they should all be stylus rmx trax 1-8! Now if you are using the stereo version..you cant route the individual trax to individual outputs, but if you are using the multi output version, then create 8 aux send and then select your individual rmx's as the inputs! Next you will need to goto RMX mixer section and selct outputs A, then b etc for each individual track. Save it as an autolod_rmx so you dont have to do it all over agin! I hope i explained it well I djyaed a 12hr gig last night and I am a little sleep deprived! email me at [email protected] if you have more questions! I use rmx alot! Craig\n\nReply\n\n[quote:1687]Craig is right about this... I also recommend you to watch all the Stylus RMX tutorials on the Spectrasonics website :[url]http://support.spectrasonics.net/instruments/rmx-tutorial-videos.php[/url] They are free for all registered users. There is one about using RMX with Logic. They're all an invaluable source of information.[/quote] Yes but then SAVE AN RMX Template so you don't have to do all of that again. I really think Logic shoukd address this in it's next incarnation. It's so simple in Cubase. Cheers Rich London\n\nReply"
