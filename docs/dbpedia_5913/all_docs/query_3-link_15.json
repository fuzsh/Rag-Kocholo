        "text": "Thank you for purchasing Analog Dreams.\n\nA lot of time, effort and creativity has gone into these patches and I’m excited to finally have them in a format that I can make available to all Omnisphere 2 users.\n\nInstallation\n\nFirst of all make sure your version of Omnisphere 2 is completely up to date and you have downloaded all relevant updates from the Spectrasonics website.\n\nI recommend saving or backing up your product(s) to a different location before installing them. This will make them easy to re-installation if you have computer trouble or accidently delete a product during the installation process.\n\nInstalling Patches\n\nOpen Omnisphere and click on the ‘UTILITY’ button and select ‘Install .omnisphere’ as seen in the Screenshot below:\n\nContinue to locate your ‘.omnisphere’ for the specific Patch or Bundle you have purchased. Open the file and your installation is complete!\n\nInstalling Pete’s FX\n\nIf your product also contains a folder called ‘Pete’s FX’ follow the installation instructions below:\n\nLocate your Spectrasonics Steam folder\n\ncopy the folder ‘Pete’s FX’ and its content to this location:\n\nSteam/Omnisphere/Settings Library/Presets/User/Effects/Racks\n\nNOTE: If you already have a ‘Pete’s FX’ folder in this location DO NOT replace the existing ‘Pete’s FX’ folder with this new one! This will result in losing your previous FX presets. ONLY copy the contents inside this folder into the existing ‘Pete’s FX’ folder.\n\nThese FX’s will now show up in the FX ‘PRESETS’ dropdown menu as seen in the Screenshot below:\n\nIf you want additional information about installing Omnisphere Rack Presets check out this short video here:\n\nLocating your Spectrasonics ‘Steam’ folder on an Apple Mac:\n\nYou’re Spectrasonics Steam folder should be located in the file directory location below:\n\nMacintosh HD/Users//Library/Application Support/Spectrasonics/Steam\n\nIf you have trouble finding your ‘Library’ folder under your User Name simply follow these instructions:\n\nFor Mavericks users simple select your user name in the file directory, click on the ‘Cog’ shaped settings menu at the top of the page and select ‘Show View Options’. Then click on the box next to ‘Show Library Folder’ at the bottom of the dropdown menu to make your Library folder visible:\n\nFor older OS X versions follow the instructions below to make the Library folder visible.\n\nOpen the program TERMINAL\n\nPaste this command inside Terminal and press ‘Enter’: chflags nohidden ~/Library/\n\nLocating your Spectrasonics ‘Steam’ folder on a PC\n\nOn Windows Vista, Windows 7 & Windows 8 your Steam folder should be located the file directory location below:\n\nC:\\ProgramData\\Spectrasonics/Steam\n\nProgramData is normally a hidden folder. To \"Show Hidden Files\" go to Start Menu/Control Panel/Appearance And Personalization/Folder Options/View tab. Select the \"Show Hidden Files and Folders\" option and hit \"Apply\".\n\nOn Windows XP, the Spectrasonics Steam folder is located here:\n\nC:\\Documents And Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\Spectrasonics/Steam\n\nUsing Pete's Patches\n\nTake a look at the individual NOTES for each patch inside Omnisphere located in the PATCH BROWSER or MULTI BROWSER pages. These will give you important information about what additional Pete’s FX were used as well as the correct tempo information for any Arp/Rhythmic patch etc. (This tempo is determined by your host software eg. Logic/Mainstage, Protools etc.) Make sure your host program is sending the correct bpm to Omnisphere or things could start sounding interesting.\n\nA lot of my Patches and Multis morph and change when you move the Mod Whee. So make sure you experiment with moving the Mod Wheel (or CC1) up and down when using these patches!\n\nI’ve labelled all my patches with either a ‘#’ at the beginning for Omnisphere soundsources and ‘##’ for Trilian based soundsources and ‘###’ for Multis to make it easier to locate them. You can use this to search for my patches in the ‘Search’ bar on the right hand side of the PATCH BROWSER. You can also use this Search bar to search for album/song specific patches for example: entering “Oceans” into the Search bar will bring up all the sounds that I used on the song Oceans.\n\nUsing Pete's FX\n\nIf your product contains ‘Pete’s FX’ here are a few tips for using them.\n\nI like to run my Effects in MULTI mode so I can send as much or as little of the original signal through the AUX channel to them as I want. This way I can adjust the Dry/Wet Mix for each patch to my liking. It also means I can leave all the original patch FX’s untouched and put the FX Stack Reverb over the whole sound(s).\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are Patches/FX/Multis?\n\nPatches are the individual sound presets for Omnisphere. Pete’s FX’s are Effects Racks that can be added to any patch or groups of patches under the ‘FX’ tab (see picture on page 3.). Multis are combinations of patches and can be located in the ‘MULTI’ Tab at the top of Omnisphere .\n\nWhy doesn’t my product contain FX’s or Multis?\n\nNot all products were designed to need additional FX’s or Multis. Everything you need to get the sound heard in any audio demos is in the product you purchased.\n\nWhy doesn’t my preset sound like the audio demo?\n\nThere are three main reasons for this:\n\nAll programming, images and text © Peter James Productions 2016 All Rights Reserved."
