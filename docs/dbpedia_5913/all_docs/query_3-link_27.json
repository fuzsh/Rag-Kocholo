        "text": "(SOLD) DISREGARD INFORMATION BELOW THIS LISTING HAS BEEN SOLD.\n\nWhat's up everyone retired music producer here. I've been in music production for 4 years and built a catalog with local artists, advertisements, friends, and other creators. I recently decided to leave music for personal reasons and am trying to sell my Omnisphere 2 license.\n\n*READ BEFORE PURCHASING*\n\n*If you are interested in buying my Omnisphere 2 license please contact me before actually purchasing my license. I need information from you to approve me for an official license transfer with Spectrasonics. Being approved for a license transfer is essential for this exchange to be legitimate.*\n\nEmail me your information at adnanwells@gmail.com and clarify that you are interested in purchasing my Omnisphere 2 license.\n\n*I am required to provide the following information to Spectrasonics to secure the license transfer.*\n\nBuyer's Name:\n\nBuyer's Email:\n\nBuyer's Username created at Spectrasonics website:\n\nBuyerâ€™s Address:\n\nI am selling my Spectrasonics Omnisphere 2 license due to me leaving music production. I've had Omnisphere for 2.5 years and it served me well. Every time I thought I explored most of Omnisphere's sound library I was proven wrong every time. The thing with massive sound libraries is that they make it overwhelming for the user but Omnisphere 2 does an excellent job of arranging and giving options to filter and favorite certain sounds. Omnisphere 2 is a perfect VST for any type of music producer since the sound quality is so clean and versatile. The thing is that Omnisphere 2 seems just a little too expensive for most producers so now with my discounted price this is the perfect opportunity for you to get the full version of Omnisphere 2.\n\nOmnisphere 2 retail price: $479 + Applicable Tax\n\nMy Omnisphere license price: $350\n\nAs I stated earlier, I need information from you (the buyer) prior to any transaction on this website. So, contact me if you are interested. My information is below. Thanks!\n\nEmail: adnanwells@gmail.com\n\nInstagram: adnan.mufleh"
