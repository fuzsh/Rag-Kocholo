        "text": "This is to anyone who owns or is familiar with both Korg Triton expansion cards (EXB-PCM02 and EXB-PCM06/07) and the Motif. I am currently using the Motif with a Triton rack. I am looking for some pretty good choirs. I haven’t been too impressed with the choirs on the Motif. I’m also looking for some good strings. Now, the Motif does have some pretty nice strings. I was wondering what people think about the choirs that are on Korg’s Studio Essentials expansion card. I’ve heard the demos, but you can never tell how these expansions really are from the demos. I don’t think I am able to go anywhere to try these cards out either, so I need to know what people think of them. How do the choirs on the studio essentials expansion compare to the choirs that come on the Motif classic? Also, how do the strings on the orchestral collection expansions compare to the strings on the Motif. I think the Triton has decent strings, but I perfer the sound of the strings on the Motif.\n\nI’m debating on whether or not to get both the PCM 02, and the PCM 06/07. I would appreciate any and all opinions on these expansions vs. Motif’s sounds. I would be more likely to get just the PCM 02 for choirs and stick with the strings from the Motif. Also, if I was only going to use the PCM 02 for its choirs, are they really that good? The closest Guitar Center is over an hour away, but I will call them and see if they have demo versions of these expansions set up at their store.\n\nAlso, I am planning on getting the Motif ES when it is realeased or soon after. I noticed it has quite a large selection of choir sounds and string sounds. I am expecting the strings to be fantastic, and I don’t know about the choirs. That’s a toss up. Again, I would appreciate all feedback on these matters. Thank you.\n\nRe: Choirs and strings\n\nANDY.\n\nstrings in motif are good enough for me, but you can always use sample cds. there are a ton on the market. i like roland’s strings/orch, but i am not going to buy an xv5080 in order to use them.\n\nagree, motif’s choirs fall way short of the mark, but oh well. you cannot have it all. even editing the vox waveforms does not perform any miracles.\n\nfor a nice variety of vox, check out the soundscan synth and acoustic choir cd-rom. it is only $99. [url=http://www.usbsounds.com/usb/exec/product?prod=SC28]http://www.usbsounds.com/usb/exec/product?prod=SC28 [/url]\n\nmoreover, pro-rec’s ultimate cd-rom has choirs from the korg m1, triton, etc. the m1 choir is a classic. korg’s chiff/vox sounds will give you plenty of breathy pads as well. load the samples then edit them to your taste. [url=http://www.pro-rec.com/AKAIUCD.html]http://www.pro-rec.com/AKAIUCD.html [/url]\n\nspectrasonics’ symphony of voices cd-rom is impeccable, but $499. [url=http://www.spectrasonics.net/symphonyvoices.html]http://www.spectrasonics.net/symphonyvoices.html [/url]\n\nciao.\n\nRe: Choirs and strings\n\nI played around on the Triton some more. I think the strings on the Motif are quite a bit better than the strings on the Triton. I think the choirs on the Triton are not great, but they are better than the Motif’s choirs. I would like to know if anyone knows if the Studio Essentials expansion’s choirs are quite a bit better than the choirs on the Triton? Also, are the strings on the Orchestral Collection much better than the strings on the Triton? If I got the studio essentials, it would mainly be for the choirs, and the orchestral collection mainly for the string ensembles."
