Looks like it’s been discussed here before. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2101396\n\nI’d suggest to look at support forums / knowledge base on Spectrasonics’ website.\n\nIf you’re using Omnisphere presets without heavily tweaking them, a workaround could be to either name software instrument tracks as Omnisphere presets you’re using or to make notes elsewhere (Pages, Textedit, etc.) In case you create your own sounds, you could take screenshots of Omnisphere’s GUI."
