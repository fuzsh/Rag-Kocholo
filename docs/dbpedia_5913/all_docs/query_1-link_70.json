        "text": "This area provides global options for the instrument’s Startup Page, Round Robin settings, and preferences for how the Layers behave in the interface.\n\nStartup Page Preference\n\nOmnisphere’s default startup page is the Main Page. This menu allows you to select from either the Orb, Main, or Layer page as the default.\n\nStartup Directory Preference\n\nFrom this menu you can select the Patch directory that is loaded at startup. Choose from “All,” “All Spectrasonics,” “Projects,” “User,” any of the Satellite Instruments and Legacy Libraries, as well as any of your third-party libraries.\n\nFor example, the “All Spectrasonics” option brings up only Spectrasonics Patches, including those from Satellite Instruments like Keyscape or Trilian, and omits any User and third-party sounds.\n\nYou can also select “Auto Recall” which remembers and returns you to the last Library/ Directory from which you loaded a Patch.\n\nSwitch to Layer Upon Activation Preference\n\nThe four Layer MIX sliders on the footer of the LAYER PAGES have activation buttons. If “Switch to Layer Upon Activation” is set to “ON,” whenever you turn ON a Layer, it will automatically switch the LAYER page’s view to that Layer.\n\nFor example, if Layer A is activated, but Layer C is not, when you select the Layer D activation button, the view will switch to Layer D.\n\nIf Switch to Layer Upon Activation is OFF then Layer activation will not cause the Layer page to change to the activated Layer.\n\nSync Tabbed Panes Together\n\nThis is the default setting, but you may set your preference here.\n\nWhen enabled, this function will ensure that when you change from one Part to another, the view will remain the same.\n\nFor example, if Part 1 has the FX page selected, and then Part 2 is selected, it will also display the FX page. If “Sync Tabbed Panes Together” is disabled, then the views will not synchronize – they’ll change only for the Part you are editing.\n\nRound Robin\n\nWith only one sample per note, repeated notes on a sample-based instrument can typically cause a “machine gun” effect, with the same sample repeating monotonously. Round Robin is a sampling technique that allows a repeated note to trigger a different sampled “take” each time it’s played. This makes repeated notes sound natural, and eliminates the machine gun effect.\n\nSome Soundsources include multi-sampled Round Robin samples, which means we recorded multiple takes for each note and velocity. In fact, a single Soundsource can contain a huge number of Round Robin samples! This is particularly true for Keyscape’s keyboards and for Trilian basses. If you are loading Keyscape and/or Trilian sounds into Omnisphere using Omnisphere Library Integration, this setting can be especially useful.\n\nThe ROUND ROBIN Menu lets you select how Round Robin samples will be ordered when two or more Round Robin samples are loaded into memory.\n\nThere are four playback options available on the drop-down menu: No Variation, Random, Random Full Cycle, and Sequential.\n\nNOTE: The Sample Thinning settings located in the Patch Browser’s Soundsource Zoom determine how many Round Robin samples are loaded with the Patch or Soundsource.\n\nAccept Omni TR Connections\n\nEnabling this option allows Omnisphere to communicate with the Omni TR iPad app. When “Accept Omni TR Connections” is enabled, Omni TR will automatically connect to Omnisphere when launched.\n\nFor complete instructions on setting up Omni TR, please visit our website at: http://www.spectrasonics.net/omni_tr_app/\n\nCustom Controls Tab Reset\n\nWhen enabled, this function will ensure that when you change from one Keyscape Custom Controls Tab to a different one, the view will be the same. For example, if a Patch has the FX Tab selected, Keyscape will continue to display the FX Tab when another Patch is selected. If “Custom Controls Tab Reset” is disabled, the views will not synchronize – they’ll change depending on the Patch."
