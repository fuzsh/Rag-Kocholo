I have a PB now but my MBP is coming next week. I suspect that I have to get the boxed copy from a retailer and install in on the MBP (presumably under Rosetta) and then get the download of the intel version online?\n\nClearly I can't be downloading 3 gb from the net. Am I corrrect in saying that?\n\nThanks a lot\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Dan Blanzy\n\nUser level: Level 2\n\n160 points\n\nyes... spectrasonics should have a downloadable update. It wont contain the 3 gigs of sounds, just a fix to make it work on the new platform. (this is how it has been in the past, you may want to contact spectrasonics tech support to be sure).\n\nbtw Stylus RMX is a great plug in! well worth getting.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: BinaryAudio\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nStylus RMX is a great until you quit... it never loads the files right NEVER.\n\nMulti kits never seem to load right, all the way, or sometimes at all.\n\nThe plug would be great if they could fix that.\n\nThats the one thing I hate about my friends studio... He wont stop using the thing even tho that happens. So we have to spend a bit diggin how the files we were using just to get going, and finding them is can be a pain considering he has 16 gigs of samples. Not worth $200 look into AMG's one when that becomes universal I am sure it will probably work right.\n\nI also know a few other people that use stylus RMX... same issues.\n\nG5 Dual 2GHZ Mac OS X (10.4.5)\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: GlennO\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n9 points\n\nStylus RMX is a great until you quit... it never loads the files right NEVER.\n\nMulti kits never seem to load right, all the way, or sometimes at all.\n\nStylus RMX has been out for a year and a half now, and we have\n\nnever had a problem of this description reported to tech support.\n\nI'm not saying this isn't occuring for you, but if it is, it\n\nis an extremely rare problem\n\nIf this problem is occuring for you: please send a description\n\nof it to support@spectrasonics.net and be sure to\n\ninclude your serial number is the email message. Thanks.\n\nGlenn Olander\n\nSpectrasonics\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: GlennO\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n9 points\n\nThe Stylus RMX update for MacIntel is a free update and the download is quite small, about 20Mb. It works great on either a MBP or an intel iMac.\n\nGlenn Olander\n\nSpectrasonics\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: JVelasco\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n85 points\n\nDearest Glenn,\n\nI went to the Spectrasonics support page for RMX and downloaded the following for my MacBook Pro:\n\nStylus RMX_1_5_1_UpdatersOSX.zip\n\nThis compressed folder opened to give these other 4 files:\n\n1) 1.5.1 Full Update READ ME.pdf\n\n2) 1.5.1a Documentation Installer\n\n3) 1.5.1d SAGE Converter Installer\n\n4) 1.5a Core Library Updater\n\nI tried installing these 3 files but simply could not get RMX installed. I think I'm missing further instructions.\n\nCould anyone please explain how to go from having nothing to a complete install of RMX including the sample libraries?\n\nI do have all original discs, so please help out a rookie.\n\nThanks,\n\nJV\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: GlennO\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n9 points\n\nThree simple steps:\n\n1) Install: Use the DVD's from the box to install Stylus RMX\n\n2) Update: Download and install the latest update, 1.5.1\n\n3) Intel: Follow the instructions here to get the intel update:\n\nhttp://www.spectrasonics.net/news/intel_mac-spectrasonics.html\n\nGlenn Olander\n\nSpectrasonics\n\nLink"
