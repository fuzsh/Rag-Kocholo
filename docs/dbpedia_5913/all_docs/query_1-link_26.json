        "text": "Re: Spectrasonics Lied! Omnisphere 2 promises broken\n\nAnd by the way - the measure of a good company is not whether they get it right at first. It's whether they get it right in the end.\n\nSo before casting aspersions against Spectrasonics (and accusing them of things that aren't even true) just relax and let them deal with the problem. Don't create a bunch of negative hype for no reason. Relax. Wait. It's too soon. Spectrasonics has a long history of doing good. Give them a chance to do so.\n\nNobody is entitled to constant communication. Wait for meaningful communication.\n\nrgames\n\nThen the measure of a \"great\" company is when they get it right the first time?\n\nI love Spectrasonics. I own all of their soft synths. I do find it ironic though that they left the UVI platform to develop Steam so that they could have more control over their software. Since that time they've released 2 titles that use the Steam engine and UVI has released about 20 and upgraded their software including Mach 5. I like buying new VST's. UVI gets way more of my money than Spectrasonics only because Spectrasonics doesn't release new products very often.\n\nFWIW I'm betting Eric hasn't chimed in here for two reasons:\n\n1) He's working his butt of trying to fix the issues\n\n2) He's embarrassed especially considering he started the thread in a tongue in cheek way and it seems to have backfired.\n\nYou can't make this stuff up.\n\nRe: Spectrasonics Lied! Omnisphere 2 promises broken\n\nVery happy to hear that some of you have overcome the problems of yesterday. I was one of the lucky ones that got everything right the first time. But I did post that with my internet speed you all would be enjoying Omni 2 before me. And sure enough, after downloading all day yesterday and all night, I woke up to 23% downloaded and 23 hours to go. So off I went and found faster internet and an hour ago I finished installing and authorizing! For those of you who haven't enjoyed it yet, you really are in for a treat. This thing is SO much more than more sounds and features. It just sounds better all around. Loving it!!!\n\nI find the reported issues rather off-putting and will certainly wait for the first update. I'm in no hurry.\n\nI think that some people should remember that Spectrasonics was never, until now, a \"online\" company. All their products came by CD-ROMS and still do. I think this is their first major release via their website (well, the upgrade) and I sense that they still lack the experience in taking on such a huge task.\n\nLike someone else said here before, in time nobody will remember that unless of course there are more surprises down the track.\n\nI understand that it's annoying for the people who eagerly awaited the launch, but c'mon, it can't be true that waiting 2-4 days is gonna hurt anyone. You're not relying on this launch in your work. The issue some people had where it broke Omni 1 seemed much more problematic. It's a bit like watching 5-year olds on Christmas Eve reading this thread.\n\nI was out Thursday during the launch so I couldn't get it before Friday (which I intended) - then I read about these problems and I have no problem waiting until sometime next week. I want Omni 2, but I am doing perfectly well without it for a few more days\n\nHey,\n\nlucky to have downloaded among the first :D , but always the same problem :\n\n- the steam folder is searched, but everytime I choose it on Live (on Cubase it's a black screen), it's written that I don't have authorization and to try to run as administrator (even if I run it as administrator).\n\n- then the \"installation was not completely properly\". (patches needs to be upgraded).\n\n- then padlock on the spectrasonics folder. (Even after having changed security).\n\nI saw some tips (other guys had this problem with cubase/windows) but they didn't work.\n\nIf someone has an answer (Spectrasonics only said to \"run as administrator\".\n\n:D\n\nRe: Spectrasonics Lied! Omnisphere 2 promises broken\n\nIs anyone still having difficulty downloading after getting the direct link email from the techshop? I've emailed them again with the issue (waiting for reply - I know they're slammed), but wanted to see if anyone else was experiencing this or found a way around this.\n\nI click the link in the email and get Techshop home page - looks exactly the same as before. I click the Omnisphere2 Upgrade link and get the same Upgrade page as before. Clicking the 'Upgrade Now' button gets me the same message of \"This product requires Omnisphere 1 be installed and registered in your account\". I've already paid for my upgrade (Thursday). It shows up in my account, but now there is no installer for Omnisphere 2.\n\nDid your link take you to the Techshop home page?\n\nRe: Spectrasonics Lied! Omnisphere 2 promises broken\n\nWell I went ahead and upgraded and had no problems at all. The download links in the email they sent me worked fine, their downloader software worked fine, installation was very clear and worked fine, and authorization is still the easiest of any software I own (offline was very easy as well). Though I did not yet upgrade my main system, my Slave PC is running Omnisphere as I want to make sure there are no show stoppers. Looking forward to exploring."
