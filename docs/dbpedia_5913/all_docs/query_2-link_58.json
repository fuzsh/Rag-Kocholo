When you install Omnisphere, you should also have installed any au,vsti or aaxi plugins that came with it. They will be getting installed in the usual place on your machine. Once you have done that, restart FL-Studio and you should be able to access it as a vsti in the normal way.\n\nanswered Jul 6, 2019 at 0:26\n\nMarkMark\n\n8,90011 gold badge1616 silver badges2727 bronze badges"
