I've ordered Omnisphere and am overwhelmed already, even though I haven't received it yet! :-)[/quote] I also have a MacBook but the G5 is still my main music machine. Let us know how you find Omnisphere. 40 GB!!!...it must take some time to install!\n\nReply\n\nOK... Omnisphere took about 35-40 mins per disc (there are 6 discs) to install. Authorization in true Spectrasonics style was painless... downloaded updates (but no tutorial videos online yet). I've not had long to play with it, but it sounds amazing! Briefly looked at the Edit window and there appear to be 6 LFO's!! It's fully multi-timbral and each channel can combine 2 patches... = 16 patches in one Omnisphere plug-in. Some of the sounds are delicious :-) and I really appreciate having \"the best of\" spectraonsics libraries. So far, so amazing! Rounik\n\nReply\n\nI installed omnisphere the other day and it took about 20-25mins per disk for some reason (which seems good compared to what i've heard). I've only got a g5 2.3 ghz 4.5 gig RAM. It seems to be running fine but bit of a cpu hog with my specs, but it's better than I thought. The sounds are awesome :)\n\nReply"
