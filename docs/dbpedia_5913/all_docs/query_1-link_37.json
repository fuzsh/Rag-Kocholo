        "text": "To most people serious about creating music, any device or software beginning its name with an \"i\" immediately prompts a negative or even derisive attitude towards it. It's thought of as amateur and either built exclusively for rich kids or just Mr & Mrs Joe Average family consumer. We all know that Apple designed the iPad primarily as an all-singing-dancing mobile tablet to function somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop - An item of great convenience and primarily as a mobile platform for audio visual entertainment and communication. At first most of us weren't sure how we would use one if we had one, but we have now grown into it. If nothing else the iPad is a very fashionable device, but so is everything bearing the Apple logo and the bottom line is that the gear simply works - It combines working well and stylishly, like a Porsche does.\n\nInevitably, independent software developers have recognised and begun to exploit the iPad's potential as a very useful aid in the field of making music. Its most obvious benefit is as a wireless remote DAW controller, albeit of course with limitations. But unexpectedly perhaps, it solves some of a DAW's limitations, as I will explain.\n\nI love Apple's Logic and how it enables us creatively but I find some of its GUI very frustrating to use. Specifically the tiny knobs for Sends levels and also the Channel Strip Pans. Some of the settings controls in some of Logic's Plug-ins get pretty tedious too, Space Designer being a good example. One well established help in overcoming such tedium is a hardware interface such as a Mackie. I own and love Mackie gear as much as I love Apple products but a Mackie Surface Controller is relatively expensive and needs significant desk space which may be limited in some home studios. Other hardware solutions are a MIDI controller but they either have limitations or you have to learn gobblygook (to me) MIDI language. Enter the iPad….\n\nhttp://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b308/RedRobin_05/Music/HomeStudio_iPad_809v2.jpg\n\nThe iPad can never be a substitute for the tactile glory of top notch motorised faders and high quality encoders but it can be a useful addition to an arsenal of good tools and instruments. It cannot substitute a qwerty keyboard, mouse, or trackpad. Neither can it substitute a MIDI controller. But it can bridge between those devices and bring a few extra goodies to the party too.\n\nApart from the convenience of being a touchscreen wireless remote, what makes the iPad extra useful in a music studio are the third-party software Apps you can install on it. Namely V-Control Pro, TouchOSC, and Spectrasonics Omni TR, and I'm betting that there'll be more to come. Neyrinck, the developers of V-Control Pro, offer Pro Tools, Cubase, and Logic interfaces which are displayed in the same graphic styles we are already familiar with and so the iPad immediately feels and behaves like an extension of something we are already comfortable with using but on a mini monitor and touchscreen.\n\nhttp://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b308/RedRobin_05/Music/iPad_VCP_833v2.jpg\n\n^ V-Control Pro: http://www.neyrinck.com/en/products/v-control-pro - A user-friendly and very natural extension to Logic.\n\nhttp://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b308/RedRobin_05/Music/iPad_TOSC_0830v2.jpg\n\n^ TouchOSC: http://hexler.net/software/touchosc - A slightly alien but very untuitive interface.\n\nThese are the two best DAW remote controllers in my opinion. V-Control Pro has the more familiar interface but TouchOSC has a free editor to create your own pages or layouts - It's interface is more alien but just as powerful and enabling. TouchOSC also has Sends rotaries on the same page which is very useful indeed in my case considering the instrument I play. The two overlap in their features as you would expect in needing to control the same DAW. A third competitor, Saitara's AC-7 Core imitates the Mackie Controller but when that interface is transposed so literally to the iPad it then tends to cancel out the advantages of being able to use a larger scale interface, which is something which Neyrinck and Hexler have recognised. In other words, they have designed their software from the ground up rather than just port a skin to the iPad, which is what AC-7 feels like - All the button controls texts are far too small and that defeats the object.\n\nAC-7 Pro:\n\nWhether you choose to use the iPad to control Logic remotely from a recording booth or from a comfy couch is up to you. Unusually perhaps, I choose to primarily use it right there alongside my 27\" iMac and Novation SL MkII with its Automap software which maps to its own hardware rotaries and faders to Logic. Either way it's important to understand and accept that an iPad only offers touchscreen control of a DAW's more basic functions but also having more clearly visible monitoring of a song's tracks is in practice a very valuable bonus of the iPad. Some might think that having this overlap of functionality is counter productive but I find the opposite is true. When my SL MkII is in Transport mode it doesn't allow me to select any Solo's but I can do so more easily via the iPad than the cursor in Logic itself. Furthermore I can toggle on/off multiple Solo's and Mutes in the song's tracks - Something which Logic doesn't do and other such features are planned. When V-Control Pro doesn't give me easy control of Sends I can quickly and elegantly click the iPad's Home button and the dock is revealed where I can click the TouchOSC icon and it then automatically opens at the same page as V-Control and Logic are having a two-way communication but with big Sends rotaries available at my fingertips. On the iPad I can instantly view a large display and select from which Plug-ins are inserted and henced listed in a track and then act accordingly. I can both instantly see more clearly than in Logic whether a song is Saved and do so with a single touch. Using my small Mackie mixer I can also switch on the big Mackie 450 speaker, roll back my comfy armchair into a secondary sweet spot and still control a few things with the iPad transferred to my lap. These are just a few advantages I have found in only a week.\n\nhttp://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b308/RedRobin_05/Music/iPad_VCP_829v2.jpg\n\nEven without touching its screen to action or edit something, the iPad provides an excellent monitor for comparing tracks and checking settings which Logic struggles to do without straining your eyes.\n\nI have a Konig & Meyer iPad cradle on order which can be mounted on my recording mic stand for remote Transport control and which will also allow much easier remote control over what's feeding my headphones.\n\nK&M iPad 2 holder:\n\nEach of us has our own individual set of devices and instruments to create and edit our music, so we each have our own preferences and ways of using them. By adding an iPad with V-Control Pro, TouchOSC and Omni TR installed, I have broadened my choices and also worked around some limitations, especially of the Novation's badly angled display window and so far sometimes slightly disappointing Automap. When it works it works extremely well, but I expected it to be easier to learn than it is - The marketing vids were too good. On the other hand, the Novation SL MkII is a very enjoyable device for playing and recording software instruments and I'm confident I will grow to like it more as I become more familiar - Someone has already offered to give me some one-to-one training.\n\nADDENDUM (or should that be 'App-endum'):\n\nSince first writing this post I have come across another iPad App worth considering for Logic:\n\neyoControl: http://eyosido.com/\n\nI came across it purely by accident when I spotted an image of its Transport page and thought that's gotta be the very best Transport page I've seen on an iPad so far. If interested, it's worth spending time reading the links on Eyosido's web page about the various features of eyoControl.\n\nhttp://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b308/RedRobin_05/Music/eyoControl_Transport_847.jpg\n\n^ That page is perfect for when an iPad sits in a cradle on a mic stand or is at hand when recording. I decided that it was worth paying £6/$9 US just to have that large and easy to use Transport page. The added bonus are the other features on that page too.\n\neyoControl's other pages look useful too and I particularly like the large wheel to move Logic's line cursor - It's very smooth and accurate. The wheel also appears on the Surface page together with good Transport controls.\n\nhttp://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b308/RedRobin_05/Music/eyoControl_Surface_853v2.jpg\n\n^ The Surface page is very very Mackie-like in its style and transposes and interprets it so much better than AC-7 does. Using MIDI there's a lot more to eyoControl than I've explored yet. It's downside for me is no control of Logic's Plug-in settings. My Novation SL MkII either does the best at that or is a nightmare - It seems to depend on accessing the Plug-in via Automap. If I can master more easily accessing the Plug-ins on the Novation, its hardware controllers are undoubtedly my favourite but of my current iPad-Logic Apps I can easily see myself using eyoControl more often than the other touchscreen Apps.\n\nhttp://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b308/RedRobin_05/Music/eyoControl_Surface_844.jpg\n\nFinally, if anyone has any doubts about the iPad's place in the creative music process, just look at how DJ's are using them and what some of the established serious hardware manufacturers are producing which incorporate a dock and specialised software for the iPad. It's not an essential but it is a great help, and it's cool and fun.\n\n----\n\nI hope some of the info here may be helpful to anyone considering an iPad and that those who already have experience of using it with Logic will add their thoughts - Thankyou.\n\nEdited October 13, 2011 by Red Robin\n\nGreat post man. So which of the three do you recommend the highest: Touch OSC, V-Control, or AC-7? Why use Touch OSC and V-Control in conjunction?\n\n....Firstly, thanks for the compliment\n\nWhich of the three do I recommend highest?\n\n....Well, let's start off by discarding AC-7. Sorry to the folks at Saitara but the interface is what lets it down for me. I guess that if you are already fluidly familiar with a Mackie Logic Controller then the tiny control texts wouldn't matter so much. I think they're trading too much on the 'look-at-me-I've-got-a-Mackie-on-my-iPad' factor. But to be fair I've never used AC-7 and I stand to be corrected if someone would like to post why I'm wrong and what advantages it has.\n\nThat leaves the other two. Personally I really like the Logic-style interface of V-Control Pro (there's also a free non Pro version) and so generally prefer it. It's like a convenient extension of Logic but, of course, cut down. But TouchOSC has some extra features which I like and the layout and size of finger 'pads' is perfect for not making a mistake in touching the wrong control. V-Control isn't bad in that respect but you do need to be just that extra bit careful. TouchOSC's black background might look very stylish and doubtless works particularly well at night if using it in a live performance, but I find it a bit heavy going alongside my Mac etc.\n\nPlease bear in mind that it's early days for my use of these Apps and my opinion may change as I use them more.\n\nBecause Paul Neyrinck is so helpful and friendly I happen to know that he is developing V-Control Pro further. When Apple fix some OSC protocol metering bugs when running in 64-bit mode for example, V-Control Pro will then have metering back (running in 32-bit is the current workaround) and probably with peak indicators. Roll on Logic 9.1.6.\n\nV-Control Pro costs about £35/$50 US but I think you can download a demo. TouchOSC costs only about £3/$5 US. So, if 50 dollars isn't spare at the moment and you have an iPad, then start off with TouchOSC. As a Logic Pro user I don't see the point of the less fully featured free version of V-Control.\n\nWhy use TouchOSC and V-Control in conjunction?\n\n....Simply because one can do some things slightly better than the other and so to get the best of both worlds. If TouchOSC cost more, then the choice might be more difficult but it's cost effective to have both and extremely easy to switch Apps: Double click the iPad's Home button and then touch the presented icon in the Dock - It's a cool move, typically Apple. Because of the common protocol/communication with the host Logic, each App will open in exactly the same page as you were. So it's simply swapping interface and seeing some other controls on offer. Simples.\n\nThese choices always contain a strong element of personal preference but there's nothing in these two Apps which prompts me to say don't bother. In fact, if you have an iPad and use Logic I'd say it's a no-brainer.\n\nI bought my iPad just to run these Apps and did at first feel I'd been foolishly extravagent (yet again!) but now I'm very happy about it, especially as Spectrasonics offer the free Omni TR."
