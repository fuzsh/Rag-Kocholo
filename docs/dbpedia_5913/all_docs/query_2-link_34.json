Try clicking on the Spetrasonics logo on the Omnisphere UI and it will take you to a credits page. In the upper left hand corner, there should be a button to check for updates.\n\nOnce you have the latest updates, which fix some patch problems like you are having, you should be fine.\n\nI can't wait until they get the user manual finished.\n\nIt's funny, I don't think I'll be able to audition all of the sound sources before the next update. There are so darn many sound sources it' not even funny!\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: muso4hire\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n8 points\n\nI had an issue installing yesterday as well. I put Omnisphere on my external drive in a folder called \"Spectrasonics\". 4 hours later after installation was done I went into Digital Performer 5.11 and Omnisphere wouldn't even show up. I checked the application support folder on my boot drive and the component was in fact there. So I then did what the guy on the video explained, and renamed the folder on my external drive \"Spectrasonics Instruments\", opened DP 5.11 and was able to open and authorize Omnisphere, but it couldn't locate the sounds... so I quit, and renamed the folder on the external drive \"Spectrasonics\" again, and everything was fine... I know that sounds wrong, and I did repair permissions a few times during this process anyway hope that helps!\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: stevencravis\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nI am so glad you wrote this here. I've been searching everywhere for someone else that had the problem of Omnisphere (installed on an external hd) not showing up in a host program. I didn't know what to do! My host program is Logic 8. I'm going to try this renaming of the folder, as Spectrasonics Instruments along with Repairing Permissions etc.. and see how far I can get!\n\nAlso, does anyone know if it's safe for me to trash the Intel Atmosphere Host Wrapper left over on my internal drive?\n\nAlso, if anyone well versed at Spectrasonics software is in the San Francisco area, and interested in being paid to teach me over-all usage techniques with Spectrasonics RMX and Omnisphere, I'll pay you for your time. Just send me a message through my profile here with how much you would charge per hour, or for a two hour session, etc...\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Silicon Audio Labs\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n10 points\n\nI have the exact same problem and I installed the latest updates.\n\nI too have second drive that I installed Omnisphere on. It shows up just says that certain patches are missing \"VP333-OtcaVox Ensemble.zmap\" mmay be missing or corrupt.\n\nAny result moving it to your main drive?\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Silicon Audio Labs\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n10 points\n\nHere's what fixed it:\n\nhttp://img160.imageshack.us/img160/718/steamfolderau8.png\n\nMake sure your sound data sizes match the ones in the image above.\n\nIn my case, my internal DVD drive is hoaky. Cheap DVD laser. I hooked up an external DVD drive, via firewire, and drug the files that don't match the sizes in the image. In my case it was two: \"Synthesizers 01.db\" and \"Retro 01.db\" that wouldn't copy using my internal DVD drive.\n\nHere's the source thread that addresses this:\n\nhttp://www.bigbluelounge.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=351456#351456\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: N DECOMP\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nH hope someone can help!!!!\n\nJust got omnisphere put it on my imacs HD but kept getting system overload problems so i spoke with someone at our local apple store and they told me that despite plenty of space and 4gb of ram i should be putting omnisphere on my external drive which i've done - now when i launch omni. from logic 8 i get the omni. interface but it just says user and then i get the following message:\n\ncannot open multi/user/nigelsmith/library/applicationsupport/spectrasonics/steam/defaults/d efault.mt_omn\n\nI'm assuming it can't find the library or something - someone told me to try making aliases for the imacs hard drive but hasn't work yet\n\nps: i've also downloaded the latest updates from spec.\n\nanyone know what to do?\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: JOKO5000\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nHi N DECOMP!\n\ni have the same problem as you...\n\nI also installed Omnisphere to an external HD and now get the message \"Cannot open Multi /STEAM/Omnisphere/Defaults/default.mlt-omn\".\n\nI checked the HD and saw that all data is installed there, because the \"Spectrasonics\" Folder that was created in \"Library/Application support/\" showed a size of 42,14 gB.\n\nI've also downloaded the latest updates from spectrasonics.\n\nAnyone else knows, what to do?\n\nThanks in advance!!!\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: N DECOMP\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nHi jOKO5000\n\nI've emailed les at spectrasonics - he's usually fairly quick at getting back to me - if I get anywhere I'll let you know!\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: JOKO5000\n\nUser level: Level 1\n\n0 points\n\nHi N decomp,\n\nthis is how it worked for me:\n\nMake an alias of STEAM on the external drive, move it to your desktop, rename it so it only says \"STEAM\" and then put it here\n\nMacintosh HD/Users/Username/Library/Application Support/Spectrasonics/\n\nOmnisphere sounds great!!!\n\nLink"
