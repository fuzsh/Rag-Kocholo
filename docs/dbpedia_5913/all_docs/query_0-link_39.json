        "text": "I installed the Omnisphere patch \"Spectrasonics.Omnisphere.2.DVD8\" and the update \"Spectrasonics Omnisphere 2 Patches and Soundsources Update 2.6.3c\" on a virtual machine and it worked but not on my Mac.\n\nThe installation goes well, but when I open the Fl Studio plugin manager there are two Omnispheres, one has the status \"error\" and I can only put the star on the other. When I open Omnisphere there is this message \"This patch library requires a newer version of Omnisphere. Visit the Spectrasonics web site to check for updates.\" after Omnisphere is stuck on the Challenge Code window.\n\nI do not use FL anymore at all. But one thing I notice in your screenshot is your FL is looking at the AU version of the plugin, and I have no idea how that impacts FL/authorization aspects of Omnisphere. Since it is a AU format plugin, I would see what it does in Logic first. (and/or standalone as well)\n\nYour FL does not show /plug-ins/components as an additional scan folder. Does it do this by default, since you show a number of Logic stock plugins too? It has really been a while since I used it.\n\nThe \"patch\" in your last screenshot is in/from the 2.8 update. Are you not done installing all the files required to get to a 2.8 install?\n\nand of course, make sure everything is code signed correctly. error messages can be nearly random looking, if not.\n\nThis is the video I followed:\n\nTake this one: Spectrasonics Omnisphere Software 2.8.0d Patches 2.8.0c Mac Win Update\n\nTo save some Mac headaches. I'll re-post this text\n\n1. Manually install the update first\n\n2. Run Omnisphere, click on the blue 'click here' at the bottom of the Authorization screen - this will copy an Authorization url to the clipboard which contains the encoded Challenge Code\n\n3.Go to https://www.urldecoder.org/ and paste that Authorization url into the topmost frame\n\n- delete the segment 'http://www.spectrasonics.net/authorization?prod=Omnisphere&vers=2.6.4c&ch='\n\nand hit the <Decode> button\n\n4. Run R2R's Keygen, paste the decoded Challenge Code and generate your Response Code\n\n- - - I used the Spectrasonics_2048_KeyGen to patch the plugin binaries. Then ran codesign command on the plugs & all works now.\n\nIt doesn't work\n\nI am on M1.\n\nTake this one: Spectrasonics Omnisphere Software 2.8.0d Patches 2.8.0c Mac Win Update - 26 October 2021 | 327 MB\n\nPLEASE READ Instructions:\n\n• OS X users: Open the Mac folder and run the installer .pkg.\n\n• Windows users: Open the Windows folder and run the installer .exe.\n\nPlease do not move the folders. The installers rely on the folder hierarchy presented in the download to function properly.\n\nThe installer automatically checks to see if you already have a Spectrasonics folder on your startup drive to determine the location of the STEAM and SAGE folders\n\nSpectrasonics Omnisphere 2 for Windows and MAC OS 2021\n\n1.) How to install omnisphere 2 on macbook pro?\n\nwww.ifon.ca/how-to-install-omnisphere-2-on-macbook-pro.html\n\nSpectrasonics: Free Upgrade to Native M1-Processor Support for Omnisphere - June 17, 2021\n\nBig Sur Now Officially Supported\n\nWe are happy to announce that all four Spectrasonics virtual instruments (Omnisphere, Trilian, Keyscape and Stylus RMX) are now compatible and officially supported for use in macOS 11 Big Sur!\n\nApple Silicon Compatibility\n\nThe current status of Spectrasonics instruments compatibility with the new Apple Silicon ARM/M1 processor-based computers is the following:\n\n• Spectrasonics users that purchase an Apple Silicon computer can continue to run our plugins immediately, using the Rosetta 2 technology from Apple (in conjunction with their current Intel-based DAW, which must be opened using Rosetta 2).\n\n• Native Apple Silicon development for Omnisphere, Keyscape, Trilian and Stylus RMX is in progress and going well. We are expecting to release these native “ARM” versions via a free update very soon!\n\nUpdate: All Spectrasonics instruments are natively compatible with Apple Silicon computers, click here for details. www.spectrasonics.net/news/news-content.php?id=125\n\n3.) Apple Silicon Compatibility (M1)\n\nThe latest versions of Spectrasonics instruments (Omnisphere 2, Keyscape, Trilian, and Stylus RMX) are fully compatible with Apple's M1 processor.\n\nIf you’re using an M1-equipped Mac, be sure to update your instruments via these guides:\n\nKeeping Your Instruments Up To Date\n\nUpdating from your User Account\n\nIf you plan on installing your Spectrasonics instruments to an M1-equipped Mac for the first time, please follow the installation guides found here:\n\nHow To Install\n\nDoes your Scan Options set to \"Combine VST/VST3...\" just change how the results are populated into the list? Or does it do something different from Rescan with failed? To me it seems like FL is trying to load Omnisphere as an effects plugin in those formats, and they are not authorized correctly. My legit 2.8 does not show as an fx plugin in Logic, and somehow I have put up with it this long... can't you just move it out of those folders and only allow the AU to be scanned?\n\nI can't see it being \"mixed\" in authorization success and working."
