        "text": "Spectrasonics Releases Omnisphere 1.1 with Trilian Integration\n\nSpectrasonics has released Version 1.1 of its Omnisphere “Power Synth,” featuring native 64-bit Windows support, core library integration with its new Trilian bass module, and more. The new v1.1 is also Mac and Windows 32-bit compatible.\n\nFor users who have both Omnisphere and Trilian, sounds from Trilian can now be opened inside Omnisphere — allowing deeper editing of the Trilian sounds, as well as the creation of layers and splits with both instruments’ sounds in the same environment. The Omnisphere v1.1 update is free to all Omnisphere users as a download from the Spectrasonics website.\n\nThe 1.1 update also gives users additional software support for Trilian’s multichannel soundsources, release layers, round robin samples, and special legato articulation triggering. Omnisphere 1.1 also adds new Memory Management, Sample Thinning and the “Lite Version” feature also found in Trilian for faster loading and auditioning of sounds.\n\nOmnisphere version 1.1 also includes various interface improvements found in Trilian as well as RTAS support for any number of processors on Pro Tools systems.\n\nOmnisphere has an MSRP of $499 US. The v1.1 update is free for all registered users and is now available as a download from Spectrasonics website.
