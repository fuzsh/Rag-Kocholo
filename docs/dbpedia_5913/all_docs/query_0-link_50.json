        "text": "I have watched a lot more of the guitar demo and it sounded more musical to me than all the Soundpaint demos combined.\n\nMore so than the piano or the full compositions? The Omni guitar does sound very special indeed. Not a sound I like personally, but the quality is fantastic. It's a great reminder of just how amazing Omnisphere is, and just how good Spectrasonics sound design is for music.\n\nAlthough I haven't listened to every sound in every sound set demo, Nylon Sky does stand out so far. I am just afraid that if I acquire it, I'd be cheating on my other guitar libraries.\n\nAlso, because these libraries will never go on sale, there is no big rush for me; besides, I am having fun with the Omni guitars in the new strummer arps in 2.8.\n\nThere is one striking omission, that I hadn't considered until now - The lack of MPE.\n\nTo be at v2.8, with such new releases still bereft of a feature that's starting to become quite commonplace (Some of these smart controls would be so well-suited to 5D assignment) is a little concerning. Of course, it doesn't mean that it isn't being worked on in the background, and will seamlessly integrate with these new extension when ready. But I wonder if Spectrasonics just isn't that into the idea and will cut itself and its customers off from that last level of expressivity.\n\nI have watched a lot more of the guitar demo and it sounded more musical to me than all the Soundpaint demos combined.\n\nMore so than the piano or the full compositions?

While they're not bad, but when you've listened to thousands upon thousands of patches across various soft synths, everything starts to get a bit samey after awhile.\n\nI suppose it doesn't help already having a boatload of third party presets, plus the gamut of regular Spectrasonics sounds across various products. Coupled with the existing sound mangling capabilities of Omnisphere, I'm not seeing the need for a whole bunch more sounds.\n\nThen there's the price. At $149 a pop, these are a bit on the steep side. Even with the discount, the four expansions add up to almost the full price of Omnisphere. I can't really justify these at that price point, since this isn't the equivalent of a whole other Omnisphere.\n\nJust not feeling it with this release.\n\npenchant noted ..... initial impressions from Undercurrent ??\n\nWell, the thing is, even if it sounds great, I don't really want any guitar sounds! It's rather a waste of my best asset if I leave the guitar playing to a sampler/synth. I may not be a great guitarist, but I'm better at that than I am at anything else musical. If I want to sketch in a guitar part before playing it, i don't need anything very special. Frankly, I'd normally use a synth or piano.\n\nI have not had time to investigate Undercurrent properly yet. I've looked at Nylon Sky and Unclean Machine at the moment. I have no intention of buying any of them in the immediate future. But, of course, I want all of them! Other than effects, I have just three things that I am keen on buying in the near future. Bunker Samples' Harmonium (which I'm waiting for in case it goes on sale), Physical Audio's Derailer (if it goes on sale, otherwise I'll wait), and a selection of Soundpaint instruments. If an amazing sale comes up, then I'll take a look at Spitfire Audio and Sound Dust.\n\nOmnisphere? I have plenty still to explore and learn. I'm not ready for more sounds at the moment."
