X No. 14 WEDNESDAY, APRIL 14, 2010 American photographer captured 1950s Greece <strong>The</strong> <strong>Hellenic</strong> <strong>Voice</strong> ® <strong>Stockton</strong> <strong>College</strong> students rehearse a scene from “Stones From God,” a play based on oral histories <strong>of</strong> Greek Orthodox Christians forced to leave their villages in central Turkey after the 1924 Treaty <strong>of</strong> Lausanne. Stories from Anatolia <strong>Stockton</strong> <strong>College</strong> play gives voice to Greeks in Turkey before 1924 By STEVE CROWE <strong>The</strong> <strong>Hellenic</strong> <strong>Voice</strong> Just 12 years before the atrocities at Smyrna, Greek Orthodox Christians were still building new churches in villages <strong>of</strong> central Turkey. “A dozen years later these people are not going to be there, but at this moment they are still looking to have rich, full lives and to be able to worship freely,” says Tom Papademetriou, pr<strong>of</strong>essor <strong>of</strong> history at <strong>Stockton</strong> <strong>College</strong>. Papademetriou, 43, has co-produced a play called “Stones from God: True Human Stories <strong>of</strong> a Thriving Greek Christian Community in Ottoman Turkey,” which will be performed April 14-18 at the college’s Performing Arts Center in Pomona, N.J., and later this summer in Turkey. In the play, eight actors portray more than two dozen characters from Cappadocian villages, using their actual words from transcripts <strong>of</strong> their stories, collected by the Center for Asia Minor Studies in Athens. Papademetriou gathered the material, primarily about Christian religious life in the villages, as part <strong>of</strong> a research project on Ottoman period churches in Cappadocia. Pr<strong>of</strong>. Thomas Papademetriou He and a colleague in the theater department, Pr<strong>of</strong>essor Pam Hendrick, then pulled out the best stories and observations, and Hendrick wrote a script for the play. Except for the introduction and ending, and a few transitions, the script uses actual words <strong>of</strong> the villagers. Many <strong>of</strong> the characters in the play, however, are amalgams <strong>of</strong> several people’s voices. <strong>The</strong> stage features a painting that looks like a photo <strong>of</strong> a village, and there are a few props, but the play relies mostly on the actors to convey, through posture and movements, the age and personalities <strong>of</strong> the characters. Life before Lausanne <strong>The</strong> tragic story <strong>of</strong> Greeks in Turkey from 1919-1924 is well known: an estimated 1 million deaths, 1.5 million refugees, and the exile <strong>of</strong> at least 150,000 Greek men to labor battalions after the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). And the most horrific <strong>of</strong> all tragedies, the Smyrna Catastrophe (1922), when young revolutionaries backed by the Turkish army seized and burned the largely Greek city and killed hundreds <strong>of</strong> thousands <strong>of</strong> citizens and refugees. Under the Treaty <strong>of</strong> Lausanne (1923), Greece and Turkey agreed >> Please see PLAY, page 14 $1.50 per copy EU <strong>of</strong>fers $41 billion to Greece BRUSSELS (AP) – Desperate to halt the Greek debt crisis that has hammered the euro, fellow eurozone governments tossed it a financial lifeline April 11, saying they would make euro30 billion ($41 billion) in loans available this year alone – if Athens asks for the money. <strong>The</strong> International Monetary Fund stands ready to chip in another euro10 billion, said Olli Rehn, the EU monetary affairs chief. <strong>The</strong> promise – filling in details <strong>of</strong> a March 25 pledge <strong>of</strong> joint eurozone-IMF help – was another attempt to calm markets that have been selling <strong>of</strong>f Greek bonds in recent days. Markets viewed the March pledge as too vague and carrying such tough restrictions that made it difficult for Greece to access any money. As a result, investors demanded high rates to loan to the government as it struggles to avoid default and pay some euro54 billion in debt coming due this year – rates the government says it can’t go on paying.

Each faces a maximum 25-year sentence if found guilty on the main charges. <strong>The</strong> suspects were arrested in and around Athens Saturday.

A photographic exhibit <strong>of</strong> 1950s Greece is on display April 17 through May 12 at the Citronne Gallery in Poros, Greece. An opening reception will be held April 17. American photographer Robert McCabe took the black and white photographs primarily during trips to Greece in 1955 and 1957 when he was an undergraduate at Princeton University. <strong>The</strong> photos resulted in a personal visual diary that captured the land and its people, from portraits to scenes <strong>of</strong> everyday life and from architecture to landscapes. His artistic interpretation also probed the physical, social and cultural environment <strong>of</strong> Greece <strong>of</strong> the time. In his work, the documentary and the aesthetic become one. His images are characterized by classicism and clarity, strong elements in both his land- Pictured: In the tender, <strong>The</strong>ra, 1955. scapes and his photographs <strong>of</strong> the built environment – being either ancient ruins or folk architecture. Socio-economically Greece was very different in the 1950’s than today. McCabe saw a nobility <strong>of</strong> poverty. He did not sentimentalize or stereotyped his subjects. <strong>The</strong> individuals in McCabe’s photographs are dignified individuals in the center <strong>of</strong> the photographic images <strong>of</strong>ten in a frontal pose, looking eye to eye at the photographer and thus at the viewer. McCabe was born in Chicago in 1934 and grew up in the New York City area. His first photographs <strong>of</strong> Europe were taken in a trip in 1954 to France, Italy, and Greece while he was an undergraduate. He returned to Greece in 1955 and 1957. In 1957, he took a series <strong>of</strong> color photographs in the Greek Islands for the National Geographic Society. Today, McCabe divides his time between New York, Paris and Athens, where his wife was born. >> Please see ENCHANTED GREECE, page 7 <strong>The</strong> Aegaion in port below Fira, <strong>The</strong>ra, 1955 V i s i t u s o n l i n e a t w w w .
