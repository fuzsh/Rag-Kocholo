        "text": "A 12-year-old Greek-Australian from Sydney has been signed to Panathinaikos’ academy with glowing praise from huge football figures, one being Panathinaikos and Greece icon Giorgios Karagounis.\n\nAnthony Fanos was spotted by the Trifylli legend when he visited Australia last September, having been brought over by the Football Brilliance Academy (FBA), run by Nikos Mouzourakis.\n\n“Karagounis immediately recognised Anthony’s talent after a training session he undertook with the\n\nFootballing Brilliance Academy in September at our base in Kingsgrove, Sydney. He was glowing in his description of the key fundamentals he saw in Anthony’s football mentality and technique,” Mr Mouzourakis told Neos Kosmos.\n\nThe coach outlined Anthony’s many qualities that he has observed since the young player joined his academy in 2019.\n\n“Anthony Fanos prefer to play as a central midfielder (attacking) but he is able to play and has proven his versality in a range of different positions from striker to the wings, even in centre back and left back,” he said.\n\n“He is ambidextrous and so plays well with both feet, with a tenacious and competitive edge that drives him. He is intensely passionate with a will to win, but has a sense of confidence and\n\ncalmness on the ball. He demands the ball.”\n\nKaragounis was the key in Anthony’s introduction to Panathinaikos and the young footballer went over to Greece to play in the Paiania Talent Cup in April, an annual tournament that features some of the best talent in Greece.\n\n“Karagounis remained at arm’s length but he has continues to provide support and guidance to Anthony and for that we are all extremely grateful,” Mr Mouzourakis said.\n\nAnthony was observed by a series of Panathinaikos scouts and officials involved with the club’s Academy, including Andreas Lagonikakis, Kostas Mavridis, Kostas Frantseskos, Vangelis Samios (Head coach of the Academy), Agis Meremetis, and Spyros Katsimaris.\n\n“They all watched and observed Anthony during different stages of the tournament, training and games. All of them recognised that he was a top talent for his age. His scouting report reflecting this with ratings of 4/5 and 5/5 for most of his attributes – both physical and mental,” Mr Mouzourakis said.\n\nThe trial proved successful for the young talent who has now joined Panathinaikos’ U13 team.\n\nMr Mouzourakis reminisced on when he first saw Anthony play in 2019 with the U10s team of his academy, having returned from a trip to Europe the night before, and watched as he dominated the match at just eight years old.\n\n“I took the game as I just got back the night before. Never seen this boy before as he had joined whilst I was away. I saw a really small kid wearing his trademark sweatband, very serious, took his first touch straight past a player and placed the ball into the bottom corner,” Mr Mouzourakis said.\n\nHe added that Anthony would chase the kids across the distance of the pitch until he won the ball back, then drive with it to create a counter-attack.\n\n“It was just hilarious to see a kid that small wanting to destroy everyone on the pitch. The same determination he has now is exactly how he was back then. Extremely competitive and gives you 100 per cent consistency in every session. Having Anthony within a session, the intensity immediately rises by 30 per cent.”\n\nThat U10s team indeed won the competition that year, showing just a small glimpse of what was to come.\n\n“It’s been a journey coaching this boy and watching him grow daily. I wouldn’t change it for the world and would happily do it all over again for any kid that reminds me of Anthony.”\n\nAnthony’s parents are working to make sure everything is in order with his move to Greece, as they continue to support their son’s pursuit to become a professional footballer."
