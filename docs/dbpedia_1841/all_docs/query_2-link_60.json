        "text": "The bold French (New)\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nAn Olympics opening ceremony in the unparalleled city of Paris, very bold, partially eccentric and unconventional, super wet and totally French. The Paris Olympics ceremony some adored, some others hated but no one will forget. This openings ceremony will be much memorable to everyone.\n\nI wanna focus this write-up on the woke scenic that really prevailed. And I want to be totally honest and direct. In the beginning, I was a little taken aback. I was slightly shocked. I thought it was a bit too much. And the following day, I totally changed my mind. But what made me reconsider things?\n\nThe first (but minor) group of reasons is few of my dear compatriots who hated not seeing references to ancient Greece that gave birth to the Olympics. All those who preferred the show that their country put on in Beijing or London or Athens or wherever and they hated seeing the stadium tradition being broken or felt that the French ‘promoted’ Paris. Paris needs no promotion by the way. It is literally swarmed by tourist like no other tourist destination. No need to compare. Seize the moment, tune in with the French, see their perspective and culture. Just enjoy without rating and ranking.\n\nThe second (and major) reason is the conspiracy theories of many who think that there’s a global plan that threatens their sexual identity. The hysterical screams of those who being truly vulgar write insults and call others names in the social media in an unacceptable and gross way.\n\nThis attitude, this dangerous mindset confirms to me that the French did the right thing. We actually need more of this. We desperately need more woke. We need more diversity. We need more inclusion. We need more justice. We need more equality. We need more respect. We need more love. In this tug-of-war, we need to pull hard towards the woke side even if that means things to go way too provocative sometimes for managing one day to land somewhere in the middle hitting the sweet spot. We must change. I am trying to change and be more receptive and accepting and my daughters have helped me so much in this direction. We all have to change and open our minds and hearts.\n\nThe French made mistakes of course. There was some collateral damage with their Last Supper makeover for example that they made religious people to feel that Christianism was mocked. But they apologized for that. Apology accepted. Overall, I will tell a big Bravo to my fellow bold French. Kudos, guys. You helping us to change. Keep it up!!\n\nShould leaders cry?\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nA week ago Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Greek men’s basketball team to winning the qualifying tournament and booking their so desired spot in Paris Olympics. In the end of the game, Giannis burst in emotional tears, making me reflect a lot about it.\n\nAre leaders supposed to cry? How safe it feels seeing your leader showing such vulnerability? Can your teammates or citizens or corporate team members trust you next? Can they really rely on you? Can they invest their future in you?\n\nNicola Bryan on the interesting BBC news article How do we feel when leaders cry? (bbc.com) mentions many leaders who have been caught on camera weeping. Winston Churchill, Barack Obama, Theresa May and Margaret Thatcher are some of them. She says that the public can perceive the tears differently depending on the reason behind them. People accept their leaders showing vulnerability but not crying out of self-pity and people accept their leaders crying when they feel that it’s not fake “crocodile tears”.\n\nI really believe that things have changed big time compared to one or two centuries back that people would want their leaders constantly demonstrating self-control. How many times, we heard the adults telling us and others: “men don’t cry”? Things have changed big time. It is not only acceptable but sometimes even preferable leaders to show vulnerability and cry out of pain or joy. But the crucial thing is what you do next. How you move forward. Because we all want leaders strong enough to fight for themselves and us. We want leaders emotional intelligent enough to lough and cry hard with us. We want leaders honest enough to admit their weaknesses to us. We want leaders accountable enough to take responsibility for their miss outs. We want leaders resilient enough to reset, reframe and bounce back in times of adversity. We want leaders human enough.\n\nWe want Giannis to stay composed and fight tough, leading his teammates to more victories in Paris and why not cry happy tears from joy once again.\n\nTravel streak: 1 month, 3 continents, 7 countries\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nI kicked off my 35,000 km travel streak, flying to Toronto CA on May 13 and then Riyadh SA, Reading UK, Brussels BE, Belgrade RS, Bucharest RO followed and finally closed this today June 17 with Warsaw PO. It was tiring, challenging, educational and rewarding and perhaps the latter two made me overcome the fatigue and embrace the challenge.\n\nYou maybe understand now why you haven’t heard from me and www.georgetalksales.com lately. Many of my weekend days were spent at airports and the literally 3 work days spent at the office in France or at home, were really long days full of back-to-back calls and often I was double booked. Must had dinner with my wife about six or seven times.\n\nHow I managed to get done with in one piece, alive and kicking?\n\nTaking good care of myself: Making time no matter what to exercise four times a week, not counting the days that I did stretching only. Eating carefully and maintaining my dietary routines. I actually lost some weight instead of gaining like you usually do eating out every day. Avoiding alcohol and sometimes that I felt like having a drink, rarely it was more than a pint of beer or a glass of wine. Meditating for helping my mental health. Finally, sleeping well. Or at least trying to. There I have room for improvement. Stress and jet-lag makes things tough often and must admit that my melatonin gums did help a lot.\n\nHaving a purpose: You gotta love your job. You must find purpose in what you do and thank God that is my case. I like training so much. I adore helping my colleagues to learn and develop. I learn myself with and from them every day. This whole thing is so much rewarding. You can come from a sleepless night, deliver for a third day in a row and when you see the training’s evaluation with a near three digit NPS or hear the sales leader, thanking you warmly for the learning experience you provided his team, your chest gets pumped up, you pack and you take the plane for the next trip full of energy and enthusiasm.\n\nWhat I loved the most?\n\nThe very first thing is the multicultural character of Ericsson globally that fascinated me. It was really amazing, having in one group of 20, people from a double digit number of different nationalities. That was the case pretty much everywhere. And what I liked the most maybe is that the locals who were a minority, love this. They welcome, embrace and nurture our multicultural blend. That’s another thing that got me going, giving me energy and adding to purpose. But there’s one more thing that I loved a lot. The quality of our people and the work discussions and out of work chats over dinner with my peers. Such exchanges help you understand each other better and get you respect each other more (Johan, thanks for our endless talks, mate!).\n\nWould I do this again? Hell yeah!!\n\nPS a big thanks and hug to my wife Katerina who puts up with me and supports me continuously.\n\nReturning to Elon University, my alma mater\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nYou take a restless charismatic Chaplain who walks the talk and a visionary Dean who has trust in people, you mix with an alumni who adores the school he graduated from and helped him reframe things and find purpose in his youth, you put in a leading Business School that drives learning innovation and you serve with students eager to learn and develop.\n\nThat was the magic recipe of the return trip to my alma mater this week after 35 years. Everything started few months back. Chaplain Richard McBride was responsible for the International Students in the late 80’s when I was a student at Elon University in the US and we stayed connected all these years. It was back in June when seeing in the social media a career advance I had, he tagged Dean Raghu Tadepalli, telling him that it would be great for both the School and me if I could be given the opportunity to speak at Elon University. Dean Tadepalli suggested to have a zoom call and the rest is history.\n\nI was honored to participate in the Sales Advisory Chandler Board meeting, I spoke to 100+ faculty and students, I spoke to three classes of the Professors Chris Nelson and George Talbert on sales models, I met with the students of the dual program with University of Reims that Professor Hani Tadros leads, I met with Chaplain McBride and Dr Rudy Zarzar the Academic Advisor I had back in my Elon days, I saw after 35 years my buddy and roommate Pierre Mortemousque that we had a lot to catch up on and I experienced living on this lively, vibrant campus that means so much to me. I also enjoyed a fantastic two hour tour with the excellent professional Jonathan Miller who showed me how much Elon has grown.\n\nDuring my speech I shared with the audience how Elon really helped me to find purpose during my youth that I was coasting for some time and how the School equipped me with skills that helped me in life and supported my corporate journey. Elon was the place that I learned to network with the right people being a ‘giver’, to value preparation, to persevere and seek out coaching for resetting, to know and love my numbers, to respect others and have a high degree of integrity at work and to continuously develop my communication and influencing skills. I also spoke to the students of the Business School about the skills they need going out there if they want to succeed in sales: sell with insights, have rigor in everything they do in sales, be tech savvy, work on their power skills and especially demonstrate cross-functional team leadership and be learning agile.\n\nA three day lifetime experience for me. Three days at my School. My School which is today #40 Business School in the US, something that makes me super proud. My School with all those thirsty students and fine Academics such as Associate Dean Haya Ajjan and Professor Coleman Rich that I loved spending time with and exchanging. But it would be a major miss out to close my review without referring to Kim Phipps who was always there for me planning and executing everything and helping me and Elon to get the max out of my visit. Kim whom I called a ‘pass key’ joking when we spoke but now that I think about it again, I should have called ‘Red Queen’ inspired by Lewis Carroll and his Red Queen who meets with Alice in Wonderland and runs with grace all over, right and left, rapidly and continuously.\n\nLong Live, Elon!!\n\nFlex your Skills\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nWho hasn’t stand in front of the mirror, flexing his muscles and checking out himself? If you don’t do so after all, how will you know where you’re strong at and what are the muscles you need to work out on more. Shouldn’t we do that with our skills? Shouldn’t we find a way to understand what our skills gaps are and then do to the learning gym for filling in those gaps?\n\nMy colleague Cristina shared with me earlier today a quote of Leland Val Vandewall that I literally adored: “The degree to which a person can grow is directly proportional to the amount of truth they can accept about themselves without running away”. So damn true.\n\nThe more blind spots we have, the less we grow.\n\nThe better we know the critical skills for our job, the faster we get in the right track.\n\nThe more thorough we see and accept what we’re missing, the better chances we have to get the miss-outs.\n\nThe better we plan around our development, the easier we’ll get where we want.\n\nThe braver we are to seek out feedback from people who have the expertise, the more we decrease the chances of staying with our blind spots.\n\nThe more frequent we speak up asking for help, support and coaching, the more we get valuable help for growing.\n\nThe more we plan to grow, the more we inevitably change our behaviors and develop our skills.\n\nHowever, learning is neither an easy nor a simple journey. It often hides setbacks and failures which can get you upset and occasionally drive you to lose your self-esteem. The inner dialogues we often have are double-edged swords as they can help us anchor in our heads the purpose and the rewards or sometimes the other way around drive us to vicious cycles with anchoring the pitfalls and consequences. It’s those times that we need to reframe challenges and stick with the purpose or perhaps re-invent purpose.\n\nLearning though is king in nowadays. Living in a workplace that is going through a mega transformation and experiencing a huge digital disruption, we cannot but make sure we reskill and upskill continuously and consistently. We have no other way but being regulars at the learning gym so we can gain the right to stand in front of the mirror and flex our muscles, flex our Skills, reward ourselves and embark on a new learning journey. Because learning and developing never stops.\n\n10-year work anniversary: Adaptability, Stamina and Respect\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nIt was ten years ago that I got on the boat to cross first the Ionian and then the Adriatic Sea, get to Ancona and then head to Paris driving. It was ten years ago when family and I made the decision to leave Greece and move to France joining Ericsson which was a huge milestone in the lives of all three of us.\n\nWhen my wife and I first shared with our daughter Chryssa, she literally freaked out. She was only nine years old and it was impossible for her to accept that she needs to leave behind her sister Nassia and her grandmas and friends for moving to a place that she hadn’t visited before. And her journey wasn’t easy at all. Although she had the time to have intensive lessons with a private tutor for several months, still she had a hard time in the beginning. But her aptitude for foreign languages, the solid French educational system and the fact of course that kids are anyway fast learners helped big time. In the end of her first school year, she was fluent and in the end of the second one, fully integrated culture wise. Today she’s a freshman student at Aix-Marseille University living on her own and studying guess what, French Literature and Philosophy, making us damn proud. If there’s one word that characterizes Chryssa’s journey is no other than “adaptability”. A huge quality.\n\nMy wife Katerina had probably the hardest job to do. She had to give up her job in Athens and take on the tough task to look for a job in a language that she knew a little and her level was way far from a professional one. She studied hard, made French friends that she associated a lot with and dived deep in the French way of living. This way she managed to skyrocket the level of her French, understand France and enabled herself a couple years later to seek out and get a great job. What an achievement especially if we consider that at the same time, she never stopped supporting Chryssa and me. We’re all so proud of her. The magic word here is stamina. Whet Katerina did, took a lot of “stamina”.\n\nMyself I had the easiest job, coming here all set up and working in English which is pretty much like playing home ground. Only one thing to focus on: Ericsson. Started with an individual regional role and having today a leadership global role that I love, being part of a fantastic team. When it comes to my French, well…we better change subject 😊. Reflecting on my journey, it’s one word that comes to mind: “Respect”. Nothing else really.\n\nRespect for France that provided so much to me and my family. Respect to Ericsson this super human-centric organization that never stopped giving me room to develop despite the fact that I am heading objectively speaking towards the sunset of my career. I love France and I adore Ericsson. Thank you both for this amazing ride that I wish it lasts many many more years.\n\nWhat I tell my daughter before her new student life\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nWe’re packing today for driving our daughter Chryssa to Aix-en-Provence tomorrow to help settle and start her studies at Aix-Marseille University. Planning to leave behind our little one after 18 years, putting between us 743 km, it’s neither easy nor simple for me and my wife. Although we might need ourselves some good tips soon for reinventing our relationship, for now I will stick with advising my daughter and all the kids going through a similar situation. A situation I experienced myself exactly 38 years back and I had to learn things the hard way.\n\nThe top priority is to mind your social life. Might wondering what kind of dad I am putting first the social life. But it’s super key. Our social life impacts our mental health big time. When your leave behind family and friends, you need to recreate your social network and at the same time you need to stay connected with your old buddies. But thanks to the social media the latter is not that difficult. The big task is to make new good friends. You need then to be open, choose to eat at the school cafeteria and not home alone, take part in clubs and associations, do team sports, pursue opportunities for group projects and studying. The more people you get to know the more chances you have to find the right friends for you, friends for life.\n\nAix-Marseille University has 80,000 students (in Aix and Marseille) out of which 10,000 are internationals from 100 different countries. What an awesome opportunity for Chryssa and all the kids to open their minds. I always tell everyone that I left Eon University holding two degrees. The Bachelor of Science one that the school gave to me and the one I earned from being good friends and roommates with people from all over the world. Those beers at 2 am discussing about our lives before Elon in New Jersey, Stockholm, Bordeaux, Mexico City, Amman and so many other places, really paid off. I went back to Athens four years later way wiser and richer.\n\nAnother tip is about having the right balance. I first said that it’s super important to prioritize your social life and make many good friends that you can count on, have fun and learn with. But the purpose shouldn’t be forgotten. There’s a learning and development purpose that should always be the kids’ compass for respecting theirs and their parents’ efforts. For securing their future. Gotta find the sweet spot between having fun and achieving your academic objectives then. You need to talk to your professors when you don’t understand things, associate not only with students you’re alike but also those you have a complementary relationship with and you can help each other. And miss no classes. Having good notes is something cannot be replaced by studying before the exams sometimes.\n\nLovely and precious times that I feel so nostalgic for. My last tip cannot be other than: seize every damn moment because such moments never come back, take good care of your health and remember that we’ll always be there for you. Any day, any moment. We love you!!\n\nFind purpose at work\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nWe were cruising through some YouTube music videos with my wife Katerina when we bumped into the concert for the 50 year career of the Greek singer Vasilis Papakonstantinou. A 73 year old man on stage bursting with energy and energizing a huge crowd that had swarmed the stadium. Super good!\n\nKaterina looked at me, saying: “how come he’s like that while others looking forward to retiring the earliest possible?”. She was so damn right. My mind traveled back in ’98 when I had the chance to see the Rolling Stones in Athens and I was open-mouthed watching Mick Jagger at his mid 50s running like crazy left and right on a roughly 100 meters stage for about 2 hours. The funny thing is that he does more or less the same thing 25 years later. How come we see so many actors doing theater and movies at their late 80s? Why the vast majority of us who are white collars (the people who do hard labor jobs are another story and I cannot put in the same equation) cannot and we seek out retiring yesterday if possible? Why only few of us consider doing some kinda part time job at the best either because we lack hobbies or we struggle with the pension we get? What explains this huge difference?\n\nIs it the passion about what they do that they have over the top and we lack? Is it because we’re drained sourcing energy from family, relationships, friends, sports, spiritual activities and volunteering maybe for getting going while their main source of energy has been their job itself? Is it the love they have for their job because they followed their heart when they were young while we compromised maybe choosing a profession with logical criteria and ranking employability first?\n\nAnd what can we do now for overturning this situation? And please don’t take me wrong. I play no advocate of the ones who want to raise the retirement age because there are huge barriers such as ageism at the work-place that hinder this even for the ones who want to continue. My message here is about finding a way to make our job purposeful, meaningful, more fun, get up before the alarm goes off and rush to go to our office because we have love and passion for what we do there. We definitely unfortunately cannot travel back in time and choose to be singers and make top ten hits, actors and play in West End, authors and write best sellers, football payers in the final of Champions League, doctors and save kids in Black Africa.\n\nWe gotta be realistic and change things we can. And this is something, we cannot wait for management to do for us, going only with the motions. We have to work on our own to make it happen. Perhaps we must take the risk to change job leaving behind a toxic environment or job role doing something challenging or decide to take the lead of our team that we were hesitant to do before or get reskilled for pursuing a role that we have a passion for. We owe this to ourselves for living purposefully and happily the rest of our working years and being the rockstars on our stage.\n\nHow to quickly succeed in your new job\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nPerhaps I should be more concerned with the large workforce reductions in tech including the company I work for but this is a sensitive and gloomy issue that I wouldn’t like to touch for now. I’d rather have a write up on something way more positive that a good friend’s request got me thinking a lot about the last days. How someone can succeed quickly in a new job role and company.\n\nLet’s make a step back. My good old friend Franck (true story but the name is random for the sake of the article) asked me to zoom last week because he had some exciting news to share with me. We did meet up. He had just accepted a fantastic job offer about a global role with way more responsibilities, way more money and a way bigger potential. Franck was ready to make a huge leap career wise. Fantastic news indeed. I was so happy for him. He then sought out my help. He wanted to know how he could alleviate risks and increase his chances to succeed and succeed quickly in his new company and job role. He was conscious of dealing with a once-in-lifetime opportunity that he had to thrive.I shared right away some first thoughts that occurred to my mind but I promised to come back with more ideas.\n\nThere you go, Franck:\n\nActivity: my first tip is about showing activity although I know that this might sound old-fashioned given that performance and business impact matter more. During the first days that you have no opportunity to show impact and make the difference, putting time, being present and showing activity matters. For example, if you’re a sales professional, have many customer calls.\n\nVisibility: it’s not far from being active but with visibility I mean to create opportunities for making yourself visible and start building your own brand within the new company. For example, learn and use the company’s social media etiquetteinternally and externally (i.e. Yammer, LinkedIn).\n\nRelationships: socialize with your new colleagues. Be nice, be available, be a “giver”, and work on building your network fast.\n\nUnderstanding: understand the company’s existing situation, pain points, how they make and save money, key objectives, ways of working and your key stakeholders that will decide or influence directly or indirectly your future there.\n\nFeedback: you need feedback big time. Seek it out. Reach out to your manager, teammates and key stakeholders and understand where you stand, how you go and what you could do better. Fill in your gaps and leverage your strengths.\n\nManager: Team up with her. She believed in you. She trusted you. Trust her back and show it to her. You need her feedback and support in particular. Make sure you support her as well.\n\nImpact: I started with activity which is counterintuitive in nowadays. Cannot though miss out impact. Make sure you set some short run goals (agreed with your management) and have some quick wins there.\n\nCelebration: But make sure also that you celebrate your wins and communicate well what you have achieved. Call a review meeting or make use of an internal newsletter. Remember that you’re not a Boy Scout working for the greater goodonly after all (although even them put on their badges to show off their achievements).\n\nOffice: yeah, go to office. I know it sounds bizarre but in today’s hybrid way of working, it matters pointing this out. During the first months or year, regardless of what kind of contract you have, plan going more often to the office. You will integrate faster and you’ll understand better your corporate culture. Unless of course your role is such that you have no choice but working remotely.\n\nThese are my two cents for my friend Franck and everyone shares with him the same exciting challenge. A challenge that tens of thousands of people being laid off worldwide these days would die for. Take the challenge, prepare for and ace it. Good luck, Franck!!\n\nFrom Adam Strange to ChatGPT\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nWhen I was a kid, one of my very favorite comics was Adam Strange. It was a rather cool comic published from the late 50s thru the early 60s. When I started being capable of reading magazines, it had already been discontinued in Greece but I discovered and got access to that through trading old magazines with older kids. It was featuring an archaeologist who was teleporting between planets with his super jetpack, had a laser gun, a powerful suit and helmet protecting him in tough situations and he would develop his intellect with studying. Ray guns and flying cars all around. This is how people were fancying their future, our present, back then.\n\nBut things turned out to be less fancy. Cars still drive in the streets and guns fire bullets. Things did evolve big time of course but towards a different direction. The author of Adam Strange who wanted his hero learning from studying and travelling had not foreseen Artificial Intelligence (AI). Did not expect the breakthrough app ChatGPT developed by OpenAI that comes to revolutionize in such way our interaction with Artificial Intelligence (AI) that creates unthinkable really opportunities and threats, hopes and fears.\n\nChatGPT answers your questions with fab language skills, generates answers that will look and sound human-like, writes poems that will blow the mind of your husband, wife or partner on Saint Valentine’s day next week, does your school homework while you play video games, tailors your brief bio and resume to a specific job post, saves you from the hassle of looking for reviews about the tablet you’re interest in buying, cracks a joke and keeps you company a night you feel lonely, proposes a good Italian recipe for lasagna that you so much love, helps you get done with the book that you have beenstruggling years to finish. I can go on and on for hours talking aboutthe opportunities around counseling, telemedicine, fitness coaching, teaching, outbound and inbound sales and customer service and of course code programming. ChatGPT is an application with enormous and unpredictable (for the good and the bad) capabilities.\n\nBut there are numerous threats as well. How the employability of so many people like sellers, customer service reps, entry level programmers, teachers will be affected? So many jobs will be lost. Others will be created of course but are they will be enough to make it up? Will the school system support the new skills needed? Are the companies willing to invest (really invest and not with big meaningless powerpoints and mission statements) in the reskilling of their more mature employees, helping them with their challenging reinventing journey? And what about the intellectual property of artists, scientists, researchers and authors? How this will be protected? What about students who will choose to somehow cheat (themselves actually) by having the app doing the big bulk of work and them only the finetuning (perhaps in few years no finetuning will be needed)? It’s so bizarre that ChatGPT is already talking about and working on the detector of AI generated text ChatGPT’s creator made a free tool for detecting AI-generated text – The Verge .\n\nThe king question is how we can leverage this technology for good, in an ethical way, respecting each other, sourcing credible only information and anticipating the numerous threats. This takes planning, collaboration, legislation and above all a sincere will by both the state and the private sector. Meantime play with ChatGPThttps://chat.openai.com/ , learn from and help it to learn from you.If Adam Strange manages to teleport with his powerful jetpack, he will be damn astonished.\n\nInterested in checking out George’s recently published book 90 Short Stories for Better Business?

I would like then to recommend 4+1 books that I read in 2022 for 4+1 different reasons that I will elaborate in below.\n\n1 Range: How Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World\n\nDavid Epstein starts putting us before the dilemma: We want a world of Rogers or Tigers? He then explains that while Tiger Woods was winning bets playing golf with adults when he was at kindergarten, Roger Federer was exposed in many different sports before he finally focuses on tennis at his fifteen. And he goes on with citations of numerous studies in different areas such as music, science etc, showing how important and more effective is to have a broad range and be a well-rounded person.\n\n2 See No Stranger: A Memoir and Manifesto of Revolutionary Love\n\nAn amazing book by an amazing woman. Valarie Kaur, a civil rights lawyer, travels us through her Sikh family’s experiences and the discrimination they suffered from and explains why the compelling force of love can help us replace darkness with light and together build the better world that we want and deserve.\n\n3 Thinking, Fast and Slow\n\nWhat can I really say about this incredible psychologist and economist who has been awarded with the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics Sciences for his work on behavioral economics. In this book, Daniel Kahneman explains how we tend to anchor and trip up ourselves, resulting in having biases and making the wrong decisions and helps people overcome prejudice, improve behaviors, make better decisions and have a better life.\n\n4 The Jolt Effect: How High Performers Overcome Customer Indecision\n\nTo be totally honest, still reading this one which got in the bookshelves few only weeks back. His co-author author Matthew Dixon (Ted McKenna is the other one) is the author and researcher behind the huge breakthrough book and sales model of Challenger Sales. This time, Matthew Dixon explains why we make a mistake treating every stalled business opportunity like there’s a status-quo bias while the extended research showed that indecision often has its roots not at the preference of the existing situation but at the fear of doing the wrong thing. He then proposes the JOLT paybook for fighting indecision appropriately. A book, I totally recommend to all sales professionals managing B2B complex sales deals.\n\n5 90 Short Stories for Better Business\n\n4+1 I told you for a reason. The reason is that the fifth book I would love to hear you chose to read is not a book that I simply read. It’s the book that I wrote. Nothing to do with the books in above which are out of my league. But it’s a book written with love and experience. Love for sales. Love for the corporate world that I entered when I was very young and 33 years later, I brag that I have so many stories to tell for. Stories that helped me learn and develop. Stories that I want to share with you, hoping that they will help you make your own stories. Afterall, we are our stories.\n\nWish you Happy Holidays together with your beloved ones!!\n\n“Quiet quitting”? Really?\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nQuiet quitters make up at least 50% of the U.S. workforce, the Gallup research finds and the LinkedIn editor Yessi Bello Perez LinkedIn defines “quiet quitting” as follows: “is about rejecting the notion that work has to take over one’s life and that employees should go above and beyond what their job descriptions entail. According to Metro, this can take many forms – including turning down projects based on interest, refusing to answer work messages outside of working hours or simply feeling less invested in the role.”\n\nPeople in the US experience some very low unemployment rate which perhaps explains the luxury of becoming a quite quitter but the bizarre thing is that we see this trend becoming global and spreading even in Europe where unemployment varies from 6 to 13% for God sake. 500+ people participated in a survey in April in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland out of which 50% said they experience severe stress and mental health issues in the post-Covid era Nearly half of European workers at high risk of mental health issues, new poll shows | Euronews. Perhaps this explains.\n\nBut the key question here is: Quiet quitting is a solution? How come? Why?\n\nBurned out? Tired? Underpaid? Sick and tired of your boss? Disappointed with the poor leadership you experience? Fed up with the crap that my generation got you into? Looking for some better work life balance? And you choose to quit and get quite? Really?\n\nNow it’s your time to get damn louder my friend and change things. Help to get our lives better. Raise your voice, speak up, oppose your manager, get another job, a purposeful job, learn, develop, get better and help yourself, your future, your family and secondarily the organization you will decide to work for. Really work for. Wholeheartedly. As you deserve. Life is a hands on game for no quitters. Life is a game for people who have a purpose and when they’re not given a purpose, they work harder to find and create one and then they stand up and fight for that. If you experience lousy and uninspiring leadership, have ownership. Demonstrate self-leadership.\n\nI had in a training of mine (voluntarily) today a 60+ year old participant who’s retiring in few months time. This is the mindset. This is the kinda answers we need to our problems. Learning, developing, trying and fighting to the end.\n\nInterested in checking out my recently published book 90 Short Stories for Better Business?

It worked. On top of those payoffs, I am having fun. I love it. A week back, I had my first after holidays practice and an interesting conversation with my coach.\n\nHe pointed out that my straight right is very strong while my left one is very weak. This got me thinking. Some years back, this would have been totally reasonable and understood as I am big time right-handed. Would be of no surprise. I can hardly trust my left with a Q-tip for God sake. But seven years ago, I had an accident while bench pressing, I ruptured my right chest and I chose not to have a surgical repair as it doesn’t affect my normal daily function. I only lost roughly 10% of my right’s strength on various strenuous activities and 20% on bench press specifically. If you see me benching today, you’ll notice that when I am on a bench press load mode, my right, the supposed to be good hand, always struggles following the left. However, my coach said that in boxing still my right functions way better and it’s way stronger. Bizarre!\n\nBizarre but I will dare to explain. On benching and some other tough activities which require strength, my injured right arm has a hard time to respond. Boxing though is not like that. It’s not only about strength. Technique is hugely significant and it’s actually the catalyst of power there. It was technique that made Muhammad Ali so good at boxing. No wonder why he was bragging about “flying like a butterfly”. It was his technique and of course intelligence that enabled him to knock out George Foreman who at the time was at his prime, younger and stronger on the famous ‘rumple in the jungle’ fight in Zaire in 1974. It’s about skill as well and here comes the Power of Skill. Interesting, isn’t? Skill gives you power!! Skills gets you way stronger.\n\nIsn’t like that in all areas? Aren’t skills that get us better equipped and stronger in our professional life? Isn’t having skills, learning how to improve our skills and willing to learn new skills the stuff that guarantee our employability? And in today’s world that the education provided is unfortunately still more knowledge than skill based, we all need to seek out experience and opportunities for learning by doing. The skill we need to start with is no other than learning that is a major skill itself. Learn how to learn, learn how to apply knowledge that we get from school to practical situations on our jobs. Learn to get skilled and eventually stronger. Learn to leverage the power of skill.\n\nInterested in checking out my recently published book 90 Short Stories for Better Business?\n\nIf in Greece you may order at any preferred bookshop of yours or use the following eShop to order https://www.politeianet.gr/books/9786188249882-pastidis-george-koukounari-90-short-stories-for-better-business-337558 If outside Greece, go on your Amazon convenient site and order, searching by my name or the book title.

On one hand very spectacular with two athletes demonstrating their high level of tennis skills and intelligence and on the other hand disappointing, seeing two athletes competing in being rude and immature, and an audience loving and often encouraging these disgraceful and appalling behaviors of both.\n\nThings got way too heated with Nick Kyrgios and Stefanos Tsitsipas yesterday. Nick was business as usual. Enormously talented with a huge serve and at the same time bad-mannered and once again big time focused on fighting with the umpire and finding every possible way to get in the mind of Stefanos, turning the tennis match into some kinda circus performance. He did play excellent tennis but at the same time, he played with Stefanos’s mind who proved to be his easy victim. Stefanos played fantastic tennis but being mentally vulnerable, he allowed Nick to play with his mind, becoming his copycat. They played four sets on court and a fifth one is still on, exchanging insults over tv interviews and social media.\n\nCould Stefanos do any better? Yes, he could.\n\nHe should have been prepared better. Not tennis speaking because his tennis was adequate. He knew Nick well. So his team. He should know and have accepted from the very beginning how things would turn. Sports are not exactly lovey dovey. Neither competitive athletes. Especially the ones who have Nick’s temper and eccentric behavior who consistently are disrespectful to everyone. He should have first accepted that having it given and be better prepared mentally to deal with.\n\nStefanos chose to play villain on court mirroring Nick’s behaviors and then go on an interview and switch to the victim’s role. Both choices are wrong and did anything but helping his case. He should have let off steam, totally ignore Nick, continue focusing on his great tennis. The more he would have behaved like that the more he would have destabilized Nick, the more Nick would be left all alone arguing with the umpire, drowning on his own. Perhaps Stefanos would have achieved one more key thing this way. The audience would have teamed up with him, treating Nick as a villain and not as an entertainer.\n\nNick and Stefanos are very good tennis players, making a treasure for the tennis world. Nick and Stefanos need serious help though. They need coaching not on playing tennis because this they master. They desperately need help with their attitude. They need to mature up. This way they will blossom, becoming tennis legends. The potential is there.\n\nPS if there’s one thing that they both did good is that they did have the handshake of the here attached photo which BBC needs to explain the tennis world why they chose not to show live. Is this their way to make tennis intriguing and attractive?\n\nMaybe there’s some purpose\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nI was in a panel interview some months back and I heard the candidate speaking about having a purpose in his job. Of course, I remained polite, treating this person with respect but deep inside me, I didn’t appreciate that. I thought that it was too much. It’s often that I hear corporate people in general or even sales enablement practitioners speaking about having a purpose. But purpose for me is something way bigger, something way higher.\n\nPurpose for me it’s what those doctors and nurses in hospitals fighting Covid had. Purpose has the teacher who has dedicated her life to educating children often for a small compensation. Purpose is what drives army officers who are there to protect their countries.\n\nBut something totally unexpected occurred yesterday that made me start reconsidering things. Recently, I had my first book published and I got a notification on LinkedIn about a post referring to my bookthat really surprised me. A contact of mine(1) Ioanna Karatzoglou | LinkedIn that we have never met before, had posted the following message together with a photo of my book:\n\n“Before more than a year, I had the privilege to attend an eye-opener seminar for Sales Enablement Program from Mr. George Pastidis, Assoc CIPD . A very practical seminar, full of authentic advices and different selling approaches.After this, I decided to regularly follow Mr. Pastidis blog (https://lnkd.in/e_mMJSre). Sometimes, I agreed with his point of view and sometimes …I agreed less! Whatever was the case, Ihave to admit that I was always looking forward for his next post!\n\nAnd here we are now with Mr Pastidis book which I have just received! “90 short stories for better business”. I am so excited to read it, as I am sure that his “Short stories” comes along with big ideas for better business. Especially, the chapter related to “Negotiations”-very helpful, at least for me.\n\nMr George Pastidis, Assoc CIPD: Thank you for sharing your experience and knowledge with us.\n\nI am looking forward for your next post 😊”\n\nAnd yes, Ioanna’s post honestly got me thinking that maybe there’s some kinda purpose in the humble, trivial, not that important job of sales training, sales learning and sales enablement. Maybe that interviewee that I hadn’t thought very highly of, knew better.Maybe helping young professionals to grow and develop, involves purpose. Maybe writing or speaking about things that shed some light in areas that learners struggle with, is purposeful. Maybe there’s some purpose after all.\n\nBe like detective Wallander or not?\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nI am watching these days the Netflix crime series Young Wallander based on Henning Mankell’s fictional inspector Kurt Wallander. Now speaking, the superb novelist Henning Mankell is unfortunately dead and his beloved iconic hero Kurt Wallander reached the later stages of dementia long ago. Netflix revived him, diving in his youth and the start of his career as a recently graduated young detective.\n\nThe more I watch Kurt fighting with the bad guys and his own daemons as well, the more I wonder whether is better for your own good, the others’ good and the organization you work for to be wholeheartedly dedicated to your purpose and truly, deeply care for others or take a distance and do the job following the manual. Kurt does care for others. He fights for others. When they’re hurt, he gets hurt, and when they die, he mourns their death, getting devastated. Their pain is his pain. He takes shortcuts and often goes off the protocol for saving others. This attitude gets him in trouble. When he succeeds, they give him the credit with reservations and when he fails, they grant him the debit at lightspeed. But if someone debits him with failure faster and first every time is no one but himself. He’s drowning his failures and successes in alcohol and later in life, he suffers from diabetes before he forgets everything, drowning in the cruel abyss of dementia.\n\nI cannot resist wondering then. Who’s better for his own good and the good of others eventually? The cop who has a great sense of purpose but he acts intuitively, putting himself and others at risk sometimes or the one who sticks with the process, follows rules and with a clear head makes decisions based on logic? The surgeon who loves his patients and he gets ruined when they don’t make it, failing to function the following days or the one who takes a distance and does the job without ever losing her cool? The seller who builds personal bonds with his customers and he’s always there for them despite his family priorities or the one who simply does the fundamental things right, juggles successfully between customer needs and employer’s interests and knows how to keep the right work-life balance without bringing home the work problems, without letting any business issue hijack his goodnight sleep that will? The athlete who lives for the team and does anything to support the team win the trophy, putting her health at risk or the one who draws a red line, making not unnecessary sacrifices, running may be “slower” but for a longer time?\n\nWhen I write on my blog, raising such dilemmas, I often have in mind to provide an answer. Not the right answer. Only my answer. Not this time though. This time I am afraid I ain’t got one. I got no answers. Only food for thought.\n\n“Reposted in memory of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n#mlkday”\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. never died – (MLK Day – Reposting)\n\nby George Pastidis\n\n51 years ago, on Thursday, April 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was standing out at the balcony of his hotel room in Memphis when a bullet entered through his right cheek. King dropped unconscious and an hour later, according to the autopsy report, he passed away.\n\nLooking up the word “martyr” in Cambridge dictionary, I found the following two definitions:\n\n“a person who suffers very much or is killed because of their religious or political beliefs, and is often admired because of it or someone who tries to get sympathy from others when he or she has a problem or too much work”. If we take the perspective of the positive association of the word martyr which is used to describe a heroic figure who despite the personal cost, does what is best for others, I strongly believe that King was a martyr.\n\nMany people remember King from his historical “I have a dream” speech which every time I watch – and trust me I have watched tens of times – it gives me the chills. King did a lot more than sharing his dream. In less than ten years, he delivered 2,500 speeches, he travelled millions of miles and he was arrested about 30 times. The life threats for himself and his family was part of his every day routine. They say that the autopsy report showed that although he was 39 years old only, his heart was in a condition of a 60 years old man because of the stress that he had experienced. But none of this activity would make any real sense if it has not led to results; if it was not associated with glorious achievements both personal and for his movement. King had an instrumental role in organizing the famous Washington march in 1963 where he delivered his notorious speech inspiring hundreds of thousands of people. He was the first African – American to be named “Man of the Year” in 1963 and the youngest at the time recipient of Nobel Peace prize in 1964. But above all, King’s non-violent efforts led to 1965 Voting Rights Act and he became after his assassination, the symbolic leader everywhere that injustice is met.\n\nKing gave to the noble cause, first his time and peace of mind, then his health and finally his life. King consciously walked his way to martyrdom. King died for his dream. He died so others can see the dream he had to come true. He died to live in the hearts of people. King never really died. Martyrs don’t die. Martyrs live forever. So is King.\n\nThe Last Acceptable Bias in the Workplace?\n\nGeorge Pastidis joins Matt Cooley and Upside/Downside a podcast for Finance Business Partners to talk about age bias in the workplace and strategies for thriving later in your career.\n\nListen to the 12 min podcast: The Last Acceptable Bias in the Workplace? (buzzsprout.com)\n\nJob interviews: wrong turns both sides often take\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nIt’s been a long time since I had my first job interview as a candidate in 1992. I was still serving my military and I had sent out tens of applications not keeping track of them really. I was called to a job interview and I had no clue what it was about. The lady running the job interview asked me which one from the two roles they were seeking I was interested in and I said: “both”. No wonder why the interview lasted about ten minutes only. Ever since, I have been many times in both sides of the table and I am often surprised with the way either job interviewers or job candidates handle things. I always observe with curiosity and often disappointment the behaviors both sides demonstrate.\n\nI will start with the job candidates who when they answer questions, good or bad, tend to instead of giving a concrete answer, preferably backed up with a solid example, they go on and on down to unnecessary details and getting off the subject. And the more the job interviewers low react (something particularly inevitable when their attention lowers) the more the candidates over-react getting tedious, tiring and boring.\n\nAnother key task job candidates often fail is to balance between being agreeable or pathetic and arrogant or pushy. Both extremes are a no go. They need and they must juggle between the two extremes, coming across as assertive and confident people who do not lack empathy. They have to show that they are doers who can simply do the job but at the same time they are collaborative people that their teammates would smoothly work with.\n\nThe job candidates must prepare adequately and show this. They have to prepare to pitch themselves in a rational and emotionally compelling way, they must prepare to handle tough questions (even the silly ones) and they should prepare to ask insightful questions. Instead of waiting for the job interviewers to ask them in the very end of the interview whether they have any questions, they should proactively plug in their questions here and there throughout the interview making the whole call as a two way dialog of two equal grown-ups who partner for the common benefit. And they need to listen, really listen to the answers they get for asking good clarifying questions next. This way they show that they are good listeners and they don’t stay on the surface of things, asking questions for the sake of questions.\n\nLet’s move to the other side of the table now, the one of the job interviewers. I have no words to express how much I dislike some of their cliché and often silly questions. Questions like “what’s your biggest weakness?”. This question is so common and unfortunately totally ineffective, leading the candidate to giving an answer definitely not sincere. They will have to embellish things, coming up with weaknesses which often are strengths such as “I am a perfectionist” or “I stress too much for getting things impeccable” or “I am a workaholic”. Silly questions cannot but trigger silly answers. What if the job interviewers had asked them to give an example of a recent missed business opportunity or fail, the reasons behind that and the actions they took for not letting this happen again? Much better, I think.\n\nAnother wrong turn interviewers take is when they ask the candidates to go over their resume. How come? Don’t they have it right in front of them? Why don’t they ask them instead to pitch their resume in a couple of minutes explaining how the experience and skills they have acquired over the past years make them the right suit for this job role, seeking out to see if they can put together a concise and meaningful message instead of rambling for hours.\n\nThey often ask people how much money they currently make or what their expectations are, a question which is and perceived as a curveball. The candidates fear that if they aim too high, they might get eliminated and if they aim too low, they’ll leave money on the table. But why would someone want to make such an awful start with someone whom plan to collaborate with? Doesn’t their company have salary ranges to prevent having wage gaps and unsatisfied employees?\n\nI will close this with a funny story a very experienced HR executive and friend George Tzilivakis shared with me some years back. In the 90’s one common question (and silly) was: “if you were an animal, what animal you would want to be?”. The poor candidates were usually using lions and eagles to answer this question, trying to show power, leadership etc. George had a different answer though. He said: “a goat”! The job interviewer looked at him rather surprised and George explained that goats are sweet, quite animals that provide us with milk that’s so much needed. Kudos to George!\n\nMikis Theodorakis: a great leader passed away\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nMikis Theodorakis, the music composer and political activist passed away. The man behind the soundtracks of “Zorba” and “Serpico”, the man who turned the poems of the Nobel Prize winners poets Giorgos Seferis and Odysseas Elytis into songs, the man awarded the Lenin Peace Prize, the man who resisted and fought hard during the World War II occupancy of Greece and was repeatedly tortured, the man who fought for his beliefs and did time on exile during the civil war of Greece, passed away.\n\nA great man passed away. A huge leader passed away. I will never forget the Athens concert tribute to Mikis in June 2017 with a choir of 1,000 youth from all over Greece. It was towards the end of it when he was assisted to come on stage on a wheelchair in order to direct the awesome song of his “Arnisis”. He got so emotional. We all got emotional. The crowd was cheering thrilled with the eyes watering. I teared. The song got over but Mikis could not hold his tears any longer and he forgot to give the finish sign to his orchestra. And they never stopped playing. They continued till their leader, this great man, this great Greek told them to, raising his hands; those beautiful, big and strong hands that kept all of us high up and safe for 96 years. It is really worth watching the following video which is a small evidence of Miki’s huge personality and the love and affection that we all had and we’ll always have for him. A small evidence of a great leader (653) Η συγκίνηση του Μίκη Θεοδωράκη στο Καλλιμάρμαρο 19/6/2017 – YouTube . A minute later, he tried to stand on his feet and tell us that he loves us. He couldn’t. He whispered that in the ear of his aide so he can get the message to us. We didn’t whisper. We shouted: We love you, Mikis.\n\nYou’ll live forever.\n\n12 hours with no mobile phone\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nIt was October 1994 that I got my first mobile phone, the Ericsson 197. I didn’t get it actually. I was given that one when I entered the telecoms to work for a mobile network operator. Did I get excited any? Not really to be honest. The moment I would walk in back to my apartment after work, I would switch off my phone to pick it up the next morning going to work. I started using it a little more when I went to a business trip a month later. But still, when I would hear my phone ringing in the evening, I would hide myself to answer speaking very low for not being noticed. I wasn’t feeling that comfortable. But so many things changed since back then.\n\nWe saw the mobile handsets first getting smaller and smaller and becoming a lifestyle choice. Later they started getting bigger and bigger making the world smaller instead, bringing people and places closer with calling, texting, emailing, and social media, not to mention all those apps for damn everything, from booking your sun-umbrella on the beach to dating and checking out your oxygen levels. Literally amazing stuff.\n\nLast evening, I had dinner out with a good friend. He was driving and he dropped me off at home after midnight. When I got in my living room, I put my hand in my front left pocket where I always have my phone in. Wallet in the right (as my grandad taught me to do) and phone in the left. The phone wasn’t there. 12 hours of panic followed:\n\nI thought that two things could have happened. I either forgot it at the restaurant or in my friend’s car. I would have immediately call him but I didn’t know his phone number by heart. That’s something our mobiles made us stop doing. We memorize PINs instead.\n\nI went to bed. I was too tired to think clearly and do anything. I felt totally helpless. I was already lying in bed when I had my epiphany. I thought I remembered the phone number of my friend. Thank God, I got up to write it down because I wasn’t any sure that it would be the same case in the morning.\n\nA couple of hours later, I woke up. A thought had crossed my mind: What if my phone had dropped the moment I was walking out of my friend’s car? No way I could sleep. It was 3am when I went out to walk back to the exact place my friend dropped me off. Nothing was there.\n\nI went back home making hard efforts to sleep. I got up at 6am and I wanted to give my friend a ring but I waited till it goes 7.30 am. Bingo, I had the number right and my phone was in his car. We arranged to meet at a convenient point to both of us (not that simple because my friend was 40km away), right after some dental work I had to do. It took us some time to arrange the exact point of meeting because I wouldn’t have my phone in case I would do something wrong.\n\nMeantime, I started working. I had some business calls to take. Felt like putting some music on while showering, but my Spotify app was with the phone. Wanted to check out what time it is a couple of times but my clock was with my phone.\n\nIt was 10.30am when I got in my car to go to my dentist. I had gone there only once with the help of my Google maps. But my Google maps app was with my phone. I made a small mistake that cost me 10 minutes but I managed to get there. My dentist kept me longer than what I had budgeted. I would stand my friend up for about 15 minutes and I did not have my phone to text him. I had to take the doctor’s phone to call him up.\n\nWhen we finally met, I grabbed my phone with joy. My baby was with me. My front left pocket was again full. My hand’s extension was in place. I texted my wife to tell her that I had my phone back. She said: I am surprised you slept at night. I answered: Hell, I didn’t!!\n\nWe need more guys like Giannis\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nLast evening, I set my alarm clock quite a few hours earlier than usual for a good reason. Giannis and his Milwaukee Bucks played and won the NBA finals. I am so damn happy. But I do not celebrate the win of a Greek athlete as I would usually do. I feel like partying neither because the Bucks are the NBA champions nor because Giannis was awarded the NBA finals MVP, scoring 50 points. I am bursting with pride for Gianni’s amazing journey. I am bursting with pride for his unparalleled personality.\n\nI have a hard time to find enough and big enough words to describe the capabilities and virtues of this great young man. Few words that quickly cross my mind in no particular order are: humbleness, hope, courage, dream, diligence, strength, hard work, patience, energy, resilience, commitment, respect, trust, curiosity, family, learning agility, growth mindset, values, principles, humor, dedication, development, discretion, sincerity, friendship, loyalty, care, team spirit, kindness, love. And all these words boil down to leadership. Giannis is a leadership role model for us, our children, everyone.\n\nGiannis who did not have the energy to play competitively in his teens because he was not eating properly…\n\nGiannis who couldn’t play basketball together with his older brother Thanasis because they had to share shoes…\n\nGiannis who often had to play hide and seek with cops in Athens while he was selling different items…\n\nGiannis who did not have a citizenship till his 18 years….\n\nGiannis who together with his family got evicted from home few times….\n\n…is today a role model. Giannis and his journey which already made a fascinating book by Jose Manuel Puertas and soon will be a Disney movie is a story to tell. It’s a story to tell our children for teaching them not athleticism really but to never stop dreaming and working hard for making their dreams happen; teaching them as Giannis says to make their dreams happen, living in the moment instead of bragging for the past or making arrogant statements for the future; teaching them to never lose focus; teaching them first ethos.\n\nGiannis, moments after making his dream come true, after achieving his goal, he set the next one: He wants a repeat. He wants the Bucks to dominate!\n\nHell yeah, we need more guys like Giannis.\n\nShould training in the post-Covid era switch back to its face-to-face modality?\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nIt was about a year and a half ago that the learning and development community was caught off guard by Covid. First, business travels were banned and then any kind of indoor or even outdoor gathering was totally out of place. We literally stopped going to our office. Traditional face to face training had to change and be replaced by a mix of synchronous and asynchronous learning solutions. Everyone, learning professionals and learners had to adapt in the new reality, changing the way we train and the way we learn.\n\nBut sooner or later, we’ll get through with Covid and an interesting debate will pop up. Shall we go back to where we were when it comes to the training delivery or we better stick with our virtual trainings, paying some respect to the efforts we made for mastering this new training modality? After all the OPEX line of our organizations was helped some by the reduction of travel expenses. A rather difficult question that the learning professionals shouldn’t answer having in mind their personal habits. We should neither answer this taking in consideration only what our learners like better. The latter one, the learners’ preferences is definitely a criteria but not the only one.\n\nThe Kirkpatrick evaluation model sets a great exercise with useful questions that if we have answered for the two modalities, we can easily compare and make safer decisions:\n\nDo they like?\n\nDo they learn?\n\nDo their behaviors change?\n\nDo they perform better?\n\nAnother factor that should be taken into account is the socializing and peer learning one. The Corporate Executive Board (CEB) Digital Learning Survey clearly shows that both Baby Boomers and Millennials like learning from peers. People need to and must learn together. They want to learn with and from each other and they do this formally and informally; during the classroom training, the community interaction and the coffee-breaks and the learning professionals have to facilitate and enhance this no matter what modality they choose.\n\nFinally, because “no money – no honey”, because in nowadays EBITDA is King, the training budget has to be treated with the utmost respect and the cost of training and its Return on Investment (ROI) or at least Return on Expectations (ROE) cannot be but another key criteria.\n\nIn conclusion, we can neither be rigid nor we can decide on this key matter based on what we or our learners prefer or are used to be doing. That would be extremely simplistic and dangerous. We should evaluate things carefully, mix and match the different modalities depending on the subject, target, audience, and budget, and set the conditions that will enable people to really interact and learn together and perform better, face to face or/and virtually.\n\nHome working during Covid: it’s his birthday\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nIt’s been such a challenging year. We got caught off guard. First, we got shocked, then we pushed back. We were disrupted and we became disruptors to make it through. We had our losses and our wins. We had our learning takeaways and we have many challenges ahead.\n\nWhen it comes to working at home, there is one thing that I find particularly interesting. I remember myself before Covid, feeling safe and capable to perform only at the office. Perhaps I would take a very early or a very late simple call with a colleague at home. But that’s it. If my work would involve something a little more complex or maybe some exposure to a greater audience, for example a presentation or a webinar that I had to drive, I would go with my comfort zone and that would be the office and only the office. There I had all my stuff and a network that I trusted more although I had fiber at home.\n\nA year later, things have changed. I have everything I need here at home. But the key thing is that working at home became a habit. And habit is comfort zone. And comfort zone is safety. This is where I feel safe now and if you ask me to go back to the office, I know it sounds funny but I honestly will again find rather challenging. It will throw me off big time.\n\nA year back, we fought back, we disrupted, we innovated, we evolved the hard way and we reinvented ourselves. We made this home working a habit. The big challenge ahead is to enable us to juggle easily among different workplaces. The habit should be to leave habits behind and never stop adapting, flexing, feeling safe and perform to the max no matter where we work at.\n\n“Reposted in memory of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n#mlkday”\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. never died – (MLK Day – Reposting)\n\nby George Pastidis\n\n51 years ago, on Thursday, April 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was standing out at the balcony of his hotel room in Memphis when a bullet entered through his right cheek. King dropped unconscious and an hour later, according to the autopsy report, he passed away.\n\nLooking up the word “martyr” in Cambridge dictionary, I found the following two definitions:\n\n“a person who suffers very much or is killed because of their religious or political beliefs, and is often admired because of it or someone who tries to get sympathy from others when he or she has a problem or too much work”. If we take the perspective of the positive association of the word martyr which is used to describe a heroic figure who despite the personal cost, does what is best for others, I strongly believe that King was a martyr.\n\nMany people remember King from his historical “I have a dream” speech which every time I watch – and trust me I have watched tens of times – it gives me the chills. King did a lot more than sharing his dream. In less than ten years, he delivered 2,500 speeches, he travelled millions of miles and he was arrested about 30 times. The life threats for himself and his family was part of his every day routine. They say that the autopsy report showed that although he was 39 years old only, his heart was in a condition of a 60 years old man because of the stress that he had experienced. But none of this activity would make any real sense if it has not led to results; if it was not associated with glorious achievements both personal and for his movement. King had an instrumental role in organizing the famous Washington march in 1963 where he delivered his notorious speech inspiring hundreds of thousands of people. He was the first African – American to be named “Man of the Year” in 1963 and the youngest at the time recipient of Nobel Peace prize in 1964. But above all, King’s non-violent efforts led to 1965 Voting Rights Act and he became after his assassination, the symbolic leader everywhere that injustice is met.\n\nKing gave to the noble cause, first his time and peace of mind, then his health and finally his life. King consciously walked his way to martyrdom. King died for his dream. He died so others can see the dream he had to come true. He died to live in the hearts of people. King never really died. Martyrs don’t die. Martyrs live forever. So is King.\n\nDo not humiliate America again\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nThat should be the new slogan replacing the lying line “make America great again” which Donald Trump loved selling and millions of people kept buying for years, making last evening a great country getting embarrassed worldwide and democracy being hurt big time.\n\nAmerica deserves so much better. America is the country which nurtured and made the dreams come true of millions of people swarming in from all over the world. Only today, it’s the home of 40 million immigrants. America is the country that was close to elect a second-generation immigrant in 1988 when Michael Dukakis gained the vote of 46% of people. America is the country which elected a black President for two consecutive terms. America is the country which had 48% of its people voting a woman in the Presidential elections of 2016. America is the country that its music such as rock, soul, jazz and rap, has become the music that we all listen to across the world. America is the country that its film industry has managed to find the right balance between making art and have a commercial success, conquering the cinemas and TV sets globally.\n\nOf course, America is also the country of Second Amendment which protects the right to keep and bear arms. It’s the country that institutional racism is an undoubted fact. It’s the country that many of its citizens have a difficulty to understand that they need to contribute in the welfare of the weak. But still I believe that in my balance sheet, America is a great country that deserves a lot better. America after all is the country that provided education and a home to me for four years changing my life and this I will never forget and I will always be grateful for.\n\nAmerica gave us a lesson yesterday. Witnessing this powerful country with a piece of art constitution, having its democracy threatened, we all realize that democracy shouldn’t be taken for granted. Democracy should be guarded by Democrats and Republicans, by everyone. Democracy is too precious to leave Trumpers (and we have people sharing this DNA everywhere in the world) play with.\n\nThus, we must identify the root-cause of this sad situation which is definitely not Trump. The root-cause is fanaticism and if we drill down further, the resentment and bitterness that lead to bigotry. If Trump wasn’t there for these people, they would find another politician to tie in with and if no such politician was available, they would turn to religion or sports. They would fight in the social media over the rivalry of Lebron and Giannis or Ronaldo and Messi, cursing each other hideously. We’re talking about people that life hasn’t treated well. They have bitterness, resentment and a lot of anger. Anger which must be replaced with love, something not easy at all. These bigots cannot be talked out of this using logic and persuasive skills. Bigotry takes time and efforts to change. You have to eliminate the reasons that these people have so much anger about. You need to help them see and understand that the huge demographic changes happening in the States currently are not a threat for them. You have to rethink and reset the education provided, give them opportunities to travel and interact with people who see as strangers today. Help them reflect and think of their own ancestors hundreds of years back who they had to leave Ireland chased for their religion beliefs or a tiny poor village in Sicily after WWII or Denmark in the 19th century that poverty was pushing them to immigration.\n\nAmerica and Europe are changing, becoming more and more multiracial, multicolor, multifaith and multigendered. We all must welcome and embrace these inevitable, drastic and massive changes, showing compassion. The noted author and film-maker Valarie Kaur says in her book See No Stranger: A Memoir and Manifesto of Revolutionary Love: “Is this the darkness of the tomb, or of the womb? I don’t know. All I know is that the only way we will endure is if each of us shows up to the labor…Revolutionary love is how we stay in the fire. I believe revolutionary love is the call of our times. “Revolutionary love” is the choice to enter into wonder and labor for others, for our opponents, and for ourselves in order to transform the world around us. It is not a formal code or prescription but an orientation to life that is personal and political and rooted in joy. Loving only ourselves is escapism; loving only our opponents is self-loathing; loving only others is ineffective. All three practices together make love revolutionary, and revolutionary love can only be practiced in community.”\n\nThe COVID-19 employers and employees new relationship\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nThe recent very interesting Gartner New Employment Deal article, talking about driving performance via flexibility, creating a shared sense of purpose and building deeper connections made me reflect on the subject. Made me start thinking whether this is something real new or it was always the case.\n\nChoice – Organizations today are either letting their employees to decide where to work from or they support the one-way decision made by the authorities to have them working from home or elsewhere. Organizations have to provide flexibility and empower their people giving them choice. The survey of Gartner revealed that when employees have the choice the high performers rise from 36% to 55%. The truth though is that this was always the case. Dr Kamal Birdi of Sheffield University studied productivity in 2008 across 308 companies and found that the improved performance of employees who were given the choice accounted for a 9% increase in value added per employee. The more people they are empowered, the more people are given the choice, the more organizations and management show trust and give flexibility to their people, the better employees always perform. The better they always performed. The difference today – and allow me to believe, tomorrow too – is that people must be given the choice and employers have to learn to deal with this situation wholehearted.\n\nPurpose – The Gartner survey found the 40% of highly engaged employees increases to 60% when people see that their organizations take a stance on a social issue. Because people need to have a purpose. It was the same message actually that Lewis Caroll in 1865 was trying to get across in his book Alice’s adventures in Wonderland with his Cheshire Cat hero. Alice was trying to find her way and Cheshire asked her where she wants to go. Alice answered: “anywhere” and Cheshire with its famous mischievous grin said to her: “then it doesn’t matter which way you go but prepare to walk long enough before you get somewhere”. People always needed to have a purpose and today that organizations have others working from home and a certain population occasionally working from the office or the factory because they cannot do otherwise, a common purpose will be a key driver for a common culture too.\n\nHolistic support – The Gartner survey showed that organizations that support their employees holistically, see their high performers increasing by 21%. By holistically is meant to care not only about their work performance but about their personal lives as well. Again, when did people wouldn’t appreciate a manager providing high performance coaching with such holistic perspective. Who wouldn’t perform better if treated with respect and dignity, with genuine care and affection. But what makes things different now is that having people working from home, this is now an imperative as work and personal life are matters which cannot be treated separately any longer.\n\nChoice, a sense of purpose and a holistic support of employees should always be in the center of employers’ attention. Now way more than ever. Employers and employees just started a new relationship that they have to make work.\n\nDo it like Nole and Stefanos\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nI love sports. I love playing and watching sports and I love reflecting on sports. Sports help you learn and sports help you tell good stories about lessons learned. One recent awesome source of great stories to tell was the Roland Garros semifinal between Novak Djokovic and Stefanos Tsitsipas. The diligent, intelligent, machine like Serb who together with the enthusiastic, stubborn, talented Greek, gave the world three great lessons.\n\nLesson 1: Work – Stefanos being down two sets to none and heading to a three-nil score, he was furious. But instead of getting mad at the referee or at his racquet, smashing it against the court, he got mad at himself. The camera gave us a brilliant shot of Stefanos yelling out loud three words (in Greek so few sport commentators could really understand and tell): work-work-work. Those words kicked-off the awakening of Stefanos. Stefanos actually shouted at himself that harder work, more work, smarter work is needed to take down Djoko.\n\nLesson 2: Stamina – He shouted three times “work” and some magic powder covered the court. Stefanos was back. He found the guts, the stamina, the courage to be brave and stand against his fears, to stand against the legendary Nole and this time shout at him that he won’t give up. He won two sets in a row against the number one.\n\nLesson 3: Experience – But there was one more lesson to be learned left. The experience of Nole had not kicked in yet. Nole never lost his cool. He stayed calm and he utilized his great experience the best way possible. He knew when to run and when not. He knew what are the points he needs to chase and when to invest himself and we all saw that when Stefanos was ran out of steam in the fifth set of the match, Nole fresher than ever nailed the match and his presence in the Roland Garros final.\n\nWork, Stamina and Experience. Thank you, Novak! Thank you, Stefanos!\n\nDealing with ageism in the workplace\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nFifteen years back, I saw one day a friend clean-shaven after having for a long time a 10-day beard. He explained to me that being in his mid-fifties, he needed to get rid off his beard that was turning grey for avoiding being perceived and treated as a tired veteran in his workplace. I believed that things had gotten better ever since. Not sure how much though.\n\nAnother friend who happens to be an experienced executive search executive called me the other day. Ageism in the workplace was one of the many things we chatted about. He shared with me that a major multinational company gave him a brief recently about someone they’re looking to recruit who should be in his early forties max. The sad and oxymoron thing is that we’re talking about a company which heavily campaigns about diversity and inclusion. I guess age is not included. Of course, ageism is not related to recruiting only. You can get discriminated when they bypass you for a promotion despite of the skills set you have proved to have or when they don’t approve your participation in some expensive training event because they don’t see it as an investment that will have the necessary payoffs because you will retire or get redundant soon.\n\nAn AARP workplace 2018 survey says that 2 out of 3 workers 45+ have seen or experienced ageism on the job and among the 61% of respondents who reported age bias, 91% said they believe that such discrimination is common. Patricia Barnes in her interesting Forbes article goes over the research of Professor David Neumark, saying: “Applicants applied on-line for jobs and completed a battery of about 100 questions, leading to numerical scores. The application did not require a disclosure of age. Applicants were selected for job interview based upon their scores. Neumark found that older applicants were selected for job interviews ‘at equal or higher rates to younger applicants’ when their age was unknown. However, he notes, the age of older applicants became apparent as soon as they arrived at the job interview and they were subject to visual observation. At that point, he said, age discrimination kicked in. The job offer rate after the in-person interview was about 46% lower for older applicants than it was for younger applicants, even though many older workers had superior qualifications and assessments”.\n\nNew laws may be needed for fighting ageism in the workplace and I believe they will soon come. But the million-dollar question is: how can someone, me, you deal with this now. I strongly believe that the answer can be nothing but learning, growth and development. Be curious and learning agile, stay current and up-to-date on trends of your market and industry. Learn every day something new. Mentor others and do not hesitate a moment to seek out reverse mentorship and get paired with a younger colleague, learning from and with him. Leave behind your fixed mindset and demonstrate a growth mindset and ask your line manager to support your growth journey. Use your social media to share your network of friends, customers, peers and partners that your grow every day; you learn and get better every day, you’re truly open-minded. Then trust me, few only will dare to discriminate you and if some of them do, some others will challenge them. You might even get the chance to let your beard grow back.\n\nPower Skills για το ψηφιακό παρόν και μέλλον της εργασίας\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nΆρθρο μου με θέμα POWER SKILLS ΓΙΑ ΤΟ ΨΗΦΙΑΚΟ ΠΑΡΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΜΕΛΛΟΝ ΤΗΣ ΕΡΓΑΣΙΑΣ περιλαμβάνεται σήμερα 11 Ιουλίου στην ετήσια έκδοση LEADING EMPLOYERS in GREECE που κυκλοφορεί σε Αθήνα και Θεσσαλονίκη με την εφημερίδα ΝΕΑ.\n\nMy article POWER SKILLS FOR THE DIGITAL PRESENT AND FUTURE OF WORK is included today 11 July in the yearly edition LEADING EMPLOYERS in GREECE with the newspaper NEA in Athens and Thessaloniki.

Είναι δύσκολο να προβλέψεις τις απαραίτητες δεξιότητες για το μέλλον αλλά η σημαντικότερη ίσως είναι αυτή του learning agility» Kelly Palmer, The Expertise Economy\n\nΌλες οι ομιλίες είχαν κοινό παρονομαστή και μήνυμα: η ανάπτυξη των δεξιοτήτων που σήμερα ονομάζουμε power skills όπως ενσυναίσθηση, δημιουργικότητα, ηγεσία, συνεργασία, προσαρμοστικότητα, θα είναι το κλειδί της επιτυχίας για τους σημερινούς οργανισμούς που επιθυμούν να είναι μαζί μας και στο μέλλον. Αν θέλουμε να συνεργαστούμε αρμονικά με τις «μηχανές», θα πρέπει κάθε μέρα να γινόμαστε καλύτεροι. Θα έχουμε θέση και χώρο στο ψηφιακό μέλλον της εργασίας αν συνεχίσουμε να δημιουργούμε αξία και θα συνεχίσουμε να δημιουργούμε αξία αν αναπτύξουμε δεξιότητες στις οποίες οι «μηχανές» σήμερα δυσκολεύονται κι αυτές δεν είναι άλλες από τα power skills.\n\nΑυτά όμως ήταν ομιλίες και συζητήσεις που έγιναν πριν 8 μήνες. Μετά ήρθε ο COVID κι άλλαξε τις ζωές όλων μας. Έφερε πολύ γρηγορότερα πράγματα που ήταν αναμενόμενα αλλά όχι τόσο σύντομα και ήρθαν για να μείνουν. Ένα από αυτά ήταν η εργασία από το σπίτι που οι περισσότεροι από εμάς ζήσαμε με τον εγκλεισμό. Μέσα σε λιγότερες από 24 ώρες, μεταφέραμε το γραφείο μας στο σπίτι, αρχίσαμε να συναντούμε τους πελάτες μας στο Zoom, χρειάστηκε να ανακοινώσουμε δύσκολα νέα στους συνεργάτες μας και τότε καταλάβαμε πόσο σημαντικό είναι να έχουμε την κάμερα ανοιχτή και να τους κοιτάμε στα μάτια όταν τους τα λέμε. Ακόμη, συμμετείχαμε σε σύνθετες διαπραγματεύσεις με πολλά εμπλεκόμενα μέρη για τις οποίες άλλοτε θα είχαμε κάνει τουλάχιστον τρία ή τέσσερα ταξίδια και τα καταφέραμε, μάθαμε να παρουσιάζουμε εξ αποστάσεως, καταλάβαμε πόσο σημαντικό είναι να ξέρεις να θέτεις προτεραιότητες.\n\nΟυσιαστικά ανασύραμε από το ΄hard drive΄, δουλέψαμε κι αναπτύξαμε power skills όπως η δημιουργικότητα, η καινοτομία, η προσαρμοστικότητα στις αλλαγές, η συνεργασία ακόμη και σε συνθήκες δύσκολες και πρωτόγνωρες, η ενσυναίσθηση, η επίλυση προβλημάτων και η ηγεσία. Ο COVID αργά ή γρήγορα θα πάψει να μας απασχολεί. Όχι όμως και το ψηφιακό μέλλον που ο COVID έκανε πιο γρήγορα παρόν. Και την εργαλειοθήκη των power skills μας, δε θα πρέπει ποτέ να ξανακλείσουμε σε μια αποθήκη.\n\nΚι αν πρέπει να ξεχωρίσουμε τη μία πιο σημαντική δεξιότητα, αυτή δεν μπορεί να είναι άλλη από το learning agility. Την περιέργεια κι αυτοπαρακίνηση που πρέπει να διαθέτουμε ώστε συνέχεια να μαθαίνουμε, συνέχεια να αναπτύσσουμε νέες δεξιότητες. Ο μέσος όρος ζωής των δεξιοτήτων σήμερα είναι μόλις δύο χρόνια. Δεν μπορούμε να πάψουμε στιγμή να μαθαίνουμε.\n\nΠώς όμως μπορούν οι επιχειρήσεις να ενισχύσουν το learning agility;\n\nΠρέπει να πάρουν την εκπαίδευση στα χέρια τους – κάποτε οι επιχειρήσεις είχαν την πολυτέλεια να μπορούν να καταναλώνουν εκπαίδευση που παρήγαγαν άλλοι. Όχι όμως πια. Σήμερα τα πανεπιστήμια δυσκολεύονται να ακολουθήσουν τις ταχύτητες μέσα στις οποίες καλούνται οι επιχειρήσεις να κινηθούν. Θα περιμέναμε από μια εταιρεία τεχνολογίας, για παράδειγμα, να παράξει μάθηση για Internet of Things (IoT) και Artificial Intelligence (AI), μάθηση που θα ανοίξει σε όλο τον κόσμο χωρίς να την περιορίζει στο δικό της προσωπικό.\n\nΠρέπει να προσλαμβάνουν δεξιότητες κι όχι ονόματα – το όνομα ενός καλού σχολείου ή μιας μεγάλης πολυεθνικής στο βιογραφικό ήταν προηγουμένως αρκετά. Σήμερα οι επιχειρήσεις καλούνται να δίνουν μεγαλύτερη σημασία στις υφιστάμενες δεξιότητες των υποψηφίων και στην έμπρακτη διάθεσή τους να μαθαίνουν συνεχώς. Το learning agility θα πρέπει να είναι ένας πολύ σημαντικός δείκτης.\n\nΠρέπει να διατηρούν ψηλά το learning agility – Σύμφωνα με την Whitney Johnson ο κάθε εργαζόμενος έχει το δικό του κύκλο μάθησης που έχει τρία στάδια: inexperience – engagement – mastery, κι όταν κανείς φτάνει στο τελευταίο είναι φυσικό το ενδιαφέρον του για μάθηση να ατονεί. Είναι εκείνο το σημείο που η επιχείρηση οφείλει να βρίσκει τρόπους να ωθεί τον εργαζόμενο σε ένα νέο κύκλο μάθησης ώστε να συνεχίσει να επιδεικνύει την απαραίτητη περιέργεια, να συνεχίσει να εξερευνεί, να συνεχίσει να είναι learning agile.\n\nΓιατί μόνον όταν συνεχίσουμε να μαθαίνουμε, συνεχίσουμε να αλλάζουμε, συνεχίσουμε να αναπτυσσόμαστε, οι «μηχανές» θα είναι μηχανές μας και η τεχνολογία φίλη μας που μαζί θα πορευθούμε αρμονικά στο ψηφιακό παρόν και μέλλον.\n\nThe workplace of the future exercise\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nWe read and hear every day that most of the big major corporations, making good use of the valuable learnings over the last months, they are kicking-off ambitious and needed initiatives looking at the workplace of the future. Looking at recreating a workplace that will meet better the needs of people and organizations. A human centric workplace that will help people enhance their performance while it’s adapted in the current and future needs and conditions. The right workplace of the new digital era.\n\nYesterday, I listened on a podcast, Borje Ekholm, President and CEO Ericsson, saying: “About 85,000 today working from home, running Networks, R&D, support functions. So overall, we are migrating every function of the company to home. Of course, there are some that cannot work from home like field engineers for example. But otherwise we migrated and it’s really thanks to a very strong IT infrastructure we have. We invested in that already before and now we can leverage that. So, we migrated almost from the old normal to the new normal overnight in the beginning of March. So, 85,000 working remotely just overnight, it’s an unbelievable achievement. I would say the crew we have working on our IT support have done a fabulous job of keeping the company running”.\n\nAnother interesting read I had lately, it was a sports article which explained that people tend to select sports often depending on their locus of control. People with internal locus of control, they believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities and they are keen on choosing sports that they can do on their own such as running and biking. They persevere, they are self-disciplined and they don’t need others to get motivated from. On the contrary, the ones with external locus of control who believe that their performance depends on external attributes, they have less faith in themselves, they give up easy and being self-aware of this, they tend to choose activities where external motivation is included. We see them choosing team sports and activities with many people involved in, with scheduled practice sessions, competition, awards etc, things that help then stay committed, disciplined and motivated.\n\nMight look like I mix up heterogeneous things, jumping from one topic to another. I do this for a reason. I make this sports analogy, trying to read and explain why working from home can work for some people and cannot work for some others. I know people that working at the office before the lockdown, they would put about 9-10 hours a day out of which at least 45 minutes would be spent on a lunch break. Now, working from home, they work 11-12 hours a day and they break for a 15 min quick lunch. I am one of them. But I am also among the ones who choose solitary sports. I love running and biking at my preferred pace, giving myself time to reflect. I never enrolled for a group lesson at the gyms I was a member of. And when I had to take tennis, squash or boxing lessons in the past, I made sure I do this with personal trainers. I assume, I have an internal locus of control. I also have friends who have told me: “I need to get back to the office”. “I have a hard time to discipline now”. “I need to socially interact with my colleagues”. “I miss our chats over coffee”. I am not sure that these guys would do sports only in organized groups, but I have the hunch that this behavior depends big time on the external locus of control they have.\n\nI think that in this so much needed “design the future workplace” exercise, companies should have in mind that one size definitely does not and cannot fit all. They have to take in serious consideration not only the type of work their people do but their personalities and personal preferences and of course other external barriers they may have such as little kids at home. Not an easy exercise but an exercise badly needed for building a human centric workplace which can get the best out of everyone and can have the business running better than before in the digital present and future.\n\n5 things I learned after a month of lockdown\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nExactly one month of lockdown has passed. One full month working from home remotely. And although I was occasionally working from home before, although my global role in sales enablement is such that even when I was sitting in the office, I was actually working remotely, it feels quite different now and I got to discover, learn or confirm few things.\n\n1 I work more and better from home – I waste no time looking for quite rooms to take my calls and I have no distractions working in open space. Travel time is zero and I can easily accommodate very early calls with my Asian colleagues or very late evening calls with the Americans. Someone can argue that the work-life balance is at stake this way. Valid point. Unless you find purpose on what you do at work. Then you have a hell of a balance.\n\n2 I love having sports in my life – Not that I didn’t know or value that before. But in these days, every evening I leave the apartment to go for a run, I honestly feel the endorphins blowing before I even hit the road. Yesterday, President Macron spoke to us and I had one big concern. I was afraid to hear him telling us that we cannot go out for a physical exercise anymore. Thank God, we keep running!\n\n3 I respect technology more and more – It enables some of us to keep working seamlessly from home and all of us to stay connected with the ones we love. This is just amazing. I often wonder how easier my life would have been when I was a freshman student in the States struggling away from my family and my buddies if I could smoothly communicate and exchange with them. If I didn’t have to write letters or wait for a friend who was serving his military in Greece at the time to give me a call from the army base without paying or me to give a collect call to my parents when I was getting way too homesick.\n\n4 I see how dangerous fake news are – So many crappy rumors and conspiracy theories are spread every day. Sometimes by people who love sharing their ignorance or lunatics that can do anything for some publicity. They even dare to recommend drugs cocktails against the coronavirus putting human lives in danger. And these silly rumors find fertile ground on fear or ignorance and they blossom and spread faster that the virus. Sad! We have to push back hard here and do our best to isolate these people.\n\n5 I appreciate the real important stuff – There are many things I could mind about. Not going to a restaurant for a nice French cuisine dinner, being sometimes a little bored, missing Athens and not knowing if I have my usual summer vacation at a beautiful Greek island. But I choose not to. I don’t give a damn about these little things. I am grateful that my loved ones and myself are healthy. I adore that I continue having my job and I continue being effective on it because this is another key thing for being mentally healthy.\n\nAs a colleague was telling me the other day, we cannot but continue pursuing and achieving our business and personal goals as usual in an unusual world.\n\nWorking from home in COVID-19 times\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nWe all are bombed with tons of brilliant tips for working better remotely in these COVID-19 times. Lots of them are real good stuff that I appreciate. Some others though are a bit funny addressing the wrong target group of people. It’s one thing to guide someone who plans to switch to teleworking in good and stable times and it’s another to share luxury tips with people who see their personal and work lives turned upside down overnight.\n\nOne cliché tip I have a hard time to get is: have a dedicated work-space! Have a dedicated work-space, really? When husband, wife and a couple of children work and attend school remotely in one apartment? Can this really be a useful tip? I doubt it.\n\nAnother good one is: do not change your work day routine! I wonder how my good friend George who has three children between one and seven years old feels about this great tip. George who waits for the kids to go to bed to manage work in peace and he doesn’t go to bed himself before 3am. And Maria another good friend of mine in Milan who has nothing or very little to do work wise unfortunately, she chose to focus on learning instead to feel like she’s doing something useful.\n\nI cannot resist in sharing a tip myself: do your wise cherry-picking when you read all these stuff that can make you feel awkward, incapable, miserable and get you depressed. You know better. Flex to adapt in the new reality, embrace the challenge you are facing and make things work for you and your family. Be creative, innovate and disrupt yourself in these times that your life is big time disrupted. Do not try to do the same things the same way. Do things differently and you may do things even better in the end of the day. You may do something that will prove to be a big investment for your life or work future.\n\nStay home. Stay safe. Stay healthy. Stay creative.\n\nWrite the script of this disaster movie\n\nby George Pastidis\n\nChallenging times. Tough, unprecedented, weird, sad times. I could go on and on thinking of the right words to describe better what we go through. But there are no such words. The whole thing is like those disaster or FBI movies that a cool agent is looking for the evil guys who are about to spread a horrible virus which could kill thousands or millions of innocent people. The bizarre thing with this movie is that we’re the actors and to a great extent, we write the script and we co-direct it.\n\nBecause it’ s us who choose if the movie will be about lone-wolves or team players. It’s us who choose if the movie will have stories about the community’s wellbeing or our own personal payoff. It’s us who choose if the movie will show an economy getting paralyzed or an ec"
