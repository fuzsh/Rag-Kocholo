FIFA OPENS WORLD CUP TO THE WORLD FIFA has enlarged the World Cup ï¬nals twice since 1978, to take account of the rising football nations of Africa and Asia. The rise in interest is reï¬ected in the massive number of sides entering the competition â 204 for the 2014 event. Brazilian JoÃ£o Havelange, FIFA president from 1974 to 1998, enlarged the organization both to take advantage of commercial opportunities and to give smaller nations a chance. The number of teams in the ï¬nals was ï¬rst increased from 16 to 24 for the 1982 ï¬nals in Spain, with an extra place given for Africa and Asia and a chance for a nation from Oceania to reach the ï¬nals.

Goalkeeper Walter Zenga was not beaten until Claudio Caniggia scored Argentinaâs equalizer in the semi-ï¬nal.

Uruguayâs 3â0 victory over South Africa in Pretoria on 16 June 2010 equalled the highest losing margin suï¬ered by a FIFA World Cup host, following Brazilâs 5â2 win over Sweden in the 1958 ï¬nal and Italyâs 4â1 trouncing of Mexico in their 1970 quarter-ï¬nal. TEAM RECORDS 15\n\nP:16\n\nFIFA GOALSCORING WORLD CUP HOST WITH THE MOST Brazil have scored more goals (nine) in the opening matches of the FIFA World Cup than any other nation, though their status as double hosts in 1950 and 2014 certainly helped. Between 1974 and 2002 the holders, rather than the hosts, also had the honour of kicking oï¬ proceedings. Brazil beat Mexico easily by 4-0 in the 1950 opener in the Maracana stadium, with goals from Jair, Baltazar and Ademir (two). They defeated Scotland 2-1 in the Opening Match of France 1998 (Cesar Sampaio and Tom Boyd, own goal) and then Croatia, 3-1, in 2014, thanks to a double (one a penalty) from Neymar and a third from Oscar. A Brazilian also netted the very ï¬rst goal of the 2014 ï¬nals, as le -back Marcelo gave Croatia the lead with an own goal.

FIVE-STAR CARBAJAL Antonio Carbajal, of Mexico, is one of only two men to have appeared at ï¬ve FIFA World Cup ï¬nals â the other was Germanyâs versatile Lothar Matthaus. Carbajal, who played in 1950, 1954, 1958, 1962 and 1966, conceded a record 25 goals in his 11 FIFA World Cup ï¬nals appearances â the same number let in by Saudi Arabiaâs Mohamed Al-Deayea across ten games in 1994, 1998 and 2002. Al-Deayea was a member of the Saudi squad for the 2006 tournament but did not play. ZERO TO HERO One of the unlikeliest stars of the 2014 FIFA World Cup ï¬nals was Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa. He had spent the previous three years in the European shadows at modest French Corsican club Ajaccio. He feared for his World Cup place when Ajaccio were relegated, but Mexico coach Miguel Herrera was unconcerned and Ochoa repaid him with a string of outstanding performances. Best of all was his brilliant deï¬ance of hosts Brazil in a goalless draw in the group phase. Ochoa, who ended the ï¬nals with 61 caps for Mexico, conceded just three times in four games as Mexico lost 2-1 to two late Netherlands goals in the round-of-16. 24 FIFA WORLD CUP\n\nP:25\n\n5<4),9Ã¤65,5<4),965,: 90./;>(@ -6990*(9+6 The Lev Yashin Award was introduced in 1994 for the man voted best goalkeeper of the FIFA World Cup â Spainâs Ricardo Zamora became the ï¬rst though a goalkeeper was selected subsequently for man to save a penalty in a FIFA World an all-star team at the end of every tournament dating Cup ï¬nals match, stopping Valdemar back to 1930.

His second stint as Brazil coach was less successful â they fell in the quarter-ï¬nals in 2006. Parreira also led Kuwait (1982), the United Arab Emirates (1990), Saudi Arabia (1998) and hosts South Africa (2010) at the ï¬nals. He had stepped down as South Africa coach in April 2008, for family reasons, but returned late the following year. Parreira was once sacked midway through a FIFA World Cup.

Association football knows no boundaries of race or politics or religion. The structure is simple, helping ensure the sportâs international success. At the head of the world football pyramid is FIFA, the world federation. Supporting FIFAâs work are the six regional geographical confederations representing Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, South America, plus the Caribbean, Central and North America. Backing up the regions in turn are the national associations of 209 countries â and thus FIFA can boast more member countries than even the United Nations or the Olympic movement. The countries are pivotal. They ï¬eld the national teams who have built sporting history through their many and varied achievements in world-focused competitions such as the FIFA World Cup. But they also oversee the growth of football in their nation â from professional leagues to the game at grass-roots level. Representative teams from England and Scotland played out the ï¬rst formal internationals in the late 19th century, thus laying the foundation for the four British home nationsâ unique independent status within a world football family otherwise comprised of nation states. The original British Home Championships was the ï¬rst competition for national teams but its demise, as a result of a congested ï¬xture list, has le the Copa America in South America as the oldest survivor â apart from the Olympic Games. The trend-setting example of the Olympic Games in the 1920s led directly to the creation of the FIFA World Cup and its launch in 1930. Already South America had its own national team championship and all the other ï¬ve FIFA regions followed in due course. The winners meet once every four years in the FIFA Confederations Cup which is the rehearsal event for the extravaganza, one year later, which is the FIFA World Cup itself â the ultimate celebration of the planetâs favourite sport. Jennifer Lopez, Pitbull and Claudia Leitte raise the excitement levels in Sao Paulo in a colourful Opening Ceremony for the 2014 FIFA World Cup ahead of Brazilâs 3-1 win over Croatia.\n\nP:30\n\nEUROPE As soon as modern association footballâs rules were written in England the gameâs growth was rapid â enthusiasm spreading swi ly across Europe, the cradle of the game. UEFA, the European football confederation, now boasts 55 member states, from tiny Andorra and Gibraltar to world giants, Spain, Germany, Italy, England, the Netherlands and France. The game is played and followed with a fervent passion across the continent, not only at club but also at national levels. Germanyâs 2014 FIFA World Cup glory made it a record three straight wins for Europe. German fans, in Brazil in 2014, celebrating their heroesâ fourth FIFA World Cup victory â making history as Europeâs ï¬rst winners in eight stagings of the ï¬nals in the Americas.\n\nP:32\n\nENGLAND England is where football began; the country where the game was ï¬rst developed, which saw the creation of the gameâs ï¬rst Football Association and the ï¬rst organized league, and which now plays host to the richest domestic league in the world. But England have not had it all their own way on the international scene. Far from it. One solitary FIFA World Cup win apart, as hosts in 1966, the Three Lions have found it hard to shake oï¬ the âunderachieversâ tag when it comes to major tournaments.

RUNAWAY SUCCESS IN THE BEGINNING England have hit double ï¬gures ï¬ve The day it all began â¦ 30 November 1872, when England played their ï¬rst oï¬cial times: beating Ireland 13-0 and 13-2 in international match, against Scotland, at Hamilton Crescent, Partick. The result was a 1882 and 1899, thrashing Austria 11-1 in 0-0 draw in front of a then massive crowd of 4,000, who each paid an admission fee of 1908, crushing Portugal 10-0 in Lisbon one shilling (5p). In fact, teams representing England and Scotland had played ï¬ve times in 1947 and then the United States 10-0 before, but most of the Scottish players had been based in England and the matches are in 1964 in New York. The ten goals considered unoï¬cial. Englandâs team for the ï¬rst oï¬cial game was selected by Charles were scored by Roger Hunt (four), Fred Alcock, the secretary of the Football Association. His one regret was that, because of Pickering (three), Terry Paine (two) and injury, he could not pick himself to play. In contrast, the ï¬rst rugby union international Bobby Charlton. between England and Scotland had been played in 1871, but Englandâs ï¬rst Test cricket match was not played until March 1877, against Australia in Melbourne. 32 EUROPE\n\nP:33\n\nFIRST DEFEAT Hungaryâs 6-3 win at Wembley in 1953 was the ï¬rst time England had lost at home to continental opposition.

Two years later, they staged a sensational, last-gasp recovery to overhaul Italy in the Euro 2000 ï¬nal. The French equalized in the ï¬ h minute of stoppage time, then went on to win 2-1 on a golden goal. France had previously won the UEFA European Championship in 1984, beating Spain KOPA â FRANCEâS 2-0 in the ï¬nal in Paris. They reached the FIRST SUPERSTAR 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2016 European Championship ï¬nals too, but lost out Raymond Kopa (born on 13 October 1931) to Italy and Portgual respectively. was Franceâs ï¬rst international superstar.

He later joined Real Madrid and became the ï¬rst French player to win a European Cup winnerâs medal. He was the playmaker of the France team that ï¬nished third in the 1958 FIFA World Cup ï¬nals. His performances for his country that year earned him the European Footballer of the Year award. PLATINIâS GLITTERING CAREER Michel Platini (born in Joeuf on 21 June 1955) has enjoyed a glittering career, rising from a youngster at Nancy to become one of Franceâs greatest-ever players, a hero in Italy, and now the president of UEFA. He was also joint organizing president (along with Fernand Sastre) of the 1998 FIFA World Cup ï¬nals in France. Platini was the grandson of an Italian immigrant who ran a cafÃ© in Joeuf, Lorraine. He began with the local club, Nancy, before starring for Saint-Etienne, Juventus and France. He was instrumental in Franceâs progress to the 1982 FIFA World Cup semi-ï¬nals and was the undisputed star of the UEFA European Championship two years later, when France won the tournament on home soil. BENZ MAKES AMENDS Karim Benzema was the ï¬rst French player to miss a penalty during a FIFA World Cup match â excluding shoot-outs. His eï¬ort, saved by Diego Benaglio, came in a Group E match against Switzerland at the 2014 tournament â the tenth FIFA World Cup spot-kick awarded to France. He did atone for the failure by scoring Franceâs fourth in their 5-2 victory. Benzema had struck twice in Franceâs ï¬rst game, a 3-0 defeat of Honduras, and was denied a hat-trick a er his shot struck the far post and trickled over the goal-line, but it crossed the line only a er rebounding oï¬ goalkeeper Noel Valladares, so was ruled an own goal. This was the ï¬rst time in FIFA World Cup history that a goal was given thanks to goal-line technology, introduced for the 2014 ï¬nals. And Benzema was denied another goal in the Swiss game when Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers blew the ï¬nal whistle as he was in the act of smashing a long-range shot which ended up in the Swiss net. Benzemaâs three goals at the 2014 ï¬nals li ed him up to ninth place in Franceâs all-time scoring table, above Jean Vincent, who had died at the age of 82 the previous October. 36 EUROPE\n\nP:37\n\nTO BE FRANCK Franck Ribery is one of Franceâs most important and inï¬uential footballers of recent times. His displays oï¬ both wings helped them reach the 2006 FIFA World Cup ï¬nal as well as helping li Bayern Munich to success in the 2013 UEFA Champions League. He is the ï¬rst man to have been named Footballer of the Year in both France and Germany. Yet he was rejected as a teenager by French club Lille, with 1.7m-tall Ribery later claming they deemed him too short. Ribery was severely injured in a car crash as a two year old, leaving him with lifelong scars across the right side of his face. He ï¬nished third behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for FIFAâs annual Ballon dâOr award in December 2013, yet his luck turned the following summer when a back injury ruled him out of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

France ï¬nished bottom of the group a er a goalless draw with Uruguay and defeats to Mexico and hosts South Africa. The countryâs president Nicolas Sarkozy ordered an investigation into all that had gone wrong, while former French international defender Lilian Thuram called for captain Patrice Evra to be banned from playing for the team ever again. Despite serving a ï¬ve-match international ban for his role in the unrest, Evra returned to the fold in 2011 â albeit no longer as skipper â and was a starter for France at both the 2012 and 2016 UEFA European Championships and the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Yet again Abidal would return to action with Barcelona, taking the ï¬eld again towards the end of the 2012-13 season. DESCHAMPS THE LEADER Compatriot Eric Cantona contemptuously dismissed him as a mere âwater-carrierâ in central midï¬eld but Didier Deschamps provided his infamous critic with the perfect riposte in becoming the most successful captain in French football history. He li ed both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2000 UEFA European Championship trophies as skipper and wore the captainâs armband a record 55 times during his 103 internationals before retiring in July 2000. Deschamps succeeded Laurent Blanc as national coach a er the 2012 UEFA European Championship. Deschampsâ ten-match unbeaten run at FIFA World Cups, as a player and manager, came to an end in the 2014 quarter-ï¬nals as his side lost 1-0 to Germany. Until then he had enjoyed ï¬ve victories and one draw on the pitch, and three victories and one draw in the dug-out. 38 EUROPE\n\nP:39\n\nBITTERSWEET FOR TREZEGUET LILIAN IN THE PINK Striker David Trezeguet has bittersweet memories of Franceâs clashes with Defender Lilian Thuram made his 142nd and Italy in major ï¬nals. He scored the âgolden goalâ that beat the Italians in extra- ï¬nal appearance for France in their defeat by time in the Euro 2000 ï¬nal but, six years later, he was the man who missed as Italy at Euro 2008.

Lloris remained captain throughout qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and at the tournament itself, in which he kept three clean sheets and conceded three goals in ï¬ve games. THE FULL SET Five France stars have a full set of top international medals as FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Championship and UEFA Champions League winners. Didier Deschamps, Marcel Desailly, Christian Karembeu, Bixente Lizarazu and Zinedine Zidane all played for Franceâs winning teams in 1998 and 2000. Desailly won the European Cup with Marseille in 1993 and AC Milan the following year. Deschamps won with Marseille in 1993 and Juventus in 1996; Lizarazu did so with Bayern Munich in 2001, Karembeu with Real Madrid in 1998 and 2000, and Zidane with Real Madrid in 2002. While Karembeu ended the 1999â2000 season with UEFA Champions League and UEFA European Championship winnersâ medals, he was an unused substitute in both ï¬nals â making him the only player to have achieved that particular bittersweet double.

Neither tall nor graceful, he was quick, strong and had a predatorâs eye for the net. He also had the temperament to score decisive goals in big games, including the winner in the 1974 FIFA World Cup ï¬nal, the winner in the semi-ï¬nal against Poland and two goals in West Germanyâs 1972 UEFA European Championship ï¬nal victory over the USSR. He netted 68 goals in 62 appearances for West Germany and remains the leading scorer in the Bundesliga and all-time record scorer for his club, Bayern Munich. KING OTTO Andre Schurrle was the last man to score a hat-trick for Germany, in his countryâs 7-0 Euro 2016 qualifying victory over Gibraltar. Gerd Muller has more hat-tricks than any other German international â eight in all, four of which were four-goal hauls. But Otto Siï¬ing remains the only player to score ï¬ve in one match for Germany, during an 8-0 triumph over Denmark on 16 May 1937, in the Polish city of Wroclaw â then a German territory known as Breslau.
