        "text": "The pre-tournament favourites Germany take on massive outsiders Greece in the quarter-finals in Gdansk today – with the Germans looking to join Portugal in the final four, while the Greeks will be hoping for an upset.\n\nGreece provided arguably the biggest shock of Euro 2012 so far by jumping from the foot of Group A to second with a 1-0 win over Russia in their final group game. And their unexpected title triumph at Euro 2004 is another indication of how dangerous the Greeks can be. Greece coach Fernando Santos believes the example of eight years ago is giving his squad belief as they enter the knockout stages. “I would like to seize this opportunity to say what an inspiration for us the 2004 success is,” said Santos. “We showed great resolution and strength and we were written off before that tournament, but we still reached the final and won the cup. That should be a source of inspiration for us this time.”\n\nIt may need more than inspiration if they are to beat Joachim Low’s team. Germany are the only team at Euro 2012 to win all their matches so far – even also winning all 10 qualifying games. Although Low is not taking Greece for granted, he remains convinced his team will progress to the semi-finals. “Logically we are favourites, but we can deal with that,” he said. “But remember – knockout games have their own character so it will not be the case that the favourite automatically reaches the next round. We saw that in the group when Russia were the big favourites and we have all seen what happened. But if we show all of our inner strength and belief, then we are strong enough to beat the Greeks of course. I am convinced we will win.”\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\nGermany\n\nGermany welcome Jerome Boateng back after he missed the 2-1 win over Denmark due to suspension. Lars Bender should therefore return to the bench despite scoring the winner against the Danes. The rest of the team is expected to be the same, meaning the likes of Miroslav Klose, Mario Gotze and Toni Kroos must continue to wait for a start.\n\nGreece\n\nFernando Santos must do without skipper Giorgos Karagounis and left-back Jose Holebas, who were both suspended in the win over Russia. Georgios Tzavelas had already usurped Holebas in the left-back slot so will continue, but the likes of Sotiris Ninis, Grigoris Makos and Giorgos Fotakis will battle for Karagounis’ midfield berth.\n\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\n\nPlayed – 8\n\nGermany Wins – 5\n\nDraws – 3\n\nGreece Wins – 0\n\nFORM GUIDE\n\nGermany – WWWWL\n\n17-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Denmark 1-2 Germany\n\n13-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Netherlands 1-2 Germany\n\n09-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Germany 1-0 Portugal\n\n31-May-12 – Friendly – Germany 2-0 Israel\n\n26-May-12 – Friendly – Switzerland 5-3 Germany\n\nCzech Republic – WLDWD\n\n16-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Greece 1-0 Russia\n\n12-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Greece 1-2 Czech Republic\n\n08-Jun-12 – Euro 2012 – Poland 1-1 Greece\n\n31-May-12 – Friendly – Greece 1-0 Armenia\n\n26-May-12 – Friendly – Greece 1-1 Slovenia\n\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\n\nMesut Ozil (Germany)\n\nThe Real Madrid star has had a relatively quiet tournament so far with just one assist to his name, but Joachim Low has backed the playmaker to “explode” in the knockout rounds just like he did in the World Cup two years ago. Indeed, a return to the form he showed in South Africa which earned him a move to Real Madrid may just be what is needed to get the zip back into Germany’s build-up play in the final third, which has at times looked a bit lifeless.\n\nMario Gomez (Germany)\n\nComing from a highly successful season with Bayern Munich and with already three goals in three group games, the German striker is the favourite to win the Golden Boot award. But with Greece boasting a record of the least number of goals conceded during qualifying, the former Stuttgart striker will have to be at his very best to score today and help his side reach the semi-finals.\n\nKyriakos Papadopoulos (Greece)\n\nWith Greece most likely to sit on the backfoot and defend rather than playing some free-flowing, eye-catching attacking football, their defending will have to be up to the task to give them any chance of pulling off an upset against the slick passing game of the Germans. The 20-year-old Schalke defender, Papadopoulos was reliable at the back in the group stages and his physical strength and ability to read the game will aid him well in his duel with Mario Gomez.\n\nGeiorgios Samaras (Greece)\n\nThe Celtic striker was impressive against the Russians the other night, holding up the ball and going past the defenders with ease. Often played out on the wide, the 27-year-old put in some dangerous crosses and also tracks back to help out his defenders. Although he hasn’t scored in the tournament yet, he remains an integral part of the Greece as justified by manager Fernando Santos by handing him a start in all the games till now.\n\nPROBABLE LINEUPS\n\nGermany (4-2-3-1): Manuel Neuer; Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Holger Badstuber, Philipp Lahm; Sami Khedira, Bastian Schweinsteiger; Thomas Muller, Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski; Mario Gomez.\n\nGermany have stuck with their best players all through the tournament and coach Joachim Low will not wish to mess with the winning eleven much. Bayern stopper Neuer will start in between the sticks and will be hoping to deal with the Greek attacks. The defence will see the return of Jerome Boateng in place of Lars Bender after serving his suspension, despite the later scoring the winning goal against Denmark. Hummels, Badstuber and Lahm are expected to make up the rest of the defence. Khedira and Schweinsteiger will protect the defensive line while also assisting the attacking midfield trio of Muller, Ozil and Podolski. Star striker Mario Gomez, who is the joint topscorer in the competition with 3 goals and will get the nod again ahead of the veteran Miroslav Klose.\n\nGreece (4-2-3-1): Michalis Sifakis; Vasilis Torosidis, Kyriakos Papadopoulos, Avraam Papadopoulos, Giorgos Tzavelas; Kostas Katsouranis, Giannis Maniatis; Dimitris Salpigidis, Giorgos Fotakis, Geiogios Samaras; Theofanis Gekas.\n\nGreece coach Fernando Santos will be without captain Giorgos Karagounis and Jose Holebas, who are both suspended, while goalkeeper Kostas Chalkias is unlikely to recover from his hamstring injury in time. Sifakis who has yet to concede a goal in his two appearances since coming on as a substitute against the Czech Republic will start in the between the sticks for the Greeks. The back four of Torosidis, Kyriakos Papadopoulos, Avraam Papadopoulos and Tzavelas will guard the goal ahead of Sifakis. Katsouranis and Maniatis will play in the midfield protecting their defence as well as assisting in the attack. Ninis might get a chance over here with skipper suspended but Santos may go for the experience of Fotakis to play behind the striker Gekas and in between Samars and Salpigidis.\n\nMATCH ODDS\n\nGermany 3/10 Draw 21/5 Greece 10/1\n\nPREDICTION\n\nThe Germans are known for their free-flowing attacking football, while the Greeks are known to be defensively very sound and they showed it against the Russians. It’s going to be a contest of attack versus the defence, as the Germans would look to attack from the first minute and look score an early goal, while the Greeks would look to defend and try to hit their opponents on the counter or from the set-peices. Greece have some very hardworking players who gave their best to win the match against Russia, but the Germans have talent and quality in their side alongwith some game changing individuals and that might be too much for Fernando Santos’ men to handle.\n\nPredicted Score – Germany 2-0 Greece\n\nThe first round of group matches is over and yesterday we saw the England and France game ending as expected in a 1-1 draw, and later Andriy Shevchenko headed in two goals to help Ukraine register a surprising victory over Sweden. Today, it’s time for round two, as we see the teams from Group A back in action.\n\nThe first match of today sees Greece – who drew against co-hosts Poland in the opening game of the tournament – take on Czech Republic – who were thrashed by Russia in their opening game – in Wroclaw, while co-hosts Poland take on the inform Russians in the second match of today in Warsaw.\n\nDate – 12th June, 19:00 GMT\n\nStadium – Municipal Stadium, Wroclaw\n\nPrediction – Greece had a chance to win their first game against Poland but they did really well to comeback from a goal down and a man down to earn a vital point. Today they face Czech Republic who were mercilessly torn apart by Russia in their first game. This is an important match for both the teams as a win for either team would mean a lot. Expect this game to be an open one with both teams going for the win. There would be end to end football with both teams attacking from the start and the match would be like yesterday’s Ukraine v Sweden game. Skipper Giorgos Karagounis – who missed the penalty against Poland – will give his team the lead before Michal Kadlec heads in the equaliser just before half time. After the interval, the Czechs will go on the offensive and score the second through Vaclav Pilar after some good work by skipper Tomas Rosicky. Greece would attack with all guns firing and in the end they will get their equaliser in the dying moments of the game and it would be Georgios Samaras to do so. The game will end with in draw, a fair result in the end.\n\nPredicted Final Score – Greece 2-2 Czech Republic (Karagounis, Samaras ; Kadlec, Pilar)\n\nDate – 12th June, 21:45 GMT\n\nStadium – National Stadium, Warsaw\n\nPrediction – Poland missed a chance to win the opening game of the tournament, after they had taken an early lead and their opponents were a man down for more than a half, but in the end they were lucky to get a point from that game. On the other hand, the Russian were inform against the Czechs and just tore them apart scoring four goals. Expect this game to be another end-to-end affair with both teams going for all the three points. Russians will have their attacking football, while the co-hosts Poland will have home support behind their back. Russian skipper Andrey Arshavin, who was inspirational in the first game, will give his side the lead in the first fifteen minutes, only for Robert Lewandowski to equalise before half time. Russia will come out and dominate the game in the second half and will soon get their second goal through the inform Alan Dzagoev. Poland will then go on the offence in search for the equaliser but the Russians will hit them on the counter and Arshavin will get his second of the game and wrap up the game for his country. A deserved win for Russia, while the co-hosts face Czech Republic in the final group game, with nothing less than a win needed.\n\nPredicted Final Score – Poland 1-3 Russia (Lewandowski ; Arshavin, Dzagoev, Arshavin)\n\nPopulation 10.7 million Area 131,990km2 Capital Athens Currency Euro Official Language Greek\n\nFOOTBALL FACTFILE\n\nFootball Asocciation Ελληνική Ποδοσφαιρική Ομοσπονδία (EPO) Official Site http://www.epo.gr Year of formation 1926 Euro Ranking 10 World Ranking 14 National Stadium Athens Olympic Stadium, Athens Well-known club sides Olympiakos, Panathinaikos, PAOK Leading goalscorer Nikos Anastoppious (29) Most capped player Theodoros Zagorakis (120) European Championship finals attended 1980, 2004, 2008 Best European Championship performance Winners 2004 Playing Record in European Championship P114 W55 D22 L37 Odds of winning UEFA EURO 2012 66/1\n\nJOURNEY TO POLAND/UKRAINE\n\nGiven the lack of attacking talent at Greece’s disposal it’s dismissive, but not entirely dangerous to say it would be a miracle for them to repeat their achievements of 2004 in Poland & Ukraine. While our hats remain firmly tipped at the most awesome of achievements, we are quite sure that for Greece at least lighting will not be striking twice.\n\nGoals are simply too hard to come by for this team at the moment. They were the lowest scoring of all the UEFA EURO 2012 qualified countries, finding the net an impoverished 14 times in their 10 games and even recalling 32-year-old Angelos Charisteas from the international wilderness.\n\nThe good news for Greece fans is that they were resilient defensively. Under Otto Rehhagel, they were miserly in gifting opportunities and remain as unyielding now, conceding just five goals in qualifying.\n\nUnfortunately for the neutral then, it would appear Greece will sit tight, defend as a unit with 10 mean behind the ball, and look to benefit from the minimal opportunities they create. they were the kings of narrow wins in qualifying, so why commit sporting suicide at the main event?\n\nWe’re forgetting one thing in all this negative points though: they were undefeated in their group and forced Croatia into a play-off dogfight. While being no pushovers, they will hold little feat going into the finals.\n\nHOW THEY GOT THERE\n\n03/09/2010 – Group F – Greece 1-1 Georgia\n\n07/09/2010 – Group F – Coratia 0-0 Greece\n\n08/10/2010 – Group F – Greece 1-0 Latvia\n\n12/10/2010 – Group F – Greece 2-1 Israel\n\n26/03/2011 – Group F – Malta 0-1 Greece\n\n04/06/2011 – Group F – Greece 3-1 Malta\n\n02/09/2011 – Group F – Israel 0-1 Greece\n\n06/09/2011 – Group F – Latvia 1-1 Greece\n\n02/10/2011 – Group F – Greece 2-0 Croatia\n\n11/10/2011 – Group F – Georgia 1-2 Greece\n\nHOME AND AWAY KITS\n\nGROUP FIXTURES – GROUP A\n\nFriday, 08/06 – Poland v Greece (Warsaw, 17:00)\n\nTuesday, 12/06 – Greece v Czech Republic (Wroclaw, 17:00)\n\nSaturday, 16/06 – Greece v Russia (Warsaw, 19:45)\n\nFINAL SQUAD\n\nGoalkeepers: Kostas Chalkias (PAOK FC), Michalis Sifakis (Aris Thessaloniki FC), Alexandros Tzorvas (US Città di Palermo).\n\nDefenders: Vassilis Torossidis (Olympiacos FC), Kyriakos Papadopoulos (FC Schalke 04), Sokratis Papastathopoulos (SV Werder Bremen), Avraam Papadopoulos (Olympiacos FC), José Holebas (Olympiacos FC), Giorgos Tzavellas (AS Monaco FC), Stelios Malezas (PAOK FC).\n\nMidfielders: Kostas Katsouranis (Panathinaikos FC), Giorgos Karagounis (Panathinaikos FC), Giannis Maniatis (Olympiacos FC), Giorgos Fotakis (PAOK FC), Grigoris Makos (AEK Athens FC), Giannis Fetfatzidis (Olympiacos FC), Sotiris Ninis (Panathinaikos FC), Kostas Fortounis (1. FC Kaiserslautern).\n\nForwards: Dimitris Salpingidis (PAOK FC), Giorgos Samaras (Celtic FC), Fanis Gekas (Samsunspor), Nikos Liberopoulos (AEK Athens FC), Kostas Mitroglou (Atromitos FC).\n\nTHE CAPTAIN – GIORGOS KARAGOUNIS\n\nKaragounis scored the opening goal in the opening game of UEFA EURO 2004 against hosts Portugal, and, to the football world’s shock, lifted the trophy 22 days later in Lisbon. He embodies the battling spirit of the side, which sometimes gets him on the wrong side of the referees. Karagounis holds the record for the most yellow cards in the European Championship. A tough player indeed.\n\nTHE KEEPER – ALEXANDROS TZORVAS\n\nMoved to Italy and the Sicilian capital of Palermo for the start of the 2011/12 season and has received a mixed reception after some patchy performances. he remains the first choice for his country though, and has earned consistently good reviews after Greece’s fine defensive performances during the qualification period. Will be a much busier man at this tournament.\n\nSTAR MAN – SORITIS NINIS\n\nBorn in Albania to Greek parents, Sotiris Ninis is Fernando Santos’ trump card, his diamond in the rough if you like that. In a side somewhat weighed down by seniority and dogged experience Ninis, who plays in the hole behind the strikers, provides the spark, the enthusiasm and the guile that can lift this Gree team to better things. He possesses great vision, the ability to pick the right pass and a fearsome shot. He won the Greek Young Footballer of the Year in 2007 and 2010, and will be looking turn some heads this summer.\n\nTHE MANAGER – FERNANDO SANTOS\n\nThe task of replacing Otto Rehhagel was never going to be an easy one. Fernando Santos’ predecessor delivered the most unlikely trophy in football history to Athens in 2004 – but to his credit, Santos has made an immediate impact. He has led Greece to UEFA EURO 2012 as group winners, brusing aside Slaven Bilic’s Croatia in the process. His approach bears similarities with Rehhagel’s – physical teams that are tough to break down – and steering Greece through Group A will probably be limit of his ambitions here.\n\nTOURNAMENT PREDICTION\n\nGroup Stage – It won’t be easy for the Blue-Whites to get out of their group. They will not have passionate home support of co-hosts Poland, lack the flair of Russia and the attacking threat of Czech Republic. Even though Greece will be hard to break down, but their lack of creative midfielders and quality strikers will be the main reason behind their failure to get out of the easiest looking group at the tournament. A solid defence and team spirit are unlikely to be enough."
