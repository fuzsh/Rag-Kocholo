        "text": "The 35-year-old Greece captain had been available on a free transfer after being released by Panathinaikos at the end of last season and Fulham manager Martin Jol said he would add many different qualities to the squad.\n\n“Giorgos Karagounis has a wealth of club and international experience and I'm happy that he's joined us for this season,” he said.\n\n\"He's been an influential player for his club sides and is a renowned player in world football as he's about to become the most-capped player for Greece.”\n\nThe veteran, who has previously played for Inter Milan and Benfica, will help to fill the central midfield void left at Fulham following the summer transfer window exits of Clint Dempsey and Mousa Dembele to Tottenham.\n\nKaragounis said: \"I'm delighted to have signed for Fulham Football Club and I am excited by a new challenge in England and the Premier League.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to working under Martin Jol and playing alongside some fantastic players at this club.\"\n\nEuro 2012 saw Karagounis earn a record-equalling 120th cap for Greece before missing the outright record after being controversially suspended for their quarter-final defeat to Germany.\n\nHe scored the only goal of the game, a penalty, against Russia in their final Euro 2012 group game to help Greece unexpectedly reach the quarter-finals."
