We screened long-term SHIV-AD8 infected rhesus monkeys for potency and breadth of serum neutralizing activity against autologous and heterologous viruses: SHIV-AD8, HIV-1 YU2, HIV-1 JR-CSF, and HIV-1 NL4-3. Monkey rh2436 neutralized all viruses tested and showed strong reactivity to the SOSIP trimer, suggesting this was a promising candidate for attempts at monoclonal antibody (MAb) isolation. MAbs were isolated by performing single B-cell sorts from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by FACS using the SOSIP trimer as a probe. An initial round of sorted cells revealed the majority of isolated MAbs were directed to the gp41 external domain portion of the SOSIP trimer and were mostly non-neutralizing against tested isolates. A second sort was performed, introducing a gp41 blocking step prior to PBMC staining and FACS sorting. These isolated MAbs bound SOSIP trimer but were no longer directed to the gp41 external domain portion. A significantly higher proportion of MAbs with neutralizing activity were obtained with this strategy. Our data show this pre-blocking step with gp41 greatly increases the yield of non-gp41-reactive, SOSIP-specific MAbs and increases the likelihood of isolating MAbs with neutralizing activity.\n\nIMPORTANCE Recent advancements in the field have focused on the isolation and use of broadly neutralizing antibodies for both prophylaxis and therapy. Finding a useful probe to isolate broad potent neutralizing antibodies while avoiding non-neutralizing antibodies is important. The SOSIP trimer has been shown to be a great tool for this purpose because it binds known broadly neutralizing antibodies. However, the SOSIP trimer can isolate non-neutralizing antibodies as well, including gp41-specific MAbs. Introducing a pre-blocking step with gp41 recombinant protein decreased the percent of gp41-specific antibodies isolated with SOSIP probe, as well as increased the number of neutralizing antibodies isolated. This method can be used as a tool to increase the chances of isolating neutralizing antibodies.\n\nKEYWORDS: SHIV, SOSIP, gp41, monoclonal antibodies, neutralizing antibodies, rhesus macaques\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver the past decade, advances in single-cell antibody cloning have led to the isolation and characterization of a wide array of potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) from HIV-1 infected individuals. These bNAbs have shown outstanding potential for prophylaxis and therapy using humanized-mice (1,–3), nonhuman primates (NHP) (4,–11), and in human clinical trials (12,–17). In terms of therapy, the passive administration of bNAbs has been found to accelerate viral clearance and decrease viremia in humanized mice (1, 3). Long-term delivery of bNAbs using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a vector in such humanized mice has shown protective immunity against HIV-1 challenge (2). Human clinical trials have shown that passive administration of bNAbs can suppress viremia in infected individuals (12, 16), enhance the humoral response of infected individuals (13), and prevent viral rebound after anti-retroviral therapy (ART) interruption (14, 15, 17). In terms of prophylaxis, the passive transfer of bNAbs in NHPs has prevented the acquisition of simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in macaques (6,–8). The AAV-delivery of bNAbs has also shown promise in preventing the acquisition of SHIV (4). SHIV NHP models have been effectively utilized for the study of anti-HIV-1 MAbs because, similar to HIV-1 infections of humans, SHIV infections of rhesus macaques can cause immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections (10, 18).\n\nSOSIP proteins are being developed as immunogens to potentially elicit a bNAb response and as a probe to isolate bNAbs. SOSIPs are homogenous, soluble, stabilized, trimeric versions of the HIV-1 envelope spike that resemble the native viral spike in antigenicity and topology (19). They are stabilized by a disulfide bond between gp120-gp41 (named “SOS”) and an isoleucine to proline point mutation (named “IP”) at residue 559 (19). These trimers have been made with the gp140 sequences of different strains of HIV-1 (19). BG505 SOSIP.664 is a SOSIP trimer that uses the tier 2, HIV-1 BG505, subtype A gp140 as its base sequence (20). In addition to the SOS and IP mutations, this trimer had the MPER removed, to increase homogeneity and solubility, while preserving other external portions of the gp41 protein. Importantly, the SOSIP trimer conserves neutralizing epitopes, such as: CD4 binding site (CD4bs), CD4-induced (CD4i) epitope, V1/V2 glycan loops, V3-glycan, and gp120/gp41 interface (20,–24). Non-neutralizing antibodies directed to the CD4 binding site and the CD4i epitope were not found to be reactive with the trimer (20). For these reasons SOSIP trimers have been studied as potential vaccine immunogens. The trimer has been shown to elicit a strong antibody response in animal models (25,–29). When SOSIP was used as an immunogen, rabbits, cows, and monkeys have developed NAbs against various epitopes of the SOSIP trimer (19, 25,–32). However, while immune responses could offer autologous protection (26,–29), broader responses are still needed for heterologous protection. Importantly, the base of the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer has been found to be highly immunogenic. When SOSIP was inoculated into rabbits, the SOSIP specific MAbs isolated from those animals were largely directed to the base of the SOSIP trimer and were found to be non-neutralizing (30, 31, 33, 34). Similarly, non-neutralizing SOSIP base binding MAbs were isolated when SOSIP was used as a probe for MAbs isolation from a SHIV infected monkey (35).\n\nWe set out to decrease the frequency of SOSIP trimer base-binding MAbs and to primarily isolate MAbs that bind other portions of the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer. To do this we introduced a pre-blocking incubation of recombinant gp41 protein with monkey PBMC before antibody staining for FACS sorting. The addition of this blocking step resulted in the isolation of better quality MAbs that no longer had gp41 specificity.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMonkey rh2436: a candidate for the isolation of SOSIP-specific monoclonal antibodies.\n\nTo identify a monkey to be a candidate for the isolation of SOSIP-specific monoclonal antibodies, we screened four long-term SHIV-AD8 infected rhesus macaques for serum neutralization and SOSIP reactivity. The neutralization assays were completed against tier 2 viruses SHIV-AD8, HIV-1 YU2, HIV-1 JRCSF, and tier 1 HIV-1 NL4-3 using sera from week 86-post SHIV-AD8 infection. All of the animals showed good levels of autologous neutralization activity, and rh2436 and rh2443 showed good levels of heterologous neutralization activity ( ). Monkey rh2436 showed the highest neutralization titers against all the tested viruses. Titers for rh2436 showed that diluted sera neutralized 50% of virus at greater than 1:512 (the highest tested dilution) for both SHIV-AD8 and HIV-1 NL4-3, 1:250 for HIV-1 JR-CSF, and 1:20 for HIV-1 YU2. This monkey’s serum reactivity to SOSIP was measured at multiple time points (10, 20, 36, 53, 56, 74, and 86 weeks) post SHIV-AD8 infection by ELISA. The animal showed high reactivity to SOSIP starting at 20 weeks post SHIV-AD8 infection ( ), indicating this animal was making SOSIP-binding antibodies.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies isolated initially from monkey rh2436 were SOSIP specific but mostly bound the gp41 portion of the SOSIP trimer and were non-neutralizing.\n\nAt week 155 post SHIV-AD8 infection, PBMC from monkey rh2436 were isolated and stained with commercially available mouse anti-human MAbs (cross-reactive with rhesus) and biotinylated BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer (provided by the Moore Lab (20, 36)). Single CD3-CD14-CD20+IgG+BG505 SOSIP+ B-cells were isolated via FACS sorting ( ). These B-cells were 0.005% of the total PBMC population. The variable heavy, kappa and lambda genes (IgH, IgK, and IgL) were amplified from individual B-cells by two rounds of nested PCR using the primer sets in Table S1. Paired IgH and IgK/IgL genes from the same B-cell were used to make full length IgG1. Twenty-one MAbs were isolated from this sort, and 11 of these were assessed for binding specificity. Antibody binding specificity to SOSIP.664 trimer, gp41, and gp120 were determined by ELISA ( and ). As expected, most of the tested MAbs (91%) were shown to bind SOSIP trimer at varying strengths ( ). However, the majority, 63% (7/11) also strongly bound gp41 ( ), and only one of the MAbs (9%) bound gp120 ( ). Of the antibodies that bound SOSIP, only three did not bind gp41 or gp120: SP1-G03, SP1-A08, and SP1-H07. SP1-A08 bound the SOSIP trimer very weakly. SP1-G03 and SP1-H07 exhibited the strongest reactivity to the trimer. Neutralization assays were completed on all 21 isolated MAbs against autologous and heterologous tier 1 HIV-1 NL4-3, and tier 2 viruses SHIV-AD8 and SHIV-BG505 (please note that SOSIP.664 trimer was made using the Env of HIV-1 BG505). Only 1/21 MAbs showed weak neutralizing activity against NL4-3 at high concentrations (IC50 = 20 μg/ml) ( and Table S2). None of the isolated MAbs showed neutralization activity against SHIV-AD8 or SHIV-BG505 (data not shown).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nAssay (ELISA/neutralization)Sort 1Sort 2 (gp41 blocking)BG505 SOSIP.66410/11 (91%)23/23 (100%)gp1201/11 (9%)3/23 (17%)gp1402/11 (18%)9/23 (39%)gp417/11 (63%)2/23 (8.6%)NL4-3 neutralization1/21 (4.5%)48/86 (56%)SHIV-BG505 neutralization0/21 (0%)5/86 (5.8%)SHIV-AD8 neutralization0/21 (0%)0/86 (0%)Total no. MAbs2186\n\nAdding a pre-blocking step with recombinant gp41 protein resulted in isolation of MAbs with increased yield of non-base binding SOSIP reactivity, some of which showed neutralizing activity against HIV-1 NL4-3.\n\nOur previous FACS sort resulted in a majority of MAbs being gp41 specific. In an attempt to increase the percentage of antibodies binding other SOSIP epitopes, a gp41 blocking step was introduced before cell staining for FACS sorting. PBMC from monkey rh2436, 251 weeks post SHIV-AD8 infection, were isolated and incubated with 10 μg/ml of recombinant gp41 protein prior to being stained with commercially available mouse anti-human MAbs (cross-reactive with rhesus) and biotinylated SOSIP.664 trimer. Single CD3−CD14−CD20+IgG+BG505 SOSIP+ B-cells were isolated via FACS sorting ( ). These isolated B-cells represented 0.0005% of the total PBMC population. Compared to the previous sort without gp41 blocking, there was a 90% decrease in the number of PBMC reactive to the SOSIP probe. A total of 86 MAbs were isolated and a random 23 were examined for reactivity by ELISA; reactivity to SOSIP.664 trimer, gp41, and gp120 were measured ( and ). Of the 23 MAbs tested, all bound SOSIP, with varying strengths ( ). Positivity was defined as at least twice the background levels. The MAbs that bound the trimer the strongest (2SP2-D01-1 and 2SP2-D01-2) also bound monomer gp120 very strongly. Although all the MAbs bound SOSIP, with the exception of the previously stated MAbs, they did so moderately or weakly. Importantly, now only 9% (2/23) of MAbs detectably bound gp41, and did so weakly ( ). This is a statistically significant decrease from the 63% of MAbs binding gp41 in the first sort ( ) (P = 0.0017 by chi square). A total of 13% (3/23) of MAbs bound gp120, two very strongly and one very weakly ( ). Neutralization assays against HIV-1 NL4-3, SHIV-BG505, and SHIV-AD8 were done using all 86 isolated MAbs. Of the total 86 isolated MAbs, 48 (55%) showed neutralizing activity against NL4-3. In the representative sample shown in , 6/23 MAbs showed clear but mild neutralizing activity against NL4-3: 2SP1-C06, 2SP1-F11, 2SP2-A06, 2SP2-G06, 2SP2-G07, and 2SP2-H03. These six MAbs had IC50 concentrations ranging from 3.1 μg/ml to 15 μg/ml: 2SP1-C06, 2SP1-F11, and 2SP2-A06 with IC50 measurements of 5 μg/ml, 2SP2-G06 and 2SP2-G07 with IC50 measurements of 15 μg/ml, and 2SP2-H03 with an IC50 of 3.1 μg/ml ( and Table S2). The IC50 of all 48 MAbs exhibiting neutralizing activity ranged from 3.1 μg/ml to 50 μg/ml (Table S2). This is a statistically significant increase in the percent of antibodies exhibiting neutralizing activity against this virus when compared with the first sort (P < 0.0001, by chi squared test). Weak neutralizing activity against SHIV-BG505 was exhibited by 5 of the MAbs (5.8%): 2SP3-D03 (IC50 = 2.5 μg/ml), 2SP3-C11 (IC50 = 12.5 μg/ml), 2SP3-A10 (IC50 = 22 μg/ml), 2SP2-H03 (IC50 = 25 μg/ml), and 2SP3-A08 (IC50 = 35 μg/ml). However, none of these antibodies were able to completely neutralize SHIV-BG505 virus (data not shown). None of the antibodies showed neutralization activity against SHIV-AD8 (data not shown).\n\nGenetic characteristics of isolated MAbs.\n\nThe variable gene (IgH and IgK/IgL) of the 21 MAbs from the initial SOSIP sort and the 86 MAbs from the subsequent sort with a pre-blocking step with recombinant gp41 protein were sequenced. The sequences were analyzed using IMGT/V-QUEST, an integrated alignment tool for immunoglobulin nucleotide sequences (37, 38). IMGT/V-QUEST compares IG variable sequences to their reference directory set. The average somatic hypermutation (SHM) was calculated by comparison to rhesus macaque germline sequences found in the IMGT database. The first sort yielded antibodies with an average IgH SMH of 8.83% ± 0.65% and an average IgK/IgL SHM of 4.98% ± 0.37% ( ). The average IgH CDR3 length was 15 aa ± 2 aa, and the IgK/IgL average CDR3 length was 10 aa ± 0.5 aa ( ). In this sort only one MAb showed neutralizing activity: SP1-G03. This MAb had 10.07% IgH SHM, which is almost 2 standard deviations above the mean SHM in this sort. The IgK SHM of this MAb was 3.6% (Table S2). The antibodies from the second sort, those with a pre-blocking step with recombinant gp41 protein, had an average IgH SMH of 10.71% ± 0.43% and an average IgK/IgL SHM of 6.94% ± 0.29% ( and Table S2). Of the 48 MAbs isolated from this sort that showed neutralizing activity, 19 had IgH SHM at least two standard deviations above the mean. The average CDR3 lengths were 16 aa ± 3 aa and 9 aa ± 0.8 aa for IgH and IgK/IgL, respectively ( and Table S2). The increase in SHM in antibodies from the second sort (those obtained with the pre-blocking with gp41) was statistically significant for both heavy and light chains between both sorts (P = 0.047 and P = 0.0021, respectively, by unpaired t test). There was no significant difference between CDR3 lengths between the sorts. IMGT provided the germline IG variable sequence that was most similar to the isolated antibodies. All isolated heavy chains from both sorts were from one of four IgH V-genes (VH1, VH3, VH4, or VH5). However, in the second sort we saw an increase in the number of antibodies with VH1 origin from 5% of isolated antibodies to 30%. There was also a marked decrease of those with a VH3 origin from 33% to 11% ( ). Of all the antibodies from both sorts showing neutralizing activity, 18/49 had VH1 origin and 23/49 had VH4 origin (Table S2). The light chain V-genes varied in the two sorts with VK1, VK2, and VL2 being the common gene families. The majority of MAb isolated from first sort were lambda chains of VL2 origin. In the second sort there was an increase of antibodies of VK1 gene from 21% to 50%, making the majority of antibodies isolated VK1 ( ). Of the 48 antibodies exhibiting neutralization activity, 25/48 had VK1 origin (Table S2).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe availability of MAbs with potent neutralizing activity against a broad range of HIV-1 isolates holds enormous promise for both the treatment and prevention of HIV infections. SOSIP molecules that resemble the native trimer configuration have contributed importantly to the isolation and characterization of many of these MAbs. In our initial sort described here using SOSIP positive selection, we found that the majority of MAbs (7 of 11) recognized gp41 and only 1 of the 11 had weak neutralizing activity against the NL4-3 strain of HIV-1. The reactivity to gp41 indicates reactivity to the base of the SOSIP trimer, i.e., sequences from the external domain of the gp41 transmembrane protein. The preponderance of gp41-specific MAbs from the first sort is consistent with a number of prior studies in which the isolation of non-neutralizing, SOSIP base-specific antibodies has been reported (30, 31, 33,–35). In one study, 55% of isolated MAbs were base-specific (35). It has consequently been postulated that the base of the SOSIP trimers contains an immunodominant non-neutralizing epitope (39, 40).\n\nIn an attempt to optimize the isolation of SOSIP-specific MAbs preventing isolation of antibodies targeting the immunodominant base-specific epitopes of the SOSIP trimer, we introduced a blocking step using gp41. To our knowledge, this method of de-selection of MAbs has not previously been used. Our strategy builds on the work of other groups that have used different methods of negative selection of MAbs. For instance, the bNAb PGDM1400 was isolated by sorting for B-cells that bound BG505 SOSIP.664 but not JR-CSF gp120 (41). This allowed for the selection of MAbs that would bind trimer but not nonfunctional trimers or monomeric gp120. Interestingly, the strain JR-CSF was used instead of BG505 because the BG505 gp120 monomer was found to bind some NAbs (20, 41). The bNAbs PDGM11 through 14 were isolated targeting the high-mannose patch epitope region using negative selection. B-cells were sorted that bound gp120 WT+ but not gp120 N332A. The antibodies were isolated from donors whose neutralization breadth and potency were N332 glycan dependent. In this case, the bait used for negative selection, gp120 N332A, had a point mutation at the N332 glycan such that MAbs that bound this bait would not exhibit N332 glycan dependent neutralization (42). Similar to PGDM11-14, VRC01 was also isolated targeting a specific epitope, the CD4bs, using 2 probes: one for positive selection and one for negative selection. Resurfaced core 3 (RSC3) is a glycoprotein that mimics the CD4bs that is resurfaced with SIV homolog substitutes and non-HIV residues. B-cells were selected that bound RSC3 but not ΔRSC3 (a RSC3 mutated to prevent CD4 binding) (43). All these methods have used two probes for the simultaneous negative and positive selection of desired B-cells. Our approach achieves a similar goal of preventing the selection of an unwanted population of B-cells, but differs in that the negative selection happens before staining and FACS sorting. This process allows for FACS sorting to be done on more specific populations of interest.\n\nAfter implementing the gp41 pre-blocking step, the number of gp41 binding MAbs was drastically reduced as only 1 of the 23 characterized MAbs reacted with gp41 by ELISA and 6 of the 23 showed some level of neutralizing activity against NL4-3. While it is disappointing that MAbs with more impressive neutralizing activity were not obtained in our study, implementation of the gp41 blocking step will hopefully facilitate the isolation of desirable MAbs moving forward. One critical factor for the modest neutralizing activity in the MAbs that were obtained likely relates to monkey rh2436 that was used for the sample source. While it was the best of the 4 SHIV-infected monkeys that were examined in our pre-screen, it lacked the potency and breadth typically seen in HIV-infected humans used for the isolation of MAbs with potent neutralizing activity against a broad range of isolates (44,–47). Another factor for the weak neutralizing activity is that the sequence of the gp41 protein used in pre-blocking step is slightly different than the sequence of the gp41 portion of the SOSIP trimer. Therefore, it is possible that some non-neutralizing gp41-specific MAbs were still isolated.\n\nThe MAbs isolated from the second sort had significantly higher somatic hyper mutation (SHM) in both the IgH and the IgK/IgL than MAbs isolated from the first sort. The 6 MAbs from the second sort and the one MAb from the first sort that showed neutralizing activity against NL4-3 had SHM that was at least one standard deviation above the mean in either the IgH or IgK/IgL. Due to the fact that extensive SHM is a characteristic of most potent bNAbs (48,–50), this increase in SHM is likely responsible for the increase in frequency of MAbs exhibiting neutralizing activity. It has been observed that bNAbs with higher levels of SHM exhibit higher neutralizing breadth and potency than those with less SHM (48,–52). We also found that the germline IG-families of the light chains from which isolated MAbs originated were different between the two sorts. After the gp41 pre-blocking step, the heavy chain variable domain germlines of the second sort showed a drastic increase in the frequency of gene VH1, in combination with a marked decrease in VH3 gene. This could indicate that the variable domain of the heavy chain of antibodies targeting the gp41 portion of the SOSIP mostly originated from the VH3 family, while those that bound alternate epitopes on the trimer and had neutralizing activity were more likely to be from the VH1 family. Although intriguing, it has been shown that the development of bNAbs is not restricted by their germline IG gene repertoire (53); however, in some cases it has been seen that some specificities predominantly arise from a determined germline (54, 55). Many antibodies targeting the CD4bs, including VRC01-like MAbs, have similar paths of heavy chain maturation through the VH1-2 gene (56) and VH1-46 gene (57). Similarly, many antibodies targeting the CD4i epitope share a VH1-69 germline origin (58). PGT125-128, PGT130-131, and PGT135-137 share a VH4-39 germline origin, while PGT121-123 share a VH4-59 germline origin (50, 53). We also found changes in the light chain germline origin in the two sorts. From the second sort, more antibodies that emerged from VK1 were isolated, with a majority of neutralizing MAbs being from this IGVK family, as well as the one neutralizing MAb from the first sort. Importantly, while the VL2 germline family was predominant in the first sort and all of the gp41 specific antibodies shared the VL2 germline, very few antibodies arising from this family were isolated in the second sort; this suggests that antibodies targeting the base of the SOSIP may primarily bear light chain variable domains that originate from VL2.\n\nWhile SOSIP trimers are valuable tools for neutralizing antibody isolation due to their native-like trimer conformation, it is important to explore ways to increase the likelihood of isolating desired antibodies. We have described here a new method that utilizes pre-blocking with gp41 to improve the efficiency of isolating MAbs with non-gp41 specificities using the SOSIP trimer.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nAnimals.\n\nThe four animals used in this study were Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) housed at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (Madison, Wisconsin). They were cared for in accordance with the guidelines of the Weatherall Report under a protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin Graduate School Animal Care and Use Committee. All the animals were female. The average age of the animals at the time of SHIV-AD8 inoculation was 3.5 years (ranging from 3.4 to 3.6).\n\nSingle cell sort.\n\nFresh PBMC were isolated from whole blood samples collected from monkey rh2436 at weeks 155 and 251 post SHIV-AD8 infection. Biotinylated BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer was used as a probe. BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer was kindly provided by Dr. John Moore (20, 36). The trimer was biotinylated using BirA enzyme (Avidity) by the manufacturer’s instruction. Week 155 PBMC were incubated with biotinylated SOSIP.664 trimer for 45 min at 4°C, washed with PBS and incubated with a cocktail of mouse anti-human antibodies in PBS: anti-CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD, 552852, RRID:AB_394493), anti-CD14-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD, 562692, RRID:AB_2737726), anti-CD20-clone L27- APC-H7 (BD, 641396, RRID:AB_1645724), IgG-clone G18-145-FITC (BD, 560952, RRID:AB_396121), and Streptavidin-PE (SigmaAldrich, 42250) for 30 min at room temperature. Single CD3−CD14−CD20+IgG+BG505 SOSIP+ B-cells were sorted into individual wells of a 96-well plate in 5 μl lysis buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 100 mM DTT, IGEPAL CA-630, yeast tRNA, and RNase inhibitor) per well using a FACS Aria II cell sorter (BD). Sorted cells were stored at −80°C until use. Week 251 PBMC were sorted similarly to week 155 PBMC, except week 251 PBMC were first incubated with gp41 HIV-1/HXBc2 (Immune Tech IT-001-005p) in PBS for 45 min before the SOSIP incubation.\n\nSingle cell reverse transcription-PCR.\n\nIn each well containing lysed cells, cDNA was synthesized by adding 150 ng random hexamer primers, 10 mM dNTPs, 200 U SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen 18080-044), and 1 μl of water. The reaction was incubated at 42°C for 10 min, 25°C for 10 min, 50°C for 60 min and 94°C for 5 min. To amplify the heavy, kappa, and lambda chain DNA, three nested PCRs were performed using 3 μl of cDNA in 40 μl to 50 μl reactions. The reactions were carried out with HotStart Taq Plus Kit (Qiagen), using 5′ leader sequence and 3′ IgG specific primers. In both sorts, the primers for the first PCRs were those designed by Sundling et al. (59). Primers for the second PCRs were modified from those adapted by Magnani et al. (60) to allow for Gibson Assembly (59, 61). The first round of PCRs were incubated under the following conditions: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 50 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C (heavy chain) or 52°C (light chain) for 30 s, 70°C for 1 min, with a final elongation step of 70°C for 10 min followed by cooling at 4°C. The second round of PCRs were incubated under the following conditions: 95°C for 5 min followed by 10 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 48°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min followed by an elongation step of 72°C for 10 min followed by cooling to 4°C. Nested PCR products were evaluated on a 1.8% Agarose gel and positive wells with a specific band size of ∼450 bp were purified using Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, D4008).\n\nCloning.\n\nThe gel purified products from the second PCR were ligated via Gibson Assembly into rhesus IgG1 expression vectors pFUSE2ss-CHIg-rhG1, pFUSE2ss-CLIg-rhK (InvivoGen), and a similar construct encoding rhIgLC1*01 (60) using the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs, E5510). Amplified and cloned products were sequenced and analyzed using IMGT/V-QUEST to identify SHM and V(D)J rearrangement. IMGT/V-QUEST is an integrated alignment tool for immunoglobulins and T-cell receptor nucleotide sequences. It compares variable domain sequences to their reference directory sets.\n\nMonoclonal antibody expression.\n\nThe antibody heavy and light chain plasmids carrying the inserted variable gene were transfected in equal ratio into ExpiCHO cells or Expi293F cells. Antibodies transfected in ExpiCHO cells were cultured at an initial density of 6 million cells/ml using ExpiCHO Expression System (Life Technologies, A29129) using the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell culture supernatant was harvested 10 days posttransfection and purified by protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, 17507901). Antibodies transfected in HEK293T cells were cultured at an initial density of 6 million cells/ml using Expi293 Expression System (Life Technologies, A14351-01) by manufacturer’s instructions. Cell culture supernatant was harvested 6 days posttransfection and purified using Protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, 17507901).\n\nNeutralization assays.\n\nReplication competent viruses were made by transfecting HEK293T cells using JetPrime (Polypus Transfection, 114-15) and harvesting the supernatant after 72 h. Virus stocks were stored at −80°C until use. Virus neutralization was measured as a function of Tat-inducible luciferase reporter gene expression using TZM-bl cells (NIH AIDS Reagent Program, NIH-ARP 8129) as previously described (62, 63). Briefly, 2 ng/well of replication competent virus was incubated with purified antibodies or monkey sera for 1 h at 37°C in a total volume of 100 μl in 96-well opaque flat-bottom plates (Falcon, 353296). Antibodies were 4-fold serially diluted from a starting concentration of 50 μg/ml. Serum samples were 2-fold serially diluted in growth media. Freshly trypsinized TZM-bl cells (10,000 cells in 100 μl of growth media) were added to each well. After a 48-h incubation at 37°C, 100 μl of culture medium was aspirated and 100 μl of Lite Brite reagent (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences) were added to wells. The plates were incubated at RT for 2 min to allow full lysis of the cells. Luminescence output was measured using a Biotek Synergy H1 Microplate Reader. The inhibitory concentration that resulted in 50% neutralization of the virus (IC50) was determined as the sample concentration that caused a 50% reduction in relative light units (RLU) in comparison to virus control (cells and virus only).\n\nELISA.\n\nMonoclonal antibody binding to BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer and HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 were measured by ELISA. For SOSIP binding ELISA plates (96-well, high binding plates; Corning-Costar, 3690) were coated with 2 μg/ml of mouse anti-avi-tag monoclonal antibody (MyBiosource, MBS8241550) in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37°C, washed with 0.05% PBS-Tween20 (Sigma, 3563), then coated with 2.5 μg/ml avi-tagged BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer in PBS. For all other ELISAs plates were coated with 2 μg/ml of gp120 (Immune Technology, IT-001-023p) or gp41 (Immune Technologies, IT-001-005p) in PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Antibodies 10–1074 and 2F5 (NIH HIV/AIDS repository, #1475) were used as positive controls. Following the coating step, plates were washed with 0.05% PBS-Tween20 and blocked with 5% dry milk in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. Following blocking, monoclonal antibodies were added to the plates at 1 μg/ml in blocking solution and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were washed, then incubated with goat anti-human IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech 2045-05) diluted 1:5,000 in blocking solution for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were washed and developed by the addition of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, BioLegend, 421501). The reaction was stopped by the addition of TMB Stop Solution (SouthernBiotech, 0412-01). Plates were read at 450 nm with a Biotek Synergy H1 Microplate Reader.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank John Moore and Albert Cupo for providing the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer; Núria Pedreño López and Shara Pantry for guidance and technical assistance; Desiree Mendes, Pratibha D.
