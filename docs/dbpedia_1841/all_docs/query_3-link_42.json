        "text": "Establishing cause and effect is important to confidently make rational decisions. For example, to be confident that a change is likely to improve human health or performance requires knowledge of the cause which can induce the desired effect. Establishing cause and effect, however, can be challenging. The strongest approach to establish causality is the combination of randomisation + external manipulation + replication. This combination minimises biases to result in the best estimate of causal relationships. Work by David Allison and colleagues has highlighted that in 4 of the top nutrition/obesity journals 31% of observational papers in 2006 used inappropriate causal language (https://lnkd.in/edGwTe3U). Causal language can include statements such as causes, effects, increases, decreases, impacts etc. IMO inappropriate use of causal language is a problem for at least two reasons: First it misleads the reader; Second, it devalues the contributions of researchers who go to the efforts of randomising, externally manipulating, and replicating. I was interested to see what proportion of peer-reviewed papers use randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Interestingly, based on a search of PubMed, the proportion of PubMed hits assigned as RCTs of nutrition seems to have peaked ~2010 and as been declining since then. #causalinference #causality #science #randomization\n\n🚨 🅝🅔🅦 🅒🅞🅝🅣🅔🅝🅣 🅐🅛🅔🅡🅣🚨 As a end of year treat to our readers, myself and the Editors-in-Chief of Taylor & Francis's top health economics journals have written an article that gives an insight into what we believe will be essential areas of study in HEOR in 2024.

Then this educational tutorial on how to perform Bayesian meta-analysis of health state utility values using R is a must-read for you! https://lnkd.in/deaFXJ7Z Bayesian meta-analysis stands out for several reasons: 1. Valuable prior information: Integrates previous study findings to enhance the meta-analysis, providing more robust and precise estimates. 2. Explicit heterogeneity handling: More transparently handles the degree of heterogeneity among studies, which is crucial since utility values can be highly variable across studies. 3. Enhanced uncertainty assessment: Generates comprehensive posterior distributions, allowing for better assessment of uncertainties around estimates. This can be incorporated into probabilistic sensitivity analysis during cost-utility analyses—enabling clearer interpretation and informed decision-making. Imagine harnessing these capabilities to produce precise, reliable estimates and make well-informed inferences about utility values. Be empowered—embrace Bayesian meta-analysis in your health economic modelling projects. After all, Bayesian is just intuitive! Thank you, Joseph Alvin Ramos Santos, Robert Grant, and Gian Luca Di Tanna, for sharing your knowledge and empowering us!! #Research #BayesianAnalysis #MetaAnalysis #HSUV\n\nCongratulations on the end-of-year treat for your readers! It's wonderful to see the Editors-in-Chief of Taylor & Francis's top health economics journals coming together to provide insights into essential areas of study in #heor for 2024. The collaboration and effort put into this article are truly commendable. I'm sure it will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in health economics and related fields. Thank you to Ivo Abraham, Ken Lee, Mickaël Hiligsmann, Leslie Citrome, and the entire team for your hard work in putting this together. Cheers to your continued success! 🥂 I look forward to reading the full article and exploring the selected topics. #HEOR #healtheconomics #healthcare #medicaleconomics #pharmacoeconomics #healthequity #metrics #patientpreference #realworldevidence #realworlddata #healthcareaccess #economicsofprevention #rarediseases #expertreviewofpharmacoeconomicsandoutcomesresearch #CMRO #Clinicoeconomicsandoutcomesresearch\n\nWe are pleased to share our latest paper, \"Bayesian Meta-Analysis of Health State Utility Values: A Tutorial with Practical Application in Heart Failure,\" published in #PharmacoEconomics. https://lnkd.in/deaFXJ7Z This tutorial is designed to support researchers in generating robust pooled estimates of health state utility values to inform economic evaluations. Specifically, this work shows the applicability of #Bayesian #meta-analysis for pooling health state utility values through an illustrative example among patients with heart failure. Using data from a systematic review encompassing 21 studies and ready-to-use codes and scripts, this study provides a step-by-step guide for conducting Bayesian meta-analysis using #R. The tutorial adheres to the structured workflow as follows: - Setting up the data - Imputing missing standard deviations - Defining the priors - Fitting the model - Diagnosing model convergence - Interpreting results - Performing sensitivity analyses We showed that the pooled utility value for #HeartFailure was 0.66 with a 95% credible interval of [0.60, 0.70] which was consistent across a series of scenarios according to the imputation of missing standard deviations. This tutorial aimed to foster interest in Bayesian methods and their application to bridge the gap in estimating health state utility values for economic evaluations and policy decisions. We encourage the adoption of Bayesian meta-analysis in synthesising utility values, as it offers a principled means to integrate prior knowledge and handle heterogeneity, leading to intuitive probabilistic interpretations that are critical in decision making.
