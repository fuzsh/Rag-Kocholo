Amongst others his three children were waiting for their hero by wearing shirts of the National with his name printed on them.\n\nBut there were several relatives of Karagounis that pleasantly surprised him with their presents at the airport. He seemed so happy to be surrounded by familiar and beloved faces, after his long absence in the USA and Brazil."
