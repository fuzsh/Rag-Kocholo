        "text": "Georgios \"Giourkas\" Seitaridis (Greek: ÎÎµÏÏÎ³Î¹Î¿Ï \"ÎÎ¹Î¿ÏÏÎºÎ±Ï\" Î£ÎµÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¯Î´Î·Ï [ÊeËorÊioz ËÊurkas seitaËriÃ°is]; born 4 June 1981) is a Greek retired footballer who played as a right-sided full-back and occasionally as a central defender.[1] He has last played in 2013 for Greek Superleague side Panathinaikos, having played previously at PAS Giannina, Porto, Dynamo Moscow and AtlÃ©tico Madrid. He is a former member of the Greece national football team, for which he made a total of 72 international appearances, scoring one goal.[2] He was part of their team which won Euro 2004, for which he was voted into the Team of the Tournament.\n\n\"Giourkas\" means \"Giorgos\" in the Pontic Greek dialect and is his grandfather's name.[3] Both his grandfather and father, Dimitris Seitaridis, were footballers and eventually managers.[4]\n\nGiourkas Seitaridis\n\nSeitaridis playing for Greece in 2008\n\nPersonal information Full name Georgios Seitaridis Date of birth 4 June 1981 (ageÂ 39) Place of birth Piraeus, Greece Height 1.85Â m (6Â ft 1Â in) Position(s) Right back, Centre-back Senior career* Years Team Apps (Gls) 1998â2001 PAS Giannina 40 (5) 2001â2004 Panathinaikos 77 (1) 2004â2005 Porto 23 (0) 2005â2006 Dynamo Moscow 8 (0) 2006â2009 AtlÃ©tico Madrid 59 (0) 2009â2013 Panathinaikos 41 (0) Total 248 (6) National teamâ¡ 2002â2010 Greece 72 (1)\n\nHonours\n\n* Senior club appearances and goals counted for the domestic league only and correct as of 20:43, 13 May 2013 (UTC)\n\nâ¡ National team caps and goals correct as of 13:00, 10 April 2012 (UTC)\n\nClub career\n\nPAS Giannina\n\nOf Pontic Greek heritage, Seitaridis started his professional career with northern Greek side PAS Giannina, nicknamed Ajax of Epirus, in 1997, becoming an important right full-back for the club. Seitaridis helped the team towards the promotion of the Super League 2 in the 1999â2000 at the Greek Superleague.[5] He made a total of 40 league appearances with PAS Giannina, scoring 5 goals.\n\nPanathinaikos\n\nHe was soon spotted by Athens-based club Panathinaikos, and on 12 January 2001 he signed a 5-year contract with them for a total fee of 300 million drachmas.[6] He quickly established himself as a regular player for the team and at the age of 22 he won his first silverware by helping Panathinaikos do the double at the 2003â04 season, winning the 2003â04 Alpha Ethniki and the Greek Cup against rivals Olympiacos.[7]\n\nHe scored his first European goal against Manchester United on 7 March 2001, in a game for the second group stage of the 2000â01 UEFA Champions League.[8] In September of the same year, he was named Greek Young Footballer of 2001, along with Pantelis Kafes and Angelos Charisteas.[9]\n\nPorto\n\nOn 11 June 2004, a day before the eventually successful UEFA Euro 2004 campaign for Greece, it was rumored that Seitaridis signed for Portuguese side, and at the time Champions League holders, F.C. Porto, for a transfer fee of â¬3 million.[10] However, the official announcement was made on 26 July 2004, almost a month and a half later, with rumors linking him to Real Madrid in the meantime.[11][12] He helped the DragÃµes win the Portuguese SuperCup and Intercontinental Cup of that year.[13][14]\n\nDynamo Moscow\n\nOn 23 May 2005, he was sold to Russian side Dynamo Moscow for â¬10 million,[15] following the footsteps of ex-Porto teammates Derlei, Costinha, Maniche and Thiago Silva, who also moved to the Russian club the same year.[16][17] Soon however, Seitaridis began to show his discomfort at the club, failing to settle in Moscow,[18] and claimed the reasons he wanted to leave was that the weather was different from his native Greece and that he could not adapt to the cold.[19] In his one-year spell at the club, he only managed to make 8 league appearances before deciding to leave.[20]\n\nAtlÃ©tico Madrid\n\nOn 16 June 2006 he was transferred to AtlÃ©tico Madrid for a fee of â¬12 million,[21] being the second Greek footballer to play for AtlÃ©tico after striker Demis Nikolaidis.[22] The latter was the one who convinced him to join the club, together with his ex-Dynamo teammate Costinha who joined AtlÃ©tico the same year.[23] Seitaridis was sent off in the first half of his debut game, in the La Liga opening match away to Racing Santander on 27 August 2006.[24] On 15 October 2006, he received his second red card only six games into the season, as he was cautioned twice in a home league game against Recreativo Huelva.[25]\n\nHe scored his first goal for AtlÃ©tico the following year, on 21 July 2007, in a game against Gloria BistriÅ£a for the Intertoto Cup.[26] In November 2007, Seitaridis damaged his achilles tendon in a match against UD AlmerÃ­a, which meant he needed to undergo surgery.[27] His period of absence was initially evaluated at about six weeks, but he was ready two and a half months later, in April 2008.[27][28] Due to his injury problem, he only managed to make 14 league appearances for AtlÃ©tico in the 2007â08 season.[29]\n\nThe 2008â09 season did not start well for Seitaridis, as he lost his place in the first team to new signings TomÃ¡Å¡ UjfaluÅ¡i and John Heitinga, and his heavy contract meant that AtlÃ©tico was looking to sell him.[30] Despite that, Seitaridis was a starter in AtlÃ©tico's opening game, in a 4â0 victory over MÃ¡laga CF,[31] and went on to make 14 league appearances that season. On 29 April 2009 however, him and teammate Maniche were suspended by AtlÃ©tico's president Enrique Cerezo because they failed to appear in an AtlÃ©tico home match against Sporting GijÃ³n despite not being included in the 18-man squad.[32][33] Two weeks later on 13 May 2009, it was announced that Seitaridis was released by AtlÃ©tico a year before his contract was to expire, with a statement on the club's official website reading \"Seitaridis is therefore free to negotiate with other clubs who may be interested in signing him\".[33]\n\nReturn to Panathinaikos\n\nOn 10 September 2009, the last day of the Greek transfer period for free agent players, Seitaridis signed a 4-year deal with Panathinaikos, returning to the team after five years.[34] It soon became apparent that Giourkas was unfit and was struggling to re-establish himself due to frequent injuries,[35] missing most of the 2009â10 season's matches. However, on 21 March 2010, he surprisingly returned to the line-up for the big derby against rivals Olympiacos,[36] and despite their defeat, Panathinaikos managed to end the season positively by winning the double.[37] Seitaridis himself didn't appear at the 2009â10 Greek Cup final against Aris Thessaloniki due to injury,[38] but made 2 appearances on the road to the final.\n\nThe 2010â11 season started well for Seitaridis, being a starter at Panathinaikos' opening league fixture against Skoda Xanthi on 27 August 2010 and giving a good performance.[39] However, another muscle injury[40] meant that Seitaridis would return at a league game against Panserraikos two months later, on 4 December.[41] Due to the player's poor condition he was placed on the transfer list in January 2011,[42] but despite various offers from foreign teams during the summer transfer period,[43] he stayed at Panathinaikos.\n\nThe 2011â12 season was even more disappointing for him, as he was only used for 45 minutes in an away game against Atromitos, where he was substituted at half-time due to poor performance.[44] He played for a second time in an away game against Asteras Tripoli, staying on the pitch a full 90 minutes.[45]\n\nThe 2012â13 season started well for Seitaridis, playing as a starter in the first three league matches at the beginning of the season. He also contributed with one assist in Panathinaikos' 2012â13 UEFA Europa League group stage match against Tottenham Hotspur, which ended 1â1.[46]\n\nAt the summer of 2013 he didn't renew his contract and left the club.\n\nInternational career\n\nYouth career\n\nSeitaridis is a former Greece under-21 international,[4] making his debut on 6 October 2000, in a 2002 UEFA Under-21 Championship qualifier against Finland under-21.[47] He participated at the finals of the 2002 UEFA Under-21 Championship in Switzerland,[48] where his team was eliminated from the group stage, having collected one point in three games.[49]\n\nFirst steps & UEFA Euro 2004\n\nSeitaridis made his international debut with the senior team on 13 February 2002, in an international friendly match against Sweden.[48][50] He helped Greece qualify to the UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal for the second time in history,[51] and was also one of the key players during Greece's successful campaign, a win that shocked the footballing world as Greece were considered outsiders before the tournament started.[52] Seitaridis won a penalty at the first match against Portugal as he was knocked down by Cristiano Ronaldo.[53] In the final, he also won the important corner by playing the ball in the center which was blocked from Cristiano Ronaldo. Overall his contributions for the victorious team were recognised by naming him as part of the 23-man UEFA 2004 All-Star squad, together with fellow Greek players Antonis Nikopolidis, Traianos Dellas, Theodoros Zagorakis and Angelos Charisteas.[54]\n\nFIFA Confederations Cup 2005\n\nAs a result of Greece's Euro 2004 win, they qualified to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany as European champions. Giourkas Seitaridis was a member of the 23-man squad.[55]\n\nUEFA Euro 2008 & 2010 FIFA World Cup\n\nHe scored his first international goal on 2 June 2007 against Hungary in a Euro 2008 qualifying match,[48][56] helping the Greek national team to qualify to the UEFA Euro 2008 championship. He played twice in the disappointing Euro 2008 campaign for Greece,[57] having been injured during the second game against Russia.[58]\n\nDespite concerns about his fitness,[59] Greece national manager Otto Rehhagel called Seitaridis in his 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[60] He only played for 90 minutes in the first game of the group stage against South Korea, losing 2â0.[1][61] After this game, Seitaridis played two consecutive European and a World Cup with Greece national football team.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nAs of 13 May 2013[62][63]\n\nClub performance League Cup Continental Others Total Season Club League Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Greece League Greek Cup Europe Others Total 1998â99 PAS Giannina Beta Ethniki 6 0 â â â â â â 6 0 1999â00 24 3 â â â â â â 24 3 2000â01 Alpha Ethniki 10 2 â â â â â â 10 2 2000â01 Panathinaikos Alpha Ethniki 12 0 â â 2 1 â â 14 1 2001â02 19 0 1 0 7 0 â â 27 0 2002â03 25 0 2 0 2 0 â â 29 0 2003â04 21 0 6 0 8 0 â â 35 0 Portugal League Portuguese Cup Europe Others Total 2004â05 Porto Primeira Liga 23 0 2 0 11 0 â â 36 0 Russia League Russian Cup Europe Others Total 2005 Dynamo Moscow Premier League 8 0 â â â â â â 8 0 2006 0 0 â â â â â â 0 0 Spain League Copa del Rey Europe Others Total 2006â07 AtlÃ©tico Madrid La Liga 31 0 2 0 â â â â 33 0 2007â08 14 0 â â 4 1 â â 18 1 2008â09 14 0 2 0 4 0 â â 20 0 Greece League Greek Cup Europe Playoffs Total 2009â10 Panathinaikos Superleague Greece 8 0 2 0 â â â â 10 0 2010â11 7 0 2 0 â â â â 9 0 2011â12 2 0 â â â â 1 0 3 0 2012â13 24 0 3 0 5 0 1 0 33 0 Career total 248 5 22 0 43 2 2 0 315 7\n\nInternational goals\n\nGoal Date Venue Opponent Score Result Competition Ref 1 2 June 2007 Pankritio Stadium, Heraklion, Greece Â Hungary 2â0 2â0 Euro 2008 qualifying\n\nHonours\n\nClub\n\nPAS Giannina\n\nSuper League 2: 1999â2000\n\nPanathinaikos\n\nSuperleague Greece:2003â04, 2009â10\n\nGreek Cup: 2003â04, 2009â10\n\nPorto\n\nPortuguese Super Cup: 2004\n\nIntercontinental Cup: 2004\n\nUEFA Super Cup Runner-up: 2004\n\nInternational\n\nGreece\n\nEuropean Championship: 2004\n\nIndividual\n\nGreek Young Footballer of the year: 2001\n\nUEFA European Championship Team of the Tournament: 2004\n\nReferences\n\n\"Giourkas Seitaridis profile\".
