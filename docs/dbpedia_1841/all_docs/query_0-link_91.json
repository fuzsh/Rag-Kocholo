The clubs first name (while the founders were still in Smyrna) was \"Orfeas Smyrnis\" and it was founded in 1890. Its colors are blue and white because Apollon's founders wanted to honor the Flag of Greece. The club's first badge was a swastika-like cross but just after World War II it was changed (due to the notorious use as a Nazi symbol) and the new badge decided to be the Greek ancient god Apollo's head in blue and white colors.\n\nThe clubs first home ground was located in a place near the building of the Greek Parliament called \"Stiles Olympiou Dios\" (Pillars of Olympian Zeus). Apollon stayed there for about 25 years, and after the World War II the clubs house was transferred in an Athens neighborhood called \"Rizoupolis\" and built a stadium there, which is called Georgios Kamaras Stadium, after a club legend called Georgios Kamaras. The club has four departments: The football department called \"Apollon Smyrnis FC\", a basketball club called \"Apollon BC\", a volleyball club and a fighting department. The most known (and probably the most successful) department is Apollon's football club. Apollon FC participated in Alpha Ethniki championship for many years, except seasons 1969/70, 1972/73, 1974/75, 1986/87. The team won the local Athens Championship 4 times: 1924, 1928, 1938, 1948 and 1958\n\nThe seasons 1994/95 and 1995/96 are the most successful club's seasons: In 1994/95 Apollon qualified for the 1995-96 UEFA Cup (preliminary round) where he played against Olimpija Ljubljana. Georgios Kamaras Stadium was not suitable for the game and Apollon played in AEK Athens home ground, Nikos Goumas Stadium. Apollon won 1-0 in Athens in front of 10.000 Apollon fans but unfortunately lost 3-1 in Ljubljana (Olimpia scored 2 goals in the last 15 minutes) and Apollon was eliminated. In these matches many people noticed a young striker (he was just 21 years old) who almost ten years after this moment would become European football Champion: his name was Demis NikolaidisThe following season (1996-1997) Apollon FC, under Giannis Pathiakakis coaching and thanks to Demis Nikolaidis's integral scoring performances, participated after an excellent season in the Greek Cup final, but they lost 7-1 to AEK Athens. After these great seasons, Apollon's glory started to fade and as a result, in 2000/2001 season Apollon was relegated in Beta Ethniki and in 2005 relegated to Gamma Ethniki (South Group).\n\nApollon have gone since the 1930s under the nickname \"The Light Brigade\" (Greek: Ελαφρά Ταξιαρχία), named after the 1936 Hollywood movie release [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027438/ The Charge of the Light Brigade] , after winning the 1938 regional Athens championship.\n\nTitles\n\nThey have won the Athens championship a few times (1924, 1938, 1948, 1958) but have yet to win a national title.\n\nApollon have been crowned Beta Ethniki champions in 1970, 1973 and 1975.\n\nThey currently play in the Delta Ethniki (Greek Fourth Division D).\n\nTrivia\n\n*Apollon have gone since the 1930s under the nickname \"The Light Brigade\" (Greek: Ελαφρά Ταξιαρχία), named after the 1938 Hollywood movie release [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027438/ The Charge of the Light Brigade] , after winning the 1938 regional Athens championship.\n\n*Since 1910 the team's badge was a swastika-like cross. But after the Nazi invasion in Europe it was changed with Apollo's head for obvious reasons.\n\n*The last time an Apollon FC player was an active member of the Greek national football team was on May 8, 1996 (Demis Nikolaidis, Greece - Georgia 2-1). Since then, no Apollon FC player is a national football team member.\n\n*Georgios Kamaras Stadium was in bad shape during the 90's, but it was renovated in 2001 from Olympiakos FC. Olympiakos used this stadium as home ground until Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium was constructed in 2004.\n\n*Shareholder and team president was from the early 90's until 2005 the businessman Kostas Alamanos. He helped Apollon to participate in the UEFA Cup and in the Greek Cup final and for many years, he was the beloved of Apollon fans. But after these successful seasons, Alamanos became Persona non grata for Apollon fans mainly because he sold many of the team's best footballers (Demis Nikolaidis, Blendar Kola and Theofilos Karasavidis) and released most of the remaining team as free agents. The team was unable to recover from these losses, and in 2000 were relegated. That's why Apollon fans are calling Alamanos \"The Unmentionable\".\n\nNotable former players\n\n;flagicon|Greece Greece\n\n* Kostas Antoniou\n\n* Christos Ardizoglou\n\n* Kostas Chalkias\n\n* Filipos Darlas\n\n* Giorgos Kamaras\n\n* Giorgos Karagounis\n\n* Theofilos Karasavidis\n\n* Thanasis Kolitsidakis\n\n* Vasilis Kyriakou\n\n* Antonis Minou\n\n* Tasos Mitropoulos\n\n* Demis Nikolaidis\n\n* Sotiris Ninis\n\n* Eleftherios Poupakis\n\n* Giannis Dontas\n\n* Giorgos Athanasiadis\n\n* Mihalis Vlahos\n\n* Theofilos Karasavidis\n\n* Aris Karasavidis\n\n* Kostas Batsinilas\n\n* Dimos Kavouras\n\n* Kostas Mavridis\n\n* Pantelis Konstantinidis\n\n* Takis Ikonomopoulos\n\n;flagicon|Albania Albania\n\n* Bledar Kola\n\n* Arjan Bellaj\n\n;flagicon|Argentina Argentina\n\n* Nestor Errea\n\n;flagicon|Bulgaria Bulgaria\n\n* Ivan Russev\n\n;flagicon|Cameroon Cameroon\n\n* Nicolas Dikoume\n\n;flagicon|Czechoslovakia Czechoslovakia\n\n* Frantisek Stambacher\n\n;flagicon|Germany Germany\n\n* Walter Kelsch\n\n;flagicon|the Netherlands Holland\n\n* René van de Kerkhof\n\n;flagicon|Iran Iran\n\n* Alireza Mansourian\n\n;flagicon|Poland Poland\n\n* Józef Wandzik\n\n* Zygmunt Kukla\n\n;flagicon|Serbia Serbia\n\n* Zoran Ciric\n\n;flagicon|United States of America United States of America\n\n* Frank Klopas\n\nExternal links"
