(Even if it was a tragedy or natural disaster) Truth: James 1:13 ?Let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. (King James Version)) 2 Peter 3:9 ? The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance?. (King James Version)) Romans 5:12 tells us the reason why we die due to ?One man sinned, which spread to all men. Soon ?All in the grave will hear Jesus cry out in the same manner he said to Lazarus, he will also say to ?George, Come on out?! (John 11:43) This is the resurrection hope in which the ?Righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for ever? (Psalms 37:29) If you would like to learn more ?accurate truth? from the Bible, please visit the nearest Kingdom Hall of JW?s find in the Yellow Pages of the Church section or visit the website watchtower (.org).\n\nTo the family of George Karagounis: At times when a person dies you will hear myths such as the following: Myth: ?It was God?s Will.?
