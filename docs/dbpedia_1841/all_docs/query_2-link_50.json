Bill and Kiki enjoyed a wonderful life together.\n\nBill was known for his amazing cooking and he loved to cook for others, he also loved to fish, be in his garden and play his Greek instrument the bouzouki for his friends.\n\nBut the thing he was known for by others was his love for the Bible and teaching people about the wonderful future and what Jehovah promises for all mankind.\n\nOne of his favorite scriptures was Revelation 21:4 says: God will wipe out every tear from their eyes and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.\n\nBill's smile and laughter will be missed so much by friends and family, and we can't wait till that day when we can see him again perfect in a paradise earth."
