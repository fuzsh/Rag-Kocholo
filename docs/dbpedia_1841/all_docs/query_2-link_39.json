        "text": "LANCASTER, S.C. – Eight syllables isn’t enough, people. Penelope G. Karagounis insists on the ninth.\n\nThat syllable – “G.” – could easily stand for “Go, Greek girl.”\n\nAt 23, after a two-year stint in the planning department in Pineville, where her immigrant father operated two restaurants for nearly three decades, Karagounis was named a planner in Lancaster County, S.C., whose panhandle snakes up to Pineville’s southwestern border with the Palmetto State.\n\nEight years later, in 2012, longtime county administrator Steve Willis deemed her mature enough to become planning director.\n\nThat’s a daunting assignment at any age, considering her bailiwick includes one of the fastest-growing areas in the Carolinas, Indian Land, whose isolation from the rest of the largely rural county – a county once dominated by textile giant Springs Mills Co. – has created a complex web of geographic, social and economic issues.\n\nIn addition to being a planning director, she’s quite the expert on immigration affairs, which is a frequent topic of her other passion, writing. And her writing is indeed passionate, whether it’s the thesis she wrote for her master’s degree, “Ellis Island Detour: A Case Study of Hispanic Immigrants in Charlotte”; her part-time journalistic work; the book idea at which she occasionally takes stabs; or the recent grant proposal she authored that won the county $110,000.\n\nHer latest literary efforts include a just-enacted clustered-lot residential subdivision zoning category; a highway overlay district, a work-in-progress intended to regulate development along U.S. 521 through the Lancaster panhandle; a soon-to-launch effort to rewrite the county’s long-range comprehensive plan; and after that, a new unified development ordinance.\n\nShe talks as well as she writes, as On the Level discovered over the course of an hour last week in her impeccably orderly office at the Lancaster County Administration Building.\n\nYou were named planning director at 31, quite an achievement. You must have been at this early on. Well, that’s a good story. My dad emigrated from Greece in 1971 – I’m a first-generation American – who like so many of the Greek immigrants in the early 1970s went into the service section, specifically the restaurant business.\n\nOh, yeah? Did he have his own restaurant? Yeah, the Santa Maria. He named it after Christopher Columbus’ ship; he was a Greek American pursuing the American dream, starting out working at a restaurant, the Open Kitchen on Morehead Street, before he opened his own restaurants. But his hobby was looking at real estate and instead of watching Saturday morning cartoons, I went along with him. And that’s the thing about planning: You’re educating people about real estate and development. I represent the public, and developers, and people who have property. But I also represent all the people (of the county), helping educate them. That has always, always interested me. Even as a small child, I was fascinated by places and how they got to be places. I took my first international travel at 4, and I remember that trip to Greece, and I remember what was then the farmland of south Charlotte. I was fortunate from a very young age to see how cities are created. My father returned to visit his village, and the attitude there was, “America is my opportunity.” Back in the 1930s, (immigrants) had candy stores or cleaners. Here in the ’60s and ’70s, it was restaurants; that was the opportunity. People think all Greeks must be great chefs, and while they do have that Mediterranean cuisine, my dad was a forest ranger in the old country. He had Santa Maria with his brother and then started his own restaurant, the Dairy Kitchen, on another side of the same corner, North Polk Street and (N.C.) 51 in Pineville. He was there for 28 years and knew all of Pineville.\n\nSo that sense of place translated into planning? I really got interested in the idea of being a planner in my freshman year at UNC-Charlotte. I took an introduction to geography class from Tink Moore – Tyrel Moore; Tink is his nickname – he’s still on the faculty there. It’s a very good department that doesn’t always get recognized. I spent four years as an undergrad, and after that first year, I knew. I declared my major. The faculty there really motivated me to become a planner. I owe them a lot. I got my master’s in geography there, too, with a concentration in urban and regional analysis. I wrote a thesis that could have been a dissertation. It was about Charlotte as a gateway to the Hispanic community, in 2004. I want to write a book on Greek immigrants in Charlotte. (Immigrant studies) instilled in my head that if you work hard, anything is possible.\n\nWhat is planning issue No. 1 in Lancaster County? It’s the polarization of the community, definitely. It’s 50 miles geographically from the far southeastern end of the county to the tip of the panhandle. But it’s a class polarization of a kind, rural and urban, white collar and blue. We’ve got one unified development ordinance, and what fits in Indian Land might not in Heath Springs or Kershaw, or the rest of the county. There’s another divide, too, that’s a challenge: that state line. The way that Charlotte has grown, it’s all one; there is no line in terms of growth, and people don’t understand that the two states have different state regulations, sometimes very different. And because a lot of the people who come here are not even from the region, they’re used to a different state’s regulations. We have to educate people about that.\n\nIs it frustrating to have so much knowledge about planning but at the same time to have your work be at the mercy of politics? Yes, we do a lot of work that the County Council doesn’t always want to implement, but it’s often worth doing anyway because you learn so much just from doing the work. You’re right, it’s political, and it is frustrating sometimes. But being a planner, and after being here so long, that’s just part of the job. At the end of the day, planners don’t vote. We can recommend all we want. It is frustrating, but it doesn’t shock me when they don’t take our recommendations. I feel good about what I’ve done to educate people about the votes the council takes. Whenever we have a (rezoning) application come in, I post it (on the town website, mylancastersc.org), and we now post agendas and minutes, which we didn’t used to do until recently.\n\nWe in the media appreciate that. More so because you don’t have all the time or staff in the world with which to do it. We have only two planners and myself, though it is important to note that unlike every county in North and South Carolina that I know of, my department, planning, is different from zoning.\n\nThat’s weird. Our department creates the zoning code and handles any rezoning petitions; they enforce the zoning. So altogether we have six people in the two departments, if I’m counting right, and I’ve been communicating to the county administrator that we should bring them together; make it one department.\n\nThat really doesn’t seem like enough staffers, a lot fewer than some towns with far fewer people. One of my best sources on commercial and residential development in the Charlotte market says Lancaster County is overwhelmed planning-wise, in terms of staff and in terms of your zoning ordinance. He must be a good source. We definitely need more people. We do very little long-range planning because we don’t have enough people. The staff here is what it was when I was in Pineville in 2004, and Pineville is what, 7,000 people? We can’t do any long-range planning when we’re barely going through the motion of processing zoning requests. And that’s only going to get worse. The next development area will be Buford, an area of the county just south of Monroe and east of the panhandle. We’ve been getting a lot of inquiries about residential developments.\n\nYou must work long hours, then, because you are starting to do some long-range planning. Oh, yeah. We were here the other night until 9:30. We just got clustered-subdivision zoning passed; and the highway overlay is just for a slender portion of the panhandle, but it’s important; and we’re starting on the process of totally rewriting our comprehensive plan, a long-range planning document, a snapshot of the county – a road map. Then we’ll starting looking at a new unified development ordinance, which hasn’t been redone since 1998. It’s just not working anymore and there are a lot of gray areas. It’s too hard to read and not user-friendly, and we need to create new districts. So many things have changed. Springs (Mills) is no longer the major employer here. We’ve hired the Catawba Regional Council of Governments as a consultant to help rewrite the comprehensive plan knowing that we need to rewrite the UDO after that. As they do the comprehensive plan, the Catawba Council is doing the analytics on how much it is going to take to do the UDO.\n\nYou’re very insistent on the “G.” Penelope G. Karagounis, which is, by the way, a great name for a Greek American. But are there really that many Penelope Karagounises floating around? Why the “G.”, and what does it stand for? Ohhh. Do you really want to hear that story? In the old country, it’s tradition to give the first daughter the father’s mother’s name. So believe it or not, there are a lot of Penelope Karagounises. The G., well, stands for George, my father’s name – another old-country tradition."
