        "text": "1) Pawtucket Textile Strike, 1824\n\nThe Pawtucket Textile Strike took place in May and June of 1824. The strike was a response to a 25% wage cut made by mill owners in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and is credited as being the first industrial strike in American history. It was led by a group of one hundred and one women weavers who walked out from their jobs. It was successful; a settlement was reached in June and the women returned to their jobs.\n\n2) United Tailoresses of New York is created, 1825\n\nThis was the first women’s only union. It was formed in 1825 in order to protest for higher wages and better working conditions. The union raised awareness of the poor conditions faced by textile workers at the time and blamed their strife on the system of male dominance in factories.\n\n3) Mechanic's Union of Trades' Association is created in Philadelphia, 1827\n\nUnions in Philadelphia joined together to create the first trade association in 1827. After the publication of an anonymous letter titled “To the Mechanics and Working-Men of the Fifth Ward, and those friendly to their Interests,” carpenters in Philadelphia were inspired and began to strike for a 10 hour workday. These protestors eventually established the Mechanics’ Union of Trades’ Association.\n\n4) Tailors in Philadelphia go on strike, 1827\n\nIn 1827, tailors in Philadelphia went out on strike to protest the firing of coworkers who demanded a higher wage. The employer responded by taking them to court for conspiracy to harm commerce and the tailors were found guilty. This was a major setback for trade unions at the time.\n\n5) The first Paterson strike, 1828\n\nThe first Paterson Strike took place in Paterson New Jersey, and is one of the first strikes of factory operatives. Textile workers in Paterson protested their lunch hour being changed from noon to one o’clock p.m. The loom workers walked out and other skilled workers joined them in a sympathy strike. As a result, the lunch hour was eventually restored.\n\n6) Workingmen's Party of New York is formed, 1829\n\nThe Workingmen’s Party of New York was formed as a result of unrest caused by shifting social, economical, and labor realities of the time, and rose quickly to a short-lived prominence. It was created by the Committee of Fifty, which was a group of skilled workers who met to organize a resistance effort against lengthening their 10 hour work days.\n\n7) The United Tailoresses of New York strike, 1831\n\nIn June of 1831, 1,600 members of the United Tailoresses of New York struck for a wage equal to that of their male counterparts. There was some public support but, due to sexist views of women in the workplace, the strike was unsuccessful, and the women were forced to return to work in July of that year with no wage increase.\n\n8) New England Association of Farmers, Mechanics, and other Workingmen is Created, 1832\n\nThis association was created at a convention in Boston in February of 1832 which included representatives from Rhode Island, Boston, and Connecticut. They formed to advocate for a 10-hour work week, arguing that the reduction in their hours would improve conditions for laborers as it would allow them time to enjoy other interests and hobbies outside of work.\n\n9) Boston ship carpenters' ten-hour strike, 1832\n\nIn 1832, around 150 carpenters went on strike for a ten-hour workday. They were able to garner some support from other skilled workers. Despite this, half of them returned to work after 10 days and the ones who persisted were replaced. The proposal for a ten-hour workday was rejected.\n\n10) Shoebinder's protest in Lynn, Massachusetts, 1833\n\nAfter wage cuts, a group of shoebinders in Lynn organized the “Female Society of Lynn and vicinity for the protection and promotion of Female Industry.” This organization was established to protest for better wages and to prove their worth as artisans despite their gender.\n\n11) The first General Trades Union is formed by skilled workers in New York, 1833The General Trades Union brought together multiple smaller trade unions to better advocate for workers' rights. The first one was formed in New York in August of 1833. It included members of nine different trades.\n\n12) Lowell Mill Girls Strike, 1834\n\nIn February of 1834, 800 female textile workers in Lowell, Massachusetts went on strike due to a 15% wage reduction. The women stated that they would not go back to work unless their wages were restored and they were all rehired.\n\n13) Boston workers form their own General Trades Union, 1834\n\nTrade unions in Boston created their own General Trades’ Union, inspired by the formation of the New York General Trades’ Union. It is important to note that these General Trade Unions focused only on the rights of white male workers, excluding both women and people of color from their mission.\n\n14) General strike in Philadelphia for 10 hour workday, 1835\n\nTaking inspiration from the Boston Carpenters’ Strike of 1835, workers in Philadelphia began a general strike for higher wages and a 10-hour workday. Irish workers in the Schuylkill River coal docks, house painters, masons, blacksmiths, and more all joined the strike as part of the 10-hour workday movement.\n\n15) Second Paterson strike, 1835\n\nIn July of 1835, over 2,000 textile workers, mostly children and workers of Irish descent, went on strike again in Paterson, New Jersey. Their goal was a reduction in their hours, which at that time was 13 hours per day, six days a week. This strike was a relative success, as their workday was reduced to 12 hours during the week and 9 hours on Saturdays.\n\n16) The Factory Girls Association is formed by Lowell mill girls, 1836\n\nIn 1836, mill owners in Lowell, Massachusetts once again sought to cut wages increase rent for textile workers. 1,500 workers went on strike, and the women formed committees to provide strike assistance through the Factory Girls’ Association. The rent increase was revoked.\n\n17) National Cooperative Association of Cordwainers is formed, 1836\n\nThis association was formed in New York City and is credited as the first national trade union. It was created by a group of Cordwainers, who made leather shoes.\n\n18) Panic of 1837, 1837\n\nDuring the Panic of 1837, New York banks failed and unemployment reached an all-time high. The credit system collapsed, causing many businesses to fail. Over 250 businesses and/or merchants failed in New York, and industry greatly suffered.\n\n19) Ten-hour workday is established for Federal employees, 1840\n\nIn 1840 President Martin Van Buren passed an executive order which stated that all federal employees working on federal public work projects would be given a 10-hour workday without loss of pay.\n\n20) Commonwealth v. Hunt, 1842\n\nIn this landmark case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decided that labor unions are legal if they use legal means to achieve their goals. Until this ruling, such movements were illegal and often charged with “conspiracy.”\n\n21) State child labor laws updated, 1842\n\nIn 1842, Massachusetts limited children under 12 to 10 hours of work a day. The same year, Connecticut passed a 10-hour-day law for children under 14. Previously there had been laws requiring a certain amount of education to be given to working children, but these were the first to regulate the amount of time they could spend working.\n\n22) Frederick Douglass' Autobiography, 1845\n\nFrederick Douglass’ autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave Written by Himself, was published in 1845. This work, along with his newspaper the North Star, were part of a larger movement to end slavery and its role in American labor.\n\n23) The Lowell Female Labor Reform Association (LFLRA), 1845\n\nThe LFLRA was founded in 1845 and worked with other similar organizations to help women who worked in Lowell’s cotton mills. One of their major objectives was attaining a 10-hour workday. The women also sought better wages and living conditions in factory towns.\n\n24) Irish Potato Famine, 1845\n\nThe Irish Potato Famine, also known as The Great Hunger, began in the late summer of 1845 and lasted until 1852. Though it took place abroad, its effects rippled across the Atlantic to the US where many Irish people fled to escape starvation. This new group of poor immigrants became a source of workers that factories could draw from.\n\n25) Voice of Industry, 1845\n\nThe Voice of Industry was a worker-run newspaper that ran from 1845 to 1848. In 1845 the LFLRA used the Voice of Industry newspaper to gather 2000 signatures for a petition to the Massachusetts statehouse seeking reforms to women’s working and living conditions.\n\n26) 10 hour workday state laws passed, 1847\n\nNew Hampshire was the first state to establish the ten-hour workday. The state’s law, however, included a clause allowing workers to voluntarily agree to work longer. This was also included in Pennsylvania when they passed a similar law in 1848.\n\n27) Seneca Falls Convention, 1848\n\nAt this New York convention, about 300 men and women gathered to discuss women’s rights. Organized by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, this event laid the foundations for what would later become the organized women’s suffrage movement. Many proponents of workers' rights were present at the convention\n\n28) First strike fatalities in the United States, 1850\n\nTwo New York tailors were killed when police attempted to disperse a strike of garment workers. These deaths are considered to be the first strike fatalities in the United States.\n\n29) The Fugitive Slave Act, 1850\n\nPart of the Compromise of 1850, this act required that enslaved people be returned to their owners, even if they were in a free state. This was a step towards the Civil War and a crucial moment in the larger story of Black labor in the US.\n\n30) National Typographical Union, 1852\n\nThe National Typographical Union (later known as the International Typographical Union) was founded by fourteen printers’ associations who hoped to protect the wages, conditions, and skills of typographers while defending the freedom of the press.\n\n31) Erie Railroad strike, 1857\n\nOver 200 employees of the Erie Railroad company were dismissed for expressing their dislike for a wage decrease from $1 to .75 cents. The company attempted to replace the 200 workers with new ones, but the former employees armed themselves and refused to let the new people work. Volunteers and authorities were called to help manage the “rioters.”\n\n32) National Teachers Association (NTA) formed, 1857\n\nNow known as the NEA, the NTA was founded in 1857 when 10 state educational associations decided to “unite…to advance the dignity, respectability, and usefulness of their calling.”\n\n33) Panic of 1857, 1857\n\nThe Panic of 1857 was a financial crisis in the US brought on by both a decline in the international economy and the rapid growth of US territory. Because the global economy was more interconnected by the 1850s, this was the first worldwide economic crisis. American banks did not fully recover until after the Civil War.\n\n34) Iron Molders' Union of North America, 1859\n\nThis union was founded to represent craftsmen who cast wrought iron products. Prior to July 5, 1859, there were smaller independent groups of ironworkers, but the union sought to consolidate them into a national organization.\n\n35) Comstock Lode discovery, 1859\n\nIn the spring of 1859, a large channel of silver ore was discovered in a Nevada mountain range. This was the first major discovery of silver ore in the United States. A silver rush soon followed, and the site generated massive fortunes for many and also resulted in the creation of new mining technology.\n\n36) The Drake Well, 1859\n\nThe Drake Well, drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859, was the first oil well drilled in the United States. On August 27 it struck oil at 69 ½ feet into the earth. The success of this well foreshadowed a massive leap forward in industry and labor where petroleum would power industry.\n\n41) Founding of the National Labor Union, 1866\n\nThe National Labor Union was founded in Baltimore, Maryland and lobbied for a nationally recognized 8-hour workday for employees. The union was born at a meeting between the unions of coachmakers (manufacturers of horse-drawn carriages), mechanics, ironworkers, and blacksmiths. This call was not answered but was a starting point for changes in the labor system in the United States.\n\n42) Chinese railroad laborers strike, 1867\n\nChinese railroad laborers stopped work for 30 miles in California and demanded higher wages and a reduction of working hours. Working on the Central Pacific Railroad was dangerous for the laborers because of the tunnels that needed to be made in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This strike would not be successful due to the CPRR cutting off food and water to the labor camps but would still send a powerful message.\n\n43) 8-hour workday granted to Federal employees, 1868\n\nThe National Labor Union worked to grant select federal employees an eight-hour workday. This was a monumental achievement for labor laws. Unfortunately, because of their undefined mission, the National Labor Union ceased to exist by 1872.\n\n44) Creation of the National Colored Labor Union, 1869\n\nIn December of 1869, the National Colored Labor Union was formed in Washington, D.C., and proved significant for African American laborers. Although it would only last six years, the NCLU was the first of its kind and at its highest point had close to 540,000 members.\n\n45) Evaluation of child labor, 1872\n\nThe Prohibition Party was the first political party to establish a firm stance against the use of children in the workforce. This marked a new desire to address the use of children in the workplace and evaluate the dangers associated with working at such a young age.\n\n46) Coal Miners' Strike, 1873\n\nCoal miners in Tuscarawas Valley in Eastern Ohio and the Mahoning Valley in Eastern Pennsylvania struck for six months. The strike was triggered by a wage reduction of 15 cents for every ton. The Mahoning Valley strike lasted nine months in total and ended with the use of Swedish and Italian labor in the mines.\n\n47) Granite Mill fire, 1874\n\nA fire at the Granite Mill in Fall River, Massachusetts resulted in the deaths of 20 workers. The 20 laborers killed were mainly young girls, and one of the girls was reported to be only five years old. The dangers of child labor and generally poor working conditions were becoming more threatening to workers.\n\n48) \"Bloody Summer,\" 1875\n\nThe “Bloody Summer” of 1875 consisted of violence between groups of Irish and Welsh men over coal mining work in Eastern Pennsylvania. The Irish, also referred to as the “Mollie Maguires”, were accused of killing mine superintendents that admittedly favored the Welsh over the Irish and limited Irish employment options. A number of Irish men were later executed for their suspected involvement in the killings.\n\n49) Tuscarawas Valley riot, 1876\n\nThe Tuscarawas Valley experienced a number of coal miner strikes from 1873 to 1880. In 1876, a riot broke out in the Tuscarawas Valley. Several coal miners were arrested and jailed, and one miner was shot. The military was ordered to help break up the protesting laborers.\n\n50) Baltimore railroad riot, 1877\n\nRailroad employees in Baltimore, Maryland faced a considerable wage reduction of 10% and formed a violent mob. According to The Baltimore Sun, nine people were killed. The United States Army was called in to stop the rioting, and they did so in 3 days.\n\n51) \"Black Thursday,\" 1877\n\nA group of Irish Coal Miners known as the “Mollie Maguires” were executed on “Black Thursday” for their suspected involvement in the killing of coal mine managers. Those in charge of the mines did not give Irish workers employment but gave it to Welsh men instead.\n\n52) Formation of Amalgamated Labor Union, 1878\n\nIn 1878, the Amalgamated Labor Union was formed. It was made by former Knights of Labor who left to form their own group, showing the divide in the labor movement. The fight for better rights was not a unanimous one and different unions would create their own brand of what they believed workers deserved.\n\n53) Founding of Boston Cutters' Union, 1879\n\nIn 1879, the Boston Cutters’ Union was founded. Originally part of the Knights of Labor, it was one of the oldest unions for tailors and fought against long work hours and low wages. It would later become part of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, showing how unions were not static and changed and adapted with the times.\n\n54) Fall River mule spinner's strike, 1879\n\nFall River textile operatives struck for 17 weeks in order to secure higher wages. The lack of a strong union presence eventually led to the strike being called off as there was not significant financial support for the strikers. Later in the year, the workers would obtain a raise in wages.\n\n55) The Atlanta Washerwoman Rebellion, 1881\n\nDuring the summer of 1881, a group of African American women, led by Carrie Steele Logan, went on strike to demand that their workers receive fair treatment, higher wages, and control over organization of their work. The strike received backlash and threats from the local authorities, customers, and local businesses, but the women were steadfast and ultimately achieved their demands. The Atlanta Washerwoman Rebellion was one of the first recorded strikes involving African American women in the United States.\n\n56) Convention of Amalgamated Labor Union, 1881\n\nOn August 2, 1881, the Amalgamated Labor Union was meant to meet with the Knights of Industry, not to be confused with the Knights of Labor, for a convention. The goal of this convention was to come together and forge a single labor group to directly oppose the Knights of Labor. While this convention was cancelled and postponed, it does show how unions would directly challenge each other to achieve their own goals.\n\n57) Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions formed, 1881\n\nThe Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions was an organization formed to combat common grievances of workers of all different occupations and trades around the United States. Among these grievances were poor working conditions, low pay, long hours, and lack of bargaining rights for workers or union leaders. The movement was led by Samuel Gompers, an established labor leader who paved the way for the future of the American labor movement.\n\n58) First Labor Day parade in New York City, 1882\n\nOn September 5th, 1882, thousands of workers flocked to the streets of New York City to celebrate workers and their contributions to the United States. The parade, organized by the Central Labor Union, started at City Hall and finished at Union Square. Many trade and labor unions took place in the parade to show their support for the movement.\n\n59) The Bureau of Labor Statistics begins collecting employment data, 1884\n\nIn 1884 the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting data for a project studying employment. Two years later, the first report, a study on industrial impressions, was released from the bureau. Studies like these helped shed light on some of the wrongdoings and poor working environments that workers had to deal with.\n\n60) Cloak maker strike, 1885\n\nOn August 15, 1885, over 2,000 cloak makers went on strike. The group mostly came from sweatshops, and asked for $12-$15 a week. They also saw the event as a revolt that struck at the heart of labor issues at the time. The strike lasted two weeks, and the workers were able to obtain their new wages.\n\n61) The Great Southwest Railroad Strike, 1886\n\nThe Great Southwest Railroad Strike was spearheaded by the Knights of Labor after a KOL worker was fired for calling a union meeting. Workers throughout the Southwest burned railroad lines. In May of 1886, a Congressional committee advised the Knights of Labor to end the strike. The strike failed due to the collapse of the Knights of Labor.\n\n62) Failed general nationwide FOTLU strike, 1886\n\nOn May 1, 1886, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (FOTLU) planned a massive general strike involving all union members in the country. The goal of the strike was to achieve an eight-hour workday. However, this plan had mixed results, with some achieving an eight-hour workday, some failing, and some being forced to compromise for nine-hour days.\n\n63) May Day/International Workers Day, 1886\n\nBy May 1, 1886, the national demand for an eight-hour workday had increased, and hundreds of thousands of American workers joined the movement and the Knights of Labor. The nationwide demands for shortened hours are not met at this time.\n\n64) McCormick Harvesting Machine Company Strike, 1886\n\nThe McCormick Harvesting Machine Company Strike was led by August Spies, a German immigrant who edited the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. Spies spoke outside of the McCormick reaper plant in the West Side of Chicago. He urged workers to stand together and call for better labor conditions, working hours, and wages. This demonstration escalated the following day during the events of the infamous Haymarket Riot.\n\n65) Haymarket Riot, 1886\n\nA labor protest in Chicago’s Haymarket Square escalated into a riot after labor activists threw a bomb at police. Eight people died during the incident. The violence of the Haymarket Square Riot has been attributed to radical anarchists within the labor movement. Many viewed the violent event as a setback to the American labor movement.\n\n66) Bay View Massacre, 1886\n\nIn May of 1886, on the shores of Lake Michigan, 1,500 workers went on strike and marched towards the Bay View Rolling Mills. Armed militiamen ordered the crowds to stop 200 yards from the mill. They refused, causing the militiamen to fire into the crowd, killing seven persons. The incident is considered the bloodiest in Wisconsin’s labor history.\n\n67) The American Federation of Labor is founded, 1886\n\nThe American Federation of Labor was founded in 1886 as a craft union led by Samuel Gompers. The newly formed federation was seen as the successor to the other great labor unions of its time, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions and the Knights of Labor. The American Federation of Labor took a more moderate approach to labor activism, focusing less on group protests and social movements, and more on bargaining for better wages, working conditions, and other minor demands that could be achieved as a collective group.\n\n68) Anthracite Strike, 1887-1888\n\nMine workers in the Wyoming-Lackawanna Region of Pennsylvania went on strike in 1887 asking for a 15% pay increase to accommodate the high risk of injury in their profession. Mine workers in this region faced injury and death in mines. Those who were not injured often faced the effects of miner’s asthma during their lifetimes. The initial strike was unsuccessful but eventually the miners would achieve victory through the Miner’s and Laborer’s Amalgamated Association.\n\n69) Rahway, New Jersey shirt maker strike, 1887\n\nIn 1887, shirt makers in Rahway, New Jersey led a strike after their wages were cut. They were successful, and in turn, inspired shirt makers in New York to try and organize themselves.

In response to this, the Shoe Manufacturers' Association fired all of their employees and would not take any back until they cut all ties with the Knights of Labor. This standoff lasted for a month and a half before the plants opened back in December on company terms. This incident shows that while strikes were common during this time, they were not always successful.\n\n71) Thibodaux Massacre, 1887\n\nThe Thibodaux Massacre occurred on the heels of a three week long strike against the working conditions on Louisiana sugar cane plantations. The strike was led by the Knights of Labor and was the first strike within the sugar cane industry to be led by a formal organization. By the end of the Massacre, white regulators had killed or injured approximately 50 African American workers, some of whom were women and children.\n\n72) The United Hebrew Trades is founded, 1888\n\nOn October 9, 1888, the United Hebrew Trades (UHT) was founded to ensure Jewish workers had a trade union to fight for them. The UHT originally started in New York, and the idea for the organization came from the Jewish branch of the Socialist Labor Party. After many smaller and less successful Jewish unions, the UHT was a symbol of a new age and became involved in more successful strikes.\n\n73) Poole's Theatre Strike, 1889\n\nIn 1889, the owner of Poole’s Theater fired all unionized workers and replaced them with nonunion workers. In response to this, the actor's union, which was weak at the time, worked with the United Hebrew Trades to organize a strike that gained the support of ushers and other theater workers. However, due to infighting, the strike did not last long and was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n74) United Mine Workers of America is formed, 1890\n\nThe United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) was formed and consisted of the National Progressive Union of Miners and Mine Laborers and the Knights of Labor No. 135. UMWA President John Mitchell was influential in the establishment of the eight-hour workday, securing major victories for mine laborers across the nation. The foundation of the UMWA would also be the precursor to the Lattimer Massacre.\n\n75) Carpenters Union wins a shorter workday, 1890\n\nIn 1890 the Carpenters Union, led by established labor leader P.J. McGuire, went on strike to protest for shorter workdays. About 28,000 workers went on strike and it was deemed a success, as the workers were able to achieve an 8-hour workday. This event was particularly important because other labor unions took notice and began to make similar demands, leading to the eventual widespread establishment of the 8-hour workday.\n\n76) The Sherman Anti-Trust Act is passed, 1890\n\nThis piece of legislation stated that business activities that interfere with free-market competition are illegal. However, the law also gave the government the ability to interfere with and prevent union activities. The law was seen as a setback for labor unions around the United States\n\n82) Pullman Company Strike, 1894\n\nFactory workers at the Pullman Company formed a committee to attempt to negotiate for higher wages and better working conditions. The committee did not succeed, and as a result, a strike broke out at the Pullman Company factories. The strike caught the attention of many people and organizations around the country, including the American Railway Union (ARU), led by Eugene Debs. The ARU’s board voted to join the protest, and refused to send out trains carrying Pullman cars. The strike involved over 250,000 workers, and concluded with President Grover Cleveland sending the United States Military to Chicago in order to suppress the strike.\n\n83) Great Bituminous strike, 1897\n\nThe Great Bituminous Strike was organized by the United Mine Workers (UMW) in order to obtain a standard wage rate. The UMW sought to follow in the footsteps of the Knights of Labor, accepting anyone involved in coal mining work without discriminating based on skill, nationality, or race. The group managed to take a hostile and uncooperative group of laborers and bring them together to fight for their rights.\n\n84) Lattimer Massacre, 1897\n\nAfter the establishment of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), 10,000 union workers from Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania would strike for just over two months. The goal of the strike was to secure improved working conditions and wages. When strikers clashed with sheriff’s deputies, 19 strikers were killed, giving the event the name the Lattimer Massacre.\n\n85) CCF Agreement, 1897\n\nThis agreement marked not only the end of the Great Bituminous Strike of 1897 but also a victory for the United Mine Workers (UMW). Their demands for standardized wages and prices was a success and was a sign of the UMW’s potential and hope for other coal miner unions. This agreement is also seen as “the first truly industry and area-wide collective bargaining contract in US history” and would lead to other similar agreements.1\n\n86) Augusta Textile Mills strike, 1898\n\nThe Augusta Textile Mills strike sought improved working conditions and hours. The strike was peaceful, with over 4,000 workers leaving their posts to join the strike. The Mayor of Augusta spoke to the crowds, explaining that economic depression restricted them from meeting the demands of the workers. Despite the strike lasting nearly two months, few of the workers’ demands were met.\n\n87) Erdman Act is passed, 1898\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt signed the Erdman Act into law in an effort to regulate labor disputes in the railroad industry. The act sought arbitration from a mutual third party to help resolve conflicts and disputes that arose between railroad workers and railroad unionists. While the law was meant to help address the growing concerns and issues surrounding the ongoing labor movement, the act is generally viewed as ineffective.\n\n88) The United Textile Workers of America is founded, 1901\n\nThe United Textile Workers of America (UTW) was founded in 1901 in affiliation with the AFL. The majority of chapters of the UTW were in the North, where major textile locations such as Fall River, Massachusetts produced cotton products. The UTW would go on to help organize a major strike in 1934 as working conditions worsened due to the Great Depression.\n\n68) Anthracite Coal strike, 1902\n\nThe United Coal Workers of America decided to go on strike at the Anthracite coal mines in Pennsylvania to obtain higher wages and recognition of their union. This strike was quite effective, as the workers threatened to cut off the fuel supply to several major cities during the winter months. However, the strike ended after Theodore Roosevelt and the federal government stepped in to arrange a “square deal” that would benefit both sides.\n\n90) Jewish writer's strike, 1903\n\nIn 1903, Jewish newspaper writers came together to strike for better wages. They also demanded that the publishers only hire union writers. However, a lack of unity spelled the end not only for the strike, but the union at large. The writers would try again with and without unions to back them up, but they would be largely unsuccessful in their strikes.\n\n95) The Industrial Workers of the World is founded, 1905\n\nFounded as a radical labor union dedicated to organizing workers across industries and promoting class solidarity, the Industrial Workers of the World was one of the most notorious labor movements in history. Leaders of the group called for revolutionary industrial unionism and sought to unite all workers, regardless of skill, race, or gender, in a single, powerful labor organization. At the time, the IWW was the first organization to allow anyone to join, including people of color, women, and immigrants.\n\n96) First ever \"sit down\" strike, 1906\n\nThe first ever sit-down strike took place at the General Electric Plant located in Schenectady, New York. During the strike, more than 3,000 General Electric workers, all members of the IWW, sat and crossed their arms, refusing to work in protest against the discrimination faced by several of their coworkers. Even after management tried to intervene, the workers took control of machinery, making it impossible for the plant to run.\n\n97) Monongah Mine tragedy\n\nAn explosion at the Monongah Mines in West Virginia caused damage to mines 6 and 8. Many miners were killed instantly by the explosion, while others were trapped and died in the mines. This tragedy, the worst mining disaster the nation had ever seen, resulted in the death of 361 coal miners.\n\n98) Unorganized immigrant workers strike in McKees Rocks, PA, 1909\n\nBetween July 13th and September 8th, 1909, thousands of immigrant workers partook in a labor strike to protest for better working conditions and pay. These workers were not part of a union. Still, the strike was successful as the workers were able to achieve all of their demands.\n\n102) Triangle Waistcoat Factory fire in New York, 1911\n\nIn 1909, female employees unsuccessfully struck for better safety conditions in the factory. Two years later, a fire started on the eighth floor of the Triangle Waistcoat Factory. Executives on the tenth floor were immediately notified, but workers on the ninth floor were not. Supervisors left only one door unlocked, fire truck ladders were not tall enough to reach the ninth floor, and there was only one weak fire escape which eventually collapsed due to the women’s attempts to escape. 146 people lost their lives in the fire, and it drew attention to poor industrial working conditions, especially the lack of fire safety.\n\n103) Bread and Roses strike, 1912\n\nIn 1912, Massachusetts passed a law to shorten the workweek from 56 hours to 54 hours. To compensate for the lost two hours, factory owners in Lawrence, Massachusetts decreased wages and sped up production. In response, 25,000 immigrant textile mill workers, mostly women, went on strike. After a congressional hearing recognized the poor working conditions, the factory owners were forced to negotiate, and reached an acceptable compromise in March.\n\n104) Massachuestts passes the first minimum wage law, 1912\n\nMassachusetts passed the first law requiring companies to pay their employees a standard minimum wage, although it only applied to women and children. The act set no standard wage but instead created a survey to study complaints of low wages.\n\n105) New York City hotel strike, 1912\n\nThe strike began when about 300 servers at the restaurant in the Hotel Belmont walked out on May 7, 1912. By May 24, the strike had spread to many other hotels in the city and included all types of hotel staff. The International Hotel Workers Union issued ten demands for the Hotel Men’s Association, made up of the corporate hotel owners, seeking better wages, working conditions, time off, and recognition of the union. On June 14 the Hotel Men’s Association voted to accept all the demands except to recognize the union. The union then voted to end the strike on June 25, 1912.\n\n106) Paterson Silk Mill strike, 1913\n\nLocated along the Passaic River in New Jersey, Paterson was known as “Silk City” because of the large amount of silk its mills produced. The Henry Doherty plants upgraded the silk looms, which were now advanced enough to allow a single worker to attend to 3 or 4 looms at a time. This increase in work caused 800 loom workers, supported by the Industrial Workers of the World, to go on strike. The strike, which peaked at 24,000 people, demanded a return to the 2-loom system, an 8-hour workday, wage increases, and hiring more employees to decrease workload. The owners held out and by the end of May the strikers went back to work with no progress made.\n\n107) The Michigan Copper strike, 1913\n\nThe Michigan Copper district refused to acknowledge the Western Federation of Miners, causing them to go on strike on June 22, 1913. During a Christmas party for the strikers and their families, someone yelled “fire” causing a panic which led to the death of 72 people, mostly children. The companies granted some of their demands, although they refused to recognize the union.\n\n119) Boston Police strike, 1919\n\nFrom September 9th to September 13th, 1919, the Boston police force went on strike, demanding better pay, working conditions, and the right to unionize. Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge refused to negotiate, dismissed the striking officers, and deployed the National Guard to calm the situation. This event had a lasting impact on the labor movement and the political atmosphere in the United States.\n\n120) Great Steel strike, September 22, 1919-January 8, 1920\n\nAfter dealing with high productivity demands all throughout World War 1, several unions involved in the steel industry organized a nationwide strike to happen in September of 1919. US Steel, the largest employer in the steel industry, refused to acknowledge unions. On September 22, 350,000 workers walked out across 6 states. The strike was ultimately crushed through violence by the police and individuals hired by the company, ending on January 8, 1920.\n\n121) The Battle of Matewan\n\nIn the spring of 1920, coal miners in Mingo County, West Virginia, went on strike due to poor working conditions. Coal operators refused to compromise with the union and hired Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency (BFDA) to evict strikers and their families from company housing. When County Sheriff Hatfield and Mayor Testerman demanded warrants for the evictions, BFDA executive Albert Felts was unable to produce them, and lied about recieving a court order for the evictions. The altercation turned violent, and seven BFDS guards and two townspeople were killed, including Albert Felts.\n\n122) New England Textile Strike, 1922\n\nIn 1922, mill owners in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, cut wages and increased the work week, causing textile workers to go on strike. The strike quickly spread throughout the Blackstone River Valley, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, with 60,000-80,000 mill workers on strike, of which about 60% were women and children. The state militia was called out in Rhode Island and other heavily policed areas, leading to violence and deaths. In Rhode Island, the strike ended in September, but it continued longer in New Hampshire. Most owners reverted to the original wages before the cuts, but there was more hesitation about reducing the work week.\n\n123) Herrin Massacre, 1922\n\nOn June 21 and 22, 1922, fighting broke out between strikebreakers recruited from Chicago and UMW strikers on their way to the mines. Both parties exchanged fire and 4 people were killed. When around sixty laborers exited the mines and marched into town the next day, union men opened fire, killing 21 and leaving many injured. Prosecutors issued over 214 indictments, but most were dropped.\n\n124) Great Railroad Strike of 1922, 1922\n\nDespite the post-WWI economic boom, railroad maintenance worker pay was cut by 12%, leading to a nationwide railway strike which began on July 1, 1922. 400,000 railroad workers left their jobs across the country. National Guard troops were called in to control riots, and strikers began to use bombs to damage facilities. As a result, Congress passed the Daughtery Injunction, a federal court order prohibiting striking, assembling, picketing, and other union activities. Ten people died during the strike, and the strike led to a loss of millions of dollars and long-lasting bitterness and tension.\n\n125) San Pedro maritime strike, 1923\n\nOn April 25, 1923, the International Workers of the World called a strike at the San Pedro docks in Los Angeles, California, to protest poor working conditions, low wages, and the firing and arrest of union workers. The LAPD banned public meetings, and on May 14th arrested strikers at their meeting place, which they named Liberty Hill. The Ku Klux Klan also played a role in terrorizing the strikers. The strike ended on May 24th and, with none of their demands met, many workers remained in jail or left the city to find new work.\n\n126) Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters founded, 1925\n\nIn 1925, the Pullman Porters founded the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. The Pullman Company introduced sleeping cars on railways as a luxurious experience for wealthy travelers, and Black Americans were hired in large numbers to cater to these cars. The American Railway Union did not accept Black members, so the Pullman Porters founded a union of their own.\n\n127) Passaic Textile strike, January 25, 1926-March 1, 1927\n\nWool and silk mill workers in Passaic, New Jersey, mobilized in response to a 10% wage cut, and also demanded time and a half for overtime, decent sanitary conditions, no discrimination against union members, and recognition of the union. On March 1, 2,000 strikers gathered in protest and were met by police with clubs, tear gas, and freezing fire hoses. Within two months, nine mills in the area were on strike, amounting to about 15,000 strikers, who continued to face police violence. The mills granted most of their demands and the strike ended on March 1, 1927, despite the fact that mill owners violated the agreement shortly after, firing many of the newly rehired workers.\n\n128) Fur Workers strike, 1926\n\nThe Fur and Leather Workers Union called a strike of 12,000 workers in New York City. The picketers were met with violence, including the use of clubs and police vehicles being driven into the crowd. On March 13th, the first company settled with the strikers, making them the first workers to win the 40-hour work week. The strike continued for many and expanded to include other unions in the city who were fighting for the 40-hour work week, and by June 11th, the employers agreed to their demands.\n\n129) Railway Labor Act, 1926\n\nThe Railway Labor Act details the required procedures for railroad workers to go on strike. These procedures require negotiations involving the National Mediation Board prior to any action. The railways were and are a very important party of the supply chain and public transportation, and rail strikes had the potential to impact many different industries, creating the need for this act.\n\n130) Columbine Mine Massacre, 1927\n\nAfter being on strike for three weeks, miners in the northern Colorado Columbine mine were met with extreme violence. A crowd of 200-600 picketers were shot at by the Colorado State Police. Six miners were killed and twenty others were wounded.\n\n131) Loray Mill strike, 1929\n\nIn Gastonia, North Carolina, 1,800 mill workers went on strike demanding improved working conditions, a forty-hour workweek, a minimum wage of $20 a week, and recognition of their union.

The strike was unsuccessful, and many strikers found themselves blacklisted from area mills.\n\n132) Davis-Bacon Act, 1931\n\nThe Davis-Bacon Act gave the Department of Labor the responsibility to determine minimum wage for public laborers through federal regulations. The act oversaw the enforcement of these labor standards and funded supporting projects. The act has since been amended multiple times at the demand of labor unions.\n\n133) Century Airlines pilots strike, 1932\n\nThe Century Airlines Pilots Strike, considered to be the first strike among commercial airline pilots in the United States, took place over two months in 1932. The strike began when Century Airline owner Errett Lobban Cord cut wages by nearly 40%. The pilots, all members of the Air Line Pilots Association, formed various committees to speak with Cord about better working conditions, but only managed to speak with him once. Cord sent armed guards with resignation letters to the pilots, which they refused to sign. The strike was unsuccessful, as all of the pilots were replaced.\n\n134) National Industrial Recovery Act, 1933\n\nPassed by Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, the National Industrial Recovery Act intended to help facilitate economic recovery and benefit workers. The act enforced industrial self-regulation while giving employees the ability to collectively organize and bargain. NIRA was ruled as unconstitutional in May of 1935, and demonstrate Congress and big business’ unwillingness to support labor innovation.\n\n135) Minneapolis Teamsters strike, 1934\n\nIn 1934, Minneapolis truck drivers went on strike, demanding recognition of the union, wage increases, and shorter working hours. Violence quickly broke out between police and unarmed strikers, and the governor of Minnesota declared martial law and sent in about 4,000 soldiers to control the situation. The strikers achieved most of their demands, and the strike contributed to the passage of the National Labor Relations Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\n136) Woonsocket strike, 1934\n\nIn Woonsocket, Rhode Island, approximately 8,000 textile workers, most of whom were women, went on strike against local mill owners.

After four days, federal troops were used to forcibly end the strike.\n\n137) The National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) passed, 1935\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act, better known as the Wagner Act, is a landmark piece of legislation that guarantees workers’ rights to organize unions and petition for better wages and working conditions. The Act established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to oversee the unions and labor rights issues, strengthening the position of labor unions across the country, and marking a major shift in labor relations which empowered workers and promoted a fundamental right for many laborers.\n\n138) General Motors sit-down strike, December 30, 1936-February 11, 1937\n\nThe General Motors (GM) strike was one of the most significant labor disputes in American history. The strike involved thousands of workers from the General Motors factories in Flint, Michigan, who demanded better wages, working conditions and a union. The sit-down strike was very effective for their demonstration as it had immobilized GM’s production. The strike ended with the recognition of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) which helped many factory workers achieve better pay and conditions across the United States.\n\n139) The Flint sit-down strike, December 30, 1936-February 11, 1937\n\nThe 1936-1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike was a pivotal event in American labor history. It involved workers at General Motors factories in Flint, Michigan, conducting a sit-down strike, demanding better wages, working conditions, and recognition of the United Automobile Workers (UAW) Union. The strike disrupted General Motors’ production and forced the company to negotiate with the workers. Ultimately, the strike ended with GM recognizing the UAW, marking a significant victory for the labor movement and leading to improved conditions for industrial workers across the United States.\n\n140) Little Steel strike, 1937\n\nThe Little Steel Strike involved steel workers, particularly those employed by smaller steel companies, hence the name ‘Little Steel.’ The strike was in response to low wages, poor working conditions, and the lack of recognition for unions. Violence ensued between strikers and company-hired private military forces, resulting in injury and death, and strikers were able to achieve their demands five years later using legal action, not striking.\n\n141) The Memorial Day Massacre, 1937\n\nOn May 30, 1937, striking steelworkers who were part of the Little Steel Strike in Chicago and their families gathered for a peaceful march near the Republic Steel plant. Tensions escalated, and police opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, killing ten and injuring many more. The Memorial Day Massacre highlighted violent tactics used by corporations and law enforcement against striking workers and was in many ways symbolic of the broader struggle for workers’ rights during the labor movement of the 1930s.\n\n142) The Wages and Hours Act (Fair Labor Standards Act) passed, 1938\n\nThe Wages and Hours Act was a landmark piece of legislation in the United States. It established the federal minimum wage, prohibited child labor, and mandated overtime pay for certain workers.

Its passage marked a significant milestone in labor reform.\n\n143) The Chrysler Auto strike, 1939\n\nThe 1939 Chrysler Auto Strike was a major labor dispute involving workers at Chrysler Corporation factories. The strike was sparked by demands for wage increases, improved working conditions, and union recognition by the United Automobile Workers (UAW). Lasting from February to April 1939, the strike saw significant tensions between workers and management and clashes with law enforcement. The strike ultimately ended with Chrysler agreeing to many of the workers' demands, solidifying the UAW's position in the auto industry and contributing to broader gains for organized labor in the United States.\n\n144) Supreme Court rules that sit-down strikes are illegal, 1939\n\nOn February 27, 1939, the Supreme Court ruled that sit-down strikes are illegal. Sit-down strikes, which involved sitting down within the manufacturing plant and refusing to work, were used as a less violent method of striking, and became especially popular in the 1930s when increased automation meant that workers could quickly stop all production in a factory. In response to the 1936 General Motors Sit Down Strike, which had a major impact on appliance production in the United States, the Supreme Court ruled they are illegal.\n\n145) Ford Motor strike, 1941\n\nDespite several previous strikes, including at General Motors and Chrysler, Ford Motor Company still refused to recognize the United Auto Workers (UAW). In April 1941, eight union members were fired by Ford’s head of security, and as a result, all workers left the factory and barricaded the entrance. After 10 days of striking and a rise in racial tensions between white and Black workers, Ford signed a contract which recognized the unionization of his workers.\n\n146) Fair Employment Practices Commission founded, 1941\n\nThe Fair Employment Practices Commission was founded in 1943 to help implement Executive Order 8802, which banned all employment discrimination based on race. The order’s execution and enforcement led to increased employment of African Americans, though many of the jobs were skilled and poorly paid.\n\n147) Meat Packer's strike of 1946\n\nThe United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA) and the Amalgamated Meat Cutters organized a strike of 93,000 packinghouse workers, hoping to obtain wage increases. This halted all production in the industry, and as a result, on January 24 President Truman ordered the government to seize all packing plants, claiming they were essential to the war effort. The Amalgamated Meat Cutters ended their strike and accepted the offer of a 15 cent per hour raise, while the UPWA held out a bit longer, and received a raise of 16 cents per hour.\n\n148) The Railraod strike of 1946\n\nOn May 18th, 1946, several railway unions planned a railroad walkout. The day before the planned strike, President Truman signed Executive Order 9727, which allowed the government to seize and operate the railroads. The strike began on May 22, after failed negotiations with the White House, and caused massive supply chain disruptions and the decade’s worst car traffic. On May 24th, Truman threatened to use the army as strikebreakers, and as a result, the strikers accepted a 16 cent per hour wage increase the next day.\n\n168) Southern Tenant Farmers' Union dissolution, 1974\n\nIn 1974, the Southern Tenant Farmers’ Union dissolved due to internal conflict and external pressure. Changing societal dynamics and internal divisions contributed to the decline of the union.\n\n169) Atlanta sanitation workers go on strike, 1977\n\nIn 1973, Atlanta, Georgia elected its first African American mayor, Maynard Jackson, who had a reputation for advocating for Black city workers. Despite his election, sanitation workers still faced intermittent unjustified layoffs, and went on strike in 1977 to obtain a 50-cent hourly wage increase. Jackson resisted the strike and fired over 900 workers, and within a month the rest of the striking workers returned to work.\n\n170) New York City goes three months without its three top newspapers, 1978\n\nOn August 9, 1978, New York City’s three primary newspapers—The Times, the Daily News, and the New York Post—announced they would unilaterally reduce their respective work staffs. In protest, local newspaper union members walked out the next day, and for 88 whole days, none of the three newspapers would publish an edition, effectively suspending the news industry in the nation’s largest city. This means there are no reports from the city’s biggest and most popular newspapers on the Yankees’ 1978 World Series victory (or their famous late-season comebacks against the Red Sox)! On November 6, management and the unions agreed that the newspapers could not fire swaths of their respective staffs at once, but instead could do so gradually. Neither side considered the agreement a win.\n\n171) Congress passes the Airline Deregulation Act, 1978\n\nOn October 24, 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act, which abolished the previous system that gave the Civil Aeronautics Board, a division of the federal government, regulatory power over the airline industry. Now that airlines ran privately, new airlines formed, competition increased, fares lowered, and ticket sales soared, but air traffic congestion increased. When a recession hit at the end of the decade, the airlines which had expanded proved to be poorly financed, and many went out of business. The airlines that survived are the ones we know best today: American, United, Delta, and Southwest.\n\n172) Politically-charged Coors strikes end with union's dissolution, 1978\n\nFor more than a decade prior, labor unions had boycotted and struck against Coors Brewing Company over its ownership’s endorsements of politically conservative causes. The brewery’s discriminatory hiring practices against minorities such as Hispanics and members of the LGBTQ community were among the primary causes for union protest. In December of 1978, Local 366, the union most involved in the strike, was decertified, which was a victory for Coors. Despite this, the boycotts continued, especially on the West Coast, and throughout the 1980s Coors made efforts to extend its marketing to minority groups.\n\n173) Boston University faculty goes on strike, 1979\n\nIn the middle of the spring semester of 1979, much of the faculty of Boston University went on strike demanding higher salaries and an increased role in the college’s administrative affairs. The campus was like a ghost town, as no one knew whether classes would resume. On April 13, BU’s president John Silber agreed to their demands. This was the first professors’ strike at a major university in American history and served as a source of inspiration for teachers represented by education unions nationwide.\n\n174) UAW strikes against International Harvester, 1979\n\nIn August of 1979, members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union began negotiations to amend a variety of work rules, especially involving overtime, with International Harvester (IH), a manufacturer of commercial and agricultural machinery. When the talks did not go well, UAW workers stopped going to work, causing millions of dollars in losses to IH, whose negotiators were often criticized for their inexperience and ineffectiveness. By April of 1980, IH gave in to the demands of the UAW, whose negotiators called their success an “overwhelming victory.”\n\n175) Hollywood goes on strike, 1980\n\nWith the recent emergence of home video and TV markets, actors of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) wanted imbursements from sales in the new entertainment distribution markets. The following year, they would strike again for similar demands. The familiar faces that graced the screens of TV boxes and movie theaters throughout America would go on to win in both efforts—and even gain higher general wages.\n\n176) The summer without baseball, 1981\n\nNot yet accustomed to the recently strengthened players’ union, Major League Baseball team owners failed to present a satisfying Basic Agreement to the MLB Players’ Association, causing the players, represented by Marvin Miller, on June 12 to refuse to continue the season. Fans would have to wait until August for Pete Rose’s record-claiming 3,361st hit. On July 31, with changes to free agency rules, the players agreed to play ball once again. To this day, 1981 remains the only year in which the MLB season was split into two halves.\n\n177) The PATCO strike, 1981\n\nIn early August of 1981, 12,000 members of PATCO went on strike seeking a 32-hour work week, a $10,000 pay raise, and better retirement plans. Though rarely enforced, a 1955 law banned such federal strikes. Calling it a “peril to national safety,” newly-elected President Ronald Reagan ordered them to return to work in 48 hours and fired and replaced the 11,000 who did not after time had run out. Shortly thereafter, the Federal Labor Relations Authority decertified the union. This event, often considered the most important labor strike of the era, sent a stark message to labor unions under the new presidential administration: that the government would not tolerate the ceasing of federal operations.\n\n178) Brown and Sharpe Manufacturing workers embark on 15-year legal battle, 1981\n\nIn late October of 1981, one third of Brown and Sharpe Tool Manufacturing’s 4,500 North Kingstown employees went on strike to challenge recent job transfers and poor pension plans. The second-largest private employer in Rhode Island, Brown and Sharpe had been outsourcing to Japan for a number of years prior to the union’s action. As the strike continued into the next year, state police fought with picketers, even going as far as to use tear gas on them. Workers soon returned to work, but the union’s pleas continued in court until 1998 when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal on the National Labor Relations Board’s rejection of the union’s attempt to prove the company had illegally forced the strike.\n\n179) Cartoon animators go on strike, 1982\n\nIn 1982, Hollywood animators went on strike, protesting the outsourcing of animation work overseas to Japan and South Korea. As a result, many cartoon series had to delay air dates scheduled for the fall. In the end, studios failed to cede to animators’ demands, resulting in the decline of American animation companies like Hanna-Barbera and the rise of ones based in foreign countries.\n\n180) NFL season cut short by striking players, 1982\n\nOnly a week into the 1982 NFL season, players announced a strike to protest, among other grievances, owners’ tight control. America would go without its beloved autumn sport until the middle of November when an agreement was made to increase players’ minimum wages and contractual benefits. The League ended up reducing the season to nine games, but the playoffs were significantly expanded to include sixteen teams instead of the usual twelve.\n\n181) The Great Arizona Copper Miners' Strike begins, 1983\n\nIn the summer of 1983, copper miners in southeastern Arizona embarked on a three-year-long strike when the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the mine owner, stopped guaranteeing periodic collective bargaining meetings with mining unions. During the strike, the miners, who were primarily Mexican, advocated for improved wages and a ceasing of layoffs after recent copper devaluations forced the company to reduce its operations.The strike came to an end in 1986 when unions ceded to Phelps Dodge’s demands.\n\n182) First Greyhound bus drivers' strike begins, 1983\n\nMembers of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) across the country went on strike to protest pay cuts, which Greyhound Bus Lines determined were necessary due to increased competition, especially with the airline industry. When the company replaced the strikers with untrained drivers, picketers got violent, delaying running buses by breaking their headlights and bombarding scabs and strikebreakers with eggs and empty beer bottles. The ATU gave in to Greyhound’s demands as Christmas approached, and the following year the company would begin laying off much of its workforce.\n\n183) The Pan American World Airways strike, 1985\n\nOn February 28, 1985, unionized workers from Pan American World Airways began walkouts to protest a labor agreement that failed to satisfy their demands for better pay. A month later, tough negotiations forced the unions to settle with a contract similar to that which had caused the strike in the first place. After what proved to be a difficult decade for the transportation industry’s relations with labor unions, Pan Am would go on to cease operations six years later.\n\n184) The Hormel strike begins, 1985\n\nDuring the recession of the early 1980s, Hormel Foods Corporation, a food processing company, cut wages and failed to improve working conditions. In protest, many workers from local unions around the company’s headquarters in Minnesota went on strike, though the parent union, United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), did not support it. To maintain the workforce, Hormel hired non-union replacement workers who were mainly Mexican migrants, causing a rift in the community. In the fall of 1986, the local unions agreed to a new contract with Hormel, but only about 20% of workers regained their jobs.\n\n189) Railway workers strike and the President responds, 1992\n\nFor two days, unionized workers represented by the International Association of Machinists went on strike when CSX Transportation, a railroad company, ignored pay demands. Rail lines across the country ceased operations, resulting in $1 billion in losses to the national economy as industries reliant on the efficiency of the railroads could not sustain their own operations. Only two days passed before President George H.W. Bush signed a bill passed through Congress that banned the strike and forced unions and companies to make a deal immediately. Though most union leaders consider the law unfair, the event serves as a stark reminder of the importance of the railroads in seemingly unrelated sectors of the United States’ economy.\n\n190) Eroding labor movement welcomes first contested election since 1970s, 1995\n\nAround Labor Day of 1995, the Providence Journal reflected on the decline of the labor movement in the United States. At one time, many of the nation’s workers had strong unions to fight for them, but such support had dwindled when factories introduced automation and manufacturers outsourced jobs abroad. Despite this, the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest federation of trade unions, began holding elections to contest the presidency of Thomas R. Donahue, whose term had just surpassed the 15-year mark. In the fall of 1995, insurgent John Sweeney would defeat Donahue and serve as the AFL-CIO president until 2009.\n\n191) General Electric strike, 2003\n\nAlmost 20,000 employees went on strike at forty-eight General Electric plants to protest the company's plan to increase the cost of healthcare benefits for current and retired G.E. workers. The strike, which spanned over 33 states, lasted two days and successfully ended with a resolution that protected G.E. workers against the proposed increase in healthcare costs.\n\n192) Broadway musicians' strike, 2003\n\nOver 1000 Broadway musicians, actors, and stagehands from various unions went on strike after a failure to agree by producers and musicians regarding minimum contract requirements and downsizing orchestras. The strike caused all Broadway musicals to shut down and significantly impacted New York City's economy. The New York City Mayor intervened, and both parties reached a mutual agreement four days later, restoring NYC’s Broadway Industry.\n\n193) Southern California supermarket strike, 2003-2004\n\nOver 70,000 Californian supermarket workers from four supermarket chains went on strike against plans that proposed to reduce workers’ healthcare benefits. The strike lasted four months and, although ultimately settled, significantly impacted the state's economy. Additionally, the strike resulted in Kroger Co. being indicted on felony charges and being fined 70 million for violating labor laws and hiring workers while negotiating with the union.\n\n194) NHL lockout, 2004-2005\n\nThe labor lockout of the National Hockey League was a 10-month-long strike that resulted in the cancelation of the 88th season. The strike resulted from the failure to reach new collective bargaining agreements between the league and the NHL Players' Association. The strike canceled over 1000 games and had a significant economic impact on league cities. A resolution was eventually met ten months later, leading to contract agreements, player policies, and game rule changes.\n\n195) General Motors strike, 2007\n\nThe two-day strike resulted from failed labor contract negotiations between G.M. and the United Auto Workers union. Over 73,000 workers protested, resulting in a pause in operations in over 80 facilities. The strike significantly impacted G.M.'s production and supply chains internationally. The parties eventually reached a deal, and the strike inspired the UAW to initiate labor contract agreements with other manufacturers, such as Ford and Chrysler."
