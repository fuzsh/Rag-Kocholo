        "text": "Lindsey Miller, Founder\n\nLindsey is a Greensboro, AL native and the daughter of a catfish farming family. She also comes from a long background in the startup landscape of the Magic City—starting her career with Zoe’s Kitchen. Lindsey was a key player in growing the company from a family-owned business to ringing the bell after the company went public in 2014, including serving as CFO during the private equity exit in 2007. After 13 years, Lindsey left her most recent post as Director of Operations for over 40 units in the Southeast and resigned to make her mark on the Alabama business landscape.\n\nIn early 2018, she founded Mpire Consulting & Bookkeeping. She has acted as a key investor and partner in several real estate investment companies for the past four years, and is part of the ownership and leadership team of Birmingham start-up Campesino Rum. Most notably, she is the co-founder of Battle Republic, a unique and outstanding boxing inspired fitness concept with two locations. She was listed as a Woman of Impact for 2021 by Yellowhammer News. Lindsey now resides in Leeds with her partner, Philip, and their baby girl, Miller. She is a self-proclaimed bougie redneck that would have a hard time picking between a Miller Lite and a Cali Pinot Noir.\n\nRebecca Hargraves, President & Co-owner\n\nWhen it comes to an eye for the financial details—Rebecca’s your girl. She gained a Bachelor of Science and Business Administration plus a Master of Accounting at The University of Alabama. After school, she sat for and passed the CPA exam. Yeh. She is a baddie. Rebecca worked as the Director of Accounting for RxBenefits, Inc. before joining Mpire. Her career includes stints at BCBS, Walter Energy, and Warren Averett as well.\n\nRebecca’s specialties include building processes, implementing process improvements, auditing financials for accuracy, and finding a way to always get things done. A fun fact about her is that she got to do health and safety audits in coal mines in Tuscaloosa (brave lady). And while Rebecca wears all these hats, she is a wife, a mama to her daughter who attends VHHS, and owns an undisclosed number of cats, dogs, fish, etc.\n\nCheryl miller, financial ops manager\n\nCheryl is a native of Linden, AL, where she served as City Clerk from 1983-1991. She currently resides in Greensboro, AL, where she has been running the financial side of her family farming business since 1986. As someone who loves to be busy, she is also Mpire’s resident Quickbooks, sales tax, and all things State- of-Alabama-expert. She is also our queen of cleaning up and catching up books for new clients. Cheryl has been keeping the books for the Hale County Soil and Water Conservation Office since 2011 and is a statewide Quickbooks trainer for her peers. She’s also a co-owner of The Stable restaurant back home.\n\nCheryl has 4 daughters, 3 grandbabies, and an amazing group of girlfriends called “The Barn Babes.”\n\nLauren fuqua, financial ops manager\n\nLauren is a native of Greensboro, AL. and currently resides in Tuscaloosa with her husband, Evan, and two boys. Prior to coming to Mpire, Lauren has a long background in the law office world. She started as a legal assistant at Gilmore, Rowley, Crissey & Wilson in 2012. She quickly moved into a right hand of the partners and a key player for the firm. Her responsibilities ranged from drafting legal documents and correspondence to the handling of AR, AP, and all administrative support for the firm. These skill sets have made her a perfect fit for Mpire and benefit our clients greatly.\n\nFun facts: Lauren is a twin, a baseball mama, and has a dog named Saban."
