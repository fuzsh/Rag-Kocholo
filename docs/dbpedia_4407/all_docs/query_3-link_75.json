        "text": "Each Challenge season has three parts: the Robot Game, the Innovation Project, and the FIRST Core Values. Teams in the United States and Canada may recruit 2 to 10 interested team members ages 9 to 14 or in the 4-8 grade. A coach is allowed to coach multiple teams. Each team must have at least 2 adult coaches. Once you have a team (you do not need all team member names yet), you may register. Challenge is available as an individual team or Class Pack.\n\nClass Pack is a non-competitive implementation option for classrooms or after-school programs and provides educators and communities with flexible, high-quality STEM learning experiences for students. Learn about purchasing a FIRST LEGO League Challenge Class Pack.\n\nGather support resources\n\nFamiliarize yourself with FIRST LEGO League by checking out the materials on our website and social media pages. Then locate your region’s Program Delivery Partner or FIRST Senior Mentor. These people know the FIRST teams, participating schools, and FIRST-friendly businesses in your area. They can help you form a plan for getting your team funded, organized, and in touch with other teams in the area.\n\nContact Local Support\n\nFIRST LEGO League Explore - How it Works\n\nFIRST LEGO League Challenge - How it Works\n\nStart a FIRST LEGO League Explore Team flyer\n\nStart a FIRST LEGO League Challenge Team flyer\n\nEnlist Coaches and Mentors\n\nEach FIRST LEGO League team needs two adult lead coaches. All skill levels are welcomed and needed, technical or non-technical. Teams need all kinds of skills and creativity to succeed. The most successful coaches are people with at least an interest in science and technology, and in helping kids discover and learn!\n\nFIRST Mentor/Coach Checklist\n\nRegister and Pay\n\nOnce registered, your team becomes a part of the worldwide FIRST LEGO League community. You’ll begin receiving communications from FIRST, along with a temporary team number in preparation for event registration in the fall. Part of the registration process includes completing payment for registration and ordering the season materials. (Please note that, until you secure registration, you are not committed to becoming a team.)\n\nTo create your team register/login to your FIRST account dashboard. From your account dashboard, click “Create New Team(s)” to start your team's registration and view our Dashboard Tutorial for a step-by-step walkthrough of the process.\n\nFIRST LEGO League Explore Pricing & Payment\n\nFIRST LEGO League Challenge Pricing & Payment\n\nBuild your team\n\nFind and invite youth team members who want to be part of a robotics team (the easiest part!). Be sure to emphasize that no technical skills are required, just enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. All youth team members are required to have a completed youth registration application and a signed Consent and Release form on an annual basis."
