        "text": "“Teamwork makes the dream work.”\n\nYou’ve likely heard this quotation quite a few times, but it isn’t the whole story. In his 2002 book Teamwork Makes the Dream Work, John C. Maxwell actually wrote, “Teamwork makes the dream work, but a vision becomes a nightmare when the leader has a big dream and a bad team.”\n\nTeamwork is all about working together towards a shared goal. But Maxwell writes that a team is only as successful as the leadership behind it, and encouraging a team to collaborate is difficult under weak leadership that doesn’t support the shared vision. Some employees might be reluctant to work with others or fail to see the importance of teamwork at all.\n\nKnowing what makes a good team can help you create a supportive environment, give everyone the tools they need to succeed, and give every team member a voice.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of having teams?\n\nA team brings together individual workers with diverse but complementary skill sets.\n\nThis means that everyone uses their differing strengths to shepherd a project toward completion, whether that’s coding a new app, collaborating with clients, or brainstorming ideas for the company’s next rebrand. Working together creates a better outcome than working individually because it involves more people with more strengths.\n\nOn healthy teams, team members value one another’s contributions. They recognize their own skill gaps and support the people around them as they work together to reach a team goal. Instead of struggling through difficult tasks by themselves, they play to each other’s strengths and organize work in a way that makes sense for everyone.\n\nBut teamwork is about more than productivity. On average, people spend over 13 years of their lifetime at work, and creating a supportive, team-oriented workplace environment can make those years the best they can be.\n\nCompetent teams have mentoring opportunities, build team members’ confidence, and develop mutual respect between everyone involved, improving team performance and fostering a better culture.\n\nWhat makes a good team?\n\nSometimes, teamwork just doesn’t work. According to one survey, 86% of people say a lack of collaboration and communication caused their workplace failures. A weak team that doesn’t know how to collaborate effectively can lead to information silos and hostile work environments.\n\nDeveloping a good, collaborative team takes hard work and active cultivation, both from leaders and members. Here are some characteristics of an effective team:\n\nThere’s camaraderie throughout the team, and members share healthy bonds both inside and outside the office\n\nEveryone works together to resolve conflicts and problem-solve quickly, putting their egos aside\n\nTeam members practice active listening when their coworkers speak or share ideas\n\nThe team employs productive and respectful internal communication strategies\n\nManagers include the team in the decision-making process and listen to individual input\n\nPeople feel comfortable taking ownership of their mistakes, without fear of judgment or retaliation\n\nThe whole team welcomes and recognizes feedback as something that empowers team members to do better\n\n8 tips for building a successful team\n\nBuilding a team takes time and energy, both from leaders and from members. Even if the group is eager to learn about effective teamwork, creating a strong team and solving interpersonal issues takes intentional effort from everyone involved.\n\nWhether you’re building a dream team or trying to improve current conflict, here are eight tips for building the best team you can:\n\n1. Brainstorm with the entire team\n\nEvery workplace encounters challenges and uncertainty when setting new goals, and supporting each other throughout the process can ease those feelings.\n\nInclude the entire team in brainstorming sessions to show that you value everyone’s perspective. Remember: everyone you meet knows something that you don’t. Encouraging others to speak up might offer new knowledge or prompt ideas you otherwise wouldn’t consider.\n\n2. Establish mutual respect\n\nYour team might have a hierarchy, but that doesn’t mean anyone’s opinion or contribution is more valuable than the next. Let people know you value their work by telling them or giving them kudos in a meeting. Showing respect improves productivity, boosts employee morale, and creates an environment where everyone feels comfortable with their roles and responsibilities.\n\n3. Stress the importance of communication\n\nHaving open communication means that team members know what their expectations and boundaries are, and that they feel comfortable asking for help. This is especially important if your team is working on complex or sensitive projects that are more prone to confusion. It’s also vital for remote or hybrid teams that need active communication.\n\n4. Foster good company culture\n\nA healthy work environment improves commitment and productivity. Aim for a supportive, positive company culture that motivates and values team members to collaborate and get the job done. A good leader should be also able to read the room, gauge morale, and adjust the work environment as needed.\n\n5. Stay organized\n\nHigh-performing teams don’t become that way with messy routines and disconnected management. They know what tools they need to complete a project and solve potential problems. A shared calendar, documentation system, and regular one-on-one meetings can help your team stay on track and make sure everyone has the resources they need to thrive.\n\n6. Set team goals\n\nAlign your team by laying out some shared purposes and objectives. These include the overall mission of the company and team-specific goals. When everyone understands what they're working towards, they might be more motivated and invested in success, and they can make informed decisions that match company goals.\n\n7. Promote ownership and accountability\n\nOn any team, things can go wrong, and people make mistakes. But it’s how you react that matters most. Pointing fingers and punishing small mistakes can decrease morale and lead to a toxic workplace. Instead, create a culture where team members take ownership of their actions and feel comfortable admitting when things go wrong.\n\nEveryone can learn and improve instead of lingering on low points.\n\n8. Encourage employee development\n\nOver 90% of workers say that training and development opportunities make them feel more engaged. This includes team-building exercises and individual professional development opportunities. Team members can take on new challenges and work on their skills, improving their experience and giving them the tools to better contribute to the team.\n\n4 essential dynamics a good team should have\n\nBuilding a successful and cohesive workflow starts with understanding the core dynamics that make a team strong. Here are four dynamics to remember:\n\nDependable: Trust is a key component of any successful team. Team members should be able to rely on each other to meet their commitments and maintain high standards.\n\nMeaningful: When team members feel like their work has a purpose, they’re more likely to enjoy what they do and be productive.\n\nSupportive: Create a safe and respectful work environment where team members feel comfortable being themselves. A supportive workplace encourages team members to share ideas and collaborate with innovation in mind.\n\nStructured: Set clear expectations and a well-defined workload to make sure everyone on the team understands their roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe role of leadership in team building\n\nCreating a great team is a group effort. But as a leader, much of the power is in your hands. Managers are responsible for 70% of changes in employee engagement, meaning team improvement starts with high-level guidance.\n\nGreat leadership requires a Whole Person™ who demonstrates authenticity and supports every team member’s unique perspective. Characteristics of a good leader include integrity, resilience, and empathy, all of which help create environments in which teams can thrive.\n\nThey should understand the strengths and weaknesses of every team member and dole out responsibilities in a way that makes sense on an individual level.\n\nEffective delegation, conflict resolution, and motivation all depend on leadership style. There are dozens of ways to lead, but here are a few that might suit your team and company culture:\n\nDemocratic leadership: Democratic leaders involve their team in every discussion and consider their opinions and suggestions before making a final call. This approach is ideal for teams that enjoy having a voice, but it could draw out the decision-making process.\n\nTransactional leadership: Transactional leaders follow more traditional authority, delegating tasks with a heavier hand. This approach is effective when time is of the essence and teams need to make quick decisions. It values the work of every team member while emphasizing a clear leadership role.\n\nServant leadership: Servant leaders create an inclusive environment that avoids hierarchy, supports feedback, and places every team member on a level playing field. This approach is ideal for teams that thrive on collaboration and creative problem-solving.\n\n3 extra tips for creating a good team remotely\n\nManaging a hybrid or remote team can be challenging because team bonding doesn’t come as naturally. You can’t chat at the water cooler or carpool on the way to work. But with the right strategies, you can create a virtual team that is just as effective and successful as a traditional, in-person workforce.\n\nHere are three tips to keep in mind if you want to create a successful remote team:\n\nCelebrate each other's successes: Encourage your team to celebrate each other's wins and highlight opportunities to learn and grow. Designate meeting time to shout out high performers. And if you notice some team members aren’t improving or need extra help, reach out to them and let them know you’re there to offer support.\n\nEmploy consistent management: Establish regular meetings and communication channels to keep your team informed and connected. Schedule regular team check-ins and one-on-one meetings so if problems do arise, there’s a comfortable space to discuss them.\n\nShow interest in your team members: Get to know each team member personally, taking the time to chat when you can and support their lives outside of work.\n\nTry creating communication channels for hobbies and interests, like a space to talk about fitness goals. This creates a stronger sense of community and gives everyone the chance to get to know each other.\n\nMaking the dream work\n\nLearning what makes a good team helps you create a more respectful and aligned workplace where everyone collaborates toward common goals. Each team has a different dynamic that makes them unique, and what works for one team may fail for another — and that’s okay. Experiment with new processes and ask for feedback about what’s working. A great leader supports a team, but every member plays a role in creating a better work environment."
