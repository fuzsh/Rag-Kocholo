        "text": "When we think of the ideal team, many of us might imagine a group of people with a shared vision, all agreeing with one another, and all on the exact same page. However, this may not be as advantageous as it sounds.\n\nWhy different opinions are important\n\nThe importance of having a range of differing opinions within teams hasn’t gone unnoticed. Thinking from a varied groups of employees coming from a range of backgrounds can reduce risks by 30% while improving innovation by 20%. Forbes also revealed that employees will be happier in their job roles; new ideas will arise, and productivity will increase - leading to higher revenue and business success.\n\nIf you want to grow your talent pool or focus on retention, DEI is becoming increasingly more important for employees. A 2023 diversity article published by LinkedIn revealed that 76% of candidates and workers set a diverse workforce as a key factor when evaluating job offers.\n\nThe results appear conclusive: diversity works when it comes to business output. But why is this and how can it be incorporated into an existing team?\n\nRelated: Unlocking the power of generational diversity\n\nWhy does diversity make us smarter?\n\nWhen each member of your team is already on the same page, you run the risk of creating a stale environment. In order to push boundaries and consider all possible angles, a wider range of influences and opinions are needed. This is especially true for tasks which involve creative problem solving, innovation and collaboration.\n\nWhen each team is comprised of professionals with different experience levels, different areas of expertise and different cultural backgrounds, there are far more sources of inspiration and knowledge to draw from.\n\nResearch has shown that teams which have diverse work approaches make decisions up to 60% faster. It has also been shown to increase retention—employees who feel that their contributions are meaningful and rewarding are far more likely to be happy at work.\n\nRelated: How can you make a difference when it comes to differences?\n\nHow to encourage different opinions in your team\n\nIt can take a huge amount of courage to speak up in a team meeting, especially when your opinion potentially conflicts with those in charge of running projects or initiatives. Employees are hired for their expertise in a certain field, as well as their experience in the wider industry, so every opinion is a valuable one which offers a new consideration or perspective.\n\nRelated: 5 ways to manage generational differences in the workplace\n\nThe leadership team also have a huge part to play in the creation of an environment that champions the productive sharing of differing viewpoints. They should strive to establish a culture of acceptance and creativity within their teams. Staff should feel that they can share ideas—regardless of what they might be - without fear of ridicule from co-workers or authority figures.\n\nThis culture of contribution and collaboration should be lead by example, starting right at the top. Instead of shutting down bad ideas, remain encouraging and actively create opportunities for staff to learn to assess future contributions. Remember - there’s no such thing as a bad idea!"
