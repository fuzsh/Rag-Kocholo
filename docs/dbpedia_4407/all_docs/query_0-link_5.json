        "text": "IAN GOLDBERG\n\nchief operating officer\n\nian@bokagrp.com\n\nIan Goldberg has worked in the restaurant industry since he was 15 years old and was the first employee ever hired by Boka Restaurant Group. Born in Chicago, Goldberg graduated from the University of Illinois with a bachelorâs degree in Business Administration and a focus in Entrepreneurship.\n\nWhen he joined BRG as a bartender at Boka in 2003, Goldberg made it his mission to learn everything he could about the hospitality business. Paired with his passion for food, wine, and service, Goldbergâs tenacity, ability to listen and reflect, and commitment to problem-solving made him a critical member of the quickly expanding group. Over the next eight years, Goldberg rose from Bartender to Assistant General Manager, to General Manager, to Director of Operations, and then to Vice President in 2011. In 2019, he was named Chief Operating Officer.\n\nThroughout his tenure with BRG, Goldberg worked to transform the group into an ecosystem that thrives because it is rooted in the work ethic, passion, and genuine hospitality that continue to fuel his own career.\n\nâ\n\nABBY KRITZLER\n\nCHIEF CULTURE OFFICER\n\nexecutive director\n\nabby@bokagrp.com\n\nSince the beginning of her career, Abby Kritzler has dedicated herself to making a difference in the lives of others through collaboration and empowerment.\n\nWhile studying Sociology, Community Advocacy, and Social Policy in college, Kritzler balanced volunteer work with a restaurant job, aiming to continue her career in nonprofit and advocacy. When she began working at Landmark Grill & Lounge as a Server Assistant in 2007, she only intended to stay a few months, but Kritzler soon fell in love with the way hospitality impacts people of diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and skill sets. In 2011, Kritzler requested a meeting with Boka Restaurant Group Co-Founders, Rob Katz and Kevin Boehm, to discuss ideas for the company (the original notes from the meeting still sit on Kritzlerâs desk today). Afterward, Katz and Boehm offered Kritzler a position as their Executive Assistant. Within months she was promoted to Executive Director of Boka Restaurant Group.\n\nToday, as Chief Culture Officer, Kritzler strives every day to find new ways to bring joy to BRG team members, guests, and clients, and continues to build the infrastructure that makes BRG a group that gives back.\n\nJAMI MADONIA\n\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER\n\njami@bokagrp.com\n\nâWith a background in accounting, design, and business, Jami Madoniaâs distinct blend of analytical and creative thinking has made her a key strategic voice within Boka Restaurant Group.\n\nAfter graduating from Pennsylvania State University with a degree in Advertising and Design, Madonia began working as a hostess for The N9NE Group in Chicago, before pursuing a career in advertising. Madonia soon discovered that what she loved about designâthinking about how people engage with an experience and problem solving to improve that experienceâwas the foundation of hospitality as well. She stayed with The N9NE Group, rising to become its Regional Controller. When the company closed and Madonia started her own financial consulting firm, Boka Restaurant Group became one of her first clients. In 2015, she joined BRG as Controller to develop and oversee the accounting team. Since then, Madonia has built the financial backbone of the company, while cultivating a culture of team-building, mentorship, and empowerment.\n\nToday, as Chief Financial Officer, Madonia continues to give BRG the structure to raise the bar for the hospitality industry. When sheâs not in the office, Madonia can be found spending time with her two children, Alexandra and Weston."
