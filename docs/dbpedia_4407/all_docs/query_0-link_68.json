        "text": "Japanese video game developer\n\nNot to be confused with Ninja Theory.\n\nTeam Ninja (Japanese: チームニンジャ) is a Japanese video game developer, and a division of Koei Tecmo, founded in 1995 as a part of Tecmo. It was founded by Tomonobu Itagaki, and is best known for franchises such as Ninja Gaiden, Dead or Alive and Nioh.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounding, Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden (1995–2009)\n\n[edit]\n\nTeam Ninja was formed by Tomonobu Itagaki from a group of game designers working at Tecmo specifically for the purpose of creating the home versions of the fighting game series Dead or Alive.[1] During the mid-1990s, Japanese gaming company Tecmo was in financial trouble. Seeing how popular Sega's Virtua Fighter series was in Japan at the time, the management asked Tomonobu Itagaki to create a game similar to Virtua Fighter.[2] In order to stand out from other fighting games, Team Ninja focused on making Dead or Alive provocative. Itagaki believed that violence and sexuality were needed for \"true entertainment\".[3]\n\nIn 1999, Team Ninja started work on a new Ninja Gaiden project, originally intended for arcades, later for the Dreamcast. Due to Sega exiting the console business, development was moved to the PlayStation 2.[4][5]\n\nHowever, due to Itagaki being impressed by the technological capabilities of the new Xbox from Microsoft, development was moved to that platform. Ninja Gaiden would be released in 2004 to rave critical acclaim.[6][7][8]\n\nIn 2008, the action-adventure game Ninja Gaiden II for the Xbox 360 was published by Microsoft Game Studios, making it the first game created by Team Ninja to not be published by Tecmo; Tecmo Koei later released an enhanced version of Ninja Gaiden II on the PlayStation 3 as Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2.\n\nMerger with Koei (2009–2013)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2009, it was announced that Tecmo and Koei would be merging.[9] The newly founded Koei Tecmo would officially disband Tecmo in 2010.[10][11] A year later all of Tecmo's assets were absorbed into Koei Tecmo, including IP and its subsidiaries and divisions. Team Ninja would continue as subsidiary of Koei Tecmo.[12]\n\nTeam Ninja collaborated on multiple titles with Nintendo. In 2010, Team Ninja co-developed a new Metroid action-adventure game for Nintendo's Wii console, titled Metroid: Other M. A playable Stage from Other M would appear in the Nintendo 3DS game Dead or Alive: Dimensions, which was published by Nintendo in Europe and Australia. Team Ninja would in 2014 also collaborate with Omega Force on the development of Hyrule Warriors, an action game set in The Legend of Zelda universe, and with SEGA AM2 since 2012's Dead or Alive 5, co-developing an Arcade version of the title, as well as on bringing characters from Virtua Fighter to Dead or Alive.\n\nRestructuring and Nioh (2013–present)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2013, following a reconstructing of Koei Tecmo, Team Ninja would cease to exist internally, being renamed Koei Tecmo Ichigaya, with Yosuke Hayashi subsequently becoming Head of the Ichigaya Development Group.[13] The developer was also split into two distinct development teams, one led by Ninja Gaiden Sigma director Yosuke Hayashi and one led by Fatal Frame producer Keisuke Kikuchi.[14] Further restructuring at Koei Tecmo in 2016 resulted in Team Tachyon, the developers behind Quantum Theory as well as Rygar: The Battle of Argus being shut down. A large amount of developers were moved to Team Ninja.[15]\n\nIn 2017, Team Ninja released their new action role-playing game Nioh to great critical response.[16][17] Nioh originally started development in 2004 at Koei, and was moved between multiple developers, such as Omega Force, before Koei approached Team Ninja after the merger in 2010 to help develop the game.[18] When first presented with the project by Koei, Team Ninja staff were skeptic about the game's concept, citing the western protagonist in Sengoku-era Japan, as well as various mechanics.[18] Despite these uncertainties, development was fully transferred to Team Ninja in 2012.[19][18][20] The title would go on to receive multiple awards,[21][22][23][24] and became Team Ninja's best-selling title.[25] They released Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order for the Nintendo Switch in 2019 as well as Dead or Alive 6. Team Ninja released the prequel to Nioh, Nioh 2, in March 2020. A compilation of Ninja Gaiden series, dubbed Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, released in June 2021. Team Ninja also developed Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, which released in 2022.[26]\n\nAs of 2022, Yosuke Hayashi had left Team Ninja to serve as the general manager of Koei Tecmo's entertainment division,[27] with Fumihiko Yasuda replacing him as president.[28] Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was announced the same year, being produced by Team Ninja lead Fumihiko Yasuda, who led the development on Nioh and Nioh 2, as well as Masaaki Yamagiwa. Yamagiwa, who joined Team Ninja in 2021 after the closure of Sony's Japan Studio, was previously producer on Bloodborne.[29][30] It released in 2023.\n\nSplit with Tomonobu Itagaki\n\n[edit]\n\nTomonobu Itagaki was promoted to Tecmo Executive Officer in June 2004, as well as to General Manager in 2006, alongside his position as the head of Team Ninja. In 2007 due to a lawsuit regarding alleged sexual harassment, his manager roles would be revoked. Although he was later judged innocent by a Tokyo district court, the lawsuit permanently strained the relationship between Itagaki and Tecmo.[31] On June 3, 2008, Itagaki announced that he would be leaving Tecmo and Team Ninja on July 1, 2008, citing difficulties with the company. In the same statement announcing his resignation, he also announced that he was filing a lawsuit against Tecmo president, Yoshimi Yasuda, over unpaid bonuses for his work on Dead or Alive 4 for the Xbox 360. It was later reported that he was fired from Tecmo on June 18, 2008, in retaliation for his lawsuit.[32] Another lawsuit followed shortly after which was filed on 16 June by two plaintiffs on behalf of Tecmo's 300 employees for unpaid wages amounting to ¥8.3 million.[33] Many of his colleagues at Team Ninja quit as well to join him at his new game development team, Valhalla Game Studios. Some ex-Team Ninja members also helped with Ubisoft's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up.[34] The two parties would settle in February 2010 for an undisclosed amount.[35] After Itagaki's departure, Yosuke Hayashi would subsequently serve as the new lead at Team Ninja until his departure in 2022. Fumihiko Yasuda serves as the new president since.[27][28]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nDepiction of Women\n\n[edit]\n\nTeam Ninja's provocative style, originally coined by Itagaki,[3] while often having been praised, with Dead or Alive's Kasumi being regarded as a modern-day sex symbol,[36][37] with MTV UK labeling her as one of the sexiest characters in video games,[38] has been criticised for objectifying women.[39][40] In a 2012 Interview with Kotaku, Yosuke Hayashi said that Team Ninja was \"very misinterpreted\" outside of Japan, and that there's no derogatory intention in their creation process. \"We can't help if other cultures in other countries around the globe think that it's a bad representation\", so Hayashi.[41] In 2016, Team Ninja garnered public attention after their decision to not release Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 in North America or Europe, reigniting a controversy within the video game industry about the sexualised portrayal of female characters within their games.[40][42][43] Shuhei Yoshida, president of Sony Interactive Entertainment at the time, said in a statement in regard to Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 that Europe and North America have their cultural differences about how to depict women in video games and other media.[44]\n\nExcessive Violence in Ninja Gaiden II\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, the German Rating Board USK refused classification for Ninja Gaiden II, banning the game for sale in Germany, due to the title's excessive violence. The game's publisher, Microsoft, had no interest in releasing a compromised, cut version of the game.[45] This would later affect the development of the PlayStation 3 version, dubbed Sigma 2, as the game's violence was significantly toned down.[46] Sigma 2 received classification in Germany.[47]\n\nDead or Alive: Dimensions ban in Sweden and Australia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2011, Dead or Alive: Dimensions was banned in Sweden, due to the rating board determining that the characters appeared too young.[48] Due to Sweden's ban on the title, Australian politician Brendan O'Connor urged the Australian Classification Board to reexamine the title, resulting in the game getting its classification revoked and being removed from sale. Nintendo, the publisher of the game in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, stated that Dead or Alive Dimensions contained no objectionable content and resubmitted the game. The classification was reinstated shortly thereafter.[49][50]\n\nEVO Japan 2019 shutdown\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2019, Team Ninja gained controversy, due to a livestream of Dead or Alive 6 at Evo Japan 2019 featuring gravure idols. The livestream was forcibly shut-down by the Evolution Championship Series. The co-founder and CEO of EVO, Joey Cuellar, issued an apology saying that \"the stream does not reflect the core values of EVO\" and that they had to end to stream to \"protect the integrity\" of EVO. Mark Julio, head of global business at EVO, later appeared live during the tournament to issue an apology, saying that the content showcased by a partner of EVO wouldn't \"reflect the content and intention\" of the Esports organiser.[51][52][53][54] Evo 2020 would be cancelled and Cuellar removed as CEO, due to a history of sexual abuse towards minors coming to light.[55]\n\nRise of the Rōnin not releasing in South Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to reports, Rise of the Rōnin would not release in South Korea, due to Fumihiko Yasuda comparing Shoin Yoshida, a controversial figure in South Korea, to Socrates. However, Sony has denied those claims.[56]\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Release year Genre Platform(s) Notes Dead or Alive 1996 Fighting game Arcade, Saturn, PlayStation Dead or Alive 2 1999 Fighting game Arcade, Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 Credited as \"Team Ninja - Tecmo Creative #3\" Dead or Alive 3 2001 Fighting game Xbox Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 2003 Sports, Party Xbox Ninja Gaiden 2004 Action-adventure, hack and slash Xbox Dead or Alive Ultimate Fighting game Xbox Remake of Dead or Alive and Dead or Alive 2.
