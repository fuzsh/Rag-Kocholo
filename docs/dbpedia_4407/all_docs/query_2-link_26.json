        "text": "Marble is one of the oldest options for countertops. If you are lucky enough to travel through old Europe you will find it being used everywhere. At Stone Concepts we like to educate you on the products you will choose. The issue with marble is that it will patina. Some customers love the patina look and others don’t. For customers who don’t like the patina looked of marble there is also products on the market such as Tuffskin that will help you protect the marble so it is etch free. We always provide our clients with samples so they can test the product and understand if it is the correct choice for their lifestyle.\n\nHonestly, we can not say for sure which product will be best for you and your family. That is why we take the time to educate our customers on the pros and cons of each stone. They are all solid choices and aesthetically different from one to the other.\n\nHere is a brief summary on each one:\n\nQUARTZ:\n\nFor the most part Quartz is a fool proof product that will not stain. It has a factory warranty. It is not completely heat proof as the advertising claims. It can crack with thermal shock. We always recommend using a trivet or heat pad. Quartz can also chip, but chips are repairable.\n\nQUARTZITE:\n\nQuartzite is a hard, non-foliated metamorphic rock which was originally pure quartz sandstone. Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts. Quartzite has the look of a marble but it will not react to acidic food like a typical marble would. We recommend using a 15 year sealer. Beware of suppliers that label their stones as quartzite. You should always test the sample for hardness and sensitivity to acid."
