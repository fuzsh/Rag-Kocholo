Healthy People 2030’s overarching goals are to:\n\nAttain healthy, thriving lives and well-being free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death.\n\nEliminate health disparities, achieve health equity, and attain health literacy to improve the health and well-being of all.\n\nCreate social, physical, and economic environments that promote attaining the full potential for health and well-being for all.\n\nPromote healthy development, healthy behaviors, and well-being across all life stages.\n\nEngage leadership, key constituents, and the public across multiple sectors to take action and design policies that improve the health and well-being of all.\n\nPlan of Action\n\nIt’s important to provide information and tools to help communities, states, and organizations use Healthy People. The Healthy People 2030 plan of action is to:\n\nSet national goals and measurable objectives to guide evidence-based policies, programs, and other actions to improve health and well-being.\n\nProvide accurate, timely, and accessible data that can drive targeted actions to address regions and populations that have poor health or are at high risk for poor health.\n\nFoster impact through public and private efforts to improve health and well-being for people of all ages and the communities in which they live.\n\nProvide tools for the public, programs, policymakers, and others to evaluate progress toward improving health and well-being.\n\nShare and support the implementation of evidence-based programs and policies that are replicable, scalable, and sustainable.\n\nReport biennially on progress throughout the decade from 2020 to 2030.\n\nStimulate research and innovation toward meeting Healthy People 2030 goals and highlight critical research, data, and evaluation needs.\n\nFacilitate the development and availability of affordable means of health promotion, disease prevention, and treatment.\n\nHistory and Context\n\nThe Healthy People initiative began in 1979 when Surgeon General Julius Richmond issued a landmark report titled “Healthy People: The Surgeon General’s Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.” Healthy People 2030 is the fifth iteration of the initiative. It builds on knowledge gained and lessons learned to address the latest public health priorities."
