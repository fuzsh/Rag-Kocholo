        "text": "Community Engagement Statement continued...\n\nOur approach to the site began with a discovery process of an extensive community outreach where we conducted seven listening sessions with groups ranging from the families of the 58, survivors and other concertgoers, emergency responders, and other community members who have been impacted by the event. The purpose was to listen to their stories as a means of informing the memorial design and to gather valuable insights and understandings into the needs, preferences, and aspirations of all those who will be visiting the memorial. This process informed the many components and concepts that comprise the overall memorial experience. We learned of the need for the memorial to have spaces dedicated for remembrance of the 58; we learned about the deep yearning for healing, uniting, and connecting with others; we began to understand the importance of expressions of strength and courage in making lasting impressions.\n\nWe have developed a name for the memorial that relates to the concept of infinite memory and becoming one with the 58. We believe that their spirit can live on in the name of the “Forever One Memorial.”\n\nThe Forever One Memorial is to become a transformative journey of emotion, reflection, and remembrance, one that follows the shape of the infinity symbol as an innovative and thought-provoking storytelling pathway. It can be an experiential approach where the loop cuts under and extends over itself to create a continuous and fluid journey for visitors. The looping and intertwining pathway can inspire visitors to reflect on the infinite nature of life and their own personal journeys. Using the infinity shape as a representation of a transformative journey invites individuals to honor the memories of those we have lost and embrace the transformative power of remembrance in shaping our own lives."
