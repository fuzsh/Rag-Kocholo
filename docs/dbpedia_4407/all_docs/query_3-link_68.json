        "text": "Collaborative Learning\n\nCollaborative learning can occur peer-to-peer or in larger groups. Peer learning, or peer instruction, is a type of collaborative learning that involves students working in pairs or small groups to discuss concepts or find solutions to problems. Similar to the idea that two or three heads are better than one, educational researchers have found that through peer instruction, students teach each other by addressing misunderstandings and clarifying misconceptions.\n\nWhy use collaborative learning?\n\nResearch shows that educational experiences that are active, social, contextual, engaging, and student-owned lead to deeper learning. The benefits of collaborative learning include:\n\nDevelopment of higher-level thinking, oral communication, self-management, and leadership skills.\n\nPromotion of student-faculty interaction.\n\nIncrease in student retention, self-esteem, and responsibility.\n\nExposure to and an increase in understanding of diverse perspectives.\n\nPreparation for real life social and employment situations.\n\nConsiderations for using collaborative learning\n\nIntroduce group or peer work early in the semester to set clear student expectations.\n\nEstablish ground rules for participation and contributions.\n\nPlan for each stage of group work.\n\nCarefully explain to your students how groups or peer discussion will operate and how students will be graded.\n\nHelp students develop the skills they need to succeed, such as using team-building exercises or introducing self-reflection techniques.\n\nConsider using written contracts.\n\nIncorporate self -assessment and peer assessment for group members to evaluate their own and others' contributions.\n\nGetting started with collaborative learning\n\nShorter in-class collaborative learning activities generally involve a three-step process. This process can be as short as five minutes, but can be longer, depending on the task at hand.\n\nIntroduce the task. This can be as simple as instructing students to turn to their neighbor to discuss or debate a topic.\n\nProvide students with enough time to engage with the task. Walk around and address any questions as needed.\n\nDebrief. Call on a few students to share a summary of their conclusions. Address any misconceptions or clarify any confusing points. Open the floor for questions.\n\nFor larger group work projects, here are some strategies to help ensure productive group dynamics:\n\nProvide opportunities for students to develop rapport and group cohesion through icebreakers, team-building, and reflection exercises.\n\nGive students time to create a group work plan allowing them to plan for deadlines and divide up their responsibilities.\n\nHave students establish ground rules. Students can create a contract for each member to sign. This contract can include agreed-upon penalties for those who fail to fulfill obligations.\n\nAssign roles to members of each group and change the roles periodically. For example, one student can be the coordinator, another the note-taker, another the summarizer, and another the planner of next steps.\n\nAllow students to rate each otherâ€™s quality and quantity of contributions. Use these evaluations when giving individual grades, but do not let it weigh heavily on a student's final grade. Communicate clearly how peer assessment will influence grades.\n\nCheck in with groups intermittently but encourage students to handle their own issues before coming to you for assistance."
