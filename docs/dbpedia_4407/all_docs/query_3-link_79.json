        "text": "Team management focuses on motivating a group of employees to work toward a common goal. Differing styles of team management achieve goals in different ways. Itâs the duty of team managers to support the needs of team members in a way thatâs helpful, positive, and motivating.\n\nJobs in team management range from general managers to c-suite level positions. Managing a team is a useful skill that many business professionals use on a regular basis, and an in-demand skill in managerial careers across industries.Â\n\nWhat is team management?\n\nTeam management refers to actions, strategies, or methods that brings a group of people together to work effectively as a team and achieve a common goal. There are many tasks that require multiple people, so teams are an essential building block to productivity. Companies rely on teams and effective team management to maintain its operations.Â\n\nPitfalls like ineffective communication or lack of effort by a team member can derail a teamâs progress. Team management helps incorporate checkpoints for teams to successfully start. It also helps maintain a good working relationship and momentum throughout the teamâs life until the goal is met.Â\n\nTeam management vs. team leadership\n\nTeam management and team leadership have some similarities, but there are also major differences. Both approaches work toward a common goal, team management controls the team to accomplish the goal while team leadership motivates and influences the team to accomplish goals.Â\n\nTeam leaders may not necessarily have the manager title but their responsibility is to focus on the company vision and how to inspire team members to create and execute that vision. Goals are still a part of team leadership, but in a more âbig pictureâ way. Team management can be more granular, focused on completion of tasks and organizing the group in the most efficient and productive way.Â\n\nWhy is team management important?\n\nWorking with others can be tricky. Team management helps groups of employees work better together by setting common goals and offering support and strategies to reach goals. Managers may delegate tasks to group members, set mini check points, and more to keep the team on track and moving forward. Team management tactics also provide a mediator if team members come into conflict or need an outside opinion. Some other advantages to team management include:\n\nFosters and promotes learning\n\nIncreases productivity\n\nHelps to reduce staff turnover\n\nPromotes successful teamwork\n\nIncreases employee satisfaction\n\nTypes of team management styles\n\nIndividuals who manage teams naturally have varying management styles. Factors that may impact which type of team management style used include:\n\nA personâs temperamentÂ\n\nCharacter traits\n\nThe needs of the individuals on the teamÂ\n\nThe volume of work that needs to be completed\n\nTeam management styles can be changed to better align with project goals or based on the team of people youâre managing. Each style has both advantages and disadvantages depending on how itâs used, consider the following styles and determine which one fits your needs:Â\n\n1. Persuasive\n\nIn persuasive management, youâll typically be the expert of the subject matter youâre leading in. Youâll persuade your team that your objectives and ideas are good and that their work is important. This style can also be helpful if youâre managing upwards, where youâll provide profesional thoughts and opinions to more senior colleagues.Â\n\nWhen to use it: Managers use this style to make quick decisions, increase productivity, and be transparent in their decision-making process.Â\n\nWhat to be mindful of: There may be situations that lack participation and agreement which could create a stalemate.Â Â\n\n2. Consultative\n\nAs the name suggests, managers consult with team members and use their skills to seek solutions, create plans, and make decisions. This management style focuses on team building where employees participate more in the decision making process. With consultative team management style employees feel valued and respected.Â\n\nWhen to use it: Employees may find it easier to accept decisions that they disagree with if they were consulted first.\n\nWhat to be mindful of: There may be a personality mismatch if the team doesnât work well together.Â\n\n3. Collaborative\n\nIn collaborative management, it aims to bring executives, managers, and staff to work and take responsibility together. This style can spark personal and professional fulfillment making it more common for great work to be produced regularly . Itâs also typical for information to be shared organically and there be open communication between team members of all levels. This style is most prevelant in nonprofits.Â\n\nWhen to use it: Decision making is a collaborative effort, which boosts employees' appreciation and loyalty.Â\n\nWhat to be mindful of: Using this style too often can create challenges, such as lack of leadership, direction, and inability to make decisions as a group.Â Â\n\n4. Democratic or participativeÂ\n\nManagers using a democratic style of management include employees in the decision making process by listening to ideas, noting suggestions, and spending time going through ideas together. Managers listen to employees and integrate their ideas with their own.Â\n\nWhen to use it: This style is most effective for long-term decisions that impact the overall company.Â\n\nWhat to be mindful of: Â With this style there may be inefficiency, lack of structure, and decision making may take longer when more ideas are formed.Â\n\n5. Authoritative\n\nManagers who know what they want and have a clear and focused vision may rely on authoritative management tactics. In this style, managers solely make the decisions that everyone must follow.Â\n\nWhen to use it: This style is efficient when there may be a crisis and when decisions need ot be made quickly.Â Managers may use authoritative management to set clear expectations.Â Â\n\nWhat to be mindful of: Some employees may experience feelings of micromanagement and lack of control.Â\n\n6. Transformational\n\nTransformation leadership is driven by motivation, encouragement, and innovation. Managers will typically encourage employees to reach and set goals that may be out of their comfort zone. Employees are also included in decision making, creating an open and democratic workplace environment. Transformation managers can often be found in the technology industry.Â\n\nWhen to use it: Transformational management strategies encourage creativity, a more positive working environment, and a strong threshold for adaptability and change.Â\n\nWhat to be mindful of: Transformational management can lead to employee burnout and lack of clear focus because of the constant changes.\n\n7. Laissez-faire\n\nLaissez-faire is a hands-off management style where managers are similar to mentors than leaders. Managers communicate expectations, goals, and more, and then leave the team to accomplish those objectives without daily guidance. Managers are still present, and available for questions and guidance, but the daily decision making is with employees.Â\n\nWhen to use it: Employees may enjoy this style of management if they dislike micromanagement. It can also create a creative and autonomous work environment.Â\n\nWhat to be mindful of: With a hands-off approach, employees may feel neglected and a lack of guidance.Â\n\nWhat does a management team do?\n\nA management team creates guidelines, goals, checkpoints, and objectives for employees to improve productivity while also providing support and motivation. The goal is to: manage people and manage processes. As a team manager youâll recognize employee needs, incorporate clear guidelines, and set timelines. Management teams help balance needs while moving toward a common goal.
