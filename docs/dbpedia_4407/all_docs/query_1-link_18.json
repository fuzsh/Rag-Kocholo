        "text": "Literature has been created in what is today the United States for thousands of years. This history began with the many oral traditions of the Indigenous peoples of North America.\n\nAmong the Native peoples of the Plains, the Southwest, and parts of present-day California, Coyote was the central figure of the age before humans were created. Hundreds of tales told by these peoples describe his exploits as a trickster and as a benefactor to humankind.\n\nRaven was Coyote’s counterpart for the Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Coast, the Pacific coast stretching from what is today Alaska to northwestern California. The Raven cycle is a collection of tales that describe the chaos that Raven creates and the order that eventually emerges, often at Raven’s expense.\n\nThe oral traditions of the Pueblo, in the Southwest, include stories about kachinas, the ancestral spirit-beings that exist among humans and actively shape their environment.\n\nAmong the Native peoples of the Plains, a wide range of creation myths explain how the world came into existence. The stories of the Comanche, for example, center on the Great Spirit, which created different groups of humans, while the Sioux describe how the winds came into being and, together with the Sun and the Moon, control the universe.\n\nThe first colonists of North America wrote, often in English, about their experiences starting in the 1600s. This literature was practical, straightforward, often derivative of literature in Great Britain, and focused on the future.\n\nJohn Smith wrote histories of Virginia based on his experiences as an English explorer and as president of the Jamestown Colony. These histories, published in 1608 and 1624, include his controversial accounts of the Powhatan girl Pocahontas.\n\nNathaniel Ward and John Winthrop wrote books on religion, a topic of central concern in colonial America.\n\nAnne Bradstreet’s The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America (1650) may be the earliest collection of poetry written in and about America, although it was published in England.\n\nA new era began when the United States declared its independence in 1776, and much new writing addressed the country’s future. American poetry and fiction were largely modeled on what was being published overseas in Great Britain, and much of what American readers consumed also came from Great Britain.\n\nThe Federalist Papers (1787–88), by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, shaped the political direction of the United States.\n\nBenjamin Franklin’s Autobiography, which he wrote during the 1770s and ’80s, tells a quintessentially American life story.\n\nPhillis Wheatley, an African woman enslaved in Boston, was the first Black poet of note in the United States. Her first book was Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral (1773). Philip Freneau is another notable poet of the era.\n\nThe first American novel, The Power of Sympathy by William Hill Brown, was published in 1789.\n\nOlaudah Equiano’s autobiography, The Interesting Narrative (1789), is among the earliest slave narratives and stands as a forceful argument for abolition.\n\nBy the first decades of the 19th century, a truly American literature began to emerge. Though still derived from British literary tradition, the short stories and novels published from 1800 through the 1820s began to depict American society and explore the American landscape in an unprecedented manner.\n\nWashington Irving published the collection of short stories and essays The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. in 1819–20. It includes “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and “Rip Van Winkle,” two of the earliest American short stories.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper wrote novels of adventure about the frontiersman Natty Bumppo. These novels, called the Leatherstocking Tales (1823–41), depict his experiences in the American wilderness in both realistic and highly romanticized ways.\n\nRomanticism is a way of thinking that values the individual over the group, the subjective over the objective, and a person’s emotional experience over reason. It also values the wildness of nature over human-made order. Romanticism as a worldview took hold in western Europe in the late 18th century, and American writers embraced it in the early 19th century.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe most vividly depicted, and inhabited, the role of the Romantic individual—a genius, often tormented and always struggling against convention—during the 1830s and up to his mysterious death in 1849.\n\nPoe invented the modern detective story with “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” (1841).\n\nThe poem “The Raven” (1845) is a gloomy depiction of lost love. Its eeriness is intensified by its meter and rhyme scheme.\n\nThe short stories “The Fall of the House of Usher” (1839) and “The Cask of Amontillado” (1846) are gripping tales of horror.\n\nIn New England, several different groups of writers and thinkers emerged after 1830, each exploring the experiences of individuals in different segments of American society.\n\nJames Russell Lowell was among those who used humor and dialect in verse and prose to depict everyday life in the Northeast.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow and Oliver Wendell Holmes were the most prominent of the upper-class Brahmins, who filtered their depiction of America through European models and sensibilities.\n\nThe Transcendentalists developed an elaborate philosophy that saw in all of creation a unified whole. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote influential essays, while Henry David Thoreau wrote Walden (1854), an account of his life alone by Walden Pond. Margaret Fuller was editor of The Dial, an important Transcendentalist magazine.\n\nThree men—Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, and Walt Whitman—began publishing novels, short stories, and poetry during the Romantic period that became some of the most-enduring works of American literature.\n\nAs a young man, Hawthorne published short stories, most notable among them the allegorical “Young Goodman Brown” (1835). In the 1840s he crossed paths with the Transcendentalists before he started writing his two most significant novels—The Scarlet Letter (1850) and The House of the Seven Gables (1851).\n\nMelville was one of Hawthorne’s friends and neighbors. Hawthorne was also a strong influence on Melville’s Moby Dick (1851), which was the culmination of Melville’s early life of traveling and writing.\n\nWhitman wrote poetry that described his home, New York City. He refused the traditional constraints of rhyme and meter in favor of free verse in Leaves of Grass (1855), and his frankness in subject matter and tone repelled some critics. But the book, which went through many subsequent editions, became a landmark in American poetry, and it epitomized the ethos of the Romantic period.\n\nDuring the 1850s, as the United States headed toward civil war, more and more stories by and about enslaved and free Black people were written.\n\nWilliam Wells Brown published what is often considered the first Black American novel, Clotel, in 1853. He also wrote the first African American play to be published, The Escape (1858).\n\nIn 1859 Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and Harriet E. Wilson became the first Black women to publish fiction in the United States.\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin, first published serially in 1851–52, is credited with raising opposition in the North to slavery.\n\nHarriet Jacobs published a searing account of her life as an enslaved woman in 1861, the same year that the Civil War began. It became one of the era’s most influential slave narratives.\n\nEmily Dickinson lived a life quite unlike other writers of the Romantic period: she lived largely in seclusion; only a handful of her poems were published before her death in 1886; and she was a woman working at a time when men dominated the literary scene. Yet her poems express a Romantic vision as clearly as Whitman’s or Poe’s. They are sharp-edged and emotionally intense. Here are five of her notable poems:\n\n“I’m Nobody! Who are you?”\n\n“Because I could not stop for Death –”\n\n“My Life had stood – a Loaded Gun”\n\n“A Bird, came down the Walk –”\n\n“Safe in their Alabaster Chambers”\n\nThe human cost of the Civil War in the United States was immense: more than 2,300,000 soldiers fought in the war, and perhaps as many as 851,000 people died in 1861–65. Walt Whitman claimed that “a great literature will…arise out of the era of those four years,” and what emerged in the following decades was a literature that presented a detailed and unembellished vision of the world as it truly was. This was the essence of realism. Naturalism was an intensified form of realism. After the grim realities of a devastating war, these styles became writers’ primary mode of expression.\n\nSamuel Clemens was a typesetter, a journalist, a riverboat captain, and an itinerant laborer before he became, in 1863 at age 27, Mark Twain. He first used that name while reporting on politics in the Nevada Territory. It then appeared on the short story “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,” published in 1865, which catapulted him to national fame. Twain’s story was a humorous tall tale, but its characters were realistic depictions of actual Americans. Twain deployed this combination of humor and realism throughout his writing. The following are some of Twain’s notable works:\n\nMajor novels: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885)\n\nTravel narratives: The Innocents Abroad (1869), Roughing It (1872), Life on the Mississippi (1883)\n\nShort stories: “Jim Baker’s Blue-Jay Yarn” (1880), “The Man that Corrupted Hadleyburg” (1899)\n\nNaturalism, like realism, was a literary movement that drew inspiration from French authors of the 19th century who sought to document, through fiction, the reality that they saw around them, particularly among the middle and working classes living in cities.\n\nTheodore Dreiser was foremost among American writers who embraced naturalism. His Sister Carrie (1900) is the most important American naturalist novel.\n\nMaggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893) and The Red Badge of Courage (1895), by Stephen Crane, and McTeague (1899), The Octopus (1901), and The Pit (1903), by Frank Norris, are novels that vividly depict the reality of urban life, war, and capitalism.\n\nPaul Laurence Dunbar was an African American writer who wrote poetry in Black dialect—“Possum” and “When de Co’n Pone’s Hot”—that were popular with his white audience and gave them what they believed was reality for Black Americans. Dunbar also wrote poems not in dialect—“We Wear the Mask” and “Sympathy”—that exposed the reality of racism in America during Reconstruction and afterward.\n\nSophia Alice Callahan, who was of Muskogee Creek descent, published in 1891 what is often considered the first novel by a Native woman: Wynema: A Child of the Forest. Zitkala-Sa, whose mother was Yankton Sioux, published a collection of Dakota stories, Old Indian Legends, in 1901. She used this collection and other early writings to document her experience of forced assimilation, and she spent the rest of her life advocating for Native peoples.\n\nHenry James shared the view of the realists and naturalists that literature ought to present reality, but his writing style and use of literary form sought to also create an aesthetic experience, not simply document truth. He was preoccupied with the clash in values between the United States and Europe. His writing shows features of both 19th-century realism and naturalism and 20th-century modernism. Some of his notable novels include:\n\nThe American (1877)\n\nThe Portrait of a Lady (1881)\n\nWhat Maisie Knew (1897)\n\nThe Wings of the Dove (1902)\n\nThe Golden Bowl (1904)\n\nAdvances in science and technology in Western countries rapidly intensified at the start of the 20th century and brought about a sense of unprecedented progress. The devastation of World War I and the Great Depression also caused widespread suffering in Europe and the United States. These contradictory impulses can be found swirling within modernism, a movement in the arts defined first and foremost as a radical break from the past. But this break was often an act of destruction, and it caused a loss of faith in traditional structures and beliefs. Despite, or perhaps because of, these contradictory impulses, the modernist period proved to be one of the richest and most productive in American literature.\n\nA sense of disillusionment and loss pervades much American modernist fiction. That sense may be centered on specific individuals, or it may be directed toward American society or toward civilization generally. It may generate a nihilistic, destructive impulse, or it may express hope at the prospect of change.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald skewered the American Dream in The Great Gatsby (1925).\n\nRichard Wright exposed and attacked American racism in Native Son (1940).\n\nZora Neale Hurston told the story of a Black woman’s three marriages in Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).\n\nErnest Hemingway’s early novels The Sun Also Rises (1926) and A Farewell to Arms (1929) articulated the disillusionment of the Lost Generation.\n\nWilla Cather told hopeful stories of the American frontier, set mostly on the Great Plains, in O Pioneers! (1913) and My Ántonia (1918).\n\nWilliam Faulkner used stream-of-consciousness monologues and other formal techniques to break from past literary practice in The Sound and the Fury (1929).\n\nJohn Steinbeck depicted the difficult lives of migrant workers in Of Mice and Men (1937) and The Grapes of Wrath (1939).\n\nT.S. Eliot was an American by birth and, as of 1927, a British subject by choice. His fragmentary, multivoiced The Waste Land (1922) is the quintessential modernist poem, but his was not the dominant voice among American modernist poets.\n\nRobert Frost and Carl Sandburg evocatively described the regions—New England and the Midwest, respectively—in which they lived.\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance produced a rich coterie of poets, among them Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, and Alice Dunbar Nelson.\n\nHarriet Monroe founded Poetry magazine in Chicago in 1912 and made it the most important organ for poetry not just in the United States but for the English-speaking world.\n\nDuring the 1920s Edna St. Vincent Millay, Marianne Moore, and E.E. Cummings expressed a spirit of revolution and experimentation in their poetry.\n\nDrama came to prominence for the first time in the United States in the early 20th century. Playwrights drew inspiration from European theater but created plays that were uniquely and enduringly American.\n\nEugene O’Neill was the foremost American playwright of the period. His Long Day’s Journey into Night (written 1939–41, performed 1956) was the high point of more than 20 years of creativity that began in 1920 with Beyond the Horizon and concluded with The Iceman Cometh (written 1939, performed 1946).\n\nDuring the 1930s Lillian Hellman, Clifford Odets, and Langston Hughes wrote plays that exposed injustice in America.\n\nThornton Wilder presented a realistic (and enormously influential) vision of small-town America in Our Town, first produced in 1938.\n\nThe United States, which emerged from World War II confident and economically strong, entered the Cold War in the late 1940s. This conflict with the Soviet Union shaped global politics for more than four decades, and the proxy wars and threat of nuclear annihilation that came to define it were just some of the influences shaping American literature during the second half of the 20th century. The 1950s and ’60s brought significant cultural shifts within the United States driven by the civil rights movement and the women’s rights movement. By the turn of the 21st century, American literature was recognized as being a complex, inclusive story that is grounded on a wide-ranging body of past writings produced in the United States by people of different backgrounds and is open to the experiences of more and more Americans in the present day.\n\nLiterature written by African Americans during the contemporary period was shaped in many ways by Richard Wright, whose autobiography Black Boy was published in 1945. He left the United States for France after World War II, repulsed by the injustice and discrimination he faced as a Black man in America; other Black writers working from the 1950s through the ’70s also wrestled with the desires to escape an unjust society and to change it.\n\nRalph Ellison’s novel Invisible Man (1952) tells the story of an unnamed Black man adrift in, and ignored by, America.\n\nJames Baldwin wrote essays, novels, and plays on race and sexuality throughout his life, but his first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953), was his most accomplished and influential.\n\nLorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun, a play about the effects of racism in Chicago, was first performed in 1959.\n\nGwendolyn Brooks became, in 1950, the first African American poet to win a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThe Black Arts movement was grounded in the tenets of Black nationalism and sought to generate a uniquely Black consciousness. The Autobiography of Malcolm X (1965), by Malcolm X and Alex Haley, is among its most-lasting literary expressions.\n\nToni Morrison’s first novel, The Bluest Eye (1970), launched a writing career that would put the lives of Black women at its center. She received a Nobel Prize in 1993.\n\nIn the 1960s Alice Walker began writing novels, poetry, and short stories that reflected her involvement in the civil rights movement.\n\nThe American novel took on a dizzying number of forms after World War II. Realist, metafictional, postmodern, absurdist, autobiographical, short, long, fragmentary, feminist, stream of consciousness—these and dozens more labels can be applied to the vast output of American novelists. Little holds them together beyond their chronological proximity and engagement with contemporary American society. These are representative novels:\n\nNorman Mailer: The Naked and the Dead (1948), The Executioner’s Song (1979)\n\nVladimir Nabokov: Lolita (1955)\n\nJack Kerouac: On the Road (1957)\n\nThomas Pynchon: The Crying of Lot 49 (1966)\n\nN. Scott Momaday: House Made of Dawn (1968)\n\nKurt Vonnegut: Slaughterhouse-Five (1969)\n\nEudora Welty: The Optimist’s Daughter (1972)\n\nPhilip Roth: Portnoy’s Complaint (1969), American Pastoral (1997)\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin: The Left Hand of Darkness (1969)\n\nSaul Bellow: Humboldt’s Gift (1975)\n\nToni Morrison: Song of Solomon (1977), Beloved (1987)\n\nAlice Walker: The Color Purple (1982)\n\nSandra Cisneros: The House on Mango Street (1983)\n\nJamaica Kincaid: Annie John (1984)\n\nMaxine Hong Kingston: Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book (1989)\n\nDavid Foster Wallace: Infinite Jest (1996)\n\nDon DeLillo: Underworld (1997)\n\nHa Jin: Waiting (1999)\n\nJonathan Franzen: The Corrections (2001)\n\nJunot Díaz: The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007)\n\nColson Whitehead: The Underground Railroad (2016)\n\nOcean Vuong: On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous (2019)\n\nThe Beat movement was short-lived—starting and ending in the 1950s—but had a lasting influence on American poetry during the contemporary period. Allen Ginsberg’s Howl (1956) pushed aside the formal, largely traditional poetic conventions that had come to dominate American poetry. Raucous, profane, and deeply moving, Howl reset Americans’ expectations for poetry during the second half of the 20th century and beyond. Among the important poets of this period are the following:\n\nAnne Sexton\n\nSylvia Plath\n\nJohn Berryman\n\nDonald Hall\n\nElizabeth Bishop\n\nJames Merrill\n\nNikki Giovanni\n\nRobert Pinsky\n\nAdrienne Rich\n\nRita Dove\n\nYusef Komunyakaa\n\nW.S. Merwin\n\nTracy K. Smith\n\nIn the early decades of the contemporary period, American drama was dominated by three men: Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and Edward Albee. Miller’s Death of a Salesman (1949) questioned the American Dream through the destruction of its main character, while Williams’s A Streetcar Named Desire (1947) and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955) excavated his characters’ dreams and frustrations. Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962) rendered what might have been a benign domestic situation into something vicious and cruel. By the 1970s the face of American drama had begun to change, and it continued to diversify into the 21st century. Notable dramatists include:\n\nDavid Mamet\n\nAmiri Baraka\n\nSam Shepard\n\nAugust Wilson\n\nNtozake Shange\n\nWendy Wasserstein\n\nTony Kushner\n\nDavid Henry Hwang\n\nRichard Greenberg\n\nSuzan-Lori Parks\n\nYoung Jean Lee\n\nJeremy O. Harris"
