        "text": "historical timeline of\n\nvaping & electronic cigarettes\n\nCASAA has maintained this historical timeline detailing the history of vaping since January 2010, and it is periodically updated with new events. If you find this information helpful or valuable, please consider donating to CASAA – every little bit helps! Additionally, The Way Back Machine has been an invaluable tool to this project, as it preserves links that no longer exist.\n\nJump to…\n\n1930s-1990s 2003-2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021\n\n1930s - 1990s\n\n1930\n\nThe first documented reference to an electronic cigarette is a patent granted to Joseph Robinson in 1930 (filed in 1927). It was never commercialized and it is not entirely clear that even a prototype of this primitive device was manufactured.\n\n1960s\n\nHerbert A. Gilbert is generally credited with the creation of the first device that closely resembled the modern e-cigarette. He reports receiving a patent in 1965 (filed in 1963) and created prototypes (possibly never including nicotine), but failed to commercialize it. He attributes this failure the companies who might have commercialized it preferring to wait for the patent to expire rather than license it, though it is not clear whether it had commercial potential at the time.\n\n1979\n\nStarting in 1979, Phil Ray, one of the pioneers of computers, worked with his personal physician Norman Jacobson to create the first commercialized variation on the e-cigarette (which was not actually electronic; it relied on evaporation of the nicotine). They performed the first known formal research in the field on nicotine delivery. The commercialization of the product reached major retailers. But the device was never a promising technology for nicotine delivery; Jacobson attributes its failure to it being inherently faulty. While the device proved to be a dead-end, the inventors did contribute the verb \"vape\" to the language.\n\n1990s\n\nNumerous patents for nicotine inhaler devices were filed throughout the 20th century and early 2000s by both tobacco companies and individual inventors, with a flurry of activity in the 1990s. Many relied on evaporation or physical propulsion, but a few were fairly similar to modern e-cigarettes. One chemical-reaction based system that was invented in the 1990s is still in the pipeline. Reynolds brought to market the Eclipse \"heat-not-burn\" device, whose functioning falls somewhere in between that of a pure nicotine inhaler and a combusted cigarette. (See also Philip Morris's Accord.) Products closely resembling modern e-cigarettes moved toward commercialization in the 1990s (example). A major U.S. tobacco company requested permission from FDA (which did not then regulate tobacco products, but did regulate drug delivery devices) to bring a version of an e-cigarette to market c.1998. FDA denied the request on the basis of it being an unapproved drug delivery device. This may explain the disappearance of the attempts to bring an e-cigarette to market, though the history of what happened is rather murky, and the U.S. ruling does not fully explain the disappearance of the technology elsewhere.\n\nlooking for more resources?\n\nMake sure to check out our Information Library, which contains medical studies and articles, news media articles, and opinion pieces on Tobacco Harm Reduction, vaping, and other reduced-harm products.\n\n2003 - 2008\n\n2003\n\nWhat would become the first commercially successful electronic cigarette is created in Beijing, China by Hon Lik, a 52 year old pharmacist, inventor and smoker. He reportedly created the device after his father, also a heavy smoker, dies of lung cancer. (It is not clear the extent to which his was a de novo rederivation of the technology and to what extent he was drawing upon prior art; he failed to cite much prior art in his patent applications.) The company Lik worked for, Golden Dragon Holdings, developed the device and changed its name to Ruyan, which means \"like smoke.\"\n\nApril 2006\n\nElectronic cigarettes introduced to Europe.\n\nAug 2006\n\nElectronic cigarettes introduced to the U.S. (The first import ruling locatable in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website database is dated August 22, 2006. NY M85579)\n\nMarch 2008\n\nTurkey’s Health Ministry suspends the sale of e-cigarettes. Health Ministry Drugs and Pharmacy Director, Mahmut Tokaç, claims electronic cigarettes are just as harmful as regular cigarettes. The vice president of the Foundation Combating Smoking in Turkey, Kiyas Güngör, claims that \"nicotine is the most dangerous element among 4,800 poisonous chemicals in cigarettes.\" (See discussion here re 2008 decision. Currently, e-cigarettes cannot be sold in stores in Turkey although they can be purchased online. Actual legal status at present is unclear.)\n\nSept 2008\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) proclaims that it does not consider the electronic cigarette to be a legitimate smoking cessation aid and demands that marketers immediately remove from their materials any suggestions that the WHO considers electronic cigarettes safe and effective. (See WHO September 19, 2008 press release here.)\n\nOct 2008\n\nIn a study funded by Ruyan, Health New Zealand conducts a detailed quantitative analysis and concludes that carcinogens and toxicants are present only below harmful levels. On the basis of the findings, the e-cigarette is rated several orders of magnitude (100 to 1000 times) less dangerous than smoking tobacco cigarettes. The nicotine dose is comparable to that of a medicinal nicotine inhaler. Overall, the product tested was deemed a \"safe alternative to smoking.\"\n\n2009\n\nJan 2009\n\nAustralia bans the possession and sale of electronic cigarettes which contain nicotine, citing that \"every form of nicotine except for replacement therapies and cigarettes are classified as a form of poison.\" (See NDPSC record of reasons, 54th meeting, 14-15 October 2008 and download provided here.)\n\nJordan’s Ministry of Health bans the import of the electronic cigarettes, citing World Health Organization’s health concerns. (See discussion here.) In a February 2012 review of the ban, Malek Habashneh, director of the ministry’s awareness and communication directorate, claims that \"e-cigarettes contain toxic chemicals that cause more health problems than the nicotine in normal cigarettes.\"\n\nMarch 2009\n\nFDA adds electronic cigarettes to Import Alert 66-41 and directs the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to reject the entry of electronic cigarettes into the United States on the basis of them being unapproved drug delivery devices. (See pp. 12-13 here.) (At this time FDA had gained authority over tobacco products, but this ruling came not from their nascent Center for Tobacco Products, but from their Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.)\n\nCanada bans the sale, advertising and import of electronic cigarettes. Health Canada advises Canadians not to purchase or use them, claiming they contain a \"known irritant\" (propylene glycol). (See Health Canada's advisory here.)\n\nHong Kong Department of Health bans electronic cigarettes. The maximum penalty for possessing or selling e-cigarettes is a HK$100,000 fine and two years' imprisonment. Since smoke-free tobacco is prohibited in Hong Kong, the ban on e-cigarettes continues to leave high-risk cigarettes as the only legal tobacco product available. (Information on current legal status of e-cigarettes in Hong Kong can be found here.)\n\nFDA notifies electronic cigarette company \"Smoking Everywhere\" that its shipments have been refused entry into the U.S. The FDA maintains that electronic cigarettes \"appears to be a combination drug-device product\" that require pre-approval, registration and listing with the FDA. (See pp. 10-11 here.)\n\nApril 2009\n\nSmoking Everywhere files a federal complaint on April 28, 2009 seeking an injunction against the FDA with respect to the FDA's attempts to ban the import of electronic cigarettes. Smoking Everywhere contends that the FDA has no authority over electronic cigarettes, as they are a \"tobacco product,\" and the FDA's attempt to regulate them infringes on Congress's intent to withhold FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products. Smoking Everywhere contends that electronic cigarettes are not \"drugs,\" \"drug delivery systems,\" or \"drug device combinations\" under 21 U.S.C 321(g).\n\nIn a study funded by Ruyan, Health New Zealand conducts a detailed quantitative analysis and concludes that carcinogens and toxicants are present only below harmful levels. Bench-top test results presented as a poster at SRNT poster at SRNT in Dublin April 30, 2009. (Click here to download the poster.)\n\nMay 2009\n\nAction on Smoking and Health in the United States (ASH-US) files a petition to the FDA calling for FDA regulation of electronic cigarettes.\n\nNJOY (Sottera) joins Smoking Everywhere's lawsuit against FDA.\n\nThe Electronic Cigarette Association (ECA) is formed. The ECA (now defunct) is a trade association made up of electronic cigarette producers, distributors and retailers; whose aim is to speak on behalf of the electronic cigarette industry, especially in response to health concerns, and to help institute industry standards. The group is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Its president and spokesman is former United States congressman Matt Salmon. (See video statement from ECA here and ECA's brochure on e-cigarettes here. Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association (TVECA) claims to be ECA's successor.\n\nFDA files memorandum in opposition to Smoking Everywhere's complaint on May 11, 2009.\n\nFDA tests 2 brands of electronic cigarettes, NJOY & Smoking Everywhere. 18 cartridges are tested. Tests reveal trace amounts of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) in the liquid in levels comparable to those found in FDA-approved nicotine cessation products. The liquid of one cartridge is found to contain a non-toxic amount (approximately 1%) diethylene glycol. TSNAs nor diethylene glycol is detected in the vapor. Some cartridges labeled as 0mg nicotine are shown to contain trace amounts of nicotine.\n\nJune 2009\n\nPresident Obama signs into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the FDA the power to regulate the tobacco industry. Although nicotine and cigarettes as a whole cannot be banned outright, flavoring such as fruit or mint can. Additionally, new tobacco products seeking to enter the market will be required to meet FDA pre-market standards, which could affect electronic cigarette regulation.\n\nPanama bans the importation, distribution and sale of electronic cigarettes.\n\nJuly 2009\n\nFDA files a supplemental brief in the Smoking Everywhere lawsuit referencing the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The FDA contends that it still has authority over electronic cigarettes and FDA stands behind the decision to label it a drug-device combination. \"FDA found, after examining the product, the claims made in the product labeling, and information SE submitted to FDA, that SE's product met the definition of both a drug and device under the FDCA.\"\n\nTwo months after testing, the FDA issues a press release discouraging the use of electronic cigarettes and repeating previously stated concerns that electronic cigarettes may be marketed to young people, lack appropriate health warnings and that they contain carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as diethylene glycol, an ingredient used in antifreeze. The FDA did not reveal that the carcinogens found were similar to those found at the same levels in FDA-approved nicotine cessation products, nor that the amount of diethylene glycol found would not be toxic. The FDA also did not disclose that neither substance was found in the actual vapor to which the user is exposed.\n\nFDA's May 2009 study is reviewed by scientific consulting firm Exponent, Inc., in a report commissioned by NJOY. Some of the criticisms of the FDA study, as set forth in Exponent's report, are poor standards of documentation and analysis and failure to perform relevant comparisons to FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapy products, which Exponent claims contain TSNA levels comparable to those of electronic cigarettes. The study concludes that the FDA's claims of potential adverse health effects were not supported by the study.\n\nIsraeli Health Ministry considers banning e-cigarette sales and importation. (The ban discussed here in 2009 was never implemented, although in 2013, it was reported that Israel was considering either a ban or tobacco classification.)\n\nAug 2009\n\nIn a Washington Times op-ed, Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, president of the American Council on Science and Health, calls the FDA press statement about electronic cigarettes \"distorted, incomplete and misleading\" and meant to \"scare Americans\" to stay \"away from these newfangled, untested cigarette substitutes -- better to stick with the real ones.\"\n\nThe State of Oregon announces two settlements have been reached that prevent two national travel store chains, Pilot Travel Centers and TA Operating, from selling NJOY electronic cigarettes. In addition, the company must give the Attorney General advance notice that they intend to sell electronic cigarettes in Oregon, provide copies of all electronic cigarette advertising, and provide copies of the scientific studies they maintain substantiates their claims. NJOY voluntarily stops all sales in Oregon.\n\nOregon Attorney General John Kroger announces a lawsuit against Smoking Everywhere, alleging that the Florida-based company made false health claims about its nicotine delivery device and targeted children with sweet flavors. Smoking Everywhere refuses to settle. (Smoking Everywhere eventually settled in August 2010.)\n\nBrazil bans the sale, importation and advertisement of electronic cigarettes. (See resolution here.)\n\nSuffolk County, NY passes first legislation banning indoor use of electronic cigarette in areas where smoking is also prohibited and bans sales to persons under age 19.\n\nSaudi Arabia bans sales of electronic cigarettes based on the statement made by the US Food and Drug Administration which had said [e-cigarettes] \"contain harmful carcinogenic and toxic substances, notably diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical used in antifreeze.\" (This ban continues today, as discussed here.)\n\nSept 2009\n\nAmicus curiae brief filed by Alliance of Electronic Smokers (AES) in support of the plaintiff in the Smoking Everywhere v. FDA lawsuit.\n\nAmicus curiae brief filed by ASH (US) in support of defendant FDA.\n\nCalifornia passes a bill to ban the sales of electronic cigarettes in the state. Governor Schwarzenegger vetoes the bill stating, \"If adults want to purchase and consume these products with an understanding of the associated health risks, they should be able to do so unless and until federal law changes the legal status of these tobacco products.\"\n\nSept/Oct 2009\n\nAmazon.com prohibits sale of electronic tobacco products on its website. (See discussion here.)\n\nOct 2009\n\nConsumer Advocates for Smoke-free Alternatives Association (CASAA) forms and board members elected. The organization is made up of both consumers and retailers, with the mission to ensure the availability of effective, affordable and reduced harm alternatives to smoking by increasing public awareness and education; to encourage the testing and development of products to achieve acceptable safety standards and reasonable regulation; and to promote the benefits of reduced harm alternatives. In order to ensure CASAA is first and foremost a consumer-based organization, the number of vendors elected to the board is limited so that consumer board members control a super majority.\n\nUK ASH recognizes that products should be made available that deliver nicotine in a safe way, without the harmful components found in tobacco, but those attempting to quit should use conventional NRTs. (For a copy of UK ASH's October 2009 briefing, click here. The current flyer, updated February 2016, can be found here.)\n\nPayPal freezes accounts of electronic cigarette vendors in the U.S. and prohibits them from using the service; however, vendors outside of the U.S. are allowed to continue using PayPal for electronic cigarette sales. (See discussion here and here.)\n\nNov 2009\n\nNew Jersey State legislators pass a bill including electronic cigarettes in the state's public smoking ban.\n\nDec 2009\n\nNJOY announces it is discontinuing, in the U.S., the availability of all flavors except its traditional tobacco flavor and menthol. The move aligns the flavors offered by NJOY with those allowed for combustible tobacco cigarettes under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. (NJOY's corporate policy on flavors changed in 2014 with, among other things, its release of a premium line of e-liquid, as discussed here.)\n\n2010\n\nJan 2010\n\nOn January 14, 2010, Judge Leon grants the injunction sought by Smoking Everywhere/Sottera prohibiting the FDA from seizing e-cigarettes as drug or drug/device combinations. Judge Leon issues a 32-page memorandum opinion explaining the ruling.\n\nMarch 2010\n\nAppellate Court grants the FDA's request for a stay of Judge Leon's injunction pending appeal. (See discussion here.)\n\nThe American Association of Public Health Physicians submits two Citizen Petitions to the FDA, one asking for reclassification of e-cigarettes to \"tobacco product\" and the other asking for a follow up statement to the July 2009 press conference. (See here and here for Citizen Petitions.)\n\nFirst Vapefest™ is held in Richmond, VA\n\nMinistry of Public Health bans the import and sale of electronic cigarettes in Thailand. It warns \"the cigarettes contained more nicotine than normal ones.\" (See discussion here on the issue and also see 2014 ban on import by Ministry of Commerce.)\n\nApril 2010\n\nCASAA and others help persuade Illinois legislators not to pass SB 3174, a law which would ban the sale of e-cigarettes in the state.\n\nMay 2010\n\nFDA files appellant brief in Smoking Everywhere v. FDA case (U.S. Court of Appeals for District of Columbia).\n\nCoalition files amicus brief in the Smoking Everywhere v. FDA case supporting FDA's position. Coalition members include American Academy of Pediatrics, American Cancer Society, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Heart Association, American Legacy Foundation, American Lung Association, American Medical Association, and Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\nJune 2010\n\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA) House of Delegates (HOD) passes a policy urging the FDA to regulate e-cigarettes as drug delivery devices.\n\nSottera (NJOY) files Appellee brief in Smoking Everywhere v.

FDA case (U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit).\n\nCASAA joins other e-cigarette and reduced-harm smokeless alternative proponents in filing an amicus brief in the Smoking Everywhere v. FDA case. Other amicus curiae named on the brief include Smokefree Pennsylvania, The American Council on Science and Health, National Vapers Club, Midwest Vapers Group, Michael Siegel, MD, MPH, and Joel Nitzkin, MD, MPH, DPA.\n\nWashington Legal Foundation (WLF) files amicus brief in the Smoking Everywhere v. FDA case.\n\nAug 2010\n\nOregon’s Attorney General John Kroger announces a settlement preventing the two national travel store chains from selling e-cigarettes.

However, any e-cigarette products advertising claims of helping the user to stop smoking or providing any other health benefit will be more strictly regulated as a drug or medical device.\n\nMay 2011\n\nArgentina passes resolution 3226/2011 banning the importation, distribution, commercialization and advertising of e-cigarettes and paraphernalia related to them. (See here for an unofficial translation followed by a copy of the original untranslated document.)\n\nJune 2011\n\nFirst Vapestock held in Clearwater Beach, FL.\n\nAug 2011\n\nStudy published in the journal \"Addiction\" provides strong evidence that electronic cigarettes are being used with success by many smokers to quit smoking or cut down substantially on the number of cigarettes they consume, and that e-cigarettes are being used with success by many ex-smokers to remain off cigarettes.\n\nSept 2011\n\nThe Obama administration proposes banning the use of electronic cigarettes on airline flights, saying the \"new rule would enhance passenger comfort and reduce any confusion.\" The Department of Transportation says that although it considers electronic cigarettes to be covered under the existing law banning smoking on airplanes, it intends to adopt a rule specifically banning them in the summer of 2012. (See Joint Comment filed by CASAA and Competitive Enterprise Institute, filed November 2011.)\n\nPetition to the White House filed. While CASAA did not create the petition, CASAA urged its members to sign in order to reach the minimum threshold of 5,000 signatures, which it did. Response received December 15, 2011 which was largely non-responsive.\n\nOct 2011\n\nThe British Cabinet Office’s Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) strongly endorses tobacco harm reduction in its first annual report. E-cigarettes are cited as potentially effective substitutes because of their behavioral attributes. (See news article here and actual report here.)\n\nFirst VaperCon is held in Richmond, VA\n\nThe results of the first clinical trial of electronic cigarettes, reported in the journal BMC Public Health, suggests e-cigarettes may be more effective than traditional NRT products for smoking cessation and may be particularly effective in smokers who are not motivated to quit.\n\nNov 2011\n\nCASAA and Competitive Enterprise Institute file a comment regarding the Department of Transportation proposal to amend its existing airline smoking rule to explicitly ban the use of electronic cigarettes on all aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate, intrastate and foreign air transportation. This regulation would impose fines of up to $3,300 for \"smoking\" an e-cigarette on an airplane. Those who use an e-cigarette would be treated exactly as if they were smoking a combusted tobacco product. See also comment from Smoke-free Pennsylvania.\n\nDec 2011\n\nHolland's Minister of Health, announces that the sale and import of electronic cigarettes is banned. E-cigarette sales will require a pharmaceutical license. (See discussion here.)\n\nThe health minister of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia announces that the state government has determined that e-cigarettes and their cartridges fall under regulations concerning medicines and medical products.

The petition gained the required number of signatures (25,000), and a response from FDA was published in April 2014, which advocates characterized as largely non-responsive. (FDA's response can be seen here.) This is the second community-supported White House petition effort, the first being in 2011 when the threshold for signatures was 5,000.\n\nMarch 2013\n\nAmerican E-Liquid Manufacturing Association (AEMSA) attends its first listening session with FDA.\n\nApril 2013\n\nSenators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Jack Reed (D-RI) send a letter to FDA urging FDA to issue deeming regulations to exert regulatory authority over cigars, pipe tobacco, electronic cigarettes, and dissolvable tobacco products.\n\nMay 2013\n\nCASAA launches its Testimonials Project to collect success stories from smokers who used smoke-free alternatives to quit or reduce their smoking. This public collection of success stories was created as a powerful response to those who want to restrict access to e-cigarettes and other smoke-free products. CASAA's goal is to present a large collection of compelling individual reports that will make it impossible for anyone to claim that substitution of low-risk alternatives (e-cigarettes, snus, and other smoke-free tobacco/nicotine products) is not a proven method for quitting smoking.\n\nJune 2013\n\nR.J. Reynolds announces new vapor product, VUSE, will be launched in July in Colorado as the first state in an eventual nationwide rollout.\n\nThe U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency announces it will regulate e-cigarettes as medicines when new European tobacco laws come into force.

Van Heerden (October 2013) that Van Heerden did not violate S106(a) of the Tobacco Products Control Act 2006 (WA) (the \"Act\"). The matter was appealed by Hawkins, a compliance officer with the Department of Health, to the Supreme Court of Western Australia, which court ruled in April 2014 that Vince Van Heerden violated the Act by selling products (electronic cigarettes) designed to resemble a tobacco product. Van Heerden appealed that decision to the Court of Appeal, but the appeal was dismissed in March 2016, meaning that it remains illegal in Western Australia to sell vapor product devices, regardless of whether they contain nicotine. (We note that the vapor products in question were described as \"510-T\" and \"eGo-T,\" which one would not describe as looking like traditional combustible cigarettes or cigars.)

TPSAC could not reach a consensus. Among other things, Swedish Match proposed replacing the warning that \"This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes\" with the statement, \"No tobacco product is safe, but this product presents substantially lower risks to health than cigarettes.\" Four of the eight TPSAC members felt that the evidence presented did not support the alternate warning label.\n\nMay 2015\n\nIndiana passes HB 1432, which, among other things, prohibits e-liquid manufacturers (whether in-state or out-of-state) from selling products to retailers and distributors in Indiana without a permit. (See CASAA Indiana Call to Action issued in March 2015 for more details.) The permit would require compliance with burdensome and expensive manufacturing and security protocols that may be impossible to meet. Of particular concern, these requirements only apply to e-cigarette refill liquid used in open-system products and specifically do not apply to closed-system products (i.e., cigalikes). In response, a federal lawsuit was filed in May of 2015 by two out-of-state manufacturers and an in-state vendor.

We also implore that the final rule not move the 'grandfather date' for new products (set at February 15, 2007). Altering this grandfather date would exempt a wide range of e-cigarettes and related products from any premarket review to determine whether they constitute threats to public health.\"\n\nNov 2015\n\nFDA grants PMTA approval to eight Swedish Match smokeless tobacco products. According to the FDA press release, \"This action permits the tobacco products to be sold in the U.S., but does not mean that they are safe or 'FDA approved.'” (See analysis by Carl Phillips here.)\n\nSeveral lawsuits filed, including (1) a class action lawsuit against Five Pawns, Inc. involving the presence of diacetyl and acetyl propionyl in their e-liquids and alleged failure to disclose or properly warn consumers, and (2) two lawsuits (here and here) filed by Center for Environmental Health (CEH) against various e-cigarette companies alleging California Proposition 65 violations. CEH reports that it has filed lawsuits against a total of 60 e-cigarette companies, only one of which was settled.

Moreover, the analysis used cross-sectional data, so researchers acknowledged they “could not conclude that the presence of e-cigarettes in the marketplace caused a change (or lack thereof) in the prevalence of cigarette smoking.” Because of the cross-sectional nature of the data, they also ”could not determine whether dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes initiated use with cigarettes or e-cigarettes.”\n\nAn analysis by The Health Information and Quality Authority in Ireland finds that \"increased uptake of e-cigarettes as an aid to quitting would increase the number of people who successfully quit compared with the existing situation in Ireland and would be cost-effective.\" (January 5, 2017)\n\nThe British American Tobacco company (BAT) announces it will not market a nicotine inhaler it was developing called the \"Voke,\" and instead plans to focus on vapor products.

The bill aims to modernize the 2007 predicate date for vapor products newly deemed to be tobacco by the FDA. (March 8, 2017)\n\nPublic health researchers from the University at Buffalo and the University of Michigan, writing in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, find that national trends in vaping and cigarette smoking do not support the argument that vaping is a “gateway” to smoking. (March 13, 2017)\n\nA study funded by Cancer Research UK, the first to explore the effects of e-cigarettes by looking at long-term human body-level exposure, concluded that e-cigarette-only and NRT-only users had significantly lower levels of toxins and carcinogens (found in their urine and saliva) than people who smoke cigarettes. E-cigarette-only users had significantly lower NNAL levels than all other groups, including NRT-only users. (March 21, 2017)\n\nMaine lawmakers pass LD 1170, which prohibits the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 21 years old.

The press release for the study was widely viewed as more of an advertisement for a new 3-D printed testing device. Critics of the study pointed out earlier research from the UK that found people using e-cigarettes only had significantly lower levels of carcinogens than people who smoked. Carl Alexander, Cancer Research UK’s health information officer, stated \"[The University of Connecticut] study is about the development of a new way of looking at DNA damage, and only looked at the effects of e-cigarette vapour on DNA in the lab, not in people.

Compared with cigarette smokers, e-cigarette users waited longer to start using their product after waking up. Vapers were less likely to consider themselves addicted, to have strong cravings, or to feel like they really needed their product. They were also less likely to say they found it difficult to refrain from using their product in restricted places. Researchers reported their findings in Preventive Medicine.\n\nKansas (pop. 2.909 million) passes legislation reducing the state’s 20¢/mL tax on e-liquid to 5¢ per mL tax.\n\nJuly 2017\n\nThis is the heading\n\nFDA announces intent to extend timelines to submit tobacco product review applications for newly regulated tobacco products that were on the market as of August 8, 2016 to August 2021 for combustible products and August 2022 for vapor and smoke-free products. This announcement suggested the change to more harm reduction-friendly leadership in the agency.\n\nIn the same announcement, the agency also said it will review nicotine levels in cigarettes and “kid-appealing” flavors in tobacco and vapor products, and that it would “make the product review process more efficient, predictable, and transparent for manufacturers.”\n\nA study from the University of California, San Diego, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), finds that 65% of people who smoke who used e-cigarettes attempted to quit smoking. At the same time, only 40% of those who did not use e-cigarettes tried to quit smoking.\n\nThe study looked at data on the smoking habits of more than 160,000 Americans. Study authors found that around 8 percent of people who smoke who used e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking were successful. By comparison, only ~5% of people who didn’t vape were able to quit.\n\nThe study further suggested that e-cigarettes, rather than other factors like higher taxes or anti-tobacco campaigns, were responsible for an increased rate of quitting.\n\nDelaware (pop. 956,823) passes HB 242, which imposes a 5¢ per milliliter tax on e-liquid, redefines \"tobacco product\" to include vapor products, and requires vapor retailers to obtain a license.\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee approves legislation that would ‘grandfather’ vapor products introduced to market prior to August 8, 2016. Grandfathered products would be exempt from FDA’s premarket review (PMTA). This legislation (HR 3268, Sec. 753) is included in, but ultimately stripped out of, the 2018 omnibus budget bill.\n\nThe state of New York bans the use of vapor devices on school grounds (S.750).\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court upholds a Department of Transportation rule banning the use of vapor products on planes. The department justifies the ban by pointing to a previous rule prohibiting “smoking” on passenger flights, and another requiring airlines to “provide safe and adequate interstate air transportation.” CASAA and the Competitive Enterprise Institute asked the D.C. Circuit to review the rule, arguing that Congress could not have imagined e-cigarette technology when it made it illegal to smoke on planes. Therefore, by implementing the new rule the Department of Transportation exceeded its authority.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court rules that the Food and Drug Administration can deem vapor products to be “tobacco products.” Two separate Washington lawsuits filed by vapor product manufacturers and industry and consumer associations challenged the rule as arbitrary and capricious, saying the FDA had exceeded its authority because the products didn’t meet the statutory definition of a tobacco product.\n\nNew Jersey (pop. 8.88 million) passes Tobacco and Vapor 21.\n\nAug 2017\n\nThis is the heading\n\nFDA announces plans to expand its “The Real Cost” public education campaign to include messaging to teens about the dangers of using vapor products, marking the first time the FDA would be utilizing a media campaign to specifically target youth vaping.\n\nOregon passes Tobacco and Vapor 21 (SB 754), raising the age to purchase tobacco or vapor products to 21.\n\nAction on Smoking and Health (UK) announces results of a study of the largest ever analysis of data, in a collaboration between UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, Public Health England, ASH and the DECIPHer Centre at the University of Cardiff, showed no evidence that e-cigarettes are leading young people into smoking.\n\nA study by the Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, funded by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and published in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research, found that using e-cigarettes for at least five days in a month increased the odds of quitting smoking by 59%, and using them at least 20 days more than doubled the odds.\n\nA study in the UK concludes that young people who use e-cigarettes are nearly four times more likely to start smoking cigarettes than their non-vaping peers. However, researchers admit they could not confirm a causal relationship between vaping and future smoking and that the trends observed over the same time period in the UK ran contrary to their findings. Between 2014 and 2015, rates of e-cigarette use in the UK increased, but smoking prevalence continued to decline.\n\nResearchers at Columbia University and Rutgers University published a paper in the journal Addictive Behaviors looking at how patterns of quitting smoking have changed across the US since vapor products were introduced in 2010. The observational study found that, among the roughly 15,500 adults the researchers looked at, those who said they used vapor products daily were far more likely to have quit regular cigarettes than the people who said they'd never vaped. Over half of daily vapers had quit smoking in the past five years, compared to just 28% of those who had never tried them.\n\nNew York City (pop. 8.56 million) passes a tobacco retail licensing law (Int 1532-2017) requiring anyone selling vapor products to obtain a license. The new law is designed to cap the number of licenses available and reduce them by half as businesses close down. Vapor retailers are given 90 days to acquire the new license, after which no new licenses will be issued. Vapor retailers in NYC number in the hundreds while more than 9000 tobacco licenses exist for shops selling cigarettes. (Information for Tobacco and/or Electronic Cigarette Retail Dealers, nyc .gov)\n\nSept 2017\n\nThis is the heading\n\nA small, 15 subject study in Sweden found that non-smokers who used vapor products containing nicotine had temporarily stiffened arteries, which is linked to increased risk of heart disease. However, the subjects were compared to those who had no nicotine in their vapor product, but not compared to cigarette smoking, which has previously been demonstrated to cause arterial stiffness. While the study demonstrated a possible increased risk for non-smokers, it did not address the harm reduction potential for smokers. People who smoke are frequently advised to use FDA-approved nicotine products, which could have very similar, temporary effects on arteries as the nicotine in vapor products.\n\nDavid Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA study finds that healthy non-smokers experienced increased adrenaline levels in their hearts after one electronic cigarette with nicotine. Higher levels of adrenaline in the heart can lead to an increased heart rate and high blood pressure.\n\nHowever, researchers also found that nicotine-free vapor products had no effect. Additionally, oxidative stress, which increases risks for atherosclerosis and heart attack, showed no changes after exposure to e-cigarettes with and without nicotine.\n\nConcern over the findings are relevant in respect to use by non-smokers, but should be weighed against the known risks of smoking. Given the lack of clinical outcomes data suggesting harm from using NRT products in patients with CV disease, if risk does exist, it is likely small and outweighed by the benefits of smoking cessation.\n\nOct 2017\n\nThis is the heading\n\nThe state of New York (pop. 19.59 million) bans the use of vapor products where smoking is prohibited. Researchers from Georgetown University Medical Center announce that their study, published in the journal Tobacco Control, estimates 6.6 million early deaths in America might be averted over 10 years if people who smoked switched to e-cigarettes, and recommended that the devices should be adopted as part of an “endgame for cigarette smoking.”\n\nA British Psychological Society report, \"Changing behaviour: Electronic cigarettes,\" recommends vapor products be promoted for smoking cessation. Additionally, the report advises to avoid taxation and 'vape-free' legislation, promote unrestricted advertising of factual information, promote product development, invest in research to continue to explore the effects of e-cigarettes on smoking cessation and to determine which factors promote a successful transition.\n\nThe FDA finalizes guidance to the tobacco and vapor industry regarding free samples, “The Prohibition of Distributing Free Samples of Tobacco Products.” In the 10-page document, the agency said that its ban on free samples of tobacco products applies to any tobacco product that is subject to FDA regulation, including components and parts of tobacco products like \"e-liquids\" and the refillable cartridges for electronic cigarettes. This creates confusion in the vapor industry regarding the practice of allowing customers to taste-test different flavors, resulting in many vape shops to only use nicotine-free liquids for testing.\n\nA study from researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill published findings suggesting that e-cigarette use could trigger immune responses in the lung that could contribute to inflammatory lung diseases. However, the study was small and limited, with the authors noting that most of the e-cigarette cohort were formerly cigarette smokers, making it difficult to clearly identify whether these results were solely related to e-cigarette use.\n\nNov 2017\n\nThis is the heading\n\nA prospective 3.5-year study of people who vape daily but never smoked cigarettes is published in the journal Scientific Reports. The study concludes that “While the sample size was small, the results of this study may provide some preliminary evidence that long-term use of ECs is unlikely to raise significant health concerns in relatively young users.”\n\nNew York’s ban on vaping in public indoor places and workplaces takes effect on November 22.\n\nDec 2017\n\nThis is the heading\n\nA study by the Medical University of South Carolina, funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, found that when the subjects who smoked used e-cigarettes, they smoked less and were more likely to quit smoking, as compared to those in the control group. Additionally, of the two e-cigarette models used in the study, the more powerful device, with a higher dose of nicotine, showed stronger outcomes.\n\nA study by the University of Pittsburgh, published in the American Journal of Medicine, found that among young adults (18 – 30 years old) who didn’t smoke cigarettes, the ones who had used electronic cigarettes were more than four times as likely than non-vaping peers to start smoking traditional tobacco cigarettes within 18 months. Researchers didn’t ask why the adults started vaping in the first place or if they had any intention of smoking prior to getting a vapor product. The study did not examine why vapers were more likely to switch to tobacco, but critics suggested the findings might have been skewed by not accounting for people who otherwise would have begun smoking regular tobacco regardless of their e-cig usage.\n\n2018\n\nJan 2018\n\nA report of National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) identified and examined more than 800 peer-reviewed scientific studies and offered 47 conclusions on a range of health impacts.

By the end of 2019, an estimated 4.8 million middle and high school students reported they currently use e-cigarettes.\n\nNov 2018\n\nThis is the heading\n\nFDA releases limited information from the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), announcing current (past 30 day) use of vapor products among US high school students has increased 78% since 2017. Vaping advocates criticize the agency for withholding and/or downplaying other data not available for public inspection, such as the actual smoking rates for conventional cigarettes and daily use vs. experimentation.\n\nFDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gotlieb, announces a proposal, based on data from the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) showing increased youth use, to have \"all flavored ENDS products (other than tobacco, mint and menthol flavors or non-flavored products) sold in age-restricted, in-person locations and, if sold online, under heightened practices for age verification.\"\n\nDec 2018\n\nThis is the heading\n\nUS Surgeon General, Jerome Adams, issues a public advisory, calling for actions such as including e-cigarettes in smoke-free indoor air policies, restricting young peoples’ access to vapor products in retail settings, licensing retailers, implementing price policies (presumably increased taxes,) curbing advertising and marketing that are appealing to young people, and reducing access to flavored tobacco products.\n\nA study published in the journal JAMA Network Open, which was funded and overseen by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, and the FDA Center for Tobacco Products, looked at the concentrations of 50 biomarkers that showed exposure to tobacco-related toxicants in over 5,000 US adults. Subjects of the study were categorized by status as cigarette-only smokers, e-cigarette-only users, dual users and those who used neither. Researchers concluded that exposures in vaping-only subjects were \"generally at lower levels than cigarette smoking,\" while dual use had the greatest exposures.\n\nSubsequent review of the complete data found that the overall exposure in vaping-only subjects was not just \"lower,\" but significantly and strikingly lower than in people who smoke and those who smoke and vape (so called dual users). Exposure to tobacco-related toxicants among vaping-only subjects was nearly as low as exposure among participants who did not smoke or vape at all.\n\nTobacco company Altria purchases a 35% stake in Juul vapor products worth $12.8 billion.\n\nThe 2018 Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey, a nationally representative sample of eighth, 10th and 12th graders in schools nationwide, is released. Reported use of vaping nicotine by teens, specifically in the 30 days prior to the survey, was “in record numbers.” The survey also shows regular tobacco use by teens was still at its lowest point in the survey since it began measuring it.\n\nMassachusetts raises the age to purchase tobacco and vapor products to adults over the age of 21 years old.\n\nThe FDA announces two new requirements for the sale of vapor products.\n\n2019\n\nJan 2019\n\nA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, finds that e-cigarettes are nearly twice as effective as conventional nicotine replacement products, like patches and gum, for quitting smoking.\n\n\"The New England Journal devoted much of its current issue to e-cigarettes, publishing two editorials and a letter, and the collection embodies the tangled public health debate over the devices. One editorial — written by Belinda Borrelli, a behavioral health expert and Dr. George T. O’Connor, a pulmonologist — pumped the brakes on inclinations to embrace e-cigarettes.\"\n\nA study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Risk of Stroke With E-Cigarette and Combustible Cigarette Use in Young Adults, finds that, “Compared with nonsmokers, current sole e-cigarette users did not show significantly different odds of stroke.” and “odds of stroke were lower for sole e-cigarette users versus current sole combustible cigarette users.”\n\nAn analysis published in the Oxford Nicotine and Tobacco Research journal, E-cigarettes: Comparing the Possible Risks of Increasing Smoking Initiation with the Potential Benefits of Increasing Smoking Cessation concludes that “the upside health benefit associated with e-cigarettes, in terms of their potential to increase adult smoking cessation, exceeds their downside risk to health as a result of their possibly increasing the number of youthful smoking initiators. Public messaging and policy should continue to strive to reduce young people's exposure to all nicotine and tobacco products. But, they should not do so at the expense of limiting such products' potential to help adult smokers to quit.”\n\nThe FDA holds a public hearing titled “Eliminating Youth Electronic Cigarette and Other Tobacco Product Use: The Role for Drug Therapies” to “discuss the effort to eliminate youth electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use as well as other tobacco product use, with a focus on the potential role of drug therapies to support cessation and the issues impacting the development of such therapies.”\n\nAt this meeting, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb states that he is concerned by youth vaping rates, claiming data from the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey confirm that youth use of e-cigarettes has become an “epidemic.” During the hearing Mr. Gottlieb states, “I'll tell you this If the youth use continues to rise and we see significant increases in use in 2019 on top of what we found in 2018, I believe this entire category will face an existential threat.”\n\nNOTE: When finally released to the public later in the year, the 2018 survey data actually revealed that less than 5.8% of all high school student reported vaping frequently (ie. on 20 or more days of the past month,) while past 30-day cigarette smoking had declined to a record low 8.1%.\n\nFeb 2019\n\nThis is the heading\n\nAn abstract presented at the 2019 American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference in Honolulu reported an association between e-cigarette use and stroke, heart attack, and heart disease. But, while this abstract was widely reported in the media as evidence of high risk associated with vaping, the researchers based their conclusions on looking at subjects who reported “ever use” and the vast majority of those who reported ever using e-cigarettes were currently or formerly smoking. This confounding factor (smoking history) created a spurious correlation between vaping and stroke, heart attack, and heart disease, as smoking itself (both current and past) could not be ruled out as the actual cause of the increased risk.\n\nCDC Vital Signs reports youth “tobacco use” is rising because of vaping. At the same time, youth smoking rates reached another historic low.\n\nA “2-group, pragmatic, multicenter, individually randomized, controlled trial” published in New England Journal of Medicine (Hajek P, Phillips-Waller A, Dunja P, et al. A randomized trial of e-cigarettes versus nicotine-replacement therapy) finds vaping is nearly twice as effective as nicotine-replacement therapy to help individuals quit smoking. Researchers found that 80% of participants in the e-cigarette group were more likely to continue using their product at 1 year compared to 9.0% in the nicotine-replacement group.\n\nThe Military Times reports vaping has surpassed smoking among troops.\n\nU.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) introduces the E-cigarette Youth Protection Act, requiring vapor product companies to help fund federal prevention efforts and regulation enforcement. The Act requires vapor product manufacturers to pay a user fee to fund efforts to increase public awareness of the alleged “risks” of vaping, in particular outreach to youth, as well as enforcing regulations, which includes recently imposed rules that ban flavored products being sold in retail settings and imposing heightened age verification standards online. These fees on e-cigarette manufacturers would be assessed based on each company’s U.S. market share.\n\nJUUL releases a poster summary of a clinical trial comparing people who exclusively used its devices against people who smoked traditional cigarettes.
