        "text": "Learn About Clinical Research\n\nWhy participate in a clinical trial? Because it can help you while also helping others.\n\nClinical trials make finding new and improved medicines possible. And we can’t conduct trials without help from people like you. Every clinical trial participant provides valuable information that might help advance medical research and knowledge.\n\nPeople take part in clinical trials for many reasons. For some, it’s the chance to help find cures and treatments that will benefit people in the future. It can also offer study-related health monitoring.\n\nLooking for more details on what to expect from our clinical trials? Find more information here.\n\nYou can also learn about our commitment to diversity in clinical trials here.\n\nClinical Trials Transparency\n\nWe have a history of transparency when it comes to our clinical studies. In 2004, we became the first company to voluntarily disclose our clinical studies initiation and post-study results in a publicly available registry.\n\nSince the start of 2014, we have enhanced our transparency initiatives to align with the PhRMA/EFPIA Principles for Responsible Clinical Trial Data Sharing. We recognize that sharing clinical study data can enhance public health. But responsibly sharing that data is necessary to safeguard the privacy of patients, respect the integrity of national regulatory systems, and maintain incentives for investments in biomedical research.\n\nIndependent Clinical Research\n\nIn addition to sponsoring our own clinical research and research collaborations, we also have programs that allow us to support external requests. We can provide resources and/or financial support for independent clinical research that is initiated, designed and sponsored by external researchers.\n\nWe consider independent clinical research projects based on scientific merit and strategic fit with our areas of research interest. These reviews are carried out by global committees composed of Lilly medical and scientific staff members from relevant therapeutic areas.\n\nHealth care and research professionals may submit a concept online."
