        "text": "Last updated: 10 June 2023\n\nEncryption keeps your data secure when you're shopping or banking online. It scrambles data like your credit card details and home address to ensure hackers can't misuse this information.\n\nToday, encryption involves new concepts and is crucial for all of us.\n\nBut it wasn't always so complicated.\n\nAncient Spartan cryptography\n\nCirca 600 BC: The ancient Spartans used a scytale device to send secret messages during battle.\n\nThis device consists of a leather strap wrapped around a wooden rod.\n\nThe letters on the leather strip are meaningless when unwrapped, and the message makes sense only if the recipient has the correctly sized rod.\n\nWhen was cryptography invented? It probably started in Egypt around 1900 BC, when a scribe used unexpected hieroglyphic characters instead of the usual ones.\n\nRoman encryption and cyphers\n\nCirca 60 BC: Julius Caesar invents a cypher that shifts characters by three places in the alphabet: A becomes D, B becomes E, etc. A simple and effective encoding method at that time.\n\nSurprisingly, in the 2000s, Bernardo Provenzano, the Sicilian Mafia boss, still used a variant of the Caesar cipher to communicate through Pizzini, coded messages written on tiny pieces of paper.\n\n1553: Giovan Battista Bellaso envisions the first cypher to use a proper encryption key - an agreed-upon keyword the recipient must know to decode the message.\n\n1854: Charles Wheatstone invents the Playfair Cipher, which encrypts pairs of letters instead of single ones and is, therefore, harder to crack.\n\nBut what is the meaning of encryption, and how is it different from cryptography?\n\nWhat is a cipher? A cipher encodes or encrypts information to make it unreadable without the right decoding key or algorithm. It's like a secret code, protecting sensitive data by changing it into unintelligible. Ciphers can have different forms, such as substituting letters with symbols or rearranging word order. Only those with the decoding key can decipher the code and understand the original message, just like a secret code between friends keeps messages safe from others.\n\nCryptography vs encryption: Cryptography is the science of concealing messages with a secret code. Encryption is the way to encrypt and decrypt data. The first is about studying methods to keep a message secret between two parties (like symmetric and asymmetric keys), and the second is about the process itself.\n\nCryptanalysis is the science of deciphering data and revealing the message in plain text.\n\nHebern rotor machine\n\n1917: An American, Edward Hebern, invented the electro-mechanical machine in which the key is embedded in a rotating disc. It's the first example of a rotor machine. It encodes a substitution table that is changed every time a new character is typed.\n\n1918: German engineer Arthur Scherbius invented the Enigma machine (pictured) for commercial use. It uses several rather than the one rotor used by Hebern's device. Recognizing its genius, the German military began to use it to send coded transmissions.\n\nBut wait. There's more about Enigma.\n\nWW2 cryptography\n\n1932: Polish cryptographer Marian Rejewski discovered how Enigma works. In 1939, Poland shared this information with the French and British intelligence services, allowing cryptographers like Alan Turing to figure out how to crack the key, which changes daily.\n\nIt proved crucial to the Allies' World War II victory.\n\nYou can read more about the Bombe Machine, designed by Turing and created by the British Tabulating Machine Company.\n\nAnother significant but often overlooked contribution came from Hedy Lamarr, a renowned actress and inventor.\n\nDuring the war, Lamarr co-invented a frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology, initially intended to prevent the jamming of Allied torpedoes. Although not directly used in cryptography during the war, her invention laid the groundwork for future secure wireless communications, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, representing a major leap in technology and encryption methods.\n\n1945: Claude E. Shannon of Bell Labs published an article called \"A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography.\" It's the starting point of modern cryptography.\n\nFor centuries, governments have controlled secret codes: applied to diplomacy, employed in wars, and used in espionage.\n\nBut with modern technologies, the use of codes by individuals has exploded.\n\nLet's see what happened.\n\nModern cryptography (computer-based encryption)\n\nIn the early 1970s: IBM formed a 'crypto group,' which designed a block cypher to protect its customers' data. In 1973, the US adopted it as a national standard - the Data Encryption Standard, or DES. It remained in use until it cracked in 1997.\n\nIn the 1970s, academic papers on encryption were classified. Cryptographic devices were subject to export controls and rated as munitions, particularly in the US. Encryption was regarded as a matter of national security.\n\nIn 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a research paper on what would be defined as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\nThe code key was no longer pre-arranged for the first time, but a pair of keys (one public, one private but mathematically linked) was dynamically created for every correspondent.\n\n2000: the Advanced Encryption Standard replaces DES, or AES (asymmetric key - the user and sender must know the same secret key), found through a competition open to the public. Today, AES is royalty-free worldwide and approved for use in classified US government information.\n\nPKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is a generic term used to define solutions for creating and managing public-key encryption. It is activated by browsers for the Internet and public and private organizations to secure communications.\n\nCSO Online has a good article on PKI.\n\n2005: Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an advanced public-key cryptography scheme that allows shorter encryption keys. Elliptic curve cryptosystems are more challenging to break than RSA and Diffie-Hellman.\n\nData encryption for all\n\nElliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is also interesting because it uses less computing power: keys are shorter and, simultaneously, more challenging to break.\n\nThis method is perfect for smart cards (banking cards, ID cards..), smartphones, and IoT devices (connected objects.)\n\nIt's the mechanism to protect bitcoins or messages on Signal or Telegram.\n\nWhatsApp also uses ECC from the open-source Signal Protocol developed by Open Whisper Systems.\n\nAnd guess what? That's why these currencies are called cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe US government is also using it to protect internal communications.\n\nECC is becoming the preferred solution for digital privacy and security.\n\nToday: As more and more services move to the cloud and even objects (Internet of Things) communicate, encrypting data in transit and at rest is crucial. Cryptographers are continually developing and refining solutions to this challenge.\n\nThe use of codes by individuals has also exploded, from PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) to Telegram or Signal.\n\nWith end-to-end encryption, the context of every exchange - a text message, a video chat, a voice call, an emoji reaction - is intelligible only to the sender and the recipient. If a hacker or a government agency intercepts an exchange, the intruder sees a nonsensical snarl of letters and numbers.\n\nDon't lose your (encryption) keys.\n\nBitcoin private keys are easy to lose.\n\nUsers debated whether it was a bug or a feature from the start.\n\nAccording to the New Yorker (13 December 2021), nearly 20% of the mined coins were lost twelve years after their inception.\n\nThe magazine illustrates this with the story of a Welshman who dumped his computer hard disk. It stored Bitcoin's private keys worth $550 million. Now he's fighting to shovel the local landfill.\n\nThere's no other way.\n\nThat's why Bitcoin owners prefer to store their private keys in offline wallets.\n\nStore your keys in a safe place.\n\nMarch 2021 was a busy month for Belgian and Dutch police. They had infiltrated and breached the encryption of users of Sky ECC, the world's largest cryptophone network.\n\nSky ECC boasted of being the \"most secure messaging platform you can buy\" and offered a $5 million prize for anyone who could break the encryption of one of its phones. The only problem was that Belgian and Dutch police didn't need the $5 million prize.\n\nThey found a spectacular bungle made by Sky ECC.\n\nIt turns out they stored the private keys for the system on the same server as the network's messages. Oops.\n\nMore than 1,600 Belgian police officers and their Dutch counterparts swooped in and arrested 48 suspects. The Dutch police were also busy raiding 75 homes and arresting more than 30 people. The news caused panic among the 70,000 customers of Sky ECC around the world who thought they were safe.\n\nMoral of the story: don't put all your eggs in one basket. Especially when that basket is your own server.\n\n20 major encryption algorithms and their date of creation\n\nHere is a list of 20 major encryption algorithms and their date of creation:\n\nEncryption Algorithm\n\nYear\n\nMain Features\n\nNote: The years mentioned represent the year of the algorithm's initial publication or significant milestone.\n\nThe challenging future of encryption\n\nQuantum computing (and its exceptional power) is in its infancy but may break asymmetric cryptographic algorithms.\n\nThe result?\n\nExperts foresee that RSA 2048 can be broken by 2035.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF - March 2021) paper on Quantum computing and the financial system, quantum computing could compromise the security of digital currencies and e-commerce, mobile banking, and internet data exchange.\n\nFor example, the IMF advises that banks prepare for the cryptographic transition by assessing future and retroactive risks from quantum computers, inventorying their cryptographic algorithms, and building cryptographic agility to improve their infrastructure cybersecurity resilience.\n\nScientists cannot guarantee encryption beyond thirty years.\n\nSo, stay tuned to discover how post-quantum cryptography could be applied to secure data soon.\n\nEncryption vs tokenization\n\nTokenization and encryption are both methods of protecting data, but they have different purposes and functions.\n\nTokenization: Tokenization is the process of replacing sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent known as a token without compromising the security of the original data. It does not contain details about how this data is stored, who has access to it, or its value.\n\nTokens can be stored in databases, transmitted over networks, or used to generate dynamic reports.\n\nTokenization can be implemented on top of existing systems without significant changes to existing processes or infrastructure.\n\nEncryption, however, uses an algorithm to convert sensitive data into an unintelligible format before storing or transmitting it. Encryption is typically performed using public/private key pairs—a public key is used to encrypt data while its paired private key decrypts it later when it needs to be reread (e.g., by someone who requires access).\n\nThe benefits of tokenization versus encryption include the following:\n\n1) Increased security;\n\n2) Reduced costs;\n\n3) No need to maintain a database;\n\n4) More flexibility when deploying new applications;\n\n5) Reduced legal liability for breaches caused by encryption failures;\n\n6) Ability to comply with privacy law regulations (such as HIPAA).\n\nMore on this topic: What is payment tokenization?\n\nCryptography vs zero-knowledge proofs\n\nCryptography and zero-knowledge proofs are important concepts in information security, but they serve different purposes and functionalities.\n\nCryptography is a broader field that deals with secure communication techniques in the presence of adversaries. It's like a toolbox filled with various tools for securing data. These tools include encryption (converting readable data into unreadable data to protect it), decryption (converting the unreadable data back into readable form), digital signatures (for authentication), and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, zero-knowledge proofs, while a cryptographic concept, are a more specific tool within that larger cryptography toolbox.\n\nThey are a method by which one party can prove to another that they know a specific piece of information without revealing any details about the information itself.\n\nIn other words, it's like showing someone you have a key to a lock without letting them see the shape of the key.\n\nSo, while zero-knowledge proofs fall under the broader umbrella of cryptography, they serve a unique purpose that differentiates them from other cryptographic techniques. It's a way of proving knowledge without giving away the knowledge itself, which is not the primary function of many other cryptographic methods.\n\nWhat is steganography?\n\nAnd one last word on... steganography.\n\nSteganography is a technique used in information security where the aim is to hide a secret message within another ordinary, non-secret message.\n\nThis is done in such a way that an observer cannot detect the presence of the secret message. The word \"steganography\" comes from Greek and means \"concealed writing\".\n\nIt differs from cryptography, where the existence of the message itself is not disguised, but the content is encrypted. In steganography, the very existence of the message is concealed.\n\nCommon examples of steganography include hiding a text message within the least significant bits of an image or a sound file or using invisible ink to write on a physical medium - we've all done this with lemon juice when we were kids, right?\n\nIt is used in various applications, from digital rights management to covert communication and secret data storage.\n\nCryptography-related contents"
