        "text": "Francois Safieddine is a self-made entrepreneur who entered the hospitality industry by working within and advancing quickly at a major fast casual concept. Recognizing the booming Denver culinary scene in 1994, and identifying the need for an ethnic food concept, Safieddine and his brother opened Fettouch Lebanese Restaurant in Larimer Square, marking his first success in hospitality.\n\nContinuing entrepreneurial success over the last decade, Safieddine went on to open several restaurants and lounges, leaving his footprint on Colorado’s nightlife and dining landscape. In 2010, Safieddine, once again, saw an opportunity to create an elevated neighborhood sports-bar dining experience, in which guests can view and connect with their surroundings. Ultimately leading to the conception of ViewHouse Eatery, Bar, & Rooftop. Viewhouse is a culmination of Lotus’s previous years of understanding, delivering and exceeding expectations with over 13 concepts that were all value driven and experience focused. Viewhouse set the bar for what casual dining and entertainment would look like in Colorado; from the fresh locally-sourced casual menu, the sheer 20,000 square foot size of the venue, and over 300 annual events between all the locations, Viewhouse changed the hospitality landscape forever.\n\nThrough the years, the restaurant group has continued to thoughtfully anticipate, create and deliver hospitality brands to it’s portfolio. Currently Lotus has the following concepts: Viewhouse (Ballpark, Centennial, Littleton, Co springs), My Neighbor Felix (Lohi, Boulder), Sports Column, and Wonderyard… Coming soon!"
