        "text": "It’s a story that began in our nation’s earliest days…\n\nAs the Department of Homeland Security’s 20th anniversary approaches, we celebrate U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s history.\n\nThough DHS is a 20-year-old agency, its story began with laws passed in our nation’s earliest days.\n\nThe Tariff Act of 1789 was the first major piece of legislation enacted in the United States after the Founding Fathers ratified the Constitution. It had two purposes: to protect newly developed manufacturing industries and raise revenue for our fledgling federal government, which was struggling with debt left over from the American Revolution.\n\nThat act laid the foundation for many laws related to imports, customs and taxes over the next 213 years.\n\nThen, in November 2002, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act. The act set into motion the largest government reorganization since lawmakers created the Department of Defense in the 1940s.\n\nIn March 2003, the newly created DHS opened its doors. One of its components was the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is now known as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIn response to the 9/11 tragedy, lawmakers gave ICE a unique combination of civil and criminal authorities to protect national security and strengthen public safety. With those authorities, ICE quickly became a powerful and sophisticated federal law enforcement agency.\n\nThroughout 2023, ICE is looking back at its history and achievements through a series of stories and images, focusing on significant milestones, events and accomplishments, beginning in 2001. Click on a calendar year to learn more about significant events that happened during ICE’s history.\n\nNovember: Lawmakers pass the Homeland Security Act\n\nLegislators pass the Homeland Security Act of 2002 in response to 9/11 and the subsequent series of anthrax-laced letters sent to senators and news organizations. The act is co-sponsored by 118 members of Congress, and President George W. Bush signs it into law Nov. 25. The Homeland Security Act creates the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a new cabinet-level position: the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\n2003\n\nMarch 1: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security officially begins operations\n\nDHS absorbs all or part of 22 federal agencies and programs, including the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Customs Service. In doing so, it divides the enforcement and services functions of the two agencies and creates three new agencies: the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nDHS is tasked to:\n\nPrevent terrorism and enhance national security\n\nSecure and manage U.S. borders\n\nEnforce and administer U.S. immigration law\n\nSafeguard and secure cyberspace\n\nEnsure resilience in disaster response\n\nMarch 11: President Bush appoints Michael J. Garcia as the first assistant secretary for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\nPresident Bush appoints Michael J. Garcia as the first assistant secretary for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement with unanimous consent from the Senate. Garcia previously served as acting INS commissioner. Prior to that, Garcia was the assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement and served as the top enforcer of dual-use export control laws.\n\nHighlights\n\nOffice of Detention and Removal Operations establishes the first eight Fugitive Operations Teams.

They arrest 7,959 unlawfully present noncitizens.\n\nThe Office of Investigations and U.S. Department of State begin conducting cross-border financial investigation training events around the world.\n\nThe Border Enforcement Security Task Force is created.\n\nAtlanta’s Office of the Principal Legal Advisor secures the case for removal of Kelbessa Negewo, who fraudulently obtained asylum, permanent residency and naturalization in the United States. Negewo was wanted in his home country for human rights violations, including torture and murder, during Ethiopia’s “Red Terror” campaign in the late 1970s.\n\nThe agency launches Operation Community Shield after field offices identify Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) as one of the largest and most violent street gangs in the country.\n\nHuman Trafficking is the first television program about a Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent to premiere on TV in the United States and Canada. The TV miniseries features an ICE agent who goes undercover to stop an organization from human trafficking.\n\n2006\n\nJanuary 4: Julie L. Myers becomes assistant secretary for Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\nPresident George Bush appoints Julie L. Myers as assistant secretary for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Prior to her appointment, Myers served as special assistant to the president for presidential personnel. Before that, she served as assistant secretary for export enforcement at the Department of Commerce. In that role, Myers supervised a nationwide law enforcement agency that specialized in civil and criminal export control violations.\n\nHighlights\n\nOffice of Detention and Removal Operations initiates the Detention Enforcement and Processing of Offenders by Remote Technology Center in Chicago. It becomes the interview and processing site for convicted criminal noncitizens incarcerated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nThe agency establishes the Fugitive Operations Support Center to enhance the National Fugitive Operations Program’s efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nThe agency initiates a new alternative to detention: the Electronic Monitoring Program.\n\nThe 287(g) program allows state and local law enforcement entities to enter partnerships with ICE to perform immigration law enforcement functions.\n\nThe Office of the Principal Legal Advisor provides 40 hours of customs law training to all its offices.\n\nOperation Wagon Train launches. It’s one of the largest worksite enforcement operations in U.S. history.\n\n2007\n\nJanuary 29: Majid Al-Massari removed\n\nAgents remove Majid Al-Massari, 35, a native and citizen of Saudi Arabia belonging to an undesignated terrorist organization, pursuant to a removal order from June 30, 2005. At the time of his arrest, Al-Massari was a Seattle-area computer security specialist using his cyber skills to engage in terrorist activities, incite hatred, and advance the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights’ terrorist goals. Al-Massari moderated an internet chatroom for the group and posted Al Qaeda's weekly magazine on his site.\n\nMarch 31: Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement renamed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security changes the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's name to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It also changes the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection’s name to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nJune 1: Office of Detention and Removal Operations assumes responsibility for the Criminal Alien Program\n\nThe Office of Detention and Removal Operations assumes responsibility for the Criminal Alien Program, taking over for the Office of Investigations. ICE aims to secure final orders of removal for criminal noncitizens before they are released from prison or jail. This decreases or eliminates the time noncitizens spend in ICE custody, reducing the government’s costs.\n\nSeptember 1: ICE implements electronic travel document system\n\nICE launches a new electronic travel document system, which significantly reduces the amount of time partner countries need to spend on issuing travel documents. The system enables officials to review travel document requests and electronically issue travel documents.\n\nOctober 1: The National Fugitive Operations Program drastically reduces the nation’s fugitive noncitizen population\n\nICE's case backlog consists of fewer than 595,000 fugitive noncitizens — a 38,000-person decrease from the prior year. ICE attributes the dramatic reduction to the Fugitive Operations Program’s rapid growth.\n\nDecember: Value of counterfeit or pirated merchandize seizures increases by more than 20% over prior year\n\nAlthough the number of ICE’s intellectual property seizures dropped from 14,675 in 2006 to 13,657 in 2007, the total value of those seizures increased from $155,369,236 to $196,754,377.\n\n2008\n\nJuly 16: The National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center opens in Virginia\n\nDHS opens a high-tech facility to house the ICE-led Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center. The move co-locates, for the first time, the regulators and law enforcement agencies working to stop the theft of intellectual property and the importation of counterfeit, substandard and tainted products. The IPR Center's early partners include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Commerce, the Food and Drug Administration, the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.\n\nNovember: ICE opens new headquarters\n\nICE moves to a new headquarters building, Potomac Center North, in Southwest Washington, D.C.

Morton is appointed ICE assistant secretary\n\nThe Senate unanimously confirms John Morton as ICE’s assistant secretary.
