        "text": "In 2003, Fred Reichheld, a partner at Bain & Company, created a new way of measuring how well an organization treats the people whose lives it affects—how well it generates relationships worthy of loyalty.\n\nHe called that metric the Net Promoter ScoreSM, or NPS®.\n\nHe shared the methodology so anyone could apply it.\n\nOver time, each organization developed and expanded it. They improved the methodology. They extended its use beyond customers, applying it to help build employee engagement and commitment. They discovered new methods to broaden its impact, not just to measure customer loyalty but to transform their organizations."
