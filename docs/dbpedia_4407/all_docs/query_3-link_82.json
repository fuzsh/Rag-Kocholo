        "text": "Your project outcome is only going to be as good as the team behind it. There are no two ways about it—your project’s success depends on the skills, expertise, and experience of the project team you assemble.\n\nThat starts with an understanding of project team roles and responsibilities.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what we’re here to do today.\n\nWhat is a project team?\n\nA project team is a group of individuals brought together to work on a specific project or initiative. The team will include roles needed for project planning, development, and implementation.\n\nThe team members collaborate to achieve a set of predetermined goals as stated in the project scope. This could be the launch of a product or service, or delivering a new design or feature for a client.\n\nEach member of the team has a unique set of skills and responsibilities that contribute to the success of the project—ultimately, completing the project on schedule and on budget.\n\nEstablishing a project team helps you ensure important projects have a dedicated group made up of various skills and experiences so the work can be completed as efficiently as possible.\n\nTeam roles can be assigned to full-time or part-time employees, contractors, subject matter experts, or other external stakeholders.\n\nRoles and responsibilities definition\n\nRoles and responsibilities are related concepts. This article will cover the roles of a project team (what specific positions and functions make up a project team), as well as the responsibilities (the duties and tasks tied to each specific role).\n\n5 key project team roles and responsibilities\n\nEvery project has different requirements, so team structure can vary. But the five major roles in a project team are project sponsor, project manager, business analyst, resource manager, and project team member.\n\nLet’s dive into the roles and responsibilities of each, and how they work together.\n\n1. Project sponsor: The person driving the vision\n\nThe sponsor is the in-house champion of a project, overseeing operations from a high level. This person works directly with the project manager, clearing any obstacles that threaten to stall the project and signing off on all major components.\n\nA member of senior management typically fills this role. A project sponsor’s responsibilities include the following:\n\nCreating the project vision\n\nEarning buy-in from executive leadership\n\nMaking critical decisions\n\nApproving the project budget\n\n2. Project manager (or leader): The person managing day-to-day operations\n\nProject managers or leaders are responsible for day-to-day operations and ensuring the project is completed on time, on budget, and achieves its objectives.\n\nOn a small project, the manager might oversee each team member. On a larger-scale project, they are more likely to oversee team leaders, who each manage their own group.\n\nThe project manager is responsible for the following:\n\nCreating the project plan and schedule\n\nRecruiting project staff\n\nManaging the budget\n\nManaging the project schedule\n\nDelegating project tasks to team members\n\nManaging all project deliverables\n\nCommunicating with upper management and other stakeholders\n\n3. Resource manager: In charge of resource allocation and utilization\n\nThe resource manager is critical when putting together your project team. Now, if your project isn’t big enough to require a resource manager, you’ll simply have to act as one. So what does that mean exactly?\n\nIdentify the right people for a project\n\nMatch project team roles and skills with project needs\n\nAllocate and schedule the right resource within the project timeline and budget\n\nStay on top of resource availability and utilization\n\nMonitor and optimize the use of resources throughout the course of the project to make sure it can be completed successfully\n\n4. Business analyst: Makes sure you have the data you need\n\nThe business analyst is responsible for gathering and analyzing data related to the project. They help identify the project’s requirements and determine the best approach to achieve the project’s objectives. They work with stakeholders to ensure that the project’s deliverables meet the organization’s needs.\n\nThe business analyst ensures the project team has the technology and tools to do their jobs effectively. They might also recommend new tools for streamlining workflows and improving quality, such as resource scheduling software.\n\nA business analyst:\n\nHelps define the project and its goals\n\nGathers technical requirements from team members\n\nDocuments and analyzes project requirements\n\nHelps project team solve equipment management problems\n\nTests solutions to ensure their effectiveness\n\n5. Project team member (or project delivery team): Individual contributors assigned to different project tasks\n\nProject delivery team responsibilities vary between projects and roles (which may include anything from developers and engineers, to designers and copywriters).\n\nAt a high level, all project team members are assigned the tasks required to complete the project, and are responsible for:\n\nContributing to the project goals and objectives\n\nCompleting individual tasks within the expected time frame\n\nCollaborating with other team members\n\nCommunicating with the project manager about roadblocks\n\nOther roles in a project team\n\nSome larger projects require additional project management roles and responsibilities to support the core project team. These may include:\n\nAn executive sponsor is a senior owner of the project (with more authority than the project sponsor) and the ultimate decision-maker\n\nA project owner is usually the person who proposed the project. They assist the project manager in ensuring successful implementation\n\nA project lead is someone who carries out a lot of the tasks of the project manager but doesn’t have as much experience or official qualifications\n\nA team leader is responsible for training team members and monitoring progress toward project objectives\n\nA functional manager’s responsibility can vary, but the primary function is to ensure the project team has the resources it needs, and address problems that slow down the project\n\nA program manager coordinates all projects related to a specific program and provides guidance to the project manager\n\nA subject matter expert (SME) has advanced knowledge of a specific area, practice, or process. They provide guidance and strategy to the project team\n\nA project coordinator or project management office (PMO) offers administrative support to the project team and establishes standards to ensure the team’s processes align with broader organizational goals\n\nProject stakeholders are people (internal or external to the project) who have an interest in and influence over the project. Their responsibilities and interests vary between (and even within) projects\n\nA steering committee includes senior-level stakeholders (such as the project sponsor) and company managers, and provides strategic support to help define business needs and achieve project outcomes\n\nProject team roles and responsibilities example\n\nRoles in a team project can get confusing (fast). So to demonstrate how project team roles work together, let’s use the example of an in-house marketing team undertaking a website redesign.\n\nProject sponsor: This is the person who “owns” the project. In this case, the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) might decide the website needed an overhaul as part of a big rebranding initiative. For this project, the responsibilities of the project sponsor could look something like the following:\n\nEnsures the redesign aligns with strategic business goals\n\nAssigns with the project manager\n\nProvides resources and support for the redesign\n\nServes as an escalation point when problems arise\n\nProject manager: This person oversees the execution of the project and manages the team. In this case, let’s say it’s the creative director. The project manager:\n\nCommunicates with the sponsor and project team\n\nSets milestones and deadlines\n\nEnsures the redesign stays on schedule and on budget\n\nMonitors the progress of the project\n\nResource manager: As the name implies, this person ensures the team has everything it needs to complete the redesign. In this case, let’s say it’s the chief information officer.\n\nIdentifies the best project team roles based on the project scope\n\nPlans and allocates people and resources (meeting rooms, equipment, etc.)\n\nMonitors utilization throughout the project and tracks billable hours\n\nProject team members: These are the folks responsible for executing the redesign. They report to the project manager. The following roles need to be assigned:\n\nFront-end and back-end engineers\n\nQA engineer\n\nUX/UI designer\n\nVisual designer\n\nSEO expert\n\nCopywriter\n\nProject team role and responsibilities matrix\n\nBecause roles and responsibilities can vary between projects, it can be helpful to create a RACI project team matrix at the very beginning of the project to clarify the expectations of each position.\n\nRACI stands for responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed. It helps define the roles within a project management team and then identifies who needs to be looped in or assigned to each task.\n\nIt’s simple really, if everyone knows their roles within a project team, your project is much more likely to run smoothly.\n\nThe project team roles and responsibilities table below shows an example RACI matrix for project sponsors, project managers, resource managers, and project team members, but can be expanded to include more roles and tasks.\n\nNow that we know more about what project team roles to include in a project along with their different responsibilities, find out how you actually go about building your project team here.\n\nProject team roles FAQs\n\nHow do you decide what roles are needed on a project team?\n\nTo define the team roles needed for your project, outline the goals and key deliverables of the project. Think about the skills you need to ensure those deliverables are high quality, and then match and assign team members accordingly.\n\nWhat are the benefits of defining project team roles?\n\nThe benefits of clearly defined roles include:\n\nIncrease individual accountability\n\nReduce confusion and overlap\n\nGive team members a feeling of ownership and clarity around expectations\n\nEnable project managers to delegate tasks and assess team members’ performance\n\nEstablish a structure for effective problem-solving and collaboration\n\nCan required project roles vary from project to project?\n\nThey absolutely can, depending on the nature of the project, the team structure, and the availability of specific skills and expertise. What matters is that the responsibilities for each role are clearly defined before work begins on the project.\n\nWhat are the best practices when putting together a project team?\n\nYou’ll want to:\n\nCreate a project scope\n\nDevelop and follow a clear project plan\n\nIdentify the project team roles needed for your project, and schedule your resources\n\nEstablish some core project team values\n\nEncourage a collaborative project team culture\n\nWhat are the roles in a project team?\n\nTo summarize, the roles on a project team can include:\n\nProject sponsor\n\nExecutive sponsor\n\nProject owner\n\nProject manager\n\nProject lead\n\nTeam leader\n\nProject team member or project delivery team\n\nResource manager\n\nBusiness analyst\n\nFunctional manager\n\nProgram manager\n\nSubject matter expert (SME)\n\nProject coordinator or project management office (PMO)\n\nClearly defined project team roles mean a greater chance of project success\n\nWith the right project team, you’ve instantly increased the chances of project success (because let’s not forget—70% of projects fail). So you’ll want to invest in getting the right people on board from the get-go.\n\nWhile it’s tempting to grab whoever’s available to get started faster and track against timelines, the wiser thing to do is to wait, assess, and carefully put together your team. As we said earlier—your project will be better for it.\n\nFind the right people—faster—with Resource Guru\n\nWhether you’re working with a big or small project team, resource management software can help find and allocate the right resources, monitor utilization, and create more accurate resource forecasting."
