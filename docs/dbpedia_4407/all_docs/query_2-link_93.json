To do so, we recognize that we must be creative to accommodate the unique needs of each individual we serve. We also understand that teamwork makes positive things happen, therefore, it takes a focused commitment from every part of our organization to achieve the harmony that everyone deserves. Even though we serve hundreds of individuals across the state of PA, your loved one is most important to us. Each person, individually, has tremendous value and deserves respect as well as the highest level of quality care possible. We are committed to that effort everyday!\n\nWe were Founded in\n\n1993\n\n25+ Years of Experience\n\n1993\n\n2011\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2019\n\nToday\n\nProtect and Advocate for those\n\nwho are in need\n\nWe opened our doors in Reading PA for those with intellectual disabilities and mental health diagnosis looking for safe and nuturing housing is one of the most powerful barriers to recovery. When this basic need isn’t met, people cycle in and out of homelessness, jails, shelters and hospitals. Having a safe, appropriate place to live can provide stability to allow your loved ones to achieve their goals.\n\nAcquired 8 homes in Lebanon Co.\n\nUnder the leadership of then CEO, Ryan Smith we saw the benefits of expansion within Central PA. Not only were we growing locally, but in the process of our expansion we had solidified a business model that we would use as we moved forward.\n\nBranched out across the state\n\nand now had 60+ homes in PA\n\nOnce we realized the impact we had made in central PA with serving the residents and making a difference in so many lives and families it was only a matter of time before we had to scale the business.\n\nAffiliation with Inperium\n\nFounded in 2016, Inperium, Inc. is a Pennsylvania non-profit corporation headquartered in Reading, Berks County, Pennsylvania. Inperium, Inc. is a Constellation company of non-profits & for-profits providing person-centric health related supports & other business services to the organizations it aids.\n\nAffiliation with Our Own Home\n\nAs a leader in South Western PA, Our Own Home’s mission was to provide life enriching opportunities for those they served. With the acquisition of OOH, SCFF now was truly a statewide agency that was on its way to becoming a leader in the space and has continually grown since its inception.\n\nWe became the largest\n\nAgency in Pennsylvania with 131 homes\n\nOur goal is to be the provider of choice for families and individuals in need. We are growing to become one of the largest providers in PA."
