        "text": "Maury Nation and colleagues completed research that looked at successful prevention programs and identified criteria that were commonly found in these programs. These are referred to as the Nine Principles of Effective Prevention Programs. The Nine Principles serve as a good checklist when reviewing prevention plans to ensure that multiple criterion are met.\n\nComprehensive Services\n\nStrategies should include multiple components and affect multiple settings to address a wide range of risk and protective factors of the target problem.\n\nVaried Teaching Methods\n\nStrategies should include multiple teaching methods, including some type of active, skills based component.\n\nSufficient Dosage\n\nParticipants need to be exposed to enough of the activity for it to have an effect.\n\nTheory Driven\n\nPreventive strategies should have scientific or logical rationale.\n\nPositive Relationships\n\nPrograms should foster strong, stable, positive relationships between children and adults.\n\nAppropriately Timed\n\nProgram activities should happen at a time (developmentally) that can have maximum impact in a participant's life.\n\nSocioculturally Relevant\n\nPrograms should be tailored to fit within cultural beliefs and practices of specific groups, as well as local community norms.\n\nOutcome Evaluation\n\nA systematic outcome evaluation is necessary to determine whether a program or strategy worked.\n\nWell-Trained Staff\n\nPrograms need to be implemented by staff members who are sensitive, competent, and have received sufficient training, support, and supervision. Follow up (booster) training and technical assistance to staff are critical.\n\nResources on Other Websites\n\n\"Applying the Principles of Prevention: What Do Prevention Practitioners Need to Know About What Works\" (2003).
