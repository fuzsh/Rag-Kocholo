        "text": "Hi! We’re Splunk, and we’re glad you’re visiting us today. (And just maybe, you're visiting because of some big news: Splunk has officially joined Cisco. Indeed, we are so excited for this opportunity.)\n\nHonestly , we hear from people far and wide about “What does Splunk do?”, “Does the name Splunk mean something?” And of course, “How can I learn Splunk?”\n\nI wrote this article to help answer all these questions and point you in the right direction. First things first — Splunk formally refers to our company. Less formally, though, you might hear about Splunk in reference to our products, services and other offerings. Employees at Splunk are known as Splunkers. Importantly, the coolest part about our company is probably the global community of people who use and rely on Splunk offerings in their own workplaces.\n\nWe’ll get into all this and more in the following article. Thanks for reading!\n\nWhat does Splunk do?\n\nSo, let’s start with the first question: what does Splunk do?\n\nAs simply as possible, we offer a big data platform that can help you do a lot of things better. Using Splunk the right way powers cybersecurity, observability, network operations and a whole bunch of important tasks that large organizations require.\n\nSplunk is the key to enterprise resilience.

Whether you need comprehensive visibility, rapid dection and investigation, an optimized resource — or all three! — Splunk solutions have you covered.\n\nAs our formal introduction explains:\n\nOur purpose is to build a safer and more resilient digital world. Every day, we live this purpose by helping security, IT and DevOps teams keep their organizations securely up and running. When organizations have resilient digital systems, they can adapt, innovate and deliver for their customers.\n\nTo that end, Splunk offers a whole suite of various software, apps and APIs, plus a whole lot of flexibility for your future needs.

Splunking, then, is the exploration of information caves and the mining of data. Splunk helps you explore things that aren’t easy to get to otherwise, like log data and messages and machine data.\n\nRemoving these data barriers uncovers tons of meaning and actionable steps organizations. That’s why you’ll hear us talk about Splunkers (our employees and community) or the idea of Splunking around. Importantly, it’s not only the capabilities that we offer — the real exciting stuff is all the things you can do with those capabilities.\n\nSo, the short answer to what Splunk can do might just be: all kinds of stuff! Here’s a few starting points:\n\nMonitor, search through, index and correlate data from a variety of sources.\n\nEasily search and analyze big data and set up relevant alerts, reports and visualizations.\n\nPower your cybersecurity operations, from incident response and management to threat detection and threat hunting.\n\nMake compliance and reporting a breeze.\n\nGet full visibility into your IT and business operations.\n\nEssentially, any area where you’ve got lots and lots of data, Splunk can help.\n\nSplunk offers a single place to understand how your organization is working — and more importantly — where it is not working.

Inspired by cave spelunking, they sought a way to better see into all the siloed information caves typical of most organizations.\n\nSeeing that “everything” makes data, the team sought a way to extract value from that. The technology centered around a powerful search engine that scanned and stored log files within system infrastructure. We’ve grown a lot since those early days:\n\nFounded in 2003, Splunk is a global company — with over 7,500 employees, Splunkers have received over 1,020 patents to date and availability in 21 regions around the world.\n\nToday, we know that building resilience is a team effort. That’s why, over the years, we have acquired a few companies and merged their technologies into our solutions, providing more teams a way to get everything they need in one place.\n\n2023 was a big year here at Splunk. In October, we celebrated our 20th anniversary. And we announced our intent to join forces with Cisco. We also support ongoing data innovation with Splunk Ventures. We are dedicating $150 million to invest in early-stage orgs that aim to have a positive impact on society while expanding and enhancing digital resilience.\n\nQuick facts about Splunk\n\nChief executive officer and chairman.
