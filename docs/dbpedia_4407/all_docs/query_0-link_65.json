        "text": "Nov. 10, 2003\n\nBox Score\n\nJamaica, N.Y. - Behind the leadership of three newcomers, the St. John's women's basketball team had four players in double figures, as they handed Team Concept an 85-81 defeat this evening at Alumni Hall in a preseason exhibition match-up. Junior College transfer Secrett Stubblefield (Fairfax, Va.) led all scorers with 25 points, and transfer Kim MacMillan (Toms River, N.J.) added 23, while freshman Angie Clark (Copaigue, N.Y.) notched a 13 point, 17 rebound double-double in her first game in a Red Storm uniform.\n\nA 16-2 run highlighted by five three-point plays over a six-minute span of the second half helped the Red Storm put the game out of reach.\n\nSt. John's broke out to an early 3-0 lead in the first half as MacMillan made the first of four first half three pointers to open the game. Team Concept bounced back with four straight points, before St. John's went on a 10-0 run, capped by back-to-back threes by MacMillan.\n\nTeam Concept chipped away at the Red Storm lead and pulled within one when Jenny Mowe sank a three and Laura Gonsalves followed it up with a jumper, cutting the lead to one. The teams traded baskets for the remainder of the period before Team Concept hit back-to-back lay-ups and walked into the locker room with a 33-32 lead.\n\nHolding a narrow 51-50 lead with 10 minutes remaining in the second half, Team Concept went on a mini-run scoring four consecutive points. MacMillan answered with her sixth three-pointer of the game, cutting the lead to 55-53 with just over nine minutes remaining. Stubblefield sank a free throw and tied the game at 57 on the Red Storm's next possession with a three-pointer, kicking off a 16-2 St. John's run, in which the Red Storm tallied three points on five consecutive possessions. Shemika Stevens (New York, N.Y.) sank a three to put St. John's up 60-57 and Stubblefield came right back with a fast break lay-up, which she converted into a three-point play from the foul line. MacMillan sank her seventh and final three of the game on the next play and Steven's closed out the run with a lay-up and a good free throw, putting the Red Storm up 69-59.\n\nTeam Concept pulled within four and on St. John's next attack, Clark pulled down one of her eight offensive boards and scored putting the Red Storm up 78-73. Team Concept fought back and off of a couple of late steals cut the lead to two with back-to-back three pointers by Stacey Clinesmith and Kate Starbird, but Stevens would seal the victory with two free throws with 1.3 seconds remaining, as the Red Storm held on for the 85-81 win.\n\nStevens rounded out the St. John's players in double figures finishing with 14 points, and added five assists and five steals.\n\nSt. John's will kickoff the regular season on Friday, November 21 at Holy Cross."
