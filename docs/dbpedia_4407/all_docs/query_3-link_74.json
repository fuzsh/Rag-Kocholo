Here are some tips:\n\n1. Think About Why You Want This Job in Particular\n\nResearch the role and figure out why it interests you. Think about how the job description matches your skill set, ambitions and what you genuinely like most about the business.\n\nFor example, some of these may apply:\n\nThe responsibilities of the role align with your personal interests. Ensure you can link what interests you about the job role to specific examples. For example, if you are applying for the role of Editorial Assistant at Love Knitting Magazine, you could mention that you are a prolific knitter and you edited a student magazine at university.\n\nOpportunities for progression. For example, internal qualifications, networking opportunities or management training schemes.\n\nYou want to work in a professional, team-oriented environment which values collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\nYou love analytical and logical problem-solving.\n\nExample answers related to why you want the job:\n\n“I want to work here because this organization’s values align with my own. I’m impressed with the work you do to improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of care. I believe that this is a place where I can make a meaningful contribution to the healthcare field while also growing and developing my skills.”\n\n“This role is an excellent fit for my skills and experience. I am confident that I have the necessary technical skills and knowledge required for the role, and I’m excited about the opportunity to take on new challenges and responsibilities.”\n\n“I’m excited about the opportunity to work with a team of highly skilled and dedicated healthcare professionals. From my research on this organization, I can see that you place a strong emphasis on collaboration and teamwork, and I believe that this is an environment where I can thrive and make a positive contribution.”\n\n2. Think About Your Career Goals and How They Align With the Company’s\n\nA short-term career goal might be to gain more experience in customer service. Whereas a long-term goal might be to aspire to a management position. Make sure your career goal is relevant to the job role.\n\nHere are some examples of how you can link your career goals with the company’s objectives:\n\nFor the role of Product Designer – The company makes a product which has inspired you to enter the industry and your career goal is to design similar products.\n\nFor the role of Healthcare Assistant – You are passionate about providing exceptional healthcare and you always aspire to improve your level of care. This is also a value prioritised by the company.\n\nFor the role of Private Client Paralegal – You value developing close professional relationships with clients and your goal is to build a legal career in private client work.\n\nExample answers related to your career goals:\n\n“I want to work here because I believe this company is at the forefront of innovation in the industry, and I’m passionate about being a part of a team that’s shaping the future of healthcare. This aligns with my career goal of continuously learning and growing while contributing to an organization’s success.”\n\n“I’m excited about this opportunity because I believe that working for this company will help me achieve my career goal of becoming an expert in my field. The company’s reputation for providing high-quality care and emphasis on continuous learning aligns with my personal and professional goals.”\n\n“I’m eager to work for this company because I believe it offers excellent career development opportunities. My career goal is to advance into a leadership role, and I know that this company has a track record of promoting from within and investing in their employees’ growth.”\n\n3. Think About Why You Want to Work at This Company in Particular\n\nMake sure you read the company’s website and any news articles you can find. A company’s blog can also be useful, since it will list important projects the company has worked on and focus on topics which are of value to the company.\n\nIf you have any connections within your network who have worked with the company, it’s also a good idea to speak with them to find out more about the company from someone who has experienced it first-hand.\n\nSome other ideas to think about when undertaking your research are:\n\nWhy you admire the company – Is it a front-runner in developing a ground-breaking software? Or is it one of the only companies in the country which specialises in aviation law? Make sure your reasons are specific to demonstrate you have done your research.\n\nHas the company undertaken any projects that particularly interest you, and why? – As well as the company’s blog, check whether they have listed any case studies on their website which provide more insight into the work they do.\n\nCan you identify the company’s short and long-term objectives? – A short-term objective might be to reward employees who volunteer for the company’s corporate social responsibility programme. A long-term objective might be a target for the number of annual employee hours dedicated to corporate social responsibility.\n\nWhat are the company’s values? – For example, a bank might foster a culture of sustainable lending. Or a healthcare organisation might promote their staff’s caring and attentive approach to their work.\n\nExample answers related to the company:\n\n“I’m excited about working for this company because of its excellent reputation in the industry. I believe that working for a well-respected and established organization will give me access to opportunities and experiences that will help me grow my career.”\n\n“I’m passionate about the company’s mission to improve patient outcomes and provide high-quality care. This is a purpose that resonates with me, and I’m eager to be a part of a team that’s making a positive impact on people’s lives.”\n\n“I want to work here because I’ve heard great things about the company culture and the supportive work environment. I believe that working in a positive and collaborative atmosphere will allow me to perform at my best and contribute meaningfully to the team.”\n\nWhy Do You Want to Work in Our Company? – Five Typical Mistakes Candidates Make\n\nBefore delving into how you answer the ‘Why do you want to work here?’ question, here is some advice on how not to approach it.\n\n1. Humour\n\nMost interviewers will not appreciate a humorous answer. It makes you appear insincere or suggests that you don’t know how to answer the question.\n\nAvoid:\n\nI’m only here for the money.\n\nYou look like you could use my help.\n\n2. Ambiguity\n\nThe interviewer doesn’t want to hear vague compliments about how their company “looks really cool”. Ambiguous answers will indicate that you haven’t done any research on the organisation or thought about why you want the job at all.\n\nAvoid:\n\nI just think the work looks fun.\n\n3. Not Relating Your Answer to the Job or Company\n\nIt is surprising how often candidates forget to mention the job they are applying for altogether.\n\nAvoid:\n\nI liked your website.\n\nYou have bean-bag chairs in the break area, which is a nice touch.\n\n4. Being Too Honest\n\nEven if you’re just here for the money, don’t confess this to your interviewer. Never lie, but keep your answer focused on the job role and why you would be a great addition to the company.\n\nAvoid:\n\nI need to pay the rent somehow.\n\nThis isn’t my dream job, but it seems tolerable.\n\n5. Saying You Don’t Know\n\nIf you cannot come up with a single reason why the company should hire you, they probably won’t.\n\n“Why Do You Want to Work in Our Company” Similar Questions: How They Are Different\n\nThere are many variations of the ‘Why do you want to work here?’ question that you may be asked at interview. Here are some examples of similar questions which ask the same thing:\n\n“Why do you want this job?”\n\n“What are you looking for in your next job?”\n\n“Why did you apply for this position?”\n\nHowever, make sure you listen carefully to the question you are being asked; some will require a different answer than you first expect. Never repeat a pre-prepared response without listening carefully to the question. For example:\n\n“What qualities can you bring to this role?”\n\nThis question differs because it focuses less on what you personally think about the role. Instead, talk about your specific achievements and how you can apply your skills to the job.\n\nExample answer:\n\nAs well as my ability to manage and administer pension claims, I have a unique background in data management and analysis.\n\nFor example, in my previous role, I was part of a project recording and analysing the causes of delayed pension payments. This led to the implementation of improved payment administration policies. I will be looking for opportunities to use my skills within this role.\n\nThis answer is good because the candidate has specified a unique skill which will set them apart from the other candidates and backed it up with an example.\n\n“Why should we hire you?”\n\nThis question is used to single out the very best of the qualified candidates. We have a whole article about this one question.\n\nThe interviewer wants to know:\n\nWhether you will do the job better than everybody else.\n\nWhether you will fit into the company’s culture.\n\nIt differs from the ‘Why do you want to work here?’ question because it is less about your personal interest in the job and more about what you can do for the company.\n\nCome up with at least three reasons you stand out from the crowd. For example:\n\nYou have experience in this industry;\n\nYour past achievements demonstrate a proven track record;\n\nYou have relevant awards;\n\nYou have relevant qualifications or further education;\n\nYour soft skills (such as communication skills) are especially strong (and proven);\n\nYou have specific technical skills (such as knowledge of certain programming languages).\n\nExample answer:\n\nI have over 8 years of experience working with clients to deliver successful projects. As part of this, I have developed great relationships with my clients and other team members.\n\nThis contributes to my ability to manage teams and get results. Last year I led a team that won an industry award for a national project.\n\n“How are you a good fit for this company?”\n\nThis question differs because it focuses on your understanding of the company’s culture and what skills you can contribute.\n\nEnsure you research the company and its values. Think about how your own goals and values coincide. Then answer the question by:\n\nDescribing your interpretation of the company’s culture.\n\nExplaining how you fit into that culture (including specific examples).\n\nHere are some ideas to think about when interpreting the company’s culture:\n\nDoes the company value collaboration?\n\nDoes the company value internal progression?\n\nAre there any mentoring schemes?\n\nWhat is the company’s attitude to work/life balance?\n\nExample answer:\n\nI love that [company] promotes supportive attitudes in its employees. At my current job, we also have a culture of support, especially when a tight deadline is coming up.\n\nFor example, I recently worked two weeks’ overtime to help a colleague compile the civil disclosure for a massive fraud case.\n\nI love how stimulating and exciting that kind of work can be. Therefore, I think I will fit in well within your team where everyone comes together to work to similar tight deadlines.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nPreparing to answer interview questions can be daunting, but follow the advice in this article and you will arrive at your interview prepared to impress.
