Nothing helps keep people on their toes than silly questions.Â\n\nHere are random questions to build team bonds:\n\nIn your opinion, what's the most important invention in history?\n\nWhat's your go-to strategy for breaking awkward silences?\n\nWhat's on your nightstand?Â\n\nWhat did you eat last night for dinner?\n\nWhat's your favorite kind of workout?\n\nWhat musician do you think is underrated?\n\nWhat's your most embarrassing childhood memory?Â\n\nWhat's the most embarrassing thing you've done on a client call?\n\nWhere's the last place you drove to?\n\nWhat's the strangest thing in your fridge?\n\nWhatâs your go-to playlist on a road trip?\n\nIf our team came to your place for dinner, what would you cook?\n\nâ\n\nReflective Team Building Questions\n\nWhy Use Them: How often does your team pause to reflect throughout the workday? If the answer is \"rarely\" or \"never,\" use your meeting to ask more reflective questions. This tactic will help relax team members who are a little stressed and need to slow down while enticing others to share things they normally wouldn't like how they think, feel, and process things.Â\n\nHere are reflective questions for team building:Â Â\n\nWhat's something you never thought you would do but did?\n\nWhat cliche or phrase do you most live by?\n\nHow do you unwind after a long day?\n\nWhen you're feeling down, how can team members cheer you up?\n\nWhat is the best advice you've ever received?\n\nHow do you best learn new information?\n\nHow does this team challenge you to be better?\n\nMy favorite way to spend the day is ___________.Â\n\nWhat image, smell, or sound triggers nostalgia for you?\n\nWhat team project required you to learn a new skill that you appreciate?\n\nWhat's the most spontaneous thing you've ever done?

These themed questions are especially great if it's your team's first holiday season together. Knowing everyone's holiday traditions and festive favorites will help your team get to know each other, and it may even spark ideas for team holiday outings and activities!Â\n\nHere are fun holiday-themed questions:Â\n\nWhich holidays do you celebrate in winter?\n\nWhat's your favorite holiday dish?\n\nWhat's the best holiday gift you've ever received?\n\nWhat's your go-to scary movie to watch in October?\n\nWhat's your favorite childhood Halloween costume (if you celebrated Halloween)?\n\nWhat's your go-to drink at a holiday party?\n\nDid you believe in Santa Clause as a kid?

With a small group, you'll have more time for people to share in-depth answers, which is always great if you want to strengthen and build bonds.Â\n\nHere are questions to increase camaraderie on small teams:.Â\n\nHow do you get motivated for difficult tasks?\n\nHow do you recognize when you're stressed?\n\nWhat's the last thing you did for the first time?\n\nWhat feedback from a team member did you appreciate receiving?Â\n\nWhat's an album you think has no bad songs on it?\n\nWhat's an underrated skill everyone on the team can benefit from?\n\nWhat's the most memorable thing you bought with your first salary?\n\nâ\n\nTeam Building Questions for Large Groups\n\nWhy Use Them: If you have a large team, you may not be able to give team members an equal amount of time to contemplate and answer thought-provoking questions, especially if you're in a time crunch. So, when you have a big group and don't have much time to break the ice, ask questions that require little to no time for team members to answer.Â\n\nHere are questions to build deeper bonds on big teams:\n\nÂ What's your favorite ice cream topping?\n\nWhat color best describes your personality?\n\nWhat is your favorite part about working at the company?\n\nÂ Where did you grow up?\n\nÂ What's your favorite food?\n\nWhere did you go on your last vacation?\n\nWho knows you best?\n\nÂ Where's the last restaurant you went to?\n\nMy go-to karaoke song is _________.\n\nÂ What's your favorite hobby?\n\nÂ What's the last show you've binge-watched?\n\nBonus â large groups might benefit from a display of their answers, like a live poll or a graph. There are easy ways to do this! See the interactive presentations below.\n\nThese are slide decks that are also interactive. They're easy to use, just launch an event (like you would a PowerPoint presentation) and let your larger group join in with a QR code scan (they don't need to download anything). Then they can send in responses easily, and you can display them in agraph automatically, with no extra work on your part.\n\nâ\n\nTeam Building Questions for Work\n\nWhy Use Them: Tailoring your questions to work is a great way to keep your team focused on work while still having fun and providing an opportunity to learn about each other.Â\n\nHere are engaging questions for work:Â\n\nWhat is your favorite team-building activity?\n\nWhat's the best compliment you've received from a team member?\n\nWhat's the best advice you've received from a coworker?\n\nWhat was your dream job as a kid?\n\nWhich team member do you think is most likely to escape a deserted island alive?\n\nWhich team member do you think would be the best comedian?\n\nWhat skill do you admire in one of your team members?\n\nWhat is your favorite part about working at the company?\n\nWhat surprised you most about working in this industry?\n\nâ\n\nâThis or Thatâ Team Building Questions\n\nWhy Use Them: Why not gamify your team building questions by playing \"This or That\"? Not only is this a fun way for your team to build bonds and discover new things about each other, but it's also great if you're short on time and need quick questions to ask.Â\n\nHere are fun âthis or thatâ questions for team building:\n\nDogs or cats?\n\nSummer or winter?\n\nSpring or fall?\n\nCoffee or tea?\n\nHot or cold?\n\nIce cream or cake?\n\nOcean or mountains?\n\nZoom or Teams?Â\n\nMorning person or night owl?\n\nDrive or fly?\n\nDine in or takeout?\n\nAndroid or iPhone?\n\nSports game or concert?\n\nâ\n\nTrivia Team Building Questions\n\nWhy Use Them: Everyone loves trivia, and playing it to increase your team connection will be an idea all your employees love! Also, these questions are especially fun and relevant when they test your employees' knowledge about the company and each other.Â\n\nHereâs are engaging trivia questions to build team bonds:\n\nWhat's our company tagline or motto?\n\nWho founded our company?\n\nHow many people work in our organization?\n\nWhatâs one position weâre hiring for in the department?\n\nWhatâs the last thing we posted on Instagram?\n\nWhatâs the title of one blog post on our website?\n\nWhich person has been on the team the longest?\n\nÂ Who's been at the company the longest?\n\nâ\n\nTeam Building Get-to-Know-You Questions\n\nWhy Use Them: Do you have a newer team or, at the very least, a new person on your team? If so, you should definitely ask get-to-know-you questions for work! These questions will ease any tension that comes with being a newer team or the newest person on a team and give everyone a chance to start on a positive, confident note.Â\n\nHere are unique get-to-know you questions:\n\nDo you have a pet? If so, what kind and whatâs their name?\n\nWhat's a sport or instrument you played as a kid?\n\nWhat's your favorite family tradition?\n\nWho was your celebrity crush as a kid?\n\nWho's your longest-time friend? How long have you been friends?\n\nWhat was your least favorite thing to eat as a kid?\n\nDo you have any siblings? If so, how many?\n\nWhat was your favorite PE activity in gym class?\n\nWho's the funniest person in your family?\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHow to Implement Questions for Team BuildingÂ\n\nRegardless of which questions you ask to help your team get to know each other, you need to approach them correctly. Here are step-by-step tips on how to incorporate team building questions into your meetings:Â\n\nBefore the meeting, pick the questions you'll ask.\n\nPrior to the meeting, determine the order of response. If the meeting will be in person, sit at a table and have team members respond one by one around the circle. If youâre doing a virtual or hybrid meeting, answer each question first. Then, pick a team member to answer next. Afterward, that person should pick who goes next and so on.Â\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, explain that you all will be answering team building questions. Tell everyone the category of questions and the order of responses.Â\n\nStart asking questions to build camaraderie!Â\n\nInvest in Your Team's Connection\n\nTeam building activities like fun Q&As are one of the best things you can do to increase your team's success! In fact, enhancing your team's camaraderie is the best investment you can make.Â\n\nDespite its reputation for being, well, lame, team building is the most important investment you can make for your people. It builds trust, mitigates conflict, encourages communication, and increases collaboration. Effective team building means more engaged employees, which is good for company culture and boosting the bottom line.\n\n- Brian Scudamore, Why Team Building Is The Most Important Investment You'll MakeÂ\n\nIf you want your team's success to reach new heights, do them a favor by asking fun questions for team building at the beginning of your staff meetings. By investing in your team's connection, you'll invest in your company's success."
