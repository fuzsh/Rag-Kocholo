Colors are necessary for communication and expression—whether you’re complimenting someone’s eyes, asking your hairstylist about hair dye, or describing the dog you saw on your morning walk.\n\nReady to add some color to your Spanish knowledge? Let’s get started.\n\nList of colors in Spanish\n\nSpanish is a colorful language, but naming every single color visible to the eye would be impractical. Instead, we’ve narrowed down the list to 15 common colors in Spanish that are essential to know.\n\nSpanish words to describe and classify colors\n\nWhile our list of colors isn’t exhaustive, you can easily add more Spanish color vocabulary to your repertoire by picking up a few adjectives. Knowing how to talk about different colors with a variety of tones and shades will easily make your Spanish conversations more colorful!\n\nHere is a list of handy Spanish adjectives and phrases you can use to describe colors in more detail.\n\nWhen using these adjectives to modify a color, they follow the name of the color.\n\nFor example:\n\nI bought a pastel blue dress. = Compré un vestido azul pastel.\n\nThe bicycle is neon green. = La bicicleta es verde fluorescente.\n\nThe primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. = Los colores primarios son el rojo, azul, y amarillo.\n\nHow to use Spanish colors in sentences\n\nBefore you start using the color words in your conversations, here are a few important Spanish grammar rules to know.\n\n1. Sentence structure\n\nColors are adjectives when they’re used to describe nouns. Like most adjectives in Spanish, the color words go after the noun that they modify. The correct structure for using color words in sentences is: “el/la + (noun) + (color).”\n\nExamples:\n\nThe red apple = la manzana roja\n\nThe brown dog = el perro marrón\n\n2. Gender and number agreement for colors\n\nIn Spanish, adjectives must agree with the gender and number of the noun they describe. Colors are no exception!\n\nAny color that ends in “o” in Spanish changes its ending to match the gender of the noun.\n\nFor example, blanco changes to blanca when describing a feminine noun.\n\nThe white cat = el gato blanco\n\nThe white house = la casa blanca\n\nOn the other hand, colors that don’t end in “o” won’t change their spelling. For example, gris is used for both masculine and feminine nouns.\n\nThe gray cat = el gato gris\n\nThe gray house = la casa gris\n\nBy default, Spanish color words are singular. To make a color match plural nouns, add “s” if the word ends in a vowel and add “es” if the word ends in a consonant.\n\nBlanco ends in a vowel, so add “s” at the end to match plural nouns.\n\nThe white cats = los gatos blancos\n\nThe white houses = las casas blancas\n\nTo make gris plural, add “es” to the ending.\n\nThe gray cats = los gatos grises\n\nThe gray houses = las casas grises\n\n3. Colors with adjectives are always masculine and singular\n\nOne exception to the previous rule is when you use color modifiers in Spanish. When the color is modified by another adjective, there is no need to change the ending to match the gender. No matter what the number and gender of the noun is, the color words will always be masculine and singular.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe light orange cat = el gato anaranjado claro\n\nThe light orange cats = los gatos anaranjado claro\n\nThe light orange house = la casa anaranjado claro\n\nThe light orange houses = las casas anaranjado claro\n\n4. Describe nouns using de color\n\nAnother way to describe the color of a noun is by using the following structure: “ser/estar + de color + (color).” With this sentence structure, you don’t have to worry about matching the color to the number and gender of the noun. You’ll always use the masculine singular form to match “el color”.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe car is silver. = El coche es de color plateado.\n\nThe shirts are black. = Las camisetas son de color negro.\n\n5. Colors as nouns are always masculine\n\nWhen using color words as nouns, they’re always masculine and should be preceded by the masculine articles el or los.\n\nFor example:\n\nMy favorite color is light pink. = Mi color favorito es el rosado claro.\n\nI prefer the color green to the color yellow. = Prefiero el color verde que el color amarillo.\n\nI don’t like warm colors. = No me gustan los colores cálidos.\n\nColors in Spanish for describing people\n\nIn English, you can use the word “brown” to describe both someone’s hair and eye colors. In Spanish, however, there are specific words for describing the colors of people’s physical characteristics. Use the following vocabulary to talk about people’s hair, skin, and eye colors in Spanish.\n\nHair colors in Spanish = Colores de cabello\n\nEye colors in Spanish = Colores de ojos\n\nSkin colors in Spanish = Colores de piel\n\nTo express that someone’s body part is a certain color, use the structure: “tener + (article) + body part + (color).” Make sure that the color matches the number and gender of the noun!\n\nExamples:\n\nI have blonde hair. = Tengo el cabello rubio.\n\nThe dog has green eyes. = El perro tiene los ojos verdes.\n\nMy sister has brown skin. = Mi hermana tiene la piel morena.\n\nPaint your world with Spanish\n\nNow that you have a wide range of Spanish color vocabulary under your belt, your conversations are about to be a lot more colorful!
