        "text": "Choosing the right logo color scheme for your brand can make a significant impact on memorability and awareness.\n\nIn fact, 75% of people recognize a brand by its logo, and 45% identify brands based on their brand colors. Simply put, your brand colors matter.\n\nWhether you’re going through a rebrand or starting your business from scratch, here’s some inspiration for logo color combinations that you can use to create a memorable brand icon.\n\nUnderstanding Color Theory and Meanings\n\n25 Logo Color Scheme Examples\n\nUnderstanding Color Theory and Meanings\n\nBefore we dive into brand logo color combinations, it’s important to understand general color theory.\n\nThere are a few ways to create an aesthetically pleasing color palette. A common way is by choosing complementary colors.\n\nComplementary colors are pairs of colors that sit directly across each other on the color wheel.\n\nWhen you put complementary colors next to each other in a design, they create a high degree of contrast (i.e., both colors stick out), and the result is usually quite harmonious.\n\nOf course, complementary colors aren’t the only combination of colors that can make for a pleasing palette. There are also:\n\nAnalogous colors — Colors that appear next to each other on the color wheel.\n\nTriadic colors — Three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.\n\nSplit-complementary colors — These consist of a base color plus the two colors adjacent to the base color’s complement on the color wheel.\n\nHere’s a diagram to help you understand these combinations better:\n\nNow, truth be told, several other types of color combinations are based on the color wheel — these are just the most basic. By understanding how different colors are oriented on the color wheel, you can make more harmonious color choices.\n\nAnother element to consider when choosing a color combination for your brand’s logo is the different meanings of each color. For instance, red usually symbolizes passion and intensity, whereas green can represent growth or wealth.\n\n99designs provides an excellent explainer video of the most popular colors and their meanings in the video below:\n\n[Video: What your logo colors say about your business… Discover the meaning behind the 11 most common colors ]\n\n25 Logo Color Scheme Examples\n\nIf you’re looking for examples of different logo color combinations your brand can choose from, check out these examples from real-life companies. There are a few color combination categories that logos typically fall under, which include:\n\nMonochrome logos — Logos that have a single prominent color and may be supported with neutral accent colors like white or black.\n\nTwo-color logos — Logos with two prominent colors.\n\nMulti-color logos — Logos with more than two colors.\n\nMonochrome Logos\n\n1. Starbucks: Green\n\nOne of the most recognized logos worldwide, Starbucks has developed an iconic color scheme that demonstrates the power of green. “Starbucks Green” is a shade of green that’s hard to associate with any other company due to how well the coffee company has positioned itself and its logo.\n\nThe brand uses a “family of greens” in its full-color palette, which the company describes as “fresh and inviting.” Starbucks’ color palette is a perfect example of a monochromatic color scheme.\n\nInstead of thinking of the green, dark green, and light green in Starbucks’ palette as separate colors, think of them as different flavors of the same color. Or, more accurately, various flavors of the same hue.\n\nHere’s a quick explanation of hue and other related terms:\n\nHue. What we usually mean when we talk about color. The hue is the overarching, discerning quality of a color (e.g., “green” or “blue”).\n\nShade. What you get when you add black to a particular hue (e.g., dark green is a shade of green).\n\nTint. What you get when you add white to a particular hue (e.g., light green is a tint of green).\n\nTone. What you get when you add black and white — a.k.a. gray — to a particular hue (e.g., pastel green is a tone of green).\n\nSaturation. While “tone” is a popular painting term, in graphic design, you’ll be more likely to encounter the term “saturation” when dealing with adding gray to color. More specifically, saturation defines a range of colors, starting with gray (0% saturation) and ending with a pure, gray-less form of the color (100% saturation). Desaturated colors are softer and potentially duller than their vivid and highly saturated counterparts.\n\nShades of green create a fresh look and can communicate growth and prosperity and connect your brand with nature, making it a good brand color scheme for companies in the food and beverage or outdoor industries.\n\n2. McDonald’s: Yellow\n\nRecognized worldwide, McDonald’s has created one of the most iconic logos with its golden yellow arches.\n\nIn terms of color psychology, yellow, the prominent color in McDonald’s color palette, is associated with both energy and happiness — which is undoubtedly the feeling McDonald’s wants to invoke in its customers.\n\nWhile yellow is the brand’s primary color, McDonald’s also uses accents of red in its branding. Red is the most emotionally charged color around, so it’s unsurprising that McDonald’s employs it in their logo: They want you to feel energized and excited.\n\n3. Meta: Blue\n\nBlue is one of the most common logo colors. In fact, one study of 500 company logos found that 37% were blue. Black was a close second at 31%. Blue is a reliable color that conveys positive feelings that many companies would likely want to express, such as trust, security, and intelligence.\n\nMeta’s logo color scheme includes a blue gradient as the primary color for its logo symbol.
