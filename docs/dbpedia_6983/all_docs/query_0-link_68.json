When you are young or learning a language for the very first time, you will be taught the names of some very common colours, like white, black, red, green, blue, etc. But you should be aware of the fact that there are many more colours than the ones you learn as a child. Check out the article to learn more.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNames of Colours in English\n\nList of 50+ Colour Names\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on the Names of Colours\n\nNames of Colours in English\n\nGenerally, we learn the names of colours by associating them with objects having these colours. There are also activities conducted nowadays, where the names of the colours are written with different colours, and students will be asked to identify the colour in which the word is written and not the word itself (a colour name). This is an activity that is used not just to teach colour names to kids but also to improve their reasoning skills.\n\n‘Did you see the girl in the red dress?’ You would often come across such questions in your daily lives. Colours are used for the sake of identifying both animate and inanimate objects. So, calling a magenta-coloured dress a red dress will not help. Learning the names of different colours will help you in ways that you would not be able to foresee. Have a look at the list below.\n\nList of 50+ Colour Names\n\nCheck out the following table to learn the names of different colours and find out how many of them you already know."
