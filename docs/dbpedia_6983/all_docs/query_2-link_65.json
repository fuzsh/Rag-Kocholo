        "text": "The colored part of the eye is known as the iris, which contains pigments that determine a person’s eye color.\n\nEye color is largely genetic. As many as 16 genes dictate what a person’s eye color will be. Most of these genes play a role in the production, transportation, or storage of melanin. Melanin is a brown pigment that determines the color not only of someone’s eyes, but also their hair and skin.\n\nThe more melanin in the eyes, the browner they are. Eyes that are not brown do not have different color pigments. Instead, they have less melanin. An iris with the least melanin will appear blue, while those with a little more melanin may appear green or hazel.\n\nScientists used to think that just one gene determined eye color, and that brown eyes were dominant over blue eyes. They now know that what determines eye color is more complex.\n\nThe vast majority of people in the world have brown eyes. The second most common color is blue, but people can also have hazel, green, or gray eyes.\n\nBrown eyes\n\nAccording to a 2020 study, 79% people worldwide have brown eyes, making brown the most common eye color.\n\nIt may also be one of the oldest eye colors in humans. Around 10,000 years ago, everyone on Earth had brown eyes. The melanin helps protect the eyes from the sun, which is why brown eyes are most common in countries in Africa and Asia.\n\nPeople with brown eyes may be less likely to develop eye cancer, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy than those with lighter eyes. However, brown-eyed people may be more at risk of cataracts as they get older. The reasons for this are unclear.\n\nBlue eyes\n\nBlue is the second most common eye color globally, with estimates suggesting that 8 to 10% of people have this eye color. In the U.S., that proportion is higher, at about 27%. In countries such as Iceland, blue is the majority eye color.\n\nAll people with blue eyes share the same genetic trait, meaning they likely descend from one common ancestor.\n\nHazel\n\nApproximately 5% of the world’s population and 18% of people in the U.S. have hazel eyes. Hazel eyes are a mixture of green and brown, but can also contain amber or gold hues.\n\nGreen\n\nAround 2% of the world’s population have green eyes, making them very rare overall. In the U.S., about 9% of people have green eyes.\n\nGray\n\nGlobally, gray is a rare eye color.\n\nPeople with gray eyes have little or no melanin in their irises, but they have more collagen in a part of the eye called the stroma. The light scatters off the collagen in a way that makes the eyes appear gray.\n\nRed or violet\n\nHumans do not naturally have red or violet eyes. Occasionally, though, people with albinism can appear to have red or violet eyes in certain lights. This is a product of light hitting blood vessels at the back of the eye.\n\nAs eye pigmentation is important for vision, people with ocular albinism can have visual symptoms, such as:\n\nblurry vision\n\nreduced depth perception\n\nlongsightedness or nearsightedness\n\nrapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus)\n\nlight sensitivity (photophobia)\n\nproblems with the macula, or center of the retina\n\nMultiple colors\n\nHeterochromia, in which a person has more than one eye color, is uncommon. There are no up-to-date statistics on how prevalent it is globally.\n\nIn heterochromia, the two eyes might be completely different from one another, or one part of the iris might be different than the rest. If the inner and outer rings of the iris are different, a person has central heterochromia. If each eye is completely different in color, a person has complete heterochromia.\n\nSome people are born with heterochromia. In others, an eye injury or health problem might cause it."
