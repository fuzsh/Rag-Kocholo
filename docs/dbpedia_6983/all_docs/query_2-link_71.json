        "text": "Color Groups\n\nOne way to approach colors is to classify them into two broad groups: warm and cool colors (Figure 1). Reds, oranges, and yellows are referred to as warm colors. They tend to pop out and attract attention—especially a bright red. Greens, blues, and purples are cool colors. They tend to recede into the background and draw less attention, especially darker shades. White and very light colors also catch the eye, whereas black and very dark colors generally are less noticeable.\n\nFigure 1 – Color Groups\n\nNote, however, that above effects are not absolutely fixed. They can flip. The quantity and contrast of one color compared to another also comes into play. For example, if we place small black shapes on a solid white slide background, the black shapes pop out as more noticeable, versus the sea of white around them (Figure 2). In this case, the brain is more interested in figuring out if shapes communicate some form of meaning or pattern, rather than merely reacting to their color characteristics. Not surprisingly, some optical illusions take advantage of this phenomenon.\n\nFigure 2 – Color Quantity and Contrast\n\nConsider the color groups, as well as quantity and contrast, when combining colors on slides. It’s pretty safe to combine warm colors with each other and shades of brown (Figure 3) or cool colors with each other and shades of gray (Figure 4). White, black, and beige are neutral colors and go well with all colors in either group.\n\nFigure 3 – Warm Colors Group\n\nFigure 4 – Cool Colors Group\n\nWhere most PowerPoint designers get into trouble is combining colors across the warm/cool boundary. Absolutely NEVER do what is depicted in Figures 5 and 6. If you stare at either of these images for very long, your eyes begin screaming. They have trouble distinguishing interactions between the color wavelengths, resulting in fatigue and discomfort. Mixing bright blues and reds is a terrible practice to inflict upon audiences, and unfortunately it happens all too often. The same goes with mixing reds and greens.\n\nFigure 5 – Red and Blue Color Combinations Cause Eye Strain\n\nFigure 6 – Red and Green Color Combinations also Cause Eye Strain\n\nA red and green combination also brings up the issue of color blindness, which apparently affects approximately 7 percent of men and 1 percent of women. Inability to notice the difference between red and green colors is the most common form of color blindness. For example, let’s say you place green text on a red background, as in Figure 6. If the text color’s shading (amount of darkness) has little contrast with the background color’s shading, some viewers will not be able to read that text at all! Avoid such problems by never mixing these two colors, especially in a text versus background combination.\n\nJulie Terberg, a graphic designer and PowerPoint MVP, also points out that using the themes in PowerPoint can make your color combination choices easier (Figure 7). Theme colors have been chosen to look good together (although, still use caution) and to work well in both light and dark presentation environments.\n\nFigure 7 – Using Theme Colors Make Your Choices Easier\n\nThe Forgiving Nature of Color Gradients\n\nInterestingly enough, the process of combining colors is much more forgiving when using gradients—colors that fade into each other. PowerPoint offers a greatly improved, user-friendly interface for making gradients, by the way (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8 – Adding a Gradient to a Shape\n\nBecause nature regularly blends colors this way (think of a sunset), we are used to seeing colors gradually transition from one hue to the next, meaning that you can get away with combining just about any color set and still end up with a reasonably attractive and professional look. Just make sure the transitions are gradual.\n\nTry blending colors to make a custom-designed slide background, a decorative shape—perhaps for a sectional background (Figure 9) or navigation button (Figure 10)—or even jazzy, 3-D text (Figure 11).\n\nFigure 9 – Purple, Gold and Gray Gradient inside a Shape\n\nFigure 10 – Gradient-filled Shape used as a Navigation Button\n\nFigure 11 – Gradient-filled PowerPoint Text"
