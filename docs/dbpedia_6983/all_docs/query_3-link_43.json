        "text": "This one was hard for me üëá I always had this thing about my curly hair... ‚û∞ I loved it, but it didn't feel \"professional\" to me. I would admire the women who would show up with their hair straight, smooth, controlled and dare I say \"perfect\". üë±‚ôÄÔ∏è Whereas anyone with curly hair will know... there are no two moments that your hair will look the same.üòÖ So - I straightened it. The hardest part was getting over this and showing up on camera with my natural curls. But - it was the best thing I could've ever done! Because people recognized ME. I recognized ME. It's so easy to get caught up in wanting \"perfect\", especially when it comes to creating videos. I'm not saying you shouldn't aim for a professional and polished image. That's important. But if you're spending most of your energy and time on trying to make yourself appear to be someone you're not, you might just find that it will work against you. The brain is very quick to pick up on inconsistencies. Your clients might not consciously say that something is off, but internally they feel it. And that impacts the way they connect with you. Let your audience see the real you‚Äîit's the most powerful branding you could have üí™üèº #socialmediatips #royallepage #torontobrokerages #durhambrokerages #realestatetips\n\nWIGS AND COMPROMISE There was a time I went to a hair shop with a friend of mine. She wanted to get a closure for her human hair. Then we saw one very beautiful wig on a manikin. My God! The wig was fineeeee. We were literally gushing over it. Asked for the price and it was pretty reasonable considering the type of hair, the texture, the way it was full and it even had a frontal. You needed to have seen this wig. Ladies can actually relate to this üòÅ The people selling the wig even had an option of paying in installments if maybe you couldn't pay in full. My heart was in a frenzy, should I or should I not buy? Well, a part of me really wanted to buy. Who doesn't want to rock a fine hair? I mean. Well, I had priorities and it was way pass my budget even if I wanted to get it. But who cares when it came to things like that? As women, we can throw caution to the wind; tomorrow will take care of itself right? Well, I didn't throw caution to the wind please. Inasmuch as I wanted it, it wasn't top of my list and I just couldn't afford it at that moment. I had other pressing, more important things that needed my money. There are times when you will have to make a compromise concerning some choices or desires. There are some things you will really crave to have but is it worth sacrificing other more important things for? Desires are good but how we handle them is what really matters. Learn to have a scale of preference for every of your desire. You see this our heart? It will always want many things but it takes YOU to know which is a want or need, which is top priority or least. Some things are not worth sacrificing for your present cravings/wants/desires. Choose wisely. #linkedin #storytelling #ngo\n\nThoughtfulness is an art form. It's a way that we can make others feel seen and appreciated through simple gestures. Want to share a random act of kindness with someone you love? These are a few of our favorite things... 1. Trending: hair accessories that make a statement. @maxinemakes understood the assignment‚Äîand designed the bow we'll be wearing all spring and summer. 2. When life imitates art, and @leifshop makes your go-to updo all the more chic. 3. Because we're always tempted to take more hors d'oeuvres than we can pile in one hand. These pink and red linen napkins from @maisonbalzac keep us honest‚Äîand prepared to go back for seconds. 4. A flask that looks like a pickle (and can fit in your purse). Need we say more? Clearly not, @motherdenim says it all. 5. Because your AM detangling sesh should spark joy. This Shark Horn Comb does exactly that. 6. The spring 2024 vibe: whenever possible, put a bow on it. Whether it be your hair, a gift, or anything in need of a little adornment, @shopbanshee ribbons have you covered. XKED\n\n‚ÄòWow, your hair is so beautiful.‚Äô That‚Äôs the first thing a wonderful woman said to me in a coffee shop the other day. She was talking about my grey hair. What y‚Äôall can‚Äôt likely see on pictures of me as cameras tend to pick up the brown, is that my hair is completely natural and when you see me IRL, you can see I have fully integrated grey/light brown hair. But just as fast she said; 'I love it on you, but I could never get away with it.' She would be exquisite with grey hair, so I told her that too. As I walked away, I realised that I used to say the same thing about having short hair, and then years later, rocked a short hairstyle like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. ‚ÄòI love it on you, but I could never get away with it‚Ä¶ my face is the wrong shape.' It stemmed from a deep belief that I wasn't enough. Enough of what...? Pretty much anything. As I reflected on it further, I realised that I used to say the same thing as I watched people take big jobs and grow in their career. 'Wow, you so deserve it, I couldn't so that, [insert reason here - too silly, too playful, too loud, not clever enough]‚Äô Real talk? I devalued myself around others all the time. I made myself smaller, I made them better in my mind, I confirmed to myself that I was less. Then the 'great levelling' happened. By becoming intentional about spending more time with people who sat at the top table of organisations I realised something magical. They were just the same as me... a bunch of humans trying to figure it out. The only thing that divided us was that they were sitting at that top table and I wasn‚Äôt. So I started to push, and soon it was me too. I wasn‚Äôt just at the leadership table, I was rocking it, just like that short hairstyle. The only way I found out who I really was and got to see all of my intelligence, my power and my beauty was by being courageous. By taking a risk and putting myself out there in some way. So my question to you, dear human, is; what‚Äôs the thing that you are admiring in others right now and thinking you can‚Äôt do‚Ä¶? You don't have to tell me. Just know that you would rock that haircut/job/life ü§òüèº\n\nHyphenation, comma or nothing. Academic papers favour conciseness. So, instead of saying \"There was, a girl, who was tall and lean and fair; her hair, her hair, was just the colour of ginger!!\" as the kids' game goes, alternatives are used. Tall and lean and fair becomes tall, lean, and fair. (The comma after lean is called an Oxford comma). There was a tall, lean, and fair girl. Here, tall, lean, and fair are adjectives that co-ordinate to describe the same noun, girl. So they can be separated by commas. Her hair was the colour of ginger. There was a tall, lean, fair girl; her hair was the colour of ginger. There was a tall, lean, fair girl, whose hair was of ginger colour. There was a tall, lean, fair girl with ginger-coloured hair. Ginger describes colour and coloured describes hair. They function together to describe hair. There was a tall, lean, fair, ginger-haired girl. If her hair colour was blonde, you could say: There was a tall, lean, fair, blonde girl. You can't say ginger girl or red girl, though. It changes the meaning. You can say, \"blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked, redhead.\" I don't know if this politically correct though. If we all lived in a bright yellow submarine, we wouldn't hyphenate it or use a comma. Bright describes yellow. Here the adjectives are cumulative. We could live in a yellow-green submarine though. But we would have to use an endash in place of the hyphen. samprƒÅpte sannihitƒì kƒÅle, kim - ·∏çu k·πõ√± kara·πáƒì - rakshati? nahi nahi. bhaja g≈çvindam. #commas #hyphens\n\nAs the calendar flipped from 2023 to 2024, I had a rendezvous with my hair & it was not your usual salon affair. I spent the last day of 2023 in an epic battle with multiple boxes of dye, transforming my locks from platinum blonde to copper, red & eventually, good ol‚Äô natural brunette. Why the change? Well, let me serve you a slice of my hairvolution story. For the past 14 months, I‚Äôd been riding the blonde wave. It was like being in a different movie‚Äîone where I played the blonde bombshell. Did blondes have more fun? Hmm, the jury‚Äôs out, but let‚Äôs just say it was quite the ride. Here‚Äôs the thing, as I peered into the mirror at the end of 2023, I realized that the blonde just wasn‚Äôt me, you know? So, I decided, with a metaphorical hair toss, to return to my roots‚Äîliterally & figuratively. I pulled a ‚Äòback to basics‚Äô move, an ode to my true self. And boy, does it feel liberating! Embracing the brunette vibe isn‚Äôt just a change in appearance; it‚Äôs a change in my mindset. I‚Äôm swapping out ‚Äòtrying to embrace me‚Äô for ‚Äòshamelessly af loving me,‚Äô and guess what? Me loves to write! So, I‚Äôm committing to scribbling my thoughts before I start the day‚Äîpenning down whatever floats my creative boat. In this self-discovery expedition, I‚Äôm tuning in to my body‚Äôs radio station. Yep, even when it‚Äôs playing songs I‚Äôd rather skip, I‚Äôm learning to listen up! Rest has now snagged a prime slot on my to-do list. I mean, why wait until I‚Äôm as exhausted as a Monday morning alarm clock, right? Then, there‚Äôs the new approach to my time and energy. It‚Äôs a big fat YES to things that light up my soul & a resounding NO to the snoozefest stuff. Life‚Äôs too short for boredom, right? Speaking of life, let‚Äôs talk investment‚ÄîI‚Äôm all about making sure my time, money & vibes are in alignment. It‚Äôs like putting together a killer outfit; everything‚Äôs got to match! But hold up, folks, this isn‚Äôt just a change of hair color; it‚Äôs a full-on celebration of the real me. It‚Äôs waving goodbye to the drama & hello to a full-on parade of authenticity. So here‚Äôs to the next chapter, the unapologetically real & naturally awesome ME!\n\nTwo weeks ago, I dyed my hair purple for a retreat where we dressed as our future selves ‚Äì and my future self rocked a sequin jacket and purple hair! It's something I've been wanting to do for years...like over 15 years. I had all the excuses (time, money, etc..) but it was really about fear. Fear of what others might think about me. So, how did I shift from being fearful to jumping in with both feet? I asked myself this question: Do you love yourself enough to let go? To let go of what others might think? It wasn't an easy shift. There were lots of conversations in my head. I had to get really quiet and present with myself and my voice and unplug from everyone else's. Ultimately, it came down to me realizing that if someone else came to me asking my opinion, I'd say \"go for it\". I decided to treat myself as those I love and do what tugged at my heartstrings (purple hair!). So, I took the leap and I love it! What about you? Is there somewhere in your life where you are feeling stuck? If fear is holding you back, try asking yourself the question: 'Do you love yourself enough to let go?' Share in the comments if this question resonates with you and what bubbles up as you ponder it.

(There is also Woman with facial hair now.) \"Man\" is identified by facial hair, bald head or short hair, square chin and thick eyebrows. I prefer to use the \"Person\" emoji to identify myself because it's somewhere in the middle. Person has slightly longer hair than Man, but shorter than Woman. (Also comes in curly version and gray hair: üßëüèªü¶± üßìüèª) Person also has less heavy eyebrows. And Person happens to be wearing my favorite color in most iterations. ‚ÜùWomen don't all look like this: üë©üèªü¶∞üë©üèªüë©üèæüë©üèæü¶≥ ‚ÜùMen don't all look like this: üßîüèΩ‚ôÇÔ∏èüë±üèΩ‚ôÇÔ∏èüë®üèªü¶≤üë¥üèæ ‚ÜùNonbinary people might look like Man, Woman, or Person emojis.
