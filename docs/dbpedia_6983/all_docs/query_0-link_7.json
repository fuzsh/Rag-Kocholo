        "text": "My mind is blown right now, and I need to share what I’m learning.\n\nPurple doesn’t exist?\n\n2. Some regions of English speakers see violet and purple differently, and some don’t?\n\n3. The reason I struggle to find the “right” purple for my colouring might be that I like violet but not purple?\n\nFriends, let’s figure this out! Starting with the basics: What is violet, and what is purple?\n\nPurple only exists in our brains.\n\nScience buffs probably already know this, but I didn’t (and please correct anything I get wrong – I’m paraphrasing to consolidate my learning). The human eye can see a range of colours between ultraviolet and infrared. We see violet when light comes into our eyes and triggers blue with a hint of red.\n\nOn the flip side, purple doesn’t exist anywhere along the light spectrum, so it isn’t a “spectral” colour. Purple is a colour our brains create when an equal mix of blue and red light hit our eyes. Same goes for magenta – it isn’t a spectral colour, it is a mix that our brain perceives with a mix of light at the two ends of the visible spectrum.\n\nIf my explanation doesn’t make sense, please check out the video about and this article, which is the course of all the above images.\n\n2. Some regions of English speakers see violet and purple differently, and some don’t?\n\nIn Canada, I almost never hear the word violet use to describe colours. In fact, I recently dyed my hair “ultraviolet” for a month, and kept wondering what it was called violet (a synonym purple in my brain) when it really came out as periwinkle blue when made pastel? Well duh, Gillian, turns out the name was correct. Violet is mostly blue with a hint of red.\n\nAccording to several articles I’ve read, British people distinguish between violet and purple more than North Americans, who call everything purple. Friends, is this true?\n\n3. The reason I struggle to find the “right” purple for my colouring might be that I like violet but not purple?\n\nRemember that violet hair dye? Looked fabulous. As soon as I started adding pink to transition towards rose gold, the purple hair made me look bad. Pinky purple hair brings out my undereye circles and the redness in my skin. The same goes for clothing – I tried to add lilac to my colour palette this year and some things looked good and some looked awful. Just today I said to my friend Samantha @couturious that I avoid buying purple fabric because I’m never quite sure if it will look good or not.\n\nBut guess what? The violet colour palette contains every shade of purple I’ve ever loved on myself. Turns out I like violet but not purple!?!\n\nWhat is truly shocking to me is that I’ve been fascinated by colour for so long but didn’t have the words to perceive a specific category. It is exactly the way I understand my gender: for most of my life I didn’t have the term non-binary, so I saw myself as a woman. When non-binary became a category I understood, it fit me much more perfectly than woman ever did. Will the same be true with violet and purple? Can I train my eye to distinguish the two, and finally predict what shades will look good on me?"
