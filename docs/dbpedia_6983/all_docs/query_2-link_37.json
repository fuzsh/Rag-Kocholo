Are you ready to brighten your day with Korean colors? Let’s continue!\n\nHere is a free PDF guide that you can download to help you learn Korean colors:\n\nList of All Colors in Korean\n\nBelow is a list of all colors in Korean. The list contains various shades of Korean color words. Audios are included for each word to help improve your Korean pronunciation too.\n\nThis lesson about colors will explain the words and phrases using both Hangeul (Korean Alphabet) and romanized Korean. If you don’t know Hangeul, you can get a free guide here and learn to read in less than 1 hour. The lesson will help you with learning Korean words easily.\n\nWords related to colors are great Korean words to know and incorporate into your plan for learning Korean. To learn Korean vocabulary, go here.\n\nHow to Pronounce the Color Words in Korean\n\nHere is how to pronounce the colors in Korean using Hangeul. The Hangeul in brackets is the way to pronounce the colors.\n\nThe Korean pronunciation of the colors can be different from how they are spelled because of the special Korean pronunciation rules. Knowing these rules will make learning Korean easier.\n\nHow to Say “Color” in Korean\n\nThe word for “color” in Korean is 색깔 (saekkkal).\n\n색깔 (saekkkal)\n\ncolor\n\nYou can often get by just by referring to color as 색 (saek), but it slightly depends on the context.\n\n색 (saek)\n\ncolor\n\nIf you look up the word “color” in the dictionary, you may also come across the Konglish word 컬러 (kheolleo | color). You’ll be understood if you use this word, but our advice would be to use 색 (saek) instead. The word “color” also occasionally translates to 빛깔 (bitkkal) in Korean.\n\nYou’ve now learned that the word for “color” in Korean is 색 (saek). When naming colors in their basic form, you’ll add the word 색 (saek) after the color words. It’s important to know 색 (saek), so you can use it with Korean colors.\n\nSample sentences:\n\n제일 좋아하는 색은 뭐예요? (jeil johahaneun saekeun mwoyeyo?)\n\nWhat’s your favorite color?\n\n다음에 내 머리를 무슨 색깔로 염색할까? (daeume nae meorireul museun saekkkallo yeomsaekhalkka?)\n\nWhich color should I dye my hair next?\n\nHow to Use Colors in Korean\n\nMost often, in learning a new language, colors are usually one of the first ones you’ll learn about. In addition to the different colors in Korean, we’re going to cover some examples and special uses that you’ll definitely want to know about. These situations appear in Korean language, culture, music, and everyday life all the time.\n\nYou can use colors in Korean above in their noun form or as adjective form. These are helpful when describing everything you see daily, from a house to a purple dress or a book, or perhaps even the Korean flag!\n\nSample Sentence:\n\n빨간색 자전거 좋아해요 (ppalgansaek jajeongeo joahaeyo)\n\nI like red bicycles.\n\nAlthough the word for red in Korean above is a noun, it acts as an adjective to describe the color of bicycles.\n\nThis is how you’ll commonly see colors in Korean used and is the best way to start learning the Korean language in general. It’s basic and gives you lots of ways to use various colors.\n\nNow that you know how to say the word “color” in Korean let’s now learn how to say specific colors in Korean.\n\n“White” in Korean\n\nThe two common ways how to say “white” in Korean are 하얀색 (hyayansaek) and 흰색 (huinsaek). You can use them interchangeably. If you want to describe something as white in Korean, you can put those words before a noun.\n\nFor example:\n\n햐얀색 말 (hyayansaek mal)\n\na white horse\n\n흰색 말 (huinsaek mal)\n\na white horse\n\n오늘 내 하얀 드레스를 입을 거예요. (oneul nae hayan deureseureul ibeulgeoeyo)\n\nI will wear my white dress today.\n\n“Black” in Korean\n\nThere are a few different ways how to say “black” in Korean. You can use 검정색 (geomjeongsaek), 검은색 (geomeunsaek), or 까만색 (kkamansaek). They all mean the color black so that you can use any of them.\n\nTo describe something as black in Korean, you can use any of those three words in front of a noun.\n\nFor example, you could say the following to talk about a car:\n\n검정색 자동차 (geomjeongsaek jadongcha)\n\na black car\n\n검은색 자동차 (geomeunsaek jadongcha)\n\na black car\n\n까만색 자동차 (kkamansaek jadongcha)\n\na black car\n\n그녀는 검정색 옷만 입어요. (geunyeoneun geomjeongsaek otman ibeoyo.)\n\nThat girl only wears black clothes.\n\n“Blue” in Korean\n\nThe two most common ways of saying the color blue in Korean are 파란색 (paransaek) and 푸른색 (pureunsaek).\n\n“Sky blue” in Korean is 하늘색 (haneulsaek).\n\nFor example:\n\n파란색 하늘 (paransaek haneul)\n\na blue sky\n\n푸른색 하늘 (pureunsaek haneul)\n\na blue sky\n\n하늘색 하늘 (haneulsaek haneul)\n\na sky blue sky\n\n내 새로운 자동차는 파란색이야. (nae saeroun jadongchaneun pharansaekiya.)\n\nMy new car is blue.\n\n“Red” in Korean\n\nThe common way to say “red” in Korean is 빨간색 (ppalgansaek).\n\nFor example:\n\n빨간색 좋아해요 (ppalgansaek joahaeyo)\n\nI like the color red.\n\n“Yellow” in Korean\n\nYou can say “yellow” in Korean as 노란색 (noransaek). The color yellow can be associated with a sunflower.\n\nFor example:\n\n제가 제일 좋아하는 색은 노란색이에요. (jega jeil joahaneun saegeun noransaegieyo)\n\nMy favorite color is yellow.\n\n“Purple” in Korean\n\n“Purple” in Korean is 보라색 (borasaek).\n\nFor example:\n\n그 보라색 가방이 제꺼예요. (geu borasaek gabangi jekkeoeyo)\n\nThat purple bag is mine.\n\n“Green” in Korean\n\nThe Korean word for “green,” 초록색 (choroksaek), is used more often. But if you’re referring to “light green,” you can say it as 연두색 (yeondusaek).\n\n“Orange” in Korean\n\n“Orange” in Korean is 주황색 (juhwangsaek). This term is for the color orange, but there’s a different term for the orange fruit.\n\n“Pink” in Korean\n\nThe word for “pink” in Korean is 분홍색 (bunhongsaek). The color pink is used to describe cherry blossom trees.\n\n“Brown” in Korean\n\nThe Korean word for “brown,” 갈색 (galsaek), is the commonly used term. However, the translation for “dark brown” in Korean is 밤색 (bamsaek).\n\n“Gray” in Korean\n\nThe word for “gray” in Korean is 회색 (hoesaek). This is one of the neutral colors that you can find anywhere.\n\n“Rainbow” in Korean\n\nSince we’re talking about colors, the rainbow in Korean is called 무지개 (mujigae).\n\n“Silver” in Korean\n\nThis is not your common color, but you can say “silver” in Korean as 은색 (eunsaek).\n\n“Gold” in Korean\n\nThis is often associated with jewelry and treasures. You can say “gold” in Korean as 금색 (geumsaek).\n\n“Light” in Korean\n\nWhen we talk about “light colors” in Korean, you can say it as 밝은 색 (balgeun saek).\n\n“Dark” in Korean\n\nOpposite to light colors, “dark color” in Korean is 어두운 색 (eoduun saek).\n\nYou may want to use the example sentences using Korean colors along with common Korean phrases. The sentences will help you in learning Korean since you will learn other parts of Korean grammar, such as Korean particles and markers.\n\nCan't read Korean yet?

We’re going to cover them below.\n\nBefore we get into that, remember that you can still use the Korean colors above. That’s the simplest, best way to start and what we recommend. The next part is helpful because you’ll see these other words for the colors, so it’s better to know why they appear in that form.\n\nAlso, it’ll give you some additional ways to use the colors in Korean.\n\nThe five Korean words for colors below are descriptive verbs (adjectives) that have base forms. Here are the base forms and the adjective form when it’s placed in front of a noun.\n\nShown below are the ways to say red in Korean with its different uses. As you may know from Korean grammar and conjugation rules, adjectives can come before a noun or at the end of a sentence.\n\nSample Sentences:\n\n1. 빨간 자전거 좋아해요 (ppalgan jajeongeo joahaeyo)\n\nI like red bicycles\n\n2. 자전거 빨개요 (jajeongeo ppalgaeyo)\n\nThe bicycle is red\n\n3. 자전거 빨간색이에요 (jajeongeo ppalgansaegieyo)\n\nThe bicycle is red\n\nIn the first example, we’re using the descriptive verb (adjective) 빨갛다 (ppalgata | red) in front of the noun that it is modifying (the bicycle).\n\nIn the second example, the 빨갛다 (ppalgata | red) is conjugated as the sentence’s main descriptive verb (adjective). It describes the bicycle’s color.\n\nIn the third example, we’re using 빨갛다 (ppalgata | red) in its noun form, along with the verb 이다 (ida | to be).\n\nKorean Color Adjectives vs. Nouns\n\nHere’s another concept to help you improve your Korean grammar. Most of the words for the colors in Korean aren’t going to have the descriptive verb (adjective) base form. Instead, you’ll just use noun + 색 (saek). Let’s take the color word 초록색 (choroksaek) for “green.” Since you won’t be using it as the main conjugated descriptive verb of the sentence, you’ll only use it for cases 1 and 3 above.\n\nFor example:\n\n초록색 자전거 좋아해요 (choroksaekjajeongeo joahaeyo)\n\nI like green bicycles\n\n자전거 초록색이에요 (jajeongeo choroksaegieyo)\n\nThe bicycle is green\n\nIn other words, the Korean word for “red” changes based on how it’s used. In this language, these words exist in their basic adjective verb form:- ㅎ다. In use, -ㅎ다 (-ㅎ da) is replaced by -ㄴ. The color words that continue to use 색 (saek) do not have such a form.\n\nIf you want to describe things with a specific color, you can attach 색 (saek) with the 이다 (ida) verb. To illustrate clearly how the words for colors work in sentences, check out some examples below.\n\nWrap Up\n\nWe hope we pleasantly surprised you with this lesson and you learned many new things about Korean colors! Now it’s time to try your newfound skills in colors to help you learn Korean."
