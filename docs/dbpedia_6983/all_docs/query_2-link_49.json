However, if you’re not super familiar with these, with some practice you’ll have them down pat.\n\nYou can speed up that process by exposing yourself to lots of native Spanish content, so you can hear how native speakers talk about colors. You can find native content on YouTube, or a language learning program like FluentU.\n\nPay attention to word order\n\nLike most Spanish adjectives, the color words go after the noun they describe.\n\nFor example:\n\nEl coche azul. (The blue car. Literally, “the car blue.”)\n\nWatch out for number and gender\n\nWhen using the color words as adjectives, you must make the colors agree with the number and gender of the noun.\n\nFor example, el sofá (the sofa) is a singular, masculine noun. Las actrices (the actresses) is a plural, feminine noun.\n\nAs with all Spanish adjectives, you must ensure that the color words agree with the noun they describe.\n\nLos ojos azules. (The blue eyes.)\n\nLas casas blancas. (The white houses.)\n\nA color that doesn’t end in o won’t change its spelling\n\nGender change rules don’t always apply, as any color that doesn’t end in an o won’t change its spelling.\n\nFor example: verde (green), azul (blue) and rosa (pink).\n\nYou usually use ser with colors\n\nWhen describing what color something is, such as in a sentence like “The phone is black,” you almost always use the verb ser.\n\nEl teléfono es negro. (The phone is black.)\n\nLas botellas son amarillas. (The bottles are yellow.)\n\nThe verb estar (to be) generally refers to temporary states of being. There are rare cases in which you might need to use estar to describe the color of something.\n\nHere’s an example: If you wanted to say that today the sky is gray because of an impending rainstorm, you could use the verb estar (since it’s normally blue):\n\nEl cielo está gris. (The sky is gray.)\n\nUse “de color” to simplify things\n\nAnother way to describe color in Spanish is to say that something is de color… (the color…).\n\nWith this construction, you’ll always use the masculine, singular version of the color—regardless of the noun!\n\nLas camisetas son de color rosa. (The shirts are the color pink.)\n\nColors don’t change gender in the noun + color + adjective/noun formula\n\nWhen you combine noun + color + adjective/noun, the color and adjective/noun don’t change genders.\n\nThis means that no matter what gender or number the main noun is, the color and the adjective/noun will remain in the masculine singular form.\n\nFor example:\n\nEl libro azul oscuro. (The dark blue book.)\n\nLa camisa azul oscuro. (The dark blue shirt.)\n\nLos libros azul oscuro. (The dark blue books.)\n\nLas camisas azul oscuro. (The dark blue shirts.)\n\nColors can be nouns\n\nColors can also act as nouns, not just adjectives.\n\nWhen a color functions as a noun, it will always be masculine, no matter what.\n\nEl rosa es mi color favorito. (Pink is my favorite color.)\n\nLos naranjas te quedan muy bien. (Orange colors suits you very well.)\n\nColors in Spanish Practice Quiz\n\nNow that you know the most important colors in Spanish, it’s time to practice them! By practicing the colors, you’ll be able to start using them in your own Spanish conversations to add extra information.\n\n1. Me gustan tus zapatos (___). (I like your red shoes.)\n\n2. No encuentro mi falda (___). (I can’t find my black skirt.)\n\n3. El (___) es mi color favorito. (Yellow is my favorite color.)\n\n4. Tengo los ojos (___). (I have green eyes.)\n\n5. El (___) es un color cálido. (Orange is a warm color.)\n\n6. Mi abrigo es de color (___). (My coat is pink.)\n\n7. No puedo quitar una mancha de mi camisa (___). (I can’t remove a stain on my white shirt.)\n\n8. Mi amiga tiene un coche (___). (My friend has a light blue car.)\n\n9. Hay tantas casas (___) en México. ¡Son espectaculares! (There are so many colorful houses in Mexico. They are spectacular!)\n\n10. Parece que va a llover pronto. El cielo está (___). (It looks like it’s going to rain soon. The sky is gray.)\n\nAnswers:\n\n1. Rojos\n\n2. Negra\n\n3. Amarillo\n\n4. Verdes\n\n5. Anaranjado/naranja\n\n6. Rosado/Rosa\n\n7. Blanca\n\n8. Azul claro\n\n9. Coloridas\n\n10. Gris\n\nThe Spanish colors are simple to learn and use once you get the hang of a few rules.\n\nAnd they improve your ability to express yourself in Spanish, whether it be in a supermarket or in a poetry workshop.\n\nSo, go forth and add color to your Spanish!"
