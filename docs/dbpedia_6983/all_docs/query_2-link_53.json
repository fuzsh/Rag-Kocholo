Carrots are orange. What is black?\n\nTodd: Sometimes dirt is black. The night sky is black.\n\nMeg: Right. And your shirt is black.\n\nTodd: Yes. I like my black shirt.\n\nMeg: What is white?\n\nTodd: Vanilla Ice Cream is white. The snow is white.\n\nMeg: Yes. And clouds are white.\n\nTodd: Clouds are white.

What about you?\n\nTodd: I don't like pink shirts. I don't like pink, actually.\n\nMeg: Oh, that's too bad.\n\nTodd: What is your favorite color?\n\nMeg: My favorite color is orange.\n\nTodd: Really?

I love green, I love blue, I love purple.\n\nMeg: You like the cool colors.\n\nTodd: Right. I don't like orange, I don't like yellow, and I don't like pink.\n\nMeg: You don't like the warm colors.\n\nTodd: Yes. Bright colors, not so much.\n\nMeg: I see.\n\nTodd: What about red? Do you like red?\n\nMeg: I don't especially like red. I like red poppies, a type of flower.\n\nTodd: All right, yeah.\n\nMeg: But I don't like to wear red.\n\nTodd: Yeah, me too. Do you dislike any colors?\n\nMeg: Actually, I don't like brown. I think it's a boring color.\n\nTodd: Yeah, that's true. But often dogs are brown and I love dogs."
