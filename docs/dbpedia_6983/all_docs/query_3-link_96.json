        "text": "Anyone who like me loves the colour purple and involved in anything like the SCA has probably at one time or another been told, “but purple isn’t period. ” or the old classic, “only royalty were allowed to wear purple.”\n\nWell being the avid purple lover that I am, I decided to look more into these claims, also because I am working on a piece now that is lined in purple and I just know I am going to get the comments.\n\nSo what exactly is purple?\n\nwhen we are kids, we’re taught blue and red make purple. OK but how much blue and how much red, changes in the ratio make different hues, but are all called purple?\n\nSo firstly I looked up the definition of purple:\n\nOK so no surprises in that, except I didn’t know there were butterflies called Purple, must look into those later.\n\nIt is interesting that the definition even mentions rank in regards to the colour.\n\nNext stop was John Florios ” A world of Wordes” .\n\nThis is an Italian dictionary of 1598.\n\non page 326 the entries are as follows:\n\npupura the purple colour, a princes or chiefmans colour,or the dignitie of a chief or magistrate. Also a purple fish, which is a shell fish, wherof the purple colour cometh.\n\npurpurato, purpled, apparelled in purple, of, or, belonging to purple or purple colour, also belonging to the place where fishes kill or take the purple fish. Also clothed in garments of purple. Also a nobleman, a peer or the realme.\n\npurpureo, of the colour of purple, like purple, red, bluish, avaid in purple.\n\npurpurillo, red painting wherewith some women do use to paint their faces, a lively ruddie colour called cheeke-varnish. also like purple, or of the colour purple.\n\npurpurino, as purpunio. Also a lively redde colour women use for painting, called cheeke-varnish.\n\npurpurite, a kinde of marble in Egypt, ruddie and full of white spots.\n\nSo we now know that the word purple was used pre 1600 but that doesn’t get us any closer to what is period purple?\n\nOff I go to look for an exact definition of what hue is purple.\n\nOH my goodness, what a rabbit hole that turned out to be!\n\nSo after trawling through many pages of colour theory, auras (yeah got side tracked there) RGB and pantone colours, I have come to the conclusion that purple is not a particular colour. There are amethyst, eggplant, violet, pansy, lavendar, orchid, and numerous other shades and tones with as many names to match.\n\nSo where to now on my journey on the purple road.\n\nI know the term purple was used pre 1600 but perhaps what pigment what it referring to. Well in Florio, it mentions pupurite as a purple marble found in Egypt, I believe we now call this porphry. I was lucky enough to see this beautiful stone in person when I travelled to Italy,. There are many examples of it in the Vatican Museum. It is a very beautiful red purple colour.\n\nAlso Florio talks about the dye made from shellfish.\n\nTyrian purple, Phoenician purple, Tyrian red, royal purple, imperial purple or imperial dye is a reddish purple natural dye made from shellfish. It is a secretion produced by several species of predatory rock snails originally known by the name Murex. In ancient times, extracting this dye involved tens of thousands of snails and substantial labour, and as a result, the dye was highly valued.\n\nBelow is Byzantine Emperor Justinian I clad in Tyrian purple, 6th-century mosaic at Basilica San Vitals, Ravenna, Italy.\n\nAlthough this is getting closer this still isn’t substantiating what I call purple, it seems to be a different shade completely.\n\nBefore I go on further I guess I should share with you the colour I am chasing after. I have been a lifelong lover of the colour purple but to me this is the colour of an eggplants skin, or a Cadbury chocolate wrapper, The colour worn by Prince on his famous Purple Rain album cover. It’s lush dark deep colour.\n\nAfter delving into all this research I am leaning towards the idea that the colour that I know and love was actually called something completely different pre 1600.\n\nSo maybe I thought I would go on to check out those purple butterflies I found mentioned in the definition of purple.\n\nnope, wrong track entirely.\n\nSorry but they really do not look purple at all to me\n\nSo back to my research.\n\nI decided to look for examples of clothing in purple in the period that I love, 1560 to 1580s Italy, mostly Florence and Venice, but pretty much anywhere on the boot will do.\n\nOn my ever growing pinterest boards I have categorised art work into colours. I looked into my purple folder and sadly there are only three in there!\n\nBoth these gowns are from The Milanese Tailor’s Handbook, written in the 1570s, and held at the Querini-Stampalia Library in Venice. It was published in A Tailor’s Book, or Il Lidro del Sarto by Alessandra Molfino, a number of years ago but is now a rare book and hard o find copies, however I am one of the lucky ones to one a copy of the book which I tracked down a few years back.\n\nThe reddish purple sleeves on plate 92\n\nPlate 96, a purple gown over a fascinating black and gold chevrony underdress\n\nAlso another pair of purple sleeves on plate100\n\nIn the book Lorenzo De’ Medici at Home: The Inventory of the Palazzo Medici in 1492, the inventory of the household goods names many purple items.\n\nCloser and definite proof that purple was worn in period by ladies and men. Sadly not my purple\n\nBack to the theories then.\n\nI went looking into pigments and dying. I found this page called Renaissance Colour Palette.\n\nScrolling down to the purple section it states,\n\nI have looked at so many purples throughout this journey of discovery, and I think the answer to my question of whether purple is period and if it were only for the upper classes, is yes. Yes there was a colour called purple, is it the same to what we call purple now? Most probably not in the Prince Purple Rain colour scheme, but it does still fall on our modern pallete of purple, possibly called a mulberry or something similiar. Was it believed to be for the upper nobility, in the references I have found yes it was, but that is because the colour was difficult to achieve in the dying process and therefore made fabrics these colours expensive. The modern purple was more than likely available, again quite expensive being that it could only be achieved with imported dye products, madder and indigo, and was more into the violet range in terminology.\n\nA couple of last portraits to consider, blue or purple? or violet?\n\nTitian’s Portrait of Laura Dianti\n\nAllessandro Allori’s Portrait of a Lady\n\nI think this will continue to be an ongoing quest for me, to gather as many period examples of purple as I can, just for fun you know. 🙂"
