        "text": "Salvēte omnēs! We're providing easy Latin lessons here on Wikiversity. If you would like to review, you can find past lessons in the directory, a classified vocabulary list, and Memrise courses on the right.\n\nWe'll work on learning the Latin names for colors this week; soon we will add vocabulary for clothing and we'll be well prepared to describe it! Color names are adjectives; to review the two basic types of Latin adjectives see Adjectives lesson 1 and Adjectives lesson 2. The other thing you should be aware of is that there is a wide range of variation in color terminology usage in Latin; a good explanation of this is available here. You can also take a look at this post for a huge variety of Latin color names, but it is information overload compared to the basic colors we'll be sharing today.\n\nLatin English Audio (Classical) Notes General vocabulary capillus, i hair (sometimes used in plural) color, colōris (m.) color\n\nColours Latin English Audio (Classical) Notes āter, ātra, ātrum black (like a coal, not glossy); dark, gloomy niger, nigra, nigrum black (glossy); dark albus, a, um white (dead white, not shining) candidus, a, um white (shining, dazzling) ruber, rubra, rubrum red rūfus, a, um ruddy, red-haired aurantius, a, um orange Not often used in classical Latin aureus, a, um golden, gold flāvus, a, um yellow, blond/e-haired lūteus, a, um yellow used less frequently viridis, e green This is a 3rd declension adjective: all other color names in this lesson are 1st/2nd declension caeruleus, a, um blue purpureus, a, um purple roseus, a, um pink, rose fuscus, a, um brown cānus, a, um gray, gray-haired\n\nLatin English Notes Magistra in tabulā atrā scrībit.

For instance, words like obfuscate, rubric, albatross; some common Roman names were color-based, such as Rūfus and Flāvius. And of course, Harry Potter has such names as Rubeus Hagrid and Albus Dumbledore."
