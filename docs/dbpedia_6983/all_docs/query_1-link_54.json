Purple shampoo is your go-to product for maintaining that fresh-from-the-salon look. Let's explore how purple shampoo works and why it's a staple in hair care.\n\nWhat is Purple Shampoo?\n\nPurple shampoo contains violet pigments that neutralize yellow and orange tones in blonde and grey hair.

For more noticeable orange tones, up to 5 minutes.\n\nRinse Thoroughly: Ensure all shampoo is rinsed out to avoid a purple tint.\n\nRepeat If Necessary: Use once a week or adjust based on your hair’s response.\n\nDo’s and Don’ts\n\nDo use it regularly, but don't overdo it to avoid overtone.\n\nDon’t substitute it for your regular shampoo; it's a treatment, not a cleanser.\n\nPairing with Other Hair Care Products\n\nFor optimal results, follow up with GK Hair’s Moisturizing Conditioner to hydrate and soften your hair.
