The scale is black/zero to white/100.\n\nRed Green Blue\n\nThese Red, Green and Blue colour codes are used in digital representation of colour. These three sets of codes create wide representation of colours on the screen. Although it is critical to see the paint colour in person, the digital representation gives the idea when we research colours at home.\n\nHexadecimal Numbers\n\nThis colour code is a hexadecimal way to represent RGB values, often used for building a website to represent colours digitally. Itâ€™s a secondary colour code that allows us to experience colorus in digital format."
