        "text": "It is advantageous to understand color psychology so you can be aware of the effect tones can have on you and others. To know how to dress appropriately using your personal color harmonies it is important to choose the right combinations. Hypnologists use specific colors to get in touch with the subconscious. Image consultants use color to help their clients look healthier, younger and more vibrant and to project the message they want.\n\nToday, we are going to talk about the meaning of the mysterious and mystical color purple.\n\nEssential Meaning\n\nColors are formed by combining variations of the rainbow colors, and this one (purple), consisting of a combination of red and blue, is especially eye-catching. Red in psychology is life, energy and emotions. Blue is calm and peace. This combination of contrasting colors is said to manifest itself in the struggle of opposites in the inner world of a person who prefers this color.\n\nIn fact, one of the primary meanings of purple is that it seems to hide strong passions and sensuality. Shades of purple have different meanings, dark tones, for example, are a manifestation of power and urgency. The dominance of red hues in this color can speak to the immaturity of feelings and mood swings. Lighter shades reflect tenderness, sensitivity, and romance.\n\nExemplifying Nature\n\nIn nature, the color purple can be observed in berries, fruit and vegetables such as plums, currants, and eggplants. Flowers such as violets, lilacs, phloxes, lupines, chicories, and polka peas can be seen in all shades of the color. Lilac is associated with spring: warm and romantic evenings filled with aromas. Purple also seems to elicit our poetic memories such as violet eyes, distant lilac vistas, and sunsets.\n\nWhat Purple Symbolizes?\n\nWhat a delight a rainbow gives us after the rain! Violet is an integral part of the light spectrum and in bioenergy, this symbolizes the highest frequencies and the invisible connection with the cosmos. Since ancient times, it has been considered the color of magicians and wizards. It was also worn by members of royal families. Considered a sign of nobility, ordinary people were prohibited from using it as part of their clothing ensemble.\n\nHere are some other aspects that the color purple symbolizes:\n\nIt can help someone enter a meditative state, often used in spiritual and magical practices.\n\nIt promotes creativity and inspires reflection as well as mental stimulation.\n\nIn some cultures, it is a symbol of mourning.\n\nThe frequent appearance of it in a dream can lead to major life changes.\n\nThis contributes to the balance of opposing energies.\n\nThe Effect\n\nThe effect of purple on the human psyche provides significant benefits to the user or receiver. The calming effect on the autonomic nervous system helps reduce anxiety, slows down the heart rate and regulates breathing. Blood pressure is normalized and the intensity of panic attacks is reduced.\n\nThis color helps a person open their subconscious or inner world more easily. Strengthening and expanding awareness, it has a positive effect on memory and attention and helps people notice specific details. It stimulates mental activity by helping them make the right decisions.\n\nThe Characteristics\n\nThe characteristics of purple have been evaluated amongst many other colors in various studies, such as the “Systematic Investigation of Conceptual Color Associations” published in a recent issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology.\n\nMany of these characteristics have been examined and expanded upon by the psychotherapist and bestselling author Amy Morin, LCSW. If you want to create mystery and learn how to dress for success, then fill your wardrobe with purple items. A person who wears purple is seen to be:\n\nIntelligent and sensitive\n\nCreative\n\nIntuitive\n\nDetermined\n\nGoal oriented\n\nEmpathetic\n\nWomen\n\nSome have reported that women who prefer violet are very emotional, despite an apparent calm exterior. They also panic easily and just as quickly reach a state of euphoria. They aspire to harmony and peace and need protection and support. Men attract and admire these characteristics in women, finding them interesting. These women are constantly in spiritual development.\n\nMen\n\nOthers report that a man who loves purple can be aesthetic but also gives the impression of being vain or arrogant, not able to adapt to the realities of life. For this reason, they seek to express their spirituality with various spiritual practices. Another quality that distinguishes a man who chooses this color is a love of freedom and independence. They live by their own rules.\n\nIn Summary\n\nPeople who love purple are special and are aware of the psychology of color. They know how to detect the moods of other people and the world around them. They can maintain these qualities in balance to generate the subtle perception of the world so they can continue to dress for success and improve their image. If you are still on the fence about the colors that would be ideal to bring out the best in you, consult an image consultant.\n\nWhat Do Other Colors Mean?\n\nWhile purple is the primary of focus here, there are other colors with their own meaning.
