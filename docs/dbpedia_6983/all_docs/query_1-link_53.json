        "text": "Japanese words for colors are predominantly no-adjectives, in contrast other basic adjectives, which are primarily i-adjectives and na-adjectives. As we go through the Japanese color words, there are also a couple of important points we can cover regarding their use.\n\nRecommended Background:\n\nJapanese Adjectives\n\nLanguage and Color\n\nIf you ask several people what they would call a particular color, you’re likely to get a variety of responses. This is because words for colors are inherently arbitrary, since there are an unlimited number of ways to break up spectrum of red to violet, not to mention differences in brightness and saturation.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that languages also vary in how they name colors, even very basic colors. As it turns out, the basic colors in Japanese are very similar to those in English, but there is one major difference in the blue-green area of the spectrum.\n\nPrimary Colors\n\nThe primary colors in Japanese are all i-adjectives, which agrees with the idea that i-adjectives tend to represent more basic concepts than na-adjectives.\n\nHiragana Romaji English あかい akai red あおい aoi blue/green きいろい kiiroi yellow しろい shiroi white くろい kuroi black\n\nThe word for “color” is いろ (iro), which you can see embedded in kiiroi (yellow).\n\nActually, even kiiroi could be considered less basic than the other four, since it requires the kanji for “yellow color” (黄色い） rather than just one kanji (赤い、青い、白い、黒い）. We’ll discuss aoi (blue/green) more in a moment.\n\nAs with any i-adjective, you simply place the word in front of the noun being colored.\n\nHiragana Romaji English あかいくるま akai kuruma a red car きいろいほん kiiroi hon a yellow book しろいマグ shiroi magu a white mug くろいペン kuroi pen a black pen\n\nHowever, when you want to say that something is some color (the predicate function), you must use the no-adjective (noun) equivalent of the word.\n\nHiragana Romaji English あか aka red あお ao blue/green きいろ kiiro yelow しろ shiro white くろ kuro black\n\nThus we have akai booru (a red ball), but:\n\nKana Romaji English ボールは あかです。 Booru wa aka desu. The ball is red.\n\nOther color words are normal no-adjectives, so these five are really the exception rather than the rule. Fortunately, the rule itself is without exception: when using primary colors to modify a noun, use the i-adjective form; otherwise, use the no-adjective form.\n\nYou would also use aka to refer to “the color red”, which is similar to how color words in English are used as both nouns and adjectives.\n\nFinally, the noun forms are also used in some compound words.\n\nKana Romaji English あかワイン akawain red wine くろねこ kuroneko a black cat\n\nHowever, due to the influence of Kanji, compound words including colors generally use the on-yomi (Chinese reading) of the character rather than the independent words.\n\nBlue and Green\n\nAlthough it seems strange to westerners, ao (or aoi) can mean either “blue” or “green” in Japanese. Actually, it refers to this entire spectrum, and our blue, teal, and green would all be considered shades of ao.\n\nSo occasionally in places where English speakers would use “green”, Japanese people would instead use ao.\n\nKana Romaji English くさは あおです。 Kusa wa ao desu. The grass is green. あおしんごう aoshingo green light (traffic signal)\n\nFun fact: Japanese traffic lights are indeed somewhat bluish compared to those in North America.\n\nJapanese people also consider the ocean to be ao, which makes sense considering that seawater is just as green up close as it is blue from a distance.\n\nOther Basic Colors\n\nThe remaining colors are all no-adjectives (nouns) and have no further complications. Here are the ones you will want to memorize.\n\nKana Romaji English Notes こん kon dark blue a shade of ao (blue/green) みずいろ mizuiro light blue literally “water color”, a shade of ao みどり midori green same as in the English sense – bright green and dark green, a shade of ao むらさき murasaki violet/purple there is no distinction between “violet” and “purple” in Japanese (some English speakers also make no distinction) オレンジ（オレンジいろ） orenji (orenjiiro) orange a borrowed word, a similar color is daidaiiro (dark orange) ピンク pinku pink a borrowed word, a similar color is momoiro “peach color” ちゃいろ chairo brown literally “tea color” はいいろ haiiro grey literally “ash color”, another word is nezumiiro “mouse color” きんいろ kin’iro gold kin is the metal “gold” ぎんいろ gin’iro silver gin is the metal “silver”\n\nAgain, the iro found in many of these words is the root word for “color”.\n\nAll of these words require the particle no to be used as modifiers, and use the copula to predicate a sentence.\n\nKana Romaji English みどりのかばん midori no kaban a green bag かえるは みどりです。 Kaeru wa midori desu. Frogs are green.\n\nTo ask “what color” something is, you can use the question word nani-iro.\n\nKana Romaji English なにいろですか。 Nani-iro desu ka? What color is it? オレンジです。 Orenji desu. It’s orange.\n\nAnd that’s all there is to it.\n\nWhat Next?"
