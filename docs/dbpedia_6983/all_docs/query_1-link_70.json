(Seido Hakama are fitted to be worn with a common Judo type belt.)\n\nHigh Koshiita (Iaido style): The Koshiita is higher than the front strap, to be worn with a Kakuobi/large Iai type belt.\n\nLow Koshiita: The base of the Koshiita is about 3 cm lower than the front strap (which is done by moving the front strap slightly up). This allows to fold the front belt into the \"Judo type belt\" without getting a crumpled Hakama when tied.\n\nAdjusting the height of the Koshiita according to your belt/style of wearing, helps that the pleats fall nicely and flat.\n\nAdd this service\n\n¥700\n\nThis combination is unavailable.

The ropes and port on the back are thick and comfortable. For optimal quality, Seido logo, Aikido calligraphy, \"Ki\" calligraphy and all other designs are not printed but embroidered. Made 100% from japanese made unbleached sashiko cotton, this product is eco friendly.\n\nThis product is a Seido original product designed by our team.\n\nHere are all the designs we offer and their meaning:\n\nThe Seido embroidery is based on the Seido label attached to all Seido equipments.\n\nThe Aikido embroidery is based on a calligraphy found in the main dojo of Aikikai Hombu Dojo. It was created by Morihei Ueshiba O-Sensei when he was 80 years old, a period in his life when his calligraphy reached its peak. Note that the depth and extension of ideograms are a sign of an open mind.\n\nThe \"Ki' embroidery is based on the same calligraphy as the \"Aikido embroidery\" but only contains the second kanji \"Ki\".\n\nJudo - Gyoshotai (cursive font)\n\nKaratedo - Gyoshotai (cursive font)\n\nKendo - Gyoshotai (cursive font)\n\nIaido - Gyoshotai (cursive font)\n\nJujutsu - Gyoshotai (cursive font)\n\nZanshin - Gyoshotai (cursive font) : Remaining mind, or lingering mind.\n\nMushin - Gyoshotai (cursive font) : No mind (mental state), or mind without mind.\n\nHeijoshin - Gyoshotai (cursive font) : Calm, imperturbable, relaxed heart/mind\n\nShingitai - Gyoshotai (cursive font) : The unification of mind, skills and body.\n\nTakemusu Aiki - Gyoshotai (cursive font) : Aikido concept, the unity of martial techniques through the concept of Aiki.\n\nOption \"Name Embroidery\":\n\nOptionally, you can add your name as embroidery. It will be embroidered on the left of the bottom part (same high as the Seido label), with a font size of 2 cm by 2 cm.\n\nPlease note that due to our technical settings and to improve the overall balance, it is only possible to embroider either a first name, a last name or a word (1 word).\n\nFor more information about Japanese embroidery, please consult the page \"How to Choose your Japanese Embroidery\".\n\nProduct Information & Size Chart\n\nProduct details\n\nHakama Size Chart & Options\n\nReviews\n\nAikido Tetron Hakama - Custom Colors\n\nMade in Japan | White, Dark Grey, Light Grey, Purple, Brown, Gold\n\nMaterial: Tetron (65% polyester / 35% rayon)\n\nShrinkage: 0% | Weight (size 26): 0.92 kg\n\nShape: Traditional Aikido cut (flexible koshiita, straps with 7 lines of stitching)\n\nOn this product page, we offer 6 custom colors.\n\nPurple is sometimes used as a substitute for Aizome Hakama, and it is not uncommon to see it on Aikido mats.\n\nGrey and light grey are colors that were used by Aikido founder Ueshiba Morihei and 2nd Doshu Ueshiba Kisshomaru. They are not widely used today, but some Dojo are still using it.\n\nWhite was used by the founder, Ueshiba Morihei, as well as by various teachers such as Noro Masamichi, or Hikitsuchi Michio. It is also a color used in various Budo such as Kendo, Jodo, etc.\n\nBrown is rarer, it is mostly seen in old Koryu schools.\n\nAnd finally, gold is very rare and mostly used for special occasions (demonstrations) and cosplay.\n\nThis model is made of a composite fabric polyester/rayon, a combination that provides our hakama with durable quality. This synthetic model is solid, comfortable, and very easy to maintain thanks to a special iron treatment that keeps pleats perfect in any place. Tetron is the fabric most commonly used in the manufacture of Japanese Hakama for Kendo, Iaido, and Aikido. The fabric that we use is slightly thicker and stronger than the fabrics used for common Kendo or Iaido models. The uncompromising quality of our tetron hakama is illustrated by the 7 rows of stitching on the straps for extra robustness. The flexible Koshiita made of durable composite rubber is safe for any kind of ukemi.\n\nEasy to fold and to maintain, this model may be hand-washed and dried on a hanger (holding the folds using clothespins) without any risk of losing the pleats or damaging the fabric. The color does not fade even though a slight color transfer may occur due to frictions.\n\nFor maximum comfort, the strap length is adjusted according to the size of the hakama.\n\nAs all our Hakama, this model is fully made in Japan (fabric, cut, and stitching).\n\nFor sizes smaller than 20, please contact us for custom orders.\n\nPlease note that this model is made to order in about 4 weeks.\n\nOption (made to order): sewing of the inside pleats\n\nThough Synthetic Hakama are quite easy to maintain, we propose to sew the inner pleats for those who want to make the folding as easy as possible. The pleats are sewn on the inside, which makes them completely invisible when worn. The result however is that the pleats are better kept, and the \"puffed out\" aspect of the hakama will be reduced.\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nBased on 2 reviews\n\nWrite a review\n\n100%\n\n(2)\n\n0%\n\n(0)\n\n0%\n\n(0)\n\n0%\n\n(0)\n\n0%\n\n(0)\n\nF\n\nFrancesco (AikiBudoKan - Firenze - Italy)\n\nMy farourite hakama\n\nAstonishing product.\n\nI choose the dark grey with wine embroidery and got exactly what I wanted. At stages it blends perfectly amongst the sea of dark blue and black hakama keeping it's style. Great colour.\n\nAs for the style it's perfectly in line with Seido's solid craftmanship tradition. I own three Seido hakama (the oldest dating almost 10 years ago) and they all look as if they just left the store.\n\nThank you once more for your excellent work.\n\nJ\n\nJim Alvarez (Aikido of Livermore-Shinrei Dojo USA)\n\nBest customer service\n\nI recently contacted Seido to ask if they could make me a grey hakama with their Semi-Heavy Weight Polyester 'Cashmere Touch' material as it was not part of their product line. I really love Seido's 'Cashmere Touch' material and was hoping to get a grey one to go with the blue one I already had. I thought that I would get a simple yes or no answer but was surprised to get a detailed email response for Jordy Delage. He said that they might have some grey Tetron material in the wharehouse from a previous time and would check. He responded that they indeed had some grey Tetron in the warehouse and that after they shipped it to him I could order one as a special order. Although it was not my desired fabric I ordered one and it arrived today. It is a very nice hakama overall. It is lighter in weight but still feels nice and comfortable. From start to finish Jordy and the Seido team have been a very good at delivering exceptional customer service and I will continue to be their loyal customer. Thank you Jordy and the Seido team!\n\nFor compliance reasons, reviews placed in French and Japanese and imported here on February 2024 do not display as 'verified'.\n\nWhen importing Japanese reviews, the impossibility to automatically determine the presence of a familly name forced us to label all Japanese reviews as 'anonymous' (Familly names in roman characters have been filtered out).\n\nSet total price::\n\nSet total price:\n\n?\n\nSelect product options to display the total price.\n\nQty\n\nAll mandatory fields must be filled.\n\nProduct & Services\n\nTetron Aikido Hakama - Custom Colors: ¥17,900\n\nHakama Embroidery - Right Hip: ¥1,100\n\nHakama Embroidery - Koshiita Outside (backplate): ¥1,300\n\nHakama Embroidery - Koshiita Inside (backplate): ¥1,300\n\nHakama Alteration - Front/Back Strap Extension: ¥300\n\nHakama Alteration - Custom Wide Cut: ¥4,600\n\nHakama Alteration - Koshiita height adjustment: ¥700\n\nHakama Alteration - Hanger strap: ¥700\n\nHakama Alteration - Longer Lateral Vents: ¥700\n\nHakama Alteration - Lateral Reinforcement: ¥800\n\nHakama Alteration - Koshiita Hera: ¥700\n\nAccessories\n\n1 x Knee Support - One size fits all: ¥2,500\n\n1 x Seido Tenugui: ¥900\n\n1 x Sashiko Bag for Dogi & Hakama: ¥6,100"
