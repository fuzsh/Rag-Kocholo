        "text": "Italian actor and director, born in Brunico en 1953.\n\nAs a teenager, Nanni Moretti had two passions: cinema and water polo. When he was twenty years old, he made two short Super 8 films that he wrote, acted in, and directed. He has never stopped acting in his own films, often sharply funny comedies, which mix intimate lines of questioning with political preoccupations. In 1976, he made his first feature film, Io sono un autarchico [I am Self Sufficient], earning him a role as a spearhead of the new Italian cinema. Then came Ecce Bombo (1986), Sogni d’oro [Sweet Dreams] (1981), which won the Special Jury Prize in Venice, and Bianca (1983). We see him again as a priest in La Messa è finita [The Mass is Ended] (1985) and as a militant communist with amnesia in Palombella rossa [Red Wood Pigeon] (1989). In 1994, Caro diario [Dear Diary] won Moretti Best Director at Cannes, and seven years later he would be back at Cannes to win the Golden Palm for The Son’s Room. After Mia Madre (2015) and Santiago Italia (2018), Three Floors and A Brighter Tomorrow are in Official Competition at Cannes 2021 and 2023."
