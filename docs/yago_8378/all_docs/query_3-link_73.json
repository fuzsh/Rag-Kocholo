I wouldn’t want to single out any particular good online festivals this year, as everyone has been dealing as best they can with adverse circumstances: but I do think my film life improved a lot when festivals big and small went online, and when I realised that many of them were available to me for the first time without travel.\n\njack sargeant\n\nAUTHOR, PROGRAMME DIRECTOR FOR THE REVELATION PERTH INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL, INDEPENDENT CURATOR, LECTURER ON FILM, MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\n2020 Top Ten\n\nThere are, of course, many other films I liked this year, but these works were the top of my list.\n\nThe Third Day: Autumn (Felix Barrett and Marc Munden, UK, 2020) 12 hours of one-take television manifested as a folk horror experimental work. I had this on for two days (in two six hour blocks), watching it like moving wallpaper, sometimes focusing intensely on the screen and at other times just being aware that it was on. The drive through the island that forms the first hour was beautifully hypnotic; the whole work was incredibly ambitious and shows the potential for the moving image.\n\nThe Other Lamb (Malgorzata Szumowska, Ireland, Belgium, USA, 2020) a more traditional narrative cinema exploration of religious themes than The Third Day, The Other Lamb follows a cult in turmoil, again there was an emphasis on the remote location and the nature of the elements which really added to this.\n\nMorgana (Josie Hess and Isabel Peppard, Australia, 2020) a very strong documentary, the directors engaged with their subject, telling a personal story but using it to open up what – for many – will be new ideas.\n\nLydia Lunch: The War Is Never Over (Beth B, USA, 2019) of course!\n\nThe Witch of the Cross (Sonia Bible, Australia, 2020) (Disclaimer: I’m featured in this as a talking head). The reconstructions are great and really add a depth to the work, there are numerous aspects to the story and it felt like this film engaged with them all.\n\nСпутник (Sputnik, Egor Abramenko, Russia, 2020) I really enjoyed this Russian horror / science fiction movie, it was one of the first films I saw after lockdown if memory serves and it was a joy to be in a cinema again with an audience watching this.\n\nSwallow (Carlo Mirabella-Davis, USA, 2019) (spoiler) it’s rare a film makes me wince, but watching the protagonist looking hungrily at a battery was one of those moments.\n\nNomadland (Chloe Zhao, USA, 2020) an exceptional and evocative work.\n\nDark Water (Erin Coates and Anna Nazzari, Australia, 2019, short film) a beautifully realised quasi-surreal work that is rich in dream imagery and psychological horror.\n\nRaw Power (Pierre-Luc Vaillancourt, Canada, 2020, short film) an experimental work exploring force, velocity, and power, consisting of flickering / strobing image manipulations depicting the two boxers training, all complimented by Marc Hurtado’s powerful score.\n\nMark Seman\n\nMEDIA TEACHER, AUSTRALIA\n\nNew apartment, living alone, quarantine – it was certainly a year for viewing.\n\nNew-ish releases (in Perth, Western Australia):\n\nONLINE FESTIVAL\n\nBloody Nose, Empty Pockets (Bill Ross IV, Turner Ross, 2020) (MIFF)\n\nAtlantis (Valentyn Vasyanovych, 2020) (Revelation)\n\nFrances Ferguson (Bob Byington, 2019) à (Revelation)\n\nCINEMA\n\nHvítur, hvítur dagur (A White, White Day, Hlynur Palmason, 2019)\n\nMUBI\n\nA Febre (The Fever, Maya Da-Rin, 2019)\n\nNovu Lituania (Karolis Kaupinis, 2019)\n\nDylda (Beanpole, Kantemir Balagov, 2019)\n\nNETFLIX\n\nUncut Gems (Benny Safdie, Josh Safdie, 2019)\n\nCrip Camp: A Disability Revolution (James Lebrecht & Nicole Newnham, 2020)\n\nOTHER STREAMING\n\nPortrait de la jeune fille en feu (Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Céline Sciamma, 2019)\n\nBergmál (Echo, Rúnar Rúnarsson, 2019)\n\nTV\n\nThe Deuce S3 (George Pelecanos & David Simon, 2019)\n\nOlder releases:\n\nJauja (Lisandro Alonso, 2014)\n\nWestern (Valeska Grisebach, 2017)\n\nThe Rider (Chloé Zhao, 2017)\n\nNosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu, F.W. Murnau, 1922)\n\nBastardy (Amiel Courtin-Wilson, 2008)\n\nLe Parc (Damien Manivel, 2016)\n\nFaces (John Cassavetes, 1968)\n\nVinterbrødre (Winter Brothers , Hlynur Palmason, 2017)\n\nAlle Anderen (Everyone Else, Maren Ade, 2009)\n\nBob Dylan: Don’t Look Back (D.A. Pennebaker, 1967)\n\nMa Loute (Slack Bay, Bruno Dumont, 2016)\n\nLa mujer sin cabeza (The Headless Woman, Lucrecia Martel, 2008)\n\nTian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud, Tsai Ming-liang, 2005)\n\nOnline festivals: Revelation Perth International Film Festival\n\nI have physically attended Perth’s Revelation International Film Festival every year since I left high school. That was 18 years ago. Mates told me how this year Revelation’s existence might be in trouble with the lack of physical ticketing. But to me this sounded like hearsay, speculation.\n\nRevelation adapted: the full programme went online, where viewers could buy rights to view films for a period of a few days, for about AUD$10/film. (Physical ticketing is usually about AUD$20/film.) As always, I combed through the programme – consistently delightful, strange, exotic – then chose ten or so films to view, buying a 6-ticket mini-pass for a discount, before hunkering down upon the couch. Always three or four of my yearly favourites are from Revelation. This year they were Frances Ferguson, A Family, Atlantis.\n\nLuna Leederville, my local independent, was shut for many months. But what a delight when it re-opened its doors a few weeks after the lifting of restrictions. I had worried dearly: this holy place I’d been visiting since a kid, a longer stay in my life than partners, houses and jobs – would it shut for once and all? No, it’s now back in action, seemingly kicking as strongly as ever. The first film I saw upon re-opening was Hlynur Palmason’s excellent Hvítur, hvítur dagur (A White, White Day).\n\n2020 was a test and it feels like independent cinema – here in Perth, between Revelation and Luna – seems to have passed. Maybe even with flying colours, evolving and expanding. Kudos to the teams at Revelation and Luna. May they and cinema never end.\n\nSarah Scales\n\nCOMPLETING A RESEARCH DEGREE IN CELEBRITY SCANDALS AND FAN PRACTICES AT SWINBURNE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, MELBOURNE\n\nFilms released for the first time in 2020:\n\nCINEMA\n\nBill & Ted Face the Music (Dean Parisot, 2020)\n\nBirds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (Cathy Yan, 2020)\n\nEmma.

If cinema is designed to transport, provoke, and move, then Coel’s work fits this definition, and it does so in ways far more powerful than the venerated so-called “provocateurs” of cinema. More often than not, the latter replicate rather than challenge the status quo (von Trier, Tarantino, etc.). (As much as I adore Fleabag, Destroy proves a much-needed corrective to Waller-Bridge’s painfully equivocated metoo politics.) To roughly paraphrase author Marlon James via a social media post: “It defies binge watching as you are contending with the film in your head.”\n\nSix Films Shown via Virtual Film Festival\n\nI had only visited one of these film festivals in-person (Romanian Film Festival Seattle), and the discovery of the other film festivals came about via word-of-mouth and copious amounts of time spent-online.\n\nDortmund Cologne International Women’s Film Festival\n\nMore so a lecture performance than film, Julia Nitschke’s People suck but it’s okay because cats (2020) was a bright light of internet cat content in the early days of lockdown. Ines Johnson-Spain’s Becoming Black (2020), a documentary on her childhood/young adult life in the GDR and contending with “color blind” racism, establishes her as a phenomenal talent.\n\nSeattle Queer Film Festival\n\nLeoni Krippendorf’s queer coming of age story, Kokon (2020), is heart-wrenchingly beautiful. It manages to explore early teenage sexuality without being creepy (see: Bertrand Bonello’s Zombie Child [2019]). Also featured at the festival, the documentary Uferfrauen (2020, Babara Wallbraun) presents itself as a simplistic documentary on the lives of “Lesbian life and love in the GDR,” it juxtaposes the triumph of the radical everyday with the threat of political oppression.\n\nRomanian Film Festival Seattle\n\nCollective (Alexander Nanau, 2020) is easily one of my top 10 films of the year. It details a 2015 fire in a Bucharest club and the journalist investigation that exposed large-scale negligence and government corruption. Like Uferfrauen, the film presents itself as a deceptively straightforward documentary that peels back the devastating amount of corruption – parallels with the United States. Particularly stunning and disturbing is actual footage from inside the club.\n\nChicago International Film Festival\n\nUndine (2020). Barbara still remains my favorite of Berlin school director Christian Petzold’s films. What elevates this film is Paula Beer’s stunning performance as the water being/Berlin tour guide.\n\nThe four films I saw in movie theaters\n\nThere were a few moments, in the months prior to the shutdown in mid-March and brief lifting of restrictions in October, where I could physically visit the cinema.\n\nThe Fargo Theater: I grew up in Fargo (yes, like the film/television series!) Parasite (Bong Joon-ho, 2019) played to a packed house in mid-February, just a week after its Oscar win. Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Celine Sciamma, 2019) has one of the most powerful final shots I have seen in a film. I adore you, Fargo Theater; please put some posters of female directed films up in your lobby – Celine Sciamma would be a good start!\n\nWest Acres Cinema: Emma. (Autumn de Wilde, 2020): My sister and I started giggling at one scene towards the beginning of the film (a pretty blatant attempt to reverse the male gaze), to which a group in front of us started giggling in response. Soon, the whole theatre was laughing. I miss that.\n\nMichigan Theater: When restrictions were briefly lifted in Ann Arbor in Fall 2020, my sister and I visited a screening of the Empire Strikes Back (Irvin Kershner, 1980). This film had been my first introduction to the Star Wars Universe when I saw it on VHS over 30 years ago, and I have been hooked ever since. (Exhausted parents, stuck at home with two sick four year olds, probably thought the “movie with Yoda” would provide the most appeal, prescient of today’s Baby Yoda mania.) One week before the 2020 election, a fully masked audience sat in rapt attention (sans popcorn) and applauded at the end. It’s such an incredibly beautiful and funny film, and remains one of my favorites to this day. A special thanks to Andrew Rogers for his beautiful rendition of the “Princess Leia Theme.” (RIP, Carrie Fisher!)\n\nThere were many other films viewed via streaming platforms this year that deeply moved me: Only You (Harry Wootliff, 2018), The Assistant (Kitty Green, 2019), Never Rarely Sometimes Always (Eliza Hittman, 2020) The Forty Old Version (Radha Blank, 2020), House of Hummingbird (Kim Bora, 2018). A few will see cinematic release after this deadline Promising Young Woman (Emerald Fennell, 2020), Wonder Woman (Patty Jenkins, 2020). I’m saddened by their shortened/lack of theatrical release in the States, but grateful to the phenomenal artists who made these works available.\n\nhoward schumanN\n\nFILM CRITIC FOR THE CRITICAL CRITICS\n\n20 Favourite Films of 2020\n\nNever Sometimes Rarely Always (Eliza Hittman, US, 2020)\n\nJ’ai Perdu Mon Corps (I Lost My Body, Jérémy Clapin, France, 2019)* An animated film about the attempt to recover a part of one’s self which was once vibrant and alive, but is now hidden. The story of a disembodied hand severed in a tragic accident, which takes on a life and personality of its own as it seeks reunion with the body it lost.\n\nFirst Cow (Kelly Reichardt, U.S, 2019)* Reichardt quietly explores a male friendship that is built upon kindness and mutual acceptance and offers a vision of an American dream not yet corrupted by self-interest or exploitation. It is a song to nature, a tribute to intimacy and friendship, and a solid rebuke to Hollywood’s image of the gung-ho masculinity of the Old West.\n\nOn the Rocks (Sofia Coppola, U.S., 2020) A light comedy about a playboy father and anxiety-ridden daughter snooping on a husband suspected of cheating. With Bill Murray as the sleuthing dad, Rashida Jones as the suspecting wife, and Marlon Waylans as the would-be philanderer, on first glance, the film seems to be headed towards sitcom territory; however, a witty and affecting script by Coppola and busloads of chemistry between the two main protagonists reveals depths that transcend any superficial judgments.\n\nHine Anachnu (Here We Are, Nir Bergman, Israel, 2020) Israeli director Nir Bergman focuses on the co-dependent relationship between Aharon, a separated father in his 50s, and his autistic son Uri, a young man who is unable to care for himself. While the story may not sound uplifting, in Bergman’s skilful hands, its sadness is balanced with humour and buoyed by the strength and dignity of its characters.\n\nPortrait de la jeune fille en feu (Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Céline Sciamma, France, (2019)* Set in an isolated home on the Brittany coast in the 18th century, Portrait of a Lady on Fire is the story of an “impossible” relationship between two women in an era that rejected their form of sexual expression. Told with an understated passion, the lovers, Héloïse, the daughter of a countess, and artist Marianne are bound by the rules determined by the patriarchal society in which they live, and the full expression of their love is burdened by the knowledge that it is doomed to end.\n\nTenki no Ko (Weathering With You, Makoto Shinkai, Japan 2019)* Set in Tokyo during a record-breaking rainstorm that has lasted for months and has caused widespread flooding, this is the story of a young girl known, according to Japanese legend, as a “weather maiden,” one who has the power to affect the weather through the force of her prayers. While the film is a fantasy that soars to realms beyond the reach of our earthbound senses, it is also relevant to the contemporary issue of climate change.\n\nFatima (Marco Pontecorvo, Portugal, 2020) A retelling of the fact-based 1917 sighting of the Lady identified as the Virgin Mary, first brought to the screen in “The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima.” The present story is told from the point of view of the three young children, especially that of Lúcia who bears the main job of convincing the community of the authenticity of her visions. The film challenges our normal consensus view of reality and strives to evoke in us a renewed sense of mystery often missing in contemporary culture.\n\nLa vita davanti a sé (The Life Ahead, Edoardo Ponti, Italy, 2020) A sincere look at the relationship between an orphaned Muslim boy from Senegal and an aging Holocaust survivor and former sex worker played by Sophia Loren, now in her 86th Adapted from a novel by Romain Gary, the film has been updated with references to illegal immigration and transgender relationships to support the film’s excellent performances, especially from Loren who still maintains her stately beauty.\n\nHoneyland (Ljubomir Stefanov and Tomara Kotevska, Macedonia, 2019)* Honeyland looks into the ancient tradition of beekeeping, a tradition that has been attuned to the rhythms of nature for centuries. Set among the isolated villages and rocky hills of North Macedonia and shot over a period of three years by cinematographers, Fejmi Daut and Samir Ljuma, the film is about more than beekeeping. It is a story of connection and belonging, about our relationship with the planet, a film that asks us what kind of world we want to live in.\n\n*Released in Canada in 2020\n\npummy sharma\n\nPHD SCHOLAR & CINEPHILE FROM IIT JAMMU, INDIA\n\nWatching Films in the Times of COVID-19\n\nThe year 2020 has been the wildest, nerve-racking, soul-stirring year of my life. When most of the population sat locked in their homes, cinema, music, art and indoor hobbies were only a few things that kept people sane. I made it a point to discover many unheard of gems of cinema through film discussions and film festivals, to enrich my film knowledge and satiate my hunger for good cinema. First, I utilised this year to catch up on beautiful films, like The Irishman, Jojo Rabbit and Joker, that I missed out in the previous year because of my busy schedule. Second, I unearthed many treasures from Indian regional cinema. If any readers want to experience Indian cinema away from the market influenced Bollywood, they can watch The Catastrophe, The Firingoti and other films by Jahnu Barua. Third, rather than focusing on movies that were released in 2020, my focus was to find and watch unheard masterpieces of cinema.\n\nThe world lost many celluloid gems in the form of the great Irrfan Khan, Shashi Kapoor, Sushant Singh Rajput, Chadwick Boseman, and others. The loss of Irrfan Khan and Chadwick Boseman almost felt like a personal loss because of the long-sufferings they endured. I searched for the best films of these legends and religiously watched them.\n\nAmong the films released in 2020, my favourite is Da 5 Bloods. The film is the best combination of writing, direction, acting and unabashed politics. I do not recall having experienced such a level of acting and direction in recent times. The monologue by Delroy Lindo is one of the best moments of film history for me in a decade. Pataal Lok, an Indian web series released in 2020 is the best TV series I watched in this year. The TV series is a satire on the political situation that has emerged in India post-2014 after Narendra Modi became the prime minister. The series, ridicules without any restraint, the news circus that has become a new norm in Indian journalism of late.\n\nFilms Released in 2020 (in alphabetical order):\n\nCargo (Arati Kadav, 2020)\n\nDa 5 Bloods (Spike Lee, 2020)\n\nDil Bechara (Mukesh Chhabra, 2020)\n\nEnola Holmes (Harry Bradbeer, 2020)\n\nGulabo Sitabo (Shoojit Sircar, 2020)\n\nLootcase (Rajesh Krishnan, 2020)\n\nRaat Akeli Hai (Honey Trehan, 2020)\n\nSerious Men (Sudhir Mishra, 2020)\n\nShubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan (Hitesh Kewalya, 2020)\n\nTenet (Christopher Nolan, 2020)\n\nOlder Films (in alphabetical order):\n\nAnnie Hall (Woody Allen, 1977)\n\nAnnihilation (Alex Garland, 2008)\n\nAnother Year (Mike Leigh, 2010)\n\nBlood Diamond (Edward Zwick, 2006)\n\nBird Box (Susanne Bier, 2018)\n\nBurn After Reading (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2008)\n\nCrazy, Stupid, Love (Glenn Ficarra, 2011)\n\nDeep Horizon (Peter Berg, 2016)\n\nexistenZ (David Cronenberg, 1999)\n\nFiringoti (The Spark,1992)\n\nGhost in the Shell (Rupert Sanders, 2017)\n\nHkhagoroloi Bohu Door (It’s a Long Way to the Sea, Jahnu Barua, 1995)\n\nJoker (Todd Phillips 2019)\n\nKonikar Ramdhenu (Ride on the Rainbow, 2003)\n\nHalodhia Choraye Baodhan Khai (The Catastrophe, Jahnu Barua, 1987)\n\nPaan Singh Tomar (Tigmanshu Dhulia, 2012)\n\nPrometheus (Ridley Scott, 2012)\n\nQarib Qarib Single (Tanuja Chandra, 2017)\n\nRepo Men (Miguel Sapochnik, 2010)\n\nSchindler’s List (Steven Spielberg, 1993)\n\nThe Art of Travel (Thomas Whelan, 2008)\n\nThe Big Lebowski (Joel and Ethan Coen, 1998)\n\nThat Gutsy Morning (Jahnu Barua, 2016)\n\nThe Imitation Game (Morten Tyldum 2014)\n\nThe Irishman (Martin Scorsese, 2019)\n\nThe Two Popes (Ferrando Meirelles, 2019)\n\nVice (Brian A Miller, 2015)\n\nTV Series (old and new, in alphabetical order):\n\nAtypical (Seth Gordon, 2017-20)\n\nBandish Bandits (Anand Tiwari, 2020)\n\nLittle Things (Dhruv Sehgal, 2016-19)\n\nMirzapur (Karan Anshuman et.al., 2018-20)\n\nPanchayat (Deepak Kumar Mishra, 2020)\n\nPataal Lok (Avinash Arun and Prosit Roy, 2020)\n\nchristopher sikich\n\nTEACHER OF BIOLOGY, PHOTOGRAPHER OF LIVE MUSIC AND NATURE, FILM SNOB; BASED IN PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA\n\nDa 5 Bloods (Spike Lee, 2020)\n\nThe Half of It (Alice Wu, 2020)\n\nLovers Rock (Steve McQueen, 2020)\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always (Eliza Hittman, 2020)\n\nI’m Thinking of Ending Things (Charlie Kaufman, 2020)\n\nDavid Byrne’s American Utopia (Spike Lee, 2020)\n\nMank (David Fincher, 2020)\n\nThe Vast of Night (Andrew Patterson, 2020)\n\nTenet (Christopher Nolan, 2020)\n\nJohn Lewis: Good Trouble (Dawn Porter, 2020)\n\n*Best Discovery of the Past: Distant Voices, Still Lives (Terence Davies, 1988)\n\nvalerie Soe\n\nWRITER AND FILMMAKER, AUTHORS THE BLOG BEYONDASIAPHILIA.COM\n\nFilms released for the first time in 2020 (in no particular order):\n\n76 Days (Hao Wu, 2020) (viewed at 2020 San Diego Asian Film Festival) This documentary is an achingly empathetic look at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China in early 2020 as the city of 11 million people locked down to control the spread of the virus. Focusing primarily on hospitals in the metropolis, the verite-style film is a compassionate look at China’s frontline medical workers and the patients they cared for during those chaotic first weeks.\n\nBe Water (Bao Nguyen, 2020) (viewed at 2020 Hawai’i International Film Festival) This meticulously crafted film is the biographical documentary that Bruce Lee deserves, adeptly combining a treasure trove of archival footage with a vast range of interviews. The film eschews a talking-heads format, instead keeping interviewees off-screen, which allows the footage to shine. Director Nguyen deftly places Lee’s work in its historical context, discussing how racism in Hollywood, 1960s counterculture, and Hong Kong’s singular milieu influenced the great martial artist.\n\nKeep Rolling (Man Lim-chung, 2020) (viewed at 2020 Hawai’i International Film Festival) This documentary focuses on legendary Hong Kong director Ann Hui, tracing Hui’s career from her apprenticeship with King Hui in the 1970s through the making of her most recent film. Director Man’s unobtrusive, observational style catches Hui as she interacts with her elderly mother, scouts locations, smokes incessantly, and prepares to be honoured at the 2019 Venice Film Festival, among other revealing daily activities.\n\nLos Hermanos/The Brothers (Marcia Jarmel and Ken Schneider, 2020) (viewed at 2020 Mill Valley Film Festival) Los Hermanos/The Brothers looks at Afro-Cubano sibling musicians Ilmar and Aldo López-Gavilán as they attempt to record an album together despite political and geographic challenges. Los Hermanos effortlessly weaves together its images with its gorgeous score (composed by Aldo), using the soundtrack to drive and elevate the narrative, and Jarmel and Schneider skilfully portray the brothers’ relationship with each other. The movie turns an affectionate lens on Cuba, depicting the island nation awash in vibrant pastel light.\n\nKim Ji Young, born 1982 (Kim Do-young, 2019) (viewed at 2020 San Diego Asian Film Festival) Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, this is a sensitive and thoughtful look at a young mother and wife attempting to overcome South Korea’s quotidian sexist and patriarchal social structures. Despite attacks by anti-feminists it was one of the top grossing films of 2019 in South Korea.\n\nSubarashiki Sekai (Under The Open Sky, Miwa Nishikawa, 2020) (viewed at 2020 Hawai’i International Film Festival) Koji Yakusho is on point as a low-level gangster recently released from prison whose earnest attempts to go straight are thwarted by Japan’s societal restrictions. The film is neither overly sentimental nor unduly sensationalist and director Nishikawa draws out a layered and subtle performance from veteran actor Yakusho (The Eel; Shall We Dance; The Third Murder), who despite being occasionally befuddled by modern society is stolidly undeterred by the petty obstacles hindering his attempts to reintegrate into society.\n\nMy Prince Edward (Norris Wong, 2019) (viewed at CAAMfest CAAM Forward drive-in) Shot en la calle in Mongkok and focusing on an ordinary woman navigating the complexities of life and relationships, the film is a simple and affecting throwback to Hong Kong’s New Wave.\n\nThree Missing Letters (Lin+Lam, 2020) (viewed at the KW Institute for Contemporary Art website) This short experimental essay film imagines the fate of three letters that were lost when a rocket-driven mail delivery exploded over the India-China border in 1934, using simple animation, voiceover, and gorgeous extended time-lapses of landscapes in the region to meditate on the cultural and political significance of the mail, amongst the backdrop of the Himalayas.\n\nOlder films encountered for the first time in 2020 (in no particular order):\n\nDaeho (The Tiger, Park Hoon-Jung, 2015) (viewed online 2020 as part of Korean Cultural Center Washington, D.C. K-Cinema at Home series) A solid slice of genre film set during the Japanese occupation of Korea, The Tiger is anchored by Choi Min-shik performance as a retired tiger hunter who is reluctantly drawn back into the fray in pursuit of a legendary one-eyed tiger on Jirasan Mountain.\n\nChung Hing Sam Lam (Chungking Express, Wong Kar-wai, 1994) Wong’s wondrous and exhilarating film screened as part of Existence Is Longing: Wong Kar Wai, at the Pacific Film Archive, from a longer series of 4k digital restorations of his oeuvre that originated at the Lincoln Center in New York. Even after many viewings this film never fails to make me smile and it retains its freshness and exuberance even after more than 25 years since its release.\n\nHonourable mentions:\n\nSound of Metal (Darius Marder, 2020)\n\nThe Bee Gees: How Can You Mend A Broken Heart (Frank Marshall, 2020)\n\nWaikiki (Christopher Kahunahana, 2020)\n\nWuyong (2007) and Yi zhi you dao hai shui bian lan (Swimming Out Till The Sea Turns Blue, 2020) – Jia Zhangke\n\nNo Crying At The Dinner Table (Carol Nguyen, 2020)\n\nMemorable online festivals from 2020:\n\nAfter a bit of a film-watching drought as festivals scrambled to migrate online, by the last quarter of 2020 there were several outstanding programs available via streaming. I saw many films at the Mill Valley Film Festival, the San Diego Asian Film Festival and the Hawai’i International Film Festival, all of which had excellent programming as well as user-friendly online platforms. I also viewed several films through smaller festivals such as CAAMfest’s CAAM Forward, as well as ongoing programming by the Washington, D.C Korean Cultural Center’s K-Cinema at Home series and the Asian Pop-Up Cinema series in Chicago.\n\nmark spratt\n\nINDEPENDENT FILM DISTRIBUTOR IN AUSTRALIA/NEW ZEALAND & CINEPHILE\n\nA year’s viewing like no other and too much of it in a living room environment, yet the films that turned up streamed on line from many different cultural institutions that one might have not encountered otherwise (e.g. Filmmuseum Münich, Anthology Film Archives, Cinémathèque Française, Pordenone’s Silent Stream et al) made for a most satisfying year overall. Online festivals and markets (Melbourne, Bologna, Pordenone, Cannes, San Sebastien, Venice) filled in many of the gaps we were experiencing in “live” presentations.\n\nMy list is a grazing over some of the highlights seen from a variety of sources in a chronological order of the year.\n\nWaves (Trey Edward Schults, 2019)\n\nMartin Eden (Pietro Marcello, 2019)\n\nEmma. (Autumn de Wilde, 2020)\n\nThe Hunt (Craig Zobel, 2020)\n\nBoze Cialo (Corpus Christi, 2019) and Sala Samobojcow (The Hater, 2020) – both by Jan Komasa\n\nJ’accuse (An Officer and A Spy, Roman Polanski, 2019)\n\nThe Assistant (Kitty Green, 2009)\n\nDau: Natasha (Ilya Khrzhanovsky, Jekatarina Oertel, 2020) and Dau: Degeneration (Ilya Khrzhanovsky, Ilya Permyakov, 2020). Both included as they must be part of a debate on their role in cinema as a recording of a vast social experiment. These two films in the Dau series to come are the closest films I can think of to compare to Salo (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1975) as an examination of the true limits (or absence of them) when a group of humans isolate themselves from ‘normal’ society.\n\nThe Trouble With Being Born (Sandra Wollner, 2020)\n\nFirst Cow (Kelly Reichardt, 2019)\n\nLa Llorona (Jayro Bustamente, 2019)\n\nI’m Thinking Of Ending Things (Charlie Kaufman, 2020)\n\nDorogle Tovarishchi (Dear Comrades, Andrei Konchalovsky, 2020)\n\nQuo Vadis, Aida? (Jasmila Zbanic, 2020)\n\nAbwege (Georg Wilhelm Pabst, 1928)\n\nStraight Shooting (John Ford, 1917)\n\nShatranj-E Band (Chess Of The Wind, Mohammad Reza Aslani, 1976)\n\nThe Woman In Black (Herbert Wise, 1989)\n\nA mention too for two documentaries that act as important correctives to ignorant social media campaigning and the appropriation of names for causes:\n\nBy The Way, Woody Allen Is Innocent (Rick Worley, 2020) and\n\nAka Jane Roe (Nick Sweeny, 2020)\n\nTo end on a light note, it is always interesting to find a modern film unexpectedly illuminating one from the past. Misbehaviour (Phillippa Lowthorne, 2020) is an average if likable celebration of the nascent Women’s Movement protesting and disrupting the UK’S Miss World competition in 1970. But Carry On Girls (Gerald Thomas, 1973) in its inimitable way got there first and is a quite credible and thoughtful acknowledgement of Women’s Lib and the 1970 events (with some tits, bums and drag jokes!)\n\nmadalina stefan\n\nPOSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHER FOR FILM, LITERATURE AND CULTURAL STUDIES, Westfälische Wilhelms Universität Münster\n\nFilms released for the first time in 2020 (festivals, cinemas, streaming services):\n\nWolfwalkers (Tomm Moore, Ross Stewart, 2020)\n\nI’m Thinking of Ending Things (Charlie Kaufman, 2020)\n\nDomangchin yeoja (The Woman who ran, Hong Sang-Soo, 2020)\n\nNever Rarely Sometimes Always (Eliza Hittman, 2020)\n\nStories from the Chestnut Woods (Gregor Božič, 2019)\n\nStray (Elizabeth Lo, 2020)\n\nCharter (Amanda Kernell, 2020)\n\nCity Hall (Frederick Wiseman, 2020)\n\n1917 (Sam Mendes, 2019)\n\nDark Waters (Todd Haynes, 2019)\n\nMank (David Fincher, 2020)\n\nArchive (Gavin Rothery, 2020)\n\nThe King of Staten Island (Judd Apatow, 2020)\n\nLet Them All Talk (Steven Soderbergh, 2020)\n\nOlder films encountered for the first time in 2020 (seen in festivals, cinémathèques, re-releases, home entertainment, streaming channels, etc):\n\nJeux interdit (Forbidden Games, René Clément, 1952)\n\nWoman of the Lake (Yoshishige Yoshida, 1966)\n\nSuddenly, last Summer (Joseph L.

Maybe they’ll turn up on next year’s list. This was an awful year on every level for reasons we all know, and some of the films I included here were watched thanks to online events like the D’A Film Festival or the Gijón International Film Festival. Both were good ways to keep up with new releases by great or interesting filmmakers, or to discover new directors to follow their future work. There were also films that I found horrendous, mediocre or overrated made by established filmmakers (Fincher, Nolan, Dardennes, Mendes, Waititi, Gerwig, Ritchie, Larraín), disappointments (Herzog, Bernard Rose, Campos, Eggers, Kore-eda, Reichardt… I know I have to give her another try) and discoveries I’ll try to give another opportunity to their future films (Marcello, Gaztelu-Urrutia, Lulu Wang). Maybe the problem is mine for failing to appreciate their possible merits.\n\nIt’s sad to read the news about movie theatres closing since they are the best medium to watch a film. It’s also sad to note that for many people the only thing that exists are the current and future TV series or films usually based on famous franchises like Marvel, DC or Star Wars, whether they are good or awful, while they ignore lots of other cinematographic experiences, but I am not going to chastise them; I hope they enjoy them. On a more optimistic note, remember that Cinema has been declared dead many times and it is still with us. I sincerely hope that 2021 will be a better year for everyone on every level, and like I said the previous year, still waiting for Carax and Verhoeven."
