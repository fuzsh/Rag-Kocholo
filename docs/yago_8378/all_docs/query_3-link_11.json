        "text": "After the many praises here I honestly have to tell that this movie IMHO is somewhat a let down.\n\nThe first 45-50 minutes of the movie felt like it should have been 10 maybe 15 minutes. The second half is actually the movie itself for wich the preparation took too long.\n\nI don't know the book it was based on, maybe it didn't offer enough material for a full movie or maybe it couldn't be interpreted well enough.\n\nI'd say it's still worth watching but so far this is my least favourite of the Isbert movies. I'd much rather suggest Calabuch, Bienvenido Mister Marshall or Verdugo if you haven't seen those yet...\n\nJos√© Isbert is a widower and disregarded by his family. He has his friends, all of whom have wheelchairs of various sorts, and Isbert can't keep up with them. He takes it into his head that he wants a wheelchair himself, and not just any wheelchair, but a motorized one that will let him get around easily.\n\nIt has two stories to tell: one is the lack of regard people hold their elders in, and that is heartrending. The other is Isbert's child-like and childish insistence on getting his own way no matter the consequences. Isbert's performance is very real, and very telling, but the two stories are in conflict; to sympathize with him is to make the social commentary telling, but Isbert's performance reduces that impact; and so the performance of Pedro Porcel as his son and financial mainstay of the family remains emotionally uncaring but practical.\n\nAll of the friends of Anselmo (Pepe Isbert, a genius) have their own disabled-adapted little cars, they go anywhere they want: to the main square, to the country... Anselmo's on his own, and he feels lonely. No way! He decides he also wants one of those cars (doesn't matter if he's not a disabled person) and he'll do ANYTHING to get one: to pretend he's been left paralyzed, to steal... WHATEVER it takes.\n\n\"El cochecito\" is nothing but a classic of Spanish cinema (or of cinema in general) and such a referent of European realism. It is a so funny comedy written by Rafael Azcona (maybe the best Spanish scriptwriter ever) and placed on the impoverished streets of Madrid (late 50's).\n\nYou MUSTN'T miss this one (not if you love cinema).\n\n*My rate: 9/10"
