        "text": "What if you could take a lesson right now, in your home, from Juan Tamariz? Sign up for that! We regard him as the greatest living magician! And in a way, now we can. We’re very happy to announce that we now have ALL THREE VOLUMES of Juan Tamariz’s Lessons in Magic available for instant download. As soon as you click \"buy,\" the learning starts almost immediately. No shipping. No waiting. Right now.\n\nThe best part? This DVD series has been $90 since it was released. The download is just $15 for each part, or $40 for the set!\n\nJuan Tamariz is a one-of-a-kind performer. A household name in his native Spain, he is one of the most unique and talented performers ever to grace our art. In the tradition of Vernon and Slydini he has blazed his own enchanted trail. His books on magic are required reading for any thinking student of magic.\n\nJuan is the consummate performer. Armed with only a deck of cards he can entertain a small group or a packed auditorium for hours. He is hilariously funny, but at the same time he'll fool you like you've never been fooled before. He is one of magic's greatest thinkers, a master of misdirection and a magic philosophy, and he has never had a large body of material recorded... until now! In these 3 videos you will learn invaluable lessons in routining and construction, magical emotion, technique and presentation.\n\nLessons in Magic - Part 1\n\nNeither Blind Nor Stupid: A masterful and thoughtful lesson in routining and magical structure that takes a self-working effect and turns it into a masterpiece of showmanship!\n\nFollow The Leader: Not since Vernon has anyone received such a strong impact wit this classic of card magic. Routining and audience participation make thus a real Tamariz gem!\n\nCards Across: Two merely thought of cards by two spectators magically travel from one packet to another. This long sought after effect is now revealed!\n\nThe Caricature: One of Juan's signature pieces. A packet effect with real personality and a surprise climax!\n\nLessons in Magic - Part 2\n\nThe Secret of Magic: Take the audience in a journey through a real visual illusion; then the illusion becomes reality!\n\nFour of a Kind: A study in psychologically leading the audience's emotions and the use of body language to subconsciously build suspense!\n\nEl Cochecito: As performed by Juan on The World's Greatest magic Television Special! This is the real work on magic and emotion- taking the audience back to childhood, capturing their imagination and sense of wonder through the use of a simple toy car. This is a prime example of how to take an innocent prop and turn it into a magical showpiece!\n\nThe Cannibals: One of Juan's signature pieces. Juan's presentation of this classic plot is a real work of art. It elevates the storyline to an emotional, audience-pleasing, interactive adventure!"
