        "text": "Before Lars von Trier (the ‘bad’ one – the one who directed ‘Antichrist’ and ‘Nymphomaniac’) there was Marco Ferreri. In 1976, when he made ‘La dernière femme‘, the Italian screenwriter and director had wowed bourgeois audiences (and the members of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival) with ‘La grande bouffe’, a film in which four men gather to eat until they die. With the erotic drama ‘La dernière femme‘ Ferreri probably set out to explore the limits again, tackling another theme related to human desires – sexuality and the ways in which it is perceived by men and women. The result was a controversial film, as he wanted, banned or limited for certain audiences in many cinema markets, the ending of which has become something of a legend in the history of cinema. It would not be Marco Ferreri‘s last ‘shocking’ film. I saw it almost half a century after it was made. I believe that if it was made today the film would be just as controversial, if not more controversial. But it’s also a film that raises a lot of questions, bold in both theme and approach, with superb acting, famous actors in some of the most interesting roles of their careers, and enough mystery and ambiguity to leave room for hot debates.\n\nUnlike the characters in ‘La grande bouffe’, who belong to the rich classes, the heroes of ‘La dernière femme‘ are ordinary people, living in an urban environment unsettling by the rectangular artificiality of the buildings and the banality of the interiors. In the first scene of the film the engineer Gérard is fired from his job in a big chemical factory, but he does not seem at all affected by this situation. His worries are raising his one-year-old son and especially chasing after women. We learn soon that his wife had left him with the child in his care to devote herself to a feminist political career and perhaps to maintain a lesbian relationship. Gérard brings home Valerie, the gorgeous caretaker from the daycare where he was bringing his son. What starts as a casual fling develops into a complex relationship. Gérard and Valerie don’t seem to match at all, what each is looking for in a relationship is as different as in the relationship between Mars and Venus. They don’t love each other, they have a lot of sex, but neither finds satisfaction in their relationship, not to mention happiness. Is Valerie too immature? Is Gérard too self-absorbed? The two are neither able to love, nor separate, nor destroy each other. Maybe only themselves."
