He also built non-motorised vehicles, folding wheelchairs, delivery tricycles and trailers.\n\nThe Abad marque garnered considerable attention in Spain in 1960 when one of their machines featured in the film El Cochecito, directed by Marco Ferreri and starring Jos√© Isbert.\n\nSources: OTTW, Autopasion18.com"
