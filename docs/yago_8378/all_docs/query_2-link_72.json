Three of the films that he directed are among the 100 films selected for preservation for significant contribution to Italian cinema. A university dropout, he worked briefly as a journalist before starting in films as a producer of commercials around 1950. He then worked in various capacities on a number of Italian features. In 1957, he went to Spain, where he made his debut as a feature director with \"El Pisito\" in 1958, which was followed by two more Spanish films. Many of his films are black comedies or satirical observations of social conventions and middle-class sexual mores. He was at times criticized for his stridently bleak view of human nature. He is considered by critics as one of the greatest European cinematic provocateurs of his time. He had a constant presence in a prestigious festival circuit, including eight films in competition at the Cannes Film Festival and being awarded the Grand Prize in 1978 for \"Bye, Bye Monkey,\" after being nominated five times, he received the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 1991 for the \"House of Smiles.\" He received the 1982 David di Donatello Awards for \"Tales of Ordinary Madness\" in the categories of Best Director and Best Screenplay. Of the eight acting roles he had, most were bit parts, such as an unnamed landlord or priest, with one in 1979 being uncredited. He is credited as a co-screenwriter for eight films, of which he was also the director. His film credits include \"El cochecito\" in 1960, \"La donna scimmia\" in 1964, \"Dillinger è morto\" in 1969, \"La grande bouffe\" in 1973, \"L´ultima donna \" in 1976, \"Storia di Piera\" in 1982, \"La carne\" in 1991 and \"Nitrato d'argento\" in 1996. He died of a heart attack. He and his wife Jacqueline were professional colleagues.\n\nFilm Director.
