        "text": "JosÃ© Luis LÃ³pez VÃ¡zquez de la Torre MMT (11 March 1922 â 2 November 2009) was a Spanish actor, comedian, costume designer, scenic designer, and assistant director. A prolific performer, he was an integral part of Spanish cinema for six decades, appearing in almost 250 films between 1948 and 2007. Internationally he was known for his lead role in the surrealist horror telefilm La cabina (1972). Born in Madrid of working-class parents, LÃ³pez VÃ¡zquez began his career on stage at 17 as a costume designer and set decorator before making his breakthrough as an actor. In film he initially worked as a costume designer and assistant director, while playing bit parts. However, his comedic talent soon allowed him to get bigger roles, cultivating an image as Spain's on-screen everyman in numerous comedies during the Franco era, although he later revealed his ability to play dramatic roles. At the time he took part in a distinctive Spanish art cinema led primarily by directors Luis GarcÃ­a Berlanga, Juan Antonio Bardem, Carlos Saura and screenwriter Rafael Azcona, which gained international attention. He also worked with renowned foreign filmmakers such as Marco Ferreri and George Cukor. He acted in the films Boyfriend in Sight (1954), Miracles of Thursday (1957), El Pisito (1959), El Cochecito (1960), PlÃ¡cido (1961), Atraco a las tres (1962), The Executioner (1963), Peppermint FrappÃ© (1967), The Ancines Woods (1970), Long Live the Bride and Groom (1970), The Garden of Delights (1970), My Dearest Senorita (1972), Travels with My Aunt (1972), Habla, mudita (1973), Cousin Angelica (1974), La escopeta nacional (1978) and its sequels Patrimonio nacional (1981) and Nacional III (1982), The Beehive (1982), Akelarre (1984), Moors and Christians (1987), Esquilache (1989), The Fencing Master (1992), Everyone Off to Jail (1993), and Moon of Avellaneda (2004), among others. LÃ³pez VÃ¡zquez won two Silver Hugo Awards at the Chicago International Film Festival, four CEC Awards, two Fotogramas de Plata, two Sant Jordi Awards, one TP de Oro, and two New York Latin ACE Awards bestowed by the Association of Latin Entertainment Critics. His accolades include the Honorary Spike at the Valladolid International Film Festival in 1989, the National Theatre Award in 2002, and the Honorary Goya Award for lifetime achievement in 2005. The Government of Spain awarded him the Gold Medal of Merit in the Fine Arts in 1985 and the Gold Medal of Merit in Labour in 1997."
