We first met in Los Angeles in 1982, when he came\n\nto show Furtivos at the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television. I began to realize the extraordinary range and depth of his knowledge when I interviewed him at that time, and that realization has been reconfirmed over the years through many intense conversations about cinema and culture. He also has helped me to meet many other key figures in Spanish cinema and to obtain the permissions that made the CD-ROM possible. He was the first person to read an early draft of the manuscript and to offer valuable suggestions on how it might be improved. I am grateful for the total cooperation and enthusiastic support I have received from the Spanish Ministry of Culture—particularly from Carmelo Romero, who helped me at virtually every stage of my work, and Fernando Méndez-Leite, the former general director of cinema, who first made it possible for me to see many films at the ministry. I am also deeply indebted to the Filmoteca Espafiola where\n\nI did a great deal of my research—particularly to its director, José\n\nMaria Prado Garcia, who made it possible for me to see films and\n\nto reproduce some of the excerpts on the CD-ROM, and to Dolores Devesa at the library, who was extraordinarily generous and efficient — in helping me locate the specific information, journals, and stills that I needed.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all of the illustrations that.\n\nappear in the book were obtained from the extensive collection at the\n\nFilmoteca. I also want to express my thanks to three institutions in Spain and the United States that have financially supported this project. In Spain, the U.S.-Spanish Joint Committee for Educational and Cultural Exchange awarded me a grant in 1986-87 which enabled me to start doing the research for the book; at my home institution, the University of Southern California, a grant from the Faculty Inno-\n\nvative Research Fund supported my writing during summer 1989;\n\nand in 1992, the Program for Cultural Cooperation between Spain’s Ministry of Culture and United States’ Universities partially funded both the publication of the book and the production of the related interactive CD-ROM. Several scholars working on Spanish cinema read earlier versions of various chapters and gave me valuable critical response. First among them is my close friend, the late Katherine Singer Kovacs, who collaborated with me on organizing the first scholarly panel on Spanish cinema at the annual meeting of the Society for Cinema\n\nStudies in Bozeman, Montana, in 1988 (where we both read selections from the chapters we were working on) and a retrospective in\n\n1989 called Spanish Cinema: The Politics of Family and Gender, which included many of the films we were both writing about at the time. Unfortunately, she did not live long enough to complete her own book on Spanish cinema, which is a great loss to the field. I am also grateful to her husband, Steven Kovacs, who made many of her\n\nbooks and journals on Spanish cinema available to me and who, as\n\nthe producer of Rio abajo, also provided valuable information for\n\nchapter 7.\n\nI want to give special thanks to Marvin D’Lugo for his perceptive\n\nreading of my manuscript and his valuable suggestions for improving it and for sharing with me many of his videotapes. He has been an\n\nx\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nimportant influence on my work, not only through his wonderful book on Saura and his published essays but also through the many stimulating conversations we have had over the years about Spanish cinema, regionalism, and theory, which helped to clarify many of my own ideas. Kathleen M. Vernon, Agustin Sanchez Vidal, Roman Gubern, Victor Fuentes, and Jénaro Talens have also given me\n\nsupportive readings of parts (or all) of the manuscript as well as useful\n\nsuggestions.\n\nSeveral important figures from Spanish cinema (in addition to José Luis Borau) spent time talking to me about their work and its relation to Spanish history and culture—José Luis Alcaine, Pedro Almodévar,\n\nPablo G. del Amo, Vicente Aranda, Jaime de Armifian, Carmen\n\nMaura, Luis Megino, Marisa Paredes, and Carlos Saura. I also want to thank Margaret Morse, who suggested a few sources that proved to be very useful, and my students at the USC School of Cinema-Television in a wide range of courses on national cinemas (Spanish, Italian, French, Eastern European), auteurs (Bufiuel), in- | ternational film history, and theory who have listened to earlier versions of these ideas and raised many excellent questions. _ At the University of California Press, I want to thank my sponsoring editor, Ed Dimendberg, my copy editor, Sheila Berg, who helped make my text more readable, and the managing editor, Rebecca Frazier, who supervised its production, and Charles Tashiro, who did the index. Finally, I am grateful to my husband, Nicol4s Bautista, for some of the translations he did when I first started my research and for encouraging me to improve my own Spanish, thereby enabling me to say that, unless otherwise indicated, the translations from Spanish to English are my own. I also want to thank him and our son, Victor,\n\nfor accompanying me to Spain and for their patience and emotional support during the time when I was writing this book. Their presence made me feel a blood relation to Spanish cinema and culture.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nxi\n\nstent\n\nSoe\n\nce\n\nSens Seana es ‘ ae eacie\n\noe oe aoe\n\nNee ten anette\n\nSerene Sn tere Sanne\n\nVictor Erice’s El espiritu de la colmena (The Spirit of the Beehive, 1973).\n\n\"= INTRODUCTION | BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF A NATIONAL CINEMA\n\nBlood Cinema: a title that is likely to evoke Lorca’s Blood Wedding and Saura’s cinematic adaptation of that work as well as familiar images by Goya—of Saturn Devouring His Son, Duel with Cudgels, and The Third of May—and the frequent reference to them in Spanish films. And beyond these specific allusions, a national cinema that is frequently described as excessive in its graphic depiction of violence and obsessive in its treatment of incestuous relations. And beyond the cinematic context, a nation whose history is marked by\n\na fratricidal civil war with bloody repercussions, by a long period of Francoism that glamorized death, by a deep immersion in the conventions of the Counter-Reformation that fetishized the bleeding wounds of Christ and other martyrs, and by a “Black Legend” of cruelty and violence dating back to the Inquisition and the Conquest\n\nwhich Spaniards have tried to overcome for the past five hundred years. And beyond this Spanish specificity, the question of whether the cinema of any nation carries distinguishing traces of its own unique history, culture, race, or blood and the correlative issues of\n\nhow these “fictional” concepts of national identity are constructed through cinema and other forms of popular culture. Blood Cinema is not another English-language historical survey of\n\nfilmmaking in Spain. Yet it draws and depends on the existence of\n\nsuch works, especially on Peter Besas’s Behind the Spanish Lens: Spanish Cinema under Fascism and Democracy, which was one of the first, and John Hopewell’s Out of the Past: Spanish Cinema after Franco, which is probably the best.’ Though not organized strictly chronologically, Blood Cinema does have a historical trajectory, starting in Part I with a focus on the 1950s and ending in Part IV with an emphasis on the late 1980s and early 1990s but drawing examples\n\nfrom earlier periods and moving freely backward and forward throughout.\n\nNor is Blood Cinema an auteur study focusing exclusively on wellknown filmmakers like Saura, Luis Bufiuel, and Pedro Almodévar.”\n\nInstead, the films are usually chosen to illustrate broader conceptual issues, and they are drawn from the authorized Francoist cinema as\n\nwell as from the cinema of opposition and of the post-Franco period. The two chapters that do focus on selected works of single auteurs (chapter 6, on Bufiuel, and chapter 7, on José Luis Borau) present these figures as case studies for the broader issue of exile and diaspora. As a consequence, several of Spain’s most accomplished filmmakers—such\n\nas Saura, Almodévar,\n\nVictor Erice, Manuel\n\nGutiérrez\n\nAragén, Vicente Aranda, Jaime de Armifian, and Luis Garcia Berlanga—and many of their best works receive less attention than some readers might expect or desire. Nor is Blood Cinema a study of a film movement strictly within a national context, like the New Spanish Cinema, which was the focus of a special issue of Quarterly Review of Film Studies edited by Katherine S. Kovacs in spring 1983 (the first book-length work on Spanish cinema published in the United States). Yet it does stress the importance of that movement in its cultural specificity and expands it beyond its usual location in the 1960s. Drawing on the historical divisions made by Robin W. Fiddian and\n\nPeter W. Evans, I would distinguish among three phases of the New\n\nSpanish Cinema. Fiddian and Evans observe,\n\nIt is possible to perceive four clearly delimited stages in the country’s economic history between 1939 and 1982, with significant points of\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\narticulation in the years 1951, 1962, and 1973. Spain’s domestic\n\npolitical history as mapped out by the radical reorganisation of gov-\n\nernment ministries in July 1959 and July 1962, the assassination of Admiral Carrero Blanco and his replacement as Prime Minister by\n\nArias Navarro in December 1973, and the victory of Felipe Gonza-\n\nlez’s Socialists in the democratic elections of October 1982, illustrates\n\nthe same trends, as does a particularly important set of relations between the State and the Church which underwent major transformations in 1953 (when the régime signed a new Concordat with the Vatican), 1961-63 (upon the publication of two encyclicals by Pope\n\nJohn XXIID, and 1971 (when the Joint Assembly of Bishops and\n\nPriests issued a communiqué which was sternly critical of some of\n\nthe policies of the Franco régime). This sketchy outline . . . confirms\n\nthe practical value of the conventional historiographic tool of analysis-\n\nby-decade. At the same time, it draws attention . . . to certain crucial dates . . . which may be regarded as turning points in contemporary\n\nSpanish affairs . . . allowing us to perceive [the texts discussed here] as events embedded in a highly complex field of historical and cultural forces.?\n\nMapped against this historical grid, my reading of the New Spanish-Cinema dates the first phase between 1951 and 1961. Beginning\n\nwith an Italian film week in Madrid in 1951\n\n(which featured a\n\nprogram of neorealist films that strongly influenced Berlanga and Juan Antonio Bardem) and ending with Bufiuel’s return to Spain in 1961 to make Viridiana, this period includes the founding of Spanish television in 1956 and the Salamanca Congress in 1955, where\n\nSpanish filmmakers from diverse ideological backgrounds came together to reject the Francoist cinema and to demand a new kind of cinema that could address contemporary social problems in Spain and achieve international recognition abroad. The second phase occurs between 1962 and 1972, beginning with\n\nFranco’s appointment of Manuel Fraga Iribarne as the new minister of information and tourism, a position he held from 1962 to 1969\n\n(the period of apertura, or cultural opening, usually associated with\n\nthe New Spanish Cinema). One of the ways Fraga helped to accel-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nerate the liberalization of cultural production was by appointing cinephile José Maria Garcia Escudero general director of cinema, a position he had already held from September 1951 to February 1952\n\n(when he promoted the neorealist model) but from which he had\n\nbeen forced to resign. Now that Spain was moving toward greater ©\n\nintegration with Europe, he was able to accomplish more tangible\n\ngoals. He reformed government policies on censorship by making the rules more concrete; he reorganized the Instituto de Investigaciones\n\ny Experiencias Cinematograficas (where Berlanga and Bardem had studied), turning it into the influential Escuela Oficial de Cine-\n\nmatografia (EOC), which trained an entire generation of filmmakers;\n\nand he considerably expanded the government subvention system,\n\nnot only increasing the amounts of the grants but also changing the basis of selection from political issues of “National interest” to aesthetic concerns of “Special interest” so as to privilege sophisticated art films. All these measures led to the government’s active promotion |\n\nof what Garcia Escudero called the New Spanish Cinema—a movement that proved to be an effective vehicle for liberalizing Spain’s image abroad, especially through innovative, award-winning works like Berlanga’s El verdugo (The Executioner, 1964), Miguel Picazo’s\n\nLa Tia Tula (Aunt Tula, 1964), Basilio Martin Patino’s Nueve cartas a Berta (Nine Letters to Berta, 1965), Saura’s La caza (The Hunt,\n\n1965) and Peppermint frappé (1967), Bufiuel’s Tristana (1970), and\n\nArmifidn’s Mi querida senorita (My Dearest Lady, 1971).\n\nBut in 1969, this period of liberalization was seriously by the Matesa scandal, which intensified Spain’s economic led to the firing of Fraga. Hopewell (1986:80) reports, August 1969 the government admitted that credits\n\ndisrupted crisis and “On 10 of about\n\nL8o0 million granted to the textile firm, Matesa, for the export of\n\nmachinery had in fact been used for private investment abroad. Fraga\n\nwas slightly too keen to publish the involvement of three Opus Dei\n\nCabinet Ministers in the affair. Franco sacked him.” Fraga was replaced by the extremely reactionary Alfredo Sanchez Bella, who held the post from October 1969 to June 1973. While he was in\n\noffice, rigorous censorship was restored and government subventions\n\n4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nto filmmakers were severely cut. As Hopewell notes, these cuts were _ particularly devastating since they occurred precisely when the Spanish film industry was just beginning to experience serious competition from television. The sixties ended with a political and economic crisis that went far beyond the Matesa affair. As Fiddian and Evans observe, “Divisive debates about the legalising of political associations took place between 1967 and 1969 against a backcloth of severe economic difficulties, open rebellion by the student population in April 1968, and a state of emergency imposed in January 1969’’—conflicts that structure works like Saura’s Stress es tres, tres (Stress Is Three, Three,\n\n1968) and Elias Querejeta’s anthology film, Los desafios (The Chal-\n\nlenges, 1969).\n\n|\n\nThe third phase of the New Spanish Cinema occurs between 1973 and 1982 and moves into the post-Franco period. Although by this time many Spaniards perceived the New Spanish Cinema to be over, it was now becoming more widely recognized internationally. Beginning with the assassination of Franco’s anointed right-wing successor Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco by Basque terrorists in 1973,\n\nwhich assured that Spain’s move toward liberalization would continue after Franco’s death in 1975, this period of “soft dictatorship”\n\n(or dictablanda) includes courageous, ground-breaking films, many\n\nof which obtained critical acclaim and distribution abroad, such as\n\nErice’s El espiritu de la colmena (Spirit of the Beehive) and Saura’s La prima Angélica (Cousin Angélica) in 1973, Armifidn’s El amor del Capitén Brando (The Love of Captain Brando) in 1974, and Borau’s Furtivos (Poachers) and Saura’s Cria cuervos (Raise Ravens) in 1975.\n\nIt also includes blatantly subversive films from the period of tran-\n\nsition that immediately followed Franco’s death, such as Jaime Chavarri’s El desencanto (Disenchantment,\n\n1976), and A un dios\n\ndesconocido (To an Unknown God, 1977); Vicente Aranda’s Cambio\n\nde sexo (Sex Change), José Luis Garci’s Asignatura pendiente (Pending Exam), and Gutiérrez Aragén’s Camada negra (Black Brood), also in 1977; Saura’s Los ojos vendados (Blindfolded Eyes), José Juan Bigas\n\nLuna’s Bilbao, and Eloy de la Iglesia’s El diputado (The Deputy) in 1978; and Pilar Miré’s El crimen de Cuenca (The Crime of Cuenca)\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nin 1979. The terrorist bombing of theaters that were playing Camada negra and the temporary banning of E/ crimen de Cuenca because of its attack against the Guardia Civil clearly demonstrated that political censorship was still operative during the transition. As soon as the Socialists were voted into power in 1982, they appointed the con-\n\ntroversial Miré as general director of cinema, dramatically demonstrating that censorship was long gone and that a new era was beginning both in politics and cinema. One dimension of this change in the 1980s was the acceleration of Spain’s integration into the European community and into the emerging configurations of global mass media. This acceleration was at least a contributing factor to Spain winning its first Oscar (significantly in 1983) for the earnest, yet sentimental Volver a empezar (To Begin Again, 1982), and to the\n\nstunning international success (even in the daunting North American market) of Saura’s dance trilogy and of Almoddévar’s outrageous comic melodramas. Blood Cinema emphasizes the international dimensions of the New Spanish Cinema. Like Homi Bhabha’s Nation and Narration, it traces a movement “from the problematic unity of the nation to the articulation of cultural difference in the construction of an international perspective.” It assumes that every national film movement seeks to win legitimation as the “valid” representative of its culture by striving for international recognition—the way revolutionary gov-. ernments seek to be recognized by other nations. Virtually all film movements attack the dominant cinema within their own nation as nonrepresentative and unrealistic or as too reflective of foreign influences, yet ironically they themselves usually turn to other marginal\n\ncinemas within a foreign context for conventions to be adapted to their own cultural specificity. This was true of Italian neorealism, which turned to French poetic realism. It was true of the French nouvelle vague, which turned to Hollywood B movies and to outsiders like Rossellini and Lang. And in the 1950s—that first phase of the New Spanish Cinema—it was true of Spanish filmmakers like Bar-\n\ndem and Berlanga, who dialogized the neorealist aesthetic against the conventions of Hollywood melodrama. And at the end of the decade,\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nit was also true of Saura, who tried to signal the break from Bardem and Berlanga and the move toward a second phase by claiming the exiled Bufiuel and the French new wave as his models instead of neorealism. And at the beginning of the third phase, it was also true of Erice and Armifidn, who dramatized very concretely in El espiritu de la colmenaand El amor del Capitan Brando how Hollywood films and stars were culturally reinscribed by Spanish spectators living under Francoist repression.\n\nIn contrast to the New Spanish Cinema, most of the European film movements that emerged during the post-World War II era, whether in Western or Eastern Europe, were struggling to demonstrate their independence, not only from the dominant cinema at home but also from the hegemonic power (either the U.S. or the USSR) in whose sphere they were placed by the Yalta treaty. Simultaneously in the international sphere, they also tried to distinguish their own national culture from those other countries in a similar position (e.g., Czechs as opposed to Poles or Hungarians and French as opposed to Italians or West Germans). But since Spain had stayed out of the war and was locked in hermetic isolation under the Francoist regime, the New Spanish Cinema could turn to the cultural productions of any other nation as a means of escaping the Francoist hegemony. Within all these national contexts, critics, historians, and participants frequently argued over whether it was really a coherent movement, that is, one with shared goals and aesthetic principles. But this essentialist argument is not really an important issue. What is more significant was the break from the dominant cinema within the nation and the international acknowledgment of that functional difference. Using Spain as a case study, this book seeks to explore and\n\nproblematize the concept of a national cinema, claiming that it must\n\nbe read against the local/global interface, which has become increas-\n\ningly important in the new world order of the 1980s and 1990s. This\n\ninterface operates in every national cinema, primarily because the film\n\nmedium has always been an important vehicle for constructing images of a unified national identity out of regional and ethnic\n\ndiversity and for transmitting them both within and beyond its\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nnational borders and also because from its inception, the history of cinema has always involved a fierce international competition for\n\nworld markets. This competition has been intensified at certain key historical moments—the coming of sound at the end of the 1920s,\n\nthe restructuring of the world order at the end of World War II, the globalization of mass culture in the post—cold war era of the late 1980s and early 1990s—moments that will be stressed in this study. I have chosen Spain for my case study primarily because, despite the richness of its film history and its success at international festivals, with very few exceptions, Spanish cinema is largely unknown or ignored in the English-speaking world. In fact, it is virtually omitted from most of the currently popular English-language one-volume texts of world film history, which necessarily depend on the primary research of others.” This dearth of critical and scholarly attention is obviously linked to material conditions of distribution. Except for the works of Bufiuel, Saura, and Almodévar, few Spanish films have been\n\n_ widely distributed in the United States, or, for that matter, anywhere\n\nelse outside of Spain. Thus, as a North American scholar trying to help demarginalize Spanish cinema, my own work (like that of Besas, Hopewell, Virginia Higginbotham, Kovacs, and D’Lugo) is immediately absorbed as part of the government-sponsored culture industry—a dynamic that Thomas Elsaesser has brilliantly analyzed in the context of Germany.° His analysis is also applicable to Spain, where the Socialist\n\n\\ Ministry of Culture has been active in financially supporting the promotion of its cinema and auteurs for world consumption—a tradition that was also operative under Garcia Escudero. As Christian Metz observes in The Imaginary Signifier, the film historian frequently finds herself becoming an intellectual publicist for the texts she describes: “Often, by unexpected paths, unperceived by those who have quite unintentionally taken them, . . . writings on film\n\nbecome another form of cinema advertising and at the same time a linguistic appendage of the institution itself.”” I cannot deny this\n\ndimension of my own work; in fact, far from being “unperceived,” I hope to demonstrate that it is part of the process being described—\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe reconstruction of national identity through the production, promotion, and reception of popular culture. In working toward the demarginalization of Spanish cinema, | choose not to focus exclusively on industrial history or the distri~ bution of Spanish films in foreign markets (in order, for example, to\n\nupdate and globalize Santiago Pozo’s valuable 1984 study, La industria del cine en Espana: Legislacién y aspectos econémicos, 1896— 1970) but rather to apply many of the theoretical concepts that have been developed over the past twenty years in film studies, concepts that are not present in the historical surveys by Besas, Hopewell, and Higginbotham but that inform the writings of scholars like Marvin D’Lugo, Kathleen M. Vernon, Robin Fiddian, Peter Evans, Victor\n\nFuentes, and Roman Gubern. In this sense, Blood Cinema takes a\n\ntranscultural approach, which leads me to the second reason for\n\nfocusing on Spain. I am\n\nconvinced,\n\nand\n\nI hope\n\nto convince\n\nmy\n\nreaders, that a\n\nknowledge of Spanish cinema alters and enriches one’s understanding of world cinema.* I have been convinced not by Spanish film scholars focusing exclusively on the national context but by three works that have nothing to do with Spain: Noel Burch’s To the Distant Observer: Form and Meaning in Japanese Cinema, which demonstrates that an intensive focus on certain issues within a single national context can substantially alter the way one conceptualizes the history of world cinema and its reception; Elsaesser’s New German Cinema: A History, which shows how film can be used as a means of ideological reinscription both by filmmakers struggling against a dual hegemony in domestic and international markets and by the government that hopes to change the international image of the nation; and Kay Schafter’s Women and the Bush: Forces of Desire in the Australian Cultural Tradition, which illustrates how “master narratives” like the Oedipal plot can be inflected by a specific cultural context and a particular national imaginary. Like those three works, Blood Cinema\n\nseeks to decenter a national cinema by reading it in relation to several other cultures both within and beyond its own national borders, both\n\nin the regional and global contexts.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nFor this reason, my book addresses at least two different audi-\n\nences—those who already know Spanish culture and Spanish film history but who are unfamiliar with English-language film studies and those who already know film studies and culture theory but who\n\nare basically unfamiliar with Spanish history, culture, and cinema. For the former, my goal is to demonstrate that theoretical approaches currently being used in English-language film studies can lead to new and valuable readings of Spanish texts both in their local and global contexts and that an “outsider” can sometimes perceive patterns that are less visible to those inside the culture. Since I am the only non-\n\nHispanist (at least, the only scholar based in a film school rather than a Spanish department) who is currently writing on Spanish cinema, I hope to turn this factor (which many might see as a limitation) into an advantage. For the latter, I seek to demonstrate that a knowledge of Spanish cinema is as essential to those in film studies as a knowledge of French, Italian, German, or any other national cinema.\n\nIn this way, I am trying to bridge the gap between two quite different kinds of discourse with very different assumptions, which leads to certain difficulties concerning accessibility and the choice of language, methodology, and texts. For those unfamiliar with Englishlanguage film studies, I have tended to quote at length from theoretical sources and to include definitions and explanations of key assumptions that would probably be unnecessary for other readers. The greater difficulty arises with those unfamiliar with Spanish cinema and culture, for I am writing about films that few of these readers have seen. Although the main lines of my argument are based on the viewing of hundreds of Spanish films, I have purposely avoided long lists of unfamiliar titles, brief plot summaries, and superficial critiques. Rather, I have chosen to develop my argument through the close\n\ntextual analysis of a relatively small body of films, the analysis of\n\nwhich should be clear even to readers who have not seen them, especially when supplemented by many still photographs as illustrations. In addition to those works described in great detail, I keep\n\n10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nreturning to another group of key texts—including, for example, La\n\naldea maldita (The Cursed Village, 1929), Raza (Race, 1941), and Marcelino, pan y vino (Marcelino, Bread and Wine, 1954)—so that\n\nI can provide the plot summary and basic description once and then frequently refer to the film without repeating that information. Because of my focus on the local/global interface, I have tended to choose films that have been seen outside of Spain, that have won recognition at international festivals, or that have played a significant role within the film history of the nation or region. Despite all these strategies, the problem posed by the readers’ unfamiliarity with the films still remains. Thus, I arrived at a solution that draws on the current state of interactive technology and that is particularly well suited to this project. Blood Cinema is accompanied by aCD-—ROM (specially produced for this purpose), which contains brief excerpts from fifteen of the films being discussed, with commentaries that address my dual audiences. I am unaware of any other book in film studies that uses a companion CD-ROM in this way. The book is organized around four basic issues that problematize the notion of a national cinema: transcultural reinscription, cultural specificity in the representation of violence and in the Oedipal master narrative, exile and diaspora, and micro- and macroregionalism. While all four of these issues can be applied to most cultural contexts, they are particularly central in Spain. Part I, Transcultural Reinscription, is concerned with the ideo-\n\nlogical reinscription of conventions that are borrowed from other cultures and set in conflict with each other, a process of hybridization that is capable of carving out a new aesthetic language. More spe- \\ cifically, this section focuses on the 1950s, that crucial period when\n\nFrancoist Spain began to emerge from its hermetic isolation and to become allied with the West and when Spanish films began to be seen and to win prizes at international festivals. Drawing on the writings of Mikhail Bakhtin, Ernesto Laclau, and Stanley Payne, these chapters explore how Spanish filmmakers, both on the Right and the Left, used a dialectic interplay between conventions borrowed from Italian\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfi\n\nneorealism and Hollywood classical cinema to structure their own films and to develop a new language that would help characterize the New Spanish Cinema. This process is traced in considerable detail through four of the most influential films from the first phase of that movement: Surcos (Furrows, 1950), Muerte de un ciclista (Death of\n\na Cyclist, 1955), Los golfos (Hooligans, 1959), and El cochecito (The\n\nLittle Wheelchair, 1960). Then it moves ahead to the third phase, to see how transcultural reinscription of similar conventions func-\n\ntions in Erice’s internationally acclaimed film, E/ espiritu de la col-\n\nmena (1973).\n\nPart II, Blood Cinema: The Representation of Violence in the Spanish Oedipal Narrative, explores the cultural specificity of violence and of the Oedipal narrative within which it is frequently dramatized—two forms of representation that, in any given moment of history, are capable both of reproducing and challenging the dominant social order. This section traces these cultural inflections in Spanish cinema from the 1940s to the present but emphasizes the post-Franco period. Drawing primarily on René Girard’s Violence and the Sacred and Tzvetan Todorov’s The Conquest of America: The Question of the Other but also on the images of Goya and the writings of Sade, Bataille, Deleuze, Unamuno, Ortega y Gasset, and Gubern, chapter 4 argues that one of the distinguishing characteristics of the representation of violence in Spanish cinema is the interplay between primitive sacrifice and modern massacre. While this duality was glossed over by the unifying ideology of the official Francoist cinema, the filmmakers of the opposition explored Spain’s paradoxical role as a dual signifier of Europe’s barbaric past and dehumanized future.\n\nThis duality is traced, first, briefly through two Francoist epics of the 19408, Raza (1941) and Los ultimos de Filipinas (Last Stand in the\n\nPhilippines, 1945); then, with increasing elaboration through four productions from the oppositional cinema of the 1960s, Llanto por un bandido (Lament for a Bandit, 1963), La caza (1965), Peppermint frappé (1967), and Los desafios (1969); and finally, through a detailed comparative analysis of the two most excessive and threatening ex-\n\n12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\namples of violence from the post-Franco period, Pascual Duarte (1975) and Tras el cristal (Behind the Glass, 1986).\n\nChapter 5 examines the way Oedipal conflicts within the family were used to speak about political issues and historical events that were repressed from filmic representation during the Francoist era\n\nand the way they continue to be used with even greater flamboyance _ in the post-Franco period after censorship and repression were abol-\n\nished. Drawing on Spanish literature century novels by Benito Pérez Galdés paintings (especially by José de Ribera and as film, it describes the specific cultural\n\n(particularly nineteenthand Leopoldo Alas) and Francisco de Goya) as well inflection of that master\n\nnarrative, demonstrating how this Spanish version leads us to new\n\nreadings of the original myth. Then it traces these patterns through\n\na diverse range of filmmakers,\n\ngenres, periods,\n\nand\n\ntones, from\n\nFlorian Rey’s silent classic, La aldea maldita (1929), to recent romantic melodramas like Aranda’s Amantes (Lovers, 1990) and Almodévar’s ;Atame! (Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down! 1989) and Tacones lejanos (High Heels, 1991). The chapter concludes with a detailed reading of Bigas Luna’s notorious Bilbao (1978), as one of the most\n\nextreme and illuminating examples of the Spanish Oedipal narrative in post-Franco cinema, comparing it with other related texts either from the same year (Armifian’s Al servicio de la mujer espanola | At the Service of Spanish Womanhood]) or from earlier decades (Saura’s\n\nPeppermint frappé, 1967, and Bufiuel’s E/ [This Strange Passion],\n\n1955).\n\nPart III, Exile and Diaspora, examines the ways in which the idealized cultural unity of any nation is challenged and ideologically reinscribed by the exile and émigré. After briefly sketching how the theme of exile has been represented in Spanish cinema and citing a number of examples of different kinds of exile within the Spanish context (including both Spaniards who left and foreigners who emigrated to Spain), this section focuses on two case studies. Chapter\n\n6 deals with the unique case of Bufiuel, who during his three quite different periods of exile became widely perceived (however errone-\n\nously) as the single embodiment not only of an international his-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\ntorical movement like surrealist filmmaking but also of two national cinemas—the Mexican and the Spanish. Chapter 7 describes the voluntary aesthetic exile of Borau, which was represented in his choice of Spanish film projects and aesthetic style as well as in his critical and scholarly writing and which was pursued through international coproductions that culminated in Réo abajo, the film that turned his dream of working in Hollywood into a nightmare. Part IV, Micro- and Macroregionalism, argues that regionalism is an ideological construct like nationality which refers to areas both smaller and larger than a nation. Functioning co-dependently, the terms “microregionalism” and “macroregionalism” fluidly shift meaning according to context and thereby serve as an effective means both of asserting the subversive force of any marginal position and of destabilizing the hegemonic power of any center. Once regional structures and the center are seen as sliding signifiers, then there is\n\na movement toward the proliferation and empowerment of new structural units both at the micro and macro level. This cluster of issues is explored first in the context of European television, arguing that Spain provides a particularly effective model for the local/global nexus and for the refiguration of cinema and nations. Then it turns to cinema, showing how this regional/national/global interface was addressed, first, in the regional cinema of Catalufia, particularly in\n\na sophisticated Catalan film from the 1940s, Vida en sombras (Life in Shadows, 1947-48), then in recent European coproductions like El suefio del mono loco (Dream of the Mad Monkey, 1989) and Boom boom (1990), and finally, in films (whether made in Madrid, Bar-\n\ncelona, or the Basque region) that reinscribe the “marginal” as the center—a dynamic that is particularly strong in the international\n\nsuccess of Almodévar and Erice.\n\n|\n\nHaving been completed in 1992, Blood Cinema assumes that the\n\npresent moment demands a global perspective on Spain, as has been\n\ndramatized by the events designed to celebrate the 500-year anniversary of Columbus’s voyage: the world exposition in Seville, the Olympic Games in Barcelona, and the “rediscovery” of a new “Europe without borders,” in which Spain is at last recast in a starring\n\nrole. This perspective was also partially responsible for the selection\n\n14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nof Madrid as the site for the important October 1991 opening of the\n\ninternational peace talks on the Middle East (with Bush and Gorbachev in attendance), as Spain had once expelled both the Moslems and the Jews from its “holy land” but now had been peacefully converted into a reasonable modern nation fully committed to global diplomacy. From our post—cold war perspective, we can now look back and realize that just as the Spanish Civil War was the dress rehearsal for the ideological conflicts of World War II, which originally put the cold war into place, Spain’s miraculously rapid and bloodless transition from Francoism to democracy also prefigured the other miraculous transitions that were soon to erupt throughout Eastern Europe. One could even argue that Spain’s conversion to democracy was one of the first steps in constructing the new world order of the 1990s, a reconfiguration that is bound to have a dramatic impact on mass media around the globe and to seriously challenge the concept of blood cinema. Lest this sound too utopian, one must remember that 1992 is also the hundred year anniversary of the birth of Franco, who, after\n\nseventeen years of dormancy, is beginning to arouse new interest in\n\nSpain, especially in the wake of recent economic crises and a resurgence of xenophobic racist attacks on foreign emigres, particularly from North Africa. These dynamics are part of the wave of post—cold war nationalism now sweeping Europe, with its disturbing calls for ethnic cleansing and its threats of proliferating civil wars that have already devastated what was once Yugoslavia. This new nationalism threatens to undermine the recent moves toward European unity and global democracy—a conflict that will undoubtedly be played out in the new configurations of regional, national, and global mass media and that may give new resonance to the phrase, blood cinema.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nPyne i sees me otitateneeesctenetet\n\nss\n\ni eens eee\n\n“i se\n\nSR\n\nSa sRenseuteonnes\n\noe\n\nea\n\n:\n\nERR\n\nee\n\nSS\n\nSES\n\nps\n\noe Z\n\nEN\n\n“ee aces Seeenecannes\n\nStee\n\nSe ee ena a\n\noe Suen\n\nSe\n\nSects on Reon\n\nSerenasee ee\n\nThe image from V i ttorio DeSica ’s Ladri di\n\n(B icycle Th\n\n.\n\nie\n\nf ciclette\n\nf, 1948) that\n\nappears in Basilio Martin Pat\n\n.\n\nino\n\n's Canciones para\n\ndespu és de una guerra (Songs for after a Wa r, 1971)\n\n.\n\nBLOOD CINEMA TRANSCULTURAL REINSCRIPTION\n\n=\n\n1\n\n=\n\nTHE IDEOLOGICAL REINSCRIPTION OF NEOREALIST AND HOLLYWOOD CONVENTIONS IN SPANISH CINEMA OF THE 1950S FALANGIST NEOREALISM IN SURCOS\n\nIn Canciones para después de una guerra (Songs for after a War, 1971), a subversive compilation film on the construction of popular memory in postwar Spain, Patino includes the scene from Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thief, 1948) in which the father is hanging a poster featuring Rita Hayworth in Gilda—a glamorous image that distracts both the worker and the movie spectator from the contemporary Italian street scene where his bicycle is soon to be stolen. The choice of film is hardly surprising; Bicycle Thiefwas one of the first neorealist films shown in Madrid in 1951 during that historic Italian film week that\n\nwas to prove so influential for filmmakers Bardem and Berlanga and that was to help launch the first phase of the New Spanish Cinema in the 1950s.\"\n\nIt is the choice of scene that is particularly telling. Not only does it contrast the neorealist attempt to document and analyze the\n\nimmediate socioeconomic realities of the working class with Hol-\n\nlywood’s lucrative escape into the pleasurable excesses of spectacle, melodrama, and stardom but this international postwar opposition is shown to be analogous to that familiar Spanish contrast between\n\nrealistic depiction and false idealization that can be traced back to Golden Age writers like Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Calderén de la\n\nBarca, and Quevedo and that was particularly vivid in Francoist Spain in the aftermath of both the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Canciones repeatedly underlines this contrast by cutting from authentic documentary footage, photos, and newspaper clippings of harsh realities in the 1940s to escapist images from newspaper ads,\n\nTV commercials, historical epics, folkloric melodramas, and comedies of the same period.”\n\nPatino’s use of this excerpt from Bicycle Thief is emblematic of how the opposing conventions of Italian neorealism and Hollywood were perceived by Spaniards as a choice of how to represent Spain as it emerged from its hermetic isolation after World War II. Historian Raymond Carr observes,\n\nThe difficulties of the regime in imposing its “culture” and the consequences of its failure to do so are nowhere more apparent than in the cinema. With more cinema seats per capita than any other European country, the Spain of the 4os and 50s was a nation of cinema addicts. A financially weak and artistically impoverished local industry could not produce enough films embodying the puritanical, “he-\n\nroic’” ethos of the regime to satisfy demand. Imported American and Italian films, though mutilated out of recognition by the censorship, were carriers of values incompatible with those of the regime.°\n\nBecause of their popular appeal and despite their ideological differences, both the Hollywood and neorealist models could be used to challenge the regime’s monolithic hold over Spanish culture, especially when they were set in dialectic opposition to each other. By ideology, I do not mean merely a set of beliefs consciously held\n\nand promoted by those in power. Rather, I am using the term in the Althusserian sense, that is, as a system of representations\n\n(ideas,\n\nimages, and actions) through which persons experience the material conditions of existence in which they find themselves. Since ideology\n\nin this sense functions at the level of structures rather than at the level\n\nof consciously held opinions, it is largely unconscious and is transmitted, perpetuated, and naturalized primarily through nonrepres-\n\nsive ideological state apparatuses (such as popular culture, art, lit-\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n19\n\nerature, education, religion, and the family) and their respective discursive practices.* Even within a hermetically sealed culture such as Francoist Spain, the dominant ideology could never be totally monolithic; its hegemony was always being contested and negotiated by conflicting historical forces and by alternative ideologies. In the context of the 1950s, both neorealism and Hollywood provided\n\nSpanish filmmakers with such alternative ideologies. The ideological implications of these two foreign aesthetics were never fixed; the meanings of their discursive practices were surprisingly fluid and even contradictory, partly because they were always contingent on what they were being used to oppose within the Spanish context. — If Spanish filmmakers chose Hollywood as a cinematic model, they faced several risks that were dramatized in the figure of Rita Hayworth: moral corruption (“screens showing Rita Hayworth were pelted with ink bottles by Falangists as a protest against the exhibition ofa corroding libertarianism”); the loss of their own cultural identity\n\n(most Spanish spectators knew that this daughter of a famous Andalusian dancer was Anglicized by Hollywood once she became a star);° and the exploitation of Spanish folklore as commercial spectacle for foreign viewers. Diego Galan observes,\n\nIn 1951 ... the Ministry of Information and Tourism was created for a double purpose: on the one hand, to control the expressions of increasing opposition to the regime which could even be found\n\namong a good part of the people who contributed to Franco’s victory in the civil war, and on the other hand, to offer foreign countries a\n\nmore open view of Spanish life in order to attract economic aid and tourists. It was an insurmountable contradiction that had a clear re-\n\npercussion on the world of Spanish cinema which was then directly dependent on that ministry.’\n\nThis contradiction was brilliantly satirized by Berlanga and Bar-\n\ndem in ;Bienvenido, Mr. Marshall! (Welcome, Mr. Marshall!, 1952), in which an entire Castilian village dresses up as Andalusians, complete with fake movie sets, to compete with other poor villages in\n\n20\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nEven the promotional matenials for j;Bienvenido, Mr.\n\nMarshall! emphasized the political-economic context and demonstrated the two-way process of cultural reinscription.\n\nii\n\nene cc\n\ndias\n\nchalet KOO er\n\nSota uate ena i.\n\n~\n\n¥\n\n:\n\n..\n\nae\n\n“5\n\n:\n\nPES\n\nae\n\n‘e\"\n\nsee\n\nCake\n\nSASS\n\nae ns\n\neera\n\n3\n\nre\n\nSiS\n\nee\n\nor\n\na Pi\n\ngetting their share of the Marshall Plan. In trying to fulfill both their neorealist needs and their Hollywood-imprinted dreams, the Spanish\n\nvillagers end up deeper in debt. Their reliance on false facades evokes the well-known historic incident, where Mussolini used cardboard | sets to impress Hitler and his entourage when they were visiting Italy, implying some connection between the Fascist and Hollywood approach to spectacle and mise-en-scéne. Moreover, the colonizing dimension of the substitution of Andalusia for Spain is multitiered and ancient and has an etymological base. Appearing on bilingual | coins as early as 716, the term “Al-Andalus” was the Arab translation\n\nof Spania, the Latin word for Spain. Bienvenido parodies the espafiolada, the popular Spanish film genre that creates a distorted image of an exotic Andalusian Spain because it is so marketable abroad.\n\nAccording to Spanish film historian Roman Gubern,\n\nThe espafiolada . . . originated in France, born during the period of\n\nRomanticism with such works as Carmen (1845), by Mérimée, which\n\ncultivated the exotic nature and the local color of an underdeveloped part of southern Europe. . . . Spanish film-makers willingly accepted this colonization and exaltation of .. . an agrarian and underdeveloped Spain dominated by religious superstitions, the Spain known\n\nfor large and feudal landed estates, hunger, the cult of masculinity and for bullfighters. This stereotyped and generally reactionary genre, the pride of the pre-modern Spain, . . . was continuously employed\n\nby our directors during the silent era, [and] after the advent of sound\n\nmotion pictures.®\n\nBienvenido underscores the irony that the Francoist regime was now exploiting this reactionary portrait of Spain to capitalize its modernization.\n\n|\n\nThe satire also revealed the connection between the Marshall Plan and the Hollywood domination of European film markets, which proved to be a significant factor in the demise of the neorealist movement in Italy. In Passion and Defiance: Film in Italy from 1942 to the Present, Mira Liehm observes, “By 1949, the Italian film\n\n22\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nstlSeattette ees\n\nee “\n\nIn Luis Gare fa Berlanga s i ienven ido, Mr r.

In 1949, Italy joined the NATO alliance, and a few months later the Vatican excommunicated Communist voters and their sympathizers. Peter Bondanella claims, “As a result, films with strong social statements became increasingly risky investments, since government subsidies might be withdrawn from a work that was deemed unacceptable.”*° That same year, DeGasperi’s government also passed the Andreotti Law, named after his undersecretary of public entertainment. Though the law was designed primarily to protect the Italian film industry against American imports, it also enabled the government to censor Italian films that showed their country in a negative light. This charge was leveled most vociferously against Vittorio DeSica and Cesare Zavattini’s Umberto D (1952), which proved to be the last of the undisputed neorealist “classics.” , Although Spain was not included in the Marshall Plan and not yet a member of the NATO alliance, the United States still posed a similar threat to its film markets, since Hollywood was the primary supplier of foreign films in this decade (as well as throughout most of Spain’s history). Though the number of Italian films authorized for exhibition in Spain rose sharply both after the Italian film week in 1951 and the Salamanca Congress in 1955, it in no way compared\n\nwith the large number of films coming from Hollywood. (See table I :) 11\n\n.\n\n|\n\nParadoxically, while Franco courted American investment and favored the promotion of genres (such as historical spectacle and melodrama) that were also popular in Hollywood, he and his censors realized the subversive potential of American culture.

That is why one hegemony could be\n\nso successfully played off against the other, as was demonstrated in the double-edged satire of Bienvenido. Although it was Spain’s official entry at Cannes, the film attacked not only the imperialist goals of America’s Marshall Plan but also Francoist policy with its denial of Spanish socioeconomic realities and its ineptness in negotiating with the United States.'*\n\n|\n\nIn contrast to Hollywood, Italian neorealism appeared in the 1950s to be a more politically effective model for challenging the escapist cinema of the Francoist regime, one that could appeal both to the Left and the Right. Hopewell observes,\n\nNeo-realism attracted supporters right across the political spectrum of Spanish cinema. It was the perfect rallying call for a reconciliatory\n\npolicy. Its origins in the aftermath of Italian fascism allowed mili-\n\ntants to exploit the international belief that Spaniards, through their cinema, were fighting fascism in Spain.'°\n\nThis position was strongly advocated by Odjetivo, a left-wing film\n\njournal that was founded in May 1953 by Bardem, writer-producer\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n25\n\nRicardo Mufioz Suay, Marxist philosopher Paulino Garagorri, and Eduardo Ducay (who later produced Bufiuel’s Tristana). Assessing\n\nObjetivo’s influence on Spanish film culture, Spanish critic José Luis\n\nGuarner wrote,\n\nIt fully immersed itself into the “realist” current of Italian neorealism—-whose deep imprint on this generation has already been pointed out. ... For example, the first number included 18 pages dedicated to Cesare Zavattini. Faithful to the principles of Cinema Nuovo, Objetive exalted the auteurs defended by Aristarco (Visconti) and rejected those dismissed by him (Rossellini), it attacked the\n\nAmerican cinema of Hollywood in order to defend the independent Yankee productions of the social or testimonial type.'*\n\nOne of the last issues of Odjetivo included a long article entitled\n\n“Neorealismo: 1955” which covered the latest Italian imports (all released in 1955): Federico Fellini’s // bidone (The Swindle), Mich-\n\nelangelo Antonioni’s Le amiche (The Girlfriends), Francesco Maselli’s Gli sbandati (The Runaways), Francesco Rosi’s Amici per la pelle (Friends for Life), and Mario Soldati’s La donna del fiume (The\n\nWoman of the River). By 1955, neorealism may have been nearly\n\ndead in Italy, yet this article shows the movement was still very alive as an influence in Spain—particularly as it broadened to include bourgeois protagonists and as its melodramatic elements became more blatant (as in the case of Le amiche).'° Although neorealism was\n\nrooted in a subversive melodrama like Luchino Visconti’s Ossessione (Obsession), and although its greatest commercial successes—Rob-\n\nerto Rossellini’s Roma citta aperta (Open City) and Paisé, DeSica’s\n\nBicycle Thief, Pietro Germi’s La nome della legge (In the Name of the\n\nLaw), and Giuseppe DeSantis’s Riso amaro (Bitter Rice)—all had\n\nstrong melodramatic elements in plot, music, mise-en-scéne, and\n\nmorality, what had seemed so “new” to critics and spectators were the realistic deviations from conventional melodrama. One of the primary achievements of Objetivo was its role in helping\n\nto organize and document the First National Film Congress at\n\n26\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nSalamanca in May 1955, an event that helped to establish neorealism as the primary aesthetic model for the first phase of the New Spanish Cinema. As a result of its participation, the journal was suppressed\n\nby the government.\n\nAlthough this four-day congress was partly funded by the gov- © ernment’s own liberal Ministry of Education, it was organized primarily by leftists (not only by the editors of Odbjetivo but also by\n\nPatino, who then ran the University Cine Club of Salamanca). Yet the participants at the Salamanca Congress represented the full ideological spectrum, including members of the PCE (the Spanish Communist party) on the extreme Left and of the Falange (the Spanish Fascist party) on the extreme Right. All political sides were united in a sweeping condemnation of Francoist cinema, which was most powerfully expressed by Bardem in his frequently quoted statement, “After 60 years of films, Spanish cinema is politically ineffective, socially false, intellectually worthless, aesthetically nonexistent, and industrially crippled.”?° Most participants still conceptualized a new Spanish cinema almost totally in centralized national terms. They focused on the\n\nregime’s ambiguous censorship practices, demanding greater clarification of what filmmakers could and could not do without really questioning whether the government should have the right to impose such regulations in the first place. For example, in Bardem’s closing speech at the congress, he proclaimed, We need new laws for our film industry: we need new forms of protection which will not isolate us from our roots: the public. We need\n\na different position for film in relation to the state: Let the state not view Us as an enemy, nor restrain us, nor asphyxiate us. We need censorship to show us its face, to show us the way out of this labyrinth, to codify its taboos.'”\n\nWhen Bardem turned to a positive description of what a progressive Spanish cinema might be, he clearly had neorealism in mind:\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF NEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n27\n\nSpanish cinema lives in a state of isolation. It is isolated not only from the world, but from our own reality. While the cinemas of all countries concentrate their interests on the problems that arise from everyday life, .. . Spanish cinema continues to be a cinema of painted dolls. The problem of Spanish cinema is that it has no problems, that it does not bear testimony to our time such as our time demands of all human creation.?°\n\nNeorealism seemed to provide an effective vehicle for critiquing Franco’s false picture of Spain within the national context as well as _ an ideal means for overcoming Spain’s isolation by expressing its unique cultural identity abroad. In fact, Bardem had come to the\n\nSalamanca Congress directly from the Cannes Film Festival where he\n\nhad served on the jury and had won the International Critics Prize for his own film Muerte de un ciclista (1955), which used neorealist\n\nconventions to rupture a glossy Hollywood-type melodrama and to expose its ideological implications. The recognition he achieved at Cannes protected his film against Spanish censors and gave his statements at Salamanca unique authority. Shortly after leaving the meetings at Salamanca, Bardem began\n\nwriting Calle mayor (Main Street, 1956), a neorealist melodrama that\n\nwould win the Critics Prize at the Venice Film Festival the following year. In many ways reminiscent of Fellini’s J vitelloni (1953) and with a Moraldo-type character named Federico as narrator, this hybrid\n\nfilm about Spanish provincial life contains the following conversation between its handsome protagonist and its victimized spinster.\n\nIsabel:\n\nI love movies, especially American ones.\n\nJuan:\n\nBecause the heroes are more handsome?\n\nIsabel: | No, because the houses are so white and clean. Have you noticed how clean and sparkling the kitchens are? | Juan: My friend Federico would say American movies are all lies, absolutely false. Isabel: It may be so, but it’s a pretty lie.\n\n28\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nThe film’s ironic stance as hybrid is enhanced by its casting, for Isabel is played by American actress Betsy Blair, who was highly regarded in Spain for her realistic performance the previous year in Delbert Mann’s Marty (one of those “Yankee” independent films praised by Objetivo) and subsequently in Antonioni’s // grido (The Cry, 1957).\n\nIf Spanish filmmakers followed the lead of Odjetivo and the Salamanca Congress and chose neorealism instead of Hollywood as their primary model, those conventions could readily be adapted to Spain’s immediate cultural specificity, as the model’s importability to many Third World nations would demonstrate throughout the 1950s. Yet what was unique to Spain was how radically those neorealist conventions could be ideologically reinscribed, not only by leftists like Bardem and Patino but also by participants at Salamanca with right-wing backgrounds.\n\nOne of those participants was José Antonio Nieves Conde, director of Surcos (1951), which is generally considered the first important neorealist film made in Spain, for it shocked moviegoers with the first glimpse of Spanish poverty and slums, images that had been suppressed from the screen. Politically, Nieves Conde had formerly been\n\nan hedillista, a supporter of Manuel Hedilla, the extremist leader of the Falange whose protest against Franco’s forced unification of all right-wing parties eventually led to his imprisonment. The screenwriters of Surcos, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester and Natividad Zaro, were also former Falangists. Another key right-wing participant at the Salamanca Congress was Garcia Escudero, a reformist Catholic of Falangist origin who was the government’s moderate general director of cinema from September 1951 to February 1952. Garcia Escudero was fired for granting the “national interest” category to Surcos, which was condemned as\n\n“seriously dangerous” by the National Board of Classification of Spectacles but which he hailed as a model for a new Falangist cinema, calling it “the first glance at reality in a cinema of papier-maché.””\n\nThe reason the government found this action so objectionable was that he simultaneously y denied\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nthe “national interest” category gory to\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n29\n\nThe lavish finale of José Luis | demonstrates the colonizing Sdenz de Heredia’s historical\n\npower of cross-cultural\n\nfilm, Alba de América (1951), — spectacle.\n\nCifesa’s big-budget historical spectacle, Alba de America, which had been personally sponsored by Franco and his hand-picked successor, Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco (who was frequently called the “apostle of continuismo”).?° Looking back to the 1940s, Franco and Carrero\n\nBlanco apparently assumed that the most effective way to popularize Spain’s ideological goals was through the use of the historical film, one of the genres that was also popular in Hollywood. This strategy may have failed in Alba de America,’ but it had succeeded both critically and commercially in Raza (1941), a film directed by José Luis S&enz de Heredia which was based on a fictionalized autobiography written by Franco himself under a pseudonym. In contrast, Garcia Escudero and Nieves Conde perceived that postwar neorealism, in defining the immediate cultural specificity of Spain, might serve as a more effective vehicle for strengthening the populist appeal of fascism, enabling it to address the actual contemporary problems of “the people.” Although the strengthening of fascism was hardly what leftists like Bardem and Patino had in mind,\n\n30\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nthe participants at Salamanca had agreed to set aside their ideological differences during the congress to gain strength from unity—a value that was deeply distrusted by leftists in Italy but which the painful lessons of the Spanish Civil War and the popular success of the Franco regime helped to valorize in Spain. This false unity enabled Garcia Escudero to co-opt the leftist call for a neorealist “social cinema,” particularly in his book Cine social, which was published in 1958. According to Gubern, In appropriating this polemical and uncomfortable theme, .\n\nGarcia Escudero proposed a... valorization of films that fit under this epigraph from his own ideological perspective, . . . the social\n\nthinking of the Catholic Church before the Second Vatican Council. With this maneuver of exorcism, the author tried to deactivate the\n\npropositions that Marxist critics had expressed combatively in the journals Objetive .. . and Cinema universitario (which was edited by\n\nthe Cineclub of the Spanish University Syndicate of Salamanca and\n\nprohibited in 1963, during the mandate of Garcia Escudero as gen-\n\neral director of cinema and theater). Since 1961, these propositions have continued being expressed in Nuestro cine, a journal that inherited the same ideological postulates.”\n\nLike the technocrats from Opus Dei, Garcia Escudero supported\n\nthe conversion of Spain into a modern European nation. He assumed\n\nthat for a model of film aesthetics, Spanish filmmakers should look\n\nnot to Hollywood but to Italy, another Latin country that had already\n\nprovided Spain with a model for fascism.”° Thus, these two models\n\ncould be seen as compatible—especially since Mussolini had created\n\nthe infrastructure for the postwar Italian cinema, and many of the\n\nleading neorealists (including Visconti, Rossellini, and DeSica) had\n\nmade important neorealist precursors during the Fascist era. Ironically, this position is consistent with the current revisionist\n\nview of neorealism that began to emerge at the Mostra Internazionale\n\nel Nuovo Cinema in Pesaro in 1974—one that rejects any essentialist or monolithic definition of the movement and that explores its continuities with popular films made during the Fascist era, most particularly with melodrama. More recently, this revisionist approach\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n3]\n\nhas led Marcia Landy to argue persuasively that “although the neorealists sought to examine the nature. of fascism, they obscured their\n\nown beginnings in the fascist era . . . and underrated the role of\n\npopular cinema in the formation of ideology.”** This role was never underrated by the Italian Fascists, whose films were strongly influenced by popular Hollywood genres (melodrama, comedy, and the historical film) that continued to exert an influence in Italy both within neorealism and long after its demise. Neorealism’s potential compatibility both with fascism and Hollywood genres was perceived in the early 1950s, not only positively by right-wing supporters of Franco like Garcia Escudero and Nieves Conde but also negatively by Bufiuel, a member of “the Other Spain,” those hundreds of thousands of left-wing exiles who fled Spain after the Civil War and who saw themselves as surviving representatives of an enlightened Spanish culture. Even though it was the critical success of neorealism that helped establish a favorable climate for the reemergence of Bufiuel within the international film scene in the early 1950s, he ultimately rejected the movement because he believed its basic humanism was conformist and its subversive potential a sham. I am ideologically opposed to the neorealist tendency. Neorealism introduced some enrichments to cinematographic expression, but nothing more. Neorealist reality is partial, official, above all reason-\n\nable; but poetry, mystery, are absolutely lacking in it. . . . If it were\n\npossible for me, I would make films which, apart from entertaining\n\nthe audience, would convey to them the absolute certainty that they\n\nDO NOT LIVE IN THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS. . . . Movies today, including the so-called neorealist, are dedicated to tasks contrary to this.*?\n\nBufiuel demonstrated neorealism’s susceptibility to ideological re-\n\ninscription in Los olvidados (1950) by undermining its aesthetic with surrealist conventions, particularly with subversive dream sequences,\n\nan Oedipal subtext, the antihumanist assumption that everyone is\n\npotentially evil and capable of murder, and a documentary prologue 32\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nthat becomes parodic when read intertextually against the deeply\n\nironic travelogue sequences in Lage dor and Tierra sin pan (Land\n\nwithout Bread).\n\nBufiuel’s own experience of reediting and redubbing films at the\n\nMuseum of Modern Art (MOMA)\n\nin the 1940s (even such propa-\n\ngandistic works as Leni Riefenstahl’s Olympia) must have made him aware that all film traditions could be subtly subverted from within. And if that were the case, then why not subvert the most powerful\n\nof all—the Hollywood melodrama. This is a strategy he would master\n\nin Mexico, particularly in a film like E/ (1952), and a strategy that\n\nwould lead him ever after to prefer melodrama over neorealism as the cinematic form with the greatest subversive potential. Although most Spanish filmmakers in the 1950s had heard about\n\nBufiuel’s success with Los olvidados at Cannes, they were unable to see his films or to know what he was up to at MOMA in the 1940s,\n\nbut they had another vivid example of Hollywood’s susceptibility to ideological reinscription. Beginning in 1941, the Francoist regime required that all foreign films be dubbed into Castilian in Spain by Spaniards. Thus, these filmmakers witnessed how easily the plots, meanings, and values of American films could be altered to suit the official ideology of Spanish censors. The most notorious example of such ideological reinscription is John Ford’s Mogambo (1953). To purge the film of adultery, Spanish dubbers changed Grace Kelly and her husband into siblings, freeing her to fall in love with Clark Gable but also creating an incestuous subtext. Partly because of such examples, many Spaniards, particularly on the Right, tended to underestimate the ideological effect of the image in American cinema, thinking that the superficial changes in plot and dialogue imposed by Franco’s censors could totally defuse its colo-\n\nnizing power. An example of this attitude can be found as early as\n\n1940 in an often-quoted article published in the Falangist weekly,\n\nPrimer plano:\n\nA people less infantile than the Yanks would have succeeded in imposing their convictions by means of their gigantic film markets on other nations and won the sympathies of the world. But American\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n33\n\nmovies, albeit magnificent in sight and sound, lack any deep proselytizing purpose. . . . If American films with their at times almost pornographic excesses had not aroused the embarrassed repulse of our Catholic moral values, they surely would have Americanized the so-\n\ncial mores of Spain and the entire world.”°\n\nThe irony that this writer failed to see (but which was always so\n\napparent to Bufiuel) was that it was precisely those pornographic\n\nexcesses of infantile visual pleasure that masked their ideology and thereby enabled Hollywood to dominate international markets and Americanize the world. And that is why its ideological reinscription had to operate on the level of filmic language. On the contrary, neorealism seemed to offer a new filmic language capable of validating the political reality of any populist movement whether of the Left or the Right—which is one of the reasons Bufiuel distrusted it. For many Spaniards, Italian neorealism presented a model not only of how to develop a national cinema that could challenge Hollywood’s domination of world markets but also of how such a movement could change a nation’s international image from that of a Fascist supporter of Hitler to a progressive European center of humanism. This goal was very appealing to the Franco regime, particularly in 1953 when Spain was negotiating its military base agreement with the United States and in 1955 when Spain was admitted\n\nto the United Nations. This kind of reinscription clearly had been\n\noperative in Open City, neorealism’s first big international success,\n\nwhich presented Nazis as melodramatic monsters without ever mentioning Mussolini and while figuring Italian Fascists as nearly benign.\n\nA similar miraculous transformation was later achieved in the 1970s\n\nby the New German Cinema (but using Hollywood rather than neorealist conventions as the primary medium\n\nof reinscription),\n\nmaking it another viable model for Spanish filmmakers in post-\n\nFranco Spain.”\n\nAccording to Payne, the defascistization of Spain began as soon as it became clear that Hitler and Mussolini were going to lose World\n\nWar II: “Franco had to develop an alternate political theory and tactic, unveiling his new scheme of a corporative Rechtsstaat ‘organic\n\n34\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\ndemocracy’ based on Catholic doctrine by the time that the war ended in 1945.”7° Skillfully playing each political faction off against the others, Franco was able to construct a monolithic Spanish unity with great popular appeal, particularly when it was promoted not as a radical form of fascism but as a populist return to traditional sacred values centered in the family and the church. In “Spanish Fascism,” Payne wrote,\n\nThe limitation in the fascistization of the Franco regime lay not only\n\nin the fact that the government had been founded by the non-fascist (and increasingly anti-Falangist) military, but equally in the very\n\ncharacter of the Civil War itself, which had quickly become a mass mobilized revolutionary-counterrevolutionary conflict. The true popular support culturally and ideologically for the Nationalist forces was thus not to be found among the radical new fascism of the Falange, but in the defense and reaffirmation of Spanish national culture, tradition, and religion. The Nationalist zone became the scene\n\nof a neo-Catholic traditionalist revival without precedent or sequel in any other twentieth century European country, one that might bear comparison with the revival of Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East. (107)\n\nAlthough this return to an almost feudal orthodoxy might seem incompatible with the drive toward industrialization, the technocrats of Opus Dei (the Catholic lay order that infiltrated and dominated Spain’s political, economic, intellectual, and social elite) played a key role in negotiating this contradiction by forging “an amalgam of authoritarianism, traditional Catholicism, and the world of Americanized business efficiency.”*? This articulation of formerly con-\n\ntradictory elements helped to construct a new hegemony in Francoist ~~ Spain.\n\nPayne describes three phases of defascistization: the first between 1942 and 1947 (when the Falange Espafiola Tradicionalista was not abolished but “‘new policy required that the term ‘National Move-\n\nment’ replace Falange’’); the second between 1945 and 1957 (when the regime would come to occupy “a kind of halfway house between\n\nthe central European fascist structures of the preceding generation THE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n35\n\nand the resurgent new European democracies”); and the third that resulted “from the tremendous transformation of Spain’s society after the great development boom and massive industrialization of the 1960s” (“Spanish Fascism,” 101-112). The second stage was greatly\n\nfacilitated by the cold war climate, which made the United States and\n\nits European allies more willing to cooperate with Franco despite his Fascist past. In the third stage, the Franco regime introduced. aperturismo, that official seven-year policy (1962-1969) of opening Spain to rapid industrial, economic, and cultural growth, which was to be stimulated by outside investment and influence. This policy came with Fraga’s appointment as the minister of information and the reappointment of Garcia Escudero (who had earlier been a supporter of neorealism) as general director of cinema.*° By the time neorealism arrived in Spain in 1951, the process of defascistization was well under way. Thus neorealism itself could be seen as a vehicle of ideological reinscription, one that was opposed\n\nboth to fascism and to Hollywood, which were perceived as aligned partly because conventions from popular Hollywood genres had been so effectively absorbed by the commercial films made during the Fascist era both in Italy and Spain. Within all three postwar national film movements of former Fascist nations—lItalian neorealism, the New German Cinema, and the New Spanish Cinema—the United States would be figured as a hegemony that was able to replace,\n\nperpetuate, or co-opt fascism—primarily through the economic leverage of the Marshall Plan and the cultural imperialism of Holly-\n\nwood. | Instead of choosing one model over the other, many of the most influential Spanish filmmakers of the 1950s (whether on the Left or the Right) used neorealism and Hollywood as a dialectic opposition within their films. Bakhtin argues that in such intentional hybrids, the crucial activity is not so much the dialogizing of linguistic forms “as it is the collision between differing points of view on the world that are embedded in these forms” and “the carving-out of a living image of another language.” He claims this dialogic effect is even more powerful when the linguistic forms are chosen from an alien culture. 36\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nConsciousness awakens to independent ideological life precisely in a world of alien discourses surrounding it, and from which it cannot initially separate itself. . . . It is not so much interpreted by us as it\n\nis... applied to new material. . . . It enters into . . . a struggle with other internally persuasive discourses. Our ideological development is\n\njust such an intense struggle within us for hegemony among various available verbal and ideological points of view, approaches, directions and values.?'\n\n|\n\nThis statement precisely describes the process of ideological reinscription that occurred in the Spanish cinema of the 1950s when it dialogized the “alien” languages of Hollywood and neorealist cinema as a means of destabilizing the mythologized Spanish unity and its “imperial Castilian language,” which were imposed by the\n\nFrancoist regime. This process exposed the ideological operations in all cinematic language. Bakhtin claims, | This verbal-ideological decentering will occur only when a national culture loses its sealed off and self-sufficient character, when it be-\n\ncomes conscious of itself as only one among other cultures and languages. It is this knowledge that will sap the roots of a mythological feeling for language, based as it is on an absolute fusion of ideological meaning with language. (369-370)\n\nBakhtin’s account helps to explain why the dialogism of Hollywood and neorealist conventions was frequently linked in these films of the 1950s with an exploration of the semic codes of Spanishness—a hybridization that enabled these works to be distinguished from the official Francoist cinema while still remaining readable to an international audience. In “Rhetoric of the Image,” in which Roland Barthes describes\n\na system of semantic signs (or semes) drawn from a cultural code,\n\nhe defines connoters whose “common\n\ndomain . . . is ideology”\n\nand which, in contrast to a denoted word, are “organized in asso-\n\nciative fields, in paradigmatic articulations, even perhaps in oppositions, . . . according to certain semic axes: Jtalianicity belongs to a certain axis of nationalities, alongside Frenchicity, Germanicity or Spanishicity.”°*\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n37\n\nWhat I will be demonstrating in the following textual analyses is how the various connoters of Spanishicity (or Spanishness, as I prefer to call it)—including those that were exploited (such as the espafiolada) and those that were repressed (such as the Black Legend stereotype or the Spanish Civil War) in the official Francoist cinema— were ideologically reinscribed by being associated with the neorealist and Hollywood stylistics. That is, I will be exploring how cinematic\n\nconventions from these two opposing axes helped determine how\n\nSpanishness would be redefined in contrast to Italianness, Ameri-\n\ncanness, and other national semes, both to Spaniards and to for-\n\neigners. While many of these Spanish filmmakers associated the Holly-\n\nwood model with the use of folkloric stereotypes as a signifier of Spanishness, they saw neorealism leading to the adoption of the urban collective as an alternative seme. What remained hidden behind both alternatives was the Spanish Civil War, the repressed signifier that Canciones had sought to liberate from the archives which was increasingly fetishized by its repression.°” Except for a flurry of patriotic historical films in the early 1940s such as Raza (which presented the Civil War from the victors’ point of view), the Civil War remained a taboo subject both for Spanish films and for foreign imports in the 1940s and 1950s because it was perceived as a threat to the monolithic national unity imposed by Franco and to\n\nhis ongoing process of defascistization.** Yet as the training ground for the ideological struggles of World War II and the cold war, the Civil War proved that Spain was neither as irrelevant nor as backward as it appeared in the Francoist period— even as a subject for Italian neorealism and Hollywood melodrama. Although the specific association with the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War was suppressed by Italian censors from “lo Spag-\n\nnolo” (the Spaniard), that enigmatic character in Visconti’s Osses-\n\nstone,” the Spanish Civil War was the acknowledged site where\n\nManfredi (Rossellini’s Communist resistance leader in Open City)\n\nhad first fought the Fascists. Thus, as a signifier, the Spanish Civil War was essential to the ideological foundation of the neorealist movement. In Hollywood, even though its ideological associations 38\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nwere rarely foregrounded, the Spanish Civil War still functioned as a signifier for individual heroism. For example, it is the war in which the Bogart character in Casablanca (1942) claims to have fought and in which both Hemingway and his most romantic hero, Robert Jordan, had first tested their “manly” courage, which continued to have such glamorous appeal not only in print but also, with Hollywood’s 1943 adaptation of For Whom the Bell Tolls, on movie\n\nscreens worldwide. The dialectic between neorealism and Hollywood and their respective semes of Spanishness is an important structural principle in at least four of the most influential films of the period: Surcos (1951),\n\ndirected by former Falangist Nieves Conde, the neorealist film that led to the firing of Garcia Escudero; Bardem’s Muerte de un ciclista (1955), which was released during the year of the Salamanca Con-\n\ngress and was one of the first Spanish films to win a major prize at Cannes and to be widely distributed and critically acclaimed abroad;*° Los golfos (1959), the debut feature of Saura, who was to become a major force in the New Spanish Cinema of the 1960s and 1970s; and El cochecito (1960), one of the collaborations between Italian director Marco Ferreri (who made his first three features in\n\nSpain) and Spanish screenwriter Rafael Azcona (who also worked frequently with Berlanga and Saura), which demonstrates that distinctively Spanish form of “absurdist neorealism” based on esperpento\n\nwhich Almodévar was to revive in the 1980s.\n\nSince I intend to demonstrate how these dynamics work on the level of stylistics as well as within the broad outlines of narrative and thematic content, close textual analysis is essential. This requirement necessarily limits the number of works that can be examined. I have chosen these four films not because they are “typical” of the 653 Spanish movies produced during the 1950s but for two specific reasons: first, because they have already been singled out by other\n\ncritics and historians as having been influential; and second, because their use of this dialectic is clearly foregrounded.\n\nIn all four of the hybrids from the 1950s, Hollywood conventions are linked with a capitalist promotion of individualism, which proves\n\nto be divisive and destructive, while neorealist conventions are as-\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n39\n\nsociated with the collective (whether family, proletariat, or street\n\ngang). Yet all four films imply that the dialectic combination of the two aesthetics (as well as the related thematic opposition between the individual and the collective) is essential to portray the cultural specificity of Spain in the 1950s. Although all four films expose the high costs (both for the nation and the individual) of the capitalist model of individualism, it was nevertheless used to seek international\n\nstardom for their own talented young auteurs, who were trying to\n\ncompete with their European counterparts, particularly from Italy\n\nand France.\n\nIn the first half of the decade, in Surcosand Muerte, the dialogized opposition between Hollywood and neorealism was highly polarized, almost Manichaean, whether the ideological background of its director was Falangist (Nieves Conde) or Communist (Bardem). Both\n\nused neorealist conventions to document the immediate socioeconomic reality of Spain, and both reinscribed conventions from Hol-\n\nlywood gangster films, psychological thrillers, and noir to construct that “other scene”’ of fiction onto which the harsher political critique could be displaced and in which the troubling issues of class exploi-. tation and sexual repression could be more safely dramatized. But by the end of the decade when the second phase of defascistization was already accomplished and Spain had moved closer to the new European democracies, and when neorealism was dead as a movement in Italy and the French New Wave was now leading the European challenge of Hollywood, Los golfos and El cochecito interrogated and recombined both sides of the opposition, “carving out” the distinctive idiom that would help to characterize the New Spanish\n\nCinema of the 1960s and 1970s—a stylistic that would still carry the\n\ntrace of that reinscription, as is most powerfully demonstrated in E/ esptritu de la colmena.\n\nFALANGIST NEOREALISM IN SURCOS\n\nHopewell observes that Surcos is “a cu-\n\nrious graft of American gangster thriller and neo-realism. It is also a Falangist thesis drama.”°’ The two most interesting questions raised\n\nby this combination are: How are conventions from a supposedly left-wing discourse like neorealism ideologically reinscribed to serve\n\n40\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nan ultra right-wing Falangist thesis film such as this, and why are they positioned within a Hollywood genre? Although it does not specifically address the Spanish context, Laclau’s Politics and Ideology in Marxist Theory: Capitalism-FascismPopulism might be useful in answering the first question as it theorizes\n\nthe process of transforming ideologies. Drawing on Althusser’s idea\n\nof interpellation (“the basic function of all ideology is to interpellate/ constitute individuals as subjects,” 100), Laclau argues that fascism is characterized by a highly unified, yet inconsistent ideological © discourse in which one interpellation, like the family, becomes the main organizer of all others. interpellation, f for example, political int interWhen en a a famil afamilial l interpellation, ple, evokes evokes aa political pellation, a religious interpellation, or an aesthetic interpellation, and when each of these isolated interpellations operates as a symbol of the others, we have a relatively unified ideological discourse.**\n\nLaclau claims that ideologies are “transformed through class struggle, which is carried out through the production of subjects and the articulation/disarticulation of discourses” (103). He argues that each\n\nsector in the struggle tries to create a new ideological unity by using a “system of narration” to disarticulate the ideological discourses of the opposing forces. Thus, each sector “tries to give coherence to its ideological discourse by presenting its class objectives as the consummation of popular objectives” (109). Although based on a disarticulation of opposing ideological discourses, this Fascist process of reinscription is diametrically opposed\n\nto Bakhtinian dialogism, for it seeks to construct and perpetuate\n\n(rather than undermine) a monolithic hegemony. Yet the new he-\n\ngemony it constructs is not restricted to a narrow elite; it is delib-\n\nerately designed to appeal to a wide range of classes, which is one of\n\nthe reasons melodrama was the ideal system of narration to express\n\nsuch ideological struggle. As Christine Gledhill explains,\n\nEmerging with capitalist mass entertainment, [melodrama] defines a terrain in which different classes and social groups meet and find an\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n4]\n\nidentity. . . . However, if the “popular” is claimed as a point of social cohesion, it is also contested. The “popular” is fraught with tension, struggles and negotiations. In this context the heterogeneity of the melodramatic aesthetic facilitates conflict and negotiation be-\n\ntween cultural identities.”\n\nThis kind of ideological transformation is precisely what happens in Surcos: the struggle to define “popular objectives” is played out not in class conflict but in the opposing conventions of neorealism and Hollywood melodrama. At one point in the film, two characters associated with Hollywood gangster movies explicitly critique neorealism. When Don Roque’s mistress asks him to take her to the movies, the villainous gangster boss says, “They're showing a neorealist film.” What's that? asks the bimbo. “Social problems in the barrio,” he replies. After leaving the theater, she complains, “What an idiotic film! Why show such misery? A millionaire’s life is so much more fun.” Surcos adopts melodrama as its unifying system of narration to gloss over all logical contradictions and to expand its populist appeal. Although melodrama had been central to both Fascist and Hollywood discourse as well as persistent within neorealism, the film uses the American form, perhaps because its “transposition of class conflicts into country/city oppositions” was so well suited to the film’s Falangist perspective and to its theme of urban migration. By displacing all political issues onto the family, this melodramatic system\n\nimplies that ifan individual peasant family can preserve its traditional values, then the state, no matter how severe its socioeconomic problems, will survive. Thus, the moral restoration of the patriarchal family (rather than the political solution of urban problems in the\n\nbarrio) becomes the primary “popular objective.” In focusing on the urban migration of the peasant farmer, Surcos\n\nforegrounds one of the major contradictions in Francoism, which drew criticism both from Falangists and Marxists. According to Carr, In spite of an enthusiasm for the peasant farmer as the “core of the race,” insulated from the subversive doctrines that had infected the\n\n42\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nurban workers after 1931, the regime early saw that . . . migration to\n\nthe cities was a natural consequence of industrialization. Without it there would have been no industrial take-off—as the regime recog-\n\nnized when it abandoned its efforts to stop the exodus from the land and the agrarian ideology that idealized the peasant farmer. Even so, industrial growth could not absorb the totality of the rural\n\nunderemployed. . . . The radical Falangist notions of agrarian reform\n\ndissolved in a regime dominated by conservative interests.*°\n\nInstead of analyzing the complexities of this political issue, Surcos presents it as a simplistic Manichaean opposition between the corrupt city undergoing industrialization and the innocent rural Spain being ravaged—a contrast that is foregrounded by the juxtaposed images of train and wheat fields that frame the film. Consequently, at the Salamanca Congress, Bardem attacked Surcos for not dealing with the underlying causes of urban immigration.*’ While granting that the migrants’ desire for old rural values has traditionally been considered reactionary by Marxists, Laclau perceives a potential for radical transformation in this theme, arguing that the migrants’ “refusal to accept capitalist legality . . . expresses a more ‘advanced’ and ‘modern’ attitude than European-style trade unionism” (158). We can see both the radical rejection of capitalism and the glossing over of logical inconsistencies most clearly in the villainous figure of Don Roque. He is both a corrupt godfather from Hollywood gangster movies and a Europeanized Francoist politician (with his nick-\n\nname “The Chamberlain” and. with his slim black umbrella that he admittedly carries for “‘a sophisticated look”). He evokes the typical villain from early American melodrama, which Gledhill describes as\n\n“sportling] European airs” and “associated with the city, and its\n\ngrowing divisions between rich and poor” (24). Yet in the Spanish context, this condensation also brings to mind the oligarchy created by the black market and Franco’s courting of American investment— associations that suggest a more radical critique of capitalism.\n\nSurcos traces the moral disintegration of a peasant family from Salamanca once it migrates to Madrid. Partly because of the father’s weakness and the mother’s quick adoption of urban values, their THE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n43\n\ndaughter, Tonia, loses the family honor in cabaret singing and sexual transgression (which are frequently linked in Fascist melodrama). Their two sons seek alternative patriarchal models: the younger son,\n\nManolo, luckily finds a good puppeteer, whose populist theater positions him on and in the Right, whereas the older son, Pepe, like an antihero from noir, is lured by a bad woman into a world of crime. Thus, these moral struggles of the family are partly expressed through a conflict among three popular forms of entertainment associated with melodrama in Spain: cabaret singing, puppet theater, and cine negro. Though frequently compared to Visconti’s Rocco ¢ i suoi fratelli (Rocco and His Brothers, 1960), which it precedes by nine years, Surcos is actually ideologically closer to Rey’s silent classic, La aldea maldita (1929).** Both Spanish melodramas present a highly unified\n\nideological discourse through the single interpellation of the family, which organizes all others. In contrast, Visconti’s melodramas tend to present multiple discourses, whose complex relations can be examined with considerable specificity within the small social unit of the family, which is always positioned within larger contexts of class struggle and historical change. Unlike La aldea maldita, where the intertitles present urban migration as a biblical theme within traditional Christian discourse (another “tragedy of Exodus”), Surcos uses neorealist conventions to place this theme within a contemporary political discourse as “the most painful problem of our times.” Nevertheless, both Spanish films connect the urban migration of the poor with the corruption of women as a combined threat to the moral rigidity of the Spanish patriarchy. As a supporter of the Falange, Nieves Conde subscribed to the “extreme stress on the masculine principle and male dominance,” which Payne includes as a key tenet within his typological\n\ndescription of European fascism. Acknowledging that “all European\n\npolitical forces in the era of fascism were overwhelmingly led by and\n\nmade up of men, and those that paid lip service to female equality\n\nin fact had little interest in it,” Payne insists that “only fascists,\n\nhowever, made a perpetual fetish of the ‘virility’ of their movement\n\nand its program and style. ... No other kind of movement professed 44\n\nTRANSCULTURAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nsuch complete horror at the slightest suggestion of androgyny.”*° Similarly, Geoffrey Nowell-Smith includes this fetishization of maleness as an essential characteristic of melodrama and explains how it functions even in those films where the protagonist is a female (which could be claimed for La aldea maldita) or an impotent male (as in Surcos).\n\n“Masculinity” although rarely attainable, is at least known as an\n\nideal. “Femininity,” within the terms of the argument, is not only unknown\n\nbut unknowable.\n\n... For both men and women,\n\nhowever,\n\nsuffering and impotence . . . are seen as forms of a failure to be male—a failure from which patriarchy allows no respite.*4\n\nBoth La aldea maldita and Surcos stress the thematic opposition between phallic rigidity and female malleability, between the eternal bonds linking fathers and sons versus the supposedly more unreliable relations with mothers, wives, and daughters. In the silent film, the\n\nstability of Castilian values is represented visually through static painterly compositions and architectural tableaux, which evoke art\n\nforms from Spain’s glorious past. In contrast, the forces of change are associated with the uniqueness of cinematic spectacle, with the new film medium’s reliance on the theatrical specularization of the woman’s body, of clouds and wind moving ominously across a dark sky, and of vehicles and crowds moving dynamically across the frame. To express a similar contrast, Surcos turns to the contrasting styles of neorealism and Hollywood. What Surcos seems to offer as the\n\nprimary seme of Spanishness is not the folkloric spectacles of cabaret singing or puppet shows but a rigid moral adherence to the feudal patriarchal family in the face of historical change. This same seme was\n\ndominant not only in La aldea maldita but also in Franco’s Raza (1941), which officially sanctioned the fusion of the compatible\n\ndiscourses of fascism and melodrama. Surcos focuses on the father’s loss of power and the corruption of\n\nthe children once the mother and the eldest son (who is dominated by his fiancée and who convinced the family to migrate) take charge\n\nTHE\n\nIDEOLOGICAL\n\nREINSCRIPTION\n\nOF\n\nNEOREALIST\n\nAND\n\nHOLLYWOOD\n\nCONVENTIONS\n\n45\n\nof the family. When the father fails as a breadwinner, his wife tells him, “You peel potatoes, Ill get the money. I should have left you behind.” The father’s failure reaches its climax in a powerful factory sequence where the dynamic montage, slanted camera angles, and omission of dialogue evoke Soviet expressionism. Landy notes that the influence of Soviet montage (though never as dominant as American) also appeared in Italian melodrama of the Fascist era, emanating “most "
