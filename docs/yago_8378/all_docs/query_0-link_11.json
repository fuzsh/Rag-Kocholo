        "text": "Classic Spanish Dramedy about an obstinate retired man , being full of satire , criticism and black comedy . Here Marco Ferreri realizes another excellent film - along with ¨El Pisito¨ and ¨Los Chicos¨- plenty of irony , habits , Spanish social life , deep feeling and social critical . Seventy-something Don Anselmo Proharan (José Isbert) , a retired state agent , finds himself sharing living space with his son (Pedro Porcel) , a bourgeoisie Procurador , his granddaughter (Chus Lampreave) and her boyfriend (José Luis López Vazquez) . But widower Don Anselmo is unhappy , the reason for being restricted to one room at home , and his social life has narrowed to his paralytic friends , attending funerals , and visiting the graveyard . Along the way he joins his paraplegic friends at motorized meeting . A good friend is Don Lucas (Lepe) who eventually gets a motorized wheelchair, then Proharan accompanies him to his spouse's grave to leave flowers . Don Anselmo soon becomes obsessed with getting his own \"little coach\" and joining the subculture of other \"cochecito\" owners . As his son doesn't like at buying it , but Anselmo steals him money , that's why the only way to keep his stubborn decision to enjoy with his friends .\n\nThis is an enjoyable story that contains drama , busy comedy , humor , adequate pace , amusing gags , rowdy satire , noisy hustle and results to becpretty entertaining . Being masterfully made by Marco Ferreri who was at times really criticised for his stridently bleak view of human nature . It is considered to be one of the best films from classy Spanish cinema history and has been voted as one of the best Spanish films by professionals and critics in cinema centenary . The main and support actors stand out under Ferreri's perfect direction , including sour criticism , as well as Marco carried out in his previous and subsequent works that include bitter , pessimistic descriptions of social classes . In ¨El Cochecito¨ we can find very fun and attractive characters , all of them caricatures of the \"spanish way of life\" and a mirror on the Spanish society by that time . A very good film which tended not to be very well received by the censor for its acidity and considered to be one of the best Spanish films of the history ; however, his strong portrait of Spanish society , plenty of sharpness and grisly ending , didn't please the pro-Franco authorities .¨El Cochecito¨ (1960) , one of the undisputed masterpieces and fundamental in filmography of Marco Ferreri where shows the miseries of an amoral society and shot at the beginning of his creativity , during his Spanish period , in a time cultural difficult , where the enormous censorship of the political regime, exacerbated the ingenuity and imagination of the scriptwriters , as the prestigious and prolific writer Rafael Azcona . Main and support cast are frankly magnificent . José Isbert is terrific as the retired septuagenarian man who becomes obsessed with owning a motorized wheelchair and when his penurious son refuses to buy a chair for him , the old man attempts several gambits to get one by faking infirmity. Top-notch secondaries actors ,such as : Pedro Porcel as his tight-fisted son , José Luis López Vázquez , Chus Lampreave , María Luisa Ponte , Ángel Álvarez, María Isbert, Antonio Jiménez Escribano , Antonio Riquelme , among others . It contains evocative cinematography in white and black by Julio Baena . Atmospheric and adequate musical score by Miguel Asins Arbo .\n\nAnother masterpiece by the notorious filmmaker Marco Ferreri who shows the lively as well as sad existence of an elderly man . It won several prizes : Sant Jordi Awards 1961 Winner Sant Jordi Best Film to Marco Ferreri , Best Spanish Actor : José Isbert and Venice Film Festival 1960 Winner FIPRESCI Prize Marco Ferreri , though the film was shown out of competition . Direction by Marco Ferreri is awesome , he shows his skill for edition , realizing long shots with crowd who moves easily , as he filmed three several polemic movies during the 50s , all of them written by Rafael Azcona and Ferreri himself : El Pisito (1958) , Los Chicos (1959) and El Cochecito (1960) , and all of them were beset by difficulties with the censors caused by thorny critical to social stratum .Ferreri's first foray into film work was filming commercials , and as promoter of a cinema magazine. Working in Spain from 1957, making his directorial debut there . Ferreri directed various notorious films , mainly outlandish and strange dramas with deep emotions . He made a lot of black comedies adding ironical observations of social conventions and middle-class sexual mores . He was at times criticised for his stridently bleak view of simple people and human nature . Ferreri was a prestigious writer and director, especially known for Harem (1967) ,The audience (1972), La grande bouffe (1973) , Yerma (1978) , Tales of ordinary madness (1981), Story of Piera (1983) , How Good the Whites Are The flesh (1988) , and The house of the smiles (1991). Rating 7.5/10 , pretty good . Essential and indispensable watching for Marco Ferreri aficionados . Better than average and well worth seeing .\n\n4 out of 6 found this helpful.
