        "text": "Born in Figueres in 1927, Pere Portabella has remained true to his political commitment to all the movements combatting the dictatorship of Francisco Franco ever since the 1960s. He became a senator in the first democratic elections after Franco’s death, after which he was a member of the Parliament of Catalonia. He has been active as a filmmaker for more than four decades. As head of Films 59, he produced some of the most representative films of Spanish cinema, among them Carlos Saura’s Los golfos (The Hooligans, 1959), Marco Ferreri’s El cochecito (The Wheelchair, 1960) as well as Luis Buñuel’s Viridiana (1960). As a film director, he works in his own creations, bringing together the legacy of avant-garde culture and his own quest to break down the boundaries of language. His work has been exhibited at MoMA, Tate Modern, Centre Pompidou, and documenta Kassel. In 2008 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Autonomous University of Barcelona."
