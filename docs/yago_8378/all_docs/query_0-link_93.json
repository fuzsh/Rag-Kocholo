Another 7 wins & 1 nomination.\n\nActors: Cassen, Elvira QuintillÃ¡, JosÃ© Luis LÃ³pez VÃ¡zquez, Manuel Alexandre\n\nWriter: Luis GarcÃ­a Berlanga (story), Rafael Azcona (story), Luis GarcÃ­a Berlanga (screenplay), Rafael Azcona (screenplay), JosÃ© Luis Colina (screenplay), JosÃ© Luis Font (screenplay)\n\nExternal Links: Rotten Tomatoes IMDb Language: Spanish Country: Spain\n\nPlot: In a small spanish town, a group of old ladies decide to celebrate Christmas Eve with a \"Sit a poor man at your table\" dinner: each wealthy household of the town will have a homeless person dining with them that night. The celebrations also include a parade, and in it we find PlÃ¡cido, the humble owner of a three-wheeler, whose family is forced to live in a public lavatory because of the lack of money to pay the rent, and who has to pay the second bill of his vehicle before midnight or else he will lose it.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: This is an effective satire directed by Luis Berlanga that pans charity from the head -- the cold, calculated or unthinking kind -- as versus charity from the heart. The focus is on Placido (Casto Sendra-Cassen), a truckdriver who has little money and so making regular payments on his truck can be difficult, so much so that he gets behind and is in danger of having his vehicle repossessed. Meanwhile, he gets involved in a local, annual charity drive that opens up his eyes to the problems and foibles of other impoverished people. After those experiences, Placido has a different attitude toward his monthly payments. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi\n\nScroll To: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75% [ / 6]\n\n81% (1) The Executioner 90 min, Not Rated, [Drama, Comedy] [Luis GarcÃ­a Berlanga]\n\nRatings & Reviews: IMDb Reviews: 81%, External Reviews\n\nAwards: 4 wins & 2 nominations.\n\nActors: Emma Penella, JosÃ© Isbert, JosÃ© Luis LÃ³pez VÃ¡zquez, Nino Manfredi\n\nWriter: Luis GarcÃ­a Berlanga (story), Rafael Azcona (story), Luis GarcÃ­a Berlanga (screenplay), Rafael Azcona (screenplay), Ennio Flaiano (screenplay collaboration)\n\nExternal Links: Rotten Tomatoes IMDb Language: Spanish Country: Spain, Italy\n\nPlot: The history starts with the main character (an old executioner in the Spain of early 60's) approaching retirement age. As his profession is not exactly what you could call \"popular\", he (a very gentle and nice man, caring, and proud of traditions) begins to worry about who might take his place when he retires. He has a daughter, but, unfortunately, she seems doomed to perpetual \"spinsterhood\": as soon as any prospective groom learns about her dad and her dad's \"trade\", he runs away from her, scared. A sad life... However, a new character enters: the local undertaker, a handsome and young man who has exactly the same problem... No girl wants him given his profession. So, you have the woman whom almost nobody would marry and the man whom almost nobody would marry. Obviously, they are meant for each other. But here the old executioner has something to say: He does not object to her daughter marrying the young undertaker; he seems a decent man, and all that... But there is a condition: Only if the groom agrees to take the executioner's job when he will retire, will he agree to her daughter's marriage. And, anyway, as the old executioner says to the worried young man.... \"Don't worry, they sentence people, but, in the last moment, they're going to pardon them!\".\n\nRotten Tomatoes: In this black comedy, a mortician's assistant wants to marry an executioner's daughter. Her father wants to change professions but cannot, as he will lose his new government-sponsored apartment. The young man is persuaded to take over the job, but he swears he will quit before he must kill someone.\n\nScroll To: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75% [ / 6]\n\n76% (1) El cochecito 85 min, [Comedy, Drama] [Marco Ferreri]\n\nRatings & Reviews: IMDb Reviews: 76%, External Reviews\n\nAwards: 3 wins.\n\nActors: JosÃ© Isbert, JosÃ© Luis LÃ³pez VÃ¡zquez, MarÃ­a Luisa Ponte, Pedro Porcel\n\nWriter: Rafael Azcona (novel), Rafael Azcona (screenplay), Marco Ferreri (screenplay)\n\nExternal Links: Rotten Tomatoes IMDb Language: Spanish, French Country: Spain\n\nPlot: Septuagenarian Don Anselmo Proharan, a retired government minister, finds himself sharing living space with his son, a penurious, bourgeoisie solicitor and his family. Don Anselmo, a widower, is restricted to one room of the house, and his social life has narrowed to attending wakes, funerals, and visiting the cemetery. When his paraplegic friend Don Lucas, gets a motorized wheelchair, Proharan accompanies him to his wife's grave to leave flowers. Don Anselmo soon becomes obsessed with getting his own \"little coach\" and joining the subculture of other \"cochetito\" owners. However, when his tight-fisted son refuses to buy a chair for him, the old man tries several gambits to get one.\n\nRotten Tomatoes: This was one of the first feature-length films for director Marco Ferreri, known for his interest in the grotesque, macabre, and darkly satirical side of life. In this black comedy, an elderly old man who lives with his mean-spirited, insensitive family, enjoys a happier side of life with an invalid friend of his who gets around on a special, adapted motorbike. After seeing that similarly impaired people are using the same conveyances, the man develops a yearning for one of the special bikes himself. But when he goes to his family with his wish, they all respond in the negative -- and none too kindly. His solution is murderous, though definitely lucrative. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi\n\nScroll To: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75% [ / 6]\n\n75% (1) Atraco a las tres 92 min, [Comedy] [JosÃ© MarÃ­a ForquÃ©]\n\nRatings & Reviews: IMDb Reviews: 75%, External Reviews\n\nAwards: 1 win.\n\nActors: Cassen, Gracita Morales, JosÃ© Luis LÃ³pez VÃ¡zquez, Katia Loritz\n\nWriter: Pedro MasÃ³ (story), Vicente Coello (story), Pedro MasÃ³ (screenplay), Vicente Coello (screenplay)\n\nExternal Links: Rotten Tomatoes IMDb Language: Spanish Country: Spain\n\nPlot: Galindo works in a bank.
