ENTIRE AGREEMENT & WAIVER\n\nThese Terms, including any additional terms referenced, make up the entire agreement between you and Shattershock, and supersede any prior agreements.

SURVIVAL\n\nââAll provisions of these Terms which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, those relating to ownership, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.\n\n19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nPlease read this section carefully â it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court and to have a jury hear your claims. It contains procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and a class action waiver.\n\nA.Agreement to Arbitrate\n\nThis Dispute Resolution section is referred to in these Terms as the âArbitration Agreement.â This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.\n\nYou agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Shattershock shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that the binding individual arbitration provisions herein will not apply to the extent prohibited by the laws of your jurisdiction of residence or where the underlying dispute is one of the following types: (i) disputes or claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual dispute; (ii) disputes or claims where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief; or (iii) intellectual property disputes.\n\nFurther, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can seek relief against us on your behalf if the law allows.\n\nYou agree that, by agreeing to these Terms, you and Shattershock are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\n\nB.WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION & REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS\n\nYou and Shattershock agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Except as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one personâs or partyâs claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Likewise, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that partyâs individual claim(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may pursue a claim for, and the arbitrator may award, public injunctive relief under applicable law to the extent required for the enforceability of this provision.\n\nIf this class action waiver is limited, voided, or found unenforceable, then, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, the Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding so long as the proceeding is permitted to proceed as a class action.\n\nC.Dispute Resolution & Arbitration Process\n\nYou and Shattershock agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Shattershock, either party will first contact the other party and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution (including without limitation any court action) after first allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond.\n\nOnly after the parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute, and only if those efforts fail, may either party then initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration in Los Angeles County, California, United States, using the English language in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (âJAMSâ) then in effect (âJAMS Rulesâ), by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators. For information about the JAMS, its Rules, and fees for consumer disputes, see the JAMSâ arbitration page at https://www.jamsadr.com/arbitration.\n\nIf there is any inconsistency between any term of the JAMS Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.\n\nPayment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.\n\nD.Right to Opt Out of Arbitration\n\nYou have the right to opt out of arbitration and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 19 within 30 days of first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. To opt out, you must send written notice of your decision to opt out to arbitrationoptout@oc.netease.com or to our mailing address no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver, the class action waiver still applies. You may not opt out of only the class action waiver and not also the arbitration provisions. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Shattershock also will not be bound by them.\n\nE.Confidentiality & Severability\n\nAll aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.\n\nIf a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (except for Subsection B above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with one that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any provision of Subsection B is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provision is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.\n\nF.Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement\n\nNotwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, if we make any future change to this Arbitration Agreement while you are a user of the Site, you may reject any such change by sending us a written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to arbitrationoptout@oc.netease.com. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this version of the Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).\n\n20. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT NOTIFICATION\n\nIf you believe that content you find on the Site infringes a copyright, please send a copyright infringement notification to the Copyright Agent listed below. To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:\n\n1.Your full name, address, telephone number, and email address;\n\n2.Identification of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed, or if multiple works on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;\n\n3.Identification of the material you claim is infringing, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;\n\n4.A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;\n\n5.A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright ownerâs behalf; and\n\n6.The electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n\nA notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Shattershockâs Copyright Agent at copyright@oc.netease.com. You may also contact us by postal mail at: Shattershock Copyright Agent, 1st Floor, The Liffey Trust Centre, 117-126 Sheriff Street, Upper, Dublin 1, Ireland D01 YC43.\n\n21. MISCELLANEOUS\n\nShattershock shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Shattershockâs reasonable control. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms. Our Terms are written in English (United States), and any translated version is provided solely for your convenience. To the extent any translated version of our Terms conflicts with the English version, the English version controls."
