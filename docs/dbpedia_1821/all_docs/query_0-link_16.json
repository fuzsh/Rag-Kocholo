        "text": "We just cruised London to Nice on Silversea and had the same debate - tack on a few days in Paris before vs. after. We decided to use the trains, though.\n\nWe ended up going after, which was great. No disembarkation followed by a mad rush to the airport, so you could wait for a long flight home.\n\nThe only glich was that our train was canceled (there was a national strike the day we disembarked in Nice). So we had to rent a car at the last minute and drive 10 hours from Nice to Paris. It appears that strikes have become much more frequent in Europe this year - I spoke to a fellow cruiser and apparently the airport at Nice was even more chaotic than the train situation. They didn't get home to England until the following morning.\n\nIf we have a choice we prefer to do city visits post-cruise, as we find that they are a great chance to let yourself down easy after a cruise, rather than going straight home to reality.\n\nWho knows what Europe will be doing in a year, but it's perhaps safer to take a inter-European flight after the cruise rather than chance missing the first day of the cruise due to delays/strikes/whatever.\n\nI, typically, do both a multiple day pre- AND post-cruise stay somewhere in Europe...\n\nsometimes in the port city, other times, as you are planning, elsewhere in Europe...\n\nHOWEVER, when doing a pre-cruise stay elsewhere, my choice is always to still fly into the embarkation city at least one day ahead...\n\nFor example, before one cruise out of Dover, we flew to Madrid, spent four nights there, then flew to London for two nights before the cruise--thus avoiding issues around flight delays and the such...\n\nIt has always been my view that the PRE-CRUISE stay was more important, and, if I were only doing one or the other, no question in my mind, it would be pre-cruise...here's why:\n\nMy greatest concerns are in getting TO the cruise...and getting on the ship rested, adjusted and ready to enjoy...\n\nA lengthy pre-cruise stay allows me to catch up with the travel fatigue and the 8 to 10 hour time zone change I encounter...Quite simply, when we arrive in Europe, we are tired...and our bodies are still working on California time...We end up napping quite a bit the first day...and our sleeping and waking patterns are off...Having a few days in Europe allows us to adjust...\n\nI would hope that even if you decide to do Paris post-cruise, that you at least fly into Barcelona a couple of days early...\n\nAs to the local European airlines, we have never done that...We typically fly British Airways or American Airlines and have had tickets that allow for a multi-city fare with no extra charge for staying over in an extra city...When we've done this trip on Frequent Flier miles, we have had that intermediate stop for no additional charge or miles with AA...That's how we did the stop in Madrid...and how, another Copenhagen round trip cruise, we managed a stop at Heathrow and 8 nights there on the way home (we did 4 nights prior in Copenhagen that cruise)...\n\nBTW, although I have never taken RyanAir or the other cheaper local airlines, I have learned that some of these have even tighter luggage restrictions than the major airlines--which may cause a problem or a high additional charge for your bags...You might think of asking this on the \"Cruise Air\" message board...\n\nI have to say we've done it both ways and I can't say that I have a preference in general. If you are already there, the odds are you'll make the ship. Now, I say that because when we were already there -- we were in the departure port, not some other city.\n\nAnd in fact, usually we do it on both ends ...\n\nIf I had to say I prefer one because I'm only doing one, I think I'd prefer to be in Europe before the cruise, not after. Only because you are a lot closer to your port if a problem develops. Some problems -- like a volcano in Iceland -- are awfully hard to anticipate, however.\n\nAnd I agree about train between cities if possible. We have used the discount airlines but yes, luggage weights (and also carry-on weights) can be a problem. And then the discounters tend to be outside of the destination you're targetting.\n\nLots of considerations!\n\nWe sort of did something like what you are considering a few years ago, but not exactly ... and it's the \"not exactly\" that is the wrinkle. We were in Zurich before a cruise leaving from Barcelona and we flew there by one of the cheapos. But we came in 4 days early, so even a flight delay would have just been delaying our time in Barcelona, not our getting to the ship.\n\nAs we talk, I've decided that my inclination for YOUR trip would be to fly in to Barcelona at least one day early (but if you haven't been there before, multi-days early) so as to be sure of making the ship ... and then doing Paris after.\n\nHard decisions, when to do Paris ... ;)\n\nOkay, I do agree with Claudia about spending time in Barcelona rather than in Paris -- and yes, it's a fab city. But the question was about Paris, and so I assumed the question was posed because Paris is desired.\n\nI wouldn't do Paris before/after a cruise unless the departure/arrival port is Le Havre ... but I HAVE been known to fly to a destination city. And when we do that, we come in at least one day early.\n\nBut also when we do that, it is because we have a reason to be in another city first. If the time you have is generous, then it's not a problem. But if you -- using Paris as the example -- have 4 days to spend in a city you really want to do before or after a cruise, you do want to figure out the best way to do that.\n\nI do think the train in Europe is the best answer -- unless you're traveling from one end of the continent to the other. We had a lovely train trip from Zurich to Florence on one trip (not a cruise). The trains seem to have fewer problems with delays than airlines do ...\n\nAnd when you take a discount airline you are often a good distance away from the city you are trying to reach ..."
