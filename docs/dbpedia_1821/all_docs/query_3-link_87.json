        "text": "2022 MARE NOSTRUM TOUR\n\nWednesday, May 25th & Thursday, May 26h\n\nClub Natació Sant Andreu, Barcelona\n\nLCM (50m)\n\nMeet Central\n\nEntries – Barcelona\n\nLivestream\n\nResults\n\nWith just two days of competition per Mare Nostrum Tour stop, we have back-to-back stacked racing on the agenda each of those days here in Barcelona.\n\nThe fields have filled out a bit more than the first stop in Monaco, which means we have even more talent on which to keep an eye as the races transpire.\n\nAlready this morning we saw a solid morning swim from the reigning 200m free Olympic champion Tom Dean, with the British swimming logging a 2free top seed of 1:46.89. He’ll be chased by the likes of multi-Monaco title winner Matt Sates of South Africa and Olympic medalist Fernando Scheffer of Brazil, not to mention World Championships medalist in the event Katsuo Matsumoto of Japan.\n\nA highlight of the women’s prelims came in the 100m breast, with German national record holder Anna Elendt staking her claim on the event with a big-time 1:05.82. That results sits just .24 outside of her national standard and lifetime best of 1:05.58 the Texas swimmer logged just this past March.\n\nWe’ll see what Elendt has in store tonight when she races in the final against the #1 swimmer in the world in the event right now, Reona Aoki of Japan, the reigning Olympic gold medalist Lydia Jacoby of the United States and the rest of the field.\n\nA showdown in the men’s 50m free among some of the best in the world is also a marquis race, with Bruno Fratus (BRA), Ben Proud (GBR), Thom De Boer (NED), Michael Andrew (USA) and more in the mix.\n\nMEN’S 800 FREE – FINAL\n\nGOLD – Joris Bouchaut (FRA), 7:53.03\n\nSILVER – Marc-Antoine Olivier (FRA), 7:53.53\n\nBRONZE – Daniel Wiffen (IRL), 7:55.16\n\nThe French earned the first gold medal of this Barcelona stop of the 2022 Mare Nostrum Tour, with Joris Bouchaut getting to the wall in a time of 7:53.03 in this men’s 800m free.\n\nThat gave him the edge over teammate Marc-Antoine Olivier who was exactly a half second behind in 7:53.53 while Ireland’s Daniel Wiffen grabbed bronze in 7:55.16.\n\nBouchaut owns a lifetime best of 7:52.37 in this event, so tonight’s swim checks in less than a second away from his career’s quickest performance.\n\nWOMEN’S 50 BACK – FINAL\n\nGOLD – Kylie Masse (CAN), 27.47\n\nSILVER – Ingrid Wilm (CAN), 27.85\n\nBRONZE – Analia Pigree (FRA)/Silvia Scalia (ITA), 27.89\n\nReminder, whereas the stroke 50’s were contested as skins at the Monaco stop, the 50’s here in Barcelona are swum as prelims/finals.\n\nCanada went 1-2 in this women’s 50m back, with national record holder Kylie Masse clocking a time of 27.47 to lead Ingrid Wilm who touched in 27.85.\n\nMasse owns the national record in a swift 27.18, a mark she produced at this year’s Canadian Trials. The 26-year-old Masse has broken this record 3 times in 2022, having swum a 27.62 at the Trials Prep Event in March to take out her own 27.64 from the 2017 World Championships. At that same meet, Masse posted a 27.52 to bring down the time by another 0.10. before settling into the 27.18.\n\nWe also saw our first tie of the meet, with both French swimmer Analia Pigree and Italy’s Silvia Scalia earning bronze in 27.89. Pigree owns the French standard in 27.39 while Scalia’s Italian record stands at 27.66.\n\nMEN’S 50 BREAST – FINAL\n\nGOLD – Michael Andrew (USA), 27.06\n\nSILVER – Joao Gomes Junior (BRA), 27.18\n\nBRONZE – Nicolo Martinenghi (ITA), 27.26\n\nThe United States snagged its first medal of this 2nd stop of the Mare Nostrum Tour, courtesy of multi-Olympic finalist Michael Andrew.\n\n23-year-old Andrew fired off a time of 27.06 to get the edge over Brazilian Joao Gomes Junior who touched in 27.18. Italy’s Nicolo Martinenghi was right behind in 27.26.\n\nThese 3 men all fall among the top 5 performers in the event so far this season, with Martinenghi owning the top time of 26.49. Andrew is #2 in the world with his newly-minted 26.52 American Record while Gomes Junior checks in as the world’s 4th fastest performer this season with 26.62 from April’s Brazil Swimming Trophy.\n\nWOMEN’S 50 FLY – FINAL\n\nGOLD – Melanie Henique (FRA), 25.57\n\nSILVER – Farida Osman (EGY), 25.73\n\nBRONZE – Louise Hansson (SWE), 26.03\n\nThe top 2 finishers of this women’s 50m fly each notched a time under the 26-second threshold tonight. Leading the charge was Melanie Henique of France who fired off a time of 25.57 to beat out Egypt’s Farida Osman by just .16.\n\nBehind Osman’s 25.73 was Swedish standout Louise Hansson who touched in 26.03. Hansson represents Loughborough, as that is where the former USC Trojan moved her training base as of 2020.\n\nFor perspective entering this meet, Henique ranked as the 4th fastest performer in the world in this event, owning a season-best of 25.62. As such, the 29-year-old managed to shave another .05 off of that result to remain in that spot.\n\nMEN’S 400 IM – FINAL\n\nGOLD – Matt Sates (RSA), 4:11.58\n\nSILVER – David Verraszto (HUN), 4:13.54\n\nBRONZE – Max Litchfield (GBR), 4:16.21\n\n18-year-old Matt Sates keeps improving times whenever he swims this men’s 400m IM, dropping his 4:12.74 from Monaco down to now a new lifetime best of 4:11.58.\n\nThe former University of Georgia Bulldog nearly cracked Hungarian icon Laszlo Cseh’s long-standing meet record of 4:11.22, a time that’s been on the books since 2008. Sates’ head-turning effort here also nearly overtook the reigning South African national record. That time stands at the 4:11.11 former Florida Gator Sebastian Rousseau logged in 2011.\n\nSpits for Sates’ effort here are below, with Hungarian mainstay David Verraszto coming in with 4:13.54 for silver while two-time Olympic finalist in this event, Max Litchfield of Great Britain rounded out the top 3 in 4:16.21.\n\nWOMEN’S 100 FREE – FINAL\n\nGOLD – Marrit Steenbergen (NED), 54.16\n\nSILVER – Kayla Sanchez (CAN), 54.24\n\nBRONZE – Maggie MacNeil (CAN), 54.38\n\nDutch Short Course European Championships gold medalist Marrit Steenbergen got it done for the top prize in this women’s 100m free, producing the fastest time of 54.16.\n\nOpening in 26.22 and closing in 27.94, 22-year-old Steenbergen of the Netherlands just put up the 5th fastest performance of her career. Her personal best rests at the 53.97 she hit at the inaugural European Games in 2015. She then took a break to focus on her studies while tonight’s 54.16 result marks her fastest in the past 2 years.\n\nA pair of Canadians Kayla Sanchez and Maggie MacNeil were right in the mix for silver and bronze, respectively hitting times of 54.24 and 54.38.\n\nFor world champion MacNeil, this meet marks her first racing appearance since having suffered a fractured elbow earlier this year.\n\nMEN’S 100 BACK – FINAL\n\nGOLD – Thomas Ceccon (ITA), 53.18\n\nSILVER – Ryosuke Irie (JPN), 53.46\n\nBRONZE – Pieter Coetze (RSA), 53.72\n\nThe top trio of men all got under the 54-second threshold with ease in this 100m backstroke, led by 21-year-old Olympic relay medalist Thomas Ceccon,\n\nCeccon comfortably got to the wall ahead of the field with a mark of 53.18, not terribly off his season-best of 52.99 he established this past January. He owns the Italian national record with the 52.30 he notched at the Olympic Games.\n\n32-year-old veteran Ryosuke Irie landed on yet another podium, creeping in with a time of 53.46, about a half second off of his 52.88 notched at the Japan Swim in April to qualify for next month’s World Championships. That rendered Irie ranked 4th, one slot ahead of Ceccon, in this season’s world rankings.\n\nAs a testament to Irie’s longevity, the man still owns the overall Mare Nostrum record in this event with the 53.08 he produced over a decade ago.\n\nAs for Coetze, at 17 he represented South Africa’s youngest swimming Olypian last year in Tokyo. Now an 18-year-old, he has qualified for his first senior World Championships for Budapest and came in with 53.72 here for the bronze.
