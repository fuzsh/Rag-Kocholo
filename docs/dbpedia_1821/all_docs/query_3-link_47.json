Computational methods are of great importance in modern Bayesian econometrics, and these are discussed in detail.\n\nSubsequently, the course turns to state space models and discusses estimation of several state space models popularly used in macroeconomics. These include time series models where parameters change over time, models with autocorrelated disturbances, and stochastic volatility models.\n\nThe models and methods covered in this course are of direct use in many macroeconomic applications. But they also represent the groundwork that underlies popular multivariate macroeconomic models such as Vector Autoregressions (VARs), time-varying parameter VARs (TVP-VARs), factor and Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibirum (DSGE) models.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBasic knowledge of time series econometrics.\n\nCourse Outline\n\nIntroduction: Review of the classical linear regression model.

He has also been a Visiting Assistant Professor at New York University and Senior Research Manager at the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nCourse Overview\n\nThis course deals with factor models for large cross-sections of time-series (large N environment). We build the argument in steps, starting from the simplest multivariate technique, principal components.\n\nWe then discuss “small N” factor models for cross-sectional data and study how to estimate factor models with the EM algorithm.\n\nWe then review dynamic “small N” models for time-series, the associated state-space form and the Kalman filter and smoother, which are typically used to estimate those models.\n\nMoving to the “large N” environment, first with cross-sectional data and then with time-series data, we discuss the link between factors and principal components. We clarify the distinction between static and dynamic factors and highlight how “large N” dynamic factor models can be used to perform structural analysis by using techniques similar to those used in Structural VAR models.\n\nIn this context, we review several applications, among others, factor augmented VAR models (FAVAR), the construction of business cycle indicators, how to handle the jagged nature of macroeconomic data releases in nowcasting and forecasting exercises, the analysis of monetary policy in real time, the identification of the monetary transmission mechanism, the identification of news shocks to technology.\n\nIf time permits, we discuss non-invertibilities and the relation to factor models.\n\nMatlab programs to implement the theoretical methods and replicate the applications studied in class will be made available to students.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nGood knowledge of time series econometrics, in particular VAR analysis.\n\nCourse Outline\n\nFactor Models\n\nPrincipal components estimator.\n\nSmall N, i.i.d. and dynamic, the EM algorithm, Kalman filter/smoother.\n\nLarge N, i.i.d. and dynamic. Consistency at large: a law of large numbers in the cross-section.\n\nApplications: Commonality in European regions, new Eurocoin, monetary policy in real time, nowcasting, measuring macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nStructural Factor model (SFM)\n\nSpecification and estimation.\n\nTools: Impulse response functions, variance decomposition, historical decomposition.\n\nIdentification: Short and long-run zero, sign restrictions, penalty function approach.\n\nDSGE and Factor models.\n\nApplications: Monetary policy shocks, house prices, disaggregated prices.\n\nFactor augmented VAR (FAVAR)\n\nApplications: Monetary Policy, news shocks.\n\nTesting non-invertibility.\n\nSoftware/Hardware\n\n*LAPTOP REQUIRED.

He took part in the Graduate Research Program of the European Central Bank and was Visiting Student at Tel Aviv University. He has been a visiting scholar at the Department of Economics, New York University. He taught at the Università Nova de Lisboa and University of Oslo.

He has a PhD from the European Center for Advanced Research in Economics and Statistics (ECARES), at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB).\n\nCourse Overview\n\nRecent economic events, financial crises, the COVID crisis, the Ukraine war, rising inflation, etc., have sparked a great interest in understanding the real-time economic situation. Optimal investment decisions and economic policy choices in this rapidly shifting environment require a careful analysis of the real-time economic landscape, which is often characterized by scant, unbalanced, revised, non-seasonally adjusted, and noisy data.\n\nIn the midst of this whirlwind, analysts responsible for deciphering these complex dynamics often find themselves overwhelmed by the sea of available techniques and information, as well as the pressure to produce reliable forecasts. There's no easy guide for comparing methods, understanding data filtration, determining the number of variables for forecasting, or gauging the complexity of the models. It's within this challenging space that our course finds its purpose.\n\nStarting from the bedrock of undergraduate econometrics, this course steers students through a spectrum of techniques. It commences with fundamental ARIMA models and concludes with advanced state-of-the-art models that introduce non-linear and machine learning concepts.\n\nThe course includes computer codes written in both Matlab and Python languages. No previous knowledge of these languages is needed although some basic notions in any of them are welcomed.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBasic econometrics notions at the undergraduate level.\n\nCourse Outline\n\nBasic concepts and definitions\n\nForecasting Models\n\nARIMA Models and VARs\n\nLocal Projection\n\nStatic and Dynamic factor models\n\nNon-linear specifications: Smooth threshold and Markov switching\n\nIntroduction to Machine Learning\n\nSpecial Issues\n\nFiltering, data mining and model selection\n\nForecast evaluation\n\nForecasting with Prophet (Python)\n\nList of References\n\nThere will be specialized readings in each of the topics covered in the course, but some basic books recommended are\n\nJames Hamilton. “Time Series Analysis” Princeton.
