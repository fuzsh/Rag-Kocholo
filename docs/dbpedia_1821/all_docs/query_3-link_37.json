this edition of the “Critical Dictionary on Borders, Cross-Border Cooperation and European Integration”. Europe’s history is scarred by many wars and political tensions, which have directly affected many border regions that serve as barriers between countries. At certain times in history, cooperation across certain borders was not only unimaginable but simply impossible. This continent has always been characterised by an extremely dense number of national borders, and reducing their impact has always been a difficult task. Today, after 60 years of European integration, Europeans have accomplished a great deal by working together and bringing peace across our continent. Nevertheless, border regions continue to remain on the periphery of economic and social development\n\nBorder regions were the first to experience first-hand the freedom of movement following the introduction of Schengen, as well as the benefits of the Euro. Yet still many citizens living in these regions remain disillusioned by the European project. The European Union (EU) and member states must do far more to make them feel the added value of the EU – it is not enough to simply make the borders invisible. Many citizens living on border regions continue to face daily obstacles when crossing to other countries to find work, study or seek adequate public services such as healthcare, education and childcare.\n\nThe EU’s internal borders entail different structures, competencies, as well as social and fiscal laws, which today continue to fragment the EU. Despite all our accomplishments, borders are often considered as impenetrable barriers. Too often citizens, businesses or local and regional authorities do not pursue cross-border activities, which they feel would require too much time and effort. Consequently, many opportunities are wasted, keeping border regions perpetually constrained.\n\nBorder regions are crucial for the completion of the European Single Market, but they are far more than that. They are home to one-third of the entire European population and so need to be put at the heart ←25 | 26→of European integration. Border regions need to be places where the European integration starts and will be completed. We must not forget our external borders either, as cooperation with our neighbours, which in some cases could end up being future EU member states, is of crucial importance for the development of the EU as a whole. The European Committee of the Regions as well as the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe are institutions for which facilitating cross-border cooperation has always been a key objective.\n\nComing from the German-speaking region of Belgium which is located on the borders to the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg, I know first-hand how important cross-border cooperation is. For the European Committee of the Regions, which I have the honour to represent, and for myself personally, cross-border cooperation and strong border regions have always been essential for our future. We must insist on having cross-border cooperation as a priority for the EU – for our sake and for the sake of future generations.\n\nIt is therefore my great pleasure to have the opportunity to write the foreword for this publication, an initiative of fundamental importance for our work and of great importance for the work of the EU, its member states and local and regional authorities.\n\nWritten by many of Europe’s esteemed cross-border experts, the Critical Dictionary reflects the diversity and complexity of cross-border cooperation, the uniqueness of our many cross-border regions and the vast experience they have in connecting our continent. I am particularly impressed by the numerous maps that give a clear illustration of the phenomenon of cross-border cooperation in Europe today.\n\nIt is also a good starting point for our work on the future EU’s Multiannual Financing Framework and, importantly, with regard to European Territorial Cooperation which in the past thirty years has been essential in supporting cross-border cooperation across Europe.\n\nThe Critical Dictionary is not only essential reading for practitioners and experts in cross-border cooperation, but also for students who wish to pursue their career in this area and who want to shape the Europe of tomorrow.\n\nKarl-Heinz Lambertz\n\n←26 | 27→\n\nForeword\n\nThe current context of the COVID 19 sanitary crisis is worrying. The pandemic which started to spread from China in January 2020, making Europe its epicentre in March/April 2020, has given rise to many fundamental questions concerning our modern society, as well as the functioning of European integration and International Relations. Whereas until now, the benefits of globalization based on growing interconnection, world-wide liberal trade and mobility were largely praised, the current situation has suddenly put an emphasis again on its disadvantages. For the spread of virus has become such a world-wide danger mainly because it was uncontrollable due to the increase of mobility of people on a global level – especially with the development of mass tourism.\n\nFor Border Studies and European integration, this situation has significant consequences. If the principle of a “Europe without borders” had already been shaken by the 2015 terrorist and migration crisis in Europe, leading to bordering processes both at the external and the internal Schengen borders of the EU, these bordering processes were not always permanent nor systematic. Instead, the coronavirus has been a “bordering earthquake”. It has resulted, one by one, and nearly in all EU member states in a reflex of complete, systematic and hermetic closure of national borders, with border controls imposed not as an exceptional measure against an identified category of people – refugees, criminals or terrorists – but as a principle protection against the “other”, i.e. the person from the other national state, who might be infected by the virus. This bordering has happened without consultation at EU level and without consultation of the European people. It has caused immediate problems in European border regions which have become – as part of the European integration process – spaces of flow, mobility and communication. Cross-border transport means, tramways, trains, etc. were interrupted, cross-border workers had difficulties to get to their work-places, being hampered by numerous (new) administrative obstacles in terms of authorization papers and physical obstacles in terms ←27 | 28→of checks at the borders, cross-border relations were cut off by the border, separating colleagues, friends and families. In short, the national border (re)became a barrier impossible to overcome.\n\nIt is true that in the sanitary crisis, borders were being imposed worldwide everywhere, also nationally, in the private sphere, between “me” and the “other”, as distancing seemed the only possibility to contain the uncontrollable spread of the pandemic. However, the non-concerted national bordering measures within the EU are dangerous: they convey the message, that the sanitary threat comes from outside the nation-state, as if the virus chooses to infect nations and not individuals. As if the virus could be stopped at a national border. This logic ends up with a new “national” bordering process in the mind of the European people which might explain why even in border regions with a long experience of cross-border cooperation, for example in the Greater Region or the Upper Rhine Region, it took at least two weeks to react and to propose that patients from the overcrowded hospitals in Alsace could also be transported to the neighbouring German regions rather than to the more than a 1000 km distance away situated City of Marseille. It also explains, why the EU and the local and regional authorities seem paralyzed by the crisis. Everything is being placed back to the national level of decision: the European Commission thus took several weeks to finally determine on 16 March 2020 that the external Community borders should be secured in terms of travel restrictions into the EU. This decision was validated by the EU Council the following day, but the Council struggled to find a solution for a financial support package to help particularly heavily affected EU member states (Italy, Spain, France). It first only came up with “second best” funding measures, as some member states refused to accept the principle of collective debts. In the end, it took until the 18 May 2020 for the Franco-German couple Merkel-Macron to propose an EU rescue fund, which led the European Commission finally, on 27 May 2020, to unveil a 750 billion euros plan to help the EU recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Why has the European solidarity waited for so long? Local and regional authorities in border regions were also absent in the discussions for the crisis resolution, although there are numerous cross-border working groups on health issues in several Euregions and there exists even a Franco-Spanish cross-border hospital in Cerdagne. The situation seems all the more paradoxical when taking into account that in border regions, the interdependencies are so strong that, for example, the health system in Luxemburg or in Geneva can ←28 | 29→only function with the contribution of cross-border workers who are employed as nurses, doctors or in other functions of the health sector. Where is the European multi-level-governance? Where is our ideal of cross-border cooperation and European integration?"
