        "text": "In this work, we have analysed how neutrino decay is affected in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSI). We also considered the effect of the Majorana phase on neutrino decay in a two-flavor oscillation framework. We have examined scenarios when these sub-leading effects (NSI and decay) can be distinguished. These effects are studied on neutrino oscillation probabilities Pαβ ≡...\n\nIn the recent past, substantial effort has been devoted to exploring flavour symmetries to solve the flavour puzzle. However, traditional flavour symmetry models proved to be quite unsatisfactory. In 2017, a new 'bottom-up' approach based on modular invariance was suggested, wherein the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model become modular forms. Within this framework, we addressed the...\n\nDUNE is a leading-edge experiment for neutrino oscillation physics and is currently under construction in the United States, between Fermilab, where neutrino beam is generated, and the SURF underground laboratory, in South Dakota, hosting the Far Detector at a depth of 4,850 mwe and at a baseline of nearly 1,300 km.\n\nGRAIN (GRanular Argon for Interactions of Neutrinos) is the Liquid Argon...\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is sensitive from 0.5 GeV to the PeV energy range for astrophysical neutrino searches. In addition, the supernova Data Acquisition System (DAQ) allows the collaboration to be sensitive to close-by core-collapse supernovae at MeV energies. There exists, however, a gap between these covered energy ranges. This poster presents ongoing efforts to cover this gap. We...\n\nNeutrino experiments using liquid argon (LAr) detectors estimate the amount of light produced by different types of particles, but only consider scintillation light, at 128 nm, ignoring Cherenkov light contributions. This research aims to theoretically compare these two contributions to the total amount of light produced between ~ 128 – 500 nm for a proton travelling in LAr and explores how to...\n\nThe Central Molecular Zone is a specific region of few hundred parsecs in the centre of our Galaxy that has an estimated gas density two orders of magnitude larger than the galactic average one and represents $5\\%$ of the whole galaxy gas mass. It contains some of the most massive molecular clouds such as Sgr A, Sgr B, and Sgr C as well as potential local Pevatrons. These conditions underline...\n\nAs a pre-supernova star approaches the end of its life, neutrinos are emitted copiously with mounting energies. Although these neutrinos have a smaller luminosity compared to supernova neutrinos, they are potentially detectable by large-scale terrestrial detectors. In consideration of these neutrinos being a signal of the impending supernova, KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande have established...\n\nWe study the conditions under which the Majorana phase of the two flavor neutrino mixing matrix appears in the oscillation probabilities and causes $CP$ violation. We find that the Majorana phase remains in the neutrino evolution equation if the neutrino decay eigenstates are not aligned with the mass eigenstates. We show that, in general, two kinds of $CP$ violation are possible: one due to...\n\nCUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle Identification) is a next-generation experiment that will be located at the LNGS and will serve as an observatory for rare events. Its main goal is to search for the neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{100}$Mo. It will include an array of around 1600 cubic $45\\times45\\times45$ mm$^3$ Li$_2$MoO$_4$ enriched crystals operating as scintillating cryogenic...\n\nDetectors for low-energy particles (MeV) are often calibrated using gamma rays to induce electron-like signals. Yet the energies of standard calibration sources are often not sufficient. For instance, the JUNO reactor neutrino experiment requires excellent understanding of the energy response to energies of 8 MeV and higher. The MANGO experiment will use 9 MeV gamma rays from neutron capture...\n\nATLAS, a collider detector, can measure the flux of high-energy supernova neutrinos, which originate in the circumstellar medium from days to months after the explosion. Simulating predicted fluxes, we find at most around 0.1–1 starting events and around 10–100 throughgoing events from a supernova 10 kpc away. Possible Galactic supernovae from Betelgeuse and Eta Carinae are considered as...\n\nThe dark matter direct detection experiment XENONnT searches for rare events such as dark matter recoils and solar pp neutrino signals. It requires accurate estimates of background events. The radioactive isotope 85Kr in the target material, liquid xenon, is one of background sources. To determine its abundance accurately, delayed coincidence counting of 85Kr has been introduced. This poster...\n\nThe Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) experiment is a long baseline neutrino experiment in Japan. We measure neutrino oscillations in the T2K experiment by using an almost pure muon neutrino beam produced at J-PARC accelerator facility.

The experiment consists of two detector complexes, a near detector, ND280, to characterize the beam before oscillation and a far detector, SuperKamiokande, at 295km to measure the oscillated neutrino spectrum. One of...\n\nThe Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) experiment is a long baseline neutrino experiment in Japan which aims to measure neutrino oscillation parameters and perform a search for CP violation in the lepton sector. One of the analysis packages used to perform the neutrino oscillation fits in T2K is the Bayesian MaCh3 Markov Chain Monte Carlo package. As part of this package, external constraints can be used...\n\nOne goal of DUNE is to precisely measure the $\\nu$ oscillation parameters, with the aim of determining CP-violation in the lepton sector. To achieve this goal, it is vital to precisely reconstruct the neutrino energy, and to investigate the best projections and binning for DUNE to use. The 3D final state lepton momentum distribution can also be used to investigate oscillation sensitivity as a...\n\nLight sterile neutrinos with a mass at the eV-scale could explain several anomalies observed in short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment is designed to determine the effective electron anti-neutrino mass via the kinematics of tritium β–decay. The precisely measured β-spectrum can also be used to search for the signature of light...\n\nWe explore the connection between low-scale CP-violating Dirac phase~$(\\delta)$ and high-scale leptogenesis in a Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) with scalar bidoublet and doublets. The fermion sector of the model is extended with one sterile neutrino~$(S_L)$ per generation to implement a double seesaw mechanism in the neutral fermion mass matrix. The double seesaw is performed via the...\n\nFor Hyper-Kamiokande(HK) experiment scheduled to be operational in 2027, HK PMTs are developed. For measuring the long-term variation of HK PMTs in water, 136 HK PMTs are installed in the Super-Kamiokande water tank which is suitable for realizing an environment close to HK. This poster presents long-term gain variations of HK PMTs from 2018 to 2022\n\nModular symmetries are a novel approach to understanding the flavour structure of leptonic mixing. Using the modular $A_4$ flavour symmetry integrated into a type-II seesaw, we propose a simple and minimalistic model that restricts the neutrino oscillation parameter space. Most importantly, this setup leads to a sum rule in the physical neutrino masses. When combined with the mass squared...\n\nFor the detection of diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), the SK-Gd experiment had been started with 0.01% gadolinium (Gd) concentration (SK-VI) since August 2020, and then the concentration was increased to 0.03% (SK-VII) in July 2022. We achieved the anti-electron neutrino sensitivity by detecting the total 8MeV gamma from Gd neutron capture.\n\nWe also developed a neural network...\n\nThe ICARUS-T600 liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) detector is currently taking data at shallow depth as the far detector of the Short Baseline Neutrino program at Fermilab, to search for a possible sterile neutrino signal at $\\Delta m^{2} \\approx 1\\,\\textnormal{eV}^{2}$ with the Booster (BNB) and Main Injector (NuMI) neutrino beams.\n\nThe ICARUS trigger system exploits the...\n\nDUNE is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that will utilize a high-intensity, wide-band neutrino beam generated at Fermilab and traveling 1300 km to the Sanford Lab in South Dakota.

According to SM neutrinos interact with matter through weak interactions mediating a W or Z bosons. The models describing Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics often come with some additional unknown coupling of neutrinos termed...\n\nThe primary objective of this work is to investigate the neutrino oscillation phenomenon by utilizing wave packets within the theoretical frameworks of quantum field theory. The standard scenario involving three light neutrinos mixing is known as coherence conditions. These conditions specify that the oscillation equation obtained from plane waves precisely corresponds to the wavelet equation...\n\nIdentifying cosmic objects that emit diverse messengers, such as photons, gravitational waves, and high-energy neutrinos, would provide unique insights into the properties and processes in the Universe and its active sources.\n\nOne of the most promising sources for common gravitational wave and neutrino emission are gamma ray bursts. From the release of a huge amount of energy in cosmic...\n\nSuper-Kamiokande (SK) is known as the most sensitive detector to the supernova neutrinos originating in our galaxy.\n\nSK also has a sensitivity to neutrinos from the extra-galactic supernova within 10 Mpc from Earth, called a “mini-burst”, which is expected to occur once every few years. Recently, SN2023ixf, one of the mini-bursts, is recognized as the closest supernova in the last few years....\n\nThe identification of astrophysical sources responsible for the high-energy cosmic neutrinos is a longstanding challenge. In this context, an important breakthrough was the observation of the blazar TXS 0506+056, which was found in an enhanced gamma-ray emission state spatially and temporally coincident with an IceCube high-energy neutrino event for the first time. Subsequently, IceCube...\n\nIn this study we present the results of the searches for high-energy astrophysical neutrino point sources in the energy region above GeV using Super-Kamiokande data taken from 1996 to 2019 with total live time exceeding 6,000 days.

The detection facility of the...\n\n$U(1)$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) is well motivated, where the charges of SM fermions are fixed by gauge anomaly cancellations and Yukawa interactions. The scientific literature extensively covers the study of vector solutions in which SM fermions are vector-like under new $U(1)_X $ symmetry, allowing the Yukawa structure to remain invariant. On the other hand, chiral solutions in...\n\nWithin the DUNE next-generation neutrino oscillation experiment, the Near-Detector complex has the main aim of constraining systematic uncertainties, in order to allow precise oscillation measurements.
