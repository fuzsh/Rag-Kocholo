        "text": "OH MY GOD GUYS!!!!! GUUUUYYYYYSSSS!!!!!\n\nNEW WORLD RECOOOOOOORRRRRRDDDDDD!!!!!! :hap57:\n\nBtw did anyone notice his preparation pose before the music started.. like he lifted both arms up twice. Idk if that means anything but to me he seemed so calm and ready to put up a great show and he did!\n\nThat salchow is borderline but he stayed on his feet and it's great. I think the spread eagle was well put in a way that it helped him regain balance quick if anything.\n\nWas expecting him to start spinning already when he's starting the combination jump haha but I think it turned out ok. Just need to get used to it. And agree with B.ESP he made it look easy!\n\nI think it's possible to move the combo later in 2nd half when he's more comfortable and then probably they'd move up the spin back to the original.. idk if he has such plan though.\n\nBeautiful 3A out of a tricky entry indeed..\n\nYou gotta love that piercing eyes at the final pose. GREAT JOB!! :2thumbs:\n\nGosh the quality of it was just sublime!! There's hardly any moment when he's not doing anything.. like B.ESP said, transitions everywhere. I feel like he was so light like a feather flying through the ice. Brilliant performance put out by him.\n\nI'm so proud of him! And how's Brian managed to stay calm after that performance? I bet he's all jumping inside haha.\n\nAw after the replay ended from his piercing eyes, straight to the adorable look of him. :luv17:\n\nLOOOOVE how ecstatic Brian was (and his HOLY!!! lol) almost more than Yuzu himself haha but ofc both of them feel joyful. That hug at the end and how they kinda gave appreciation gesture to one another is so sweet and touching.\n\nI'm so glad that my feeling was proven right again by him. And isn't it crazy how the score still has potential to be a little higher?? WOW. Now hoping that his free will turn out great too. Idk if I want it to be flawless yet since it means he peaks a little early.. but best of luck anyway!\n\nWow sorry for the super long post. I got too excited.\n\nNewest Q&A. Hoping someone can do a quick translation. Thanks!\n\nI was just at it not knowing if anybody would be interested\n\nLet me know if anyone finds any mistakes. I don't think I was able to understand some parts.\n\n---------\n\nThoughts after performance\n\n- In one word, there's still tomorrow. I've never skated (the SP) without making mistakes so everybody was really worried for me. I appreciate the powerful way they supported me. Tbh, it was fun.\n\nRegarding Boyang Jin's high score\n\n- I heard the announcement in Japanese so I knew what it was but it didn't concern me. There are things that (only) I'm able to do. I was able to skate with excitement, without being concerned about making mistakes. It wasn't perfect but I landed all the jumps. I'm capable of doing more.\n\nRegarding the changed elements\n\n- I'm still planning to change the entry and landing of the 4S that would earn more GOE. I want to improve its execution. It was the first time in a while that I've been able to challenge it in a relaxed manner. It was not planned for this season. The program has become a totally different program. This was the first time I jumped the 4-3 in competition. If everything went well, I was going to include it in the latter half of the FS. I'm glad I could do it without mistakes. (In the near future) I want to do include the quad in the 2nd half.\n\nWhat kind of training have you been doing\n\n- I've been doing intense and hard training.\n\nWhat made you decide on changing the elements\n\n- I thought that I'd have to include 2 quads in the SP some day to win. I'd have to do the jumps with difficult entries, landings, steps, spins, skating with total focus until the end before I go to PyeongChang. To win consecutively as an OGM, I have to be predominantly strong. I haven't reached my goal yet.\n\nRegarding the new world record\n\n- I thought I have to be surprised by it (not sure what he means here). It's been a while since I got a score over 100 and score-wise, people might think that Hanyu is back. I was able to execute elements of highest difficulty that I'm currently capable of.\n\nAbout the new senior skaters\n\n- Starting with Uno-senshu, a lot of wonderful skaters have come up (from junior). I'm only 20 years old but I'm treated like an old man. When I'm competing with Mura-senshu, I don't think like \"he's my senpai\" but more like \"I'm definitely going to beat him\". I haven't been able to include the 4lz yet. I want to tell Jin-senshu that I'm studying him.\n\nAre 2 quads in the SP necessary?\n\nThere are skaters who can do them, and there are skaters who can't. If I were asked if they are definitely necessary, then \"definitely\" is not the answer. I was able to score over a 100 with 1 quad. If I went with 2, I'd have nothing to lose. I wish to do more than quads (something in addition to quads?).\n\nAny memories of 1998 Nagano Olympics?\n\n- It was before I started skating so I don't remember much. I don't remember the Olympics then.\n\nThoughts for the FS\n\n- I want to focus, enjoy, and do what I'm capable of doing to my full potential. I want to enjoy the feeling of joy after the SP and go about it in a relaxed manner."
