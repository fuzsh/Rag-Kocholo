        "text": "This is the original manuscript version of my 2016 Szigetvar Conference paper. The published version in the Brill volume is somewhat shorter. From the mid-fifteenth century through the early eighteenth century the Ottomans were an important player in European power politics, the only Islamic empire that challenged Christian Europe on its own territory. The Ottomans were a constant military threat to their Venetian, Hungarian, Polish-Lithuanian, Spanish and Austrian Habsburg neighbours and rivals. Ottoman expansion, itself a consequence of imperial ambitions and responses to geopolitical challenges, led to imperial rivalry with the Habsburgs in the Mediterranean and Hungary, and with the Safavids of Persia in Azerbaijan and Iraq. Ottoman conquests in the sixteenth century reshaped geopolitics in a vast area from central Europe and the Mediterranean to Greater Syria, Egypt, and Iraq. By the middle of the sixteenth century the Ottomans consolidated their conquests against both their Habsburg and Safavid rivals, and the empire's borders in Hungary saw only minor adjustments until the end of the sixteenth century. The first section of my paper briefly reviews how Süleyman's conquests and the resulting Ottoman-Habsburg rivalry in Hungary shaped power relations in the region. The second section compares the sinews of power of the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy. In the last two sections I address Ottoman and Habsburg military commitments. These sections show that the Ottomans enjoyed military superiority against their Habsburg rival during Süleyman's reign. While the Habsburg Monarchy did not have a standing field army until after the Thirty Years' War, Ottoman military pressure in Hungary forced the Viennese government to establish along the Habsburg-Ottoman border in Hungary and Croatia a permanent border defence force, which could be considered the first permanent army of the monarchy. Since the Habsburg government financed, supplied and administered the anti-Ottoman border defence in Hungary and Croatia in cooperation with the Hungarian, Croatian, Bohemian and Austrian Estates, the Ottoman challenge profoundly shaped the evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy's military, financial and state institutions.\n\nThis is the English version of my talk at EHESS (4th April 2012) during my postdoctoral research dealing with the “Changing of Balance in South-East Europe (XVth-XVIIth centuries)”. My purpose is showing the West European point of view on South-East Europe using unpublished sources (mostly Italian and French archives) and XVIth and XVIIth century european printings. According to these documents, I will make a point of the situation of the XVth-XVIIth centuries, showing how this moment is full of threats! I have also written for the Bucharest Academy “Contributions à l’étude des changements d’équilibres dans le Sud-Est européen XV°-XVII°” to make a point of my different writings dealing with this argument during my postdoctorate until 2012. Today, my purpose is to introduce you to the question of the threats of the XVth-XVIIth centuries against South-East Europe, opening a field to a next research about this interesting argument! With your support, I would be glad to continue this promising study!\n\nHistorians usually acknowledge the Ottomans’ successful early adoption of firearms, and some even term them a “gunpowder empire,” suggesting that firearms played a crucial role in the Ottoman wars of emergence. However, others maintain that the Ottomans soon lagged behind the paradigmatic states of the “military revolution” and became dependent on European military technology and weaponry. Based on a large body of unpublished source material, this essay challenges both views. It demonstrates the Ottomans’ continued flexibility in adapting and improving upon new weapons, and Istanbul’s self-sufficiency in weapons and ammunition production. Using selected sieges and battles, I argue that, in addition to firearms, factors such as good intelligence, resourceful leadership, a large and disciplined professional army, superior supply and logistics, the combined use of field artillery, infantry firepower, wagon fortresses, and cavalry charges were all important in Ottoman military successes. Regarding the possible relationship between firearms and the growth of the army, older Ottomanist literature explained the increase in the number of musket-bearing infantry janissaries with Istanbul’s need to counter Habsburg infantry volley-fire in the war of 1593-1606 in Hungary. New evidence indicates that the growth of the janissary corps was part of a general military expansion that started in the mid-sixteenth century and accelerated during the Ottomans’ “Thirty Years War” (1578-1611) against the Safavids and Habsburgs. This expansion reflected both military and socio-economic changes, and cannot be explained simply by “the challenge of the European military revolution,” indeed a reductionist reasoning bordering on technological determinism.\n\nOttoman-Russian warfare of the eighteenth century, while generally acknowledged as the causal factor necessitating a complete transformation of Ottoman society after 1800, has only begun to get the attention it needs from Ottoman historians. As a way of filling in some of the gaps, this chapter sets out the geopolitical status of the Ottomans in the eighteenth century, discusses the general difficulties facing Ottoman administrators, and then concentrates on some particulars of the two wars of Catherine II from 1768-1792. The emphasis is on manpower, military leadership and supply, especially as driven by the increasingly desperate fiscal difficulties of the Ottoman sultanate. The Ottomans had managed to hold their own against the Austrians on the Danube in the campaigns of 1736-39, because of occasional good command, astute diplomacy and the loyalty of Bosnia to Ottoman defensive needs on the European frontier. Keywords:eighteenth century; fiscal policies; geopolitical status; Ottoman military power\n\nThe period represented by the reigns of Wladyslaw II (1490–1516) and Louis II (1516–1526) in Hungary is generally characterized as a period of internal political crises, generated by noble factionalism within the kingdom. Such conditions seriously affected royal authority, including the matter of military leadership. The technological and organizational innovations associated with the ‘military revolution’, such as the development of fire arms and artillery, linear battle formations, the supremacy of infantry, an increase in the number of soldiers, the development of modern fortifications, the increased use of mercenary forces and standing armies, were slowly but steadily spreading across Europe. However, in some regions the so‐called military revolution, or aspects of it, encountered some political and economic obstacles, and Hungary under Jagiellonian rule provides us with an example of this."
