        "text": "Art\n\nArtistic works enrich Elizabeth Unique Hotel’s public spaces and rooms. Their curator is Fabrizio Russo, owner of the historical Russo Art Gallery on via Alibert, a few steps away from Piazza di Spagna. The protagonists of the collection are Italian artists, such as Enrico Benetta, who ‘writes’ sculptures where letters have a new narrative approach; Veronica Montanino and her labyrinthine hypnotic painting; and Manuel Felisi with his macro collages about a Nordic imagery of skies and forests.\n\nMichael Gambino’s evanescent graceful works, which seem to sculpt the harmonic flow of the organic matter, adorn the walls. Luca Di Luzio exhibits works from the project Atlas Ego Imago Mundi, where he portrays parts of his body as imaginary islands on an atlas. Finally, Giorgio Tentolini makes sculpture-paintings weaving metal wire creating faces, statues, details, which through the research of light are prepared for a new existence.\n\nRUSSO ART GALLERY\n\nVia Alibert, 20\n\n00187, Roma (RM)\n\nEnrico Benetta\n\nGraduated in 2001 in decoration from the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice and began his artistic journey through contemporary art. The work of Benetta is characterized by a language that moves on different stylistic registers, admirably rendered by the strong personality of the artist, full of desire to communicate, in which cultural sources distant to each other blend together. Trademark of his works, whether paintings or installations, is the typeface per excellence, Bodoni, which became the artist’s signature style, the basis for the creation of an original and random visual storyline. His first solo Incanto in 2007 following the installation Sit Up Biennale of Venice in 2009 and a personal exhibition with Galleria Russo: Levitas. Pittura nella poesia, performance and exhibition at the Roman Gallery and Verba manent scripta volant at the Milan Gallery (both 2010), Lettere diAmanti also in Milan (2011) and Lettere, Alfabeti, Grafie, curated by Beatrice Buscaroli at the Angelica Gallery of the Angelica Library accompanied by a fascinating performance with music and dance in the salone vanvitelliano. In 2011 he participated in the 54th Esposizione Internazionale d’Arte Biennale di Venezia, Padiglione Italia, ten selected artists from Fondazione Roma (Rome, Palazzo Venezia). In 2013 participated in Five Colours at Art Basel at Boutique V°73 in Miami. In 2015, in collaboration with the Biennale of Venice, he produces a new series of works for the exhibition curated by Chiara Casarin at the Venice Projects Fenice Gallery. In 2016 he participates in the exhibition Dall'oggi al domani. 24 ore nell'arte contemporanea curated by A. Sbrilli and M. G. Tolomeo, in the space of the MACRO - Museum of Contemporary Art Rome. He lives and works in Montebelluna.\n\nLuca Di Luzio\n\nHe received his BFA from the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence and his MFA from the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome. In 2009 he won the scholarship Summer Art at California State University Fresno, USA. In 2013 he had two residencies: C.A.M.A.C. in Marnay sul Seine (France) and at the Gallery Hommes in Rotterdam (Holland). In 2008 his first solo show Apparenza(e) at Art in Progress of Florence. In 2010 he was part of the group exhibition Cocktail d’arte at Segni Mutanti Arte Contemporanea of Rome and at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence. In 2013 he was selected for the collective exhibition Maps and Flags, CK12 A.I.R. Open Studio in Rotterdam. Between 2015 and 2016 he participates at other group shows organized in Rome at the Angelica Library, at MACRO, and Museo delle Mura. The same year he exhibited at The Eugeniusz Geppert Academy of Art and Design of Wroclaw, and in 2017 he was selected for From Rome, Great Far Beyond in Philadelphia (USA). In 2015 he began his Atlas Ego Imago Mundi project, printing his body on large sheets of paper, creating an imaginary atlas. The theme of this work is the human body, its profound ambiguity, and its role as the main subject of our experiencing of the world and at the same time as a part of the world, coming from the same substance. The project will be presented at the Auditorium Parco della Musica of Rome in September 2017. He lives and works in Rome.\n\nManuel Felisi\n\nHe studied at the Academy of Fine Arts of Brera. In his artworks he uses painting, photography, and collage to create the installations through which he translates and tells time. The common thread that binds his production is a topic that concerns all of us, our being and existing, here and now; time with its passing changes things, preserves them and makes them forget. His works are composed of layers of different materials that always follow the same scientific order, like a ritual – from painting to print – never to be confused with the mechanical nature and repetitiveness as it is always the result of the involvement and feelings that drive the artistic doing of Felisi. His first solo exhibition in 2002 with Biografie in which he combines painting and sculpture displayed at Spazio Isola in Milan. In 2008 with the solo exhibition Nato a Milano Lambrate curated by Alberto Mattia Martini at Fabbrica Eos of Milan. In 2010, always in Milan, he prepared another two solo exhibitions: Flowers curated by Ivan Quaroni at Fabbrica Eos and Letteralmente at the Visionnaire Design Gallery.

He lives and works in Milan.\n\nMichael Gambino\n\nItalian-american artist, he studied Science and Biology, and he graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts of Brera in the visual arts. The works of Michael Gambino are populated with rarefied three dimensional clusters of paper butterflies, patiently cut by hand and fastened to the canvas with pins, defining the geographical boundaries transient and elusive of his unpublished and personal cartography of the world made of evanescent ethereal miniature compositions, juxtaposed with a strong chromatic sensitivity. In 2012 he prepared his first personal exhibition Metamorfosi at Castello Scaligero of Malcesine (Verona). The next year, he opened the solo exhibition Beautiful flying at Galleria Colossi Arte Contemporanea. In 2013 he joined the group The Italian Wave with whom he showed in Turkey, Greece, Romania and Lithuania. In 2013 he participated in the exhibition created by the Flangini Association, in collaboration with the Italian Embassy in Washington D.C. and the Italian Institute of Culture in Washington D.C., titled Siamo quel che mangiamo – Sostenibilità e arte/ Are we what we eat? – Sustainability and Art. For the occasion his works are displayed in various prestigious buildings in Washington D.C. and Milan. For the occasion of the exhibition Mental Geography at the Ianchelevici Museum at La Louvière in Belgium some of his installations remain in a permanent manner. The next year he participated in the group exhibition I Have a Dream curated by Melissa Proietti and Raffaella A. Caruso, hosted in the rooms of Palazzo Reale in Milan. Gambino selected to use luminescence in his work, this being the central theme of the exhibition, dedicated to raise awareness on the issue of energy during the International Year of Light (2015). In the same year, he was invited to exhibit at the Museum of the Stadio di Domiziano of Roma for the occasion of the show Mafia Capitale. Roma ai tempi degli ingranaggi lubrificati. Arte Contemporanea Reattiva, curated by Antonietta Campilongo. He lives and works in Brescia.\n\nVeronica Montanino\n\nAn artist dedicated to the practice of camouflage and remix, she courts the mimicry and the ilinx, the mask and the vertigo, invites to the dizziness, the hallucination, the disorientation, to lose the univocal sense of the highway. High and low disappear, figure and background play hide-and-seek, labyrinths where you can get lost in search of a red thread that always turns out to be a false indication, a misdirection, a trap, a dead end. Gymnastics of vision that produces mirages and at the same time hides, breaking the shape, macules, stripes, stripes, tattooing what appears familiar to us, but perhaps it is not. Since 2000 she has been showing her works in solo show and collective exhibitions and she express her statement creating site-specific installations in historical buildings, such as the Capitani in Ascoli Piceno in 2006. In 2010, in the café of Palazzo Collicola Arti Visive, her work took over the entire room, incorporating furniture, the ceiling and surrounding walls; this space went on to become part of the permanent collection of the Caradente Museum. In 2011, she participated in the 54th International Art Exhibition in Venice with an installation at the Italian Pavilion of the Arsenale. In 2013, she was invited by La Casa dell’Architettura – Ex Acquario Romano to create a permanent piece for the entrance of the building. In 2016 her solo show It’s a wonderful world at the MARCA Museum of Art of Catanzaro and she created a game room as well as two other large environmental works for the MAAM Museo dell’Altro e dell’Altrove di Metropoliz in Rome. She lives and works in Rome.\n\nTommaso Ottieri\n\nHe studied architecture at the University Federico II of Naples and at the Robert Gordon School of Architecture di Aberdeen (UK). During 1966 Ottieri won a M.I.T Leonardo da Vinci’s program studying grant and decided to go to the Cicladi Island (Greece) to study the body of rules of biocompatible art and architecture. After this experience, he moved to Santorini and lived there for two years working as an architect and opening a painting workshop in Oia. Great architects and artists are his source of inspiration, beside the great master of which he tries to follow suit. His research is oriented towards the definition of highly saturated scenarios, visually and chromatically, to propose a vision of the urban landscape and to seek a role in its construction. Ottieri portrays opulent buildings and cityscapes, modern and historical at the same time, using shades of red, blue and golden yellow. His artwork seeks to achieve expressive and emotional quality. In 2003 he had the first two solo shows in Naples, and in 2006 the solo show curated by Massimo Bignardi at Galleria Rubin in Milan, and then curated by Giovanna Procaccini where it was presented at Castel dell’Ovo in Naples.

Since 2006 he started to exhibit in several group shows in Italy and abroad. The works of Tommaso Ottieri portray buildings and cityscapes that are opulent, modern and of the same historical time period, painting in the tones of red, blue and golden yellow. His works seek to achieve an expressive and emotional quality. He lives and works between Rome and Naples.\n\nSimafra\n\nRiccardo Prosperi, also known as Simafra, lives and works in his hometown Florence. He began painting in 2000, working for a Florentine workshop of restaurateurs and simultaneously studying with professor Ottavio Troiano. Since 2004 he took part in his first competitions and group exhibitions around Tuscany and in a few years he began to exhibit in Italy and abroad. Between 2008 and 2010 Simafra lived in Paris and later in Germany, working at same time with many galleries: in 2009 with Ken’s Art Gallery in Florence, the following year with Galerie Golkar in Bonn and with the Infantellina Contemporary gallery in Berlin. In 2012 he participated in Art Arsenal, the international biennial of Kiev and he founded in Florence La Bottega Moderna, an indipendent cultural space that doubled up as the artist’s studio. 2013 saw him often committed in London: there he took part in his first english group show, Odds & Sods, at Moor House Art Gallery, and later he exhibited at the Cadogan Contemporary gallery. For two years he also worked with the Galerie Virginie Barrou Planquart in Paris, with which he participated in numerous fairs around Europe. The same gallery hosted his first show in Paris in March 2015.

With a complex education that involved the study of different artistic disciplines, he graduated from the Fine Arts Academy of Brera, consolidating a suspended equilibrium between architecture and painting. He started the study of spaces and architectonic volumes with drawings of monumental figures, visualizing these with sketches and architectonic practice projects for noted studies of architecture and design. As an illustrator and draughtsman, he has collaborated with the Italian newspapers La Repubblica and Il Giornale, and he developed authoritative commissions of Sacred Art. His real essence was revealed to the public when, in 1997 the Le Macchine della Luce project was presented in a solo show at the Officina della Pressione. Then, he was present at the XIV Quadriennale of Rome and in 2005 at the Beijing Biennial. Known for his global visions, at the base of his artistic search there are the architectures of great cities that become point of departure, trace, and subject. These are metropolitan visions in black and white, characterized by a surprising painterly power and by incisive and scratching brushwork. Having done over one hundred shows and many participations in the most important national art fairs, the most recent ones are: British Black Galleria G. Biasutti Turin, Galleria Russo, Rome, Milan; Locations, Smac Gallery, Stellenbosh, Cape Town (2009); Linguaggi del Mondo, 53rd Venice Biennial, Palazzo Querini, Venice (2009); Jonathan Guaitamacchi at Campus Point, Politecnico di Milano (2010); West Lake International Art Festival, Hangzhou, China (2009); New York New York, Galleria Forni, Bologna (2008); Qualcosa di personaletrasformationi di un secolo breve, Palazzo della Borsa, Sala delle Grida-Genova (2008); Acquisitions and Exhibitions “Farnesina Collection” Ministry of External Affairs, Rome (2008).

Graduated from the University of Padua, he began exhibiting in 1985. The following year he won the first prize at the Biennale triveneta with a work for the Civic Museums and one for the Museum of Ca 'Pesaro. Starting from the early 90s, the artist's research acquires its current connotation of an ideal point of contact between a strongly European culture and a body philosophy linked to the East. Since the early years he has exhibited in Italy and abroad. In 1992 one of his works was acquired by the Pavilion of Contemporary Art (PAC) in Milan and destined for the Civic Collections of Palazzo Reale in Milan. In 1994 the project La Casa e il Tempo (in collaboration with the Credito Valtellinese Gallery) was presented at the Civic Museums of Como, Ravenna and at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Zagreb. In 1997 the anthological exhibition at the Casa dei Carraresi in Treviso dates back to 1999 and in 1999 the anthological exhibition in Vicenza. Subsequent personal exhibitions follow in public and private places on national territory. In 2005 he was invited to participate in the XIV Quadrennial in Rome. In 2009 he took part in the 53rd edition of the Venice Biennale with a solo exhibition at the Italian Pavilion and with the Aurora Western project where he reiterated the centrality of the work as the bearer of a message of a spiritual nature. The realization of exhibition projects and performances during the last fifteen and the collective exhibitions in which he took part throughout the peninsula was also very intense. On the occasion of the centenary of Futurism, he conceived the Manifesto project for a personal exhibition in 2008 and in 2009 he created the fireworks show TracciantiVetteTricolori, he presented the Futurist-designer report for the 40th anniversary of AIPI (Vicenza, Teatro Olimpico) and realized the Arte-vita project futurista (Padova) and the Futurist Grand Evening in fallow deer gloves (Padova, Teatro Stabile Verdi).

In 2016 he is selected to participate in Shakespeare in Rome organized by Galleria Russo of Rome with the patronage of the British Council for the 400th anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare. In his works Cerero Molina deconstructs and accentuates in an unsacred and ironic manner such that the represented character’s expression and gestures are emphasized and brought to your attention, rather than the portrait itself. His artistic study is centred on the double nature of the subjects he represents; his compositions and the situations in which he inserts his characters lead to a sense of jubilant spirit. He lives and works in Huelva.\n\nGiorgio Tentolini\n\nWas born in Casalmaggiore (Cremona) in 1978. He studied Graphic Arts at the Art Institute Toschi in Parma, and graduated in Design and Communication from the Università del Progetto in Reggio Emilia. After internships with artists like Marco Nereo Rotelli, he began a personal research with photographic installations, obtaining significant art prizes. Each of his works stems from a specific research on Time as memory and identity, in a careful and slow reconstruction that takes place with the study of light and the etching of layers of different materials such as fabric, paper, PVC. Tulle and masking tape are the current medium of his research for the meditative levity that they put into the image, a metaphor of places and memories, dreams and visions. A pictorial work which crosses the frontier of reality of sculpture. He won the Price Nocivelli in 2012, and the Price Rigamonti in the section Visual Art, organized by Foundation San Fedele of Milan, also he won the First Price of Paratissima Torino 2015 and the Special Price Arteam Cup 2016, Tentolini showed in London, Berlin, Amsterdam, in the Principality of Monaco, he exhibited at the Palazzo Reale in Milan, at MAR.
