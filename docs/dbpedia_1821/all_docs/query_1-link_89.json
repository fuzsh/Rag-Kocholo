        "text": "Just got out of my test. Was not too bad.\n\nAnyways, while I could set up the livestream, I WAS able to follow through the live results. The protocols were put up about 10 minutes before the start of the test. While I haven't watched the videos yet, based on the score and the placements of the men, I will say this:\n\n1. Aw! Jason! :'( At least it's not worlds and you can redeem yourself in the FP!\n\n2. Looks like Nam's SP wasn't spicy as usual today.\n\n3. Yay Josh for smashing your personal best by about over 8 points!\n\n4. WHOOP WHOOP Denis for killing your PB and getting 97+!\n\n5. Yay Misha! Getting more than 80 points! He's definitely improving!\n\n6. Adam....\n\n7. Whoa....Shoma looks like he's rising to the challenge, he's definitely showing how to compete. From breaking the junior level score to getting 2nd in the SP at the 4CC, wow, he's going to be someone to watch out for in the next quad.\n\nNam, Jason and Adam are paying for the lessons of including quads in their SP while Misha is in his comfort zone.\n\nnam fell on 3A and he was doing it whole season, jason UR his 3A and adam never was consistent even without quad, so they didnt only mess up with their quads, its true that it may affect their programs but fact remains, i want to add i love all 3 of them and misha wasnt consistent either up until this season and doing great so far\n\nHere's a subplot for us to consider as the competition heads to the long.\n\nSomeone had done the math before things got revved up, and Josh needs to finish 4th or better to earn one of the seeded positions at Worlds.\n\nThat SP is magnificent. I want to check the protocols to see if the spin levels were fixed after USNats. Unfortunately, protocol link not working for me.\n\nFrom the videos I've watched, the scores were not inflated, and this beat the pants off Euros.\n\nI think, to be on the complete safe side, he needs to make the podium. IMO, he should have been slightly ahead of Mura, which means he would be 4th. If he keeps it together in the LP, he should have a good shot at making it\n\nI am happy Jason included a 4T even though it wasn't perfect by all means. Still paying a price too big...but I know these are the protocols. Had he done his 3 Lz he would have had many more points. I don't understand...It is very good he tried the 4T but why start in the short? In a long program it would have hurt less...\n\nOn the funny, personal side, I ruined my whole night to see the men and both Kazakh and Chinese websites start stuttering for the last 2 groups. I had no idea Jason tried a 4T. All I could guess was that he didn't fall. I saw the score dropping like an avalanche. I got stunned and close the lid over my macbook. Too late to sleep, I had to get up and make the coffee...\n\nHere's a subplot for us to consider as the competition heads to the long.\n\nSomeone had done the math before things got revved up, and Josh needs to finish 4th or better to earn one of the seeded positions at Worlds.\n\nThat SP is magnificent. I want to check the protocols to see if the spin levels were fixed after USNats. Unfortunately, protocol link not working for me.\n\nFrom the videos I've watched, the scores were not inflated, and this beat the pants off Euros.\n\nCopied first from US nats SP scoresheet & 4CC (sorry if it's not the easiest to read , they're written differently):\n\n(BV, GOE, Total)\n\nChange Foot Sit Spin Change Foot Sit Spin 4- 3.00 1.00 4.00\n\nChange Foot Combination Spin Change Foot Comb. Spin 2 (three pos.)- 2.50 1.50 4.00\n\nFly. Camel Spin Fly. Camel Spin 4- 3.20 1.36 4.56\n\nCSSp4- 3.00 0.86 3.86\n\nCCoSp3p4- 3.50 1.00 4.50\n\nFCSp4- 3.20 0.79 3.99\n\nnam fell on 3-3 and he was doing it whole season, jason UR his 3A and adam never was consistent even without quad, so they didnt only mess up with their quads, its true that it may affect their programs but fact remains, i want to add i love all 3 of them and misha wasnt consistent either up until this season and doing great so far\n\nBut the quad can affect your other jumps too. That's part of the lesson -- learning how to not let the quad affect the rest of your performance. Had Jason done his usual quadless program, he would have scored a lot better. That's the whole reason Jason's team opted out of the quad for most of the season. Same with Nam."
