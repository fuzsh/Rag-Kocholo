        "text": "You could call it the Nobel Prize for new music: The Ernst von Siemens Music Foundation celebrates two young groups with its ensemble prize in 2024. Both share the curiosity to break boundaries and to re-frame music. Frankfurt’s instrumental group Broken Frames Syndicate turns concert conventions upside down using new media, staging and visual design, discovering musical gems where you would not expect them. Frames Percussion, six percussionists from Barcelona, experiment with the endless possibilities of conventional as well as new, acoustic and digital percussion instruments.\n\nThe two ensembles each arrange half a concert with music of our time from different continents. A highlight of the programme is Francesco Filidei’s bizarre opera pastiche in which a narrator recites an opera buffa libretto with bizarre, raucous background music. A humorous conclusion to a sensory, diverse evening of contemporary music with two excellent ensembles – over a drink, in a relaxed atmosphere in the Pantheon Theatre."
