I'm thinking that we will spend the first part of the trip in Barcelona, and then head to the Catalan Pyrenees after that. There are a couple of parks that look wonderful (Parc Natural del Cadí-Moixeró, Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa), but I worry that hiking won't be great that time of the year because of snow melt and potentially muddy paths. Am I overthinking this? Are there other places that are better for hiking at this time of year?\n\nAlso, I'm open to other nearby excursions of any kind if anyone wants to throw out any helpful recommendations.\n\nThank you.\n\n-David"
