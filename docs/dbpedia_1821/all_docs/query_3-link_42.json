A celebration of architecture and design, this is the largest event of its kind in Poland, offering unique networking and discussion opportunities for architects and designers, investors, developers, manufacturers, and city authorities from Poland and abroad. Among a huge range of events, panels and exhibitions, topics will include several issues close to OPG Property Professionals' ethos, from the social dimension of revitalization to \"a recipe for mixed-use\". The programme will also include sessions under the slogan \"Green Buildings\" and the establishment of a Forum of Sustainable Construction Experts to create a list of key recommendations that will accelerate the green revolution in the construction industry in Poland. Registration is available at the link: https://lnkd.in/dykDXTiJ The programme schedule is available here: https://lnkd.in/dfXCqDi9 Sessions will also be available to be viewed online. #4designdays #architecture #design #conference #discussion #katowice #poland #revitalization #networking #sustainability #mixeduse\n\nThe European Architectural Barometer on sustainability is now live! Our experts have delved deep into the minds of European architects, focusing on the topic of sustainability ðŸŒ± In this edition, we've discovered how different countries across Europe are embracing sustainable practices. When it comes to the willingness to invest in sustainability, it looks like the Netherlands is taking the lead, with 47% of clients asking architects about sustainability. We are hoping that this number will grow from now on in each country. The USP of the European Architectural Barometer is that it's the most comprehensive quarterly research of its kind, providing invaluable insights into the thoughts, trends, and challenges shaping the architectural world across Europe. ðŸ“ž Drop me a message if you want to book your free consultation on this topic. #ConstructionInsights #EuropeanArchitecturalBarometer #SustainabilityMatters\n\nOn June 10, 1926, one of the reasons I love visiting Barcelona passed away: Antoni GaudÃ­. I am not an expert in architecture, but I have spent some time reading a lot about innovation, and GaudÃ­ was an innovator for three reasons: ðŸ§  Knowledge: He knew very well what he was doing. His expertise (evidently combined with his talent) was such that he rarely made detailed plans for his works. ðŸ”— Connected systems: Although the general systems theory was articulated in 1937, one might think that GaudÃ­ applied the principle of relationship considering that he conceived his buildings in a global manner, addressing structural, functional, and decorative solutions. ðŸ“¤ Thinking out of the box: He innovated when everyone else was doing so and still stood out among the rest. During the modernism period, he combined his passion for nature and geometric shapes, making his creations seem like something out of a fairy tale. For some time now, I have been dedicated to creating things, and GaudÃ­ is one of those references I return to when I feel like I am swimming in a red ocean or simply not progressing at the speed I want.\n\nLet's extend a warm welcome to Margarita Bedmar GonzÃ¡lez / Licensed Architect! She officially became part of our Facade Design team at the end of last year, and we are thrilled to kick off the new year with her on board. Join us in recognizing Margarita's commitment to architecture and sustainability, and give her a warm welcome to the team! Bienvenida! As a bonus, we're taking this opportunity to share some of her responses as part of the #SNYLturns20 team highlight. When did you first become interested in architecture or engineering as a career? ðŸŽ¤\"Since I was a kid I was always interested in architecture, but one of the moments that stuck with me was visiting the Alhambra when I was 8 or 9 years old on a school field trip and thinking I wanted to create spaces like that.\" What kind of projects do you want to work in the future? ðŸŽ¤\"I would love to work in museums, civic centers, and libraries and be able to influence the design of the facade to create a more energy-efficient and beautiful envelope.\" Which one of your current projects excites you the most? ðŸŽ¤\"All the museums. They have always been on my bucket list.\" What is the most effective step youâ€™ve taken in your work toward a more sustainable built environment? ðŸŽ¤\"For me, there are no \"specific steps\" that I've had to take to work towards a more sustainable built environment; studying architecture in Spain taught me that designing with sustainability in mind is the only way. But I do take time to keep up with codes, laws, and sustainable initiatives in the construction industry.\" What are you reading or listening to right now? ðŸŽ¤\"I am reading Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself by Joe Dispenza\"\n\nI have served on a few juries for architectural awards and competitions over the years, and Iâ€™ve seen that the quality of the jury determines the quality of the project or initiative that has an award bestowed on it. In the local and international architecture industry, the participation in awards and competitions is a hotly contested topic. Not everyone wants to participate, for various reasons. Architectural awards these days often feel like commercialised events with little peer review credibility. There is a growing number of â€˜industry awardsâ€™, many of them emanating from marketing companies based in the UK or the Middle East. These have limited or no track record, and no real credibility. The bottom line is that you can â€˜buyâ€™ an award if you purchase enough sponsorship. Itâ€™s a MICE industry outgrowth into the world of design, and everyone wants their 15 minutes of Andy Warhol fame. Back to Award Juries: they can be as toxic as an average Thursday at mid-level architecture school studio, or as profound and challenging as the best moments of mature practice. Depends on who is in the room. I donâ€™t mean to rain on anyoneâ€™s parade; all Iâ€™m saying is that they are a hit-and-miss business and should never be the reason we get out of bed in the morning. At DataScape Architects Africa, we believe awards are, at best, a by-product of practice. We focus on delivering meaningful, impactful work that resonates with our clients and communities. Itâ€™s about creating spaces that matter, not chasing trophies. Letâ€™s prioritise the value of our work over the pursuit of accolades. Whatâ€™s your take?\n\nðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· FRENCH PROPERTY EXHIBITION, London, 27th and 28th of January 2024 What an amazing experience we had at the French Property Exhibition, in London. âœ¨ For the first time ever, Sweetch has been presented the public in a face-to-face event.
