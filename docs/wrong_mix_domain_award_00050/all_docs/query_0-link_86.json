        "text": "@Neverhappened\n\n\"Ashkenazi Jews are hugely over-represented. Is there a genetic component? \"\n\nThat Eastern European Jews are more intelligent than the rest of the population or that some races are more intelligent than others? That was a widely held belief well into the twentieth century .,The scientific justifications were called 'racialism\" and 'eugenics', each highly valued by the Third Reich\n\nIn the latter 20th century there was an American psychologist who 'proved' black children were less intelligent than white children..He proved that by giving the same IQ tests first to middle class white kids, then to black kids from the ghetto.\n\nIf one pays attention, one will notice that there seems to be a disparity of asian in kids who are prodigies of various kinds.\n\nJust smarter? I'm sure some are. However, it's more likely that the parent is pushing the kid .Hence the stereotypical 'tiger parenting'\n\nIt is a lifetime observation here in Oz that education is revered among the asian people I've known .eg common for parents who were say Vietnamese rice farmers to have several kids, all of whom go to university and do law or one of the hard sciences, especially medicine .\n\nAlthough middle class Aussies understand the importance of eduction, their attitude is relatively casual. Working class families, such as my own, are not all that fussed with tertiary education. .\n\nMy dad's family arrived here in South Australia in 1870. However, I was the first member of dad's family to attend university--even then I had to study part time whilst working full time.\n\nMy attitude today is that education IS the magic bullet. I'm aware doing say liberal arts is no guarantee of a decent job. However, it is my opinion that it is much harder without some of degree. At least her in Oz.\n\n((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((0)))))))))))))))))))))\n\nTIGER PARENTING\n\nTiger parenting is strict or demanding parenting. Tiger parents push and pressure their children to attaining high levels of academic achievement or success in high-status extracurricular activities such as music, using authoritarian parenting methods.[1] The term \"tiger mother\" (虎妈 or \"tiger mom\") was coined by Yale Law School professor Amy Chua in her 2011 memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.[2] A largely Chinese-American concept, the term draws parallels to strict parenting styles typically enforced throughout households in East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia.[3][4][5][6][7] Since the rise of Amy Chua's memoir and the tiger mom phenomenon into the American mainstream during the early 2010s, the tiger mom has been a caricatured figure in modern Chinese society as well as in Overseas Chinese communities around the world. Chua's rise to fame quickly popularized the concept and term \"tiger mother\" spawning numerous caricatures while also becoming the inspiration for the 2014-2015 Singaporean TV show Tiger Mum, the 2015 mainland Chinese drama Tiger Mom, and the 2017 Hong Kong series Tiger Mom Blues. The stereotyped figure often portrays a Chinese mother who relentlessly drives her child to study hard, to the detriment of the child's social and physical development, and emotional well-being.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_parenting\n\nRACE AND INTELLIGENCE\n\nThe history of the race and intelligence controversy concerns the historical development of a debate about possible explanations of group differences encountered in the study of race and intelligence. Since the beginning of IQ testing around the time of World War I, there have been observed differences between average scores of different population groups, but there has been no agreement about whether this is mainly due to environmental and cultural factors, or mainly due to some genetic factor, or even if the dichotomy between environmental and genetic factors is the most effectual approach to the debate.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, group differences in intelligence were assumed to be racial in nature;[1] apart from intelligence tests, research relied on measurements such as brain size or reaction times. By the mid-1940s most psychologists had adopted the view that environmental and cultural factors predominated. In the mid-1960s, physicist William Shockley sparked controversy by claiming there might be genetic reasons that black people in the United States tended to score lower on IQ tests than white people. In 1969 the educational psychologist Arthur Jensen published a long article with the suggestion that compensatory education had failed to that date because of genetic group differences. A similar debate among academics followed the publication in 1994 of The Bell Curve by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray. Their book prompted a renewal of debate on the issue and the publication of several interdisciplinary books on the issue. One contemporary response was a report from the American Psychological Association that found no conclusive explanation for the observed differences between average IQ scores of racial groups\""
