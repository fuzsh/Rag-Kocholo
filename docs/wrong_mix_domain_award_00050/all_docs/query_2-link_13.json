        "text": "On December 30th 1865, Kipling was born in Bombay to an artist and teacher (his father). He was soon shipped off to England where he pursued his education under the care of his foster family. He returned to India in ‘82 as a journalist, and wrote poetry and fiction in his free time. During this period, “Plain Tales form the Hills” (1888) grew popular in England, and so he returned to England in ‘89. After his union in marriage with Caroline Balestier in ‘92, they went to live in Vermont, USA. This is where he wrote “The Jungle Book” as his two daughters were just beginning their lives.Family issues lead him back to Sussex, and in 1896 his son, John, was born.\n\nKiploings growing popularity with all of his short stories and poems drew many honors to himself, but the only recognisable one he accepted was the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1915, Jon went MIA while serving the Irish Guards, which lead Kipling to write “The Irish Guards in the Great War.” This was a hard fact for him to accept, as it was his only son.\n\nRudyard Kipling died in 1936 at age 70."
