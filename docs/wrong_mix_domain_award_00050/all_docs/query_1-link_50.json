        "text": "Rudyard Kipling was an English writer and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. He is best known for his poems and stories set in India during the period British imperial rule.\n\nKipling was born in Bombay, but educated in England. In 1882, aged sixteen, he returned to Lahore, where his parents then lived. He worked for Anglo-Indian newspapers there.\n\nHis literary career began with ‘Departmental Ditties’ published in 1886. His children’s books are classics of children’s literature. Rudyard Kipling wrote the most famous children’s book in world history- ‘The Jungle Book’ in 1894.\n\nIn 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in consideration of the power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas and remarkable talent for narration.\n\nHis other works are ‘Stalky and Co.’, ‘Kim’ and ‘Puck of Pook’s Hill’. The ‘Just So Stories’ were originally written for his daughter Josephine, who died of pneumonia aged six.\n\nRudyard Kipling died on 18th January, 1936."
