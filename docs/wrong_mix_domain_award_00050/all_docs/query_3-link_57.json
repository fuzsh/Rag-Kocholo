        "text": "A unique handwritten, signed manuscript copy of Rudyard Kipling's 1901 poem The Young Queen\n\nWritten to commemorate the consolidation of Australian Crown Colonies into the Commonwealth of Australia\n\nRudyard Kipling (1865 - 1936) was an English writer and poet whose most famous works include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901), The Man Who Would Be King (1888) and If (1910).\n\nIn 1907 Kipling became the first English language writer awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and his influential works remain highly popular and in print to this day.\n\nSouvenir manuscript penned entirely in Kipling's hand, signed at the conclusion 'R.K'.\n\nComprising the complete text of this poem 'The Young Queen', on both sides of a gray-green 7x9 sheet, no date (circa 1901).\n\nThe poem refers to the consolidation of self-governing Australian Crown Colonies into a single nation - the Commonwealth of Australia - on 1st January 1901. Kipling wrote the poem to commemorate the historic occasion.\n\nWhile examples of Kipling's work in his own hand are uncommon and of great desirability, the length and historical significance of the present item elevate it to a level of unusual importance.\n\nA very unique item in fine condition, with mild toning and bisecting folds with small edge separations not affecting any text.\n\nClick here to discover more about this item.\n\nFree global shipping. 28-day returns. Certificate of Authenticity and our Lifetime Moneyback Guarantee of Authenticity included."
