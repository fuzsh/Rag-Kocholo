Born on December 30, 1965, in Mumbai, Kiplingâ€™s remarkable work in the field of literature has been praised for generations. Famous for his children's books, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907, becoming the first English-language writer to receive the prize. Kipling, who won the Nobel Prize at 41, is the youngest recipient of the award till date. The legendary writer breathed his last on January 18, 1936.\n\nAs we observe his 84th death anniversary, here are five of his remarkable works one must read.\n\nThe Jungle Book\n\nThe Jungle Book is a collection of stories and most of the characters in this book are animals.

The poem is about a soldier, who recalls the time he felt liberated and had a Burmese girlfriend, who is now very far way. The poem, set in Burma, was immortalised after it was set to music by Oley Speaks in 1907.\n\nGunga Din\n\nGunga din, a poem published in 1890, is a rhyming narrative from the point of view of an English soldier in India.
