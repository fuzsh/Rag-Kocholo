        "text": "Movies can be a source of entertainment and inspiration, and can sometimes even teach you a thing or two. But few movies are able to accomplish that feat at the same time. And so we’re here with a list of the 10 best movies on Nobel Prize winners.\n\nThe Nobel Prize, established by Alfred Nobel in 1901, is one of the most prestigious awards in existence. Nobel Prizes are awarded in the fields of literature, physics, chemistry, medicine, and peace, to only the most accomplished people in the respective fields.\n\nThere have been several renowned Nobel prize winners in history, from Albert Einstein and Martin Luther King to Malala Yousafzai. Their achievements can be a great learning tool, but not everyone wants to read a biography. A movie, on the other hand, is short, entertaining, and gets to the point quickly.\n\nWith that in mind, dive in to check out 10 popular movies on Nobel Prize winners.\n\n1. A Beautiful Mind\n\nRelease Year: 2001\n\nCast: Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany, Ed Harris, Josh Lucas\n\nA Beautiful Mind is widely considered among the greatest biographical movies ever made. The film is based on the life of mathematician John Nash (Russell Crowe).\n\nJohn Nash was a gifted individual whose groundbreaking work in mathematics and economics won him the Nobel Memorial Prize in economic sciences. Nash was also a schizophrenic and spent several years in and out of psychiatric institutions. A movie about a Nobel Prize winner with schizophrenia is a rarity these days.\n\nThankfully, his wife, Alice Esther Nash (Jennifer Connelly), stood by him through his tumultuous phase. She went on to win an Academy Award for her portrayal of Alice, and the film itself bagged three other awards: Best Picture, Best Director for Ron Howard, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nIf you’re looking for some truly inspiring yet hard-hitting drama, be sure to watch A Beautiful Mind.\n\n2. Invictus\n\nRelease Year: 2009\n\nCast: Morgan Freeman, Matt Damon, Marguerite Wheatley, Tony Kgoroge\n\nNelson Mandela is a name familiar to most people on the planet. After Mahatma Gandhi, Mandela is probably the person synonymous with fighting against oppression through non-violent means.\n\nBorn in South Africa during the apartheid era, Nelson Mandela fought for reforms all his life and eventually became the country’s first head of state. Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to abolish racial segregation in South Africa.\n\nInvictus is based on a real-life incident from Mandela’s life—the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Veteran Hollywood filmmaker Clint Eastwood directed Invictus.\n\nInvictus was a critical and commercial hit and should be on the watchlist of anyone seeking a feel-good yet inspiring sports drama.\n\n3. Selma\n\nRelease Year: 2014\n\nCast: David Oyelowo, Oprah Winfrey, Cuba Gooding Jr.\n\nMartin Luther King was another major proponent of Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violent methods to achieve reform. King was an American reverend who led the civil rights movement in the ‘50s and ‘60s to end widespread discrimination against African-Americans. King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, just four years before he was assassinated.\n\nAva DuVernay’s Selma is a historical drama film inspired by the 1965 Selma to Montgomery protest marches. Several civil rights activists participated in the march while braving stiff resistance from the security forces. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n4. Radioactive\n\nRelease Year: 2019\n\nCast: Rosamund Pike, Sam Riley, Anya-Taylor Joy\n\nPolish-French scientist Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first and only woman to win the award twice, once in physics and the other time in chemistry.\n\nAs a scientist, Curie had to fight through a male-dominated field to succeed in her life, but she didn’t give up. It was only a matter of time before someone made a movie about her inspiring life.\n\nRadioactive takes some creative liberties with Curie’s life but is an entertaining and informative watch regardless.\n\n5. Kundun\n\nRelease Year: 1997\n\nCast: Gyurme Tethong, Tenzin Thutob, Tulku Jamyang\n\nThere have been several movies depicting the life of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, but none match the scale and quality of Kundun.\n\nDirected by legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese, Kundun is based on the life of the Dalai Lama and covers the many stages of his life.\n\nFeaturing beautiful cinematography and performances, Kundun was critically acclaimed upon its release. As for the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader is currently living in exile in India and continues to fight for Tibet’s autonomy. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\n6. I’m Not There\n\nRelease Year: 2007\n\nCast: Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, Ben Whishaw\n\nBob Dylan is one of the most influential singers of all time. He is known for his thoughtful songs like \"Like a Rolling Stone.\" Dylan won the Nobel Prize for Literature for his lyrics in 2016.\n\nDylan was also a prominent civil rights movement supporter and lived an extraordinary life that could only be complimented by an equally extraordinary movie. Todd Hayne’s 2007 musical drama I’m Not There features six different actors playing the singer.\n\nI’m Not There follows an unconventional narrative and may not be for everyone. But the film is really thrilling to watch.\n\n7. The Lady\n\nRelease Year: 2011\n\nCast: Michelle Yeoh, David Thewlis, Benedict Wong\n\nThe Lady is a biographical film inspired by Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi. She brought democratic reforms to her country (previously Burma) through non-violent means. Suu Kyi’s perception has changed over the years, but we can’t deny all the good work she did for Myanmar. After all, she won a Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts.\n\nLuc Besson directed The Lady, and the film received positive reviews from the audience who appreciated Yeoh’s fabulous onscreen portrayal of Suu Kyi.\n\n8. He Named Me Malala\n\nRelease Year: 2015\n\nCast: Malala Yousafzai, Khushal Yousafzai, Ziauddin Yousafzai\n\nHe Named Me Malala is a documentary film based on the Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai. She was just 15 when the Taliban shot her in the head for speaking out in favour of girls’ rights.\n\nMiraculously, Malala fought through and survived. She went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 at the age of 17, becoming the youngest person to do so.\n\nHe Named Me Malala stars the young activist as herself as she recounts her struggle towards fighting for girls' education and her heartrending survival story. The film is directed by acclaimed filmmaker David Guggenheim.\n\n9. Rabindranath Tagore\n\nRelease Year: 1961\n\nCast: Raya Chatterjee, Sovanlal Ganguli, Smaran Ghosal\n\nRabindranath Tagore is an Indian documentary film written and directed by Satyajit Ray. As the name suggests, Rabindranath Tagore is inspired by the life and works of the titular literary.\n\nRabindranath Tagore was a Bengali author who became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. While Tagore was an accomplished writer, playwright, composer, painter, and philosopher, he won the award for his collection of poetry, Gitanjali.\n\nTagore is also known for writing and composing the national anthems of India and Bangladesh. One could argue that a feature film would better portray the impactful life of Rabindranath Tagore, but the documentary does a remarkable job as well. Plus it’s directed by Satyajit Ray, the greatest Indian filmmaker of all time. That’s reason enough to give Rabindranath Tagore a watch.\n\n10. My Boy Jack\n\nRelease Year: 2007\n\nCast: Daniel Radcliffe, David Haig, Carey Mulligan, Kim Cattrall\n\nMy Boy Jack is a 2007 biographical television film based on Rudyard Kipling’s relationship with his only son, Jack. Kipling was a British novelist best known for writing The Jungle Book. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1907.\n\nMy Boy Jack centers on Jack Kipling’s ambition to join the Royal Navy. Rudyard used his influence to get Jack inducted into the Irish Guards despite his poor eyesight. What followed was a powerful tale of bravery and heartbreak.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSo that’s the list of the 10 best movies on Nobel Prize Winners. We have mapped out esteemed individuals from all fields, ranging from science, literature, and activism. Let their lives be an inspiring light for you. That being said, don’t forget to check out the aforementioned movies."
