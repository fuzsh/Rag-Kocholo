        "text": "An exceedingly odd poem\n\nI’ve never known quite what to make of Rudyard Kipling. Indeed my debut novel ‘A Rising Man’ takes its title from a line in Kipling’s work about Calcutta, ‘City of Dreadful Night’.\n\nThe author of timeless favourites such as the Jungle Book and Kim, and the youngest ever winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, and yet, there’s no denying that he was a cheerleader for empire. Indeed, his poem, ‘The White Man’s burden’ is a paean to the racist, exploitative endeavour of colonialism, turning it on its head to argue that colonisation was a burden and a moral duty of the white man, and a benefit to the peoples they ruled over.\n\nThere are many who say that he was a product of the prejudices of his time, but I’ve never been comfortable with that line of reasoning. In my opinion it’s a cop out which is applied to far too many of our ‘heroes’, and yet Kipling is one of the very few authors writing in the era of British India whose work has come down to us. In that, he offers us a glimpse into that time and place.\n\nWhat’s more, how do we reconcile the lines of The White Man’s Burden with those of another of his poems, ‘Gunga Din’, where the white soldier, saved by an Indian whom he’s berated for years, admits that the Indian is the better man?\n\nKipling was obviously a complex figure whom I need to learn more about. In the meantime, here’s a poem of his which I came across a few years ago. It’s called ‘What Happened’, and is the tale of an Indian barrister who successfully fights against the laws forbidding Indians to carry weapons. He beats the British at their own game, in their courts, and the poem seems to encapsulate the condescending attitude of Kipling (and many other British people’s views of the time) towards Bengalis as being too smart for their own good.\n\nIf you read between the lines, you can sense the indignation that uppity natives would dare challenge the British by turning their own laws against them. As you’d expect, the native barrister can’t be allowed to win, and so suffers a grisly fate at the hands of less enlightened natives.\n\nAnd the ‘hero’ of the piece? Well he might have been an ancestor of mine."
