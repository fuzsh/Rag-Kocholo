        "text": "But Who Shall Return Us Our Children? -\n\nA KIPLING PASSION by John Muehleisen\n\n​Collaboration with the National World War I Museum​\n\nJournalist, poet, novelist, and Nobel Prize winner Rudyard Kipling is best known for works of fiction like “The Jungle Book,” “Kim,” and his many short stories. Less well known is the impact the First World War had on Kipling and how it irrevocably changed his family. In this new oratorio, American composer John Muehleisen explores the costs of war from the point of view of the families left behind. Weaving letters, prose and poetry into a one-hour passion setting, the work explores how the devastated Kiplings find peace in the wake of son John’s September 1915 death at the Battle of Loos at age 18. Scored for soprano, tenor, and bass soloists with choir and chamber orchestra, this moving world premiere shines a new spotlight on the sacrifice of not only our warriors, but their families.\n\n​TICKETS $25 GENERAL ADMISSION\n\n$10 STUDENT TICKETS AVAILABLE AT THE DOOR​​\n\nSaturday, April 29, 7:30 pm\n\nJ.C.
