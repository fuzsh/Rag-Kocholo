It is a literary example of Victorian-era stoicism. The poem, first published in Rewards and Fairies. It is written in the form of paternal advice; and perhaps here, I too am attempting in some way to communicate this to my beautiful children; Salma and Rahi @virtuerahi. Although Kipling has been labelled a colonialist, a racist, an anti semite, a misogynist and much more, nevertheless he was a highly gifted writer. Kipling remains politically toxic (The New Yorker 1 July 2019). Music: Rainbow Dreams- by Terry Devine-King. Voice: Bijan Daneshmand. If such clips interest you, there are more at Voice of a Friend on YouTube. #bijandaneshmand #rudyardkipling #nobelprize #poetry\".",
