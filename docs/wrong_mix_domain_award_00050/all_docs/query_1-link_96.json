        "text": "Three of the most-loved children’s stories by Rudyard Kipling, all beautifully illustrated by Ian Beck\n\nEach volume contains extra material for young readers, including a profile of the author, a section on the book, a list of characters, a glossary and a test-yourself quiz.\n\nThe Jungle Books\n\nThis special edition contain The Jungle Book and The Second Jungle Book. All the stories are set in India and feature animals. They include the well-known ‘Rikki-Tikki-Tavi’, which describes the struggles of a mongoose against venomous cobras.\n\nThe Just So Stories\n\nOriginally told by Rudyard Kipling to his children at bedtime, this compendium of witty tales imagines how animals came to be as they are now. Discover how the massive whale got a tiny throat by swallowing a mariner, how the lazy camel got a hump so that he had no excuse not to work, and why the leopard’s spots were painted on. This edition features Kipling’s iconic original illustrations.\n\nKim\n\nKimball O’Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier, spends his childhood on the bustling streets of Lahore, begging and running errands in order to survive. One day he meets an old Tibetan lama, and he decides to accompany him on his travels across the Indian subcontinent. After falling into the hands of his father’s old regiment, however, Kim is separated from the lama and sent away to school. There, his natural flair for espionage is spotted, and he is soon catapulted among the majestic peaks of the Himalayas to play his part in the secret service’s confrontation with Russia, the so-called “Great Game”."
