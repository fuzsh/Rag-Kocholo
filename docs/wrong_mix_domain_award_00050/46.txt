Rudyard Kipling

Rudyard Kipling worked as a journalist in India from 1882 to 1888, publishing in his final year abroad six short-story collections, among them The Phantom Rickshaw and Wee Willie Winkie. For four years in the 1890s he lived in his wife’s native Vermont, where he learned the art of the “small things…buying yeast cakes and being lectured by your neighbors.” Kipling also wrote The Jungle Book, The Second Jungle Book, and Captains Courageous. At the age of forty-two in 1907, he became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.
