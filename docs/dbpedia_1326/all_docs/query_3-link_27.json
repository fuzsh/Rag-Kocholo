        "text": "Maintaining correct sensorimotor integration relies on rapid modifications of activity. The cerebellum is instrumental herein, evidenced by the fact that disruptions of cerebellar functioning, for example through stroke or neurodegenerative disorders, affect coordination and adaptation of many types of behaviors such as gait, eye movements and speech (Ackermann et al., 1992; Bodranghien et al., 2016). The palette of behavioral parameters controlled by the cerebellum is also broad and includes features like timing (Raymond et al., 1996; De Zeeuw and Yeo, 2005; Yang and Lisberger, 2014), strength (Hirata and Highstein, 2000; Witter et al., 2013), as well as coordination of muscle activity (Thach et al., 1992; Vinueza Veloz et al., 2015). However, the pluriformity of behavioral features does not match with the homogeneity of the structure and cyto-architecture of the cerebellar cortex.\n\nRecently, it has been uncovered that the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, the Purkinje cells (PCs), can be divided into two main groups with a distinct firing behavior (Xiao et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014). One group, consisting of PCs that are positive for the glycolytic enzyme aldolase C, also referred to as zebrin II (Brochu et al., 1990; Ahn et al., 1994), shows relatively low simple spike firing rates, whereas the PCs in the other group that form zebrin-negative zones, fire at higher rates (Zhou et al., 2014). Zebrin II demarcates olivocerebellar modules, anatomically defined operational units each consisting of a closed loop between the inferior olive, parasagittal bands of the cerebellar cortex and the cerebellar nuclei (Sugihara and Quy, 2007; Ruigrok, 2011). Given that different motor domains are controlled by specific olivocerebellar modules (Horn et al., 2010; Ruigrok, 2011; Graham and Wylie, 2012), the differential intrinsic firing frequencies may be tuned to the specific neuronal demands downstream of the cerebellum (De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015). Thus, dependent on the specific behavior controlled by the module involved, the PCs engaged may show low or high intrinsic firing as well as related plasticity rules to adjust these behaviors (Apps et al., 2018).\n\nCellular heterogeneity can drive differentiation in the activity and plasticity of individual cells that operate within a larger ensemble (Altschuler and Wu, 2010). The molecular and cellular determinants of differential electrophysiological processing in the cerebellar PC modules are just starting to be identified (Cerminara et al., 2015; Apps et al., 2018). For example, while the impact of zebrin II itself is still unclear (Zhou et al., 2014), excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) and GLAST/EAAT1 may selectively modulate simple spike activity of zebrin-positive PCs as well as plasticity of their parallel fiber (PF) inputs (Wadiche and Jahr, 2005; Perkins et al., 2018). Likewise, the distributions of particular subcategories of receptors that may be relevant for firing properties are linked to the same modular organization. For example, whereas γ-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors occur in both zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs (Tian and Zhu, 2018), the GABAB2 receptor is selectively expressed in a pattern similar to that of zebrin II (Chung et al., 2008). Or, whereas the alpha isoform of mGluR1 (mGluR1a) is uniformly expressed in all PCs (Ohtani et al., 2014) the mGluR1b receptor is expressed in a pattern complementary to that of zebrin II (Mateos et al., 2001). Interestingly, the modular distributions of most of these receptors point towards a critical role of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 3 (TRPC3) in regulating electrophysiological properties of PCs. For example, while the mGluR1b receptor interacts with TRPC3 to drive mGluR1-dependent currents (Hartmann et al., 2008), the GABAB receptors modulate mGluR1-triggered TRPC3-mediated currents (Tian and Zhu, 2018). However, where and how TRPC3 operates in cerebellar PCs is still largely unknown (Zhou et al., 2014).\n\nHere, we set out to test the hypothesis that TRPC3 is a key player in the molecular machinery responsible for differential control over the activity and function of Z+ and Z– PCs. We demonstrate that TRPC3 in the brain has particularly high expression levels in the cerebellum, in a pattern largely, but not precisely, complementary to zebrin. We examined the impact of TRPC3 gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations and found effects on the spiking rate of Z– but not Z+ PCs in vitro. In vivo recordings during quiet wakefulness in the same mutants revealed that the level of TRPC3 influences both simple spike and complex spike rates, and the interaction between the two, also selectively in Z– modules. Finally, we show that adaptation of compensatory eye movements, which is controlled by Z+ modules in the vestibulocerebellum (Sanchez et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2014), is not affected by the loss of TRPC3 function, whereas the learning rate during eyeblink conditioning, which is linked to the Z– modules (Hesslow, 1994; Mostofi et al., 2010), is decreased after PC-specific ablation of TRPC3, highlighting the behavioral relevance of firing rate modulation by TRPC3.\n\nThe cerebellum offers a rich repertoire of electrophysiological properties that allows us to coordinate a wide variety of sensorimotor and cognitive behaviors. We recently uncovered that there are at least two main types of cerebellar modules with different intrinsic profiles (Zhou et al., 2014) and plasticity rules (Wadiche and Jahr, 2005; Suvrathan et al., 2016; Voges et al., 2017). This organization is highly preserved throughout phylogeny and characterized by a series of molecular markers such as zebrin that are distributed in a complementary fashion across the cerebellar cortex (Apps and Hawkes, 2009; Marzban and Hawkes, 2011; Graham and Wylie, 2012). Here, we demonstrated that zebrin-negative PCs show a relatively high expression of TRPC3, which has a dominant impact on its electrophysiological features (Figure 8). Indeed, gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding for TRPC3 selectively affected activity in the zebrin-negative modules and the motor behavior that is controlled by these modules.\n\nFigure 8\n\nOur results confirm previous work indicating that TRPC3 is expressed in all PCs, yet for the first time reveal that its expression is non-uniform and largely complementary to that of well-known marker of cerebellar modules, Zebrin II. Notably, the ablation of TRPC3 decreased the firing rate of Z– PCs to that of Z+ PCs in the superficial areas that were targeted by imaging approaches, but did not completely delete the difference in lobules I-III. Hence, TRPC3 is at least a major contributor to the increased firing rate of Z– PCs, but other factors putatively contribute as well. Although TRPC3 is present in all PCs, loss- and gain-of-function mutations selectively affected Z– PCs, suggesting that other proteins in the pathway leading to TRPC3 activation may be involved. TRPC channels, which are calcium-permeable upon activation by phospholipase C or diacylglycerol, are widely expressed in the brain and critically involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic transmission (Hartmann et al., 2008; Hartmann et al., 2011; Becker, 2014; Sun et al., 2014). TRPC1 and TRPC3 are both prominently expressed in the cerebellum, but in PCs TRPC3 is most abundant (Hartmann et al., 2008). In addition to its contribution to intrinsic activity, TRPC3 currents also mediate the slow excitatory postsynaptic potential following activation of mGluR1b, which is expressed in a pattern complementary to that of zebrin (Mateos et al., 2001; Hartmann et al., 2011; Ohtani et al., 2014). Our results indicate that TRPC3 can be detected in all PCs in a pattern that is largely, but not completely, complementary to that of Zebrin II, while the effects of TRPC3 ablation are restricted to zebrin-negative PCs. Taken together, this suggests that it is in fact the ‘molecular machinery’ involving mGluR1b activation combined with TRPC3 expression patterns, that drive the differential TRPC3 function.\n\nIn contrast to mGluR1b, mGluR1a is expressed by all PCs (estimated ratio 2:1 to mGluR1b) (Mateos et al., 2001). The metabotropic receptor mGluR1a is important for IP3-mediated calcium release, climbing fiber elimination as well as PF-PC LTD (Ohtani et al., 2014). Intriguingly, and in line with the concept of modular differentiation, mGluR1-dependent processes are hampered in zebrin-positive PCs by the expression of EAAT4 (Wadiche and Jahr, 2005), whereas zebrin-negative PCs selectively express PLCβ4 that works in concert with mGluR1a (Ohtani et al., 2014). The differences in expression patterns may enhance the probability of PF-PC LTD in zebrin-negative PCs over that in zebrin-positive PCs, which is supported by experiments performed in P21 mice (Wadiche and Jahr, 2005). The consequences of EAAT4 or PLCβ4 deletion on PC physiology have been evaluated in vitro in several studies (Hashimoto et al., 2001; Miyata et al., 2001; Wadiche and Jahr, 2005; Perkins et al., 2018), but what the consequences in vivo on circuit physiology and on the behaviors tested here are, is unclear. Our results here demonstrate that changes that occur at the cell physiological level, that is reduced simple spike rate and altered CS-SS interaction, lead to a more complex pattern of changes in the intact system. The additional effects are particularly striking in the pcp2Cre;TRPC3fl/fl mice, where the reduced simple spike rate in zebrin-negative PCs leads to a lower complex spike rate. In principle, this could have been a direct olivocerebellar loop effect, as lower simple spike rate results in reduced inhibition of the also inhibitory projection from the cerebellar nuclei to the inferior olive (Chaumont et al., 2013; Witter et al., 2013). In contrast, TRPC3Mwk/- mice exhibit a higher PC simple spike rate, but also a lower complex spike rate. This seems to argue against a direct olivocerebellar loop effect, but the gain-of-function mutation is present in all neurons of this mouse line and thus cell intrinsic processing probably plays a -currently unknown- role herein. The unaltered complex spike rate of pcp2CreERT2;TRPC3fl/fl mice suggests that there is a developmental component to the relationship between complex spikes and simple spikes (Badura et al., 2013; White and Sillitoe, 2017).\n\nIt should be noted that in some experiments we found that also the Z+ PCs were affected by TRPC3 mutations. In TRPC3Mwk/- mice the regularity of simple spikes and complex spikes was higher compared to controls. TRPC3 is expressed in UBCs and inferior olivary neurons (see also Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplements 1–2). UBCs are neurons that fire action potential with high regularity (Ruigrok et al., 2011) and provide mossy fiber input in lobule X, which -indirectly- drives PC simple spike activity (Nunzi et al., 2001), whereas inferior olivary neurons directly control the rate and regularity of complex spikes (De Zeeuw et al., 2011). UBCs degenerate early in development in TRPC3Mwk/-, while the effects of the mutation on inferior olivary neurons have not been described yet. Thus, the global nature of this mutation could drive changes in other cell types that explain the effects observed in the regularity of simple and complex spikes. In addition, it should be noted that the complex spike rate of Z+ PCs in pcp2Cre;TRPC3fl/fl mice as observed with the use of 2-photon imaging, was also lower, for which we at current do not have an explanation. In general, in all conditions the complex spikes rate in Z– and Z+ appear to be significantly or trending towards lower values in mutant mice, except for those in inducible mice where the mutation occurred after development. This has two potential implications: 1) TRPC3 mutations, through direct effects on inferior olivary neurons and/or indirect effects through the olivocerebellar loop, have an inhibiting effect on complex spike rates, and 2) these effects are absent when the mutation is induced later in life.\n\nTo test the functional consequences of the loss of TRPC3 and the modular specificity of these effects, we tested the impact on behavioral experiments that can be linked to specific modules. Eyeblink conditioning and VOR adaptation are controlled by different modules in the cerebellum and they are distinctly different by nature. Eyeblink conditioning requires a novel, well-timed eyelid movement to a previously unrelated, neutral stimulus, and has been linked to largely or completely zebrin-negative modules in the anterior cerebellum (Hesslow, 1994; Mostofi et al., 2010). The activity of the putative zebrin-negative PCs in this area is relatively high at rest, in line with their zebrin identity, and a decrease in this high firing rate correlates to the eyeblink response (Jirenhed et al., 2007; Johansson et al., 2014; ten Brinke et al., 2015). Conversely, VOR adaptation adjusts the amplitude of an existing reflex to optimize sensory processing using visual feedback and is controlled by the vestibulocerebellum, the flocculus in particular, which is classically considered to be zebrin-positive (Sanchez et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2014; cf Sugihara and Quy, 2007; Fujita et al., 2014). There are several variations in VOR adaptation aimed at different changes in temporal and/or spatial parameters (see e.g. Voges et al., 2017). In unidirectional VOR gain increase, we recently found that the change correlating with the adapted eye movement consisted of a potentiation, an increase, of the -at rest- lower PC firing rate (Voges et al., 2017). Although our current study has its main focus on the differential contribution of TRPC3 at the cell and systems physiological level, it is tempting to speculate how the loss of TRPC3 in PCs results in an eyeblink conditioning phenotype without affecting VOR adaptation. The reduction in firing rate of zebrin-negative PCs may directly contribute to the impaired conditioning. The suppression of simple spike firing that generally correlates with the conditioned response (ten Brinke et al., 2015) might be occluded by the lower resting rate in pcp2Cre;TRPC3fl/fl mice. Alternatively, PF-PC LTD could play a role as it is in line with the simple spike suppression and blocking TRPC3 function completely abolishes this form of LTD (Kim, 2013). However, genetically ablating PF-PC LTD did not affect the ability to perform eyeblink conditioning successfully (Schonewille et al., 2011), arguing against an exclusive role for this form of plasticity. Schreurs and colleagues demonstrated that intrinsic excitability is increased after eyeblink conditioning (Schreurs et al., 1997). A third option could be that TRPC3 also affects the adaptive increase of excitability, intrinsic plasticity, which is calcium-activated potassium channel function dependent (Ohtsuki et al., 2012), and thereby delays the expression of a conditioned blink response. All three options would not necessarily affect VOR adaptation and could contribute to the deficits in eyeblink conditioning, but given the relatively mild phenotype, one or two could be sufficient. Future experiments will have to unravel the cellular changes underlying eyeblink conditioning and VOR adaptation and the specific role of TRPC3 in the former.\n\nIn this study we aimed to gain insight in the mechanisms that convert molecular heterogeneity into differentiation of cell physiology and function. This mechanistic question goes hand in hand with the more conceptual question: why are there, at least, two different types of PCs? An appealing hypothesis is that zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive bands control two muscles with opposing functions, for example a flexor and an extensor. Trans-synaptic retrograde tracing using rabies virus from antagonist muscles demonstrated that there is no robust division in zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive strips, but that a partial segregation could not be excluded (Ruigrok et al., 2008). A second possibility would be that individual muscles are controlled by either only zebrin-negative or zebrin-positive strips, or a combination of both, when needed. In the vestibulocerebellum of the pigeon, each movement direction is controlled by a set of zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive bands (Graham and Wylie, 2012). In this configuration each PC within the set, or separately, would then serve a distinct function, for which it is optimized by gene expression patterns. This dissociation of function could entail for example timing versus coordination (Diedrichsen et al., 2007) or moving versus holding still (Shadmehr, 2017), although none of these distinctions have been linked to specific zebrin-identified modules. Alternatively, it may be the net polarity of the connectivity downstream of the cerebellar nuclei up to the motor neurons or the cerebral cortical neurons that determines the demand(s) of the module(s) involved (De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015). Module-specific driver lines would greatly aid to answer these questions, but are currently not available.\n\nTo summarize, our results support the hypothesis that cerebellar modules control distinct behaviors based on cellular heterogeneity, with differential molecular configurations. We present the first evidence for a non-uniform expression pattern of TRPC3 in PCs, complementary to that of zebrin in the vermis but more homogeneous in the hemispheres. Nonetheless, TRPC3 effects are directly coupled to zebrin, a specificity that putatively requires mGluR1b (Ohtani et al., 2014), the activator of TRPC3 that is expressed in a pattern perfectly complementary to zebrin (Mateos et al., 2001).\n\nSince the discovery of protein expression patterns in the cerebellar cortex (Brochu et al., 1990), numerous other proteins with patterned expression have been identified (Cerminara et al., 2015). These patterns have been linked to circuit organizations of modules (Apps and Hawkes, 2009), to disease and degeneration (Cerminara et al., 2015), and more recently to electrophysiological differences (Wadiche and Jahr, 2005; Zhou et al., 2014). Most expression patterns follow or complement that of zebrin II, but alternative patterns have been observed (Armstrong et al., 2001). These patterns commonly further subdivided one of the two populations studied here and thus potentially underlie the remaining variation and differences between lobules (Apps et al., 2018). Altogether, this work demonstrates that proper cerebellar function is based on the presence of (at least) two modi operandi that have distinct molecular machineries, with TRPC3 as one of the major contributing factors, so as to differentially control sensorimotor integration in downstream circuitries that require control with opposite polarity."
