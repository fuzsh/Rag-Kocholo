We are thrilled to announce that Arti Finn, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Orijin, has been honored on Forbes' prestigious 50 Over 50 list! This recognition, in partnership with Mika Brzezinski's Know Your Value initiative, highlights women who are making their most significant impact at age 50 and beyond. Arti's journey with Orijin is truly inspiring. As a leader in the intersection of justice and education technology, she has been instrumental in expanding Orijin's reach to 18 states and hundreds of correctional facilities. Her work focuses on transforming the U.S. correctional system to genuine rehabilitation. Through Orijin's innovative programs, which are provided free to incarcerated individuals, Arti and our Orijin team are helping justice-impacted individuals gain the skills and education needed for sustainable employment to break the cycle of incarceration. This recognition not only celebrates Arti's achievements but also shines a light on the critical need to reimagine our correctional system. It's a call to action for us all to support efforts that prioritize rehabilitation, empower individuals, and provide second chances. Let's celebrate Arti's accomplishments and continue advocating for a justice system that truly rehabilitates and empowers. #ForbesOver50 #Orijinedtech #SecondChances #Rehabilitation\n\nOn a search for a frank and realistic assessment on the challenges the EdTech industry is facing amidst the ongoing liquidity crisis, look no further than this conversation with long-time veteran in the industry, Mark Grovic, founder of New Markets Venture Partners.
