        "text": "Summary\n\nThe ability to adapt while exploring the world is critical for survival, yet how it comes about is unclear. Here we show that a whisker protraction reflex can be elicited following rostro-caudal pad stimulation, and that short-term kinematics of this reflex are enhanced when coherent complex spike activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells occurs in crus 1. Instead, the long-term kinematics can be adapted by tetanic stimulation and this adaptation is largely controlled by changes in the simple spike activity of Purkinje cells in crus 2. Increases in whisker protraction correlate with preceding increases in simple spikes in trial-by-trial variation analysis, and both behavioral and spike adaptation are absent in independent mouse models in which postsynaptic long-term potentiation of Purkinje cells is blocked. These differentially distributed short-term and long-term cerebellum-dependent modulations of whisker movements may come into play during coordination and adaptation of natural behaviors like gap crossing and prey capture.\n\nImpact statement Romano et al. show direct coupling between increased cerebellar activity and motor learning, with both phenomena being absent in independent mouse models lacking parallel fiber LTP.\n\nIntroduction\n\nActive touch is important for exploring our environment, allowing us to assess the shape, substance and movements of objects and organisms around us (Prescott et al., 2011). Throughout the animal kingdom, various systems have evolved for this purpose; these include for example the antennae of insects, the fingertips of primates and the well-developed whisker systems of rodents and sea mammals (Ahl, 1986; Dehnhardt et al., 2001; Staudacher et al., 2005; Dere et al., 2007; Anjum and Brecht, 2012). Controlling and adapting movements of such systems are thus critical in both daily life and life-threatening situations. Whereas the role of the cerebral cortex in the planning and initiation of active touch is relatively well established (Kleinfeld et al., 1999; Brecht, 2007; Bosman et al., 2011; Petreanu et al., 2012; Diamond and Arabzadeh, 2013; Feldmeyer et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2014; Petersen, 2014; Deschênes et al., 2016), that of the cerebellum in learning how to adapt these movements is less clear (Popa et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2016, 2017). Conceptually, the cerebellum may generate representations to predict the sensory consequences of active control (Wolpert et al., 1998; Medina and Lisberger, 2007; Brooks et al., 2015; Streng et al., 2018), but with which cellular and network mechanisms it may adjust such representations remains to be elucidated. In the past, long-term depression (LTD) at the parallel fiber-to-Purkinje cell (PC) synapse, guided by climbing fiber activity, has been considered to be the main cellular mechanism underlying cerebellar motor learning (Albus, 1971; Konnerth et al., 1992; Ito, 2003; Koekkoek et al., 2003; Medina and Lisberger, 2008). Parallel fiber LTD is, however, not the sole mechanism underlying cerebellar plasticity. Recently, short-term adaptation of movements could be linked to a bidirectional change in simple spike firing, depending on the presence or absence of climbing fiber activity during the previous trial (Yang and Lisberger, 2014; Herzfeld et al., 2018). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that also long-term potentiation (LTP) of the parallel fiber-to-PC synapse is behaviorally relevant (Schonewille et al., 2010; Schonewille et al., 2011; Rahmati et al., 2014; Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017; Voges et al., 2017), although direct electrophysiological evidence that cerebellar LTP can underlie long-term behavioral changes on a trial-by-trial basis is still largely lacking.\n\nTo study the potential impact of long-term synaptic plasticity in PCs on the control of motor output, we elaborated on recent findings showing that ongoing whisker movements in mice can be reflected in PC simple spike firing (Proville et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016). Mice, like rats, sweep their whiskers rhythmically while exploring the environment and they adapt these movements to the changing sensory stimuli (Welker, 1964; Ahl, 1986; Berg and Kleinfeld, 2003; Voigts et al., 2015). We hypothesized that, as shown for other forms of motor learning like eyeblink conditioning (Jirenhed et al., 2007; Ten Brinke et al., 2015), adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (Schonewille et al., 2010; Voges et al., 2017) and adjustment of smooth pursuit or saccadic eye movements (Thier et al., 2002; Catz et al., 2008; Medina and Lisberger, 2008; Herzfeld et al., 2014; Yang and Lisberger, 2014; Herzfeld et al., 2015; Yang and Lisberger, 2017; Herzfeld et al., 2018), plasticity at the level of the PC network may contribute to entrainment of modified whisker movements.\n\nAs cerebellar training protocols for whisker movements had not been developed, we designed a novel paradigm. We based the induction protocol on the known dynamics at the cerebellar input stage, the granular layer, which indicate that sensory stimulation at theta band frequencies – in particular at 4 Hz – may be particularly efficient in inducing plasticity (D’Angelo et al., 2001; Lev-Ram et al., 2002; Lev-Ram et al., 2003; Coesmans et al., 2004; Ramakrishnan et al., 2016). In view of the predominantly positive correlation between simple spike firing and the set point of the whiskers (Chen et al., 2016), we expected that 4 Hz tetanic stimulation of the whisker pad in rostro-caudal direction would lead to a concomitant change in whisker protraction and simple spike firing. We show that in naïve untrained animals, modulatory activity of the climbing fibers in predominantly crus 1 precedes reflexive whisker movements following rostro-caudal stimulation of the pad, while that of the simple spikes occurs at the same time as the whisker movements. Instead, after induction of the training protocol with tetanic stimulation in the same direction enhanced simple spike modulation in predominantly crus 2 that anticipates increased whisker protraction, which can be prevented by blocking LTP at the parallel fiber-to-PC synapse. These data indicate that reflexive and adaptive whisker movements can be mediated by short-term and long-term control of complex spike and simple spike activity, respectively, and that these processes can be distributed among different Purkinje cells.\n\nResults\n\nWhisker pad stimulation triggers stereotypic whisker behavior\n\nThe large facial whiskers are a prime source of sensory information for many mammals, in particular for rodents that can make elaborate movements with their large facial whiskers (Welker, 1964; Brecht, 2007; Bosman et al., 2011; Arkley et al., 2017). It has been noted that passive touch can trigger active whisker movements in mice (Ferezou et al., 2007), but this behavior has not been described in great detail yet. Here, we studied whisker movements following rostro-caudal air puff stimulation of the whisker pad in 16 awake, head-restrained mice (Figure 1A-C). Under these conditions, with a 2 s inter-trial interval, spontaneous whisking in between stimuli was rare: only in 12% of all trials whisker movements of more than 10° happened during the 200 ms prior to an air puff to the whisker pad. An air puff in rostro-caudal direction induced a passive backward movement that was typically followed by a stereotypic large protraction, exceeding 10° in amplitude in 82% of all trials. After this touch-evoked protraction, whisker behavior was more variable with prolonged whisker movements (>200 ms) being observed in approximately half (51%) of the trials (Figure 1D-H). In the other half of the trials, movement stopped after returning to the resting position directly following the first protraction. The puffer was placed in such a way that most, if not all, large mystacial whiskers were affected by the air flow. The touch-evoked protraction was typically performed by all whiskers simultaneously (data not shown). We conclude that mechanical stimulation in rostro-caudal direction triggers a synchronized forward sweep of all large facial whiskers in most trials, which is followed by a prolonged period of active whisking in half of the trials.\n\nAir puffs induce reflexive whisker movements\n\nTo understand the nature of touch-evoked whisker movements, we varied the stimulus conditions. We reasoned that if the air puff triggered a conscious, explorative movement, the animal would most likely make a movement towards the source of the air puff. To this end, we placed a second air puffer at the caudal side of the whisker field and a third air puffer at the front of the contralateral whisker field. A startle response would be expected to be more stereotypic, involving less direction-specificity and it should be suppressed by a brief pre-pulse (Gogan, 1970; Swerdlow et al., 1992; Moreno-Paublete et al., 2017). During a single recording session, air puffs from the three different orientations were given and intermingled with trials including a brief pre-pulse, all in a random order (Figure 2A). Irrespective of the direction of the stimulus, a reflexive forward sweep was triggered, providing an argument against this being a conscious, explorative movement (Figure 2B-C). An air puff from the front on the ipsilateral side induced a largely passive retraction prior to the stereotypic protraction. Such a retraction was largely absent when stimulating from the back and of shorter duration when giving a brief pre-pulse. Contralateral stimulation also evoked a slight retraction, followed by a much larger forward sweep (Figure 2B-E; Table S1). The absence of a diminishing effect of the weaker pre-pulse on the reaction to the stronger pulse (p = 0.268; Dunn’s pairwise post-hoc test after Friedman’s ANOVA; p = 0.003; Fr = 13.933; df = 3) as well as the finding that the subsequent strong pulse did not evoke a larger protraction than the preceding weak pre-pulse (p = 0.496, Wilcoxon-matched pairs test; Figure 2B inset) led us to conclude that the touch-evoked whisker protraction is unlikely reflecting a startle response (Figure 2E; Table S1). Altogether, the stereotypic nature of the touch-evoked whisker movements in the absence of indications for a startle response indicates that this is a reflexive movement.\n\nAnatomical distribution of Purkinje cell responses to whisker pad stimulation\n\nModulation of reflexive movements requiring sensorimotor integration is a well-established function of the cerebellum, as has been extensively studied for instance in eyeblink conditioning (Alba et al., 1994; Christian and Thompson, 2003; Heiney et al., 2014; Ten Brinke et al., 2015) and oculomotor reflexes (Lisberger and Fuchs, 1978; Waespe et al., 1985; Medina and Lisberger, 2008; Schonewille et al., 2011; Yang and Lisberger, 2014; Herzfeld et al., 2018). Accordingly, PCs receive sensory whisker input not only directly from the brainstem but also indirectly from thalamo-cortical pathways (Kleinfeld et al., 1999; Bosman et al., 2011; McElvain et al., 2018) and the dynamics of their responses upon whisker stimulation are heterogeneous (Brown and Bower, 2001; Loewenstein et al., 2005; Bosman et al., 2010; Chu et al., 2011) (Figure 3F). We first mapped the firing properties of PCs in the ipsilateral lobules crus 1 and crus 2 in response to whisker pad air puff stimulation in awake mice. Of the 132 single-unit PCs from which we recorded, 118 (89%) showed significant complex spike responses, but with large variations in latency and amplitude (Figure 3A-C, Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A-B). Following cluster analysis of the strength of their responses PCs could be split in two groups. A subset of PCs could be classified as “strong complex spike responders” (45 PCs, i.e., 34%), while most PCs that were responsive to whisker stimulation were classified as “weak complex spike responders” (87 PCs, i.e., 66%) (Figure 3 – figure supplement 1D-F).\n\nSignificant simple spike responses were found in 127 (96%) of the 132 recorded PCs. Simple spike responses were often bi-phasic, consisting of a period of inhibition followed by one of excitation, or vice versa (Figures 3D-E, Figure 3 – figure supplement 1C). The trough of the simple spike responses typically correlated in a reciprocal fashion with the peak of the complex spike responses (Figures 3A-E; Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A-C) (De Zeeuw et al., 2011; Badura et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2014).\n\nTo chart the spatial distribution of the PCs with different response kinetics upon whisker stimulation we combined electrolytic lesions (Figure 3G) with reconstructions of the electrode entry points, generating a map of the recording locations of the 132 PCs recorded with the quartz/platinum electrodes. Complex spike responses to whisker stimulation were found to be especially strong in the lateral zones of crus 1 (Figure 3H) and the first phase of the simple spike responses were found to be largely reciprocal: in areas where complex spike responses were strong, simple spikes were mainly suppressed, and vice versa they were predominantly facilitated in the cells where complex spike responses were weak (Figure 3H-I; Figure 3 – Figure supplement 1G-H).\n\nNext, we verified this distribution by using double-barrel glass pipettes with which we injected neural tracer, BDA 3000, at the recording spot after recording. Following identification of the source of the climbing fibers in the inferior olive and the projection area in the cerebellar nuclei (Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2A-C) we defined the cerebellar area in which the recorded PC was located (cf. (Voogd and Glickstein, 1998; Apps and Hawkes, 2009). These experiments confirmed that the strong complex spike responders were situated most prominently in the lateral part of crus 1, whereas most cells in crus 2 were weak complex spike responders (Figure 3 – Figure supplement 2D). In conclusion, following whisker stimulation we could identify a region with predominantly strong complex spike and inhibitory simple spike responses in the lateral part of crus 1, whereas crus 2 contained more PCs with a weak complex spike and facilitating simple spike response, respectively.\n\nCoherent complex spike firing is specifically enhanced by whisker pad stimulation\n\nNext, we used two-photon Ca2+ imaging to study the behavior of adjacent groups of PCs around the moment of whisker pad air puff stimulation in awake mice. After injection of the Ca2+-sensitive dye Cal-520 we could recognize the dendrites of PCs as parasagittal stripes (Figure 4A), each of which showed fluorescent transients at irregular intervals (Figure 4B). Previous studies identified these transients as the result of PC complex spike firing (Schultz et al., 2009; Tsutsumi et al., 2015). Occasionally, signals could be found that were shared by many PCs, even in the absence of sensory stimulation (Figure 4B) in line with earlier reports (Mukamel et al., 2009; Ozden et al., 2009; Schultz et al., 2009; De Gruijl et al., 2014). Upon whisker pad stimulation, complex spike firing occurred much more often collectively in multiple Purkinje cells (Figure 4C). To quantify this form of coherent firing, we counted the number of complex spikes fired per frame (of 40 ms) and determined the level of coherence using cross-correlation analyses (Figure 4D). The levels of coherence increased to such strength that they were extremely unlikely to have occurred by the increase in firing frequency alone (compared to a re-distribution of all events based on a Poisson distribution; Figure 4E). In other words, firing of a single or a few PCs was the dominant mode of activity in the absence of stimulation, and this changed towards the involvement of many PCs upon stimulation, firing coherently (Figure 4F-G). We conclude that groups of adjacent PCs in crus 1 respond to whisker pad stimulation by increased complex spike firing with an enhanced level of coherence.\n\nLarger whisker protractions are preceded by complex spikes\n\nIn view of the strong convergence between PCs and cerebellar nuclei neurons, we expect that complex spike coherence may contribute to driving motor activity (Mukamel et al., 2009; Hoogland et al., 2015). To study the impact of complex spike firing on touch-evoked whisker protraction, we segregated the trials during which a complex spike was fired by a single PC from those during which no complex spike was produced. It turned out that during the trials with a complex spike, the protraction was significantly larger (see Figure 5A for a single PC; Figure 5B for the population of 55 PCs that responded to air puff stimulation). A direct comparison between the timing of the complex spike response and the difference in whisker position between trials with and without a complex spike revealed that the peak in complex spike preceded the moment of maximal difference in position after stimulation by 63 ± 4 ms (mean ± SEM; n = 55; Figure 5C-D). The maximal difference in protraction contributed by a complex spike equaled 0.80° (median, with IQR of 2.80°; p < 0.001), whereas this was only 0.28° (0.92°) for retraction (p = 0.002; Wilcoxon matched pairs tests, significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons: α = 0.05/3 = 0.017) (Figure 5E).\n\nInstantaneous simple spike firing correlates with whisker protraction during reflex\n\nThe firing rate of simple spikes has been shown to correlate with whisker position: in the large majority of PCs, simple spike firing is correlated with protraction and in a minority it correlates with retraction (Chen et al., 2016). This led us to study the correlation in simple spike firing during touch-induced whisker protraction. At first sight, variation in simple spike firing roughly correlated to periods with whisker movement (Figure 6A-B). To study this in more detail, we made use of the inter-trial variations in simple spike rate and whisker position, allowing us to make a correlation matrix between these two variables on a trial-by-trial basis (cf. (Ten Brinke et al., 2015). In a representative example (Figure 6C), the whisker protraction and peak in simple spike firing were roughly simultaneous. In the correlation matrix, this is visualized by the yellow color along the 45° line. This turned out to be the general pattern in 25 of the 56 PCs (45%) of which we had electrophysiological recordings during whisker tracking (Figure 6D). In all of these 25 PCs, there was a positive correlation between instantaneous simple spike firing and whisker protraction that occurred relatively late during the movement, in particular between 80 and 200 ms after the start of the stimulus (Figure 6C-D; Figure 6 – Figure supplement 1C), thus well after the complex spike responses occurred (Figure 5C). In the 31 remaining PCs, the ones that did not display a significant correlation when evaluated at the level of individual cells, we still observed a correlation at the population level. Remarkably, this correlation was negative, i.e. showing a correlation between simple spike firing and retraction (Figure 6 – Figure supplement 1). We conclude that during the touch evoked whisker reflex simple spikes predominantly correlate with whisker protraction and that this correlation is maximal without a clear time lead or lag, unlike the complex spikes whose occurrence tended to precede the protraction.\n\nContralateral whisker pad stimulation induces stronger whisker protraction and stronger simple spike responses\n\nIf an increase in simple spike firing correlates to stronger whisker protraction, then the simple spike response to contralateral stimulation should be larger than that to ipsilateral stimulation, as contralateral stimulation evokes a stronger protraction (Figures 2 and 7A). To test this we recorded PC activity while stimulating the ipsi-and contralateral whiskers in a random sequence (Figure 7B). The change in maximal protraction was considerable (difference in maximal protraction: 7.30 ± 1.24° (mean ± SEM); n = 9 mice; Figure 7C; cf. Figure 2E). Possibly, the absence of direct impact of the air flow during contralateral stimulation can explain part of this difference, which is also in line with the earlier onset of the protraction during contralateral stimulation (Figure 7C). However, in addition to this passive process, a change in simple spikes may actively contribute to this difference as well, as the simple spikes increased significantly more during contralateral stimulation (increase during first 60 ms after air puff onset for contra-vs. ipsilateral stimulation: 13.7 ± 5.3%; mean ± SEM; p = 0.023; t = 2.413; df = 26; paired t test; n = 27 PCs; Figure 7E). Instead, the complex spike response was reduced during contralateral stimulation (complex spike peak response: ipsilateral: 1.40% (1.25%); contralateral: 0.71% (0.81%); medians (IQR); p < 0.001; Wilcoxon matched-pairs test; n = 27 PCs) (Figure 7D).\n\nSimple spikes have been shown not to initiate but to modulate ongoing whisker movements (Proville et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016). To find out whether simple spike firing could modulate touch-evoked whisker protraction, we investigated the impact of artificial activation of PCs by optogenetic stimulation. To this end we used L7-Ai27 mice, which express channelrhodopsin-2 exclusively in their PCs and show a strong increase in their simple spike firing upon stimulation with blue light (Witter et al., 2013). We placed an optic fiber of 400 μm diameter at the crus 1/2 region and compared air puff-induced whisker movements between trials with and without 100 ms of optogenetic PC stimulation. As expected, the whisker protraction was larger during the trials with optogenetic stimulation when simple spike firing in the PCs was increased (p < 0.001; t = 4.411; df = 12; paired t test; n = 13 mice; Figure 7 – Figure supplement 1). Taken together, increased simple spike firing can be correlated to stronger whisker protraction, whether evoked by contralateral whisker stimulation or by direct optogenetic stimulation.\n\nTetanic 4 Hz stimulation leads to acceleration of the simple spike response and to stronger protraction of the whiskers\n\nNext, we investigated whether sensory experience could modulate the touch-evoked whisker protraction, the frequency of simple spike firing and the relation between them. We hypothesized that whisker movements might be enhanced following tetanic stimulation at 4 Hz, as this frequency has been shown to be particularly effective in inducing potentiation at the parallel fiber-to-PC synapse (D’Angelo et al., 2001; Lev-Ram et al., 2002; Coesmans et al., 2004; Ramakrishnan et al., 2016). Indeed, application of this 4 Hz tetanic stimulation to the whisker pad for only 20 seconds was sufficient to induce an increase in the maximal protraction (average increase 17.9 ± 3.9%; mean ± SEM; p < 0.001; Wilcoxon-matched pairs test; n = 16 mice; Figure 8A-B; Table S2).\n\nThis change in the amplitude of the touch-evoked whisker protraction was not accompanied by any substantial change in the complex spike response to whisker pad stimulation (p = 0.163; Wilcoxon matched pairs test; n = 55 PCs; Figure 8C; Table S2). However, the rate of simple spike firing upon air puff stimulation was markedly increased after 20 s of 4 Hz stimulation. This was especially clear during the first 60 ms after the air puff (p = 0.003; Wilcoxon matched pairs test; n = 55 PCs; Figure 8D; Table S2). Overlaying the averaged whisker traces and response spike profiles highlighted the earlier occurrence of facilitation in simple spike firing after the 4 Hz tetanic stimulation protocol (Figure 8E). To study this timing effect in more detail, we repeated the trial-based correlation analysis (cf. Figure 8C-D). The moment of maximal correlation between simple spike firing and whisker position was reached faster after the 4 Hz tetanic stimulation (time of maximal correlation pre-induction: 152.1 ± 18.1 ms; post-induction: 90.7 ± 9.4 ms (means ± SEM); p = 0.020; t = 2.664; df = 13; paired t test; n = 14 PCs; Figure 8F). Indeed, the maximum correlation was found to be above the 45° line after the 4 Hz tetanic stimulation, implying that the changes in simple spike firing now preceded the whisker movement, rather than being around the same time as before the induction.\n\nDuring the induction phase itself (i.e. during the 4 Hz stimulation period of 20 s), both the complex spike and simple spike responses to each air puff were weakened when comparing them with the pre-induction period at which we used 0.5 Hz stimulation. More specifically, the maximum response of the complex spikes significantly decreased from a median of 1.27% (with an IQR of 1.89%) during pre-induction to 0.52% (with IQR of 0.43%) during induction (p < 0.001; Wilcoxon matched pairs tests, n = 55 PCs). Likewise, the average spiking frequency of the simple spikes in the first 200 ms after the puff decreased from a median of 94.3 Hz (with IQR of 38.3 Hz) during pre-induction to 39.9 Hz (IQR of 22.1 Hz) during induction (p < 0.001) (Figure 8 – Figure supplement 1). Thus, we conclude that following, but not during, a brief period of 4 Hz tetanic stimulation touch-evoked whisker protraction is increased concomitantly with an increase in simple spike firing, the latter now preceding the movement.\n\nTetanic 4 Hz stimulation specifically potentiates simple spike firing in PCs with weak complex spike responses\n\nAs cerebellar plasticity is bi-directional and under control of climbing fiber activity (Lev-Ram et al., 2003; Coesmans et al., 2004; Ohtsuki et al., 2009), we wanted to find out to what extent plastic changes in simple spike activity can be related to the strength of the complex spike response generated by these climbing fibers. To this end we compared for each PC the strength of the complex spike responses to whisker pad stimulation to the impact of 4 Hz tetanic stimulation on simple spike responses. As expected, we found a significant negative correlation between the strength of the complex spike response and the change in simple spike response (R = 0.311; p = 0.021; linear regression on n = 55 PCs; Figure 9A). The PCs with the strongest effect of tetanic stimulation on simple spike firing were mainly located in the lateral part of crus 2 (Figure 9B), directly posterior to the crus 1 area with the strongest complex spike responses (Figure 3H). We compared the location of this lateral crus 2 area to that of the PCs with the strongest correlations between simple spike firing and whisker protraction and we found these two crus 2 locations to match (Figure 9B-C).\n\nThe impact of 4 Hz stimulation lasted as long as our recordings lasted; at least 30 min. We separated between PCs with a weak complex spike response and those with a strong one. In line with the correlation analysis shown in Figure 9A, the former PCs expressed a potentiation of their sensory simple spike responses, whereas the latter ones did not (weak vs. strong responders: p = 0.005; F = 3.961; df = 4.424; two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geyser correction; n = 8 weak and n = 6 strong responders; Fig. 9D-F). Likewise, the impact of this stimulation on whisker protraction also lasted throughout the recording. Although the maximal protraction angle gradually decreased towards the pre-induction level, the protraction started earlier, implying a stronger muscle force during the early phase of the touch-evoked whisker protraction, and this effect remained stable throughout our recordings (Figure 9 – Figure supplement 1). Thus, both simple spikes and whisker muscles remained affected by the 4 Hz tetanic stimulation for as long as our recordings lasted.\n\nExpression of PP2B in Purkinje cells is required for increased protraction and simple spike firing following 4 Hz tetanic stimulation\n\nIn reduced preparations, 4 Hz tetanic stimulation of the mossy fiber/parallel fiber inputs leads to LTP of parallel fiber-to-PC synapses (Lev-Ram et al., 2002; Coesmans et al., 2004; Ramakrishnan et al., 2016). At the same time, parallel fiber LTP is inhibited by climbing fiber activity (Lev-Ram et al., 2003; Coesmans et al., 2004; Ohtsuki et al., 2009). Hence, our data appear in line with a role of parallel fiber LTP as a potential mechanism underlying the observed increase in simple spike firing upon a brief period of 4 Hz stimulation. To further test a potential role for LTP, we repeated the 4 Hz tetanic stimulation experiments in L7-PP2B mice, which lack the PP2B protein specifically in their PCs, rendering them deficient of parallel fiber-to-PC LTP (Schonewille et al., 2010) (Figure 10A). Whereas 14 out of 16 WT littermates showed increased touch-evoked whisker protraction after 4 Hz stimulation, only 3 out of 13 L7-PP2B mutant mice did (p < 0.001; Fisher’s exact test). Accordingly, the difference in maximal protraction was significantly less in the L7-PP2B mutant mice (p = 0.044; t = 2.162; df = 19; t test; Figure 10B-D).\n\nIn line with the absence of increased touch-evoked whisker protraction, also the increase in simple spike firing observed in WT mice was absent in L7-PP2B mice. As the strong complex spike responders did not show plasticity (cf. Figure 9), we compared weak complex spike responders of both genotypes. Simple spike responses were stably increased in WT PCs with a weak complex spike response following tetanic stimulation (as shown in Figure 9F), but not in those of L7-PP2B mice (effect of genotype: p = 0.003; F = 4.361; df = 4.137; Two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geyser correction; n = 8 WT and n = 9 L7-PP2B PCs; Figure 10E).\n\nWhile we have already demonstrated an impact of the strength of the complex spike response on the change in simple spike responsiveness irrespective of the clustering into strong and weak complex spike responders (Figure 9A), we further substantiated these findings in 55 WT and 23 L7-PP2B deficient PCs following separation between strong and weak responders. The correlation found between the frequency of complex spike firing and the change in simple spike activity after 4 Hz tetanic stimulation proved to be present only in the weak responders, taking the firing rate during the pre-induction and induction period into account (Figures 10 – Figure supplement 1A and B; for the diminished complex spike response during the induction period see Figure 8 – Figure supplement 1). This is again in line with the observations that parallel fiber activity in the absence of climbing fiber activity promotes parallel fiber LTP (Lev-Ram et al., 2003; Coesmans et al., 2004; Ohtsuki et al., 2009).\n\nA comparison with the L7-PP2B mice revealed that in these mutants the relation between the complex spike frequency during the induction block and simple spike plasticity was also present (Figure 10 – Figure supplement 1C), possibly because parallel fiber LTD is probably still largely intact in these mice (Schonewille et al., 2010). Yet, in line with the absence of increased simple spike responsiveness, the correlation between changes in simple spike firing during the induction block and the impact of 4 Hz stimulation, as present in the WT PCs, was absent in the L7-PP2B mice (Figure 10 - Figure supplements 1B and 1D). Thus, in the absence of the PP2B protein in PCs, the impact of 4 Hz tetanic stimulation on touch-evoked whisker protraction as well as on the simple spike responsiveness was strongly diminished. The correlations between complex spike and simple spike firing on the one hand and modification of the simple spike response to whisker pad stimulation on the other hand further strengthen our hypothesis that parallel fiber LTP is at least one of the main mechanisms underlying the long-term, behavioral and simple spike changes observed after 4 Hz tetanic stimulation.\n\nExpression of AMPA receptor GluA3 subunits in Purkinje cells is required for increased protraction and simple spike firing following 4 Hz tetanic stimulation\n\nDespite the evidence in favor of parallel fiber LTP as the underlying mechanism of the behavioral and electrophysiological impact of 4 Hz tetanic sensory stimulation, alternative explanations may exist. For instance, since PP2B is normally active in the cytoplasm of a cell, L7-PP2B mice may not only be deficient at the synaptic parallel fiber input of PCs, but also at other locations inside the cell where PP2B might serve different functions. To further investigate our hypothesis on the impact of parallel fiber LTP we used a second, independent mouse model, in which the synaptic input is more selectively affected: i.e., the L7-GluA3 deficient mice (Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017). These mice lack the GluA3 subunit of the AMPA receptors specifically at their parallel fiber-to-PC synapses and consequently are less likely to have prominent cytosolic side-effects, while still having impaired parallel fiber-to-PC LTP. As in the L7-PP2B mice, we did not find evidence for increased whisker protraction after 4 Hz tetanic stimulation (e.g., change in whisker angle during the first 120 ms after air puff onset: WT vs. L7-GluA3 mice: p = 0.007; Tukey’s post-hoc test after ANOVA (p = 0.001; F = 9.111; df = 2); n = 16 WT and n = 6 GluA3 deficient mice) (Figure 11A-C). Moreover, as in the L7-PP2B mice, also the increase in simple spike responsiveness after 4 Hz stimulation was absent in L7-GluA3 mice (simple spike count between WT and L7-GluA3 PCs during the first 60 ms after air puff onset: p = 0.004; Tukey’s post-hoc test after ANOVA (p = 0.002; F = 6.681; df = 2); n = 35 WT PCs and n = 13 GluA3 KO PCs, next to n = 23 L7-PP2B KO PCs, all with weak complex spike responses) (Figure 11D-F). Thus an independent line of evidence supports the findings made in the L7-PP2B mice.\n\nBasic PC spiking responses in L7-PP2B and L7-GluA3 mice\n\nFor control we compared the basic electrophysiological profiles of PCs in the three genotypes used in this study. When averaged over the entire period with episodes of stimulation, the overall complex spike rate, simple spike rate and simple spike CV2 value (i.e., increased regularity) of PCs in the L7-PP2B KO mice were moderately, but significantly, reduced compared to those in WTs (Figure 11 – Figure supplement 1A-D; Table S3). Likewise, the peak activity of both the complex spike responses and the simple spike responses in the periods of a few hundred ms directly following the sensory whisker stimulation were significantly reduced in the L7-PP2B KO PCs (Figure 11 – Figure supplement 1E-J; Table S3). In contrast, the L7-GluA3 KO PCs did not show any significant difference with the WT PCs as far as these parameters were concerned, except for the peak complex spike response, which was also slightly reduced compared to WT (Figure 11 – Figure supplement 1E-J; Table S3). However, as the complex spike response negatively correlates with the occurrence of behavioral and simple spike potentiation in WTs (see above), a reduced peak of the complex spike response would be more in line with an increase in potentiation and thereby an enhanced behavioral response, making it unlikely that this property could explain the phenotypes in the mutants. Thus, since the differences in basic PC spiking properties are either not consistent among the L7-PP2B and L7-GluA3 KO lines or do not show the proper polarity, the most parsimonious explanation for their common lack of behavioral and spike learning is their virtually identically impaired levels of LTP induction (Schonewille et al., 2010; Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study we show for the first time that touch can evoke a reflexive whisker protraction that is modifiable. As with learning of other reflexes, such as eyeblink conditioning or adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, long-term modification of this touch-evoked whisker protraction requires an intact cerebellum. We show here that a brief period of 4 Hz tetanic sensory stimulation results in enduring amplification of a touch-evoked whisker protraction. Extracellular recordings revealed that the simple spike rate of the PCs that are predominantly located laterally in crus 2 correlates well with whisker movement and is congruently increased with enhanced whisker protraction after tetanic stimulation. These PCs show a weak complex spike response to whisker stimulation, which appears to act permissive for the occurrence of parallel fiber-to-PC LTP. This plasticity mechanism is likely to be one of the main mechanisms underlying this whisker reflex adaptation, as we found that the 4 Hz induction protocol did result neither in more whisker protraction nor in stronger simple spike responses in two independent genetic mouse models, both of which lack LTP induction at their parallel fiber-to-PC synapse. By contrast, the PCs that show a strong complex spike response to whisker stimulation and that are mainly located laterally in crus 1 did not manifest a prominent regulatory role for their simple spike activity in long-term modification of their whisker movements. While simple spike rates were readily modifiable and had a bilateral relation with whisker movements, complex spike firing was more rigid and its coherence correlated well with the strength of the short-term touch-evoked protraction reflex itself. The whisker system is one of the first of its kind in which different modular regions of the cerebellar cortex appear to control the same motor domain with differential and complementary roles in guiding the short-term and long-term dynamics and kinematics.\n\nControl of whisker movements\n\nAlthough most mammals have whiskers, only a few species use their whiskers to actively explore their environment by making fast, rhythmic whisker movements (Welker, 1964; Woolsey et al., 1975; Ahl, 1986). In “whisking” animals, such as mice and rats, whisker protraction is under direct muscle control, while whisker retraction is largely mediated by a passive process involving skin elasticity (Berg and Kleinfeld, 2003; Simony et al., 2010; Haidarliu et al., 2015). Animals can modify the pattern of whisker movements upon sensory feedback during natural behavior, as has been demonstrated for example during gap crossing and prey capture (Anjum and Brecht, 2012; Voigts et al., 2015). The neural control of reflexive whisker movements and adaptation thereof is still largely unknown. We show here, at least for a specific reproducible form of whisker adaptation, that this is under control of the cerebellum.\n\nComplex spike activity in relation to reflexive whisker movements\n\nThe functional role of complex spike responses is still under debate. Whereas some advocate a primary role as a dynamic metronome driving motor timing (Lang et al., 1999; Yamamoto et al., 2001; Llinás, 2011), others claim a more indirect role as a teacher guiding motor learning through sensory error signals (Ito, 2001; Yang and Lisberger, 2014; Herzfeld et al., 2018), or a combination of these short-time and long-term functions (Van Der Giessen et al., 2008; Mathy et al., 2009; Ten Brinke et al., 2015). The whisker stimulation in our paradigm resulted in strong complex spike responses particularly in the lateral PCs of crus 1. Even though the complex spikes were present only in a minority of the trials of individual PCs, the complex spike responses typically occurred simultaneously in many PCs, highlighting a putative role for ensemble encoding (Mukamel et al., 2009; Ozden et al., 2009; Schultz et al., 2009; Hoogland et al., 2015). Indeed, not only did the complex spike responses increase prior to whisker protraction, but the coherent firing of these complex spikes also proved to be correlated with increased protraction (Figures 4 and 5), which is in line with previous studies showing that complex spikes can facilitate the initiation of movements and define their amplitude (Welsh et al., 1995; Kitazawa et al., 1998; Hoogland et al., 2015). Possibly, the complex spikes of the PCs on one side of the cerebellum also contribute to the whisker movements on the contralateral side via bilateral projections of the cerebellar nuclei to the reticular formation (Teune et al., 2000), because stimulating the contralateral whisker pad also resulted in a strong protraction, while the complex spikes on the ipsilateral side were much less responsive during contralateral stimulation (Figure 7). The level of complex spike firing was correlated to the level of whisker retraction induced by the initial air flow, which agrees with the notion that complex spikes often signal the mismatch between the actual and expected sensory input (Gilbert and Thach, 1977; Gellman et al., 1983; Graf et al., 1988; Stone and Lisberger, 1990). Hence, complex spikes of the whisker regions in the cerebellar cortex are associated with both sensory responses and the generation of motor output.\n\nSimple spike firing during normal and adapted whisker movements\n\nOur electrophysiological recordings indicate that the simple spike activity of many PCs in crus 2 correlates well with whisker protraction and that this relation is context-dependent. Under the baseline condition of our paradigm, during the 0.5 Hz whisker pad stimulation, the simple spikes correlate on single trial basis well with the position of the whiskers during protraction. The correlation between more simple spikes and more protraction was also found when comparing the impact of contralateral vs. ipsilateral whisker pad stimulation. The absence of a clear time lag or lead between the simple spike activity and the whisker movements under this condition suggests that during normal motor performance without sensorimotor mismatch signaling the simple spikes represent the ongoing movement. Our data under baseline conditions are also compatible with those obtained by the labs of Chadderton and Léna (Proville et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016). In their studies on online motor performance, the simple spike activity of most PCs in the lateral crus 1 and/or crus 2 regions correlated best with protraction of the set point, defined as the slowly varying midpoint between maximal protraction and maximal retraction. This relation was, as in our study, state-dependent in that the general level of movement activity had a strong impact on the correlation between simple spike firing and whisker movement. However, our data revealed that under the training condition, during and directly after the 4 Hz tetanic stimulation protocol, the temporal dynamics of the simple spikes shifted. As a result, the best correlation between simple spikes and whisker position was now found to precede the whisker movement and to predict the magnitude of the protraction, suggesting an instructive motor function for the simple spikes during learning. Thus, the current dataset confirms and expands on previous studies, highlighting a role of the cerebellar PCs injecting additional accelerating and amplifying signals into the cerebellar nuclei during entrainment.\n\nCerebellar plasticity\n\nSynaptic plasticity in the cerebellar cortex has, next to that in the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei (Lisberger and Miles, 1980; Lisberger, 1998), generally been recognized as one of the major mechanisms underlying motor learning (Ito, 2001, 2003). Most attention has been directed towards LTD of the parallel fiber-to-PC synapse (Albus, 1971; Ito, 2003; Linden, 2003). Indeed, sparsification of simple spike firing happens during eyeblink conditioning (Jirenhed et al., 2007; Ten Brinke et al., 2015), while trial-over-trial suppression of simple spike firing occurs during smooth pursuit training (Yang and Lisberger, 2014; Herzfeld et al., 2018). In recent years, other forms of synaptic plasticity have also attracted attention, calling into question whether parallel fiber LTD is the only dominant mechanism in the cerebellar cortex underlying learning. Several forms of procedural learning, such as adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, turned out to be impaired in various genetic mouse models deficient in parallel fiber-to-PC LTP (Schonewille et al., 2010; Ly et al., 2013; Rahmati et al., 2014; Peter et al., 2016; Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017). These findings were corroborated using optogenetic stimulation of PCs in the vestibulocerebellum so as to increase the gain of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (Voges et al., 2017). Cerebellar plasticity may therefore be more heterogeneous than previously thought (Hansel et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2012; D’Angelo et al., 2016). The dominant form of plasticity in the cerebellar cortex may vary dependent on the zebrin-expression pattern of the PC module involved (De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015). PCs in zebrin-positive modules, which have a relatively low baseline simple spike firing rate with ample room for increases, may be more prone for induction of potentiation, whereas the zebrin-negative zones, which have a relatively high baseline firing rate, may tend to engage various forms of plasticity that promote simple spike suppression (Zhou et al., 2014; De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015). The area in which we found the strongest correlation between simple spike firing and whisker position is largely zebrin-positive, predominantly corresponding to the 6+ and 7+ zones (Sugihara and Quy, 2007). Accordingly, most PCs in our study had a relatively low baseline simple spike frequency (Figure 11 – Figure supplement 1C) and two independent mouse models lacking parallel fiber LTP specifically in their PCs (i.e., the L7-PP2B and L7-GluA3 mice) manifested robust impairments in adaptation of whisker protraction. In addition, the PCs that were engaged in adaptation of whisker protraction did not only show an increase in their simple spike response, but they also showed only a weak complex spike response during the training stimuli, which is indeed permissive for the induction of parallel fiber-to-PC LTP (Coesmans et al., 2004). Thus, our study is one of the first to show a direct coupling between an increase in simple spike firing and motor learning, with both phenomena being absent in independent mouse models lacking parallel fiber LTP.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nWhisker protraction can be elicited as a reflex following mechanical manipulation and the short-term kinematics of this reflex appears to be at least partly facilitated by coherent complex spike activity of PCs in the lateral part of crus 1. The long-term kinematics of the reflex can be adapted by tetanic stimulation and this process is probably largely mediated by increases in simple spike activity of PCs in the lateral part of crus 2, which may have been facilitated by the induction of LTP at their parallel fiber inputs. The differentially distributed, short-term and long-term cerebellum-dependent modulation of whisker movements may well play a role in motor coordination and adaptation during performance and acquisition of whisking behaviors like gap crossing and prey capture, which probably require both fast reflexes and long-term skills (Anjum and Brecht, 2012; Voigts et al., 2015). When compared to other motor behaviors controlled by other zebrin-positive regions, such as adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex around different axes in space controlled by different modules in the flocculus of the vestibulocerebellum (Simpson et al., 1996; Ito, 2003; De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015), the whisker system appears to be rather unique in that it is the first of its kind in which different modular regions of the cerebellar cortex appear to control the same motor domain with complementary roles in differentially guiding the short-term and long-term dynamics of the movement involved.\n\nCompeting financial interests\n\nThe authors declare no competing financial interests.\n\nMethods\n\nAnimals\n\nIn this study, we used two different mutant mouse lines, both on a C57Bl/6J background. Comparisons of electophysiological parameters were always made between the mutant mice and their respective wild-type (WT) littermates, although for easier visualization the WTs were sometimes grouped as indicated in the figure legends. Both mouse lines had been used before and details on their generation have been published. Briefly, L7-PP2B mice (Tg(Pcp2-cre)2MPin;Ppp3r1tm1Stl) lacked functional PP2B specifically in their Purkinje cells (PCs). They were created by crossing mice in which the gene for the regulatory subunit (CNB1) of PP2B was flanked by loxP sites (Zeng et al., 2001) with transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the L7 (Pcp2) promoter (Barski et al., 2000) as described in Schonewille et al. (2010). L7-Cre+/--cnb1f/f mice (“L7-PP2B mice”) were compared with L7-Cre-/--cnb1f/f littermate controls. We used 35 WT mice (17 males and 18 females of 21 ± 9 weeks of age (average ± s.d.)) and 22 L7-PP2B mice (6 males and 16 females of 18 ± 10 weeks of age (average ± s.d.)). L7-GluA3 mice (Tg(Pcp2-cre)2MPin;Gria3tm2Rsp) lacked the AMPA receptor GluA3 subunit specifically in their PCs. They were created by crossing mice in which the Gria3 gene was flanked by loxP sites (Sanchis-Segura et al., 2006) with transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the L7 (Pcp2) promoter (Barski et al., 2000) as described in Gutierrez-Castellanos et al. (2017). We used L7-Cre+/--Gria3f/f mice (“L7-GluA3 mice”) and L7-Cre-/--Gria3f/f as littermate controls. We used 5 WT male mice (25 ± 3 weeks of age (average ± s.d.)) and 9 L7-GluA3 mice (6 males and 3 females of 26 ± 4 weeks of age (average ± s.d.)). Mutants and wild-types were measured in random sequence. For the two-photon Ca2+ imaging experiments, we used 6 male C57Bl/6J mice (Charles Rivers, Leiden, the Netherlands) of 4-12 weeks of age. The photostimulation experiments were performed on 7 mice (3 males and 4 females of 25 ± 1 weeks of age (average ± s.d.)) expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 exclusively in their PCs (Tg(Pcp2-cre)2MPin;Gt(ROSA)26Sortm27.1(CAG-COP4*H134R/tdTomato)Hze) as described previously (Witter et al., 2013). The lack of impact of gender on key parameters of this study was documented in Table S4. All mice were socially housed until surgery and single-housed afterwards. The mice were kept at a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and had not been used for any invasive procedure (except genotyping shortly after birth) before the start of the experiment. All mice used were specific-pathogen free (SPF). All experimental procedures were approved a priori by an independent animal ethical committee (DEC-Consult, Soest, The Netherlands) as required by Dutch law and conform the relevant institutional regulations of the Erasmus MC and Dutch legislation on animal experimentation.\n\nSurgery\n\nAll mice that were used for electrophysiology received a magnetic pedestal that was attached to the skull above bregma using Optibond adhesive (Kerr Corporation, Orange, CA) and a craniotomy was made on top of crus 1 and crus 2. The surgical procedures were performed under isoflurane anesthesia (2-4% V/V in O2). Post-surgical pain was treated with 5 mg/kg carprofen (“Rimadyl”, Pfizer, New York, NY, USA), 1 μg lidocaine (Braun, Meisingen, Germany), 1 μg bupivacaine (Actavis, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ, USA) and 50 μg/kg buprenorphine (“Temgesic”, Indivior, Richmond, VA, USA). After three days of recovery, mice were habituated to the recording setup during at least 2 daily sessions of approximately 45 min. In the recording setup they were head-fixed using the magnetic pedestal. The mice used for two-photon imaging received a head plate with a sparing on the location of the craniotomy instead of a pedestal. The head plate was attached to the skull with dental cement (Superbond C&B, Sun Medical Co., Moriyama City, Japan). To prevent the growth of scar tissue, which could affect image quality, two-photon recordings were made on the day of the surgery (recording started at least 1 h after the termination of anesthesia).\n\nWhisker stimulation and tracking\n\nAir puff stimulation to the whisker pad was applied with a frequency of 0.5 Hz s at a distance of approximately 3 mm at an angle of approximately 35° (relative to the body axis). The puffs were delivered using a tube with a diameter of approximately 1 mm with a pressure of ∼2 bar and a duration of 30 ms. During the induction period, the stimulation frequency was increased to 4 Hz and 80 puffs were given. In a subset of experiments, a 2 ms air puff (pre-pulse) was delivered 100 ms prior to the 30 ms puff. Videos of the whiskers were made from above using a bright LED panel as backlight (λ = 640 nm) at a frame rate of 1,000 Hz (480×500 pixels using an A504k camera from Basler Vision Technologies, Ahrensburg, Germany). The whiskers were not trimmed or cut.\n\nElectrophysiology\n\nElectrophysiological recordings were performed in awake L7-PP2B WT mice using either glass pipettes (3-6 MΩ) or quartz-coated platinum/tungsten electrodes (2-5 MΩ, outer diameter = 80 μm, Thomas Recording, Giessen, Germany). The latter electrodes were placed in an 8×4 matrix (Thomas Recording), with an inter-electrode distance of 305 μm. Prior to the recordings, the mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane to remove the dura, bring them in the setup and adjust all manipulators. Recordings started at least 60 min after termination of anesthesia and were made in crus 1 and crus 2 ipsilateral to the side of the whisker pad stimulation at a minimal depth of 500 μm. The electrophysiological signal was digitized at 25 kHz, using a 1-6,000 Hz band-pass filter, 22x pre-amplified and stored using a RZ2 multi-channel workstation (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL).\n\nNeural tracing & electrolytic lesions\n\nFor the neural tracing experiments, we used glass electrodes filled with 2 M NaCl for juxtacellular recordings. After a successful recording of a PC, neural tracer was pressure injected (3 × 10 ms with a pressure of 0.7 bar) either from the same pipette re-inserted at the same location or from the second barrel or a double barrel pipette. We used a gold-lectin conjugate has described previously (Ruigrok et al., 1995) (n = 3) or biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) 3000 (10 mg/ml in 0.9% NaCl; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) (n = 7). Five days after the tracer injection, the mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (80 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and fixated by transcardial perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and sliced (40 μm thick). The slices were processed by Nissl staining. Experiments were included in the analysis if the electrophysiology fulfilled the requirements mentioned above with a recording duration of at least 50 s and if the tracer was clearly visible. For BDA 3000 this implied that it was taken up by the PCs at the injection spot and transported to the axonal boutons a single subgroup in the cerebellar nuclei. BDA 3000 was also found in the inferior olive. For the gold-lectin conjugate the subnucleus of the inferior olive was considered. Based upon the subnuclei of the cerebellar nuclei and/or the inferior olive, the sagittal zone of the recording site was identified according to the scheme published in Apps and Hawkes (2009).\n\nAfter the recordings made with the quartz/platinum electrodes, electrolytic lesions were applied to selected electrodes in order to retrieve the recording locations. To this end, we applied a DC current of 20 μA for 20 s. This typically resulted in a lesion that could be visualized after Nissl staining of 40 μm thick slices made of perfused brains. We accepted a spot as a true lesion if it was visible in at least 2 consecutive slices at the same location. In total, we could retrieve 16 successful lesions. Recording locations were approximated using pictures of the entry points of the electrodes in combination with the locations of the lesions.\n\nTwo-photon Ca2+ imaging\n\nAfter the surgery (see above) with the dura mater intact, the surface of the cerebellar cortex was rinsed with extracellular solution composed of (in mM) 150 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). After a 30 minute recovery period from anesthesia animals were head-fixed in the recording setup and received a bolus-loading of the cell-permeant fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Cal-520 AM (0.2 mM; AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The dye was first dissolved with 10% w/V Pluronic F-127 in DMSO (Invitrogen) and diluted 20x in the extracellular solution. The dye solution was pressure injected into the molecular layer (50–80 μm below the surface) at 0.35 bar for 5 min. After dye loading, the brain surface was covered with 2% agarose dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl) in order to reduce motion artefacts and prevent dehydration.\n\nStarting at least 30 min after dye injection, in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging was performed of the molecular layer using a setup consisting of a titanium sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA), a TriM Scope II system (LaVisionBioTec, Bielefeld, Germany) mounted on a BX51 microscope with a 20x 1.0 NA water immersion objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and GaAsP photomultiplier detectors (Hamamatsu, Iwata City, Japan). A typical recording sampled 40 × 200 μm with a frame rate of approximately 25 Hz.\n\nData inclusion\n\nWe included all mice measured during this study, with the exception of one mouse where video-analysis revealed that the air puff was delivered more to the nose than to the whisker pad. Single-unit data was included if the recording was of sufficient quality and reflected the activity of a single PC according to the rules defined below (see section Electrophysiological analysis).\n\nWhisker tracking\n\nWhisker movements were tracked offline as described previously (Rahmati et al., 2014) using a method based on the BIOTACT Whisker Tracking Tool (Perkon et al., 2011). We used the average angle of all trackable large facial whiskers for further quantification of whisker behavior.\n\nThe impact of 4 Hz tetanic stimulation on air puff-triggered whisker movement was quantified using a bootstrap method. First, we took the last 100 trials before induction and divided these randomly in two series of 50. We calculated the differences in whisker position between these two series, and repeated this 1000 times. From this distribution we derived the expected variation after whisker pad air puff stimulation. We took the 99% confidence interval as the threshold to which we compared the difference between 50 randomly chosen trials after and 50 randomly chosen trials before induction (Figure 10C).\n\nElectrophysiological analysis\n\nSpikes were detected offline using SpikeTrain (Neurasmus, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). A recording was considered to originate from a single PC when it contained both complex spikes (identified by the presence of stereotypic spikelets) and simple spikes, when the minimal inter-spike interval of simple spikes was 3 ms and when each complex spike was followed by a pause in simple spike firing of at least 8 ms. The regularity of simple spike firing was expressed as the local variation (CV2) and calculated as 2|ISIn+1-ISIn|/(ISIn+1+ISIn) with ISI = inter-simple spike interval (Shin et al., 2007). Only single-unit recordings of PCs with a minimum recording duration of 200 s were selected for further analysis. However, for the neural tracing experiments (see below), on which no quantitative analysis was performed, we accepted a minimum recording duration of 50 s.\n\nTwo-photon Ca2+ imaging analysis\n\nImage analysis was performed offline using custom made software as described and validated previously (Ozden et al., 2012; De Gruijl et al., 2014). In short, we performed independent component analysis to define the areas of individual Purkinje cell dendrites (Figure 4A). The fluorescent values of all pixels in each region of interest were averaged per frame. These averages were plotted over time using a high-pass filter. A 8% rolling baseline was subtracted with a time window of 0.5 ms (Ozden et al., 2012). Ca2+ transients were detected using template matching.\n\nFor the aggregate peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) (Figure 4D), we calculated per individual frame the number of complex spikes detected and made a PSTH color coding the number of simultaneously detected complex spikes. Based upon the total number of complex spikes and dendrites per recording, we calculated the expected number of simultaneous complex spikes per individual frame based upon a Poisson distribution. The actual number of simultaneous complex spikes was compared to this calculated distribution and a p value was derived for each number based upon the Poisson distribution (Figure 4E).\n\nCharacterization of sensory responses\n\nFor each PC recording, we constructed PSTHs of complex spikes and simple spikes separately using a bin size of 10 ms for display purposes. For further quantitative analyses of the PSTHs, we used a bin size of 1 ms and convolved them with a 21 ms wide Gaussian kernel. Complex spike responses were characterized by their peak amplitude, defined as the maximum of the convolved PSTH and expressed in percentage of trials in which a complex spike occurred within a 1 ms bin. Latencies were taken as the time between stimulus onset and the time of the response peak, as determined from the convolved PSTH.\n\nFor some analyses, we discriminated between the sensory response period (0-60 ms after stimulus onset) and inter-trial interval (500 to 200 ms before stimulus onset). We considered a PC responsive for sensory stimulation if the peak or trough in the PSTH in the 60 ms after the stimulus onset exceeded the threshold of 3 s.d. above or below the average of the pre-stimulus interval (1 ms bins convolved with a 21 ms Gaussian kernel, pre-stimulus interval 200 ms before stimulus onset).\n\nLong-term stability of electrophysiological recordings was verified by heat maps of time-shifted PSTHs (e.g., see Figures 9E and 11E). The time-shifted PSTH was processed by calculating the simple spike PSTH for 20 air puffs per row, which were shifted by 5 air puffs between neighboring rows. The simple spike rates per row are calculated at 1 ms resolution and convolved with a 21 ms Gaussian kernel and color-coded relative to baseline firing rate (−1000 to −200 ms relative to air puff time).\n\nCluster analysis\n\nA principal component analysis showed that the heterogeneity among the sensory complex spike responses was driven almost exclusively by one parameter, the maximum amplitude peak of the convolved complex spike PSTH. We performed a univariate Gaussian mixture model using only that variable. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) indicated that the model with two components with unequal variances yielded the best approximation of the data. Then we applied the function Mclust(data) in R (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) which use the expectation-maximization algorithm in order to assert the main parameters of the resulting models (probability, mean and variance of each population).\n\nSpikes-whisker movement correlation matrix\n\nTrial-by-trial correlation between instantaneous simple spike firing rate and whisker position was performed as described before (Ten Brinke et al., 2015). In short: spike density functions were computed for all trials by convolving spike occurrences across 1 ms bins with an 8 ms Gaussian kernel. Both spike and whisker data were aligned to the 200 ms baseline. For cell groups, data was standardized for each cell for each correlation, and then pooled. The spike-whisker Pearson correlation coefficient R was calculated in bin of 10 ms, resulting in a 40×40 R-value matrix showing correlations for −100 to 300 ms around the air puff presentation.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nGroup sizes of the blindly acquired data sets were not defined a priori as the effect size and variation were not known beforehand. A post hoc power calculation based upon the results of the potentiation of the PC responses to whisker pad stimulation of the “weak complex spike responders” indicated a minimum group size of 12 PCs (α = 5%, β = 20%, Δ = 9.65%, s.d. = 10.59%, paired t test). This number was obtained for the “weak complex spike responders” in WT (n = 35), L7-PP2B (n = 21) and L7-GluA3 PCs (n = 13), as well as for the relatively rare “strong complex spike responders” in WT mice (n = 20). This was further substantiated by other independent analyses, including ANOVA and linear regression, as described in the Results section. Variations in success rate, especially considering recordings of longer duration in combination with video tracking, explain why some groups are larger than others. Data was excluded only in case of a signal to noise ratio that was insufficient to warrant reliable analysis. For data visualization and statistical analysis, we counted the number of PCs as the number of replicates for the spike-based analyses and the number of mice for the behavior-based analyses.\n\nWe tested whether the observed increase in coherence after sensory stimulation (Figure 4D-G) was more than expected from the increased firing rate induced by the stimulation. The expected coherence based on the firing rate was calculated from 1000 bootstrapped traces from the inhomogeneous Poisson spike trains made for each neuron. The resultant distribution was compared to the measured distribution using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\nStacked line plots were generated by cumulating the values of all subjects per time point. Thus, the first line (darkest color) represents the first subject, the second line the sum of the first two, the third line the first three, etcetera. The data are divided by the number of subjects, so that the last line (brightest color) represents, next to the increase from the one but last value, also the population average.\n\nSample size and measures for mean and variation are specified throughout the text and figure legends. For normally distributed data (as evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) parametric tests were used. Comparisons were always made with 2-sided tests when applicable. Unpaired t test were always made with Welch correction for possible differences in s.d.\n\nData and software availability\n\nAll relevant data is available from the authors. Custom written Matlab code to complement the whisker tracking analysis by the BIOTACT Whisker Tracking Tool was used as described previously (Rahmati et al., 2014) and can be obtained from the authors.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nFinancial support was provided by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO-ALW; C.I.D.Z.), the Dutch Organization for Medical Sciences (ZonMW; C.I.D.Z.), Life Sciences (C.I.D.Z.), ERC-adv and ERC-POC (C.I.D.Z.) and the China Scholarship Council (No. 2010623033; C.J.).
