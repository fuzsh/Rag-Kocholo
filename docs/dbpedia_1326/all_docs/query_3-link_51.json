        "text": "Multimorbidity (i.e., the coexistence of 2 or more chronic conditions in an individual) is increasingly recognized as a pressing public health problem. Effective interventions targeting coexisting depression and obesity are critical given the high prevalence and worsened outcomes for patients with both conditions. ENGAGE-2 is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The objective is to investigate the outcomes and mechanisms of an integrated depression and obesity intervention that combines collaborative stepped depression treatment and evidence-based behavioral weight loss treatment. The Integrated Coaching for Better Mood and Weight-2 (I-CARE2) intervention synergistically integrates 2 proven national programs: the Program to Encourage Active and Rewarding Lives (PEARLS) for depression care and the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk reduction. In Phase 1 of the ENGAGE project, investigators developed a new protocol to quantify activation and connectivity of the Affective, Cognitive Control, and Default Mode brain circuits from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) among 108 depressed obese patients. Investigators implement the same fMRI protocol in this second phase of the project to examine the mechanistic role of these brain circuits as potential neural targets in treatment engagement and response in the I-CARE2 intervention. A new sample of 105 depressed obese patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive the I-CARE2 intervention (n=70) or usual care (n=35). Study assessments occur at 0 (baseline), 2 and 6 months. Investigators hypothesize that 1 or more of the neural targets under study will moderate (baseline state) and/or mediate (change at follow-up) the effect of the I-CARE2 intervention versus usual care on health behaviors (problem-solving ability, dietary intakes, physical activity) and clinical outcomes (weight loss, depression, anxiety).\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.\n\nView full details\n\nAbstract\n\nAIMS: Hyperkalaemia is a common complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and limits the optimal use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In patients with CKD, sodium‒glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors provide cardiorenal protection, but whether they affect the risk of hyperkalaemia remains uncertain.METHODS AND RESULTS: The CREDENCE trial randomized 4401 participants with T2DM and CKD to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin or matching placebo. In this post hoc analysis using an intention-to-treat approach, we assessed the effect of canagliflozin on a composite outcome of time to either investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or the initiation of potassium binders. We also analysed effects on central laboratory-determined hyper- and hypokalaemia (serum potassium ≥6.0 and <3.5mmol/L, respectively) and change in serum potassium. At baseline, the mean serum potassium in canagliflozin and placebo arms was 4.5mmol/L; 4395 (99.9%) participants were receiving renin-angiotensin system blockade. The incidence of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders was lower with canagliflozin than with placebo [occurring in 32.7 vs. 41.9 participants per 1000 patient-years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.95, P=0.014]. Canagliflozin similarly reduced the incidence of laboratory-determined hyperkalaemia (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98, P=0.031), with no effect on the risk of hypokalaemia (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71-1.20, P=0.53). The mean serum potassium over time with canagliflozin was similar to that of placebo.CONCLUSION: Among patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibition with canagliflozin may reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia in people with T2DM and CKD without increasing the risk of hypokalaemia.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/eurheartj/ehab497\n\nView details for PubMedID 34423370\n\nAbstract\n\nAIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Higher plasma concentrations of tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-1, TNFR-2 and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) have been found to be associated with higher risk of kidney failure in individuals with type 2 diabetes in previous studies. Whether drugs can reduce these biomarkers is not well established. We measured these biomarkers in samples of the CANVAS study and examined the effect of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin on these biomarkers and assessed whether the early change in these biomarkers predict cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes in the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS).METHODS: Biomarkers were measured with immunoassays (proprietary multiplex assay performed by RenalytixAI, New York, NY, USA) at baseline and years 1, 3 and 6. Mixed-effects models for repeated measures assessed the effect of canagliflozin vs placebo on the biomarkers. Associations of baseline levels and the early change (baseline to year 1) for each biomarker with the kidney outcome were assessed using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression.RESULTS: In total, 3523/4330 (81.4%) of the CANVAS participants had available samples at baseline. Each doubling in baseline TNFR-1, TNFR-2 and KIM-1 was associated with a higher risk of kidney outcomes, with corresponding HRs of 3.7 (95% CI 2.3, 6.1; p<0.01), 2.7 (95% CI 2.0, 3.6; p<0.01) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.2, 1.8; p<0.01), respectively. Canagliflozin reduced the level of the plasma biomarkers with differences in TNFR-1, TNFR-2 and KIM-1 between canagliflozin and placebo during follow-up of 2.8% (95% CI 3.4%, 1.3%; p<0.01), 1.9% (95% CI 3.5%, 0.2%; p=0.03) and 26.7% (95% CI 30.7%, 22.7%; p<0.01), respectively. Within the canagliflozin treatment group, each 10% reduction in TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 at year 1 was associated with a lower risk of the kidney outcome (HR 0.8 [95% CI 0.7, 1.0; p=0.02] and 0.9 [95% CI 0.9, 1.0; p<0.01] respectively), independent of other patient characteristics. The baseline and 1year change in biomarkers did not associate with cardiovascular or heart failure outcomes.CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Canagliflozin decreased KIM-1 and modestly reduced TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 compared with placebo in individuals with type 2 diabetes in CANVAS. Early decreases in TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 during canagliflozin treatment were independently associated with a lower risk of kidney disease progression, suggesting that TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 have the potential to be pharmacodynamic markers of response to canagliflozin.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00125-021-05512-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 34415356\n\nAbstract\n\nAIMS: To determine the reasons for hospitalizations in the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program and the effects of the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin on hospitalization.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A secondary analysis was performed on the CANVAS Program that included 10,142 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus randomized to canagliflozin or placebo. The primary outcome was total (first plus all recurrent) all-cause hospitalization (ACH). Secondary outcomes were total hospitalizations categorized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities hierarchy at the system organ class level, reported by investigators at each center. Outcomes were assessed using negative binomial models.RESULTS: Of the 7115 hospitalizations reported, the most common reasons were cardiac disorders (23.7%), infections and infestations (15.0%), and nervous system disorders (9.0%). The rate of total ACH was lower in the canagliflozin group (n=5795) compared to the placebo group (n=4347): 197.9 versus 215.8 participants per 1000 patient-years, respectively (rate ratio [RR] 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86, 0.98). Canagliflozin reduced the rate of total hospitalizations due to cardiac disorders (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.75, 0.88). There was no significant difference between the canagliflozin and placebo groups in the rates of total hospitalizations due to infections and infestations (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.86, 1.02) or nervous system disorders (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.88, 1.05).CONCLUSIONS: In the CANVAS Program, the most common reasons for hospitalization were cardiac disorders, infections and infestations, and nervous system disorders. Canagliflozin, compared with placebo, reduced the rate of total ACH. This article is protected by copyright.

Intravenous cangrelor provides direct, immediate onset and rapid-offset P2Y12 inhibition, which may reduce the necessity for oral P2Y12 pretreatment.METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed, estimating the annual impact over 3 years of cangrelor availability. Ischemic and bleeding events (48h) from randomized clinical trial data were extrapolated to 30 days. Event costs were from the CHAMPION PHOENIX Economics substudy. Rates of coronary artery disease (CAD) presentation, PCI, oral P2Y12 pretreatment, and inpatient hospitalization costs were from published literature and clinical experts. Scenario analyses evaluated the impact of cangrelor availability on potential reduced P2Y12 pretreatment rates by 50-100%. Drug costs were 2019 wholesale acquisition costs and, where necessary, all costs were adjusted to 2019 dollars.RESULTS: In a hospital treating 1000 CAD PCI inpatients annually, increasing cangrelor use from 11 to 32% resulted in a reduction in 48-h ischemic events/year by 5.7%, while bleeding events increased by 2.9%. Total costs of $1,135,472 declined 12.8%, with a 50% reduction in P2Y12 pretreatment or 30% with no pretreatment. Savings were driven by a decrease in ischemic events, decrease in glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use, and less need for and shorter oral P2Y12 inhibitor washout period for surgery patients.CONCLUSION: Use of cangrelor in patients with two or more angiographic HRFs may improve outcomes and lower hospital budgets, mainly from avoiding surgery delays necessitated by oral P2Y12 inhibitor pretreatment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40256-021-00491-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 34331235\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: A reduced ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a measure of atherosclerosis and is associated with ischemic risk in the general population. Whether this relationship is maintained in peripheral artery disease after lower extremity revascularization (LER), which can modify ABI, is unknown.METHODS: The EUCLID (Examining Use of Ticagrelor in Peripheral Artery Disease) enrolled 13 885 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease; 57% with prior LER, and 43% with ABI ≤0.80. The primary major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. Major adverse limb events (MALE) included acute limb ischemia and major amputation. An adjusted Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between ABI and outcomes. A restricted cubic spline model with 4 knots was developed to identify the best fitting model to describe the relationship between ABI and MACE and MALE risk.RESULTS: Baseline ABI (mean±SD) was 0.77±0.21 in participants with prior LER and 0.63±0.14 in those without prior LER (P<0.0001). There was no statistical interaction between prior LER and ABI, meaning the shapes of the cubic spline models were similar between groups. In those with prior LER, for every 0.10 unit lower ABI below an ABI of 1.00, the hazard ratio for MACE was 1.08 (95% CI, 1.04-1.12; P<0.0001), below an ABI of 0.80 the hazard ratio for MALE was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.21-1.43; P<0.0001). In patients without prior LER, every 0.10 unit lower ABI below an ABI of 0.70 was associated with increased risk for MACE (hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.06-1.23]; P=0.0004) and MALE (hazard ratio, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.08-1.49]; P=0.003).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with established peripheral artery disease, particularly those with prior LER, have an increased risk of MACE and MALE. The ABI remains a strong predictor of MACE and MALE ischemic events with an inverse relationship below an ABI threshold for patients with and without prior LER.REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT01732822.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.120.009871\n\nView details for PubMedID 34253048\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are critical in advancing patient care, yet conducting such large-scale trials requires tremendous resources and coordination. Clinical site start-up performance metrics can provide insight into opportunities for improved trial efficiency but have not been well described.Objective: To measure the start-up time needed to reach prespecified milestones across sites in large cardiovascular RCTs in North America and to evaluate how these metrics vary by time and type of regulatory review process.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study evaluated cardiovascular RCTs conducted from July 13, 2004, to February 1, 2017. The RCTs were coordinated by a single academic research organization, the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Nine consecutive trials with completed enrollment and publication of results in their target journal were studied. Data were analyzed from December 4, 2019, to January 11, 2021.Exposures: Year of trial enrollment initiation (2004-2007 vs 2008-2012) and use of a central vs local institutional review board (IRB).Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the median start-up time (from study protocol delivery to first participant enrollment) as compared by trial year and type of IRB used. The median start-up time for the top 10% of sites was also reported. Secondary outcomes included time to site regulatory approval, time to contract execution, and time to site activation.Results: For the 9 RCTs included, the median site start-up time shortened only slightly over time from 267 days (interquartile range [IQR], 185-358 days) for 2004-2007 trials to 237 days (IQR, 162-343 days) for 2008-2012 trials (overall median, 255 days [IQR, 177-350 days]; P<.001). For the top 10% of sites, median start-up time was 107 days (IQR, 95-121 days) for 2004-2007 trials vs 104 days (IQR, 84-118 days) for 2008-2012 trials (overall median, 106 days [IQR, 90-120 days]; P=.04). The median start-up time was shorter among sites using a central IRB (199 days [IQR, 140-292 days]) than those using a local IRB (287 days [IQR, 205-390 days]; P<.001).Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study of North American research sites in large cardiovascular RCTs found a duration of nearly 9 months from the time of study protocol delivery to the first participant enrollment; this metric was only slightly shortened during the study period but was reduced to less than 4 months for top-performing sites. These findings suggest that the use of central IRBs has the potential to improve RCT efficiency.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.17963\n\nView details for PubMedID 34297072\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are predisposed to derangements in serum Magnesium (Mg), which may have implications for cardiometabolic events and outcomes. In clinical trials, participants with T2D randomized to sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown mild to moderate increases in serum Mg from baseline levels. This post hoc analysis assesses the relation between serum Mg with cardiovascular outcomes in 10,140 participants of the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program.Methods: We evaluated the association of baseline serum Mg with the primary composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke, and tested whether this association is modified by baseline serum Mg. Using mediation analysis, we determined whether change in serum Mg post-randomization mediates the beneficial effect of canagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes.Results: Mean serum Mg levels at baseline were 0.77±0.09mmol/L in both canagliflozin group and placebo groups. The canagliflozin group experienced an average increase in serum Mg by 0.07mmol/L (95% CI, 0.065-0.072mmol/L; p<.001) for the duration of the trial. We found no association between baseline serum Mg levels and the primary composite end point, and no evidence of effect modification by baseline Mg levels. Change in serum Mg post-randomization was not a mediator of the effects of canagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes.Conclusions: In participants of the CANVAS Program, baseline and post-randomization serum Mg levels are not associated with cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/edm2.247\n\nView details for PubMedID 34277971\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients with chronic kidney disease may develop new or more severe anemia when treated with antiplatelet agents due to blood loss in conjunction with impaired erythropoiesis. Because anemia independently predicts limb amputation and mortality among patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), we evaluated the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the EUCLID trial in which patients with symptomatic PAD were randomized to ticagrelor or clopidogrel. At baseline, 9025, 1870, and 1000 patients had eGFR ⩾ 60, 45-59, and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. The mean fall in Hb during the trial was 0.46 ± 1.68 g/dL and did not differ by baseline eGFR category, although Hb fall ⩾ 10% was more frequent among patients with lower eGFR (p for trend < 0.0001). On-study treatment with iron, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and/or red blood cell transfusion was reported for 479 (5.3%), 165 (8.8%), and 129 (12.9%) patients in the three eGFR categories, respectively (p for trend < 0.0001). After adjustment for baseline and post-randomization effects, those not receiving anemia treatment had a smaller reduction in Hb from baseline than those receiving anemia treatment (p < 0.0001). Other determinants of Hb reduction included absence of on-study myocardial infarction, coronary or peripheral revascularization, residence outside North America, male sex, and baseline eGFR. We conclude that among patients with PAD treated with P2Y12 inhibitors, lower baseline eGFR was associated with a greater reduction in Hb.

Compared to those without diabetes, patients with non-insulin-treated diabetes had increased risks of stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.68), MI (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.17-2.30), all-cause death (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.46), vascular death (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11-1.60), and composite outcomes (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.18-1.157). Patients with insulin-treated diabetes had a significantly higher risk of MI (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.33-4.01) and composite outcomes (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.19-2.08) compared to those without diabetes. There were no significant differences between insulin-treated and non-insulin-treated diabetes for any outcome.Conclusion: Among patients with AF and diabetes, there were no significant differences in outcomes in insulin-treated diabetes compared to non-insulin-treated diabetes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.hroo.2021.04.001\n\nView details for PubMedID 34337571\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and heart failure (HF) are each independently associated with poor outcomes. Risk factors associated with new-onset HF in patients with primary PAD are unknown. Furthermore, how the presence of HF is associated with outcomes in patients with PAD is unknown. Methods and Results This analysis examined risk relationships of HF on outcomes in patients with symptomatic PAD randomized to ticagrelor or clopidogrel as part of the EUCLID (Examining Use of Ticagrelor in Peripheral Arterial Disease) trial. Patients were stratified based on presence of HF at enrollment. Cox models were used to determine the association of HF with outcomes. A separate Cox model was used to identify risk factors associated with development of HF during follow-up. Patients with PAD and HF had over twice the rate of concomitant coronary artery disease as those without HF. Patients with PAD and HF had significantly increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.13-1.51) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.19-1.63). In patients with PAD, the presence of HF was associated with significantly less bleeding (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.96). Characteristics associated with HF development included age ≥66 (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18-1.40 per 5years), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.41-2.43), and weight (bidirectionally associated, ≥76kg, HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.93; <76kg, HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16). Conclusions Patients with PAD and HF have a high rate of coronary artery disease with a high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events and death. These data support the possible need for aggressive treatment of (recurrent) atherosclerotic disease in PAD, especially patients with HF.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/JAHA.120.018684\n\nView details for PubMedID 34056910\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate or elevated albuminuria increases risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. This study assessed the effects of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on stroke and atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL) from CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) and a meta-analysis of large cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of SGLT2i in type 2 diabetes mellitus.METHODS: CREDENCE randomized 4401 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease to canagliflozin or placebo. Post hoc, we estimated effects on fatal or nonfatal stroke, stroke subtypes, and intermediate markers of stroke risk including AF/AFL. Stroke and AF/AFL data from 3 other completed large CVOTs and CREDENCE were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.RESULTS: In CREDENCE, 142 participants experienced a stroke during follow-up (10.9/1000 patient-years with canagliflozin, 14.2/1000 patient-years with placebo; hazard ratio [HR], 0.77 [95% CI, 0.55-1.08]). Effects by stroke subtypes were: ischemic (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.61-1.28]; n=111), hemorrhagic (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.19-1.32]; n=18), and undetermined (HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.20-1.46]; n=17). There was no clear effect on AF/AFL (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.53-1.10]; n=115). The overall effects in the 4 CVOTs combined were: total stroke (HRpooled, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.82-1.12]), ischemic stroke (HRpooled, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.89-1.14]), hemorrhagic stroke (HRpooled, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.30-0.83]), undetermined stroke (HRpooled, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.49-1.51]), and AF/AFL (HRpooled, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71-0.93]). There was evidence that SGLT2i effects on total stroke varied by baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (P=0.01), with protection in the lowest estimated glomerular filtration rate (<45 mL/min/1.73 m2]) subgroup (HRpooled, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.31-0.79]).CONCLUSIONS: Although we found no clear effect of SGLT2i on total stroke in CREDENCE or across trials combined, there was some evidence of benefit in preventing hemorrhagic stroke and AF/AFL, as well as total stroke for those with lowest estimated glomerular filtration rate. Future research should focus on confirming these data and exploring potential mechanisms.REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02065791.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.031623\n\nView details for PubMedID 33874750\n\nAbstract\n\nAIMS: Given the benefits of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition (SGLT2i) in protecting against heart failure in diabetic patients, we sought to explore the potential impact of SGLT2i on the clinical features of patients presenting with myocardial infarction (MI) through a post-hoc analysis of CANVAS Program and CREDENCE trial.METHODS AND RESULTS: Individuals with type 2 diabetes and history or high risk of cardiovascular disease (CANVAS Program) or type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CREDENCE) were included. The intervention was Canagliflozin 100 or 300mg (combined in the analysis) or placebo. MI events were adjudicated as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI as well as type 1MI or type 2MI. 421 first MI events in the CANVAS Program and 178 first MI events in the CREDENCE trial were recorded (83 fatal, 128 STEMI, 431 non-STEMI, and 40 unknown). No benefit of canagliflozin compared with placebo on time to first MI event was observed (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.75, 1.05). Canagliflozin was associated with lower risk for non-STEMI (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.65, 0.95) but suggested a possible increase in STEMI (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06, 2.27), with no difference in risk of type 1 or type 2MI. There was no change in fatal MI (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.78, 1.93).CONCLUSIONS: Canagliflozin was not associated with a reduction in overall MI in the pooled CANVAS Program and CREDENCE trial population. The possible differential effect on STEMI and Non-STEMI observed in the CANVAS cohort warrants further investigation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/cvr/cvab128\n\nView details for PubMedID 33826709\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have partial renal clearance and generally require dosage adjustments based on renal function. While current US and European guidance recommends dose adjustments in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD), it is unclear how often this is done appropriately in routine clinical practice.METHODS: We examined rates of appropriate and inappropriate dosing in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and moderate CKD, as determined by creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30-50 mL/min calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the rate of appropriate and inappropriate dosing as well as event rates.RESULTS: Among 1134 patients (8.5% of the overall ORBIT-AF II registry) with AF and CrCl 30-50 mL/min, the median age was 82 (25th, 75th percentile: 78, 86), 38% were male, and the median CHA2DS2VASC score was 4 (25th, 75th percentile: 4, 5). At baseline, more than one-third (34%) of patients with moderate CKD were inappropriately dosed with DOACs. When evaluating the specific prescribed doses in those with moderate CKD, 15% (N = 170/1134) were underdosed, 66% (743/1134) were appropriately dosed, and 20% (N = 221/1134) were overdosed. There were no significant differences in comorbid medical conditions between patients with moderate CKD who were appropriately and inappropriately dosed with a DOAC.CONCLUSION: In routine clinical practice, prescribing of DOACs in patients with AF with moderate CKD is often inconsistent with drug labeling, with up to one-third of patients being inappropriately dosed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40256-021-00473-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 33786798\n\nAbstract\n\nHeart failure is prevalent in those with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. In the CREDENCE trial canagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) or cardiovascular (CV) death by 31%. In this current analysis we sought to determine whether the effect of canagliflozin on HHF/CV death differed in subgroups defined by key baseline participant characteristics. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Canagliflozin was associated with a reduction in the relative risk of HHF/CV death regardless of age, sex, history of HF or CV disease, and the use of loop diuretics or GLP1 receptor agonists (all pinteraction >0.114). The absolute benefit of canagliflozin was greater in those at highest baseline risk, such as those with CV disease (50 fewer events/1000 patients treated over 2.5years versus 20 fewer events in those without CV disease) or advanced kidney disease (eGFR 30-45 ml/min/1.73m2 : 61 events prevented/1000 patients treated over 2.5years versus 23 events in eGFR 60-90 ml/min/1.73m2 ). Canagliflozin consistently reduces the proportional risk of HHF/CV death across a broad range of subgroups with greater absolute benefits in those at highest baseline risk.

Whether this applies to sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors is uncertain, particularly in patients with a very high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR; ≥3000 mg/g). We examined the association between baseline UACR and the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor, canagliflozin, on efficacy and safety outcomes in the Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) randomized controlled trial.DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The study enrolled 4401 participants with type 2 diabetes, an eGFR of 30 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and UACR of >300 to 5000 mg/g. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined the relative and absolute effects of canagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular, and safety outcomes according to a baseline UACR of ≤1000 mg/g (n=2348), >1000 to <3000 mg/g (n=1547), and ≥3000 mg/g (n=506). In addition, we examined the effects of canagliflozin on UACR itself, eGFR slope, and the intermediate outcomes of glycated hemoglobin, body weight, and systolic BP.RESULTS: Overall, higher UACR was associated with higher rates of kidney and cardiovascular events. Canagliflozin reduced efficacy outcomes for all UACR levels, with no evidence that relative benefits varied between levels. For example, canagliflozin reduced the primary composite outcome by 24% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.56 to 1.04) in the lowest UACR subgroup, 28% (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.93) in the UACR subgroup >1000 to <3000 mg/g, and 37% (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.84) in the highest subgroup (P heterogeneity=0.55). Absolute risk reductions for kidney outcomes were greater in participants with higher baseline albuminuria; the number of primary composite events prevented across ascending UACR categories were 17 (95% CI, 3 to 38), 45 (95% CI, 9 to 81), and 119 (95% CI, 35 to 202) per 1000 treated participants over 2.6 years (P heterogeneity=0.02). Rates of kidney-related adverse events were lower with canagliflozin, with a greater relative reduction in higher UACR categories.CONCLUSIONS: Canagliflozin safely reduces kidney and cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes and severely increased albuminuria. In this population, the relative kidney benefits were consistent over a range of albuminuria levels, with greatest absolute kidney benefit in those with an UACR ≥3000 mg/g.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov: CREDENCE, NCT02065791.PODCAST: This article contains a podcast at https://www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2021_02_22_CJN15260920_final.mp3.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2215/CJN.15260920\n\nView details for PubMedID 33619120\n\nAbstract\n\nAIMS: The CANVAS Program identified the effect of canagliflozin on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) differed according to whether participants were using diuretics at study commencement. We sought to further evaluate this finding related to baseline differences, treatment effects, safety, and risk factor changes.METHODS AND RESULTS: The CANVAS Program enrolled 10142 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk. Participants were randomized to canagliflozin or placebo and followed for a mean of 188weeks. The primary outcome was major cardiovascular events, a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included multiple cardiovascular, renal, and safety events. In this post hoc subgroup analysis, participants were categorized according to baseline use of any diuretic. The effect on outcomes was compared using Cox proportional hazards models, while risk factor changes were compared using mixed-effect models. At baseline, 4490 (44.3%) participants were using a diuretic. Compared with those not using a diuretic, participants using a diuretic were more likely to be older (mean age±standard deviation, 64.3±8.0 vs. 62.5±8.3), be female (38.9% vs. 33.4%), and have heart failure (19.6% vs. 10.3%) (all Pdifference <0.0001). The effect of canagliflozin on major cardiovascular events was greater for those using diuretic at baseline than for those who were not [adjusted hazard ratio 0.65 (95% confidence interval 0.54-0.78) vs. adjusted hazard ratio 1.13 (95% confidence interval 0.93-1.36), Pheterogeneity <0.0001]. Changes in most risk factors, including blood pressure, body weight, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, were similar between groups (all Pdifference >0.11), although the effect of canagliflozin on haemoglobin A1c reduction was slightly weaker in participants using compared with not using diuretics at baseline (-0.52% vs. -0.64%, Pheterogeneity =0.0007). Overall serious adverse events and key safety outcomes, including adverse renal events, were also similar (all Pheterogeneity >0.07).CONCLUSIONS: Participants on baseline diuretics derived a greater benefit for major cardiovascular events from canagliflozin, which was not fully explained by differences in participant characteristics nor risk factor changes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/ehf2.13236\n\nView details for PubMedID 33595905\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients hospitalized for pneumonia are at high risk for mortality. Effective therapies are therefore needed. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest that systemic steroids can reduce the length of hospital stay among patients hospitalized for pneumonia. Further, preliminary findings from a feasibility study demonstrated that early treatment with a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a bronchodilator can improve oxygenation and reduce risk of respiratory failure in patients at risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Whether such a combination administered early is effective in reducing acute respiratory failure among patients hospitalized with pneumonia is unknown. Here we describe the Arrest Respiratory Failure due to Pneumonia (ARREST Pneumonia) trial designed to address this question. ARREST Pneumonia is a two-arm randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a beta agonist compared to placebo for the prevention of acute respiratory failure in hospitalized participants with severe pneumonia. The primary outcome is acute respiratory failure within 7 days of randomization, defined as a composite endpoint of intubation and mechanical ventilation, or need for high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation for > 36 hours (each alone or combined), or death within 36 hours of being placed on respiratory support. The planned enrollment is 600 adult participants at ten academic medical centers. In addition, we will measure selected plasma biomarkers to better understand mechanisms of action. The trial is funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and is registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04193878).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1513/AnnalsATS.202009-1115SD\n\nView details for PubMedID 33493423\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience a high burden of hypertension but the magnitude and consistency of blood pressure (BP) lowering with canagliflozin in this population is uncertain. Whether the effects of canagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes vary by baseline BP or BP lowering therapy is also unknown. Methods: The CREDENCE trial randomized people with T2DM and CKD to canagliflozin or placebo. Post-hoc, we investigated the effect of canagliflozin on systolic BP across subgroups defined by baseline systolic BP, number of BP lowering drug classes, and history of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (BP ≥130/80 mmHg while receiving ≥3 classes of BP lowering drugs, including a diuretic). We also assessed whether effects on clinical outcomes differed across these subgroups. Results: The trial included 4,401 participants of whom 3,361 (76.4%) had baseline systolic BP ≥130 mmHg, and 1371 (31.2%) had resistant hypertension. By week 3, canagliflozin reduced systolic BP by 3.50mmHg (95% CI, -4.27 to -2.72), an effect maintained over the duration of the trial, with similar reductions across BP and BP lowering therapy subgroups (all P-interaction ≥0.05). Canagliflozin also reduced the need for initiation of additional BP lowering agents during the trial (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.61-0.75). The effect of canagliflozin on kidney failure, doubling of serum creatinine, or death due to kidney or cardiovascular disease (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.82) was consistent across BP and BP lowering therapy subgroups (all P-interaction ≥0.35), as were effects on other key kidney, cardiovascular and safety outcomes. Conclusions: In people with T2DM and CKD, canagliflozin lowers systolic BP across all BP defined subgroups and reduces the need for additional BP lowering agents. These findings support use of canagliflozin for end-organ protection and as an adjunct BP lowering therapy in people with CKD. Clinical Trial Registration: URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov.

However, the effect and burden of COPD on patients with PAD is less well defined. This post hoc analysis from EUCLID aimed to analyze the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE) in patients with PAD and concomitant COPD compared with those without COPD, and to describe the adverse events specific to patients with COPD.Methods: EUCLID randomized 13,885 patients with symptomatic PAD to monotherapy with either ticagrelor or clopidogrel for the prevention of MACE. In this analysis, MACE, MALE, mortality, and adverse events were compared between groups with and without COPD using unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards model.Results: Of the 13,883 patients with COPD status available at baseline, 11% (n=1538) had COPD. Patients with COPD had a higher risk of MACE (6.02 vs 4.29 events/100 patient-years; p<0.001) due to a significantly higher risk of myocardial infarction (MI) (3.55 vs 1.85 events/100 patient-years; p<0.001) when compared with patients without COPD. These risks persisted after adjustment (MACE: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.52; p<0.001; MI: aHR 1.45, 95% CI 1.18-1.77; p<0.001). However, patients with COPD did not have an increased risk of MALE or major bleeding. Patients with COPD were more frequently hospitalized for dyspnea and pneumonia (2.66 vs 0.9 events/100 patient-years; aHR 2.77, 95% CI 2.12-3.63; p<0.001) and more frequently discontinued study drug prematurely (19.36 vs 12.54 events/100 patient-years; p<0.001; aHR 1.34, 95% CI 1.22-1.47; p<0.001).Conclusion: In patients with comorbid PAD and COPD, the risks of MACE, respiratory-related adverse events, and premature study drug discontinuation were higher when compared with patients without COPD.Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01732822.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2147/COPD.S292978\n\nView details for PubMedID 33824584\n\nAbstract\n\nROCKET AF demonstrated the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We examined baseline characteristics and outcomes in patients enrolled in Latin America compared with the rest of the world (ROW).ROCKET AF enrolled 14,264 patients from 45 countries. Of these, 1878 (13.2%) were from 7 Latin American countries. The clinical characteristics and outcomes (adjusted by baseline characteristics) of these patients were compared with 12,293 patients from the ROW. Treatment outcomes of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin were also stratified by region.The annual rate of stroke/SE was similar in those from Latin American and ROW (p=0.63), but all-cause and vascular death were significantly higher than in ROW (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.20-1.64; HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.14-1.68; p<0.001). Rates of major or non-major clinically relevant bleeding tended to be lower in Latin America (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-1.0; p=0.05). Rates of stroke/SE were similar with rivaroxaban and warfarin in patients from Latin America and ROW (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.54-1.29 vs. HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.07; interaction p=0.77).Patients with AF in Latin America had similar rates of stroke/SE, higher rates of vascular death, and lower rates of bleeding compared with patients in the ROW. The effect of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin in Latin America was similar to the ROW. Further studies analyzing patient- and country-specific determinants of these regional differences in Latin America are warranted.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ahj.2021.02.004\n\nView details for PubMedID 33571477\n\nAbstract\n\nImproving adherence to direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) is challenging, and simple text messaging reminders have not been effective.SmartADHERE was a randomized trial that tested a personalized digital and human direct oral anticoagulant adherence intervention compared to usual care. Eligibility required age ≥ 18, newly-prescribed (≤ 90 days) rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation (AF), 1 of 4 at-risk criteria for nonadherence, and a smartphone. The intervention consisted of combination of a medication management smartphone app, daily app-based reminders, adaptive text messaging, and phone-based counseling for severe nonadherence. The primary outcome was the proportion of days covered by rivaroxaban (PDC) at 6 months. There were 25 U.S. sites, all cardiology and electrophysiology outpatient practices, activated for a target sample size of 378, but the study was terminated by the sponsor prior to reaching target enrollment.There were 139 participants (age 65±9.6 years, 30% female, median CHA2DS2-VASc score 3 with IQR 2-4, mean total medication burden 7.7±4.4). DOAC adherence was high in both arms with no difference in the primary outcome (PDC 0.86±0.25 intervention vs 0.88±0.25 control, p=0.62) or in secondary outcomes including PDC ≥ 0.80 and medication persistence. Per protocol analyses had similar results. Because of the high overall PDC, the likelihood to answer the primary hypothesis was only 51% even if target enrollment were achieved. There were no study-related adverse events.The use of a centralized digital and human adherence intervention was feasible across multiple sites. Overall adherence was much higher than expected despite pre-screening for at-risk individuals. SmartADHERE illustrates the challenges of trials of behavioral and technology interventions, where enrollment itself may lead to selection bias or treatment effects. Pragmatic study designs, such as cluster randomization or stepped-wedge implementation, should be considered to improve enrollment and generalizability.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ahj.2021.02.023\n\nView details for PubMedID 33676886\n\nAbstract\n\nNewer data platforms offer increased opportunity to share multidimensional health data with research participants, but the preferences of participants for which data to receive and how is evolving. Our objective is to describe the preferences and expectations of participants for the return of individual research results within Project Baseline Health Study (PBHS). The PBHS is an ongoing, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study with data from four initial enrollment sites. PBHS participants are recruited from the general population along with groups enriched for heart disease and cancer disease risk. Cross-sectional data on return of results were collected in 2017-2018 from an (1) in-person enrollment survey (n = 1,890), (2) benchmark online survey (n = 1,059), and (3) participant interviews (n = 21). The main outcomes included (1) preferences for type of information to be added next to returned results, (2) participant plans for sharing returned results with a non-study clinician, and (3) choice to opt-out of receiving genetic results. Results were compared by sociodemographic characteristics. Enrollment and benchmark survey respondents were 57.1% and 53.5% female, and 60.0% and 66.2% white, respectively. Participants preferred the following data types be added to returned results in the future: genetics (29.9%), heart imaging, (16.4%), study watch (15.8%), and microbiome (13.3%). Older adults (OR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.41-0.87) were less likely to want their genetic results returned next. Forty percent of participants reported that they would not share all returned results with their non-study clinicians. Black (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43-0.95) and Asian (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.73) participants were less likely, and older participants more likely (OR 1.45-1.61), to plan to share all results with their clinician than their counterparts. At enrollment, 5.8% of participants opted out of receiving their genetics results. The study showed that substantial heterogeneity existed in participant's preferences and expectations for return of results, and variations were related to sociodemographic characteristics.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0254153\n\nView details for PubMedID 34324495\n\nAbstract\n\nCanagliflozin slows the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and induces a reversible acute drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), believed to be a hemodynamic effect. Predictors of the initial drop and its association with long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes are unknown. To assess this, we performed a post-hoc analysis of 4289 participants in the CREDENCE trial with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease equally split into treatment and placebo groups who had eGFR measured at both baseline and week three. The eGFR was categorized at week three as greater than a 10% decline; between 0 and 10% decline; and no decline. Long-term eGFR trajectories and safety outcomes were estimated in each category of acute eGFR change by linear mixed effects models and Cox regression after adjustment for baseline characteristics and medications use. Significantly more participants in the canagliflozin (45%) compared to the placebo (21%) group experienced an acute drop in eGFR over 10%. An over 30% drop occurred infrequently (4% of participants with canagliflozin and 2% with placebo). The odds ratio for a drop in eGFR over 10% with canagliflozin compared to placebo was significant at 3.03 (95% confidence interval 2.65, 3.47). Following the initial drop in eGFR, multivariable adjusted long-term eGFR trajectories, as well as overall and kidney safety profiles, in those treated with canagliflozin were similar across eGFR decline categories. Thus, although acute drops in eGFR over 10% occurred in nearly half of all participants following initiation of canagliflozin, the clinical benefit of canagliflozin was observed regardless. Additionally, safety outcomes were similar among subgroups of acute eGFR drop.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.kint.2020.10.042\n\nView details for PubMedID 33316282\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease is common and associated with high mortality. There are limited data detailing causes of death among patients with peripheral artery disease.METHODS: EUCLID (Examining Use of Ticagrelor in Peripheral Artery Disease) was a randomized clinical trial that assigned patients with peripheral artery disease to clopidogrel or ticagrelor. We describe the causes of death in EUCLID using mortality end points adjudicated through a clinical events classification process. The association between baseline factors and cardiovascular death was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards modeling. The competing risk of noncardiovascular death was assessed by the cumulative incidence function for cardiovascular death and the Fine and Gray method to ascertain the association between baseline characteristics and cardiovascular mortality.RESULTS: A total of 1263 out of 13 885 (9.1%) patients died (median follow-up: 30 months). There were 706 patients (55.9%) with a cardiovascular cause of death and 522 (41.3%) with a noncardiovascular cause of death. The most common cause of cardiovascular death was sudden cardiac death (20.1%); while myocardial infarction (5.2%) and ischemic stroke (3.2%) were uncommon. The most common causes of noncardiovascular death were malignancies (17.9%) and infections (11.9%). The factor most associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular death was age per 5 year increase (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.20-1.32]). Female sex was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.56-0.82]). To evaluate the effect of noncardiovascular death as a competing risk, we superimposed the cumulative incidence function curve with the Kaplan-Meier curve. These curves closely approximated each other. After accounting for the competing risk of noncardiovascular death, the magnitude and direction of the factors associated with cardiovascular death were minimally changed.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, noncardiovascular causes of death reflected a high proportion (40%) of deaths. Accounting for noncardiovascular deaths as a competing risk, there was not a significant change in the risk estimation for cardiovascular death.REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT01732822.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.120.006550\n\nView details for PubMedID 33176462\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between concentrations of plasma insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) with renal and cardiac outcomes among participants with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Associations between IGFBP7 levels and clinical outcomes were assessed among participants in the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.RESULTS: Among CANVAS participants, 3,577 and 2,898 had IGFBP7 measured at baseline and 1 year, respectively. Per log-unit higher concentration, baseline IGFBP7 was significantly associated with the composite renal end point of sustained 40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, need for renal replacement therapy, or renal death (hazard ratio [HR] 3.51; P < 0.001), and the composite renal end point plus cardiovascular death (HR 4.90; P < 0.001). Other outcomes, including development or progression of albuminuria, were also predicted by baseline IGFBP7. Most outcomes were improved by canagliflozin regardless of baseline IGFBP7; however, those with baseline concentrations ≥96.5 ng/mL appeared to benefit more from canagliflozin relative to the first progression of albuminuria compared with those with lower baseline IGFBP7 (HR 0.64 vs. 0.95; P interaction = 0.003). Canagliflozin did not lower IGFBP7 concentrations by 1 year; however, at 1 year, higher IGFBP7 concentrations more strongly predicted the composite renal end point (HR 15.7; P < 0.001). Patients with rising IGFBP7 between baseline and 1 year had the highest number of composite renal events.CONCLUSIONS: Plasma IGFBP7 concentrations predicted renal and cardiac events among participants with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. More data are needed regarding circulating IGFBP7 and progression of diabetic kidney disease and its complications.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2337/dc20-1889\n\nView details for PubMedID 33158949\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors might enhance erythropoiesis and increase red blood cell mass. We assessed the long-term effects of canagliflozin on anaemia-related outcomes.METHODS: In a post-hoc analysis of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial, we included patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease who were randomly assigned to treatment with canagliflozin or placebo at 690 sites in 34 countries. We assessed the effects of canagliflozin versus matched placebo on haemoglobin and haematocrit using linear mixed-effects models. The primary outcome of this post-hoc analysis was a composite outcome of investigator-reported anaemia or treatment for anaemia, which was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models. All analyses were done by intention to treat.FINDINGS: Between March 24, 2014, and May 5, 2017, 4401 participants were randomly assigned to receive canagliflozin (100 mg; n=2202) or placebo (n=2199). At baseline, mean haemoglobin concentration was 132·0 g/L (SD 17·7), 1599 (36%) of 4401 participants had anaemia (defined as haemoglobin <130 g/L in men or <120 g/L in women), and 33 (<1%) of 4401 participants used erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. During a median follow-up period of 2·6 years (IQR 2·1-3·1), mean haemoglobin concentration was 7·1 g/L (95% CI 6·4-7·8) higher and haematocrit was 2·4% (2·2-2·6) higher in the canagliflozin group than the placebo group. Overall, 573 of 4401 participants had either an investigator-reported anaemia event or initiation of treatment for anaemia: 358 (8%) of 4401 participants reported anaemia events, 343 (8%) initiated iron preparations, 141 (3%) initiated erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and 114 (2%) received blood transfusion. The risk of the composite outcome of anaemia events or initiation of treatment for anaemia was lower in the canagliflozin group than the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·65, 95% CI 0·55-0·77; p<0·0001). Compared with the placebo group, participants in the canagliflozin group also had lower risks of anaemia events alone (0·58, 0·47-0·72; p<0·0001), initiation of iron preparations (0·64, 0·52-0·80; p<0·0001), and need for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (0·65, 0·46-0·91; p=0·012).INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that canagliflozin reduces the risk of anaemia-associated outcomes, including the need for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, among patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.FUNDING: Janssen Research and Development.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S2213-8587(20)30300-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 33065060\n\nAbstract\n\nKidney failure is an important outcome for patients, clinicians, researchers, healthcare systems, payers, and regulators. However, no harmonized international consensus definitions of kidney failure and key surrogates of progression to kidney failure exist specifically for clinical trials. The International Society of Nephrology convened an international multi-stakeholder meeting to develop consensus on this topic. A core group, experienced in design, conduct, and outcome adjudication of clinical trials, developed a database of 64 randomized trials and the 163 included definitions relevant to kidney failure. Using an iterative process, a set of proposed consensus definitions were developed and subsequently vetted by the larger multi-stakeholder group of 83 participants representing 18 different countries. The consensus of the meeting participants was that clinical trial kidney failure outcomes should be comprised of a composite that includes receipt of a kidney transplant, initiation of maintenance dialysis, and death from kidney failure; it may also include outcomes based solely on laboratory measurements of glomerular filtration rate: a sustained low glomerular filtration rate and a sustained percent decline in glomerular filtration rate. Discussion included important considerations, such as (i) recognition of existing nomenclature for kidney failure; (ii) applicability across resource settings; (iii) ease of understanding for all stakeholders; and (iv) avoidance of inappropriate complexity so that the definitions can be used across ranges of populations and trial methodologies. The final definitions reflect the consensus for use in clinical trials.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.kint.2020.07.013\n\nView details for PubMedID 32998816\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The association between early changes in albuminuria and kidney and cardiovascular events is primarily based on trials of renin-angiotensin system blockade. It is unclear whether this association occurs with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition.METHODS: The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial enrolled 4401 patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio [UACR] >300 mg/g). This post hoc analysis assessed canagliflozin's effect on albuminuria and how early change in albuminuria (baseline to week 26) is associated with the primary kidney outcome (ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, or kidney death), major adverse cardiovascular events, and hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death.RESULTS: Complete data for early change in albuminuria and other covariates were available for 3836 (87.2%) participants in the CREDENCE trial. Compared with placebo, canagliflozin lowered UACR by 31% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 27% to 36%) at week 26, and significantly increased the likelihood of achieving a 30% reduction in UACR (odds ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 2.35 to 3.07). Each 30% decrease in UACR over the first 26 weeks was independently associated with a lower hazard for the primary kidney outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.76; P<0.001), major adverse cardiovascular events (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96; P<0.001), and hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.90; P<0.001). Residual albuminuria levels at week 26 remained a strong independent risk factor for kidney and cardiovascular events, overall and in each treatment arm.CONCLUSIONS: In people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use of canagliflozin results in early, sustained reductions in albuminuria, which were independently associated with long-term kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1681/ASN.2020050723\n\nView details for PubMedID 32998938\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Large-scale outcome trials of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes have identified consistent effects on major adverse cardiovascular events, heart failure, and progression of kidney disease. However, the magnitude of effects on cardiovascular and all-cause death appeared to vary between some of the studies.METHODS: We explored the impact of differences in trial methodologies, participant characteristics, types of deaths, follow-up duration, effects on intermediate markers of risk, and drug selectivity for SGLT2 on the magnitude of the protective effect against fatal events achieved in the 4 trials.RESULTS: The trial populations differed substantively in the proportions with baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease history (99.2% in EMPA-REG OUTCOME to 40.6% in DECLARE-TIMI 58), and macroalbuminuria (88.0% in CREDENCE to 7.6% in the CANVAS Program). Meta-regression analyses identified no clear effect of these (both P > 0.09) or other participant characteristics on mortality benefits (all P > 0.55). Other differences between the trials (duration, selectivity of the SGLT2 inhibitor, or effects on intermediate markers of risk) also did not explain the heterogeneity in effects on mortality observed (all P > 0.30).CONCLUSION: No clear explanation for the statistical evidence of heterogeneity in effects of SGLT2 inhibition on fatal outcomes between the trials could be identified. While the analyses had limited statistical power, these results raise the possibility that the observed variations in treatment effects on fatal outcomes between trials may be at least partly due to chance.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.09.050\n\nView details for PubMedID 32979427\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground There are limited data on health status instruments in patients with peripheral artery disease and cardiovascular and limb events. We evaluated the relationship between health status changes and cardiovascular and limb events. Methods and Results In an analysis of the EUCLID (Examining Use of Ticagrelor in Symptomatic Peripheral Artery Disease) trial, we examined the characteristics of 13801 patients by tertile of health status instrument scores collected in the trial (EuroQol 5-Dimensions [EQ-5D], EQ visual analog scale [VAS], and peripheral artery questionnaire). We assessed the association between the baseline health status measurements and major adverse cardiovascular events, major adverse limb events, and lower-extremity revascularization procedures during trial follow-up and the association between 12-month health status change scores and subsequent end points during follow-up. There were 13217 (95%) patients with EQ-5D scores, 13533 (98%) with VAS scores, and 4431 (32%) with peripheral artery questionnaire scores. Patients in the lowest baseline EQ-5D tertile (0 to <0.69) were more likely to be female with severe claudication compared with the highest tertile (0.79-1.0; P<0.01). Patients in the lowest VAS (0-60) and peripheral artery questionnaire (0-49) tertiles had lower ankle-brachial indices compared with the highest tertiles (80-100 and 76-108, respectively; P<0.01). There was a significant association between baseline EQ-5D, VAS, and peripheral artery questionnaire scores and adjusted major adverse cardiovascular events, major adverse limb events, and lower-extremity revascularization (P<0.05). Improved EQ-5D and VAS scores over 12months were associated with reduced risk of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events or lower-extremity revascularization (all P<0.01). Conclusions Although health status instruments are rarely used in clinical practice, these measures are associated with outcomes, including major adverse cardiovascular events, major adverse limb events, and lower-extremity revascularization. Further research is needed to determine the relationship between changes in these instruments, revascularization, and outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/JAHA.120.016573\n\nView details for PubMedID 32924754\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Traditionally, clinical trials evaluating effects of a new therapy with creatinine-based renal end points use doubling of serum creatinine (equivalent to a 57% eGFR reduction), requiring large sample sizes.METHODS: To assess whether eGFR declines <57% could detect canagliflozin's effects on renal outcomes, we conducted a post hoc study comparing effects of canagliflozin versus placebo on composite renal outcomes using sustained 57%, 50%, 40%, or 30% eGFR reductions in conjunction with ESKD and renal death. Because canagliflozin causes an acute reversible hemodynamic decline in eGFR, we made estimates using all eGFR values as well as estimates that excluded early measures of eGFR influenced by the acute hemodynamic effect.RESULTS: Among the 10,142 participants, 93 (0.9%), 161 (1.6%), 352 (3.5%), and 800 (7.9%) participants recorded renal outcomes on the basis of 57%, 50%, 40%, or 30% eGFR reduction, respectively, during a mean follow-up of 188 weeks. Compared with a 57% eGFR reduction (risk ratio [RR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.34 to 0.77), the effect sizes were progressively attenuated when using 50% (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.83), 40% (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.86), or 30% (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.93) eGFR reductions. In analyses that controlled for the acute hemodynamic fall in eGFR, effect sizes were comparable, regardless of whether a 57%, 50%, 40%, or 30% eGFR reduction was used. Estimated sample sizes for studies on the basis of lesser eGFR reductions were much reduced by controlling for this early hemodynamic effect.CONCLUSIONS: Declines in eGFR <57% may provide robust estimates of canagliflozin's effects on renal outcomes if the analysis controls for the drug's acute hemodynamic effect.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER: CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS), NCT01032629 and CANVAS-R, NCT01989754.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1681/ASN.2019121312\n\nView details for PubMedID 32694216\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study compared initiation of insulin and other AHAs with canagliflozin versus placebo for participants with type 2 diabetes and a history/high risk of cardiovascular disease in the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program. After 1 year fewer participants treated with canagliflozin versus placebo initiated any AHA (7% vs 16%), insulin (3% vs 9%;) or any non-insulin AHA (5% vs 12%; p<0.001 for all); overall AHA initiation rates increased over time but were consistently lower with canagliflozin compared with placebo. During the study, the likelihood of initiating insulin was 2.7 times lower for participants treated with canagliflozin compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI: 0.31,0.43; p<0.001). The time difference between 10% of patients in the canagliflozin and placebo groups being initiated on insulin from the beginning of the trial was about two years. Time to initiation of other AHAs, including metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sulphonylureas, was also delayed for canagliflozin versus placebo (p<0.001 for each). Compared with placebo, canagliflozin delayed the need for initiation of other AHAs and delayed time to insulin therapy, an outcome that is important to many people with diabetes.

AF patients on warfarin who had a temporary interruption followed by resumption were identified. A nonparametric method for estimating survival functions for interval censored data was used to examine the first therapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) after interruption. TTR was compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate the association between TTR in the first 3 months after interruption and subsequent outcomes at 3 to 9 months. Of 9,749 AF patients, 71% were on warfarin. Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 2.6 (1.8 to 3.1) y, 33% of patients had a total of 3,022 temporary interruptions. The first therapeutic INR was recorded within 1 week in 35.0% (95% confidence interval 32.6% to 37.4%), 2 weeks in 54.6% (52.2% to 57.0%), 30 days in 70.0% (67.9% to 72.1%) and 90 days in 91.3% (90.0% to 92.5%) of patients. Compared with pre-interruption, TTR 3 months after interruption was significantly lower (61.1% [36.6% to 85.0%] vs 67.6% [50.0% to 81.3%], p <0.0001). A 10 unit increment in the TTR in the first 3 months after interruption was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding [Hazard ratio 0.91 (0.85 to 0.97), p = 0.005]. This association was noted in patients who received bridging anticoagulation, but not in those who did not. In conclusion, temporary interruption of warfarin is common, and nearly half of these patients had subtherapeutic INR after 2 weeks. Lower TTR in the first 3 months after interruption was associated with higher incidence of major bleeding in patients who received bridging anticoagulation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.amjcard.2020.07.006\n\nView details for PubMedID 32826041\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Cardioversion is common among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesised that novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) used in clinical practice resulted in similar rates of stroke compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for cardioversion.METHODS: Using the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation II, patients with AF who had a cardioversion, follow-up data and an AF diagnosis within 6 months of enrolment were identified retrospectively. Clinical outcomes were compared for patients receiving a NOAC or VKA for 1year following cardioversion.RESULTS: Among 13004 patients with AF, 2260 (17%) underwent cardioversion. 1613 met the inclusion criteria for this analysis. At the time of cardioversion, 283 (17.5%) were receiving a VKA and 1330 (82.5%) a NOAC. A transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) was performed in 403 (25%) cardioversions. The incidence of stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) at 30 days was the same for patients having (3.04 per 100 patient-years) or not having (3.04 per 100 patient-years) a TOE (p=0.99). There were no differences in the incidence of death (HR 1.19, 95%CI 0.62 to 2.28, p=0.61), cardiovascular hospitalisation (HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.76 to 1.35, p=0.91), stroke/TIA (HR 1.18, 95%CI 0.30 to 4.74, p=0.81) or bleeding-related hospitalisation (HR 1.29, 95%CI 0.66 to 2.52, p=0.45) at 1year for patients treated with either a NOAC or VKA.CONCLUSIONS: Cardioversion was a low-risk procedure for patients treated with NOAC, and there were statistically similar rates of stroke/TIA 30 days after cardioversion as for patients treated with VKA. There were no statically significant differences in death, stroke/TIA or major bleeding at 1year among patients treated with NOAC compared with VKA after cardioversion.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/heartjnl-2019-316315\n\nView details for PubMedID 32591363\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA) reduce cardiovascular events, and improve intermediate markers of cardiometabolic health, in those with type 2 diabetes. We investigated these effects in the CANVAS Program.METHODS AND RESULTS: The CANVAS Program comprised 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (CANVAS and CANVAS-R) done in patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk. Effects were estimated using mixed-effects models for continuous measures and Cox regression models for other outcomes. Randomized treatment by subgroup interaction terms were used to compare effects of canagliflozin versus placebo across subgroups defined by baseline use of GLP1-RA. There were 10,142 participants, of whom 407 (4%) were using GLP1-RA therapy at baseline. Those using GLP1-RA at baseline were less likely to have a history of cardiovascular disease (60.4% vs 65.8%), had a longer duration of diabetes (15.2 vs 13.5 years) and a higher body mass index (BMI; 35.6 vs 31.8 kg/m2) but were otherwise similar. There were greater reductions with canagliflozin versus placebo for HbA1c (-0.75% versus -0.58%; P = .0091), SBP (-6.26 versus -3.83 mmHg; P = .0018), and body weight (-3.79 versus -2.18 kg; P < .0001) in those on baseline GLP1-RA therapy. Effects across subgroups were similar for UACR (P = .21), eGFR slope (P = .72), major adverse cardiac events (P = .94) and total serious adverse events (P = .74).CONCLUSIONS: There may be a synergistic effect of SGLT2 inhibition when used on a background of GLP1-RA for intermediate cardiometabolic markers.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.06.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 32569700\n\nAbstract\n\nAIMS: The SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin was associated with increased amputation risk in the CANVAS Program but not in CREDENCE. We explored possible explanations for these differences in amputation risk.METHODS: We performed a pooled analysis of patient-level data from the CANVAS Program and CREDENCE trial. Patient characteristics associated with amputation risk were assessed in univariable and multivariable regression models and compared between studies. Effects of canagliflozin on amputation risk were determined from Cox proportional hazards models and compared between studies, subgroups, and for a range of amputation outcomes. Effects over time were explored by cumulative event curves.RESULTS: In the CANVAS Program (n=10,142; median follow-up 2·4y) and CREDENCE trial (n=4401; median follow-up 2·5y), 2·3% and 5·3% of participants, respectively, reported baseline amputation history. Key differences at baseline were the proportions with nephropathy (CREDENCE higher, 100% vs 17·5%) and cardiovascular disease (CANVAS Program higher, 66% vs 50%). There were 133 amputations in CREDENCE (3·0% annual event rate) and 187 amputations in CANVAS (1·8% annual event rate), with prior amputation being the strongest predictor of future amputation in both groups. Effects of canagliflozin on amputation risk were significantly different between trials (pheterogeneity 0·02, I2 =82%), but this was not explained by participant or trial differences. There was no evidence that foot disease management protocols instituted during CREDENCE ameliorated amputation risk.CONCLUSIONS: We identified no explanation for the difference in amputation risk between CREDENCE and the CANVAS Program. In the context of null effects of SGLT2 inhibition on amputation in CREDENCE and all other large trials, there is a possibility that the finding in CANVAS was the result of chance.

Patients completed surveys at enrollment and at 6-month follow-up. Patients were asked about who made their AF treatment decisions. SDM was classified as one that the patient felt was an autonomous decision or a shared decision with their healthcare provider (HCP). Approximately half of patients reported that their OAC treatment decisions were made entirely by their HCP. Compared with those reporting no SDM, patients reporting SDM for OAC were more often female (47.2% vs 38.4%), while patients reporting SDM for rhythm control were more often male (62.2% vs 57.6%). The most important factors cited by patients during decision-making for OAC were reducing stroke and bleeding risk, and their HCP's recommendations. After adjustment, patients with self-reported understanding of OAC, and rhythm control options, had higher odds of having participated in SDM (OR 2.54, CI: 1.75-3.68 and OR 2.36, CI: 1.50-3.71, both p=<0.001, respectively).CONCLUSION: SDM is not widely implemented in contemporary AF practice. Patient understanding about available therapeutic options is associated with a more than a 2-fold higher likelihood of SDM, and may be a potential target for future interventions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/ehjqcco/qcaa040\n\nView details for PubMedID 32392287\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Canagliflozin reduced renal and cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes in the CREDENCE trial. We assessed efficacy and safety of canagliflozin by initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).METHODS: CREDENCE randomly assigned 4401 participants with an eGFR of 30 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and substantial albuminuria to canagliflozin 100 mg or placebo. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze effects on renal and cardiovascular efficacy and safety outcomes within screening eGFR subgroups (30 to <45, 45 to <60, and 60 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and linear mixed effects models to analyze the effects on eGFR slope.RESULTS: At screening, 1313 (30%), 1279 (29%), and 1809 (41%) participants had an eGFR of 30 to <45, 45 to <60, and 60 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively. The relative benefits of canagliflozin for renal and cardiovascular outcomes appeared consistent among eGFR subgroups (all P interaction >0.11). Subgroups with lower eGFRs, who were at greater risk, exhibited larger absolute benefits for renal outcomes. Canagliflozin's lack of effect on serious adverse events, amputations, and fractures appeared consistent among eGFR subgroups. In all subgroups, canagliflozin use led to an acute eGFR drop followed by relative stabilization of eGFR loss. Among those with an eGFR of 30 to <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2, canagliflozin led to an initial drop of 2.03 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Thereafter, decline in eGFR was slower in the canagliflozin versus placebo group (-1.72 versus -4.33 ml/min per 1.73 m2; between-group difference 2.61 ml/min per 1.73 m2).CONCLUSIONS: Canagliflozin safely reduced the risk of renal and cardiovascular events, with consistent results across eGFR subgroups, including the subgroup initiating treatment with an eGFR of 30 to <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Absolute benefits for renal outcomes were greatest in subgroups with lower eGFR.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER: Evaluation of the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants With Diabetic Nephropathy (CREDENCE), NCT02065791.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1681/ASN.2019111168\n\nView details for PubMedID 32354987\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation on oral anticoagulation (OAC) undergoing cardiac catheterization face risks for embolic and bleeding events, yet information on strategies to mitigate these risks in contemporary practice is lacking.METHODS: We aimed to describe the clinical/procedural characteristics of a contemporary cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation on OAC who underwent cardiac catheterization. Use of bleeding avoidance strategies and bridging therapy were described and outcomes including death, stroke, and major bleeding at 30 days and 1 year were compared by OAC type.RESULTS: Of 13404 patients in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation II Registry from 2013 to 2016, 741 underwent cardiac catheterization (139 with percutaneous coronary intervention) in the setting of OAC. The patients' median age was 71, 61.8% were male, white (87.2%), had hypertension (83.7%), hyperlipidemia (72.1%), diabetes mellitus (31.6%), and chronic kidney disease (28.2%); 20.2% received warfarin while 79.8% received direct acting oral anticoagulant. One third of patients underwent radial artery access, and bivalirudin was used in 4.6%. Bridging therapy was used more often in patients on warfarin versus direct acting oral anticoagulant (16.7% versus10.0%). OAC was interrupted in 93.8% of patients. Patients on warfarin versus direct acting oral anticoagulant were equally likely to restart OAC (58.0% versus 60.7%), had similar use of antiplatelet therapy (44.0% versus 41.3%) after catheterization, and had similar rates of myocardial infarction and death at 1 year, but higher rates of major bleeding (43.3 versus 12.9 events/100 patient years) and stroke (4.9 versus 1.9 events/100 patient years).CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world registry of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac catheterization, most cases are elective, performed by femoral access, with interruption of OAC. Bleeding avoidance strategies such as radial artery access and bivalirudin were used infrequently and use of bridging therapy was uncommon. Nearly 40% of patients did not restart OAC postprocedure, exposing patients to risk for stroke. Further research is necessary to optimize the management of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac catheterization.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS.119.008274\n\nView details for PubMedID 32408815\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The primary goal of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of therapeutic interventions, and efficient and reproducible ascertainment of important clinical events, either as clinical outcome events (COEs) or adverse events (AEs), is critical. Clinical outcomes require consistency and clinical judgment, so these events are often adjudicated centrally by clinical events classification (CEC) physician reviewers using standardized definitions. In contrast, AEs are reported by sites to the trial coordinating center based on common reporting criteria set by regulatory authorities and trial sponsors. These different requirements have led to the development of separate tracks for COE and AE review.MAIN BODY: Potential COEs that fail to meet standardized definitions for CEC adjudication - i.e. negatively adjudicated events (NAE) - may meet criteria for AEs. Trial oversight practices require the sponsor to process AEs regardless of how the AEs are submitted; therefore, review of NAEs may be necessary to ensure that important AEs do not go unreported. The Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) developed and implemented a process for scrutinizing NAEs to detect potential missed serious AEs. Initial experience with this process across two trials suggests that approximately 0.2% of NAEs are serious unexpected AEs that were not otherwise reported and another 1.5% are serious expected AEs.CONCLUSIONS: Given their infrequent concealment of serious AEs in two large trials assessing cardiovascular outcomes, routine scrutiny of NAEs to identify AEs is not recommended at this time, though it may be useful in some trials and should be carefully considered by the trial team. Closer integration of data across safety surveillance and endpoint adjudication systems may enable scrutiny of NAEs when indicated while limiting complexity associated with this process.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13063-020-04254-w\n\nView details for PubMedID 32272961\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a known risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, it remains unclear whether OSA is independently associated with worse cardiovascular and neurological outcomes in patients with AF.METHODS: We used the ORBIT-AF I and ORBIT-AF II to conduct a retrospective cohort study of 22,760 patients with AF with and without OSA. Adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazards models was used to determine whether OSA was associated with increased risk for major adverse cardiac and neurologic events (MACNEs) (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke/transient ischemic attack/non-central nervous system embolism (stroke/SE), and new-onset heart failure], combined and individually.RESULTS: A total of 4,045 (17.8%) patients had OSA at baseline. Median follow-up time was 1.5 (interquartile range: 1-2.2) years, and 1,895 patients experienced a MACNE. OSA patients were younger (median [interquartile range] 68 [61-75] years vs 74 [66-81] years), were more likely male (70.7% vs 55.3%), and had increased body mass index (median 34.6 kg/m2 [29.8-40.2] vs 28.7 kg/m2 [25.2-33.0]). Those with OSA had a higher prevalence of concomitant comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. OSA patients had higher use of antithrombotic therapy. After adjustment, the presence of OSA was significantly associated with MACNE (hazard ratio: 1.16 [95% CI: 1.03-1.31], P = .011). OSA was also an independent risk factor for stroke/SE beyond the CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors (HR: 1.38 [95% CI 1.12-1.70], P = .003) but not cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, new-onset heart failure, or major bleeding.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AF, OSA is an independent risk factor for MACNE and, more specifically, stroke/SE.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ahj.2020.01.001\n\nView details for PubMedID 32179257\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) require dose adjustment for renal function. We sought to investigate change in renal function over time in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and whether those on NOACs have appropriate dose adjustments according to its decline.METHODS: We included patients with AF enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation II registry treated with oral anticoagulation. Worsening renal function (WRF) was defined as a decrease of >20% in creatinine clearance (CrCl) from baseline. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved package inserts were used to define the reduction criteria of NOACs dosing.RESULTS: Among 6682 patients with AF from 220 sites (median age (25th, 75th): 72.0 years (65.0, 79.0); 57.1% male; median CrCl at baseline: 80.1mL/min (57.4, 108.5)), 1543 patients (23.1%) experienced WRF with mean decline in CrCl during 2year follow-up of -6.63mL/min for NOACs and -6.16mL/min for warfarin. Among 4120 patients on NOACs, 154 (3.7%) patients had a CrCl decline sufficient to warrant FDA-recommended dose reductions. Of these, NOACs dosing was appropriately reduced in only 31 (20.1%) patients. Compared with patients with appropriately reduced NOACs, those without were more likely to experience bleeding complications (major bleeding: 1.7% vs 0%; bleeding hospitalisation: 2.6% vs 0%) at 1year.CONCLUSIONS: In the US practice, about one-fourth of patients with AF had >20% decline in CrCl over time during 2year follow-up. As a result, about 3.7% of those treated with NOACs met guideline criteria for dose reduction, but of these, only 20.1% actually had a reduction.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/heartjnl-2019-315792\n\nView details for PubMedID 31911503\n\nAbstract\n\nCanagliflozin reduced kidney disease progression in participants with type 2 diabetes in the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program that explored potential mediators of the effects of canagliflozin on kidney outcomes. The percent mediating effect of 18 biomarkers indicative of disease was determined by comparing the hazard ratios for the effect of randomized treatment from an unadjusted model and from a model adjusting for the average post-randomization level of each biomarker. Multivariable analyses assessed the joint effects of biomarkers that mediated most strongly in univariable analyses. The kidney outcome was defined as a composite of 40% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, end-stage kidney disease, or death due to kidney disease. Nine biomarkers (systolic blood pressure [8.9% of effect explained], urinary albumin:creatinine ratio [UACR; 23.9%], gamma glutamyltransferase [4.1%], hematocrit [51.1%], hemoglobin [41.3%], serum albumin [19.5%], erythrocytes [56.7%], serum urate [35.4%], and urine pH [7.5%]) individually mediated the effect of canagliflozin on the kidney outcome. In a parsimonious multivariable model, erythrocyte concentration, serum urate, and systolic blood pressure maximized cumulative mediation (115%). Mediating effects of UACR, but not other mediators, were highly dependent upon the baseline level of UACR: UACR mediated 42% and 7% of the effect in those with baseline UACR 30 mg/g or more and under 30 mg/g, respectively. The identified mediators support existing hypothesized mechanisms for the prevention of kidney outcomes with sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. Thus, the disparity in mediating effects across baseline UACR subgroups suggests that the mechanism for kidney protection with canagliflozin may vary across patient subgroups.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.kint.2020.04.051\n\nView details for PubMedID 32470492\n\nAbstract\n\nAlmost all clinical practice guidelines recommend that SGLT2 inhibitors are used as second-line pharmacotherapy in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease or heart failure if they do not achieve sufficient glucose control with metformin. We sought to assess whether the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular, kidney and mortality outcomes are consistent with and without concomitant metformin use.We conducted a meta-analysis of event-driven, randomized, placebo-controlled SGLT2 inhibitor trials that reported cardiovascular, kidney or mortality outcomes by baseline metformin use. Treatment effects reported as hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. The main outcomes in this analysis were (1) major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and (2) hospitalized heart failure (HHF) or cardiovascular death.We included six trials of four SGLT2 inhibitors that enrolled 51,743 participants. Baseline metformin use varied from 21% in DAPA-HF to 82% in DECLARE-TIMI 58. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of MACE, with and without concomitant metformin use (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-1.00 and HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.86 respectively; P-heterogeneity=0.14). There were also clear and separate reductions in HHF or cardiovascular death with SGLT2 inhibitors irrespective of metformin use (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.73-0.86 and HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.87 respectively; P-heterogeneity=0.48), as well as for major kidney outcomes and all-cause mortality (all P-heterogeneity>0.40).Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors results in clear and consistent reductions in cardiovascular, kidney and mortality outcomes regardless of whether patients are receiving or not receiving metformin.

While some patients demonstrate improvements in hrQoL, the factors associated with large improvements in hrQoL are not well described. Methods - We assessed factors associated with a 1-year increase in AFEQT of 1 standard deviation (≥18 points; 3x clinically important difference), among outpatients in the ORBIT-AF I registry. Results - Overall, 28% (181/636) of patients had such a hrQoL improvement. Compared with patients not showing large hrQoL improvement, they were of similar age (median 73 vs. 74, p=0.3), equally likely to be female (44% vs. 48%, p=0.3), but more likely to have newly-diagnosed AF at baseline (18% vs. 8%; p=0.0004), prior antiarrhythmic drug use (52% vs. 40%, 0.005), baseline antiarrhythmic drug use (34.8% vs, 26.8%, p=0.045), and more likely to undergo AF-related procedures during follow-up (AF ablation: 6.6% vs. 2.0%, p=0.003; cardioversion:12.2% vs. 5.9% p=0.008). In multivariable analysis, a history of alcohol abuse (adjusted OR 2.41, p=0.01) and increased baseline diastolic BP (adjusted OR 1.23 per 10-point increase and >65 mm Hg, p=0.04) were associated with large improvements in hrQoL at 1 year, whereas patients with prior stroke/TIA, COPD, and PAD were less likely to improve (p<0.05 for each). Conclusions - In this national registry of AF patients, potentially treatable AF risk factors are associated with large hrQoL improvement, whereas less reversible conditions appeared negatively associated with hrQoL improvement. Understanding which patients are most likely to have large hrQoL improvement may facilitate targeting interventions for high-value care that optimizes patient reported outcomes in AF.

The objective of this study is to evaluate discontinuation rates among patients on warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in clinical practice.The ORBIT-AF II Registry enrolled 10,005 total AF patients with a CHA2DS2VASc score of ≥2 on warfarin or DOACs from 235 clinical practices across the US from February 13, 2013 and July 12, 2017. Descriptive statistics and multivariable Cox regression modeling were used to describe baseline characteristics and predictors of discontinuation. Unadjusted and adjusted discontinuation rates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models and propensity score adjustment, respectively.At baseline, 16.4% (N = 1642/10,005) were treated with warfarin, 83.6% (N = 8363/10,005) with DOACs and 1498/10,005 patients (15.0%) discontinued therapy [warfarin = 236/1642 (14.4%) vs DOACs = 1262/8363 (15.1%)]. At 6 and 12 months respectively, among 7049 patients with a new diagnosis of AF within 6 months, adjusted discontinuation rates for warfarin versus DOACs were as follows: [6 months: 7.9%, 95%CI (6.8%-9.0%) vs 9.6% (8.4%-10.7%), P = .16]; [12 months: 12.7% (11.0%-14.3%) vs 15.3% (13.6%-16.9%), P = .02)]. Patients who discontinued therapy with warfarin or DOACs had higher risk of adverse clinical outcomes including: all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death (CV) than those who continued treatment.In a community based AF cohort, adjusted rates of discontinuation at 12-months were higher in DOAC-treated versus VKA-treated patients. Discontinuation of oral anticoagulation was associated with increased absolute risk of all-cause mortality and CV death.URL:https://clinicaltrials.gov.

Covariates were introduced after adjusted model selection.EUCLID enrolled 13,885 patients with PAD (28% women [n = 3,888]). PAD severity and medical treatment were comparable between sexes, whereas prior lower extremity revascularization was reported less frequently in women (54.8% vs. 57.3%; p = 0.006). Women were older (mean ± SD age: 67.8 ± 8.9 vs. 66.1 ± 8.2 years; p < 0.001) and more likely to have diabetes mellitus (p = 0.004), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (all p < 0.001). Over a mean follow-up of 30 months, women had a lower risk of MACE (9.5% vs. 11.2%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.68 to 0.88; p < 0.001) and all-cause-mortality (7.6% vs. 9.7%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.61; 95% confidence interval: 0.53 to 0.71; p < 0.001). In contrast, risk for major adverse limb events (2.6% vs. 3.0%) and hospitalization for acute limb ischemia (1.6% vs. 1.7%) were not different by sex.Although women with PAD are at lower risk for MACE and all-cause mortality, risk for limb events was similar between sexes over a mean follow-up of 30 months. Understanding sex-specific differences and dissociation between baseline cardiovascular risk and subsequent cardiovascular events requires further investigation.

Elevated amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations are associated with HF diagnosis and predict cardiovascular risk.The purpose of this study was to measure NT-proBNP in CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) participants.Associations between baseline NT-proBNP and cardiovascular, renal, and mortality outcomes and intervention-associated changes were determined.Of the 4,330 participants in the CANVAS trial, NT-proBNP was measured in 3,587, 2,918, and 995 participants at baseline, 1 year, and 6 years, respectively. The median baseline NT-proBNP concentration was 91 pg/ml, and 39.3% had NT-proBNP ≥125 pg/ml. NT-proBNP was higher in those with investigator-reported HF (13% of participants at baseline) versus those without (187 pg/ml vs. 81 pg/ml), with substantial overlap between groups. By 1 year, NT-proBNP increased with placebo, whereas canagliflozin reduced NT-proBNP by 11% (geometric mean ratio for canagliflozin vs. placebo = 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84 to 0.94]; p < 0.001). Lower NT-proBNP with canagliflozin was also observed at 6 years (p = 0.004). In adjusted models, baseline NT-proBNP ≥125 pg/ml was prognostic for incident HHF (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.40; 95% CI: 2.67 to 10.9), HHF/cardiovascular death (HR: 3.52; 95% CI: 2.38 to 5.20), and all-cause death (HR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.78 to 3.61). Mediation analyses suggested that 10.4% of the effects of canagliflozin on HHF were reflected in NT-proBNP lowering.A substantial percentage of patients in the CANVAS trial had elevated NT-proBNP values. Canagliflozin reduced NT-proBNP concentrations versus placebo; however, reduction in NT-proBNP explained only a small proportion of the benefit of canagliflozin on HF events.

Data on major amputation from a large randomized trial that included a substantial cohort of patients without critical limb ischemia (CLI) have not been described. The objective was to describe the incidence and types of amputations in the EUCLID trial (Examining Use of Ticagrelor in Peripheral Artery Disease) population, subcategorize amputations in the CLI versus no CLI cohorts, and describe the events surrounding major amputation. Methods and Results Postrandomization major amputation was analyzed in the EUCLID trial. Patients were stratified by baseline CLI status. The occurrence of major amputation was ascertained and defined as the highest level. Perioperative events surrounding major amputation were obtained including acute limb ischemia, revascularization, and all-cause mortality. All variables were assessed for significance in univariable and multivariable models. The rate of major amputation during the course of the trial was 1.6% overall, 8.4% in the CLI at baseline group, and 1.2% in the no CLI at baseline gro"
