In October 2017, the Scientific Committee on\nSolar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP) Bureau established a committee for the\ndesign of SCOSTEP's Next Scientific Programme (NSP). The NSP committee members\nand authors of this paper decided from the very beginning of their\ndeliberations that the predictability of the SunâEarth System from a few\nhours to centuries is a timely scientific topic, combining the interests of\ndifferent topical communities in a relevant way. Accordingly, the NSP was\nchristened PRESTO â PREdictability of the variable\nSolarâTerrestrial cOupling. This paper presents a\ndetailed account of PRESTO; we show the key milestones of the PRESTO roadmap\nfor the next 5 years, review the current state of the art and discuss\nfuture studies required for the most effective development of\nsolarâterrestrial physics.",

The energetic ones are trapped around Earth in radiation belts. Orbiting spacecraft that cross their region can accumulate charges on their internal surfaces, leading to hazardous electrostatic discharges. This paper showcases the SafeSpace safety prototype, which aims to warn satellite operators of probable incoming hazardous events by simulating the dynamics of the electron radiation belts from their origin at the Sun.\n\nThe âSafeSpaceâ database of ULF power spectral density and radial diffusion coefficients: dependencies and application to simulations\n\nChristos Katsavrias, Afroditi Nasi, Ioannis A.

In the framework of the \"SafeSpace\" project, we have created a database of calculated radial diffusion coefficients, and, furthermore, we have exploited it to provide insights for future modelling efforts.\n\nOn the semi-annual variation of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt\n\nChristos Katsavrias, Constantinos Papadimitriou, Sigiava Aminalragia-Giamini, Ioannis A.

Our work shows that it is primarily driven by the Russell–McPherron effect, which indicates that reconnection is responsible not only for the short-scale but also the seasonal variability of the electron belt as well. Moreover, it is more pronounced during the descending phase of the solar cycles and coexists with periods of fast solar wind speed.\n\nAn initial ULF wave index derived from 2 years of Swarm observations\n\nConstantinos Papadimitriou, Georgios Balasis, Ioannis A.

The mission provides an opportunity for better knowledge of the near-Earth electromagnetic environment. This study presents an initial attempt to derive an ultra low-frequency (ULF) wave index from low-Earth orbit satellite data. The technique can be potentially used to define a new product from the mission, the Swarm ULF wave index, which would be suitable for space weather applications.\n\nModeling of ion dynamics in the inner geospace during enhanced magnetospheric activity\n\nC.

In the past, ULF waves had been observed at unusual depths during rare superstorms. But ULF wave activity, reaching magnetic shells as low as 2, was also observed during relatively intense storms when it played a key role in diffusing electrons radially inward and thereby accelerating them to higher energies.\n\nDefining and resolving current systems in geospace\n\nN.

It is very difficult to identify local measurements as belonging to a specific current system. Therefore, there are different definitions of supposedly the same current, leading to unnecessary controversy. This study presents a robust collection of these definitions of current systems in geospace, particularly in the near-Earth nightside magnetosphere, as viewed from a variety of observational and computational analysis techniques.\n\nMulti-satellite study of the excitation of Pc3 and Pc4-5 ULF waves and their penetration across the plasmapause during the 2003 Halloween superstorm\n\nG.

Marsh, Thomas Reddmann, Eugene Rozanov, Timofei Sukhodolov, Monika E. Szelag, and Jan Maik Wissing\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2256,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2256, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFormation of nitric oxide NO in the upper atmosphere varies with solar activity. Observations show that it starts a chain of processes in the entire atmosphere affecting the ozone layer and climate system. This is often underestimated in models. We compare five models which show large differences in simulated NO. Analysis of results point out problems related to the oxygen balance, and to the impact of atmospheric waves on dynamics. Both must be modeled well to reproduce the downward coupling.\n\nEffects of Nonmigrating Diurnal Tides on the Na Layer in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere\n\nJianfei Wu, Wuhu Feng, Xianghui Xue, Daniel R. Marsh, and John Maurice Campbell Plane\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1792,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1792, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMetal layers occur in the MLT region (80–120 km) from the ablation of cosmic dust. The nonmigrating diurnal tides are the persistent global oscillations. We investigate the nonmigrating diurnal tidal variations in the metal layers using satellite observations and global climate model simulations; this has not been studied previously due to the limitations of measurements. We show that the nonmigrating diurnal tides in temperature are strongly linked to the corresponding change in metal layers.\n\nImpact of host climate model on contrail cirrus effective radiative forcing estimates\n\nWeiyu Zhang, Kwinten Van Weverberg, Cyril J. Morcrette, Wuhu Feng, Kalli Furtado, Paul R. Field, Chih-Chieh Chen, Andrew Gettelman, Piers M. Forster, Daniel R. Marsh, and Alexandru Rap\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1573,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1573, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContrail cirrus is the largest, but also most uncertain contribution of aviation to global warming. We evaluate for the first time the impact of the host climate model on contrail cirrus properties. Substantial differences exist between contrail cirrus formation, persistence, and radiative effects in the host climate models. Reliable contrail cirrus simulations require advanced representation of cloud optical properties and microphysics, which should be better constrained by observations.\n\nAssessment of the 11-year solar cycle signals in the middle atmosphere in multiple-model ensemble simulations\n\nWenjuan Huo, Tobias Spiegl, Sebastian Wahl, Katja Matthes, Ulrike Langematz, Holger Pohlmann, and JÃ¼rgen KrÃ¶ger\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1288,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1288, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUncertainties of the solar signals in the middle atmosphere are assessed based on large ensemble simulations with multiple climate models. Our results demonstrate the 11-year solar signals in the short wave heating rate, temperature, and ozone anomalies are significant and robust. the simulated dynamical responses are model-dependent, and solar imprints in the polar night jet are influenced by biases in the model used.\n\nAn improved and extended parameterization of the CO2 15 Âµm cooling in the middle and upper atmosphere (CO2_cool_fort-1.0)\n\nManuel LÃ³pez-Puertas, Federico Fabiano, Victor Fomichev, Bernd Funke, and Daniel R. Marsh\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4401–4432, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4401-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4401-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe radiative infrared cooling of CO2 in the middle atmosphere is crucial for computing its thermal structure. It requires one however to include non-local thermodynamic equilibrium processes which are computationally very expensive, which cannot be afforded by climate models. In this work, we present an updated, efficient, accurate and very fast (~50 µs) parameterization of that cooling able to cope with CO2 abundances from half the pre-industrial values to 10 times the current abundance.\n\nPermutation entropy and complexity analysis of large-scale solar wind structures and streams\n\nEmilia K. J. Kilpua, Simon Good, Matti Ala-Lahti, Adnane Osmane, and Venla Koikkalainen\n\nAnn. Geophys., 42, 163–177, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-42-163-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-42-163-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe solar wind is organised into slow and fast streams, interaction regions, and transient structures originating from solar eruptions. Their internal characteristics are not well understood. A more comprehensive understanding of such features can give insight itno physical processes governing their formation and evolution. Using tools from information theory, we find that the solar wind shows universal turbulent properties on smaller scales, while on larger scales, clear differences arise.\n\nImpact of solar cycle on the non-linearity of the relationship between the solar wind parameters and geomagnetic conditions\n\nSanni Hoilijoki, Emilia Kilpua, Adnane Osmane, Lucile Turc, Mikko Savola, Veera Lipsanen, Harriet George, and Milla Kalliokoski\n\nAnn. Geophys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-2024-3,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-2024-3, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for ANGEO\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStructures originating from the Sun, such as coronal mass ejections and high-speed streams, may impact the Earth's magnetosphere differently. The occurrence rate of these structures depends on the phase solar cycle. We use mutual information to study the change in the statistical dependence between solar wind and inner magnetosphere. We find that the non-linearity between solar wind and inner magnetosphere varies over the solar cycle and during different solar wind drivers.\n\nThe Co-benefits of a Low-Carbon Future on Air Quality in Europe\n\nConnor J. Clayton, Daniel R. Marsh, Steven T. Turnock, Ailish M. Graham, Kirsty J. Pringle, Carly L. Reddington, Rajesh Kumar, and James B. McQuaid\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-755,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-755, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe demonstrate that strong climate mitigation could lead to vastly improved air quality in Europe, however, only minimal benefits are seen following the current trajectory of climate mitigation. We use a model that allows us to see where the improvements are greatest (Central Europe) and analyse what sectors are most important for achieving these co-benefits (agriculture/power).\n\nDownward Coupling of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings: Important Role of Synoptic-Scale Waves Demonstrated by ERA5 Reanalysis\n\nTabea Rahm, Robin Pilch Kedzierski, Martje HÃ¤nsch, and Katja Matthes\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-667,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-667, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are extreme wintertime events that can impact surface weather. However, a distinct surface response is not observed for every SSW. Here, we classify SSWs that do and do not impact the troposphere in ERA5 reanalysis data. In addition, we evaluate the effects of two kinds of waves: planetary and synoptic-scale. Our findings emphasize that the lower stratosphere and synoptic-scale waves play crucial roles in coupling the SSW signal to the surface.\n\nTowards the definition of a solar forcing dataset for CMIP7\n\nBernd Funke, Thierry Dudok de Wit, Ilaria Ermolli, Margit Haberreiter, Doug Kinnison, Daniel Marsh, Hilde Nesse, Annika SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, Miriam Sinnhuber, and Ilya Usoskin\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 1217–1227, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1217-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-1217-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe outline a road map for the preparation of a solar forcing dataset for the upcoming Phase 7 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP7), considering the latest scientific advances made in the reconstruction of solar forcing and in the understanding of climate response while also addressing the issues that were raised during CMIP6.\n\nOpinion: Recent developments and future directions in studying the mesosphere and lower thermosphere\n\nJohn M. C. Plane, JÃ¶rg Gumbel, Konstantinos S. Kalogerakis, Daniel R. Marsh, and Christian von Savigny\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13255–13282, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13255-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13255-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe mesosphere or lower thermosphere region of the atmosphere borders the edge of space. It is subject to extreme ultraviolet photons and charged particles from the Sun and atmospheric gravity waves from below, which tend to break in this region. The pressure is very low, which facilitates chemistry involving species in excited states, and this is also the region where cosmic dust ablates and injects various metals. The result is a unique and exotic chemistry.\n\nElectron radiation belt safety indices based on the SafeSpace modelling pipeline and dedicated to the internal charging risk\n\nNour Dahmen, Antoine Brunet, Sebastien Bourdarie, Christos Katsavrias, Guillerme Bernoux, Stefanos Doulfis, Afroditi Nasi, Ingmar Sandberg, Constantinos Papadimitriou, Jesus Oliveros Fernandez, and Ioannis Daglis\n\nAnn.

The energetic ones are trapped around Earth in radiation belts.

Salinas, Dong L. Wu, Jae N. Lee, Loren C. Chang, Liying Qian, and Hanli Liu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 1705–1730, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1705-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1705-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUpper mesospheric carbon monoxide's (CO) photochemical lifetime is longer than dynamical timescales. This work uses satellite observations and model simulations to establish that the migrating diurnal tide and its seasonal and interannual variabilities drive CO primarily through vertical advection. Vertical advection is a transport process that is currently difficult to observe. This work thus shows that we can use CO as a tracer for vertical advection across seasonal and interannual timescales.\n\nImproving interpretation of sea-level projections through a machine-learning-based local explanation approach\n\nJeremy Rohmer, Remi Thieblemont, Goneri Le Cozannet, Heiko Goelzer, and Gael Durand\n\nThe Cryosphere, 16, 4637–4657, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4637-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-4637-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo improve the interpretability of process-based projections of the sea-level contribution from land ice components, we apply the machine-learning-based SHapley Additive exPlanations approach to a subset of a multi-model ensemble study for the Greenland ice sheet. This allows us to quantify the influence of particular modelling decisions (related to numerical implementation, initial conditions, or parametrisation of ice-sheet processes) directly in terms of sea-level change contribution.\n\nPartitioning the contributions of dependent offshore forcing conditions in the probabilistic assessment of future coastal flooding\n\nJeremy Rohmer, Deborah Idier, Remi Thieblemont, Goneri Le Cozannet, and FranÃ§ois Bachoc\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3167–3182, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3167-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3167-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe quantify the influence of wave–wind characteristics, offshore water level and sea level rise (projected up to 2200) on the occurrence of flooding events at GÃ¢vres, French Atlantic coast. Our results outline the overwhelming influence of sea level rise over time compared to the others. By showing the robustness of our conclusions to the errors in the estimation procedure, our approach proves to be valuable for exploring and characterizing uncertainties in assessments of future flooding.\n\nComparison of middle- and low-latitude sodium layer from a ground-based lidar network, the Odin satellite, and WACCMâNa model\n\nBingkun Yu, Xianghui Xue, Christopher J.

Comprehensively, comparisons show good agreement and some discrepancies between ground-based observations, satellite measurements, and global model simulations.\n\nThe influence of energetic particle precipitation on Antarctic stratospheric chlorine and ozone over the 20th century\n\nVille Maliniemi, Pavle Arsenovic, Annika SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, and Hilde Nesse TyssÃ¸y\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 8137–8149, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8137-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8137-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulate the effect of energetic particle precipitation (EPP) on Antarctic stratospheric ozone chemistry over the whole 20th century. We find a significant increase of reactive nitrogen due to EP, which can deplete ozone via a catalytic reaction. Furthermore, significant modulation of active chlorine is obtained related to EPP, which impacts ozone depletion by both active chlorine and EPP. Our results show that EPP has been a significant modulator of ozone chemistry during the CFC era.\n\nThe Sun's role in decadal climate predictability in the North Atlantic\n\nAnnika Drews, Wenjuan Huo, Katja Matthes, Kunihiko Kodera, and Tim Kruschke\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 7893–7904, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7893-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7893-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSolar irradiance varies with a period of approximately 11 years. Using a unique large chemistry–climate model dataset, we investigate the solar surface signal in the North Atlantic and European region and find that it changes over time, depending on the strength of the solar cycle. For the first time, we estimate the potential predictability associated with including realistic solar forcing in a model. These results may improve seasonal to decadal predictions of European climate.\n\nThe âSafeSpaceâ database of ULF power spectral density and radial diffusion coefficients: dependencies and application to simulations\n\nChristos Katsavrias, Afroditi Nasi, Ioannis A. Daglis, Sigiava Aminalragia-Giamini, Nourallah Dahmen, Constantinos Papadimitriou, Marina Georgiou, Antoine Brunet, and Sebastien Bourdarie\n\nAnn. Geophys., 40, 379–393, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-379-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-379-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe radial diffusion mechanism is of utmost importance to both the acceleration and loss of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt and, consequently, for physics-based models, which provide nowcasting and forecasting of the electron population. In the framework of the \"SafeSpace\" project, we have created a database of calculated radial diffusion coefficients, and, furthermore, we have exploited it to provide insights for future modelling efforts.\n\nDayside magnetopause reconnection and flux transfer events under radial interplanetary magnetic field (IMF): BepiColombo Earth-flyby observations\n\nWeijie Sun, James A. Slavin, Rumi Nakamura, Daniel Heyner, Karlheinz J. Trattner, Johannes Z. D. Mieth, Jiutong Zhao, Qiu-Gang Zong, Sae Aizawa, Nicolas Andre, and Yoshifumi Saito\n\nAnn. Geophys., 40, 217–229, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-217-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-217-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents observations of FTE-type flux ropes on the dayside during BepiColombo's Earth flyby. FTE-type flux ropes are a well-known feature of magnetic reconnection on the magnetopause, and they can be used to constrain the location of reconnection X-lines. Our study suggests that the magnetopause X-line passed BepiColombo from the north as it traversed the magnetopause. Moreover, our results also strongly support coalescence creating larger flux ropes by combining smaller ones.\n\nMagnetospheric response to solar wind forcing: ultra-low-frequency waveâparticle interaction perspective\n\nQiugang Zong\n\nAnn. Geophys., 40, 121–150, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-121-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-121-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMagnetospheric physics is in an extremely vibrant phase, with a number of ongoing and highly successful missions, e.g., Cluster, THEMIS, Van Allen Probes, and the MMS spacecraft, providing the most amazing observations and data sets. Since there are many fundamental and unsolved problems, in this paper I have addressed selected topics of ULF wave–charged particle interactions which encompass many special fields of radiation belt, ring current and plasmaspheric physics.\n\nTwenty-first-century Southern Hemisphere impacts of ozone recovery and climate change from the stratosphere to the ocean\n\nIoana Ivanciu, Katja Matthes, Arne Biastoch, Sebastian Wahl, and Jan HarlaÃ\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 139–171, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-139-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-139-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGreenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase, while the Antarctic ozone hole is expected to recover during the twenty-first century. We separate the effects of ozone recovery and of greenhouse gases on the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and we find that ozone recovery is generally reducing the impact of greenhouse gases, with the exception of certain regions of the stratosphere during spring, where the two effects reinforce each other.\n\nQuantifying the non-linear dependence of energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's radiation belts with radial diffusion drivers\n\nAdnane Osmane, Mikko Savola, Emilia Kilpua, Hannu Koskinen, Joseph E. Borovsky, and Milla Kalliokoski\n\nAnn. Geophys., 40, 37–53, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-37-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-40-37-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt has long been known that particles get accelerated close to the speed of light in the near-Earth space environment. Research in the last decades has also clarified what processes and waves are responsible for the acceleration of particles. However, it is difficult to quantify the scale of the impact of various processes competing with one another. In this study we present a methodology to quantify the impact waves can have on energetic particles.\n\nSelf-consistent global transport of metallic ions with WACCM-X\n\nJianfei Wu, Wuhu Feng, Han-Li Liu, Xianghui Xue, Daniel Robert Marsh, and John Maurice Campbell Plane\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 15619–15630, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15619-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15619-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMetal layers occur in the MLT region (80–120 km) from the ablation of cosmic dust. The latest lidar observations show these metals can reach a height approaching 200 km, which is challenging to explain. We have developed the first global simulation incorporating the full life cycle of metal atoms and ions. The model results compare well with lidar and satellite observations of the seasonal and diurnal variation of the metals and demonstrate the importance of ion mass and ion-neutral coupling.\n\nSea-level rise in Venice: historic and future trends (review article)\n\nDavide Zanchettin, Sara Bruni, Fabio Raicich, Piero Lionello, Fanny Adloff, Alexey Androsov, Fabrizio Antonioli, Vincenzo Artale, Eugenio Carminati, Christian Ferrarin, Vera Fofonova, Robert J. Nicholls, Sara Rubinetti, Angelo Rubino, Gianmaria Sannino, Giorgio Spada, RÃ©mi ThiÃ©blemont, Michael Tsimplis, Georg Umgiesser, Stefano Vignudelli, Guy WÃ¶ppelmann, and Susanna Zerbini\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2643–2678, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2643-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2643-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRelative sea level in Venice rose by about 2.5 mm/year in the past 150 years due to the combined effect of subsidence and mean sea-level rise. We estimate the likely range of mean sea-level rise in Venice by 2100 due to climate changes to be between about 10 and 110 cm, with an improbable yet possible high-end scenario of about 170 cm. Projections of subsidence are not available, but historical evidence demonstrates that they can increase the hazard posed by climatically induced sea-level rise.\n\nDoes the coupling of the semiannual oscillation with the quasi-biennial oscillation provide predictability of Antarctic sudden stratospheric warmings?\n\nViktoria J. NordstrÃ¶m and Annika SeppÃ¤lÃ¤\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 12835–12853, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-12835-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-12835-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe winter winds over Antarctica form a stable vortex. However, in 2019 the vortex was disrupted and the temperature in the polar stratosphere rose by 50Â°C. This event, called a sudden stratospheric warming, is a rare event in the Southern Hemisphere, with the only known major event having taken place in 2002. The 2019 event helps us unravel its causes, which are largely unknown. We have discovered a unique behaviour of the equatorial winds in 2002 and 2019 that may signal an impending SH SSW.\n\nDeep uncertainties in shoreline change projections: an extra-probabilistic approach applied to sandy beaches\n\nRÃ©mi ThiÃ©blemont, GonÃ©ri Le Cozannet, JÃ©rÃ©my Rohmer, Alexandra Toimil, MoisÃ©s Ãlvarez-Cuesta, and IÃ±igo J. Losada\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2257–2276, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2257-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2257-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSea level rise and its acceleration are projected to aggravate coastal erosion over the 21st century. Resulting shoreline projections are deeply uncertain, however, which constitutes a major challenge for coastal planning and management. Our work presents a new extra-probabilistic framework to develop future shoreline projections and shows that deep uncertainties could be drastically reduced by better constraining sea level projections and improving coastal impact models.\n\nEffects of enhanced downwelling of NOx on Antarctic upper-stratospheric ozone in the 21stÂ century\n\nVille Maliniemi, Hilde Nesse TyssÃ¸y, Christine Smith-Johnsen, Pavle Arsenovic, and Daniel R. Marsh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 11041–11052, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-11041-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-11041-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe simulate ozone variability over the 21st century with different greenhouse gas scenarios. Our results highlight a novel mechanism of additional reactive nitrogen species descending to the Antarctic stratosphere from the thermosphere/upper mesosphere due to the accelerated residual circulation under climate change. This excess descending NOx can potentially prevent a super recovery of ozone in the Antarctic upper stratosphere.\n\nIon distribution functions in magnetotail reconnection: global hybrid-Vlasov simulation results\n\nAndrei Runov, Maxime Grandin, Minna Palmroth, Markus Battarbee, Urs Ganse, Heli Hietala, Sanni Hoilijoki, Emilia Kilpua, Yann Pfau-Kempf, Sergio Toledo-Redondo, Lucile Turc, and Drew Turner\n\nAnn. Geophys., 39, 599–612, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-599-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-599-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn collisionless systems like space plasma, particle velocity distributions contain fingerprints of ongoing physical processes. However, it is challenging to decode this information from observations. We used hybrid-Vlasov simulations to obtain ion velocity distribution functions at different locations and at different stages of the Earth's magnetosphere dynamics. The obtained distributions provide valuable examples that may be directly compared with observations by satellites in space.\n\nIMK/IAA MIPAS temperature retrieval version 8: nominal measurements\n\nMichael Kiefer, Thomas von Clarmann, Bernd Funke, Maya GarcÃ­a-Comas, Norbert Glatthor, Udo Grabowski, Sylvia Kellmann, Anne Kleinert, Alexandra Laeng, Andrea Linden, Manuel LÃ³pez-Puertas, Daniel R. Marsh, and Gabriele P. Stiller\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 4111–4138, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4111-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-4111-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn improved dataset of vertical temperature profiles of the Earth's atmosphere in the altitude range 5–70 km is presented. These profiles are derived from measurements of the MIPAS instrument onboard ESA's Envisat satellite. The overall improvements are based on upgrades in the input data and several improvements in the data processing approach. Both of these are discussed, and an extensive error discussion is included. Enhancements of the new dataset are demonstrated by means of examples.\n\nOn the semi-annual variation of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt\n\nChristos Katsavrias, Constantinos Papadimitriou, Sigiava Aminalragia-Giamini, Ioannis A. Daglis, Ingmar Sandberg, and Piers Jiggens\n\nAnn. Geophys., 39, 413–425, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-413-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-39-413-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe nature of the semi-annual variation in the relativistic electron fluxes in the Earth's outer radiation belt has been a debate for over 30 years. Our work shows that it is primarily driven by the Russell–McPherron effect, which indicates that reconnection is responsible not only for the short-scale but also the seasonal variability of the electron belt as well. Moreover, it is more pronounced during the descending phase of the solar cycles and coexists with periods of fast solar wind speed.\n\nEffects of prescribed CMIP6 ozone on simulating the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation response to ozone depletion\n\nIoana Ivanciu, Katja Matthes, Sebastian Wahl, Jan HarlaÃ, and Arne Biastoch\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 5777–5806, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5777-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5777-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic ozone hole has driven substantial dynamical changes in the Southern Hemisphere atmosphere over the past decades. This study separates the historical impacts of ozone depletion from those of rising levels of greenhouse gases and investigates how these impacts are captured in two types of climate models: one using interactive atmospheric chemistry and one prescribing the CMIP6 ozone field. The effects of ozone depletion are more pronounced in the model with interactive chemistry.\n\nInterhemispheric transport of metallic ions within ionospheric sporadic E layers by the lower thermospheric meridional circulation\n\nBingkun Yu, Xianghui Xue, Christopher J. Scott, Jianfei Wu, Xinan Yue, Wuhu Feng, Yutian Chi, Daniel R. Marsh, Hanli Liu, Xiankang Dou, and John M. C. Plane\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 4219–4230, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-4219-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-4219-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA long-standing mystery of metal ions within Es layers in the Earth's upper atmosphere is the marked seasonal dependence, with a summer maximum and a winter minimum. We report a large-scale winter-to-summer transport of metal ions from 6-year multi-satellite observations and worldwide ground-based stations. A global atmospheric circulation is responsible for the phenomenon. Our results emphasise the effect of this atmospheric circulation on the transport of composition in the upper atmosphere.\n\nObservational evidence of energetic particle precipitation NOx (EPP-NOx) interaction with chlorine curbing Antarctic ozone loss\n\nEmily M. Gordon, Annika SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, Bernd Funke, Johanna Tamminen, and Kaley A. Walker\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 2819–2836, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2819-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2819-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnergetic particle precipitation (EPP) is the rain of solar energetic particles into the Earth's atmosphere. EPP is known to deplete O3 in the polar mesosphere–upper stratosphere via the formation of NOx. NOx also causes chlorine deactivation in the lower stratosphere and has, thus, been proposed to potentially result in reduced ozone depletion in the spring. We provide the first evidence to show that NOx formed by EPP is able to remove active chlorine, resulting in enhanced total ozone column.\n\nTimescales of emergence of chronic flooding in the major economic center of Guadeloupe\n\nGonÃ©ri Le Cozannet, DÃ©borah Idier, Marcello de Michele, Yoann Legendre, Manuel Moisan, Rodrigo Pedreros, RÃ©mi ThiÃ©blemont, Giorgio Spada, Daniel Raucoules, and Ywenn de la Torre\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 703–722, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-703-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-703-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChronic flooding occurring at high tides under calm weather conditions is an early impact of sea-level rise. This hazard is a reason for concern on tropical islands, where coastal infrastructure is commonly located in low-lying areas. We focus here on the Guadeloupe archipelago, in the French Antilles, where chronic flood events have been reported for about 10 years. We show that the number of such events will increase drastically over the 21st century under continued growth of CO2 emissions.\n\nFormation of an additional density peak in the bottom side of the sodium layer associated with the passage of multiple mesospheric frontal systems\n\nViswanathan Lakshmi Narayanan, Satonori Nozawa, Shin-Ichiro Oyama, Ingrid Mann, Kazuo Shiokawa, Yuichi Otsuka, Norihito Saito, Satoshi Wada, Takuya D. Kawahara, and Toru Takahashi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 2343–2361, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2343-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2343-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the past, additional sodium peaks occurring above the main sodium layer of the upper mesosphere were discussed. Here, formation of an additional sodium peak below the main sodium layer peak is discussed in detail. The event coincided with passage of multiple mesospheric bores, which are step-like disturbances occurring in the upper mesosphere. Hence, this work highlights the importance of such mesospheric bores in causing significant changes to the minor species concentration in a short time.\n\nThe response of mesospheric H2O and CO to solar irradiance variability in models and observations\n\nArseniy Karagodin-Doyennel, Eugene Rozanov, Ales Kuchar, William Ball, Pavle Arsenovic, Ellis Remsberg, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Markus Kunze, David A. Plummer, Andrea Stenke, Daniel Marsh, Doug Kinnison, and Thomas Peter\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 201–216, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-201-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-201-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe solar signal in the mesospheric H2O and CO was extracted from the CCMI-1 model simulations and satellite observations using multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. MLR analysis shows a pronounced and statistically robust solar signal in both H2O and CO. The model results show a general agreement with observations reproducing a negative/positive solar signal in H2O/CO. The pattern of the solar signal varies among the considered models, reflecting some differences in the model setup.\n\nSensitivity of the Southern Hemisphere circumpolar jet response to Antarctic ozone depletion: prescribed versus interactive chemistry\n\nSabine Haase, Jaika Fricke, Tim Kruschke, Sebastian Wahl, and Katja Matthes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 14043–14061, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-14043-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-14043-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOzone depletion over Antarctica was shown to influence the tropospheric jet in the Southern Hemisphere. We investigate the atmospheric response to ozone depletion comparing climate model ensembles with interactive and prescribed ozone fields. We show that allowing feedbacks between ozone chemistry and model physics as well as including asymmetries in ozone leads to a strengthened ozone depletion signature in the stratosphere but does not significantly affect the tropospheric jet position.\n\nNew insights into Rossby wave packet properties in the extratropical UTLS using GNSS radio occultations\n\nRobin Pilch Kedzierski, Katja Matthes, and Karl Bumke\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 11569–11592, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11569-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-11569-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRossby wave packet (RWP) dynamics are crucial for weather forecasting, climate change projections and stratosphere–troposphere interactions. Our study is a first attempt to describe RWP behavior in the UTLS with global coverage directly from observations, using GNSS-RO data. Our novel results show an interesting relation of RWP vertical propagation with sudden stratospheric warmings and provide very useful information to improve RWP diagnostics in models and reanalysis.\n\nMagnetic field fluctuation properties of coronal mass ejection-driven sheath regions in the near-Earth solar wind\n\nEmilia K. J. Kilpua, Dominique Fontaine, Simon W. Good, Matti Ala-Lahti, Adnane Osmane, Erika Palmerio, Emiliya Yordanova, Clement Moissard, Lina Z. Hadid, and Miho Janvier\n\nAnn. Geophys., 38, 999–1017, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-999-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-999-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper studies magnetic field fluctuations in three turbulent sheath regions ahead of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) in the near-Earth solar wind. Our results show that fluctuation properties vary significantly in different parts of the sheath when compared to solar wind ahead. Turbulence in sheaths resembles that of the slow solar wind in the terrestrial magnetosheath, e.g. regarding compressibility and intermittency, and it often lacks Kolmogorov's spectral indices.\n\nOuter Van Allen belt trapped and precipitating electron flux responses to two interplanetary magnetic clouds of opposite polarity\n\nHarriet George, Emilia Kilpua, Adnane Osmane, Timo Asikainen, Milla M. H. Kalliokoski, Craig J. Rodger, Stepan Dubyagin, and Minna Palmroth\n\nAnn. Geophys., 38, 931–951, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-931-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-931-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compared trapped outer radiation belt electron fluxes to high-latitude precipitating electron fluxes during two interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) with opposite magnetic cloud rotation. The electron response had many similarities and differences between the two events, indicating that different acceleration mechanisms acted. Van Allen Probe data were used for trapped electron flux measurements, and Polar Operational Environmental Satellites were used for precipitating flux data.\n\nImpact of North Atlantic SST and Jet Stream anomalies on European Heat Waves\n\nJulian KrÃ¼ger, Robin Pilch Kedzierski, Karl Bumke, and Katja Matthes\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2020-32,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2020-32, 2020\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMotivated by the European heat wave occurrences of 2015 and 2018, this study evaluates the influence of cold North Atlantic SST anomalies on European heat waves by using the ERA-5 reanalysis product. Our findings show that widespread cold North Atlantic SST anomalies may be a precursor for a persistent jet stream pattern and are thus important for the onset of high European temperatures.\n\nStatistical response of middle atmosphere composition to solar proton events in WACCM-D simulations: the importance of lower ionospheric chemistry\n\nNiilo Kalakoski, Pekka T. Verronen, Annika SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, Monika E. SzelÄ g, Antti Kero, and Daniel R. Marsh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 8923–8938, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8923-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8923-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEffects of solar proton events (SPEs) on middle atmosphere chemistry were studied using the WACCM-D chemistry–climate model, including an improved representation of lower ionosphere ion chemistry. This study includes 66 events in the years 1989–2012 and uses a statistical approach to determine the impact of the improved chemistry scheme. The differences shown highlight the importance of ion chemistry in models used to study energetic particle precipitation.\n\nMagnetic-local-time dependency of radiation belt electron precipitation: impact on ozone in the polar middle atmosphere\n\nPekka T. Verronen, Daniel R. Marsh, Monika E. SzelÄ g, and Niilo Kalakoski\n\nAnn. Geophys., 38, 833–844, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-833-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-833-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper is the first to study how the representation of the magnetic-local-time (MLT) dependency of electron precipitation impacts middle-atmospheric-ozone response on monthly timescales. We use a state-of-the-art chemistry–climate model with detailed lower-ionospheric chemistry for an advanced representation of atmospheric impacts of electron forcing. We find that the use of daily zonal-mean electron forcing will provide an accurate ozone response in long-term climate simulations.\n\nBeiDa Imaging Electron Spectrometer observation of multi-period electron flux modulation caused by localized ultra-low-frequency waves\n\nXingran Chen, Qiugang Zong, Hong Zou, Xuzhi Zhou, Li Li, Yixin Hao, and Yongfu Wang\n\nAnn. Geophys., 38, 801–813, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-801-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-801-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new in situ observation of energetic electrons in space obtained by a newly available particle detector. In view of the characteristic signatures in the particle flux, we attribute the observational features to the drift-resonance waveâparticle interaction between energetic electrons and multiple localized ultra-low-frequency waves. The scenario is substantiated by a numerical calculation based on the revised drift-resonance theory which reproduced the observed particle signatures.\n\nQuantifying uncertainties of climate signals in chemistry climate models related to the 11-year solar cycle â Part 1: Annual mean response in heating rates, temperature, and ozone\n\nMarkus Kunze, Tim Kruschke, Ulrike Langematz, Miriam Sinnhuber, Thomas Reddmann, and Katja Matthes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 6991–7019, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6991-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6991-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModelling the response of the atmosphere and its constituents to 11-year solar variations is subject to a certain uncertainty arising from the solar irradiance data set used in the chemistry–climate model (CCM) and the applied CCM itself. This study reveals significant influences from both sources on the variations in the solar response in the stratosphere and mesosphere. However, there are also regions where the random, unexplained part of the variations in the solar response is largest.\n\nOuter radiation belt and inner magnetospheric response to sheath regions of coronal mass ejections: a statistical analysis\n\nMilla M. H. Kalliokoski, Emilia K. J. Kilpua, Adnane Osmane, Drew L. Turner, Allison N. Jaynes, Lucile Turc, Harriet George, and Minna Palmroth\n\nAnn. Geophys., 38, 683–701, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-683-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-683-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a comprehensive statistical study of the response of the Earth's space environment in sheath regions prior to interplanetary coronal mass ejections. The inner magnetospheric wave activity is enhanced in sheath regions, and the sheaths cause significant changes to the outer radiation belt electron fluxes over short timescales. We also show that non-geoeffective sheaths can result in a significant response.\n\nOn the forcings of the unusual Quasi-Biennial Oscillation structure in February 2016\n\nHaiyan Li, Robin Pilch Kedzierski, and Katja Matthes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 6541–6561, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6541-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6541-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe QBO westerly phase was reversed by an unexpected easterly jet near 40 hPa and the westerly zonal wind lasted an unusually long time at 20 hPa during winter 2015/16. We find that quasi-stationary Rossby wave W1 and faster Rossby wave W2 propagating from the northern extratropics and a locally generated Rossby wave W3 were important contributors to the easterly jet at 40 hPa. Our results suggest that the unusual zonal wind structure at 20 hPa could be caused by enhanced Kelvin wave activity.\n\nThe Flexible Ocean and Climate Infrastructure version 1 (FOCI1): mean state and variability\n\nKatja Matthes, Arne Biastoch, Sebastian Wahl, Jan HarlaÃ, Torge Martin, Tim BrÃ¼cher, Annika Drews, Dana Ehlert, Klaus Getzlaff, Fritz KrÃ¼ger, Willi Rath, Markus Scheinert, Franziska U. Schwarzkopf, Tobias Bayr, Hauke Schmidt, and Wonsun Park\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 2533–2568, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2533-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2533-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new Earth system model, the Flexible Ocean and Climate Infrastructure (FOCI), is introduced, consisting of a high-top atmosphere, an ocean model, sea-ice and land surface model components. A unique feature of FOCI is the ability to explicitly resolve small-scale oceanic features, for example, the Agulhas Current and the Gulf Stream. It allows to study the evolution of the climate system on regional and seasonal to (multi)decadal scales and bridges the gap to coarse-resolution climate models.\n\nEvidence for energetic particle precipitation and quasi-biennial oscillation modulations of the Antarctic NO2 springtime stratospheric column from OMI observations\n\nEmily M. Gordon, Annika SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, and Johanna Tamminen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 6259–6271, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6259-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-6259-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Sun constantly emits high-energy charged particles that produce the ozone destroying chemical NOx in the polar atmosphere. NOx is transported to the stratosphere, where the ozone layer is. Satellite observations show that the NOx gases remain in the atmosphere longer than previously reported. This is influenced by the strength of atmospheric large-scale dynamics, suggesting that there are specific times when this type of solar influence on the Antarctic atmosphere becomes more pronounced.\n\nCosmic noise absorption signature of particle precipitation during interplanetary coronal mass ejection sheaths and ejecta\n\nEmilia Kilpua, Liisa Juusola, Maxime Grandin, Antti Kero, Stepan Dubyagin, Noora Partamies, Adnane Osmane, Harriet George, Milla Kalliokoski, Tero Raita, Timo Asikainen, and Minna Palmroth\n\nAnn. Geophys., 38, 557–574, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-557-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-38-557-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoronal mass ejection sheaths and ejecta are key drivers of significant space weather storms, and they cause dramatic changes in radiation belt electron fluxes. Differences in precipitation of high-energy electrons from the belts to the upper atmosphere are thus expected. We investigate here differences in sheath- and ejecta-induced precipitation using the Finnish riometer (relative ionospheric opacity meter) chain.\n\nGUMICS-4 analysis of interplanetary coronal mass ejection impact on Earth during low and typical Mach number solar winds\n\nAntti Lakka, Tuija I. Pulkkinen, Andrew P. Dimmock, Emilia Kilpua, Matti Ala-Lahti, Ilja Honkonen, Minna Palmroth, and Osku Raukunen\n\nAnn. Geophys., 37, 561–579, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-561-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-561-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study how the Earth's space environment responds to two different amplitude interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) events that occurred in 2012 and 2014 by using the GUMICS-4 global MHD model. We examine local and large-scale dynamics of the Earth's space environment and compare simulation results to in situ data. It is shown that during moderate driving simulation agrees well with the measurements; however, GMHD results should be interpreted cautiously during strong driving.\n\nPhotochemistry on the bottom side of the mesospheric Na layer\n\nTao Yuan, Wuhu Feng, John M. C. Plane, and Daniel R. Marsh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 3769–3777, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-3769-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-3769-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Na layer in the upper atmosphere is very sensitive to solar radiation and varies considerably during sunrise and sunset. In this paper, we use the lidar observations and an advanced model to investigate this process. We found that the variation is mostly due to the changes in several photochemical reactions involving Na compounds, especially NaHCO3. We also reveal that the Fe layer in the same region changes more quickly than the Na layer due to a faster reaction rate of FeOH to sunlight.\n\nThe importance of interactive chemistry for stratosphereâtroposphere coupling\n\nSabine Haase and Katja Matthes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 3417–3432, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-3417-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-3417-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Antarctic ozone hole influences surface climate in the Southern Hemisphere. Recent studies have shown that stratospheric ozone depletion in the Arctic can also affect the surface. We evaluate the importance of the direct and indirect representation of ozone variability in a climate model for this surface response. We show that allowing feedbacks between ozone chemistry, radiation, and dynamics enhances and prolongs the surface response to Northern Hemisphere spring ozone depletion.\n\nSimulation study for ground-based Ku-band microwave observations of ozone and hydroxyl in the polar middle atmosphere\n\nDavid A. Newnham, Mark A. Clilverd, Michael Kosch, Annika SeppÃ¤lÃ¤, and Pekka T. Verronen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 1375–1392, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-1375-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-1375-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA simulation study has been carried out to investigate the potential for observing ozone and hydroxyl radical abundances in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere using ground-based passive microwave radiometry. In the polar middle atmosphere these chemical species respond strongly to geomagnetic activity associated with space weather. The results show that measuring diurnal variations in ozone and hydroxyl from high-latitude Northern Hemisphere and Antarctic locations would be possible.\n\nOn the relative roles of dynamics and chemistry governing the abundance and diurnal variation of low-latitude thermospheric nitric oxide\n\nDavid E. Siskind, McArthur Jones Jr., Douglas P. Drob, John P. McCormack, Mark E. Hervig, Daniel R. Marsh, Martin G. Mlynczak, Scott M. Bailey, Astrid Maute, and Nicholas J. Mitchell\n\nAnn. Geophys., 37, 37–48, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-37-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-37-37-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use data from two NASA satellites and a general circulation model of the upper atmosphere to elucidate the key factors governing the abundance and diurnal variation of nitric oxide (NO) at near-solar minimum conditions and low latitudes. This has been difficult to do previously, because NO data are typically taken from satellites in sun-synchronous orbits, meaning that they only acquire data in fixed local times. We overcome this limitation through model simulations of the NO diurnal cycle.\n\nComparison of gravity wave propagation directions observed by mesospheric airglow imaging at three different latitudes using the M-transform\n\nSepti Perwitasari, Takuji Nakamura, Masaru Kogure, Yoshihiro Tomikawa, Mitsumu K. Ejiri, and Kazuo Shiokawa\n\nAnn. Geophys., 36, 1597–1605, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1597-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1597-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have developed a user-friendly program that can efficiently deal with extensive amounts of airglow data. We have applied this new program to airglow data obtained at different latitudes in polar, midlatitude, and equatorial regions and demonstrated distinct differences in atmospheric gravity wave (AGW) propagation characteristics and energy distribution. We aim to encourage other AGW research groups to use the program and do comparisons to reveal AGW characteristics on a more global scale.\n\nStatistical study of ULF waves in the magnetotail by THEMIS observations\n\nShuai Zhang, Anmin Tian, Quanqi Shi, Hanlin Li, Alexander W. Degeling, I. Jonathan Rae, Colin Forsyth, Mengmeng Wang, Xiaochen Shen, Weijie Sun, Shichen Bai, Ruilong Guo, Huizi Wang, Andrew Fazakerley, Suiyan Fu, and Zuyin Pu\n\nAnn. Geophys., 36, 1335–1346, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1335-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1335-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe features of ULF waves are statistically studied on the magnetotail stretched magnetic field lines (8 RE < R < 32 RE) by using 8 years of THEMIS data. The occurrence rates of ULF waves are higher in the post-midnight region than pre-midnight region. The frequency decreases with increasing radial distance of 8–16 RE and could be explained by much more standing waves in this region than in the region of 16–32 RE. The wave frequency is higher after the substorm onset than before it.\n\nFast plasma sheet flows and X line motion in the Earth's magnetotail: results from a global hybrid-Vlasov simulation\n\nLiisa Juusola, Sanni Hoilijoki, Yann Pfau-Kempf, Urs Ganse, Riku Jarvinen, Markus Battarbee, Emilia Kilpua, Lucile Turc, and Minna Palmroth\n\nAnn. Geophys., 36, 1183–1199, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1183-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1183-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe solar wind interacts with the Earthâs magnetic field, forming a magnetosphere. On the night side solar wind stretches the magnetosphere into a long tail. A process called magnetic reconnection opens the magnetic field lines and reconnects them, accelerating particles to high energies. We study this in the magnetotail using a numerical simulation model of the Earthâs magnetosphere. We study the motion of the points where field lines reconnect and the fast flows driven by this process.\n\nClimatology of mesopause region nocturnal temperature, zonal wind and sodium density observed by sodium lidar over Hefei, China (32Â° N, 117Â° E)\n\nTao Li, Chao Ban, Xin Fang, Jing Li, Zhaopeng Wu, Wuhu Feng, John M. C. Plane, Jiangang Xiong, Daniel R. Marsh, Michael J. Mills, and Xiankang Dou\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 11683–11695, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-11683-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-11683-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA total of 154 nights of observations by the USTC Na temperature and wind lidar (32Â° N, 117Â° E) suggest significant seasonal variability in the mesopause. Chemistry plays an important role in Na atom formation. More than half of the observed gravity wave (GW) momentum flux (MF), whose divergence determines the GW forcing, is induced by short-period (10 min–2 h) waves. The anticorrelation between MF and zonal wind (U) suggests strong filtering of short-period GWs by semiannual oscillation U.\n\nThe representation of solar cycle signals in stratospheric ozone â PartÂ 2: Analysis of global models\n\nAmanda C. Maycock, Katja Matthes, Susann Tegtmeier, Hauke Schmidt, RÃ©mi ThiÃ©blemont, Lon Hood, Hideharu Akiyoshi, Slimane Bekki, Makoto Deushi, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Oliver Kirner, Markus Kunze, Marion Marchand, Daniel R. Marsh, Martine Michou, David Plummer, Laura E. Revell, Eugene Rozanov, Andrea Stenke, Yousuke Yamashita, and Kohei Yoshida\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 11323–11343, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-11323-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-11323-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe 11-year solar cycle is an important driver of climate variability. Changes in incoming solar ultraviolet radiation affect atmospheric ozone, which in turn influences atmospheric temperatures. Constraining the impact of the solar cycle on ozone is therefore important for understanding climate variability. This study examines the representation of the solar influence on ozone in numerical models used to simulate past and future climate. We highlight important differences among model datasets.\n\nCavitons and spontaneous hot flow anomalies in a hybrid-Vlasov global magnetospheric simulation\n\nXochitl Blanco-Cano, Markus Battarbee, Lucile Turc, Andrew P. Dimmock, Emilia K. J. Kilpua, Sanni Hoilijoki, Urs Ganse, David G. Sibeck, Paul A. Cassak, Robert C. Fear, Riku Jarvinen, Liisa Juusola, Yann Pfau-Kempf, Rami Vainio, and Minna Palmroth\n\nAnn. Geophys., 36, 1081–1097, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1081-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-1081-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use the Vlasiator code to study the characteristics of transient structures that exist in the Earth's foreshock, i.e. upstream of the bow shock. The structures are cavitons and spontaneous hot flow anomalies (SHFAs). These transients can interact with the bow shock. We study the changes the shock suffers via this interaction. We also investigate ion distributions associated with the cavitons and SHFAs. A very important result is that the arrival of multiple SHFAs results in shock erosion.\n\nProduction and transport mechanisms of NO in the polar upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere in observations and models\n\nKoen Hendrickx, Linda Megner, Daniel R. Marsh, and Christine Smith-Johnsen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 9075–9089, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-9075-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-9075-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe mechanisms that produce, destroy and transport nitric oxide (NO) in the Antarctic mesosphere and lower thermosphere are investigated in AIM-SOFIE satellite observations and compared to SD-WACCM simulations. During winter, NO concentrations are most similar while the altitude of maximum NO number densities is most separated. Even though the rate of descent is similar in both datasets, the simulated descending NO flux is too low in concentration, which reflects a missing source of NO.\n\nStatistical analysis of mirror mode waves in sheath regions driven by interplanetary coronal mass ejection\n\nMatti M. Ala-Lahti, Emilia K. J. Kilpua, Andrew P. Dimmock, Adnane Osmane, Tuija Pulkkinen, and Jan SouÄek\n\nAnn. Geophys., 36, 793–808, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-793-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-793-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a comprehensive statistical analysis of mirror mode waves and the properties of their plasma surroundings in sheath regions driven by interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) to deepen our understanding of these geo-effective plasma environments. The results imply that mirror modes are common structures in ICME sheaths and occur almost exclusively as dip-like structures and in mirror stable stable plasma.\n\nRadiative effects of ozone waves on the Northern Hemisphere polar vortex and its modulation by the QBO\n\nVered Silverman, Nili Harnik, Katja Matthes, Sandro W. Lubis, and Sebastian Wahl\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 6637–6659, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6637-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6637-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provides a quantified and mechanistic understanding of the radiative effects of ozone waves on the NH stratosphere. In particular, we find these effects to influence the seasonal evolution of the midlatitude QBO signal (HoltonâTan effect), which is important for getting realistic dynamical interactions in climate models. We also provide a synoptic view on the evolution of the seasonal development of the HoltonâTan effect by looking at the life cycle of upward-propagating waves.\n\nMiddle atmospheric ozone, nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen trioxide inÂ 2002â2011: SD-WACCM simulations compared to GOMOS observations\n\nErkki KyrÃ¶lÃ¤, Monika E. Andersson, Pekka T. Verronen, Marko Laine, Simo Tukiainen, and Daniel R. Marsh\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 5001–5019, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5001-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-5001-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work we compare three key constituents of the middle atmosphere (ozone, NO2, and NO3) from the GOMOS satellite instrument with the WACCM model. We find that in the stratosphere (below 50 km) ozone differences are very small, but in the mesosphere large deviations are found. GOMOS and WACCM NO2 agree reasonably well except in the polar areas. These differences can be connected to the solar particle storms. For NO3, WACCM results agree with GOMOS with a very high correlation.\n\nAn initial ULF wave index derived from 2 years of Swarm observations\n\nConstantinos Papadimitriou, Georgios Balasis, Ioannis A. Daglis, and Omiros Giannakis\n\nAnn. Geophys., 36, 287–299, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-287-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-36-287-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSwarm is the fourth Earth Explorer mission of the European Space Agency (ESA), launched on 23 November 2013. The mission provides an opportunity for better knowledge of the near-Earth electromagnetic environment. This study presents an initial attempt to derive an ultra low-frequency (ULF) wave index from low-Earth orbit satellite data. The technique can be potentially used to define a new product from the mission, the Swarm ULF wave index, which would be suitable for space weather applications.\n\nStatistical analysis of severe magnetic fluctuations in the near-Earth plasma sheet observed by THEMIS-E\n\nHeqiucen Xu, Kazuo Shiokawa, and Dennis FrÃ¼hauff\n\nAnn. Geophys., 35, 1131–1142, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-35-1131-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-35-1131-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we statistically analyzed severe magnetic fluctuations in the nightside near-Earth plasma sheet. For the first time, we showed the occurrence rates of these fluctuations. The superposed epoch analysis also indicated that the flow speed increases before the severe magnetic fluctuations. We also discussed how both the inside-out and outside-in substorm models can be used to explain these observed results.\n\nComparison of global datasets of sodium densities in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere from GOMOS, SCIAMACHY and OSIRIS measurements and WACCM model simulations from 2008 to 2012\n\nMartin P. Langowski, Christian von Savigny, John P. Burrows, Didier Fussen, Erin C. M. Dawkins, Wuhu Feng, John M. C. Plane, and Daniel R. Marsh\n\nAtmos. Meas.

However, the total metal influx rate is not well known. Global Na datasets from measurements and a model are available, which had not been compared yet on a global scale until this paper. Overall the agreement is good, and many differences between measurements are also found in the model simulations. However, the modeled layer altitude is too low.\n\nSolar forcing for CMIP6 (v3.2)\n\nKatja Matthes, Bernd Funke, Monika E. Andersson, Luke Barnard, JÃ¼rg Beer, Paul Charbonneau, Mark A.

This dataset provides the radiative and particle input of solar variability on a daily basis from 1850 through to 2300. With this dataset a better representation of natural climate variability with respect to the output of the Sun is provided which provides the most sophisticated and comprehensive respresentation of solar variability that has been used in climate model simulations so far.\n\nWave modulation of the extratropical tropopause inversion layer\n\nRobin Pilch Kedzierski, Katja Matthes, and Karl Bumke\n\nAtmos.

The events were classified as young or mature and regular or spontaneous hot flow anomalies (SHFAs). HFA–SHFA occurrence decreases with distance upstream from the bow shock. HFAs are more prevalent for radial interplanetary magnetic fields and solar wind speeds from 550 to 600 kms−1.\n\nHEPPA-II modelâmeasurement intercomparison project: EPP indirect effects during the dynamically perturbed NH winter 2008–2009\n\nBernd Funke, William Ball, Stefan Bender, Angela Gardini, V.

Models are capable to reproduce the EPP IE in dynamically and geomagnetically quiescent NH winter conditions. The results emphasize the need for model improvements in the dynamical representation of elevated stratopause events.\n\nHow does downward planetary wave coupling affect polar stratospheric ozone in the Arctic winter stratosphere?\n\nSandro W. Lubis, Vered Silverman, Katja Matthes, Nili Harnik, Nour-Eddine Omrani, and Sebastian Wahl\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The results presented here broaden the scope of the impact of wave–mean flow interaction on stratospheric ozone by highlighting the key role of wave reflection.\n\nDetermination of the atmospheric lifetime and global warming potential of sulfur hexafluoride using a three-dimensional model\n\nTamÃ¡s KovÃ¡cs, Wuhu Feng, Anna Totterdill, John M.

Chipperfield\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 883–898, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-883-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-883-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is a very potent greenhouse gas, which is present in the atmosphere only through its industrial use, for example as an electrical insulator. To estimate accurately the impact of SF6 emissions on climate we need to know how long it persists in the atmosphere before being removed. Previous estimates of the SF6 lifetime indicate a large degree of uncertainty. Here we use a detailed atmospheric model to calculate a current best estimate of the SF6 lifetime.\n\nHow can we understand the global distribution of the solar cycle signal on the Earth's surface?\n\nKunihiko Kodera, RÃ©mi ThiÃ©blemont, Seiji Yukimoto, and Katja Matthes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 12925–12944, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-12925-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-12925-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe spatial structure of the solar cycle signals on the Earth's surface is analysed to identify the mechanisms. Both tropical and extratropical solar surface signals can result from circulation changes in the upper stratosphere through (i) a downward migration of wave zonal mean flow interactions and (ii) changes in the stratospheric mean meridional circulation. Amplification of the solar signal also occurs through interaction with the ocean.\n\nThe Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIPÂ v1.0) contribution to CMIP6\n\nNathan P. Gillett, Hideo Shiogama, Bernd Funke, Gabriele Hegerl, Reto Knutti, Katja Matthes, Benjamin D. Santer, Daithi Stone, and Claudia Tebaldi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 9, 3685–3697, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3685-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3685-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetection and attribution of climate change is the process of determining the causes of observed climate changes, which has underpinned key conclusions on the role of human influence on climate in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This paper describes a coordinated set of climate model experiments that will form part of the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and will support improved attribution of climate change in the next IPCC report.\n\nThe tropical tropopause inversion layer: variability and modulation by equatorial waves\n\nRobin Pilch Kedzierski, Katja Matthes, and Karl Bumke\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 11617–11633, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-11617-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-11617-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provides a detailed overview of the daily variability of the tropopause inversion layer (TIL) in the tropics, where TIL research had focused little. The vertical and horizontal structures of this atmospheric layer are described and linked to near-tropopause horizontal wind divergence, the QBO and especially to equatorial waves. Our results increase the knowledge about the observed properties of the tropical TIL, mainly using satellite GPS radio-occultation measurements.\n\nD-region ionâneutral coupled chemistry (SodankylÃ¤ Ion Chemistry, SIC) within the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM 4) â WACCM-SIC and WACCM-rSIC\n\nTamÃ¡s KovÃ¡cs, John M. C. Plane, Wuhu Feng, Tibor Nagy, Martyn P. Chipperfield, Pekka T. Verronen, Monika E. Andersson, David A. Newnham, Mark A. Clilverd, and Daniel R. Marsh\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 9, 3123–3136, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3123-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3123-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study was completed on D-region atmospheric model development. The sophisticated 3-D Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and the 1-D Sodynkal&auml Ion and Neutral Chemistry Model (SIC) were combined in order to provide a detailed, accurate model (WACCM-SIC) that considers the processes taking place in solar proton events. The original SIC model was reduced by mechanism reduction, which provided an accurate sub-mechanism (rSIC, WACCM-rSIC) of the original model.\n\nThe representation of solar cycle signals in stratospheric ozone â PartÂ 1: A comparison of recently updated satellite observations\n\nAmanda C. Maycock, Katja Matthes, Susann Tegtmeier, RÃ©mi ThiÃ©blemont, and Lon Hood\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 10021–10043, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-10021-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-10021-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of changes in incoming solar radiation on stratospheric ozone has important impacts on the atmosphere. Understanding this ozone response is crucial for constraining how solar activity affects climate. This study analyses the solar ozone response (SOR) in satellite datasets and shows that there are substantial differences in the magnitude and spatial structure across different records. In particular, the SOR in the new SAGE v7.0 mixing ratio data is smaller than in the previous v6.2.\n\nValidation of COSMIC water vapor data in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere using MLS, MERRA and ERA-Interim\n\nMing Shangguan, Katja Matthes, Wuke Wang, and Tae-Kwon Wee\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2016-248,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2016-248, 2016\n\nRevised manuscript has not been submitted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA first validation of the COSMIC Radio Occultation (RO) water vapor data in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) are presented in this paper. The COSMIC water vapor shows a good agreement with the Microwave limb Sounder (MLS) in both the spatial distribution and the seasonal to interannual variations. It is very valuable for studying the water vapor in the UTLS, thanks to its global coverage, all- weather aptitude and high vertical resolution.\n\nRepresentation of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1) CAM4-chem within the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI)\n\nSimone Tilmes, Jean-Francois Lamarque, Louisa K.

Specifics of the model and details regarding the setup of the simulations are described. In additions, the main behavior of the model, including selected chemical species have been evaluated with climatological datasets. This paper is therefore a references for studies that use the provided model results.\n\nAtmospheric changes caused by galactic cosmic rays over the period 1960â2010\n\nCharles H. Jackman, Daniel R. Marsh, Douglas E. Kinnison, Christopher J. Mertens, and Eric L. Fleming\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 5853–5866, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-5853-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-5853-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwo global models were used to investigate the impact of galactic cosmic ray (GCRs) on the atmosphere over the 1960-2010 time period. The primary impact of the naturally occurring GCRs on ozone was found to be due to their production of NOx and this impact varies with the atmospheric chlorine loading, sulfate aerosol loading, and solar cycle variation. GCR-caused decreases of annual average global total ozone were computed to be 0.2â¯% or less.\n\nPlanar magnetic structures in coronal mass ejection-driven sheath regions\n\nErika Palmerio, Emilia K. J. Kilpua, and Neel P. Savani\n\nAnn. Geophys., 34, 313–322, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-34-313-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-34-313-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are giant clouds of plasma and magnetic field that erupt from the Sun and travel though the solar wind. They can cause interplanetary shocks in the vicinity of Earth. We show in our paper that the region that follows CME-driven shocks, known as sheath region, can obtain a planar configuration of the magnetic field lines (planar magnetic structure, PMS) due to the compression resulting from the shock itself or from the draping of the magnetic field ahead of the CME.\n\nModeling of ion dynamics in the inner geospace during enhanced magnetospheric activity\n\nC.

Georgiou, I. A. Daglis, E. Zesta, G. Balasis, I. R. Mann, C. Katsavrias, and K. Tsinganos\n\nAnn. Geophys., 33, 1431–1442, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-33-1431-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-33-1431-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study demonstrates a remarkable association between the earthward penetration of ULF waves and radiation belt electron enhancements during four magnetic storms that occurred in 2001. In the past, ULF waves had been observed at unusual depths during rare superstorms. But ULF wave activity, reaching magnetic shells as low as 2, was also observed during relatively intense storms when it played a key role in diffusing electrons radially inward and thereby accelerating them to higher energies.\n\nDefining and resolving current systems in geospace\n\nN.

It is very difficult to identify local measurements as belonging to a specific current system. Therefore, there are different definitions of supposedly the same current, leading to unnecessary controversy. This study presents a robust collection of these definitions of current systems in geospace, particularly in the near-Earth nightside magnetosphere, as viewed from a variety of observational and computational analysis techniques.\n\nMulti-satellite study of the excitation of Pc3 and Pc4-5 ULF waves and their penetration across the plasmapause during the 2003 Halloween superstorm\n\nG.

Zharkova and O. Khabarova\n\nAnn. Geophys., 33, 457–470, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-33-457-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-33-457-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we present further observations of the solar-wind particles being accelerated to rather higher energies while passing through the HCS or a current sheet formed at the front of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection. This additional acceleration can explain the anticorrelation of ion and electron fluxes frequently observed around the ICMEâs leading front. This acceleration can also provide a plausible explanation of the appearance of bidirectional strahls.\n\nDipolarization fronts in the near-Earth space and substorm dynamics\n\nI. I. Vogiatzis, A. Isavnin, Q.-G. Zong, E. T. Sarris, S. W. Lu, and A. M. Tian\n\nAnn. Geophys., 33, 63–74, https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-33-63-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-33-63-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMagnetospheric substorms are one of the most important phenomena occurring in planetary magnetotails, dynamically reconfiguring the near- planet space environment. They encompass various fundamental processes of plasma acceleration and transport in the magnetosphere/ionosphere. The key features of the paper are a new magnetospheric substorm model, a new explanation about the origin of dipolarization fronts (DFs), and a new explanation for energetic ion acceleration/injection in front of DFs.\n\nGlobal investigation of the Mg atom and ion layers using SCIAMACHY/Envisat observations between 70 and 150 km altitude and WACCM-Mg model results\n\nM.

These are retrieved from SCIAMACHY/Envisat satellite grating spectrometer measurements in limb viewing geometry between 2008 and 2012. These were compared with WACCM-Mg model results and a large fraction of the available measurement results for these species, and an interpretation of the results is done. The variation of these species during NLC presence is discussed.\n\nAnalysis of double-step response to an interplanetary shock in the dayside magnetosphere\n\nK. AndrÃ©eovÃ¡, L. Juusola, E. K. J.
