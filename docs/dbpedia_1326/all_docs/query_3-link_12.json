        "text": "Digital Chicane achieved a milestone victory at the Lone Star Grand Prix, the fifth round of the 2024 VSCA SportsCar Championship held at Circuit of the Americas (COTA) in Austin, Texas. The #93 Ferrari 296 GT3, driven by Ryan Koprowski and Kyle Loh, emerged victorious in the 2-hour and 40-minute race on Saturday. This win marks the first-ever triumph for Digital Chicane in the VSCA.\n\nThe challenging 3.427-mile, 20-turn track saw intense competition, with a pivotal full-course yellow occurring just over 40 minutes before the end. The race restarted with just over ten minutes remaining, leading to a wild sprint to the finish. The #93 Ferrari led for 64 laps and secured victory with a 14.791-second lead.\n\nA Stellar Performance by Digital Chicane\n\nKyle Loh, in his third VSCA start, delivered an exceptional qualifying performance, earning pole position with a lap time of 2:07.501. This marked the third consecutive pole for the #93 Ferrari. Despite the pressure of a late-race restart, the drivers maintained their composure to claim a historic win.\n\n\"I'm so stoked to finally win with Digital Chicane! We knew we had the potential to perform well ever since my first event with them, and to see our hard work finally pay off reminds us of why we love this sport so much,\" said Loh. Team manager and co-driver Ryan Koprowski, in his eighth VSCA start, emphasized the team's preparedness and determination to maintain their upward momentum.\n\nTop Contenders and Standout Performances\n\nThe GT AM championship leader, the #5 Screeching Moose Motorsports Mercedes AMG GT3, finished second, driven by Sean Hatfield and Lukas Santos. This marked their first race without a win after five consecutive victories. The #119 Trading Paints Racing Ferrari, driven by Julia Cervone and Tyler Tucker, secured third place, followed by the #33 Mayer Simspeed Performance Mercedes in fourth, achieving their best result of the season.\n\nOther notable finishes included the #161 MMTQ Racing Ferrari in fifth, driven by Michiel de Zeeuw and Max Baaijen, and the #34 Mayer Simspeed Performance Mercedes in sixth, piloted by Aaron Beaver and Will Robertson. The #94 Full Send Racing Mercedes, with drivers David Sluiter and Carl Felver, achieved their best result since February, finishing seventh.\n\nLooking Ahead: The 6 Hours of the Glen\n\nWith the Lone Star Grand Prix concluded, teams now shift their focus to the 6 Hours of the Glen at Watkins Glen on June 15th, 2024. This event, part of the VSCA Endurance Cup, promises another exciting chapter in the championship. Digital Chicane aims to build on their success and close the gap in the standings.\n\n\"We are going to keep our heads down as we prep for the 6 Hour over the next month or so to ensure we put ourselves in as best of a spot as possible to continue our upward momentum,\" said Koprowski. The upcoming race will be broadcast live on GreenFlag TV, offering fans a chance to witness the ongoing battle for supremacy in the 2024 VSCA SportsCar Championship.\n\nRelated Links"
