        "text": "We present JWST near- and mid-infrared spectroscopic observations of the nearby normal Type Ia supernova SN 2021aefx in the nebular phase at $+255$ days past maximum light. Our Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) observations, combined with ground-based optical data from the South African Large Telescope (SALT), constitute the first complete optical $+$ NIR $+$ MIR nebular SN Ia spectrum covering 0.3$-$14 $\\mu$m. This spectrum unveils the previously unobserved 2.5$-$5 $\\mu$m region, revealing strong nebular iron and stable nickel emission, indicative of high-density burning that can constrain the progenitor mass. The data show a significant improvement in sensitivity and resolution compared to previous Spitzer MIR data. We identify numerous NIR and MIR nebular emission lines from iron-group elements and as well as lines from the intermediate-mass element argon. The argon lines extend to higher velocities than the iron-group elements, suggesting stratified ejecta that are a hallmark of delayed-detonation or double-detonation SN Ia models. We present fits to simple geometric line profiles to features beyond 1.2 $\\mu$m and find that most lines are consistent with Gaussian or spherical emission distributions, while the [Ar III] 8.99 $\\mu$m line has a distinctively flat-topped profile indicating a thick spherical shell of emission. Using our line profile fits, we investigate the emissivity structure of SN 2021aefx and measure kinematic properties. Continued observations of SN 2021aefx and other SNe Ia with JWST will be transformative to the study of SN Ia composition, ionization structure, density, and temperature, and will provide important constraints on SN Ia progenitor and explosion models.\n\nWe conducted a Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observation of the low mass active galactic nucleus (AGN) in galaxy NGC 4293 ($z=0.003$). The object is associated with a low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER). Its black hole mass is estimated as $\\sim10^5$ or $\\sim10^7 M_\\odot$. The VLBA 1.5 GHz image shows an inverse symmetric structure with two discrete radio blobs separated by an angular distance of $\\sim120$ mas, corresponding to $\\sim7$ parsec. Furthermore, its integrated radio spectrum has a turnover at the frequency of $\\sim0.44$ GHz. Based on the compactness and spectrum, the nuclear radio source in NGC 4293 belongs to a sample of (megahertz) peaked spectrum (PS/MPS) radio sources with compact symmetric morphologies. NGC 4293 has 1.4 GHz radio power of only $\\sim10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,Hz^{-1}}$ with the VLBA observation, which is consistent with local AGNs but lower than the current PS samples. One of the two blobs has a steep radio spectrum $\\alpha=-0.62\\pm0.08$ ($S_\\nu\\propto\\nu^{+\\alpha}$), while the other one has an inverted spectrum $\\alpha=0.32\\pm0.10$. The VLBA 1.5 GHz luminosity ratio of the two blobs is 3.23 and both blobs show lateral-flowing structures where the hotspots reside at the edge of each radio lobe. This can be explained as jet interactions with dense circumnuclear medium. We estimate the black hole mass of NGC 4293 through the fundamental plane of black hole activity, which constrains the black hole mass to be $\\lesssim10^6 M_\\odot$. It supports that the object is a low-mass AGN and a potential candidate for accreting and ejecting IMBHs.\n\nObservational searches for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $10^2 - 10^6$ $M_\\odot$) include relatively isolated dwarf galaxies. For those that host active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the IMBH nature may be discerned through the accretion - jet activity. We present radio observations of four AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies (which potentially harbor IMBHs). Very large array (VLA) observations indicate steep spectra (indices of $-$0.63 to $-$1.05) between 1.4 and 9 GHz. A comparison with the 9 GHz in-band spectral index however shows a steepening for GH047 and GH158 (implying older/relic emission) and flattening for GH106 and GH163 (implying recent activity). Overlapping emission regions in the VLA 1.4 GHz and our very long baseline array (VLBA) 1.5 GHz observations, and possibly symmetric pc-scale extensions are consistent with recent activity in the latter two. Using the compact VLBA radio luminosity, X-ray luminosity (probing the accretion activity) and the black hole masses, all AGNs are found to lie on the empirical fundamental plane relation. The four AGN are radio quiet with relatively higher Eddington ratios ($0.04 - 0.32$) and resemble the X-ray binaries during spectral state transitions that entail an outflow ejection. Furthermore, the radio to X-ray luminosity ratio $\\log{R_\\mathrm{X}}$ of $-3.9$ to $-5.6$ in these four sources support the scenarios including corona mass ejection from accretion disk and wind activity. The growth to kpc-scales likely proceeds along a trajectory similar to young AGNs and peaked spectrum sources. The above complex clues can thus aid in the detection and monitoring of IMBHs in the nearby Universe.\n\nParticles of various sizes can exist around Mars. The orbits of large particles are mainly governed by Martian gravity, while those of small particles could be significantly affected by non-gravitational forces. Many of the previous studies of particle dynamics around Mars have focused on relatively small particles (radius of $r_{\\rm p} \\lesssim 100 \\, \\mu m$) for $\\lesssim 10^{4}$ years. In this paper, using direct numerical orbital integration and analytical approaches, we consider Martian gravity, Martian $J_{2}$, the solar radiation pressure (SRP) and the Poynting-Robertson (PR) force to study the giga-year dynamical evolution of particles orbiting near the Martian equatorial plane with radius ranging from micrometer to meter. We also newly study the effect of the planetary shadow upon the particle dynamics. Our results show that small particles ($r_{\\rm p} \\lesssim 10 \\, \\mu m$) initially at $\\lesssim 8$ Martian radii (below the orbit of today's Deimos) are quickly removed by the SRP due to eccentricity increase, resulting in a collision with Mars at the pericenter distnace. The orbits of larger particles ($r_{\\rm p} > 10 \\, \\mu m$) slowly decay due to the PR forces (timescale of $> 10^{4}$ years). The planetary shadow reduces the sunlit area in the orbit and thus the efficiency of the PR drag force is reduced. However, we show that, even including the planetary shadow, particles up to $\\sim 10$ cm in radius, initially at $\\lesssim 8$ Martian radii, eventually spiral onto the Martian surface within $\\sim 10^{9}$ years. Smaller particles require less time to reach Mars, and vice versa. Our results would be important to better understand and constrain the nature of the remaining particle around Mars in a context of giant impact hypothesis for the formation of Phobos and Deimos.\n\nUltra-high energy cosmic neutrinos from gamma-ray burstsBased on recent proposal to associate IceCube TeV and PeV neutrino events with gamma-ray bursts~(GRBs) by considering the Lorentz violation of neutrinos, we provide a new estimate on the GRB neutrino flux and such result is much bigger than previous results by the IceCube Collaboration. Among these 24 neutrino ``shower\" events above 60~TeV, 12 events are associated with GRBs. Such result is comparable with the prediction from GRB fireball models. Analysis of track events provide consistent result with the shower events to associate high energy cosmic neutrinos with GRBs under the same Lorentz violation features of neutrinos. We also make a background estimation and reveal GRBs as a significant source for the ultra-high energy IceCube neutrino events. Our work supports the Lorentz violation and $CPT$-violation of neutrinos, indicating new physics beyond relativity.\n\nX-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs) are those that exhibit two pairs of unaligned radio lobes (main radio lobes and \"wings\"), one of the promising models for the peculiar morphology is jet re-orientation. To clarify it, we conducted the European VLBI Network (EVN) 5 GHz observation of an XRG J0725+5835, which resembles the archetypal binary AGNs 0402+379 in radio morphology but it is larger in angular size. In our observation, two milliarcsec (mas) scale radio components with non-thermal radio emission are detected, each of them coincides with an optical counterpart with similar photometric redshift and (optical and infrared) magnitude, corresponding to dual active nuclei. Furthermore, with the improved VLA images, we find a bridge between the two radio cores and a jet bending in the region surrounding the companion galaxy, which further supports the interplay between the main and companion galaxies. In addition, we also report the discovery of an arcsec-scale jet in the companion. Given the projected separation of $\\sim100$ kpc between the main and companion galaxies, XRG J0725+5835 is likely associated with a dual jetted-AGN system. In both EVN and VLA observations, we find signatures that the jet is changing its direction, which is likely responsible for the X-shaped morphology. On the origin of jet re-orientation, several scenarios are discussed.\n\nThe Earth occultation technique has broad applications in both astronomy and atmospheric density measurements. We construct the background model during the occultation of the Crab Nebula observed by the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) at energies between 6 keV and 100 keV. We propose a Bayesian atmospheric density retrieval method based on the Earth occultation technique, combining Poisson and Gaussian statistics. By modeling the atmospheric attenuation of X-ray photons during the occultation, we simultaneously retrieved the neutral densities of the atmosphere at different altitude ranges. Our method considers the correlation of densities between neighboring atmospheric layers and reduces the potential systematic bias to which previous work may be subject. Previous analyses based on light curve fitting or spectral fitting also lost some spectral or temporal information of the data. In contrast to previous work, the occultation data observed by the three telescopes onboard Insight-HXMT is fully used in our analysis, further reducing the statistical error in density retrieval. We apply our method to cross-check the (semi-)empirical atmospheric models, using 115 sets of occultation data of the Crab Nebula observed by Insight-HXMT. We find that the retrieved neutral density is ~10%, ~20%, and ~25% less than the values of the widely used atmospheric model NRLMSISE-00, in the altitude range of 55--80 km, 80--90 km, and 90--100 km, respectively. We also show that the newly released atmospheric model NRLMSIS 2.0 is generally consistent with our density measurements.\n\nWe analyze stellar streams in action-angle coordinates combined with recent local direct acceleration measurements to provide joint constraints on the potential of our Galaxy. Our stream analysis uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence with a likelihood analysis based on the two-point correlation function. We provide joint constraints from pulsar accelerations and stellar streams for local and global parameters that describe the potential of the Milky Way (MW). Our goal is to build an ``acceleration ladder\", where direct acceleration measurements that are currently limited in dynamic range are combined with indirect techniques that can access a much larger volume of the MW. To constrain the MW potential with stellar streams, we consider the Palomar 5, Orphan, Nyx, Helmi and GD1 streams. Of the potential models that we have considered here, the preferred potential for the streams is a two-component Staeckel potential. We also compare the vertical accelerations from stellar streams and pulsar timing, defining a function $f(z) = \\alpha_{1pulsar}z - \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial z}$, where $\\Phi$ is the MW potential determined from stellar streams, and $\\alpha_{1~\\rm pulsar}z$ is the vertical acceleration determined from pulsar timing observations. Our analysis indicates that the Oort limit determined from streams is consistently (regardless of the choice of potential) lower than that determined from pulsar timing observations. The calibration we have derived here may be used to correct the estimate of the acceleration from stellar streams.\n\nWe analyse the quenched fractions, gas content, and star formation histories of ~1200 satellite galaxies with M* >= 5x10^6 Msun around 198 Milky Way- (MW) and Andromeda-like (M31) hosts in TNG50, the highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG simulations. Satellites exhibit larger quenched fractions for smaller masses, at smaller distances to their host galaxy, and in the more massive M31-like compared to MW-like hosts. As satellites cross their host's virial radius, their gas content drops significantly: most satellites within 300 kpc do not contain any detectable gas reservoirs at z=0, unless they are massive like the Magellanic Clouds and M32. Nevertheless, their stellar assembly exhibits a large degree of diversity. On average, the cumulative star formation histories of satellites are more extended for brighter, more massive satellites with a later infall, and for those in less massive hosts. Based on these relationships, we can even infer infall periods for observed MW and M31 dwarfs: e.g. 0-4 Gyr ago for the Magellanic Clouds and Leo I, 4-8 and 0-2 Gyr ago for M32 and IC 10, respectively. Ram pressure stripping (in combination with tidal stripping) deprives TNG50 satellites of their gas reservoirs and ultimately quenches their star formation activity, even though only a few per cent of the present-day satellites around the 198 TNG50 MW/M31-like hosts appear as jellyfish. The typical time since quenching for currently quenched TNG50 satellites is 6.9 (+2.5)(-3.3) Gyr ago. The TNG50 results are consistent with the quenched fractions and stellar assembly of observed MW and M31 satellites, however, satellites of the SAGA survey exhibit lower quenched fractions than TNG50 and other, observed analogues.\n\nMergers are thought to be a fundamental channel for galaxy growth, perturbing the gas dynamics and the magnetic fields (B-fields) in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the mechanisms that amplify and dissipate B-fields during a merger remain unclear. We characterize the morphology of the ordered B-fields in the multi-phase ISM of the closest merger of two spiral galaxies, the Antennae galaxies. We compare the inferred B-fields using $154~\\mu$m thermal dust and $11$ cm radio synchrotron emission polarimetric observations. We find that the $154~\\mu$m B-fields are more ordered across the Antennae galaxies than the $11$ cm B-fields. The turbulent-to-ordered $154~\\mu$m B-field increases at the galaxy cores and star-forming regions. The relic spiral arm has an ordered spiral $154~\\mu$m B-field, while the $11$ cm B-field is radial. The $154~\\mu$m B-field may be dominated by turbulent dynamos with high $^{12}$CO(1-0) velocity dispersion driven by star-forming regions, while the $11$ cm B-field is cospatial with high HI velocity dispersion driven by galaxy interaction. This result shows the dissociation between the warm gas mainly disturbed by the merger, and the dense gas still following the dynamics of the relic spiral arm. We find a $\\sim8.9$ kpc scale ordered B-field connecting the two galaxies. The base of the tidal tail is cospatial with the HI and $^{12}$CO(1-0) emission and has compressed and/or sheared $154~\\mu$m and $11$ cm B-fields driven by the merger. We suggest that amplify B-fields, with respect to the rest of the system and other spiral galaxies, may be supporting the gas flow between both galaxies and the tidal tail.\n\nRecent surveys have discovered a population of faint supernovae, known as Ca-rich gap transients, inferred to originate from explosive ignitions of white dwarfs. In addition to their unique spectra and luminosities, these supernovae have an unusual spatial distribution and are predominantly found at large distances from their presumed host galaxies. We show that the locations of Ca-rich gap transients are well matched to the distribution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding large galaxies, in accordance with a scenario where dark matter interactions induce thermonuclear explosions among low-mass white dwarfs that may be otherwise difficult to ignite with standard stellar or binary evolution mechanisms. A plausible candidate to explain the observed event rate are primordial black holes with masses above $10^{21}$ grams.\n\nUltraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are extreme X-ray binaries shining above 10^39 erg/s, in most cases as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion onto neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes accreting above their Eddington limit. This was understood after the discovery of coherent pulsations, cyclotron lines and powerful winds. The latter was possible thanks to the high-resolution X-ray spectrometers aboard XMM-Newton. ULX winds carry a huge amount of power owing to their relativistic speeds (0.1-0.3 c) and are able to significantly affect the surrounding medium, likely producing the observed 100 pc ULX superbubbles, and limit the amount of matter that can reach the central accretor. The study of ULX winds is therefore quintessential to understand 1) how much and how fast can matter be accreted by compact objects and 2) how strong is their feedback onto the surrounding medium. This is also relevant to understand supermassive black holes growth. Here we provide an overview on this phenomenology, highlight some recent, exciting results and show how future missions such as XRISM, eXTP and ATHENA will improve our understanding.\n\nThe long secondary period (LSP) phenomenon, which is commonly observed in pulsating red giants, has not been detected in any Mira yet. The goal of this paper is to verify, if there is a physical reason for this or if it is simply an observational bias. The OGLE-III Sample of Long Period Variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud, containing 1663 Miras, is used to perform a search for secondary periodicity in these objects and identify candidates for the long secondary period stars based on the location on the period-luminosity diagram. Out of 1663 Miras, 108 were identified as potential candidates, with variability broadly consistent with LSP. This makes 7% of the whole Mira sample in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Most, if not all of the Mira LSP candidates are C-rich stars. The results of this analysis suggest that Miras may exhibit long secondary periods. However, the long-term variability can also be related to period and amplitude irregularities that Miras are known to exhibit. Further study will be necessary to draw a definitive conclusion.\n\nA supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $\\sim 3\\times 10^6 \\, \\rm M_\\odot$ was recently detected via dynamical measurements at the center of the dwarf galaxy Leo I. Standing $\\sim 2$ orders of magnitude above standard scaling relations, this SMBH is hosted by a galaxy devoid of gas and with no significant star formation in the last $\\sim 1$ Gyr. This detection can profoundly impact the formation models for black holes and their hosts. We propose that winds from a population of $\\sim 100$ evolved stars within the Bondi radius of the SMBH produce a sizable accretion rate, with Eddington ratios between $9\\times10^{-8}$ and $9\\times10^{-7}$, depending on the value of the stellar mass loss. These rates are typical of SMBHs accreting in advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) mode. The predicted spectrum peaks in the microwaves at $\\sim 0.1-1$ THz ($300-3000 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) and exhibits significant variations at higher energies depending on the accretion rate. We predict a radio flux of $\\sim 0.1$ mJy at $6$ GHz, mildly dependent on the accretion properties. Deep imaging with Chandra, VLA, and ALMA can confirm the presence of this SMBH and constrain its accretion flow.\n\nWe analyze the physical properties of gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 132 Milky Way (MW)-like galaxies at $z=0$ from the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, part of the IllustrisTNG project. The properties and abundance of CGM gas across the sample are diverse, and the fractional budgets of different phases (cold, warm, and hot), as well as neutral HI mass and metal mass, vary considerably. Over our stellar mass range of $10.5 < \\rm{M}_\\star / \\rm{M}_\\odot < 10.9$, radial profiles of gas physical properties from $0.15 < \\rm{R/R_{\\rm 200c}} < 1.0$ reveal great CGM structural complexity, with significant variations both at fixed distance around individual galaxies, and across different galaxies. CGM gas is multi-phase: the distributions of density, temperature and entropy are all multimodal, while metallicity and thermal pressure distributions are unimodal; all are broad. We present predictions for magnetic fields in MW-like halos: a median field strength of $|B|\\sim\\,1\\mu$G in the inner halo decreases rapidly at larger distance, while magnetic pressure dominates over thermal pressure only within $\\sim0.2 \\times \\RVIR$. Virial temperature gas at $\\sim 10^6\\,$K coexists with a sub-dominant cool, $< 10^5\\,$K component in approximate pressure equilibrium. Finally, the physical properties of the CGM are tightly connected to the galactic star formation rate, in turn dependent on feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In TNG50, we find that energy from SMBH-driven kinetic winds generates high-velocity outflows ($\\gtrsim 2000$ km/s), heats gas to super-virial temperatures ($> 10^{6.5-7}$ K), and regulates the net balance of inflows versus outflows in otherwise quasi-static gaseous halos.\n\nWe review recent works on the dynamics of circumbinary accretion, including time variability, angular momentum transfer between the disk and the binary, and the secular evolution of accreting binaries. These dynamics can impact stellar binary formation/evolution, circumbinary planet formation/migration, and the evolution of (super)massive black-hole binaries. We discuss the dynamics and evolution of inclined/warped circumbinary disks and connect with recent observations of protoplanetary disks. A special kind of circumbinary accretion involves binaries embedded in \"big\" disks, which may contribute to the mergers of stellar-mass black holes in AGN disks. Highlights include: $\\bullet$ Circumbinary accretion is highly variable, being modulated at $P_{\\rm b}$ (the binary period) or $\\sim 5P_{\\rm p}$, depending on the binary eccentricity $e_{\\rm b}$ and mass ratio $q_{\\rm b}$. $\\bullet$ The inner region of the circumbinary disk can develop coherent eccentric structure, which may modulate the accretion and affect the physical processes (e.g. planet migration) taking place in the disk. $\\bullet$ Over long timescales, circumbinary accretion steers binaries toward equal masses, and it does not always lead to binary orbital decay, as is commonly assumed. The secular orbital evolution depends on the binary parameters ($e_{\\rm b}$ and $q_{\\rm b}$), and on the thermodynamic properties of the accreting gas. $\\bullet$ A misaligned disk around a low-eccentricity binary tends to evolve toward coplanarity due to viscous dissipation. But when $e_{\\rm b}$ is significant, the disk can evolve toward \"polar alignment\", with the disk plane perpendicular to the binary plane.\n\nWe present Korg, a new package for 1D LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) spectral synthesis of FGK stars, which computes theoretical spectra from the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and implements both plane-parallel and spherical radiative transfer. We outline the inputs and internals of Korg, and compare synthetic spectra from Korg, MOOG, Turbospectrum, and SME. The disagreements between Korg and the other codes are no larger than those between the other codes, although disagreement between codes is substantial. We examine the case of a C$_2$ band in detail, finding that uncertainties on physical inputs to spectral synthesis account for a significant fraction of the disagreement. Korg is 1-100 times faster than other codes in typical use, compatible with automatic differentiation libraries, and easily extensible, making it ideal for statistical inference and parameter estimation applied to large data sets. Documentation and installation instructions are available at https://ajwheeler.github.io/Korg.jl/stable/.\n\nThis paper explores the role of small-scale environment ($<1$ Mpc) in modulating accretion events onto supermassive black holes by studying the incidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in massive clusters of galaxies. A flexible, data-driven semi-empirical model is developed based on a minimal set of parameters and under the zero order assumption that the incidence of AGN in galaxies is independent of environment. This is used to predict how the fraction of X-ray selected AGN among galaxies in massive dark matter halos ($\\gtrsim 3\\times 10^{14}\\,M_{\\odot}$) evolves with redshift and reveal tensions with observations. At high redshift, $z\\sim1.2$, the model underpredicts AGN fractions, particularly at high X-ray luminosities, $L_X(\\rm 2-10\\,keV) \\gtrsim 10^{44}\\, erg \\, s^{-1}$. At low redshift, $z\\sim0.2$, the model estimates fractions of moderate luminosity AGN ($L_X(\\rm 2-10\\,keV) \\gtrsim 10^{43}\\, erg \\, s^{-1}$) that are a factor of $2-3$ higher than the observations. These findings reject the zero order assumption on which the semi-empirical model hinges and point to a strong and redshift-dependent influence of the small-scale environment on the growth of black holes. Cluster of galaxies appear to promote AGN activity relative to the model expectation at $z\\sim1.2$ and suppress it close to the present day. These trends could be explained by the increasing gas content of galaxies toward higher redshift combined with an efficient triggering of AGN at earlier times in galaxies that fall onto clusters.\n\nWe analyze the merger and assembly histories of Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-like galaxies to quantify how, and how often, disk galaxies of this mass can survive recent major mergers (stellar mass ratio $\\ge$ 1:4). For this, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198 analog galaxies, selected based on their $z=0$ stellar mass ($10^{10.5-11.2} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$), disky stellar morphology and local environment. Firstly, major mergers are common: 85 per cent (168) of MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50 have undergone at least one major merger across their lifetime. In fact, 31 galaxies (16 per cent) have undergone a recent major merger, i.e. in the last 5 Gyr. The gas available during the merger suffices to either induce starbursts at pericentric passages or to sustain prolonged star formation after coalescence: in roughly half of the cases, the pre-existing stellar disk is destroyed because of the merger but reforms thanks to star formation. Moreover, higher merger mass ratios are more likely to destroy the stellar disks. In comparison to those with more ancient massive mergers, MW/M31-like galaxies with recent major mergers have, on average, somewhat thicker stellar disks, more massive and somewhat shallower stellar haloes, larger stellar ex-situ mass fractions, but similarly massive kinematically-defined bulges. All this is qualitatively consistent with the different observed properties of the Galaxy and Andromeda and with the constraints on their most recent major mergers, 8-11 and ~2 Gyr ago, respectively. According to contemporary cosmological simulations, a recent quiet merger history is not a pre-requisite for obtaining a relatively-thin stellar disk at $z=0$.\n\nQuasar-galaxy pairs at small separations are important probes of gas flows in the disk-halo interface in galaxies. We study host galaxies of 198 MgII absorbers at $0.39\\le z_{abs}\\le1.05$ that show detectable nebular emission lines in the SDSS spectra. We report measurements of impact parameter (5.9$\\le D[kpc]\\le$16.9) and absolute B-band magnitude ($-18.7\\le {\\rm M_B}\\le -22.3$ mag) of host galaxies of 74 of these absorbers using multi-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey, more than doubling the number of known host galaxies with $D\\le17$ kpc. This has allowed us to quantify the relationship between MgII rest equivalent width($W_{2796}$) and D, with best-fit parameters of $W_{2796}(D=0) = 3.44\\pm 0.20$ Angstrom and an exponential scale length of 21.6$^{+2.41}_{-1.97}$ $kpc$. We find a significant anti-correlation between $M_B$ and D, and $M_B$ and $W_{2796}$, consistent with the brighter galaxies producing stronger MgII absorption. We use stacked images to detect average emissions from galaxies in the full sample. Using these images and stacked spectra, we derive the mean stellar mass ($9.4\\le log(M_*/M_\\odot) \\le 9.8$), star formation rate ($2.3\\le{\\rm SFR}[M_\\odot yr^{-1}] \\le 4.5$), age (2.5$-$4 Gyr), metallicity (12+log(O/H)$\\sim$8.3) and ionization parameter (log~q[cm s$^{-1}$]$\\sim$ 7.7) for these galaxies. The average $M_*$ found is less compared to those of MgII absorbers studied in the literature. The average SFR and metallicity inferred are consistent with that expected in the main sequence and the known stellar mass-metallicity relation, respectively. High spatial resolution follow-up spectroscopic and imaging observations of this sample are imperative for probing gas flows close to the star-forming regions of high-$z$ galaxies.\n\nWe present a rest-UV selected sample of 32 lensed galaxies at $z\\sim 2$ observed with joint Keck/LRIS rest-UV and Keck/MOSFIRE rest-optical spectra behind the clusters Abell 1689, MACS J0717, and MACS J1149. The sample pushes towards the faintest UV luminosities observed ($-19 \\le {\\rm M_{\\rm UV}} \\le -17$) at this redshift. The fraction of dwarf galaxies identified as Ly$\\alpha$ emitters ($\\rm EW \\ge 20\\ \\overset{\\lower.5em\\circ}{\\mathrm{A}}$) is ${\\rm X_{\\rm LAE}}=25^{+15}_{-10}\\%$. We use the Balmer lines and UV continuum to estimate the intrinsic EW allowing us to distinguish the effects of the ionizing spectra and Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction on the observed EW distribution. Fainter galaxies ($\\rm M_{\\rm UV} > -19$) show larger intrinsic EWs and escape fractions than brighter galaxies. Only galaxies with intrinsic EWs greater than 40$\\ \\overset{\\lower.5em\\circ}{\\mathrm{A}}$ have escape fractions larger than 0.05. We find an anti-correlation between the escape fraction and $\\rm A_V$ as well as UV spectral slope. The volumetric escape fraction of our sample is $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Ly\\alpha} = 4.59^{+2.0}_{-1.4}\\%$ in agreement with measurements found elsewhere in the literature. About half of the total integrated Ly$\\alpha$ luminosity density comes from galaxies with ${\\rm EW}_{\\rm obs}>20\\ \\overset{\\lower.5em\\circ}{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n\nSupermassive black-hole binaries are driven to merger by dynamical friction, loss-cone scattering of individual stars, disk migration, and gravitational-wave emission. Two main formation scenarios are expected. Binaries that form in gas-poor galactic environments do not experience disk migration and likely enter the gravitational-wave dominated phase with roughly isotropic spin orientations. Comparatively, binaries that evolve in gas-rich galactic environments might experience prominent phases of disk accretion, where the Bardeen-Petterson effect acts to align the spins of the black holes with the orbital angular momentum of the disk. However, if the accretion disk breaks alignment is expected to be strongly suppressed -- a phenomenon that was recently shown to occur in a large portion of the parameter space. In this paper, we develop a semi-analytic model of joint gas-driven migration and spin alignment of supermassive black-hole binaries taking into account the impact of disk breaking for the first time. Our model predicts the occurrence of distinct subpopulations of binaries, implying that future gravitational-wave observations of merging black holes could potentially be used to (i) discriminate between gas-rich and gas-poor hosts and (ii) constrain the dynamics of warped accretion disks.\n\nThe new capabilities that JWST offers in the near- and mid-infrared (IR) are used to investigate in unprecedented detail the nature of optical/near-IR faint, mid-IR bright sources, the so-called HST-dark galaxies among them. We gather JWST data from the CEERS survey in the EGS, jointly with HST data, to face this task by analyzing spatially resolved optical-to-mid-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to estimate both photometric redshifts and stellar populations properties in two dimensions. We select 138 galaxies with F150W-F356W>1.5 mag, F356W<27.5 mag, which include faint-to-dark HST galaxies (H>24 mag). The nature of these sources is threefold: (1) 71% are dusty star-forming galaxies at 2<z<6 with masses 9<log M/M_sun<11 and a variety of specific SFRs (<1 to >100 Gyr^-1); (2) 18% are quiescent/dormant (i.e., subject to reignition and rejuvenation) galaxies at 3<z<5, masses log M/M_sun~10 and post-starburst stellar mass-weighted ages (0.5-1 Gyr); and (3) 11% are strong young starbursts with indications of high-EW emission lines at 6<z<7 and log M/M_sun~9.5. Morphologically, the sample is biased towards disk-like galaxies with a remarkable compactness for XELG-z6 (effective radii smaller than 0.4 kpc). Large attenuations in SFGs, 2<A(V)<5 mag, are found within 1.5 times the effective radius, approximately 2 kpc. Our technique reproduces the expected dust emission luminosities of IR-bright and sub-millimeter galaxies. Our results imply high levels of star formation activity between z~20 and z~10, where virtually 100% of our galaxies had already formed 10^8 M_sun of their stellar content, 60% of them had assembled 10^9 M_sun, and 10% up to 10^10 M_sun (in situ or ex situ). (abridged)\n\nMachine learning (ML) models can greatly improve the search for strong gravitational lenses in imaging surveys by reducing the amount of human inspection required. In this work, we test the performance of supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning algorithms trained with the ResNetV2 neural network architecture on their ability to efficiently find strong gravitational lenses in the Deep Lens Survey (DLS). We use galaxy images from the survey, combined with simulated lensed sources, as labeled data in our training datasets. We find that models using semi-supervised learning along with data augmentations (transformations applied to an image during training, e.g., rotation) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) generated images yield the best performance. They offer 5--10 times better precision across all recall values compared to supervised algorithms. Applying the best performing models to the full 20 deg$^2$ DLS survey, we find 3 Grade-A lens candidates within the top 17 image predictions from the model. This increases to 9 Grade-A and 13 Grade-B candidates when $1$\\% ($\\sim2500$ images) of the model predictions are visually inspected. This is $\\gtrsim10\\times$ the sky density of lens candidates compared to current shallower wide-area surveys (such as the Dark Energy Survey), indicating a trove of lenses awaiting discovery in upcoming deeper all-sky surveys. These results suggest that pipelines tasked with finding strong lens systems can be highly efficient, minimizing human effort. We additionally report spectroscopic confirmation of the lensing nature of two Grade-A candidates identified by our model, further validating our methods.\n\nExtreme tidal disruption events (eTDEs), which occur when a star passes very close to a supermassive black hole, may provide a way to observe a long-sought general relativistic effect: orbits that wind several times around a black hole and then leave. Through general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, we show that such eTDEs are easily distinguished from most tidal disruptions, in which stars come close, but not so close, to the black hole. Following the stellar orbit, the debris in eTDEs is initially distributed in a crescent that quickly turns into tight spirals, from which some mass later falls back toward the black hole, while the remainder is ejected. Internal shocks within the infalling debris power the observed emission. The resulting light-curve rises rapidly to roughly the Eddington luminosity, maintains this level for between a few weeks and a year (depending on both the stellar mass and the black hole mass), and then drops. Most of its power is in thermal X-rays at a temperature $\\sim 10^{6}$ K ($\\sim 100$ eV). The debris evolution and observational features of eTDEs are qualitatively different from ordinary TDEs, making eTDEs a new type of TDE. Although eTDEs are relatively rare for lower-mass black holes, most tidal disruptions around higher-mass black holes are extreme. Their detection offers a view of an exotic relativistic phenomenon previously inaccessible.\n\nWe present a pilot, untargeted extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) emission-line survey using ALMACAL, a project utilizing ALMA calibration data for scientific purposes. In 33 deep (Texp > 40 min) ALMACAL fields we report six CO emission-line detections above S/N > 4, one-third confirmed by MUSE observations. With this pilot survey, we probe a cosmologically significant volume of ~10^5 cMpc^3, widely distributed over many pointings in the southern sky, making the survey largely insusceptible to the effects of cosmic variance. We derive the redshift probability of the CO detections using probability functions from the Shark semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. By assuming typical CO excitations for the detections, we put constraints on the cosmic molecular gas mass density evolution over the redshift range 0 < z < 1.5. The results of our pilot survey are consistent with the findings of other untargeted emission-line surveys and the theoretical model predictions and currently cannot rule out a non-evolving molecular gas mass density. Our study demonstrates the potential of using ALMA calibrator fields as a multi-sightline untargeted CO emission line survey. Applying this approach to the full ALMACAL database will provide an accurate, free of cosmic variance, measurement of the molecular luminosity function as a function of redshift.\n\nWe analyse the location of extremely metal-poor stars (EMPs, [Fe/H]$ < -3$) in 198 Milky Way (MW)/M31-like galaxies at $z=0$ in the TNG50 simulation. Each system is divided into four kinematically-defined morphological stellar components based on stellar circularity and galactocentric distance, namely bulge, cold disk, warm disk, and stellar halo, in addition to satellites (with stellar mass $\\ge 5\\times10^6\\,M_\\odot$). According to TNG50 and across all simulated systems, the stellar halo of the main galaxy and satellites present the highest frequency of EMPs (largest $M_{\\mathrm{EMP, comp}}$-to-$M_{\\mathrm{tot, comp}}$ stellar mass ratio), and thus the highest chances of finding them. Such frequency is larger in lower-mass than high-mass satellites. Moreover, TNG50 predicts that the stellar halo of the main galaxy always hosts and thus contributes the majority of the EMPs of the system. Namely, it has the highest mass ratio of EMPs in it to all the EMPs in the system (largest $M_{\\mathrm{EMP, comp}}$-to-$M_\\mathrm{EMP} (<300\\mathrm{kpc})$). However, notably, we also find that 33 MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50 have cold disks that contribute more than 10 per cent to the total EMP mass, each with $\\gtrsim 10^{6.5-7}\\, M_\\odot$ of EMPs in cold circular orbits. These qualitative statements do not depend on the precise definition of EMP stars, i.e. on the adopted metallicity threshold. The results of this work provide a theoretical prediction for the location of EMP stars from both a spatial and kinematic perspective and across an unprecedented number of well-resolved MW/M31-like systems.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to simulate the details of coronal heating and also make meaningful predictions of the emitted radiation. Thus, testing realistic models with observations is a major challenge. Observational signatures of coronal heating depend crucially on radiation, thermal conduction, and the exchange of mass and energy with the transition region and chromosphere below. Many magnetohydrodynamic simulation studies do not include these effects, opting instead to devote computational resources to the magnetic aspects of the problem. We have developed a simple method of accounting approximately for the missing effects. It is applied to the simulation output post facto and therefore may be a valuable tool for many studies. We have used it to predict the emission from a model corona that is driven by vortical boundary motions meant to represent photospheric convection. We find that individual magnetic strands experience short-term brightenings, both scattered throughout the computational volume and in localized clusters. The former may explain the diffuse component of the observed corona, while the latter may explain bright coronal loops. Several observed properties of loops are reproduced reasonably well: width, lifetime, and quasi-circular cross-section (aspect ratio not large). Our results lend support to the idea that loops are multi-stranded structures heated by \"storms\" of nanoflares.\n\nMany white dwarfs host disks of dust produced by disintegrating planetesimals and revealed by infrared excesses. The disk around G29-38 was the first to be discovered and is now well-observed, yet we lack a cohesive picture of its geometry and dust properties. Here we model the G29-38 disk for the first time using radiative transfer calculations that account for radial and vertical temperature and optical depth gradients. We arrive at a set of models that can match the available infrared measurements well, although they overpredict the width of the 10 $\\mu m$ silicate feature. The resulting set of models has a disk inner edge located at 92-100 $R_\\text{WD}$ (where $R_\\text{WD}$ is the white dwarf radius). This is farther from the star than inferred by previous modeling efforts due to the presence of a directly illuminated front edge to the disk. The radial width of the disk is narrow ($\\leq$10 $R_\\text{WD}$); such a feature could be explained by inefficient spreading or the proximity of the tidal disruption radius to the sublimation radius. The models have a half-opening angle of $\\geq$1.4$^\\circ$. Such structure would be in strong contradiction with the commonly employed flat-disk model analogous to the rings of Saturn, and in line with the vertical structure of main-sequence debris disks. Our results are consistent with the idea that disks are collisionally active and continuously fed with new material, rather than evolving passively after the disintegration of a single planetesimal.\n\nThe study of young associations is essential for building a complete record of local star formation processes. The Fornax-Horologium association (FH), including the $\\chi^1$ Fornacis cluster, represents one of the nearest young stellar populations to the Sun. This association has recently been linked to the Tuc-Hor, Carina, and Columba associations, building an extensive ``Austral Complex'' almost entirely within 150 pc. Using Gaia astrometry and photometry in addition to new spectroscopic observations, we perform the deepest survey of FH to date, identifying over 300 candidate members, nearly doubling the known population. By combining this sample with literature surveys of the other constituent populations, we produce a contiguous stellar population covering the entire Austral Complex, allowing the definitions of sub-populations to be re-assessed along with connections to external populations. This analysis recovers new definitions for FH, Tuc-Hor, Columba, and Carina, while also revealing a connection between the Austral complex and the Sco-Cen-affiliated Platais 8 cluster. This suggests that the Austral complex may be just a small component of a much larger and more diverse star formation event. Computing ages and tracing stellar populations back to formation reveals two distinct nodes of cospatial and continuous formation in the Austral Complex, one containing Tuc-Hor, and the other containing FH, Carina, and Columba. This mirrors recent work showing similar structure elsewhere, suggesting that these nodes, which only emerge through the use of traceback, may represent the clearest discrete unit of local star formation, and a key building block needed to reconstruct larger star-forming events.\n\nComplex organic molecules are only detected toward a fraction of high-mass protostars. The goal of this work is to investigate whether high-mass disks can explain the lack of methanol emission from some massive protostellar systems. We consider an envelope-only and an envelope-plus-disk model and use RADMC-3D to calculate the methanol emission. High and low millimeter (mm) opacity dust are considered for both models separately and the methanol abundance is parameterized. Viscous heating is included due to the high accretion rates of these objects in the disk. In contrast with low-mass protostars, the presence of a disk does not significantly affect the temperature structure and methanol emission. The shadowing effect of the disk is not as important for high-mass objects and the disk mid-plane is hot because of viscous heating, which is effective due to the high accretion rates. Consistent with observations of infrared absorption lines toward high-mass protostars, we find a vertical temperature inversion, i.e. higher temperatures in the disk mid-plane than the disk surface, at radii < 50au for the models with $L=10^4$ L$_{\\odot}$ and large mm opacity dust as long as the envelope mass is >550 M$_{\\odot}$. The large observed scatter in methanol emission from massive protostars can be mostly explained toward lower luminosity objects with the envelope-plus-disk models including low and high mm opacity dust. The methanol emission variation toward sources with high luminosities cannot be explained by models with or without a disk. However, the $L/M$ of these objects suggest that they could be associated with hypercompact/ultracompact HII regions. Therefore, the low methanol emission toward the high-luminosity sources can be explained by them hosting an HII region where methanol is absent.\n\nWe present deep Chandra observations of the pre-merger galaxy cluster Abell 98. Abell 98 is a complex merging system. While the northern (A98N) and central subclusters (A98S) are merging along the north-south direction, A98S is undergoing a separate late-stage merger, with two distinct X-ray cores. We report detection of gas sloshing spirals in A98N and in the eastern core of A98S. We detect two cold front edges in A98N. We find two more surface brightness edges along the east direction of the eastern core and west direction of the western core of A98S. We measure the temperatures and gas densities across those edges, and find that the eastern edge appears to be a cold front while the western edge is a shock front with a Mach number of $\\cal{M}$ $\\approx$ 1.5. We detect a \"tail\" of X-ray emission associated with the eastern core of A98S. Our measurement indicates that the tail is cooler than the surrounding gas at a 4.2-$\\sigma$ level, suggesting the tail is part of a cool core remnant that has been ram-pressure stripped.\n\nWe present ALMA dust polarization and molecular line observations toward 4 clumps (I(N), I, IV, and V) in the massive star-forming region NGC 6334. In conjunction with large-scale dust polarization and molecular line data from JCMT, Planck, and NANTEN2, we make a synergistic analysis of relative orientations between magnetic fields ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{B}}$), column density gradients ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{NG}}$), local gravity ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{LG}}$), and velocity gradients ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{VG}}$) to investigate the multi-scale (from $\\sim$30 pc to 0.003 pc) physical properties in NGC 6334. We find that the relative orientation between $\\theta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{NG}}$ changes from statistically more perpendicular to parallel as column density ($N_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$) increases, which is a signature of trans-to-sub-Alfv\\'{e}nic turbulence at complex/cloud scales as revealed by previous numerical studies. Because $\\theta_{\\mathrm{NG}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LG}}$ are preferentially aligned within the NGC 6334 cloud, we suggest that the more parallel alignment between $\\theta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{NG}}$ at higher $N_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$ is because the magnetic field line is dragged by gravity. At even higher $N_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$, the angle between $\\theta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{NG}}$ or $\\theta_{\\mathrm{LG}}$ transits back to having no preferred orientation or statistically slightly more perpendicular, suggesting that the magnetic field structure is impacted by star formation activities. A statistically more perpendicular alignment is found between $\\theta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{VG}}$ throughout our studied $N_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$ range, which indicates a trans-to-sub-Alfv\\'{e}nic state at small scales as well. The normalised mass-to-flux ratio derived from the polarization-intensity gradient (KTH) method increases with $N_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$.\n\nThe variability induced by precipitable water vapour (PWV) can heavily affect the accuracy of time-series photometric measurements gathered from the ground, especially in the near-infrared. We present here a novel method of modelling and mitigating this variability, as well as open-sourcing the developed tool -- Umbrella. In this study, we evaluate the extent to which the photometry in three common bandpasses (r', i', z'), and SPECULOOS' primary bandpass (I+z'), are photometrically affected by PWV variability. In this selection of bandpasses, the I+z' bandpass was found to be most sensitive to PWV variability, followed by z', i', and r'. The correction was evaluated on global light curves of nearby late M- and L-type stars observed by SPECULOOS' Southern Observatory (SSO) with the I+z' bandpass, using PWV measurements from the LHATPRO and local temperature/humidity sensors. A median reduction in RMS of 1.1% was observed for variability shorter than the expected transit duration for SSO's targets. On timescales longer than the expected transit duration, where long-term variability may be induced, a median reduction in RMS of 53.8% was observed for the same method of correction.\n\nExamination of emission lines in high-velocity resolution optical spectra of the Orion Nebula confirms that the velocity component on the red wing of the main ionization front emission line is due to backscattering in the Photon Dominated Region. This scattered light component has a weak wavelength dependence that is consistent with either general interstellar medium particles or particles in the foreground of the Orion Nebula Cluster. An anomalous line-broadening component that has been known for 60+ years is characterized in unprecedented detail. Although this extra broadening may be due to turbulence along the line-of-sight of our spectra, we explore the possibility that it is due to \\alf\\ waves in conditions where the ratio of magnetic and thermal energies are about equal and constant throughout the ionized gas.\n\nThe Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade (WSU) is the top priority initiative for the ALMA2030 Development Roadmap. The WSU will initially double, and eventually quadruple, ALMA's system bandwidth and will deliver improved sensitivity by upgrading the receivers, digital electronics and correlator. The WSU will afford significant improvements for every future ALMA observation, whether it is for continuum or spectral line science. The continuum imaging speed will increase by a factor of 3 for the 2x bandwidth upgrade, plus any gains from improved receiver temperatures. The spectral line imaging speed will improve by a factor of 2-3. The improvements provided by the WSU will be most dramatic for high spectral resolution observations, where the instantaneous bandwidth correlated at 0.1-0.2 km/s resolution will increase by 1-2 orders of magnitude in most receiver bands. The improved sensitivity and spectral tuning grasp will open new avenues of exploration and enable more efficient observations. The impact will span the vast array of topics that embodies ALMA's motto \"In Search of our Cosmic Origins\". The WSU will greatly expand the chemical inventory of protoplanetary disks, which will have profound implications for how and when planets form. Observations of the interstellar medium will measure a variety of molecular species to build large samples of clouds, cores and protostars. The WSU will also enable efficient surveys of galaxies at high redshift. The first elements of the WSU will be available later this decade, including a wideband Band 2 receiver, a wideband upgrade to Band 6, new digitizers and digital transmission system, and a new correlator. Other upgrades are under study, including the newly developed ACA spectrometer and upgrades to Bands 9 and 10. The gains enabled by the WSU will further enhance ALMA as the world leading facility for millimeter/submillimeter astronomy. [Abridged]\n\nWe present near-infrared (NIR) and optical observations of the Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) SN 2021krf obtained between days 13 and 259 at several ground-based telescopes. The NIR spectrum at day 68 exhibits a rising $K$-band continuum flux density longward of $\\sim 2.0 \\mu$m, which is likely from freshly formed dust in the SN ejecta. We estimate a carbon-grain dust mass of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and a dust temperature of $\\sim 900-1200$ K associated with this rising continuum and suggest the dust has formed in SN ejecta. Utilizing the one-dimensional multigroup radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA, we present two degenerate progenitor solutions for SN 2021krf, characterized by C-O star masses of 3.93 and 5.74 M$_{\\odot}$, but with the same best-fit $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.11 M$_{\\odot}$ for early times (0-70 days). At late times (70-300 days), optical light curves of SN 2021krf decline substantially more slowly than that expected from $^{56}$Co radioactive decay. A late-time optical spectrum on day 259 shows strong Ca II and [O I] ejecta lines from the SN. Lack of H and He lines in the late-time SN spectrum suggests the absence of significant interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar medium. We reproduce the entire bolometric light curve with a combination of radioactive decay and an additional powering source in the form of a central engine of a millisecond pulsar with a magnetic field smaller than that of a typical magnetar.\n\nThe Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF) is an enigmatic sedimentary unit near the equator of Mars, with an uncertain formation process and absolute age. Due to the heavily wind-eroded surface, it is difficult to determine the absolute model age of the MFF using a one-parameter model based on the crater size-frequency distribution function with existing crater count data. We create a new two-parameter model that estimates both age and a constant erosion rate ($\\beta$) by treating cratering as a random Poisson process. Our study uses new crater count data collected from Context Camera imagery for both the MFF and other young equatorial sedimentary rock. Based on our new model, the Central MFF formed $>$1.5 Gyr ago and had low erosion rates ($<$650 nm yr$^{-1}$), whereas the East MFF, Far East MFF, and Zephyria Planum most likely formed $<$1.5 Gyr ago and had higher erosion rates ($>$740 nm $^{-1}$). The top of Aeolis Mons (informally known as Mount Sharp) in Gale Crater and Eastern Candor have relatively young ages and low erosion rates. Based on the estimated erosion rates (since fast erosion permits metastable shallow ice), we also identify several sites, including Zephyria Planum, as plausible locations for shallow subsurface equatorial water ice that is detectable by gamma-ray spectroscopy or neutron spectroscopy. In addition to confirming $<$1.5 Gyr sedimentary rock formations on Mars, and distinguishing older and younger MFF sites, we find that fast-eroding locations have younger ages and MFF locations with slower erosion have older best-fit ages.\n\nUpcoming high-redshift observations of the anisotropic distribution of diffuse gas surrounding galaxy clusters, observed through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, will help distinguish between different astrophysical feedback models, account for baryons that appear to be `missing' from the cosmic census, and potentially be used as a cosmological probe. To glean information from these observations, a typical approach is to apply a halo-model-based gas prescription to dark matter simulations or analytic predictions. This study seeks to inform such prescriptions by analysing gas in The Three Hundred Gizmo-Simba hydrodynamic simulations, investigating whether gas beyond halos is a major contributor to the anisotropic tSZ signal. Various definitions are applied to separate concentrated gas from diffuse gas at redshift $z=1$, and the tSZ signals from each category across 98 simulation snapshots are combined through oriented stacking along the galaxy filament axis. The results vary significantly depending on the definition used for diffuse gas, indicating that care must be taken when discussing the fraction of cosmic gas in a diffuse state. In all cases, the diffuse gas is important, contributing up to $\\sim50\\%$ of the tSZ signal. The unbound gas existing at 1-2 virial radii from halo centres is especially key. Oriented stacking and environmental sub-selections help to amplify the signal from the warm-hot intergalactic medium, which is aligned but less concentrated along the galaxy filament axis than the hot halo gas.\n\nWe first present the multicolor photometry results of the rapidly rotating magnetic star HD 345439 using the Nanshan One-meter Wide-field Telescope. From the photometric observations, we derive a rotational period of 0.7699\\pm0.0014 day. The light curves of HD 345439 are dominated by the double asymmetric S-wave feature that arises from the magnetic clouds. Pulsating behaviors are not observed in Sector 41 of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. No evidence is found of the occurrence of centrifugal breakout events neither in the residual flux nor in the systematic variations at the extremum of the light curve. Based on the hypothesis of the Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model, we restrict the magnetic obliquity angle {$\\beta$} and the rotational inclination angle $i$ so that they satisfy the approximate relation {$\\beta + i \\approx 105^{\\circ}$}. The colour excess, extinction, and luminosity are determined to be $E_{(B-V)}=0.745\\pm0.016\\,$mag, $A_{V}=2.31\\pm0.05\\,$mag, and $\\rm log\\,(L/L_{\\odot})=3.82\\pm0.1 $dex, respectively. Furthermore, we derive the effective temperature as $T$$\\rm _{eff}=22\\pm1 $kK and the surface gravity as log$g=4.00\\pm0.22$. The mass$ M=7.24_{-1.24}^{+1.75}\\rm M_{\\odot}$, radius$ R=4.44_{-1.93}^{+2.68}\\rm R_{\\odot}$, and age$\\rm \\tau_{age}=23.62\\,_{-21.97}^{+4.24} $Myr are estimated from the Hertzsprung--Russell Diagram\n\nThe spectra of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars exhibit strong, broad emission lines that originate in the wind. These winds are radiatively driven and are susceptible to hydrodynamic instabilities that result in the formation of clumps. When modelling spectra of WR stars the volume-filling factor (VFF) approach is usually employed to treat clumpy winds. However, it is based on the assumption that the entire wind mass resides in optically thin clumps, which is not necessarily justifiable in dense winds. To test the validity of the VFF approach we use a previously described method of treating clumping, the ``Shell'' approach, to study line and continuum formation in the dense wind of the WN4 star, HD 50896. Our models indicate that fully intact spherical shells are in tension with observed spectra; a persistent ``dip'' in emission lines occurs at line centre. Removing this dip requires our models to use ``broken'' shells -- shells that are highly decoherent laterally. This insinuates that the wind of HD 50896, and by extension the winds of other WR stars, are comprised of small laterally confined and radially compressed clumps -- clumps smaller than the Sobolev length. We discuss some of the conditions necessary for the VFF approach to be valid.\n\nWe discuss a GC formation scenario in which the first generation (1G) of single asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and intermediate-mass close binaries (IMCBs) eject gas, from which the second generation (2G) of stars can be formed. The two key parameters in the scenario are the fractions of binary stars (f_b) and the slopes (alpha) of the stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) for 1G stars. Principle results derived by analytic and one-zone models of GC formation are as follows. The mass fraction of 2G stars (f_2g) can be higher than ~0.4 for alpha < 1.8 and is not so dependent on f_b. The ratio of the initial mass of a GC to the present-day mass (M_gc) ranges from 2 to 7 depending on alpha for 0.5 < f_b <0.9. The differences in [Na/Fe] between 1G and 2G stars can be as large as 0.7 for a wide range of model parameters. The Li abundances of 2G stars can be as high as those of 1G even if the pristine gas from IMCBs is assumed to be Li-free. Formation histories of 2G stars show at least two peaks owing to two peaks in the total ejection rate of gas from IMCB populations. The observed correlation between f_2g and M_gc can be due to alpha depending on M_gc. The hypothetical long duration of 2G formation (~ 10^8 yr) is possible, because massive star formation can be suppressed through frequent dynamical interaction between 1G stars and gas clouds.\n\nWe introduce the use of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) to speed up gravitational lensing ray tracing calculations. The method allows very fast calculation of ray deflections when a large number of deflectors, $N_*$, is involved, while keeping rigorous control on the errors. In particular, we apply this method, in combination with the Inverse Polygon Mapping technique (IPM), to quasar microlensing to generate microlensing magnification maps with very high workloads (high magnification, large size and/or high resolution) that require a very large number of deflectors. Using, FMM-IPM, the computation time can be reduced by a factor $\\sim 10^5$ with respect to standard Inverse Ray Shooting, making the use of this algorithm on a personal computer comparable to the use of standard IRS on GPUs. We also provide a flexible web interface for easy calculation of microlensing magnification maps using FMM-IPM\\footnote{this http URL}. We exemplify the power of this new method by applying it to some challenging interesting astrophysical scenarios, including clustered primordial black holes, or extremely magnified stars close to the giant arcs of galaxy clusters. We also show the performance/use of FMM to calculate ray deflection for a halo resulting from cosmological simulations composed by a large number ($N\\gtrsim 10^7$) of elements.\n\nA vital condition for life on Earth is the steady supply of radiative heat by the Sun. Like all other stars, the Sun generates its emitted energy in its central regions where densities and temperatures are high enough for nuclear fusion processes to take place. Because stellar cores are usually covered by an opaque envelope, most of our knowledge about them and their life-giving nuclear processes comes from theoretical modelling or from indirect observations such as the detection of solar neutrinos and the study of stellar pulsations, respectively. Only in very rare cases, stars may expose their cores, e.g., when a tiny fraction of them evolves into Wolf-Rayet or helium hot subdwarf stars. However, for the vast majority of stars, namely unevolved stars that burn hydrogen to helium in their centres, direct observational clues on the cores are still missing. Based on a comprehensive spectroscopic and asteroseismic analysis, we show here that the bright B-type star $\\gamma$ Columbae is the stripped pulsating core (with a mass of $4$-$5\\,M_\\odot$, where $M_\\odot$ is the mass of the Sun) of a previously much more massive star of roughly $12\\,M_\\odot$ that just finished central hydrogen fusion. The star's inferred parameters indicate that it is still in a short-lived post-stripping structural readjustment phase, making it an extremely rare object. The discovery of this unique star paves the way to obtain invaluable insights into the physics of both single and binary stars with respect to nuclear astrophysics and common-envelope evolution. In particular, it provides first observational constraints on the structure and evolution of stripped envelope stars.\n\nIn recent decades, large-scale sky surveys such as Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) have resulted in generation of tremendous amount of data. The classification of this enormous amount of data by astronomers is time consuming. To simplify this process, in 2007 a volunteer-based citizen science project called Galaxy Zoo was introduced, which has reduced the time for classification by a good extent. However, in this modern era of deep learning, automating this classification task is highly beneficial as it reduces the time for classification. For the last few years, many algorithms have been proposed which happen to do a phenomenal job in classifying galaxies into multiple classes. But all these algorithms tend to classify galaxies into less than six classes. However, after considering the minute information which we know about galaxies, it is necessary to classify galaxies into more than eight classes. In this study, a neural network model is proposed so as to classify SDSS data into 10 classes from an extended Hubble Tuning Fork. Great care is given to disc edge and disc face galaxies, distinguishing between a variety of substructures and minute features which are associated with each class. The proposed model consists of convolution layers to extract features making this method fully automatic. The achieved test accuracy is 84.73 per cent which happens to be promising after considering such minute details in classes. Along with convolution layers, the proposed model has three more layers responsible for classification, which makes the algorithm consume less time.\n\nIn the framework of the stochastic theory for hierarchical clustering, we investigate the time-dependent solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation describing the statistics of dark matter halos, and discuss the typical timescales needed for these to converge toward stationary states, far away enough from initial conditions. Although we show that the stationary solutions can reproduce the outcomes of state-of-the-art $N-$body simulations at $z\\approx 0$ to a great accuracy, one needs to go beyond to fully account for the cosmic evolution of the simulated halo mass function toward high-redshift. Specifically, we demonstrate that the time-dependent solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation can describe, for reasonable initial conditions, the non-universal evolution of the simulated halo mass functions. Compared to standard theoretical estimates, our stochastic theory predicts a halo number density higher by factor of several toward $z\\gtrsim 10$, an outcome which can be helpful in elucidating early and upcoming data from JWST. Finally, we point out the relevance of our approach in designing, interpreting and emulating present and future $N-$body experiments.\n\nFluorine has many different potential sites and channels of production, making narrowing down a dominant site of fluorine production particularly challenging. In this work, we investigate which sources are the dominant contributors to the galactic fluorine by comparing chemical evolution models to observations of fluorine abundances in Milky Way stars covering a metallicity range -2$<$[Fe/H]$<$0.4 and upper limits in the range -3.4$<$[Fe/H]$<$-2.3. In our models, we use a variety of stellar yield sets in order to explore the impact of varying both AGB and massive star yields on the chemical evolution of fluorine. In particular, we investigate different prescriptions for initial rotational velocity in massive stars as well as a metallicity dependent mix of rotational velocities. We find that the observed [F/O] and [F/Fe] abundance ratios at low metallicity and the increasing trend of [F/Ba] at [Fe/H]$\\gtrsim$-1 can only be reproduced by chemical evolution models assuming, at all metallicities, a contribution from rapidly rotating massive stars with initial rotational velocities as high as 300km s$^{-1}$. A mix of rotational velocities may provide a more physical solution than the sole use of massive stars with $v_{\\text{rot}}$=300$\\text{km s}^{-1}$, which are predicted to overestimate the fluorine and average s-process elemental abundances at [Fe/H]$\\gtrsim$-1. The contribution from AGB stars is predicted to start at [Fe/H]$\\approx$-1 and becomes increasingly important at high metallicity, being strictly coupled to the evolution of the nitrogen abundance. Finally, by using modern yield sets, we investigate the fluorine abundances of Wolf-Rayet winds, ruling them out as dominant contributors to the galactic fluorine.\n\nWe study the evolution of kinematically-defined stellar discs in 10 Fornax-like clusters identified in the TNG50 run from the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological simulations. We considered disc galaxies with present-day stellar mass $M_{\\star}\\geq 3 \\times 10^{8} M_{\\odot}$ and follow their evolution since first entering their host cluster. Very few stellar discs survive since falling in such dense environments, ranging from 40% surviving to all being disrupted. Such survival rates are consistent with what reported earlier for the two more massive, Virgo-like clusters in TNG50. In absolute terms, however, the low number of present-day disc galaxies in Fornax-like clusters could be at odds with the presence of three edge-on disc galaxies in the central regions of the actual Fornax cluster, as delineated by the Fornax3D survey. When looking at the Fornax analogues from random directions and with the same selection function of Fornax3D, the probability of finding three edge-on disc galaxies in any one Fornax-like cluster in TNG50 is rather low, albeit not impossible. We also compared the stellar-population properties near the equatorial plane derived from integral-field spectroscopy for the three edge-ons in Fornax to similar line-of-sight integrated values for present-day disc galaxies in TNG50. For one of these, the very old and metal-rich stellar population of its disc cannot be matched by any the disc galaxies in TNG50, including objects in the field. We discuss possible interpretations of these findings, while pointing to future studies on passive cluster spirals as a way to further test state-of-the-art cosmological simulations.\n\nWe propose a general framework leveraging the halo-galaxy connection to link galaxies observed at different redshift in a statistical way, and use the link to infer the redshift evolution of the galaxy population. Our tests based on hydrodynamic simulations show that our method can accurately recover the stellar mass assembly histories up to $z\\sim 3$ for present star-forming and quiescent galaxies down to $10^{10}h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$. Applying the method to observational data shows that the stellar mass evolution of the main progenitors of galaxies depends strongly on the properties of descendants, such as stellar mass, halo mass, and star formation states. Galaxies hosted by low-mass groups/halos at the present time have since $z\\sim 1.8$ grown their stellar mass $\\sim 2.5$ times as fast as those hosted by massive clusters. This dependence on host halo mass becomes much weaker for descendant galaxies with similar star formation states. Star-forming galaxies grow about 2-4 times faster than their quiescent counterparts since $z\\sim 1.8$. Both TNG and EAGLE simulations over-predict the progenitor stellar mass at $z>1$, particularly for low-mass descendants.\n\nRecent observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) by SH0ES collaboration (R11 and R16) diverge from the value reported by recent CMBR observations utilising the Planck satellite and application of the $\\Lambda CDM$ cosmological model by at least $3 \\sigma$. It is among the most challenging problems in contemporary cosmology and is known as the Hubble tension. The SNe Ia in R11 and R16 were calibrated through cepheid variables in three distinct galaxies: Milky Way, LMC, and NGC4258. Carnegie Hubble Program (CHP) observations of type Ia SNe calibrated using the tip of the red giant approach yielded a somewhat different estimate for the Hubble constant. This decreased the Hubble tension from over 3$\\sigma$ to below 2$\\sigma$. It is a legitimate question to answer whether there are any issues with SNe Ia calibration and to investigate whether the Hubble tension is real or not. We use statistical techniques namely, ANOVA, K-S test, and t-test to examine whether the cepheid calibration is host-dependent. Our analysis shows that (i) both R11 and R16 data suffer from non-Gaussian systematic effects, (ii) $H_0$ values in the sub-samples (different anchor-based) in both R11 and R16 groups are significantly different at a 99\\% confidence level, and (iii) neglecting the metal-rich MW sample does not reduce the $H_0$ value significantly, and thus Hubble tension persists. A small reduction in the Hubble constant could be linked to the differences in the host environment. Hence instead of using a single universal relation environment based slope and zero point should be preferred.\n\nThe continuous monitoring capability of Fermi-LAT has enabled the exploration of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in the $\\gamma$-ray light curve of blazar that has given a new perspective to probe these source and jet physics over a wide range of time scales. We report the presence of transient QPOs in the long-term $\\gamma$-ray light curve of blazars PKS 0244-470 \\& 4C +38.41. We first identified different flux states using the Bayesian Block algorithm and then explored the possible transient QPOs in the segments of each flux phase where the flux level changes over fairly regular intervals. Combining this with source intrinsic variance, we identified two flux phases for PKS 0244-470: one activity (AP-1) and one quiescent phase (QP-1). For 4C+38.41, we similarly identified four activity (AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4) and two quiescent (QP-1 and QP-2) phases. AP-1 phase of PKS 0244-470 shows QPO of $\\sim$ 225 days persisting for 8 cycles ($\\sim$ 4.1 $\\sigma$). In 4C+38.41, AP-1 and AP-2 phases show QPO of $\\sim$ 110 days and $\\sim$ 60 days, respectively, persisting for 5 cycles. In AP-3, we identified three sub-phases, and all show a $\\sim$ week scale recurrent rise with five complete cycles, while in QP-1, we could identify 2 sub-phases (Q1 and Q2). Q1 phase shows a significant period of $\\sim$ 104 days with six complete cycles. Q2 phase also shows significant QPO but with only $\\sim$ 3.7 cycles. All the detections are locally significant with at least four or more cycles. We discuss the possible origin and argue that the current driven kink instability and curved jet model seem the most likely cause for shorter and longer QPOs though the latter requires continuous acceleration or injection of particles to explain these.\n\nUnderstanding quenching mechanisms in low-mass galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy evolution overall. In particular, isolated galaxies are important tools to help disentangle the complex internal and external processes that impact star formation. Comparisons between quenched field and satellite galaxies in the low mass regime offer a substantial opportunity for discovery, although very few quenched galaxies with masses below $M_{\\star}$$\\sim$$10^{9} M_{\\odot}$ are known outside the virial radius, $R_{vir}$, of any host halo. Importantly, simulations and observations suggest that an in-between population of backsplash galaxies also exists that may complement interpretations of environmental quenching. Backsplash galaxies -- like field galaxies -- reside outside the virial radius of a host halo, but their star formation can be deeply impacted by previous interactions with more massive systems. In this paper, we report the discovery of a low-mass ($M_{\\star}$$\\sim$$10^{7} M_{\\odot}$) quenched galaxy approximately $1 R_{vir}$ in projection from the M81 group. We use surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) to investigate the possibility that the new galaxy, dubbed dw0910p7326 (nicknamed Blobby), is a backsplash galaxy or a more distant field galaxy. The measured SBF distance of $3.21\\substack{+0.15 +0.41 \\\\ -0.15 -0.36}$ Mpc indicates that Blobby likely lies between $1.0 < R/R_{vir} < 2.7$ outside the combined M81--M82 system. Given its distance and quiescence, Blobby is a good candidate for a backsplash galaxy and could provide hints about the formation and evolution of these interesting objects.\n\nWASP-96b is a hot Saturn exoplanet, with an equilibrium temperature well within the regime of thermodynamically expected extensive cloud formation. Prior observations with Hubble/WFC3, Spitzer/IRAC, and VLT/FORS2 have been combined into a single spectra for which retrievals suggest a cold but cloud-free atmosphere. Recently, the planet was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the Early Release Observations (ERO). 1D profiles are extracted from the 3D GCM expeRT/MITgcm results and used as input for a kinetic, non-equilibrium model to study the formation of mineral cloud particles of mixed composition. The ARCiS retrieval framework is applied to the pre-JWST WASP-96b transit spectra to investigate the apparent contradiction between cloudy models and assumed cloud-free transit spectra. Clouds are predicted to be ubiquitous throughout the atmosphere of WASP-96b. Silicate materials contribute between 40% and 90%, hence, also metal oxides contribute with up to 40% in the low-pressure regimes that effect the spectra. We explore how to match these cloudy models with currently available atmospheric transit spectra. A reduced vertical mixing acts to settle clouds to deeper in the atmosphere, and an increased cloud particles porosity reduces the opacity of clouds in the near-IR and optical region. Both these effects allow for clearer molecular features to be observed, while still allowing clouds to be in the atmosphere. The atmosphere of WASP-96b is unlikely to be cloud free. Also retrievals of HST, Spitzer and VLT spectra show that multiple cloudy solutions reproduce the data. JWST observations will be affected by clouds, where within even the NIRISS wavelength range the cloud top pressure varies by an order of magnitude. The long wavelength end of NIRSpec and short end of MIRI may probe atmospheric asymmetries between the limbs of the terminator on WASP-96b.\n\nA number of proposals have been put forward for detecting axion dark matter (DM) with grand unification scale decay constants that rely on the conversion of coherent DM axions to oscillating magnetic fields in the presence of static, laboratory magnetic fields. Crucially, such experiments $\\unicode{x2013}$ including ABRACADABRA $\\unicode{x2013}$ have to-date worked in the limit that the axion Compton wavelength is larger than the size of the experiment, which allows one to take a magnetoquasistatic (MQS) approach to modeling the axion signal. We use finite element methods to solve the coupled axion-electromagnetism equations of motion without assuming the MQS approximation. We show that the MQS approximation becomes a poor approximation at frequencies two orders of magnitude lower than the naive MQS limit. Radiation losses diminish the quality factor of an otherwise high-$Q$ resonant readout circuit, though this may be mitigated through shielding and minimizing lossy materials. Additionally, self-resonances associated with the detector geometry change the reactive properties of the pickup system, leading to two generic features beyond MQS: there are frequencies that require an inductive rather than capacitive tuning to maintain resonance, and the detector itself becomes a multi-pole resonator at high frequencies. Accounting for these features, competitive sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling may be extended well beyond the naive MQS limit.\n\nWe have investigated the systematic differences introduced when performing a Bayesian-inference analysis of the equation of state of neutron stars employing either variable- or constant-likelihood functions. The former have the advantage that it retains the full information on the distributions of the measurements, making an exhaustive usage of the data. The latter, on the other hand, have the advantage of a much simpler implementation and reduced computational costs. In both approaches, the EOSs have identical priors and have been built using the sound-speed parameterization method so as to satisfy the constraints from X-ray and gravitational-waves observations, as well as those from Chiral Effective Theory and perturbative QCD. In all cases, the two approaches lead to very similar results and the $90\\%$-confidence levels are essentially overlapping. Some differences do appear, but in regions where the probability density is extremely small and are mostly due to the sharp cutoff set on the binary tidal deformability $\\tilde \\Lambda \\leq 720$ employed in the constant-likelihood analysis. Our analysis has also produced two additional results. First, a clear inverse correlation between the normalized central number density of a maximally massive star, $n_{\\rm c, TOV}/n_s$, and the radius of a maximally massive star, $R_{\\rm TOV}$. Second, and most importantly, it has confirmed the relation between the chirp mass $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm chirp}$ and the binary tidal deformability $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. The importance of this result is that it relates a quantity that is measured very accurately, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm chirp}$, with a quantity that contains important information on the micro-physics, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. Hence, once $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm chirp}$ is measured in future detections, our relation has the potential of setting tight constraints on $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$.\n\nThe Sun may copiously produce hypothetical light particles such as axions or dark photons, a scenario which can be experimentally probed with so-called helioscopes. Here we investigate the impact of the angular and spectral distribution of solar dark photons on the sensitivity of such instruments. For the first time we evaluate this spectral and angular dependence of the dark photon flux over the whole mass range and apply this information to existing data from the Hinode Solar X-Ray Telescope. Specifically we use calibration images for a classical helioscope analysis as well as data from a solar eclipse providing sensitivity to exceptionally large oscillation lengths. We demonstrate that exploiting the signal features can boost the constraints by more than one order of magnitude in terms of the mixing parameter compared to a naive counting experiment.\n\nWe develop the use of mutual information (MI), a well-established metric in information theory, to interpret the inner workings of deep learning models. To accurately estimate MI from a finite number of samples, we present GMM-MI (pronounced $``$Jimmie$\"$), an algorithm based on Gaussian mixture models that can be applied to both discrete and continuous settings. GMM-MI is computationally efficient, robust to the choice of hyperparameters and provides the uncertainty on the MI estimate due to the finite sample size. We extensively validate GMM-MI on toy data for which the ground truth MI is known, comparing its performance against established mutual information estimators. We then demonstrate the use of our MI estimator in the context of representation learning, working with synthetic data and physical datasets describing highly non-linear processes. We train deep learning models to encode high-dimensional data within a meaningful compressed (latent) representation, and use GMM-MI to quantify both the level of disentanglement between the latent variables, and their association with relevant physical quantities, thus unlocking the interpretability of the latent representation. We make GMM-MI publicly available.\n\nModeling correctly the transport of neutrinos is crucial in some astrophysical scenarios such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. In this paper, we focus on the truncated-moment formalism, considering only the first two moments (M1 scheme) within the grey approximation, which reduces Boltzmann seven-dimensional equation to a system of $3+1$ equations closely resembling the hydrodynamic ones. Solving the M1 scheme is still mathematically challenging, since it is necessary to model the radiation-matter interaction in regimes where the evolution equations become stiff and behave as an advection-diffusion problem. Here, we present different global, high-order time integration schemes based on Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX) methods designed to overcome the time-step restriction caused by such behavior while allowing us to use the explicit RK commonly employed for the MHD and Einstein equations. Finally, we analyze their performance in several numerical tests.\n\nWe present highly accurate, dimensionally-reduced gravitational waveforms for binary inspirals whose components have large spin-induced quadrupole moments. The spin-induced quadrupole of a body first appears in the phase of a waveform at the early inspiral stage of the binary coalescence, making it a relatively clean probe of the internal structure of the body. However, for objects with large quadrupolar deviations from Kerr, searches using binary black hole (BBH) models would be ineffective. In order to perform a computationally-feasible search, we present two dimensionally-reduced models which are derived from the original six-dimensional post-Newtonian waveform for such systems. Our dimensional reduction method is guided by power counting in the post-Newtonian expansion, suitable reparameterizations of the source physics, and truncating terms in the phase that are small in most physically well-motivated regions of parameter space. In addition, we note that large quadrupolar deviations cause the frequency at which a binary system reaches its minimum binding energy to be reduced substantially. This minimum signals the end of the inspiral regime and provides a natural cutoff for the PN waveform. We provide accurate analytic estimates for these frequency cutoffs. Finally, we perform injection studies to test the effectualness of the dimensionally reduced waveforms. We find that over $80\\%$ of the injections have an effectualness of $\\varepsilon > 0.999$, significantly higher than is typically required for standard BBH banks, for systems with component spins of $|\\chi_i| \\lesssim 0.6$ and dimensionless quadrupole of $\\kappa_i \\lesssim 10^3$. Importantly, these waveforms represent an essential first step towards enabling an effective search for astrophysical objects with large quadrupoles.\n\nBy exploiting the extreme environment of the black hole (BH) as a potential place for axion-photon interaction, we use an axion-producing model of the magnetized plasma to study the shadow of an asymptotically flat rotating BH immersed into an axion-plasmon cloud. By aiming to reveal footprints of axion in the dark shadow of BH, we in this paper explore the influence of the fixed axion-plasmon background on the motion of incident photons around the rotating BH. Under some free parameter settings, we find that axion-plasmon cloud around rotating BH affects the shape and size of the shadow in such a way that its role is distinguishable from non-magnetized plasma and standard vacuum solutions. By being limited to high rotation BH, we show that the size of the BH shadow increases as the axion-plasmon coupling gets strong. Interestingly, our analysis indicates that as the mass of axion gets heavier, it can leave a subtle imprint of itself on the shadow. Conversely, in the non-rotating limit (Schwarzschild), by recovering the spherical symmetry of the shadow shape of BH, its size decreases. In coordination with the trend of change in shadow size, the investigation of the energy emission from the BH surrounded by the magnetized plasma shows that the maximal energy emission rate from the rotating BH in the presence of axion-plasmon cloud increases compared to the non-magnetized plasma and the vacuum solutions. Subsequently, by relaxing the rotation, the axion-plasmon cloud causes a decrease in the energy emission rate from the BH.\n\nGalilean Genesis is generically plagued with a strong coupling problem, but this can be avoided depending on the hierarchy between a classical energy scale of genesis and a strong coupling scale. In this paper, we investigate whether or not the models of Galilean Genesis without the strong coupling problem can explain the statistical properties of the observed CMB fluctuations based on two unified frameworks of Galilean Genesis. By focusing on the class in which the propagation speeds of the scalar and tensor perturbations are constant, we show that the models avoiding strong coupling and allowing a slightly red-tilted scalar power spectrum suffer from an overproduction of a scalar non-Gaussianity.\n\nSupersymmetry is a highly motivated theoretical framework, whose scale of breaking may be at PeV energies, to explain null searches at the Large Hadron Collider. SUSY breaking through a first order phase transition may have occurred in the early universe, leading to potential gravitational wave signals. Constructing a realistic model for gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, we show that such a transition can also induce masses for heavy right-handed neutrinos and sneutrinos, whose CP-violating decays give leptogenesis at the PeV scale, and a novel mechanism of neutrino mass generation at one loop. For the same models we predict the possible gravity wave signals, and we study the possibility of production of primordial black holes during the phase transition.\n\nWe analytically and numerically show that the acceleration of the cosmic expansion could be explained by a Quadratic Gravity model which is known to be able to trigger sufficient inflation, with neither negative pressure matter nor cosmological constant. Accordingly, it suggests that the Dark Energy could possibly be a post-inflation effect in Quadratic Gravity. We also show that this model admits all Einstein metrics as its solutions. Consequently, classic tests of Einstein's Gravity cannot falsify this model.\n\nWe investigate the photon-ALP (axion-like particle) oscillation effect on TeV gamma-ray spectral irregularities from the uncertain redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) VER J0521+211. The gamma-ray spectra are measured by the collaborations Fermi-LAT and VERITAS with the three flux states in 2013 and 2014. We set the combined constraints on the ALP parameter ($m_a, g_{a\\gamma}$) space with these states and test the extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption effect on ALP constraints with the four redshift upper limit scenarios of VER J0521+211. The 3$\\sigma$ photon-ALP combined constraints set by VER J0521+211 are roughly at $g_{a\\gamma} \\gtrsim 2.3\\times 10^{-11} \\rm \\, GeV^{-1}$ for $m_a \\lesssim 5\\times 10^{-8}\\, \\rm eV$. We find no clear connection between the redshift upper limit scenarios and the photon-ALP constraints.\n\nA novel, interesting class of scalar-tensor gravity theories is those with a limit on the field motion, where the scalar field either goes to a constant acceleration or stops accelerating and goes to a constant velocity. We combine these with the ability to dynamically cancel a high energy cosmological constant, e.g. through the well tempered or self tuning approaches. One can successfully have a cosmic expansion history with a matter dominated epoch and late time acceleration despite a large cosmological constant, although the late time de Sitter limit may be unstable. Pole models, such as in a Dirac-Born-Infeld action, are of particular interest for a cosmic speed limit.\n\nThe CRESST experiment employs cryogenic calorimeters for the sensitive measurement of nuclear recoils induced by dark matter particles. The recorded signals need to undergo a careful cleaning process to avoid wrongly reconstructed recoil energies caused by pile-up and read-out artefacts. We frame this process as a time series classification task and propose to automate it with neural networks. With a data set of over one million labeled records from 68 detectors, recorded between 2013 and 2019 by CRESST, we test the capability of four commonly used neural network architectures to learn the data cleaning task. Our best performing model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.932 on our test set. We show on an exemplary detector that about half of the wrongly predicted events are in fact wrongly labeled events, and a large share of the remaining ones have a context-dependent ground truth. We furthermore evaluate the recall and selectivity of our classifiers with simulated data. The results confirm that the trained classifiers are well suited for the data cleaning task.\n\nWe consider a mechanism which allows to decrease the attenuation of the high energy gamma ray flux from gamma ray burst GRB 221009A. The mechanism is based on the existence of a heavy $m_N\\sim0.1\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ mostly sterile neutrino $N$ which mixes with active (muon) neutrinos. $N$'s are produced in GRB in $\\pi$ and $K$ decays via mixing with $\\nu_\\mu$. They undergo the radiative decay $N\\rightarrow \\nu \\gamma$ on the way to the Earth. The usual exponential attenuation of gamma rays is lifted to an attenuation inverse in the optical depth. Various restrictions on this scenario are discussed. We find that the high energy $\\gamma$ events at $18\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ and potentially $251\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ can be explained if (i) the GRB active neutrino fluence is close to the observed limit, (ii) the branching ratio of $N\\rightarrow \\nu \\gamma$ is at least of the order 10\\%."
