        "text": "F.G and and George Miles conceived the idea of a new low cost military jet trainer in 1953, when still working on conversion of the M.77 Sparrowjet.\n\nIn designing the M.100 the two brothers and their small team set out to produce an aircraft to do the same job as the Jet Provost for ab initio and flying instruction, but in a generally smaller design, to minimise acquisition and operatings costs.\n\nWith its accent on economy, the M.100 was designed round a single Marboré IIA turbojet of only 880lb thrust for take-off, or little more than half the output of the initial Jet Provost’s 1640lb Viper ASV.5.\n\nOne of the main design features was the NACA-type flush intake above the wing centre-section for the Marboré centrifugal turbojet (for wich Blackburn had a production licence).\n\nThis intake’s location and shape minimised the possibilities of foreign object ingestion on the ground and in the air, at the expense of some loss in installed thrust. It certainly appeared to work well enough in most flight conditions.\n\nHowever, to prevent overspill at high angles of attack, fences had been added each side after the first flight,\n\nIn 1985, the original 1957 prototype Miles Student two-seat trainer has been renamed the GM100 (G-MIOO) after its designer, George Miles. Miles sold the unique aircraft to Mike Woodley, chairman of Aces High. It has been granted a UK Permit to Fly, and has updated avionics and a new paint scheme.\n\nWoodley, claims that the trainer’s low stall speed, around 55kt, is unique in its class, as is its excellent grassrunway capability. Aces High operated 20 aircraft for film work and air shows.\n\nFew weeks later, on August 24, 1985, the GM100 crashed at Duxford. The aircraft was being flown by company chief pilot Peter Hoare.\n\nFollowing an aerobatic sortie accompanied by former Miles Aircraft test pilot Duncan Macintosh, Hoare took off for a solo flight but abandoned take-off and landed heavily, coming to rest on the airfield. The aircraft sustained damage to the nose, and one wing was torn off.\n\nMiles Aircraft Limited\n\nThe original company was founded by Charles Powis and Jack Phillips as Philips and Powis Aircraft at Woodley airfield, after meeting Fred Miles. In 1936 Rolls-Royce Limited bought into the company and although aircraft were produced under the Miles name, it was not until 1943 that the firm became Miles Aircraft Limited when Rolls-Royce’s interests were bought out.\n\nIn 1947 the company went bankrupt and the assets were purchased by Handley Page as Handley Page Reading.\n\nF. G. Miles Limited\n\nIn 1950 F. G. Miles Limited was founded at Redhill to produce aircraft under the Miles name.\n\nIn 1952 they moved to Shoreham.\n\nIn 1961 the Miles company was merged with Auster Aircraft Limited into Beagle Aircraft."
