        "text": "Flavor versus mass eigenstates in neutrino asymmetries: implications for cosmology\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBarenboim, Gabriela [Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Departament de Fisica Teorica y IFIC, Burjassot (Spain); Kinney, William H. [University at Buffalo, Department of Physics, Buffalo, NY (United States); Park, Wan-Il [Universitat de Valencia-CSIC, Departament de Fisica Teorica y IFIC, Burjassot (Spain); Chonbuk National University, Division of Science Education and Institute of Fusion Science, Jeonju (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2017-09-15\n\nWe show that, if they exist, lepton number asymmetries (L{sub Î±}) of neutrino flavors should be distinguished from the ones (L{sub i}) of mass eigenstates, since Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bounds on the flavor eigenstates cannot be directly applied to the mass eigenstates. Similarly, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints on the mass eigenstates do not directly constrain flavor asymmetries. Due to the difference of mass and flavor eigenstates, the cosmological constraint on the asymmetries of neutrino flavors can be much stronger than the conventional expectation, but they are not uniquely determined unless at least the asymmetry of the heaviest neutrino is well constrained. The cosmological constraint on L{sub i} for a specific case is presented as an illustration.

Lifetimes of the heavy (H) and light (L) mass eigenstates in the B s 0 system are separately measured for the first time by determining the relative contributions of amplitudes with definite CP as a function of the decay time\n\nEigenstate Phase Transitions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhao, Bo\n\nPhase transitions are one of the most exciting physical phenomena ever discovered. The understanding of phase transitions has long been of interest. Recently eigenstate phase transitions have been discovered and studied; they are drastically different from traditional thermal phase transitions. In eigenstate phase transitions, a sharp change is exhibited in properties of the many-body eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of a quantum system, but not the thermal equilibrium properties of the same system. In this thesis, we study two different types of eigenstate phase transitions. The first is the eigenstate phase transition within the ferromagnetic phase of an infinite-range spin model. By studying the interplay of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and Ising symmetry breaking, we find two eigenstate phase transitions within the ferromagnetic phase: In the lowest-temperature phase the magnetization can macroscopically oscillate by quantum tunneling between up and down. The relaxation of the magnetization is always overdamped in the remainder of the ferromagnetic phase, which is further divided into phases where the system thermally activates itself over the barrier between the up and down states, and where it quantum tunnels. The second is the many-body localization phase transition. The eigenstates on one side of the transition obey the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis; the eigenstates on the other side are many-body localized, and thus thermal equilibrium need not be achieved for an initial state even after evolving for an arbitrary long time. We study this many-body localization phase transition in the strong disorder renormalization group framework. After setting up a set of coarse-graining rules for a general one dimensional chain, we get a simple \"toy model'' and obtain an almost purely analytical solution to the infinite-randomness critical fixed point renormalization group equation. We also get an estimate of the correlation length critical exponent nu\n\nSome considerations about mixing, oscillation phenomena and CP violation of different mass eigenstates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMalace, Simona; Lucaci-Timoce, Angela; Lazanu, I.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nIn the last twenty years there have been made many experimental and theoretical efforts to measure and verify the prediction of the Standard Model, as well as to put in evidence small deviation from these values. In the present paper, we discuss some aspects of possible regularities of the formalism of mixing and oscillation phenomena of the mass eigenstates in particle physics and possible consequences of hidden proprieties of the systems. In the literature representations of lepton flavour mixing with different parametrisation are used for three generations of leptons and quarks. Although these are mathematically equivalent, only one of them are likely to describe the underlying physics in a more transparent way, and particularly convenient in the analysis of experimental data or is able to establish a concordance with these ones. Flavour permutational symmetry of the mixing matrix, 'maximal democracy' and maximal CP violation give a simple and efficient way to understand the essential characteristics of the phenomena, with a minimum number of parameters. The deviations of the experimental data of these predicted values represent a simple clue to study phenomenologically the breaking of symmetries. The interplay of gravitation and linear superposition of different mass eigenstates, and their consequences on the oscillation clocks, phases and the physical observability are also briefly discussed.

Here, we report calculations of localized electronic and vibrational eigenstates for remarkably different, mostly realistic, disordered systems and point out similar characteristics in the cases studied. We show in each case that the eigenstates may be decomposed into exponentially localized islands which may appear in many different eigenstates. In all cases, the decay length of the islands increases only modestly near the localization-delocalization transition; the eigenstates become extended primarily by proliferation (growth in number) of islands near the transition. Recently, microphotoluminescence experiments (Guillet et al 2003 Phys. Rev. B 68 045319) have imaged exciton states in disordered quantum wires, and these bear a strong qualitative resemblance to the island structure of eigenstates that we have studied theoretically. (letter to the editor)\n\nQuantum Fractal Eigenstates\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nCasati, Giulio; Maspero, Giulio; Shepelyansky, Dima L.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe study quantum chaos in open dynamical systems and show that it is characterized by quantum fractal eigenstates located on the underlying classical strange repeller. The states with longest life times typically reveal a scars structure on the classical fractal set.\n\nIdentifying the closeness of eigenstates in quantum many-body systems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLi Hai-bin; Yang Yang; Wang Pei; Wang Xiao-guang\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe propose a quantity called modulus fidelity to measure the closeness of two quantum pure states. We use it to investigate the closeness of eigenstates in one-dimensional hard-core bosons. When the system is integrable, eigenstates close to their neighbor or not, which leads to a large fluctuation in the distribution of modulus fidelity. When the system becomes chaos, the fluctuation is reduced dramatically, which indicates all eigenstates become close to each other. It is also found that two kind of closeness, i.e., closeness of eigenstates and closeness of eigenvalues, are not correlated at integrability but correlated at chaos. We also propose that the closeness of eigenstates is the underlying mechanism of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) which explains the thermalization in quantum many-body systems. (paper)\n\nDoes a Single Eigenstate Encode the Full Hamiltonian?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGarrison, James R.; Grover, Tarun\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) posits that the reduced density matrix for a subsystem corresponding to an excited eigenstate is \"thermal.\" Here we expound on this hypothesis by asking: For which class of operators, local or nonlocal, is ETH satisfied? We show that this question is directly related to a seemingly unrelated question: Is the Hamiltonian of a system encoded within a single eigenstate? We formulate a strong form of ETH where, in the thermodynamic limit, the reduced density matrix of a subsystem corresponding to a pure, finite energy density eigenstate asymptotically becomes equal to the thermal reduced density matrix, as long as the subsystem size is much less than the total system size, irrespective of how large the subsystem is compared to any intrinsic length scale of the system. This allows one to access the properties of the underlying Hamiltonian at arbitrary energy densities (or temperatures) using just a single eigenstate. We provide support for our conjecture by performing an exact diagonalization study of a nonintegrable 1D quantum lattice model with only energy conservation. In addition, we examine the case in which the subsystem size is a finite fraction of the total system size, and we find that, even in this case, many operators continue to match their canonical expectation values, at least approximately. In particular, the von Neumann entanglement entropy equals the thermal entropy as long as the subsystem is less than half the total system. Our results are consistent with the possibility that a single eigenstate correctly predicts the expectation values of all operators with support on less than half the total system, as long as one uses a microcanonical ensemble with vanishing energy width for comparison. We also study, both analytically and numerically, a particle-number conserving model at infinite temperature that substantiates our conjectures.\n\nThermalization without eigenstate thermalization hypothesis after a quantum quench.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMori, Takashi; Shiraishi, Naoto\n\n2017-08-01\n\nNonequilibrium dynamics of a nonintegrable system without the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is studied. It is shown that, in the thermodynamic limit, this model thermalizes after an arbitrary quantum quench at finite temperature, although it does not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. In contrast, when the system size is finite and the temperature is low enough, the system may not thermalize. In this case, the steady state is well described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble constructed by using highly nonlocal conserved quantities. We also show that this model exhibits prethermalization, in which the prethermalized state is characterized by nonthermal energy eigenstates.\n\nSimilarity of eigenstates in generalized labyrinth tilings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nThiem, Stefanie; Schreiber, Michael\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe eigenstates of d-dimensional quasicrystalline models with a separable Hamiltonian are studied within the tight-binding model. The approach is based on mathematical sequences, constructed by an inflation rule P = {w â s,s â sws b-1 } describing the weak/strong couplings of atoms in a quasiperiodic chain. Higher-dimensional quasiperiodic tilings are constructed as a direct product of these chains and their eigenstates can be directly calculated by multiplying the energies E or wave functions Ï of the chain, respectively. Applying this construction rule, the grid in d dimensions splits into 2 d-1 different tilings, for which we investigated the characteristics of the wave functions. For the standard two-dimensional labyrinth tiling constructed from the octonacci sequence (b = 2) the lattice breaks up into two identical lattices, which consequently yield the same eigenstates. While this is not the case for b â 2, our numerical results show that the wave functions of the different grids become increasingly similar for large system sizes. This can be explained by the fact that the structure of the 2 d-1 grids mainly differs at the boundaries and thus for large systems the eigenstates approach each other. This property allows us to analytically derive properties of the higher-dimensional generalized labyrinth tilings from the one-dimensional results. In particular participation numbers and corresponding scaling exponents have been determined.\n\nCP violation in neutral B decays to non-CP-eigenstates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKayser, B.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIf CP violation comes from complex phases in the quark mixing matrix, then neutral B decays to CP eigenstates will exhibit large, cleanly-predicted CP-violating effects. The authors show that the same is true of neutral B decays to several types of ''near-CP-eigenstates.'' By experimentally studying the latter decays as well as those to the CP eigenstates, one will be able to obtain more definitive information on CP violation from a given number of B mesons\n\nEigenstate Thermalization for Degenerate Observables\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAnza, Fabio; Gogolin, Christian; Huber, Marcus\n\n2018-04-01\n\nUnder unitary time evolution, expectation values of physically reasonable observables often evolve towards the predictions of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) states that this is also true already for individual energy eigenstates. Here we aim at elucidating the emergence of the ETH for observables that can realistically be measured due to their high degeneracy, such as local, extensive, or macroscopic observables. We bisect this problem into two parts, a condition on the relative overlaps and one on the relative phases between the eigenbases of the observable and Hamiltonian. We show that the relative overlaps are unbiased for highly degenerate observables and demonstrate that unless relative phases conspire to cumulative effects, this makes such observables verify the ETH. Through this we elucidate potential pathways towards proofs of thermalization.\n\nLoop suppressed light fermion masses with U (1 )R gauge symmetry\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNomura, Takaaki; Okada, Hiroshi\n\n2017-07-01\n\nWe propose a model with a two-Higgs doublet, where quark and charged-lepton masses in the first and second families are induced at one-loop level, and neutrino masses are induced at the two-loop level. In our model, we introduce an extra U (1 )R gauge symmetry that plays a crucial role in achieving desired terms in no conflict with anomaly cancellation. We show the mechanism to generate fermion masses, the resultant mass matrices, and Yukawa interactions in mass eigenstates, and we discuss several interesting phenomenologies such as the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment and the dark matter candidate that arise from this model.\n\nEigenstates with the auxiliary field method\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSemay, Claude [Service de Physique Nucleaire et Subnucleaire, Universite de Mons-UMONS, 20 Place du Parc, 7000 Mons (Belgium); Silvestre-Brac, Bernard, E-mail: claude.semay@umons.ac.b, E-mail: silvestre@lpsc.in2p3.f [LPSC Universite Joseph Fourier, Grenoble 1, CNRS/IN2P3, Institut Polytechnique de Grenoble, Avenue des Martyrs 53, F-38026 Grenoble-Cedex (France)\n\n2010-07-02\n\nThe auxiliary field method is a powerful technique to obtain approximate closed-form energy formulas for eigenequations in quantum mechanics. Very good results can be obtained for Schroedinger and semirelativistic Hamiltonians with various potentials, even in the case of many-body problems. This method can also provide approximate eigenstates in terms of well-known wavefunctions, for instance harmonic oscillator or hydrogen-like states, but with a characteristic size which depends on quantum numbers. In this paper, we consider two-body Schroedinger equations with linear, logarithmic and exponential potentials and show that analytical approximations of the corresponding eigenstates can be obtained with the auxiliary field method, with very good accuracy in some cases.\n\nEigenstates with the auxiliary field method\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSemay, Claude; Silvestre-Brac, Bernard\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe auxiliary field method is a powerful technique to obtain approximate closed-form energy formulas for eigenequations in quantum mechanics.

The model predicts a zero-mass pion for zero-mass quarks and a Regge spectrum of linear trajectories with the same slope in the leading orbital angular momentum L of hadrons and the radial quantum number N. Light-Front Holography maps the amplitudes which are functions of the fifth dimension variable z of anti-de Sitter space to a corresponding hadron theory quantized on the light front. The resulting Lorentz-invariant relativistic light-front wave equations are functions of an invariant impact variable {zeta} which measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron at equal light-front time. The result is to a semi-classical frame-independent first approximation to the spectra and light-front wavefunctions of meson and baryon light-quark bound states, which in turn predict the behavior of the pion and nucleon form factors. The theory implements chiral symmetry in a novel way: the effects of chiral symmetry breaking increase as one goes toward large interquark separation, consistent with spectroscopic data, and the the hadron eigenstates generally have components with different orbital angular momentum; e.g., the proton eigenstate in AdS/QCD with massless quarks has L = 0 and L = 1 light-front Fock components with equal probability. The soft-wall model also predicts the form of the non-perturbative effective coupling {alpha}{sub s}{sup AdS} (Q) and its {beta}-function which agrees with the effective coupling {alpha}{sub g1} extracted from the Bjorken sum rule. The AdS/QCD model can be systematically improved by using its complete orthonormal solutions to diagonalize the full QCD light-front Hamiltonian or by applying the Lippmann-Schwinger method in order to systematically include the QCD interaction terms. A new perspective on quark and gluon condensates is also reviewed.\n\nWitnessing eigenstates for quantum simulation of Hamiltonian spectra\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSantagati, Raffaele; Wang, Jianwei; Gentile, Antonio A.; Paesani, Stefano; Wiebe, Nathan; McClean, Jarrod R.; Morley-Short, Sam; Shadbolt, Peter J.; Bonneau, Damien; Silverstone, Joshua W.; Tew, David P.; Zhou, Xiaoqi; OâBrien, Jeremy L.; Thompson, Mark G.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe efficient calculation of Hamiltonian spectra, a problem often intractable on classical machines, can find application in many fields, from physics to chemistry. We introduce the concept of an âeigenstate witnessâ and, through it, provide a new quantum approach that combines variational methods and phase estimation to approximate eigenvalues for both ground and excited states. This protocol is experimentally verified on a programmable silicon quantum photonic chip, a mass-manufacturable platform, which embeds entangled state generation, arbitrary controlled unitary operations, and projective measurements. Both ground and excited states are experimentally found with fidelities >99%, and their eigenvalues are estimated with 32 bits of precision. We also investigate and discuss the scalability of the approach and study its performance through numerical simulations of more complex Hamiltonians. This result shows promising progress toward quantum chemistry on quantum computers. PMID:29387796\n\nStatistical properties of highly excited quantum eigenstates of a strongly chaotic system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAurich, R.; Steiner, F.\n\n1992-06-01\n\nStatistical properties of highly excited quantal eigenstates are studied for the free motion (geodesic flow) on a compact surface of constant negative curvature (hyperbolic octagon) which represents a strongly chaotic system (K-system). The eigenstates are expanded in a circular-wave basis, and it turns out that the expansion coefficients behave as Gaussian pseudo-random numbers. It is shown that this property leads to a Gaussian amplitude distribution P(Ï) in the semiclassical limit, i.e. the wavefunctions behave as Gaussian random functions. This behaviour, which should hold for chaotic systems in general, is nicely confirmed for eigenstates lying 10000 states above the ground state thus probing the semiclassical limit. In addition, the autocorrelation function and the path-correlation function are calculated and compared with a crude semiclassical Bessel-function approximation. Agreement with the semiclassical prediction is only found, if a local averaging is performed over roughly 1000 de Broglie wavelengths. On smaller scales, the eigenstates show much more structure than predicted by the first semiclassical approximation.

Light-front holography allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS fifth dimension to be mapped to frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical space-time. The result is a single-variable light-front Schroedinger equation which determines the eigenspectrum and the light-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular momentum. The coordinate z in AdS space is uniquely identified with a Lorentz-invariant coordinate Î¶ which measures the separation of the constituents within a hadron at equal light-front time and determines the off-shell dynamics of the bound state wavefunctions as a function of the invariant mass of the constituents. The hadron eigenstates generally have components with different orbital angular momentum; e.g., the proton eigenstate in AdS/QCD with massless quarks has L = 0 and L = 1 light-front Fock components with equal probability. Higher Fock states with extra quark-anti quark pairs also arise. The soft-wall model also predicts the form of the nonperturbative effective coupling and its Î²-function. The AdS/QCD model can be systematically improved by using its complete orthonormal solutions to diagonalize the full QCD light-front Hamiltonian or by applying the Lippmann-Schwinger method to systematically include QCD interaction terms. Some novel features of QCD are discussed, including the consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates.

The dynamics of a localized wavepacket is discussed which travels along a short periodic orbit yielding a test for the scar model developed by Heller. The autocorrelation function C(t) and the smeared weighted spectral density S Ï (E) are in accordance with this model, but the conclusion that this implies the existence of scarred eigenstates is not confirmed. A random wavefunction model generates with the same probability intensity structures being localized near short periodic orbits as the wavefunctions obeying the Schroedinger equation. Although there are some eigenstates which are localized near a periodic orbit, the conclusion that their intensities differ significantly from the statistically expected ones cannot be drawn. Thus the scar phenomenon seems to be absent in the case of hyperbolic octagons.

The main purpose of this project is to determine the parameters that will allow the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to observe a decay parameter with some statistical significance. Another goal is to determine the parameters that JUNO could detect in the case that the third neutrino mass is lighter than the first two neutrino species. We also replicate the results that were found in the JUNO Conceptual Design Report (CDR). By utilizing Î§2-squared analysis constraints have been put on the mixing angles, mass squared differences, and the third neutrino decay parameter. These statistical tests take into account background noise and normalization corrections and thus the finalized bounds are a good approximation for the true bounds that JUNO can detect. If the decay parameter is not included in our models, the 99% confidence interval lies within The bounds 0s to 2.80x10-12s. However, if we account for a decay parameter of 3x10-5 ev2, then 99% confidence interval lies within 8.73x10-12s to 8.73x10-11s.\n\nMajorana mass term, Dirac neutrinos and selective neutrino oscillations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLeung, C.N.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nIn a theory of neutrino mixing via a Majorana mass term involving only the left-handed neutrinos there exist selection rules for neutrino oscillations if true Dirac and/or exactly zero mass eigenstates are present. In the case of three neutrino flavours no oscillation is allowed if the mass spectrum contains one Dirac and one nondegenerate Majorana massive neutrino. The origin of these selection rules and their implications are discussed and the number of possible CP-violating phases in the lepton mixing matrix when Dirac and Majorana mass eigenstates coexist is given.

Rev. B 42, 1062 (1990)], a rigorous eight-dimensional (8D) trace map for a general model of Thue-Morse (TM) sequences is obtained. Using this trace map, the characteristics of electronic eigenstates in TM lattices are explored in a very broad way. Simultaneously, a constraint condition for energy parameters, under which the complex 8D trace map can be simplified into the ordinary form, is found. It is also proved analytically that all eigenstates of TM lattices are extended when this constraint conditon is fulfilled. Furthermore, the properties of eigenstates beyond this constraint are investigated and some wave functions with critical features are discovered by the multifractal analysis. Our results support the previous viewpoint that a TM lattice is an intermediate stage between periodic and Fibonacci structures.\n\nSteady bound electromagnetic eigenstate arises in a homogeneous isotropic linear metamaterial with zero-real-part-of-impedance and nonzero-imaginary-part-of-wave-vector\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Jiangwei; Dai, Yuyao; Yan, Lin; Zhao, Huimin\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn this paper, we shall demonstrate theoretically that steady bound electromagnetic eigenstate can arise in an infinite homogeneous isotropic linear metamaterial with zero-real-part-of-impedance and nonzero-imaginary-part-of-wave-vector, which is partly attributed to that, here, nonzero-imaginary-part-of-wave-vector is not involved with energy losses or gain. Altering value of real-part-of-impedance of the metamaterial, the bound electromagnetic eigenstate may become to be a progressive wave. Our work may be useful to further understand energy conversion and conservation properties of electromagnetic wave in the dispersive and absorptive medium and provides a feasible route to stop, store and release electromagnetic wave (light) conveniently by using metamaterial with near-zero-real-part-of-impedance.\n\nAnalysis of investment appeal of the industrial enterprise by eigenstate method\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBuslaeva O.S.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available An analysis of enterprise performance is considered. The problem is solved based on the analysis of the base indicators of functioning of the enterprise in terms of improving economic stability, and also development of autoregulation mechanism of economical stability of enterprise. An eigenstate method is proposed for the analysis of the basic indicators of the enterprise as it allows to construct an economomical stability model of enterprise. Methodology of economic stability analysis of enterprise on the basis of eigenstate method is described. The formulas for calculating the complex indicator of economic stability are given. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated on the example of economic stability analysis of the large trading company.\n\nAmbiguities and subtleties in fermion mass terms in practical quantum field theory\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCheng, Yifan; Kong, Otto C.W.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis is a review on structure of the fermion mass terms in quantum field theory, under the perspective of its practical applications in the real physics of Natureâspecifically, we discuss fermion mass structure in the Standard Model of high energy physics, which successfully describes fundamental physics up to the TeV scale. The review is meant to be pedagogical, with detailed mathematics presented beyond the level one can find any easily in the textbooks. The discussions, however, bring up important subtleties and ambiguities about the subject that may be less than well appreciated. In fact, the naive perspective of the nature and masses of fermions as one would easily drawn from the presentations of fermion fields and their equations of motion from a typical textbook on quantum field theory leads to some confusing or even wrong statements which we clarify here. In particular, we illustrate clearly that a Dirac fermion mass eigenstate is mathematically equivalent to two degenerated Majorana fermion mass eigenstates at least as long as the mass terms are concerned. There are further ambiguities and subtleties in the exact description of the eigenstate(s). Especially, for the case of neutrinos, the use of the Dirac or Majorana terminology may be mostly a matter of choice. The common usage of such terminology is rather based on the broken SU(2) charges of the related Weyl spinors hence conventional and may not be unambiguously extended to cover more complicate models. - Highlights: â¢ Structure of fermion mass terms in practical quantum field theory is reviewed. â¢ Important subtleties and ambiguities on the subject are clarified. â¢ A mass eigenstate Dirac fermion and two degenerated Majorana ones are equivalent. â¢ The conventional meaning of such terminology for neutrinos is critically discussed\n\nObtaining highly excited eigenstates of the localized XX chain via DMRG-X\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDevakul, Trithep; Khemani, Vedika; Pollmann, Frank; Huse, David A.; Sondhi, S. L.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe benchmark a variant of the recently introduced density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)-X algorithm against exact results for the localized random field XX chain. We find that the eigenstates obtained via DMRG-X exhibit a highly accurate l-bit description for system sizes much bigger than the direct, many-body, exact diagonalization in the spin variables is able to access. We take advantage of the underlying free fermion description of the XX model to accurately test the strengths and limitations of this algorithm for large system sizes. We discuss the theoretical constraints on the performance of the algorithm from the entanglement properties of the eigenstates, and its actual performance at different values of disorder. A small but significant improvement to the algorithm is also presented, which helps significantly with convergence. We find that, at high entanglement, DMRG-X shows a bias towards eigenstates with low entanglement, but can be improved with increased bond dimension. This result suggests that one must be careful when applying the algorithm for interacting many-body localized spin models near a transition.

We show that the TR Hamiltonian matrix for any n can be constructed from dipole-dipole matrix elements computed for n = 2 . We present results for linear H2O@C60 assemblies. Two classes of eigenstates are revealed. One class comprises excitations of the 111 rotational level of H2O. The lowest-energy 111 -derived eigenstate for each assembly exhibits significant dipole ordering and shifts down in energy with the assembly size.\n\nExactly solvable position dependent mass schroedinger equation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKoc, R.; Tuetuencueler, H.; Koercuek, E.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nExact solution of the Schrodinger equation with a variable mass is presented.

Both H 2 O and C 60 moieties are treated as rigid and the cage-cage geometry is taken to be fixed. We consider the TR eigenstates of H 2 O@C 60 monomers in the dimer to be coupled by the electric dipole-dipole interaction between water moieties and develop expressions for computing the matrix elements of that interaction in a dimer basis composed of products of monomer 6D TR eigenstates reported by us recently [P. M. Felker and Z. BaÄiÄ, J. Chem. Phys. 144, 201101 (2016)]. We use these expressions to compute TR Hamiltonian matrices of H 2 O@C 60 dimer for two values of the water dipole moment and for various dimer geometries. 12D TR eigenstates of the dimer are then obtained by filter diagonalization. The results reveal two classes of eigenstates, distinguished by the leading order (first or second) at which dipole-dipole coupling contributes to them. The two types of eigenstates differ in the general magnitude of their dipole-induced energy shifts and in the dependence of those shifts on the value of the water dipole moment and on the distance between the H 2 O@C 60 monomers. The dimer results are also found to be markedly insensitive to any change in the orientations of the C 60 cages. Finally, the results lend some support for the interpretation that electric dipole-dipole coupling is at least partially responsible for the apparent reduced-symmetry environment experienced by H 2 O in the powder samples of H 2 O@C 60 [K. S. K. Goh et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 16, 21330 (2014)], but only if the water dipole is taken to have a magnitude close to that of free water. The methodology developed in the paper is transferable directly to the calculation of TR eigenstates of larger H 2 O@C 60 assemblies, that will\n\nMeasurement of CP-Violating Asymmetries in B0 Decays to CP Eigenstates\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMacFarlane, David B\n\n2001-02-26\n\nWe present measurements of time-dependent CP-violating asymmetries in neutral B decays to several CP eigenstates. The measurement uses a data sample of 23 million {Upsilon}(4S) {yields} B{bar B} decays collected by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric B Factory at SLAC. In this sample, we find events where one neutral B meson is fully reconstructed in a CP eigenstate containing charmonium and the flavor of the other neutral B meson is determined from its decay products. The amplitude of the CP-violating asymmetry, which in the Standard Model is proportional to sin2{beta}, is derived from the decay time distributions in such events. The result is sin2{beta} = 0.34 {+-} 0.20 (stat) {+-} 0.05 (syst).\n\nMeasurement of CP-violating asymmetries in B0 decays to CP eigenstates.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAubert, B; Boutigny, D;

Provided the magnetic flux per unit hexagon is a rational of the elementary flux, the one-particle Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the generators of the quantum group U q (sl 2 ). Employing the functional representation of the quantum group U q (sl 2 ), the Harper equation is rewritten as a system of two coupled functional equations in the complex plane. For the special values of quasi-momentum, the entangled system admits solutions in terms of polynomials. The system is shown to exhibit a certain symmetry allowing us to resolve the entanglement, and a basic single equation determining the eigenvalues and eigenstates (polynomials) is obtained. Equations specifying the locations of the roots of polynomials in the complex plane are found. Employing numerical analysis, the roots of polynomials corresponding to different eigenstates are solved and diagrams exhibiting the ordered structure of one-particle eigenstates are depicted.

In addition, the analytic conditions for determining the energy spectrum are obtained. Our results show that conditions proposed by Braak (2011 Phys. Rev.

The well-known Judd isolated exact solutions appear naturally as truncations of the confluent Heun functions. (paper)\n\nSimulating at realistic quark masses.

Using the fact that momentum and energy must transform linearly between reference frames, we present a novel derivation of the mass-energy equivalence, namely, the relation that the energy is proportional to the moving mass, with no postulate about the existence of light or its properties. We further prove the mass-velocity relation without relying on momentum and energy conservation or on the Lorentz transformation. It is demonstrated that neither conservation laws nor the Lorentz transformation are necessary to establish those relations, and that those relations have a wider scope of validity than that of the conservation laws and the invariance of the speed of light.\n\nExtended Hellmann-Feynman theorem for degenerate eigenstates\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, G. P.; George, Thomas F.\n\n2004-04-01\n\nIn a previous paper, we reported a failure of the traditional Hellmann-Feynman theorem (HFT) for degenerate eigenstates. This has generated enormous interest among different groups. In four independent papers by Fernandez, by Balawender, Hola, and March, by Vatsya, and by Alon and Cederbaum, an elegant method to solve the problem was devised. The main idea is that one has to construct and diagonalize the force matrix for the degenerate case, and only the eigenforces are well defined. We believe this is an important extension to HFT. Using our previous example for an energy level of fivefold degeneracy, we find that those eigenforces correctly reflect the symmetry of the molecule.\n\nClosure of the squared Zakharov--Shabat eigenstates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKaup, D.J.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nBy solution of the inverse scattering problem for a third-order (degenerate) eigenvalue problem, the closure of the squared eigenfunctions of the Zakharov--Shabat equations is found. The question of the completeness of squared eigenstates occurs in many aspects of ''inverse scattering transforms'' (solving nonlinear evolution equations exactly by inverse scattering techniques), as well as in various aspects of the inverse scattering problem. The method used here is quite suggestive as to how one might find the closure of the squared eigenfunctions of other eigenvalue equations, and the strong analogy between these results and the problem of finding the closure of the eigenvectors of a nonself-adjoint matrix is pointed out\n\nEigenstates and dynamics of Hooke's atom: Exact results and path integral simulations\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGholizadehkalkhoran, Hossein; RuokosenmÃ¤ki, Ilkka; Rantala, Tapio T.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe system of two interacting electrons in one-dimensional harmonic potential or Hooke's atom is considered, again. On one hand, it appears as a model for quantum dots in a strong confinement regime, and on the other hand, it provides us with a hard test bench for new methods with the \"space splitting\" arising from the one-dimensional Coulomb potential. Here, we complete the numerous previous studies of the ground state of Hooke's atom by including the excited states and dynamics, not considered earlier. With the perturbation theory, we reach essentially exact eigenstate energies and wave functions for the strong confinement regime as novel results. We also consider external perturbation induced quantum dynamics in a simple separable case. Finally, we test our novel numerical approach based on real-time path integrals (RTPIs) in reproducing the above. The RTPI turns out to be a straightforward approach with exact account of electronic correlations for solving the eigenstates and dynamics without the conventional restrictions of electronic structure methods.\n\nEntanglement of Exact Excited Eigenstates of the Hubbard Model in Arbitrary Dimension\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOskar Vafek, Nicolas Regnault, B.

For the eta-pairing states with finite spin magnetization density, the leading term can scale as the volume or as the area-times-log, depending on the momentum space occupation of the Fermions with flipped spins. We also compute the corrections to the leading scaling. In order to study the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH, we also compute the entanglement Renyi entropies of such states and compare them with the corresponding entropies of thermal density matrix in various ensembles. Such states, which we find violate strong ETH, may provide a useful platform for a detailed study of the time-dependence of the onset of thermalization due to perturbations which violate the total pseudospin conservation.\n\nDim light at night increases body mass of female mice.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAubrecht, Taryn G; Jenkins, Richelle; Nelson, Randy J\n\n2015-05-01\n\nDuring the past century, the prevalence of light at night has increased in parallel with obesity rates.

Their realization in nanostructures finite in all dimensions is inherently challenging, because they require materials with extreme electromagnetic properties. Here we explore the realization of these bound states in the continuum using ultrathin metasurfaces composed of arrays of nanoparticles. We first show that arrays of lossless nanoparticles can realize the condition for EEs, and then explore the use of Ag nanoparticles coated with gain media shells to compensate material loss and revive the EE despite realistic loss in plasmonic materials. We discuss the possible experimental realization of the proposed structures, and provide useful guidelines for practical implementation in nanophotonics systems with largely enhanced lightâmatter interactions. These metasurfaces may lead to highly efficient lasers, filters, frequency comb generation and sensors.\n\nQuantum information entropies of the eigenstates for the PÃ¶schlâTeller-like potential\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSun Guo-Hua; Aoki, M. Avila; Dong Shi-Hai\n\n2013-01-01\n\nShannon entropy for lower position and momentum eigenstates of PÃ¶schlâTeller-like potential is evaluated. Based on the entropy densities demonstrated graphically, we note that the wave through of the position information entropy density Ï(x) moves right when the potential parameter V 1 increases and its amplitude decreases. However, its wave through moves left with the increase in the potential parameter |V 2 |. Concerning the momentum information entropy density Ï(p), we observe that its amplitude increases with increasing potential parameter V 1 , but its amplitude decreases with increasing |V 2 |. The BialynickiâBirulaâMycielski (BBM) inequality has also been tested for a number of states. Moreover, there exist eigenstates that exhibit squeezing in the momentum information entropy. Finally, we note that position information entropy increases with V 1 , but decreases with |V 2 |. However, the variation of momentum information entropy is contrary to that of the position information entropy.

Our approach consists mainly of two stages: We derive the explicit expressions of the mass-eigenvalues and mass-eigenstates of the physical gauge bosons from a mass squared-matrix that contains all the information about the mixing parameters among the gauge fields and the phases which are sources for CP violation. In the light of this analysis, we derive the explicit expressions for the interaction Lagrangians of the charged currents, the neutral currents and the charged and colored currents in SO(10). We present explicit expressions of the vector and axial-vector couplings of the two neutral currents in SO(10). We show how the baryon, lepton and baryon minus lepton number violating processes and their explicit CP violating phases are accommodated in the SO(10) theory. The Higgs potential that we use to implement in the Higgs mechanism is constructed in a most general fashion through a careful study of the Higgs fields of SO(10), where we give special emphasis on illustrating the explicit matrix representation of these Higgs fields. The potential part of the Higgs Lagrangian will give us the properties of the minimum of the vacuum, and the kinetic part will give us the mass-squared matrix of the gauge bosons via spontaneous symmetry breakdown. The same Higgs multiplets will be coupled to fermions through a democratic Yukawa matrix. Thereby, we derive explicit expressions for the fermion masses of the third family including Majorana and Dirac masses for neutrinos. We introduce a flavor-eigenbasis for neutrinos and find the mass-eigenstates and mass-eigenvalues of the neutrinos. Explicit expressions for CP violation in the neutrino sector are obtained. In the second stage of our work, we evaluate all the above mentioned quantities. In addition, we present the values of the physical\n\nLight meson physics from maximally twisted mass lattice QCD\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBaron, R.; Boucaud, P.

The goal is not only to calculate the spectrum of hadrons masses from first principles, but also to derive the momentum and spin distributions of the quarks and gluons which control high energy hadron interactions. One approach to these difficult calculations is to simulate QCD on an artificial lattice. Recently, several new methods based on ''light-cone'' quantization have been proposed as alternatives to lattice theory for solving non-perturbative problems in QCD and other field theories. The basic idea is a generalization of Heisenberg's pioneer matrix formulation of quantum mechanics: if one could numerically diagonalize the matrix of the Hamiltonian representing the underlying QCD interaction, then the resulting eigenvalues would give the hadron spectrum, while the corresponding eigenstates would describe each hadron in terms of its quark and gluon degrees of freedom\n\nTHE BLACK HOLE MASS, STELLAR MASS-TO-LIGHT RATIO, AND DARK HALO IN M87\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGebhardt, Karl; Thomas, Jens\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe model the dynamical structure of M87 (NGC4486) using high spatial resolution long-slit observations of stellar light in the central regions, two-dimensional stellar light kinematics out to half of the effective radius, and globular cluster velocities out to eight effective radii. We simultaneously fit for four parameters: black hole mass, dark halo core radius, dark halo circular velocity, and stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio. We find a black hole mass of 6.4(Â±0.5) x 10 9 M sun (the uncertainty is 68% confidence marginalized over the other parameters). The stellar M/L V = 6.3 Â± 0.8. The best-fit dark halo core radius is 14 Â± 2 kpc, assuming a cored logarithmic potential. The best-fit dark halo circular velocity is 715 Â± 15 km s -1 . Our black hole mass is over a factor of 2 larger than previous stellar dynamical measures, and our derived stellar M/L ratio is two times lower than previous dynamical measures. When we do not include a dark halo, we measure a black hole mass and stellar M/L ratio that is consistent with previous measures, implying that the major difference is in the model assumptions. The stellar M/L ratio from our models is very similar to that derived from stellar population models of M87. The reason for the difference in the black hole mass is because we allow the M/L ratio to change with radius. The dark halo is degenerate with the stellar M/L ratio, which is subsequently degenerate with the black hole mass. We argue that dynamical models of galaxies that do not include the contribution from a dark halo may produce a biased result for the black hole mass. This bias is especially large for a galaxy with a shallow light profile such as M87, and may not be as severe in galaxies with steeper light profiles unless they have a large stellar population change with radius.\n\nNon-existence of rest-frame spin-eigenstate spinors in their own electrodynamics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFabbri, Luca; da Rocha, RoldÃ£o\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe assume a physical situation where gravity with torsion is neglected for an electrodynamically self-interacting spinor that will be taken in its rest-frame and spin-eigenstate: we demonstrate that under this circumstance no solution exists for the system of field equations.

Here we demonstrate how the same methodology can be used to identify and characterize polyclonal immunoglobulins in serum. We establish that two molecular mass distributions observed by microLC-ESI-Q-TOF MS are from polyclonal kappa and lambda light chains using a combination of theoretical molecular masses from gene sequence data and the analysis of commercially available purified polyclonal IgG kappa and IgG lambda from normal human serum. A linear regression comparison of kappa/lambda ratios for 74 serum samples (25 hypergammaglobulinemia, 24 hypogammaglobulinemia, 25 normal) determined by microflowLC-ESI-Q-TOF MS and immunonephelometry had a slope of 1.37 and a correlation coefficient of 0.639. In addition to providing kappa/lambda ratios, the same microLC-ESI-Q-TOF MS analysis can determine the molecular mass for oligoclonal light chains observed above the polyclonal background in patient samples. In 2 patients with immune disorders and hypergammaglobulinemia, we observed a skewed polyclonal molecular mass distribution which translated into biased kappa/lambda ratios. Mass spectrometry provides a rapid and simple way to combine the polyclonal kappa/lambda light chain abundance ratios with the identification of dominant monoclonal as well as oligoclonal light chain immunoglobulins. We anticipate that this approach to evaluating immunoglobulin light chains will lead to improved understanding of immune deficiencies, autoimmune diseases, and antibody responses.\n\nQuantized Eigenstates of a Classical Particle in a Ponderomotive Potential\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDodin, I.Y.; Fisch, N.J.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe average dynamics of a classical particle under the action of a high-frequency radiation resembles quantum particle motion in a conservative field with an effective de Broglie wavelength Î» equal to the particle average displacement on a period of oscillations. In a ''quasi-classical'' field, with a spatial scale large compared to Î», the guiding center motion is adiabatic. Otherwise, a particle exhibits quantized eigenstates in a ponderomotive potential well, can tunnel through classically forbidden regions and experience reflection from an attractive potential. Discrete energy levels are also found for a ''crystal'' formed by multiple ponderomotive barriers\n\nAutoLens: Automated Modeling of a Strong Lens's Light, Mass and Source\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNightingale, J. W.; Dye, S.; Massey, Richard J.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis work presents AutoLens, the first entirely automated modeling suite for the analysis of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses. AutoLens simultaneously models the lens galaxy's light and mass whilst reconstructing the extended source galaxy on an adaptive pixel-grid. The method's approach to source-plane discretization is amorphous, adapting its clustering and regularization to the intrinsic properties of the lensed source. The lens's light is fitted using a superposition of Sersic functions, allowing AutoLens to cleanly deblend its light from the source. Single component mass models representing the lens's total mass density profile are demonstrated, which in conjunction with light modeling can detect central images using a centrally cored profile. Decomposed mass modeling is also shown, which can fully decouple a lens's light and dark matter and determine whether the two component are geometrically aligned. The complexity of the light and mass models are automatically chosen via Bayesian model comparison. These steps form AutoLens's automated analysis pipeline, such that all results in this work are generated without any user-intervention. This is rigorously tested on a large suite of simulated images, assessing its performance on a broad range of lens profiles, source morphologies and lensing geometries. The method's performance is excellent, with accurate light, mass and source profiles inferred for data sets representative of both existing Hubble imaging and future Euclid wide-field observations.\n\nREVISED MASS-TO-LIGHT RATIOS FOR NEARBY GALAXY GROUPS AND CLUSTERS\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShan, Yutong; Courteau, StÃ©phane; McDonald, Michael\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe present a detailed investigation of the cluster stellar mass-to-light (M*/L) ratio and cumulative stellar masses, derived on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, for 12 massive (M 500 â¼ 10 14 -10 15 M â ), nearby clusters with available optical imaging data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 and X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Our method involves a statistical cluster membership using both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts when available to maximize completeness while minimizing contamination effects. We show that different methods of estimating the stellar mass-to-light ratio from observed photometry result in systematic discrepancies in the total stellar masses and average mass-to-light ratios of cluster galaxies. Nonetheless, all conversion methodologies point to a lack of correlation between M*/L i and total cluster mass, even though low-mass groups contain relatively more blue galaxies. We also find no statistically significant correlation between M*/L i and the fraction of blue galaxies (g â i < 0.85). For the mass range covered by our sample, the assumption of a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF) yields an integrated M*/L i â 1.7 Â± 0.2 M â /L i, â , a lower value than used in most similar studies, though consistent with the study of low-mass galaxy groups by Leauthaud etÂ al. A light (diet) Salpeter IMF would imply a â¼60% increase in M*/L i\n\nVolume dependence of light hadron masses in full lattice QCD\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nOrth, B.; Lippert, T.; Schilling, K\n\n2004-03-01\n\nThe aim of the GRAL project is to simulate full QCD with standard Wilson fermions at light quark masses on small to medium-sized lattices and to obtain infinite-volume results by extrapolation.

We present our results for its ground states, as well as for its excited states. We observe that the lower bound of the sum of the position and momentum entropies expressed by the Beckner, Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski (BBM) inequality is satisfied. Moreover, there exist eigenstates that exhibit squeezing in the position information entropy. In fact, entropy squeezing, which occurs in position, will be compensated for by an increase in momentum entropy, such that the BBM inequality is guaranteed. To complete our study we investigate the amplitude squeezing in x and p-quadratures corresponding to the eigenstates of the isotonic oscillator and show that amplitude squeezing, again in x, will be revealed as expected, while the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship is also satisfied. Finally, our numerical calculations of the entropy densities will be presented graphically.\n\nPhoton mass drag and the momentum of light in a medium\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPartanen, Mikko; HÃ¤yrynen, Teppo; Oksanen, Jani\n\n2017-01-01\n\nConventional theories of electromagnetic waves in a medium assume that the energy propagating with the light pulse in the medium is entirely carried by the field.

In particular the non-linear Schroedinger equation and the massive Thirring model are considered. It is found that certain Jost functions of the associated scattering problem lead already, in quantizing the theory, to creation operators for the exact eigenstates of the corresponding Hamiltonians.

No strong variation in M/L is observed. To investigate the sensitivity and reliability of observational mass-to-light determinations for a variety of galactic parameters, model galaxies having de Vaucouleurs profiles (but with central cores and outer cutoffs), variable velocity ellipsoid structure, and extended dark halos are constructed. Spurious radial variations in M/L can occur when none are present if the properties of the galactic models are processed similar to observational data. Conversely, when a population of diffuse dark stellar matter is added near the galactic cores, large gradients in M/L can escape detection. However, the magnitude of the central velocity dispersion and its variation with projected radius within the effective radius both suggest that a component of dark stars is unlikely to be more massive than about 30 times the core mass of luminous stars. This restriction is important in establishing the initial mass function of stars in elliptical galaxies and the history of winds and cooling inflows in the interstellar medium. 35 references\n\nEvolution in time of an N-atom system.

We evaluate the isovector and the isoscalar, as well as the strange and the charm axial form factors. The disconnected contributions are evaluated using recently developed methods that include deflation of the lower eigenstates, allowing us to extract the isoscalar, strange, and charm axial form factors. We find that the disconnected quark loop contributions are nonzero and particularly large for the induced pseudoscalar form factor.\n\nExploring excited eigenstates of many-body systems using the functional renormalization group\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKlÃ¶ckner, Christian; Kennes, Dante Marvin; Karrasch, Christoph\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe introduce approximate, functional renormalization group based schemes to obtain correlation functions in pure excited eigenstates of large fermionic many-body systems at arbitrary energies. The algorithms are thoroughly benchmarked and their strengths and shortcomings are documented using a one-dimensional interacting tight-binding chain as a prototypical testbed.

The electron density, kinetic, and all interaction energies can be calculated using the QP wave functions. We prove in a simple way that the PE/IPE spectroscopy and therefore this QP theory can be applied to an arbitrary initial excited eigenstate. In this proof, we show that the energy-dependence of the self-energy is not an essential difficulty, and the QP picture holds exactly if there is no relaxation mechanism in the system. The validity of the present theory for some initial excited eigenstates is tested using the one-shot GW approximation for several atoms and molecules.\n\nInfluence of light-quark masses in dynamical scale breaking\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBarcelos Neto, J.; Chanda, R.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nIt is demonstrated that light quark masses may significantly contribute to the logarithmic scale breaking in deep inelastic electromagnetic lepton-nucleon scattering. This is mainly due to the combination of scale variables together with large 'current' masses for u and d quarks, recently reported in the literature. Upper limits for current masses of u and d quarks, using positivity properties of the forward electromagnetic structure function F 2 of the nucleon are also estimated.

For bosons of nonzero resting mass EPR-type entangled state can be achieved by the use of atomic beam splitters in particles of a position eigenstate and n-1 momentum eigenstates. For light field in which resting mass of the photon is zero, approximate EPR-type entanglement can be experimentally generated when we apply optical beam splitters to one position-squeezed coherence state and n-1 momentum-squeezed coherence states, this approximate version tends to perfect EPR entanglement in the limit of infinite squeezing\n\nSizable NSI from the SU(2){sub L} scalar doublet-singlet mixing and the implications in DUNE\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nForero, David V.

The mixing arises from a dimensionful coupling of the scalar doublet and singlet to the standard model Higgs boson. In light of the small mass, the light mass eigenstate from the doublet-singlet mixing can generate much larger NSI than those induced by the heavy eigenstate. We show that a sizable NSI Îµ{sub eÏ} (â¼0.3) can be attained without being excluded by a variety of experimental constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NSI can mimic effects of the Dirac CP phase in the neutrino mixing matrix but they can potentially be disentangled by future long-baseline neutrino experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).\n\nLight quark masses with Nf = 2 Wilson fermions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEicker, N.; Lippert, Th.; Orth, B.; Schilling, K.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nWe present new data on the mass of the light and strange quarks from SESAM/TÏL. The results were obtained on lattice-volumes of 16 3 x 32 and 24 3 x 40 points, with the possibility to investigate finite-size effects. Since the SESAM/TÏL ensembles at Î² = 5.6 have been complemented by configurations with Î² = 5.5, moreover, we are now able to attempt the continuum extrapolation (CE) of the quark masses with standard Wilson fermions\n\nLinear-Optical Generation of Eigenstates of the Two-Site XY Model\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nStefanie Barz\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Much of the anticipation accompanying the development of a quantum computer relates to its application to simulating dynamics of another quantum system of interest. Here, we study the building blocks for simulating quantum spin systems with linear optics. We experimentally generate the eigenstates of the XY Hamiltonian under an external magnetic field. The implemented quantum circuit consists of two cnot gates, which are realized experimentally by harnessing entanglement from a photon source and applying a cphase gate. We tune the ratio of coupling constants and the magnetic field by changing local parameters. This implementation of the XY model using linear quantum optics might open the door to future studies of quenching dynamics using linear optics.\n\nMasses of light quarks in quantum chromodynamics\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHubschmid, W; Mallik, S [Bern Univ. (Switzerland). Inst. fuer Theoretische Physik\n\n1982-12-28\n\nWe try to determine light quark masses by considering sum rules for the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered correlation function of two divergences of the axial vector current. The evaluation is carried out at momenta high enough for the non-perturbative contributions to be negligible. We find that the average mass of the up and down quark at a momentum of 1 GeV lies between 3.3 and 7.9 MeV while that for the strange quark lies between 84 and 212 MeV. The ranges of values reflect predominantly the uncertainty in the absorptive part in the low energy region (approx. <= 1.7 GeV).\n\nExquisite Nova Light Curves from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI)\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nHounsell, R.; Bode, M.

V.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nA semiclassical analysis of the high-energy eigenstates of Dirac fermions inside a graphene monolayer nanoribbon resonator of Fabry-Perot type in a magnetic field with zigzag boundary conditions is discussed. A semiclassical asymptotic method of construction of Maslov spectral series of energy spectrum and eigenfunctions, localized in an asymptotically small neighborhood of a periodic orbit, is developed for the graphene Dirac system. The isolated periodic orbit is confined between two flat boundaries. The analysis involves constructing a localized asymptotic solution to the Dirac system (electron-hole Gaussian beam). Then, the stability of a continuous family of periodic orbits (POs) confined between reflecting boundaries of the resonator is studied. The asymptotics of the eigenfunctions are constructed as a superposition of two Gaussian beams propagating in opposite directions between two reflecting points of the periodic orbit. The asymptotics of the energy spectrum are obtained by means of the generalized Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition only for stable POs. It provides two parts of semiclassical Maslov spectral series with positive and negative energies, for electrons and holes, correspondingly, with two different Hamiltonian dynamics and families of classical trajectories. The presence of electrostatic potential is vital as it makes a family of periodic orbit stable. For one subclass of lens-shaped periodic orbits, for a piecewise linear potential, localized eigenstates were computed numerically by the finite element method using COMSOL, and proved to be in very good agreement with the ones computed semiclassically.\n\nEigenstates of complex linear combinations of J1, J2, J3 for any representation of SU(2)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBacry, H.; Technion-Israel Inst. of Tech., Haifa.
