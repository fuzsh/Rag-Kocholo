        "text": "Very Large Telescope Interferometer observations of the dust geometry around R Coronae Borealis stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBright, S. N.; Chesneau, O.; Clayton, G. C.; De Marco, O.; LeÃ£o, I. C.; Nordhaus, J.; Gallagher, J. S.\n\n2011-06-01\n\nWe are investigating the formation and evolution of dust around the hydrogen-deficient supergiants known as R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars. We aim to determine the connection between the probable merger past of these stars and their current dust-production activities. We carried out high angular resolution interferometric observations of three RCB stars, namely RY Sgr, V CrA and V854 Cen, with the mid-infrared interferometer (MIDI) on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), using two telescope pairs. The baselines ranged from 30 to 60 m, allowing us to probe the dusty environment at very small spatial scales (Ë50 mas or 400Râ ). The observations of the RCB star dust environments were interpreted using both geometrical models and one-dimensional radiative transfer codes. From our analysis, we find that asymmetric circumstellar material is apparent in RY Sgr, may also exist in V CrA and is possible for V854 Cen. Overall, we find that our observations are consistent with dust forming in clumps ejected randomly around the RCB star so that over time they create a spherically symmetric distribution of dust. However, we conclude that the determination of whether there is a preferred plane of dust ejection must wait until a time series of observations are obtained. Based on observations made with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer at Paranal Observatory under programme 079.D-0415.\n\nImaging Stellar Surfaces with an Agile 12-Telescopes Visible Interferometer for the VLTI\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWoillez, Julien\n\n2018-04-01\n\nImaging stellar surfaces with an optical interferometer requires a large number of telescopes and the extensive use of the bootstrapping technique to reach the high spatial frequencies where the surface details are revealed. An idea would use all 6 dual-star delay lines of VLTI to deploy an agile 12-telescopes single-mode visible interferometer on the Paranal mountain. The concept relies on single-mode fiber technologies that have been demonstrated by the `OHANA and `OHANA IKI projects. We present the expected performance of this concept and explore its potential for the study of stellar surfaces.\n\nComputer simulations of interferometric imaging with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer and its Astronomical Multibeam Recombiner instrument\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPrzygodda, Frank; Bloecker, Thomas; Hofmann, Karl-Heinz; Weigelt, Gerd\n\n2001-05-01\n\nWe present computer simulations of interferometric imaging with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) of the European Southern Observatory and the Astronomical Multibeam Recombiner (AMBER) phase-closure instrument. These simulations include both the astrophysical modeling of a stellar object by radiative-transfer calculations and the simulation of light propagation from the object to the detector (through atmosphere, telescopes, and the AMBER instrument), simulation of photon noise and detector readout noise, and finally data processing of the interferograms. The results show the dependence of the visibility error bars on the following observational parameters: different seeing during the observation of object and reference star (Fried parameters r0,object and r0,ref ranging between 0.9 and 1.2 m), different residual tip-tilt error ((delta) tt,object and (delta) tt,ref ranging between 0.1% and 20% of the Airy-disk diameter), and object brightness (Kobject equals 0.7 to 10.2 mag, Kref equals 0.7 mag). As an example, we focus on stars in late stages of stellar evolution and study one of the key objects of that kind, the dusty super-giant IRC + 10420, which is rapidly evolving on human time scales. We show computer simulations of VLT interferometer (visibility and phase-closure measurements) of IRC + 10420 with two and three auxiliary telescopes (in AMBER wide-field mode, i.e., without fiber optic spatial filters) and discuss whether the visibility accuracy is sufficient to distinguish between different theoretical model predictions.\n\nInterferometers Sharpen Measurements for Better Telescopes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOver the last decade, there have been a number of innovations that have made possible the largest and most powerful telescope of its time: the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Scheduled to launch in 2018, JWST will provide insight into what the oldest, most distant galaxies look like. When engineers build a first-of-its-kind instrument like the JWST, they often must make new tools to construct the new technology. Throughout the decades of planning, development, and construction of the JWST, NASA has worked with numerous partners to spur innovations that have enabled the telescope s creation. Though the JWST s launch date is still several years away, a number of these innovations are spinning off to provide benefits here on Earth. One of these spinoffs has emerged from the extensive testing the JWST must undergo to ensure it will function in the extreme environment of space. In order to test the JWST instruments in conditions that closely resemble those in space, NASA uses a cryogenic vacuum chamber. By dropping the temperatures down to -400 F and employing powerful pumps to remove air from the chamber, engineers can test whether the JWST instruments will function once the spacecraft leaves Earth. Traditionally, a phase-shifting interferometer is used to measure optics like the JWST s mirrors to verify their precise shape, down to tens of nanometers, during manufacturing. However, the large size of the mirrors, coupled with vibration induced by the cryo-pumps, prohibits the use of traditional phase-shifting interferometers to measure the mirrors within the chamber environment. Because the JWST will be located in deep space, far from any possible manned service mission, it was essential to find a robust solution to guarantee the performance of the mirrors.\n\nInterferometry in the Era of Very Large Telescopes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarry, Richard K.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nResearch in modern stellar interferometry has focused primarily on ground-based observatories, with very long baselines or large apertures, that have benefited from recent advances in fringe tracking, phase reconstruction, adaptive optics, guided optics, and modern detectors. As one example, a great deal of effort has been put into development of ground-based nulling interferometers. The nulling technique is the sparse aperture equivalent of conventional coronography used in filled aperture telescopes. In this mode the stellar light itself is suppressed by a destructive fringe, effectively enhancing the contrast of the circumstellar material located near the star. Nulling interferometry has helped to advance our understanding of the astrophysics of many distant objects by providing the spatial resolution necessary to localize the various faint emission sources near bright objects. We illustrate the current capabilities of this technique by describing the first scientific results from the Keck Interferometer Nuller that combines the light from the two largest optical telescopes in the world including new, unpublished measurements of exozodiacal dust disks. We discuss prospects in the near future for interferometry in general, the capabilities of secondary masking interferometry on very large telescopes, and of nulling interferometry using outriggers on very large telescopes. We discuss future development of a simplified space-borne NIR nulling architecture, the Fourier-Kelvin Stellar Interferometer, capable of detecting and characterizing an Earth twin in the near future and how such a mission would benefit from the optical wavelength coverage offered by large, ground-based instruments.\n\nPartially Filled Aperture Interferometric Telescopes: Achieving Large Aperture and Coronagraphic Performance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoretto, G.; Kuhn, J.; Langlois, M.; Berdugyna, S.; Tallon, M.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTelescopes larger than currently planned 30-m class instruments must break the mass-aperture scaling relationship of the Keck-generation of multi-segmented telescopes. Partially filled aperture, but highly redundant baseline interferometric instruments may achieve both large aperture and high dynamic range. The PLANETS FOUNDATION group has explored hybrid telescope-interferometer concepts for narrow-field optical systems that exhibit coronagraphic performance over narrow fields-of-view. This paper describes how the Colossus and Exo-Life Finder telescope designs achieve 10x lower moving masses than current Extremely Large Telescopes.\n\nSimultaneous water vapor and dry air optical path length measurements and compensation with the large binocular telescope interferometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDefrÃ¨re, D.; Hinz, P.; Downey, E.; BÃ¶hm, M.; Danchi, W. C.; Durney, O.; Ertel, S.; Hill, J. M.; Hoffmann, W. F.; Mennesson, B.; Millan-Gabet, R.; Montoya, M.; Pott, J.-U.; Skemer, A.; Spalding, E.; Stone, J.; Vaz, A.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer uses a near-infrared camera to measure the optical path length variations between the two AO-corrected apertures and provide high-angular resolution observations for all its science channels (1.5-13 microns). There is however a wavelength dependent component to the atmospheric turbulence, which can introduce optical path length errors when observing at a wavelength different from that of the fringe sensing camera. Water vapor in particular is highly dispersive and its effect must be taken into account for high-precision infrared interferometric observations as described previously for VLTI/MIDI or the Keck Interferometer Nuller. In this paper, we describe the new sensing approach that has been developed at the LBT to measure and monitor the optical path length fluctuations due to dry air and water vapor separately. After reviewing the current performance of the system for dry air seeing compensation, we present simultaneous H-, K-, and N-band observations that illustrate the feasibility of our feedforward approach to stabilize the path length fluctuations seen by the LBTI nuller.\n\nEffect of telescope antenna diagram on the data acquisition in a stellar interferometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLongueteau, Emmanuel; Delage, Laurent; Reynaud, FranÃ§ois\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThis paper deals with the effect of the telescope size on accuracy of the data acquisition in a optical fibre linked stellar interferometer. In this context we introduce the concept of antenna diagram commonly used for microwaves antennae. This concept is essential to explain the contrasts and the phaseclosure acquisitions corruption in a stellar interferometer. The telescope pointing errors induces additional effects that are superimposed with the field limitation and could become critical.\n\nNulling Data Reduction and On-Sky Performance of the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDefrere, D.; Hinz, P. M.; Mennesson, B.; Hoffman, W. F.; Millan-Gabet, R.; Skemer, A. J.; Bailey, V.; Danchi, W. C.; Downy, E. C.; Durney, O.;\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) is a versatile instrument designed for high angular resolution and high-contrast infrared imaging (1.5-13 micrometers). In this paper, we focus on the mid-infrared (8-13 micrometers) nulling mode and present its theory of operation, data reduction, and on-sky performance as of the end of the commissioning phase in 2015 March. With an interferometric baseline of 14.4 m, the LBTI nuller is specifically tuned to resolve the habitable zone of nearby main-sequence stars, where warm exozodiacal dust emission peaks. Measuring the exozodi luminosity function of nearby main-sequence stars is a key milestone to prepare for future exo-Earth direct imaging instruments. Thanks to recent progress in wavefront control and phase stabilization, as well as in data reduction techniques, the LBTI demonstrated in 2015 February a calibrated null accuracy of 0.05% over a 3 hr long observing sequence on the bright nearby A3V star Beta Leo. This is equivalent to an exozodiacal disk density of 15-30 zodi for a Sun-like star located at 10 pc, depending on the adopted disk model. This result sets a new record for high-contrast mid-infrared interferometric imaging and opens a new window on the study of planetary systems.\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope primary mirror integration: testing the multiwavelength interferometer on the test bed telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOlczak, Gene; Fischer, David J.; Connelly, Mark; Wells, Conrad\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) integration includes a center of curvature test on its 18 primary mirror segment assemblies (PMSAs). This important test is the only ground test that will demonstrate the ability to align all 18 PMSAs. Using a multi-wavelength interferometer (MWIF) integrated to the test bed telescope (TBT), a one-sixth scale model of the JWST, we verify our ability to align and phase the 18 PMSAs. In this paper we will discuss data analysis and test results when using the MWIF to align the segments of the TBT in preparation for alignment of the JWST.\n\nFirst light for GRAVITY: Phase referencing optical interferometry for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGravity Collaboration; Abuter, R.; Accardo, M.; Amorim, A.; Anugu, N.; Ãvila, G.; Azouaoui, N.; Benisty, M.; Berger, J.

The instrument comprises fiber fed integrated optics beam combination, high resolution spectroscopy, built-in beam analysis and control, near-infrared wavefront sensing, phase-tracking, dual-beam operation, and laser metrology. GRAVITY opens up to optical/infrared interferometry the techniques of phase referenced imaging and narrow angle astrometry, in many aspects following the concepts of radio interferometry. This article gives an overview of GRAVITY and reports on the performance and the first astronomical observations during commissioning in 2015/16. We demonstrate phase-tracking on stars as faint as mK â 10 mag, phase-referenced interferometry of objects fainter than mK â 15 mag with a limiting magnitude of mK â 17 mag, minute long coherent integrations, a visibility accuracy of better than 0.25%, and spectro-differential phase and closure phase accuracy better than 0.5Â°, corresponding to a differential astrometric precision of better than ten microarcseconds (Î¼as). The dual-beam astrometry, measuring the phase difference of two objects with laser metrology, is still under commissioning. First observations show residuals as low as 50 Î¼as when following objects over several months. We illustrate the instrument performance with the observations of archetypical objects for the different instrument modes. Examples include the Galactic center supermassive black hole and its fast orbiting star S2 for phase referenced dual-beam observations and infrared wavefront sensing, the high mass X-ray binary BP Cru and the active galactic nucleus of PDS 456 for a few Î¼as spectro-differential astrometry, the T Tauri star S CrA for a spectro-differential visibility analysis, Î¾ Tel and 24 Cap for high accuracy visibility observations\n\nCo-Phasing the Large Binocular Telescope:. [Status and Performance of LBTI-PHASECam\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDefrere, D.; Hinz, P.; Downey, E.; Ashby, D.; Bailey, V.; Brusa, G.; Christou, J.; Danchi, W. C.; Grenz, P.; Hill, J. M.;\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer is a NASA-funded nulling and imaging instrument designed to coherently combine the two 8.4-m primary mirrors of the LBT for high-sensitivity, high-contrast, and high-resolution infrared imaging (1.5-13 micrometer). PHASECam is LBTI's near-infrared camera used to measure tip-tilt and phase variations between the two AO-corrected apertures and provide high-angular resolution observations. We report on the status of the system and describe its on-sky performance measured during the first semester of 2014. With a spatial resolution equivalent to that of a 22.8-meter telescope and the light-gathering power of single 11.8-meter mirror, the co-phased LBT can be considered to be a forerunner of the next-generation extremely large telescopes (ELT).\n\nSimultaneous Water Vapor and Dry Air Optical Path Length Measurements and Compensation with the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDefrere, D.; Hinz, P.; Downey, E.; Boehm, M.; Danchi, W.

The observing system must be able to detect faint planetary signals against the background of diffracted and scattered starlight, zodiacal light, and in the IR, mirror thermal radiation. As part of a JPL study, we concluded that the best long-term approach is a 10-20 m filled-aperture telescope operating in the thermal IR (10-15 microns). At these wavelengths, the star/planet flux ratio is on the order of 10(exp 6)-10(exp 8). Our study supports the work of Angel et al., who proposed a cooled 16-m IR telescope and a special apodization mask to suppress the stellar light within a limited angular region around the star. Our scheme differs in that it is capable of stellar suppression over a much broader field-of- view, enabling more efficient planet searches. To do this, certain key optical signal-processing components are needed, including a coronagraph to apodize the stellar diffraction pattern, an infrared interferometer to provide further starlight suppression, a complementary visible-wavelength interferometer to sense figure errors in the telescope optics, and a deformable mirror to adaptively compensate for these errors. Because of the central role of interferometry we have designated this concept the Interferometer-Based Imaging System (IBIS). IBIS incorporates techniques originally suggested by Ken Knight for extrasolar planet detection at visible wavelengths. The type of telescope discussed at this workshop is well suited to implementation of the IBIS concept.\n\nLarge Binocular Telescope Observations of Europa Occulting Io's Volcanoes at 4.8 Î¼m\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSkrutskie, Michael F.; Conrad, Albert; Resnick, Aaron; Leisenring, Jarron; Hinz, Phil; de Pater, Imke; de Kleer, Katherine; Spencer, John; Skemer, Andrew; Woodward, Charles E.; Davies, Ashley Gerard; DefrÃ©re, Denis\n\n2015-11-01\n\nOn 8 March 2015 Europa passed nearly centrally in front of Io. The Large Binocular Telescope observed this event in dual-aperture AO-corrected Fizeau interferometric imaging mode using the mid-infrared imager LMIRcam operating behind the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) at a broadband wavelength of 4.8 Î¼m (M-band). Occultation light curves generated from frames recorded every 123 milliseconds show that both Loki and Pele/Pillan were well resolved. Europa's center shifted by 2 kilometers relative to Io from frame-to-frame. The derived light curve for Loki is consistent with the double-lobed structure reported by Conrad et al. (2015) using direct interferometric imaging with LBTI.\n\nProspects for Observing Ultracompact Binaries with Space-Based Gravitational Wave Interferometers and Optical Telescopes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLittenberg, T. B.; Larson, S. L.; Nelemans, G.; Cornish, N. J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSpace-based gravitational wave interferometers are sensitive to the galactic population of ultracompact binaries. An important subset of the ultracompact binary population are those stars that can be individually resolved by both gravitational wave interferometers and electromagnetic telescopes. The aim of this paper is to quantify the multimessenger potential of space-based interferometers with arm-lengths between 1 and 5 Gm. The Fisher information matrix is used to estimate the number of binaries from a model of the Milky Way which are localized on the sky by the gravitational wave detector to within 1 and 10 deg(exp 2) and bright enough to be detected by a magnitude-limited survey.We find, depending on the choice ofGW detector characteristics, limiting magnitude and observing strategy, that up to several hundred gravitational wave sources could be detected in electromagnetic follow-up observations.\n\nNext Generation Instrumentation for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nQuirrenbach, A.\n\nThe scientific capabilities of the VLT Interferometer can be substantially enhanced through new focal-plane instruments. Many interferometric techniques - astrometry, phase-referenced imaging, nulling, and differential phase measurements - require control of the phase to <~ 1 rad; this capability will be provided at the VLTI by the PRIMA facility. Phase-coherent operation of the VLTI will also make it possible to perform interferometry with spectral resolution up to R ~ 100,000 by building fiber links to the high-resolution spectrographs UVES and CRIRES. These developments will open new approaches to fundamental problems in fields as diverse as extrasolar planets, stellar atmospheres, circumstellar matter, and active galactic nuclei.\n\nReal-time vibration compensation for large telescopes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBÃ¶hm, M.; Pott, J.-U.; Sawodny, O.; Herbst, T.; KÃ¼rster, M.\n\n2014-08-01\n\nWe compare different strategies for minimizing the effects of telescope vibrations to the differential piston (optical pathway difference) for the Near-InfraRed/Visible Adaptive Camera and INterferometer for Astronomy (LINC-NIRVANA) at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) using an accelerometer feedforward compensation approach. We summarize, why this technology is important for LINC-NIRVANA, and also for future telescopes and already existing instruments. The main objective is outlining a solution for the estimation problem in general and its specifics at the LBT. Emphasis is put on realistic evaluation of the used algorithms in the laboratory, such that predictions for the expected performance at the LBT can be made. Model-based estimation and broad-band filtering techniques can be used to solve the estimation task, and the differences are discussed. Simulation results and measurements are shown to motivate our choice of the estimation algorithm for LINC-NIRVANA. The laboratory setup is aimed at imitating the vibration behaviour at the LBT in general, and the M2 as main contributor in particular. For our measurements, we introduce a disturbance time series which has a frequency spectrum comparable to what can be measured at the LBT on a typical night. The controllers' ability to suppress vibrations in the critical frequency range of 8-60 Hz is demonstrated. The experimental results are promising, indicating the ability to suppress differential piston induced by telescope vibrations by a factor of about 5 (rms), which is significantly better than any currently commissioned system.\n\nMagdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer -- First Light with Telescope 1 and Progress to Fringes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCreech-Eakman, Michelle J.; Haniff, Chris A.; Buscher, David F.; Young, John S.; Payne, Ifan; Romero, Van D.; Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer Team\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer (MROI), a 10-telescope optical/near-IR interferometer in central NM has been conceived to be the most ambitious optical interferometric array under construction to date. With baselines ranging from 7.8 to 343 meters, and limiting magnitudes of 14 at K band, it will be able to assess many thousands of astronomical targets on spatial scales of 10's to 0.1's of milliarcseconds. After over a decade of funding from NRL and the major partner institutions (NM Tech and Cambridge University), new funding was obtained in late 2015 via a Cooperative Agreement between NM Tech and the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) to bring the facility to a three-interferometer system capable of observing geosynchronous satellites. However, we still maintain an exciting and compelling astronomical portfolio which will produce statistical samples of: YSOs and their surrounding disks, systems dominated by mass-loss and mass-transfer, pulsational stars and binary systems, and image the environs of AGN in nearby galaxies. An update on the status and plans for MROI for the next 3 years under the current Cooperative Agreement will be presented. In addition, we will present some examples of observational applications feasible with MROI both in the near-term and as we approach the full 10-telescope facility and describe how the astronomical community can become involved in this exciting project.We wish to acknowledge our sponsors in the NM Congressional Delegation and AFRL FA #9453-15-2-0086 for our recent support.\n\nLarge-aperture interferometer using local reference beam\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHowes, W. L.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nA large-aperture interferometer was devised by adding a local-reference-beam-generating optical system to a schlieren system. Two versions of the interferometer are demonstrated, one employing 12.7 cm (5 in.) diameter schlieren optics, the other employing 30.48 cm (12 in.) diameter parabolic mirrors in an off-axis system. In the latter configuration a cylindrical lens is introduced near the light source to correct for astigmatism. A zone plate is a satisfactory decollimating element in the reference-beam arm of the interferometer. Attempts to increase the flux and uniformity of irradiance in the reference beam by using a diffuser are discussed.\n\nThe Large Binocular Telescope's ARGOS ground-layer AO system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHart, M.; Rabien, S.; Busoni, L.; Barl, L.; Bechmann, U.; Bonaglia, M.; Boose, Y.; Borelli, J.; Bluemchen, T.; Carbonaro, L.; Connot, C.; Deysenroth, M.; Davies, R.; Durney, O.; Elberich, M.; Ertl, T.; Esposito, S.; Gaessler, W.; Gasho, V.; Gemperlein, H.; Hubbard, P.; Kanneganti, S.; Kulas, M.; Newman, K.; Noenickx, J.; Orban de Xivry, G.; Qirrenback, A.; Rademacher, M.; Schwab, C.; Storm, J.; Vaitheeswaran, V.; Weigelt, G.; Ziegleder, J.\n\n2011-09-01\n\nARGOS, the laser-guided adaptive optics system for the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), is now under construction at the telescope. By correcting atmospheric turbulence close to the telescope, the system is designed to deliver high resolution near infrared images over a field of 4 arc minute diameter. ARGOS is motivated by a successful prototype multi-laser guide star system on the 6.5 m MMT telescope, results from which are presented in this paper. At the LBT, each side of the twin 8.4 m aperture is being equipped with three Rayleigh laser guide stars derived from six 18 W pulsed green lasers and projected into two triangular constellations matching the size of the corrected field. The returning light is to be detected by wavefront sensors that are range gated within the seeinglimited depth of focus of the telescope. Wavefront correction will be introduced by the telescopeâs deformable secondary mirrors driven on the basis of the average wavefront errors computed from the respective guide star constellation. Measured atmospheric turbulence profiles from the site lead us to expect that by compensating the ground-layer turbulence, ARGOS will deliver median image quality of about 0.2 arc sec in the near infrared bands. This will be exploited by a pair of multi-object near-IR spectrographs, LUCI1 and LUCI2, each with 4 arc minute field already operating on the telescope. In future, ARGOS will also feed two interferometric imaging instruments, the LBT Interferometer operating in the thermal infrared, and LINC-NIRVANA, operating at visible and near infrared wavelengths. Together, these instruments will offer very broad spectral coverage at the diffraction limit of the LBTâs combined aperture, 23 m in size.\n\nSolar Confocal interferometers for Sub-Picometer-Resolution Spectral Filters\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGary, G. Allen; Pietraszewski, Chris; West, Edward A.; Dines. Terence C.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe confocal Fabry-Perot interferometer allows sub-picometer spectral resolution of Fraunhofer line profiles. Such high spectral resolution is needed to keep pace with the higher spatial resolution of the new set of large-aperture solar telescopes. The line-of-sight spatial resolution derived for line profile inversions would then track the improvements of the transverse spatial scale provided by the larger apertures. In particular, profile inversion allows improved velocity and magnetic field gradients to be determined independent of multiple line analysis using different energy levels and ions. The confocal interferometer's unique properties allow a simultaneous increase in both etendue and spectral power. The higher throughput for the interferometer provides significant decrease in the aperture, which is important in spaceflight considerations. We have constructed and tested two confocal interferometers. A slow-response thermal-controlled interferometer provides a stable system for laboratory investigation, while a piezoelectric interferometer provides a rapid response for solar observations. In this paper we provide design parameters, show construction details, and report on the laboratory test for these interferometers. The field of view versus aperture for confocal interferometers is compared with other types of spectral imaging filters. We propose a multiple etalon system for observing with these units using existing planar interferometers as pre-filters. The radiometry for these tests established that high spectral resolution profiles can be obtained with imaging confocal interferometers. These sub-picometer spectral data of the photosphere in both the visible and near-infrared can provide important height variation information. However, at the diffraction-limited spatial resolution of the telescope, the spectral data is photon starved due to the decreased spectral passband.\n\nStatus report on the Large Binocular Telescope's ARGOS ground-layer AO system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHart, M.; Rabien, S.; Busoni, L.; Barl, L.; Beckmann, U.; Bonaglia, M.; Boose, Y.; Borelli, J.

T.;\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe Balloon Experimental Twin Telescope for Infrared Interferometry (BETTII) is an 8-meter baseline far-infraredinterferometer designed to fly on a high altitude balloon. BETTII uses a double-Fourier Michelson interferometer tosimultaneously obtain spatial and spectral information on science targets; the long baseline permits subarcsecond angular resolution, a capability unmatched by other far-infrared facilities. Here, we present key aspects of the overall design of the mission and provide an overview of the current status of the project. We also discuss briefly the implications of this experiment for future space-based far-infrared interferometers.\n\nAGILIS: Agile Guided Interferometer for Longbaseline Imaging Synthesis. Demonstration and concepts of reconfigurable optical imaging interferometers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWoillez, Julien; Lai, Olivier; Perrin, Guy; Reynaud, FranÃ§ois; Baril, Marc; Dong, Yue; FÃ©dou, Pierre\n\n2017-06-01\n\nContext. In comparison to the radio and sub-millimetric domains, imaging with optical interferometry is still in its infancy. Due to the limited number of telescopes in existing arrays, image generation is a demanding process that relies on time-consuming reconfiguration of the interferometer array and super-synthesis. Aims: Using single mode optical fibres for the coherent transport of light from the collecting telescopes to the focal plane, a new generation of interferometers optimized for imaging can be designed. Methods: To support this claim, we report on the successful completion of the `OHANA Iki project: an end-to-end, on-sky demonstration of a two-telescope interferometer, built around near-infrared single mode fibres, carried out as part of the `OHANA project. Results: Having demonstrated that coherent transport by single-mode fibres is feasible, we explore the concepts, performances, and limitations of a new imaging facility with single mode fibres at its heart: Agile Guided Interferometer for Longbaseline Imaging Synthesis (AGILIS). Conclusions: AGILIS has the potential of becoming a next generation facility or a precursor to a much larger project like the Planet Formation Imager (PFI).\n\nSolar Confocal Interferometers for Sub-Picometer-Resolution Spectral Filters\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGary, G.

This is called 'blind operation' of the interferometer. This paper examines different options to achieve this, focusing on the application to the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). It is proposed that blind operation should be done using a so-called coherence autoguider, working on an unresolved star of magnitude V = 11-13 within the isoplanatic patch for coherencing, which has a diameter of about 1 deg. Estimates of limiting magnitudes for the VLTI are also derived.\n\nDeployable reflector configurations. [for space telescope\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMeinel, A. B.; Meinel, M. P.; Woolf, N. J.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nBoth the theoretical reasons for considering a non-circular format for the Large Deployable Reflector, and a potentially realizable concept for such a device, are discussed. The optimum systems for diffraction limited telescopes with incoherent detection have either a single filled aperture, or two such apertures as an interferometer to synthesize a larger aperture. For a single aperture of limited area, a reflector in the form of a slot can be used to give increased angular resolution. It is shown how a 20 x 8 meter telescope can be configured to fit the Space Shuttle bay, and deployed with relatively simple operations. The relationship between the sunshield design and the inclination of the orbit is discussed. The possible use of the LDR as a basic module to permit the construction of supergiant space telescopes and interferometers both for IR/submm studies and for the entire ultraviolet through mm wave spectral region is discussed.\n\nPSD Determination using a Simultaneous-Phase Acquisition Interferometer for the Constellation-X Spectroscopy X-ray Telescope (SXT) Mirrors\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLehan, J.

W.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWe investigated the use of a simultaneous-phase acquisition interferometer (a 4D FizCamTM 1500) for determining the PSD of the extremely-high aspect ratio (500: 1) glass mirrors for the Constellation-X SXT telescope. We found that the results obtained are strongly influenced by the methodology employed while collecting the data and outline a best method for this type of measurement.\n\nWorld atlas of large optical telescopes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMeszaros, S. P.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nBy 1980 there will be approximately 100 large optical telescopes in the world with mirror or lens diameters of one meter (39 inches) and larger. This atlas gives information on these telescopes and shows their locations on continent-sized maps. Observatory locations considered suitable for the construction of future large telescopes are also shown.\n\nSolar Rejection Filter for Large Telescopes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHemmati, Hamid; Lesh, James\n\n2009-01-01\n\nTo reject solar radiation photons at the front aperture for large telescopes, a mosaic of large transmission mode filters is placed in front of the telescope or at the aperture of the dome. Filtering options for effective rejection of sunlight include a smaller filter down-path near the focus of the telescope, and a large-diameter filter located in the front of the main aperture. Two types of large filters are viable: reflectance mode and transmittance mode. In the case of reflectance mode, a dielectric coating on a suitable substrate (e.g. a low-thermal-expansion glass) is arranged to reflect only a single, narrow wavelength and to efficiently transmit all other wavelengths. These coatings are commonly referred to as notch filter. In this case, the large mirror located in front of the telescope aperture reflects the received (signal and background) light into the telescope. In the case of transmittance mode, a dielectric coating on a suitable substrate (glass, sapphire, clear plastic, membrane, and the like) is arranged to transmit only a single wavelength and to reject all other wavelengths (visible and near IR) of light. The substrate of the large filter will determine its mass. At first glance, a large optical filter with a diameter of up to 10 m, located in front of the main aperture, would require a significant thickness to avoid sagging. However, a segmented filter supported by a structurally rugged grid can support smaller filters. The obscuration introduced by the grid is minimal because the total area can be made insignificant. This configuration can be detrimental to a diffraction- limited telescope due to diffraction effects at the edges of each sub-panel. However, no discernable degradation would result for a 20 diffraction-limit telescope (a photon bucket). Even the small amount of sagging in each subpanel should have minimal effect in the performance of a non-diffraction limited telescope because the part has no appreciable optical power. If the\n\nEuropean Extremely Large Telescope: progress report\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTamai, R.; Spyromilio, J.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThe European Extremely Large Telescope is a project of the European Southern Observatory to build and operate a 40-m class optical near-infrared telescope. The telescope design effort is largely concluded and construction contracts are being placed with industry and academic/research institutes for the various components. The siting of the telescope in Northern Chile close to the Paranal site allows for an integrated operation of the facility providing significant economies. The progress of the project in various areas is presented in this paper and references to other papers at this SPIE meeting are made.\n\nCircular common-path point diffraction interferometer.\n\nPubMed\n\nDu, Yongzhao; Feng, Guoying; Li, Hongru; Vargas, J; Zhou, Shouhuan\n\n2012-10-01\n\nA simple and compact point-diffraction interferometer with circular common-path geometry configuration is developed. The interferometer is constructed by a beam-splitter, two reflection mirrors, and a telescope system composed by two lenses. The signal and reference waves travel along the same path. Furthermore, an opaque mask containing a reference pinhole and a test object holder or test window is positioned in the common focal plane of the telescope system. The object wave is divided into two beams that take opposite paths along the interferometer. The reference wave is filtered by the reference pinhole, while the signal wave is transmitted through the object holder. The reference and signal waves are combined again in the beam-splitter and their interference is imaged in the CCD. The new design is compact, vibration insensitive, and suitable for the measurement of moving objects or dynamic processes.\n\nVINCI: the VLT Interferometer commissioning instrument\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKervella, Pierre; CoudÃ© du Foresto, Vincent; Glindemann, Andreas; Hofmann, Reiner\n\n2000-07-01\n\nThe Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) is a complex system, made of a large number of separated elements. To prepare an early successful operation, it will require a period of extensive testing and verification to ensure that the many devices involved work properly together, and can produce meaningful data. This paper describes the concept chosen for the VLTI commissioning instrument, LEONARDO da VINCI, and details its functionalities. It is a fiber based two-way beam combiner, associated with an artificial star and an alignment verification unit. The technical commissioning of the VLTI is foreseen as a stepwise process: fringes will first be obtained with the commissioning instrument in an autonomous mode (no other parts of the VLTI involved); then the VLTI telescopes and optical trains will be tested in autocollimation; finally fringes will be observed on the sky.\n\nMagdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer - New Path to First Light\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCreech-Eakman, Michelle J.; Payne, Ifan; Haniff, Chris; Buscher, David; Young, John; Romero, Van; Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer Team\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer (MROI), a 10-telescope optical/near-IR interferometer with baselines ranging from 7.8 to 343 meters, has been conceived to be the most ambitious optical/NIR interferometric array under construction to date. U.S. Congressional, N.M. State and university funding (from NM Tech and partner funding at the University of Cambridge) attained from 2000-13 provided for a nearly complete system design, installation of a large portion of the physical infrastructure at the Magdalena Ridge, the first telescope, delay line, fringe tracker and many other necessary sub-systems. New funding has recently been obtained under a cooperative agreement between NM Tech and the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) to bring the facility to three fully operational telescopes and associated hardware such that first fringes and closure phase will be realized within 5 years. The completed facility will be able to provide support for observing geosynchronous satellites as well as many exciting observations of astronomical targets. An update on the MROI status, plans moving forward for the next 5 years, and some examples of observational applications feasible at different phases of the array's completion will be presented.\n\nFirst Surface-resolved Results with the Infrared Optical Telescope Array Imaging Interferometer: Detection of Asymmetries in Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRagland, S.; Traub, W.

These nonzero closure phases can only be generated by asymmetric brightness distributions of the target stars or their surroundings. We discuss how these results were obtained and how they might be interpreted in terms of structures on or near the target stars. We also report measured angular sizes and hypothesize that most Mira stars would show detectable asymmetry if observed with adequate angular resolution.\n\nLarge Binocular Telescope project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHill, John M.; Salinari, Piero\n\n2000-08-01\n\nThe Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) Project is a collaboration between institutions in Arizona, Germany, Italy, and Ohio. The telescope will have two 8.4 meter diameter primary mirrors phased on a common mounting with a 22.8 meter baseline. The second of two borosilicate honeycomb primary mirrors for LBT is being case at the Steward Observatory Mirror Lab this year. The baseline optical configuration of LBT includes adaptive infrared secondaries of a Gregorian design. The F/15 secondaries are undersized to provide a low thermal background focal plane which is unvignetted over a 4 arcminute diameter field-of- view. The interferometric focus combining the light from the two 8.4 meter primaries will reimage the two folded Gregorian focal planes to three central locations. The telescope elevation structure accommodates swing arm spiders which allow rapid interchange of the various secondary and tertiary mirrors as well as prime focus cameras. Maximum stiffness and minimal thermal disturbance were important drivers for the design of the telescope in order to provide the best possible images for interferometric observations. The telescope structure accommodates installation of a vacuum bell jar for aluminizing the primary mirrors in-situ on the telescope. The telescope structure is being fabricated in Italy by Ansaldo Energia S.p.A. in Milan. After pre-erection in the factory, the telescope will be shipped to Arizona in early 2001. The enclosure is being built on Mt. Graham under the auspices of Hart Construction Management Services of Safford, Arizona. The enclosure will be completed by late 2001 and ready for telescope installation.\n\nObservation planning tools for the ESO VLT interferometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcKay, Derek J.; Ballester, Pascal; Vinther, Jakob\n\n2004-09-01\n\nNow that the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) is producing regular scientific observations, the field of optical interferometry has moved from being a specialist niche area into mainstream astronomy. Making such instruments available to the general community involves difficult challenges in modelling, presentation and automation. The planning of each interferometric observation requires calibrator source selection, visibility prediction, signal-to-noise estimation and exposure time calculation. These planning tools require detailed physical models simulating the complete telescope system - including the observed source, atmosphere, array configuration, optics, detector and data processing. Only then can these software utilities provide accurate predictions about instrument performance, robust noise estimation and reliable metrics indicating the anticipated success of an observation. The information must be presented in a clear, intelligible manner, sufficiently abstract to hide the details of telescope technicalities, but still giving the user a degree of control over the system. The Data Flow System group has addressed the needs of the VLTI and, in doing so, has gained some new insights into the planning of observations, and the modelling and simulation of interferometer performance. This paper reports these new techniques, as well as the successes of the Data Flow System group in this area and a summary of what is now offered as standard to VLTI observers.\n\nHigh resolution broad-band spectroscopy in the NIR using the Triplespec externally dispersed interferometer at the Hale telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nErskine, David J.; Edelstein, J.; Sirk, M.; Wishnow, E.; Ishikawa, Y.; McDonald, E.; Shourt, W. V.\n\n2014-07-01\n\nHigh resolution broad-band spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths has been performed using externally dis- persed interferometry (EDI) at the Hale telescope at Mt. Palomar. The EDI technique uses a field-widened Michelson interferometer in series with a dispersive spectrograph, and is able to recover a spectrum with a resolution 4 to 10 times higher than the existing grating spectrograph. This method increases the resolution well beyond the classical limits enforced by the slit width and the detector pixel Nyquist limit and, in principle, decreases the effect of pupil variation on the instrument line-shape function. The EDI technique permits arbi- trarily higher resolution measurements using the higher throughput, lower weight, size, and expense of a lower resolution spectrograph. Observations of many stars were performed with the TEDI interferometer mounted within the central hole of the 200 inch primary mirror. Light from the interferometer was then dispersed by the TripleSpec near-infrared echelle spectrograph. Continuous spectra between 950 and 2450 nm with a resolution as high as ~27,000 were recovered from data taken with TripleSpec at a native resolution of Ë2,700. Aspects of data analysis for interferometric spectral reconstruction are described. This technique has applications in im- proving measurements of high-resolution stellar template spectra, critical for precision Doppler velocimetry using conventional spectroscopic methods. A new interferometer to be applied for this purpose at visible wavelengths is under construction.\n\nWide-area phase-contrast X-ray imaging using large X-ray interferometers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMomose, Atsushi; Takeda, Tohoru; Yoneyama, Akio; Koyama, Ichiro; Itai, Yuji\n\n2001-07-01\n\nLarge X-ray interferometers are developed for phase-contrast X-ray imaging aiming at medical applications.

JWST is a segmented architecture telescope with an aperture of 6.6 m. It will operate at cryogenic temperature (40 K), achieved via passive cooling, in an orbit about the Earth-Sun second Lagrange point (L2). Passive cooling is facilitated by means of a large sunshield that provides thermal isolation and protection from direct illumination from the Sun. The large size of the telescope and spacecraft systems require that they are stowed for launch in a configuration that fits the Ariane 5 fairing, and then deployed after launch. Routine wavefront sensing and control measurements are used to achieve phasing of the segmented primary mirror and initial alignment of the telescope. A suite of instruments will provide the capability to observe over a spectral range from 0.6- to 27-micron wavelengths with imaging and spectroscopic configurations. An overview is presented of the architecture and selected optical design features of JWST are described\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMather, John C.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will extend the discoveries of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) by deploying a large cooled infrared telescope around the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L2. With a 6 m aperture and three instruments covering the wavelength range from 0.6 to 28 microns, it will provide sensitivities orders of magnitude better than any other facilities. It is intended to observe the light from the first galaxies and the first supernovae, the assembly of galaxies, and the formation and evolution of stars and planetary systems. In this talk I will review the scientific objectives and the ability of the system to meet them. I will close with a summary of possible future IR space missions, ranging from the far IR to planet-finding coronagraphs and interferometers\n\nLarge Binocular Telescope project\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHill, John M.; Salinari, Piero\n\n2003-02-01\n\nThe Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) Project is a collaboration between institutions in Arizona, Germany, Italy, and Ohio.

The second of the two 8.4-meter mirror blanks waits its turn in the polishing queue. The baseline optical configuration of LBT includes adaptive infrared secondaries of a Gregorian design. The F/15 secondaries are undersized to provide a low thermal background focal plane which is unvignetted over a 4-arcminute diameter field-of-view. These adaptive secondary mirrors with 672 voice-coil actuators are now in the early stages of fabrication. The interferometric focus combining the light from the two 8.4-meter primaries will reimage the two folded Gregorian focal planes to three central locations for phased array imaging. The telescope elevation structure accommodates swing arm spiders which allow rapid interchange of the various secondary and tertiary mirrors as well as prime focus cameras. The telescope structure accommodates installation of a vacuum bell jar for aluminizing the primary mirrors in-situ on the telescope. The telescope structure was fabricated and pre-assembled in Italy by Ansaldo-Camozzi in Milan. The structure was disassembled, packed and shipped to Arizona. The enclosure was built on Mt. Graham and is ready for telescope installation.\n\nBalloon Exoplanet Nulling Interferometer (BENI)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLyon, Richard G.; Clampin, Mark; Woodruff, Robert A.; Vasudevan, Gopal; Ford, Holland; Petro, Larry; Herman, Jay; Rinehart, Stephen; Carpenter, Kenneth; Marzouk, Joe\n\n2009-01-01\n\nWe evaluate the feasibility of using a balloon-borne nulling interferometer to detect and characterize exosolar planets and debris disks. The existing instrument consists of a 3-telescope Fizeau imaging interferometer with 3 fast steering mirrors and 3 delay lines operating at 800 Hz for closed-loop control of wavefront errors and fine pointing. A compact visible nulling interferometer is under development which when coupled to the imaging interferometer would in-principle allow deep suppression of starlight. We have conducted atmospheric simulations of the environment above 100,000 feet and believe balloons are a feasible path forward towards detection and characterization of a limited set of exoplanets and their debris disks. Herein we will discuss the BENI instrument, the balloon environment and the feasibility of such as mission.\n\nOperational metrics for the ESO Very Large Telescope: lessons learned and future steps\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPrimas, F.; Marteau, S.; Tacconi-Garman, L. E.; Mainieri, V.; Mysore, S.; Rejkuba, M.; Hilker, M.; Patat, F.; Sterzik, M.; Kaufer, A.; Mieske, S.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nWhen ESO's Very Large Telescope opened its first dome in April 1999 it was the first ground-based facility to offer to the scientific community access to an 8-10m class telescope with both classical and queue observing. The latter was considered to be the most promising way to ensure the observing flexibility necessary to execute the most demanding scientific programmes under the required, usually very well defined, conditions. Since then new instruments have become operational and 1st generation ones replaced, filling the 12 VLT foci and feeding the VLT Interferometer and its four Auxiliary Telescopes. Operating efficiently such a broad range of instruments installed and available every night of the year on four 8-metre telescopes offers many challenges. Although it may appear that little has changed since 1999, the underlying VLT operational model has evolved in order to accommodate different requirements from the user community and features of new instruments. Did it fulfil its original goal and, if so, how well? How did it evolve? What are the lessons learned after more than 15 years of operations? A careful analysis and monitoring of statistics and trends in Phase 1 and Phase 2 has been deployed under the DOME (Dashboard for Operational Metrics at ESO) project. The main goal of DOME is to provide robust metrics that can be followed with time in a user-friendly manner. Here, we summarize the main findings on the handling of service mode observations and present the most recent developments.\n\nLarge space telescope, phase A. Volume 3: Optical telescope assembly\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1972-01-01\n\nThe development and characteristics of the optical telescope assembly for the Large Space Telescope are discussed. The systems considerations are based on mission-related parameters and optical equipment requirements. Information is included on: (1) structural design and analysis, (2) thermal design, (3) stabilization and control, (4) alignment, focus, and figure control, (5) electronic subsystem, and (6) scientific instrument design.\n\nVery large Arecibo-type telescopes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDrake, Frank D.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe Arecibo-type radio telescope, based on a fixed spherical reflector, is a very effective design for a large radio telescope on the Moon. In such telescopes, major structural members are provided by the ground on which they are built, and thus are provided at no cost in materials or transportation. The strong compression members, the tall towers which support the suspended platform, are an expensive part of the Arecibo telescope. The need for such towers can be eliminated if a suitable valley or crater can be found wherein the rim of the depression can be used as the support point for the cables which support the suspended platform. With an Arecibo-type radio telescope on the Moon, there are no changing gravity loads because of the design and no changing wind loads because of the location; therefore, the only source of time variation in the telescope geometry is thermal changes. Calculations show that with conventional materials, such as steel, it should be possible to construct an Arecibo-type telescope with a reflector diameter of some 30 km on the Moon, and with a reflector diameter of some 60 to 90 km if materials of high specific strength are used.\n\nModified Fabry-Perot interferometer for displacement measurement in ultra large measuring range\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChang, Chung-Ping; Tung, Pi-Cheng; Shyu, Lih-Horng; Wang, Yung-Cheng; Manske, Eberhard\n\n2013-05-01\n\nLaser interferometers have demonstrated outstanding measuring performances for high precision positioning or dimensional measurements in the precision industry, especially in the length measurement. Due to the non-common-optical-path structure, appreciable measurement errors can be easily induced under ordinary measurement conditions. That will lead to the limitation and inconvenience for in situ industrial applications. To minimize the environmental and mechanical effects, a new interferometric displacement measuring system with the common-optical-path structure and the resistance to tilt-angle is proposed. With the integration of optomechatronic modules in the novel interferometric system, the resolution up to picometer order, high precision, and ultra large measuring range have been realized. For the signal stabilization of displacement measurement, an automatic gain control module has been proposed. A self-developed interpolation model has been employed for enhancing the resolution. The novel interferometer can hold the advantage of high resolution and large measuring range simultaneously. By the experimental verifications, it has been proven that the actual resolution of 2.5 nm can be achieved in the measuring range of 500 mm. According to the comparison experiments, the maximal standard deviation of the difference between the self-developed Fabry-Perot interferometer and the reference commercial Michelson interferometer is 0.146 Î¼m in the traveling range of 500 mm. With the prominent measuring characteristics, this should be the largest dynamic measurement range of a Fabry-Perot interferometer up till now.\n\nSubaperture test of wavefront error of large telescopes: error sources and stitching performance simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Shanyong; Li, Shengyi; Wang, Guilin\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe wavefront error of large telescopes requires to be measured to check the system quality and also estimate the misalignment of the telescope optics including the primary, the secondary and so on. It is usually realized by a focal plane interferometer and an autocollimator flat (ACF) of the same aperture with the telescope. However, it is challenging for meter class telescopes due to high cost and technological challenges in producing the large ACF. Subaperture test with a smaller ACF is hence proposed in combination with advanced stitching algorithms. Major error sources include the surface error of the ACF, misalignment of the ACF and measurement noises. Different error sources have different impacts on the wavefront error. Basically the surface error of the ACF behaves like systematic error and the astigmatism will be cumulated and enlarged if the azimuth of subapertures remains fixed. It is difficult to accurately calibrate the ACF because it suffers considerable deformation induced by gravity or mechanical clamping force. Therefore a selfcalibrated stitching algorithm is employed to separate the ACF surface error from the subaperture wavefront error. We suggest the ACF be rotated around the optical axis of the telescope for subaperture test. The algorithm is also able to correct the subaperture tip-tilt based on the overlapping consistency. Since all subaperture measurements are obtained in the same imaging plane, lateral shift of the subapertures is always known and the real overlapping points can be recognized in this plane. Therefore lateral positioning error of subapertures has no impact on the stitched wavefront. In contrast, the angular positioning error changes the azimuth of the ACF and finally changes the systematic error. We propose an angularly uneven layout of subapertures to minimize the stitching error, which is very different from our knowledge. At last, measurement noises could never be corrected but be suppressed by means of averaging and\n\nSPM interferometer with large range for mirco-vibration measurement\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFu, Mingyi; Tang, Chaowei; He, Guotian; Hu, Jun; Wang, Li\n\n2007-12-01\n\nThe measuring range and precision are two inconsistent parameters of traditional optical interferometry. In this paper, the interferometer measuring vibration with high precision and large range is proposed and its measuring principle is analyzed in detail. The interferometer obtains phase information by processing interference signals with two real-time phase discriminator and the vibration displacement could be gotten by expanding this phase. The measuring range was enlarged from half wavelength to millimeter. Meanwhile, the measuring precision was independent of external disturbance and vibration displacement measurement with high precision was realized. The measuring range of vibration displacement for 6000.5nm and the repeatable measuring precision was 5.72nm from experiment. The feasibility of the measuring method was validated by experiments.\n\nDevelopment of a Multi-frequency Interferometer Telescope for Radio Astronomy (MITRA)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIngala, Dominique Guelord Kumamputu\n\n2015-03-01\n\nThis dissertation describes the development and construction of the Multi-frequency Interferometer Telescope for Radio Astronomy (MITRA) at the Durban University of Technology. The MITRA station consists of 2 antenna arrays separated by a baseline distance of 8 m. Each array consists of 8 Log-Periodic Dipole Antennas (LPDAs) operating from 200 MHz to 800 MHz. The design and construction of the LPDA antenna and receiver system is described. The receiver topology provides an equivalent noise temperature of 113.1 K and 55.1 dB of gain. The Intermediate Frequency (IF) stage was designed to produce a fixed IF frequency of 800 MHz. The digital Back-End and correlator were implemented using a low cost Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform and Gnu-Radio software. Gnu-Octave was used for data analysis to generate the relevant received signal parameters including total power, real, and imaginary, magnitude and phase components. Measured results show that interference fringes were successfully detected within the bandwidth of the receiver using a Radio Frequency (RF) generator as a simulated source. This research was presented at the IEEE Africon 2013 / URSI Session Mauritius, and published in the proceedings.\n\nTelescopes in Near Space: Balloon Exoplanet Nulling Interferometer (BigBENI)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLyon, Richard G.; Clampin, Mark; Petrone, Peter; Mallik, Udayan; Mauk, Robin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA significant and often overlooked path to advancing both science and technology for direct imaging and spectroscopic characterization of exosolar planets is to fly \"near space\" missions, i.e. balloon borne exosolar missions. A near space balloon mission with two or more telescopes, coherently combined, is capable of achieving a subset of the mission science goals of a single large space telescope at a small fraction of the cost. Additionally such an approach advances technologies toward flight readiness for space flight. Herein we discuss the feasibility of flying two 1.2 meter telescopes, with a baseline separation of 3.6 meters, operating in visible light, on a composite boom structure coupled to a modified visible nulling coronagraph operating to achieve an inner working angle of 60 milli-arcseconds. We discuss the potential science return, atmospheric residuals at 135,000 feet, pointing control and visible nulling and evaluate the state-or-art of these technologies with regards to balloon missions.\n\nNear-Infrared Keck Interferometer and IOTA Closure Phase Observations of Wolf-Rayet stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRajagopal, J.; Wallace, D.; Barry, R.; Richardson, L. J.; Traub, W.; Danchi, W. C.\n\nWe present first results from observations of a small sample of IR-bright Wolf-Rayet stars with the Keck Interferometer in the near-infrared, and with the IONIC beam three-telescope beam combiner at the Infrared and Optical Telescope Array (IOTA) observatory. The former results were obtained as part of shared-risk observations in commissioning the Keck Interferometer and form a subset of a high-resolution study of dust around Wolf-Rayet stars using multiple interferometers in progress in our group. The latter results are the first closure phase observations of these stars in the near-infrared in a separated telescope interferometer. Earlier aperture-masking observations with the Keck-I telescope provide strong evidence that dust-formation in late-type WC stars are a result of wind-wind collision in short-period binaries.Our program with the Keck interferometer seeks to further examine this paradigm at much higher resolution. We have spatially resolved the binary in the prototypical dusty WC type star WR 140. WR 137, another episodic dust-producing star, has been partially resolved for the first time, providing the first direct clue to its possible binary nature.We also include WN stars in our sample to investigate circumstellar dust in this other main sub-type of WRs. We have been unable to resolve any of these, indicating a lack of extended dust.Complementary observations using the MIDI instrument on the VLTI in the mid-infrared are presented in another contribution to this workshop.\n\nA novel type of very long baseline astronomical intensity interferometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBorra, Ermanno F.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThis article presents a novel type of very long baseline astronomical interferometer that uses the fluctuations, as a function of time, of the intensity measured by a quadratic detector, which is a common type of astronomical detector. The theory on which the technique is based is validated by laboratory experiments. Its outstanding principal advantages comes from the fact that the angular structure of an astronomical object is simply determined from the visibility of the minima of the spectrum of the intensity fluctuations measured by the detector, as a function of the frequency of the fluctuations, while keeping the spacing between mirrors constant. This would allow a simple setup capable of high angular resolutions because it could use an extremely large baseline. Another major interest is that it allows for a more efficient use of telescope time because observations at a single baseline are sufficient, while amplitude and intensity interferometers need several observations at different baselines. The fact that one does not have to move the telescopes would also allow detecting faster time variations because having to move the telescopes sets a lower limit to the time variations that can be detected. The technique uses wave interaction effects and thus has some characteristics in common with intensity interferometry. A disadvantage of the technique, like in intensity interferometry, is that it needs strong sources if observing at high frequencies (e.g. the visible). This is a minor disadvantage in the radio region. At high frequencies, this disadvantage is mitigated by the fact that, like in intensity interferometry, the requirements of the optical quality of the mirrors used are far less severe than in amplitude interferometry so that poor quality large reflectors (e.g. Cherenkov telescopes) can be used in the optical region.\n\nA compact, large-range interferometer for precision measurement and inertial sensing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCooper, S. J.; Collins, C. J.; Green, A. C.; Hoyland, D.; Speake, C. C.; Freise, A.; Mow-Lowry, C. M.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe present a compact, fibre-coupled interferometer with high sensitivity and a large working range. We propose to use this interferometer as a readout mechanism for future inertial sensors, removing a major limiting noise source, and in precision positioning systems. The interferometerâs peak sensitivity is 2 Ã 10-{14} m \\\\sqrt{Hz-1} at 70 Hz and 7 Ã 10-{11} m \\\\sqrt{Hz-1} at 10 mHz. If deployed on a GS-13 geophone, the resulting inertial sensing output will be limited by the suspension thermal noise of the reference mass from 10 mHz to 2 Hz.\n\nThe Fourier-Kelvin Stellar Interferometer Mission Concept\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDanchi, W. C.; Allen, R.; Benford, D.; Gezari, D.; Leisawitz, D.; Mundy, L.; Oegerle, William (Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe Fourier-Kelvin Stellar Interferometer (FKSI) is a mission concept for an imaging interferometer for the mid-infrared spectral region (5-30 microns). FKSI is conceived as a scientific and technological precursor to TPF as well as Space Infrared Interferometric Telescope (SPIRIT), Submillimeter Probe Evolution of Cosmic Structure (SPECS), and Single Aperture for Infrared Observatory (SAFIR). It will also be a high angular resolution system complementary to Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). The scientific emphasis of the mission is on the evolution of protostellar systems, from just after the collapse of the precursor molecular cloud core, through the formation of the disk surrounding the protostar, the formation of planets in the disk, and eventual dispersal of the disk material. FKSI will also search for brown dwarfs and Jupiter mass and smaller planets, and could also play a very powerful role in the investigation of the structure of active galactic nuclei and extra-galactic star formation. We are in the process of studying alternative interferometer architectures and beam combination techniques, and evaluating the relevant science and technology tradeoffs. Some of the technical challenges include the development of the cryocooler systems necessary for the telescopes and focal plane array, light and stiff but well-damped truss systems to support the telescopes, and lightweight and coolable optical telescopes. The goal of the design study is to determine if a mid-infrared interferometry mission can be performed within the cost and schedule requirements of a Discovery class mission. At the present time we envision the FKSI as comprised of five one meter diameter telescopes arranged along a truss structure in a linear non-redundant array, cooled to 35 K. A maximum baseline of 20 meters gives a nominal resolution of 26 mas at 5 microns. Using a Fizeau beam combination technique, a simple focal plane camera could be used to obtain both Fourier and spectral\n\nEyeglass: A Very Large Aperture Diffractive Space Telescope\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHyde, R; Dixit, S; Weisberg, A\n\n2002-07-29\n\nEyeglass is a very large aperture (25-100 meter) space telescope consisting of two distinct spacecraft, separated in space by several kilometers. A diffractive lens provides the telescope's large aperture, and a separate, much smaller, space telescope serves as its mobile eyepiece. Use of a transmissive diffractive lens solves two basic problems associated with very large aperture space telescopes; it is inherently fieldable (lightweight and flat, hence packagable and deployable) and virtually eliminates the traditional, very tight, surface shape tolerances faced by reflecting apertures. The potential drawback to use of a diffractive primary (very narrow spectral bandwidth) is eliminated by correctivemoreÂ Â» optics in the telescope's eyepiece. The Eyeglass can provide diffraction-limited imaging with either single-band, multiband, or continuous spectral coverage. Broadband diffractive telescopes have been built at LLNL and have demonstrated diffraction-limited performance over a 40% spectral bandwidth (0.48-0.72 {micro}m). As one approach to package a large aperture for launch, a foldable lens has been built and demonstrated. A 75 cm aperture diffractive lens was constructed from 6 panels of 1 m thick silica; it achieved diffraction-limited performance both before and after folding. This multiple panel, folding lens, approach is currently being scaled-up at LLNL. We are building a 5 meter aperture foldable lens, involving 72 panels of 700 {micro}m thick glass sheets, diffractively patterned to operate as coherent f/50 lens.Â«Â less\n\nNational Large Solar Telescope of Russia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDemidov, Mikhail\n\nOne of the most important task of the modern solar physics is multi-wavelength observations of the small-scale structure of solar atmosphere on different heights, including chromosphere and corona. To do this the large-aperture telescopes are necessary. At present time there several challenging projects of the large (and even giant) solar telescopes in the world are in the process of construction or designing , the most known ones among them are 4-meter class telescopes ATST in USA and EST in Europe. Since 2013 the development of the new Large Solar Telescope (LST) with 3 meter diameter of the main mirror is started in Russia as a part (sub-project) of National Heliogeophysical Complex (NHGC) of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It should be located at the Sayan solar observatory on the altitude more then 2000 m. To avoid numerous problems of the off-axis optical telescopes (despite of the obvious some advantages of the off-axis configuration) and to meet to available financial budget, the classical on-axis Gregorian scheme on the alt-azimuth mount has been chosen. The scientific equipment of the LST-3 will include several narrow-band tunable filter devices and spectrographs for different wavelength bands, including infrared. The units are installed either at the Nasmyth focus or/and on the rotating coude platform. To minimize the instrumental polarization the polarization analyzer is located near diagonal mirror after M2 mirror. High order adaptive optics is used to achieve the diffraction limited performances. It is expected that after some modification of the optical configuration the LST-3 will operate as an approximately 1-m mirror coronograph in the near infrared spectral lines. Possibilities for stellar observations during night time are provided as well.\n\nThe study on servo-control system in the large aperture telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHu, Wei; Zhenchao, Zhang; Daxing, Wang\n\n2008-08-01\n\nLarge astronomical telescope or extremely enormous astronomical telescope servo tracking technique will be one of crucial technology that must be solved in researching and manufacturing. To control technique feature of large astronomical telescope or extremely enormous astronomical telescope, this paper design a sort of large astronomical telescope servo tracking control system. This system composes a principal and subordinate distributed control system, host computer sends steering instruction and receive slave computer functional mode, slave computer accomplish control algorithm and execute real-time control. Large astronomical telescope servo control use direct drive machine, and adopt DSP technology to complete direct torque control algorithm, Such design can not only increase control system performance, but also greatly reduced volume and costs of control system, which has a significant occurrence. The system design scheme can be proved reasonably by calculating and simulating. This system can be applied to large astronomical telescope.\n\nOptical phased array configuration for an extremely large telescope.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeinel, Aden Baker; Meinel, Marjorie Pettit\n\n2004-01-20\n\nExtremely large telescopes are currently under consideration by several groups in several countries. Extrapolation of current technology up to 30 m indicates a cost of over dollars 1 billion. Innovative concepts are being explored to find significant cost reductions. We explore the concept of an Optical Phased Array (OPA) telescope. Each element of the OPA is a separate Cassegrain telescope. Collimated beams from the array are sent via an associated set of delay lines to a central beam combiner. This array of small telescope elements offers the possibility of starting with a low-cost array of a few rings of elements, adding structure and additional Cass elements until the desired diameter telescope is attained. We address the salient features of such an extremely large telescope and cost elements relative to more conventional options.\n\nToward Large-Area Sub-Arcsecond X-Ray Telescopes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nO'Dell, Stephen L.; Aldcroft, Thomas L.; Allured, Ryan; Atkins, Carolyn; Burrows, David N.; Cao, Jian; Chalifoux, Brandon D.; Chan, Kai-Wing; Cotroneo, Vincenzo; Elsner, Ronald F.;\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe future of x-ray astronomy depends upon development of x-ray telescopes with larger aperture areas (>1 sq m) and finer angular resolution(<1).Combined with the special requirements of nested grazing incidence optics, the mass and envelope constraints of spaceborne telescopes render such advances technologically challenging. Achieving this goal will require precision fabrication, alignment, mounting, and assembly of large areas (>100 sq m) of lightweight (1 kg/sq m areal density) high quality mirrors-possibly entailing active (in-space adjustable) alignment and figure correction. This paper discusses relevant programmatic and technological issues and summarizes progress toward large area sub-arcsecond x-ray telescopes.

The initial scientific focus of BETTII is on clustered star formation, but this capability likely has a much broader scientific application.One critical step in developing an interferometer, such as BETTII, is the optical alignment of the system. We discuss how we determine alignment sensitivities of different optical elements on the interferogram outputs. Accordingly, an alignment plan is executed that makes use of a laser tracker and theodolites for precise optical metrology of both the large external optics and the small optics inside the cryostat. We test our alignment on the ground by pointing BETTII to bright near-infrared sources and obtaining their images in the tracking detectors.\n\nResults from a multi aperture Fizeau interferometer ground testbed: demonstrator for a future space-based interferometer\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaccichet, Nicola; Caillat, Amandine; Rakotonimbahy, Eddy; Dohlen, Kjetil; Savini, Giorgio; Marcos, Michel\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIn the framework of the European FP7-FISICA (Far Infrared Space Interferometer Critical Assessment) program, we developed a miniaturized version of the hyper-telescope to demonstrate multi-aperture interferometry on ground.

In this paper, we describe the optical design of the ground testbed and the data processing pipeline implemented to reconstruct the object image from interferometric data. As a scientific application, we measured the Sun diameter by fitting a limb-darkening model to our data. Finally, we present the design of a CubeSat platform carrying this miniature Fizeau interferometer, which could be used to monitor the Sun diameter over a long in-orbit period.\n\nWorld Atlas of large optical telescopes (second edition)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMeszaros, S.

In particular, this technology is necessary for the proposed large space telescope Single Aperture Far-Infrared Telescope (SAFIR) mission. This technology will also enhance the performance and lower the risk and cost for other cryogenic missions. The new paradigm for cooling to low temperatures will involve passive cooling using lightweight deployable membranes that serve both as sunshields and V-groove radiators, in combination with active cooling using mechanical coolers operating down to 4 K. The Cooling Technology for Large Space Telescopes (LST) mission planned to develop and demonstrate a multi-layered sunshield, which is actively cooled by a multi-stage mechanical cryocooler, and further the models and analyses critical to scaling to future missions. The outer four layers of the sunshield cool passively by radiation, while the innermost layer is actively cooled to enable the sunshield to decrease the incident solar irradiance by a factor of more than one million. The cryocooler cools the inner layer of the sunshield to 20 K, and provides cooling to 6 K at a telescope mounting plate. The technology readiness level (TRL) of 7 will be achieved by the active cooling technology following the technology validation flight in Low Earth Orbit. In accordance with the New Millennium charter, tests and modeling are tightly integrated to advance the technology and the flight design for \"ST-class\" missions. Commercial off-the-shelf engineering analysis products are used to develop validated modeling capabilities to allow the techniques and results from LST to apply to a wide variety of future missions. The LST mission plans to \"rewrite the book\" on cryo-thermal testing and modeling techniques, and validate modeling techniques to scale to future space telescopes such as SAFIR.\n\nResolving Io's Volcanoes from a Mutual Event Observation at the Large Binocular Telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Kleer, K.; Skrutskie, M.; Leisenring, J.; Davies, A. G.; Resnick, A.; Conrad, A.; De Pater, I.; Hinz, P.; Defrere, D.; Veillet, C.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nNear-infrared observations of Io during occultation by Jupiter and the other Galilean satellites have been central to ground-based studies of Io's volcanism for decades. When such observations are made using adaptive optics on 8-10m telescopes, the infrared emission from individual features can be resolved at a resolution approaching a few km on Io's surface. On March 8, 2015, the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) observed Io during a Europa mutual occultation event. Images were obtained at a wavelength of 4.8 microns every 123 milliseconds, corresponding to 2 km on Io's surface. The thermal emission from four hot spots including Loki Patera, Pillan Patera, and Kurdalagon Patera is clearly resolved. The latter two hot spots hosted bright eruptions in early 2015; the thermal emission from these sites likely represents the aftermath of those eruptions. The occultation light curves are used to construct a brightness temperature map for each of the four hot spots, from which the lava age is estimated using a model for cooling basaltic lavas. The thermal mapping of Loki Patera has produced the first-ever temperature map of the entire patera floor at high (10 km) spatial resolution, and the corresponding age distribution yields the resurfacing rate. For each hot spot, the age and spatial extent of the lava is interpreted in the context of its activity during the surrounding months.\n\nA 16-m Telescope for the Advanced Technology Large Aperture Telescope (ATLAST) Mission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLillie, Charles F.; Dailey, D. R.; Polidan, R. S.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFuture space observatories will require increasingly large telescopes to study the earliest stars and galaxies, as well as faint nearby objects. Technologies now under development will enable telescopes much larger than the 6.5-meter diameter James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to be developed at comparable costs. Current segmented mirror and deployable optics technology enables the 6.5 meter JWST telescope to be folded for launch in the 5-meter diameter Ariane 5 payload fairing, and deployed autonomously after reaching orbit. Late in the next decade, when the Ares V Cargo Launch Vehicle payload fairing becomes operational, even larger telescope can be placed in orbit. In this paper we present our concept for a 16-meter JWST derivative, chord-fold telescope which could be stowed in the 10-m diameter Ares V fairing, plus a description of the new technologies that enable ATLAST to be developed at an affordable price.\n\nAdvanced technology optical telescopes IV; Proceedings of the Meeting, Tucson, AZ, Feb. 12-16, 1990. Parts 1 & 2\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarr, Lawrence D. (Editor)\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe present conference on the current status of large, advanced-technology optical telescope development and construction projects discusses topics on such factors as their novel optical system designs, the use of phased arrays, seeing and site performance factors, mirror fabrication and testing, pointing and tracking techniques, mirror thermal control, structural design strategies, mirror supports and coatings, and the control of segmented mirrors. Attention is given to the proposed implementation of the VLT Interferometer, the first diffraction-limited astronomical images with adaptive optics, a fiber-optic telescope using a large cross-section image-transmitting bundle, the design of wide-field arrays, Hartmann test data reductions, liquid mirrors, inertial drives for telescope pointing, temperature control of large honeycomb mirrors, evaporative coatings for very large telescope mirrors, and the W. M. Keck telescope's primary mirror active control system software.\n\nLarge aperture diffractive space telescope\n\nDOEpatents\n\nHyde, Roderick A.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA large (10's of meters) aperture space telescope including two separate spacecraft--an optical primary objective lens functioning as a magnifying glass and an optical secondary functioning as an eyepiece. The spacecraft are spaced up to several kilometers apart with the eyepiece directly behind the magnifying glass \"aiming\" at an intended target with their relative orientation determining the optical axis of the telescope and hence the targets being observed. The objective lens includes a very large-aperture, very-thin-membrane, diffractive lens, e.g., a Fresnel lens, which intercepts incoming light over its full aperture and focuses it towards the eyepiece. The eyepiece has a much smaller, meter-scale aperture and is designed to move along the focal surface of the objective lens, gathering up the incoming light and converting it to high quality images. The positions of the two space craft are controlled both to maintain a good optical focus and to point at desired targets which may be either earth bound or celestial.\n\nLarge fully retractable telescope enclosures still closable in strong wind\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBettonvil, Felix C. M.; Hammerschlag, Robert H.; JÃ¤gers, Aswin P. L.; Sliepen, Guus\n\n2008-07-01\n\nTwo prototypes of fully retractable enclosures with diameters of 7 and 9 m have been built for the high-resolution solar telescopes DOT (Dutch Open Telescope) and GREGOR, both located at the Canary Islands. These enclosures protect the instruments for bad weather and are fully open when the telescopes are in operation. The telescopes and enclosures also operate in hard wind. The prototypes are based on tensioned membrane between movable but stiff bows, which fold together to a ring when opened. The height of the ring is small. The prototypes already survived several storms, with often snow and ice, without any damage, including hurricane Delta with wind speeds up to 68 m/s. The enclosures can still be closed and opened with wind speeds of 20 m/s without any problems or restrictions. The DOT successfully demonstrated the open, wind-flushing concept "
