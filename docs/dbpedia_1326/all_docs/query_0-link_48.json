        "meta_description": "Abstract. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with\nChemistry (WRF-Chem) is employed as an intercomparison tool for validating\nTROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite NO2 retrievals\nagainst high-resolution Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) remote sensing\nobservations performed in JuneÂ 2019 in the region of Antwerp, a major\nhotspot of NO2 pollution in Europe. The model is first evaluated using\nmeteorological and chemical observations in this area. Sensitivity\nsimulations varying the model planetary layer boundary (PBL)\nparameterization were conducted for a 3âd period in JuneÂ 2019, indicating\na generally good performance of most parameterizations against\nmeteorological data (namely ceilometer, surface meteorology, and balloon\nmeasurements), except for a moderate overestimation (â¼â1âmâsâ1) of near-surface wind speed. On average, all but one of the PBL schemes reproduce the surface NO2 measurements at stations of the Belgian Interregional Environmental Agency fairly well, although surface NO2 is generally underestimated during the day (between â4.3â% and â25.1â% on average) and overestimated at night (8.2â%â77.3â%). This discrepancy in the diurnal evolution arises despite (1) implementing a detailed representation of the diurnal cycle of emissions (Crippa et al., 2020) and (2) correcting the modeled concentrations to account for measurement interferences due to NOy reservoir species, which increases NO2 concentrations by about 20â% during the day. The model is further evaluated by comparing a 15âd simulation with surface NO2, NO, CO, and O3 data in the Antwerp region. The modeled daytime NO2 concentrations are more negatively biased during weekdays than during weekends, indicating a misrepresentation of the weekly temporal profile applied to the emissions obtained from Crippa et al.Â (2020). Using a mass balance approach, we determined a new weekly profile of NOx emissions, leading to a homogenization of the relative bias among the different weekdays. The ratio of weekend to weekday emissions is significantly lower in this updated profile (0.6) than in the profile based on Crippa et al.Â (2020; 0.84). Comparisons with remote sensing observations generally show a good reproduction of the spatial patterns of NO2 columns by the model. The\nmodel underestimated both APEX (by ca.Â â37â%) and TROPOMI columns (ca.Â â25â%) on 27Â June, whereas no significant bias is found on 29Â June. The\ntwo datasets are intercompared by using the model as an intermediate\nplatform to account for differences in vertical sensitivity through the\napplication of averaging kernels. The derived bias of TROPOMI v1.3.1\nNO2 with respect to APEX is about â10â% for columns between\n(6â12)âÃâ1015âmolec.âcmâ2. The obtained bias for TROPOMI v1.3.1 increases with the NO2 column, following CAPEX=1.217Cv1.3-0.783âÃâ1015âmolec.âcmâ2, in line with previous validation campaigns. The bias is slightly lower for the reprocessed TROPOMI v2.3.1, with CAPEX=1.055CPAL-0.437âÃâ1015âmolec.âcmâ2 (PAL). Finally, a mass balance approach was used to perform a crude inversion of\nNOx emissions based on 15âd averaged TROPOMI columns. The emission\ncorrection is conducted only in regions with high columns and high\nsensitivity to emission changes in order to minimize the errors due to wind\ntransport. The results suggest that emissions increase over BrusselsâAntwerp (+20â%), the Ruhr Valley (13â%), and especially Paris (+39â%), and emissions decrease above a cluster of power plants in western Germany.",

The natural ozone variability complicates detection of small trends. This study optimizes statistical model fit in the observational records by adding parameters that interpret seasonal and long-term changes in atmospheric circulation and airmass mixing which reduces uncertainties in detection of the stratospheric ozone recovery.\n\n5 years of Sentinel-5P TROPOMI operational ozone profiling and geophysical validation using ozonesonde and lidar ground-based networks\n\nArno Keppens, Serena Di Pede, Daan Hubert, Jean-Christopher Lambert, Pepijn Veefkind, Maarten Sneep, Johan De Haan, Mark ter Linden, Thierry Leblanc, Steven Compernolle, Tijl Verhoelst, JosÃ© Granville, Oindrila Nath, Ann Mari FjÃ¦raa, Ian Boyd, Sander Niemeijer, Roeland Van Malderen, Herman G.

This mission also produces atmospheric ozone profile data which are described in detail for May 2018 to April 2023. Independent validation using ground-based reference measurements demonstrates that the operational ozone profile product mostly fully and at least partially complies with all mission requirements.\n\nAnalysis of a newly homogenised ozonesonde dataset from Lauder, New Zealand\n\nGuang Zeng, Richard Querel, Hisako Shiona, Deniz Poyraz, Roeland Van Malderen, Alex Geddes, Penny Smale, Dan Smale, John Robinson, and Olaf Morgenstern\n\nAtmos.

We find that significant negative lower-stratospheric ozone trends identified at Lauder are associated with an increase in tropopause height and that CO2-driven dynamical changes have played an increasingly important role in driving ozone trends.\n\nConsistency evaluation of tropospheric ozone from ozonesonde and IAGOS aircraft observations: vertical distribution, ozonesonde types and station-airport distance\n\nHonglei Wang, David W.

In this study, we improved, updated, and validated the TOST from 1970 to 2021. Based on this TOST dataset, we characterized global ozone variations spatially in both the troposphere and stratosphere and temporally by season and decade. We also showed a stagnant stratospheric ozone variation since the late 1990s.\n\nBias correction of OMI HCHO columns based on FTIR and aircraft measurements and impact on top-down emission estimates\n\nJean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, Glenn-Michael Oomen, Beata Opacka, Isabelle De Smedt, Alex Guenther, Corinne Vigouroux, Bavo Langerock, Carlos Augusto Bauer Aquino, Michel Grutter, James Hannigan, Frank Hase, Rigel Kivi, Erik Lutsch, Emmanuel Mahieu, Maria Makarova, Jean-Marc Metzger, Isamu Morino, Isao Murata, Tomoo Nagahama, Justus Notholt, Ivan Ortega, Mathias Palm, Amelie RÃ¶hling, Wolfgang Stremme, Kimberly Strong, Ralf Sussmann, Yao TÃ©, and Alan Fried\n\nAtmos.

In this study, we quantify emissions of organic gases over Europe using high-quality satellite measurements of formaldehyde. These satellite observations suggest that emissions from vegetation are much higher than predicted by models, especially in southern Europe.\n\nNew insights from the JÃ¼lich Ozone Sonde Intercomparison Experiment: calibration functions traceable to one ozone reference instrument\n\nHerman G.

Comparing the new corrected ozonesonde profiles to an accurate ozone UV photometer (OPM) as reference allows us to evaluate the time response correction (TRC) method and to determine calibration functions traceable to one reference with 5 % uncertainty.\n\nIntercomparison of long-term ground-based measurements of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone at Lauder, New Zealand (45S)\n\nRobin BjÃ¶rklund, Corinne Vigouroux, Peter Effertz, Omaira Garcia, Alex Geddes, James Hannigan, Koji Miyagawa, Michael Kotkamp, Bavo Langerock, Gerald Nedoluha, Ivan Ortega, Irina Petropavlovskikh, Deniz Poyraz, Richard Querel, John Robinson, Hisako Shiona, Dan Smale, Penny Smale, Roeland Van Malderen, and Martine De MaziÃ¨re\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2668,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2668, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn intercomparison study is performed at Lauder between multiple ground-based measurements. We want to know why different trends have been observed in the stratosphere and. Also, the quality and relevance of tropospheric data sets need to be evaluated for trend studies. We analyze potential biases and drifts between Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, Dobson Umkehr, ozonesonde, lidar, microwave radiometer, Dobson total column ozone and Bentham ultraviolet double monochromator (UV2).\n\nGround-based Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) observations of NO2 and H2CO at Kinshasa and comparisons with TROPOMI observations\n\nRodriguez Yombo Phaka, Alexis Merlaud, Gaia Pinardi, Martina M.

The instrument records spectra of the scattered sunlight, from which we derive the abundances of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde, two important pollutants. We compare our ground-based measurements with those of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI).\n\nCharacterisations of Europe's integrated water vapour and assessments of atmospheric reanalyses using more than 2 decades of ground-based GPS\n\nPeng Yuan, Roeland Van Malderen, Xungang Yin, Hannes Vogelmann, Weiping Jiang, Joseph Awange, Bernhard Heck, and HansjÃ¶rg Kutterer\n\nAtmos.

However, due to its large spatiotemporal variability, its high-accuracy quantification remains a challenge. In this study, 20+ years of GPS-derived integrated water vapour (IWV) retrievals in Europe were obtained. They were then used to characterise the temporal features of Europe's IWV and assess six atmospheric reanalyses. Results show that ERA5 outperforms the other reanalyses at most temporal scales.\n\nValidation of Sentinel-5P TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 products by comparison with NO2 measurements from airborne imaging DOAS, ground-based stationary DOAS, and mobile car DOAS measurements during the S5P-VAL-DE-Ruhr campaign\n\nKezia Lange, Andreas Richter, Anja SchÃ¶nhardt, Andreas C.

The measurements are used to validate spaceborne NO2 data products from the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Auxiliary data of the TROPOMI NO2 retrieval, such as spatially higher resolved a priori NO2 vertical profiles, surface reflectivity, and cloud treatment are investigated to evaluate their impact.\n\nAn enhanced integrated water vapour dataset from more than 10 000Â global ground-based GPS stations inÂ 2020\n\nPeng Yuan, Geoffrey Blewitt, CornÃ© Kreemer, William C. Hammond, Donald Argus, Xungang Yin, Roeland Van Malderen, Michael Mayer, Weiping Jiang, Joseph Awange, and HansjÃ¶rg Kutterer\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

It contains more than 1 billion IWV estimates. The dataset is an enhanced version of the existing operational GPS IWV dataset from the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory. The enhancement is reached by using accurate meteorological information from ERA5 for the GPS IWV retrieval with a significantly higher spatiotemporal resolution. The dataset is recommended for high-accuracy applications.\n\nUpdated trends of the stratospheric ozone vertical distribution in the 60Â° Sâ60Â° N latitude range based on the LOTUS regression model\n\nSophie Godin-Beekmann, Niramson Azouz, Viktoria F.

Ozone increase in the upper stratosphere is confirmed, with significant trends at most latitudes. In this altitude region, a very good agreement is found with trends derived from chemistry–climate model simulations. Observed and modelled trends diverge in the lower stratosphere, but the differences are non-significant.\n\nAir quality impacts of COVID-19 lockdown measures detected from space using high spatial resolution observations of multiple trace gases from Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI\n\nPieternel F.

We also provide information for both experienced and inexperienced users about how we created the data using state-of-the-art algorithms, where to get the data, methods taking meteorological and seasonal variability into consideration, and insights for future studies.\n\nHorizontal distribution of tropospheric NO2 and aerosols derived by dual-scan multi-wavelength multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements in Uccle, Belgium\n\nErmioni Dimitropoulou, FranÃ§ois Hendrick, Martina Michaela Friedrich, Frederik Tack, Gaia Pinardi, Alexis Merlaud, Caroline Fayt, Christian Hermans, Frans Fierens, and Michel Van Roozendael\n\nAtmos.

We show that the combination of an appropriate sampling of TROPOMI pixels by ground-based measurements and an adequate a priori NO2 profile shape in TROPOMI retrievals improves the agreement between datasets.\n\nAnalysis of CO2, CH4, and CO surface and column concentrations observed at RÃ©union Island by assessing WRF-Chem simulations\n\nSieglinde Callewaert, JÃ©rÃ´me Brioude, Bavo Langerock, Valentin Duflot, Dominique Fonteyn, Jean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Jean-Marc Metzger, Christian Hermans, Nicolas Kumps, Michel Ramonet, Morgan Lopez, Emmanuel Mahieu, and Martine De MaziÃ¨re\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 7763–7792, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7763-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-7763-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA regional atmospheric transport model is used to analyze the factors contributing to CO2, CH4, and CO observations at RÃ©union Island. We show that the surface observations are dominated by local fluxes and dynamical processes, while the column data are influenced by larger-scale mechanisms such as biomass burning plumes. The model is able to capture the measured time series well; however, the results are highly dependent on accurate boundary conditions and high-resolution emission inventories.\n\nHomogenization of the Observatoire de Haute Provence electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesonde data record: comparison with lidar and satellite observations\n\nGÃ©rard Ancellet, Sophie Godin-Beekmann, Herman G. J. Smit, Ryan M. Stauffer, Roeland Van Malderen, Renaud Bodichon, and Andrea PazmiÃ±o\n\nAtmos. Meas.

Comparisons with ground-based instruments also measuring ozone at the same station (lidar, surface measurements) and with colocated satellite observations show the benefits of this homogenization. Remaining differences between ECC and other observations in the stratosphere are also discussed.\n\nCombined UV and IR ozone profile retrieval from TROPOMI and CrIS measurements\n\nNora Mettig, Mark Weber, Alexei Rozanov, John P.

The vertical resolution and accuracy of the ozone profiles are improved by combining both wavelength ranges compared to retrievals limited to UV or IR spectral data only. The advancement of our TOPAS algorithm for combined measurements is required because in the UV-only retrieval the vertical resolution in the troposphere is very limited.\n\nGlyoxal tropospheric column retrievals from TROPOMI â multi-satellite intercomparison and ground-based validation\n\nChristophe Lerot, FranÃ§ois Hendrick, Michel Van Roozendael, Leonardo M.

Such measurements can contribute to the estimation of atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds. This new glyoxal product has been fully characterized with a comprehensive error budget, with comparison with other satellite data sets as well as with validation based on independent ground-based remote sensing glyoxal observations.\n\nOrigin of water-soluble organic aerosols at the MaÃ¯do high-altitude observatory, RÃ©union Island, in the tropical Indian Ocean\n\nSharmine Akter Simu, Yuzo Miyazaki, Eri Tachibana, Henning Finkenzeller, JÃ©rÃ´me Brioude, AurÃ©lie Colomb, Olivier Magand, Bert Verreyken, Stephanie Evan, Rainer Volkamer, and Trissevgeni Stavrakou\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 17017–17029, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17017-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-17017-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe tropical Indian Ocean (IO) is expected to be a significant source of water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), which is relevant to cloud formation. Our study showed that marine secondary organic formation dominantly contributed to the aerosol WSOC mass at the high-altitude observatory in the southwest IO in the wet season in both marine boundary layer and free troposphere (FT). This suggests that the effect of marine secondary sources is important up to FT, a process missing in climate models.\n\nMeasurement report: Source apportionment of volatile organic compounds at the remote high-altitude MaÃ¯do observatory\n\nBert Verreyken, Crist Amelynck, Niels Schoon, Jean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, JÃ©rÃ´me Brioude, Nicolas Kumps, Christian Hermans, Jean-Marc Metzger, AurÃ©lie Colomb, and Trissevgeni Stavrakou\n\nAtmos.

We found that island-scale transport is an important driver for the daily cycle of VOC concentrations. During the day, surface emissions from the island affect the atmospheric composition at MaÃ¯do greatly, while at night this impact is strongly reduced.\n\nChanges in global air pollutant emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic: a dataset for atmospheric modeling\n\nThierno Doumbia, Claire Granier, Nellie Elguindi, Idir Bouarar, Sabine Darras, Guy Brasseur, Benjamin Gaubert, Yiming Liu, Xiaoqin Shi, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, Simone Tilmes, Forrest Lacey, Adrien Deroubaix, and Tao Wang\n\nEarth Syst.

We developed the CONFORM (COvid-19 adjustmeNt Factors fOR eMissions) dataset to account for changes in emissions during lockdowns. This dataset was created with the intention of being directly applicable to existing global and regional inventories used in chemical transport models.\n\nFifty years of balloon-borne ozone profile measurements at Uccle, Belgium: a short history, the scientific relevance, and the achievements in understanding the vertical ozone distribution\n\nRoeland Van Malderen, Dirk De Muer, Hugo De Backer, Deniz Poyraz, Willem W. Verstraeten, Veerle De Bock, Andy W. Delcloo, Alexander Mangold, Quentin Laffineur, Marc Allaart, Frans Fierens, and ValÃ©rie Thouret\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Since then, this measurement technique has barely changed, but the dense, long-term, and homogeneous Uccle dataset currently remains crucial for studying the temporal evolution of ozone from the surface to the stratosphere and is also the backbone of the validation of satellite ozone retrievals.\n\nGlobal and regional impacts of land cover changes on isoprene emissions derived from spaceborne data and the MEGAN model\n\nBeata Opacka, Jean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, Maite Bauwens, Katerina Sindelarova, Jana Markova, and Alex B. Guenther\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 8413–8436, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8413-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8413-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIsoprene is mainly emitted from plants, and about 80 % of its global emissions occur in the tropics. Current isoprene inventories are usually based on modelled vegetation maps, but high pressure on land use over the last decades has led to severe losses, especially in tropical forests, that are not considered by models. We provide a study on the present-day impact of spaceborne land cover changes on isoprene emissions and the first inventory based on high-resolution Landsat tree cover dataset.\n\nIdentification of atmospheric and oceanic teleconnection patterns in a 20-year global data set of the atmospheric water vapour column measured from satellites in the visible spectral range\n\nThomas Wagner, Steffen Beirle, Steffen DÃ¶rner, Christian Borger, and Roeland Van Malderen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 5315–5353, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5315-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-5315-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA global long-term (1995–2015) data set of total column water vapour (TCWV) derived from satellite observations is used to quantify the influence of teleconnections. Based on a newly developed empirical method more than 40 teleconnection indices are significantly detected in our global TCWV data set. After orthogonalisation, only 20 indices are left significant. The global distribution of the cumulative influence of teleconnection indices is strongest in the tropics and high latitudes.\n\nEvaluation of the LOTOS-EUROS NO2 simulations using ground-based measurements and S5P/TROPOMI observations over Greece\n\nIoanna Skoulidou, Maria-Elissavet Koukouli, Astrid Manders, Arjo Segers, Dimitris Karagkiozidis, Myrto Gratsea, Dimitris Balis, Alkiviadis Bais, Evangelos Gerasopoulos, Trisevgeni Stavrakou, Jos van Geffen, Henk Eskes, and Andreas Richter\n\nAtmos.

Comparison with in situ NO2 measurements shows a spatial correlation coefficient of 0.86, while the model underestimates the concentrations mostly during daytime (12 to 15:00 local time). Further, the simulated tropospheric NO2 columns are evaluated against ground-based MAX-DOAS NO2 measurements and S5P/TROPOMI observations for July and December 2018.\n\nAssessment of the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 product based on airborne APEX observations\n\nFrederik Tack, Alexis Merlaud, Marian-Daniel Iordache, Gaia Pinardi, Ermioni Dimitropoulou, Henk Eskes, Bart Bomans, Pepijn Veefkind, and Michel Van Roozendael\n\nAtmos. Meas.

The TROPOMI NO2 product meets the mission requirements in terms of precision and accuracy. However, we show that TROPOMI is biased low over polluted areas, mainly due to the limited spatial resolution of a priori input for the AMF computation.\n\nIntercomparison of MAX-DOAS vertical profile retrieval algorithms: studies on field data from the CINDI-2 campaign\n\nJan-Lukas Tirpitz, Udo FrieÃ, FranÃ§ois Hendrick, Carlos Alberti, Marc Allaart, Arnoud Apituley, Alkis Bais, Steffen Beirle, Stijn Berkhout, Kristof Bognar, Tim BÃ¶sch, Ilya Bruchkouski, Alexander Cede, Ka Lok Chan, Mirjam den Hoed, Sebastian Donner, Theano Drosoglou, Caroline Fayt, Martina M.

In this study, consistency and reliability of MAX-DOAS profiles are assessed by applying nine different evaluation algorithms to spectral data recorded during an intercomparison campaign in the Netherlands and by comparing the results to colocated supporting observations.\n\nCharacterisation of African biomass burning plumes and impacts on the atmospheric composition over the south-west Indian Ocean\n\nBert Verreyken, Crist Amelynck, JÃ©rÃ´me Brioude, Jean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Niels Schoon, Nicolas Kumps, AurÃ©lie Colomb, Jean-Marc Metzger, Christopher F.

We investigate (i) secondary production of volatile organic compounds during transport, (ii) efficacy of the CAMS model to reproduce the chemical makeup of BB plumes and (iii) the impact of BB on the remote marine boundary layer.\n\nA new method to correct the electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesonde time response and its implications for âbackground currentâ and pump efficiency\n\nHolger VÃ¶mel, Herman G. J. Smit, David Tarasick, Bryan Johnson, Samuel J. Oltmans, Henry Selkirk, Anne M. Thompson, Ryan M. Stauffer, Jacquelyn C. Witte, Jonathan Davies, Roeland van Malderen, Gary A. Morris, Tatsumi Nakano, and Rene StÃ¼bi\n\nAtmos. Meas.

Properly considering these time constants eliminates the need for a poorly defined \"background\" and allows reducing ad hoc corrections based on laboratory tests. This reduces the uncertainty of ECC ozonesonde measurements throughout the profile and especially in regions of low ozone and strong gradients of ozone.\n\nSatellite validation strategy assessments based on the AROMAT campaigns\n\nAlexis Merlaud, Livio Belegante, Daniel-Eduard Constantin, Mirjam Den Hoed, Andreas Carlos Meier, Marc Allaart, Magdalena Ardelean, Maxim Arseni, Tim BÃ¶sch, Hugues Brenot, Andreea Calcan, Emmanuel Dekemper, Sebastian Donner, Steffen DÃ¶rner, Mariana Carmelia Balanica Dragomir, Lucian Georgescu, Anca Nemuc, Doina Nicolae, Gaia Pinardi, Andreas Richter, Adrian Rosu, Thomas Ruhtz, Anja SchÃ¶nhardt, Dirk Schuettemeyer, Reza Shaiganfar, Kerstin Stebel, Frederik Tack, Sorin Nicolae VÃ¢jÃ¢iac, Jeni Vasilescu, Jurgen Vanhamel, Thomas Wagner, and Michel Van Roozendael\n\nAtmos.

They aimed to test airborne observation systems dedicated to air quality studies and to verify the concept of such campaigns in support of the validation of space-borne atmospheric missions. We show that airborne measurements of NO2 can be valuable for the validation of air quality satellites. For H2CO and SO2, the validation should involve ground-based measurement systems at key locations that the AROMAT measurements help identify.\n\nValidation of TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 columns using dual-scan multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements in Uccle, Brussels\n\nErmioni Dimitropoulou, FranÃ§ois Hendrick, Gaia Pinardi, Martina M.

Measuring tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) in different azimuthal directions has a positive effect on comparison with measurements from TROPOMI. We prove that the use of inadequate a priori NO2 profile shape data in the TROPOMI retrieval is responsible for the systematic underestimation of S5P NO2 data.\n\nIntercomparison of NO2, O4, O3 and HCHO slant column measurements by MAX-DOAS and zenith-sky UVâvisible spectrometers during CINDI-2\n\nKarin Kreher, Michel Van Roozendael, Francois Hendrick, Arnoud Apituley, Ermioni Dimitropoulou, Udo FrieÃ, Andreas Richter, Thomas Wagner, Johannes Lampel, Nader Abuhassan, Li Ang, Monica Anguas, Alkis Bais, Nuria Benavent, Tim BÃ¶sch, Kristof Bognar, Alexander Borovski, Ilya Bruchkouski, Alexander Cede, Ka Lok Chan, Sebastian Donner, Theano Drosoglou, Caroline Fayt, Henning Finkenzeller, David Garcia-Nieto, Clio Gielen, Laura GÃ³mez-MartÃ­n, Nan Hao, Bas Henzing, Jay R.

Here we report on the outcome of this intercomparison exercise. The three major goals were to characterise the differences between the participating instruments, to define a robust methodology for performance assessment, and to contribute to the harmonisation of the measurement settings and retrieval methods.\n\nNew constraints on biogenic emissions using satellite-based estimates of carbon monoxide fluxes\n\nHelen M. Worden, A. Anthony Bloom, John R. Worden, Zhe Jiang, Eloise A. Marais, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, Benjamin Gaubert, and Forrest Lacey\n\nAtmos. Chem.

However, there are large uncertainties in their role for climate. We present a Bayesian approach to estimate carbon monoxide fluxes that are chemically produced from biogenic sources. This provides independent constraints on models that predict biogenic emissions in order improve their capability for predicting air quality and future climate scenarios.\n\nChemistry and deposition in the Model of Atmospheric composition at Global and Regional scales using Inversion Techniques for Trace gas Emissions (MAGRITTEÂ v1.1) â Part 1: Chemical mechanism\n\nJean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, and Jozef Peeters\n\nGeosci.

The mechanism accounts for all major recent advances regarding isoprene oxidation. Evaluation against airborne measurements over the US demonstrates a good overall agreement. The mechanism incorporates newly-proposed pathways for formic and acetic acid formation, representing ~ 20 % of their global identified source.\n\nIntercomparison of four airborne imaging DOAS systems for tropospheric NO2 mapping â the AROMAPEX campaign\n\nFrederik Tack, Alexis Merlaud, Andreas C.

It relies on the species reactivity and water-solubility, for which a new prediction method is also presented. The deposition model parameters are adjusted based on comparisons with field data for ozone and organic compounds at numerous sites. The importance of dry deposition as a sink of oxygenated organic compounds and nitrogen oxides is demonstrated by global model simulations with the new deposition scheme.\n\nValidating the water vapour content from a reanalysis product and a regional climate model over Europe based on GNSS observations\n\nJulie Berckmans, Roeland Van Malderen, Eric Pottiaux, Rosa Pacione, and Rafiq Hamdi\n\nAtmos.

We used water vapour observations from 100 European sites to evaluate two models: a reanalysis product and a regional climate model. The results reveal patterns in the water vapour distribution both in time and space that are relevant as water vapour plays a key role in the feedback process of a changing climate.\n\nInterpreting the time variability of world-wide GPS and GOME/SCIAMACHY integrated water vapour retrievals, using reanalyses as auxiliary tools\n\nRoeland Van Malderen, Eric Pottiaux, Gintautas Stankunavicius, Steffen Beirle, Thomas Wagner, Hugues Brenot, and Carine Bruyninx\n\nAtmos.

In this work, HCHO time series have been determined in a harmonized way at 21 stations ensuring, in addition to a better spatial and level of abundances coverage, that internal biases within the network have been minimized. This data set shows consistent good agreement with model data and is ready for future satellite validation.\n\nRecent past (1979â2014) and future (2070â2099) isoprene fluxes over Europe simulated with the MEGANâMOHYCAN model\n\nMaite Bauwens, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, Jean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Bert Van Schaeybroeck, Lesley De Cruz, Rozemien De Troch, Olivier Giot, Rafiq Hamdi, Piet Termonia, Quentin Laffineur, Crist Amelynck, Niels Schoon, Bernard Heinesch, Thomas Holst, Almut Arneth, Reinhart Ceulemans, Arturo Sanchez-Lorenzo, and Alex Guenther\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 3673–3690, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-3673-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-3673-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBiogenic isoprene fluxes are simulated over Europe with the MEGAN–MOHYCAN model for the recent past and end-of-century climate at high spatiotemporal resolution (0.1°, 3 min). Due to climate change, fluxes increased by 40 % over 1979–2014. Climate scenarios for 2070–2099 suggest an increase by 83 % due to climate, and an even stronger increase when the potential impact of CO2 fertilization is considered (up to 141 %). Accounting for CO2 inhibition cancels out a large part of these increases.\n\nValidation of 10-year SAO OMI Ozone Profile (PROFOZ) product using ozonesonde observations\n\nGuanyu Huang, Xiong Liu, Kelly Chance, Kai Yang, Pawan K.

We validate the OMI Ozone Profile (PROFOZ) product from Oct 2004 to Dec 2014 against ozonesonde observations globally. Generally, OMI has good agreement with ozonesondes. The spatiotemporal variation of retrieval performance suggests the need to improve OMIâs radiometric calibration especially during the post-RA period to maintain the long-term stability.\n\nHigh-resolution mapping of the NO2 spatial distribution over Belgian urban areas based on airborne APEX remote sensing\n\nFrederik Tack, Alexis Merlaud, Marian-Daniel Iordache, Thomas Danckaert, Huan Yu, Caroline Fayt, Koen Meuleman, Felix Deutsch, Frans Fierens, and Michel Van Roozendael\n\nAtmos.

The tropospheric VCDs and vertical profiles of NO2, SO2 and HCHO derived from the MAX-DOAS are used to validate the products derived from OMI and GOME-2A/B by different scientific teams (daily- and bimonthly-averaged data). We investigate the effects of clouds, aerosols and a priori profile shapes on satellite retrievals of tropospheric VCDs.\n\nCharacterisation of Central-African aerosol and trace-gas emissions based on MAX-DOAS measurements and model simulations over Bujumbura, Burundi\n\nClio Gielen, FranÃ§ois Hendrick, Gaia Pinardi, Isabelle De Smedt, Caroline Fayt, Christian Hermans, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, Maite Bauwens, Jean-Francois MÃ¼ller, EugÃ¨ne Ndenzako, Pierre Nzohabonayo, Rachel Akimana, Sebastien Niyonzima, Michel Van Roozendael, and Martine De MaziÃ¨re\n\nAtmos.

We find that the aerosol and trace gas seasonal and daily variation is driven by the alternation of rain periods and dry periods associated with intense biomass burning in the vicinity of Bujumbura, and the influence of human activities in the city center.\n\nOn instrumental errors and related correction strategies of ozonesondes: possible effect on calculated ozone trends for the nearby sites Uccle and De Bilt\n\nRoeland Van Malderen, Marc A.

A remaining major issue today is if the onset of ozone recovery can be detected. Ozonesondes have provided vertical distribution of ozone with high vertical resolution for several decades. In this study, we investigate how different operating procedures at ozonesonde stations and different ozonesonde data correction strategies affect trends in ozone concentrations.\n\nNine years of global hydrocarbon emissions based on source inversion of OMI formaldehyde observations\n\nMaite Bauwens, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, Jean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Isabelle De Smedt, Michel Van Roozendael, Guido R. van der Werf, Christine Wiedinmyer, Johannes W.

Our results suggest changes in fire seasonal patterns, a stronger contribution of agricultural burning, overestimated isoprene flux rates in the tropics, overly decreased isoprene emissions due to soil moisture stress in arid areas, and enhanced isoprene trends.\n\nHCOOH distributions from IASI for 2008â2014: comparison with ground-based FTIR measurements and a global chemistry-transport model\n\nMatthieu Pommier, Cathy Clerbaux, Pierre-FranÃ§ois Coheur, Emmanuel Mahieu, Jean-FranÃ§ois MÃ¼ller, Clare Paton-Walsh, Trissevgeni Stavrakou, and Corinne Vigouroux\n\nAtmos.

The comparison of the data set with ground-based FTIR measurements and a CTM shows the interannual and the seasonal variation are well captured. Global distributions are provided, highlighting the long-range transport of tropospheric HCOOH over the oceans and the detection of source regions e.g. over India, USA, and Africa.\n\nGround-based assessment of the bias and long-term stability of 14 limb and occultation ozone profile data records\n\nDaan Hubert, Jean-Christopher Lambert, Tijl Verhoelst, JosÃ© Granville, Arno Keppens, Jean-Luc Baray, Adam E.

To this end, we made a comprehensive assessment of 14 limb/occultation profilers using ground-based reference data. The mutual consistency of satellite O3 in terms of bias, short-term variability and decadal stability is generally good over most of the stratosphere. However, we identified some exceptions that impact the quality of recently merged data sets and ozone trend assessments.\n\nSeasonality of isoprenoid emissions from a primary rainforest inÂ central Amazonia\n\nEliane G.

However, some satellite retrievals have suggested that ecophysiological processes may present seasonal variations mainly due to variation in light and leaf phenology in Amazonia. These in situ measurements are the first showing of a seasonal trend of volatile organic compound emissions, correlating with light and leaf phenology in Amazonia.\n\nDiurnal, seasonal and long-term variations of global formaldehyde columns inferred from combined OMI and GOME-2 observations\n\nI.

Validation results at seven stations in Europe, China and Africa confirm the capacity of the satellite measurements to resolve diurnal variations in H2CO columns. Furthermore, vertical profiles derived from MAX-DOAS measurements in Beijing and in Bujumbura are used for a more detailed validation exercise. Finally trends are estimated using 10 years of OMI observations.\n\nHow consistent are top-down hydrocarbon emissions based on formaldehyde observations from GOME-2 and OMI?\n\nT. Stavrakou, J.-F.

The resulting biogenic and pyrogenic fluxes from both optimizations show a very good degree of consistency. The isoprene fluxes are reduced globally by ca. 10%, and emissions from fires decrease by ca. 35%, compared to the prior. Anthropogenic emissions are weakly constrained except over China. Sensitivity inversions show robustness of the inferred fluxes.\n\nTropospheric nitrogen dioxide column retrieval from ground-based zenithâsky DOAS observations\n\nF. Tack, F. Hendrick, F.

The different steps are fully characterized and recommendations are given for each of them. The retrieval algorithm is applied on a 2-month ZS data set acquired during the CINDI campaign and on a 2-year data set acquired at the OHP NDACC station. The error budget assessment indicates that the overall error on the column values is less than 28%.\n\nRetrievals of formaldehyde from ground-based FTIR and MAX-DOAS observations at the Jungfraujoch station and comparisons with GEOS-Chem and IMAGES model simulations\n\nB.

Adjoint modeling enables computationally efficient gradient calculations. We present the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem unified chemistry extension (UCX). With this development, the GEOS-Chem adjoint model can capture stratospheric ozone and other processes jointly with tropospheric processes. We apply it to characterize the Antarctic ozone depletion potential of active halogen species.\n\nNew explicit formulae for the settling speed of prolate spheroids in the atmosphere: theoretical background and implementation in AerSett v2.0.2\n\nSylvain Mailler, Sotirios Mallios, Arineh Cholakian, Vassilis Amiridis, Laurent Menut, and Romain Pennel\n\nGeosci.

The first formulation is based on theoretical arguments only, while the second one is based on computational fluid dynamics calculations. We show that the first method is suitable for virtually all atmospheric aerosols, provided their shape can be adequately described as a prolate spheroid, and we provide an implementation of the first method in AerSett v2.0.2.\n\nZJU-AERO V0.5: an Accurate and Efficient Radar Operator designed for CMA-GFS/MESO with the capability to simulate non-spherical hydrometeors\n\nHejun Xie, Lei Bi, and Wei Han\n\nGeosci.

However, developing an advanced radar operator is challenging due to various complexities associated with the wave scattering by non-spherical hydrometeors, radar beam propagation, and multiple platforms. In this study, we introduce a novel radar operator named the Accurate and Efficient Radar Operator developed by ZheJiang University (ZJU-AERO) which boasts several unique features.\n\nThe Year of Polar Prediction site Model Intercomparison Project (YOPPsiteMIP) phase 1: project overview and Arctic winter forecast evaluation\n\nJonathan J.

HCHO is a crucial intermediate in the chemical catalytic cycle that governs the ozone formation in the troposphere. The model was capable of replicating the observed spatiotemporal variability in HCHO. In a few cases, the model's capability was limited. This is attributed to the uncertainties in the observations and the model parameters.\n\nGlobal variable-resolution simulations of extreme precipitation over Henan, China, in 2021 with MPAS-Atmosphere v7.3\n\nZijun Liu, Li Dong, Zongxu Qiu, Xingrong Li, Huiling Yuan, Dongmei Meng, Xiaobin Qiu, Dingyuan Liang, and Yafei Wang\n\nGeosci.

We found the different performance of two built-in parameterization scheme suites (mesoscale and convection-permitting suites) with global quasi-uniform and variable-resolution meshes. This study holds significant implications for advancing the understanding of the scale-aware capability of MPAS-Atmosphere.\n\nThe CHIMERE chemistry-transport model v2023r1\n\nLaurent Menut, Arineh Cholakian, Romain Pennel, Guillaume Siour, Sylvain Mailler, Myrto Valari, Lya Lugon, and Yann Meurdesoif\n\nGeosci.

This version contains both computational and physico-chemical changes. The computational changes make it easy to choose the variables to be extracted as a result, including values of maximum sub-hourly concentrations. Performance tests show that the model is 1.5 to 2 times faster than the previous version for the same setup. Processes such as turbulence, transport schemes and dry deposition have been modified and updated.\n\ntobac v1.5: introducing fast 3D tracking, splits and mergers, and other enhancements for identifying and analysing meteorological phenomena\n\nG.

Here, we present the latest version of tobac, v1.5, which substantially improves scientific capabilities and computational efficiency from the previous version. These enhancements permit new uses for tobac in atmospheric science and potentially other fields.\n\nMerged Observatory Data Files (MODFs): an integrated observational data product supporting process-oriented investigations and diagnostics\n\nTaneil Uttal, Leslie M.

The MODF format is also designed to be applied to model output data, yielding format-matching Merged Model Data Files (MMDFs). MODFs plus MMDFs will augment and accelerate the synergistic use of model results with observational data to increase understanding and predictive skill.\n\nSimulation of marine stratocumulus using the super-droplet method: numerical convergence and comparison to a double-moment bulk scheme using SCALE-SDM 5.2.6-2.3.1\n\nChongzhi Yin, Shin-ichiro Shima, Lulin Xue, and Chunsong Lu\n\nGeosci.

Aerosol processes can be accurately simulated using SDM, and this may be an important factor affecting the behavior and morphology of marine stratocumulus.\n\nWRF-Comfort: simulating microscale variability in outdoor heat stress at the city scale with a mesoscale model\n\nAlberto Martilli, Negin Nazarian, E.

This tool can have multiple applications, from early warnings of extreme heat to the vulnerable population to the evaluation of the effectiveness of heat mitigation strategies. It is the first model that includes information on microscale variability in a mesoscale model, something that is essential for fully evaluating heat stress.\n\nRepresenting effects of surface heterogeneity in a multi-plume eddy diffusivity mass flux boundary layer parameterization\n\nNathan P. Arnold\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 5041–5056, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5041-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5041-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEarth system models often represent the land surface at smaller scales than the atmosphere, but surface–atmosphere coupling uses only aggregated surface properties. This study presents a method to allow heterogeneous surface properties to modify boundary layer updrafts. The method is tested in single column experiments. Updraft properties are found to reasonably covary with surface conditions, and simulated boundary layer variability is enhanced over more heterogeneous land surfaces.\n\nCan TROPOMI NO2 satellite data be used to track the drop in and resurgence of NOx emissions in Germany between 2019â2021 using the multi-source plume method (MSPM)?\n\nEnrico Dammers, Janot Tokaya, Christian Mielke, Kevin Hausmann, Debora Griffin, Chris McLinden, Henk Eskes, and Renske Timmermans\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4983–5007, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4983-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4983-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrogen dioxide (NOx) is produced by sources such as industry and traffic and is directly linked to negative impacts on health and the environment. The current construction of emission inventories to keep track of NOx emissions is slow and time-consuming. Satellite measurements provide a way to quickly and independently estimate emissions. In this study, we apply a consistent methodology to derive NOx emissions over Germany and illustrate the value of having such a method for fast projections.\n\nA spatiotemporally separated framework for reconstructing the sources of atmospheric radionuclide releases\n\nYuhan Xu, Sheng Fang, Xinwen Dong, and Shuhan Zhuang\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4961–4982, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4961-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4961-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecent atmospheric radionuclide leakages from unknown sources have posed a new challenge in nuclear emergency assessment. Reconstruction via environmental observations is the only feasible way to identify sources, but simultaneous reconstruction of the source location and release rate yields high uncertainties. We propose a spatiotemporally separated reconstruction strategy that avoids these uncertainties and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with respect to accuracy and uncertainty ranges.\n\nA parameterization scheme for the floating wind farm in a coupled atmosphereâwave model (COAWST v3.7)\n\nShaokun Deng, Shengmu Yang, Shengli Chen, Daoyi Chen, Xuefeng Yang, and Shanshan Cui\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4891–4909, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4891-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4891-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal offshore wind power development is moving from offshore to deeper waters, where floating offshore wind turbines have an advantage over bottom-fixed turbines. However, current wind farm parameterization schemes in mesoscale models are not applicable to floating turbines. We propose a floating wind farm parameterization scheme that accounts for the attenuation of the significant wave height by floating turbines. The results indicate that it has a significant effect on the power output.\n\nRoadSurf 1.1: open-source road weather model library\n\nVirve Eveliina Karsisto\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4837–4853, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4837-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4837-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRoadSurf is an open-source library that contains functions from the Finnish Meteorological Institute’s road weather model. The evaluation of the library shows that it is well suited for making road surface temperature forecasts. The evaluation was done by making forecasts for about 400 road weather stations in Finland with the library. Accurate forecasts help road authorities perform salting and plowing operations at the right time and keep roads safe for drivers.\n\nCalibrating and validating the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) urban cooling model: case studies in France and the United States\n\nPerrine Hamel, MartÃ­ Bosch, LÃ©a Tardieu, Aude Lemonsu, CÃ©cile de Munck, Chris Nootenboom, Vincent ViguiÃ©, Eric Lonsdorf, James A. Douglass, and Richard P. Sharp\n\nGeosci.

We further developed an algorithm to facilitate model calibration and evaluation. Applying the algorithm to case studies in France and in the United States, we found that nighttime air temperature estimates compare well with reference datasets. Estimated change in temperature from a land cover scenario compares well with an alternative model estimate, supporting the use of the model for urban planning decisions.\n\nThe ddeq Python library for point source quantification from remote sensing images (version 1.0)\n\nGerrit Kuhlmann, Erik Koene, Sandro Meier, Diego Santaren, GrÃ©goire Broquet, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier, Janne Hakkarainen, Janne Nurmela, Laia AmorÃ³s, Johanna Tamminen, and Dominik Brunner\n\nGeosci.

It can be used to determine the emissions of hot spots (cities, power plants and industry) from remote sensing images using different methods. ddeq can be extended for new datasets and methods, providing a powerful community tool for users and developers. The application of the methods is shown using Jupyter notebooks included in the library.\n\nIncorporating Oxygen Isotopes of Oxidized Reactive Nitrogen in the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism, version 2 (ICOIN-RACM2)\n\nWendell W. Walters, Masayuki Takeuchi, Nga L. Ng, and Meredith G. Hastings\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4673–4687, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4673-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4673-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study introduces a novel chemical mechanism for explicitly tracking oxygen isotope transfer in oxidized reactive nitrogen and odd oxygen using the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism, version 2. This model enhances our ability to simulate and compare oxygen isotope compositions of reactive nitrogen, revealing insights into oxidation chemistry. The approach shows promise for improving atmospheric chemistry models and tropospheric oxidation capacity predictions.\n\nA general comprehensive evaluation method for cross-scale precipitation forecasts\n\nBing Zhang, Mingjian Zeng, Anning Huang, Zhengkun Qin, Couhua Liu, Wenru Shi, Xin Li, Kefeng Zhu, Chunlei Gu, and Jialing Zhou\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4579–4601, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4579-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4579-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy directly analyzing the proximity of precipitation forecasts and observations, a precipitation accuracy score (PAS) method was constructed. This method does not utilize a traditional contingency-table-based classification verification; however, it can replace the threat score (TS), equitable threat score (ETS), and other skill score methods, and it can be used to calculate the accuracy of numerical models or quantitative precipitation forecasts.\n\nImplementation of a Simple Actuator Disk for Large-Eddy Simulation in the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-SADLES v1.2) for wind turbine wake simulation\n\nHai Bui, Mostafa Bakhoday-Paskyabi, and Mohammadreza Mohammadpour-Penchah\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4447–4465, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4447-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4447-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a new wind turbine wake model, the Simple Actuator Disc for Large Eddy Simulation (SADLES), integrated with the widely used Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF-SADLES accurately simulates wind turbine wakes at resolutions of a few dozen meters, aligning well with idealized simulations and observational measurements. This makes WRF-SADLES a promising tool for wind energy research, offering a balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation.\n\nWRF-PDAF v1.0: implementation and application of an online localized ensemble data assimilation framework\n\nChangliang Shao and Lars Nerger\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4433–4445, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4433-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4433-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper introduces and evaluates WRF-PDAF, a fully online-coupled ensemble data assimilation (DA) system. A key advantage of the WRF-PDAF configuration is its ability to concurrently integrate all ensemble states, eliminating the need for time-consuming distribution and collection of ensembles during the coupling communication. The extra time required for DA amounts to only 20.6 % per cycle. Twin experiment results underscore the effectiveness of the WRF-PDAF system.\n\nImplementation and evaluation of diabatic advection in the Lagrangian transport model MPTRAC 2.6\n\nJan Clemens, Lars Hoffmann, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Sabine GrieÃbach, and Nicole Thomas\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4467–4493, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4467-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4467-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLagrangian transport models simulate the transport of air masses in the atmosphere. For example, one model (CLaMS) is well suited to calculating transport as it uses a special coordinate system and special vertical wind. However, it only runs inefficiently on modern supercomputers. Hence, we have implemented the benefits of CLaMS into a new model (MPTRAC), which is already highly efficient on modern supercomputers. Finally, in extensive tests, we showed that CLaMS and MPTRAC agree very well.\n\nAn improved and extended parameterization of the CO2 15 Âµm cooling in the middle and upper atmosphere (CO2_cool_fort-1.0)\n\nManuel LÃ³pez-Puertas, Federico Fabiano, Victor Fomichev, Bernd Funke, and Daniel R. Marsh\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4401–4432, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4401-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4401-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe radiative infrared cooling of CO2 in the middle atmosphere is crucial for computing its thermal structure. It requires one however to include non-local thermodynamic equilibrium processes which are computationally very expensive, which cannot be afforded by climate models. In this work, we present an updated, efficient, accurate and very fast (~50 µs) parameterization of that cooling able to cope with CO2 abundances from half the pre-industrial values to 10 times the current abundance.\n\nDevelopment of a multiphase chemical mechanism to improve secondary organic aerosol formation in CAABA/MECCA (version 4.7.0)\n\nFelix Wieser, Rolf Sander, Changmin Cho, Hendrik Fuchs, Thorsten Hohaus, Anna Novelli, Ralf Tillmann, and Domenico Taraborrelli\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4311–4330, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4311-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4311-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe chemistry scheme of the atmospheric box model CAABA/MECCA is expanded to achieve an improved aerosol formation from emitted organic compounds. In addition to newly added reactions, temperature-dependent partitioning of all new species between the gas and aqueous phases is estimated and included in the pre-existing scheme. Sensitivity runs show an overestimation of key compounds from isoprene, which can be explained by a lack of aqueous-phase degradation reactions and box model limitations.\n\nApplication of regional meteorology and air quality models based on the microprocessor without interlocked piped stages (MIPS) and LoongArch CPU platforms\n\nZehua Bai, Qizhong Wu, Kai Cao, Yiming Sun, and Huaqiong Cheng\n\nGeosci.

The MIPS architecture CPUs, a type of RISC CPUs, have distinct advantages in energy efficiency and scalability. The air quality modeling system can run stably on the MIPS and LoongArch platforms, and the experiment results verify the stability of scientific computing on the platforms. The work provides a technical foundation for the scientific application based on MIPS and LoongArch.\n\nInvestigating ground-level ozone pollution in semi-arid and arid regions of Arizona using WRF-Chem v4.4 modeling\n\nYafang Guo, Chayan Roychoudhury, Mohammad Amin Mirrezaei, Rajesh Kumar, Armin Sorooshian, and Avelino F. Arellano\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4331–4353, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4331-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4331-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis research focuses on surface ozone (O3) pollution in Arizona, a historically air-quality-challenged arid and semi-arid region in the US. The unique characteristics of this kind of region, e.g., intense heat, minimal moisture, and persistent desert shrubs, play a vital role in comprehending O3 exceedances. Using the WRF-Chem model, we analyzed O3 levels in the pre-monsoon month, revealing the model's skill in capturing diurnal and MDA8 O3 levels.\n\nAn objective identification technique for potential vorticity structures associated with African easterly waves\n\nChristoph Fischer, Andreas H. Fink, Elmar SchÃ¶mer, Marc Rautenhaus, and Michael Riemer\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4213–4228, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4213-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4213-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents a method for identifying and tracking 3-D potential vorticity structures within African easterly waves (AEWs). Each identified structure is characterized by descriptors, including its 3-D position and orientation, which have been validated through composite comparisons. A trough-centric perspective on the descriptors reveals the evolution and distinct characteristics of AEWs. These descriptors serve as valuable statistical inputs for the study of AEW-related phenomena.\n\nImportance of microphysical settings for climate forcing by stratospheric SO2 injections as modeled by SOCOL-AERv2\n\nSandro Vattioni, Andrea Stenke, Beiping Luo, Gabriel Chiodo, Timofei Sukhodolov, Elia Wunderlin, and Thomas Peter\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4181–4197, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4181-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4181-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the sensitivity of aerosol size distributions in the presence of strong SO2 injections for climate interventions or after volcanic eruptions to the call sequence and frequency of the routines for nucleation and condensation in sectional aerosol models with operator splitting. Using the aerosol–chemistry–climate model SOCOL-AERv2, we show that the radiative and chemical outputs are sensitive to these settings at high H2SO4 supersaturations and how to obtain reliable results.\n\nAssessment of surface ozone products from downscaled CAMS reanalysis and CAMS daily forecast using urban air quality monitoring stations in Iran\n\nNajmeh Kaffashzadeh and Abbas-Ali Aliakbari Bidokhti\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4155–4179, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4155-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4155-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper assesses the capability of two state-of-the-art global datasets in simulating surface ozone over Iran using a new methodology. It is found that the global model data need to be downscaled for regulatory purposes or policy applications at local scales. The method can be useful not only for the evaluation but also for the prediction of other chemical species, such as aerosols.\n\nOpen boundary conditions for atmospheric large-eddy simulations and their implementation in DALES4.4\n\nFranciscus Liqui Lung, Christian Jakob, A. Pier Siebesma, and Fredrik Jansson\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4053–4076, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4053-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4053-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTraditionally, high-resolution atmospheric models employ periodic boundary conditions, which limit simulations to domains without horizontal variations. In this research open boundary conditions are developed to replace the periodic boundary conditions. The implementation is tested in a controlled setup, and the results show minimal disturbances. Using these boundary conditions, high-resolution models can be forced by a coarser model to study atmospheric phenomena in realistic background states.\n\nEfficient and stable coupling of the SuperdropNet deep-learning-based cloud microphysics (v0.1.0) with the ICON climate and weather model (v2.6.5)\n\nCaroline Arnold, Shivani Sharma, Tobias Weigel, and David S. Greenberg\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 4017–4029, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4017-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4017-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn atmospheric models, rain formation is simplified to be computationally efficient. We trained a machine learning model, SuperdropNet, to emulate warm-rain formation based on super-droplet simulations. Here, we couple SuperdropNet with an atmospheric model in a warm-bubble experiment and find that the coupled simulation runs stable and produces reasonable results, making SuperdropNet a viable ML proxy for droplet simulations. We also present a comprehensive benchmark for coupling architectures.\n\nThree-dimensional variational assimilation with a multivariate background error covariance for the Model for Prediction Across Scales â Atmosphere with the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI-MPAS 2.0.0-beta)\n\nByoung-Joo Jung, Benjamin MÃ©nÃ©trier, Chris Snyder, Zhiquan Liu, Jonathan J. Guerrette, Junmei Ban, Ivette HernÃ¡ndez BaÃ±os, Yonggang G. Yu, and William C. Skamarock\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3879–3895, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3879-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3879-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe the multivariate static background error covariance (B) for the JEDI-MPAS 3D-Var data assimilation system. With tuned B parameters, the multivariate B gives physically balanced analysis increment fields in the single-observation test framework. In the month-long cycling experiment with a global 60 km mesh, 3D-Var with static B performs stably. Due to its simple workflow and minimal computational requirements, JEDI-MPAS 3D-Var can be useful for the research community.\n\nFUME 2.0 â Flexible Universal processor for Modeling Emissions\n\nMichal Belda, Nina BeneÅ¡ovÃ¡, Jaroslav Resler, Peter HuszÃ¡r, OndÅej VlÄek, Pavel KrÄ, Jan KarlickÃ½, Pavel JuruÅ¡, and KryÅ¡tof Eben\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3867–3878, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3867-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3867-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor modeling atmospheric chemistry, it is necessary to provide data on emissions of pollutants. These can come from various sources and in various forms, and preprocessing of the data to be ingestible by chemistry models can be quite challenging. We developed the FUME processor to use a database layer that internally transforms all input data into a rigid structure, facilitating further processing to allow for emission processing from the continental to the street scale.\n\nDEUCE v1.0: a neural network for probabilistic precipitation nowcasting with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties\n\nBent Harnist, Seppo Pulkkinen, and Terhi MÃ¤kinen\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3839–3866, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3839-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3839-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nProbabilistic precipitation nowcasting (local forecasting for 0–6 h) is crucial for reducing damage from events like flash floods. For this goal, we propose the DEUCE neural-network-based model which uses data and model uncertainties to generate an ensemble of potential precipitation development scenarios for the next hour. Trained and evaluated with Finnish precipitation composites, DEUCE was found to produce more skillful and reliable nowcasts than established models.\n\nEvaluation of multi-season convection-permitting atmosphere â mixed-layer ocean simulations of the Maritime Continent\n\nEmma Howard, Steven Woolnough, Nicholas Klingaman, Daniel Shipley, Claudio Sanchez, Simon C. Peatman, Cathryn E. Birch, and Adrian J. Matthews\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3815–3837, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3815-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3815-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes a coupled atmosphere–mixed-layer ocean simulation setup that will be used to study weather processes in Southeast Asia. The set-up has been used to compare high-resolution simulations, which are able to partially resolve storms, to coarser simulations, which cannot. We compare the model performance at representing variability of rainfall and sea surface temperatures across length scales between the coarse and fine models.\n\nInvestigating the impact of coupling HARMONIE-WINS50 (cy43) meteorology to LOTOS-EUROS (v2.2.002) on a simulation of NO2 concentrations over the Netherlands\n\nAndrÃ©s Yarce Botero, Michiel van Weele, Arjo Segers, Pier Siebesma, and Henk Eskes\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3765–3781, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3765-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3765-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHARMONIE WINS50 reanalysis data with 0.025° × 0.025° resolution from 2019 to 2021 were coupled with the LOTOS-EUROS Chemical Transport Model. HARMONIE and ECMWF meteorology configurations against Cabauw observations (52.0° N, 4.9° W) were evaluated as simulated NO2 concentrations with ground-level sensors. Differences in crucial meteorological input parameters (boundary layer height, vertical diffusion coefficient) between the hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models were analysed.\n\nBalloon drift estimation and improved position estimates for radiosondes\n\nUlrich Voggenberger, Leopold Haimberger, Federico Ambrogi, and Paul Poli\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3783–3799, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3783-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3783-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a method for calculating balloon drift from historical radiosonde ascent data. The drift can reach distances of several hundred kilometres and is often neglected. Verification shows the beneficial impact of the more accurate balloon position on model assimilation. The method is not limited to radiosondes but would also work for dropsondes, ozonesondes, or any other in situ sonde carried by the wind in the pre-GNSS era, provided the necessary information is available.\n\nEmission ensemble approach to improve the development of multi-scale emission inventories\n\nPhilippe Thunis, Jeroen Kuenen, Enrico Pisoni, Bertrand Bessagnet, Manjola Banja, Lech Gawuc, Karol Szymankiewicz, Diego Guizardi, Monica Crippa, Susana Lopez-Aparicio, Marc Guevara, Alexander De Meij, Sabine Schindlbacher, and Alain Clappier\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3631–3643, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3631-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3631-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn ensemble emission inventory is created with the aim of monitoring the status and progress made with the development of EU-wide inventories. This emission ensemble serves as a common benchmark for the screening and allows for the comparison of more than two inventories at a time. Because the emission “truth” is unknown, the approach does not tell which inventory is the closest to reality, but it identifies inconsistencies that require special attention.\n\nWhat is the relative impact of nudging and online coupling on meteorological variables, pollutant concentrations an"
