        "meta_description": "Abstract. We investigate the potential of the Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide (CO2)\nMonitoring (CO2M) mission, a proposed constellation of CO2 imaging satellites, to estimate\nthe CO2 emissions of a city on the example of Berlin, the capital of Germany. On average,\nBerlin emits about 20âMtâCO2âyrâ1 during satellite overpass (11:30âLT). The\nstudy uses synthetic satellite observations of a constellation of up to six satellites generated\nfrom 1Â year of high-resolution atmospheric transport simulations. The emissions were estimated\nby (1)Â an analytical atmospheric inversion applied to the plume of Berlin simulated by the same\nmodel that was used to generate the synthetic observations and (2)Â a mass-balance approach that\nestimates the CO2 flux through multiple cross sections of the city plume detected by a\nplume detection algorithm. The plume was either detected from CO2 observations alone or\nfrom additional nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations on the same platform. The two\napproaches were set up to span the range between (i)Â the optimistic assumption of a perfect transport\nmodel that provides an accurate prediction of plume location and CO2 background and (ii)Â the\npessimistic assumption that plume location and background can only be determined reliably from the\nsatellite observations. Often unfavorable meteorological conditions allowed us to successfully apply\nthe analytical inversion to only 11Â out of 61Â overpasses per satellite per year on average. From a\nsingle overpass, the instantaneous emissions of Berlin could be estimated with an average\nprecision of 3.0 to 4.2âMtâyrâ1 (15â%â21â% of emissions during overpass)\ndepending on the assumed instrument noise ranging from 0.5 to 1.0âppm. Applying the mass-balance approach required the detection of a sufficiently large plume, which on average was only\npossible on three overpasses per satellite per year when using CO2 observations for plume\ndetection. This number doubled to six estimates when the plumes were detected from NO2\nobservations due to the better signal-to-noise ratio and lower sensitivity to clouds of the\nmeasurements. Compared to the analytical inversion, the mass-balance approach had a lower\nprecision ranging from 8.1 to 10.7âMtâyrâ1 (40â% to 53â%), because it is\naffected by additional uncertainties introduced by the estimation of the location of the plume,\nthe CO2 background field, and the wind speed within the plume. These uncertainties also\nresulted in systematic biases, especially without the NO2 observations. An additional\nsource of bias was non-separable fluxes from outside of Berlin. Annual emissions were estimated\nby fitting a low-order periodic spline to the individual estimates to account for the seasonal\nvariability of the emissions, but we did not account for the diurnal cycle of emissions, which is\nan additional source of uncertainty that is difficult to characterize. The analytical inversion\nwas able to estimate annual emissions with an accuracy of <â1.1âMtâyrâ1\n(<â6â%) even with only one satellite, but this assumes perfect knowledge of plume location\nand CO2 background. The accuracy was much smaller when applying the mass-balance approach,\nwhich determines plume location and background directly from the satellite observations. At least\ntwo satellites were necessary for the mass-balance approach to have a sufficiently large number of\nestimates distributed over the year to robustly fit a spline, but even then the accuracy was low\n(>â8âMtâyrâ1 (>40â%)) when using the CO2 observations alone. When\nusing the NO2 observations to detect the plume, the accuracy could be greatly improved to\n22â% and 13â% with two and three satellites, respectively. Using the complementary\ninformation provided by the CO2 and NO2 observations on the CO2M mission, it\nshould be possible to quantify annual emissions of a city like Berlin with an accuracy of about\n10â% to 20â%, even in the pessimistic case that plume location and CO2 background\nhave to be determined from the observations alone. This requires, however, that the temporal\ncoverage of the constellation is sufficiently high to resolve the temporal variability of\nemissions.",

M. Koene, Maarten Krol, Dominik Brunner, Alexander Damm, and Gerrit Kuhlmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 7667–7686, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7667-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7667-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are important air pollutants. This study addresses the challenge of accurately estimating NOx emissions from NO2 satellite observations. We develop a realistic model to convert NO2 to NOx by using simulated plumes from various power plants. We apply the model to satellite NO2 observations, significantly reducing biases in estimated NOx emissions. The study highlights the potential for a consistent, high-resolution estimation of NOx emissions using satellite data.\n\nThe ddeq Python library for point source quantification from remote sensing images (version 1.0)\n\nGerrit Kuhlmann, Erik Koene, Sandro Meier, Diego Santaren, GrÃ©goire Broquet, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier, Janne Hakkarainen, Janne Nurmela, Laia AmorÃ³s, Johanna Tamminen, and Dominik Brunner\n\nGeosci.

It can be used to determine the emissions of hot spots (cities, power plants and industry) from remote sensing images using different methods. ddeq can be extended for new datasets and methods, providing a powerful community tool for users and developers. The application of the methods is shown using Jupyter notebooks included in the library.\n\nDeep learning applied to CO2 power plant emissions quantification using simulated satellite images\n\nJoffrey Dumont Le Brazidec, Pierre Vanderbecken, Alban Farchi, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Gerrit Kuhlmann, and Marc Bocquet\n\nGeosci.

The exploitation of these images is challenging due to noise and meteorological uncertainties. To overcome these obstacles, we use a deep learning neural network trained on simulated CO2 images. Our method outperforms alternatives, providing a positive perspective for the analysis of CO2M images.\n\nBenchmarking data-driven inversion methods for the estimation of local CO2 emissions from XCO2 and NO2 satellite images\n\nDiego Santaren, Janne Hakkarainen, Gerrit Kuhlmann, Erik Koene, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier, Iolanda Ialongo, Hannakaisa Lindqvist, Janne Nurmela, Johanna Tamminen, Laia Amoros, Dominik Brunner, and GrÃ©goire Broquet\n\nAtmos.

We assess and compare the performance of five different methods with simulations of one year of images from the future CO2M satellite mission over 15 power plants and the city of Berlin in Eastern Germany.\n\nSegmentation of XCO2 images with deep learning: application to synthetic plumes from cities and power plants\n\nJoffrey Dumont Le Brazidec, Pierre Vanderbecken, Alban Farchi, Marc Bocquet, Jinghui Lian, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Gerrit Kuhlmann, Alexandre Danjou, and Thomas Lauvaux\n\nGeosci.

Local emissions, from cities or power plants, may be estimated from CO2 plumes detected in satellite images. CO2 plumes generally have a weak signal and are partially concealed by highly variable background concentrations and instrument errors, which hampers their detection. To address this problem, we propose and apply deep learning methods to detect the contour of a plume in simulated CO2 satellite images.\n\nEvaluation of simulated CO2 power plant plumes from six high-resolution atmospheric transport models\n\nDominik Brunner, Gerrit Kuhlmann, Stephan Henne, Erik Koene, Bastian Kern, Sebastian Wolff, Christiane Voigt, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, Christoph Kiemle, Anke Roiger, Alina Fiehn, Sven Krautwurst, Konstantin Gerilowski, Heinrich Bovensmann, Jakob Borchardt, Michal Galkowski, Christoph Gerbig, Julia Marshall, Andrzej Klonecki, Pascal Prunet, Robert Hanfland, Margit PattantyÃºs-ÃbrahÃ¡m, Andrzej Wyszogrodzki, and Andreas Fix\n\nAtmos.

The study analyzed how realistically such plumes can be simulated at different model resolutions and how well the planned European satellite mission CO2M will be able to quantify emissions from power plants.\n\nMapping the spatial distribution of NO2 with in situ and remote sensing instruments during the Munich NO2 imaging campaign\n\nGerrit Kuhlmann, Ka Lok Chan, Sebastian Donner, Ying Zhu, Marc Schwaerzel, Steffen DÃ¶rner, Jia Chen, Andreas Hueni, Duc Hai Nguyen, Alexander Damm, Annette SchÃ¼tt, Florian Dietrich, Dominik Brunner, Cheng Liu, Brigitte Buchmann, Thomas Wagner, and Mark Wenig\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 1609–1629, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1609-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-1609-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an air pollutant whose concentration often exceeds air quality guideline values, especially in urban areas. To map the spatial distribution of NO2 in Munich, we conducted the Munich NO2 Imaging Campaign (MuNIC), where NO2 was measured with stationary, mobile, and airborne in situ and remote sensing instruments. The campaign provides a unique dataset that has been used to compare the different instruments and to study the spatial variability of NO2 and its sources.\n\nImpact of 3D radiative transfer on airborne NO2 imaging remote sensing over cities with buildings\n\nMarc Schwaerzel, Dominik Brunner, Fabian Jakub, Claudia Emde, Brigitte Buchmann, Alexis Berne, and Gerrit Kuhlmann\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 6469–6482, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6469-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6469-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNO2 maps from airborne imaging remote sensing often appear much smoother than one would expect from high-resolution model simulations of NO2 over cities, despite the small ground-pixel size of the sensors. Our case study over Zurich, using the newly implemented building module of the MYSTIC radiative transfer solver, shows that the 3D effect can explain part of the smearing and that building shadows cause a noticeable underestimation and noise in the measured NO2 columns.\n\nSpatial and temporal representativeness of point measurements for nitrogen dioxide pollution levels in cities\n\nYing Zhu, Jia Chen, Xiao Bi, Gerrit Kuhlmann, Ka Lok Chan, Florian Dietrich, Dominik Brunner, Sheng Ye, and Mark Wenig\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 13241–13251, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13241-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13241-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAverage NO2 concentration of on-street mobile measurements (MMs) near the monitoring stations (MSs) was found to be considerably higher than the MSs data. The common measurement height (H) and distance (D) of the MSs result in 27 % lower average concentrations in total than the concentration of our MMs. Another 21 % difference remained after correcting the influence of the measuring H and D. This result makes our city-wide measurements for capturing the full range of concentrations necessary.\n\nThree-dimensional radiative transfer effects on airborne and ground-based trace gas remote sensing\n\nMarc Schwaerzel, Claudia Emde, Dominik Brunner, Randulph Morales, Thomas Wagner, Alexis Berne, Brigitte Buchmann, and Gerrit Kuhlmann\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 4277–4293, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4277-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4277-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHorizontal homogeneity is often assumed for trace gases remote sensing, although it is not valid where trace gas concentrations have high spatial variability, e.g., in cities. We show the importance of 3D effects for MAX-DOAS and airborne imaging spectrometers using 3D-box air mass factors implemented in the MYSTIC radiative transfer solver. In both cases, 3D information is invaluable for interpreting the measurements, as not considering 3D effects can lead to misinterpretation of measurements.\n\nAn online emission module for atmospheric chemistry transport models: implementation in COSMO-GHG v5.6a and COSMO-ART v5.1-3.1\n\nMichael JÃ¤hn, Gerrit Kuhlmann, Qing Mu, Jean-Matthieu Haussaire, David Ochsner, Katherine Osterried, Valentin ClÃ©ment, and Dominik Brunner\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 2379–2392, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2379-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2379-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmission inventories of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are widely used as input for atmospheric chemistry transport models. However, the pre-processing of these data is both time-consuming and requires a large amount of disk storage. To overcome this issue, a Python package has been developed and tested for two different models. There, the inventory is projected to the model grid and scaling factors are provided. This approach saves computational time while remaining numerically equivalent.\n\nDetectability of CO2 emission plumes of cities and power plants with the Copernicus Anthropogenic CO2 Monitoring (CO2M) mission\n\nGerrit Kuhlmann, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Julia Marshall, Valentin ClÃ©ment, Armin LÃ¶scher, Yasjka Meijer, and Dominik Brunner\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 6695–6719, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6695-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6695-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Copernicus Anthropogenic CO2 Monitoring (CO2M) mission is a proposed constellation of imaging satellites with a CO2 instrument as main payload and optionally instruments for NO2, CO and aerosols. This study demonstrates the huge benefit of an NO2 instrument for detecting city plumes and weak point sources. Its main advantages are the higher signal-to-noise ratio and the lower sensitivity to clouds that significantly increases the number of observations available for quantifying CO2 emission.\n\nAccounting for the vertical distribution of emissions in atmospheric CO2 simulations\n\nDominik Brunner, Gerrit Kuhlmann, Julia Marshall, Valentin ClÃ©ment, Oliver Fuhrer, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Armin LÃ¶scher, and Yasjka Meijer\n\nAtmos. Chem.

This study demonstrates the importance of distributing CO2 emissions vertically in the model according to realistic profiles, since a major proportion of CO2 is emitted through tall stacks from power plants and industrial sources. With the traditional approach of emitting all CO2 at the surface, models may significantly overestimate the atmospheric CO2 levels.\n\nDevelopment of a custom OMI NO2 data product for evaluating biases in a regional chemistry transport model\n\nG. Kuhlmann, Y. F. Lam, H. M. Cheung, A. Hartl, J. C. H. Fung, P. W. Chan, and M. O. Wenig\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We developed a custom OMI NO2 data product for the Pearl River delta region which reduces biases compared to the standard product. The product is used for the evaluation of a regional air quality model for which it is a useful addition to ground measurements. The unbiased NO2 data product can be very helpful for air pollution studies in urban areas.\n\nA novel gridding algorithm to create regional trace gas maps from satellite observations\n\nG.

The results from the evaluations performed for this article are independently consistent with the results from previously published article which was based on ground-based measurements during the ROMEO campaign. The results show that reported methane emissions from oil and gas industry in Romania are largely under-reported to UNFCCC in 2019.\n\nA lightweight NO2-to-NOx conversion model for quantifying NOx emissions of point sources from NO2 satellite observations\n\nSandro Meier, Erik F. M. Koene, Maarten Krol, Dominik Brunner, Alexander Damm, and Gerrit Kuhlmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 7667–7686, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7667-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-7667-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are important air pollutants. This study addresses the challenge of accurately estimating NOx emissions from NO2 satellite observations. We develop a realistic model to convert NO2 to NOx by using simulated plumes from various power plants. We apply the model to satellite NO2 observations, significantly reducing biases in estimated NOx emissions. The study highlights the potential for a consistent, high-resolution estimation of NOx emissions using satellite data.\n\nThe ddeq Python library for point source quantification from remote sensing images (version 1.0)\n\nGerrit Kuhlmann, Erik Koene, Sandro Meier, Diego Santaren, GrÃ©goire Broquet, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier, Janne Hakkarainen, Janne Nurmela, Laia AmorÃ³s, Johanna Tamminen, and Dominik Brunner\n\nGeosci.

It can be used to determine the emissions of hot spots (cities, power plants and industry) from remote sensing images using different methods. ddeq can be extended for new datasets and methods, providing a powerful community tool for users and developers. The application of the methods is shown using Jupyter notebooks included in the library.\n\nFlow-dependent observation errors for GHG inversions in an ensemble Kalman smoother\n\nMichael Steiner, Luca Cantarello, Stephan Henne, and Dominik Brunner\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1426,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1426, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric GHG inversions have great potential to independently check reported bottom-up emissions, however they are still subject to large uncertainties. It is therefore paramount to address and reduce the largest source of uncertainty stemming from the representation of atmospheric transport in the models. In this study, we show that the use of a temporally varying, flow-dependent atmospheric transport uncertainty can enhance the accuracy of emission estimation through idealized experiment.\n\nDeep learning applied to CO2 power plant emissions quantification using simulated satellite images\n\nJoffrey Dumont Le Brazidec, Pierre Vanderbecken, Alban Farchi, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Gerrit Kuhlmann, and Marc Bocquet\n\nGeosci.

The exploitation of these images is challenging due to noise and meteorological uncertainties. To overcome these obstacles, we use a deep learning neural network trained on simulated CO2 images. Our method outperforms alternatives, providing a positive perspective for the analysis of CO2M images.\n\nEuropean CH4 inversions with ICON-ART coupled to the CarbonTracker Data Assimilation Shell\n\nMichael Steiner, Wouter Peters, Ingrid Luijkx, Stephan Henne, Huilin Chen, Samuel Hammer, and Dominik Brunner\n\nAtmos.

It is therefore paramount to reduce large errors and to build systems that are based on the newest atmospheric transport models. In this study, we present the first application of ICON-ART in the inverse modeling of GHG fluxes with an ensemble Kalman filter and present our results for European CH4 emissions.\n\nThe Lagrangian Atmospheric Radionuclide Transport Model (ARTM)Â â sensitivity studies and evaluation using airborne measurements of power plant emissions\n\nRobert Hanfland, Dominik Brunner, Christiane Voigt, Alina Fiehn, Anke Roiger, and Margit PattantyÃºs-ÃbrahÃ¡m\n\nAtmos.

Simulations show that one model agrees slightly better in unstable stratification conditions.\n\nBenchmarking data-driven inversion methods for the estimation of local CO2 emissions from XCO2 and NO2 satellite images\n\nDiego Santaren, Janne Hakkarainen, Gerrit Kuhlmann, Erik Koene, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chevallier, Iolanda Ialongo, Hannakaisa Lindqvist, Janne Nurmela, Johanna Tamminen, Laia Amoros, Dominik Brunner, and GrÃ©goire Broquet\n\nAtmos.

It systematically compares them and provides recommendations for robust comparisons, aiming to steadily engage more Parties in using observational methods to complement their UNFCCC submissions. Anticipating improvements in atmospheric modelling and observations, future developments need to resolve knowledge gaps in both approaches and to better quantify remaining uncertainty.\n\nImpact of transport model resolution and a priori assumptions on inverse modeling of Swiss F-gas emissions\n\nIoannis Katharopoulos, Dominique Rust, Martin K.

Countries report their emissions to the UN in a bottom-up manner. By combining atmospheric observations and transport models someone can independently validate emission estimates in a top-down fashion. We report Swiss emissions of synthetic GHGs based on kilometer-scale transport and inverse modeling, highlighting the role of appropriate resolution in complex terrain.\n\nHigh potential for CH4 emission mitigation from oil infrastructure in one of EU's major production regions\n\nFoteini Stavropoulou, Katarina VinkoviÄ, Bert Kers, Marcel de Vries, Steven van Heuven, Piotr KorbeÅ, Martina Schmidt, Julia Wietzel, Pawel Jagoda, Jaroslav M.

We show that the total CH4 emissions in our studied areas are much higher than the emissions reported to UNFCCC, and up to three-quarters of the detected emissions are related to operational venting. Our results suggest that oil and gas production infrastructure in Romania holds a massive mitigation potential.\n\nSegmentation of XCO2 images with deep learning: application to synthetic plumes from cities and power plants\n\nJoffrey Dumont Le Brazidec, Pierre Vanderbecken, Alban Farchi, Marc Bocquet, Jinghui Lian, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Gerrit Kuhlmann, Alexandre Danjou, and Thomas Lauvaux\n\nGeosci.

Local emissions, from cities or power plants, may be estimated from CO2 plumes detected in satellite images. CO2 plumes generally have a weak signal and are partially concealed by highly variable background concentrations and instrument errors, which hampers their detection. To address this problem, we propose and apply deep learning methods to detect the contour of a plume in simulated CO2 satellite images.\n\nThe consolidated European synthesis of CH4 and N2O emissions for the European Union and United Kingdom: 1990â2019\n\nAna Maria Roxana Petrescu, Chunjing Qiu, Matthew J.

The study analyzed how realistically such plumes can be simulated at different model resolutions and how well the planned European satellite mission CO2M will be able to quantify emissions from power plants.\n\nAerosol characteristics and polarimetric signatures for a deep convective storm over the northwestern part of Europe â modeling and observations\n\nPrabhakar Shrestha, Jana Mendrok, and Dominik Brunner\n\nAtmos.

This is demonstrated using a case study of a deep convective storm, which showed that the strong updraft in the convective core of the storm produced aerosol-tower-like features, which affected the size of the hydrometeors and the simulated polarimetric features (e.g., ZDR and KDP columns).\n\nHigh-resolution inverse modelling of European CH4 emissions using the novel FLEXPART-COSMO TM5 4DVAR inverse modelling system\n\nPeter Bergamaschi, Arjo Segers, Dominik Brunner, Jean-Matthieu Haussaire, Stephan Henne, Michel Ramonet, Tim Arnold, Tobias Biermann, Huilin Chen, Sebastien Conil, Marc Delmotte, Grant Forster, Arnoud Frumau, Dagmar Kubistin, Xin Lan, Markus Leuenberger, Matthias Lindauer, Morgan Lopez, Giovanni Manca, Jennifer MÃ¼ller-Williams, Simon O'Doherty, Bert Scheeren, Martin Steinbacher, Pamela Trisolino, Gabriela VÃ­tkovÃ¡, and Camille Yver Kwok\n\nAtmos.

The new system combines a high spatial resolution of 7 km x 7 km with a variational data assimilation technique, which allows CH4 emissions to be optimized from individual model grid cells. The high resolution allows the observations to be better reproduced, while the derived emissions show overall good consistency with two existing models.\n\nAnalysis of regional CO2 contributions at the high Alpine observatory Jungfraujoch by means of atmospheric transport simulations and Î´13C\n\nSimone M.

In this study, we investigated the regional contributions of carbon dioxide (CO2) at the location of the high Alpine observatory Jungfraujoch (JFJ, Switzerland, 3580 m a.s.l.). To this purpose, we combined receptor-oriented atmospheric transport simulations for CO2 concentration in the period 2009–2017 with stable carbon isotope (δ13C–CO2) information.\n\nControlled-release experiment to investigate uncertainties in UAV-based emission quantification for methane point sources\n\nRandulph Morales, Jonas Ravelid, Katarina Vinkovic, Piotr KorbeÅ, BÃ©la Tuzson, Lukas Emmenegger, Huilin Chen, Martina Schmidt, Sebastian Humbel, and Dominik Brunner\n\nAtmos.

We performed an extensive controlled-release experiment to develop an optimal quantification method and to determine the related uncertainties under various environmental and sampling conditions. Our approach was successful in quantifying local methane sources from drone-based measurements.\n\nMapping the spatial distribution of NO2 with in situ and remote sensing instruments during the Munich NO2 imaging campaign\n\nGerrit Kuhlmann, Ka Lok Chan, Sebastian Donner, Ying Zhu, Marc Schwaerzel, Steffen DÃ¶rner, Jia Chen, Andreas Hueni, Duc Hai Nguyen, Alexander Damm, Annette SchÃ¼tt, Florian Dietrich, Dominik Brunner, Cheng Liu, Brigitte Buchmann, Thomas Wagner, and Mark Wenig\n\nAtmos.

To map the spatial distribution of NO2 in Munich, we conducted the Munich NO2 Imaging Campaign (MuNIC), where NO2 was measured with stationary, mobile, and airborne in situ and remote sensing instruments. The campaign provides a unique dataset that has been used to compare the different instruments and to study the spatial variability of NO2 and its sources.\n\nImpact of 3D radiative transfer on airborne NO2 imaging remote sensing over cities with buildings\n\nMarc Schwaerzel, Dominik Brunner, Fabian Jakub, Claudia Emde, Brigitte Buchmann, Alexis Berne, and Gerrit Kuhlmann\n\nAtmos.

Our case study over Zurich, using the newly implemented building module of the MYSTIC radiative transfer solver, shows that the 3D effect can explain part of the smearing and that building shadows cause a noticeable underestimation and noise in the measured NO2 columns.\n\nThe Community Inversion Framework v1.0: a unified system for atmospheric inversion studies\n\nAntoine Berchet, Espen Sollum, Rona L.

Phys., 20, 13241–13251, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13241-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13241-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAverage NO2 concentration of on-street mobile measurements (MMs) near the monitoring stations (MSs) was found to be considerably higher than the MSs data. The common measurement height (H) and distance (D) of the MSs result in 27 % lower average concentrations in total than the concentration of our MMs. Another 21 % difference remained after correcting the influence of the measuring H and D. This result makes our city-wide measurements for capturing the full range of concentrations necessary.\n\nThree-dimensional radiative transfer effects on airborne and ground-based trace gas remote sensing\n\nMarc Schwaerzel, Claudia Emde, Dominik Brunner, Randulph Morales, Thomas Wagner, Alexis Berne, Brigitte Buchmann, and Gerrit Kuhlmann\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 4277–4293, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4277-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-4277-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHorizontal homogeneity is often assumed for trace gases remote sensing, although it is not valid where trace gas concentrations have high spatial variability, e.g., in cities. We show the importance of 3D effects for MAX-DOAS and airborne imaging spectrometers using 3D-box air mass factors implemented in the MYSTIC radiative transfer solver. In both cases, 3D information is invaluable for interpreting the measurements, as not considering 3D effects can lead to misinterpretation of measurements.\n\nIntegration and calibration of non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 low-cost sensors and their operation in a sensor network covering Switzerland\n\nMichael MÃ¼ller, Peter Graf, Jonas Meyer, Anastasia Pentina, Dominik Brunner, Fernando Perez-Cruz, Christoph HÃ¼glin, and Lukas Emmenegger\n\nAtmos.

Model Dev., 13, 2379–2392, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2379-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2379-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmission inventories of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are widely used as input for atmospheric chemistry transport models. However, the pre-processing of these data is both time-consuming and requires a large amount of disk storage. To overcome this issue, a Python package has been developed and tested for two different models. There, the inventory is projected to the model grid and scaling factors are provided. This approach saves computational time while remaining numerically equivalent.\n\nCOSMO-BEP-Tree v1.0: a coupled urban climate model with explicit representation of street trees\n\nGianluca Mussetti, Dominik Brunner, Stephan Henne, Jonas Allegrini, E. Scott Krayenhoff, Sebastian Schubert, Christian Feigenwinter, Roland Vogt, Andreas Wicki, and Jan Carmeliet\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 1685–1710, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1685-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-1685-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStreet trees are regarded as a powerful measure to reduce excessive heat in cities. To enable city-wide studies of the cooling effect of street trees, we developed a coupled urban climate model with explicit representation of street trees (COSMO-BEP-Tree). The model compares well with surface, flux and satellite observations and responds realistically to changes in tree characteristics. Street trees largely impact energy fluxes and wind speed, while air temperatures are only slightly reduced.\n\nXCO2 observations using satellite measurements with moderate spectral resolution: investigation using GOSAT and OCO-2 measurements\n\nLianghai Wu, Joost aan de Brugh, Yasjka Meijer, Bernd Sierk, Otto Hasekamp, Andre Butz, and Jochen Landgraf\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 713–729, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-713-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-713-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe future European CO2 monitoring constellation is targeting a moderate spectral resolution of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.3–0.55 nm in the spectral bands of 0.76, 1.61, and 2.06 μm. To assess this choice, we perform XCO2 retrievals using both satellite (OCO-2 and GOSAT) and synthetic observations, which we spectrally degrade to the target spectral resolution. We see that moderate spectral resolution mainly reduces XCO2 precision and has little effect on the the systematic error.\n\nDetectability of CO2 emission plumes of cities and power plants with the Copernicus Anthropogenic CO2 Monitoring (CO2M) mission\n\nGerrit Kuhlmann, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Julia Marshall, Valentin ClÃ©ment, Armin LÃ¶scher, Yasjka Meijer, and Dominik Brunner\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 6695–6719, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6695-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6695-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Copernicus Anthropogenic CO2 Monitoring (CO2M) mission is a proposed constellation of imaging satellites with a CO2 instrument as main payload and optionally instruments for NO2, CO and aerosols. This study demonstrates the huge benefit of an NO2 instrument for detecting city plumes and weak point sources. Its main advantages are the higher signal-to-noise ratio and the lower sensitivity to clouds that significantly increases the number of observations available for quantifying CO2 emission.\n\nThe Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART version 10.4\n\nIgnacio Pisso, Espen Sollum, Henrik Grythe, Nina I.

Model Dev., 12, 4955–4997, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-4955-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-4955-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the latest release of the Lagrangian transport model FLEXPART, which simulates the transport, diffusion, dry and wet deposition, radioactive decay, and 1st-order chemical reactions of atmospheric tracers. The model has been recently updated both technically and in the representation of physicochemical processes. We describe the changes, document the most recent input and output files, provide working examples, and introduce testing capabilities.\n\nA global map of emission clumps for future monitoring of fossil fuel CO2 emissions from space\n\nYilong Wang, Philippe Ciais, GrÃ©goire Broquet, FranÃ§ois-Marie BrÃ©on, Tomohiro Oda, Franck Lespinas, Yasjka Meijer, Armin Loescher, Greet Janssens-Maenhout, Bo Zheng, Haoran Xu, Shu Tao, Kevin R. Gurney, Geoffrey Roest, Diego Santaren, and Yongxian Su\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 11, 687–703, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-687-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-687-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe address the question of the global characterization of fossil fuel CO2 emission hotspots that may cause coherent XCO2 plumes in space-borne CO2 images, based on the ODIAC global high-resolution 1 km fossil fuel emission data product. For space imagery with 0.5 ppm precision for a single XCO2 measurement, a total of 11 314 hotspots are identified, covering 72 % of the global emissions. These hotspots define the targets for the purpose of monitoring fossil fuel CO2 emissions from space.\n\nAccounting for the vertical distribution of emissions in atmospheric CO2 simulations\n\nDominik Brunner, Gerrit Kuhlmann, Julia Marshall, Valentin ClÃ©ment, Oliver Fuhrer, GrÃ©goire Broquet, Armin LÃ¶scher, and Yasjka Meijer\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 4541–4559, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-4541-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-4541-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric transport models are increasingly being used to estimate CO2 emissions from atmospheric CO2 measurements. This study demonstrates the importance of distributing CO2 emissions vertically in the model according to realistic profiles, since a major proportion of CO2 is emitted through tall stacks from power plants and industrial sources. With the traditional approach of emitting all CO2 at the surface, models may significantly overestimate the atmospheric CO2 levels.\n\nEvaluating cloud properties in an ensemble of regional online coupled models against satellite observations\n\nRocÃ­o BarÃ³, Pedro JimÃ©nez-Guerrero, Martin Stengel, Dominik Brunner, Gabriele Curci, Renate Forkel, Lucy Neal, Laura Palacios-PeÃ±a, Nicholas Savage, Martijn Schaap, Paolo Tuccella, Hugo Denier van der Gon, and Stefano Galmarini\n\nAtmos.

They interact with incoming radiation resulting in a cooling effect of the atmosphere. Today, the use of meteorology and chemistry models help us to understand these processes, but there are a lot of uncertainties. The goal of this work is to evaluate how these interactions are represented in the models by comparing them to satellite data to see how close they are to reality.\n\nAn assessment of aerosol optical properties from remote-sensing observations and regional chemistryâclimate coupled models over Europe\n\nLaura Palacios-PeÃ±a, RocÃ­o BarÃ³, Alexander Baklanov, Alessandra Balzarini, Dominik Brunner, Renate Forkel, Marcus Hirtl, Luka Honzak, JosÃ© MarÃ­a LÃ³pez-Romero, Juan Pedro MontÃ¡vez, Juan Luis PÃ©rez, Guido Pirovano, Roberto San JosÃ©, Wolfram SchrÃ¶der, Johannes Werhahn, Ralf Wolke, Rahela Å½abkar, and Pedro JimÃ©nez-Guerrero\n\nAtmos.

This work therefore evaluates the skill in the representation of optical properties by different remote-sensing sensors and regional online coupled chemistry–climate models over Europe.\n\nIdentification of spikes associated with local sources in continuous time series of atmospheric CO, CO2 and CH4\n\nAbdelhadi El Yazidi, Michel Ramonet, Philippe Ciais, Gregoire Broquet, Isabelle Pison, Amara Abbaris, Dominik Brunner, Sebastien Conil, Marc Delmotte, Francois Gheusi, Frederic Guerin, Lynn Hazan, Nesrine Kachroudi, Giorgos Kouvarakis, Nikolaos Mihalopoulos, Leonard Rivier, and Dominique SerÃ§a\n\nAtmos.

Chem. Phys., 17, 14145–14169, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-14145-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-14145-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyze fossil fuel signals in atmospheric CO2 over Europe using a high-resolution atmospheric transport model and diurnal emission data. We find that fossil fuel CO2 accounts for more than half of the atmospheric CO2 variations, mainly at diurnal timescales. The covariance of diurnal emission and transport also leads to a substantial rectification effect. Thus, the consideration of diurnal emissions and high-resolution transport is paramount for accurately modeling the fossil fuel signal.\n\nEvaluation of high-resolution GRAMMâGRAL (v15.12/v14.8) NOx simulations over the city of ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland\n\nAntoine Berchet, Katrin Zink, Dietmar Oettl, JÃ¼rg Brunner, Lukas Emmenegger, and Dominik Brunner\n\nGeosci.

The method is based on a catalogue of reference simulations matched to weather observations to produce a sequence of hourly pollution maps. A total of 2 years of simulations are compared with continuous measurements and passive NO2 samplers in the city of Zurich. Spatial and temporal variability proved to be very well reproduced by the method.\n\nEstimation of the fossil fuel component in atmospheric CO2 based on radiocarbon measurements at the BeromÃ¼nster tall tower, Switzerland\n\nTesfaye A. Berhanu, SÃ¶nke Szidat, Dominik Brunner, Ece Satar, RÃ¼diger Schanda, Peter Nyfeler, Michael Battaglia, Martin Steinbacher, Samuel Hammer, and Markus Leuenberger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 10753–10766, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-10753-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-10753-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFossil fuel CO2 is the major contributor of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere, and accurate quantification is essential to better understand the carbon cycle. Such accurate quantification can be conducted based on radiocarbon measurements. In this study, we present radiocarbon measurements from a tall tower site in Switzerland. From these measurements, we have observed seasonally varying fossil fuel CO2 contributions and a biospheric CO2 component that varies diurnally and seasonally.\n\nComparison of four inverse modelling systems applied to the estimation of HFC-125, HFC-134a, and SF6 emissions over Europe\n\nDominik Brunner, Tim Arnold, Stephan Henne, Alistair Manning, Rona L. Thompson, Michela Maione, Simon O'Doherty, and Stefan Reimann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 10651–10674, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-10651-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-10651-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and SF6 are industrially produced gases with a large greenhouse-gas warming potential. In this study, we estimated the emissions of HFCs and SF6 over Europe by combining measurements at three background stations with four different model systems. We identified significant differences between our estimates and nationally reported numbers, but also found that the network of only three sites in Europe is insufficient to reliably attribute emissions to individual countries.\n\nChanges in domestic heating fuel use in Greece: effects on atmospheric chemistry and radiation\n\nEleni Athanasopoulou, Orestis Speyer, Dominik Brunner, Heike Vogel, Bernhard Vogel, Nikolaos Mihalopoulos, and Evangelos Gerasopoulos\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 10597–10618, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-10597-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-10597-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work focuses on the impact of residential wood burning on aerosol levels, composition and radiation under the ongoing economic crisis in Greece. The atmospheric model COSMO-ART performed a series of runs during the winter of 2013–2014. Emission inputs were revised according to the detailed aerosol characterization by local measurements. Aerosol levels were found to be elevated and mostly composed of organics, yet the timing of the plume justifies the minor radiative cooling and feedbacks.\n\nPathfinderTURB: an automatic boundary layer algorithm. Development, validation and application to study the impact on in situ measurements at the Jungfraujoch\n\nYann Poltera, Giovanni Martucci, Martine Collaud Coen, Maxime Hervo, Lukas Emmenegger, Stephan Henne, Dominik Brunner, and Alexander Haefele\n\nAtmos.

PathfinderTURB has been applied to 1 year of data measured by two ceilometers operated at two Swiss stations: the Aerological Observatory of Payerne on the Swiss plateau, and the Alpine Jungfraujoch observatory. The study shows that aerosols from the boundary layer significantly influence the air measured at Jungfraujoch.\n\nRegional effects of atmospheric aerosols on temperature: an evaluation of an ensemble of online coupled models\n\nRocÃ­o BarÃ³, Laura Palacios-PeÃ±a, Alexander Baklanov, Alessandra Balzarini, Dominik Brunner, Renate Forkel, Marcus Hirtl, Luka Honzak, Juan Luis PÃ©rez, Guido Pirovano, Roberto San JosÃ©, Wolfram SchrÃ¶der, Johannes Werhahn, Ralf Wolke, Rahela Å½abkar, and Pedro JimÃ©nez-Guerrero\n\nAtmos.

Data were taken from an ensemble of online regional chemistry–climate models from EuMetChem COST Action. The results indicate that including these interactions clearly improves the spatiotemporal variability in the temperature signal simulated by the models, with implications for reducing the uncertainty in climate projections.\n\nEvaluating the representation of aerosol optical properties using an online coupled model over the Iberian Peninsula\n\nLaura Palacios-PeÃ±a, RocÃ­o BarÃ³, Juan Luis Guerrero-Rascado, Lucas Alados-Arboledas, Dominik Brunner, and Pedro JimÃ©nez-Guerrero\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 277–296, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-277-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-277-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe effects of atmospheric aerosols over the Earthâs climate mainly depend on their optical, microphysical and chemical properties, which modify the Earth's radiative budget, the main source of uncertainty in climate change. In this work we have studied the representation of aerosol optical properties using an online coupled model (WRF-Chem) when aerosolâradiation interactions (ARIs) and aerosolâclouds interactions (ACIs) are taken into account over the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nInsights into the deterministic skill of air quality ensembles from the analysis of AQMEII data\n\nIoannis Kioutsioukis, Ulas Im, Efisio Solazzo, Roberto Bianconi, Alba Badia, Alessandra Balzarini, RocÃ­o BarÃ³, Roberto Bellasio, Dominik Brunner, Charles Chemel, Gabriele Curci, Hugo Denier van der Gon, Johannes Flemming, Renate Forkel, Lea Giordano, Pedro JimÃ©nez-Guerrero, Marcus Hirtl, Oriol Jorba, Astrid Manders-Groot, Lucy Neal, Juan L.

The goal of the study is to quantify to what extent we can extract predictable signals from an ensemble with superior skill at each station over the single models and the ensemble mean. The promotion of the right amount of accuracy and diversity within the ensemble results in an average additional skill of up to 31 % compared to using the full ensemble in an unconditional way.\n\nIn situ observations of the isotopic composition of methane at the Cabauw tall tower site\n\nThomas RÃ¶ckmann, Simon Eyer, Carina van der Veen, Maria E.

From about 2 years of continuous CO, CO2 and CH4 measurement at five different heights, we have determined a long-term reproducibility of 2.79 ppb, 0.05 ppm and 0.29 ppb for CO, CO2 and CH4, respectively, compliant with the GAW requirements. We have also observed seasonal and diurnal variation of these species.\n\nContinuous CO2/CH4/CO measurements (2012â2014) at BeromÃ¼nster tall tower station in Switzerland\n\nEce Satar, Tesfaye A.

In this research article we report the first 2 years of the continuous greenhouse gas measurements using cavity ring down spectroscopy analyzer from this tall tower. We have adopted a purely observation based, multi-species and multi-level approach to characterize the site with respect to sources and sinks of natural and anthropogenic origin at diurnal to annual timescales.\n\nValidation of the Swiss methane emission inventory by atmospheric observations and inverse modelling\n\nStephan Henne, Dominik Brunner, Brian Oney, Markus Leuenberger, Werner Eugster, Ines Bamberger, Frank Meinhardt, Martin Steinbacher, and Lukas Emmenegger\n\nAtmos.

Here, we apply such a top-down method to the methane emissions of Switzerland, utilising observations from the recently installed CarboCount-CH network. Our Swiss total emissions largely agree with those of the national \"bottom-up\" inventory, whereas regional differences suggest lower than reported emissions from manure handling.\n\nThe CarboCount CH sites: characterization of a dense greenhouse gas observation network\n\nB.

We find the network's measurements to be information rich and suitable for studying surface carbon fluxes of the study region. However, we are limited by the high-resolution (2km) atmospheric transport model's ability to simulate meteorology at the individual measurement stations, especially at those situated in rough terrain.\n\nDevelopment of a custom OMI NO2 data product for evaluating biases in a regional chemistry transport model\n\nG.

We developed a custom OMI NO2 data product for the Pearl River delta region which reduces biases compared to the standard product. The product is used for the evaluation of a regional air quality model for which it is a useful addition to ground measurements.

We provide customized calibrations for this Nord Stream 2 case and assess that no firm conclusion can be drawn from L8 or S-2B single overpasses. However, if we opportunistically assume that L8 and S-2B results are independent, we find an averaged L8 and S-2B combined methane leak rate of 502 ± 464 t h−1.\n\nU-Plume: automated algorithm for plume detection and source quantification by satellite point-source imagers\n\nJack H.

Therefore, we evaluate several global DEMs, used in versions 10 and 11 of the OCO-2 retrieval along with the Copernicus DEM. We explore the impacts of changing the DEM on biases in OCO-2-retrieved XCO2 and inferred CO2 fluxes. Our findings led to an update to OCO-2 v11.1 using the Copernicus DEM globally.\n\nCurrent potential of CH4 emission estimates using TROPOMI in the Middle East\n\nMengyao Liu, Ronald van der A, Michiel van Weele, Lotte Bryan, Henk Eskes, Pepijn Veefkind, Yongxue Liu, Xiaojuan Lin, Jos de Laat, and Jieying Ding\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-370,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-370, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new divergence method was developed and applied to estimate methane emissions from TROPOMI observations over the Middle East, where is typically challenging for a satellite to measure methane due to its complicated orography and surface albedo.

In this work, a variation of the matched filter method that exploits a large fraction of the near-infrared range (1000–2500 nm) is applied. In comparison to the raw matched filter, it reduces background noise and strongly attenuates the surface-related artifacts, which leads to a greater detection capability. We propose this variation as a standard methodology for methane detection.\n\nA method for estimating localized CO2 emissions from co-located satellite XCO2 and NO2 images\n\nBlanca Fuentes Andrade, Michael Buchwitz, Maximilian Reuter, Heinrich Bovensmann, Andreas Richter, Hartmut Boesch, and John P.

As the detection of CO2 emission plumes from satellite data is difficult, we used observations of co-emitted NO2 to constrain the emission plume region. Our results agree with CO2 emission estimations based on the power-plant-generated power and emission factors.\n\nThe GeoCarb greenhouse gas retrieval algorithm: simulations and sensitivity to sources of uncertainty\n\nGregory R.

Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2023-228,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2023-228, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for AMT\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA small satellite about the size of a shoe box, named TEMPEST, carries only a microwave sensor and is designed to measure the water cycle of the Earth from space in an economical way compared with traditional satellites, which have additional infrared sensors. To overcome the limitation, extra infrared signals from GOES-R ABI are combined with TEMPEST microwave measurements. Compared with ground observations, improved humidity information is extracted from the merged TEMPEST and ABI signals.\n\nAirborne observation with a low-cost hyperspectral instrument: retrieval of NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and the satellite sub-grid variability over industrial point sources\n\nJong-Uk Park, Hyun-Jae Kim, Jin-Soo Park, Jinsoo Choi, Sang Seo Park, Kangho Bae, Jong-Jae Lee, Chang-Keun Song, Soojin Park, Kyuseok Shim, Yeonsoo Cho, and Sang-Woo Kim\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 197–217, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-197-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-197-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe high-spatial-resolution NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) were measured from airborne observations using the low-cost hyperspectral imaging sensor (HIS) at three industrial areas in South Korea with the newly developed versatile NO2 VCD retrieval algorithm apt to be applied to the instruments with volatile optical and radiometric properties. The airborne HIS observations emphasized the intensifying satellite sub-grid variability in NO2 VCDs near the emission sources.\n\nA nonlinear data-driven approach to bias correction of XCO2 for NASA's OCO-2 ACOS version 10\n\nWilliam R. Keely, Steffen Mauceri, Sean Crowell, and Christopher W. O'Dell\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5725–5748, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5725-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5725-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMeasurement errors in satellite observations of CO2 attributed to co-estimated atmospheric variables are corrected using a linear regression on quality-filtered data. We propose a nonlinear method that improves correction against a set of ground truth proxies and allows for high throughput of well-corrected data.\n\nMIPAS ozone retrieval version 8: middle-atmosphere measurements\n\nManuel LÃ³pez-Puertas, Maya GarcÃ­a-Comas, Bernd Funke, Thomas von Clarmann, Norbert Glatthor, Udo Grabowski, Sylvia Kellmann, Michael Kiefer, Alexandra Laeng, Andrea Linden, and Gabriele P. Stiller\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5609–5645, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5609-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5609-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes a new version (V8) of ozone data from MIPAS middle-atmosphere spectra. The dataset comprises high-quality ozone profiles from 20 to 100 km, with pole-to-pole latitude coverage for the day- and nighttime, spanning 2005 until 2012. An exhaustive treatment of errors has been performed. Compared to other satellite instruments, MIPAS ozone shows a positive bias of 5 %–8 % below 70 km. In the upper mesosphere, this new version agrees much better than previous ones (within 10 %).\n\nAtmospheric N2O and CH4 total columns retrieved from low-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Bruker VERTEX 70) in the mid-infrared region\n\nMinqiang Zhou, Bavo Langerock, Mahesh Kumar Sha, Christian Hermans, Nicolas Kumps, Rigel Kivi, Pauli Heikkinen, Christof Petri, Justus Notholt, Huilin Chen, and Martine De MaziÃ¨re\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5593–5608, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5593-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5593-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric N2O and CH4 columns are successfully retrieved from low-resolution FTIR spectra recorded by a Bruker VERTEX 70. The 1-year measurements at Sodankylä show that the N2O total columns retrieved from 125HR and VERTEX 70 spectra are −0.3 ± 0.7 % with an R value of 0.93. The relative differences between the CH4 total columns retrieved from the 125HR and VERTEX spectra are 0.0 ± 0.8 % with an R value of 0.87. Such a technique can help to fill the gap in NDACC N2O and CH4 measurements.\n\nA new accurate retrieval algorithm of bromine monoxide columns inside minor volcanic plumes from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI observations\n\nSimon Warnach, Holger Sihler, Christian Borger, Nicole Bobrowski, Steffen Beirle, Ulrich Platt, and Thomas Wagner\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5537–5573, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5537-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5537-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBrO inside volcanic gas plumes but can be used in combination with SO2 to characterize the volcanic property and its activity state. High-quality satellite observations can provide a global inventory of this important quantity. This paper investigates how to accurately detect BrO inside volcanic plumes from the satellite UV spectrum. A sophisticated novel non-volcanic background correction scheme is presented, and systematic errors including cross-interference with formaldehyde are minimized.\n\nEstimation of anthropogenic and volcanic SO2 emissions from satellite data in the presence of snow/ice on the ground\n\nVitali E. Fioletov, Chris A. McLinden, Debora Griffin, Nickolay A. Krotkov, Can Li, Joanna Joiner, Nicolas Theys, and Simon Carn\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5575–5592, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5575-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5575-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow-covered terrain, with its high reflectance in the UV, typically enhances satellite sensitivity to boundary layer pollution. However, a significant fraction of high-quality cloud-free measurements over snow is currently excluded from analyses. In this study, we investigated how satellite SO2 measurements over snow-covered surfaces can be used to improve estimations of annual SO2 emissions.\n\nSynthetic mapping of XCO2 retrieval performance from shortwave infrared measurements: impact of spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and spectral band selection\n\nMatthieu Dogniaux and Cyril Crevoisier\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2023-233,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2023-233, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for AMT\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany CO2-observing satellite concepts, with very different design choices and trade-offs, are expected to be put into orbit during the upcoming decade. This work uses numerical simulations to explore the impact of critical design parameters on the performance of upcoming CO2-observing satellite concepts.\n\nAssessing the potential of free tropospheric water vapour isotopologue satellite observations for improving the analyses of latent heating events\n\nMatthias Schneider, Kinya Toride, Farahnaz Khosrawi, Frank Hase, Benjamin Ertl, Christopher Johannes Diekmann, and Kei Yoshimura\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1121,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1121, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite its importance for extreme weather and climate feedbacks, atmospheric diabatic heating rates are not well constrained. This study assesses the potential of novel tropospheric water vapour isotopologue satellite observations for improving the analyses of latent heating rates. We find, that the impact of the isotopologues is small for events with weak latent heating rates, but significant for strong latent heating events, which have the strongest societal impacts (storms, flooding).\n\nTroposphere – stratosphere integrated BrO profile retrieval over the central Pacific Ocean\n\nTheodore K. Koenig, Francois Hendrick, Douglas Kinnison, Christopher F. Lee, Michel Van Roozendael, and Rainer Volkamer\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2150,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2150, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric bromine destroys ozone, impacts oxidation capacity, and is the main oxidant of mercury into its toxic form. We constrain bromine by remote sensing of BrO from a mountaintop. Previous measurements retrieved 2–3 pieces of information vertically, we apply new methods to get 5.5 vertically and 2 more in time. We compare with aircraft measurements to validate the methods and look at variation in BrO over the Pacific. More information will help chemical models and satellite measurements.\n\nThe IASI NH3 version 4 product: averaging kernels and improved consistency\n\nLieven Clarisse, Bruno Franco, Martin Van Damme, Tommaso Di Gioacchino, Juliette Hadji-Lazaro, Simon Whitburn, Lara Noppen, Daniel Hurtmans, Cathy Clerbaux, and Pierre Coheur\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5009–5028, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5009-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5009-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmmonia is an important atmospheric pollutant. This article presents version 4 of the algorithm which retrieves ammonia abundances from the infrared measurements of the satellite sounder IASI. A measurement operator is introduced that can emulate the measurements (so-called averaging kernels) and measurement uncertainty is better characterized. Several other changes to the product itself are also documented, most of which improve the temporal consistency of the 2007–2022 IASI NH3 dataset.\n\nA physically based correction for stray light in Brewer spectrophotometer data analysis\n\nVladimir Savastiouk, Henri DiÃ©moz, and C. Thomas McElroy\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 4785–4806, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4785-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4785-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes a way to significantly improve ozone measurements at low sun elevations and large ozone amounts when using the Brewer ozone spectrophotometer. The proposed algorithm will allow more uniform ozone measurements across the monitoring network. This will contribute to more reliable trend analysis and support the satellite validation. This research contributes to better understanding the physics of the instrument, and the new algorithm is based on this new knowledge.\n\nA research product for tropospheric NO2 columns from Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer based on Peking University OMI NO2 algorithm\n\nYuhang Zhang, Jintai Lin, Jhoon Kim, Hanlim Lee, Junsung Park, Hyunkee Hong, Michel Van Roozendael, Francois Hendric"
