Founded in 2003 as Orangescape, Kissflow is a leading cloud-based B2B Indian tech company offering disruptive SaaS platforms for business process, workflow automation and digital workplace. We are headquartered in Chennai, India, and have operations in North America.

Kissflow’s suite of products are used globally across 160 countries, including more than fifty Fortune 500 companies.

In 2019, we embarked on a brand consolidation exercise where we changed the US company name OrangeScape Technologies to Kissflow Inc. Since then, we have begun to use the brand name Kissflow in all regions including India.

We are in the process of making changes in our social media company pages as well – this includes Linkedin, Twitter & Facebook.

Henceforth, we’d like the company to be referred to as Kissflow.
