        "text": "In my first experience with OrangeScape, I was interviewed by Suresh for sales. However, he thought I would be a better fit for the Partner program. He said he saw potential in me and offered me an opportunity to be a part of building something new. This was really exciting for me.\n\nOn the same day that I joined, I jumped into a live call. The freedom to hire someone who would be a good fit turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made at OS.\n\n“You have to check out this company.”\n\nPretty soon into my time, my friends noticed something different about me. I was really happy about going to work and eager to spend time there. When my roommate was thinking about switching jobs I told him he needed to look into OrangeScape.\n\nSo why have I enjoyed things here so much?\n\nThe Partner team in OrangeScape, which functions like a startup within a startup. So, it requires a lot of effort and input from people who are more experienced. As a result, I’ve been able to interact with a lot of different people and learn about the culture.\n\nThere are three specific things that I’ve noticed that are very unique about the culture here.\n\n1. Accessibility to Wisdom\n\nI have access to the entire leadership team anytime I want it, and they are always ready to help. Suresh has been incredible as we develop our strategy. He pushes us to our limits and is willing to support anything we want to try. I can call up people late at night and they are nearly always ready to give me the help I need. Once, I pinged Suresh at 4am in the morning and he replied within 10 min.\n\nI’ve yet to run into someone who won’t give me time. Even if they are busy, people will follow up with me and make sure that they answer my questions.\n\n2. No Team Ego\n\nWhen I need help from a different team, everyone is eager to help me and doesn’t silo off or treat my request just as a simple job. Everyone seems to share one vision, which is the vision of the company. Everyone buys into the fact that if the whole company succeeds, then we all succeed.\n\nBack when we started the partner team, I required a lot of help from the sales team. I felt like I was always bugging Rakesh, Santhosh, and Kabeer, and I knew that they were very busy people and had other responsibilities. But they were always very accommodating and helped me with everything I needed.\n\nGayathri was the first person I worked with at OS. I was trying to learn the product, but had a lot of questions. Gayathri knows so much about the software, and even though I wasn’t on her team, she was very patient to help me and show me how to use KiSSFLOW.\n\nI see this a lot in knowledge transfers. In my previous company, knowledge transfers were done very poorly, and you had to start from scratch most of the time. However, here at OrangeScape, I find that people really care about knowledge transfers because they see it for the good of the whole company.\n\n3. The value of discussions\n\nI’ve worked with managers who were very willing to let me try anything and would approve even large budgets for ideas that I had. However, it was always on me to make it a success from start to finish. There was no engaging discussions on my ideas or even a look at them in depth.\n\nNow at OrangeScape, I am learning the value of sharing my thoughts early with a lot of different voices. Whenever I run an idea past Suresh, he listens to it and makes it better by giving his input. The discussion might last for an hour, but when I come out of the room, I’m more enlightened by it and my original idea is ten times better.\n\nIn other companies, when you open new ideas up to discussion, your idea might get discussed to death, or someone else might feel threatened by it and take it for themselves or try to kill it. However, at OS, I have found that when I introduce a new idea, I always get positive, actionable feedback from a discussion and everyone wants to see it succeed.\n\nAnd it’s not always easy discussions. I’ve actually had a few intense conversations with some people, but I am amazed at the way others handle themselves speak confidently, but without ego (looking at you, Rakesh!). I really respect the way he manages his team and conducts himself during critical conversations.\n\nThere have been so many positives during my time here, and I’ve really enjoyed it a lot. I knew it was a special place when on my first day, I overheard Selva and Yogesh talking about buying a car. I sat near them and they immediately made me feel comfortable and included me in the conversation. So, from the first day, I felt like I had friends and wasn’t in a new place.\n\nI wouldn’t change anything about the OS culture right now, but I know we are in the middle of a rapid growth phase. I’ve seen other companies lose a lot of the culture they had built up during that time. So, as OS grows, I hope that it can maintain its unique culture."
