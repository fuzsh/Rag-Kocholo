Appian\n\nAppian in A Nutshell\n\nAppian historically was known as an Enterprise level Business Process Management (BPM) vendor but today pitches itself as a low-code application platform.\n\nOnline G2 reviews of Appian as a Kissflow competitor indicate that Kissflow scores higher in ‘ease of use’ and ‘ease to administer’ but overall, reviewers like the ‘ease of setup’ and prefer doing business with Appian.\n\nAppian Key Features\n\nLow Code\n\nProcess Automation\n\nProcess Intelligence\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nData Fabric\n\nTotal Experience\n\nCase Management Studio\n\nAppian Pricing\n\nAppian offers Standard, Advanced, and Premium pricing options.

They are separate products but can be combined.\n\nAlthough marketed as low code tools, citizen developers are challenged in meeting the demand for business process automation and finding it difficult to build solutions themselves using Power Apps and Power Automate.\n\nThe user interfaces are appealing but the tools have limitations in that you often get to a certain stage and then realize that coding experience is needed and a lot of free time to learn the nuances of each product to make them talk to each other and meet the needs of the business.\n\nPower Apps Key Features\n\nLow Code Development\n\nIntegration with Other Microsoft Tools\n\nAccess to Common Data Service\n\nMobile-first Design\n\nAI Builder\n\nPower Apps Pricing\n\nPower Apps is sold as Power Apps Premium.

'Part of the 365 offering' and 'Extremely helpful to build small scale apps and automate processes' were included in the positive reviews with cost, licensing and 'can get complex' comments listed often as the drawbacks.\n\n4.

It continues to mention that its cloud pricing is transparent, and tiered, based on BizAgi metrics that tie to Azure consumption and scaling. Their new roadmap includes AI features. Governance is also highlighted in the report saying it can be configured but would benefit from better packaging.\n\nFlowForma: the leading No Code Kissflow Alternative\n\nEvery organization wants to eliminate repetitive tasks, improve efficiency and optimize business processes but their digital transformation plan is heavily influenced by the number of internal processes, business users, and skillsets not to mention budgets.
