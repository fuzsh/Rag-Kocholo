        "text": "expert panel\n\nThe shift to remote work was jarring for companies and their team members who were new to the process, but many quickly adapted and came to appreciate the flexibility of working from home. However, one aspect of remote work remains a source of anxiety for many: troubleshooting and fixing the tech issues that inevitably pop up. When working in the office, it’s easy to fall into the habit of automatically pinging IT when your computer or software isn’t behaving as you’d expect. Tech team members are always willing to help out, but remote workers would be well-served to learn some troubleshooting basics — you’ll get back up to speed much more quickly if you can diagnose and correct the issue yourself, and sometimes fixes can only be carried out by someone on the spot. Fortunately, the tech products we use are more resilient than some of us believe, and many of the problems remote workers encounter are common and relatively easy to fix. The next time your tech acts up when you’re working from home, try the solutions below, recommended by the experts from Forbes Technology Council.\n\nexpert panel\n\nTech teams have a responsibility to their co-workers to ensure that everything they build is working. New upgrades typically have a few bugs to work out once the system is initially implemented, and tech teams rely on other employees to give them feedback. However, collecting this feedback from users isn't always easy. Most users know when something is wrong but don't necessarily know or want to make suggestions on how the tech could be adapted to suit their needs. Others just aren't willing to offer negative feedback because they are afraid it will be seen as criticism. Below, 12 members of Forbes Technology Council examine the most effective ways to get feedback from other employees when developing and improving internal-facing tech.\n\nexpert panel\n\nSmart home tech has made life a lot easier for many homeowners. Voice assistants like Alexa are among the most popular and well-known of the bunch, but this assistant is just the tip of the iceberg as far as home tech is concerned. Over the next 10 years, we're likely to see a revolution in how electronic devices interact with each other and the wider world. New innovations like internet of things (IoT) devices that can turn regular homes into smart homes are already becoming more affordable. Below, 13 experts from Forbes Technology Council discuss some of the smart innovations and key features of home tech they expect to see become commonplace within the next decade.\n\nexpert panel\n\nIn the world of technology, resistance to innovation can make or break a company. Even if you or someone on your team has a breakthrough idea, it may not gain traction (or funding) if people are wary of trying something new. Fortunately, it is possible to overcome this and other barriers to innovation—it just takes a bit of extra effort. As top industry leaders, the members of Forbes Technology Council have spent their careers overcoming obstacles to come up with and implement cutting-edge tech ideas. Below, they share 15 significant barriers to innovation they've encountered and how (and why) they pushed through to overcome them.\n\nexpert panel\n\nWhen a company is under a budget crunch, tech leaders may choose to outsource their projects to external companies and contractors. While this can save money over hiring an additional internal team member, it’s important to ensure that you’re partnering with the right people for the project. To help you forge a successful partnership, we turned to a panel of experts from Forbes Technology Council. Below they share 16 important factors to consider when searching for the right outsourced vendor for your needs.\n\nexpert panel\n\nMachine learning (ML) is quickly becoming a mainstay of the business world. Some entrepreneurs and small business owners may shy away from investing in it because they don’t fully understand the ins and outs of the technology. However, you can still make effective use of machine learning in your business without being an expert in it. We asked a panel of Forbes Technology Council members to share some smart ways entrepreneurs and small-business owners can make effective use of ML. See their best recommendations below.\n\nexpert panel\n\nAs consumers become increasingly connected with businesses on their smartphones and devices, many businesses develop mobile apps to connect with their customers. If your company is going the app route, you want to be sure it’s worth your time and money. While a mobile app can be an invaluable tool for many companies, certain company types may not necessarily need one. Below, the members of Forbes Technology Council share their best insights to help you determine if a native mobile app is right for your business. Be sure to ask yourself these 14 questions before you begin the app development journey.\n\nexpert panel\n\nMore people are working from home because of the coronavirus pandemic, and as a result, there’s been a significant surge in cloud use. Companies are relying on the cloud more than ever for file storage and business-critical programs, but these functionalities come at a cost. Knowing what cloud computing and programs your company does and doesn’t need can save you money in the long run. That's why we asked the experts of Forbes Technology Council how companies can get a handle on their surging cloud-computing costs. Follow their recommendations to help you stick to your IT budget.\n\nexpert panel\n\nSiri, Google Assistant, and Alexa are a few of the more common voice-activated assistants, but they aren't the only ones. As speech recognition tech has become easier to incorporate and more efficient in performing its tasks, more app designers have begun to include it in their development. As exciting as this is, there are yet many unknowns regarding voice-activated technologies' potential, as well as their impact on privacy and security. As with any new technology, we don't know for sure what the pitfalls of voice tech are and what negative aspects we could be facing down the road. Below, 10 members of Forbes Technology Councilshare some of the most important things users should know about their voice-activated tech.\n\nexpert panel\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning are two facets of modern technology that can have a massive positive impact on businesses today. However, as they are among the most cutting-edge technologies currently available, it's almost universally accepted that they are too expensive for some companies. However, thanks to more commercial providers entering the arena, the investment required for adopting either of these solutions is no longer excessive. With careful budgeting and a detailed plan, even small and medium-sized enterprises can implement relevant AI and ML technologies. Here, 14 professionals from Forbes Technology Council offer valuable tips for companies that want to incorporate AI/ML on a budget successfully.\n\nexpert panel\n\nRemote work is becoming more and more common, and companies are having to learn the best ways to keep their team in touch. This can be especially challenging in the field of technology. Many tech employees tend to keep their heads down and focus on the task at hand, so they might not be constantly monitoring their phones or emails for updates. As successful tech leaders, the members of Forbes Technology Council know how to effectively communicate with their teams, no matter where they're located. Below, they share 13 ways to effectively communicate with remote technology employees to keep everyone on the same page."
