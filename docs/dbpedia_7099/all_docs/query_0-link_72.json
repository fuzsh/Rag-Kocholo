One of the related workflows is the reimbursement of travel expenses after a business trip. The reimbursement process has its own set of challenges:\n\nIf the travel request and travel reimbursement approval workflows are standalone workflows, then the process of reconciliation of travel related expenses (mapping travel expenses to its project cost center, checking against the travel budget, travel advances paid etc) becomes tedious and is error prone. This problem is amplified if the expense reimbursements are done manually using paper based forms.\n\nIn the absence of an automated workflow, the reimbursements process could take longer, which is not beneficial for the employees.\n\nKiSSFLOW allows you to automate the travel reimbursement approval workflow and streamline the expense claim process for improved efficiency and reduced costs. Here’s an example. The employee submits a travel reimbursement request by updating the expense details and attaching the relevant bills. The reimbursement request is automatically routed for approval to the appropriate signing authority(ies) based on total expenses incurred and whether the request is submitted on completion of travel or in the interim. The reimbursement request is set to approved, if all of the following conditions are met: (a) The travel reimbursement is submitted on the completion of a trip; (b) the total expenses incurred for the travel is less than the estimated total cost of the trip. Even if any one of the conditions are not met, the travel reimbursement request is sent to the manager for approval, and then to the respective department head. For example, if the trip is exceptionally lengthy (>3 weeks), expenses can be submitted in the interim as well, but this requires approval from the manager and the department head. Once the approvals are given, the request is sent to the finance team for travel expense reimbursement.\n\nHow to build a Travel Reimbursement approval workflow in KiSSFLOW?\n\nKiSSFLOW offers an easy 5-step wizard to build the Travel Reimbursement approval workflow that can be used across the existing user base of your Google Apps domain. The 5-step wizard guides the user through the process of creating their workflow and thereby eliminates any possibilities for users to miss out any steps. When KiSSFLOW is added from Google Apps marketplace, KiSSFLOW automatically syncs Users/Groups from your domain. You can assign them as workflow participants and collaborate with them on your workflows.\n\nHere are the 5-steps for building the travel reimbursement approval workflow for your company, and a slide deck with sample screenshots of the workflow.\n\nAssign who can initiate the Travel Reimbursement approval workflow\n\nStart defining your workflow with a name – ‘Travel Reimbursement’. For the purpose of this example, let’s say any user can raise a travel reimbursement. You can retain the default value ‘Everyone’ for ‘Who can initiate?’ so that the travel reimbursement approval workflow is available for all the users. If the travel reimbursement workflow is to be used only by a select set of users from your company or only the users from a department can use the travel reimbursement workflow, you can assign access to designated users who can raise a travel reimbursement by specifying the list of users and/or groups from your Google Apps domain.\n\nDesign the Travel Reimbursement Form\n\nTravel reimbursement form has been designed to capture the requestor details, travel request details, advance details and expense details. The request details such as ‘Travel Expense ID’, ‘Requestor Name’, ‘Date Submitted’ are automatically updated using simple formulas ['Travel Expense ID': auto-generated sequence number', Requestor Name' : CreatedBy.FullName, 'Date Submitted': today()]. A table has been created for capturing the expense details so that users can enter multiple entries. The transactional lookup feature is used to fetch the travel request details submitted by the user requesting the travel reimbursement, so that the expense reimbursement can be requested only against an previously approved travel request. The travel request details such as project cost center, advance paid, estimated travel cost, duration of the travel are fetched based on the travel request selected. The requestor can also attach the expense bills to the request using the attach docs button.\n\nDefine Travel Reimbursement workflow\n\nWe’ve defined the travel reimbursement approval workflow that includes a two step approval process — initial approval by project manager and then the final approval by department head. The project manager and department head approvals are required only when: (a) The total expenses incurred by the employee on the business trip is greater than the estimated cost of travel; or (b) If the business trip is exceptionally lengthy (> 3 weeks) and the employee decides to submit the reimbursement request in the interim, before the completion of the trip. To automate the project manager and department head approvals, the following formula has been specified for ’Execute when’: OR(Total_Expenses>Estimated_Travel_Cost, AND(Date_Submitted>From_date, Date_Submitted<To_Date, Duration>21)). Once the necessary approvals are given, the travel reimbursement is sent to the finance team for expense reimbursement.\n\nConfigure visibility permissions of Travel Reimbursement form\n\nThe visibility and editability of all the fields in the Travel Reimbursement form can be configured in this step. By default, the entire form as designed in Step-2 will be visible to all the users; the form will be editable for the initiators, while the form will be read-only for the project manager, department head, and the finance users. The expense reimbursement section will be updated only by the finance team. Hence, this section can be made editable only for the finance team for ’Expense Reimbursement’ process step.\n\nPublish Travel Reimbursement workflow\n\nThis is a single-click publishing that makes your Travel Reimbursement workflow available for the designated people at your company.\n\nKiSSFLOW provides a set of pre-built reports which you can use to view, analyse and gather insights about the travel expenses data submitted by users in your domain. - See more at > KiSSFLOW Feature Update : The All New Reports\n\nKiSSFLOW, as its name stands for, is a Keep it Simple & Smart Workflow for Google Apps that simplifies the entire process of Travel Reimbursement approval workflow creation for business users.

With the recent release on Mar 2nd, we have further enhanced the capabilities offered by KiSSFLOW. Here’s a quick look at the newly added features:\n\nProcess metrics report: KiSSFLOW provides the users with a set of pre-built reports that can be used to view, analyse and gather insights about the workflows. In addition to these reports on workflow data, out-of-the-box process performance metrics reports for measuring workflow performance, process step performance, and the participants performance will be available for process owners.\n\nTransactional lookup: Now you will be able to lookup other workflow data. For example, you can create a workflow to onboard a new client and then lookup the client information in the workflow for creating an opportunity, project etc. or you can lookup approved travel plans in travel claim workflow so that the claims are submitted for approved travel plans only. This feature combined with master data feature will allow users to create a complete solution such as order-to-cash, procure-to-pay and other sophisticated processes.\n\nMail “cc” notifications and custom content for email notifications: KiSSFLOW automatically sends notification emails to participants whenever a task is assigned them or whenever the request initiated by them is completed, rejected or queried. In addition to the users who are responsible for completing a task, certain users may just have to be kept informed about the progress of the request or completion of a specific task. With the new “cc” notification feature, email notifications can be sent to users both internal and external (other domain users) to keep them informed about the requests.\n\nWithdraw requests: Now the initiators can withdraw their requests that have not yet been approved. For example, you have submitted a leave request for approval that has been approved by the manager and is currently pending with the department head for approval. If you decide to cancel the leave request and apply for it later, then you can use the WITHDRAW option for In Progress requests to cancel the leave request. When the withdraw option is used, the notification emails will be sent to all the participants who have already acted on the request and to the participant with whom the request is currently pending for approval or input, and then the request will be deleted.\n\nDetailed posts on each of these new features will follow.\n\nThe post New features: Process metrics report (KPI), transaction lookup and more appeared first on .\n\n↧\n\nImportance of subject in workflow email notification\n\nKiSSFLOW automatically sends notification emails to the users whenever a workflow task is assigned to them and whenever a request submitted by them is completed, rejected or queried. The subject line and the content in the notification email is auto-generated by KiSSFLOW based on the process step, action taken by the user and the data in the form. The current limitation with the auto-generated subject line and content is that it doesn’t always provide sufficient information about the request. The subject in the notification emails is also used in the list view for tasks and requests.\n\nKiSSFLOW provides a familiar user interface consistent with that of Gmail, making it easier for the users to use KiSSFLOW. The list view in KiSSFLOW for tasks and requests includes the details such as From, Subject, Process Step and Date.\n\nKiSSFLOW’s user interface is very similar to that of Gmail’s\n\nClicking on INITIATE REQUEST button allows the user to select the required workflow request and submit it for approval after filling in the form. This is similar to how you would compose an email.\n\nThe tasks and requests in KiSSFLOW are listed similar to how emails are listed, and contains information required to identify the task/request. In emails, the subject helps you identify the mail content and its importance. In KiSSFLOW, Subject along with Process Step is used for this purpose.\n\nSubject provides the details about the workflow request while the process step helps the user identify the workflow step the request is currently pending in. Currently, KiSSFLOW automatically sets the subject — the process name is displayed similar to how labels are displayed in Gmail and the first mandatory field in the form is displayed alongside the process name.\n\nSome of our users had requested the ability to customize the subject because the default subject with the first mandatory field in the form does not always provide sufficient information about the request. One of the workarounds we had recommended the users for this problem was to create a placeholder field as the first mandatory field in the form and use the concatenate function to get the required information. This placeholder field could be hidden by configuring permissions for this field in STEP 4 Configure Permissions.\n\nIn our continuous effort to improve KiSSFLOW and make the whole experience better, we have implemented a new feature that will allow the users to easily customize the subject. Users can update the subject before publishing the process in Step 5 Publish.\n\nNotification Emails\n\nThe notification emails are sent to the workflow participants whenever a [approve request or provide input] task is assigned to them and to the initiators whenever their request is completed, rejected or queried. The email subject automatically set by KiSSFLOW included the process name, subject and process step type (Approve Request or Provide Input). The problem with this subject was that the participants were not able to differentiate between the notification emails using the subject line, especially when they performed two or more [approve request or provide input] tasks in the workflow. From Mar 2nd, the email subject line would include process name, subject and the current process step name. Additionally, users will also be able to add custom content to the auto-generated email notification content.\n\nThe post Importance of subject in workflow email notification appeared first on .\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCreate a Travel Request Approval Workflow for Google Apps\n\nTravel request approval workflow is one of the essential workflows for companies whose employees often need to travel for business. The lack of a proper travel request workflow poses the following challenges:\n\nRequest & approval process using spreadsheets and emails is difficult to manage with scale and is not transparent;\n\nTravel plans are often made at the last minute, resulting in high ticket costs; and\n\nNo control over travel costs, budget limits and approvals required.\n\nKiSSFLOW allows you to easily automate your travel request approval workflow to bring structure and better controls to the travel approval process. Here’s an example. The requestor specifies the purpose of travel along with the travel plans, estimated cost and cost center. The travel request is automatically routed for approval to the appropriate signing authority(ies) based on estimated total cost and travel advance requested. The travel request is automatically set to approved if all of the following conditions are met: (a) Estimated travel cost is specified by the requestor; (b) The estimated travel cost is less than the maximum travel cost allowed ; and (c) the travel advance requested by the requestor is less than a pre-defined value. Even if any one of the conditions are not met, the travel request is sent to the manager for approval, and then to the respective department head. Once the approvals are given, the request is sent to the admin team for making the travel arrangements and the finance team for providing the travel advance.\n\nHow to build a Travel Request approval workflow in KiSSFLOW?\n\nKiSSFLOW offers an easy 5-step wizard to build the Travel Request approval workflow that can be used across the existing user base of your Google Apps domain. The 5-step wizard guides the user through the process of creating their workflow and thereby eliminates any possibilities for users to miss out any steps. When KiSSFLOW is added from Google Apps marketplace, KiSSFLOW automatically syncs Users/Groups from your domain. You can assign them as workflow participants and collaborate with them on your workflows.\n\nHere are the 5-steps for building the travel request approval workflow for your company, and a slide deck with sample screenshots of the workflow.\n\nAssign who can initiate the Travel Request approval workflow\n\nStart defining your workflow with a name – ‘Travel Request’. For the purpose of this example, let’s say any user can raise a travel request. You can retain the default value ‘Everyone’ for ‘Who can initiate?’ so that the travel request approval workflow is available for all the users. If the travel request is to be used only by a select set of users from your company or only the users from a department can use the travel request workflow, you can assign access to designated users who can raise a travel request by specifying the list of users and/or groups from your Google Apps domain.\n\nDesign the Travel Request Form\n\nTravel request form has been designed to capture the requestor details, travel details, project details (cost center), travel itinerary, accommodation requirements and expense/ticket details. The request details such as ‘Travel Request ID’, ‘Requestor Name’, ‘Date Submitted’ are automatically updated using simple formulas ['Travel Request ID': auto-generated sequence number', Requestor Name' : CreatedBy.FullName, 'Date Submitted': today()]. A table has been created for capturing the itinerary details so that users can enter multiple entries. It could be used for updating the To and Return travel or for entering multiple options for same travel by listing their preferences in ’Special Instructions’ column in the table. A project master has been created for maintaing the project details including the project manager, travel allowances and cost center. This master has been used in the form to look up projects and associated details such as project manager, travel cost and travel advance. Expenses section allows the admin to capture the ticket and accommodation expenses incurred for making these arrangements. The travel admin can attach the tickets to the request using the attach docs button so that the requestor can take a print out if required.\n\nDefine Travel Request workflow\n\nWe’ve defined the travel request approval workflow that includes a two step approval process — initial approval by project manager and then the final approval by department head. To automate the project manager and department head approvals, the following formula has been specified for ’Execute when’: OR(Estimated_Travel_Cost=0, Estimated_Travel_Cost>Max_Travel_Cost, Travel_Advance>Max_Travel_Advance). Once the necessary approvals are given, the travel request is sent simultaneously to the travel admin for booking the tickets/accommodation and the finance team for providing the travel advance. ‘Parallel Branches‘ are used for sending the requests simultaneously to the admin and the finance team. ‘Provide Input‘ process step has been used in both the branches because booking the tickets and providing travel advance is just a task that needs to be get DONE. Also, finance team has to provide the travel advance only when the user has requested for it. So the following condition (Travel_Advance>0) has been used for the ‘Travel Advance’ branch.\n\nConfigure visibility permissions of Travel Request form\n\nThe visibility and editability of all the fields in the Travel Request form can be configured in this step. By default, the entire form as designed in Step-2 will be visible to all the users; the form will be editable for the initiators, while the form will be read-only for the project manager, department head, travel admin and the finance users.

With piles of work to be done, we maintain manual check-lists, spreadsheets, tracking calendar and so on. Soon, maintaining those calendars becomes another task. We want to focus on work at hand. And, wish there was an App for everything we do.So, we go out and look for an App. We try a product or two with the time that we steal from real work, make some compromises on what we really need, and buy an Off-the-Shelf solution. Now, an of-the-shelf solution is just that – a readymade solution to the most common of the problems that everyone faces. Fair enough, “my exceptional needs are not as common as to warrant being addressed by a product vendor” – we console ourselves and deal with it. And, now someone comes and tells us we can build our own business process the way we want. Are you nuts? One of the reasons we went out there and bought the off-the-shelf product is that we don’t want to bang our heads with technical stuff. We’re filled up until neck with the stuff we can’t get done on business front, there’s definitely no leeway to bang our heads on technicalities and maintenance. No, seriously, every time we tried doing any tech-stuff, we found ourselves under a bigger pile of technical errors, administration issues and a mess that we didn’t have in the first place. And we can’t hire (more) technical staff. And now, you come and say that we can build our own business processes?\n\nYes, we do. And, there are reasons that we feel that you can do it. Rather, we feel that you are in the best position to do that – build your own business process – for at least some of your processes. Really. Here’s why we think so. You know your business process best. If you could really build your workflows the way want, without the technological bottlenecks blocking you, you are the best person to create it quickly. You will know what you want and how you want it. You will know where to focus on initially. You will know what are truly business exceptions and which exceptions are really not so critical to spend so much time building into the solution.\n\nYou will know where to start from, and which paths should get added as and when we proceed, so long as you can do that quickly too. You can do it if you don’t need a business-technology translation to get it done.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges, as process owners and Business heads know the hard way, is that making someone do what you want is tougher than doing it yourself, where ever possible. Technical implementers, most often are unaware of the business functionality, and communicating to them can be a lot of effort to get it right. If the technical translation of everything that you need is not needed, it should sound relatively doable. If you are using the same business lingo to define the process that you use in business, there’s no translation. You can do it if there are no plumbing and admin overheads. It is an obvious issue, if software needs to be installed and maintained on your hardware. The overheads just do not justify some simple inexpensive solutions for getting some of the mundane tasks done. If the solution is available over a browser, any technical maintenance is not your headache. …And, if you’re guided through a wizard, without a technical prerequisite. If you could use Gmail or any other business productivity software, then it should be encouraging to know that a wizard-driven process creation on KiSSFLOW is not even as hard. Most of our customers have been able to build their first processes very quickly, and we have thousands of them! We might sound nuts to suggest you build your own business process. But, that was the idea & premise on which we even built KiSSFLOW – to enable you to do just that! Worth trying at least?\n\nThe post Build my own business process, are you nuts? appeared first on .\n\n↧\n\nHow KiSSFLOW went Animate (the GoAnimate video blog!)\n\nThere are way too many people out there who advocate having an explanatory video for your product. And I agree! It’s a fantastic medium to get the message across, provided it is – wait for it…\n\nREALLY GOOD.\n\nBut there’s also the question of whether you really need a video for your product. There are quite a few things you need to factor in to make an informed decision here. Since we went through the process of making that decision, we’ll share some information with you, in the hope that you’ll find it helpful.\n\nYou need an explanatory video for your product if :\n\nYour message is really clear, but you need visual impact to get it across effectively. Sometimes, words just don’t do as much justice as watching a sad man facing the problem that you’re trying to solve.\n\nThe users you’re trying to target don’t have the time / attention span to read lots of text content, but can spare a minute or two to watch an explanatory video. This means you will have a wider reach, business users, kids, teens, moms, geeks… hold on… almost everyone, except the professor type people. Now, they like to read a lot.\n\nYou want to add some entertainment value to your product website. You really need to be careful here and play with the line where the video turns into annoyance from entertainment. If small excerpts of text does the job, that’s what will be most effective. Don’t put the video there just because other people are doing it.\n\nAfter taking the decision of whether to make a video or not, we can move on to how to get this done. Of course, if the above points still don’t help you make a decision, you might as well just give it a shot and see how things go. Only problem is, making an explanatory video involves a whole lot of work.\n\nCome up with a great script that conveys the problem statement and why your product would take away the pain that the customer is facing.\n\nBrainstorm and decide on the look and feel of the video. It could be animated, it could be real life, comical or serious, dialogues or narration, musical or mime. There are just so many different ways to convey your message. Pick what fits your audience the best. Or pick something entirely in contrast to your audience’s mind set if you’re bold enough to take the risk. This could work extremely well or backfire. For example, if you are marketing to business users, you could show the business users in you video as beach models – just to say how much easier their lives would be if they use your product. But hey, I’m just the one giving out the ideas – don’t hold me to it .\n\nThe biggest challenge is to keep your video short. Nobody has the time to watch a 5 minute video, let alone a 40 minute one. The ideal time for an explanatory video is 1.5 minutes. You could push it to 2 mins. Three minutes is a stretch – but if you have great content, go for it!\n\nThe actual trouble would be production and post production of the video. So doing all of the pre-processing work only gets you so far. You still need to implement this. How on earth are you going to hire the resources – animators, cartoonists, cinematographers, editors, musicians, voice over specialists! Not to mention the budget to pay for all this. Engineering doesn’t understand why you need a stupid video. They’re going to veto any budget allocation straight away.\n\nWe faced all these problems too. If you find an animator, he / she won’t do the voice-over. If you find a voice-over specialist, they won’t do the music. And even if you get all these things done, there’s a million different corrections and so many restrictions! Distributed resource management is a bane.\n\nGood news is, there’s a way out. Here’s where these guys come in.\n\nAnd how cool are they!\n\nGoAnimate (also known, and stylized as Go!Animate) is a cloud-based platform for creating and distributing animated videos. GoAnimate’s platform allows individuals to develop both narrative videos, in which characters speak with lip-sync and move around, and video presentations, in which a voiceover narrator speaks over images and props, which may also move around. All video styles can be supported with background music and effects.\n\n- [Source:Wikipedia]\n\nAnd hell yeah they know what they’re talking about. It took me about half an hour to learn how to use their studio and get to work. They offer a freemium plan which lets you try out how the creation of the video happens. They even allow you to export the free video, only condition being, their logo appears on the video (and I think that’s totally fair – once you try them out, you wouldn’t mind giving them credit at all!). Of course you can upgrade to an extremely reasonable plan ($39) and they give you a whole lot of other stuff (characters, scenes) that you simply fall in love with.\n\nWhat’s great about GoAnimate is that, you have everything you need right there. There are characters for each scenario – business, kids, space ninjas, even little monsters! And oh man, each character is so well animated. They can do everything you could possibly want your characters to do in your explanatory video. You can animate the characters to type, cry, laugh, surf, scream, go shopping, fall in love – like I said, anything you can think of!\n\nTheir props gallery is extensive too. And if you don’t find something in there, it’s extremely easy to use the import option to import it to your gallery and start using it. The backgrounds and scenes are also fantastic. There’s offices, restaurants, pubs, shopping malls, grocery stores, bedrooms, meadows, and heaven too! I really want to make a video with angels and God just to use that background.\n\nWhat I discovered really late during the process but was such a fantastic find was the “Starters” tab in the backgrounds sections. These starter animations are tiny bits of pre-animated scenes (1-2 scenes) that is something most people would want to just plug in to their video. For example, the final call to action screen in your video – with the company logo and social networking icons, a promotion scene, a contract signing scene, etc. It’s awesome.\n\nAnother great feature that really helps in the process of video creation and iteration is the text to speech option that GoAnimate provides. All you need to do is, type out the character’s dialogue in a speech box or the narrative text in the scene’s narration box, pick an accent and hit Add Voice. It’s a little robotic, but it’s amazing how it just brings your video to life. It’s good enough to keep if you don’t have the budget to get a voice over done. But most importantly, it gives you the effect of an almost done video and is great for iterations before you finalize and move to voice over. If the feature wasn’t present, you’d probably have to imagine the voice while reading the text or spend money re-doing the voice over if anything changes. Best part is, the animated characters lip sync to the speech!\n\nFinally, the voice over. Initially, we thought this was going to be an expensive affair. Until one of my colleagues, Kausikram, stumbled onto Fiverr.com. This is a really cool marketplace that let’s people post services for $5. And guess who’s on it? Really awesome voice over artists! That’s where we found Nathan : This guy with a fantastic voice, who became the voice of the KiSSFLOW video. He was extremely co-operative, affordable and fast! I sent him the script on Monday and he had the voice over file in my inbox by Wednesday. For an extra $5, he even timed the voice to the video. Kudos to you Nathan. Lots of love from all of us at KiSSFLOW!\n\nWell, GoAnimate and Fiverr allowed us to create an amazing explanatory video in less than two weeks, in under $50. And that, to us, is FANTASTIC value for money. The only thing we needed to do was put our heads together to come up with a script.\n\nNow that I’ve told you all that, don’t you want to watch the video?\n\nWe ask you, has your workflow been KiSSed lately?\n\nThe post How KiSSFLOW went Animate (the GoAnimate video blog!) appeared first on .\n\n↧\n\nCheck out this cool video on Automated Workflows vs Automatic Cars\n\nOur Super woman, Shar has created this cool new video for KiSSFLOW correlating automated workflows and automatic cars.

Business identifies Process Transformation as one of the priorities. A top-notch Business Consulting Firm engages with stakeholders and identifies the key Business Process areas that could be “transformed”, with quantifiable ROI and qualitative competitive advantage.\n\nBusiness Consultants, Domain SMEs, Process Experts get their heads together over weeks and months to document the As-Is Processes. They define the To-Be processes while Technology Consultants undergo a massive Technology Selection exercise for Technology Refresh to support the To-Be Process Vision. Process Discovery, Process Mapping, Process modeling, Documentation and Software Requirements Specs ensue. And, the organization is already sitting long way into the tunnel with millions of Dollars (or hundreds of thousands of dollars) burnt on “paperware” and some bit of platform development activity with no specific business results in sight.\n\n“We’ve just got started”, the program managers exclaim when asked for the results.\n\nA year down the line, everyone is celebrating the first few processes in production, by when some of the assumptions are challenged, and business scenarios have already altered diagonally from the time the exercise started off. Not to mention, the organizational changes and the business funding nuances that sometimes throw the plans off-track. Complications, risks, business dynamics, technological challenges, and organizational skill sets are some of the multiple factors that keep jeopardizing the mega process transformation projects.\n\nWe all learn from these stories.\n\nWe want iterative, business driven, objective-oriented and agile process management environment.\n\nProcess Consultants want a seamless modeling-to-execution environment where they can make progress with the business users without having to rely wholesomely on IT to perform Projects A, B, C in order to get to a starting point in process execution for Baseline Process.\n\nWe have been wanting a Self-Service Process Automation platform where Businesses can create and manage workflows without having to go to IT for every little step. We want to make progress on Business front, bit by bit, and improve the processes one step at a time, in an iterative manner, without labeling the initiative a BPM project or an IT project or a Business Transformation program.\n\nWe want to get rid of these Million Dollar Process Consulting Logjams, and make BPM happen as we go. Not even that. We don’t want a BPM project. We want the Business Processes built the way we need for Business. We want to be able to go agile, on business. We want Business to take focus. Process Maps, Process Documents, IT Requirements and Process Transformation Analysis are fine, but we need the business running while all that (if at all needed) happens.\n\nSo, how would nice would it be if:\n\nBusiness can focus on 90+% of the processes that they know work well, instead of getting locked into the exceptional paths that drive these projects crazy\n\nConsultants can focus on building the processes and see them work on the ground without having to wait for months or quarters, in order for any analysis to even start kicking in.\n\nBusiness and implementation can talk the same language when referring to business process attributes and variables, and the metrics. Business Process Models and Process Implementation Models wouldn’t be two different things.\n\nTechnology is available for use. Platform doesn’t require a Technology track to wait for months before the first level access to the platform is made available for creating the processes.\n\nThe technology investment doesn’t run hundreds of thousands of dollars at the promise. Pay-as-you-go and Decide-as-you-proceed, so to say.\n\nWelcome, Workflow on the Cloud, ready to use.\n\nWelcome, Self-Service Workflow Automation.\n\nWelcome, The Business Users driven Workflow creation and management.\n\nLet the Business happen, and BPM is done in the process.\n\nThe post Getting Business Process Management done: Beyond those Million Dollar Logjams appeared first on .\n\n↧\n\n7 Things that WILL go wrong when you run a Webinar\n\nSo we recently had a Webinar, and as anyone who would have already run a Webinar would know it, The first person to signup was good old Murphy ! We were prepared for him, but good old Murphy really has his way around right!! So keeping up with the spirit of sharing, here is a list of 7 things that would go wrong when you run a Webinar . Watch out for these common webinar mistakes and I am sure your Webinar will be Awesome !!\n\nYour Computers will crash at the last minute thanks to Windows. Oh, don’t even bother about Linux GoToMeeting will not even work there.\n\nSo computers crashes, you are smart to switch to a backup and hell!! The presentation deck on the backup system will not be the latest one.\n\nInternet will be slow. Internet will not even work. Remember to buy your service provider a few beers on the day before the event, just in case…\n\nTo add to your luck, exactly during the webinar your office space provider (TIDEL Park) will switch the power systems, the quality polycom phone you are using will shut-off without power.\n\nYour admin team was smart and they did anticipated this and add a UPS to the polycom phone line. However, they never check the battery on the UPS. Sigh!\n\nMicrophones will go Kapoot, speakers might go pop, and then there is this horrible audio feedback that will relay a Neil Armstrong style “one small step for man”, 8 mins after you actually say it.\n\nFlash player will stall, and Java would want to update in the middle of your session.\n\nAh and one more thing!!\n\nYou were smart enough to take precaution against all of it right ?! WRONG!! , If you are doing a demo you might want to check to have a stable version your app on your computer, chances of your junior most programmer checking in a small change that would crash the app is a lot more probable than you think. 500 Error. Damn It!!!\n\nThe post 7 Things that WILL go wrong when you run a Webinar appeared first on .\n\n↧\n\nGIT vs SVN – The real reason to move away from SVN\n\nSvn doesn’t last long\n\nSvn was designed with the inherent assumption that the context of a developer within any single codebase would be linear, but as a team scales, bugs arise and features are added to a product, that assumption quickly falls apart. Developers need to have the ability to constantly switch between fixing bugs and working on features. Developers while working in SVN would simply commit the changes they make before switching to working on something else. Eventually the repository would have incomplete and unstable codes, quickly spiraling out of control.\n\nThe real problem starts when other developers get the unstable code and they start working with it.\n\nStable and Development branches will help improve this situation. Although subversion’s branching helps quite bit, over a period of time it too deteriorates. So to bring back sanity Locks are introduced and just like threads developers too enter deadlocks and everything just falls apart.\n\nGit to the rescue\n\nGit specifically designed to solve this problem. Git branching is so powerful yet so cheap that it becomes difficult not to use it and branching is well complemented with Git’s superb merging feature.\n\nSwitching context is quite easy with Git, just create / switch to a branch and continue working, and when the work is done just merge them back into the central master branch.\n\nGit is a distributed version control system, so unlike svn creating a branch does not make it available to other people.\n\nGit branching is also cheap and quick, unlike svn in which a branching creating a new copy of code. Git also preserves history when branching, unlike Svn.\n\nGit isn’t without problems though, Git has a complex branching and merging model, Git commit tree structure is hard to understand, DVCS concepts are difficult to comprehend etc.\n\nSvn has many well built GUIs, which makes it easy for beginners to pick it up, Git on the other hand does not have any GUI that matches the quality of GUIs built for Svn. The command line interface for git isn’t easy to use for first timers and svn migrants. People who are used to Svn GUIs would especially find it difficult to it.\n\nGit’s branching and merging though very powerful, flexible and useful, is quite difficult to comprehend unless the person has burnt their hands at a central version control system.\n\nThe branching and merging works well because commits are a collection of patches on a tree structure, which by its own definition needs a lot of support for people to understand.\n\nFinally the concepts that commits are local and that they need to be dumped to the remote repository by copying it, leads to a lot of questions and confusions, especially to people who are damaged by central version control systems.\n\nMigrating from svn\n\nThe migration process is surprisingly simple, just clone the svn repository with git-svn and push it to a git repository. Cloning the svn repository may take a long time though. Our repository with over 11k commits took 40 minutes to clone, while pushing the same to a git repository took only 2 minutes.\n\nThe github workflow\n\nOur Github workflow is very similar to any open-source project on Github. Every team member forks a private organisation repository. They commit and push their changes to their forks and send in pull requests when code becomes stable. Issues are maintained on the central github repository and can only be closed by commit messages and accepting pull requests.\n\nThe central github repository has 2 branches, master and production, new features and bug-fixes are sent as pull requests to the master branch of the central repo. The production branch contains the most recently deployed code. Pull requests sent to the production branch are patches that need to be urgently fixed.\n\nThe reason that master and production branches exist is because testing and deployment are currently quite time consuming.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThe migration to git initially reduced the productivity of the team but it has drastically reduced mistakes and improved traceability of code changes. We are working towards reducing the time it takes to test and deploy code, once that is achieved we would easily be able to move a single branch workflow.\n\nDiscuss on HN https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6487567\n\nThe post GIT vs SVN – The real reason to move away from SVN appeared first on .\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n[Free Public Webinar] Why on earth should I automate my Workflows?\n\nKiSSFLOW is proud to bring to you a free webinar discussing the perils of manual processes in your workplace.

At KiSSFLOW we talk with our customers regularly and understand where our product stands. This time around I had the chance of talking to Paul Strahl, the Head Consultant at Tech Alchemy, Australia’s business transformation IT specialists. It turned out to be a very insightful conversation. Paul began to share his insights on why many SMEs today despite using a combination of multiple systems fail to track process efficiently.\n\nMany organisations today use a combination of emails, spreadsheets, invoicing and CRM software to track their processes. In most cases these organisations get sucked into the eddies while trying to get these individual systems to work and lose track of the big picture. Although the resultant chaos in the organisation is visible, what’s gone wrong is not really known. In most cases people never realize that the problem is actually with the process in place and not merely the complexity in tools involved. Unearthing the flaws in the process is a humongous task and this is where process management experts like Paul can be of great help.\n\nPaul who has a decade of experience in providing technology solutions with expertise in data analytics and business process, points out that, it is not until the processes are mapped that one realizes the problem is with the process flow and not just the systems used. Usually, Paul and his team analyze the existing process of an organization, map it, then reinvent it to figure out an optimal way that will cut cost and improve quality of operation.\n\nPaul: “What used to take a day previously is now just a click away.”\n\nOnce he figures out the optimal flow of processes the next part involves finding a tool that can automate the flow, this is where KiSSFLOW fits in. Paul said, KiSSFLOW’s capability to model a process that exactly fits the way the customer operates really, enables them to achieve good efficiency for their end customers. Paul asserts that “there are many systems where people lose visibility and requests fall through cracks in the system, KiSSFLOW does not let that happen, nothing escapes.”\n\nPaul and his team have been serving eastern Australia and his process driven clients have been KiSSFLOWed. His clientele is quite diverse, from logistics companies to web development companies. It just proves that when an elegant process is sculpted and is automated in capable tool, then the result is obvious in terms of reduced costs and time. Paul is definitely one of our champions.\n\nThe post Tech Alchemy- Business Process Transformed appeared first on .\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nNorthshore Education Creates Tech Armed Educationalists with KiSSFLOW\n\nOn my continued conversations with our KiSSFLOW customers, few weeks ago, I spoke with Mark Hodgkins of Northshore Education Consortium (NEC), who in the recent past headed a school as the Principal and holds over two decades of diverse supervisory and management experience having worked in various capacities in the child services system. Mark is a passionate educator but his passion doesn’t limit him to the academic functions of the school alone. During the course of our conversation, Mark brought forth the significance of implementing Technology for the Administration of Educational Institutions.\n\nAn educational institution’s success can be determined by the quality of education imparted to the students and imparting education isn’t in the hands of teachers alone, the school’s administration plays a very crucial role too. Running a school involves a lot of work, it requires numerous teaching and non-teaching staff to work in unison to provide quality education to students. Administrators will have to coordinate with teachers for scheduling classes and approve time-off requests from the teachers after finding replacements for the faculty during their absence without jeopardizing the class schedule. Apart from these, administrators handle monetary reimbursements, pay cheques and other financial transactions too. Phew!.. All of this is sure to involve tons of paper work and running around. Running a consortium of schools is a lot more challenging in terms of the work input and time spent to manage it.\n\nNEC has it’s school sites at 5 locations and all the communications between the business office and the schools were done through paper work. It was time consuming and taxing as it required their staff to travel between these locations every now and then. By the time the process is completed, it’d be anywhere between 3 to 5 days.\n\nAs the lead of the technology and automation project at NEC, Mark Hodgkins wanted to implement a tool that enabled them to manage information and business operations remotely as paperwork was just driving them crazy. On a search for workflow tools, it wasn’t a surprise when Mark located KiSSFLOW the leader in workflow and business process management for Google Apps Customers. Mark Hodgkins is self taught when it comes to computers and has no formal training in IT, it wasn’t long before he started constructing his Workflow processes.\n\n“..KiSSFLOW was the closest to what we needed..”\n\nMark now helps his colleagues to create processes on KiSSFLOW for optimizing their work and making their life less stressful. He quoted his director who once quipped “..I can now work from home, right?..”\n\nNorthshore Education Consortium, located in Beverly, Massachusetts,is the largest provider of intensive special education services to children and youth with emotional, behavioral, and developmental disabilities in the North Shore region. Consisting of five highly specialized and innovative programs, NEC carries out its mission day in and day out with more than 270 staff to educate, support and nurture over 380 special needs and at-risk students.

When you were just a few people working out of an office. When you knew the name of your colleague’s children and you had a tab on everything that was happening inside the organization? And then suddenly one day you started growing. There were a lot more people than you originally had. You started delegating. Managerial roles were created. They had to say “Yes” before something really got done! And a small H.R department was born. A few more years, and H.R has become a well oiled department. There are hundreds of people in your organization. You are only involved in very critical decisions. A process is now in place and everything is hunky dory. This is the story of any organization and what i just described to you is how your workflow management evolved along with your company.\n\nWhat is Workflow Management?\n\nIf we get a little pedantic then we can trace the term “workflow management” to the era of manufacturing where people like Fredrich Taylor and H.Gantt (yup we still do a lot of Gantt charts remember) worked towards optimizing and standardizing operations in a shop floor. A good century later, what we see today as workflow management is a proceduralized step of approvals that need to be sought along with systematic capturing of relevant information in order to attain an end objective. Very simply put its formalizing and formulating the steps through which a request would go through before it gets approved. This request can be a simple vacation request for your personnel or it could be a request to restock critical components for your shop floor.\n\nThe States of Workflow Management\n\nThe state of workflow management at your organization today largely depends on how big you are, what you do (your core business process), how fragmented you are, how your teams are oriented and how many auxiliary processes are involved along with your core business process. It is not uncommon to see certain workflows in an advanced state of maturity and certain other workflows in a state of total mayhem in the same organization. That said we have here tried to bucket the states of workflow management in your organization into four broad buckets:\n\nThe *NO* workflow state\n\nThis is the state when one or more of the following conditions prevail.\n\nthe number of people involved in a process is fairly low,\n\nthe complexity of the process is very low\n\nthe criticality of the process is low and\n\nthe fault tolerance is high\n\nYou could see this state in small organizations where an employee can walk up to his manager to get an oral approval for requests. You can also see this kind of state in large organizations when the process involved is non critical. Remember how you call Bob at administration in order to ensure that you have the conference room booked for you. You don’t fill a form, you don’t talk to your manager, you just call Bob.\n\nThis state is usually characterized but a high amount of mutual trust, a voluntary trade off of traceability and high flexibility. People do not care about how long it takes to get something done, how much of decisions are involved. They just want things to get done.\n\nThe *MANUAL* processing state\n\nThis is the state in which organizations entering their growth curve fall under. As the organization grows in size there no longer are cross functional managers, slowly departmentalization of works start taking place and this incurs complexity in workflow management. Though workflow management in itself is not a function, all the departments start owning their own workflows, finance puts in place a process for budgetary approvals, procuring puts in place a process for ordering inventory. HR starts tracking vacation approvals.\n\nThough communication and process step completion still very much remains informal like the previous state. There is a marked difference in that there is at least a process that is being pushed for. A key characteristic of this state is the presence of liasoning offices between the various functions. If Dave from engineering wants a new laptop, he will talk to his manager who will call Katie in finance. Katie will in turn check budgets and ask rob from procuring to get the laptop and ship it to Dave.\n\nThe data capture and manual approval state\n\nAs the organization proceeds in its growth curve, bottlenecks start appearing. Dave’s manager realizes that most of his day is spent talking to people at the other departments to move things for him. Katie in her turn realizes that she is getting way too many requests coming in. there are memos flying left right and center and there is no way to track anything. This is when Katie and people like Katie, start looking at utilizing workflow management systems. The simplest of which might be a Google or Wufoo form. If Katie knows better she will figure out a way to automate the capturing of data and the approval system.\n\nThis way Dave need not bother Katie any longer. All he needs to do is submit a request to Katie. Katie or one of her Colleagues can look at the request figure out if the budgets will work out and then Approve the request. The workflow management system will then automatically inform ton of the approval and will ask him to go ahead with the procurement.\n\nThis state emphasizes on Tractability, Tractability, Transparency, and Structure of the process workflow. People are replaced by Roles. Its no longer Katie and Rob. Its got to do with someone who can perform the duties of Katie and Rob.\n\nThe fully automated state with Overrides\n\nWhen an organization and its processes mature over time. So will its workflow management. This is a very typical case in organizations involved in manufacturing / production. And can be seen to an extent in completely determinate workflows of most organization. If the shop floor runs out of stock every Sunday and a procurement of raw materials needs to be carried every week at the same time and for the same amount. There is no need for Approval from the Finance department for every order. Finance will only come in when there is an unusual change in the requested order. This is characteristic of a Fully Automated Workflow Management System. Here business roles are replaced by pre-configured Computer Algorithms, and Human Intervention is required only when there is some abnormality involved. This is not only for your shop floor, this could be an automated request to maintenance to clean the conference room every Monday and an automated request to purchase bubble tops for the office.\n\nTo summarize we just saw the four broad states under which your workflow management can fall under. So which state of the workflow management are you in?\n\nThe post What state of Workflow Management is your organization in? appeared first on .\n\n↧\n\nSCREW THE IDEA OF A PAPERLESS OFFICE!\n\nIt irks me, we’ve been listening to this for the last many decades and still continue to look at it as a dream. Why is your office not a paperless one yet? Where did it go wrong? Does it not seem absurd when we have been able to get our ride on Mars and yet we’ve no effective solution to make our offices paperless? It may sound melodramatic but, the concept of “Paperless office” has stood out mocking us and seems to exemplify the failure of mankind. All through these years there has been a lot of development in technology to aid our transit to a paperless office and if you have not gone paperless yet, well, what the hell have you been doing?!\n\nYou probably tried to make your office a paperless one and seeing a few roadblocks, gave up the whole idea. That’s a shame. Sure, you can call me cocky, but yeah guess what, we made our attempt to go paperless. And were our efforts futile, that’s for you to read…\n\nOperation Papercut: Truth be said, running a paperless office is no easy job, but our team decided to take the voyage to a paperless office nevertheless. The first thing we did, set ground rules and guidelines..\n\nRule 1: Motivation for the road not taken, that’s what you need first more than anything at all. We promised ourselves the best of Scotch and a few many pints.\n\nRule 2: Well, Ted Roosevelt is known to have said “It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.” It’s alright if you screw it up, it can’t get any worse. So get your arse up already.\n\nRule 3: Be open about your orientation when it comes to paper, mock people who hand papers and documents to you. They’ve made you life miserable enough.\n\nFirst moves in making our office paperless: Identifying the cause for paper clutter in your office, we identified the ‘Who What When Why and How’ of the papers that encroached our space. Typically, the reasons for each paper to find space in the office, we got into war mode. This is when we discover the lawyers in us, defending the existence and purpose of every paper and file that we find important. When you are at it, you may win the argument and hold your pride, but this isn’t Boston Legal. Here is when you make use of the ground rules and get your act together..\n\nHours of document digging later we figured out the entire deal, the source for this paper infestation. Papers had poured in from within and outside our organisation, and some people just wanted to get the better of us..\n\nAnd we swore , we’d never to let that happen ever again..\n\nTackling Roadblocks :\n\nRoadblock 1 - We like to keep every piece of paper even if it is redundant..\n\nYes, only you will know the value of the document, no one has the right to discard it, keep it safe.. and with that you’ve contributed to the forgotten mountain pile of documents . It’s for people like us that digitizing is a boon, make your smart move and switch to Google Drive or Dropbox. Now the good part about this is, you can have all of your gazzlion files on the cloud and access them from anywhere. The better part is you can have all of them indexed!\n\nRoadblock 2 - We make notes, mark changes and express ourselves on the paper documents..\n\nShare your files without ink and paper: We switched to Google Docs. On Google Docs we now work simultaneously with our co-workers on documents and spreadsheets. Apart from compiling documents together, we get to post comments highlighting the changes in the documents. The auto save feature is a life saver. What’s more, we also get to view the multiple iterations made to the documents and know how the document shaped up. If your office is going Paperless, it’s just the right time to Go Google.\n\nRoadblock 3 - We have thousands of paperless transactions and bill payments..\n\nIt had always been a harrowing experience to track sales and expenses, sending those invoices and accepting payments, all these while keeping your accountants in loop, sure to drive anyone mad. Our accounts and administration department jumped on the opportunity to go paperless. These clever fellas switched to Quick Books. Running office finances is now a lot more easier to track and is prompt. We switched to email receipts for customers helping them keep their offices paperless. And similarly asked them to wire us the payments. If there’s a need for you to put your impressions on a document, use digital signature, it’s as good as your physical signature and saves you loads of time.\n\nA month down we got a paperless office, yeah beat that! It removed the clutter as expected but there was something more in store, our productivity increased multiple folds. Having stored documents on Google Drive, looking up files and documents was easier than ever before. Access control on Google drive just makes it a lot more safer and the chances of losing track of data is completely eliminated, data secured and accessible.\n\nTurns out, we didn’t screw it up! Time you got your paperless office. We discarded our file cabinets and filled the space with tools vital for a livelier office, a pantry, a dartboard and an XBox. After all, looks like there are many good reasons to go paperless\n\nThe post SCREW THE IDEA OF A PAPERLESS OFFICE! appeared first on .\n\n↧"
