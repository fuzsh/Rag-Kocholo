        "text": "I believe that successful ventures happen when an entrepreneur identifies a gap in the market. Once you know there is a missing link, you start searching for the solution and come up with a business idea. The story of uniRow is a case in point.\n\nAfter graduating from IIT Kanpur in 2004, Nimit Kumar worked at IBM Research Lab as a scientist for 3 years and then he worked at Gridstone Research. Finally, in 2011 he co-founded uniRow with Vikram Agarwal. Vikram graduated from IIT Delhi in 2007 and worked for Lehmann Brothers and Nomura Holdings. Nimit and Vikram went to the same school in Bhagalpur, Bihar, India.\n\nAll through his career, Nimit worked with remote teams, attended webinars and felt that something was missing. And he frequently found people saying how distance education was not creating the necessary impact. He left his job to explore more and found that there was a need for scalable, affordable, live collaboration platform in the market.\n\nuniRow is the result of their continuous effort to build a high-end, enterprise level product that will make online learning, webinars and any other form of live collaboration more participatory and engaging. Live collaboration is a method by which multiple people can collaborate in real-time virtually. Online classroom, webinars, video conferencing are different forms of live collaboration.\n\nuniRow provides a highly scalable platform for hosting webinars and video conferences that can be attended by many. Most of the existing platforms will require high bandwidth to deliver video in real-time. But the adaptive video technology of uniRow works well at lower bandwidth as well, a requirement for selling to the Indian market. Nimit and Vikram designed uniRow keeping the challenging Indian scenarios in mind. They kick-started with education, healthcare and training companies in India to help them deliver quality services to their clients in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. They are about to scale up the India operations and ready to explore international market.\n\nMany businesses in the online education, healthcare and corporate training sector are using uniRow. The product can be seamlessly integrated with other web products; uniRow is a purely browser based platform. uniRow works on low bandwidth scenario in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. It is very easy to use; people with minimum technical knowledge can use uniRow and, above all, it is cost effective.\n\nBusinesses like iPof India, a venture backed leading e-learning company, MyBSkoo, a premier business education company, Mencius Education, a US based English tutoring company for South Korean students, SRL World, leader in Healthcare, iJunxion, an India based leading audio conferencing provider, are all using uniRow.\n\niPof India which is funded by IDG Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners selected uniRow as a partner after evaluating several leading products in the market. iPof offers live online lectures to IIT and Medical aspirants through uniRow’s webinar platform. Their objective is to offer quality education in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities by bringing experienced faculty online. uniRow was integrated seamlessly with iPof’s platform and they went live with their new program within 3 weeks of finalizing the partnership with uniRow.\n\niJunxion is another important partner, also a startup. In this partnership, two startups have joined hands to leverage each other’s strength and grow together. iJunxtion is a Mumbai, India based audio conferencing provider that caters to Indian enterprises primarily. It offers integrated audio and web conferencing technology. The company is founded by Dhananjay Saheba, ex CTO/VP of VSNL, Tata Teleservices and Hughes Telecom, India.\n\nAccording to Nimit, existing products are more suitable for enterprise meetings and less for collaboration in the social world. Nimit defines ‘being social’ as follows: it is not all about using social media, it is the ability to be connected to those who share common interests so that information flows to you through connections. That’s what uniRow does. The team is designing the next generation of live collaboration platform and they are in the process of filing patents in this area.\n\nScaling up India operations and getting connected with the enterprises as partners is the most important thing on their radar now. Nimit is also eyeing the international webinars and training market. For this, they have to prepare the platform technologically to handle the growth. And herein lies one of the biggest challenges; finding software engineers with strong R&D sense is difficult in India. Apart from this, Indian enterprises are not very active in terms of adapting new technologies and they hardly buy online. As a result the purchase cycle gets longer.\n\nBut uniRow is gradually overcoming these challenges. It was started in Nimit’s apartment in 2011 when only Nimit and Vikram used to code there. In last 6 months they have hired 9 employees and partnered with many companies also. They have reputed people of the industry as advisors and investors. Recently they have got confirmation from Zee Learn as a reference customer. Zee Learn is a listed company and has more than 1000 learning centers for animation, design and computer education. After evaluating other products, Zee Learn has decided to move with uniRow.\n\nSimilarly, other customers have also made decisions to adopt uniRow against competitive alternatives. The company is part of our 1M/1M premium program, and I have watched it go from a nascent state to the current situation where it has both customers and revenues.\n\nLong way to go but a great beginning for yet another Made-in-India product company!"
