        "text": "Kissflow recently announced they will be unveiling their unified digital workplace platform during Gartner’s Digital Workplace Summit, taking place virtually on April 27th, 2021. Kissflow Digital Workplace is a solution for growth-minded CEOs looking to enhance work productivity, boost employee engagement, and improve organization-wide collaboration.\n\nOur Buyer’s Guide for Business Process Management helps you evaluate the best solution for your use case and features profiles of the leading providers, as well as a category overview of the marketplace.\n\nKissflow, from OrangeScape, offers a cloud-based BPM solution suitable for businesses of all sizes. The software automates business processes and monitors performance. Additionally, Kissflow helps initiate process requests, view items that require user actions, and approve pending tasks. The system comes included with 50 pre-installed business applications, including employee onboarding, vendor payment, mileage reimbursement, and much more. Users are able to download these applications, edit them as they see fit, or build their own applications from scratch.\n\nThere has been an explosion of workplace management tools due to the pandemic, many designed to help organizations in developing and managing their digital workplace. But the siloed nature of these applications, especially when stacked on top of each other, makes them reduce productivity as remote workers are forced to over-communicate.\n\nDuring the exclusive demo at the Gartner Digital Workplace Summit, Kissflow’s Vice President of Product, Dinesh Varadharajan, will demonstrate how the Kissflow Digital Workplace platform manages issues, tickets, cases, requests, approvals, tasks, conversations, discussions, polls, and member information through its intuitive interface. The demo will also show how the platform:\n\nReplaces communication with contextual collaboration;\n\nMakes other digital tools redundant with one platform to manage all your work, and\n\nRemoves complexity and chaos and brings in simplicity and control.\n\nIn a media statement, Suresh Sambandam, CEO of Kissflow, said, “work can bring many levels of complexity, so we wanted to drill down to the approach to work and make it easy for employers to offer a culture that makes things simple while empowering employees to work productively, collaboratively and with ease, minus the chaos that multiple digital tools can inflict. Kissflow provides one simple pre-integrated platform that unites people in collaborative work across workstreams no matter where they are.”"
