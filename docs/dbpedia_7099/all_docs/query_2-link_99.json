        "text": "We launched KiSSFLOW in 2012. Back then, we were very small and it was a team of superstars. We relied on individual talent and everyone on the team knew how their work was inextricably connected to the comprehensive vision of the product.\n\nAs with any SaaS business, getting our first 100 customers was a challenge for us and we needed to continuously experiment, fail, and course correct. Being small helped us tremendously during that phase as everyone was empowered and aligned to take up challenges and run forward.\n\nLet’s call this a “Team of Avengers”\n\nFast forward to 2014, we got our first 100 customers and the heroes were stretched. They were fighting so many challenges like getting more leads, scaling the product, revamping the sales process, etc. Now we needed more energy.\n\nAnd we considered the most obvious choices.\n\nScale the team\n\nBuild the hierarchy\n\nIntroduce processes\n\nMake the superheroes the Super-managers\n\nWe weren’t sure about this option, though. We did some research and we realised that building a big team is counter-productive. In one of the experiments, researchers Bradley Staats, Katherine Milkman, and Craig Fox proved that to build an identical Lego figure, two-person teams took 36 minutes and four-person teams took 52 minutes to finish- over 44% longer.\n\n“More people take more time.”\n\nBut why is that?\n\nIt turns out that the number of links we maintain across all the team members is a problem.\n\nIf we have a 6 member team then, we need to maintain 15 links and we double the team to 12, then the links shoot up to 66.\n\nIn a big team of 50, every individual needs to maintain 1225 links and it is impossible.\n\nWith that size, it’s extremely difficult to communicate effectively. The collective goal becomes the Chinese whisper.\n\nIn addition to that, we also don’t want to lose the other benefits of smaller teams like having a familial atmosphere and a tight-knit feeling. That’s when we wanted to embrace Amazon’s 2 pizza team structures. But we wanted more clarity of roles in that structure and we spotted Spotify’s squad framework.\n\nSquads\n\nEach squad at OrangeScape have the following characteristics:\n\nTeams of 5–7.\n\nThey are self-reliant, self-organizing teams.\n\nThey are cross-functional.\n\nEach squad is like a mini-startup.\n\nWe nominated a Squad Lead for each squad. A Squad Lead is more like a facilitator and not a typical manager.\n\nThis is how a normal squad in OrangeScape looks like:\n\nBut what happened to our experienced super-heroes, who were running the whole show by themselves.\n\nFor them we have chapters. Chapters are groups formed based on competency. And all our superheroes are leading chapters right now.\n\nThis is more of a mentoring role. The chapter leads define the best practices and train the chapters regularly.\n\nWe have young guns firing in all cylinders now. They run the squads. They feel empowered, and we are able to significantly reduce the bottlenecks.\n\nWith the squad, we are able to release more often. With the squad framework we got more superheroes running the show at OrangeScape.\n\nWatch out\n\nThis framework posed its unique set of challenges that we are still trying to overcome.\n\nYou need to recruit superheroes not minions.\n\nIt is difficult to give up control. As a tech lead, now you need to rely on bunch of young folks to run the show.\n\nTrust > Control\n\nThe tech leads should focus on aligning and empowering the team instead of running the show themselves.\n\nFacilitate. Don’t interfere"
