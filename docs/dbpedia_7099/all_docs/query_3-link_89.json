        "text": "Work has never been more complex than it is right now. In many organizations, there are more tasks to complete than there is time to do them. Speed and efficiency define work in this information age, and the biggest challenge isn’t reaching goals — it’s managing workflow.\n\nWorkflow management software helps you organize and track projects to keep team members on the same page about what they need to do. These platforms streamline communications, improve productivity, and even automate simple and repetitive processes, such as email notifications, follow-ups, and approvals.\n\nTwo of the best workflow management software platforms are Kissflow and Pipefy. Both are well-regarded tools, and they each have a large user base. But which one should you choose? Here’s what you need to know when it comes to Kissflow vs Pipefy.\n\nKissflow overview\n\nKissflow isn’t your average workflow management software. It’s a framework that lets users customize systems for project management, case management, and collaboration. Recognizing that the future of work is in the cloud, Kissflow allows users to share a workflow with team members and stakeholders for easier collaboration and task management.\n\nUsers can design their ideal workflows and continually tweak them without interrupting their processes. Kissflow boasts more than 10,000 customers in 160-plus countries, and major corporations trust it — Michelin, Pepsi, and Comcast, to name a few.\n\nPipefy overview\n\nPipefy puts workflow management into the hands of the people doing the work — so they don’t have to rely on the IT department or the office tech genius. Because of its focus on streamlining corporate life, companies in more than 215 countries trust the platform to automate approvals, notifications, and other common processes.\n\nPipefy makes it easy for project managers and stakeholders to seamlessly ideate projects, break them down into tasks, and designate team members to fulfill each step. Then, it automatically notifies users of their roles and deadlines.\n\nEven better, the platform serves as a central location to collect assets, deliverables, feedback, and other information, so users never lose anything in emails, chats, or scattered documents.\n\nKissflow vs Pipefy: Key features\n\nAs users become more experienced with the Kissflow platform (and better understand their team’s needs), they can refine processes without interrupting their existing flow. Kissflow keeps a digital paper trail of every action in a workflow and even allows users to download and print this information for deep-dive analysis. This helps users identify bottlenecks and further refine workflows.\n\nWith Kissflow, it’s simple to create hands-off processes for straightforward and repeatable tasks that run automatically in the background.\n\nAs its name suggests, Pipefy helps users break workflows into phases (referred to as “pipes” on the platform) and link tasks and other items to create workflow maps. Pipefy’s form builder can create and share forms with clients to collect feedback and other information.\n\nWith or without a Pipefy account, clients’ responses upload directly to the dashboard, preventing instructions or requests from getting lost in the shuffle.\n\nIn the Kissflow vs Pipefy debate, Kissflow is more adaptable, especially for organizations that want to customize their workflows. Pipefy is more suited for companies with traditional business processes that could use some streamlining or automation.\n\nHow much do they cost?\n\nKissflow’s Basic plan, offering limited features, starts at $1,500 per month, designed for simple use cases and internal users. Contact with their sales team for the custom pricing of Enterprise plan.\n\nPipefy offers free basic services to startups, freelancers, and even students. Pricing for advanced functions depends on capabilities and is charged on a per-user basis. Contact with their sales team for the pricing of Business, Enterprise and Unlimited plans.\n\nWhat do they integrate with?\n\nKissflow was originally designed for compatibility with Google Apps. It now has integrations, through Zapier, with Caspio, Amazon EC2, Xero, Microsoft Azure, Slack, Dropbox, Trello, and JIRA as well as payment platforms such as PayPal, Stripe, and QuickBooks.\n\nPipefy focuses more on integrations with other collaboration and productivity-boosting applications. It natively connects with Slack, GitHub, and Bitbucket, and integrates with Zoom and Zoho Projects through Zapier.\n\nWhich has more device compatibility?\n\nIn the Kissflow vs Pipefy debate, Pipefy is slightly more accessible than its competitor. Kissflow is a web-based application compatible with Windows, Mac, and mobile operating systems like iOS and Android. Pipefy boasts these same compatibilities with the added benefit of working with Linux.\n\nWhich is better for approval workflows?\n\nBoth Kissflow and Pipefy help organizations streamline their approval workflows. However, Pipefy is built for organizations that want to tackle common processes in finance, marketing, and human resources, including the unique needs of approval workflows in those departments.\n\nJotform: An alternative to Kissflow and Pipefy\n\nShould you choose Kissflow or Pipefy? The best answer might be to choose neither. Broken down into its most basic components, a workflow is a series of forms. And that’s exactly what Jotform specializes in. The free platform makes it possible to build complex workflows with forms you’re already using, automating the processes that might otherwise slow your organization down.\n\nJotform shares many of the same features as Kissflow and Pipefy. For example, like Pipefy, Jotform uses forms to collect customer feedback and automatically records it in a centralized database. With even more integrations than Kissflow or Pipefy, Jotform makes it easy to set up approval workflows and manage even complex multi-level approvals."
