        "text": "It seems like the business world is abuzz with the mantra of perfecting one's morning routine. 'Gurus' are peddling a precise sequence of tasks promising unprecedented leaps in productivity if executed correctly. While the efficacy of these personal routines can be debated, the principle of sequencing tasks for efficiency is undeniably a cornerstone of workflow automation.\n\nMuch like an individual seeking personal growth, your organization needs well-orchestrated workflows to boost productivity and drive efficiency. Adding automation into this mix takes your organization from a basic level of functionality to a state of hyper-efficiency - akin to trading your morning cup of coffee for a supercharged kale smoothie with a vitamin booster.\n\nIf you've never thought about workflow automation, now is the time. As a CIO or a business transformation professional, it's a tool that can help streamline processes, eliminate inefficiencies, and elevate overall performance. Here's a straightforward guide to get you started on this transformative journey.\n\nWhat is workflow automation?\n\nWorkflow automation takes a sequence of tasks and identifies elements that can be assigned to a system rather than a human. Its goal is to reduce manual effort and replace it with rule-based logic. Workflow automation takes care of collecting data, routing requests, data transfers, and sending notifications to reduce errors and increase efficiency.\n\nWhat are some examples of workflow automation?\n\nWorkflow automation finds extensive use across industries. Here are some examples.\n\nLead generation and management\n\nProspective customers go through various stages, from awareness to action. In order to convert them, marketing and sales teams need to stay in step with qualified leads as they progress through the AIDA (awareness, interest, desire, action) funnel.\n\nThe lead generation workflow often involves pulling data from several data sources and acting on it with emails and phone calls, as well as offering specialized content. Many steps, such as data collection and email sequencing, can be automated and made more efficient.\n\nUsing workflow automation can enable teams to keep track of every detail without suffering dropped leads. It also helps them coordinate seamlessly and improve the effectiveness of their lead nurturing initiatives.\n\nEmployee onboarding\n\nOnboarding new employees is a significant responsibility for human resources teams everywhere. It is critical not only to provide all the information and assistance a new employee requires but also to ensure that the experience remains consistent.\n\nThe process of employee onboarding requires attention to detail in aspects such as extending offer letters, getting requisite forms completed, taking employees through organizational culture and practices, helping them settle into the workplace, and so on.\n\nIn workflow automation, rather than the HR staff being responsible for hand-holding the new employee from one department to the next, the system can guide the new hire along the path and make sure they don’t have to fill out the same information on multiple forms constantly.\n\nInvoice processing\n\nInvoice processing is an exercise that is largely left to the accounts department and their manual efforts. However, this is also a process that can benefit from workflow automation.\n\nFrom receipt of invoices to matching, routing, approvals, payments, reconciliation, and reporting, the process becomes more accurate and transparent with the use of workflow automation.\n\nWhat features should a good workflow management software have?\n\nHere’s what you should look for in a goodworkflow management system.\n\nIntuitive workflow designer\n\nThe best workflow designer is simple and easy to use across departments. If designing the workflow requires coding know-how, it will benefit only programmers. A good workflow management system will let you think in simple, linear terms while taking care of the complicated parts in the background.\n\nFurther, if a process requires parallel branches to handle tasks happening simultaneously, the software should be able to handle the added complexity.\n\nForm designers\n\nIntuitive form designers are a must-have feature in any workflow automation software. Drag-and-drop capabilities, ample fields, text, numbers, maps, calculations, and drop-down lists are all critical in form designers.\n\nIrrespective of your unique requirements in a form, the form builder should be capable of handling it without expert guidance. In other words, it should be very accessible to a layperson.\n\nIntegration friendly\n\nYour workflow management software must be able to integrate with other applications that are currently used in your organization.\n\nIf easy integration is not a capability, it causes unnecessary complexities and ends up increasing process time rather than optimizing it.\n\nCloud-based technology\n\nFor workflow automation to truly shine, it is imperative that the software exists on the cloud. From centralized data to minimal downtime and on-the-go access, cloud-based technology brings benefits that are important for organizations that wish to move with the times.\n\nRole-based access control\n\nAn often-asked question is, “What about data security?” Workflow management systems, like Kissflow, provide the ability to define role-based access, which ensures that confidential data doesn’t fall into the wrong hands. Information is accessed on a need-to-know basis only.\n\nBird’s eye view\n\nAn organization that utilizes workflow automation tools will often have multiple processes running at once. The right software will provide a comprehensive dashboard that can inform you of the status of various processes in a glance.\n\nAnalytics and reporting\n\nMerely executing workflows can only take you so far. You need real-time information about bottlenecks and errors so you can fix them on the go. You also require reports that will tell you if you need to add or remove tasks to improve the efficiency of the process.\n\nGiven how advanced customer expectations are today, it makes great business sense to invest in good workflow automation tools.\n\nThe CaratLane Success Story\n\nCaratLane, India's largest online jewelry retailer, faced challenges with rapid growth and expanding operations. Ajith Singh, Head of Product Management, needed a solution to streamline operations without overburdening the IT team.\n\nThe company struggled with a lack of developer support, inefficient post-order processes, and accountability issues. Singh turned to Kissflow, a workflow automation platform, to address these issues. Using its no-code/low-code capabilities, Singh quickly developed applications for warehousing, quality checks, accounting, and customer service.\n\nKissflow led to increased customer satisfaction, reduced IT dependency, enhanced accountability, and enabled the speedy creation of custom apps. Since 2017, CaratLane has used Kissflow to effectively manage its growth and operations.\n\nWith all these benefits in mind, if you’re looking to automate your e-commerce workflows, Try Kissflow.\n\nKissflow workflow is a great choice for automating workflows. Its easy-to-use platform helps businesses make their processes more efficient. No matter your business size, Kissflow can help cut down on manual tasks, reduce mistakes, and save time.
