        "text": "Tamil Nadu Finance Minister Palanivel Thiyaga Rajan has allotted about INR 50 Cr to the Emerging Sector Seed Fund to make equity investments in the state-based startups and also leverage capital from institutional investors.\n\nThe state government would set up an i-Tamil Nadu Technology hub at the cost of ₹54.61 Cr in Chennai and the central government would coordinate efforts to use technology to solve complex challenges in the state, Rajan said in the State Legislative Assembly.\n\nThe minister also announced that Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) would establish an iconic State Startup Hub in Chennai at the cost of INR 75 Cr, as per a report by TNIE.\n\n“It is a challenge for startups to source funds, especially to design and build prototypes. Besides getting seed funds to build prototypes, it is crucial for startups to be nurtured in the right ecosystem. I laud the decision of the state government to allocate INR 50 Cr to the Emerging Sector Seed Fund,” said Gobinath P, cofounder and chief operations officer of Modulus Housing, a Chennai-based construction tech startup.\n\nThe state finance minister also made announcements to support SC and ST entrepreneurs. He said, “In order to encourage entrepreneurs from SC and ST communities, 5% of all divisible procurement by government and governmental agencies shall be reserved for products manufactured by Tamil Nadu-based SC and ST entrepreneurs.”\n\nThe state government would also establish regional hubs to create a conducive startup ecosystem in Tamil Nadu. Welcoming the decision, IIT Madras professor and entrepreneur Thillai Rajan, said, “Majority of the startup-related activities are concentrated in Chennai, and regional hubs will provide necessary support, guidance and motivation to entrepreneurs in these regions. Along with financial assistance, leadership and direction are essential for growth of the startup sector.”\n\nDistrict National Informatics Centre’s technical director, Arumuga Nainar said, the decision to have a regional startup hub in Tirunelveli would help the existing initiatives taken in the district to encourage entrepreneurship and would encourage students to venture into entrepreneurship.\n\nEarlier in February this year, Tamil Nadu Startup and Innovation Mission (TANSIM) launched the third edition of TANSEED to support early-stage startups based in the state with seed money.\n\nUnder the TANSEED (Tamil Nadu Startup Seed Grant Fund) scheme, eligible startups will be identified by an eminent jury and be given a grant funding support of INR 10 Lakh. The grant will primarily help the operational needs of startups during their early stages and help ease their financial pressures. Mentorship by experts and incubation support is also offered.\n\nProminent Startups In Tamil Nadu\n\nChennai is known as the SaaS capital of the Indian startup ecosystem because of the successful entrepreneurs such as Zoho’s Sridhar Vembu, Freshworks’ Girish Mathrubootham, Kissflow’s Suresh Sambandam, Uniphore’s Vinod Muthukrishnan, and Chargebee’s Krish Subramanian among others.
