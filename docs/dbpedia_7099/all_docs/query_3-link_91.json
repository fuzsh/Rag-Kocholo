        "text": "One area where Kissflow can be improved is customization, specifically, the ability to modify the input fields, UI, and design elements. Currently, it's not possible to alter the colors or make the UI more beautiful beyond what Kissflow provides. In terms of the look and feel of the interface, it needs to be modified to give users and developers the avenue to alter one or two things in the design. For example, while you can add validations to input fields with drag and drop, you can't design an interface that would look so beautiful, like what you can do with JavaScript or React. Kissflow uses its own custom design, which they have put for you. If Kissflow could give us that flexibility, and the ability to add more to the look and feel, that would make it even more perfect. That is an area that they should work on. The ability to have the servers generated automatically based on the forms and their respective names would greatly simplify the process for us. This feature sets Kissflow apart from other programming languages. As someone who works with Java, I can't make a direct comparison since they serve different purposes.\n\nThere is one thing that I have been requesting for two years. However, I received an email last week stating that it will be released either this week or next week. It's the Gantt timeline feature for processes, and they informed me that it's finally coming. In future releases, it would be interesting to have a repository or portal within KiSSFLOW where users can interact with the KiSSFLOW community. Currently, the integration with Google Drive is useful, but if you upload a document to Google Drive and make modifications there, it doesn't automatically update in KiSSFLOW. By incorporating a portal within KiSSFLOW, documents could be linked, and any changes made to the document would be reflected in the flowchart of KiSSFLOW as well. So any edits made in one portal should be reflected in another portal as well. Particularly in the processes, I have found a workaround by linking the document within the link. Therefore, if you make modifications in Google Drive by adding the document or updating the link, you can add the modified documents. However, it would be interesting to have a live document linked directly within KiSSFLOW, rather than just linking to the document itself."
