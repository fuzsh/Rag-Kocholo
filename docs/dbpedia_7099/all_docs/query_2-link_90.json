All of this must be tied to measured performance focused on the end to end for customers.\n\nBeing able to do all the process work as part of digitization of end to end processes driven by customers. The process is still the process and has to be designed for all aspects to work together.\n\nBusiness analysts must learn to see their work as designing a flow of work.\n\nStakeholder analysis and design for EXTERNAL stakeholders putting aside the wants of internal stakeholders. It‚Äôs all about the result that the organization is mandated to deliver externally.\n\nConnecting process performance to stakeholder value needs not departments.\n\nDealing with customer experience if there is general parity in the industry on the basic products and services. Example is mobile telecoms where everyone offers the same thing but the experience varies widely.\n\nDeveloping cultural change skills must become part of process work.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nLow level analysis of portions of an end to end.\n\nEverything else should still be needed but on a wider end to end scale.\n\nIt is still going to take a while to get all aspects working in an organization so diligence and patience is needed.\n\nJump to the top\n\nScott Draeger\n\nScott Draeger is the Vice President of Product at GMC Software Technology.

If you made an organization that is too rigid, you might find yourself in trouble. You can expect that new regulations will allow less time for you to implement the changes they require. This means that your team, tools and processes need to expect change in 2017. With this much chaos on the horizon, it would be wise to get a group together to brainstorm likely chance scenarios for more regulation, less regulation, and a events that could impact your processes. Some early brainstorming might prepare you for a variety of unanticipated situations that could catch your competitors off guard.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nProcess mining, because this is a year of change that will be major. It‚Äôs not a year of small tweaks that can be identified and optimized. There will be major changes for finance, insurance, utilities, government and other industries that will require rapid implementation. Process mining might regain prominence in the future, but focus on designing replacement processes quickly.\n\nJump to the top\n\nAlan Fish\n\nDr Alan N Fish is Principal Consultant in Decision Solutions with FICO, having over 30 years‚Äô experience in the support, automation and optimisation of organisational decisions.

He is the author of ‚ÄúKnowledge Automation: How To Implement Decision Management in Business Processes‚Äù (Wiley), and co-author of the OMG specification Decision Model and Notation (DMN).\n\nWWW: http://www.fico.com\n\nWWW: LI profile\n\nTwitter: @AlanNFish\n\nWhat are the skills and techniques that can help BPM practitioners create value for their organizations in 2017?\n\nEffective BPM requires practitioners to be aware of the principles of decision management, and to be able to model decisions formally in DMN. This allows organisational decision-making to be identified, tied to specific ‚Äúdecision points‚Äù in the process, and optimised. Whether decision-making is to be automated using decision services, constrained using decision support systems, or left as a free human activity, it is vital to understand the scope and structure of the decisions made, how they relate to data collected / generated by the process, and how the business knowledge applied in making the decisions is to be managed over time. Such business knowledge is a valuable corporate asset which cannot be managed unless it is first identified and modelled.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nBPMN / CMMN / DMN is becoming the de facto set of standard modelling notations. Learn these thoroughly and forget the others, and do not rely too heavily on the proprietary notations of any particular tool: knowledge of the standards is transferrable.\n\nJump to the top\n\nIan Gotts\n\nIan is a founder of Q9 Elements, tech advisor, investor, speaker and author.\n\nQ9 Elements is a startup software company.

He has a diverse background in business process application design and implementation, working with several of the commercial business process suites in addition to most of today‚Äôs popular open source business process suites. He sees open source solutions as flexible, powerful, and preferable alternatives to commercial enterprise software packages, allowing for more complete and robust coverage of companies‚Äô individual business requirements.\n\nWWW: http://www.camunda.com\n\nWWW: LI profile\n\nTwitter: @rjcamunda\n\nWhat are the skills and techniques that can help BPM practitioners create value for their organizations in 2017?\n\nThe mindset of the typical BPM practitioner should be different here in 2017. In many cases, our goal just a few years ago was to implement BPM and to identify business problems we could solve along the way. Now, instead of working in reverse, we look first to solve real-world business problems, and BPM, related technologies and standards such as BPMN, CMMN and DMN are a set of tools in a larger toolbox full of customizable software products that allow businesses to solve those problems‚Ä¶ and to gain the required competitive advantage over their rivals. If the typical BPM practitioner can shift his/her mindset to align with that reality, that person will be much more well-positioned to recommend the right tool or combination of tools to address any individual client‚Äôs needs.\n\nI‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention the need for flexibility in today‚Äôs tools. Gone are the days where companies would buy software packages and align their processes with the capabilities of those tools, and that is why more flexible, customizable tools are gaining more and more traction. Thus, if you want to be a leading BPM practitioner these days, work to be fluent in the core concepts and strive to gain experience with tools that are malleable and can be tweaked as necessary to satisfy specific business requirements.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nTwo items come specifically to mind‚Ä¶ First, we used to talk a lot about adapters to existing, proprietary enterprise systems, and that was big business. Not anymore; with the true, post-hype emergence of REST API‚Äôs literally everywhere, adapters are ‚Äì in most cases ‚Äì simply no longer necessary. If a tool can speak over a REST interface, then it can generally integrate with almost any enterprise software package in the market today. The only exception is Robotic Process Automation (RPA); in some cases, RPA focuses on automating how users interact with human-based user interfaces, and those ‚Äúadapters‚Äù are clearly much more specialized (and not yet standardized).\n\nNext, and perhaps more importantly, the days of proprietary coding languages and formats are numbered, much more so than they were in the past. If you‚Äôre working with a tool that leverages a proprietary coding language (or any other proprietary mechanism for building business solutions), you should seriously consider whether continuing to work in that area makes sense for your long-term career path. Even the proprietary vendors are switching more and more to open standards and/or open source software components, which is a boon for developers, architects, and their employers due to newfound skills portability.\n\nJump to the top\n\nEmiel Kelly\n\nEmiel has been working as a trainer and consultant for vendors of software like BPM tooling, since 1999. He also started his own initiative, Procesje.nl, a valuable source of practical and common sense information about Business Process Management and how to avoid blindly following the trends.\n\nEmiel is known from his practical and unorthodox approach to BPM.\n\nHe is also a contributor to bpm.com where he is a very active participant of discussion forums. You can also find lots of his both informative and entertaining tweets on Twitter.\n\nWWW: http://procesje.blogspot.nl\n\nWWW: LI profile\n\nTwitter: @Procesje\n\nWhat are the skills and techniques that can help BPM practitioners create value for their organizations in 2017?\n\nWhy do companies have processes? No, not to model them. No, not to analyze them. No, not to automate them. These are just means. What‚Äôs the goal?\n\nThe goal of processes is to solve your customer‚Äôs problem(s).\n\nSo, I think the skill with most value has always been, and still will be, the skill of ‚Äúlistening‚Äù. And I don‚Äôt care if that is done with ears, Artificial Intelligence or IOT sensors.\n\nListening with the goal to find out what‚Äôs going on. To find out what problems should be solved. But don‚Äôt forget that a speedometer is quite useless if you don‚Äôt understand what the numbers tell you and don‚Äôt know how to act upon that information.\n\nSo I would add ‚ÄúLearning‚Äù and ‚ÄúActing‚Äù to the skills. Listen, Learn, Act. Sounds cool, doesn‚Äôt it?\n\nBut is it special? Absolutely not. It is what every company (and person) should do to stay relevant and be valuable. It‚Äôs an attitude and it should happen every day. It‚Äôs daily business. BPM is daily business.\n\nAnd Listen, Learn, Act happens on different levels of BPM.\n\nFirst of all on a more strategic level. Because our beloved processes are just a means to solve a problem. A problem of a person, a group or society. So, good BPM starts with being able to understand these problems. Being aware what is going on and provide the services or products to solve those problems.\n\nAnd yes, processes need to be executed for that. The right processes. And that needs a good understanding of what are the customer‚Äôs needs and being able to adapt your collection of processes to that needs.\n\nAs said, it‚Äôs also about learn and act. So to me that means skills that enable fast process development. Although they still exist, but most processes won‚Äôt last for 20 years. A good understanding of tools and technologies that help you to continuously support the right processes seem valuable to me.\n\nThis is a trend you see. A trend I would call ‚ÄúAnti Enterprise Software‚Äù. No more expensive big systems that have to run for 20 years to pay a return on investment. But easy to change applications to support your processes.\n\nMaybe it‚Äôs a little weird to talk about ‚Äúthrow away processes‚Äù but I believe every executed case should be a trigger for process improvement. And wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if your supporting software is built with that mindset?\n\nThat automatically brings me to a more operational level. On that level it is about understanding what is going on in your processes. What is the need of individual cases, what is the status, etc? And being able to adjust your ‚Äúplan‚Äù if needed. Not by lengthy procedures and hierarchical approvement chains. But by the people who execute the processes. Process change power should be as close to the shop floor as possible. That needs a different culture.\n\nAll these points are partly wishes, partly observations, but if I had to summarize them, I would say it is about being able to turn data into valuable action on the different levels of BPM.\n\nTechnology can help with that. Isn‚Äôt E-listening what AI actually is meant for? Turning data into useful information so someone or something can act upon it. With acting being the most important. It is cool that a google car can identify there is a traffic jam ahead. But without being able to brake, that information is useless.\n\nSo, if you have to turn Listen, Learn, Act into more business terms, it would be things like data science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and skills (and technologies of course) that enable you to easily change the systems that support your processes.\n\nWhat skills are less needed?\n\nIs it worth to talk about the skills less needed? For sure needed skills will change.\n\nTo me BPM never has been something that you do on top of, or next to, your daily business. BPM is daily business. And how you do it will change. Because of different needs or new technology.\n\nWill 6 months of AS-IS mapping still be a thing? Will Lean still be a thing? Will process mining still be a thing? Will BPMN still be a thing? I don‚Äôt know. And that‚Äôs why we as ‚ÄúBPM peeps‚Äù also have to Listen, Learn and Act. To stay relevant for organizations that take ‚ÄúManaging by process‚Äù seriously.\n\nJump to the top\n\nSandy Kemsley\n\nSandy is a ‚Äútechnology catalyst‚Äù with a 20-year history of software design and systems architecture in several technology areas, combined with a deep understanding of business environments and how technology can impact them.\n\nShe has also founded and run three companies ‚Äì a systems integration services company, a software product company, and current consulting company ‚Äì with responsibility for corporate and financial governance, strategic direction, team hiring and management, and day-to-day technical contributions.\n\nSandy blogs about BPM, enterprise architecture and other intersections of business and technology at www.column2.com\n\nWWW: https://column2.com\n\nWWW: LI profile\n\nTwitter: @skemsley\n\nWhat are the skills and techniques that can help BPM practitioners create value for their organizations in 2017?\n\nI see a continuing split in BPM practitioners inside large organizations: a process improvement group that is focused on Lean Six Sigma or other techniques for modeling and improving processes, but no awareness of automation technologies; and an IT group that uses BPM as an agile application development and orchestration tool. Both groups need to improve their skills to really make a BPM program work for their organization:\n\n‚Äì The process improvement team needs more knowledge of how BPMN modeling tools are more than just ‚Äúflowcharts on steroids‚Äù, but can allow them to provide significantly more valuable input to the IT groups in the form of executable (or nearly so) process models that match the desired business processes. By developing skills in BPMN and related modeling tools, they add another process improvement technique to their toolbox, and can provide a helpful bridge for teaching business people more about BPMN.\n\n‚Äì The IT team needs improved skills on using agile techniques and technologies (including BPMS) in order to deliver on the promise of fast deployment and flexible systems. Too many organizations are still being sold on long, monolithic software development projects that effectively pour concrete over the current state rather than providing a platform for flexible response to business change.\n\nIn addition to these two obviously BPM practitioner groups, the ‚Äúcitizen developers‚Äù ‚Äî typically semi-technical business analysts embedded within business groups directly ‚Äî need to gain skills on using low-code BPMS to create situational applications directly and without IT involvement. They are already doing this, except they‚Äôre using inappropriate tools such as spreadsheets: it‚Äôs time to empower them by giving them enterprise-strength tools to create useful departmental apps.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nMany organizations are spending significant time and energy on Lean Six Sigma programs, but not seeing a lot of benefit from them since they tend to focus on incremental improvement rather than innovation. In manufacturing and other industries where physical assets dictate a more incremental approach, these techniques will continue to dominate, but they will become less important in knowledge-based service organizations, including financial services and insurance.\n\nJump to the top\n\nDr. Mathias Kirchmer\n\nAs innovative out-come-driven top executive and entrepreneur, Dr. Kirchmer has successfully led organizations and teams to achieve growth and performance goals in an international environment combining business and technology initiatives.

BPM becomes the management discipline for strategy execution and ongoing digitalization. It must help to focus on what really matters, improve in the context of specific organizational challenges and sustain those improvements. Rapid improvements to react to fast market changes, standardization and customer journey planning for consistently best customer experience, value-driven as well as process-led digitalization and system-implementation become typical BPM initiatives.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nNarrow technical skills will be less important. From an information technology perspective more and more of the configuration and adaption of process relevant tools and application is done on a business level, hence less and less of the traditional programming is required. But also the more conventional improvement skills, like many of the Six Sigma tools, will be less important in an information rich digital world. Their application is often too slow and not sufficiently integrated into the new opportunities digitalization provides.\n\nJump to the top\n\nHarald K√ºhn\n\nDr. Harald K√ºhn is a member of the management board of the BOC AG.

You can watch the full interview HERE.\n\nGood practices:\n\nIf we want to start implementing BPM as a management practice within an organization, we need to start moving away from the scope of a single project and have an enterprise level focus to manage holistically multiple BPM projects.\n\nWe also need to prioritize the management of the various business processes from a business process architecture using their strategic importance.\n\nThe enabler for all of the above is the establishment of a sound BPM governance structure, which defines BPM decision processes, roles and responsibilities, standards and guidelines in the use of BPM methods and software tools.\n\nBad practices:\n\nOne of the most common errors is focusing on methods and tools rather than on the value these methods and tools should deliver for the company. For example, training 30 Green Belts when the company‚Äôs strategic priority is elsewhere: outsmarting the competitors through innovative products. Lean Six Sigma is not going to help to achieve that, yet there is no link between the choice of the methods and tools and the strategic objectives we must achieve.\n\nAnother common error is to have a siloed BPM initiative, where multiple projects are conducted in isolation from each other. Overlooking the relations (hierarchical, temporal and generalization-specialization) between business processes may lead to a situation where improving one process creates inconsistency with other processes, besides missing out on opportunities for identifying shared solutions.\n\nJump to the top\n\nBob Larrivee\n\nBob Larrivee, Vice President and Chief Analyst of Market Intelligence ‚Äì AIIM.\n\nBob is an internationally recognized subject matter expert and thought leader with over thirty years of experience in the fields of information and process management, and recipient of the Cenadem Brazil ‚Äì ECM pioneer Award.

If the problem statement is that processing times are too slow or review cycles too long, that is an issue but not the underlying problem. Once the problem is identified, then work to resolve it. This is where process mapping is of great benefit. Document and validate the process, identify the players, and related content, then look for ways to improve that process. If possible, look to automate wherever possible, but do not put technology first, it is a tool.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nIt is my belief that every skill has a time and place to be used. While some things may be considered obsolete or outdated, it is amazing how they suddenly become relevant again, when nothing else works. It is also my belief that skills learned and acquired, while they may not applicable to a current situation, is knowledge gained that provides enhanced insight into that which could be, when the time is right. For example, I once trained to become a Certified Insurance Services Representative and gained my certification in that field, yet I never worked in the insurance industry. Years later, working for a software solution s provider, I was able to apply that knowledge when addressing the insurance sector to enhance their content management environments and improve their operational processes.\n\nJump to the top\n\nConnie Moore\n\nAs Senior Vice President of Research at Digital Clarity Group, Connie has unparalleled experience working with senior executives in business and IT, technology marketing, and government, from SMEs to large enterprises throughout the globe.

Use Lean for initiatives that involve analyzing the big picture and use Six Sigma or Lean Six Sigma to analyze and drill down into a specific part of a business process.\n\n‚Äì Organizational change management. This perennial topic comes up with virtually every project because it is a big possible point of failure. Skills in change management could include the ADKAR methodology from Prosci or it could be more specialized, even ‚Äúhome grown‚Äù methodologies. Conferences that focus on operational excellence are good events for learning more about how business process executives have successfully tackled organizational change. No matter what methodology or technique the practitioner uses, it‚Äôs vitally important that the practitioner and executives focus on communication, communication, communication.\n\nNew skills that business practitioners should add:\n\n‚Äì Entity modeling is a different way to model processes that is being supported by a number of BPM vendors. It is a significantly superior way to build processes, particularly for dynamic processes and for situations where many processes are being automated in parallel. Business analysts and development teams should develop or deepen their skills in this modeling approach. (see references below)\n\n‚Äì Customer journey mapping is important for business process practitioners to understand. Often related initiatives are being pursued, unbeknownst to the different teams, that are related to the same business process. BPM teams may be looking at how a cross-functional process works within or inside the organization, while marketing and customer experience teams may be looking at the same cross-functional process from the outside in perspective. The BPM team is most likely using a process modeling tool while the customer journey team is most likely using a journey mapping tool. These two teams may discover each other at some point in their unintegrated projects, and decide to join forces or at least collaborative. At that point, it is helpful to know and understand the journey mapping tooling the customer experience team uses.\n\n‚Äì Net promoter scores are important KPI metrics for executive dashboards, and business process practitioners need to understand how they work and how to integrate them into the BPM reporting and monitoring system.\n\n‚Äì Analytics are everywhere, and this explosive growth will only continue over time. BPM practitioners need a working understanding of analytics, whether it is analytics for monitoring process results, predictive analytics that initiate steps in a process or something else. Having a working knowledge of analytics will be very helpful.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.digitalclaritygroup.com/use-change-management-build-operational-excellence-culture/\n\nhttp://www.digitalclaritygroup.com/role-organizational-change-management/\n\nhttp://www.digitalclaritygroup.com/podcast-entity-modeling-business-process-management/\n\nhttp://www.digitalclaritygroup.com/entity-modeling-simplified-business-process-automation/\n\nhttp://www.digitalclaritygroup.com/transform-customer-experience-and-operational-excellence-by-going-digital-outside-and-inside/\n\nJump to the top\n\nNathaniel Palmer\n\nRated as the #1 Most Influential Thought Leader in Business Process Management (BPM) by independent research, Nathaniel Palmer is recognized as one of the early originators of BPM, and has led the design for some of the industry‚Äôs largest-scale and most complex projects involving investments of $200 Million or more.

Overall, process modeling remains a critical skill set, and one of the greatest challenge for new hires (hiring managers) among BPM practitioner teams the general lack of ability to properly represent and differentiates process, data and rules.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nIn 2017, Lean Six Sigma will remain no longer relevant, likely the least relevant, and closely large architecture frameworks (TOGAF, et al.) in contrast with localized business architecture practices and leverage of standard notations such as Archimate.\n\nJump to the top\n\nJuergen Pitschke\n\nJuergen Pitschke is Partner and Managing Director at Process Renewal Group Deutschland.\n\nJuergen has more than 25 years industrial experience about enterprise modelling and the realization of Business and IT Architectures.

But to understand more application areas. Decision Management is important not only for compliance. Other important use cases in the context of BPM are improving communication and using Decision Management for predictions.\n\nWe need to improve our soft skills to apply traditional and new concepts. How can we apply new techniques?\n\nAnother field to look for are BPM-Systems for implementing. We see a discussion about ‚Äúzero-code‚Äù-systems. But complex individual applications need sometimes more complex features. I believe that we will see more frameworks for different areas which combine process engines with complex application frameworks.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\n‚Ä¶ no longer relevant ‚Ä¶\n\nWe are fast to declare something irrelevant. I believe you can learn a lot from traditional techniques and methods, also from other fields and industries. Try to understand what was the goal, what was good, what was not workinng. Combine with new techniques and methods. It is always good to have many techniques in your toolbox.\n\n‚Ä¶not yet ‚Ä¶\n\nI give the same answer: Understand what is not yet working and what is the goal. CMMN is such a hype topic. We see CMMN in systems and used by experts. But how to explain it to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù users?

So technical BPM practitioners need to become ever more skilled in fewer vendor platforms. Perhaps just one. I expect AI based services to be soon woven into BPM data structuring and decision making introducing the new role of Process Knowledge Engineer.\n\nBusiness Architecture has emerged more recently as an important (and long overdue) BPM role. Avoiding the definition of impossible or uneconomic solutions, with the diversity of quite technical BPM tools and approaches, demands that BPM analysts, of all levels, must also possess a solid appreciation of implementation technologies. Unfortunately, BPM technology still influences the business solution design.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nEffective process management, automated or otherwise, is totally dependent upon data. Especially structured: process, reference and business data. This fundamental reality is often been overlooked (typically by sales and market marketing). It emerges to be the major cause of BPM delivery failure and business value destruction.\n\nThe rapid corporate adoption of simple, secure and performant REST services has more recently eliminated the need for an expensive, parallel data integration / ESB programme to underpin BPM value creation. The need for highly paid Integration Engineers is diminished.\n\nREST services also opens the door to an abundance of cost-effective externally hosted services to add even more BPM business value.\n\nJump to the top\n\nAdrian Reed\n\nAdrian Reed is a true advocate of the analysis profession.

The words that jumps out at me is the phrase ‚Äòcreate value‚Äô. I think that as practitioners we often assume that there is an instinctive understanding of what value is. Yet, so often in organisations there are different perceptions and perspectives on this thorny topic. In fact I suspect we‚Äôve all worked in organisations where some of our stakeholders haven‚Äôt really considered the value they are seeking!\n\nWith this in mind, I think a really useful skill is the ability to understand people‚Äôs perspectives and to help define the value that organisations are seeking. Is ‚Äòquicker‚Äô better‚Äìif so why? Is ‚Äòcheaper‚Äô better, if so why? This involves understanding organisational strategy, linking that strategy to BPM as well as change projects, process improvement initiatives and so forth. It also involves ensuring we have a firm understanding of our organisations external environment, value proposition, and the value expectations of its customers. After all, if a product is positioned at the luxury end of the market, then its customer support processes are probably very different to one at the economy end of the market‚Äìand it‚Äôs crucial that we know that!\n\nUnderstanding value has another advantage. In linking BPM to value, we make it easier to ‚Äòsell‚Äô to our stakeholders. We position BPM & analysis against that business value.\n\nI think we‚Äôre also seeing a shift towards a (very sensible) view that it isn‚Äôt really possible to ‚Äòcreate value‚Äô‚Äìor certainly not in isolation. What we can create are the conditions where value can emerge. I.e. we work with stakeholders to co-create value. This might sound very abstract, but it‚Äôs actually really important. It shows the need for a rich and deep connection with our stakeholders‚Äìfrom top to bottom of the organisation‚Äìand reinforces the need for us to spend time knowing them, networking with them and understanding their worlds.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nI‚Äôm not sure that any skills are completely irrelevant, but I think that we are seeing that the borders between disciplines are becoming more and more blurry. Perhaps, going back a few years, there were certain tasks/techniques that were seen as within BPM and others that were seen as outside of this. The same with business architecture, business analysis, and other intersecting disciplines. I think we‚Äôre seeing a really positive growth of interdisciplinary communities, and that is such an exciting thing. It‚Äôs not ‚Äòeither/or‚Äô it can be ‚Äòboth‚Äô.\n\nSo, one thing that is no longer relevant (or no long as relevant as it used to be) is the expectation of fixed silos. It‚Äôs far more about experienced people doing awesome work to co-create value.\n\nJump to the top\n\nPedro Robledo\n\nOne of the most influential Spanish thought leader in Process Management using BPM, as for +15 years he has been dedicated to promote industry awareness of Business Process Management in Spain and Latin America.

So they need to focus add skills in technical disruption forces (SMACT ‚Äì Social Mobile Analytics Cloud Things) in order to manage BPM projects where it should be possible to use Process Management Social Networks, Streaming Analytics and Big Data, Mobile Process Management, Event Processing and Internet of Things.\n\nBut, due to the cultural change of the Digital Transformation and BPM implementation, it is important to improve the skills focus on how to make an effective communication, empathy and relationship with all stakeholders to get the cultural change without rejections.\n\nAnother important consideration is to be focused on methodologies of continous improvement (Lean, SixSigma and TOC), as companies are more aware of applying these methodologies for business and process improvement.\n\nAnd the last skill but not the least, Adaptive Case Management skills, as more and more companies wants to implement structured processes and not-structured processes.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nAll the skills are relevant as BPM maturity is low in the market yet, and the professionals need business knowledge and technology expertise of the all BPM lifecycle to advance in the maturity and to be able to develop the process transformation with the new value chain in the digital transformation of a company.

Well, yes it is. Drawing the process is critical. But it turns out that is the easy part. With modern process modeling tools, I am finding that only about 5% of the time is spent drawing the process model. Indeed, that 5% is saving a ton of work that you would have had to do without the process model, so it saves many times more than you spend on it. But what I am finding is that most of the time ‚Äì the bulk, maybe 40% to 50% ‚Äî is purely on UI implementation. Users don‚Äôt want static forms, and they don‚Äôt just type values. They want ability to search and look things up, to validate values, to prompt with previous values, and all of this interaction has nothing to do with the business process, and everything to do with creating a good user interface. The BPM practitioner must know how to make a good UI.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nThere was a fad long ago (around 2008) for pushing a process language called BPEL.

It‚Äôs time to start managing processes holistically within your organization, and that means integration with strategy, process improvement, IT, and more. You need to push your leaders and colleagues to all begin using a common terminology to represent all aspects of process management that need attention and control. Stop thinking in point solutions that address the current burning platform and one-off improvement-fests. Build a strong process management culture in 2017.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nThe hype meter on analytics, neural networks, smart machines, enterprise IOT, intelligent automation, and more is going to blow thru the roof in 2017 as consumer applications of this stuff really hit the main stream and niches within enterprises are finding success. Don‚Äôt get burned on this by trying to implement it in your enterprise right now. It‚Äôs not time yet to replace your people with process automating robots ‚Äì but know that wave of innovation is coming in the next decade. Start making sure that your culture, processes, and data are ready. Make sure your executives can understand how this massive change will affect your organization in the coming years. Create an environment where your people can continue to add value in the face of ever-increasing automation.\n\nJump to the top\n\nMiguel Vald√©s-Faura\n\nAs Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Miguel leads the charge in Bonitasoft‚Äôs mission: to democratize Business Process Management (BPM), bringing powerful and affordable BPM to organizations and projects of all sizes.

User Interfaces in which BPM practitioners focus on end users, decides on the level of process details revealed and make things such ergonomics, design and accessibility a priority.\n\nHighly personalized UIs is an essential piece of what I call ‚Äúprocess-based applications‚Äù. Those applications are a highly viable alternative to custom development. With the additional advantage that the resulting applications can be changed after deployment, on the fly, to keep up with changing business needs.\n\nWhich skills are no longer relevant or not practically applicable yet (hype)?\n\nI would say that traditional BPM simulation techniques are not relevant anymore (aka, evaluation of the way processes runs under different resource availabilities and different load profiles).\n\nTraditional BPM simulation is usually based on specified number of iterations over a specified period of time and are run either with simulated data or with assigned probabilities.\n\nBusiness are more and more used to work with bigdata and predictive analytics technologies so now its all about real-time data üôÇ\n\nJump to the top\n\nIn a hurry?
