        "text": "Are you looking for an easier and faster way to build applications and processes? Well, low-code development is the answer. This blog lets us find more about low-code, its benefits, features, and more.\n\nWhat Is Low-code?\n\nLow-code is a software development approach that enables the building of applications and processes with little or no coding - it is a visual approach to software development . In this approach, simple logic and drag-drop features are used in visual interfaces instead of extensive coding languages. The idea is simple - Help people with little or no exposure to programming languages to develop customized applications and software.\n\nLow-code is an agile alternative to traditional software development. Professionals and non-professionals can develop complex applications to meet business needs such as process automation and digital transformation acceleration.\n\nWhat Is Low-code Development?\n\nLow-code development is a visual, model-driven way to build and deploy software applications. Using this approach, business users and professionals of all skill levels can create solutions which can add value to the business, from process automation apps to core systems. An easier and faster approach enables organizations to stay agile, break down isolated working situations and improve overall productivity.\n\nKey Features Of Low-code Development Platforms\n\nHere are 9 key features that make low-code development platforms stand out.\n\nVisual Modeling Tools\n\nLow-code platforms are powered with visual modeling capabilities that enable the faster building of apps when compared to traditional methods using codes. In addition, these platforms use built-in components to represent information understandably.\n\nOut-of-the-box Functionality\n\nThis feature eliminates the need to build core modules for apps from scratch. For example, some leading low-code platforms include modules for data management or modules for customer-facing apps like service management and sales process management.\n\nDrag-drop Interfaces\n\nThis is one of the most valuable and essential features that enable an easy development process. It provides convenience and ease when creating apps for both citizen and professional developers.\n\nReusability\n\nLow-code developments out-of-the-box functionality uses pre-configured modules and functionality for apps. These modules have standard core functions needed for several apps, thus enabling the reuse of modules for developing different solutions, making developing apps quicker and easier.\n\nCross-platform Accessibility\n\nMulti-device compatibility is a great and valuable feature of low-code platforms. In addition to running on different operating systems, low-code platforms also have cross-platform compatibility, allowing users to build apps that run on various platforms and devices.\n\nSecurity\n\nA tool must be highly secure for it to be a great solution. Therefore, ensuring that the low-code platforms we use are safe is crucial to protect the apps we build using these platforms.\n\nScalability\n\nAs your business grows, you must be able to reform your apps as well, and therefore, low-code platforms must be scalable to create apps that can be advanced.\n\nReporting And Monitoring\n\nLow-code platforms enable monitoring of workflows of apps that are being developed, helping to keep track of its processes and effectiveness. Monitoring the performance of other apps is also available in low-code and is helpful for analysis purposes.\n\nApplication Lifecycle Management\n\nLow-code tools simplify and streamline several stages of the software development lifecycle like debugging, testing and deployment. In addition, users can get access to information about apps they have created and their developments and can also revert to previous versions if required.\n\nTypes Of Low-code Platforms\n\nAll low-code platforms are not the same and are not built to serve one type of user. Low-code platforms can be categorized based on their usage and user.\n\nLow-Code Platforms Classified by Use Case\n\nGeneral-purpose\n\nThese platforms can create any application virtually. As a result, this platform is used to create apps that serve various needs.\n\nProcess\n\nThese platforms mainly focus on apps that run business processes, including forms, workflows, and integration with other systems. Process-based platforms are ideal for companies that want to go paperless.\n\nRequest-handling\n\nThese platforms are similar to process-based media but are less capable as they can only handle processing requests for fixed processes.\n\nDatabase\n\nThese platforms are only used to retrieve data from databases programmed inside the system. Database low-code platforms are great if you have large amounts of data to be collected and fed into the system in lesser periods and effort.\n\nMobile Application Development Platform (MADP)\n\nThese platforms help developers code, test, and launch mobile apps for smartphones and tablets. You can write code for one platform and port the app to different mobile platforms using these platforms.\n\nLow-Code Platforms Classified by Different Users\n\nLow-Code Platforms for Business Users\n\nThese platforms are designed to fulfill most of the requirements citizen developers have with as little code as possible. Here, business users can create apps even if they do not have any technical knowledge or experience in coding and app development. However, there may be cases in which they need assistance from professional developers to create and deploy some required functionalities.\n\nLow-Code Platforms for Developers\n\nThe main aim of low-code platforms for developers is to reduce the time they spend working on an app compared to traditional hand-coding. By using visual interfaces and drag-drop models, the effort and time taken by developers to build apps are reduced to a great extent.\n\nBenefits of Low-code Platforms\n\nHere are the top 3 benefits of using low-code platforms.\n\nAchieve Exceptional Time-to-value\n\nUse existing talents to rapidly build apps that your business needs\n\nImprove developer productivity with low-code attributes like toolkits, visual interfaces, reusable components, etc.\n\nEnable faster decision-making among cross-functional teams with inbuilt collaboration tools.\n\nBuild more at scale\n\nDevelop a variety of solutions that come under different categories\n\nDeliver continuous improvements to end-users\n\nBuild maintainable solutions that are easy to scale on cloud-native architecture.\n\nShape a new way of developing\n\nBreak down silos to build a solid business-IT partnership\n\nEmpower more developers throughout the organization to build apps and provide contributions\n\nStay agile to respond quickly to changing business and customer needs\n\nDifference Between Low-code And No-code Platforms\n\nThe terms 'low-code' and 'no-code' are often mentioned together because they are similar. Both platforms use visual interfaces to enable users to create business solutions without extensive coding requirements.\n\nThe main difference between the two lies in their names themselves. As the name 'low-code' suggests, this platform requires lower coding requirements, meaning they still have some coding. 'No-code,' on the other hand, does not require coding at all.\n\nNo-code platforms are essentially made for citizen developers. On the other hand, since they have more coding requirements, low-code media can create more comprehensive and complex solutions that can also cater to professional developers' needs. Furthermore, by deploying platforms that combine low-code and no-code technologies, businesses can have better flexibility and control over their development cycle.\n\nDifference Between Low-code And Business Process Management\n\nBusiness process management (BPM) refers to how a company creates, edits and analyzes the predictable processes that make up the core of the business. They are designed to systematically improve each business process and subsequently improve the organization's efficiency. BPM suites have made it easier to automate, model, monitor, and streamline everyday business processes.\n\nLow-code development platforms are not replacements of BPM but rather a technological approach that changes how BPM services are deployed. Below are the significant differences between low-code and BPM.\n\nLow-code platforms are easy to set up and are primarily cloud-based. BPMs can take more extended periods upto 6 months and more.\n\nLow-code platforms are much cheaper when compared to traditional BPM.\n\nRegular employees with minimal training can develop a range of BPM solutions, whereas traditional solutions will need formal training and coding.\n\nLow-code solutions can be integrated to 3rd party SaaS solutions, thus beating the range of functionality of traditional BPMs.\n\nHow To Choose A Low-code Platform?\n\nLow-code platforms come in several categories. Each platform has different capabilities, and to choose a low-code platform that caters to your business requirements, you must follow specific steps.\n\nIdentify and evaluate multiple use cases\n\nSpecify the developer for the app - professional or citizen\n\nResearch customer happiness and support\n\nDefine usage requirements and estimate pricing\n\nInvestigate and prioritize integration requirements\n\nReview hosting, devops, and governance options\n\nUnderstand compliance and security requirements\n\nMicrosoft As A Low-code Powerhouse\n\nMicrosoft has introduced all the pieces required for an enterprise to deliver low-code solutions. However, when it comes to low-code, they have an expansive view that encompasses everything from data entry by an accountant to data retrieval by a software engineer.\n\nMicrosoft realizes that the challenge with scaling low-code lies in deployment and monitoring of apps rather than coding them and is pretty determined in solving this challenge.\n\nMicrosoft has built or acquired the following low-code components to create business solutions.\n\nMicrosoft Dataverse - A data storage solution\n\nMicrosoft Logic Apps - A platform for creating and running automated workflows that integrate and transform various elements\n\nMicrosoft Power Apps - A rapid development environment to build custom apps\n\nMicrosoftPower BI - An interactive data visualization software for creating business insights\n\nMicrosoft Power Automate - A robotic process automation solution\n\nAzure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer - A data extraction solution\n\nAlong with the above powerful components, Microsoft has recently introduced PowerFX, a general-purpose programming language used to create a link between all the features. Enterprises can deploy low-code apps using their existing CI/CD processes and governance framework through this new platform. This will give Microsoft a significant advantage over their low-code competitors because it will make Microsoft’s low code solution the safe choice for CIOs.\n\nMicrosoft’s overall strategy combines CI/CD components used in professional software development with low-code and RPA products with a standard programming language (PowerFX) that facilitates good governance of data and applications.\n\nWhat Can Be Built With Low-code\n\nLow-code platforms provide visual interfaces with easy-to-use drag-drop capabilities that allow users to build apps for different business tasks.
