        "text": "Synopsis\n\nKissflow, a Chennai-based startup, announced the layoff of about 45 employees (11% of its workforce) across India, the US, and the UAE. The CEO, Suresh Sambandam, cited reasons such as procurement strategy shift and annual performance reviews. In 2022, the company had gifted BMWs to key staffers for employee appreciation.\n\nChennai-based workflow automation software provider Kissflow has let go of about 45 of its employees as part of a restructuring across the organisation, the company said Monday.\n\nThe bootstrapped startup, founded in 2012, offers cloud-based no-code and low-code work management products. It had about 400 employees before the layoff exercise.\n\nThe layoffs took place in India, the US and the UAE across April and May, the company said in a news release.\n\nKissflow was in news in 2022 for gifting 5 Series BMWs worth Rs 1 crore each to key staffers in an employee appreciation drive.\n\n“We let (go) of around 20-25 people because we moved away from land-motion procurement to expand motion; this was done to increase customer acquisition across our products,” Kissflow founder and chief executive Suresh Sambandam said in the statement. Another around 20 jobs were cut after performance reviews, he said.\n\nThe company paid severance to all the affected employees, the release added.\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\n“Every company is looking to optimise and 90% of people who were laid off (by Kissflow) are already placed in companies and the rest 10% will also be placed soon,” Sambandam added.\n\nThe development was first reported by news website MoneyControl.\n\nThe global software-as-a-service business has been struggling to match its growth highs of 2021 and 2022 when it was enabled by post-Covid digitisation. The sector has seen sales cycles slow, multiple rounds of layoff and companies cutting margins to attract and retain clients.\n\nSaaSBoomi, a collective of SaaS and product company founders, marked down the 2030 enterprise value projections of Indian SaaS startups from $1 trillion to half that in a report last year. It had said enterprise value corrections might recover only by 2030.\n\nSeparately, global management consulting and strategy advisory firm Zinnov and venture capital firm Chiratae Ventures last year marked down 2026 revenue projections of Indian Saas startups from $100 billion to $26 billion in the latest annual report on the space.\n\nWhat’s India drinking? Spirits are high on apple, orange and honey flavours\n\nIndia must protect doctors. They are scarce, and it takes years to train one.\n\nThe golden rule for how much you should invest in gold, and where\n\nWhen earnings growth falls to 14-quarter low, you can't predict but can prepare\n\nIf market runs up too much, there could be problems later: Rajat Rajgarhia\n\nWatch out for these 3 things if you’re holding Unicommerce stocks\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
