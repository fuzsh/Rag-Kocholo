        "text": "Aworkflow management system is a software tool designed to help streamline routine business processes for optimal proficiency. Workflow management systems involve creating a form to hold data and automating a sequential path of tasks for the data to follow until it is fully processed.\n\nTasks in workflows may be done by a human or by a system. With so many options and so many products calling themselves a workflow tool, it’s hard to know what you will get. What was yesterday a simple kanban project management tool is now claiming to be a fully automated workflow system?\n\nIf you ask a process owner to create a workflow, she is likely to draw a straight line with key steps in the method, each requiring input, approval, or rejection.\n\nIf you ask a programmer to make software for invoice approval workflow, it will start looking like the family tree of Oedipus.\n\nA great workflow management system lets you think in simple linear loops and does all the complex stuff in the background.\n\nIn 2020, there’s no excuse for a form designer to be anything less than splendid. It’s got to be drag-and-drop. And you need fields, all the different types. Text, numbers, maps, calculations, drop-downs, and more! If you aren’t initially impressed at the form designer of your workflow management system, chances are that you will outgrow it pretty fast.\n\nWant to select the next actor of a task from the form? Want to link your form to a different database? Want to display live data from a website? All of this should be very easy to achieve.\n\nIntegration used to be a nice-to-have feature for workflow management. Now it’s important.\n\nWorkflows don’t operate independently from other processes.Papers, sales reports, cash-flows, calendars, and contact details should all flow smoothly from your workflow tool to your CMS, calendar, email, financial software and more.\n\nIf your workflow management system isn’t incredibly easy to set up to integrate with other tools out there, it’s already outdated."
