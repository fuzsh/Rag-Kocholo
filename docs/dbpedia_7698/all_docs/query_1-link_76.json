        "text": "Dr. Suchand Basuli was born and brought up in West Bengal, India. He obtained his M.Sc. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad. Subsequently, he received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the same institute, under the guidance of Prof. G. Satyanarayana’s group in 2018. Later, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. Subsequently, he gained one year industry experience as well. Very recently (2022), he joined as a postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Hirschi Lab in the department of chemistry, at Binghamton University. His research activities are focussed on designing new synthetic strategies and study reaction mechanism. He loves playing football and cricket in his free time.\n\nTamal Das was born and grew up in Kolkata, India. After, finishing his M.Sc. degree from the University of Calcutta he joined the Dr. Kumar Vanka lab as a computational chemist in the National Chemical Laboratory and received his Ph.D. degree in Chemical Science in the year 2021. Immediately he moved to university of Oslo, Norway as a postdoctoral researcher in the Hylleraas center for computational simulation and modeling under the supervision of David Balcells and Ainara Nova. Recently at the end of 2023 he joined Dr. Hirschi Lab at Binghamton University, New York as a computational post doctoral research fellow. His overall research activities are focussed on computational modeling of homogeneous, heterogeneous and enzyme catalyzed reaction and study the reaction mechanism. Apart from his research in the spare time he loves to cook, watch and play cricket and spent time with his family.\n\nStephanie is from Long Island, New York. She attended Stony Brook University for her undergraduate studies, graduating in May 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and Bioengineering. After finding her passion for teaching organic chemistry during undergrad, she joined Binghamton University in Fall of 2020 to pursue a doctoral degree in chemistry. Her research focus is on the mechanistic study of organic and biochemical reactions for the enhancement of drug design. Outside of research, she loves dance, choreographing, baking and drawing.\n\nClinton graduated from the International Islamic University Chittagong(IIUC), Bangladesh, with a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Eventually, he was awarded a scholarship with full funding, and he started studying chemical engineering at Yeungnam University in South Korea. He worked as a research intern in a neuroscience lab in South Korea after earning his master's degree. Clinton enrolled in the doctoral program at Binghamton University in the fall of 2022. In order to become a more accomplished researcher, He hopes to gain more knowledge about organic synthesis and computational chemistry. In his spare time, Clinton enjoys listening to music and audio books.\n\nAfter graduating from The University of Texas at Austin in December of 2016, Josh went on to work for Austin Pets Alive! as a feline leukemia (FeLV) research assistant to help advocate for this population of cats and stop unnecessary euthanasia across the United States. Inspired by the real impact that research can have, he applied to and joined the chemistry department at Binghamton University in the Fall of 2020 as a Ph.D. student. With a passion for education as well, he recently received the Lois Mackey award for excellence in teaching. When he's not working in the lab, you might catch him hiking or mountain biking around nature trails or just relaxing at home watching science fiction movies in his downtime.\n\nVictor Nyagilo grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. He graduated with honors from Dendan Kimathi University of Technology in 2019 with a focus on Industrial Chemistry. In the Spring of 2020, Victor joined Binghamton University to start his doctoral degree in chemistry. His research interests include the mechanistic study of photo-redox catalyzed reactions for enantioselective drug design. When he is not in the lab Victor loves to play soccer, go on adventures, and go hiking.\n\nSomnath earned a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the University of Calcutta in India in 2020. In 2022, he obtained a Master's degree in Organic Chemistry from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (MAKAUT) in Kaylani, India. He enrolled at Binghamton University in the fall of 2023 to pursue a PhD in organic chemistry. He avidly supports Cristiano Ronaldo and enjoys playing football and socializing with friends. Suiiii\n\nSnehlata grew up in India. She completed her undergrad at the Regional Institute of Education, Bhopal,MP, India in June 2019 with Bachelor in Science and Education. Following her interest in Chemistry, she graduated with a Master’s in Science (specializing in Organic Chemistry) from Chandigarh University, Punjab,India in May 2021. To enhance and polish her skills as a synthetic chemist she worked at Syngene International Limited, Hyderabad, India as a Research Associate for more than a year. In Fall 2023 she joined Binghamton University to pursue PhD in organic chemistry. Outside the lab, she likes to binge-watch series, hang out with friends, and go mountain hiking.\n\nMolly earned her Ph.D. from UC-Barkeley where she focused her studies on the synthesis of the perfect treats. She was paws-itively excited to start her position in the Hirschi lab in 2023 where she now fetches KIEs and retrieves atomistic insight into complex molly-cules. When she’s not in the lab, she enjoys chasing squirrels and reminding Col who’s boss.\n\nArguably the most handsome of the group, Col strives to overcome all of life's highest energy barriers with relative ease and aplomb. Practically a living transition state himself, he won't settle for anything less than a solved reaction mechanism and transition state structures."
