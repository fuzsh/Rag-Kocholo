        "text": "Before the caste system became widespread, it existed as a theological and fictional concept in ancient Brahmin mythologies and Puranic legends. These religious narratives often demeaned the poor and weak, condemning them to bonded labour. Other privileged castes — such as merchants, aristocrats, and landowners — saw their interests reflected in Brahminical fiction and heartily endorsed it. The victims were denied education and a voice to produce counter-narratives.\n\nI want to explore here how caste hierarchies shape modern Indian fiction, and identify the most acclaimed Indian-English novelists and their caste backgrounds — thereby shedding light on what the Dalit scholar Akhil Kang calls “an anthropology of the [caste] elite”. Traditional caste-based “untouchability” has effectively evolved into professional and cultural segregation.\n\nPrior to the turn of the century, Indian-English novels did not refer to “the untouchables” as Dalits. They rarely mention the name of the eminent Dalit scholar, reformer and primary drafter of the Indian Constitution, Dr B.R. Ambedkar (1891–1956). Trinidadian-Indian-origin author V.S. Naipaul was the first major English writer to acknowledge Dalit self-assertion. India: A Million Mutinies Now, written in the late 1980s, opens with vibrant scenes from a massive Dalit rally in Bombay celebrating the anniversary of Ambedkar’s birth. In the book, Naipaul notes that the untouchables reject the patronising Gandhian label Harijan (God's children) in favour of the term Dalit (the oppressed). He also meets former Dalit Panther Namdeo Dhasal, and recognises the fiery resistance in his poetry.\n\nV.S. Naipaul attending a book launch in Paris in 1991.

India’s upper-caste elite controls book publishing and university English departments, making them the exclusive producers, promoters, and critics of Indian-English literature, including works in English translation.\n\nIn India, a strong command of English is essential if one wants to secure well-paid white-collar jobs in government, media, and the corporate world. Snigdha Poonam’s 2018 journalistic work Dreamers captures the desperation of young Indians to learn English in order to get ahead in life. Poonam’s own professional journey proves the significance of English education. Like many upper-caste journalists, she worked in English-language media and published her book in Delhi, after which it was picked up by publishers in the UK and United States, eventually sending her to Western countries to deliver talks as another India expert.\n\nShantanu Gupta (right) and Ajoy Bose (left) in conversation with Snigdha Poonam (centre) during “The Craft of Political Biography” session of the ZEE Jaipur Literature Festival on 29 January 2018 in Jaipur, India. (Photo by Raj K Raj / Hindustan Times via Getty Images)\n\nDalit youth are denied a similar career trajectory because they lack an English-medium education and early-career support. To underline this point, some Dalit leaders have gone to the absurd lengths of erecting a temple dedicated to “the Goddess English”, hailing her as “a deity of liberation”. Worshipping at a temple is no substitute, however, for access to basic necessities and quality education. Moreover, learning English on its own won’t help when India’s academic institutions and job market are invested in sabotaging Dalit success.\n\nVauhini Vara is the only novelist of Dalit origin who has published in English. Her Canadian-American upbringing allowed her to develop as a journalist and writer outside the upper-caste monopoly. Until recent years, India had no Dalit-origin journalist working in English. Curiously, none of the several multinational publishers based in Delhi has bothered to highlight the glaring lack of representation in Indian-English fiction. Over a dozen American creative writing programs, despite their commitment to diversity and inclusion, continue to produce new batches of privileged caste Indian novelists and faculty members, perpetuating the segregation of Dalit voices.\n\nMeanwhile, in India, the Supreme Court and English-language media are busy crafting a narrative that Dalits have developed an elite “creamy layer” that should be excluded from affirmative action in education and government jobs. Amid the growing unrest, this article should also serve as evidence of how even the progressive upper castes exclude Dalits when no one is looking or holding them accountable.\n\nDalit Studies and “artless” Dalit literature\n\nI am not advocating for the expansion of Dalit Studies as an academic discipline, which has become a something of a global movement led by American and European universities. While Critical Caste Studies has its uses, we find ourselves in a peculiar situation where we have far more academic studies and expensive books on Dalit writings than there are established Dalit writers.\n\nSome problems with the Dalit literature brand are articulated by dominant caste writers in the Hindi language. Dalit Hindi writers like Ajay Navaria and Omprakash Valmiki have discussed how their upper-caste colleagues find Dalit fiction to be artless and repetitive, focusing on slums, poverty, genocides, and victimhood. These critics urge Dalit writers to explore broader range of topics — such as Indian nationhood, LGBTIQ+ issues, Islamophobia, global human rights, and climate change.\n\nIn response, Navaria questions why writing about the everyday oppression against millions of Dalits is not a significant topic. He also critiques the portrayal of ill-formed and degraded Dalit characters in upper-caste Hindi fiction. Navaria argues that dominant caste writers should not write novels about Dalits unless they genuinely support affirmative action in education and employment. I would add that similar ethical demands should be made of Indian-English novelists.\n\nTeju Cole during the Edinburgh International Book Festival on 13 August 2017.

When we look at African American literature, it is hard not to be struck by its scope, adventurousness, and literary subversions of what Isabel Wilkerson calls the master racial caste. For example, Teju Cole’s Open City from 2011 is a cosmopolitan novel that bursts with intellectual and creative energy while questioning dominant narratives.\n\nEven more adventurous is Percival Everett’s recent novel James, which retells Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn from the perspective of the caricatured and frequently infantilised escaped slave “Jim” — a character who, in Everett’s hands, is more intelligent than most of his white persecutors, dignified, and playfully subversive.\n\nFollowing Everett’s lead, my advice to the critically hounded Dalit Hindi writers would be to rewrite classics of Hindi literature in which upper-caste writers have depicted Dalit characters as suffering creatures in need of upper-caste pity.\n\nPercival Everett photographed in Pasadena, California, on 28 October 2022. (Photo by G.L. Askew II for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nBut how are Dalit Hindi writers supposed to accomplish this? Who will provide them with the long-term funding and support that African American writers receive from colleges, universities, literary magazines, book publishers, and cultural institutions?\n\nAs for Dalit novelists writing in English, they barely exist. What, then, is the caste of the most acclaimed Indian-English fiction writers? I understand this question could be embarrassing and irritating for the successful writers. Even so, it is an elephant in the room that is begging for a spotlight.\n\nThe caste identity of these authors is not much of a secret. Dominant-caste surnames are easily recognisable to anyone of Indian origin. This is how literary caste networks operate in plain sight, especially in Western countries.\n\nHow the West created an upper-caste echo chamber\n\nThe Western world’s alliance with the upper-caste elite and exclusion of Dalits is an understudied phenomenon. In his extensive research on the legal dimensions of caste, Manoj Mitta shows how colonial British laws interpreted Hindu religious scriptures to endorse caste-based privileges and disabilities. Whether through ignorance or design, Western compliance with the caste hierarchies continues. Western politicians, businesses, and universities only need to curry favour with the upper-caste establishment to form lucrative partnerships and access India’s growing market.\n\nChristian caste prejudice began as early as the missions of Jesuit Roberto de Nobili (1577–1656), who adopted a native lifestyle and sought Brahmin converts. In his book The Light of Asia, Christopher Harding notes that de Nobili claimed to be of the aristocrat-warrior Kshatriya caste and stopped associating with low-caste Christians. Today, a significant number of Indian Christians come from Dalit backgrounds — including 65 per cent of Catholics — yet suffer severe discrimination and remain excluded from positions of leadership. The caste bias in Indian academia and literature closely follows these well-established patterns.\n\nAn internationally recognised Indian-English literature wouldn’t exist without the support of colonial Britain and American universities for the budding novelists. An early success was Mulk Raj Anand’s Untouchable from 1935, with its patronising tone and foggy conclusions about Dalit emancipation. Various other Indian novels have presented Dalits problematically, erasing resistant politics and religious movements such as Navayana Buddhism, the Ravidassias, Ad-Dharm, and Dalit theology. On the other hand, Western publishers have never questioned the ethics of dominant caste writers unilaterally fictionalising Dalit lives.\n\nSuketu Mehta photographed during the Jaipur Literature Festival, 27 January 2020. (Photo by Raj K. Raj / Hindustan Times via Getty Images)\n\nIn his impassioned ode to the American immigrant experience This Land is Our Land, Indian-American writer and professor of journalism Suketu Mehta displays his caste solidarity and pride. He declares that his caste belongs to “a subcategory of Gujarati merchants” and describes how his “caste-fellows” gather for picnics and claim their slice of America. In the United States, there are several dominant-caste organisations that restrict socialising, marriages, and professional connections within their tribe.\n\nMehta doesn’t see how his birth-based caste status simultaneously excludes millions of lower-caste Indians, like those who cannot become merchants without the socio-economic networks, nor can they afford to immigrate to America.\n\nThe caste demographics of Indian literature\n\nIndia’s last comprehensive caste census was conducted in 1931 during the British Raj. According to estimates, no more than 5 per cent of the Indian population belongs to the Brahmin caste. Other top castes form as much as 10 to 15 per cent of the population. Together, these upper-caste individuals have published nearly all Indian-English literature.\n\nThere are ongoing demands for an India-wide caste census, which various upper castes either oppose or ignore, perhaps to avoid exposing their privilege. In 2023, Bihar state’s caste survey revealed that upper castes make up 15.5 per cent of the state’s population, only 3.66 per cent of which are Brahmins.\n\nWhat about India’s most celebrated and successful writers — many of whom have taught in English departments at Indian and Western universities? Where do they fit within the landscape of India’s caste demographics?\n\nIn the following list, I have placed a question mark next to writers whose caste is not confirmed. (I would be happy to make corrections if asked to do so by any author or their literary agent.) Every writer on this list, except one, belongs to a dominant caste. Most of these authors do not support the caste system. Many openly flaunt their leftist, progressive and “anti-Hindutva” credentials. I admire their works. Yet, it is undeniable that their upper-caste connections have allowed them to flourish in the literary world.\n\nAfter the top fifteen pioneering novelists, the names are listed alphabetically based on their surnames:\n\n1.R.K.
