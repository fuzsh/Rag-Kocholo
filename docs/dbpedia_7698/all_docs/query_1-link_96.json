The makers promised him 20 days shoot in a month, but according to the story of the serial, his role in ‘Jodha Akbar’ started reducing. Later, Chetan had a fight with the producer of the show Ekta Kapoor for making fake promises and quit the show. In an interview, while talking about quitting the show, Chetan said,\n\n\"My character was going nowhere. Shalu the Associate Creative Head was the reason I continued with the show post leap. But it was all empty promises leading to nothing. Each day became humiliating to shoot, thus I quit. I am a senior actor and one should respect my integrity. Shalu has no idea how to carve a character.”\n\nLater, he tweeted,\n\n\"I Quit the show people was very unhappy with how my Role Panned out …RIP Adham/Haider Khan Time to quit.

He said,\n\n\"I have realized that it was my mistake and I shouldn’t have got angry at that time. Anger is my weakness and I still feel bad about it. I regret my fight with Ekta. But life teaches you with every experience. When they called me for Chandra Nandni, I was happy that they still care for me. Nobody wants to live in the past so let bygones be bygones and move on. It was a home calling for me. I am having superb time shooting with the cast of Chandra Nandni. We shoot round the clock and giving our best to the ability.” Relationships & More Marital StatusMarried Affairs/GirlfriendsLavinia (air hostess and athlete) Marriage Date12 December 2004\n\nFamily Wife/SpouseLavinia\n\nChildrenSon- Ethan Hansraj (image in wife's section)\n\nParentsFather- Kumar Hansraj (businessman)\n\nMother- Shakuntla Hansraj (doctor)\n\nSiblingsBrother- Nausheel Hansraj\n\nOther RelativeCousin- Jugal Hansraj (actor)\n\nSome Lesser Known Facts About Chetan Hansraj\n\nChetan Hansraj is an Indian actor and model, who is popular for his negative roles in various Hindi TV serials.\n\nHe was born and brought up in Mumbai.\n\nAt the age of 5, he started working as a child model. During an interview, he shared how he developed an interest in modelling. He said,\n\nI saw my cousin Jugal Hansraj’s photograph in a magazine and told my mother that I wanted to follow suit. So, we got some photographs clicked and she sent them out, it was all her hard work. I did 250 print media ads, 50 TV commercials and seven-eight movies, too. Then I did ‘Mahabharat’ after which I took a break. A few years later, I got into modelling and eventually returned to acting.”\n\nHe then appeared as a child model in more than 200 TV commercials such as Nycil, Tata Safari, Thumbs Up, Cinthol, Lakme, and Maruti Wagon R.\n\nHe was inclined towards sports since his school and college days. He was a state-level water polo champion and won various medals in the sport.\n\nIn 1988, he portrayed the role of young Balram in the epic Hindi TV series Mahabharat.’ During an interview, while remembering those days, he said,\n\nI was 14-years-old when I played Balram in Mahabharat, and it was completely magical. All of us used to get lots of feedback and messages from fans via letters. I was in school and every day I used to receive gunny bags full of letters. Back then, there was a photograph-autograph system with fan mails. So, fans would mail me an empty envelope with a return stamp attached and had to sign the picture and send it back with the letter. It was my daily routine. Before going to school, I would sign my pictures and put them in envelopes. Every morning my father would give me a stack of envelopes with pictures to sign.”\n\nHe participated in Gladrags Manhunt and Megamodel Contest in 1994, but he failed to reach the top finalists. He again prepared for the contest, and in 2001, he was declared the second runner-up in Gladrags Manhunt and Megamodel Contest.\n\nIn 1997, he appeared as one of the models in the Hindi music video ‘Deewane To Deewane Hain’ by Shweta Shetty.\n\nIn 2001 and 2002, he appeared in various episodes of the TV series ‘Ssshhhh…Koi Hai.’ Chetan played supporting/cameo roles in various Hindi TV serials such as ‘Kyun Hota Hai Pyarrr’ (2002) and ‘Kkusum’ (2003).\n\nIn 2002, one day he went clubbing alone, and there he met a girl named Lavinia. During an interview, Chetan talked about the meeting. He said,\n\nAt the club, I spotted an old friend of mine. Lavinia was with that friend. I got talking to them and with Lavinia too and we all got along like a house on fire. After sometime a girl came next to me and said hello. And suddenly Lavinia told me to go and hang out with her. I was a little taken aback with her response. But somehow that was the first sign that she really liked me.”\n\nHe continued,\n\nI used to play cricket then and Sundays were no exception. After the game I was dog tired and went home. Suddenly I got a call from her and realised that I conveniently forgot about the dinner plan. I apologised and we went for our first date.”\n\nIn an interview, he shared that at that time his financial condition was not good, so he could not afford a diamond ring for her. He then made a ring out of aluminium foil and proposed to Lavinia for marriage. He added,\n\nLavinia met an old friend and got talking. I found myself getting very jealous. I realised what I felt for her was more than friendship and we actually had our first fight. I made a ring out of silver foil and gave it to her. Tears were rolling down her cheeks and she told me that it meant more than a real ring.”\n\nIn 2004, he played the role of Shashank (Sasha) Garg in the Hindi TV serial ‘Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii’ and gained immense popularity with his role.\n\nChetan has also acted in a few Hindi films including ‘City of Gold’ (2010), ‘Bodyguard’ (2011), ‘Once Upon a Time in Mumbai Dobaara’ (2013), and ‘Shootout at Wadala’ (2013).\n\nHe has participated as a contestant in various Hindi TV reality shows like ‘Nach Baliye 4’ (2008), ‘Iss Jungle Se Mujhe Bachao’ (2009), ‘Welcome – Baazi Mehmaan Nawazi Ki’ (2013), and ‘Lock Upp’ (2022).\n\nHe has played negative roles in various Hindi TV serials like ‘Jodha Akbar’ (2013), ‘Devon Ke Dev…Mahadev’ (2014), ‘Chandra Nandini’ (2016), ‘Naagin 3’ (2018), ‘Brahmarakshas 2’ (2020). During an interview, he talked about getting typecast for his negative roles in the Hindi TV serials. He said,\n\nGetting typecast in a negative role has never bothered me. Of course, I have played a few good boy roles too. But personally I enjoy playing a bad man on screen as then the character has a lot to do. Positive characters ka ek dayra hota hai and you can not cross that. People have accepted me in a particular genre and I am happy about that. In fact, every time I get an offer of a bad man, I am quite excited about it. The makers sometimes have offered me positive roles too but I have not been kicked about it. I am happy being a professional villain on TV.”\n\nApart from acting and modelling, he has worked as a lead developer for a year in a private firm Xtrathin Design Private Limited, Mumbai, in 2019. He started working as an unreal engine trainer at ‘The Happiness Room,’ a private firm in Goa, in 2021. In the same year, he joined a company named Director’s Kcut in Mumbai.\n\nIn his leisure time, he loves to go on motorcycle rides with his friends and do various adventure sports.\n\nChetan has been featured on the cover page of a few renowned magazines. On the cover of the magazine Parents India, he was featured along with his son, and on the cover of Homemaker magazine, he was featured along with his wife.\n\nHe is a dog lover and owns a pet dog named Zack.\n\nHe is a fitness enthusiast and regularly visits the gym. He also practices Yoga & meditation. In an interview, he shared his morning routine. He said,\n\nWhen I wake up in the mornings, I do my breathing exercises and meditate almost everyday for about 30 minutes. Later, I workout for 45 minutes. I do these activities daily as they help to relax me and are a great way to kickstart my day. My fitness idol is Arnold Schwarzenegger.”\n\nChetan Hansraj owns a white coloured Hyundai car.\n\nHe smokes and drinks alcohol at parties and various events."
