Looking back, I'm simply amazed at all that we have been able to achieve over the years. I'm fortunate to have had the opportunity to contribute towards the growth of AWS India, our customers/partners and also to grow along. Starting off as the first India Partner SA in 2014 to leading the GSI and Partner Core SA teams, it has been an amazing journey, replete with many 'firsts' and key milestones. Working with some of the smartest minds in the industry is such a privilege and I have nothing but gratitude for all my leaders, team members and colleagues who have helped me grow both professionally and personally (not tagging anyone as the list is huge and don't want to spam with notifications). Thank you for all your trust, support and friendship. Wish you the very best! On to new beginnings! ðŸš€ P.S. Heartfelt thanks to the India Partner team for the lovely sendoff. Will treasure the memories :)"
