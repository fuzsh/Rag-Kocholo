        "text": "They predicted the death of occasion wear and the age of sweatpants. They predicted the death of a restaurant and the age of delivery apps. They talked of how the restaurant would never be the same again and even questioned the role of one in society. But what the research pundits and hot takes on the internet got wrong while crystal ball-gazing during the pandemic was just how quickly we would shake it all off, eager to dust off those sequins, polish those wingtips and step into the spotlight again. Bengaluru’s blue-eyed boy chef Manu Chandra is back—after launching a catering company, content outfit and culinary consultancy—with his own bold, sprawling new restaurant on MG Road. This is Chandra’s first physical space after stepping away in 2021 from the Olive Group, a company he served for 17 long years while building memorable culinary brands like Fatty Bao, Monkey Bar, Toast & Tonic and Begum Victoria cheese. Chandra has tied up with long-time friend, Olive Group veteran and hospitality expert Chetan Rampal for the new project.\n\nInside LUPA, Manu Chandra’s new Bengaluru restaurant\n\nLUPA—named after the mythological she-wolf who raised Romulus and Remus, the founders of the city of Rome—is a tribute both to Chandra's love of history as well as his “backstory and untameable spirit.” The impressive 11,000sqft restaurant is designed like an Italian villa and draws from the many years of Chandra’s travels to Italy, both in design and food. Think round glass panels and wrought iron grill work à la Capri, custom-made curved terracotta roof tiles and vases inspired by Tuscany and stone-finish flooring, marble fountains and a gleaming, all-brass bar countertop reminiscent of Milan’s slick bistros. “I was always fascinated by Italy’s details, from the ceramics to the marble to the food, of course. It’s stayed with me but I was never really able to put it in anything that I ever did.” Of Chandra’s previous ventures, Monkey Bar was an ode to the grungy bars of NYC and Toast & Tonic was inspired by those in the East Village. This time, he looked to Italy, to imbibe some of that large-hearted hospitality for his new venture.\n\nSplit across a warm outdoor section— where you can be soothed by water fountains that drown out the traffic outside—and an opulent, high-ceiling indoor dining area, LUPA offers multiple unique touch points for diners. There’s a salumeria cum small plates bar from where guests can snack on tapas-style bites and in-house cured meats, as well as a ‘gelato lab’ with a Cattabriga gelato machine that will dole out freshly-churned batches of gelato in mere minutes. Down a winding staircase 12 feet below ground level, a stone wine cellar sits, with a curated list of about 2,000 bottles of wine. This, Chandra explains, will be an exclusive tasting zone for not more than 10 people and will be available only by prior appointment.\n\nWe kick things off with a twist on the Sgroppino, a cocktail originally from Venice. LUPA’s version swaps lemon sorbet and vodka for a house-made pomegranate sorbet with gin, vermouth, orange zest and prosecco. We pair this refreshing bubbly with the salumi platter of parma ham, mortadella, Spanish chorizo and Black Forest ham, served alongside tigelle buns from the Emilia-Romagna region, gnocchi fritto and condiments.\n\n‘A rebellion against the stupidification of food’\n\nAs I watch the Metro whiz by overhead from the outdoor section, my conversation with Chandra moves to how the city has seen much innovation in its culinary scene over the past few years. Everything, from FarmLore, a unique farm-to-table restaurant on the outskirts of the city, to Naru, Kavan Kuttappa’s eight-seater ramen bar and Elizabeth Yorke’s Saving Grains that upcycles spent grain from breweries into food products and award-winning bars, has made its mark on the city’s F&B scene, attracting curious cooks and eaters alike. But what many don’t know is that much of the crop of Bengaluru’s new culinary ventures is sprinkled with graduates—such as Kuttappa and Yorke—from the Manu Chandra training school. Kutappa worked under Chandra years ago and Yorke assisted the chef for the Serendipity Arts Festival. “Because I started so young, I’ve been around for a long time, and to see the industry grow has been a great joy for me,” says Chandra, as we chomp on the next dish that arrives, the Caesar salad. (When in Rome, right?) Unlike the usual Caesars that are often too dry, LUPA’s version coats shredded Romaine lettuce in a glossy, creamy egg dressing and adds plump grilled chicken and parma ham floss. The salad swaps out croutons with a garlic sourdough rosette that adds a nice crunch to our bites.\n\nWe move to the classic negroni which is a well-balanced gin, Campari and sweet vermouth combination that we pair with the steak tartare that Chandra mixes tableside. “Guests love a little tableside action,” Chandra grins, as he shares just one of the many learnings he’s gleaned from more than 20 years in the business. “By now, I’m not trying to guess what diners would like, but I’d like to think I know.” The well-designed kitchen space with ample room for staff to move around and air-conditioning vents in the outdoor section are examples of this. While most of the food at LUPA draws from European flavours, there are some dishes that play with elements from Asia. Finely sliced slivers of hamachi crudo dissolve on our tongues soon after they arrive on the table. They’re brightened by a red cabbage and ponzu dressing, bonito mayo and coriander leaves.\n\nCarb loaders will love the Arroz de Pato, the restaurant’s version of Portuguese duck rice that cooks the fragrant rice with aromatic duck stock, spices, cured duck breast and chorizo. Oxtail Raviolo, too, is comforting like the duck rice, with a runny egg yolk and bone marrow broth giving it a glossy mouthfeel. We don’t have space for much else, but the menu lists a wide range of pasta (cacio pepe, corzetti) and pizza (quattro formaggi, nduja and fresh fennel, calabrese), should you be inclined to carb out. We end the meal with a gigantic bowl of wonderfully airy tiramisu that’s served tableside with espresso and biscotti. When I eyeball the homestyle portion of the dessert, Chandra explains: “This is a back-to-basics approach in many ways, but we've gone all out. It's a rebellion against the stupidification of food. So if I offer tiramisu, I give you a damn tiramisu. It won’t be deconstructed anymore but will come in a giant bloody bowl. I'll give you a hunk full on your plate. And if you want a little extra, it's fine, because you get the whole bowl. That's hospitality. That's generosity. And I hope that’s what people will appreciate.” And appreciate, we do.\n\nLUPA will soon be a buzzy hotspot to see and be seen at in Bengaluru. It’s clear that Chandra has given it his all, carefully ironing out wrinkles to create a well-oiled establishment. Now’s probably a good time to dust off those sequins, but we’d say, save the sweatpants. You’ll need them after that bowl of tiramisu.\n\nMeal for two with alcohol: Rs4,500. Ground Floor, Spencer’s Towers, No.86, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Bengaluru. LUPA will open to the public on 6 February.\n\nHere's what you can expect :"
