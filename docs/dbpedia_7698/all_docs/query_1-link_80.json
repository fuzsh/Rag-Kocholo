        "text": "If youâre looking for a special name for your little boy, you might like to consider dipping into the history of India. Its ancient culture, along with multiple languages and religious traditions, may offer up numerous naming options that are unparalleled in their uniqueness. Whether youâre Indian American or your family has Indian heritage, or youâd like a name to set your baby apart from the crowd, check out this list of popular, modern, cool, unique, and cute Indian boy names.\n\nSelecting Indian Names for Boys\n\nIf youâre considering Indian names for boys, you might like to learn more about how names are traditionally chosen before making your final decision. In India, naming is often influenced by region and religion. Hereâs a brief introduction to Indiaâs regional languages and religions.\n\nIndiaâs Regional Languages\n\nHere are some of the main regional languages that can be found in India as well as in its bordering nations. These may influence your choice of name.\n\nHindi is the main language in India and the fourth-most commonly spoken language in the world. Itâs used mostly in northern, eastern, central, and western India.\n\nUrdu is the main language of Pakistan, whose main religion is Islam. Itâs also used in northern and south-central India.\n\nTelugu belongs to the Dravidian language family and is spoken mostly in southeastern India.\n\nMarathi is spoken in the Indian state of Maharashtra in western India.\n\nKannada is also part of the Dravidian language family and is spoken mostly by the Karnataka people in southwestern India.\n\nGujarati is the language spoken in the Indian state of Gujarat in western India. Itâs also one of the most common Indian languages in the United States and Canada.\n\nTamil is another Dravidian language found in in southern India and Sri Lanka.\n\nPunjabi is spoken in the Indian state of Punjab in northwestern India and eastern Pakistan.\n\nBengali is spoken in eastern India and Bangladesh.\n\nIndiaâs Religions\n\nWhen searching for Indian male names, you may realize that all your options are influenced by the various religions in India and its bordering nations. Here are the some religions that may come up in your name search for Indian boy names:\n\nHinduism is the most ancient religion in the world and the worldâs third-largest religion with 95 percent of its believers living in India. Hindu naming options derive from its polytheistic mythology, astrology, philosophy, and cosmology.\n\nSikhism is the fourth-largest religion in India. Itâs traditional for males to be given the middle name Singh, which means âlion.â\n\nIslam is Indiaâs second-most commonly followed religion. Muslims in India follow Islamic naming conventions, which often have roots in Arabic or Persian.\n\nJainism is one of the worldâs oldest religions. Followers commonly use Jain, Shah, Firodia, Singhal, or Gupta as their last name.\n\nNaming Conventions\n\nAs is true with most Asian boy names, choosing Indian baby boy names involves many factors beyond region and religion. Here are some examples as to how names are used in India:\n\nIn northern India, people have a given name followed by a surname.\n\nIn southern India, surnames are uncommon, and are usually adopted by people who migrate.\n\nThe meanings of given names are of the utmost importance, and names for children are chosen specifically for that reason.\n\nFollowers of Hinduism consult an astrologer to help them choose a name for their child thatâs based on a horoscope reading. The astrologer will select a prefix for the parents, who will then choose a name including that specific prefix. For example, the astrologer may specify the prefix Su, and the parents can then choose from among names such as Sunil, Suraj, Surendra, Surya, etc.\n\nCommon and Popular Indian Boy Names\n\nThe following menâs names of Indian origin made up the top 10 in the United States in 2021.
