        "text": "MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nA total number of 141 sites from six patients (67 sites from three non-smoker patients and 74 sites from three smoker patients) with periodontal pockets measuring 5 to 7 mm in different quadrants of mouth were selected, between 20 to 50 years from Outpatient Department of Periodontics College of Dental Sciences, Davangere, Karnataka, India. The Ethical committee of College of Dental Sciences, Davangere, Karnataka, India, approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.\n\nThe study included patients diagnosed as suffering from chronic generalized periodontitis. Patient selected had periodontal pocket measuring 5-7 mm in depth in different quadrants of the mouth and signs of bone loss on clinical and radiographic examination were observed [ ]. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, teeth with furcation involvement, and patients with known hypersensitivity reaction to CHX were excluded from the study. These patients did not receive any periodontal therapy for past 6 months and were free of any systemic diseases.[4] The selected sites were randomly divided into 3 groups [ ].\n\nPrior to SRP, each selected site was subjected to assessment of the following clinical parameter: Plaque index (PI) (Silness and Loe),[5] Gingival index (GI) (Loe and Silness),[6] Bleeding index (BI) (Ainamo and Bay),[7] Relative attachment level (RAL) using UNC-15 periodontal probe, subgingival microbiological plaque samples. The clinical parameters were assessed on day ‘0’, 30th, and 90th day. RAL was assessed only on ‘0’ day and 90th day and microbiological samples were collected on the ‘0’ and 30th day only.\n\nSubgingival microbiological palque samples\n\nSubgingival microbial plaque samples were taken from the periodontal pocket at baseline and on 30th day with the help of fine endodontic paper points. After removing supragingival plaque, two fine endodontic paper points were inserted to the depth of each periodontal pocket for 10 seconds and then transferred to 1 ml Thioglycollate broth (transport medium) and sealed tightly to avoid contamination [Figures and ]. Samples were processed within 2 days of collection. Once it was received in the laboratory, the sample was mixed thoroughly and 5 μl, each was inoculated using sterile loop onto the following mediums: Enriched blood agar (Porphyromonas gingivalis), Brewer's anaerobic agar (Fusobacterium nucleatum), and Bacteroides bile esculin agar (Tannerella forsythia)[8]\n\nProcedural steps for chlosite administration\n\nChlosite was provided as a single-dose syringe with 0.5 ml of xanthan gel, which contains a mixture of chlorhexidine digluconate and chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, in a ratio of 1: 2. The gel was administered in experimental site A (SRP plus Chlosite) and experimental site B (Chlosite only) on ‘0’ day. The periodontal pocket was washed with distilled water and then dried with paper points before subgingival administration of Chlosite. Subgingival administration was accomplished by inserting the single-dose syringe to the base of the periodontal pocket first and then working the way up, until the gingival margin [Figures and ]. Chlosite undergoes a progressive process of imbibition, and gets physically removed from the application site within 10 to 30 days, making a follow-up visit for removal of the material unnecessary. After the treatment, patients were instructed to avoid eating hard, crunchy or sticky foods for one week, and postpone brushing for 12 hours period, as well as touching the treated areas. Patients should also postpone the use of interproximal cleaning devices for 10 days.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nCHX is a widely used broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent to inhibit bacterial growth and, thus, an adjunctive mean to control oral hygiene in patients with periodontal disease. Attempts to prolong the subgingival application of CHX by incorporation of an antiseptic in a gel have not resulted in improved treatment outcomes,[9] However, with the use of chlosite, effective subgingival concentration of CHX can be maintained for several days. The physical properties of xanthan render it an optimum substrate for the formation of a stable gel that is easily extruded from a syringe needle; therefore, xanthan appears to be the best biocompatible vehicle for clinical application.[10]\n\nIn non-smokers, the mean reduction in PI from ‘0’ to 90th day was 83.3 and 84.6% for SRP and SRP + CHL, respectively. However, the difference in PI at ‘0’ to 90th day between the two groups was statistically not significant. These findings were similar to the findings of Azmak et al.[11] who studied the effect of subgingival-controlled release delivery of 2.5 mg of CHX chip on clinical parameters of chronic periodontitis patients, in patients receiving SRP + CHX and SRP alone groups. Mean reduction in plaque score from baseline to 90th day for CHL was 58.3%, which was statistically highly significant. In smokers, the mean reduction in plaque score from ‘0’ to 90th day was 46.2, 66.7, and 14.3% in SRP, SRP + CHL, and CHL, respectively, which was statistically highly significant in SRP and SRP + CHL and significant in relation to CHL. On comparison of non-smokers vs smokers, the mean difference of plaque score between ‘0’ to 90th day for SRP and CHL was statistically significant and for SRP + CHL, it was statistically not significant.\n\nIn non-smokers, the mean reduction in BI from ‘0’ to 90th day was 100% for SRP and SRP + CHL, respectively. However, the difference in BI at ‘0’ to 90th day between the two groups was statistically significant. These findings are similar to the findings of Pennuti et al.[12] who studied the efficacy of 0.5% CHX gel on the control of gingivitis in mentally handicapped patients over a period of 8 weeks. In smokers, the mean reduction in bleeding score from ‘0’ to 90th day was 100% in SRP, SRP + CHL, and CHL, and it was statistically highly significant in all the above-mentioned three treatment modalities. On comparison of non-smokers vs smokers, the mean difference of bleeding score between ‘0’ to 90 th day was statistically significant for SRP and statistically not significant for SRP + CHL and CHL.\n\nIn non-smokers, the mean reduction in gingival score from ‘0’ to 90th day was 88.9 and 85.7% for SRP and SRP + CHL, respectively. These findings were similar to that of Unsal et al.[13] who studied the clinical effects of subgingival placement of 1% CHX gel in adult periodontitis patients over a duration of 12 weeks. There was 54.6% mean reduction in gingival score from baseline to 90th day, which was statistically highly significant. In smokers, the mean reduction in gingival score from ‘0’ to 90th day was 84.5, 63.6, and 66.7% which was highly significant for SRP and SRP + CHL, whereas significant for CHL. On comparison of non-smokers vs smokers, the mean difference in GI between ‘0’ to 90th day was statistically significant for SRP and SRP + CHL and statistically not significant for CHL.\n\nIn non-smokers, the mean gain in RAL from ‘0’ to 90th day was 24.7 and 18.5% for SRP and SRP + CHL, respectively. These findings were similar to that of Soskolne et al.[14] who studied the changes in probing depth following 2 years of periodontal maintenance therapy including adjunctive controlled release of biodegradable CHX chip. There was 20.4% mean gain in RAL from baseline to 90th day for CHL, which was statistically highly significant. In smokers, the mean gain in RAL from ‘0’ to 90th day was 23.7, 21, and 20.4% for SRP, SRP + CHL, and CHL, respectively, which was highly significant. On comparison of RAL in non-smokers vs smokers, the mean difference in RAL between ‘0’ to 90th day for SRP, SRP + CHL, and CHL was statistically not significant.\n\nOn comparison of non smokers with smokers Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythis showed reduction which was statistically not significant. The findings for the three bacteria are similar to that of Daneshmand et al.[15]"
