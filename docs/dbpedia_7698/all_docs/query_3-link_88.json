        "text": "The Supreme Court on Monday denied a petition seeking to have Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's birthday (January 23) declared a national holiday every year.\n\nA bench led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud observed that the relief sought clearly fell within the realm of executive policy and that hearing such a case would be unjustified.\n\nDuring the hearing, the bench at the outset observed that the Supreme Court cannot issue the directions sought as it is a matter of government policy.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe petitioner, in person, submitted that the contribution of Bose is not recognised.\n\nThe CJI advised the petitioner that the best way to honour Bose's contribution was to work as hard as he did.\n\n\"Best way you can recognise his contribution is to work hard, like he worked hard for freedom. Not by adding to the holidays. That is a matter for the government to decide. We wonâ€™t advise the government one way or the other,\" the CJI said.\n\nThe petitioner also proposed that the government build a memorial hall and museum to honour Bose and hoist the national flag every year on August 15 and January 26.\n\nWhile the petitioner argued that it is appropriate to honour Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose for his selfless service to India's independence, the bench dismissed the request, stating that this is a matter for the Government of India to decide."
