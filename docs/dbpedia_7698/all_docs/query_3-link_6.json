        "text": "15th-century Indian Vaishnavite Hindu saint\n\n\"Krishna Chaitanya\" redirects here. For the Telugu lyricist, see Krishna Chaitanya (lyricist).\n\n\"Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu\" redirects here. For the 1954 Hindi film, see Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (film).\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu (Bengali: মহাপ্রভু শ্রীচৈতন্য দেব, Sanskrit: श्री चैतन्य महाप्रभु), born Vishvambhara Mishra (IAST: Viśvambhara Miśra),[1] (1486–1533 CE) was an Indian Hindu saint from Bengal and the founder of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mode of worshipping Krishna with bhajan-kirtan and dance had a profound effect on Vaishnavism in Bengal.\n\nHe is considered the chief proponent of the Vedantic philosophy of Achintya Bheda Abheda. However, the concept of inconceivable difference in non-difference, known as achintya-bhedabheda, was developed later by Jiva Gosvami in his book Bhagavat Sandharbha.\n\nMahaprabhu founded Gaudiya Vaishnavism (a.k.a. the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya). He expounded Bhakti yoga and popularised the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra.[4] He composed the Shikshashtakam (eight devotional prayers).\n\nChaitanya is sometimes called Gauranga (IAST: Gaurāṅga) or Gaura due to his molten gold–like complexion.[5] His birthday is celebrated as Gaura-purnima.[6][7] He is also called Nimai because he was born underneath a Neem tree.[8]\n\nLife\n\n[edit]\n\nChaitanya was born in a Brahmin family as Viśvambhara Mishra aka Nimāi, the second son of Jagannātha Mishra and his wife Śacī Devī, the daughter of Nilambara Chakrabarti, both Brahmins of Sylhet region.[1] Jagannātha Mishra's family were from the village of Dhakadakshin in Srihatta (Sylhet) (now in Bangladesh). The ruins of their ancestral home still survive in present-day Bangladesh.[9][11]\n\nAccording to Chaitanya Charitamrita, Chaitanya was born in Nabadwip (in present-day West Bengal) on the full moon night of 18 February 1486, at the time of a lunar eclipse.[12][13][14]\n\nWhile still a student, his father died, and he soon married Lakṣmīpriyā. He travelled to east Bengal to become a scholar and support his family, but his wife died in his absence. He then married Viṣṇupriyā, the daughter of paṇḍit Sanātana Miśra. Viśvambhara, also known as Nimāi Paṇḍit, was a promising Sanskrit scholar and once defeated Keśava Bhaṭṭa of the Nimbārka school in a debate on Sanskrit prosody.[11]\n\nIn 1508-1509 he left Nabadvip to go to Gaya to perform śrāddha, a ritual homage to his dead father. There, he met an ascetic named Īśvara Purī, who initiated him using a mantra for Kṛṣṇa worship. After this meeting Viśvambhara abandoned all scholarly and domestic pursuits and had no interest except hearing and speaking of Kṛṣṇa. Within a year he took a vow of saṃnyāsa (renunciation) and changed his name to Kṛṣṇa Caitanya under his guru Keśava Bhāratī. His mother then asked him to at least live in the city of Puri so that he would not be too far from Bengal.[11]\n\nAfter becoming a renunciate he spent his time converting and instructing followers in the tenets of Kṛṣṇa bhakti and engaging in communal saṁkīrtana. Notably he is said to have debated and converted followers of Advaita Vedānta or Māyāvāda. He spent two months in Vrindavan in c. 1515 where he instructed Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmi. The last two decades of his life were spent in Puri where he focused on immersing himself in devotional yearning for Kṛṣṇa and his consorts, mainly Rādhā. He died c. 1528-1534.[11]\n\nBiographies\n\n[edit]\n\nWorks on Chaitanya:[17]\n\nKrsna-Caitanya-Caritamrta (c. 1513 or 1536–1540; Sanskrit)\n\nBy Murari Gupta. Known as a kadcha or chronicle. Chaitanya's Navadwipa līla and each panca-tattva presented as a form of the Lord. Caitanya went for the first time to Murari's house at Navadwipa. Murari's standing and reputation for learning gave his biographical materials great weight in the Vaishnava community. This Kadcha (notes) became the guiding lines for other biographers.\n\nKadcha or chronicle (Sanskrit)\n\nBy Svarupa Damodara. He was the personal secretary of Chaitanya. Details the life of Caitanya.\n\nGovindadaser Kadcha (Bengali)\n\nBy Govinda Dāsa who accompanied Chaitanya on his tour of Deccan.

A narrative play depicting Chaitanya's childhood activities and his human side without highlighting any divine matters to make it popular. Influenced by Murari Gupta's Krsna-Caitanya-Caritamrta and Vrindavana Dasa Thakura's Chaitanya Bhagavata as well as the Mahabharata and different Puranas.\n\nChaitanya-chandrodaya-kaumudi (Bengali)\n\nBy Premadas (Purushottam Mishra).

Commentary on Krishnadasa Kaviraja's Caitanya-caritāmṛta, based on Bhaktivinoda Thakur's Amrita-pravaha-bhashya and Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati's Anubhāsya commentaries.\n\nKrishna-Caitanya, His Life and His Teachings (2014; English; ISBN 978-91-981318-1-9)\n\nBy Walther Eidlitz, originally written in German - Kṛṣṇa-Caitanya: sein Leben und seine Lehre, and published by Stockholm University, 1968, as a part of the scientific series \"Stockholm studies in comparative religion\".\n\nTeachings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Gaudiya Vaishnavism § Philosophical concepts\n\nChaitanya's epistemological, theological and ontological teachings are summarised as ten root principles called dasa mula.[18]\n\nPhilosophy and tradition\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom the very beginning of Chaitanya's bhakti movement in Bengal, Haridasa Thakur and others, Muslim or Hindu by birth, were participants.[citation needed] Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the great sage of Dakshineswar, who lived in the 19th century, emphasised the bhakti marga of Chaitanya, whom he referred to as \"Gauranga.\" (The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna).[citation needed] This openness received a boost from Bhaktivinoda Thakura's broad-minded vision in the late 19th century and was institutionalised by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in his Gaudiya Matha in the 20th century.[failed verification]\n\nIn the 20th century the teachings of Chaitanya were brought to the West for the first time by Baba Premananda Bharati (1858–1914), the author of Sree Krishna—the Lord of Love (1904)—the first full-length treatment of Gaudiya Vaishnavism in English. In1902, he founded the short-lived \"Krishna Samaj\" society in New York City and built a temple in Los Angeles. He belonged to the circle of guru Prabhu Jagadbandhu with teachings similar to the later ISKCON mission. His followers later formed several organisations, including now defunct the Order of Living Service and the AUM Temple of Universal Truth. Another prominent missionary was A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (1896-1977), a representative of the Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati branch of Chaitanya's tradition. Prabhupada founded his movement known as The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) to spread Chaitanya's teachings throughout the world.[25] Saraswata gurus and acharyas, members of the Goswami lineages and several other Hindu sects which revere Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, including devotees from the major Vaishnava holy places in Mathura District, West Bengal and Odisha, also established temples dedicated to Krishna and Chaitanya outside India in the closing decades of the 20th century.[citation needed]\n\nCultural legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Bengal Renaissance\n\nChaitanya's influence on the cultural legacy in Bengal, Odisha and Manipur, has been significant,[26] with many residents performing daily worship to him as an avatar of Krishna. Some attribute to him a Renaissance in Bengal,[27] different from the more well-known 19th-century Bengal Renaissance. Salimullah Khan (b. 1958), a noted Bangladeshi linguist, maintains, \"Sixteenth-century is the time of Chaitanya Dev, and it is the beginning of Modernism in Bengal. The concept of 'humanity' that came into fruition is contemporaneous with that of Europe\".[28]\n\nNoted Bengali biographical film on Chaitanya, Nilachaley Mahaprabhu (1957), was directed by Kartik Chattopadhyay (1912–1989).[29] A Bengali film based on Chaitanya's demise, Lawho Gouranger Naam Re, will be directed by Srijit Mukherji where Parambrata Chatterjee will be seen portraying Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.[30]\n\nRecognition\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2024, speaking at the commemorative event for the 150th birth anniversary of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi called Chaitanya Mahaprabhu “the touchstone of love for Krishna. He made spiritualism and meditation accessible to the masses” and recalled his own personal experience of the transformative power of bhakti through kirtan.\n\nPhoto gallery\n\n[edit]\n\nYogapith temple at Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's birthsite established in the 1880s by Bhaktivinoda Thakur in Mayapur, West Bengal\n\nChaitanya and Nityananda are shown performing a 'kirtan' in the streets of Nabadwip, Bengal.\n\nPancha Tattva deities installed on a Vaishnava altar.
