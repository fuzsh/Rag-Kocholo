        "text": "I have three kids but 11 names for them, because each one of them has approximately three nicknames assigned by different members of the family. Do we actually call them by the names given to them at birth? Not as much. And yet, choosing a baby name is one decision parents often belabor and debate for months.\n\nI was looking for a name that's easy to pronounce, sounded American yet ethnic and was somehow meaningful. My husband and I scoured the internet searching for inspiration for a name for my son. If you're looking for an Indian baby boy name, I've shared my research to get you started.\n\nIronically enough, I found my son's name offline. But if you're struggling like we were, sources of inspiration can be anywhere, from Hindu theology to Bollywood films. Here, some top Indian baby boy names to consider in 2024.\n\nNote: There are many languages spoken in India — including Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu and Urdo, among many others — which means lots of sources for inspiration for baby names. In addition to referencing the Social Security Administration (SSA), which provides a list of top 1,000 baby names, this list was also curated from a few hidden gems I looked to when searching for my son's name: small businesses who sell South Asian-inspired baby products that can be personalized with names. These include , the maker of mantra-singing plush toys; Her Sun & Stars Co., which sells personalized minky blankets and Creative Crafty Mom, who provides personalized rakhis for Raksha Bandhan. These were an unexpected source of great baby names.\n\nMost Popular Indian Boy Names\n\nAccording to BabyCenter in India, these are some top baby boy names.\n\nAarav\n\nAdvik\n\nArjun\n\nAvyan\n\nAyansh\n\nDhruv\n\nIvaan\n\nKabir\n\nKartik\n\nKeshav\n\nKiaan\n\nKrishna\n\nMalhar\n\nSai\n\nShivansh\n\nVed\n\nVedant\n\nViraj\n\nVivaan\n\nReyansh\n\nLooking for more baby boy name inspiration?
