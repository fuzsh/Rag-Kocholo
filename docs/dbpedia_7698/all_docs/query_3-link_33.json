A gang of 20 people assaulted him, prompting Chetan to recount the harrowing experience through a live broadcast on Instagram. He described how an unknown, seemingly intoxicated individual first followed and damaged his car. 'I sensed that the man was trying to rob, so I approached him regarding the car damage. In no time, a group of about 20 individuals, including a woman, gathered and began assaulting me,' he stated. Chetan promptly visited a nearby police station to file a complaint, expressing his dismay over the incident. 'Look at what happened to me today. They attacked me severely and even broke my nose. I received initial treatment from the police. However, the gang responsible for the attack returned and damaged my car again. It's a terrible experience,' he revealed. Known for his roles in the Kannada soap 'Sathyam Shivam Sundaram' and several Kannada films, Chetan's ordeal has sparked concerns about safety and security in Bengaluru.",
