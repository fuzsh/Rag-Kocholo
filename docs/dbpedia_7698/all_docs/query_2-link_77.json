        "text": "Chetan Chandra Biography\n\nChetan Chandra is a noted actor associated with Kannada film industry. Known for his physique and fabulous 8-pack, he was seen in a new avatar for ‘Simha Rashi’. Chetan has undergone many makeovers for many of his film roles and has been appreciated for his commitments towards the roles. Chetan got noticed for the first time through Premism and there was no turning back for this actor. Kumbha Rashi, Biscuit etc are a few more noted roles for which the actor has undergone make overs. He was seen in a rough and tough avatar in Kumbha Rashi, flaunting 8-pack ab while he was seen as a happy-go-lucky person in the comedy – Biscuit, the movie which had a delayed release with a new name, Jaathre. Kumbha Rashi too sank without any trace.\n\nHe was born in Kunigal, Karnataka to K B Ramachandra and B N Anusuya. His father worked as a mining engineer in Malaysia. He has one brother who is an IT engineer. He made his acting debut in the 2008 film, PUC. But it was his second film, Premism directed by Ratnaja which gave him the major break to the industry. He played lead role opposite Amulya and the film received good response from critics and audience as expected. The movie was well praised for its storyline and performances. This love triangle was a neat presentation for family audience too, which helped Chetan to get a good image among audience.\n\nThe movies released later include – Rajadhani, Jarasandha, Kumbha Rashi, Huchudagaru, Plus, Jaathre etc. A few of his films got shelved which badly affected his career. Love Churumuri and Nam Areali Innondina are among those movies which changed his fortune. His released films too did only average business at box office. His delayed project Biscuit was later released with the name Jaathre.\n\nPublished: N/A"
