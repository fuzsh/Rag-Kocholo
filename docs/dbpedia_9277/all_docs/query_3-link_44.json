        "text": "Hello Marc,\n\nAlbanian is already used in many cities/villages in Macedonia (E.g. Tetove https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/6928757). We just need to add the Albanian version of the name as “name:sq” if the name is originally in Macedonian. Or the Macedonian version of the name as “name:mk” if the name is originally in Albanian.\n\nActually we can put the names of any city in the world in Albanian as “name:sq” (when available), it doesn’t need to have 20% Albanian ethnicity.\n\nNote that OSM follows “On the Ground Rule” (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Disputes#On_the_Ground_Rule). Names recorded in name=* tag are ones that are locally used, especially ones typically signposted.\n\nCheers,\n\nJavier\n\nHello Javier,\n\ni think the signposts on the road are going to be replaced to include both languages, if they don’t have that now.\n\nIn Kosovo, we use both names in the main name tag like here https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4228419044 .\n\nIf the Village has more Albanians than Serbians, we put the Albanian name first and the other way around.\n\nThe first name is the name of the majority, then comes the name of the largest minority of that Village.\n\nFor Cities it is only the name of the majority, E.g. Gjilan (Albanian) or Gračanica (Serbian).\n\nCheers,\n\nBardh\n\nHello Bardh,\n\nThank you very much for the information about Kosovo. In my opinion the naming according the amount of population per ethnicity goes against the naming convention of OSM. Two names in the field “name” might cause probems on search engines and different applications/APPs that search complete match.\n\nAdditionally this method is also difficult to maintain if the amount of one ethnicity surpasses the other one that was bigger before or if a new ethnicity comes you will need to add three names. Cyprus had the same dispute about the names and they solved it with the “On the Ground Rule”. I advice Kosovo to do the same.\n\nSo, if new signs are going to be replaced in Macedonia, then we have to wait until they are in place and fill the “name” and “name:XX” fields accordingly. “name” should contain the name that comes first (only one name).\n\nCheers,\n\nJavier\n\nPlaces in Macedonia as elsewhere may to be named in Albanian. or any language.\n\ntag name=Macedonian/Albanian can not exist.\n\nWhy?\n\nMacedonian language is official in Macedonia. Albanian, or any other minority language may be added as: name:sq/name:sr etc.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they are minority languages, not official languages of the country.\n\nWhen you talk about “Kosovo” is see no double name in Gjilan. Albanian is co-official with serbian in Kosovo, right?\n\nFirst settle those things in KiM, then come to set here.\n\nAny edit, will be considered as provocation.\n\nHello from the Data Working Group.\n\nFirst of all, I note that “slash” naming is already used in a few other countries, for example Belgium, BiH or Switzerland.\n\nWe then urge all participants to re-read https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Disputes and to discuss things here instead of engaging in retaliatory mapping. OpenStreetMap is not a forum for politics, but a means for understanding. Disputes are not to be carried out in the map, but in discussion. Any editor who does not abide by this, and does not respect agreements in the area, or ultimately the “on the ground” rule, risks losing the right to participate in OpenStreetMap.\n\nMontenegro: Montenegrin in the latin script is used on the ground.\n\nKosovo: Albanian and Serbian in the latin script are used on the ground.\n\nMacedonia: Macedonian (cyrillic script) and Albanian (latin script) are used on the ground.\n\nThe names as tagged on OSM should match that.\n\nIf this is mistaken, please share the information showing that the reality on the ground is different.\n\nIn Montenegro there are no montenegrin language for places: https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/708006203 (albanian)\n\nIn Kosovo I see no doubled name for capital or other towns.\n\nBut yes, reverting vandalism. Macedonian is bilingual now without law signed by the president, and without census of the population since 2002.\n\nVery good.\n\nFor example there are road signs in Albania in Macedonian and greek, but places are nor labelled bilingual\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGIMyXCFiwY\n\nWhy?\n\nMy opinion is that should be parallel with law.\n\nWhen the president sign the language law, there should be name=Macedonian/Albanian, until then, this should be frozen.\n\nBecause in one country exist laws, laws are signed by the president of the Republic.\n\nPlease tell me, if one nation says that Macedonia is South Serbia, Macedonia is West Bulgaria, Macedonia is FYROM, Macedonia is Slavomacedonia, then we should add all of them in the name. Right?\n\nBut here I see doubled standards.\n\nIn Macedonia, there is quite obviously a large Albanian minority on the ground, so having the country name as bilingual makes sense. Place names would obviously make more sense in somewhere like Aračinovo/Haraçinë than in Dojran. The country’s finer constitutional details matter very little - the law project is cited as a proof that Albanian is an important language on the ground, which trumps the rest. You are right, entering every funny name other countries can come up with in the name tag makes no sense.\n\n(South Serbia would be a funny name and a good troll .)\n\nIn Kosovo, the local community has agreed to name places according to how many people who speak that language live there. See for example https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5830684024#map=19/42.89461/20.86551 for a Serbian-majority city with a sizeable Albanian minority. The latin script is used, both on the map and on the ground, except at christian orthodox sites where Cyrillic is preferred. Any changes to that consensus should be discussed with the local community and informed by information on the ground.\n\nPlease see also https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/w/images/d/d8/DisputedTerritoriesInformation.pdf\n\nIn any case, everyone in this thread needs to stop engaging in this dispute. Deliberately changing place names in ways that don’t match the reality on the ground to antagonise other mappers is not OK, and will result in a ban."
