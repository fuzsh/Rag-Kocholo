        "text": "Albania is a small, mountainous country in the Balkan peninsula, with a long Adriatic and Ionian coastline.\n\nAlong with neighbouring and mainly Albanian-inhabited Kosovo, it has a Muslim majority - a legacy of its centuries of Ottoman rule. About 17% of the population are Christians, divided mainly between the Orthodox and smaller Catholic denominations.\n\nAfter World War Two, Albania became a Stalinist state under Enver Hoxha, and remained staunchly isolationist until its transition to democracy after 1990.\n\nThe 1992 elections ended 47 years of communist rule, but the latter half of the decade saw a quick turnover of presidents and prime ministers.\n\nMany Albanians left the country in search of work; the money they send home remains an important source of revenue.\n\nEdi Rama became prime minister in September 2013, three months after elections in which his Socialist Party won a landslide victory that brought to an end eight years of conservative rule.\n\nHis party won a new mandate in elections in June 2017 and in April 2021.\n\nRama has pursued a neo-liberal economic policy, in terms of reducing public spending and promotes public-private partnerships.\n\nHe has argued that the European Union needs to accelerate the integration process of the Western Balkans, in order to prevent political fractures and violence that broke apart the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.\n\nRama has also denounced Russian influence as destabilising in the region.\n\nSome key dates in Albania's history:\n\n7th Century BC - Greek colonies established along the coast.\n\n167BC - Area conquered by Rome. Later become part of the Roman Empire.\n\n395AD - Roman Empire splits in to West and East, and Albania is incorporated into the Eastern Roman Empire - subsequently the Byzantine Empire.\n\nc.1190-1257 - Principality of Arbanon. First recorded Albanian state.\n\n1385 - Ottoman forces defeat local rulers at the Battle of Savra. Most local leaders become Ottoman vassals.\n\n1415-1431 - Albania is gradually incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.\n\n1444-68 - After Ottoman defeat in the Battle of Nis, during the Crusade of Varna, Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg unites Albania rulers in the League of LezhÃ« and leads a 25-year struggle against Turkish rule.\n\n18th-19th Centuries - Albanian Renaissance: flourishing of Albanian culture and society, coupled with rising nationalism and moves for independence.\n\n1912 - Albania declares independence from the Ottoman Empire.\n\n1925-28 - Albanian Republic\n\n1928 - Albania becomes a monarchy under Zog I.\n\n1939 - Shortly before the start of World War Two, Benito Mussolini's Italy invades and incorporates Albania into its fascist empire. King Zog flees to Greece.\n\n1940 - Italian army attacks Greece through Albania.\n\n1941 - Enver Hoxha becomes head of new Albanian Communist Party.\n\n1943 - German forces invade and occupy Albania following Italian surrender.\n\n1944 - Germans withdraw. Communist forces defeat nationalist rivals and Enver Hoxha is installed as Albania's new leader.\n\n1946 - Purges of non-communists from government positions.\n\n1948 - Albania breaks ties with Yugoslavia. Soviet Union begins economic aid to Albania.\n\n1950-52 - Britain and US back landings by right-wing guerrillas. However Kim Philby, a Soviet double agent working for British intelligence leaks details of the plan to Moscow, and the security breach claims the lives of about 300 infiltrators.\n\n1955 - Albania becomes a founding member of the Warsaw Pact.\n\n1961 - Albania allies itself with China, after Soviet Union breaks diplomatic relations over ideological rift.\n\n1967 - Violent clampdown on religious activity. Albania declared the world's first atheist state.\n\n1968 - Albania withdraws from Warsaw Pact over Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.\n\n1978 - China ends economic and military aid to Albania after relations become strained by China's reconciliation with the US.\n\n1985 - After ruling for nearly half a century, Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha dies. He is replaced by Ramiz Alia.\n\n1989 - Communist rule in Eastern Europe collapses.\n\n1990 - Independent political parties formed. Albanians granted right to travel abroad. Thousands try to flee through Western embassies.\n\nThousands more seize ships and sail illegally to Italy."
