        "text": "Before Rachel Berryman and a few other expats joined together to expand their yoga practices, yoga was practically unheard of in Albania. Now Rachel owns Tirana Yoga, one of the most successful yoga studios in the country. But she didn’t move to Albania to become a business owner; she first came with the Peace Corps.\n\nOn the Postcard Academy podcast, Rachel and I talk about the kind of work Rachel was doing and why she fell in love with Albania and its people. We also talk about the legacy of Albania’s Communist past, and, course, about her favorite places to eat and the experiences you must have in Tirana, Albania. Plus, you’ll learn about day trips to the best nearby beaches and more."
