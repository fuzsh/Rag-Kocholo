        "text": "From 1944 to 1991, the city experienced ordered development but with a decline in architectural quality. Massive socialist-style apartment complexes and factories began to be built, while Skanderbeg Square was redesigned, with a number of buildings being demolished. For instance, Tirana’s former Old Bazaar and the Orthodox Cathedral were razed to the ground for the erection of the Soviet-style Palace of Culture. The Italian-built municipal building was detonated and the National History Museum was constructed in its place, while the structure housing the Parliament of Albania during the period of monarchy was turned into a children’s theatre (Puppet Theatre today). The northern end of the main boulevard was renamed Stalin Boulevard and a statue of the Soviet leader erected in the city square. As private car ownership was banned, transport for the masses consisted mainly of bicycles, trucks and buses. After Hoxha’s death, a pyramidal mausoleum was constructed in his memory by the government. Now, it is known as the Pyramid, but has little to do with Enver Hoxha, having been turned in a cultural centre of Tirana.\n\nModern Tirana"
