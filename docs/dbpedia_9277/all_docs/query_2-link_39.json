You will be able to discover a city famous for the colourful facades of its buildings and the harmony between the various religions in the country.\n\nThe visit of the National Museum located on Skanderbeg Square will be a nice introduction to the rich Albanian history!\n\nClose to this square, we will be able to see the mosque “Et’hem Bey”, which has been preserved even during the communist era for its historical value, the opera, the clock tower and the palace of culture. We will then discover the superb Orthodox Cathedral as well as the Catholic Cathedral.\n\nYou will also see the pyramid (the Museum of the former dictator, Enver Hoxha) and, weather permitting, you will be able to take a walk in the park of the Artificial Lake of Tirana."
