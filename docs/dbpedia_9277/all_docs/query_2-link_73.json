        "text": "TIRANA. ALBANIA. Tirana, Albania’s capital, is a small, beautiful city which will surprise you with wonderful sights and places to visit. For a person who has never thought of visiting Tirana or Albania at all, I was surprised to see how much the city has to offer.\n\nTirana’s location gives a great opportunity for visitors to plan their trip ahead as well, as you can easily reach Rome by a ferryboat or the island of Corfu, one of the land borders of Albania. The weather in Tirana could be classified as temperate with a warm summer and cool winter.\n\nTirana is not one of the most popular tourist destinations, but that makes is all the more desirable. One of the most common places to visit in Tirana is the National History Museum, which is the largest museum in Albania and holds most of the country’s archaeological treasures, including a replica of Skanderbeg’s sword. The mosaic mural — Albania — on the museum’s facade is a showcase for Albanian pride dating back to World War II. All information is published in both English and Albanian, and it takes visitors on a chronological journey from ancient Illyria and on.\n\nAnother place worth visiting in Tirana is Skenderberg Square. As the heart of Tirana, it is a large vibrant area, and the perfect place to feel the pulse of the city. Head to the nearest cafe or restaurant there and order a coffee to enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nOne of the most famous restaurants is the Sky Bar, and it’s a great way to start your trip in Tirana. Food in Albania brings together elements of Greek and Turkish cuisines, as is the case in the popular dish Tabe Kosi, which contains both sheep and yogurt. Visit Sky Bar restaurant at to truly make the most of the view while enjoying your meal.\n\nAfter finishing your meal, head to Boulevard Deshmoret e Kombit – one of Tirana’s great boulevards built by Italians. Boulevard Deshmoret e Kombit leads up to Italy Square, where the views won’t disappoint, and where you can see a statue of Mother Theresa.\n\nWhile in Tirana, pass by the Albanian Parliament, and visit the National Art Gallery, which combines a brief history of Albanian paintings spanning from the early 19th Century to the present day. While the collection of art upstairs is more political, downstairs at the gallery, there is a small collection of 19th Century paintings of daily Albanian life.\n\nOnce you are finished visiting the cultural sites, give way to some fun and relaxation. Take advantage of Tirana’s cable cars rides, explore the city by bike, visit the Grand Park, Parku i Madh, and pay a visit to the largest stadium in Albania, Qemal Stafa.\n\nCulturally, Tirana is different than many other well-known cities. Because of its predominantly Muslim religion, many people do not drink alcohol, but that only adds to the calm of the city. More so, common gestures in Albania are different than what many are used to. In Albania, people take a nod for “no,” and a shake of the head for “yes.”\n\nHead to Albania’s capital city to explore the unique culture and beauty. Tirana may be small, but the amount of sites to see and things to do are endless."
