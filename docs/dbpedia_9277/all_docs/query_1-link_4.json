        "text": "Tirana is the capital of Albania, a country in southeastern Europe. It lies on the Ishm River. It is Albania’s largest city. In Albanian it is spelled Tiranë.\n\nTirana is Albania’s main center of business and industry. However, in the early 21st century the country’s economy was one of the poorest in Europe. Factories in Tirana make clothing, processed foods, leather, and other products.\n\nA Turkish general founded Tirana in the early 1600s. Albania was then part of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. Tirana gradually grew into a busy trading center.\n\nAlbania became an independent country in 1912. Tirana became its capital in 1920. Between 1939 and 1944, during World War II, Italian and then German forces controlled the city.\n\nAlbania became a Communist country in 1946. Protests in Tirana helped to end Communist rule in the country in 1990. In the late 1990s the city was the site of several violent political protests. Population (2011 census), 418,495."
