        "text": "The beautiful city of Durrës carries much history and Christian heritage. The geographical position of Durrës makes this almost inevitable.\n\nThere is evidence as early as 58 AD of Christian families in Durrës.\n\nDurrës is the second largest city of Albania, located on the central Albanian coast, 33 km(21mi) west of the capital Tirana. This location makes Durres one of the main physical and spiritual gates of Albania.\n\nThe city was named in Greek as Epidamnos and Dyrrhachion, or in Latin, Epitamnus and Dyrrachium. The word “Dyrrachion” is roughly translated from Greek to “roaring waves.”\n\nIn 1967, Durrës was the place from where Albania was officially declared an atheist nation, becoming the first nation in the world to declare, “We do not believe in God.”\n\nCurrently, there are several Christian churches and organizations operating in Durrës.\n\nYWAM Albania is one of them.\n\n“This is what the Lord says: “In the time of my favor I will answer you, and in the day of salvation I will help you; I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land and to reassign its desolate inheritances, to say to the captives, ‘Come out, and to those in darkness, ‘Be free!” Isaiah 49:8\n\nBecause of its history, its Christian inheritance and geographical position, and word God has spoken to us, we believe Durrës is a prophetic voice for Albania and the world. It is a city called into missions, chosen to “restore the land and reassign its desolated inheritances, to raise up the age-old foundations” in Albania and beyond."
