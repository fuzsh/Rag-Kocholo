        "text": "1. Feel the Albanian hospitality\n\nBeing invited for a coffee or a rakija (a plum brandy) is a local custom and you’ll find Albanians friendly towards foreign visitors. Having been isolated from the rest of the world for the latter half of the twentieth century, many are curious about the influx of travellers.\n\nAlbania is not the most obvious destination for travel. Find out things you didn't know you could do in Albania and make sure this country is a must-visit.\n\n2. See the local colour\n\nAs it’s a small city, you can easily cover Tirana's central area in a day. But as well as a leisurely exploration of the handful of museums, monuments, historic buildings and parks, make some time to marvel at the city's concrete housing estates. Yes, really. Painted in rainbow colours, they add brightness to what was once a rather monochrome cityscape.\n\nApart from visiting Tirana, discover some of the best travel experiences in Albania.\n\n3. Enjoy the café and food culture\n\nAlbania might not be famed for its cuisine, but that’s no reason not to make food a focus. Look out for the excellent coffee and beer (Islam is the predominant religion but it is practised in a very tolerant way), as well as decent pastries and good gelato.\n\nCafés are the perfect place for people-watching — set to a soundtrack of Albanian and Euro pop. If you want to make sure that you get a chance to try all the tasty traditional food that Tirana has to offer, make sure to book one of the food tours, so you don't miss a thing.\n\n4. Take a history lesson in Skanderbeg Square\n\nVisiting Skanderbeg Square, named after the national hero who briefly ensured Albania was independent of the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century, is undoubtedly one of the things to do in Tirana.\n\nThere is a large bronze statue of Skanderbeg on horseback (imagine Alexander The Great meets Thor) in the middle of the square, and the Et'hem Bey Mosque, one of the nation's most treasured buildings that dates back to the late eighteenth century, sits in the southeast corner. Also situated here are the nation's major museums, including The National Historic Museum adorned with a huge socialist mural of victorious partisans.\n\n9. Visit Mount Dajti National Park\n\nIf you are wondering what to do in Tirana away from the city centre, head to Mount Dajti National Park, popular with Tirana's residents for fresh air and countryside walks. You can either take an Austrian-built cable car (expensive) or the city bus (cheap) and once there you’ll find hotels, guest-houses and restaurants if you feel like staying overnight.\n\n10. Take a day-trip to the seaside\n\nAmong best things to do in Tirana outside the city is visiting the historic city of Durrësi on the Adriatic Sea. These days it’s largely Kosovar tourists who make use of the plentiful cheap hotels and restaurants along the seafront. Things are rough and ready, but Durrësi is lively, inexpensive and easily accessible.\n\n11. Enjoy the view of the Et’hem Bey Mosque\n\nThe Et'hem Bey Mosque is one of the few mosques to have escaped destruction by the Communists, which had resulted in any kind of religious institution being either closed, demolished or converted into warehouses or schools by the end of 1967.\n\nDespite resistance from the communist authorities, around 10,000 people entered the mosque on 18 January 1991. This event was one of the important milestones in the revival of religious freedom and the fall of communism in the country.\n\nToday, visitors can enjoy the mosque's beautiful architecture and its delicate decorations of wall and ceiling paintings in the oriental traditions. The mosque's frescoes depict trees, waterfalls and bridges, and still lifes, which are rare in the Islamic arts.\n\n12. Climb to the top of the Clock tower\n\nThe clock tower is a symbol of the municipality of Tirana and, in an ensemble with the Et'hem Bey Mosque, is a unique architectural landmark.\n\nThe Clock tower was built by the same man who built the Et'hem Bey Mosque. It is a cultural monument that shows the time in Tirana since 1822. You have a great chance to see the main square of Tirana and beyond it by climbing the steps and reaching the top of the tower.\n\n13. Walk through Bunk’Art\n\nBunk’Art is a massive bunker built by the communist dictator is now a museum. It was built on the orders of Enver Halil Hoxha, the dictator who ruled Albania for some 50 years, as a hideout in the event of war.\n\nToday the bunker is open to visitors and is a monument to Albania's communist past. A walk through the bunker's dark, spooky corridors is one of the best things you can do in Tirana.\n\n14. Pay tribute to history in the House of Leaves Museum\n\nOne of the most unusual museums in Albania, the House of Leaves is the look-alike equivalent of the Stasi headquarters in the former East Germany. Visiting this landmark should be on your list of things to do in Tirana.\n\nOnce inside the headquarters of the infamous National Intelligence Service, also known as the House of Spies, there's a good chance you'll be speechless. Inside the House of Leaves you will learn the monstrous side of the dictatorial regime in Albania and the stories of the persecuted people who were not afraid to speak out against the regime.\n\n15. Get some fresh produce in New bazaar (Pazari i Ri)\n\nNew bazaar is one of the most historic and oldest neighbourhoods in the Albanian capital, which takes its name from the food market that is located in the area.\n\nHere you'll find a huge variety of fresh fruit, vegetables, meats, seafood and spices, and the farmers of the New Bazaar will not only help you find the best products but also tell you about the history of this bustling market.\n\n16. Taking a walking tour - one of the best things to do in Tirana\n\nOne of the best things about Tiara is its compactness, which makes it a great place to walk around. However, although it's not the biggest city, there are plenty of places to walk around:\n\nSkanderbeg Square\n\nNational History Museum\n\nSkanderbeg Monument\n\nEt'hem Bey Mosque\n\nClock Tower of Tirana\n\nBunkArt 2\n\nMurat Toptani Road\n\nTirana Castle\n\nYou can also book a guided walking tour around Tirana and make sure you don't miss anything."
