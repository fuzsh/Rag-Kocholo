        "text": "This attractive city is booming and is specially designed for curious tourists who want to experience its life and its peculiarities. Tirana offers a completely different spirit than the surrounding countryside.\n\nTirana, the capital of a small country and also one of the most beautiful European cities, is a very interesting place to visit, rich in references, monuments, historical and cultural sites.\n\nSpeaking of history, Tirana is in the middle of the country, the largest city and at the same time the largest economic, administrative, political, social and cultural center of Albania.\n\nCertainly is one of the most vibrant metropolises in Eastern Europe. It has a very high population nowadays. The Albanian capital, with a mild climate, offers many opportunities for its visitors in every season.\n\nThe architecture of this city carries in itself aspects of all periods: from the Illyrian to the modern time.\n\nDo you know what you should see in Tirana?\n\nSkanderbeg Square\n\nLet’s start with Skanderbeg Square, in the center of the capital. With a stroll around this square, you can see the ‘Palace of Culture’, the ‘Skanderbeg Monument’, the ‘Bank of Albania’ and the ‘National History Museum’.\n\nClock Tower\n\nTo the left of Scanderbeg Square is the ‘Clock Tower’, built-in 1822 by Haji Et’hem Bey, the same person who built the Mosque next to it. This is considered the most beautiful mosque in Tirana and dates back to 1789.\n\nSpecial attention is paid to the interior and exterior decorations of the mosque, which portray the natural elements: waterfalls, trees, etc.\n\nIf we keep going straight, we will reach the pedestrian street “Murat Toptani” where ‘Tirana Fortress’, ‘National Theater’, ‘National Gallery of Arts’ and the artistic structure named “Reja” are located.\n\nBunk’art\n\nThe Bunk’art is also one of the most important attractions in Tirana, dedicated to the victims of the communist regime and the rooms of an old, cold bunker have been refurbished.\n\nDajti Mountain National Park\n\nIt was a secret until recent years and now it’s considered a museum of contemporary art. Make sure not to leave without visiting Dajti Mountain National Park. It is the perfect combination of monuments with nature.\n\nIn its southeastern area is located one of the largest and important parks in Tirana. ‘Dajti Mountain National Park’, one of the greenest areas frequented by residents and tourists.\n\nThe park is also known as the “natural balcony of Tirana” and offers a different day in the capital.\n\nYou can also admire rich vegetation: dense pine forests, oaks, beeches, and up to the tall maple trees along the Dajti River.\n\nTirana artificial lake park\n\nTirana artificial lake park named “Liqeni” is also a place visited by everyone, young and old people, for the fact that it is easily accessible on foot. The lakefront park is one of the perfect destinations to escape the city noise. Tirana’s citizens come here in the afternoons for hiking or running, but also for a coffee or a chat with friends.\n\nIn addition to hiking and jogging, you can also take a personal or family bike and enjoy a lap around the lake. Children can also play in the toy park. For younger ages, there are more activities organized such as concerts, karaoke, barbecues, outdoor cinema, etc.\n\nIn the middle of the park is a church, as well as an amphitheater where folk music or traditional dances are played especially during the summer days.\n\nThe area has good restaurants where one can enjoy traditional Albanian and Mediterranean food."
