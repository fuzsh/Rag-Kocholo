        "text": "Visiting Tirana in two days: what to see and do\n\nSkanderbeg Square, the historic heart of Tirana\n\nAny stay in Tirana begins in Skanderbeg Square (Sheshi Skënderbej), a vast esplanade dedicated to the national hero who led the revolt against the Ottomans in the 15th century. The best-known buildings on the square include the National History Museum, the largest in Albania, flanked by a spectacular Socialist Realist mosaic. Nearby, new sites of historical interest, such as the Museum of Secret Surveillance (or the House of Leaves) in the former headquarters of the Sigurimi, the formidable political police, are more particularly interested in the former Communist regime, which fell in 1991.\n\nNational History Museum\n\nSheshi Skënderbej 7\n\nTirana 1001\n\n+355 42 22 39 77\n\nwww.mhk.gov.al\n\nMuseum of Secret Surveillance (House of Leaves)\n\nRruga Dëshmorët e 4 Shkurtit\n\nTirana 1001\n\n+355 42 22 26 12\n\nmuzeugjethi.gov.al\n\nThe Pyramid of Tirana, an iconic city monument\n\nLocated right in the city centre and opened in 1988, the Piramida was initially set to serve as a mausoleum for the dictator Enver Hoxha (1908-1985) but, however, has never contained his remains. After the fall of Communism, the building was left derelict before being renovated and converted into an information technology centre in 2002.\n\nBulevardi Dëshmorët e Kombit\n\nTirana 1001\n\nwww.visit-tirana.com\n\nParku i Madh, Tirana’s green space\n\nAlthough it is increasingly being taken over by concrete and towers, Parku i Madh (“Grand Park”) is the perfect spot for an impromptu picnic or a welcome break. Featuring a 55-hectare artificial lake, it allows you to cool down at the water’s edge, take a boat trip and even pray in an orthodox chapel. You can also visit a German memorial and a British cemetery from the Second World War there.\n\nRruga Herman Gmeiner\n\nTirana 1000\n\naprtirana.al\n\nBlloku, from the nomenklatura to a hip neighbourhood\n\nLocated between Dëshmorët e Kombit Boulevard (dubbed the “Champs-Élysées” ) and Sami Frashëri Street, Blloku was reserved for the Communist elite and forbidden to most Albanians between 1961 and 1991. Today, it is Tirana’s most vibrant district, popular with the local bright young things and tourists. In the centre of the district is found dictator Enver Hoxha’s former residence, Vila 31 (closed to the public). Behind the austere residence, you discover Pjetër Bogdani and Brigada e VIII Streets, the liveliest in the city.\n\nVila 31\n\nRruga Thoma Kacorri 2\n\nTirana 1019\n\nAnd if you’re staying in Tirana for three days?\n\nDepending on your tastes, you could:\n\nGo to see a contemporary art exhibition in an unusual place, Bunk’Art, a museum set up in a former underground shelter.\n\nClimb up the slopes of Mount Dajti on the Dajti Ekspres, the cable car situated on the exit to the city.\n\nGo shopping in Kruja. This citadel outside of Tirana is home to interesting artisans.\n\nBunk’Art\n\nRruga Fadil Deliu\n\nTirana 1001\n\n+355 67 20 72 905\n\nbunkart.al\n\nDajti Ekspres\n\nRruga Mahmut Allushi 56\n\nTirana 1004\n\n+355 67 40 11 035\n\ndajtiekspres.com\n\nThe best places to eat in Tirana\n\nIn the city streets\n\nCheap, typical and unmissable, the famous byrek can be enjoyed at any time in the streets of Tirana. Simply look out for the signs stating tëçastit (“freshly cooked”). This filo pastry stuffed with meat, cheese or spinach is the perfect embodiment of Albanian street food.\n\nMullixhiu\n\nRegularly ranked as one of the best restaurants in Tirana, this establishment offers a tasting menu that is a delicious overview of Albanian fine food. A warm and friendly address at reasonable prices!\n\nShëtitorja Lasgush Poradeci\n\nTirana 1019\n\n+355 69 66 60 444\n\nwww.mullixhiu.al\n\nBujtina e Gjelit\n\nTwo kilometres north-east of Skanderbeg Square, this inn is hidden in a magnificent hotel with a swimming pool. Here, almost all the ingredients come from the family farm at the foot of Mount Dajti. Local and tasty!\n\nRruga Don Bosko 15\n\nTirana 1000\n\n+355 42 40 58 55\n\nwww.facebook.com\n\nA favourite place to stay in Tirana\n\nHotel Kotoni\n\nHere’s a charming hotel run by a French speaker. Understated and elegant, it is above all ideally located in Blloku, near Skanderbeg Square and the Pyramid of Tirana."
