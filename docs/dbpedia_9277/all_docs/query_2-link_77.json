        "text": "Tirana is Albania’s charming, lively, colorful and vibrant capital city of nearly 1 million. Any city that offers diversity, fascinating history, friendly locals, cafe culture, nightlife and hip bars will easily keep you interested and engaged, and Tirana has all this and more.\n\nI really love Tirana. There’s so much to do and see in the city during the day and night and it’s still very much off the beaten path.\n\nThe hospitality received as a tourist will leave a lasting impression on your experience in Tirana, and the rest of Albania as well. The Albanian people completely captured my heart. I visited Tirana, and Albania, twice in less than a year and I very rarely visit the same place twice, so that speaks volumes. Some people say there’s nothing to see in Tirana, so not everyone will love it, but I think they’re not fully opening their eyes and ears.\n\nTirana’s city centre is very compact, so you can walk just about everywhere and explore the city with ease. Tirana also has a bike share program, like most major European cities. I felt very safe in Tirana, even when walking alone at night, as a female.\n\nTOP THINGS TO SEE AND DO IN TIRANA\n\nEXPLORE SKANDERBEG SQUARE\n\nThis is a great place to start your exploration of Tirana because it’s the centre of the city and a lot of keys sights are in and around the area. Skanderbeg Square is named after the national hero who led the rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century.\n\nGO ON A FREE WALKING TOUR AND LEARN ABOUT ALBANIA’S HISTORY\n\nAlbania’s history is INSANE and therefore an absolute must (more on that below). I find history can be a little dry at times, but Albania’s history in the last half of the 20th century is incredibly captivating. I didn’t know much detail about Albania’s history before I went to Albania, but I went on a walking tour on my first day in Tirana (and Albania) and learned all the key information.\n\nMy walking tour guide was the best because he was a teenager during the 1980s, which means he lived through some of the craziest times in Albania and then experienced all the changes in the country after communism fell. He said they didn’t have cars, bananas or jeans (and much, much more) until the 1990s, after the fall of communism. His stories were extremely captivating and completely blew my mind. However, when I returned to Tirana 9 months later and went on the walking tour again with a different guide, it wasn’t quite as captivating, so it really depends on who your guide is.\n\nOn the walking tour, you also visit a number of Tirana’s main attractions such as Skanderbeg Square, Ethem Bej Mosque, the Clock Tower, the Pyramid of Tirana, Post Blloku, the Blloku, etc. The walking tours start at 10am and 6pm everyday in front of the opera house. A tip is expected and deserved.\n\nVISIT THE NATIONAL HISTORY MUSEUM\n\nThis is a great place to learn more about Albania’s history. Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot of English, but it’s still very much worthwhile. Located in Skanderbeg Square. 200L (€1.60).\n\nVISIT POSTBLLOK AND SEE A PIECE OF THE BERLIN WALL\n\nAs well as a bunker and concrete pillars of a notorious labour camp (Spaç, which is often compared to Auschwitz), which all commemorate the victims of Enver Hoxha’s Communist regime. The memorial is placed at the entrance of the former off-limits neighbourhood of the Blloku, where Enver Hoxha and his Communist elite friends used to reside. The 2.6 ton slab of the Berlin wall was a gift from the city of Berlin and it’s a reminder to never do the whole Communist thing again. Furthermore, the bunker is symbolic of the 700,000+ bunkers that were built all over Albania during Enver Hoxha’s 45-year-long communist regime, due to his severe paranoia of foreign invasion. This works out to be 1 bunker for every 4 people. Free.\n\nHANG OUT, EAT, DRINK AND PARTY IN THE TRENDY BLLOKU\n\nDuring communist times, “The Block” was a gated and heavily patrolled area of Tirana where Enver Hoxha and his communist elite friends lived the high life behind closed doors, while everyone else lived in extreme poverty on the outside. Now, the Blloku is the most trendy district in the city and it’s where Tirana comes to eat, drink, shop and party. It has the best restaurants, boutiques, cafes, bars and a vibrant nightlife. It is the most expensive area of Tirana, so it still holds a level of exclusivity.\n\nENJOY THE CAFE CULTURE\n\nTirana’s cafe culture is strong. Enjoying a coffee (or another beverage of your choice) is a great way to relax and enjoy a slower pace of life, build and maintain relationships, and observe life around you. And as a traveler, it’s also great to catch up in your journal, do wi-fi things and to watch the world go by. The Blloku has the best cafes. See below for recommendations.\n\nEXPLORE AND LEARN AT BUNK’ART 1\n\nThis is an absolute must-see in Tirana. This enormous underground bunker, with over 100 rooms on 5 levels, was built for Hoxha and his government officials in the event of foreign invasion and it has been converted into a one of the most interesting and authentic museums and art exhibitions in the world. Everything is in English and Albanian. It’s near Mount Datji, so people often combine the two in one trip. Take a bicycle, bus or taxi to get there. Entrance is 500L (€4).\n\nHIKE OR TAKE A CABLE CAR UP MOUNT DATJI\n\nEscape the city and enjoy the nature in this national park on the mountain on the outskirts of the city. It’s a 15 minute cable car ride to the top, at 1613m, where you can enjoy the view, explore, hike, see the sunset and enjoy the restaurant with a view. The entrance to Mount Datji is near Bunk’Art 1, so it’s popular to combine the two. Take a bicycle, bus or taxi to get there. One way 500L (€4), return 800L (€6.50).\n\nVISIT THE HOUSE OF LEAVES – THE MUSEUM OF SECRET SURVEILLANCE\n\nThe newest museum in Tirana is considered to be the equivalent of the Stasi (secret police) headquarters of former East Germany. During World War II, while Albania was under German occupation, the building was used by the Gestapo; however, after the war, the Albanian secret police took it over so they could spy on Albanians during the communist times and convict them of political crimes. 700L (€5.70)\n\nSTROLL AROUND THE GRAND PARK OF TIRANA\n\nAnd the man-made lake and war memorial to enjoy the peacefulness of the green space. Near the Blloku.\n\nTHE BLLOKU – You’re spoiled for choice with fun, hip cafes and restaurants in this area. The cafe culture is strong here.\n\nMON CHERI – Another popular cafe chain in Tirana offering coffee, tea, sandwiches and desserts.\n\nBARS AND CAFES\n\nThe hip bars in Tirana have a lot of character and charm. Many places in Tirana double as a chill, quiet place to have a morning or afternoon coffee and then a lively place to enjoy cocktails later at night. The only issue is that the bars can get incredibly smokey from all the cigarettes, but hopefully this will change in the next few years. Albania practices a patriarchal society, so you’ll notice more men than women in the streets, cafes and bars, especially at night. There are even some cafes and bars for men only.\n\nTHE BLLOKU is the most trendy and vibrant district in the city and it’s where Tirana comes to eat, drink, shop and party. It has the best restaurants, boutiques, cafes, bars and a vibrant nightlife. You’re spoiled for choice with fun, hip bars and cafes in the Blloku.\n\nCOLONIAL CAFE – This is the best cocktail bar in Tirana and one of the best cocktail bars in Europe. They boast an impressively extensive liquor collection, as well as very creative and innovative cocktails. The owner and manager are very friendly and social and they will help you pick a cocktail you’ll like, or they’ll create one for you.\n\nROOFTOP XVI – For a party with a view of Tirana.\n\nDAY TRIPS\n\nKRUJË (OR KRUJA) – This important historical town is also known as the city of Skanderbeg, who is Albania’s national hero because he led the rebellion against the Ottoman Empire here in the 15th century. You can visit Krujë Castle on the mountain and enjoy the view; explore Skanderbeg Museum inside the castle; visit the Ethnographic Museum; and explore the Old Bazaar where you’ll find souvenirs and authentic antiques at extremely low prices. 45 minutes by bus from Tirana 100L (€0.80).\n\nDURRËS – This is a great place to enjoy the coast, at only 45 minutes from Tirana. Many people go to Durrës, Albania’s second largest city, for the beaches and for some of the best nightlife in the country. But the city also offers some great history with its Byzantine city walls, Venetian Tower and ancient Roman Amphitheatre, which is the largest in the Balkans and once had a capacity for 20,000 people. But because of its proximity to Tirana and the ease of a day trip, the beaches can get very busy, especially on weekends and in high season (July-August). The best beaches are further south on the Albanian Riviera. Durrës has one of biggest ports on the Adriatic, where you can take a ferry to Italy. 45 minute bus from Tirana 130L (€1) .\n\nGET IN AND OUT\n\nTirana has the only international airport in Albania.\n\nAlbania does not have any trains.\n\nBERAT – 3 hour bus. 400L (€3)\n\nSTRUGA (LAKE OHRID) – 4 hour bus. 1750L (€14)\n\nPRISTINA – 4 hour bus. 1400L (€11)"
