        "text": "Albania is a beautiful country bordered by the Adriatic and Ionian seas. This jewel of the Balkans, still little known as a tourist destination, offers many natural and cultural jewels, and its sunny coast benefits from the Mediterranean heat. Marked by the passage of many ancient civilizations - Illyrians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans - that left many archaeological legacies behind, Albania shows a great architectural variety reflected in its capital Tirana as well as in historic towns such as Berat, Krujë or even Gjirokastër.\n\nShkodra\n\nShkodra, located near Lake Skadar, is one of the largest cities in Albania and one of the oldest in Europe. The former capital of Illyria looks back on over 2,000 years of history. Shkodra is surrounded by three rivers and is a cultural and economic hotspot. The castle-citadel of Rozafa is internationally known and a visit is highly recommended!\n\nKrujë\n\nThis pretty medieval town, nestled close to the cliffs, is also known as the \"balcony of the Adriatic\". Krujë is the hometown of the national hero Skanderbeg, who made it the capital city during his reign in the 15th century. The town is home to the Skanderberg Museum (located in the castle) as well as an ethnographic museum.\n\nDurrës\n\nDurrës is a charming coastal town with beautiful beaches. It is only 39 km from Tirana and combines two advantages that make it a tourist highlight: coastal location on the Adriatic Sea and historical richness. More than 3000 years old, it is full of historical structures such as the Roman amphitheater. Also, Durrës is one of Albania's largest ports.\n\nGjirokastër\n\nThe old town of Gjirokastër is a Unesco World Heritage Site and is characterized by its turreted houses rising on a hill. In Turkish they are called \"kules\". The city is home to an ethnographic museum that sheds light on the life of Albanians in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBerat\n\nDiscover this beautiful city that stretches on both sides of the Osum River and is a Unesco World Heritage Site. It is called the \"City of the 1000 windows\" because the facades of the typical white stone houses are peppered with innumerable windows.\n\nButrint\n\nSituated in southern Albania, the archaeological site of Butrint was in turn Greek and Roman before experiencing its golden age under the administration of Byzantium. A Unesco-listed site, Butrint boasts a series of historic monuments representing each of these eras, all set in a lush natural setting. You can admire the theatre and the Greek-Roman ruins in particular.\n\nThe Albanian riviera\n\nThe Albanian Riviera stretches for 100 km between Vlore and Saranda. The natural coast is lapped by turquoise water and creates space for wonderful beaches. Visit one of the hidden bays beneath the unique coastal road!\n\nApollonia\n\nThe ancient city was founded around 600 BC by the Greeks and is the largest archaeological excavation site in Albania. There are a lot of well-preserved historical relics of Greek and Roman origins to discover!\n\nTirana\n\nTirana, the capital of Albania, offers a unique blend of historical significance and modern flair. The historic heart of the city is centred around the central Skanderbeg Square, named after the national hero, surrounded by museums that provide insights into the country's complex history. Towering above the city is Dajti Mountain, accessible by cable car, which offers a spectacular view over the ever-changing metropolis. In recent years, Tirana has developed into a dynamic centre known for its lively nightlife and cultural diversity, especially in the famous Blloku district."
