        "text": "1. There is no modern language similar to the Albanian language\n\nThe Albanian language occupies its own branch on the Indo-European language family tree and is not close to any other modern languages. Though its exact origins are not known, Albanian is believed to be a developed form of the Illyrian language, which was spoken by the Illyrians, people who occupied the Baltic region until around the 6th century.\n\nAlbanian, the official language, is considered to be a very difficult language to learn due to its lack of relation to other languages. Thanks to the population of Albania and the sizable Albanian diaspora, the Albanian language is spoken by around 7.5 million people worldwide.\n\n2. Albanian culture has a unique superstition surrounding scarecrows\n\nOne of the most interesting facts about Albania is that it has a very unique way of using scarecrows! These can be seen surprisingly often around the country and can take numerous forms, from mutilated toys to devil-like statues or figures that we would more commonly recognize as scarecrows.\n\nCalled dordolecs, these features are placed at building sites, rather than in the fields. They’re not designed to scare crows away, either. Albanians believe that these dordolecs, placed while a property is being constructed, will keep the jealousy of neighbors at bay and function as a good luck charm.\n\n3. There are thousands of bunkers in Albania\n\nAlbania has tens of thousands of bunkers throughout the country. Initially constructed during the rule of dictator Enver Hoxha to offer shelter in the event of an invasion, these bunkers are perhaps an unusual sight for foreign visitors. These concrete structures were never used as intended but still feature prominently across the nation, some of which have been transformed into unique art galleries, hip hostels, and trendy restaurants.\n\n4. The country has 4 UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\nDue to its location and extensive history, Albania is rich in historical treasures.\n\nThe ancient city of Butrint: This city has seen many civilizations, with human habitation dating back to 50,000 BC. It was once a Greek colony, later a Roman city, then under Byzantine control, and finally the Venetians. The site contains ruins from different eras, making it one of Albania’s key archaeological sites. Thanks to this rich heritage, there are ruins from different civilizations through time, making it one of Albania’s most important archaeological sites.\n\nThe historic centers of Berat and Gjirokastra: These towns showcase unique Ottoman architecture. Berat Castle, mostly built in the 13th century, has origins dating back to the 4th century BC. Gjirokastra features stunning 17th-century two-story buildings. Berat is known as the “town of a thousand windows” due to its many Ottoman empire era houses on the hillside.\n\nAncient and primeval beech forests of the Carpathians and other regions of Europe: Shared with 17 other countries, this site is notable for the adaptable European beech tree. In Albania, you can see these primeval beech forests in Lumi i Gashit in the Albanian Alps.\n\nNatural and cultural heritage of the Ohrid region: Shared with North Macedonia, Ohrid Lake is Europe’s oldest lake, home to flora and fauna from the Tertiary period. The Lin Peninsula by the lake has remains of a 6th-century early Christian church.\n\n5. Nod for no, shake your head for yes\n\nThe common form of indicating ‘yes’ or ‘no’ works in the completely opposite way in Albania and can cause some significant misunderstandings for foreign visitors. Albanians shake their heads when they want to say yes and nod their heads when they want to say no. If you’re planning a trip to Albania, it would be a good idea to keep this in mind!\n\nAnother possibly confusing cultural norm in Albania is for hair stylists to slap you on the back of the neck after you’ve had a haircut. Stylists will often say “me shëndet” as they do it. This translates to “with health” and is a good thing!\n\n6. Going for an evening walk is part of the culture in Albania\n\nOne of Albania’s pastimes is xhiro, literally “walk.” Though this seems like nothing unique, it is part of the culture to go for a walk in the evenings. This offers people the opportunity to catch up with their friends, family and neighbors, and enjoy the slightly cooler evening weather.\n\n7. Albania was named the first atheist country in the world in 1967\n\nOwing to the Communist regime led by dictator Enver Hoxha, religion was banned in 1967, and Hoxha declared Albania to be the first atheist country in the world. As part of this ban, the military seized religious buildings, destroying them or turning them into businesses.\n\nFortunately, this ban did not last forever. Today, Albania is known for its religious tolerance, even receiving praise from Pope Francis during his visit to the country in 2014.\n\n8. Albania had the only muslim king in modern European history\n\nKing Zog I ruled Albania stands out as the only Albanian king and only European king who adhered to the Muslim faith. His reign was distinctive in other ways as well; he first served as Prime Minister and then as President before declaring Albania a kingdom and crowning himself King. Zog I was not only the first and only king of Albania to follow Islam, but was also the last king of Albania, leading the country from 1928 until 1939. His reign ended when Italy invaded Albania, forcing him into exile.\n\n9. Albania is a leader in renewable energy\n\nAlmost 97% of Albania’s energy is produced by hydropower plants, making this country incredibly eco-friendly.\n\n10. Tirana is a city of color\n\nTirana, the capital of Albania, is renowned for its vibrant and colorful character. Established as the capital in 1920, Tirana was influenced by Italian architects during the reign of King Zog I. In the early 2000s, Tirana underwent a dramatic transformation under the leadership of artist turned mayor, Edi Rama. Rama’s vision brought bright, bold colors and abstract shapes to the city’s facades, turning many buildings into art galleries.\n\nAdding to its cultural vibrancy, Tirana launched the Tirana International Film Festival (TIFF) in 2003, marking Albania’s first international film festival. TIFF has become a prestigious event where the winner of the “Golden Owl” award for Best Feature Film is celebrated and becomes eligible for the Academy Awards. This festival further enhances the city’s reputation as a hub of creativity and cultural expression.\n\n11. Cars were a luxury reserved for the elite until the 1990s\n\nUntil the 1990s, cars in Albania were a luxury reserved exclusively for the elite. Under communist rule, the government prohibited private car ownership for the general population, allowing only the ruling elite to possess vehicles. By the end of the communist era, Albania had a population of approximately 3 million people, yet there were only about 5,000 cars in the entire country. The impact persists today as Albanians love fireflies more than cars; Albania has the second lowest rate of car ownership in Europe.\n\n12. The two-headed Albanian eagle has a rich history\n\nThe two headed Albanian eagle as symbol of Albania first appeared in 1190 on a stone carving. Today, it is prominently featured on the Albanian flag, which is among the oldest national flags still in use.\n\nThe eagle was first officially displayed on the flag in 1443 by Albania’s national hero, Skanderbeg, who led a successful rebellion against the Ottoman Turks during the final days of the Byzantine Empire. This historical image symbolizes Albania’s spirit and serves as a reminder of the fight against Ottoman rule.\n\n13. The Albanian diaspora is large. Albanians living abroad might outnumber Albanians in country\n\nDespite Albania’s attractive features, many Albanians live abroad. Estimates of the Albanian diaspora range from 1.7 million to as high as 8.5 million. If the higher estimates are accurate, this means more Albanians live outside their home country than within it, as Albania’s population is just 2.8 million.\n\nAmong the notable figures in the Albanian diaspora is Mother Teresa. Although she spent much of her life in India, she was of Albanian descent and is celebrated in Albania. Her legacy is honored with statues throughout the country and with Mother Teresa Square in the capital city of Tirana."
