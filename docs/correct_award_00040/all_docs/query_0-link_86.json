        "text": "The collection consists of eight series. The attempt has been made to maintain the original order as much as possible, and particularly in the correspondence and scientific data series. Much of the material, however, was transmitted and accessioned in small portions in the years 1963-1966, and in some cases items were placed on display in the Library before being arranged in series. The microfilming, moreover, was carried out before the final arrangement and analysis of the collection could be made; somewhat premature filming decisions have, therefore, affected the final arrangement that is presented here and some items are missing or poorly described on the film.\n\nMuch of this collection was assembled by Louise H. Marshall, formerly of Washington University and later of the University of California, Los Angeles. Mrs. Marshall used materials related to Dr. Bishop that she had personally collected, as well as items supplied by her husband, Wade Marshall, and by Dr. Bishop’s brother, Frederick Bishop. All of these materials were placed together with items that had been kept in the Department of Neurology after Dr. Bishop’s death. Included in the collection are correspondence, manuscripts, notes, diagrams, and various ephemera. All photographs and many of the drawings in this collection were separated from the written documents and placed in a visual collection (VC034). The resulting arrangement reflects the mixed provenance and the many hands that have contributed to the collection. It is important to underscore that although Dr. Bishop himself never saw these collections as bibliographic entities, they were assembled in good faith that the effort would help to preserve the memory of this important scientist.\n\nThis small collection comprises a number of Dr. Berg’s notebooks. They include his typed and handwritten notes on topics such as anatomy, bacteriology, chemistry, and pharmacology. Of particular note is the “Guide to the Study of Neurology” (Box 2, Folder 4) which was produced by the WUSM Department of Anatomy, but includes notes and drawings added by Berg.\n\nGilson discusses the research and activities of the Department of Physiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in the 1920s and 1930s and several of his colleagues, such as Joseph Erlanger, Herbert Gasser, and George Bishop. He also talks of the axonologists, a discussion group first formed in 1930 at an American Physiological Society meeting.\n\nArthur Gilson discusses the research and activities of the Department of Physiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in the 1920s and 1930s and several of his colleagues, such as Joseph Erlanger, Herbert Gasser, and George Bishop.
