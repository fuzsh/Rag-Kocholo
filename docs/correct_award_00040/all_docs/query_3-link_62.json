Please read it to the end.\n\nA short time ago, Iran’s Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged the Muslim World to boycott anything and everything that originates with the Jewish people.\n\nIn response, Meyer M. Treinkman, a pharmacist, out of the kindness of his heart, offered to assist them in their boycott as follows:\n\n“Any Muslim who has syphilis must not be cured by Salvarsan discovered by a Jew, Dr. Ehrlich. He should not even try to find out whether he has syphilis, because the Wasserman Test is the discovery of a Jew. If a Muslim suspects that he has gonorrhea, he must not seek diagnosis, because he will be using the method of a Jew named Neissner.\n\n“A Muslim who has heart disease must not use Digitalis, a discovery by a Jew, Ludwig Traube.\n\nShould he suffer with a toothache, he must not use Novocaine, a discovery of the Jews, Widal and Weil.\n\nIf a Muslim has diabetes, he must not use Insulin, the result of research by Minkowsky, a Jew. If one has a headache, he must shun Pyramidon and Antypyrin, due to the Jews, Spiro and Ellege.\n\nMuslims with convulsions must put up with them because it was a Jew, Oscar Leibreich, who proposed the use of Chloral Hydrate.\n\nArabs must do likewise with their psychic ailments because Freud, father of psychoanalysis, was a Jew.\n\nShould a Muslim child get diphtheria, he must refrain from the “Schick” reaction which was invented by the Jew, Bella Schick.\n\n“Muslims should be ready to die in great numbers and must not permit treatment of ear and brain damage, work of Jewish Nobel Prize winner, Robert Baram.\n\nThey should continue to die or remain crippled by infantile paralysis because the discoverer of the anti-polio vaccine is a Jew, Jonas Salk.\n\n“Muslims must refuse to use Streptomycin and continue to die of Tuberculosis because a Jew, Zalman Waxman, invented the wonder drug against this killing disease.\n\nMuslim doctors must discard all discoveries and improvements by dermatologist Judas Sehn Benedict, or the lung specialist, Frankel, and of many other world renowned Jewish scientists and medical experts.\n\nIn short, good and loyal Muslims properly and fittingly should remain afflicted with syphilis, gonorrhea, heart disease, headaches, typhus, diabetes, mental illness, polio, convulsions, and tuberculosis, and be proud to obey the Islamic boycott.\n\nOh, and by the way, don’t call for a doctor on your cell phone because the cell phone was invented in Israel by a Jewish engineer.\n\nMeanwhile I ask, what medical contributions to the world have the Muslims made?”\n\nThe Global Islamic population is approximately 1,200,000,000; that is ONE BILLION TWO HUNDRED MILLION or 20% of the world’s population.\n\nThey have received the following Nobel Prizes (The list only goes up to 2000):\n\nLiterature\n\n1988 — Najib Mahfooz\n\nPeace\n\n1978 — Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat\n\n1990 — Elias James Corey\n\n1994 — Yaser Arafat:\n\n1999 — Ahmed Zewai\n\nEconomics:(zero)\n\nPhysics:(zero) The essay omitted the one Muslim winner: Abdus Salam in 1979.\n\nMedicine\n\n1960 — Peter Brian Medawar\n\n1998 — Ferid Mourad\n\nTOTAL: EIGHT\n\nThe Global Jewish population is approximately 14,000,000; that is FOURTEEN MILLION or about 0.02% of the world’s population.\n\nThey have received the following Nobel Prizes:\n\nLiterature\n\n1910 — Paul Heyse\n\n1927 — Henri Bergson\n\n1958 — Boris Pasternak\n\n1966 — Shmuel Yosef Agnon\n\n1966 — Nelly Sachs\n\n1976 — Saul Bellow\n\n1978 — Isaac Bashevis Singer\n\n1981 — Elias Canetti\n\n1987 — Joseph Brodsky\n\n1991 — Nadine Gordimer World\n\nPeace\n\n1911 — Alfred Fried\n\n1911 — Tobias Michael Carel Asser\n\n1968 — Rene Cassin\n\n1973 — Henry Kissinger\n\n1978 — Menachem Begin\n\n1986 — Elie Wiesel\n\n1994 — Shimon Peres\n\n1994 — Yitzhak Rabin\n\nPhysics\n\n1905 — Adolph Von Baeyer\n\n1906 — Henri Moissan\n\n1907 — Albert Abraham Michelson\n\n1908 — Gabriel Lippmann\n\n1910 — Otto Wallach\n\n1915 — Richard Willstaetter\n\n1918 — Fritz Haber\n\n1921 — Albert Einstein\n\n1922 — Niels Bohr\n\n1925 — James Franck\n\n1925 — Gustav Hertz\n\n1943 — Gustav Stern\n\n1943 — George Charles de Hevesy\n\n1944 — Isidor Issac Rabi\n\n1952 — Felix Bloch\n\n1954 — Max Born\n\n1958 — Igor Tamm\n\n1959 — Emilio Segre\n\n1960 — Donald A.

The Jews don’t traffic slaves, nor have leaders calling for Jihad and death to all the Infidels.\n\nPerhaps the world’s Muslims should consider investing more in standard education and less in blaming the Jews for all their problems\n\nMuslims must ask ‘what can they do for humankind’ before they demand that humankind respects them.\n\nRegardless of your feelings about the crisis between Israel and the Palestinians and Arab neighbors, even if you believe there is more culpability on Israel ‘s part, the following two sentences really say it all:\n\nIf the Arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more violence.If the Jews put down their weapons today, there would be no more Israel.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu: “General Eisenhower warned us. It is a matter of history that when the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, General Dwight Eisenhower, found the victims of the death camps he ordered all possible photographs to be taken, and for the German people from surrounding villages to be ushered through the camps and even made to bury the dead. He did this because he said in words to this effect: ‘Get it all on record now — get the films — get the witnesses — because somewhere down the road of history some bastard will get up and say that this never happened’|\n\nRecently, the UK debated whether to remove The Holocaust from its school curriculum because it ‘offends’ the Muslim population which claims it never occurred. It is not removed as yet . However, this is a frightening portent of the fear that is gripping the world and how easily each country is giving into it.\n\nIt is now more than 65 years after the Second World War in Europe ended.\n\nNow, more than ever, with Iran, among others, claiming the Holocaust to be a myth, it is imperative to make sure the world never forgets.\n\nThis e-mail is intended to reach 400 million people. Perhaps you’ll be a link in the memorial chain and help distribute this around the world — or not….\n\nHow many years will it be before the attack on the World Trade Center ‘NEVER HAPPENED’ because it offends some Muslim in the United States?\n\nI read this aloud on YouTube.\n\nMarty Nemko holds a Ph.D. in educational psychology from the University of California, Berkeley.
