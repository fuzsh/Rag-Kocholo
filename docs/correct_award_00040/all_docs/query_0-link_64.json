Guillemin & Schally were also honored in 1977 but for research unrelated to Yalow's) 1975 AMA Scientific Achievement Award, 1976 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, 1988 National Medal of Science https://lnkd.in/_ckj-N\n\nMary Ann Bickerdyke (b. 7/19/1817), also known as Mother Bickerdyke, was a hospital administrator for Union soldiers during the American Civil War. When a surgeon questioned her authority to take some action, she replied, \"On the authority of Lord God Almighty, have you anything that outranks that?\" She was the only woman allowed in General Sherman's camp. By the end of the war, with the help of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, Mother Bickerdyke had built 300 hospitals and aided the wounded on 19 battlefields. https://lnkd.in/gZsyi8gd\n\nNancy Wexler (b. 7/19/1945) is an American geneticist and the Higgins Professor of Neuropsychology in the Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, best known for her involvement in the discovery of the location of the gene that causes Huntington's disease. https://lnkd.in/gazTdmpR\n\nRobert Hooke FRS (b. 7/18/1635) was an English natural philosopher, architect and polymath who played an important role in the scientific revolution, through both experimental and theoretical work. Hooke is known for his law of elasticity (Hooke's law), his book, Micrographia, and for first applying the word \"cell\" to describe the basic unit of life. https://lnkd.in/f7h642\n\n“…Firearm injuries are the leading cause of death in children. It surpassed motor vehicle crashes in 2020 for the first time. 2 out of 5 homes have at least one firearm 4.6 million kids live with unlocked, loaded guns 1 in 3 youth suicides and unintentional deaths can be prevented by securing guns 8 out of 10 children that used a firearm say it belonged to a family member….” https://lnkd.in/e5aFzadK\n\nRobert Hooke FRS (b. 7/18/1635) was an English natural philosopher, architect and polymath who played an important role in the scientific revolution, through both experimental and theoretical work. Hooke is known for his law of elasticity (Hooke's law), his book, Micrographia, and for first applying the word \"cell\" to describe the basic unit of life. https://lnkd.in/f7h642\n\nLucy Shapiro (b. 7/16/1940) is an American developmental biologist. She is a professor of Developmental Biology at the Stanford University School of Medicine. She is the Ludwig Professor of Cancer Research and the director of the Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine. She founded a new field in developmental biology, using microorganisms to examine fundamental questions in developmental biology. Her work has furthered understanding of the basis of stem cell function and the generation of biological diversity.[2] Her ideas have revolutionized understanding of bacterial genetic networks and helped researchers to develop novel drugs to fight antibiotic resistance and emerging infectious diseases. In 2013, Shapiro was presented with the 2011 National Medal of Science for \"her pioneering discovery that the bacterial cell is controlled by an integrated genetic circuit functioning in time and space that serves as a systems engineering paradigm underlying cell differentiation and ultimately the generation of diversity in all organisms.\" https://lnkd.in/g_AgrCGn\n\nJoseph Goldberger, M.D. (b. 7/16/1874) physician and epidemiologist employed in the United States Public Health Service (PHS). He was an advocate for scientific and social recognition of the links between poverty and disease. He was nominated five times for the Nobel Prize for his work on the etiology of pellagra. Conrad Elvehjem discovered the specific mechanism—that pellagra is caused by a dietary lack of the B vitamin niacin along with reduced levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan—in 1937. https://lnkd.in/gruME2z"
