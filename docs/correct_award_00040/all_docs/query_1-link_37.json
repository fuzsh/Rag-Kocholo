        "text": "Career\n\nWhile still a student at the University of Wisconsin, Herbert was named an instructor in pharmacology in 1911. After graduating from Johns Hopkins University in 1915, he returned to the University of Wisconsin as a pharmacology instructor. In 1916 Gasser moved to the department of physiology at Washington University, St. Louis. In the summer of 1918, he joined the Armed Forces Chemical Warfare Service in Washington. After the Armistice, he returned to Washington University, where he was made a professor of pharmacology in 1921. In 1931 Gasser moved to New York City and became a professor of physiology at Cornell Medical College. In 1935 he became the second director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. He remained in that position until 1953.\n\nOn retirement, Gasser continued active research for nearly ten years. From 1923 to 1925 Gasser was in Europe working with A. V. Hill at University College, London; Sir Henry Dale at the National Institute for Medical Research; Walter Straub at Munich; and Louis Lapicque at the Sorbonne.\n\nGasserâ€™s early work, dictated by the exigencies of World War I, was concerned largely with problems of traumatic shock and blood volume. Only after the war, he wrote his first work on nerves with H. S. Newcomer. It concerned application of thermionic vacuum tubes to the study of nerve action currents. Then Gasser collaborated with Erlanger in studying the barely detectable electrical impulses carried by isolated mammalian nerve fibres. By 1924 they had succeeded in adapting the oscillograph to physiological research, enabling them to visualize amplified nerve impulses on a fluorescent screen. Using this device, they demonstrated that different nerve fibres exist for the transmission of specific kinds of impulses, such as those of pain, cold, or heat. Their work also made it possible to construct improved recording machines to diagnose brain and nervous disorders and to ascertain the success of treatments for these diseases. This work led to their recognition in 1944, when they jointly received the Nobel Prize. Gasser used his prize money to fund further research into the subject.\n\nViews\n\nIt is difficult in the days of near-universal television to imagine the early difficulties of oscillographic recording. Light intensity was so low that many repetitions of the nerve response were required to produce a photographic image, and tubes lasted but a few hours. Some consequences of these necessities were from one point of view essentially artifactual in nature. Typically, Gasser always was aware of, and concerned with, the possibilities of an artifact. When it became possible to record single responses, it was apparent that they differed from those recorded during repetitive activity. A clue to the difference was found in a subsequent study of the subnormal state of nerve which, by responding repetitively, had influenced the early recordings."
