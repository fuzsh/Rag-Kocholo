        "text": "My question from Monday spawned some good discussion on twitter (none, alas, on the blog). What is the goal of the nervous system? Well, a lot of people thought it was pretty simple:\n\nAs evidence for how important movement is for having a brain:\n\nYup, when a sea squirt decides to stop moving it just sits there… and consumes its own brain (for some definitions of ‘brain’). The video at the top, as suggested by Chris Maidan, is a great explanation of the reasoning behind the idea that the brain is for movement. Yet, despite Daniel Wolpert explicitly saying that the reason we have a brain is for movement… he actually makes an argument for something else that came up in the twitter discussion:\n\nAnother good alternative:\n\nAnd to throw in a curveball:\n\nBut the answer that I like the best:\n\nI have some thoughts that I’m writing up, though that is taking some time. Let me take a step back, though, and reword what my question was originally intended to be (though clearly in my sleep-deprived state I did a poor job of describing it).\n\nAs others suggested above, the overall goal of any part of a biological system is to maximize the transmission of genetic material (by one mechanism or another) from one generation to the next. Yet when examining the nervous system on a more local level that can be hard to notice; the visual system, especially the early stages, are there to extract information about visual scenes; the auditory system is there to extract information about sound; the spinal chord is there to (mostly) generate movement. If you don’t believe me, look at the peripheral sensory nerves, at the retina, at the cochlea: all part of the nervous system, and on a local level they are guided by local goals. It is not until you get to more internal structures that general ideas of value or desire are found.\n\nAnd we can write this out mathematically; sensory neurons are often said to be maximizing the Shannon mutual information between their response and the visual world which we can write in a very simple way I(neural response;visual stimulus) with plenty of experimental support. In other words, the visual neurons represent as much information about the visual scene as is possible.\n\nBut given that we know that the ultimate goal of the nervous system is to enhance reproductive success – why isn’t that included in the equation? Where would we need to include something like that to have a good understanding of the function of some area of the visual system? Is a proxy like ‘utility’ good enough?\n\nIn systems neuroscience, we like to say that the goal of the visual system is to extract as much information about the world as possible. We start in the retina with points of light; those points are correlated (look around you: the color of one part of the visual world is often very similar to the color right next to it). So then the next set of neurons represent sudden changes in the brightness (ON/OFF neurons) to decorrelate. In the first stage of visual cortex, we find neurons that respond to edges – areas where you could put a several ON/OFF receptive fields in a row (see above). The responses of the visual neurons get successively more unrelated to each other as you go deeper into cortex – they start representing more abstract shapes and then, say, individual faces. But our guiding principle through this all is that the visual neurons are trying to present as much information about the visual world as possible.\n\nBut now let’s look at the nervous system from a broader view. What is it trying to accomplish? If we were economists, we might say that the nervous system is trying to maximize the ‘utility’ of the animal; an ecologist might say that it is trying to maximize the reproductive success of an animal (or: of an animal’s offspring, or its genes).\n\nIs this a reasonable view of the ‘goal’ of the nervous system? If so, where do the goals of the input and the output meet? When do neurons in the visual system of the animal begin representing value, or utility, at some level? Is there some principle from computer science that has something to say about value and sensory representation?\n\nUpdate: There was a lot of discussion on twitter, which I have partially summarized here.\n\nOne day, a few anthropomorphized liquid water molecules got together for some coffee and started debating the Exceptionality Hypothesis: that liquid water was fundamentally different from other types of water.\n\n“This is ridiculous,” one exclaimed. “Scientists have shown that water vapor and water ice are made of the same atoms that we are, structured in the same way, and follow the same physical rules that we do. Sure, we stay on the ground but so does water ice! And water vapor may be in the air but it moves around freely – just like us! There’s nothing special about being a liquid water molecule.”\n\nA second rolled their (fictional) eyes. “I can’t believe we’re talking about this. I don’t feel like a gas or a solid. I suppose I agree that we share some things in common with those other two – but we’re fundamentally different!”\n\nThe first snorted. “Sure. How?”\n\nObviously, liquids, gases, and solids behave differently; despite being made of the same molecules following the same rules, if you vary the temperature you get fundamental changes in behavior due to phase transitions. Even if things are made up of the same constituent parts that vary in proportion, you can get fundamentally different behaviors.\n\nOK, so this is a silly little parable. But there’s an article going around the tweetersphere by Annalee Newitz titled “Yes, Humans Are Animals — So Just Get Over Yourselves, Homo sapiens“. I’m sure you get the point:\n\nYet we have many other behaviors that we share with our fellow animals. Darwin wrote about this in one of his lesser-known works, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Today, hundreds of scientific studies have offered solid evidence that animals from chimps to rats share the same kinds of emotions and motivations that we do.\n\nMany animals also make tools the way humans do too. We’ve long known about tool-making among other primates, but recently scientists have found evidence of tool-use among dolphins, crows, and even sea otters.\n\nHumans may not use tools and express emotions exactly like other animals, but that doesn’t exempt us from animal status. No two species share exactly the same sets of behavior. But we also share far too much in common to pretend that we are some form of life that transcends animal status.\n\nHumans are animals, clearly. We are mammals with an evolutionary lineage that can be traced back just like any other animal on Earth. But there’s a double-use of the word going on: animals as biological entities and animals as moral entities.\n\nIt seems what may – may – separate us from other animals is along a moral and cognitive axis. We certainly do have neural structures for decision-making and learning about value that are the same as rats and monkeys, but so do bees and other insects. Yet if you were to tell me that insects are able to master the same cognitive tasks as most mammals I’d wonder about you. You see this implicitly in how we treat other classes of animals: insects are not fish are not mammals. We are fundamentally different.\n\nSo we should think about what makes us distinct from other animals. Let’s take a few of the examples in the article. Ants build massive cities, milk (and raise!) aphids for food, and tend fungus gardens. But besides us, ants are unique in this; and as far as I’m aware, these were most likely done on a longer evolutionary timescale and was not done consciously. Yes other animals use tools, but prodding something with a stick is a little different from a using jackhammer or even a mass-produced screwdriver (let alone building and designing these tools to begin with). Other animals may share the same kind of motivations and decision-making, but I have yet to see another animal read a mass-produced text on the other side of a planet in order to guide their decisions. More, there is no other animal that has consciously launched itself into space with dreams of living there.\n\nEven if the biological and neurological components required to, say, design and build a computer are present in bits and pieces of other animals, it is their confluence that is found in us. Perhaps every animal is different in its own way, but let’s be clear: as a species, we can do things that other animals could never even dream of. We have the ability to liberate ourselves from our biology and change our environment in conscious ways that all other animals cannot. We may be animals, but we’re not animals.\n\nI am a firm believer in the importance of a university-level education, though not for learning any trade-skill level set of facts – there are much better places to learn those than at a University! University education should not be about what to think but how to think. When I was an undergraduate in Mathematics, it was less about memorizing the precise proofs then learning the idea behind how to prove things (especially within a given class).\n\nI have just returned from visiting several labs at other Universities that are very geographically very away from my home lab. Each University, for historical or other reasons, has a set of questions that is predominant in a way that it is not at another University. Perhaps one is smaller and collaborative and so you have many people at least touching on similar questions, thinking it through in similar ways. Perhaps another has a strong tradition in several fields which they have tried to keep up.\n\nWhen visiting these labs, what should I care about? The specific facts? Or the way they are thinking about their problems? Data is great, but what help is it in the absence of a framework to understand it? Should I be remembering the exact details of experiments, or how it fits in and modifies my framework to understand the brain?\n\n(Note that this got me into trouble at least once with a vague thought about the balance of excitation/inhibition in cortex but realizing I don’t know any of the references I was basing it off of…)\n\nWhen faced with a model of the world (in physics, neuroscience, economics, ecology), how should you judge that theory? Cyrus Samii suggests 5 ways. Here is number 2:\n\n2. If any result can be engineered then results themselves have no special ontological status.\n\nThis is another way of asking whether a model has empirical content, which we typically take as falsifiability. Yet Karl Popper suggested:\n\nThe empirical content of a statement increases with its degree of falsifiability: the more a statement forbids, the more it says about the world of experience.\n\nAnd he suggested “two criteria determine the empirical content of a theory are their level of universality (Allgemeinheit) and their degree of precision (Bestimmtheit).”\n\nI also really like the question at the start of number 4:\n\nHow complicated can the problems be that we allow our agents to solve in a model? Is a dynamic program ever admissible as a reasonable assumption on the objective function of an agent?\n\nCharles Krebs (or Judy Myers) says:\n\nRecommendation – no paper on models should be published or talked about unless it makes specific, testable predictions of how the model can be tested.\n\nI actually disagree with this rather strenuously. There are several reasons to make models, only one of which is to make predictions. Another is to confirm hypotheses.\n\nLet’s say that you think that honeybees are dying because of the excessive use of mint toothpaste and you collect data to prove it. The problem is that data is simply a collection of facts (or “facts”) with no organizing structure. A model can give those facts that structure: you put what you know together with some of the data, and see if what you know is sufficient to replicate the observations of the world. Of course, you have to interpret these types of models carefully; they are not predictive models in the sense that they tell you anything about the world. Rather, they tell you about whether you have a consistent and complete story. But it’s still just a story.\n\nOne of my friends recently hired – or had foisted upon her – an undergraduate to help her do research. “How do you stay motivated?” he asked her. “Uhh” she responded.\n\nWe’ve all been there. Doing science really sucks, a lot of the time. Add to that the common list of other deficits with this career: little money, tons of work, no real respect, etc. So why do we do it?\n\nWhile I was on the microscope I was thinking these very thoughts, and decided to write an article about it on Medium. One of the points of writing this blog is to get better at writing, so I used the chance on Medium to do something a bit different.\n\nThe point of the article is that, while there are many reasons one could do science – and I know the reasons are probably pretty heterogeneous among my peers – the reason that I in particular do science is for aesthetic reasons. Essentially, the impulse to do science is the same impulse that drives someone to an appreciation of art. It is a cultivation of an appreciation of the beauty of the world. I’m not sure what motivates an Artist to create Art, though it seems that my few vain attempts have been about creating something beautiful for other people. But to me science is more like stumbling through an art gallery: it isn’t about creating something for other people, but rather finding something beautiful for myself. Once found, I can fit it into my mental blueprints of the world and reflect on it as I would a fine work of art. Perhaps that’s a bit selfish, but it’s what keeps me going.\n\nGo read it, and please feel free to send any constructive criticism on it my way!"
