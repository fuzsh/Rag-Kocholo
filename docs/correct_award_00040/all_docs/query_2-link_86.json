        "text": "What began as a high-school requirement has blossomed into a life-long relationship and career for Spencer Gasser, DO. He is honored to have worked alongside William Oehlenschlager, MD, PhD, for 13 years now, and is grateful for the opportunity, extraordinary expertise and unmatched mentorship he gained from his time with Dr. O, as he’s known to his patients.\n\nAs Dr. O plans to retire later this year from Akron Children’s Pediatrics, Wadsworth North, Dr. Gasser hopes to carry on his great legacy of kind, compassionate and exceptional patient care.\n\n“Dr. O has always been willing to teach and incorporate me into his practice and patient care, and I’m grateful for that,” said Dr. Gasser. “It’s really cool to see him work and learn from him because having that type of legacy is something I’m striving for in my own practice.”\n\nDr. Gasser’s journey with Dr. O\n\nA Creston native, just outside of Wadsworth, Dr. Gasser first met Dr. O in 2011 when he shadowed him for his high-school capstone project. He’d always dreamed of becoming a pediatrician, but wanted confirmation before embarking on medical school. While Dr. Gasser wasn’t a patient of Dr. O, he came highly recommended.\n\nIn 2018, Dr. Gasser returned to Dr. O’s office after his assigned rotation during his third year of medical school fell through. Dr. O was happy to welcome him back for his month-long rotation requirement.\n\n“This time around, Dr. O expanded his knowledge sharing to include more than basic pediatric medical knowledge,” explained Dr. Gasser. “Dr. O started later on Thursdays, so we’d meet every week for coffee instead and he’d educate me on finances in medicine, what to expect when running an office and what it takes to establish strong connections with patient families to successfully practice in a community for years to come.”\n\nFast forward to 2020, Dr. Gasser graduated from medical school and began his residency at Akron Children’s. When it came time to choose a weekly outpatient visitation to fulfill a requirement, there was no doubt he’d return to the Wadsworth North office to work alongside Dr. O for the next three years.\n\n“In Spencer I saw, and continue to see, all the personal attributes needed to have a great career serving as a community pediatrician,” said Dr. O. “His arrival on the scene as I was approaching retirement was a blessing, as he was an ideal candidate to replace me.”\n\nDr. Gasser is poised to carry on Dr. O’s great legacy\n\nAfter graduating from medical school last summer, Dr. Gasser joined the practice full time in August to work alongside Dr. O as a pediatrician and colleague, while sharing his time at the Wadsworth primary care office, as well.\n\nDr. Gasser is grateful for the valuable skills he gained throughout his journey with Dr. O and has already incorporated them into his own practice. When entering a patient room, he admires the way Dr. O addresses the patient first and wherever appropriate, asks questions directly to the patient as to why they’re in.\n\nDr. O also has taught him to take time to truly listen to families, and to ensure by the end of every appointment, families feel their concerns have been heard and their questions answered.\n\nBut, Dr. Gasser most admires Dr. O for achieving generational care. After practicing for more than 25 years, Dr. O is beginning to treat his patients’ own kids.\n\nAs Dr. O sets his sights on retirement, Dr. Gasser hopes to carry on his legacy by striving for generational care, continuing the passion to train medical students under him and including families in high-quality, compassionate patient care.\n\n“Working alongside Spencer as a colleague for the past 6 months has been a joy. Watching him makes me proud and allows me to head off to retirement with peace of mind,” said Dr. O. “My wife, Sherry, and I knew the practice would successfully roll on in our absence due to our amazing staff and my fellow providers. What wasn’t clear until Spencer came along, was who would fill my old, worn shoes? Looks like the shoes fit.”"
