        "text": "28/04/2014 - With Guillaume Kozakiewiez’s film having its world premiere at Visions du Réel and three projects currently in development, the Rennes-based firm is moving to the next level\n\nSince its inception in 1989, Rennes-based company Vivement Lundi!, headed by Jean-François Le Corre and Mathieu Courtois, has firmly established itself in the documentary and animated TV programme production sector. Having been crowned with, among others, the 2011 Procirep Prize for French Television Producer in the animation category, and having also been singled out at an international level for such projects as the short films Le Petit dragon and Cul de bouteille (selected at a great many festivals, including Sundance, the Cannes Critics’ Week, the Annecy International Animated Film Festival and Clermont-Ferrand), the organisation is now having a stab at feature films for cinema.\n\nThe first cylinder to fire will be the documentary Salto Mortale, by Guillaume Kozakiewiez, which will have its world premiere on Wednesday at the Visions du Réel festival in Nyon, in the “Helvétiques” (“Swiss”) section. Telling the story of the fall and subsequent recovery of a virtuoso tightrope walker who lost the use of his legs in 2000, but who is nevertheless about to make a comeback, the film will be distributed in French cinemas by Zeugma Films in October.\n\nVivement Lundi! also has three other feature-film projects in development: the animated film Géricault by Bruno Collet, which will recount the French painter’s life at the time when he was creating his famous painting The Raft of the Medusa, as well as the documentaries L'Hippodrome by Céline Dréan and Pieces of a man, un portrait de Gil Scott-Heron (a remarkable figure in the world of Afro-American music and one of the creators of the hip-hop genre – from a screenplay written by Thomas Mauceri and Anne Paschetta).\n\n(Translated from French)"
