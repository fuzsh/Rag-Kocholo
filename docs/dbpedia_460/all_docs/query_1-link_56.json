        "text": ".\n\n.\n\nThe actress Anna Sten was born as Anjuschka Stenski Sudakewitsch in Kiew. She was spotted as an actress in Russia during an amateur performance in 1923. She went to the Moscow Film Academy and acted in first theater plays.\n\nShe made her film debut in 1927 and took part in Russian silent movies like \"Zluta knizka\" (27) and \"Moskva v oktyabre\" (27).\n\nShe went to Germany in 1930 where she was able to work for few years. In this brief time she appeared in well-known movies like \"Bomben auf Monte Carlo\" (31), \"Salto Mortale\" (31) and \"Der Mörder Dimmitri Karamasoff\" (31).\n\nFinally the producer Samuel Goldwyn became aware of the expressive actress and engaged her to the USA in order to create a pendant to Greta Garbo.\n\nAfter two years of intensive training, both in English language and acting à la Hollywood, her first American movie with the title \"Nana\" (34) came into being. But the desired success failed to come. Also her next movies \"We Live Again\" (34) and \"The Wedding Night\" (35) couldn't come up to the hopes of Samuel Goldwyn and he cancelled her contract.\n\nIn the next years Anna Sten appeared in American and English movies. To these productions belong \"A Woman Alone\" (36), \"The Man I Married\" (40), \"Three Russian Girls\" (44), \"Runaway Daughters\" (56) and \"The Nun and the Sergeant\" (62)."
