        "text": "Trapeze (Harmonic-film), a German talkie with English subtitles, was directed by E. A. Dupont, who made Variety. His penchant for oblique photography is appropriate for aerial acrobatics like the trick called \"Salto Mortale,\" which the three principal personages in this picture perform at frequent intervals. \"Salto Mortale\" is a giant swing on a revolving platform followed by a jump to a trapeze that has to be released by a ground-lever at exactly the right moment. It is performed by Marina (Anna Sten) and Jim (Reinhold Bernt), an arrogant animal-feeder who volunteers for the act to show Marina how good he is. Jim's best friend, Robby (Adolph Wohlbrueck), pulls the lever. You are aware that presently Jim will fall. When he does, Marina marries him out of sympathy. Robby takes Jim's place in the \"Salto Mortale\" and Jim takes Robby's job with the lever. When Marina and Robby fall in love, it complicates the act. Swinging on their high platform, they are sure that Jim, suspecting that he has lost his wife as well as his job, will one night forget to pull the lever. Presently he does forget.\n\nTo the reporters who met her when she arrived in Manhattan last fortnight, Anna Sten said, \"How do you do? Yes. No. Maybe.\" She was not trying to be cryptic. They were the only English words she knew. If she can learn quickly enough, she will be Ronald Colman's leading lady in Samuel Goldwyn's production of The Brothers Karamazov. Producer Goldwyn saw her in the Tobis production Karamazov, later in Tempest, with Emil Jannings. He cabled his agent to give her a contract if she could learn English quickly. Actress Sten thought it would take about two weeks.\n\nBrisk, blonde and beauteous, Anna Sten's confidence was not entirely unreasonable. When she arrived in Hollywood last week it was the beginning of her third cinema career. When her father, a Russian ballet master, died, Anna, then 12, helped to support the family in Kiev. At 15 she got into the Soviet Film Academy. Three years later, Sovkino sent her to Berlin to make pictures in Russian. Her work in Karamazov got her a UFA contract. She made two pictures in German, then a French version of Karamazov after studying French for three weeks. To convince Producer Goldwyn she took a Berlin screen testÂ—a bit from Gloria Swanson's role in Indiscretion, which she recited in English. Anna Sten, 22, came to the U. S. accompanied by her German husband (Dr. Eugen Franke) but not by her Russian dog, Drushka (\"Little Friend''). Said she (in German): \"The night I was leaving he [Drushka] ran away to keep a rendezvous. . . . Now he must come by the next boat, all alone. I am very sad about him.\""
