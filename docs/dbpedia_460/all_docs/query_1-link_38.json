        "text": "Elia Kazan commits to his questionable life decisions in “Man on a Tightrope;” a title that could just as well describe the precarious moment in its director’s career during which it arrived.\n\nReleasing a year after Kazan’s naming of names before HUAC, “Tightrope” assures that the director had no intention of soft-pedalling his way over the snake pit of consequences from his actions.\n\nInstead of going for a broad-appeal safe bet to win over critics of his choice to give HUAC testimony, Kazan commits in “Tightrope” to his anti-communist stance. He does so with such vehemence, though, that any nuance might as well be peanuts for elephants.\n\n“Tightrope” is based on the true story of a Czech circus troop that…\n\nThe human condition, superbly presented by Elia Kazan\n\nWatched as part of a new experiment --- New Letterboxd list here has more details (if interested)\n\nThis story of Czechoslovakian circus characters during Iron Curtain 1950s days could easily have been flubbed; as was the poster for this --- it's like the poster people wanted to cheapen this Kazan production. But this is a fine & accomplished production, with fine acting and Kazan deserves a lot of the credit for putting more effort into the direction for this than maybe 90% of directors might --- and Kazan's direction is not trying to be creative for the sake of being creative. He is focused on the story and how best to convey the…\n\nElia Kazan’s thriller in which a Czech circus owner-Clown and his whole troupe work a bold trick in order to get away. Starring Fredric March, Terry Moore, Gloria Grahame and Cameron Mitchell.\n\nOne of the more forgotten movies from director Elia Kazan (who had treated us to A Streetcar Named Desire before Man on a Tightrope, with his next film On the Waterfront) concentrates on Karel Cernik (Fredric March), the owner of a tiny Czech circus which has been in his family for a really, really long time.\n\nAfter the Communists take over, officials start to command virtually every aspect of how the integrated gang can function. Karel's wife, Zama (Gloria Grahame), becomes more and more unsatisfied with the limited…\n\nI love how director Elia Kazan really takes us to this place, which is a circus in Czechoslovakia behind the Iron Curtain after the war. It really feels like we’re there, in part because he shot it in Bavaria and used many members of the (real-life) circus that had escaped from East Germany a few years earlier, and also because he often takes us behind the scenes. The cinematography is great, and the film has high production value.\n\nFrederic March plays the leader of the circus, and early on we see him on all sorts of tightropes, besides the one he uses in his act. His daughter (Terry Moore) is defiant after having fallen in love with one of the…\n\nFilm #58 of The December Challenge 2013\n\nMan on a tightrope is a wartime thriller about a circus performance group trying to escape from the communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Since I didn't do any reading on the film before I watched it, I thought it was a film about a forbidden romance until a third of the way into the film. It's very soapy in terms of the romantic subplots, but overall it's a damning indictment of an oppressive communist government, a subject Kazan seems to have dropped for the rest of his career. Instead of being concerned with having scenes in which actors could excel, the ensemble cast made up of unrecognizable actors to me faded to the background.…\n\nThe 1950s, Pt. II: 61/100\n\nRanked: Elia Kazan\n\n1953 Ranked\n\nIf On the Waterfront is Elia Kazan justifying informing, then Man on a Tightrope is him being somehow more annoying and self-serving. It came a year before On the Waterfront, so he was not quite in the “justifying my actions” stage of cowardice. With this film, he was intent on showing that he was somehow just an apolitical figure. After all, his role in society is that of an entertainer. He likens himself to Karel Cernik (Fredric March), a circus manager (who once owned the circus before his Czech home was overtaken by the Soviets) who just wants to run his circus his own way, only getting involved in any…\n\nThere's a scene about 45 or so minutes in here where Frederic March meets with the owner of a rival circus that starts with them commiserating leading to some pretty good dialog (i think) and then ends with them staging a slap fight---if there's ever a clip party theme i can think of to insert this scene into, I'm gonna use it! Very good scene! Very strong--definitely the best scene in the movie. This was i thought overall a fairly tight narrative of the owner of a circus in Czech trying to literally sneak his circus out of the communist own Czech Republic once members of the government party start coming down on him and telling him that he doesn't…\n\nThis was fascinating to watch. For a Hollywood film it has a very European sensibility. It's obviously a story about the Eastern European situation at the time but it has almost a new wave feel to it. It looks great throughout and there are some shots which are far removed from Hollywood stylings. Given that its set in Czechoslovakia, it's also appropriate that at times its almost Kafkaesque. The fact it's a circus troupe that's trying to cross the border plays up the absurdity of what happened to Eastern Europe when the Soviet Union took over. And in the middle of all this, the wonderful Gloria Grahame is doing her thing. So, I really want to like this film. I'm…"
