        "text": "Scacchi, the origins\n\nIn 1964, it was officially the year of our foundation, although in the previous year, a group of friends, schoolmates, gathered to experience the three days of the Ivrea Carnival together. As the sole symbol of recognition, in addition to the common work overalls, they chose a round shield with a design in the center.\n\nThe square and the uniform\n\nThe first shooting area chosen was Via Arduino, a completely uphill stretch of road where there were more floats to push than targets to hit. In 1964, the first real Scacchi team was formed, and the shields were set aside, replaced by a sparkling jersey that had little resemblance to a chessboard, given the very small size of the black and white squares. The choice of colors and the name were primarily dictated by the fondness its members had for a famous football team with the same social colors (black and white) and, the main reason being that there were 16 shooters, like the pieces of one side of a chessboard. Among them, the king, queen, bishops, knights, rooks, and pawns were elected, each with a specific organizational role.\n\nThe symbol on the uniform is entirely linked to the city of Ivrea, to its Castle, which, with its red towers, overlooks ancient and modern Eporedia from above. The first meeting place was granted by the parish priest, Don Anacleto, on Via Riva, under the Church of the Friars.\n\nA team in constant evolution\n\nSince 1965, access to the team has been open to everyone. The common point that united all the team members, in addition to their inexperience and enthusiasm, was that none of them had ever played for any other team before. The battlefield remained at Arduino, and on Tuesdays, the Scacchi tried to enter the city square to shoot the final round of jet cars."
