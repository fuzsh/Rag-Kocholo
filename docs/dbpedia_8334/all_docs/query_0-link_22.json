        "text": "The origin of the madness goes back to a legendary people's revolt against Count Ranieri of Biandrate and is based on liberty and freedom of expression.\n\nIt really is a genuine experience and something I had always wanted to participate in since we began Delicious Italy.\n\nThe invite came in 2014 and was 4 days, not only braving the oranges, but seeing all the preparations behind the scenes, from the preparation of the horses pulling the carts to the traditional food and wider festivities.\n\nRead my full report of the Historical Carnival of Ivrea here.\n\nBeans on Carnival Day\n\nBefore the battle on the Sunday of Carnival, the populace are fed with free beans, perhaps to sustain them during the rigours of battle.\n\nThe signal for the festival to begin is the holding aloft of a child by each of the 4 quarters of the town.\n\nAlthough not as dangerous as running with the bulls at Pamplona, on a cold day it has been known for many of the oranges to freeze like golf balls.\n\nThe origins of the festival go back to the 12th century when there was a popular uprising against the tyrant Count Ranieri.\n\nHe had claimed first night's rights with all new brides and ran into the wrong person.\n\nA newly betrothed miller's daughter, Violetta, beheaded the amorous count and showed his head from his bedroom balcony.\n\nThis sparked a popular revolution of the people which founded the roots of today's orange battle.\n\nEvery year there is a new Mugnaia (miller's daughter above) chosen who is the heroine of the festivities.\n\nShe is accompanied by a roll call of characters who represent the historical heritage of the town.\n\nThey include the General and his staff, soldiers, musicians and more than 1,500 masked characters that perform in historical parades and pageants throughout the period.\n\nThe Battles\n\nThen, 400 tons of oranges are used as ammunition as rival factions battle in a satirical but well-fought re-enactment of the people's revolt against their lords many centuries ago (the battles begin on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday at 2:30 in the afternoon).\n\nThere are more than 40 carri (decorated horse drawn carts) that carry 12 paying throwers (who represent the castle) through the 5 piazzas of the city, where over 3,500 rebellious warriors representing 9 teams attempt to overwhelm them with their vicious orange throwing techniques.\n\nThe winning team is determined by a jury who takes into account the decorations of the piazza (each team gets a half of a piazza to decorate) and the fury and accuracy of their orange throwing talents.\n\nReady to go?\n\nThe streets, walls and participants take on the color of the squashed and splattered fruit.\n\nEvents draw to an end with the final burning of the scarli (which are large wooden poles) and a codfish and polenta feast in the Borghetto area of the city plus, during breaks in the ceremonies, there are dishes of fat beans being handed out (a tradition which dates back to 1325).\n\nThe population of the town (25,000 residents) quadruples for the event and it's impossible to drive through the streets as most of them are closed for traffic control or to allow the carri to pass by.\n\nMost hotels are booked a month in advance but a night's stay is really not necessary to witness the battles.\n\nIf you want to submerge into the fabric of the people and the true meaning of the events then a night or two stay is very much recommended.\n\nThis celebration is a very deep and integral part of the people's life here and the time you take to understand it will be well worth your while.\n\nAs violent as it is, there is no Carnival more honest and welcoming than this one.\n\nBest Ivrea Carnival Links\n\nwww.storicocarnevaleivrea.it\n\nwww.mercenari.it\n\nwww.aranceriscacchi.it\n\nwww.instagram.com/carnevale_ivrea\n\nwith additional text by Dan Hostetler"
