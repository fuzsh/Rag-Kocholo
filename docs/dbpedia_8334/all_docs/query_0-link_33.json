        "text": "Ancient Origins\n\nWhat we see today is the culmination of a long series of transformations over the centuries; from a Spring fertility rite to a cultural celebration of the values of freedom and universality.\n\nIt is not just a single event but a series of moments across Ivrea where literally everyone participates, young or old.\n\nFlags can be seen everywhere during Carnival and represent the 9 parishes: San Maurizio, Santi Pietro e Donato, San Grato, Sant'Ulderico, San Salvatore, San Lorenzo, San Bernardo, Torre Balfredo and Sacra Cuore.\n\nThey have featured since the mid 1800s and show scenes and symbols from lvrea's history along with religious and other themes.\n\nThe central theme of today's Carnival dates from the late 18th century and is an epic legend of how the local people rose up against a feudal tyrant.\n\nIt is remembered on the morning of Carnival Sunday with an important ceremony called the Preda in Dora.\n\nThe ceremony has been documented as far back as 1608 in the Ivrea Comune Book of Statutes and was reintroduced in the late 1960s.\n\nIt decrees how no other towers or castles can be built on the site of the destroyed Castellazzo of the tyrant.\n\nThe book was kept by the Podesta who was the person who governed the city in the Middle Ages.\n\nHe appears again at Carnival when a symbolic stone from the Castellazzo is dropped by him from the Ponte Vecchio (main image on this page).\n\nThe Protagonists of the Ivrea Carnival\n\nThe Assistant Grand Chancellor is an extremely important figure in the history of the lvrea Carnival.\n\nIn the early 19th century, every event and ceremony had to be chronicled in detail in a special book by the Dean of the city solicitors, called the Grand Chancellor.\n\nSince solicitors were usually very busy, they used to appoint a trustworthy person to write deeds and this is how the Assistant Grand Chancellor came into being.\n\nHe is always in attendance to meticulously record every official deed.\n\nYou can spot him easily by his 18th century black church like clothing and white socks.\n\nBefore 1808, Carnival was celebrated separately in each parish of the city and organized by the local 'Abba', often with intense rivalry between all sides.\n\nThey were eventually brought together into a single festival following occupation of Ivrea by Napoleon's army and under the authoritative command of a figure who was to become 'The General', complete with Napoleonic uniform.\n\nToday, ten children in Renaissance costume impersonate the Abba, two from each of the five parishes of Ivrea, San Grato, San Maurizio, Sant'Ulderico, San Lorenzo and San Salvatore.\n\nThey all carry a sword with an orange on its tip to symbolise the severed head of the tyrant.\n\nThe Pipers and Drummers trace their roots to the military bands that used to accompany armies during their campaigns in Europe.\n\nThe band was officially set up in 1808, even though traces of the tradition of pipe and drum music were already noted in the 16th century.\n\nThe duty of the band is to accompany the Historical Parade and other Carnival celebrations as well as preserving and passing down the musical repertory traditionally connected with the Historical Carnival of lvrea.\n\nThe pipe (a small side flute made of boxwood), the side drum and the bass drum are the only instruments used and are made by the band members themselves.\n\nThe most important character of the carnival is the 'Mugnaia' or miller's daughter.\n\nHer role was introduced in 1858 in the middle of the Risorgimento and the colors of her costume also recall the colours of a unified Italy.\n\nShe is a symbolic heroine who won freedom for the townspeople by stabbing to dearh the feudal tyrant, throwing his head from the battlements and inciting the people to revolt.\n\nEach year she triumphantly parades in a Golden Coach throwing sweets and mimosa to the crowd. It is an honour to play the Mugania and the role is reserved for married women.\n\nThe Mugnaia is formally presented to the crowd on the Saturday evening before the Battle of the Oranges to thundering enthusiasm.\n\nMugnaia cariage in Ivrea Carnival\n\nThroughout the 1800s the Carnival became a more sedate and bourgeois affair.\n\nThe arrival of the French and increasing trade links saw exotic oranges appear in town, a fruit not commonly found in lvrea.\n\nThey were initially thrown as a tribute to the benign invaders, but then a little more vehemently during the Historical Carnival Parade of decorated coaches, floats and by people in fancy dress.\n\nThis custom gave rise to the formal orange battle which over time has transformed itself into a colourful, enthralling spectacle, so much so that many shops are closed and boarded up for the Carnival period to avoid any collateral damage.\n\nUnderpinning the Battle of the Oranges, therefore, is the notion of freedom for the people.\n\nA freedom symbolized by the orange throwing teams on foot who wear the colours of their respective teams.\n\nThe names of the teams are 'Asso di Picche', 'Aranceri della Morte', 'Scacchi', 'Tuchini del Borghetto', 'Scorpioni d'Arduino', 'Pantera Nera', 'Diavoli', 'Mercenari' and 'Credendari Aranceri'.\n\nThe teams on foot throw oranges at the Liege's armed guards who wear protective leather masks and padding on the upper body while riding sturdy carts drawn by two or four horses.\n\nThe horses are especially trained to know the route of the battle and there are strict rules to not take aim at the animals. They are beautifully groomed and turned out by experts.\n\nThey prance proudly into the heat of the battle decorated with shining coats of arms, splendid plumes and English bell collars crafted by the master Canavese harness makers.\n\nThe Gelderland and Friesian horses, both breeds from Holland, are admired and prized by horse experts in Italy and throughout Europe.\n\nThe Day of the Battle\n\nThe morning of the Battle of the Oranges also sees another rite where everyone can, should and does participate.\n\nIt is the free distribution of beans by the parishes of the town.\n\nThe tradition of charity 'fagiolate' comes from medieval times when beans were precious food and portions were distributed by Ivrea confraternities to the poor.\n\nToday, there are no fewer than eleven bean feasts in the various quarters of the city and, as well as offering warm sustenance in mid-February, they help to build and strengthen the ties between people living in the same quarter of town.\n\nMany, who for various reasons cannot enjoy the official festival, will wander up with a tub or container and take some home to enjoy later.\n\nAnother typical dish is polenta and cod. It is traditionally eaten on Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent.\n\nThis tradition dates from the second half of the 16th century with the counter-reformation of the Catholic Church. In Ivrea it is the culinary event that marks the ending of Carnival.\n\nIn the past the dish was handed out in every quarter, like beans, but now it remains the tradition only in Borghetto where the Comitato delle Croazia has its kitchen in what used to be an old bakery.\n\nDozens of people take turns peeling onions, desalting the cod and cooking. However, many restaurants of Ivrea now serve similar dishes throughout the period of Carnival.\n\nBy this point in the festivities of Carnival you will have surely noticed that literally everyone in Ivrea is wearing a red cap. This is the Berretto Frigio or Phyrigian hat.\n\nIt is a symbol which dates back to ancient times. It was one of the attributes of the God Mitra, then subsequently adopted by the Persian army.\n\nIn ancient Roman times it was the hat given to freed slaves, hence its symbolic value of liberty.\n\nThe hat was also worn by peasants in the Canavese and became an official part of Carnival in the period of Napoleonic rule.\n\nThere is another reason to wear the Berretto Frigio.\n\nAs dictated by tradition and the General's orders, wearing the distinctive red hat will demonstrate your full participation in the event as well as preventing you from becoming a target during the Battle of the Oranges.\n\nThere are 5 zones where the throwing of the oranges is permitted. They are Borghetto, Piazza di Città, Piazza Ottinetti, Piazza Freguglia and Piazza del Rondolino.\n\nThey are all accessible with especially set up nets around the squares allowing anyone to get up close without risking (too much) being hit with a cold and juicy orange.\n\nIf you want to try your luck then the rule is to throw at the people in the carts not at those on foot, nor the drivers of the horses, and do ask first if you can take oranges from the orange-throwers' crates.\n\nDon't forget to look around you at all times and protect your face with your arm.\n\nSo, if you've wondered what the Battle of the Orange is like close up ...\n\nwith thanks to Turisimo Torino e Provincia and, above all, the people of Ivrea\n\nWe Suggest ....
