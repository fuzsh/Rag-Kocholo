        "text": "For other uses, see Canavese (disambiguation).\n\nTraditional region in Italy\n\nCanavese (French: Canavais; Piedmontese: Canavèis) is a subalpine geographical and historical area of North-West Italy which lies today within the Metropolitan City of Turin in Piedmont. Its main town is Ivrea and it is famous for its castles.\n\nTo the North it borders on the Aosta Valley and to the East on the provinces of Biella and Vercelli. To the South and West the borders have varied over time but might be taken as being the rivers Stura di Lanzo and Po. The valley of the river Orco and the area around Corio fall within the Canavese. Turin, however, is entirely excluded.\n\nThe main centres, in addition to Ivrea, are Caluso, Chivasso, Cirié, Cuorgnè and Rivarolo Canavese.\n\nThe first inhabitants of Canavese were the Salassi, a tribe of Celto-Ligurian roots; the Romans arrived in 22 BCE.\n\nWhen the Roman Empire fell, Canavese fell under the domination of Byzantium. It was then conquered by Lombards and later by Franks.\n\nAfter the death of Arduino, marquis of Ivrea and the first to bear the title of king of Italy (1015), the Counts of Canavese part of the House of Ivrea (who all claimed to be his descendants) shared out the region. This was the beginning of the big families of Canavese: San Martino, Valperga, de Candia, Castellamonte, and later the Biandrate family from Novara.\n\nThe House of Savoy started its political expansion in Canavese in the 14th century, and the Commune of Ivrea as well as the Canavese Counts became their subjects.\n\nIn the 16th century, Canavese came under French domination, then Spanish domination, then back to French domination. Napoleon's defeat in 1814 returned Canavese under the House of Savoy.\n\nSacro Monte di Belmonte\n\nHouse of King Arduin at Cuorgnè\n\nCathedral and Church of St. Bernardino at Ivrea\n\nFruttuaria Abbey\n\nCanavese is also home to numerous castles of medieval origin, such as those of Ivrea, Parella, Malgrà, Agliè and others.\n\nIvrea Morainic Amphitheatre"
