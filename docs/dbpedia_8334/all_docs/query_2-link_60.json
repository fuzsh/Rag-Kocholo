        "text": "The interventions are part of the project to upgrade and improve the Chivasso-Aosta railway line, in accordance with the provisions of the Framework Programme Agreement between the Region of Valle d’Aosta and RFI, aimed at bolstering and improving the performance of services along the Aosta-Ivrea-Turin line.\n\nThe main operation consists in the electrification of the 66-kilometre-long section of the line between Ivrea and Aosta, including the construction of three new electrical substations in Donnas, Chatillon and Aosta, plus upgrading the structures and tunnels along the route.\n\nFurther works, aimed at improving the line’s efficiency and regularity of operation, are planned in the stations of Nus, Hone Bard, Montanaro and Strambino, bringing them to international standards in terms of accessibility for persons with reduced mobility, with the construction of a subway and overpass, lifts, pathways for people who are visually impaired plus raised platforms.\n\nUpon completion of the works, electrification of the Ivrea-Aosta section will allow for fully electric trains to circulate, as an alternative to or replacement of the current diesel and bi-modal trains, meaning greater availability in terms of capacity and better standards for regularity and punctuality, all whilst contributing to the pursuit of global sustainable development strategies."
