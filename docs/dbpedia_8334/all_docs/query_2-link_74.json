        "meta_description": "Incantesimo by Mondocane, released 05 April 2024\n\n1. Incantesimo\n2. Incantesimo (Fabio Fabio Remix)\n3. Incantesimo (Front De Cadeaux Remix)\n\nIvreatronic is proud to present &quot;Incantesimo,&quot; the latest single by Mondocane, a downtempo groover designed to highlight the extraordinary voice of Gabriella Ferri, a popular and legendary Roman singer. The result is a mix of ancestral energy and charm that embodies the popular spirit of Italy. \r\nThis song is the line that divides darkness from light, two worlds that touch themselves and move on the rhythm of a pained and ancestral dance. \r\nL’amore, un incantesimo , un eco der core.\r\n\r\nThe single features two remixes, both stemming from the collaboration between Andrea Cota and Tropicantesimo, a collective from Rome.\r\nOne remix is by Front de Cadeaux, a duo comprising Dj Athome and Ugo Sanchez, an active member of the Roman collective, while the other one is by Fabio Fabio, another duo hailing from Ivrea. \r\nMondocane met dj Foresta (half of Fabio Fabio duo), during an event at the Fanfulla club in Rome, where the dj was playing. The connection between the two was immediate, instantly leading to a live performance together with Andrea’s live synthesizer improvisations on his DJ set.",
