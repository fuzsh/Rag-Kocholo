        "text": "Discover\n\nSince 1808, the Ivrea Carnival renews all its appointments year after year: it is the oldest Historical Carnival in Italy and it is a celebration for the entire city.\n\nIn December of the previous year, the recruitment of the Chief of Staff is closed, and the designated Citizen General, the representative of the Foundation of the Historical Carnival of Ivrea, and the Deputy of the Grand Chancellor announce the names of the four white braids, the 26 honorary officers, the six first appointment officers, the four vivandières, and the field assistants.\n\nOn Epiphany day, the Pipers and Drummers in the city square will seal the beginning of the event with the opening march, which, among “bean feasts,” banquets, and processions, will culminate, as every year, in the days of the Battle of the Oranges.\n\nThe most anticipated days of the event for the 2024 edition are indeed February 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th. On Saturday, February 10th, there is the presentation of the Lovely Miller from the external balcony of the Town Hall, followed by the march of the historical procession with the jocular torchlight procession and the parade of the teams of orange throwers.\n\nThe Battle of the Oranges, the most anticipated moment of the event, is on Sunday, February 11th, 2024. The nine teams on foot engage in the Battle of the Oranges with shooters on the carts and on the four-wheeled carriages divided into two routes: internal (Ottinetti square and city square) and external (Borghetto, Rondolino square passing through Lungo Dora and Freguglia square).\n\nThe same will happen on Monday and Tuesday, the day of the award ceremony for the orange-throwing teams and the float throwing carts in the city square.\n\nFrom Friday, December 15th, the nineteenth-century golden carriage, one of the dearest symbols of the Carnival to the people of Ivrea, returns to be exhibited in the lobby of the Ivrea Town Hall awaiting the 2024 edition of the event. In use since 1858, the carriage of the Lovely Miller is a true piece of Carnival history that year after year, thanks to the fundamental contribution of the organizers and the Components, has been kept in use and subjected to meticulous care to preserve its craftsmanship and magnificence intact."
