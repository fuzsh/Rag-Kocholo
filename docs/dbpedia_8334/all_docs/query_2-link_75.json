Ermentrude de Roucy\n\nMathilde de Mâcon+\n\nGuy de Mâcon\n\nGerberge de Mâcon+\n\nRenaud de Mâcon Comte de Bourgogne+\n\nAgnès de Mâcon+\n\nGuglielmo di Ivrea Comte de Mâcon et de Nevers\n\nBorn: Between 960 and 962 1\n\nMarriage (1): Ermentrude de Roucy about 981-982 1\n\nDied: 21 Sep 1026 1\n\nBuried: Abbaye Saint-Bénigne de Dijon, Dijon, Côte-d'Or, Bourgogne, 21000, FR 1\n\nAnother name for Guglielmo was Othon-Guillaume di Ivrea.1\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nGUGLIELMO di Ivrea, son of ADALBERTO II associate-King of Italy & his wife Gerberge [de Chalon] ([960/62]-Dijon 21 Sep 1026, bur Dijon, Abbaye de Saint-Bénigne). Rodulfus Glaber names \"Willemus, Henrici ducis priuignus, Adalberti Longobardorum ducis filius\" and records that, as a boy, he was secretly stolen from the land of the Lombards and restored to his mother \"with no small cunning by a certain monk\". \"Einricus imperator\" confirmed the property of the abbey of Fruttuaria, referring to property donated by \"Otto qui et Vuillielmus comes filius Adalberti nepos Berengarii regis\", by charter dated 1014. It is assumed therefore that Guillaume was imprisoned as a child by Emperor Otto I in Italy after his father and paternal grandfather were deposed as kings of Italy. The Chronicle of Saint-Bénigne, interpolated into the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, names \"Guilelmum Ottonem et eius matrem Gerbergam\" when recording that he was adopted by his mother's second husband \"dux Burgundie Henricus\". He adopted the name OTHON-GUILLAUME. He succeeded in [981] as Comte de Mâcon, by right of his first wife. He was declared heir to the duchy of Burgundy and installed as Comte de Nevers by his stepfather in 986. He was recognised as duke of Burgundy on the death of his stepfather in 1002, but deprived of his inheritance by Robert II King of France in Spring 1003 when the latter invaded Burgundy with troops lent by Richard II Duke of Normandy. Rodulfus Glaber records that \"Willemus, Henrici ducis priuignus, Adalberti Longobardorum ducis filius\" rebelled against the king [Robert II] on one occasion, supported by his son-in-law Landry Comte de Nevers. \"Comes Otto\" donated property to Saint-Bénigne-de-Dijon for the souls of \"Heinrici ducis qui eum loco filii adoptavit et genetricis sue Gerberge uxoris predicti ducis ac filii sui Widonis et Hermintrudis coniugis\" by charter dated 1004. Comte Othon continued to claim the duchy of Burgundy, but reconciled himself with the king of France in 1005, finally renouncing his claims in 1015. He was designated comes Burgundiæ, presumably a descriptive title with no precise territorial significance at that time although Othon did own extensive territories in Burgundy. The Chronicle of St Bénigne de Dijon records the death in 1027 of \"Otto qui et Willelmus dictus est comes\" and his burial at St Bénigne. The memorial on the tomb of \"Nobiliter natus Guillelmus et Otho vocatus\" records his death \"1027 XI Kal Oct\". The necrology of Autun Saint-Martin records the death \"XVI Id Dec\" of \"Guillelmus dux Burgundie, anno 1025\".\n\nm firstly (before [981/82]) as her second husband, ERMENTRUDE, widow of AUBRY [II] Comte de Mâcon, daughter of RAGENOLD Comte de Roucy & his wife Alberade of Lotharingia ([947/52]-[5 Oct 1002/1004]). \"Ermentrudis\" is named as daughter of \"Alberada filia Gerbergæ\" in the Continuator of Flodoard, which does not name either her father or her husband but specifies that Ermentrude was the mother of Agnes, the latter naming both her parents in charters (see below). Bouchard highlights the absence of proof that the husband of Alberade of Lotharingia was Ragenold Comte de Roucy. Her birth date is estimated from her son by her first marriage being named in 971. \"Ermentrudis conjuge sua\" consented to the donation of land \"in Aponiaco villa\" by \"Albericus comes Matisconensis\" to Cluny by charter dated 14 Jan 971. The genealogy of the Comtes de Mâcon, included in the cartulary of Saint-Vincent de Mâcon, records the marriage of \"dominus Guillelmus comes\" with the wife of \"Albericus filius Letaudi comitis\". Rodulfus Glaber states that \"Willemus, Henrici ducis priuignus, Adalberti Longobardorum ducis filius\" married the sister of \"Brunone Lingonensi episcopo\" who supported him in his rebellion against the king [Robert II]. \"Otto comes, Irvis comitissa\" subscribed a charter dated to [994] under which \"Milo uxoris mee Ermengarde\" donated property to Cluny. It is assumed that \"Irvis\" is a copyist error or abbreviation for \"Ermentrudis\" as no other reference to a countess of this name has been found. Her date of death is indicated by the Chronicle of St Bénigne de Dijon which records a donation by \"Otto comes cognomento Willelmus\" with \"filii eius Rainaldi\" dated 1004 \"pro anima Hinrici Ducis, qui eum loco filii adoptavit et genitricis sue Gerberge uxoris predicti Ducis, ac filii sui Widonis et Hermintrudis coniugis\". This is presumably the donation recorded in the charter dated 1004 under which \"Comes Otto\" donated property to Saint-Bénigne-de-Dijon for the souls of \"Heinrici ducis qui eum loco filii adoptavit et genetricis sue Gerberge uxoris predicti ducis ac filii sui Widonis et Hermintrudis coniugis\".\n\nm secondly (before 1016) ADELAIS, daughter of --- (-29 May 1026, bur Montmajour, near Arles). \"Otto comes et uxor mea Adila\" donated property to Saint-Vincent de Mâcon by two charters dated to 1015 or before (during the reign of Robert I King of France) both subscribed by \"Rainaldi filii sui\". \"Otto comes et uxor mea Adeleidis et filius meus Rainaldus atque Otto nepos meus\" donated property to Cluny by charter dated to [1015]. \"Otto comes qui nominatur Willelmus\" issued a charter dated 2 Nov 1023 subscribed by \"Raynardi comitis, Adheleydis uxoris eius\". The origin of Otto-Guillaume's second wife is not known with certainty. Most secondary source genealogies assume that she was Adelais [Blanche] d'Anjou , widow firstly of Etienne de Brioude , widow secondly of Raymond Comte de Toulouse , divorced wife thirdly of Louis V King of the Franks , widow fourthly of Guillaume [II] Comte de Provence , daughter of Foulques II \"le Bon\" Comte d'Anjou & his first wife Gerberge ---. Adelais's supposed fifth marriage is deduced from the following: Count Othon-Guillaume's wife is named Adelais in several charters, and Pope Benedict VIII refers to \"domnæ Adeleidi comitissæ cognomento Blanchæ\" with \"nuruique eius domnæ Gerbergæ comitissæ\" when addressing her supposed husband, Gerberga presumably being Count Othon-Guillaume's daughter by his first wife who was the widow of Adelaide-Blanche d´Anjou's son by her fourth husband. However, the document in question appears not to specify that \"domnæ Adeleidi \" was the wife of Othon Guillaume and the extracts seen (the full text has not yet been consulted) do not permit this conclusion to be drawn. It is perfectly possible that Adelais-Blanche was named in the letter only in reference to her relationship to Othon Guillaume´s daughter. If her fifth marriage is correct, Adelais would have been considerably older than her new husband, and probably nearly sixty years old when she married (Othon-Guillaume's first wife died in [1002/04]), which seems unlikely. Another difficulty is presented by three entries dated 1018, 1024 and 1026 which appear to link Adelais to Provence while, if the fifth marriage was correct, she would have been with her husband (whose death is recorded in Sep 1026) in Mâcon. These entries are: firstly, \"Adalax comitissa mater Villelmi quondam Provintie comitis et Geriberga eque comitissa eiusdem principis olim uxor\" donated property to Saint-Victor de Marseille for the soul of their late son and husband respectively by charter dated 1018; secondly, \"Vuilelmus filius Rodbaldi\" donated property \"in comitatu Aquense in valle Cagnanam\" to Marseille Saint-Victor by charter dated 1024, signed by \"Adalaiz comitissa, Vuilelmus comes filius Rodbaldi\"; and thirdly, a manuscript written by Arnoux, monk at Saint-André-lès-Avignon, records the death in 1026 of \"Adalax comitissa\". The necrology of Saint-Pierre de Mâcon records the death \"IV Kal Jun\" of \"Adalasia comitissa vocata regali progenie orta\".\n\nComte Othon [I] & his first wife had five children: Guy, Mathilde, Gerberge, Renaud and Agnes. 1\n\nEvents\n\n Title: Comte de Mâcon, Abt 981.\n\n Title: Comte de Nevers, 986.\n\nGuglielmo married Ermentrude de Roucy about 981-982.1 (Ermentrude de Roucy was born between 947 and 952 and died 5 Oct 1002 or 1004.)"
