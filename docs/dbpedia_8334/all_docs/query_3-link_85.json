        "text": "This essay on Armenian political theology focuses on the activity of Gagik Arcruni, the Armenian king (908–943/44) of Vaspurakan in the southeast of historical Armenia. During his reign, between 931 and 936, the Byzantine commanders of Armenian origin, John Kurkuas and Melias, supported by Gagik and other Armenian princes, conducted victorious campaigns against Arab emirates in the Euphrates valley and in Armenia. Whilst the Byzantine army was thus approaching his kingdom, Gagik addressed a Letter to the Patriarch of Constantinople Theophylaktos (933–956) and to Emperor Romanos Lekapenos (920–944), which is only preserved in Armenian. This Letter, which sought to facilitate reunion of the two Churches, demonstrates Gagik’s ability to understand the reasons of the detractors of his Church, whilst remaining loyal to it. Such an ability of distancing himself from one’s own religious tradition, without renouncing it, reflects the intellectual environment inaugurated by the Armenian-Byzantine council of Širakawan (862). This environment is also reflected in the iconography of the palatine church built by Gagik on an island in Lake Van between 915 and 921. The Arcruni family originated from a region lying to the east of the lake, where it was exposed to ancient Christian traditions transmitted in Syriac. Therefore, the idea of kingship articulated in the iconography of this church is examined with reference to Armenian and Syriac patristic and apocryphal sources, to fifth-century mosaics from Syria and to seventh-century Armenian and Georgian frescoes and their palæo-Christian prototypes. Adam, depicted at the centre of the east façade as the Giver of names to all living beings, is the prototype of every kingship. The eclectic character of this church’s iconographic programme and the particular attention paid by the artists to the outer walls of the building are indicative of the importance accorded to external observers. A number of its images were addressed not only to Christians but were also meant to arouse empathy in Muslim travellers. Tenth-century Arabic sources suggest that Muslims could reach this remote island in search of ‘wonders of the earth’ and of hospitality. Beholding the church mainly from outside, they could recognise on its walls personages and scenes familiar to them from the Koran and the Sunna. Several formal elements of the church’s figurative language have, besides, parallels in ancient figurative sources of Iranian derivation, later inherited by Islamic art, which had also to be familiar to the guests arriving from the east. The king with a goblet seated in an oriental way, in particular, represents a good householder and a generous host welcoming his guests to his dominion. Carved on the walls of the church, this and other images reflect Gagik’s awareness that the stability of his kingdom depended on establishing peace with his Muslim subjects and with the Islamic states adjoining it."
