        "text": "Alessandria\n\nAlessandria is located in the south eastern sid of Piedmont and its position is strategically connected with Lombardy and Liguria since the past ages. The area combines hills & valleys crossed by rivers, while the southern area is surrounded by the Liguria Appennine Mountains.\n\nFilled with lush & beautiful landscapes: the Monferrato hills rich of grape-vines and different colours, wide uncontaminated spaces, and prosperous chestnut, oaks andÂ beech woods.\n\nThere are many protected areas that safeguard the most particular environments of this province: the Parco Fluviale del Po Tratto Vercellese-Alessandrino (river park) that hosts many bird colonies, the Riserva Naturale del Torrente Orba (natural reserve) and the Parco Naturale delle Capanne di Marcarolo (natural park), where the alpine flora cohabits with the Mediterranean Maquis.\n\nThis territory is famous for its vineyards but also for its cultural heritage, witness of an important history thanks to the roman age remains and to the imposing ruins of castles situated in the countryside. Ovada, Acqui Terme, Casale Monferrato and Gavi are amazing towns rich in history and art, as their monuments that date back to different ages can prove.\n\nThere are a lot of other treasures that make unique and special a stay in this area: from the Acqui Terme thermal centre to the goldsmith production of Valenza that now has a well established international fame, to the Campionissimi of Novi Ligure Museum which is dedicated to the cycling theme in memory of two athletes, who were particularly attached to the area, Fausto Coppi and Costante Girardengo.\n\nWhat to taste:\n\n The whole gastronomy of Piedmont, and especially the local one, is simple, fresh, and based on natural products.\n\n In the whole province regional dishes can be found, such as the “bugnet”, which isÂ green sauce to make boiled meals tasty, or the “bagna caoda”, which is a dressing for raw vegetables made with oil, onion and anchovies. Among typical meals you can find porcini mushrooms and precious truffles from Bormida Valley.\n\n Cold cuts are really tasty, especially the “filetto baciato” (fillet) from Aqui Terme and small boiled cow salami from Mandrogne. The “rabaton” is a local specialty made with ricotta cheese, vegetables, eggs and an other kind of cheese.\n\n The best sweet dishes are the “krumiri”, that are typical biscuits from Casale Monferrato, the famous chocolate from Novi Ligure, chestnut cakes, soft and hard torroni (chocolates), and amaretti (biscuits).\n\n Around Novi Ligure and Ovada the gastronomic influence from Liguria is really strong, as some specialties show, such as the famous focaccia (oven baked bread) from Novi, which is very similar to the one from Genoa, while the health biscuits from Ovada are really similar to Legaccio di Genova biscuits.\n\n The whole area is important for its vineyards and its products, such as Cortese di Gavi, Dolcetto, Brachetto, Grignolino and Barbera (wines).\n\nCities & Towns:\n\nWhat to do:\n\n This area offers many opportunities to spend your holidays doing activities or just relaxing, both outdoor in uncontaminated landscapes.\n\n From Monferrato to Ovada the whole territory offers hiking, biking and horse riding trails, spread in a rich vegetation and through beautiful villages.
