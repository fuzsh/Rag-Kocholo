        "text": "Glosolì is a welcoming international artistic residence and a charming Bed & Breakfast, perfect for those who want to immerse themselves in culture, nature, and the environment. The name Glosolì was inspired by the musical piece \"GlósóIi\" by the Icelandic group Sigur Rós, which evokes the shining of the sun, beauty, and art. This magical place was born on December 21, 2012, and its logo represents a whale tail, symbolizing the ocean of consciousness, and a lotus flower, symbolizing the expansion of the soul.\n\nManaged by artists, the facility is modest and cozy. Located in the historic center of Ivrea, it overlooks the Giacosa Theater, a magnificent building dating back to 1834. Glosolì consists of an apartment with two rooms, one single and one double, a shared kitchen, and bathroom. Additionally, it has a spacious 65 sqm dance hall and an outdoor area in the courtyard, which can be used as an art studio during the summer months.\n\nRenovated in 2013, it offers a single room and a double room, as well as a dance/creation salon and a kitchen, used only by working artists.\n\nThe bathroom (with shower) is shared. Information about walks and nature excursions in the beautiful area of the 5 lakes of Ivrea and the Aosta Valley can be provided (or accompanied on an excursion with an additional cost), as well as information about cultural events in the city or in Turin and yoga classes (with a separate cost).\n\nThe B&B is a non-smoking space and shoes are not allowed.\n\nDuring the day, there may be interesting artistic and cultural activities in the salon.\n\nThe dance hall is also a suitable place for exhibitions and performances, offering a creative and peaceful environment.\n\nThe Glosolì International Residence for Artists, besides being a cozy B&B, is also a vibrant center for artistic creation. It is ideally located in the heart of Ivrea's historic center, right in front of the Giacosa Civic Theater. Additionally, it is conveniently situated near the hospital, town hall, and courthouse, among other amenities. The historic center is also famous for hosting the renowned Ivrea Historical Carnival in its charming squares.\n\nFor those arriving by train, the station is just a ten-minute pleasant walk away. The closest airports are Turin Caselle and Milan Malpensa, offering convenient access to international travelers.\n\nIvrea is only an hour by train from Aosta and Turin, and two hours from Milan. This allows visitors to easily explore these fascinating cities and experience their unique cultural offerings."
