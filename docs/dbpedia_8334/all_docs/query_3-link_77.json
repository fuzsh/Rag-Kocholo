        "text": "SIS consortium, comprising Fininc and Sacyr, has signed the contract to operate and manage the Italian A21 Turin-Alexandria-Piacenza and A5 Turin-Ivrea-Quincinetto highways, the connecting highway A4/A5 Ivrea-Santhià and Turin’s Beltway Highways System (Sistema Autostradale Tangenziale Torinese, SATT) and the Turin-Pinerolo stretch. These roads, already in operation, add up to 320 km in total.\n\nThis contract, awarded by the Italian Ministry for Infrastructures and Transport, is expected to generate traffic revenues over €2.9 billion over the 12-year concession term. This Design Build contract includes improvement works on the road sections with an estimate investment of €800 million.\n\nThese road networks are considered strategic for connectivity in Northern Italy, as they connect Turin to other large cities in one of the country’s most industrialized areas.\n\nOverall, these road infrastructures have an estimated average daily traffic of close to 33,000 vehicles.\n\nItaly is a strategic home market for Sacyr. Through SIS, the group operates four P3 road projects: the Pedemontana-Veneta, the A3 Naples-Pompei-Salerno, the Via del Mare and the just signed A-21.\n\nSacyr Concesiones is an industry benchmark in infrastructure development and is ranked 3rd in PWF’s World’s Largest Transportation Developers ranking.\n\nThe company currently manages an international and diversified project portfolio, valued at more than €3,250 million"
