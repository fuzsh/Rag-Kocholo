        "text": "*In the following article, Adriano Olivetti will be referred to by his first name while Olivetti the company will be referred to simply as Olivetti.\n\nBorn in 1901, businessman and self-described humanist Adriano Olivetti turned the idea of the often detested “company town” into a utopian city that certainly would have made Ebenezer Howard and Le Corbusier jealous. Adriano inherited the technology and design company from his father and turned a relatively small typewriter manufacturing company into a company revered for its attention to design detail. Ivrea, where Olivetti’s operations were based is situated more than an hour west of Milan, was arguably the closest the world ever came to realizing the visions of the fathers of modern urban planning. Unfortunately, like other utopian cities made in their vision, Ivrea failed as well, at least when graded on a scale of financial success and population. But the story of what Ivrea aimed to be, and the vision that Adriano had for the city are what made it a success.\n\nIt should be noted here that although Ivrea, Italy was a functioning city long before the Olivetti company based its operations there, the company became the reason for its distinction as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nRealized in the industrial boom of post-World War II Italy, Adriano’s Ivrea was a worker’s utopia. While American company towns were born out of a cruel desire of employers to gain even more control over their employees, Olivetti’s company town was an attempt at humanism and compassion. The company provided housing, childcare, entertainment, maternity leave, public transportation, and much more. Importantly, all of these services were entirely optional, and many were even provided to citizens of Ivrea that did not work for Olivetti.\n\nBased on his age, widely read nature, and social and political opinions, it is likely that Adriano Olivetti read and knew of the works of Howard, Le Corbusier, and possibly Frank Lloyd Wright. Their principles, as well as those associated with today’s idea of modern urban planning, could be found in innumerable aspects of Adriano’s vision for Ivrea.\n\nOne of the most famous buildings constructed by the company, the Western Residential Unit —a temporary housing facility more commonly referred to by residents as “Talponia”, which translates to Moleville in Italian — is built almost entirely into a hillside. As such, the complex has a green roof, a design feature considered a staple of modern planning despite its origin in ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nThe isolation of employees that was typical of, and often a contributing factor to the death of, company towns was discouraged in Ivrea. An article in the New York Times states\n\n“July would be a time of holiday, so that workers with homes in the surrounding countryside could tend to small farms — it was important to the company that workers not feel a division between city and country.”\n\n(Saval, Utopia, Abandoned)\n\nToday, Olivetti the company is little more than an occasionally used trademark and the town of Ivrea boasts an increasingly old and increasingly small population. Most of the buildings, although gorgeous works of modernism, sit empty. The astounding La Serra Complex —pictured above— is almost entirely unused, save for its ground floor which serves as a movie theatre. Another abandoned building hides a gym.\n\nAdriano Olivetti’s Ivrea, Howard’s Garden City, and Le Corbusier’s Radiant City are all far fetched utopian dreams. However, in pushing for that impossible, idyllic future, they were able to create ideas for a better present.\n\nPrimary source: Saval, Nikil. “Utopia, Abandoned.” The New York Times, The New York Times, 28 Aug. 2019, http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/t-magazine/olivetti-typewriters-ivrea-italy.html."
