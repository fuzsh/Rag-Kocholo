        "text": "2/5 stars\n\nIn my last review I promised something in the lower ratings tier, if only to give a reasonable benchmark to what works and what doesn’t for me when reading. I am not here to take pleasure in bashing anyone’s hard work though, it is neither my place nor intent, in fact I doubt I’ll be doing many of these in general.\n\nSo before I begin,\n\nA moment of silence for all those really promising stories that suffer from writing that doesn’t do them justice.\n\nNow, I will be completely honest, I read this almost a year ago, and I cannot say it was that memorable. In fact, I spent the better part of two days skimming through it again to get reacquainted with the story, characters and writing style. In doing so though, I recalled all the reasons why I didn’t care enough to continue with this series, especially not now that I have so much else in my TBR.\n\nThe plot is intriguing enough: A young monk uncovers a reality shaking truth under the Great Temple of his faith and is thus hunted for it. At the same time a pirate princeling makes some bad deals that cause him a fair share of grief while also facing plots and betrayals. And finally, the daughter of a merfolk chieftain is drawn to the affairs of men in the hope of saving her own people whose isolated existence, among other things, is leading them to ruin. As per the book’s back cover, this is a story about political intrigue, religious fervor, and ancient hatreds.\n\nI am always in the mood for some swashbuckling adventures! Moreover, even though this is purely a fantasy novel – as opposed to Beal’s other historical fiction works- its aesthetic feel and general setting are reminiscent of the Mediterranean world of the 15th century. So basically evoking a good chunk of my education – of course I am gonna have a soft spot for it. Having most of the city and character names be similar to existing Italian cities etc. was also quite amusing to me. Besides, mercenaries, pirate lords and dark magic, are among the things that will never fail to have my full attention.\n\nSo what didn’t work?\n\nFirst and foremost, the female protagonist Citala, is barely in this story! She is supposed to be one of the three main protagonists but aside from a quick and eyeroll worthy description of her attributes in the second chapter (more on that in a moment), – which in itself mostly works to set up the struggles of the other main character, the pirate Danamis, rather than her – Citala surfaces again no less than 14 chapters later!\n\nI am not sorry for that pun – at all.\n\nEven then, her whole character feels more like an accessory to our attractive male hero, with barely any agency of her own other than what is needed to give her impetus into asking for help and moving the plot forward. In general, I can’t say I was overly enthused with the portrayal of female characters throughout this story as a whole. As for her looks… I appreciated that Beal wanted to reinvent merfolk, they are more dolphin rather than fish like, so broadly speaking they breathe air, have leathery gray skin and legs instead of a tail, which I found quite neat and pleasant as a change. But while the males of the species are ‘hideous to behold’ with webbed hands, and faces that ‘resembled some monstrous frog’, the females are comelier, more humanoid in their features, and of course, the first thing we are given to picture Citala by are her naked ‘pointed and firm’ breasts which cause all the onlookers to be ‘unsure whether to be repulsed or aroused’… Somebody catch my eyes if they roll you by, for they dropped off and haven’t stopped going.\n\nThere is an obvious reason for this of course. Citala is to be the love interest and if she were more fish-like things could get dicey, the author says so himself in his website, on a post about writing this book – I checked. Now, I don’t really care about this difference in looks, sure males and females tend to be different in many species, there’s so many natural selection shenanigans going on. That is not my issue. Since Del Toro’s The Shape of Water came out and won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, we could even argue that Beal shying away from portraying a functioning relationship with a sexy fish person that is more “other” than human, is pure cowardice.\n\nBut let’s not go there.\n\nMy issue is that her attributes as a sexy humanoid mermaid are there purely for fantasy fulfillment purposes and to appeal to the male characters in the book more; because from what we can gather from Danamis as a character, he is shallow as hell regarding women, so he most definitely would not have gotten involved thus moving the plot forward. There’s very little to say about the relationship between the two protagonists as well. The whole deal feels flat, and the reader knows they’ll end up together more out of the obviousness of the cliché ( or trope if you’re feeling generous), rather than the engaging characters on the page and their chemistry.\n\nI had the pleasure of reading many other books, right before and after this one, with properly written female characters, that for a while I forgot it isn’t that common an occurrence. It’s getting better though so that’s something.\n\nOnto the second main thing that didn’t work.\n\nEven willing to look past what I just mentioned, in favor of the appealing setting/aesthetic and cool action sequences, such as the naval battles, and some interesting events involving the monk character and the ones hunting him, the writing style itself didn’t help matters at all. Pacing for one, is all over the place. In fact, there’s many overly long and unnecessary descriptions of the – let’s see how many words I can use – variety, interspersed with really short sentences and multiple, might I say pointless, motion markers/indicators. But what irked me the most was what I like to call thesaurus mania. There are so many instances where the words chosen are picked more for flourish than necessity, causing the whole sentence to become clunky and somewhat pretentious sounding (there is no point in calling someone’s mount a ‘destrier’ instead of horse, when you’re not writing within the context of a medieval knight’s ride for example) . I distinctly remember moments where I was completely drawn out of the story and what was happening, because I had to reread through entire passages in order to pick up the thread of what was happening again.\n\nIn an amusing coincidence, while looking for something else the other day, I found an old Instagram story I’d posted when I was reading this book. I even looked it up since English technically isn’t my first language, so I wanted to double check. The dictionary literally defines dank as ‘unpleasantly damp and cold’.\n\nSentence structure was often odd as well, once more distracting me from the story and making me wonder who would ever speak this way naturally when it came to certain dialogue exchanges. Take the following line for example: ‘There may be a way for you to gain your ships and for me to gain my people a future’.\n\nI understand the motivation behind it, perhaps to convey different language patterns and how a non-native speaker would talk with another person from a different culture/species. I’ve seen it done many times before, it makes sense, but in Beal’s case it wasn’t done in a way that felt organic. The best comparison I can make, is to say that characters speak and behave as if they knew a chronicler was following them and writing down their actions and speeches.\n\nI was disappointed to say the least.\n\nThe plot in itself had lots of promise and being terribly curious I would’ve wanted to know how it all continued. Especially because, as the first book in a series, many threads had barely just begun within its almost 500 pages. I don’t overly mind when the plot moves slowly in the first book of a series. Some of them just have that kind of structure; you do not take each book singularly but as part of a whole. In this case though, I didn’t find it delivering on its promise and I grew dissuaded from continuing with the next installment The Witch of Torinia.\n\nHappens.\n\nClifford Beal has also written the historical fantasy novels Gideon’s Angel and The Raven’s Banquet, which, as far as I can tell from some quick browsing and the fact that they just got new editions, have received more acclaim than his epic fantasy, but I cannot really speak for them as I haven’t really felt like reading more of his work. But who knows what the future holds!\n\nAnyone else read a book that let them down and wishes to rant away? Go for it in the comments!\n\nUntil next time,\n\nEleni"
