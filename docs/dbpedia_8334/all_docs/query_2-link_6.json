        "text": "Il Belpaese, is another name by which Italy is known, which literally means, Beautiful Country. The poet Dante, who first used this expression in his Divine Commedy, had already figure it out 700 years ago, and today, we have the numbers to prove it, as Italyâs cultural and natural landmarks make up for over 5% of the World Heritage list, with more than 50 sites recognized by the UNESCO. No other country in the world has as many. Only China keeps up with 52. As from yesterday, Italy has one more to add to its record-long list, since the northwestern city of Ivrea has won UNESCO cultural heritage status as a âprime site of the Italian industrial revolutionâ after Adriano Olivettiâs âhumanistic conception of workâ. But who is Mr. Olivetti? According to the Guardian, he is the man who âturned a small, Italian typewriter company into a global phenomenonâ affecting thus the urban style and architecture development of the small town of Ivrea, (population: 20,000), which by the 1950 had become one of the Countryâs major manufacturing hubs, earning thus the title of âindustrial city of the 20th centuryâ on the world heritage list.\n\nMr. Olivetti wanted his hometown and home of his company producing world-famous typewriters, mechanical calculators and the very first commercial programmable desktop computer (Programma 101), Ivrea, to be a more âhumanâ industrial city, a city where âharmony between private life and public life, between work and the home, between centers of consumption and centers of productionâ coexisted, as Olivetti himself wrote. Olivettiâs core idea rooted in a very strong community sense, which was ages away from the alienating Capitalism or conforming Marxism ideologies. He was a visionary, the first in Italy to tackle compatible development back in the 50s: forget those towering industrial soviet looking buildings, and welcome light, glass and open spaces. Green areas over gray faÃ§ades. Italian rationalism at its best. Ivrea provided houses for large families, a futuristic company canteen and recreational clubs, social services centres and a nursery school, all designed by leading Italian urban planners and avant-garde architects. Extrapolated from its context one might think we are talking about Mark Zuckerbergâs Willow park village in Silicon Valleyâ¦ and yet we are describing a small provincial town at the foot of the Italian Alps. A town which is much less famous that the âProsecco shireâ, Italyâs official World Heritage 2017 candidate, which has missed out on being inserted on the World Heritage list by just 2 votes. The hills, home of the renowned Prosecco wine â which drives Italian wine exports abroad and whose production is twice as much as French champagne - are expected to be given the award next year.\n\nWhat the Unesco website failed to mention is that not only is Ivrea famous for being a âhumanâ industrial city, but also because it is the home of one of the most fascinating Carnivals celebrated around the world, where Italyâs largest food fight, aka Battle of the Oranges, takes place every February. Italy: a Land with many sides of âBelloâ, not only in Rome, Venice and Florence."
