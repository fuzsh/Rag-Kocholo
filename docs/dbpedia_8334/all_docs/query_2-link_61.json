        "text": "In the last century Ivrea and the Canavese region were the scene of a novel social experiment that aimed to change the world utilising a perfectly suited tool for the task, namely the factory. Adriano Olivetti assigned a new task to his company, namely to contribute towards building a people-friendly society. Thus his “factory of goods” became a “Factory of Good” that not only dispensed products and salaries, but also social services, culture, democracy and beauty. This commitment went on to become his key to international success.\n\nFrom the “legendary” red-brick building built by Camillo Olivetti in the late Eighteen-hundreds, the buildings continued to multiply as the business grew, starting with four major evocative architectural additions built in a spirit of harmony, light and transparency. Now the time has come to push the envelope and build the “Quinto Ampliamento”: that exquisitely intangible ideal of renewing businesses, work and territories.\n\n“Via Jervis in Ivrea is the most beautiful road in the entire world” (Le Corbusier)"
