Ivrea Overview

The interesting town of Ivrea is located in the north of the Piedmont region. It lies about 55 km north of the regional capital Turin and 75 km from Aosta in the nearby autonomous Aosta Valley.

Ivrea is situated on the Dora Baltea River, a tributary of the Po River. It is in a region that was formed by a large Pleistocene glacier. This glacier created a series of moraine reliefs, including the Serra Morenica, the longest, most massive and straightest hill in the world.

With just under 24,000 inhabitants, Ivrea is considered the capital of the Canavese. A region known for the DOC wine of the same name.

The historic center is on a hill north of the Dora Baltea. South of the river lies the industrial city of Ivrea, one of the most important industrial centers in Piedmont. It has developed since the 20th century, thanks to the Olivetti company.
