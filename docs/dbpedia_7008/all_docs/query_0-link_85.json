        "text": "HUNTSVILLE, AL -- Chances are you won't see Jimmy Wales on the street but, if you do, go ahead and wish him a happy 10th anniversary.\n\nYou see, Friday marks the 10th anniversary of Wikipedia (wikipedia.org), which today is fifth most-visited website in the world.\n\nAnd it was all started by Wales, a native Huntsvillian who graduated from Randolph School and Auburn University. In fact, his parents still live here while he makes his home in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\nBut, home is just a pit stop for him right now.\n\nHe's been on the road a lot lately because of the upcoming anniversary of Wikipedia. You may have caught him on \"The Daily Show\" last week, in fact - an unusual appearance for someone who's not hawking a book, movie or new TV series.\n\nHis schedule won't allow him the chance to be with several thousand other Auburn grads tonight at the BCS national championship game in Glendale, Ariz., either.\n\nThough, he admits, \"I haven't been as big a fan as I used to be.\"\n\nBut then, not every Auburn grad can be as busy as he is, either.\n\nOne of his biggest accomplishments is the recent fund-raising venture for the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation, which helps support Wikipedia.\n\nThe charitable organization is dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free content, as well as providing the wiki-based projects to the public free of charge. The original wikipedia.com domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org when the foundation was launched as its new parent organization, prompting the use of a \".org\" domain to denote its non-commercial nature.\n\n\"We raised $16 million,\" he said. \"That's the most we've ever raised.\"\n\nA particular point of pride is the number of donations and the size of each one.\n\n\"There were more than 500,000 donations and a vast majority were small,\" said Wales.\n\nThat shows the support of the ad-free concept and that people of all walks of life from all over the world chip in to keep it going.\n\n\"There are over 200 languages,\" he said. \"We're going into India this year and it alone has 20 languages.\"\n\nThis isn't exactly what Wales had in mind when he graduated with his degree in finance.\n\n\"I had no idea it would get this big, of course,\" he said. \"I've always been an entrepreneur and excited about the Internet.\n\n\"It was a natural fit.\"\n\nTen years ago today, Nupedia - which was founded by Wales and has since been abandoned for Wikipedia - placed its first wiki online.\n\nA wiki is a website that allows the creation and editing of any number of interlinked web pages via a web browser.\n\nThe word has been used famously - or infamously, it all depends on your interpretation - recently through the mass dumping of secret government documents by Wikileaks.\n\nThough their names have a common thread, Wales said he didn't think there has been any confusion between the two.\n\n\"I think most people know what the difference is,\" he said.\n\nAnd for Wales, Wikipedia will continue to grow as its \"library\" expands.\n\n\"We've got people building the rest of the library,\" he said. \"There will be a 'Lostpedia' for fans of the show and there will be 'pedias' for videogames; recipes are huge, too.\n\n\"There's no limit.\""
