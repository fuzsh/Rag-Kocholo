        "text": "Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales hates the word \"crowdsourcing.\"\n\nThe Huntsville native, co-founder of the fifth most visited website on the planet, says many businesses look at crowdsourcing as a way to \"trick the general public\" into doing work for free. Yet, the business model doesn't work because it doesn't take the needs of the crowd into account.\n\nThat was just one insight Wales shared as part of a talk Thursday night to a group gathered for BBVA Compass' Bright Perspectives Forum at Mountain Brook's Grand Bohemian Hotel.\n\nWales, 50, gave a snapshot of Wikipedia, its associated for-profit Wikia sites, and the future of information. Wales said he would probably fail a class in entrepreneurship, as the idea of creating a non-profit online encyclopedia without advertising might not sound successful.\n\nBut the idea was compelling - provide access to the sum of all human knowledge for free.\n\nWales has also created the for-profit Wikia sites, which use the Wiki model to provide online articles about popular books, movies, videogames and other media. The movie site, for example, is second only to the Internet Movie Database in terms of popularity.\n\nThe Wikipedia model has also proved so successful that it has translated worldwide, literally. Wikipedia is the world's most linguistically diverse website, with 288 languages represented. After 15 years, Wikipedia has more than 41 million articles and has become the go-to source for information for billions of people.\n\n\"Wikipedia is part of the infrastructure of the world,\" Wales said. \"For an entire generation, it is part of the world they grew up in, and Wikipedia has grown up with them.\"\n\nHow has it worked? Wales said much of social media is \"obnoxious and very stressful,\" a place of noise and not a lot of quality. But Wikipedia, through a community of committed users, has established itself as a place of reasoned discourse which can provide lessons for politics and business, he said.\n\nFor example, Wikipedia's content providers pride themselves on authoritative articles, with no point of view, respecting copyrights, citing sources and remaining civil. It's also managed to stay fun.\n\nWales' previous venture, Nupedia, relied on a model of encyclopedic articles that were peer reviewed. But he said he realized when he actually dreaded writing an entry himself that the model would not work - because it wasn't fun.\n\nWikipedia now relies on a core of 3,000 to 5,000 volunteers who provide information, and a larger network of 80,000 who contribute at least five times a month. The company is working to make the writing and editing process more user friendly, he said.\n\nIt also survives on contributions, the vast majority from small donors. The average donation is $25, though the bulk range from $50 to $100.\n\nThe model needs some improvements, he admitted. For example, the average age of those volunteers is 26, and 87 percent of them are male. That doesn't result in overt sexism, he said, but users tend to write about things that they're interested in.\n\n\"A 26-year-old computer geek guy is comfortable speaking authoritatively about something we know nothing about,\" he joked.\n\nBut the model of participatory media, which has saturated the industrialized west, is also sweeping the developing world, as more regions get access to smart phones and better broadband access. One outreach has been Wikipedia Zero, which has encouraged Internet providers in the developing world not to levy data charges on Wikipedia. This gives people access to the site, and encourages them to use the Internet.\n\nWales said users in those parts of the world seem interested in doing the same thing other members of the \"information middle class\" do - sharing photographs and videos, checking Facebook and Twitter and checking news sites.\n\nThat makes for exciting opportunities, not just in the developing world, but globally.\n\n\"We make the Internet not suck,\" he said."
