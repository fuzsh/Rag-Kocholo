        "text": "Timeline\n\nLegislation to prosecute people accused of child cruelty has been in force since the 1880s. Over time a range of factors, including some high profile child abuse deaths and subsequent inquiries, have contributed to the development of the child protection system we have in the UK today.\n\nNow, statutory child protection guidance across the UK is regularly reviewed and updated in consultation with stakeholders.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a timeline of the key events that have taken place since 1945, leading to the development of today’s child protection system. We have provided links to legislation and publications where possible.\n\n> Find out more about the development of the child protection system in the UK by searching the NSPCC library catalogue\n\n1945 – The first child abuse inquiry\n\nThe first formal child death inquiry took place in England in 1945 into the death of Dennis O'Neill, who was killed at the age of 12 by his foster father.\n\n> Read more about the inquiry report on our library catalogue\n\n1946 – Curtis committee and Clyde committee\n\nThe Care of Children Committee, led by Dame Myra Curtis, investigated and made recommendations about how care was provided for children who weren’t able to live with their own parents or relatives in England and Wales.\n\nJames L. Clyde led the Committee on Homeless Children in Scotland, which had a similar remit.\n\nThe recommendations of both committees contributed to the development of the 1948 Children Act.\n\n1948 – Children Act\n\nThe Children Act 1948 (no longer available online) set out new support measures for children across the UK. Under the Act, local authorities had a duty to provide care for any child whose parents were unable to care for them, if this was in the child’s best interests.\n\n1973 – Reforms made to the child protection system\n\nAt the age of 7, Maria Colwell was killed by her step-father after being returned home from foster care. The public inquiry that followed her death found that Maria had been failed by the child protection system.\n\nThe need to improve the system contributed to the development of stronger measures to enable professionals working with children to recognise and respond to child abuse and neglect, including the Children Act 1975.\n\n> See our reading list on the reforms made to the child protection system following the death of Maria Colwell\n\n1975 – Children Act\n\nThe Children Act 1975 built on the 1945 Act and highlighted the importance of children’s welfare. It also established the role of an independent social worker who would ensure the best interests of the child during court proceedings.\n\n1984 – The transformation of child protection services\n\nFurther changes to child protection legislation were prompted partly by the inquiries into more child deaths, including 4-year-old Jasmine Beckford who was killed by her step-father after being returned home from care.\n\n1988 – Working together guidance first published\n\nThe first edition of Working Together consolidated guidance and recommendations on procedures for the care and protection of abused children and children at risk in England and Wales. Working together: a guide to arrangements for inter-agency co-operation for the protection of children from abuse (DHSS and Welsh Office, 1988)1 also introduced serious case reviews (SCRs), referred to at the time as case reviews, for the first time.\n\n> Read the guidance via our library catalogue\n\n1989 – Children Act for England and Wales\n\nThe Children Act 1989 established the legislative framework for the current child protection system in England and Wales. It sets out the paramountcy principle – that the welfare of the child should be the court’s main consideration.\n\n1990 – United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child\n\nThe UK signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which sets out the rights of every child in the world to survive, grow, participate and fulfil their potential.\n\n1991 – Working together guidance updated in response to the Children Act\n\nIn 1991, Working together under the Children Act 1989: a guide to arrangements for inter-agency co-operation for the protection of children from abuse was published (Home Office and Department of Health, 1991).2 It included the requirements of the Children Act 1989 as well as compiling previous guidance on child protection and best practice.\n\nGuidance had to be followed by local authority social services departments unless local circumstances indicated exceptional reasons which justified a change.\n\n> Read the guidance via our library catalogue\n\n1995 – Children Order and Act for Northern Ireland and Scotland\n\nThe Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 and the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 established the legislative framework for the current child protection systems in Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\n1997 – Criminal records checks\n\nPart V of the Police Act 1997 established a centralised system of criminal records checks across the UK.\n\n1999 – Devolution and major revision of Working together guidance\n\nSince 1999 the process of devolution has seen power and responsibility transferred from the Houses of Parliament in Westminster to national governments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n\n1999 also saw a revised version of the Working together guidance published for England. Working together to safeguard children: a guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children (PDF) (Department of Health, 1999)3 included guidance on working together to support children and families, lessons from research and experience, and definitions of abuse.\n\n2000 – Major changes in child protection policies\n\nThe death of 8-year-old Victoria Climbié, following abuse and neglect by her great-aunt and great-aunt’s boyfriend, led to Lord Laming’s report (Laming, 2003).4 This report contributed to sweeping changes to the way children's services were structured in England and Wales.\n\n> Read Lord Laming’s report via our library catalogue\n\nThree-year-old Kennedy McFarlane was killed by her mother’s boyfriend when he hit her, leading her to crash into the leg of a bed. Her death led to the Scottish education minister, Jack McConnell, announcing a review of child protection in Scotland (Scottish Executive, 2002).5\n\n> Read the Scottish Executive's report of the Child Protection Audit and Review via our library catalogue\n\n2001 – First Children’s Commissioner\n\nThe Children's Commissioner for Wales Act 2001 created the first children’s commissioner post in the UK.\n\n2002 – Reforms to child protection legislation\n\nHolly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both aged 10, were killed by Ian Huntley, their school caretaker. He had previously been investigated by police for crimes including burglary, indecent assault and rape.\n\nFollowing his conviction, an inquiry led by Michael Bichard recommended the development of a system where people are appropriately vetted before working with children. This led to the strengthening of legislation across the UK to protect children from adults who pose a risk to them, including the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, and the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order and Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act.\n\n> See our reading list about the reforms to child protection legislation following the deaths of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells\n\n2003 – National guidance and Children’s Commissioner in Northern Ireland, Children and Young People’s Commissioner for Scotland\n\nThe statutory guidance Cooperating to safeguard children and young people was published in Northern Ireland, to set out requirements for safeguarding children in the statutory, private, independent, community, voluntary and faith sectors (Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, 2002).6\n\nNorthern Ireland created the post of Commissioner for Children and Young People (NICCY).\n\nThe Commissioner for Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2003 established the role of Children and Young People’s Commissioner in Scotland.\n\n2004 – Children Act, UNCRC\n\nThe Children Act 2004, informed by Lord Laming’s report, established a Children’s Commissioner in England (the last of the UK nations to appoint one); created Local Safeguarding Children's Boards (LSCBs) in England and Wales; and placed a duty on local authorities in England to appoint a director of children’s services and an elected lead member for children’s services, who is ultimately accountable for the delivery of services.\n\nThe Welsh Government formally adopted the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) (Welsh Government, 2019).7\n\n2006 – Working together update, Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act and GIRFEC\n\nThe Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 was passed in England, Northern Ireland and Wales following the recommendations of the inquiry into the events surrounding the deaths of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002.\n\nScotland’s Minister for Children published a review of the Children’s Hearing System, entitled Getting it right for every child (GIRFEC) (PDF), highlighting a dramatic increase in identified children with multiple needs (Creegan, C., Henderson, and King, 2006).8\n\nWorking together to safeguard children (PDF), the statutory guidance for child protection in England was revised to incorporate changes in safeguarding policy and practice since 1999.
