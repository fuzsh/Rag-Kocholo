        "text": "Musk had blasted the company a few days earlier for apparently considering the deletion of a page about the so-called \"Twitter Files\" saying it has a \"left-wing bias.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, one user tweeted that Wikipedia was \"voting on the deletion of the entry for Elon Musk's Twitter Files,\" because editors considered it a \"nothing burger,\" that is \"not notable.\"\n\nThe user posted screenshots of Wikipedia editors voting on the deletion of the article with one saying the content of Hunter Biden's laptop was a \"nothing event about another nothing event.\"\n\nMusk responded saying: \"Most of Earth: 'The MSM is biased.' Wikipedia: 'Cite MSM source to confirm this claim.' Wikipedia has a non-trivial left-wing bias.\" He then tagged Wales asking \"what are your thoughts?\" Wales did not respond.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMusk had teased the release of the \"Twitter Files\" last week saying he would expose \"free speech suppression\" by the platform before he took over. Under Musk's instructions, journalist Matt Taibbi, published a thread of tweets on Friday showing internal communications between Twitter executives and Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nThe campaign had asked Twitter to remove leaked explicit pictures of Hunter Biden after he reportedly left his laptop at a Delaware repair shop. Posting the photos on Twitter constituted a violation of the company's revenge porn policy.\n\nCritics, however, viewed it as the social media platform's bias towards Democratic politicians, with Musk even calling it \"a violation of the Constitution's First Amendment.\"\n\nMusk fired Twitter's deputy general counsel James Baker on Tuesday, accusing him of secretly vetting the \"Twitter Files\" and engaging in \"suppression of information important to the public dialogue.\"\n\nIn an interview with i24NEWS in November, Wales said Musk's \"diagnosis of what's wrong with Twitter is completely wrong.\"\n\n\"Twitter has a real problem with trolling and abuse, it doesn't have a problem with not enough freedom of expression,\" he added.\n\nWikipedia did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment about Wales' tweet."
