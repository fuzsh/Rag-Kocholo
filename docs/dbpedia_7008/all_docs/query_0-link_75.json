Also, the founder of the Discovery Channel Family is John Hendricks, also from HSV. Dr. Mike Brown, the dethroner of Pluto to dwarf status is from here (I do at least know his mom). And, on the lighter side, Holbrook, the writer of \"On The Fastrack,\" is from here. (Again, I know his dad.) It's modeled roughly on the Intergraph Corporation here. In one inside joke, one of the characters, Art Welder (euphemism for a ham-handed sloppy programmer) looks out the back of a trailer and says \"Does this place feel sort of temporary to you.\" The license plate clearly starts with \"47,\" which is what our Madison County plates starts with. That's a reference to the thousands of tech people continually moving in and out of Huntsville..."
