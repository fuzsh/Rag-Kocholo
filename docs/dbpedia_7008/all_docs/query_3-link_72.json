        "text": "Synopsis\n\nWikipedia founder Jimmy Wales believes relief may be in sight for the beleaguered news media industry.\n\nCERNOBBIO (ITALY): Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales believes relief may be in sight for the beleaguered news media industry.\n\nThe increasing use of the mobile Internet and for-pay \"apps\" that run on smart phones and other gadgets might give news providers what they've been searching for: a way to charge for digital content, Wales said in an interview on Friday.\n\nAs founder of one of the world's most popular websites, the 44-year-old American is a key Internet entrepreneur.\n\n\"The apps model - the iPad app, the Kindle - does provide new and interesting opportunities for newspapers,\" he said, speaking on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti Forum, an annual gathering of business and political leaders on the shores of Italy's Lake Como.\n\n\"If I just click on my iPad, and it's billed on my normal bill, that micropayment model makes it possible for people to have an impulse purchase,\" he said.\n\nNewspaper and magazine publishers have been charging on a subscription basis for content on Amazon.com Inc.'s Kindle e-readers. Many publishers are experimenting with a system that lets people download an app, then pay for each new issue.\n\nDiscover the stories of your interest\n\nBlockchain\n\n5 Stories\n\nCyber-safety\n\n7 Stories\n\nFintech\n\n9 Stories\n\nE-comm\n\n9 Stories\n\nML\n\n8 Stories\n\nEdtech\n\n6 Stories\n\nSome media companies have discussed using a micropayment system instead, where readers pay a few cents every time they click on an article. The charge could be either debited from a prepaid account or folded into the wireless bill for a device such as Apple Inc's iPad.\n\nSo far, micropayments haven't taken off. Wales believes both models can work, but said he expects subscriptions will remain more popular.\n\n\"I'm not going to pull out my credit card out of my wallet,\" he said. \"It's way too much trouble, but if I have a way of just clicking and I get it and I pay a little, it's worth it.\"\n\nWhile the Wikipedia founder is optimistic about people's willingness to pay for content through dedicated apps, he said he is sceptical about newspapers charging for content on websites.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, has been the most successful at charging for access, and the media mogul recently extended the model to the Times of London. News Corp has not disclosed details about the impact on traffic and overall revenue for the British news website.\n\nWales' view is that charging for desktop Web access, where there is no payment system as convenient as the mobile phone bill, would remain a challenge.\n\n15 Atmanirbhar stocks to include in your portfolio this Independence Day\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\nThree reasons why Tata Motors has taken a contrarian view on hybrids\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
