That’s not correct, by the way; everything is not always going to be great. But that’s the way I feel and approach things.” — Jimmy Wales\n\n“If you design for the worst people, then you’re failing design for good people.” — Jimmy Wales\n\n“A great Wikipedian, in my view, is someone who really takes seriously the values and ideas of Wikipedia, like neutrality for example, quality for example, reliable sources. And they take all those things as more important than any particular, say, political opinion they might have.” — Jimmy Wales\n\n“We’ve got a lot of problems on this planet. We need as many smart, educated people to figure them out as we possibly can.” — Jimmy Wales\n\n“Try not to be a troll on the internet.” — Jimmy Wales\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, Stitcher, Castbox, Google Podcasts, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nPEOPLE MENTIONED\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nKira Namiko Wales\n\nHarry Potter\n\nMadalyn Murray O’Hair\n\nSanta Claus\n\nG.I.
