        "text": "In a flash of fire and smoke,a remnant of the old Tappan Zee Bridge fell into the Hudson River, its six decades of service now complete while a shinier successor takes its place.\n\nThe east anchor span of the bridge dropped into the Hudson River around 10:52 a.m. Tuesday with a flash of fire and a fall into the river that lasted a few seconds. Black smoke quickly enveloped the wreckage, which remained above water level - held up by chains to prevent it from sinking. A loud boom carried across the area seconds after the explosion and could be heard as far away as Mahopac.\n\nHundreds of people gathered at various vantage points along both sides of the Hudson to watch the bridge's last moments.\n\nNow that the east anchor span has been demolished, what’s next?\n\nHere are four bridge-related developments to watch for in the coming months.\n\n1. What happens to the tons of steel that dropped into the Hudson River Tuesday?\n\nIt will be captured by steel chains that were laid on the riverbed ahead of the explosion and, in the months to come, marine salvage experts will load it onto barges and haul it away. Several large fuel tanks that were on the old bridge were removed before the demolition. Any fuel that remains will be captured by remediation specialists trained to prevent fuel from leaking into the river, according to the environmental group Riverkeeper.\n\n2. When will the west anchor span come down?\n\nSpectators who gathered in Piermont Tuesday morning stuck around after the explosion to await the takedown of the west anchor span. They were disappointed. Contractors will stick to the original script for taking down the old bridge and pick apart the remains of the bridge piece by piece with the assistance of massive waterborne cranes. That work is expected to take place later this year but a precise date hasn’t been set.\n\n3. When will the shared-use bicycle and pedestrian path open on the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge?\n\nGood question. Also sometime this year, according to state officials. “When this scenic path opens next year, residents and visitors will have unprecedented views of the enduring beauty of the lower Hudson River Valley, along with more ways to cross the majestic river,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said last October.\n\nThe 12-foot path will include a lane each for pedestrians and cyclists and six overlooks. Still to be decided is whether the path will remain open 24 hours a day or shut down overnight. Bicycle advocates want it open 24/7. Residents of South Nyack prefer that it close at night.\n\n4. When will we find out the toll for the new bridge?\n\nAnother good question. Tolls on the new bridge — currently $5; $4.75 with E-ZPass – have been frozen until at least 2020. State officials have not said how high tolls will need to go to pay for the $3.9 billion bridge, but they will be going up.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cuomo weighed in from Albany after watching the explosion of the old bridge in the state Capitol. \"We’re going to have a commission that is going to look at the tolls, and I don’t believe the toll on this bridge, per se, is going to be a challenge,\" Cuomo told reporters.\n\nTransportation analysts say the bridge toll could go as high as $11, which would still be cheaper than the $12.50 toll on the George Washington Bridge ($10.50 with E-ZPass).\n\n“I think the greater challenge is what we’re going to talk about later on: Tolls in the metropolitan area and what is your rationale, logical toll scheme, not just for individual crossings, but for the entire region,\" Cuomo continued. \"Because it has to work as a region.\"\n\nIf not for some $2 billion the state recouped from bank settlements that was diverted to the state Thruway Authority, future tolls would likely be even higher, analysts say. The last toll hike for the authority, which operates the Cuomo Bridge, was in 2010, a year before Cuomo took office. They went up 5 percent.\n\nTOLLS: What about Mario Cuomo Bridge tolls?
