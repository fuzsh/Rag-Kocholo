        "text": "So Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office dismisses as “partisan” the petition to keep the historic name of the Tappan Zee Bridge.\n\nI first heard about the petition at a meeting filled with Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, registered independents like me, and people who care about none of the above, except insofar as it’s necessary to preserve the Hudson Valley’s rich and diverse history.\n\nIt was the Oct. 27 meeting of the Tappantown Historical Society, which made some history of its own back in the 1960s. Faced with the imminent destruction of Tappan’s historic center to accommodate a strip mall, the Society spearheaded the creation of the Tappan Historic District, the first of its kind in New York state.\n\nCUOMO'S OFFICE: Petition to rename bridge is 'partisan'\n\nEDITORIAL: Can we forge a Cuomo-Tappan Zee compromise?\n\nPETITION: Keep Tappan Zee name\n\n“Tappan Zee” means “Tappan Sea” in Dutch, in a reference to how wide and sea-like the Hudson River is at that point. The word “Tappan” is a Dutch construct of a term best rendered in our alphabet as “Tappaen,” a Lenape name for the natives who once inhabited a 60-mile swath of the Hudson’s western bank, as far west as the Hackensack River. “Tappaen” probably means “cold water stream.”\n\nIn a lecture to the Society, author and Lenape historian Evan Pritchard described how the Tappaen most likely greeted the very first Europeans to settle in the Lower Hudson Valley. And contrary to popular belief, their influence was not restricted solely to the Rockland side of the river.\n\nThe Tappaen specialized in carving makeshift boats out of tulip trees, which were then abundant in the area, Pritchard told us. More than three and a half centuries before the first E-Z Pass, the Tappaen ran 16 ferries at various east-west points across the Hudson, from the Highlands all the way down to present-day Jersey City. Communipaw Avenue, still a major Jersey City thoroughfare, takes its name from the Tappaen term for “crossing to the other side.” Long before anyone dreamed of the Holland Tunnel, the foot of Communipaw was the site of a Tappaen ferry to what is now Fulton Street in Manhattan.\n\nThe Dutch took over the old Tappaen ferries by treaty. The British succeeded the Dutch. We succeeded the British. When we built a bridge to succeed the ferries, Averell Harriman was governor of New York. Gov. Harriman had the good taste not to name the bridge after his father, E. H. Harriman, who arguably contributed far more to America’s transportation legacy through his ownership of the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nI knew and liked Mario Cuomo when I was a reporter. But his legacy is tied to neither Rockland nor Westchester. He was from Queens, and he loved to tout that fact.\n\nOf the East River bridges leading out of Queens, we now have one named after former Mayor Ed Koch, another named after former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nAnd so, a modest proposal — if, indeed, we really want to name another river crossing after a politician. Instead of the Tappan Zee, why not the Mario Cuomo Whitestone Bridge?\n\nThe writer, a former New York TV reporter, is a member of the Tappantown Historical Society."
