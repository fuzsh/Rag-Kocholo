        "text": "By contrast, the physical impact of the bridge in Tarrytown was far less extensive. Only a few small homes and one large estate - Hawthorne – had to come down to make room for construction of the new bridge. The social and economic impact of the bridge in Tarrytown and the adjoining communities in Westchester County, however, was substantial. The addition of the Tappan Zee to Westchester’s transportation corridor attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in new residential development to house a growing population, along with large-scale commercial construction for corporate giants such as General Motors, General Foods, and IBM. The opening in 1960 of the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287) linked Rockland and Westchester with Connecticut and New England, and paved the way for a new corporate mecca parallel to I-287, known today as the Platinum Mile."
