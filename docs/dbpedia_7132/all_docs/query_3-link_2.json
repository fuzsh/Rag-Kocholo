        "text": "1: Causeway\n\nStarting in South Nyack, the longest section was the 8,739-foot causeway, a concrete deck supported by horizontal steel beams resting on reinforced concrete columns spaced every 50 feet. With 166 spans in total, the simple span construction was also comprised of a stringer and deck superstructure, as well as footings on timber piles\n\n3: main span\n\nThe main span section of the bridge, over the navigation channel, comprised two anchor spans (1,204 feet) and two cantilevers flanking a suspended center span (1,212 feet), with the two anchor spans resting on columns supported by mid-sized buoyant caissons measuring 126.5 feet by 77 feet by 40 feet. The cantilever sections rested on the largest buoyant caissons measuring 190 feet by 100 feet by 40 feet. All the caissons in this section were secured by steel piles driven to bedrock.\n\nBridge-builder Mastery\n\nThe extraordinary innovation of the bridge design can easily overshadow the skill and innovation used to build the bridge. Not unlike the Governor Mario M Cuomo Bridge, some of the 1955 Tappan Zee Bridge was prefabricated and transported to site for installation. For example, the rectangular caissons that supported the main span crossing of the navigation channel: eight watertight concrete boxes the size of small buildings — some 40 feet tall — and then move them 12 miles downriver. The ingenious approach meant more easily constructing the caissons in a deep basin along the shoreline in Havestraw, flooding them to make them float, easing them into the river and using tugboats to guide them to the bridge construction site."
