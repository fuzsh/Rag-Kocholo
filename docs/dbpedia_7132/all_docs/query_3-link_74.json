        "text": "TARRYTOWN, N.Y. — The end is in sight for the old Tappan Zee.\n\nThis now-haggard bridge, whose three-mile glide over the brisk, choppy waters of the Hudson River north of New York City thrilled children seeing the bridge for the first time in the mid 1950s, and at its peak did the brute work of carrying almost 140,000 cars a day, is growing thinner, shorter and more fragile.\n\nHaving lost its reason for being when traffic was shifted to one of two cockily stylish twin replacement spans, its steel and concrete sections are being picked apart by crews of ironworkers and shipped off for use in other bridges and highways like kidneys and livers destined for organ transplants.\n\nIt is no longer even a bridge, its two ends having been lopped off, leaving immense voids that extend from each bank of the Hudson. The fact that it is now stranded in the water openly declares that after 62 years the bridge’s time is up.\n\nThe Tappan Zee is being supplanted by what has formally been christened the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, named after the father of the current governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, who jump-started the long-delayed, $4 billion project in 2013. The first new span started carrying eight lanes of two-way traffic in October between Westchester and Rockland Counties. But traffic will be scaled down to four Rockland-bound lanes once the second Westchester-bound span is completed, which is supposed to occur in June. Both spans will then have wide shoulders to accommodate broken-down vehicles and eventually a pedestrian and bike path.\n\nThe operative verb for breaking up the old Tappan Zee is dismantle not demolish. Demolish, with its connotations of a thunderous explosion, is what happened to the old Kosciuszko Bridge in New York City when its steel ramps went down in puffs of gray smoke in a carefully controlled detonation. But the Kosciuszko hopped over the rather narrow and stagnant Newtown Creek, while the Tappan Zee stretches over a pulsing, vital river prized by both ships and aquatic life.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
