        "text": "For decades, it's been well documented that the infrastructure of New York City and its surrounding area is in dire need of updates. From its airports to its roads and crossings, commuters would often have a big headache when it came to the constant construction work done to maintain its aging framework. Which is why New Yorkers are excited by the news that the Tappan Zee Bridge—a structure that stretches the Hudson River to connect Westchester County with the rest of the state—is finally partially opening a new 3.1 mile bridge this Saturday. Commuters traveling west from Westchester to Rockland County will be able to cross the Hudson on the new span. Anyone traveling eastbound will still have to use the existing bridge for a few more months.\n\nAfter years of construction by some 7,000 workers, the $4 billion project will be coming to an end. The new structure, which will be named after Mario M. Cuomo, New York's former three-term governor, looks like something out of the future next to the old one, which is several hundred feet away from it. In metaphorical terms, it's the 20th century next to the 21st century. But really, the new overpass is a sleekly designed, two-span cable-stayed structure that contains more than 1,000 cylindrical piles that were planted into the Hudson riverbed. Roughly 330,000 cubic yards of concrete were poured in construction, including 6,000 precast concrete road deck panels. The main decks are held up by 192 cables stretched among eight 419-foot angled towers. The bridge will handle 140,000 vehicles a day, with the first ones entering early Saturday morning, shortly after midnight.\n\nWhat's next for New York when it comes to major infrastructure projects? Finishing up the renovations of LaGuardia and JFK airports and Penn Station."
