        "text": "The Fife Brook trip runs on a beautiful section of the Deerfield River with mostly Class I & II rapids and ending with the exciting Class III Zoar Gap rapid. This trip meets at our base in Charlemont, Massachusetts and includes the essential equipment - a paddle, helmet, and PFD (personal floatation device). All guests will be required to wear the Berkshire Whitewater issued PFD and helmet. Please be on time for your trip as we must work within scheduled whitewater release times. The exact meeting times will be in your confirmation email. Participants will also be required to read and sign a release of liability prior to the trip. Lunch is not included on the Fife Brook rafting trip, however, The Backyard BBQ and full service Crazy Horse Bar & Grill are located conveniently onsite with options for the whole family!\n\nExpect everything you bring with you on the raft to get wet! In warm summer weather, some guests are comfortable in bathing suits/swim trunks or light layers. However, we ask you to not wear cotton, as it will keep you cold and wet throughout the trip. Guests are not allowed to wear jeans on the river. Wool and synthetic materials such as polypropylene, nylon, and fleece, are appropriate for cooler weather and water temperatures.\n\nWetsuits and neoprene river booties are available for rental if you need them. You are required to wear sneakers or other shoes that can be secured to your feet. No flip-flops or Crocs! Bring any required medications as well as extra money for souvenirs, food, gratuities, etc. Before the trip, please leave any and all valuables including money as well as your dry clothes and towels for after the trip in your locked vehicle. Keep your car keys with you during registration, as we will collect those and put them in a lock box before gearing up, then return them to you when you get off the boats.\n\nThe Monroe Bridge section of the Deerfield River is the most exciting river rafting in Massachusetts! A narrow river bed that continually drops over the course of five miles through class III and IV whitewater. Non-stop action from put-in to take-out is what you’ll get on the Monroe Bridge section of the Deerfield river. The rapids crescendo with the biggest rapid of the day, “Dragon’s Tooth” – which leads directly into the longest rapid, a labyrinth of whitewater and boulders known to our guides as “Terminator.”\n\nThe Monroe Bridge Dryway trip runs on the upper section of the Deerfield River with thrilling Class III & IV rapids!
