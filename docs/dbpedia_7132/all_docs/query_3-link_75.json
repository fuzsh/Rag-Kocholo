        "text": "WATSONVILLE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Granite Construction Incorporated (NYSE:GVA) confirmed today that the New York State Thruway Board voted to award to Tappan Zee Constructors, a team led by Fluor Enterprises, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR), Granite Construction Northeast, Inc., American Bridge Company, and Traylor Bros., Inc. the multi-billion dollar, design-build contract for the new Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project.\n\nThe $3.14 billion bridge concept and proposal submitted by Tappan Zee Constructors was one of three presented to the public on December 5, 2012. The bridge design submitted by the winning team is an efficient solution that utilizes a shallow superstructure and a 350’ long-span design to minimize the number of piers, provide a sleeker looking bridge that enhances the view of the corridors within the Hudson Valley, and reduce the environmental impacts. The main span is a composite deck cable-stayed structural system with outwardly inclined main span towers that can accommodate future transit system loads.\n\nThe 3.1-mile-long Tappan Zee Bridge connects Rockland County to Westchester County in the Lower Hudson Valley (approximately 25 miles north of midtown Manhattan) and is a vital transportation link that serves approximately 138,000 vehicles per day. The mega-project will be the single largest bridge project in New York’s history.\n\nGranite will book its 23.3 percent share of the project into backlog once a final contract is approved and a notice to proceed is issued. Construction will take approximately five years.\n\nAbout Granite\n\nGranite is one of the nation’s largest infrastructure contractors and construction materials producers serving public- and private-sector clients nationwide. In addition, Granite has one of the oldest and most robust ethics and compliance programs in the industry. In 2012, the Company was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the third year in a row.
