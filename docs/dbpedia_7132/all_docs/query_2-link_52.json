        "text": "Project Description\n\nThe 3.1-mile-long twin spans of the Tappan Zee Bridge, also known as the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, will include eight general traffic lanes, four emergency lanes, a dedicated commuter bus lane, state-of-the-art traffic monitoring systems, and a shared-use path for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nAn iconic 1,500-foot cable-stayed main span will provide 139 feet of vertical clearance to accommodate large shipping vessels. The foundations will support future rail or bus transit, and the entire structure is designed to achieve a 100-year service life without major maintenance.\n\nThe Tappan Zee Bridge is part of a vital economic east-west corridor just north of Manhattan. Spanning the Hudson River, the new structures will replace a 70-year-old, structurally deficient, functionally obsolete bridge, which carries 138,000 vehicles per day on a design capacity of 100,000 vehicles per day.\n\nWhat makes it interesting?\n\nWith a lump-sum design-build price of $3.14 billion, the Tappan Zee Bridge project is the largest transportation design-build project to date in the United States, the largest highway and bridge project in North America, and one of the largest construction contracts in New York State history. The structure is designed to achieve a 100-year service life without major maintenance."
