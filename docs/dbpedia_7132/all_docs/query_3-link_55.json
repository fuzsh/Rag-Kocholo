As the longest and most complex crossing in the New York State Thruway system, it will have the ability to support more lanes, a pedestrian and bicycle path and even a proposed mass-transit system. Myers and Sons Construction will be a subcontractor applying a Polyester Concrete overlay to the entire deck, this work will take place over three years."
