        "text": "The new Tappan Zee Bridge has been designed for current commuters and future generations. The new bridge is a visually striking, recognizable landmark, and one of the widest cable-stayed structures of its kind in the world. It includes eight general traffic lanes, four breakdown/emergency lanes, a bike and pedestrian path, and state-of-the-art traffic monitoring systems as well as space for dedicated bus lanes from the day the bridge is fully opened. Designed and constructed to be mass-transit ready, the new crossing accommodates bus rapid transit, light rail, or commuter rail.\n\nThe construction of six new belvederes, or scenic overlooks, that are part of the new bridge’s shared bike and pedestrian path bring much-needed outdoor social space to the Lower Hudson Valley. These resting points reflect the culture and history of the area and provide a new connection for non-motorized transport in the region, offering an exciting recreational opportunity that doesn’t currently exist in Rockland or Westchester counties.\n\nThe belvederes each have a unique theme and name—Fish and Ships, Painter’s Point, River Crossing, Half Moon, Tides of Tarrytown, and Palisades—illustrated by different design concepts, which required the construction of one-of-a-kind sculpted seating areas of stainless steel, glass, granite and wood. EW Howell worked with specialty engineers and the project architect, HDR, to develop final designs for the glass parapet enclosure, to provide unobstructed views from each belvedere. This was a challenge due to the strict tolerances of the bridge, wind load requirements, and bridge deck curved contour profiles."
