        "text": "Notes About Hiking to the Dry Brook Ridge Trail\n\nTRAIL Water sources are the biggest problem on this particular hike. While the trail can be muddy at certain points, a good water source for drinking water is a significant problem. Most hikers start at the Balsam Lake Mountain Parking Area instead of on the side of the road in Margaretville.\n\nThe section of Dry Brook Ridge Trail from the (upper trail) Fire Tower to the Dry Brook Ridge Trail goes across private property. There is also a small section of the trail after the Dry Brook Parking Area that is also on private property. Please stay on the trail while you hike in this section of the Dry Brook Ridge Trail.\n\nSome people like to take the option of visiting the Fire Tower at the beginning of the hike. It also provides the benefit of obtaining water. It adds 0.67 miles to the hike. Many people really like the Fire Tower, and it can become quite crowded on summer weekends.\n\nIn the Winter months, the section between View Point #1 and View Point #2 would be dangerous due to ledge exposure. The most dangerous section could be avoided by hiking higher up on the ridge.\n\nWATER SOURCES One of your major concerns for this hike should be having enough water. There are very few places to obtain water on the Dry Brook Ridge Trail. So BEWARE and plan carefully! Here a few options:\n\n1. Bring water with you to the Balsam Lake Mountain Trailhead.\n\n2. Take the Balsam Lake Mountain Trail. Spring is about 1-1/2 miles from the Balsam Lake Trailhead. Disadvantage is that the trail is steep, and it adds 0.67 miles to your hike. Advantage is that you get to visit the Balsam Lake Mountain Fire Tower, which has nice views.\n\n3. Stay at the Mill Brook Lean-to instead of the Dry Brook Lean-to. Advantage is that it has water. Disadvantage is that it adds 2 miles to your overall hike. the other option is to hike the 3/4 of a mile west on Mill Brook Road to obtain water at the trailhead to Mill Brook Lean-to.\n\n4. Many people believe that they can obtain water at the Dry Brook Lean-to because a stream is close to the Lean-to. The stream is on private property, and the owner has security cameras and No Trespassing signs. You CANNOT get water at the Dry Brook Lean-to.\n\n5. Shortly after the passing the Dry Brook Parking Area, there is a small stream that runs across the second section of the Dry Brook Ridge Trail. It can be dry in the summer months. So beware!\n\n6. The next place you can get water is 7-8 miles away and 2.5 miles before the end of the hike. The water source is off the Dry Brook Ridge Trail on the German Hollow Trail.\n\nPARKING There are a number of parking strategies you can employee for this hike. As a general rule, this hike requires that you have two cars. Parking at Balsam Lake Mountain Parking Area is required for one of your cars to start the hike.\n\nThe problem is parking on the side of South Side Road in Margaretville, NY. Some people do not like to leave their car on the side of the road overnight.\n\nOption #1: To get around this problem, some people will park their second car at the Dry Brook Parking Area and stay overnight at the Mill Brook Lean-to. The next morning they will retrieve their car from the Balsam Lake Mountain Parking Area and place it at the South Side Road to be retrieved later in the day.\n\nOption #2: They will park their second car at one of the two the DEC Parking Area on Huckleberry Brook Road, or at the parking area on Hill Road. This option would require that they modify their hike. After they have visited the three view points on Dry Brook Ridge, they would exit the Dry Brook Ridge Trail about a mile after the third view point, and descend down the north side of the Huckleberry Loop Trail.\n\nOption #3: Park your second car across the Delaware River in Margaretville, NY. The Margaretville Municipal Parking Area holds 100 cars and allows overnight parking. It is 1/3 of a mile from the Trailhead via the Margaretville Village Trail. See maps above.
