        "text": "On a brisk, mid-autumn day, Gayle Churchill walked slowly through the tunnel-like structure that crosses the Wallkill River.\n\nShe studied each crisscrossing post and beam forming the interior framework of Perrine’s covered bridge, often pausing in moments of reflection as if it were a sort of rustic cathedral.\n\nTraffic, meanwhile, rushed by on the nearby New York State Thruway.\n\nWhile Churchill soaked in the details, her husband had descended the riverbank to get a better view of the 138-foot-long span and snap photos of it arising from the water and surrounding golden foliage.\n\nThe couple from George West, Texas, was visiting New York for the first time last week and stopped to visit the bridge built by Rosencrans Wood in 1844.\n\n“I’ve never seen one this big,” Churchill said. “I love it. I love old things, historical things.”\n\nPerrine’s Bridge in Esopus is said to be the second oldest covered bridge in New York next to the 1823 Hyde Hall Bridge at Glimmerglass State Park in Otsego County.\n\nAt almost any time of the day or year, tourists can be found at the Ulster County landmark named after James W. Perrine, who ran a tavern on the east side of where it now stands.\n\nDesigned in the Burr-arch style, Perrine’s Bridge was named to the National Register of Historic Places in April of 1973.\n\n“That bridge in particular seems to draw a lot of interest,” said Rick Remsnyder, the director of Ulster County Tourism.\n\n“There’s a little turnoff there, and a lot of people go there to shoot photos and walk the bridge because it’s almost like a step back in time, and they seem to be drawn by the romanticism of the bridge.”\n\nTruly, that is part of their lure.\n\nUsing one’s imagination, it is easy to envision 19th-century horse-drawn carriages crossing at a leisurely pace in a less-complicated world.\n\nPerhaps they are mill workers toting lumber or lovers anxious to steal their first kiss (covered bridges are known as “kissing bridges”).\n\nMaybe one sees a family hauling a freshly cut Christmas tree back to the homestead in the countryside.\n\nWhatever image comes to mind, covered bridges are a reminder a bygone era and remain a popular attraction for those wanting a connection to the past.\n\nThese relics in Ulster County-most of them dating back to the 19th century-represent the 10th in our monthly series “Destinations.”\n\nAlthough they are a rare find these days, that was not always the case.\n\nAuthor Brenda Krekeler notes in her book “Covered Bridges Today” that there once were 12,000 across the United States, mostly in New England and the Midwest.\n\nToday, there are less than 900 left, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nCovered bridges are most abundant today in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Vermont, which have more than 550 collectively.\n\nNew York state once had 250 covered bridges, but most of them fell into disrepair and were torn down or replaced. Only 24 original bridges survived.\n\nIn the Mid-Hudson Valley and Catskills, authentic structures can be found in Ulster, Delaware and Sullivan counties.\n\nUlster has seven covered bridges, five of which are historic; Sullivan County has six, five of them historic; and Delaware County boasts five historic bridges, according to Robert W. Folk on his website “Covered Bridges of New York” (www.bridges-covered.com).\n\nThough that may seem like a fair amount, when one considers how common they once were, it puts things into perspective.\n\nAt one time, Ulster County had 35, stretching from Shandaken to Wawarsing, notes David Guay, the historian at the New York State Covered Bridges Society.\n\nThe seven standing today include Perrine’s; Turnwood in Olive; the Forge, Tappan, Grants Mills and Myers bridges in Hardenburgh; and Friendship Manor in Shandaken.\n\nThe Myers and Friendship Manor bridges are not historic structures.\n\nSurprisingly, neighboring counties no longer have covered bridges, Guay noted.\n\n“Looking at the records that I have shows that Columbia had six covered bridges, Dutchess had five covered bridges (and) Greene had seven covered bridges,” he said.\n\nOnly Ulster, Guay pointed out, has any authentic trussed covered bridges left.\n\nLocal craftsmen constructed them using the natural resources of the areas in which they were built, the historian said.\n\n“They found early on that by protecting the trusses, or ‘bones’ of a wooden bridge, they could extend the life of the structure sometimes 10 times longer than leaving the trusses exposed to the elements,” he said.\n\nIt turned out to be a wise move.\n\n“You didn’t have to replace the bridge every 10-plus years,” Guay said. “Instead, investing in the covering of the truss and repairing that periodically saved vast amounts of money.”\n\nGuay said most of the covered bridges were rated for three to five tons-more than what was required in their heyday.\n\n“Now these gems…are still standing. This is a testament to the building skills of a long-gone time,” he said.\n\nLocal historians like Elizabeth Werlau have studied and written about the area’s covered bridges, particularly Perrine’s.\n\nThe Plattekill town historian said they are magnets because of their historical connection to America’s rural heritage.\n\n“It’s a way of life that’s gone, but it’s captured for a moment in the covered bridges,” said Werlau of Marlborough.\n\nPerrine’s is one of Ulster County’s most popular because of its accessibility, she said.\n\n“It seems like a very inviting place, and people especially like this one. It is set up like a park, and it invites the public to go across,” she said.\n\nThat is not the case for some of the county’s other covered bridges.\n\nFour of them-the Forge, Tappan/Kittle, Grants Mills and Myers-are tucked away off the winding Dry Brook Road in the town of Hardenburgh.\n\nThe Forge is privately owned by former U.S. Ambassador Kingdon Gould Jr., the great-grandson of railroad tycoon Jay Gould, according to Betty Baker, a 58-year Hardenburgh resident and former tax collector.\n\n“He bought it from the town and one of his sons, Caleb, restored it in 1976,” she said.\n\nThe single-span, kingpost-designed bridge is 27-feet-long and was built in 1906 by Salem Jerome Moot, Baker said.\n\nThough it can be viewed from the road, the bridge is not open to the public.\n\nNot far from the Forge stands the 43-foot Tappan covered bridge, which also crosses Dry Brook.\n\nIt, too, was built by Moot in the kingpost design, according to Baker. The bridge is owned by the town of Hardenburgh.\n\nPerhaps the most spectacular of the four in the town of Hardenburgh is the 66-foot Grants Mills, which is officially known as the Millbrook Bridge.\n\nA short distance from the Delaware County line, the bridge was built by Edgar Marks and Wesley Alton in 1902, Baker said.\n\nRobert Vredenbergh, the great grandson of the builders, began restoring the bridge in 1990 and completed it in 1992, she said.\n\nAfter Tropical Storm Irene, additional work was needed to reinforce stones on the abutments, according to Baker.\n\nThe only non-original covered bridge in the Hardenburgh area is the 40-foot Myers, which is a mile from the Tappan.\n\nBaker said the original kingpost structure on that spot was built by Moot in 1906. In 1990, it was rebuilt by Drexel Eagle as a steel stringer bridge and a cover was added, she said.\n\nAnother original structure worth seeing in Ulster County is Turnwood, also known as the Ashokan Bridge, built in 1889 by Nelson Tomkins.\n\nNamed to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, the 62-foot bridge was moved to the scenic Ashokan Center in 1930.\n\nTo get there, pedestrians must descend the covered-bridge trail, but the hike is worth the effort.\n\nThe latticed, single-span bridge crosses the old channel of the Esopus Creek, making it a good spot for romantic walks, contemplation or photos.\n\n“There’s nothing like it,” said Molly Mason, the vice president of the Ashokan Center board. “You can photograph out to the falls and the Esopus as it flows under it, and it’s beautiful every season of the year. It’s a gracious old building.”\n\nMason said its history has a bit of intrigue.\n\n“The town of Turnwood had a newer bridge put in and was likely going to tear down the original structure and burn it, but the man who lived here at the time bought it for $1 and hired people to move it to Ashokan and put it back together,” she said.\n\nThough it survived demolition, many others did not, and that is something Ulster County Historian Anne Gordon laments.\n\n“People want to modernize, they want to look up-to-date (and) get rid of these old-fashioned relics,” she said.\n\n“Then, sooner or later, somebody thinks, ‘No, history has value, and these need to be protected.’\n\n“I think their survival is wonderful and the fact that there are these societies interested in their preservation. These old bridges are treasured for their charm and their attractiveness as well as their history,” she said.\n\nPerrine’s Bridge was one of the lucky ones.\n\nA committee formed in the 1960s to preserve it, and with the help of matching grants from the Ulster County Legislature and the New York State Historical Trust, restoration work was completed in 1969, according to Werlau. Additional work was done in the 1990s.\n\n“Today, the bridge remains open to the public and marks a spot along the Wallkill that is popular for fishing and kayaking,” she said.\n\nRemsnyder enjoys the location and said that all of Ulster’s covered bridges are irreplacable gems.\n\n“I don’t know of too many counties in the state that have six covered bridges,” he said.\n\n“We are fortunate, and I hope they continue to be an important part of our history and tourism.”"
