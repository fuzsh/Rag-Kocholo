        "text": "Joey Febles couldn’t help but stare.\n\nThe Pearl River native was among the first Rockland-bound motorists to travel on the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge hours after the first span was opened.\n\nAlthough the Hudson River crossing was free of traffic around 8 a.m., Febles said he was in no rush to conclude his “very smooth” ride to the Rockland side.\n\n“I slowed down a little bit. I was going like 20 (mph) just soaking it in! &mldr; It looks very modern,” Febles said shortly after 10 a.m. as he was entering the Palisades Center with his sister, Tiffany Marroquin, and her son, Niko, 7.\n\nNEWLY MINTED: No problems as Gov. Cuomo Bridge opens to first traffic\n\nECHOES: New bridge opening echoes 1955 Tappan Zee Bridge celebrations\n\nFACTS: Gov. Mario M. Cuomo bridge opening: FAQ\n\nDays after a celebration marked the completion of the first span, four lanes were opened to traffic on the Mario at 5:35 a.m. Saturday.\n\nRockland-bound drivers will never again view the river from the heights of the Tappan Zee Bridge. But Westchester-bound drivers will continue to cross the old bridge until the fall, at which time they also will move over to the new bridge.\n\nThe entire project is expected to be completed sometime in 2018.\n\nChristina and William Clow of White Plains also took their maiden trip on the Mario on its opening day.\n\n“It was a great feeling going across,” Christina Clow said outside the Palisades Center that morning. “It’s been something just to watch it from the beginning.\"\n\nWilliam Clow chalked up the slow flow of traffic they encountered on the bridge around 10 a.m. to gawkers, but it gave him a chance to look, too.\n\n“The view was beautiful. It was higher than the other bridge, the old Tappan Zee,” William Clow said.\n\nDrivers were not alone in appreciating the immense infrastructure.\n\nRon Davis of Ramsey, New Jersey, said he trekked to Tarrytown's Pierson Park in the wee hours of the morning to gaze his fill of the bridge. He would take the Mario on his way home.\n\n“It’s a great looking bridge, great design and a new 21st-century bridge replacing this dilapidated, but useful, old Tappan Zee Bridge,\" Davis said. \"This is very exciting. &mldr; This is a special day.”\n\nLucian Chen of Tarrytown, who was also at Pierson Park that morning, said the bridge's construction was something he lived with – literally.\n\nChen said the apartment complex he lived in near the bridge had sound-proof doors and windows installed due to the work. He planned to take the Mario on Sunday.\n\n“In the beginning, it was really loud and everyone was scared and I think property prices dipped a little,\" Chen said. \"Now that everyone sees the end in sight, things are better again and it’s much quieter.”\n\nBut Chen worried about the prospect of higher tolls on the bridge. Tolls will remain at $5 by mail and $4.75 by E-ZPass at least through 2020.\n\n“We’re always going over and that’s why we’re afraid of the price hike,\" he said. \"We use it all the time, but we’ll be less motivated to go to Rockland or New Jersey if the price goes up.”\n\nIN CHARGE: Meet Jamey Barbas, the engineer charged with building the bridge\n\nTAPPAN ZEE WORKERS: Meet 7 who helped make the Mario\n\nTIME-LAPSE VIDEO: Watch the making of the new Tappan Zee Bridge in 4 minutes\n\nIn Nyack's Memorial Park, Charles and Adrienne Muthig of Nyack could see the headlights of vehicles traveling westward across the new bridge from the comfort of their car as they sipped their morning coffee around 7 a.m.\n\n“We’re admiring the old bridge still,” Charles Muthig said.\n\nAdrienne Muthig agreed.\n\n“(The Tappan Zee Bridge) is lower, it doesn’t interfere with the landscape,” she said.\n\nAs for the new bridge: “We’re still getting used to it,” Adrienne Muthig said. “We’ll get the full feel when the older bridge is down.”\n\nElsewhere in Memorial Park was Hannah Winginit, who was taking her dog, Emily, on a walk.\n\nWinginit was more interested in walking on the new span than viewing it from behind the wheel. The bridge’s shared-use path, however, will not available to walkers and bikers until both spans are opened.\n\n“The bridge is going to be wonderful for a lot of people because just sitting at the water has a calming effect; it’s like a meditation,” she said. “The bridge will give us that opportunity to get into the middle of the river and watch it.”\n\nIn Piermont, Pamala Hudson of New City and Carmen Bowen of South Nyack were on the shores of the Hudson River that morning.\n\nAs members of the Piermont Rowing Club, the two women expected to go out on the river with others in their rowing boats, but that plan was thwarted due to high winds.\n\nBowen said she took the Rockland-bound lanes on the Tappan Zee Bridge for the final time Friday.\n\n“I was a little sad, a little relieved,” Bowen said about her final westbound drive on the old Tappan Zee Bridge, “but a little scared about what Monday will look like, so I’m going to stay home and I’m going to work from home.”\n\nBack in Tarrytown, Ella Hall of Yonkers, who was taking pictures from the pier that morning, said she's been documenting the construction of the bridge since it began.\n\n“It’s historical, changing from one bridge to another,\" she said. “I think it’s beautiful. I just like the look. I even like the look of the new with the old. It’s sort of emotional.”"
