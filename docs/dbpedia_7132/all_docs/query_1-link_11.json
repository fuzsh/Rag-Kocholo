        "text": "Well, we traveled on Monday (Columbus Day/Indigenous People’s Day) up to Hillsboro New Hampshire. This time we are looking for the five stone bridges. We found one the day before this and the reason this one from Sunday doesn’t count is that it’s across the county line in Stoddard New Hampshire. Today we’re only talking about the five in Hillsboro NH.\n\nIf you click the map below you can click the blue pins and see the locations on the map of these stone bridges\n\nThere were several more but time has taken them away. Of the five we found today one of the five is just a memorial (Sawyer stone bridge) to the stone bridges in Hillsborough. The other four are still carrying traffic over them but they have been modified for today’s safety standards.\n\nSpeaking of Safety, A couple of these bridges require you to be sure of foot like a pack mule. The rocks on the embankment could cause at minimum, a twisted ankle or worse.\n\nI take no responsibility if you try for fancy, water level shots...\n\nThe first two stone bridges are the ones to be very careful of and they are the least photogenic. But to be thorough, I will mention and show the safe shots.\n\nSawyer Stone Bridge\n\nI had read that this one was right next to the Ford dealership but both Lisa and I were going crazy trying to find it. I tried all four directions of Route 149 and 202 when we were coming back down to the stoplight and I looked over and “SMACK” I hit the bridge… virtually.\n\nIt was right next to our car and so obvious that we kept missing it. You can park in the Tire Co. parking lot next to the stone bridge memorial. Oh if you want to see what you can see if you scramble through the brambles and loose rocks? Click here.\n\nSawmill Road Stone Bridge\n\nThe Sawmill Road stone bridge is as you can see another one with lots of loose rocks. This one can be seen by walking up Barden Hill Road, when you are two houses up, turn around and look back at the bridge. I did get down at water level but I did not find the views to be any better than this one. So don’t risk an ankle or anything else on this one… Don’t worry the next three are more photogenic and easy to walk around.\n\nCarr Stone Bridge\n\nThe Carr Bridge is the first one that is easy to get to all the sides and most folks can navigate the embankments which are sandy. I have a video up on Instagram linked here. All 4 sides allow for various degrees of shots.\n\nThis is from the backside of the bridge and as I said all four sides of this bridge are very photogenic. Refer to the map above to locate this bridge. If crosses Beard Brook and it carries Jones Road over the brook. At other times of the year, I’m sure there will be more water under the bridge. But it seems to have reflected the fall colors very nicely.\n\nGleason Falls Stone Bridge\n\nAs you can see the next bridge is the Gleason Falls Stone Bridge. This one is still fairly easy to navigate and it does require some stepping down onto solid rocks to get nice shots of the bridge with the waterfall below it.\n\nThis one is easy to find and depending on the water level will determine what angle you can get of it. I was able to get on a large boulder near the middle of the stream with very little problem. At this time all the rocks were dry and provided good footing. This site is the only side to photograph it from. While you can again easily get to the other side, I didn’t see any good angles.\n\nBeard Brook Stone Bridge\n\nThe final stone bridge today is the (there is no real name for this one so…) Beard Brook Stone Bridge. This one is also on the map above and you should be able to locate it with the help of my map.\n\nThe Beard Brook stone double arch bridge may be billed as a double arch bridge but due to the undergrowth of brush and the rocks and general layout, it’s very tough to get a shot of both arches at the same time. But it does make a great single arch shot with all the moss-covered rocks leading your eye up to the bridge. I went to the other side to photograph this arch (but this is the best side.)\n\nWell, this day went on much longer than this, and we went through a very quaint and Norman Rockwell-ish town of Hillsboro Center. and then we started to point the car towards home and on to Bennington, Francestown, and New Boston. The light had left the sky so we went home all tired out and we knew we could sleep in because of the rain in the morning.\n\nMid-October, Where do you go?\n\nWednesday, though, we will be exploring Concord Massachusetts, and Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, not in New York or in Vermont, but Authors Ridge where Nathaniel Hawthorne and other notables are buried…\n\nSo whether tomorrow you will be out on your own journey or following along with Jeff Foliage, I hope you have a great foliage day!\n\nJeff Foliage Folger\n\nAutumn is a state of mind more than a time of year – Jeff Foliage\n\nVisit my Amazon affiliate store for items that Lisa and I have curated for you.
