        "text": "Fully opened to traffic in 2018, the new Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge is three-mile state-of-the-art, twin-span crossing connecting Rockland and Westchester counties. Located less than 20 miles north of New York City, the cable-stayed span crosses one of the widest parts of the Hudson River and is the longest bridge in New York State.\n\nWelcome Center at the Rockland Landing\n\nThe Bridge Path’s Rockland Landing is located less than a half a mile from downtown Nyack. The Landing features a Welcome Center, public art, and an interactive kiosk (shown) to learn more about local restaurants and attractions.\n\nRestrooms are located in the Welcome Center, and vendors with food and refreshments — click here for the rotating vendor schedule.\n\nExperience the New Bridge via the Bridge Path\n\nOne of the most anticipated features of the new bridge is the longest shared bicycle/pedestrian path in the nation. The Bridge Path provides new access for non-motorized commuters across the Hudson River while also offering an exciting recreational opportunity in Rockland and Westchester counties.\n\nThis recently opened 12-foot wide path, located on the northern side of the westbound span bridge and separated from traffic by a concrete barrier, features six scenic overlooks across the length of the 3.1-mile crossing.\n\nHHRT Mobile Audio Biking and Walking Bridge Tours\n\nUsing the free TravelStorys app on your phone or accessing it on the Historic Hudson River Towns (HHRT) website, these dramatic tours connect the east and west sides of the Hudson River on the Path across the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge. Whether walking or biking, explore the history of the bridge, its construction and the mighty river that it crosses. Themed outlooks on the 3-mile span provide places to stop, rest, and enjoy the view.\n\nHHRT also offers a more expansive Driving Tour through historic towns, cities, and villages, over the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge at the Tappan Zee, and across the Bear Mountain Bridge in the Hudson Highlands.\n\nHudsonLink Free Shuttle to the Bridge Path\n\nOn Saturdays and Sundays through November 1, HudsonLink is offering FREE Shuttle buses that loop between Palisades Center Lot J and Tarrytown Train Station, with stops at South Nyack (Rockland Landing) and Route 119 (Westchester Landing), approximately every 20 minutes.\n\nParking is available at Palisades Lot J and Tarrytown Train Station. Click for direction to Palisades Lot J and Tarrytown Train Station.\n\nFor the schedule click here.\n\nHistory of the Tappan Zee Bridge and New Bridge Construction\n\nThe original Tappan Zee Bridge opened in 1955. For nearly 60 years the bridge has carried passengers and commerce across the Hudson River at one of its widest points, connecting upstate New York with New York City and New England.\n\nRead more about the project and the bridge’s history, and view a gallery of historical photos online at the New York Times: “A Colossal Bridge Will Rise Across the Hudson,” by Joseph Berger, January 19, 2014.\n\nTo mark the opening of the first span in August 2017, the official New NY Bridge team put together a video with some behind-the-scenes commentary about the construction process. (LoHud also has a superb time-lapse video.)\n\nThe first span (westbound) opened in August 2017, and the bridge was fully opened to traffic in 2018. The massive super crane, known as the “Left Coast Lifter” and was renamed “I Lift NY,” lifted girders and concrete as the roadway took shape. The viewing platform in Nyack’s Memorial Park, perfectly situated on the banks of the Hudson River, was the best vantage point to view all the action while the bridge was being built.\n\nThe New NY Bridge Project website has a vast gallery of photos and videos taken during its construction, including the photo to the left."
