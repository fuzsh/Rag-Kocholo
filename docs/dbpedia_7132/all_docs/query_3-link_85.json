        "text": "After delivering beans to York, Pennsylvania, I didn’t record much video over the next several days.\n\nI don’t remember why, but I did record the drive across the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River in New York; eastbound first, then westbound a couple of days later.\n\nThe Tappan Zee Bridge is about 15 miles north of New York City:\n\nThen a few days after that, I recorded crossing the Hudson River again; this time, over the Hamilton-Fish Newburgh Beacon Bridge which is about 30 miles north of the Tappan Zee Bridge.\n\nThe Governor Malcolm Wilson–Tappan Zee Bridge, or just Tappan Zee Bridge, was completed in 1955.\n\nThe bridge is slightly more than three miles long and spans the Hudson River in New York between South Nyack and Tarrytown.\n\nA new Tappan Zee Bridge has been under construction since 2013. The new bridge is a double-span bridge located just north of the existing bridge. The northern, or westbound span opened in August 2017.\n\nThe southern, or eastbound span is scheduled to open later in the year.\n\nScenic Points Along the Way:\n\nTappan Zee Bridge\n\nThe Hudson River\n\nRoads Traveled:\n\nInterstate 84\n\nI hope you enjoy this video; I recommend viewing it in full screen mode.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video and would like to see more like it from across the United States, be sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel.\n\nAlso, please share this post or video with your friends on Facebook or other social media websites using one of the Share this: buttons below."
