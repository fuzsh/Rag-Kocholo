        "text": "Communication between the construction company, the Port Authority of New York, the fabricators, and the two galvanizing companies involved was imperative for successful completion of such a massive project. Beams in excess of 60 feet, averaging approximately 9,000 pounds each, required special effort to be galvanized properly.\n\nThe New York Department of Transportation (NYDOT) had not commissioned many galvanized bridges prior to this bridge rehabilitation; however, after noting the cost savings, quick turnaround, and durability of the hot-dip galvanized steel, the contractor, NYDOT, and Port Authority are now looking for ways to incorporate the corrosion protection system into future projects. Now, the Tappan Zee, one of the oldest and largest bridges in New York City, will remain structurally sound and aesthetically pleasing for decades to come."
