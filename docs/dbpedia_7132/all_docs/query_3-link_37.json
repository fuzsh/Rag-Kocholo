        "text": "The New Tappan Zee Bridge, also known as the New NY Bridge and officially named the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge after the late former governor Mario Cuomo, is a twin cable-stayed bridge built to replace the original Tappan Zee Bridge over New York's Hudson River. The $4.0 billion bridge structure was completed in June 2018, and contains a total of eight lanes for vehicular traffic as well as a shared-use bicycle and pedestrian path.\n\nAdditionally, an allowance has been made for the future construction, between the two structures, of a rail line to assist with trans-Hudson public transportation.\n\nThe Tappan Zee Bridge is a critically important transportation link in the New York Metropolitan Area, with over 138,000 vehicles crossing it each day.\n\nmageba North America Corp. supplied all 23 of the TENSA® MODULAR (type LR) expansion joints required for the new Tappan Zee Bridge, in fully continuous lengths, the longest of which is 105 feet. The largest joints are type LR18, each with 18 individual movement gaps which accommodate total longitudinal movements of up to 54 inches (1.4 meters).\n\nmageba also supplied 16 RESTON®STU shock transmission units (STU, also known as lock-up devices), with lock-up capacities of 800 kips (3550kN) and pressure release valves rated for 1600 kips (7100 kN). Each STU will weigh 13,500 lbs (6150 kg), and will be individually tested to ensure that the performance meets the required design criteria."
