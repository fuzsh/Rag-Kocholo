        "text": "Gov. Thomas Dewey engineered the plan to prevent the Port Authority from collecting revenue from the Tappan Zee Bridge so he could pay for the Thruway\n\nThe Tappan Zee Bridge was located 25 miles north of the Statue of Liberty so it wouldn't come under the jurisdiction of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\n\nGov. Thomas Dewey, eager to find a dependable source of revenue for the New York State Thruway, engineered the plan to build the Tappan Zee outside Port Authority territory\n\nOur story on surging truck traffic on the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge got us wondering why the New York State Thruway Authority and not the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey operates the bridge.\n\nAfter all, the Port Authority predates the Thruway Authority and has plenty of experience operating bridges. The authority oversees four crossings, including the George Washington Bridge some 21 miles down the Hudson River. Why couldn’t it have taken on the Cuomo Bridge’s predecessor, the Tappan Zee Bridge, back in the 1950s?\n\nThe Thruway Authority, after all, was created in 1950 to finance the construction of a 570-mile superhighway that stretches from Buffalo to New York City.\n\nFor the answer we turned to “Politics Across the Hudson,” a fascinating account of the Tappan Zee Bridge project authored by Philip Plotch, a professor at St. Peter’s University in Jersey City.\n\nAnd the answer is right there in Chapter 1.\n\n“The state needed the bridge’s toll revenues to help support the rest of the Thruway system,” Plotch writes. “If a new bridge were built in the Port Authority’s jurisdiction, New York would have to share its toll revenues with New Jersey.”\n\nThe mastermind behind the strategy to keep the Port Authority from getting its hands on Tappan Zee Bridge revenue was New York State’s 47th governor, Thomas E. Dewey.\n\nDewey was looking for a way around the Port Authority’s “exclusive right to build and operate all bridges and tunnels across the Hudson River within 25 miles of the Statue of Liberty,” Plotch writes.\n\nFor years, the debate over where to build the new bridge dragged on, with some suggesting a Westchester landing in Dobbs Ferry, where the river across to New Jersey stretches less than a mile.\n\nDewey guarded information about the chosen location as if it was a state secret, aware that if word leaked too soon opposition would build, Plotch notes. The situation seems similar to how state officials today guard information about how high tolls will need to go in a few years to pay for the $3.9 billion Cuomo Bridge.\n\nDewey would eventually settle on a location between South Nyack and Tarrytown, some 800 feet north of the 25-mile zone stretching north from the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThe Tappan Zee Bridge opened to traffic in 1955.\n\nThe 3.1-mile bridge, spanning the second-widest portion of the Hudson, incorporated an S-curve alignment designed to avoid Port Authority territory, Plotch writes.\n\nAnd last year, like every other year before it, revenue from car and truck tolls on the bridge — some $151.2 million in 2017 — bankrolled a sizable chunk of the Thruway Authority’s $1.65 billion budget.\n\nCRASH: On 4th anniversary of Valhalla Metro-North crash, third rail is focus of litigation\n\n9/11: Jefferson Crowther, father of 9/11 'man in the red bandanna,' dies at 73; wake Monday"
