        "text": "TARRYTOWN, Westchester County -- The final section of the old Tappan Zee Bridge is being lowered onto a barge and removed Friday.\n\nThe west anchor span of the Tappan Zee Bridge, the only portion still standing, comes down in a task that is expected to take most of the day.\n\nWhile some sections were previously lowered, the main span was imploded and dramatically crashed into the Hudson River with a resounding boom in January.\n\nThe controlled demolition went off without a hitch, when explosive charges safely detonated at the support columns on the bridge's east anchor span.\n\nThe new Mario Cuomo Bridge replaced the 64-year-old Tappan Zee, which was once a poster child of America's crumbling infrastructure.\n\nThe major thoroughfare spans the Hudson River between Tarrytown in Westchester County and Nyack in Rockland County about 30 miles north of New York City.\n\n----------\n\n* More Northern Suburbs news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts"
