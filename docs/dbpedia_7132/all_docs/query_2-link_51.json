This photo was selected as a winner of the 2016 ENR Photo Contest.\n\nThe magazine-quality Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB) publications memorialize the project and help explain what goes into building a mega bridge of this caliber.

Several thousand are printed every quarter and electronic versions are available on the project website.\n\nEducational outreach helps to keep the public, especially young students, interested and informed about the historic Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB). Various educational posters are distributed to schools in the area and also appear on display throughout the community.\n\nA 50-megapixel aerial of the Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB) details the blue jump forms that act as mobile workspaces, more than 400 feet in the air.\n\nLarge educational displays were created for the Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB) outreach centers and utilized at educational presentations. These large informational boards are both beautiful and informative.\n\nTracking communication is an important element of public outreach efforts. Stokes created a custom-designed Stakeholder Database which allows our team to export monthly reports for the client to show the many comments and inquiries received via call or email.\n\nOn the Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB), there are two public viewing areas with outdoor displays – both built to withstand the weather of the Hudson Valley and large enough for hundreds of visitors to view the project.\n\nThe magazine-quality Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB) newsletters memorialize the project and help explain what goes into building a mega bridge of this caliber. Stokes generates the content for the articles as well as the overall theme and graphics. Several thousand are printed and electronic versions are available on the project website.\n\nIn the beginning phase of the Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB), the Stokes marketing and communication experts developed a branding Style Guide that keeps everything about the project consistent, including logo usage and colors.\n\nPiers highlight the path of the new twin-span crossing for the Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB).\n\nStokes produced many large photo displays for the Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB) that have been utilized at public presentations.\n\nConstruction progresses across the Hudson as enormous assemblies of structural steel rest atop concrete piers on the Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB).\n\nAn ironworker utilizing a safety harness atop the new bridge’s first girder assembly on the Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project (NNYB)."
