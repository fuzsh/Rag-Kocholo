        "text": "When Jeff White and his wife, Krista, bought their 1890 colonial-style home in an industrial section of Sleepy Hollow six years ago, one feature in particular attracted them: the view of the Hudson River. Perched on a hilltop, the house’s master bedroom has unobstructed views of the water and the Tappan Zee Bridge.\n\n“It’s the last thing I see every night when I go to bed, and the first thing I see every morning when I wake up,” Mr. White said in a mid-September interview.\n\nAll of that staring inspired Mr. White, and as construction of a new bridge began alongside the old one in 2013, an idea for an art collective took shape in his mind. Last year, Mr. White, an art preparator in the drawings and prints department at the Museum of Modern Art, organized Bridgebuilder, a group of 12 regional woodcut artists creating prints inspired by the project."
