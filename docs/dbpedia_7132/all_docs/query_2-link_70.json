        "text": "Restoring the \"Tappan Zee\" name to the bridge that spans the Hudson River at Rockland and Westchester counties advanced on Tuesday in the state Senate under a bipartisan measure.\n\nBut the bill faces an uncertain future in the state Assembly, where lawmakers have said it is unlikely to pass before the Legislature concludes the session this week.\n\nThe proposal would rename the Mario Cuomo Bridge, keeping the name of the late former governor while adding Tappan Zee.\n\nThe previous Tappan Zee Bridge was named to reflect the Hudson Valley's Dutch and Native American heritage. It was later modified in 1994 to honor former Gov. Malcolm Wilson.\n\nIn 2017, a replacement for the old Tappan Zee Bridge was named in honor of Mario Cuomo, the father of then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo under an agreement reached with members of the state Legislature at the time.\n\nSince then, Hudson Valley lawmakers have pushed for the bridge's name to also include the old Tappan Zee moniker as well.\n\nThe bill approved on Tuesday was the first time the measure cleared the state Senate since it was proposed.\n\n\"Our work is not done, but today's vote to modify the bridgeâs name to include Tappan Zee is a great step in the right direction,\" said Republican state Sen. Bill Weber."
