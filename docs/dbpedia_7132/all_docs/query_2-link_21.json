        "text": "The bridge's original 6Â¾-inch-thick concrete deck should be replaced with a pre-cast panel deck that meets the modern 10-inch-thick standard. Thruway construction projects in the mid-1990's have already replaced the original deck along 20 percent of the bridge, mostly on the southbound (eastbound) lanes of the eastern deck truss. A second project to be completed in November 2002 will replace the deck on the northbound (westbound) lanes of the eastern deck truss, necessitating partial closures during off-peak hours. Still, approximately three-quarters of the original bridge deck has yet to be replaced.\n\nThe bridge should be strengthened to ensure its structural safety. Since the bridge opened, a seventh lane was added to handle growing traffic, and research has shown that the wind loads on the bridges are actually greater than the bridge was originally designed to handle. These increased load requirements have taxed the reserve strength built into the bridge. Additionally, studies have shown that the bridge is vulnerable to seismic activity.\n\nModern AASHTO-compliant pier protection (fender) systems should be constructed to protect the bridge's eight caisson-supported piers from boat collisions and ice flows on the Hudson River.\n\nThe causeway sections should be completed replaced. This project would consist of constructing a new deck, piers and supporting beams.\n\nFinally, the entire length of the bridge should be seismically retrofitted. The report estimated that an earthquake registering between M5.0 and M6.0 could cause serious damage to the bridge, particularly on the causeway section.\n\nIn combination with traffic demand management (TDM) measures, rehabilitation of the existing Tappan Zee Bridge was estimated to cost $1.3 billion. However, this alternative neither increases vehicular capacity nor serves anticipated mass transit needs.\n\nInstead, the Vollmer Associates study recommended a complete replacement of the existing span with a new eight-lane bridge. To accommodate the anticipated growth in reverse commuting, the bridge would have four permanent lanes in each direction. Moreover, the study explored the following mass transit options along the bridge and the I-287 corridor:\n\nDEDICATED BUSWAY: connecting express bus stops at Suffern, Palisades Center, Tarrytown, White Plains (Westchester County Center) and Port Chester; estimated cost $2.0 billion.\n\nLIGHT RAIL: connecting stations at Suffern, Palisades Center, Tarrytown, White Plains and Port Chester; estimated cost $2.6 billion.\n\nCOMMUTER RAIL: connecting stations at Suffern, Palisades Center, Tarrytown, White Plains and Port Chester; estimated cost $3.4 billion. This option would provide connections for a \"one-seat ride\" to New York City via the Metro-North Hudson Line, and changes for the New Haven, Harlem and Port Jervis lines. (A new extension of the rail line to Stewart Airport would bring the cost to $4.0 billion.)\n\nUnder all three options, improvements in roadway and interchange capacity would be made along the I-287 corridor. Specifically, the I-87 / I-287 interchange in Elmsford would be reconstructed, and I-287 would be expanded from six lanes to eight lanes (four in each direction) between the Garden State Parkway in Spring Valley and I-684 in White Plains. The NYSTA owns land on 150 feet of either side of the bridge for such roadway expansion.\n\nMark Kulewicz, director of traffic engineering and safety service at the Automobile Club of New York (the local affiliate of the AAA), advocated a new bridge as follows:\n\nInstead of spending $1 billion to patch up a bridge that is already straining to handle the region's growing traffic volume, why not avoid all those years of messy construction delays and invest $4 billion in a modern structure that can serve more commuters, and in new ways?\n\nFor this new bridge - let's call it Tappan Zee II - would be no carbon copy of its predecessor. While the present bridge maintains seven lanes of traffic (including one center lane that switches directions for morning and afternoon rush hours with the aid of a moveable barrier), Tappan Zee II as envisioned would boast eight permanent lanes of traffic, four in each direction. And in the plan's most novel concept, the bridge's auto lanes would be flanked by tracks for a new commuter rail line that would run from Suffern in Rockland County to MTA-Metro North's New Haven tracks at the Port Chester station in Westchester County.\n\nWith a brand new eight-lane bridge and a new rail system to further ease auto traffic in a busy commuter corridor, why do we hesitate crossing over? First, we see a need to take a look at the larger Rockland-Westchester corridor to determine if the source of current commuter delays does not lie elsewhere, perhaps on the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287), where interchange improvements are due to begin soon. Second, we would want some reassurance that the new rail line to be grafted onto the Tappan Zee II will attract a sufficient ridership to justify its cost. Is it possible that less costly projects - such as an exclusive bus lane on the bridge or the introduction of high-speed ferry service on the Hudson - offer better alternatives?\n\nNot everyone agreed with the findings of the Vollmer study. Peter Samuel, editor of the Toll Roads newsletter, said that the findings were rigged against highway expansion and in favor of mass transit, citing the following:\n\nHighway expansion was ruled out in this report by deploying blatantly stacked criteria in the alternatives analysis. The report was prepared for a Governor's Task Force led by MTA transit agency head Virgil Conway. The study rejected increased highway capacity - apart from the extra single bridge lane to allow fixed 2x4-lane operation in place of the present 4-lane-east / 3-lane-west AM, 3-lane-east / 4-lane-west operations - on the novel grounds that the increase in highway capacity would be \"finite.\" The bizarre argument is made in this report that because extra capacity would be exhausted beyond 2020, there would be no \"flexibility to handle traffic growth beyond 2020.\"\n\nVariable pricing is rejected on the grounds that the peak is already heavily spread, due in part to the severity of peak congestion, so there is little '\"shoulder'\" capacity for pricing to exploit. Reverse commuting (westbound mornings, eastbound evenings) is growing so fast that reversible lanes will not work.\n\nFinally, how transit-oriented are the people in this corridor? Despite years of subsidized transit it represents a mere three percent of trips to work. Yet despite the clear preference of the people of the corridor for car travel, the Conway task force did not set better car travel, or alleviation of road congestion as one of its goals. On the contrary, the first goal is to \"decrease highway travel during weekday peak periods.\" The next goal is to \"increase public transit use.\" The group was not even interested in catering to public needs as expressed by their travel preferences, but in manipulating a mode shift from road to rail transit.\n\nThe NYSTA is in the midst of a public information campaign as a prelude to the public hearing process. The agency presented 15 alternative designs for evaluation in December 2003 from more than 150 submitted, and subsequently subjected them to environmental studies. In September 2005, the NYSTA narrowed the list down to the following six alternatives:\n\nALTERNATIVE 1 (\"NO BUILD\"): The existing seven-lanes bridge would in maintained in its existing condition to avoid critical levels of deterioration. Estimated cost: $500 million to $700 million.\n\nALTERNATIVE 2 (REHABILITATION): This option would feature a complete rehabilitation and seismic retrofit of the span. Enhanced bus service and new park-and-ride lots also are part of this option, which is estimated to cost between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion.\n\nALTERNATIVE 3 (NEW BRIDGE WITH BUS RAPID TRANSIT): This alternative would replace the existing bridge with a new span. The new span would feature eight general-use lanes, two bus rapid transit lanes that could be used for HO/T use (in which there would be a higher toll for single drivers), and breakdown shoulders. The HO/T lanes would run along I-287 (and I-87) from Suffern to Port Chester. Estimated cost: $5.0 billion to $6.5 billion.\n\nALTERNATIVE 4A (NEW BRIDGE WITH WESTCHESTER-ROCKLAND COMMUTER RAIL): The features of the new bridge are the same as in alternative 3, but would add a commuter (heavy) rail line from Suffern to Port Chester. Estimated cost: $11.5 billion to $14.5 billion.\n\nALTERNATIVE 4B (NEW BRIDGE WITH ROCKLAND COMMUTER RAIL AND WESTCHESTER LIGHT RAIL): The features of the new bridge are the same as in alternative 4, but would add a commuter (heavy) rail line from Suffern to Tarrytown, and a light rail line from Tarrytown to Port Chester. Estimated cost: $10.0 billion to $12.5 billion.\n\nALTERNATIVE 4B (NEW BRIDGE WITH ROCKLAND COMMUTER RAIL AND WESTCHESTER BUS RAPID TRANSIT): The features of the new bridge are the same as in alternative 4, but would add a commuter (heavy) rail line from Suffern to Tarrytown, and bus rapid transit lanes along I-287 from Tarrytown to Port Chester. Estimated cost: $9.0"
