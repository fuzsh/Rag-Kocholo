        "text": "At one time, there were more than 300 covered bridges in NY state. Today, the Ulster and Sullivan county region boasts some of the most spectacular bridges left, most built in the 1800s.\n\nLooking to rev up your seasonal leaf peeping a notch? One of the Hudson Valley's best-kept secrets might be just the thing: Wooden covered bridges.\n\nWhile these historical gems might inspire thoughts of New England, New York state is also home to these treasures. At one time, there were more than 300 covered bridges in the Empire State, but time, weather and progress have caused that number to dwindle to around a couple of dozen. Luckily, the Ulster and Sullivan county region boasts some of the most spectacular covered bridge sites around, most built in the 1800s.\n\nAmazon: Historic Orange County house on warehouse site may find new home\n\nHudson Valley: Check out some local roadtrips for fall leaf peeping\n\nBusiness: Kosher wine company looking at Goshen warehouse\n\nFirst, a little history. Why covered bridges in the first place? The biggest reason was to protect the wooden structures from rain, snow, ice, moisture and sun, which would cause them to fail faster. Speaking of weather, in winter, it was common practice at the time to shovel snow into the bridges, so that horse sleighs could cross them without damaging the wood.\n\nThe fine craftsmanship of these bridges is a treat not to be missed – especially during the fall. So plan your route, and take a road trip to visit the historic covered bridges that dot our landscape. In today’s times of uncertainty and stress, they’ll charm you with notions of a simpler way of life from long ago.\n\nWhile all these bridges are Instagram-worthy, some are located on private property, others require ticketed access, so adhere to all regulations when visiting.\n\nUlster County\n\nIt’s best to set aside a couple of days if you’re planning to visit all the covered bridges in Ulster, especially if you decide to make side trips along the way.\n\nAshokan Bridge\n\nAshokan Bridge (also known as the Turnwood Bridge or New Paltz Campus Bridge) is a wooden covered bridge over the Old Channel of the Esopus Creek. It’s located on the grounds of the Ashokan Center outdoor education, conference and retreat center in the Catskill Mountains of Ulster County.\n\nIt was built in 1885, and is a single span, gable roofed, covered timber bridge, measuring 72 feet, 6 inches long. The structure was originally located at Turnwood and moved to its present location in the 1930s. Ashokan Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.\n\nThis is a private bridge, and an appointment is needed to visit. Go to ashokancenter.org, click on Day Passes to find available time slots for visiting the bridge. Fees to walk the grounds are: $10 per person, ages 18 and up; $5 per person, ages 12-17 years; free for kids under 12 years. The Ashokan Center is located at 477 Beaverkill Road, Olivebridge, 845- 657-833.\n\nDid you know?

It is over the Mill Brook, a single span of 66 feet. Owned and maintained by the Town of Hardenburgh, the structure carries pedestrian traffic. This bridge was rehabilitated in 1991 by one of the great-grandsons of the original builder. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\n\nDid you know? To help fund this bridge’s restoration, wooden pins used in the construction called treenails (pronounced “trunnels”) were sold to individuals with the stipulation that their names would be imprinted on them. When visiting the bridge, be sure to look for the many names written on the treenails.\n\nFind it: The bridge at the intersection of Davis and Mill Brook roads in Margaretville. Note: While owned and maintained by the town Hardenburgh, which is in Ulster, the bridge's address is in Margaretville, which is in Delaware County.\n\nPerrine's Covered Bridge\n\nPerrine’s Covered Bridge, built in 1844, is pedestrian-only and located in Esopus-Rosendale, just a few hundred feet to the east of Interstate 87, crossing the Wallkill River. The bridge was named after James Perrine (1801-1860), son of French immigrant James W. Perrin and Huguenot descendant Catherine Freer, who operated a hotel/tavern at the site of the future bridge. The bridge made it easier for more than 1,000 workers to travel to work at the nearly 20 mills and factories nearby at the time. Perrine’s Bridge was added to the National Registry of Historic places in 1973.\n\nDid you know? Perrine’s is New York’s second-oldest covered bridge.\n\nFind it: The bridge is southwest of Rifton, off of Route 213.\n\nTappan Covered Bridge\n\nTappan Covered Bridge (also known as the Kittle Covered Bridge) was built in 1906.

At one time, at least eight covered bridges stood over Dry Brook in Ulster County.\n\nFind it: From Rt. 28 in Arkville, take Dry Brook Road for 8.5 miles.\n\nSullivan County\n\nGiven their proximity, these covered bridges can easily be visited in a day, if so desired.\n\nBeaverkill Covered Bridge\n\nBeaverkill Covered Bridge (also known as Conklin Bridge) is one of four covered bridges still standing in Sullivan County. It is owned by the Town of Rockland and maintained by the county, carrying traffic across the Beaver Kill. Built in 1865, this 98-foot-long, wooden single-span structure incorporates the lattice truss design perfected early in the 19th century.\n\nThe bridge runs through one of the oldest campgrounds in the area, Beaverkill State Campground. In 2007, it was listed on the State and National Registers of Historic Places.\n\nDid you know?

The bridge has six buttresses on each side and is one of five covered bridges in New York State that has a timber approach. The bridge was retired from vehicle use in 1963. It is not yet on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nDid you know? This bridge is considered the last remaining symbol of a community established by early settlers of the Upper Neversink Valley, led by Quaker preacher John Hall.\n\nFind it: The bridge is located just south of Claryville in Sullivan County, on what's called the Hunter Road Spur, off of Hunter Road. There's a small parking area near the bridge.\n\nLivingston Manor\n\nLivingston Manor Covered Bridge/Van Tran Flat Bridge, formerly known as the Mott Flats Bridge, is the oldest of the Catskills’ lattice-style bridges, built in 1860. This bridge was closed for more than four decades, finally undergoing restoration in 1984. It spans 117 feet across the Willowemoc Creek, where visitors are welcome to fish. It is open to cars. The bridge is located off County Route 179 on Town Road 39, Covered Bridge Road.\n\nDid you know? Located adjacent to the bridge is Livingston Manor Covered Bridge Park.

Picnic areas, group picnic pavilion (fee) and portable toilet facilities available.\n\nA short distance from the bridge is the Catskill Fly Fishing Center & Museum, 1031 Old Route 17, Livingston Manor; 845-439-4810.\n\nFind it: The bridge is on Covered Bridge Road off Sullivan County Route 179. Route 17 can be seen from the bridge and the nearby Livingston Manor Covered Bridge Park.\n\nWillowemoc\n\nWillowemoc (also known as Bendo) Covered Bridge, originally built in 1860 in Livingston Manor, was cut in half and moved to its current Town of Rockland location, just outside of DeBruce, in 1913. It spans Willowemoc Creek on Conklin Hill Road, has a covered lattice through truss design, with a single span of 48 feet. It is owned and maintained by the county.\n\nThe Bendo Covered Bridge plays an integral role in the adjoining campground, the Covered Bridge Campsite, where it stands.\n\nThe bridge does not qualify for National Registry of Historic Places.\n\nDid you know? In 1970, high waters on the Willowemoc Creek undermined one of the bridge’s abutments, dropping one end of the bridge into the creek below. After repair work, it was ready for limited local traffic. In 1985, the bridge was once again rebuilt, but this time without functional trusses, so it is now considered a “stringer,” or a more modern, less authentic covered bridge.\n\nFind it: The bridge is at 74 Conklin Hill Road near Debruce in Sullivan County.\n\nWhat about \"stringers\"?\n\nA “stringer” is classified as an historic bridge, but is more modern or not as authentic, since the original truss no longer supports the bridge. Besides the Willowemoc (Bendo) Covered Bridge, other local stringers include the following:\n\nFriendship Manor Covered Bridge (also known as Pine Hill Covered Bridge) in Ulster County, built in 1992, is located at the entrance to Catskill State Park.
