        "text": "The bridge across the Hudson that connects Nyack to Tarrytown is a step closer to getting its original name back, however, its current official name would also remain. A bill making the bridge the “Mario M. Cuomo Tappan Zee Bridge” passed in the state Senate Tuesday. Rockland State Senator, Republican Bill Weber, a co-sponsor of the bill, told “The Morning Show” before the vote took place on Tuesday that he was confident it would happen…\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Orange County state Senator, Democrat James Skoufis, who told his colleagues that area residents were stunned by the way former governor Andrew Cuomo renamed the bridge after his father in an omnibus bill in the middle of the night…\n\nThe original Hudson River span opened in 1955 and had been named for a local Native American tribe and used the Dutch word for “sea.”"
