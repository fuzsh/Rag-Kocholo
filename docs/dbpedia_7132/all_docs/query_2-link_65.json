        "text": "This design was created in collaboration with IBT Engineers, Bechtel Corporation, Michael Baker Engineers, and Tutor Perini Corporation, becoming a finalist in the selection process of the new Tappan Zee Bridge project in New York.\n\nThis iconic bridge was based on the historical, cultural, and geographical characteristics of the state to become part of the family of iconic bridges that span the Hudson River. Serving as a gateway for the Hudson River Valley to the north and New York City to the south, this design draws on the past, excites the future, and enhances the communities it connects.\n\nThis state-of-the-art signature bridge is worthy of the cultural heritage of the Hudson River Valley. The design resulted from a holistic process as a critical regional and national transportation conduit. Its aim was to represent an industrial, yet aesthetic, element in the natural landscape and stand as a lasting monument for the Hudson River Valley."
