        "text": "Comprehensive analysis for a major thoroughfare\n\nWe took a wide perspective of the risks and benefits of the options available, investigating multiple aspects of the corridor. Our research included vulnerability, environmental concerns, risk and security analysis. To reach a conclusion on the best way forward for New York State, we used a wide variety of our core services.\n\nThese included transportation planning, bridge and tunnel design, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, geotechnical, highway, rail and seismic engineering, security, cost, fire/life safety consulting and transaction advice.\n\nWe took responsibility for bridge inspection and testing, fatigue and seismic analyses, vulnerability and risk assessments, security, and rehabilitation cost estimation.\n\nThis comprehensive threat and risk assessment covered natural, accidental and deliberate threats. We calculated the probability and consequence of each threat to prioritise risks, then identified structural, operational and security countermeasures.\n\nOur security design team provided a security audit to identify pre-engineering design requirements (such as fencing and lighting) for both electronic and physical security. To make our findings clear, we facilitated a risk comparison exercise with the client and developed a risk/cost decision model.\n\nBuilding consensus to build support\n\nAs project engineering support consultants, we also collaborated with stakeholders and the wider public to help achieve consensus for the way forward. Providing information on technical issues, we facilitated an extensive outreach effort, including meetings and workshops with local stakeholders and interest groups.\n\nThe data gained from this process allowed our team to develop the preliminary design and output specifications for the draft environmental impact statement.\n\nTechnical advisory support for procurement\n\nArup provided integrated technical advisory support during the procurement process, incorporating constructability reviews with qualitative and quantitative assessments of the key project risks and mitigants. We advised on the development of a design-build procurement structure which we tailored to the owner’s resources and objectives, then managed the process to deliver commercial and technical expertise on a wide range of tasks, such as the establishment of an evaluation plan and selection criteria. This fast-tracked procurement resulted in New York State awarding us the contract just nine months after the RFQ release.\n\nBuilding a legacy in New York State\n\nThe client has been extremely pleased with our performance and contribution throughout the project. As Karen Rae of the New York State Governor’s office said in early 2012, “The team has worked hard to understand the goals and provide new solutions… this will be a legacy among projects in the US.”"
