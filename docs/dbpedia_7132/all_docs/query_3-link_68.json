        "text": "Hastings-on-Hudson resident Sheila Moore was a child when her parents moved to Tarrytown in 1962. She recalls playing with her friends in nearby woods “but then we found a hole in the fence.\n\n“We’d go down the hill, across the tracks and under the bridge and go swimming,” says Moore, grinning. “We were river rats!” Her father was the superintendent at 300 S. Broadway and across the street from a vacant lot, where 303 S. Broadway is now. “We used to climb up on the roof, and there it was. It was brand new.”\n\nFrom Haverstraw Bay, approaching the Tappan Zee Bridge with missing main span center section.

The governor had been delayed, and in the meantime, Anderson walked to the Westchester side. Amused, Harriman invited him into his limousine back to Rockland for the official first ride.\n\nEach eight 40-story-high main span tower was completed in December 2016 and is supported by 12 pairs of stay cables totaling 700 miles of metal strands.

Everyone has had a good time during these trips.”\n\nUnderside of the Tappan Zee Bridge main span, whose roadway was covered in places by metal plates.

They also began with piles driven into the river.\n\nWashington Irving High School class of 1954 graduate Dominick Minotti was aware of the noise outside his second-floor classroom window.\n\nCross-section of where crews removed one section of the Tappan Zee Bridge’s main span.

The sounds and sights of Ancient Rome and modern technology blended in a sleepy afternoon.”\n\nThe new bridge is 100 percent U.S. American-made steel and will have a walking/bicycle path with six scenic overlooks, anti-climb fencing, safety nets, three graded turnarounds for emergency vehicles, and a new water system with a fire department connection and valves at each end that allow water to flow through pipes directly to hydrants.\n\nOpening day pins commemorating the new bridge. Photo by Janie Rosman\n\nThe 43 pairs of piers supporting the Westchester and Rockland approach spans have LED lighting programmable for events and holidays. Both spans will have four general traffic lanes, space for disabled vehicles and bus rapid transit, and three turnaround lanes for emergency vehicles. If an accident occurs, motorists can drive on the breakdown and bus lanes and, in extreme cases, be redirected using a turnaround lane.\n\nTappan Zee Bridge opening day ceremonial program given to Sheila Moore by neighbors.
