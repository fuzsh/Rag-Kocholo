        "text": "Running the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge over one of the widest points of the Hudson River is a memorable running experience. When the Tappan Zee Bridge was rebuilt and opened as the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, it included a wonderful multi-use path on its north side, providing a critical connection for pedestrians and cyclists. The path features six scenic overlooks, interpretive displays and public art across its length. Visitor parking and amenities are available at both the Rockland and Westchester landings.\n\nThe distance between the Westchester Landing and Rockland Landing is ~3.5 miles, but the route is closer to 4.8 miles including the pedestrian access points on either side. In Westchester, access is at Leroy Ave. & Broadway, just south of the center of Tarrytown. On the Rockland side, access is off S. Franklin St. in South Nyack, near downtown Nyack."
