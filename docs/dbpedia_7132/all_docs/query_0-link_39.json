        "text": "PDF map files available for download from the FLTC On-line Store are geospatial-enabled. This means that the files can be imported into mapping software available for many Apple and Android smart phones and tablets, and soon for Windows Phones.\n\nWe have tested our PDF maps with the Avenza PDF Maps Mobile App. Once you have installed this (free) app on your device, you can import the FLTC PDF map into the application.\n\nThen, when you are hiking within the boundaries of the map, you can see your location acording to your device’s GPS. You can also do things like:\n\nAdd placemarks\n\nRecord your own track\n\nTag photos\n\nOrient the map using your compass\n\nMeasure distance and area\n\nSearch for places on the map\n\nThe free version of the Avenza app will only permit you to import three maps at one time. To import an additional map, you must first remove one of the three from the app. You can still keep the PDF files on your device and switch them at any time. There is a subscription version available from Avenza that will permit you to import an unlimited number of maps.\n\nYou can also purchase PDF versions of FLT maps from Avenza, and for purchased maps, there is no limit to the number you can import.\n\nHow to use this page\n\nConsult with this page for notices of trail conditions before you leave for your hike. Click on the “Sort by” option to sort the notices by map name or by date. Don’t know your map name? Go to the index map look for the name (M09 or M9 for example) nearest your hike location.\n\nWhen sorted by map name, the notices are listed going from west to east on the main trail, and then north to south on the branch trails (south to north on Conservation and Onondaga trails). Click on the map names above the table to jump to the notices for a particular map. You can then scroll up and down to view other nearby notices.\n\nMap names in red indicate that one or more notices for that map contain hunting notices or other temporary trail closures. Check carefully for these notices during hunting season(s) in your area.\n\nMap names underlined in gray have no notices.\n\nThe date of the most recent major revision is shown for each map. Check the revision date on your map to see if it might be outdated. All changes to maps—both major revisions and minor updates—are reported as Trail Notices highlighted in pink. Use these notices to decide when you want to replace an outdated map.\n\nWhen sorted by Date the notices are listed with the most recent notices anywhere on the FLTC system listed first.\n\nSome older notices have been archived as they may contain information that is still useful if you have not visited the trail recently. Click the “Archived” link to view these notices.\n\nMore about trail conditions\n\nTrail conditions change frequently. You can help by reporting problems you see. But please read How to Report Trail Conditions before submitting your report.\n\nTrail Conditions are posted when reported and verified. Conditions are rectified if and when volunteers are available.\n\nThe FLT is a “primitive footpath.” If you are looking for a smooth, easy “walk in the park” then you might prefer a park for your walking. On the other hand, if you are looking to challenge yourself and get away from “engineered” experiences, then come to the Finger Lakes Trail.\n\nNevertheless, we want the condition of the Finger Lakes Trail to be the best it can be. Every section of the trail is maintained by stewards and trail adopters who are members of the FLTC and affiliate clubs and organizations. These people volunteer their time because they care about the Finger Lakes Trail. They also care about your experience on the trail. They visit their section of trail several times each year to look for problems: trail erosion, litter, vegetation infringement on the trail, fallen trees and branches, blazes and signs that need to be replaced or refreshed, and infrastructure that needs repair. In short, they look for things that will interfere with your wilderness hiking experience.\n\nTrail volunteers also interact with our private landowners who have agreed to share a portion of their property with FLT hikers. Our volunteers are the first to know when land ownership may change, or when the landowner has had a problem on their section of trail.\n\nWhether you are a new or experienced hiker, if you find a problem on the trail, let us know! Visit the Trail Condition Reporting page for more information.\n\nRemember, some sections of the trail are closed during hunting seasons which include Spring and Fall turkey seasons, and Fall big game seasons. Closures are listed in red in the Trail Condition Notices. Dates are listed on Hunting Season Schedules.\n\nAnd, when you are ready, join us as a volunteer to help keep the Finger Lakes Trail one of the best hiking trails in the world.\n\nSince our volunteer trail maintainers don’t visit the trail every day, we depend on you to notice and report trail conditions that need to be corrected. It could be a safety issue or just an inconvenience, but let us know about it. On the other hand, remember that the Finger Lakes Trail is a “primitive footpath” so that some conditions such as a steep rocky section, an occasional “step-over” log, or a section that is muddy in some seasons, are a natural part of the experience.\n\nPlease submit your trail condition reports by e-mail at [email protected]. If you do not have e-mail, call the FLT Service Center in Mount Morris at (585)658-9320. During times when the office is not open, please leave a voice message with a daytime phone number where we can reach you for more information.\n\nDescribe the problem clearly, being as specific as possible as to the location and nature of the problem. Include as much of the following as possible:\n\nTown, County, public land name (State Forest, etc.)\n\nFLTC map number(s) – You can find map numbers on the Interactive Map; zoom into the problem area and click on the nearest icon.\n\nAccess points, distance from road crossings, trail mileage, or GPS coordinates\n\nDirection of travel if important in observing the problem (such as blazing).\n\nGive your best estimate of what is needed to correct the problem; we hate to send a crew with chainsaws only to find a small tree that could have been handled by one person with a handsaw.\n\nFLTC volunteers attend 2-day training course in safe and efficient use of chainsaws for clearing blowdown\n\non the Finger Lakes Trail – Photo R. Hopkins\n\nThe FLTC offers downloadable files containing complete track and complete waypoint GPS data detailing all of the approximately 1,000 miles of the FLT, including main, loop, branch, and spur trails. In addition to GPX data, the downloadable files contain PDF images of the paper maps. GPX files can be loaded onto color “field” (i.e. hiking, as opposed to automotive) GPS units. These GPX files can also be opened in Google Earth, so that you can view your hikes ahead of time (you can download the necessary software from Google Earth for free).\n\nDetailed instructions for using the Track and Waypoint data in these GPX files are provided here.\n\nNotes on Garmin units\n\nInstructions for using the data with these recommended Garmin GPS units are also included:\n\nRecent Garmin units: 62, 78, Oregon, Dakota, and Colorado. The Oregon and Dakota models are “touch screen” units (similar to auto GPS units) amd may be a little easier to learn how to use.\n\nAdvantages: Can hold 200 loaded (saved) tracks of up to 10,000 track points each, slicker interfaces to work with, can load in aerial imagery (Google Earth in your hand) at $30/year.\n\nDisadvantages: More expensive, loaded (saved) tracks do not retain track colors and are not turned on by default (but we’re hoping a future update with Garmin WebUpdater will fix these two problems).\n\nOlder Garmin units: 60, 78 (instructions can also be used with Etrex Vista HCx and Etrex Legend HCx with slight modifications).\n\nAdvantages: Less expensive, loaded (saved) tracks retain track colors and are turned on by default.\n\nDisadvantages: Can hold only 20 loaded (saved) tracks of only 500 track points each (but tracks we sell are filtered down to this level), these models may soon be discontinued, Etrex models mentioned above can be quite inaccurate if oriented vertically.\n\nBottom Line Recommended Unit? If you are a “techie” and can find it, grab the 60CSx at the present discounted prices. If you are a “newbie” you might prefer the touch screen Dakota or Oregon units (the Oregon 550 models can also take geotagged [lat-long embedded] photos).\n\nUnless you have one of the recent Garmin units that has preloaded topo maps (indicated with a “t” at the end of the model number) you will want to download free topo maps for Garmin GPS units from GPS File Depot or other web sites. You can also purchase Garmin Topo U.S. 100K or similar Garmin software on DVD or micro SD card, but these can be expensive.\n\nNOTES ON OTHER GPS BRANDS\n\nDelorme Units: These data also work with the Delorme GPS units PN-20 and PN-40, if you also have Delorme Topo software. However, expect loss of track and waypoint attributes (such as colors and symbols) with these and other GPS units that are not in the above recommended list.\n\nOther Units: These GPX files may be compatible with other GPS units, but we have tested these files only with the recommended units listed above. If you are using another unit, it is up to you to determine that your GPS unit can use this GPX data. Before ordering the digital download map files, try downloading this sample GPX file, M09.gpx (our map M9), to ensure that it is compatible with your hardware and software.\n\nAs a Local Work Crew member you will join other volunteers recruited to work on trail projects that are beyond routine maintenance and the capabilities of the individual trail section adopter/steward. Projects might be repairing trail erosion, clearing downed trees, repairing bridges and structures, and the like. Projects are usually one day or less. Work parties are typically organized by the club or organization sponsoring the section or by the FLTC’s Regional Trail Coordinator for the area.\n\nMany of our Local Work Crew members also have their own trail section they maintain.\n\nTrail work projects are announced by e-mail and by local websites and newsletters. Let your trails chairperson, trail sponsor, or regional trail coordinator know if you will join the crew as this will greatly help with planning.\n\nYour trails chairperson, trail sponsor, or regional trail coordinator will be responsible for reporting total hours of trail work, drive time, and administrative time.\n\nTo join your local trail work crew, simply contact your trails chairperson, trail sponsor, or regional trail coordinator and get your name on the distribution list."
