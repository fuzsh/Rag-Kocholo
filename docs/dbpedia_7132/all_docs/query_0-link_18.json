        "text": "OK. SO you’ve bought the ring and chilled the champagne. Now, you’re mustering up enough courage to ask the big question this Valentine’s Day. But where to do it? If you’re on a budget like most, you may as well scrap the idea of Paris or Venice or even the Hawaiian Islands. The truth is Ulster County might very well be the place to ask for your lover’s hand in marriage, and Rick Remsnyder and the gang at the tourism department have a nifty idea for you. Call it “the bridge to love.” They’re promoting the county’s five covered bridges as the ideal spots to pop the question. It may come as a surprise for some that Ulster County does indeed have five of the state’s 29 covered bridges–Perrine’s in the town Esopus; Turnwood in Olivebridge; Grant’s Mill and Myer’s in Hardenburgh; and the Tappan Bridge in North Seager. “Few things are more romantic than a covered bridge,” said Remsnyder. “They’re beautiful outdoor settings guaranteed to leave your girlfriend starry-eyed.” Naturally, he and the others at the tourism department want lovers to discover the simple, rustic settings of Ulster County, especially at this time of year. With the exception of the ski centers, winter tends to be a little slower than other seasons when it comes to attracting tourists. “Valentine’s Day tends to be a popular time to propose, and I can just see the young man stealing his girl’s heart by bringing her here to one of our bridges,” Remsnyder said. Warmer temperatures certainly will be in his favor. Although light snow is forecast for Valentine’s Day, the temperatures will once again climb into the 40s. If you do decide to pop the question at the bridges, you might want to know a little bit about each one before you head over there. The closest to Kingston is Perrine’s Bridge on Route 213. The bridge perched above the Wallkill River was built in the Burr-arch style in 1844 by Benjamin Wood. The 138-foot span is New York’s second oldest covered bridge next to the Hyde Hall covered bridge in East Springfield, built in 1823. Perrine’s Bridge, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was fully restored 20 years ago. It is closed to traffic, but pedestrians can safely walk through it. Another spot Remsnyder likes is the Olive or Turnwood Bridge located on the grounds of the Ashokan Center in Olivebridge. The bridge, a town lattice design, is a 62-foot long, single-span structure crossing the old channel of the Esopus Creek. Built in 1885 by Nelson Tompkins, the bridge is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was moved to its current location in 1930. The remaining bridges can be found in the town of Hardenburgh, in the northwestern corner of the county, deep in the Catskill Mountains. One of them is the Tappan Bridge, in North Seager (a tiny hamlet in Ulster County). The 43-foot span crossing Dry Brook was built by Jerome Moot in 1870 and is open to vehicular traffic with a few pull-offs nearby for parking. One mile from there on Dry Brook Road is the Myers Bridge, a modern-day covered bridge built in 1990. The bridge is a steel stringer with a concrete deck and an added wooden cover with a simulated kingpost truss. There’s also the Grants Mills Bridge, a 66-foot span crossing Mill Brook. Built in 1902 by Edgar Marks, Orrin B. Marks and Wesley Alton, it is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. You can get there by heading south of state Route 30 on Mill Brook Road in Hardenburgh. Whichever bridge you choose to “pop the question” on, Remsnyder thinks she’ll say yes. “Yes, I can’t imagine she wouldn’t,” he said. “And that young man will certainly get points for creativity.” For more information on the county’s covered bridges, go to\n\nwww.ulstertourism.info\n\nor call Ulster County Tourism at 845-340-3567\n\nPMitchell@freemanonline.com\n\n;\n\ntwitter.com/anchor\n\n@freeman"
