        "text": "NYACK – Returning “Tappan Zee” to the name of the bridge that crosses the Hudson River between Westchester and Rockland could happen if the State Assembly takes action by Friday night when the legislature adjourned for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe Senate has already approved a name change from the Governor Mario Cuomo bridge to the Cuomo Tappan Zee Bridge. Including both names was seen as a compromise name instead of removing former Governor Mario Cuomo from the strcture all together. His so0n, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, pushjed the name change to his father while the younger Cuomo was governor.\n\nThe Senate measure was sponsored by James Skoufis (D, Cornwall), who said “the name change remains a grievance for any local residents who value our region’s history.”"
