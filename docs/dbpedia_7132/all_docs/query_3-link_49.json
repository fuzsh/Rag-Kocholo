        "text": "The New York State Thruway Authority Board of Directors officially approved a toll adjustment for the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge. This announcement comes after a 10-month process which included five public hearings to consider public input and concerns.\n\nThe Mario Cuomo bridge spans the Hudson River between Tarrytown in Westchester County to Nyack in Rockland. Son of the bridge’s namesake, Governor Andrew Cuomo, christened the bridge in 2018. This structure replaced the former crossing previously called, the Tappan Zee Bridge. At this time, there’s still debate over what to call the bridge.\n\nSet to take effect on January 1st, 2024, this adjustment marks the first increase for System-wide NY E-ZPass customers in 14 years. Obviously under pressure from motorists, officials emphasize the necessity of these changes to sustain the safety and reliability of the thruway.\n\n“The Thruway Authority receives no dedicated federal, state, or local tax dollars and relies primarily on toll dollars to maintain and operate the thruway, which is one of the safest and reliable toll roads in the country,” stated Thruway Authority Board of Directors Chair Joanne Mahoney.\n\nStarting in 2024, the fixed toll rate for NY E-ZPass customers using the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge will incrementally increase by 50 cents each year through 2027. By 2027, the base NY E-ZPass rate for passenger vehicles will reach $7.75. Commercial toll rate increases will be directly proportionate to the passenger rate increases.\n\nCurrently, the toll for E-ZPass holders stands at $5.75. But, in just a few months, it will rise to $6.25, affecting daily commuters and travelers alike.\n\nComparisons\n\nDespite these increases, the plan retains the 40 percent commuter discount plan. It also extends the resident discount from 17 percent to 20 percent for qualified Rockland and Westchester residents. Notably in 2021, discounted commuter and resident plans accounted for over 30 percent of tolls collected on the Cuomo Bridge. Therefore, the significance of these programs for local communities is substantial.\n\nAs we approach the start of these toll increases, motorists are encouraged to prepare for the forthcoming adjustments by exploring available discount plans to alleviate the impact on their budgets."
