        "text": "Reading Time: 11 minutes\n\nThe River That Flows Two Ways, America’s Rhine, North River, the dividing line between New York and New Jersey, and even the supposed inspiration for Melville’s “Moby Dick:” New York’s Hudson River is known as many different things by many different people!\n\nIf you’re a city slicker, you’ll love the chance to cast your line from the Big Apple itself, New York City. Looking for some peace and quiet surrounded by stunning scenery? Head upstate on your Hudson River fishing adventure, and you’ll truly get back to nature.\n\nWhat doesn’t ever seem to change, however, is the sheer number of incredible angling opportunities that this 315-mile river offers.\n\nFlowing south through East New York from its starting point in the Adirondack Mountains, and eventually emptying out into the Atlantic Ocean at Hudson Bay, this river has stood the test of time as a fisherman’s favorite.\n\nWhy? Well, it runs through what is arguably the most famous city in the USA, for starters. The river’s popularity also comes down to the diversity of fishing grounds it offers – and the species, of course! Let’s put it into perspective. If you started at the top of the river and followed it through to the end, you’d be greeted by no less than 220 varieties of fish.\n\nBelow, we’ve outlined the top species you can catch, how you can hook them, and some of our favorite hotspots. Get ready to fish the Hudson River your way. It’s up to you whether that means fulfilling an “everlasting itch for things remote” – as Herman Melville said – in the upstate streams and tributaries, or embarking on an NYC adventure that’s unlike any other!\n\nBest Fish to Catch in the Hudson River\n\nThe upper Hudson River is freshwater through-and-through, with sparkling mountain streams and tributaries that are perfect to lazily drift down. It’s also the place to cast a line for some prized fish, including Bass and Trout.\n\nThe lower river around New York City, however, is a tidal estuary. Salty seawater enters the Hudson to form brackish waters, which reach all the way up to Troy. This is where you’ll find the river’s much-lauded Striped Bass population, as well as the many anglers that flock here to battle these hard-fighters!\n\nSpeaking of Striper, we’re going to flip things a little and explore what species are on offer here from south to north. We’ll start with brackish waters and move on to freshwaters. This gives us ample opportunity to shine a light on this Hudson River staple first…\n\nStriped Bass\n\nIt’s long been said that a Hudson River fishing adventure is incomplete without some Striped Bass battling. Who are we to disagree? The facts speak for themselves – and the facts are that an estimated one to two billion Striper can be found here during springtime!\n\nThis game fish favorite, also known locally as “Rockfish,” migrates up to brackish and freshwater during spawning season. This usually takes place from April–June. So what does this mean when it comes to hooking Striper in the Hudson?\n\nWell, the entire lower half of the river is made up of brackish waters, thanks to the Atlantic Ocean. When April comes around, Striper start flocking to New York City’s Lower New York Bay in huge droves. City-dwellers in need of some angling action will be spoiled for choice! The Bronx, Queens, and Manhattan all provide plenty of departure points.\n\nTop-quality Striper fishing in the Hudson isn’t just limited to New York City, though. As the summer days pass by and the river’s currents move, so do the Striper. Anglers further upstream will find plenty to hook their lines into.\n\nThe Catskills region of New York sees a Striper boom around May. The “starting point” of the Hudson River’s brackish fishery, Albany, welcomes this fish in June. You also have the chance to hook them on their way back to the Atlantic, too!\n\nThe Hudson River widens and deepens considerably after the Federal Dam in Troy. Bottom fishing and trolling are recommended by experienced fishermen. You’ll cover a lot more ground using these techniques! Hudson River Rockfish reach up to 60 pounds, so why wouldn’t you want to increase your chances of hooking your very own trophy catch?\n\nBluefish\n\nAnother game fish favorite, this species is considered one of the river’s main summertime spectacles. It’s incredibly popular with Hudson River fishing enthusiasts. Like the Striper, Bluefish is a saltwater staple that migrates to brackish and freshwaters during spawning season.\n\nThese fierce, aggressive predators provide plenty of action at the end of a fishing line. They grow up to 19 pounds in the Hudson – nothing to sniff at! Similar to Stripers, they’re only here for a limited amount of time, thanks to their spawning habits.\n\nLooking to cast a line from New York City? Head to favored Bluefish spot Croton Point. You’ll be able to catch these fish on their journey upriver in June.\n\nBy August, these fish can be targeted from the city all the way up to the waters around Tappan Zee Bridge. They tend to stick around until October. Although the Bluefish population thins out somewhat after this point, fishermen further upstate will still find some lucrative spots. New Hamburg and Poughkeepsie are particularly productive.\n\nA good rule of thumb is the wetter the weather, the further downstream the Bluefish! If you’re fishing upstream from the Tappan Zee Bridge, casting your line during hot, dry weather is your best bet. July–September are the best months.\n\nLargemouth and Smallmouth Bass\n\nWhen it comes to freshwater fishing, these Bass species cause just as much of a reaction as Striped Bass does for saltwater enthusiasts!\n\nWhy is that? Well, what it may be lacking in stature, the Smallmouth Bass more than makes up for in spirit! It provides great sport for anglers of all ages and skill levels.\n\nNewer anglers will enjoy the thrill of battling a game fish without the fear of aching arms or being pulled overboard into the river. More experienced anglers can switch out regular gear for light tackle or fly fishing equipment and test their skills.\n\nAnd the Largemouth Bass? For many anglers, part of the thrill of hooking this fish is down to its intelligence. Yep, you read that correctly! Hooking one of these beauties means you’ve triumphed with mind over matter. This will give you plenty of bragging rights!\n\nIn addition to the game qualities that these fish hold, size is what makes anglers flock to the Hudson River. We’re talking about the water as well as the fish!\n\nThe Hudson River is home to miles and miles of shoreline. This provides an especially exciting and imposing challenge to Bass anglers used to smaller lakes and waterways.\n\nNew York State’s capital city, Albany, is a preferred freshwater Bass fishing spot for local anglers, especially from June through November. Head to the waters north of the Federal Dam and cast your line around shoreline vegetation and lay-down trees.\n\nFor anglers further upstream, the waters around Hamilton County and the Hudson River Gorge are a must-visit. The fishing town of Catskill is also productive. You’ll soon be in for a Bass bonanza!\n\nCatfish\n\nOkay, so it’s true that once upon a time, the Hudson River was given a nickname that we neglected to mention before: the Dirty Stream.\n\nIt’s true that it isn’t quite the picture-perfect, sparkling blue that we’ve come to expect from our waterways. However, there’s a good reason why it’s murkier in color. It’s all thanks to the algae and plankton that make these waters so fish-friendly!\n\nAnd there’s one species in particular that just thrives in murky, muddy waters: the Catfish. The Hudson River is home to an impressive variety of this species: White, Channel, and Brown Bullhead. They occasionally make their way to the saltier waters of the lower Hudson but prefer to frolic in the freshwaters.\n\nLocals in the know recommend heading to upstream tributaries for your Catfish catch. The Wallkill River and Rondout Creek are especially popular hotspots. As Catfish prefer murkier waters and are famous bottom-feeders, the best way to hook them is from a boat. This will allow you to reach deeper sections of the river.\n\nIn fact, fishing for Catfish on the Hudson River can turn into a real slice of peace and nature. Many anglers like to drift down these waters and slow troll for their catch.\n\nPrefer to fish from the banks of the river? The best time to cast your line is very early in the morning or very late in the evening. This is when Catfish like to feed, which means they make their way to shallower waters in search of food. You’ll find plenty of whiskery friends on offer!\n\n…And More\n\nThese waters are bustling with over 200 species, after all! The following fish may be less hard-fighting and prestigious than the ones listed above. The magic of the Hudson River, however, is that there’s enough room for a whole host of species. This means there’s something that’ll appeal to every type of angler.\n\nPrefer testing your skills against Trout to fighting huge Bass downstream? The Hamilton County section of the Hudson River is the perfect spot for Rainbow, Brook, and Brown Trout.\n\nThe waters here range from small, gentle pools to rough, fast-moving areas. Less-experienced anglers can get some fishing experience under their belts. Hardened fishermen can battle the elements as well as their target species!\n\nWishing for a Walleye or two? You’ll be pleased to hear that this species is thriving in the Hudson River. The Hudson River estuary just below the Troy Dam is an unmissable hotspot. The upper Hudson River around Stillwater and Hudson Falls also provides Walleye action.\n\nFinally, there’s a variety of Perch to be found in these waters, with White and Yellow being the most popular. Unlike most of the lake’s freshwater fish, White Perch prefer the somewhat salty waters from Northern Manhattan to Albany. They’re commonly caught from the river’s banks.\n\nAlternatively, Yellow Perch tend to stick to the pure freshwaters of the river. Areas upstream from Albany are your best bet.\n\nHow to Go Fishing in the Hudson River\n\nNow you know all about the top fish that call the Hudson River home – and hopefully, a thing or two about where to catch them! But how, exactly, should you go about hooking them?\n\nBy Boat\n\nNew to fishing the Hudson River (or fishing in general)? The best option is to cast off alongside an experienced guide.\n\nMany of the charter boats dotted around the Hudson River are piloted by local and knowledgeable captains. They’ll provide you with invaluable tips and tricks when it comes to exploring these waters. Even better? If there’s a certain fish you’d like to target, they’ll know where to take you for the hottest bite.\n\nLooking to fish the brackish waters around New York City or Albany? You’ll be spoiled for choice when it comes to picking out a charter. Most captains will have plenty of experience catering to families and anglers still discovering their sea legs, too.\n\nWant to fish the freshwater upstream? It’s all a case of knowing where to go. Some locations that provide direct access to the river may be small, but they’re popular fishing towns or close to natural parks. This means you generally won’t have trouble finding an experienced fisherman to take you on your adventure.\n\nThe cost of a local charter or guide usually covers all the equipment you need in addition to your guide’s expert advice. This is reflected in what you pay. Nothing quite comes close to casting your line alongside someone who knows all the sweet spots and honey holes!\n\nAlthough it’s technically possible to fish the Hudson River from your own boat, it’s not something we’d recommend. Vessels traveling on these waters are subject to strict laws and permits. These waters can also be somewhat unpredictable, thanks to the swift currents and tidal changes.\n\nOn Foot\n\nWant to try fishing the waters of the Hudson River on foot? There are two popular ways to do it. Cast your line straight from the banks, or from one of the many fishing piers that surround it.\n\nGenerally, bank-fishing the Hudson River is suitable for more experienced anglers. Pier fishing is great for budding anglers, as well as families looking for a relaxing activity in the Big Apple. The majority of fishing piers are located a stone’s throw from the center of New York City!\n\nSomething to be aware of when bank fishing is that it can limit the number of species you’ll be able to target. If you’re looking to hook a lunker Striper, bank fishing may not be the best way to go!\n\nIt’s the perfect way to get back to basics and really feel at one with the nature surrounding you, though. Anglers who choose this method of fishing generally target upstream freshwater fish such as Yellow Perch and nighttime Catfish.\n\nPier fishing, however, does lend itself to reeling in species of all sizes and temperaments. It’s also an extremely accessible way for anglers of all skill levels to cast a line in the Hudson River!\n\nYou’ll find plenty of piers dotted all around New York City, especially near national parks. They definitely vary in quality, however. The New York City government parks website lists every fishing pier, both freshwater and saltwater, in the city, and is a great place to start.\n\nThe main downside of fishing from the banks or a pier is that you have to make sure you’re fully aware of local rules and regulations. New York’s fishing laws are some of the strictest around.\n\nPiers can also get pretty busy, as they tend to be located around the bustling city. However, if you’re looking for an accessible and wallet-friendly way to explore this river, this is the way to do it!\n\nWhen to Go Fishing in the Hudson River\n\nThe Hudson River has strict regulations regarding which species you can keep. There are also open and closed seasons for certain species. Generally, statewide regulations apply, with some exceptions.\n\nSpecies Open Season Bag Limit Size Limit Largemouth Bass June 15 – Nov 30 5* 15″ Smallmouth Bass June 15 – Nov 30 5* 15″ Striped Bass Apr 1 – Nov 30 1 18–28″\n\n*Limits cover both Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass. Bear in mind that even catch-and-release fishing is not allowed outside of the designated seasons.\n\nHudson River Fishing Regulations\n\nAlthough we covered a variety of species known for their delicious meat, you may have noticed that we didn’t mention grilling or frying ‘em up into a delicious meal.\n\nThere’s a very important reason for this. Although you can target plenty of tasty table fare in the Hudson River, you actually can’t eat most of it.\n\nThe majority of fish in this river contain chemicals called polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, for short), which are harmful to humans when consumed. If you’re fishing in the Upper Hudson River, between South Glens Falls Dam and the Troy Dam, you shouldn’t keep or eat anything you catch.\n\nWhether or not you’ll need a New York Fishing License depends on which part of the Hudson River you want to go fishing in! Freshwater enthusiasts will need to purchase a NY freshwater fishing license to explore these waters.\n\nIf you’re casting your line for species that migrate from the ocean to freshwaters to spawn, such as Striped Bass and Bluefish, you don’t need a freshwater license. You do need to enroll in the Recreational Marine Fishing Registry, though.\n\nPhew! Last but not least, it’s important to remember that the fish of the Hudson River have been through some tough times. This means there’s a lot of focus on preservation and safe catch-and-release here.\n\nBecause of this, employ non-offset circle hooks when using live bait to battle your target species. They allow for the fish to be removed from the hook and safely returned to the river.\n\nThe Hudson: A River of Many Names and Many Opportunities\n\nNo matter what you want to call it, it’s fair to say that the Hudson River is as all-American as it gets: resilient, diverse, and triumphant. It only makes sense that it leads directly to what many consider to be the beating heart of the USA, New York City: a city that stands for all of these things, and more.\n\nAnd really, what better place to cast your line on an angling adventure? We said at the beginning of this post that the Hudson River is many different things to many different people. Come discover what a Hudson River fishing adventure means to you!\n\nHave you ever been fishing in the Hudson River? What was your best catch? We’d love to hear from you in the comments below!"
