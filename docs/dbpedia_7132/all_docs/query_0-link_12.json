        "text": "Find the right spot this Valentine’s Day – Ulster’s got five of them\n\nKINGSTON, N.Y. (Feb. 1, 2012) – Valentine’s Day will soon be upon us and as is customary during this romantic holiday, many couples will become engaged. Those looking for a unique spot to “pop” the question should look no further than Ulster County, N.Y., where, with the right bit of planning, those soon to be betrothed will find passionately beautiful outdoor settings guaranteed to leave their love starry-eyed.\n\nFew things are more romantic than a covered bridge and Ulster County has five of them with all but one open to the public. Romeos seeking these quixotic locations need not travel too far – one of them can be found 10 minutes outside of New Paltz in the town of Esopus. Perrine’s Bridge, a 154-foot single span Burr Arch bridge built in 1844 and fully restored in 1992 is perched over the Wallkill River on Route 213 as it heads toward Kingston. Closed to vehicular traffic, its convenient parking lot and lovely little park make this the perfect spot to ask for someone’s hand on a moonlit night.\n\nThe Olive or Turnwood Bridge, located on the grounds of the Ashokan Center in Olivebridge is another easy-to-find historic covered bridge. The center is a green, sustainable learning community dedicated to allowing visitors to experience nature, history and the arts. It also happens to host weddings. The bridge, a town lattice design, is a 62-foot long, single-span structure crossing the old channel of the Esopus Creek that was built in 1889 and moved to its current location in 1930.\n\nThe remaining two bridges can be found in the Town of Hardenburgh, in the northwestern corner of the county, deep in the Catskill Mountains. This remote, rural area is home to five of the Catskills’ 35 high peaks and the only way into this Ulster County town is through Sullivan or Delaware counties.\n\nThe Tappan Bridge, in North Seager (a tiny hamlet in Ulster County), can be found southeast of Arkville off Dry Brook Road, crossing Dry Brook. Built in 1870 by Jerome Moot this King Truss, 43-foot long, single-span bridge is open to vehicular traffic with a few pull-offs nearby for parking (for directions to all bridges see below).\n\nThe Grants Mills Bridge, on Mill Brook Road just across the Delaware-Ulster County line, is also in Hardenburgh. Built in 1902 and completely rehabilitated in 1992, this 66-foot historic covered bridge is closed to vehicular traffic. Parking spaces near the bridge make this an easy place to access.\n\nIn addition to historic covered bridges, Ulster County has two romantic shelters, which look like but are not actually, authentic covered bridges. The easiest of these to access, The Friendship Manor Covered Bridge, serves as the entrance to the Belleayre Mountain Day Use Area at the base of Belleayre Mountain in the hamlet of Pine Hill. The 72-foot long, single-span carries Lake Street over Birch Creek. The other, Meyers Bridge, is mile from the Tappan Bridge.\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\nPerrine’s Bridge\n\nFrom NYS Thruway Exit 18 turn left onto Route 299 West/Main Street. Remain on Main Street. At fourth light turn right onto Route 32 NY/North Chestnut Street for 4.9 miles. Turn right onto Route 213 East. Parking on right and park on left.\n\nThe Olive or Turnwood Bridge\n\nFrom NYS Thruway Exit 19 at the traffic circle take the third exit to NY-28 West for 11.5 miles to the hamlet of Shokan. Turn left at Winchell’s Pizza onto Reservoir Road. Follow road across Ashokan Reservoir Bridge and turn left at the ‘T’ onto Monument Road. Stay on Monument Road/Route 28A to second left (past DEP Police Station) onto Beaverkill Road. Continue for 1 mile to Ashokan Center.\n\nTappan Bridge\n\nFrom NYS Thruway Exit 19 Kingston at the traffic circle, take the third exit onto NY-28 W to Arkville to Dry Brook Road. Remain on Dry Brook Road/County Route 49 for 8.5 miles. Bridge will be on left.\n\nGrants Mills Bridge\n\nFrom NYS Thruway Exit 19 Kingston at the traffic circle, take the third exit onto NY-28 West for 35.0 miles. Turn left onto County Road 49A/Gelli Curci Road (see signs for Belleayre Mountain). Remain on road for 1.5 miles to a slight left onto High Mount-Mapledale Road. Take that 0.2 miles and continue on onto County Road 49A/Gelli Curci Road for 1.6 miles. Take slight left onto Todd Mountain Road and follow for 2.2 miles to a left onto County Road 49/Dry Brook Road Remain on Dry Brook Road for 1.4 miles. Turn right onto Mill Brook Road for 3.3 mile. Bridge will be on right.\n\nMeyers Bridge\n\nBuilt in 1990, this bridge is actually a steel stringer bridge with a concrete deck. It is in Ulster County just one mile from the Tappan Bridge. This is a strange looking covered bridge; it’s height is out of proportion to historical covered bridges because higher clearance was required. A large skew angle is also unusual.\n\nThe Friendship Manor Covered Bridge\n\nFrom NYS Thruway Exit 19 Kingston at the traffic circle, take the third exit onto NY-28 West for 33.0 miles. Turn left onto Friendship Manor Road, then right onto Lake Street.\n\nOTHER ROMANTIC SPOTS\n\nAwosting Falls, Minnewaska State Park, Route 44/55, New Paltz, NY; 845-255-0752; http://nysparks.com/parks/127/details.aspx\n\nWith three crystalline sky lakes, 35 miles of carriage trails and 25 miles of hiking trails, pretty much anyplace here is a great place to propose but by far the most breathtaking is Awosting Falls. Just a short walk from the main entrance is a 60-foot waterfall dropping off into a rock shrouded pool surrounded by the forest.\n\nIce Rink at Mohonk Mountain House, 1000 Mountain Rest Road, New Paltz, NY 12561; 800-772-6646, 845-255-1000; info@mohonk.com; www.mohonk.com\n\nA 9,375-square-foot refrigerated ice rink, one of the largest in the Hudson Valley, under a beautiful wooden pavilion. The 39-foot-tall stone fireplace makes it the perfect place to cuddle up before asking the question.\n\nKaleidostore, 5340 Route 28, Mt. Tremper, NY 12457; 845-688-5800; info@emersonresort.com; www.emersonresort.com\n\nWhy not take your sweetie to the world’s largest kaleidoscope located at the Emerson Country Store at The Emerson in Mount Tremper?
