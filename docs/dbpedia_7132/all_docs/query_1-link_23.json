This stylized version of the Connecticut seal's grape vines appears on other parkway bridges, tying this example to the overall theme of using symbolic design elements unique to the state. 00796 Yale Avenue over Route 15 Wallingford Concrete continuous tee beam 1947 This bridge should be evaluated in the context of the construction of the Wilbur Cross Parkway in the immediate Post-World War II period.

It also has deep girders. It also spans a major river on an important US highway. 054B00042N US-41 over drainage ditch Hopkins County Concrete culvert 1955 This bridge displays a railing that may be unique to KY. At 7 spans, it is also the longest box culvert structure in the state and is unusual in that other bridge types are normally more economical for spans of this length. The long, low design reflects a response to the geology and hydrography of the overflow ditch. 072B00020N KY-453 over Barkley Canal Lyon County Steel stringer/multibeam or girder 1946 This bridge was built as part of the development of Lake Barkley. It is an early example of the use of a haunched continuous welded steel plate girder, economical for long spans. Bridges of this type later exhibited structural problems due to welds and many have required replacement or major repairs. 096B00018N US-27 over CSX RR-CR 5011-Kennedy B Pendleton County Steel continuous stringer/multibeam or girder 1946 This bridge spans a major rail line on an important US highway. It is an early example of the use of the continuous steel beam in KY, though not the earliest. It also has decorative piers, something seen in many bridges built when passenger rail was common. It was also designed in 1945, the cut off year for the Program Comment. 097B00046N KY-3195 over Leatherwood Creek Perry County Concrete tee beam 1946 This is the only single lane bridge in KY with this railing type. It is a non-standard design, as most concrete highway bridges were designed to accommodate two lanes wide enough for modern vehicles. It was also designed in 1945, the cut off year for the Program Comment. 097B00082N Memorial Drive over Memorial Drive-KY-15Bus Perry Steel stringer/multibeam or girder 1950 The Hazard Relief Route was built to relieve congestion caused by 9000 cars a day that travelled on Main St. and was typical of post-war highway projects. The Memorial Dr. underpass over the bypass was built at a pre-existing curve surrounded by dense housing necessitating a superelevated, skewed design. The use of I-beams in such a configuration is unique and the design clearly responds to locational constraints. It also has a decorative, standard handrail that follows the curvature of the deck. The bridge was featured in a 1952 highway department pamphlet. 107B00005N KY-73 over W Fk Drakes Creek Simpson County Concrete tee beam 1954 Part of park 111X00002N IC-8036 N over service road Trigg County Concrete slab 1968 This is the Lake Barkley State Park Lodge entrance bridge. Edward Durell Stone, an internationally known mid-century architect, designed the Lake Barkley Lodge and this structure. Aesthetic details include patterned concrete piers and a non-standard metal railing. Stone also helped design the Verrazano Narrows bridge in NY, along with many famous buildings. This appears to be the only other example nationwide of his design applied to a bridge.
