        "text": "The Tappan Zee Bridge: Not Quite Long Enough to Throw a Frisbee Across (But Still Pretty Darn Long)\n\nAh, the Tappan Zee Bridge. A majestic titan of steel and concrete, stretching gracefully across the Hudson River in New York. But how graceful? How majestic? Well, that depends on how you measure majesty...by length, of course!\n\nMiles of Smiles (or Mild Disappointment, Depending on Your Frisbee Skills)\n\nThe Tappan Zee Bridge clocks in at a respectable 3.1 miles (or 16,368 feet, for you sticklers). That's a whole lotta bridge, folks. You could practically walk it...if you had, like, all day and a serious podcast backlog.\n\nBut here's the thing: is 3.1 miles long enough to throw a frisbee across? Let's be honest, that's the real question burning in everyone's mind (or at least the minds of competitive frisbee enthusiasts). The answer? Probably not. Even Olympic-level frisbee throwers (is that a thing?) would likely struggle with a 3.1-mile yeet.\n\nSo, the Tappan Zee Bridge: long enough for a scenic commute, not long enough for an epic frisbee battle royale.\n\nA Bridge With a (Very Brief) History Lesson\n\nThe Tappan Zee Bridge we know and love today isn't actually the original. The first bridge, built in the 1950s, was a trooper, but it eventually reached retirement age (bridges can retire, right?). In 2017, a brand new, shiny, and slightly-longer bridge took its place.\n\nFun fact: The bridge is named after the Tappan people, a Native American tribe who lived in the area, and the Dutch word \"zee\" which means \"sea.\" So next time you cross the bridge, you can impress your friends with your newfound knowledge of Dutch etymology!\n\nFAQ: You've Got Questions, We've Got (Hopefully) Brief Answers\n\nHow to get to the Tappan Zee Bridge? Easy! Just follow the signs for the New York State Thruway (I-87 and I-287).\n\nHow much does it cost to cross the Tappan Zee Bridge? No toll booths here, folks! It's free to cross.\n\nHow long does it take to drive across the Tappan Zee Bridge? That depends on traffic, but under normal conditions, it shouldn't take you more than 10-15 minutes.\n\nHow tall is the Tappan Zee Bridge? The bridge itself is 419 feet tall, but the clearance for boats underneath is 139 feet.\n\nHow many frisbees do you think you could fit on the Tappan Zee Bridge? That's a question for the philosophers, my friend."
