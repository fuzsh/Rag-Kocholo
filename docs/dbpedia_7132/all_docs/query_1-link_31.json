        "text": "Bachelor Brook/Stony Brook Conservation Resource Area (285 acres)\n\nThis 285-acre parcel is the largest and most biologically diverse of the properties owned by the town. It was acquired in 2005 with a $500,000 Self-Help Grant and a $300,000 donation from Mount Holyoke College, in addition to approximately $700,000 of local funds including from the Conservation Commissionâ€™s dedicated fund. Most of the property lies north of Ferry Street, abuts the Connecticut River and Bachelor Brook. A smaller portion of this area lies south of Ferry Street, along Stony Brook. At present, the area is largely undisturbed, but is traversed by major power line easements and a small portion is farmed by a local farmer under an agreement with the Town. Among the unique features of this property are two of the best examples in the state of small floodplain forests and numerous rare habitats.\n\nDue to its access to the Connecticut River and proximity to the Mount Holyoke Range, the River to Range Trail was established in 2018. The trail loops from Ferry Street, along the Connecticut River, and up to Bachelor Brook. Improvements in 2019 have extended the system of improved hiking trails to the north side of Bachelor Brook using the Route 47 bridge as access. The River to Range Trail hard pack surface trail loops from a parking lot at 240 Ferry Street, along the river, and into to the Bachelor Brook floodplain forest.\n\nThere are three trailheads with parking at the property: 240 Ferry Street, 100 Hadley Street at the Town Farm, and Hadley Street (Rt 47) on the south side of the bridge over Bachelor Brook.\n\nThe system of hiking trails to the north side of Bachelor Brook area accessed by crossing the Hadley St (Rt 47) bridge on foot to the trailhead. The northern trails take you through an old forest, up Dry Brook Hill and follows the edge of the property to meet up with the power lines. There is an excellent vista of the Connecticut River and Mount Tom from the top of the hill."
