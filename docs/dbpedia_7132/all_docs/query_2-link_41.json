        "text": "New York State agencies gave final approvals in January 2013 to a $3.142 billion contract with Tappan Zee Constructors to build a new crossing of the Hudson River to replace the Tappan Zee Bridge.\n\nThe new bridge will consist of two spans, one for eastbound traffic and the other for westbound. Each span will have four general traffic lanes, one lane for express bus service plus wide shoulders for emergency breakdowns. The north, or westbound span, will also include a bicycle and pedestrian path with five scenic overlooks. The new bridge will be built with the strength to handle future mass transit such as light rail or commuter rail. Construction of the bridge has begun.\n\nPlanning for mass transit will continue through 2013. County Executive Robert P. Astorino has been requested by Governor Andrew Cuomo to serve on a task force that will formulate a fiscally viable and prioritized list of short, medium and long-term recommendations for the implementation of new transit services along the I-287 corridor. The creation of the task force was called for in 2012 by the County Executive and the county executives of Rockland and Putnam counties so that transit would not be an afterthought in the progress being made on the construction of the new bridge. The 28-member task force is to meet monthly and issue a final report by December 2013. County Planning Department staff will serve a technical support role working with the state agencies to develop transit scenarios and concepts for consideration by the task force.\n\nThe imminent construction of the new bridge and the planning for transit services provide exciting opportunities for Westchester County. The new bridge is the largest transportation design-build project to date in the United States and one of the largest construction contracts in New York State history. Tens of thousands of jobs will be created or sustained over the construction timeline of five years and three months.\n\nBusiness, Employment and Apprenticeship Opportunities\n\nWestchester County will be providing information on opportunities that the new bridge construction project will offer for businesses, employment and apprenticeships.\n\nTransit and Community Development Opportunities\n\nThe Westchester County Planning Board and County Department of Planning have worked with the eight municipalities along I-287 that could be affected by new transit services to make sure the outcome of the state’s planning process would support the vision of the towns, villages and cities along the corridor. Specifically, much work has been done with local communities to explore how a Bus Rapid Transit system can support local land use strategies. This work will continue as new east-west transit concepts are developed in 2013.\n\nAn interactive planning program, Repurposing the I-287 Corridor in Westchester County, sponsored by the New York-Connecticut Sustainable Communities Consortium and the Urban Land Institute and supported by Westchester County, was held on December 5, 2012. The program informed interested stakeholders about conditions in the I-287 corridor from Tarrytown to Port Chester and about strategies for improving those conditions. Residents, real estate and planning professionals and local officials discussed options, issues and opportunities for repurposing of many of the older single-use office parks, retail centers and institutional properties along the corridor. The program summary prepared by the County Department of Planning based on notes collected by the Consortium members outlines the topics discussed and comments received from the attendees.\n\nA 2010 report by the County Department of Planning, Office Park Housing – Adapting Underutilized Office Parks for Housing, shows the feasibility of developing affordable housing on unused office park land. Several existing office parks in the I-287 corridor are discussed in the study; they are zoned for high development density, have adequate infrastructure and have excess parking spaces. The analysis demonstrated that it is feasible to add the housing to the sites with little impact on traffic, utilities or parking.\n\nLearn More\n\nTo learn more about the key opportunities associated with the new Tappan Zee bridge and the I-287 corridor use the navigation menu to the upper left. The information will be updated as more data becomes available.\n\nContact Information\n\nVisit the official Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project Web site."
