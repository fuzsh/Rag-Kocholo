        "text": "Turkey Jim: NH-05-07\n\nThe Branch Brook ripped apart the campground and its bridges. The covered bridge washed down, into the road bridge and destroyed both crossings. There may be enough salvageable time to justify rebuilding the covered bridge.\n\nhttp://ulocal.wmur.com/_Turkey-Jims-Bridge-runs-into-Campground-ridge/photo/14886231/63455.html\n\nTurkey Jim's CB after Irene\n\nBlair: NH-05-09\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/editphoto.php?fbid=260466863973878&aid=63638&id=100000316981085#!/media/set/?set=a.260466863973878.63638.100000316981085&type=1\n\nTuscarora: NY-13-05\n\nSubstantial damage - folks are looking for names of individuals to repair it. Can any one assist?\n\nSchoharie County official declares state of emergency\n\nMill Brook: NY-56-06\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/l/eAQBKG89cAQBtFKEpsvnTJKj6HygMw1FpcxK_R4RlgkLxoA/www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x18oqlWd8M\n\nPinetown: PA-36-05\n\nThe Pinetown covered bridge bowed from the pressure of several feet of water. It also shifted on its piers and will have to be removed so it can be repaired. It could be a year at least until it's reopened.\n\nhttp://lancasteronline.com/article/local/468507_Lancaster-County-reckons-bridge-damage.html\n\nBartonsville: VT-13-11\n\nCompletely destroyed\n\nA nice article on the Bartonsville Bridge:\n\nhttp://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20110906/NEWS02/709069982/1003/NEWS02\n\nhttp://www.wcax.com/story/15349160/wcax-viewers-document-deadly-storm-in-vt\n\nhttp://www.weather.com/weather/videos/news-41/top-stories-169/caught-on-cam-covered-bridge-collapse-21731\n\nUPDATE - Below is a link for an article about rebuilding Bartonsville Bridge (VT-13-11) and information about Worrall Bridge (VT-13-10) and Hall Bridge (VT-13-07 #2). Bartonsville Bridge was insured for $1 million. Anyone wishing to donate to the bridge rebuilding effort can find more information at: www.rockbf.org.\n\nhttp://www.rutlandherald.com/article/20110901/NEWS02/709019918/1003/NEWS02\n\nBowers - VT-14-11\n\nDamaged - Note link refers to this as the Best Bridge, but it is actually the Bowers Covered Bridge.\n\nhttp://ireport.cnn.com/open-story.jspa?openStoryID=655725#DOC-665973\n\nThe south abutment toppled into the stream, bridge was swept away but failed to maneuver around the first bend and landed upright and nearly intact on top of a bank about 150 yards downstream. One portal frame is missing, a couple post-to-plate and knee brace connections failed, but it can definitely be repaired and moved back to where it belongs. The bridge conveniently landed in a clearing with easy access to the road heading back to the crossing. South abutment is a total loss, north abutment is still to be determined.\n\nVermontâs Bowers covered bridge washed away by Irene"
