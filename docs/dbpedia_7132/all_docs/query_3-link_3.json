        "text": "The Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, at 3.1 miles long, is a twin-span, cable-stayed replacement for the old Tappan Zee Bridge, crossing the Hudson River about 25 miles north of New York City. Its eight lanes carry the New York State Thruway, Interstate 87, and Interstate 287 as well as bus lanes during rush hour. Its design includes a shared-use path for pedestrians and cyclists and for future light rail or commuter rail service.\n\nThe 50,000 tons of structural steel that High Steel Structures LLC fabricated support the road deck and infrastructure for the east and west approach spans of the new Tappan Zee bridge.\n\nHeadquartered in Lancaster, Pa., High Steel partnered with Hirschfeld Industries, with headquarters in San Angelo, Texas, to deliver the 100,000 tons of fabricated steel required."
