        "text": "Advance Testing worked as a sub-consultant to HNTB as part of the Owner’s Engineer team, tasked with providing oversight of all activities during construction of the $3.9 billion Mario M. Cuomo Bridge. The new bridges cross the Hudson River between Westchester and Rockland Counties, and provided a completed replacement for the old Tappan Zee Bridge. At the time of construction, the project was New York State’s largest design-build project, and also one of the largest transportation infrastructure projects in North America. The project entailed the construction of two new 3.1-mile cable-stayed spans built to the north of the existing bridge. Advance Testing’s role was to provide a wide variety of materials testing and inspection oversight services, as well as the design, outfitting and operation of an on-site AASHTO-accredited laboratory. Inspection oversight and materials testing work was conducted both on site, as well as in fabrication / production facilities throughout the United States.\n\nClient: HNTB Corporation"
