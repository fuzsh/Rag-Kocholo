        "text": "A large tree that floated down the Pemigewasset River. One of its large branches caught in the opening of the truss and the force of the river pushed it up, through the bridge and through the roof. Luckily, the tree broke free from its destructive appendage and the branch was left, stuck in the bridge. There are a few broken truss members.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/editphoto.php?fbid=260466863973878&aid=63638&id=100000316981085#!/media/set/?set=a.260466863973878.63638.100000316981085&type=1\n\nAccording to a newspaper article, the Blair Bridge will be repaired.\n\nReturn to top\n\nNew York\n\nDelaware County\n\nThere is a lot of information and photographs of the devastation in the Catskill Region on this website. You will need to scroll down through several pages but it is very informative (and very sad).\n\nhttp://www.watershedpost.com/?page=0%2C1\n\nTuscarora - NY-13-05\n\nSubstantial damage - folks are looking for names of individuals to repair it. Can any one assist?\n\nUpdate - The only thing remaining of this bridge is the deck which has substantial dry rot at both ends.\n\nEssex County\n\nJay - NY-16-01 Despite earlier reports in the papers, the Jay Covered Bridge is just fine per the Town Supervisor.\n\nOtsego County\n\nHyde Hall - NY- 39-01\n\nWater came to the very bottom of the bridge and a branch punctured the siding on the bridge. There are a couple of other small puncture areas but bridge is okay.\n\nSchoharie County\n\nBlenheim - NY-48-01\n\nwww.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2249704876042&set=a.1810333492032.103834.1050821205&type=1&theater\n\nhttp://thedailystar.com/localnews/x151681357/Shoharie-County-official-declares-state-of-emergency\n\nThere is a lot of information and photographs of the devastation in North Blenheim on this website. You will need to scroll down through several pages but it is very informative (and extremely sad).\n\nhttp://www.watershedpost.com/?page=0%2C1\n\nVery nice video of Blenheim Covered Bridge 3 weeks ago by Kevin Sullivan.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/l/yAQDXfuTmAQAzI9q6OoNLX7uHxk4Xw5_scO7b0GCBc_rK5A/www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZKDdGwB-sM&feature=related\n\nSullivan County\n\nHalls Mills - NY-53-01\n\nIf something isn't done soon, we will lose this bridge. It has less than half of its stone abutment left. The trees that were within striking distance have been removed.\n\nUlster County\n\nForge - NY-56-02\n\nKingdon Gould, owner of this bridge, has stated that his bridge will be repaired. About 1/3 of the upstream sideboards are gone. There is a large tree through both sides and another through the roof. Tappan - NY-56-03\n\nTappan only had slight sideboard damage but is still safe to drive on.\n\nMill Brook - NY-56-06\n\nThe bridge itself looks okay but there is a lot of scouring around the bridge itself. The historical marker is down. We are very lucky we still have this bridge! The concrete bridge next to the covered bridge stopped all the debris from hitting the Mill Brook bridge. There has been a lot of clean up near this bridge, but still a lot of erosion around the bridge itself.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/l/eAQBKG89cAQBtFKEpsvnTJKj6HygMw1FpcxK_R4RlgkLxoA/www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x18oqlWd8M\n\nReturn to top\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarbon County\n\nLittle Gap - PA-13-01\n\nHigh water pulled away some boards on the downstream side. There was a lot of debris buildup at the bridge but none caused any major damage to the bridge. The link below is an article that appeared in the StandardSpeaker.com about damage in Carbon County.\n\nhttp://standardspeaker.com/news/carbon-oks-disaster-tag-1.1197324#ixzz1Wujs58Zp\n\nLancaster County\n\nEberly/Bitzer's Mill - PA-36-04\n\nhttp://www.dot.state.pa.us/Penndot/Districts/D8news.nsf/a2a8ee9f2c47a24b8525783a004f753a/c2b53c60de7a3db1852578fb00778812?OpenDocument\n\nPinetown - PA-36-05\n\nThe Pinetown covered bridge bowed from the pressure of several feet of water. It also shifted on its piers and will have to be removed so it can be repaired. It could be a year at least until it's reopened.\n\nhttp://lancasteronline.com/article/local/468507_Lancaster-County-reckons-bridge-damage.html\n\nReturn to top\n\nNorthumberland County\n\nRishe1 - PA-49-05 #2\n\nSideboards damaged, water reached about 6 feet up from the flooring.\n\nSulivan County\n\nHillsgrove - PA-57-02\n\nThe newly rebuilt Hillsgrove Covered Bridge has been considerably damaged. Side boards are pulled loose, a tree pierced the bridge and the approaches to the bridge have been washed away.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington County\n\nBridge on the Green (West Arlington) - VT-02-01\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew2kohUJO84\n\nThe bridge was struck by a log during the storm and it is unclear at this point whether or not it is structurally sound.\"\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/l/EAQAYwiNnAQDjIFG3CHM56FtJtAx5Y1YMvJzm-3BfhF_XmQ/www.manchesterjournal.com/headlines/ci_18796339\n\nRutland County\n\nGiorgetti - VT-11-B#2\n\nCompletely Destroyed\n\nBrown - VT-11-09\n\nSome damage\n\nWashington County\n\nUpper (Northfield Falls) - VT-12-11\n\nA tree was thrust entirely through the structure, puncturing the roof from below. The bridge has now been reopened to traffic.\n\nhttp://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/in_hurricane_irenes_wake_vermo.html\n\nVillage - VT-12-14\n\nClosed, abutment damage and minor siding damage.\n\nWarren - VT-12-15 #2\n\nClosed, abutment damage\n\nWindham County\n\nKidder (Grafton) - VT-13-03\n\nDamaged\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LS-YZvTL6c\n\nWilliamsville - VT-13-05 #2\n\nAlthough this clip reports no damage to the actual bridge, there does seem to be some undermining of the abutments.\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/l/DAQAGjhJ5AQCT1HJ4JEdbh3Sfe6uG19QKnc2hu-EWqVgxLA/www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRlE1bc7Mr4&feature=related"
