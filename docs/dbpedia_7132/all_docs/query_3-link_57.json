The bridge, unfortunately, also is known as a favorite jumping off point for suicide victims, thus those many signs along the span declaring: “Life is worth living,” and giving numbers for suicide help lines.\n\nOpened to traffic on December 15, 1955, the bridge has withstood decades of traffic, an average of 138,000 vehicles a day. That wear and tear has taken a toll. One report called the Tappan Zee “one of the most deceprit and dangerous bridges in the U.S.” Something had to be done and so in 2013, construction began on a replacement bridge which is expected to open in 2018.\n\nThose who are familiar with the original bridge, however, have memories. None expressed more eloquently than those in this poem by Susan Moorhead.\n\nFrom the window of the Tarrytown library at night, you\n\ncan see the green lights of the bridge, bright over dark water.\n\nWhen I was little, I thought they were strands of emeralds looped\n\nacross the water, as my father drove us home from visiting\n\nrelatives on the Jersey side. The new Tappan Zee will shine\n\nwith LED lights states the local news alongside comments\n\nincluding “the old bridge sucks” from some opinionated\n\nMatthew. It’s something, watching it rise from the Hudson,\n\nthis new bridge. My parents grew up in New Jersey. We\n\nmoved from NJ to NY then NJ to NY, and then they returned\n\nto NJ, and I grew up and went NY CT NY, surprising myself\n\nby ending up a local girl back by the Westchester town I grew\n\nup in. It’s officially the Governor Malcolm Wilson Tappan\n\nZee Bridge. Zee means sea. Years ago, just after dawn,\n\nI dozed off in the line at a toll booth and tapped some guy’s\n\nbumper. I still remember the look of fury on his face until\n\nhe saw I was just some kid, still in my wedding guest\n\nfanciest and he settled for shaking a finger at me as I\n\nmouthed sorry through the window. It’s a cantilever\n\nbridge: a beam anchored on one end only is a cantilever.\n\nI can drive from the Tarrytown, New York side to\n\nRidgewood, New Jersey with closed eyes if I had to,\n\nall 16,013 feet of bridge. I drove home after we settled\n\nmy mother in the hospital, raced back at three a.m. after\n\nthe phone call about her emergency surgery. It’s the largest\n\nbridge in New York State. Feels that when you drive over it\n\nbegging God not to take her tonight. When you drive over it\n\npracticing your eulogy for your father who surprises everyone\n\nby going first. They are buried in a graveyard beyond the coiling\n\nhighways in New Jersey. I see them in mind every day in the kitchen\n\noverlooking the long yard where he putters, she is calling across\n\nthe bridge, over the long stretch of shimmering water for someone\n\nto put on the water for tea.\n\nTop photo from Bigstock Images."
