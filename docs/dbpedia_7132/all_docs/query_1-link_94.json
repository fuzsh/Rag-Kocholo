These are common to all people who rent the cabins.\n\nArmstrong Campground: Mount Carleton’s largest campground with 88 sites for trailers and tents. This campground boasts spectacular views of Nictau Lake and Mount Sagamook as well as a pristine beach, washrooms, showers, dry toilets, a kitchen shelter and a dumping station for trailers.\n\nWilliams and Franklin Campgrounds: 17 large, secluded tenting sites on both sides of Nictau Lake. Dry toilets, garbage bins and recycling bins are included.\n\nGroup Camping: This site can accommodate up to 75 campers and includes a kitchen shelter, garbage and recycling bins and water (hand pump).\n\nHeadwaters Campground: For a more extreme camping experience, hike partway up Mount Carleton Trail.

Pass by beautiful, large waterfalls and a boardwalk over beaver dams on Bald Mountain Brook.\n\nLength :4.7 km/2.914 mi. (Linear)\n\nEstimated Time :1.5 h\n\nDifficulty :\n\n2 - Caribou Brook\n\nThis moderately flat trail travels across a hardwood ridge. The trail drops down towards Caribou Brook (named after the caribou which roamed the mountain until the early 1900s) where you should see plenty of signs of moose before coming out near Bathurst Lake.\n\nLength :5.7 km/3.534 mi. (Linear)\n\nEstimated Time :1.75 h\n\nDifficulty :\n\n3 - Mount Bailey\n\nTravel through mixed forests on your way to the rocky cliffs with views of Mount Sagamook and Mount Carleton.

(Mixed)\n\nEstimated Time :3.0 h\n\nDifficulty :\n\n4 - Mount Carleton\n\nThe west trail follows a lush, mossy stream up the mountain. Cross a long, rocky ridge to the peak where you will find a tower that marks the highest point in the Maritime provinces. The tower was once used to look for forest fires. The east trail descends along an old access road that passes a fireman's cabin.\n\nLength :9.6 km/5.952 mi. (Loop)\n\nEstimated Time :4.0 h\n\nDifficulty :\n\n5 - Mount Sagamook\n\nFollow the old logging route established by Admiral Spruance, an American sportsman who frequented the park. Rocky outcrops provide iconic views of Nictau Lake and are widely considered the best views of the park. Don’t forget to check out the lookout and ridge on the eastern section for views of Bathurst Lake and surrounding forest.\n\nLength :6.6 km/4.092 mi. (Loop)\n\nEstimated Time :4.0 h\n\nDifficulty :\n\n6 - Mount Head\n\nMount Head is halfway across the plateau between Mount Sagamook and Mount Carleton.

(Loop)\n\nEstimated Time :0.5 h\n\nDifficulty :\n\n8 - Portage\n\nThis restored ancient portage trail between the Nictau and Bathurst lakes connected the Saint John River and Nepisiguit River watersheds. It had been used by the Maliseet and Mi’kmaq for centuries and by early explorers and missionaries in the 1700s and early 1900s. The forest trail follows the flattest route between the two lakes, making it one of the easiest in the park.\n\nLength :4.2 km/2.604 mi.

The path follows the brook up the steep-sided valley, passing a number of waterfalls (one of which is 10 metres (32 feet) high). The stream, which headwaters are on the Mount Carleton Plateau, disappears underground in places, earning it the name ‘Dry Brook.'\n\nLength :11.8 km/7.316 mi. (Linear)\n\nEstimated Time :8.0 h\n\nDifficulty :\n\n11 - Big Brook\n\nEmbark on a long journey with this trail, beginning at Bathurst Lake and following the shore.
