        "text": "The project is the replacement of the nearly 60-year-old Tappan Zee Bridge, called the \"Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge,\" carrying I-87/287 over the Hudson River between Westchester and Rockland Counties, approximately 20 miles north of New York City.\n\nThe Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge is being built alongside the existing bridge, and bi-directional traffic will be rerouted to the new westbound bridge span while the new eastbound span is being completed. The demolition of the existing bridge and construction of the new eastbound span will happen concurrently at the end of the project.\n\nThe new tolled bridge is a dual-span twin bridge with eight lanes, four emergency lanes, a dedicated commuter bus lane, and a bicycle/pedestrian path. The bridge is being designed to accommodate future transit plans - bus rapid transit, light rail, or commuter rail."
