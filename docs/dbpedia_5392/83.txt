Need to know when visiting Pula?

Pula, a historic gem nestled along Croatia‚Äôs Adriatic coast, welcomes travelers from around the globe. If you‚Äôre planning to set foot in this ancient city, here‚Äôs a handy guide with essential tips to enhance your visit:

General Information

Currency: The official currency used in Pula is the Euro (‚Ç¨). On January 1, 2023, the Republic of Croatia transitioned from the kuna to the euro, becoming the 20th member of the euro area.

Language: The primary language spoken in Pula is Croatian. However, the city, also known as Pola, is officially bilingual. Both Croatian and Italian are recognized languages, making ‚ÄúPula‚Äù and ‚ÄúPola‚Äù its official names respectively.

Time Zone: Pula follows Central European Time (CET) and observes Daylight Saving Time.

Safety: Pula is generally safe for tourists. However, like any other city, it‚Äôs wise to remain cautious, especially in crowded areas or late at night.

Payment Methods: Visa, Mastercard, and Diners are the most frequently accepted credit cards.

Schengen area: Travelers from Schengen countries don‚Äôt need to show ID when entering Croatia. However, it‚Äôs advised to carry a passport or identity card for identification purposes.

Shopping hours: In compliance with the new Trade Act, shops in Croatia will generally remain closed on Sundays. But fret not! Traders have the flexibility to open their doors on 16 specific Sundays throughout the year. We recommend checking with local shops or your hotel concierge to find out the exact Sundays shops will be open during your stay.

Parking ‚ÄúPermit Holders Only‚Äù: If you‚Äôre parking in Pula, keep an eye out for the red sign that states ‚ÄúPermit Holders Only‚Äù üö´. This important indicator means that the parking space is reserved exclusively for local residents who have a special permit. If you‚Äôre not a permit holder and you park in one of these spots, you could be facing a fine. So, to avoid any unnecessary headaches or costs, make sure to park your car in a designated area that‚Äôs open to the public. Always double-check the parking signs to ensure you‚Äôre in the clear!

Practical Tips

Drinking Water: The tap water in Pula is safe to drink. It‚Äôs held to high-quality standards, so you can refill your bottles without concern.

Electricity: Pula uses the standard European electrical voltage of 220V. Outlets are of the type F, which is the two round pin plug/socket combo, common in Europe. If you‚Äôre traveling from outside Europe, you might need an adapter.

Connectivity: Wi-Fi is widely available in most hotels, restaurants, and popular tourist areas. Mobile connectivity is reliable, with several local and international networks providing coverage.

Tipping: Tipping is appreciated but not mandatory in Croatia. In restaurants, it‚Äôs common to leave up to 10% of the bill if you‚Äôre satisfied with the service. For taxi drivers, rounding up to the nearest whole amount is a kind gesture.

Pharmacies: ‚ÄúIstarske Ljekarne Pula Centar‚Äù is a 24/7 pharmacy, ensuring uninterrupted access to medications and health products.

Smoking Rules: Bars in Pula permit smoking. However, smoking is prohibited inside restaurants and shopping centers.

VAT Refund: Prices in Croatia incorporate a 25% Value Added Tax (VAT). Non-EU residents traveling to non-EU destinations can claim this back. Many major shops in Pula offer tax-free shopping. Look for the Tax-Free logo or inquire with sales assistants.
