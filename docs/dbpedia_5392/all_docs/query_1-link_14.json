        "text": "Euro 2024 kicks off tonight, June 14, with hosts Germany taking on Scotland. Croatia play their opening game on Saturday against Spain. With this in mind, everyone will be looking for somewhere to watch this exciting match. In Split, Pula and Zagreb, every Croatia game will be screened live in official fan zones, while other spots are being prepared to handle the inevitable overflow of fans eager to enjoy in communal celebration. Here’s a quick overview of where to experience football fever in Croatia.\n\nZagreb\n\nFor all three of Croatia’s group games, the main square will play host to the city’s biggest watch party, extending for as long as Croatia’s run through the tournament continues. Pictures and videos of the electric atmosphere from Trg Bana Jelačića have been shown the world over as Croats witnessed and celebrated back-to-back runs in the World Cups of 2018 and 2022, and locals hope that there will be just as much to celebrate this time around. There will also be 16 organised concerts to provide entertainment throughout the tournament, making use of the stage where the football team would greet the crowds if Croatia lift the trophy. Admission is free, but to grab a good spot, get here early.\n\nElsewhere in the capital, another great spot is on Tkalčićeva where the Mali Medo pub makes excellent use of its terrace space. Projected onto a wall surrounded by a tournament results tracker, swathes of fans both local and international gather to drink craft beer and follow the drama. Doubly true for this location, for anyone who hopes to grab a table, is to get there well in advance of kick-off as many will be clamouring for a spot.\n\nPula & Split\n\nPula’s historic Forum will host most of the fan buzz. As with Zagreb’s main square, Pula’s historic Roman square will host watch parties for all three of Croatia’s guaranteed games, with hopes for more to be shown depending on the team's progress. In Split, the watching festivities will take place on the western bank at Kolur Zvončac.\n\nAlternatives\n\nThe fan zones are an incredible hub of atmosphere, but if that seems a little too exhausting – or perhaps you’d like to watch more than just Croatia’s games with other football fans – there are no shortages of options. With Croatia’s long-standing terrace café culture, the infrastructure for watching games with groups of friends right in the middle of the city is well established. A walk down any central street in virtually every city of the country will yield a range of options for sitting down to have a coffee or a beer and catch the best of the tournament’s action."
