        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to the Skydeck, you might be wondering what time zone Chicago, Illinois is in. Like nearby Milwaukee, and a portion of the Midwest, Chicago is in the Central Time Zone. Find out more about how many time zones there are in the U.S., and what to expect in the Chicago time zone with the Skydeck!\n\nWhat Time Zone Is Chicago?\n\nIf you’re planning a trip to the Skydeck, you might be wondering what time is it in Chicago, Illinois compared to where you live. First, you’ll need to determine the Illinois time zone. Like nearby Milwaukee and a portion of the Midwest, the Illinois time zone is the Central Time Zone. Find out more about how many time zones there are in the U.S., and what to expect in the Chicago time zone during your Windy City visit!\n\nIs Chicago GMT Time?\n\nChicago is not GMT time. It’s actually located in the U.S. Central Time Zone. Greenwich Mean Time (or GMT) is a European time zone that uses the zero-degree line of longitude as its reference. The name comes from the fact that this line runs through the London suburb of Greenwich.\n\nNot only is Illinois in the Central Time Zone, but Chicago is the largest city in the entire time zone! During Daylight Standard Time (November through April) the Chicago time zone is six hours behind Greenwich Mean Time. During Daylight Savings Time (April through November) Chicago is seven hours behind Greenwich Mean Time.\n\nWondering what time is it in Chicago, Illinois if you live in a place that’s on GMT? To convert the time in Chicago to GMT, simply add six hours during Central Standard Time or five hours if daylight savings time is in effect.\n\nHow Many Time Zones Are There in the U.S.?\n\nThe continental U.S. has four time zones, but when you add Alaska and Hawaii it jumps to six time zones. The location of the time zone borders are based on low population density, not state lines, so some states are in two time zones. Here’s a breakdown of the U.S. time zones and the states in them:\n\nEastern Time Zone\n\nMaine\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nVermont\n\nConnecticut\n\nRhode Island\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNew York\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMaryland\n\nDelaware\n\nOhio\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMost of Michigan\n\nEastern Indiana\n\nEastern Kentucky\n\nEastern Tennessee\n\nVirginia\n\nWashington D.C.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGeorgia\n\nMost of Florida\n\nCentral Time Zone\n\nSmall portion of Michigan\n\nTwo portions of Indiana\n\nWestern Kentucky\n\nWestern Tennessee\n\nSliver of Florida\n\nAlabama\n\nMississippi\n\nLouisiana\n\nArkansas\n\nIllinois\n\nMissouri\n\nIowa\n\nWisconsin\n\nMinnesota\n\nMost of Kansas\n\nOklahoma\n\nMost of Texas\n\nEastern North Dakota\n\nEastern South Dakota\n\nEastern Nebraska\n\nMountain Time Zone\n\nWestern North Dakota\n\nWestern South Dakota\n\nWestern Nebraska\n\nSliver of Kansas\n\nSliver of Texas\n\nNew Mexico\n\nColorado\n\nWyoming\n\nMontana\n\nSouthern Idaho\n\nUtah\n\nArizona\n\nSliver of Oregon\n\nPacific Time Zone\n\nWashington\n\nMost of Oregon\n\nNorthern Idaho\n\nNevada\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe Alaskan Time Zone and Hawaiian Time Zone contain the states that share their names.\n\nMake Time for a Visit to the Skydeck!"
