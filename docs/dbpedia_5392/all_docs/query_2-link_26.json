It is defined by the offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the world’s time standard. UTC is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is not adjusted for daylight saving time. Each time zone is typically one hour apart, but there are exceptions due to political and geographical boundaries.\n\nTime zones are necessary because the Earth is divided into 24 longitudinal lines, each 15 degrees apart, corresponding to one hour of time difference. As the Earth rotates on its axis, different parts of the world experience daylight and darkness at different times. Time zones help coordinate timekeeping across the globe, ensuring that activities such as travel, commerce, and communication occur smoothly.\n\nUTC serves as a reference point for timekeeping and is based on highly accurate atomic clocks. It is used in various fields, including astronomy, telecommunications, and computer networks, to synchronize time measurements worldwide. UTC is often referred to as “Zulu time” in aviation and military contexts, and it provides a standard for coordinating activities across different time zones. Local Time Pula, Croatia."
