In addition, the beach is suitable for those who want to dive from a height - in its western part there are small, but very beautiful cliffs.\n\nNightlife\n\nFor resort entertainment, Pula can offer not only walks to historical sites or relax on warm beaches.

You will be able to see the city from a height if you climb onto a tower in the Kastel fortress. It was founded in the 14th century, and now it houses the Maritime History Museum. Under the fortress, there is a cave, about the mystical inhabitants of which there are many amusing legends among the locals. The idea of ​​Roman architecture will help to make up the Gate of Hercules and the Arch of the Sergii. These are the oldest buildings in the city, built in 3-1 centuries BC. If you want to escape from antiquity, you should go to the Marine Park. It was founded in the 19th century and to this day has preserved almost all the features of the park architecture of that time. There are many exotic flowers and trees growing, in the shade of which you can relax from the beach heat. Man-made masterpieces of recognized masters of painting are kept in the collection of the Franciscan monastery of the 13th century, which in itself is a tourist attraction.\n\n2. Walk for pleasure on the long promenade along beaches. One of the most favorite places for walking among Pula guests is the Lungomare.
