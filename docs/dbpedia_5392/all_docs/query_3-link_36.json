        "text": "Western European Time (WET)\n\nThe Western European Time zone applies, as the name suggests, in some countries and regions of Western Europe. These are the Faroe Islands, the Spanish Canary Islands and the Portuguese mainland including Madeira, but excluding the Azores.\n\nTime zones are always indicated in their time distance to the coordinated world time. The English expression \"Universal Time Coordinated\" is abbreviated as UTC. This is the time that is valid on the zero degree of longitude. And the countries of Western Europe lie exactly in this time zone. In summer, all countries change to the Western European Summer Time (WEST). Then UTC+1 applies there uniformly."
