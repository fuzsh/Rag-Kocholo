        "text": "Daylight saving time in the Central European time zone\n\nCentral European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+02:00), sometimes referred to as Central European Daylight Time (CEDT),[1] is the standard clock time observed during the period of summer daylight-saving in those European countries which observe Central European Time (CET; UTC+01:00) during the other part of the year. It corresponds to UTC+02:00, which makes it the same as Eastern European Time, Central Africa Time, South African Standard Time, Egypt Standard Time and Kaliningrad Time in Russia.[2]\n\nNames\n\n[edit]\n\nOther names which have been applied to Central European Summer Time are Middle European Summer Time (MEST),[3] Central European Daylight Saving Time (CEDT),[4] and Bravo Time (after the second letter of the NATO phonetic alphabet).[5]\n\nPeriod of observation\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 1996, European Summer Time has been observed between 01:00 UTC (02:00 CET and 03:00 CEST) on the last Sunday of March, and 01:00 UTC on the last Sunday of October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union.[6]\n\nThere were proposals to abandon summer time in Europe from 2021, possibly by moving winter time up by an hour and keeping that time through the year.[7]\n\nUsage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following countries and territories regularly use Central European Summer Time:[8]\n\nAlbania, since 1974\n\nAndorra, since 1985\n\nAustria, since 1980\n\nBelgium, since 1980\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia\n\nCroatia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia\n\nCzech Republic, since 1979 when part of Czechoslovakia\n\nDenmark (metropolitan), since 1980\n\nFrance (metropolitan), since 1976\n\nGermany, since 1980\n\nGibraltar, since 1982\n\nHungary, since 1980\n\nItaly, since 1968\n\nKosovo, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia\n\nLiechtenstein, since 1981\n\nLuxembourg, since 1981\n\nMalta, since 1974\n\nMonaco, since 1976\n\nMontenegro, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia\n\nNetherlands, since 1977\n\nNorth Macedonia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia\n\nNorway, since 1980\n\nPoland, since 1977\n\nSan Marino, since 1966\n\nSerbia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia\n\nSlovakia, since 1979 when part of Czechoslovakia\n\nSlovenia, since 1983 when part of Yugoslavia\n\nSpain, since 1974 (except Canary Islands, which instead apply Western European Summer Time)\n\nSweden, since 1980\n\nSwitzerland, since 1981\n\nVatican City, since 1966\n\nThe following countries have also used Central European Summer Time in the past:\n\nLibya, 1951–1959, 1982–1989, 1996–1997, 2012–2013\n\nLithuania, 1998–1999\n\nPortugal, 1993–1995\n\nTunisia, 2005–2008\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nEuropean Summer Time\n\nTime zone"
