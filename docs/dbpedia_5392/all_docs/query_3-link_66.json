The time offset from UTC can be written as +01:00. The same standard time, UTC+01:00, is also known as Middle European Time (MET, German: MEZ) and under other names like Berlin Time, Romance Standard Time (RST), Paris Time or Rome Time.\n\nContents\n\nUsage in Europe\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nOther countries\n\nDiscrepancies between official CET and geographical CET\n\nAreas located within UTC1 longitudes using other time zones\n\nAreas using UTC2\n\nAreas located outside UTC1 longitudes using UTC1 time\n\nAreas between 2230 W and 730 W physical UTC1\n\nAreas between 730 W and 730 E physical UTC\n\nAreas between 2230 E and 3730 E physical UTC2\n\nReferences\n\nThe 15th meridian east is the central axis for UTC+01:00 in the world system of time zones.\n\nAs of 2011, all member states of the European Union observe summer time; those that use CET during the winter use Central European Summer Time (CEST) (or: UTC+02:00, daylight saving time) in summer (from last Sunday of March to last Sunday of October).\n\nA number of African countries use UTC+01:00 all year long, where it is called West Africa Time (WAT), although Algeria and Tunisia also use the term Central European Time.\n\nUsage in Europe\n\n1890\n\nThe areas of current Croatia start using CET.\n\nThe areas of current Hungary start using CET.\n\n1891\n\nThe areas of current Czech Republic start using CET.\n\n1 April 1893\n\nThe German Empire unified its time zones to use CET (MEZ).\n\nItaly, Malta use CET.\n\nThe areas of current Austria start using CET.\n\n1894\n\nSwitzerland switches from UTC+00:30 to CET\n\nLiechtenstein introduces CET.\n\nDenmark adopts CET.\n\n1895\n\nNorway adopts CET.\n\n1900\n\nSweden adopts CET.\n\n1904\n\nLuxemborg introduces CET, but leaves 1918.\n\n1914\n\nAlbania.\n\n1914–1918\n\nDuring World War I CET was implemented in all German-occupied territories.\n\n1920\n\nLithuania adopts CET, but rescinds in 1940.\n\n1922\n\nPoland adopts CET.\n\n1940\n\nUnder German occupation:\n\nThe Netherlands was switched from UTC+00:20 to CET.\n\nBelgium was switched from UTC+00:00.\n\nLuxembourg was switched from UTC+00:00.\n\nFrance, which had adopted Paris time on 14 March 1891 and Greenwich Mean Time on 9 March 1911, was switched to CET.\n\nAfter World War II Monaco, Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar implemented CET.\n\nPortugal used CET in the years 1966–1976 and 1992–1996.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe time around the world is based on Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) which is roughly synonymous with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). From late March to late October, clocks in the United Kingdom are put forward by one hour for British Summer Time (BST). Since 1997, most of the European Union aligned with the British standards for BST. Central European Time is thus always one hour ahead of British time.\n\nIn 1968 there was a three-year experiment called British Standard Time, when the UK and Ireland experimentally employed British Summer Time (GMT+1) all year round; clocks were put forward in March 1968 and not put back until October 1971.\n\nCentral European Time is sometimes referred to as continental time in the UK.\n\nOther countries\n\nSeveral African countries use UTC+01:00 all year long, where it called West Africa Time (WAT), although Algeria and Tunisia also use the term Central European Time, despite being located in North Africa.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2008, Tunisia observed daylight saving time. Libya also used CET during the years 1951–1959, 1982–1989, 1996–1997 and 2012–2013.\n\nFor other countries see UTC+01:00 and West Africa Time.\n\nDiscrepancies between official CET and geographical CET\n\nLegal, political and economic, as well as physical or geographical criteria are used in the drawing of time zones so official time zones rarely adhere to meridian lines. The CET time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of exactly the area between meridians 7°30′ E and 22°30′ E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a \"physical\" UTC+1 time, actually use another time zone (UTC+2 in particular – there are no \"physical\" UTC+1 areas that employ UTC). Conversely, there are European areas that have gone for UTC+1, even though their \"physical\" time zone is UTC (typically), UTC−1 (westernmost Spain), or UTC+2 (e.g. the very easternmost parts of Norway, Sweden, Poland and Serbia). On the other hand, the people in Spain still have all work and meal hours one hour later than France and Germany even if they have the same time zone. Following is a list of such \"incongruences\":\n\nHistorically Gibraltar maintained UTC+1 all year until the opening of the land frontier with Spain in 1982 when it followed its neighbour and introduced CEST.\n\nAreas located within UTC+1 longitudes using other time zones\n\nThese areas are located between 7°30′ E and 22°30′ E (\"physical\" UTC+1)\n\nAreas using UTC+2\n\nThe westernmost parts of the Bulgarian provinces of Vidin and Kyustendil\n\nThe westernmost part of Romania, including most of the area of the counties of Caraș-Severin, Timiș (capital Timișoara), Arad, and Bihor, as well as the westernmost tips of the counties of Mehedinți and Satu Mare\n\nThe westernmost tip of Ukraine, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia, at the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), essentially comprising the city of Uzhhorod and its environs. (Although CET is used as local, non-official time in Transcarpathia).\n\nWestern Lithuania, including the cities of Klaipėda, Tauragė, and Telšiai\n\nWestern Latvia, including the cities of Liepāja and Ventspils\n\nThe westernmost parts of the Estonian islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, including the capital of the Saare County, Kuressaare\n\nThe southwestern coast of Finland, including the city of Turku; also the Åland islands (of Finnish jurisdiction) – the Åland islands are the westernmost locale applying EET in the whole of Europe\n\nThe northwesternmost part of Finland, including Kilpisjärvi and Kaaresuvanto.\n\nThe Russian exclave of Kaliningrad Oblast, excluding however its easternmost slice (the city of Nesterov is east of 22°30′ E, but that of Krasnoznamensk is not)\n\nAreas located outside UTC+1 longitudes using UTC+1 time\n\nThese areas are located west of 7°30′ E or east of 22°30′ E (outside \"physical\" UTC+1)\n\nAreas between 22°30′ W and 7°30′ W (\"physical\" UTC−1)\n\nThe westernmost part of mainland Spain (Galicia, e.g. the city of A Coruña); Cape Finisterre and nearby points in Galicia, at 9°18′ W, are the westernmost places where CET is applied.\n\nThe Norwegian island of Jan Mayen lies entirely within this area and extends nearly as far west as Cape Finisterre, with its western tip at 9°5′ W and its eastern tip at 7°56′ W.\n\nAreas between 7°30′ W and 7°30′ E (\"physical\" UTC)\n\nAndorra\n\nBelgium\n\nFrance, except for the absolutely easternmost part, in Alsace, incl. Strasbourg and parts of Alpes-Maritimes, and except for Corsica\n\nThe very westernmost part of Germany, incl. the cities of Saarbrücken, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Aachen, and Trier\n\nThe absolutely westernmost part of Italy, incl. the cities of Aosta in Aosta Valley and Cuneo in Piedmont\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMonaco\n\nNetherlands\n\nThe westernmost part of Norway, incl. the cities of Bergen and Stavanger\n\nMainland Spain, except for the westernmost part (see above), Canary Islands, and the African cities of Ceuta and Melilla. However, pending legislation is underway to return Spain to Greenwich Mean Time.\n\nGibraltar\n\nThe part of Switzerland west of Bern (inclusive), also incl. cities such as Geneva, Lausanne, and Fribourg\n\nAreas between 22°30′ E and 37°30' E (\"physical\" UTC+2)\n\nThe easternmost part of the Republic of Macedonia, including the city of Strumica\n\nThe easternmost part of Serbia, in the Pirot District, including the city of Pirot, and small easternmost parts of Bor District.\n\nThe easternmost tips of Hungary and Slovakia, bordering to the north and south respectively the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), a bit to the east of Vásárosnamény, Hungary – Uzhhorod, Ukraine (both at 22°18′ E) line\n\nThe easternmost part of Poland, including the cities of Lublin and Białystok\n\nThe northeast of Sweden, in the Norrbotten province, including the cities of Kalix and Haparanda\n\nThe northeast of Norway, lying north of Finland, roughly coinciding with the county of Finnmark; for instance Vadsø, the capital of Finnmark, has a longitude of 29°49′ E. Actually, the easternmost town in Norway, Vardø, lies at 30°51′ E, which is so far east, so as to be east even of the central meridian of EET (UTC+2), i.e. east of Istanbul and Alexandria. The sun reaches its highest point at 10:56 (when not DST).\n\nThe Norwegian–Russian border (incl. the border control at Storskog) is the only place where CET (UTC+1/+2) borders Moscow time (UTC+3), resulting in a two hours time change (or one hour in summer) for the passenger crossing that border.\n\nMore so, there exists a \"tri-zone\" point (where UTC+1, UTC+2, and UTC+3 meet) at the Norway–Finland–Russia tripoint near Muotkavaara. Mental experiment when looking at this map: Go to the westernmost point of the red area (the Jäniskoski-Niskakoski area); this belongs to Russian jurisdiction, hence the time there is UTC+3. Then, take a northeastern (NE) direction (that is an eastwards direction); you will soon be crossing into Finnish territory, thus moving to the UTC+2 time zone. Continuing in that direction, you will eventually reach the Finland–Norway border and enter Norway, thus passing into the UTC+1 time zone. So, moving in a (north)easterly direction, you will be moving from UTC+3 to UTC+2 to UTC+1.\n\nReferences\n\nCentral European Time Wikipedia\n\n(Text) CC BY-SA\n\nSimilar Topics"
