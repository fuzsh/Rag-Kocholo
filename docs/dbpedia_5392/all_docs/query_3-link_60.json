        "text": "Time zone abbreviations can be confusing, especially if you aren’t already familiar with the various time zones they represent. If you’re wondering about the abbreviation for Eastern Standard Time (EST) or need to know what UTC means, this handy guide will help.\n\nUTC stands for Coordinated Universal Time. This is the world’s standard for regulating clocks and referring to other time zones. Also known as Greenwich Mean Time or GMT, it represents 0° in longitude or the Prime Meridian. The following cities are on or near the Prime Meridian and use UTC or GMT for their time zones:\n\nLondon, United Kingdom\n\nAccra, Ghana\n\nValencia, Spain\n\nBordeaux, France\n\nEvery other time zone represents an adjustment from UTC or GMT in terms of hours before or after it using minus or plus symbols, respectively.\n\nCentral European Time, abbreviated as CET, is used in a number of countries in Europe. It is UTC +01:00. In countries that observe daylight savings, the time zone changes to CEST for Central European Summer Time or CEDT for Central European Daylight Time. A few of the places using CET include the following:\n\nAlbania\n\nAlgeria\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance\n\nGermany"
