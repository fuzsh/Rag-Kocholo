        "text": "Universal Time (UT1)\n\nTime can be measured in a number of ways. For instance, we can measure the passage of time via the orbital motion of Earth and other planets in the solar system (Dynamical Time). Or we can measure time based on the rotation of Earth on its axis with respect to the stars (Universal Time or UT1). Finally, we can measure time through the oscillations of atoms (International Atomic Time).\n\nSolar time is time based on Earthâs rotation relative to the Sun. Apparent solar time is that measured by direct observation of the Sun or by a sundial. Mean solar time, kept by most clocks and watches, is the solar time that would be measured by observation if the Sun traveled at a uniform apparent speed throughout the year rather than, as it actually does, at a slightly varying apparent speed that depends on the seasons.\n\nUniversal Time (UT1) is the modern time standard for mean solar time and is based on Earth's rotation on its axis. The rotation of the Earth and UT1 are monitored by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS)\n\nThe rotation of the Earth is gradually slowing due to the tidal acceleration of the the Moon. The length of the second was originally determined from observations of the Moon between 1750 and 1890. However, the modern mean solar day is now slightly longer due to this gradual slowdown.\n\nWhile Universal Time (UT1) was originally determined by measuring Earth's rotation with respect to the Sun, it is now determined more accurately by measurements of distant quasars using long baseline interferometry.\n\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC)\n\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC) is based on atomic time ( International Atomic Time). It is synchronized and adjusted to stay within 0.9 seconds of Universal Time (UT1). Occasionally, a \"leap second\" is added to UTC in order keep it in sync with UT1 (which varies due to Earth's rotation). UTC is the time used by GPSs and is the standard reference for Time Zones around the world. For instance, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is set equal to UTC, while other time zones are offsets from UTC by up to ± 14 hours.\n\nTime Zones\n\nA time zone is a designated area of the globe that observes a uniform standard time for legal, commercial and social purposes. It is typically chosen to approximate mean solar time for a region. Time zones tend to follow the boundaries of countries and their subdivisions instead of strictly following longitude because of commercial convenience. (see Time Zone Abbreviations â Worldwide List)\n\nMost of the time zones on land are offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by a whole number of hours. For example, in North America the following time zones are observed along with their offsets from UTC.\n\nAtlantic Standard Time (AST) = UTC - 4 hours Eastern Standard Time (EST) = UTC - 5 hours Central Standard Time (CST) = UTC - 6 hours Mountain Standard Time (MST) = UTC - 7 hours Pacific Standard Time (PST) = UTC - 8 hours Alaska Standard Time (AKST) = UTC - 9 hours Hawaii Standard Time (HST ) = UTC - 10 hours\n\nIf Daylight Saving Time is in effect in the time zone, you must ADD one hour to the standard time. So the conversion from standard time to daylight time is as follows:\n\nAtlantic Daylight Time (ADT) = UTC - 3 hours Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) = UTC - 4 hours Central Daylight Time (CDT) = UTC - 5 hours Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) = UTC - 6 hours Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) = UTC - 7 hours Alaska Daylight Time (AKDT) = UTC - 8 hours (Hawaii does not use Daylight Saving Time)\n\nEuropean Time Zones and UTC\n\nFor countries in Europe, the conversion from UTC to local time is as follows.\n\nGreenwich Mean Time (GMT) = UTC + 0 hour Central European Time (CET) = UTC + 1 hours Eastern European Time (EET) = UTC + 2 hours Moscow Standard Time (MSK) = UTC + 3 hours Gulf Standard Time (GST) = UTC + 4 hours\n\nIn Europe Daylight Saving Time is called Summer Time. If Summer Time is in effect, you must ADD one hour to the standard time. So the conversion from UTC to local summer time is as follows:\n\nBritish Summer Time (BST) = UTC + 1 hours Central European Summer Time (CEST) = UTC + 2 hours Eastern European Summer Time (EEST) = UTC + 3 hours\n\nWorld Time Zones and UTC\n\nMany time zones have different names in different countries. The most important characteristic of a time zone is its offset from UTC. Below is a list of time zones around the world. It includes official time zone abbreviations and offsets from UTC.\n\nTime Zones and Abbreviations (Western Hemisphere)\n\nCVT = Cape Verde Time (= UTC - 1 hour)\n\nGST = South Georgia Time (= UTC - 2 hours)\n\nART = Argentina Time (= UTC - 3 hours)\n\nAST = Atlantic Standard Time (= UTC - 4 hours)\n\nEST = Eastern Standard Time (= UTC - 5 hours)\n\nCST = Central Standard Time (= UTC - 6 hours)\n\nMST = Mountain Standard Time (= UTC - 7 hours)\n\nPST = Pacific Standard Time (= UTC - 8 hours)\n\nAKST = Alaskan Standard Time (= UTC - 9 hours)\n\nHST = Hawaiian Standard Time (= UTC - 10 hours)\n\nSST = Samoa Standard Time (= UTC - 11 hours)\n\nIDLW = International Day Line West (= UTC - 12 hours)\n\nTime Zones and Abbreviations (Eastern Hemisphere)\n\nGMT = Greenwich Mean Time (= UTC + 0 hour)\n\nCET = Central European Time (= UTC + 1 hour)\n\nEET = Eastern European Time (= UTC + 2 hours)\n\nMSK = Moscow Time (= UTC + 3 hours)\n\nGST = Gulf Standard Time (= UTC + 4 hours)\n\nPKT = Pakistan Standard Time (= UTC + 5 hours)\n\nIST = Indian Standard Time (= UTC + 5.5 hours)\n\nBST = Bangladesh Standard Time (= UTC + 6 hours)\n\nICT = Indochina Time (= UTC + 7 hours)\n\nAWST = Australian Western Standard Time (= UTC + 8 hours)\n\nJST = Japan Standard Time (= UTC + 9 hours)\n\nACT = Australian Central Time (= UTC + 9.5 hours)\n\nAEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time (= UTC + 10 hours)\n\nNCT = New Caledonia Time (= UTC + 11 hours)\n\nNZST = New Zealand Standard Time (= UTC + 12 hours)\n\nSee Time Zones and Abbreviations (Wikipedia) for a more complete list.\n\nWorld Time Zone Map\n\nThe map below shows time zones around the World.\n\nWorld Time Zones (click to see larger image)\n\nTime zones for countries around the world can be determined using the map above.
