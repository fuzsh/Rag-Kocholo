        "text": "The perfect one week Istria itinerary\n\nA full week is a really lovely amount of time to spend in Istria, as this gives you the opportunity to travel all throughout the region at a relaxed pace, and to stop wherever you want whenever you want.\n\nYou’ll be able to visit all of the major cities/towns and attractions, and will have time to get lost in the countryside, exploring rarely visited places that hide the true charm of the region. If you’ve got a week to spare, here’s what we’d recommend:\n\nDays 1 & 2 - Umag and surroundings\n\nStart your Istrian adventure with a visit to Umag - Croatia’s westernmost city. History lovers will especially enjoy Umag for its well-preserved town center, which is filled with noblemen’s houses from antiquity and medieval times.\n\nBe sure to check out the impressive city walls and the City Museum, which has a nice collection of Roman artifacts.\n\nAbout 9 kilometers out from Umag, in the small town of Savudrija, you’ll find a secluded lighthouse from the 1800’s which is part of an interesting old legend about a count and his forbidden love for a local woman.\n\nThe lighthouse is open to visitors, so you can climb the 36 meters up to the top and enjoy fantastic panoramic views. And if you’re interested in finding out what it’s like to actually live in a lighthouse, you can even book a night’s stay!\n\nIf visiting in summer or any time when it’s warm enough to swim or enjoy the sea, hop in the car and head out to the surrounding beaches. The Stella Maris Lagoon is especially good for families with children due to its many beach facilities, while Kanegra’s pebble beach is lovely, and you’ll be surrounded by trees which provide a nice escape from the summer sun.\n\nThere’s also a huge network of bicycle paths all around Umag and throughout the surrounding area, so rent a bike and enjoy leisurely rides through some of the prettiest countryside in Istria.\n\nAnd if you happen to visit in mid July, the Croatia Open, a world-famous tennis tournament, will be going on, so you can catch a match and see some famous players.\n\nDay 3 - Rovinj, Poreč and Novigrad\n\nRovinj, Poreč, and Novigrad are small romantic towns that will delight you with their Mediterranean atmosphere. Narrow stone streets, a relaxed lifestyle, and local seafood specialties are just some of the reasons why guests fall in love with these picturesque towns.\n\nRovinj, once a fishing town and today a popular tourist destination, charms with its colourful houses, which, together with the church of St. Euphemia, make a perfect picture for a postcard. Take a leisurely stroll through the old town, climb the bell tower of the church of St. Euphemia, and soak up the magnificence of the view before you.\n\nDuring breaks from sightseeing, sit in a cafe by the sea or refresh yourself in one of the restaurants, taverns, or pizzerias scattered around Rovinj. Explore cycling paths of different lengths around Rovinj or visit the Valdaliso Diving Center in the Valdaliso camp, where you can attend diving courses in various languages.\n\nPoreč is one of the most visited towns in Istria. At the season's peak, the number of inhabitants rises to 100,000. Therefore, everyone looking for a lot of interesting content on their vacation will not be disappointed with Poreč.\n\nPartygoers will be delighted by the Rise Up Poreč Music Festival and Club MTV Europe Summerblast summer festival, which bring the world's biggest pop and electronic music stars. Throughout the summer, from June to September, Poreč Open Air - Festival of Life is held, a street festival consisting of street performances, circuses, open-air cinemas, and concerts by tribute bands of world-famous groups.\n\nBut in Poreč, it's not all about partying. The city also boasts a rich cultural heritage. Visit the Euphrasian Basilica, built in the 6th century, specific for its Byzantine characteristics. The value of the Euphrasian Basilica was also recognized by UNESCO in 1997 when it declared it a World Cultural Heritage.\n\nAlong with the basilica, walk through the city centre and see the fragments of the Temple of Neptune and the Great Temple; Marafor - the Roman forum and medieval walls that make the city dangerous.\n\nUnlike Poreč, Novigrad has managed to preserve its peaceful Mediterranean atmosphere, which makes it ideal for all those who want to rest on their summer trip. However, the fact that it is a quiet town does not mean that it lacks content, especially in summer.\n\nAt the end of June or beginning of July, Parkfest is held, a music festival in several Novigrad parks. For a taste of local life, visit Novigrad in mid-August, when the town's festival, the Feast of St. Pelagius, the city's patron saint, takes place for three days. Listen to outdoor concerts, participate in local games, and eat local fish specialties.\n\nInteresting and unusual manifestations are the Night of Street Magicians, that is, street artists who show their skills to passers-by on the Great Square, and the Lunasa Astro Party, which takes place on August 1, when the Celts once celebrated Lunasa - the first day of summer. That evening, the street lights are turned off, and photos of celestial bodies are projected onto the town bell tower; you can buy an astrological souvenir or observe the sky with a telescope.\n\nDay 4 - Pula\n\nThis 3,000-year-old city is the largest in Istria and is best known for its arena. The best-preserved example of ancient architecture, the Pula Arena, or amphitheatre is still used for big summer concerts by Croatian and international stars.\n\nIn addition to this imposing building, walking through the city centre, you will encounter other monuments from the Roman era, such as the Gates of Hercules, the Double Gate, the Temple of Augustus or the Arc de Triomphe of the Sergius, which give Pula a unique antique charm.\n\nChildren and adults will enjoy the Pula Aquarium, 3 kilometres from the centre, on the Austro-Hungarian fortress of Verudela in the bay of the same name. In addition to seeing more than 200 species of different marine animals (from species that inhabit the Adriatic to tropical ones) and learning something about them, be sure to visit the Sea Turtle Recovery Centre located within the Aquarium, whose employees take care of these extremely endangered animals. If you want to learn more about the sea and marine life, you can sign up for numerous workshops organized by the Centre.\n\nAfter hanging out with the sea animals, it's time to refresh yourself on the Hawaiian beach not far from the centre itself. Due to the short shallows, the beach is ideal for families with small children. Nearby is Histria Beach, awarded with the Blue Flag. It is also suitable for families with small children due to the large shade and various contents.\n\nDay 5 - Brijuni National Park\n\nOnly 8 kilometres from Pula are located the magnificent Brijuni, a group of 14 islands and islets declared a national park in 1983. Board the boat in Fažana, and you will arrive in Brijuni in just 15 minutes. Brijuni National Park offers a handful of content for visitors of all profiles. There is a Safari Park in Brijuni where, along with exotic llamas, zebras, and ostriches, you can see an Indian elephant, which Indian stateswoman Indira Gandhi gave to Yugoslavian statesman Tito.\n\nBrijuni boast with cycling and walking paths that you can explore with expert guidance from October to May, while those who want to explore independently can walk or cycle along the Path of Positive Vibrations accompanied by the sounds of guitar and piano.\n\nArchaeology enthusiasts in good shape can sign up for a four-hour tour of historical sites. From the Byzantine castrum to the church of St. Germans from the 15th century will introduce you to the rich past of these islands.\n\nYou can swim in Verige Bay, where a Roman villa once stood, the remains of which can still be seen and visited.\n\nDays 6 & 7 - central Istria: Pazin, Motovun, and Hum\n\nTired of summer crowds and heat? Istria invites you to its interior, which amazes visitors with green hills with old forts, small towns (Hum – the smallest town in the world is located there), and charming vineyards. In addition, Central Istria is a real paradise for gourmets - Momjan muscat wine is produced there, and world-renowned truffles grow in the forests.\n\nWe recommend Pazin and its surroundings to sports fans and adventurers. Below the Pazin Castle from the 10th century is the Pazin Cave, which offers as many as three zip lines. You can also go down to the bottom of the pit, which you can explore with an expert guide. Bring long sleeves because the temperature in the pit is much lower than outside (about 15 degrees) and sports shoes. The Pazin Cave is open for visitors from May 1 to September 30.\n\nAnother cave you can visit is the Baredine cave, 6 kilometres from Poreč. If you want to see the cave inside, be prepared for more than 200 steps, for which you will need suitable footwear. The sightseeing itself takes about 40 minutes.\n\nBefore or after visiting the cave, visit the small museum where there is an exhibition of various archaeological finds and where you can learn interesting facts from the history of speleology.\n\nAfter a lot of sightseeing, it's time to take a break. That is why there is a restaurant and a picnic area around the pit itself, and the youngest (and those who feel like it) can visit the animal farm, where they can see donkeys, ponies, turkeys, geese, and ducks.\n\nTwo hundred meters from the pit itself, an interesting exhibition of about twenty old tractors and agricultural machines (Tractor Story). It was made to indicate the importance these machines had at the beginning of the 20th century for this area, whose inhabitants were exclusively engaged in agriculture. The exhibition will also be interesting for children.\n\nEven further inland are the towns of Motovun and Hum. Picturesque Motovun has become world-famous for the Motovun Film Festival, which takes place every summer and presents a selection of the world's best cinematography.\n\nThis small town with only five hundred inhabitants is located on a hill, so be prepared for a lot of hiking. If you come by car, you can park in the free parking lot below the city (you have to walk about 1 km uphill to the city) or in the paid parking lot at the entrance to the city.\n\nAlthough small, Motovun, apart from the film festival, offers a lot of content, especially for those inclined to adventure. A unique opportunity is offered to those who decide to go paragliding on the slopes of Motovun, while those more inclined to adventures on the ground can explore two hiking trails (Motovun - Zamask and Zamask - Motovun) and three cycling trails (Oćni put, Stara ferata, Veli Jože) around Motovun.\n\nA stay in Motovun will not be complete without climbing the city wall and witnessing one of the most beautiful sunsets in Croatia.\n\nSet aside a part of the day for a trip to Hum, the smallest town in the world with only 21 inhabitants, two small streets, and a few houses. A stay in Hum will take you back to the Croatian Middle Ages when this town was the centre of Glagolitic culture. Monuments written in Glagolitic speak about that part of history, which you can find in the Church of the Assumption of Mary and the city museum.\n\nIn addition to the title of the smallest city in the world, Hum is also proud of its alcoholic drink - Hum Biska, which is made from white mistletoe, grappa, and four types of herbs.\n\nNear Hum is the small town of Buzet, also known as the town of truffles. If you are a fan of this delicious delicacy or want to finally taste it, stop by Buzet in September when the Truffle Days are held. In addition to truffles, Buzet is also interesting for its medieval fortifications.\n\nFor lunch, we recommend to visit old-style taverns or agritourisms where you can enjoy rural atmosphere and exquisite cuisine!"
