        "text": "Did you know that Europe is actually divided into 4 separate time zones?\n\nThe first zone starts at UTC + 0 and the last is UTC + 3.\n\nWestern Europe Time Zones\n\nIn Western Europe, the region is normally on Western European Time (WET) and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) with no offset. During Daylight Saving, those regions change to Western European Summer Time (WEST), British Summer Time (BST) and Irish Summer Time (IST) with an offset of UTC + 1.\n\nWhen Daylight Saving starts at the beginning of summer the clocks move forward at 1 AM local time to 2 AM. When it ends they move back an hour to 1 AM again.\n\nLocations this applies to include:\n\nCanary Islands\n\nFaroe Islands\n\nIreland\n\nPortugal\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nOf course, Iceland also falls under this ruling except the country remains on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) all year.\n\nCentral Europe Time Zones\n\nIn Central Europe, the region is normally on Central European Time (CET) with an offset of UTC + 1. During Daylight Saving, the regions change to Central European Summer Time (CEST) with an offset of UTC + 2.\n\nWhen Daylight Saving starts at the beginning of summer the clocks move forward at 2 AM local time to 3 AM. When it ends they move back an hour to 2 AM again.\n\nLocations this applies to include:\n\nAlbania\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nCroatia\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nHungary\n\nItaly\n\nNetherlands\n\nNorway\n\nPoland\n\nSlovakia\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nEastern Europe Time Zones\n\nIn Eastern Europe, the region is normally on Eastern European Time (EET) with an offset of UTC + 2. During Daylight Saving, the regions change to Eastern European Summer Time (EEST) with an offset of UTC + 3.\n\nWhen Daylight Saving starts at the beginning of summer the clocks move forward at 3 AM local time to 4 AM. When it ends they move back an hour to 3 AM again.\n\nLocations this applies to include:\n\nBulgaria\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nGreece\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nMoldova\n\nRomania\n\nTurkey\n\nUkraine\n\nKaliningrad, Russia\n\nIt's worth noting that in the country of Ukraine several areas do not follow these standards. Those areas include Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nBelarus and Western Russia Exceptions\n\nBelarus and Western Russia do not observe Daylight Saving. Therefore, year round these two regions follow Further-Eastern European Time (FET) and Moscow Standard Time (MSK) respectively with an offset of UTC + 3.\n\nDaylight Saving In Europe\n\nDaylight Saving in Europe starts on the last Sunday of March every year, and the changes vary across the country because there are so many time zones used. The Daylight Saving period is all over on the last Sunday of October and clocks are returned to normal.\n\nThere is one region in the area that does not observe Daylight Saving, and that's Iceland.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWhat is a Time Zone?"
