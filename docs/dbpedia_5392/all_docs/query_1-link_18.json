        "text": "Less known than Dubrovnik, and less fashionable than its Croatian coastal colleagues Zadar and Split, Pula (pulainfo.hr; croatia.hr) is nonetheless an intriguing destination as summer arrives. The UK travel market still sees it as a landing strip for the beaches in Istria (particularly around Porec, Rovinj, Novigrad and Umag, on the west coast of the peninsula), but this small city rewards those who decide to linger in its narrow streets before heading to their sun lounger. It echoes with history and culture – this alliance perhaps most visible in its annual film festival (pulafilmfestival.hr; July 13-21 this year), which is held in the port’s remarkable first-century Roman amphitheatre.\n\nPula’s status as a fly-and-flop gateway means flights are plentiful in the hotter months – British Airways (ba.com) from Heathrow, easyJet (easyjet.com) from Bristol, Gatwick, Liverpool and Southend, Ryanair (ryanair.com) from Stansted, Jet2 (jet2.com) from Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds-Bradford, Stansted and Manchester, and Tui (tui.com) from Birmingham, Bristol, Doncaster-Sheffield, East Midlands, Gatwick and Manchester.\n\nStay here\n\nA five-star boutique property tucked a mile south of the historic centre at Tommaseova 10, Villa Vulin (villa-vulin.hr) is a good choice for a tranquil escape. It boasts just six suites, from £133 a night (room only). A three-star right on the doorstep of the star attraction at Amfiteatarska 6, the Hotel Amfiteatar (hotelamfiteatar.com) is more about location than amenities, but has comfortable double rooms for £69 (with breakfast).\n\nWalk here\n\nYou can gain a glimpse of Pula’s soul by strolling Riva ulica, the main waterfront street. At its east end, Valerijin Park is a pocket of yew and cypress trees. But walk west and you see a flintier side of the city, fishing boats decanting onto the quayside, larger vessels being constructed in the Uljanik shipyard ahead, defunct rail tracks still set in the cobbles. Midway along the front – at Trg (Square) Svetog Tome 2 – you find the Cathedral of the Assumption. A church has stood here since the fourth century – not so long after the era when Christians were martyred in the amphitheatre. Architectural shards of that time linger (and there are fifth-century mosaics inside) – but the present building is mainly 18th century. The baroque bell tower, dislocated from the main edifice, was completed in 1707. Further west, Trg Forum is still dominated by the Temple of Augustus (10 kuna/£1.20), a tribute to the first Roman emperor, which was built in his lifetime (probably in the first decade of the first century). Its grand facade, four Corinthian columns rising sturdily, still looks the part. It survived because it was later used as a church (and as a grain store).\n\nSee this\n\nThe amphitheatre (Flavijevska ulica; ami-pula.hr; K50/£6) is a wonder, rearing as an unbroken circle of masonry, 107ft tall. Built to its final height in AD79, it was able to seat 20,000. You can peer across it from the street behind, but there is much to be said for paying to enter an arena that retains every inch of its majesty.\n\nShop here\n\nA vision in antique iron and glass which first opened in 1903, Pula’s central market – at Narodni Trg 9 (trznica-pula.hr) – is the place to pick up Istrian gourmet fare, such as walnut oil and truffle products. Enoteca Istriana, meanwhile, occupies a prime spot at Trg Forum 11 (stefanija.com/en/enoteca), and uses it to sell bottles of the increasingly respected wine that flows from the region’s vineyards.\n\nTry this\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art of Istria (Svetog Ivana ulica 1; msu-istre.hr; K10/£1.20) has a fine collection of Croatian works from the past 70 years. Around the corner at Svetog Teodora ulica 1a, the Museum of Olive Oil (oleumhistriae.com; K50/£6), inspects the mythology and methodology of Istria’s liquid gold, and runs tasting sessions.\n\nDrink here\n\nParallel to Riva, pedestrianised drag Kandlerova ulica is the authority on options for a drink. Boca, at number 34, is one of the best, revelling in cocktails from K35 (£4).\n\nEat here\n\nPitched just in from the water at Kapitolinski Trg 9, Piazza Nove (12) is a seafood specialist (facebook.com/piazza.nove.pula), dealing in sushi, fresh tuna, and the catch of the day from K85 (£10). Meating, at Riva 12 (facebook.com/meatingloungepula), rather gives away its raison d’être in its name, serving up chunky steaks from K100 (£12).\n\nOff the map"
