        "text": "On the first Sunday of every November, the U.S. time switches back to standard time, marking the end of the Daylight Saving Time (DST) period.\n\nThis year, clocks were turned back by an hour at 2 a.m. on November 7, so the local time became 1 a.m., which means there is now an extra hour in the day.\n\nThe U.K.'s Royal Museums of Greenwich explains that from 1884 until 1972, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) was the international standard of civil time.\n\nGMT is the yearly average of the time each day when the Sun crosses the Prime Meridian at the U.K.'s Royal Observatory in Greenwich in London, England.\n\nGMT is now known as Coordinated Universal Time or Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). Also referred to as \"Z time\" or \"Zulu Time,\" UTC is a coordinated time scale maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM).\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) explains: \"To obtain your local time here in the United States, you need to subtract a certain number of hours from UTC depending on how many time zones you are away from Greenwich (England).\"\n\nThe switch to DST does not affect UTC. \"It refers to time on the zero or Greenwich meridian, which is not adjusted to reflect changes either to or from Daylight Saving Time,\" the NOAA says.\n\nWhat Time Is it in ET and PT?\n\nAt the time of reporting, it is 7:20 a.m. in Eastern Standard Time (ET), while it is still 4:20 a.m. in Pacific Standard Time (PT).\n\nSee the website of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology for the latest times.\n\nTime Difference Between U.S. and Europe\n\nThere are three different time zones across Europeâ€”Western European Time (GMT/UTC), Eastern European Time, and Central European Time.\n\nAt the time of reporting, the UTC time is 12:20 p.m., marking a five hour time difference with the U.S. The current Central European Time is 1:20 p.m. (six hours ahead of the U.S.), while the Eastern European Time is 2:20 p.m. (seven hours ahead of the U.S.).\n\nTime Difference Between U.S. and Asia and Middle East\n\nThere are several different time zones across Asia and the Middle East, all of which are ahead of the U.S. Some countries are ahead by an interval that's less than an hour. For example, India is 5.5 hours ahead of UTC, while Nepal is 5.75 hours ahead of UTC.\n\nThe U.S. time difference with countries in the region can range from them being around seven hours ahead (such as Jordan, Israel and Lebanon) to some 14 hours ahead (such as in East Asian countries, for example, Japan, China as well as North and South Korea).\n\nMany Asian countries do not observe DST.\n\nTime Difference Between U.S. and Australia\n\nAustralia, the sixth largest country in the world, has multiple time zones that cover its six states and two territories. The time zones include:\n\nAustralian Eastern Standard Time (AEST): 15 hours ahead of the U.S.\n\nAustralian Central Standard Time (ACST): 14.5 hours ahead of the U.S.\n\nAustralian Western Standard Time (AWST): 13 hours ahead of the U.S.\n\nNorfolk Island Standard Time (NFT): 16 hours ahead of the U.S.\n\nChristmas Island Standard Time (CXT): 12 hours ahead of the U.S.\n\nCocos (Keeling) Islands Standard Time (CCT): 11.5 hours ahead of the U.S.\n\nTime Difference Between U.S. and Africa\n\nMost of the Africa continent spans the Equator, so daylight hours do not vary much across the year. DST also is not observed in most of Africa."
