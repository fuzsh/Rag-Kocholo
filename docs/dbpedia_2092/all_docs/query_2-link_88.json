        "text": "Dramatis Personae of the History and Exploration of the Greater Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamirs, Hindu-Kush, Tibet, the Indian Sub-Continent, Afghanistan, High Tartary and Surrounding Territories, up to 1921.\n\nBill Buxton\n\nLast updated May 27th, 2019\n\nA work in progress.\n\n\"A Comparative View of the Principal Mountains\n\nin the World with their Altitudes\".\n\nThe scan of this 1830 image was given to me be a colleague, Nahum Gershon, of Mitre Corp. He found the original in a flea market in NYC. It was accompanied by a penciled note saying:\n\nHand-colored steel engraving of the Thos. Starling \"Family Cabinet Atlas\" London, Bull & Co., 1820.'\n\nThis date (1820) is different from the one printed on the engraving (1830) - a mistake of the writer in pencil? Click on the image to get a high resolution version on which you can read the captions.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is a companion page to my pages on the literature, chronology and lexicon of terms and events around the history of Central Asia, including the history of exploration and mountaineering:\n\nBooks on the History of Central Asia, and the History of Climbing, Mountaineering & Exploration - With a special focus on the territories of, and around, the Greater Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamirs, Hindu-Kush, Tibet & High Tartary\n\nAn Historical Time-line of the Greater Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamirs, Hindu-Kush, Tibet, High Tartary, and Surrounding Territories.\n\nA Lexicon of Vocabulary, Events and Treaties from India and Central Asia\n\nThe simple matter is, I simply can't keep track of all of the people involved in the history and exploration of this part of the world, a region on which I focus most of my reading. Hence, as I encounter people of significance, I add them to this page, and then augment my notes about them as I encounter them further in other works, etc. Hence, it serves me as an aid in remembering who was who, what they did, when they did it, and - perhaps most important - through the hyperlinks - helps capture how people, events, and books by-and-about them, relate to one another. Trying to capture and understand the relationships seems as, if not more, important, than the individuals themselves.\n\nIn order to keep the page manageable, I have adopted a self imposed constraint to limit the period covered to before 1921, the date of the first Everest expedition. Even with this constraint, this page, almost definition, incomplete, superficial, and sparse. Furthermore, I acknowledge drawing on the short British Library web site Who Was Who in Central Asia (British), for some dates and facts.\n\nEntries represent individuals, listed alphabetically by last name. I speak none of the languages of the area, so I beg the reader's patience in my spellings, and in my choice of the name under which I index people. I can only offer that I have done my best, and that the literature that I have reviewed is also inconsistent in both spelling and indexing conventions. In many cases, I have tried to ensure that all common spellings are included, and with Chinese names, I have chosen to index according to the modern spellings, but with links from the older form.\n\nThere are four types of references on this page:\n\n1.In the body of the entries you will find certain names underlined and in blue. These are people, events, or locations for which there is a separate entry that I have written in my pages. Clicking on the indicated word will take you to that entry.\n\n2.In the body of the entries, you will also see things like: \"[Cit. 1, 2, 3]\". These are links to pages on the internet written by others from which I have drawn information, or which are relevant to the person or event being discussed. Just click on the digits to access the associated source.\n\n3.After many entries, you will find publications listed under the heading, \"Refs\". These are books either by or about the person and events in the entry. Those which have the title in blue and underlined are references that are in my personal library, listed on the page, Books on Climbing, Mountaineering & Exploration. Clicking on the title will get you to the reference and my annotation to it. Those which do not have links from their titles are relevant sources that are on my \"wish list.\" Where I do not have full bibliographic data, you will find the characters \"XX\" in the incomplete field.\n\n4.There are some general sources from the web which are listed at the end of this web page\n\nPlease think of this as an \"open source\" page. As with all of my pages, comments and suggestions are welcome - especially suggestions for additional people to include, mini-biographies for them, or additions, corrections, etc. to biographical or bibliographic notes that I currently have.\n\nFinally, in many ways this page is rendered redundant in light of the Wikipedia. At some point I will cross-reference my entries with it. However, this page still has value in the fact that it lets me have tighter cross-links with my other, related pages. Each has its own strengths.\n\nA\n\nAbbott, Capt. James\n\nBritish officer sent to Khiva from Herat in response to Perovsky's 1839 expedition to seize the city. The objective was to convince the Khan to free the Russian slaves held in the city before the Russian force got too far. In so doing, the idea was to remove the justification used for the invasion. While he did not succeed in freeing the slaves, he did manage to treat with the Khan and get agreement to negotiate the freedom of the slaves with the Russians, should they halt their invasion. As it turns out, the Russians were stopped by the weather, and the slaves were freed, nevertheless, by Abbott's fellow officer Shakespear, shortly thereafter, in 1840.\n\nRefs:\n\noAbbott, Capt. James. (1843). Narrative of a Journey from Heraut to Khiva, Moscow and St. Petersburg, During the Late Russian Invasion of Khiva; With Some Account of the Court of Khiva and the Kingdom of Khaurism. London: Wm. H. Allen.\n\nAbdul Kadir Khan\n\nAn Indian merchant and Moslem holy man active in Nepal, who served as Duncan's agent in Kathmandu during the second Tibetan-Nepalese conflict (1791-92). In 1795 was dispatched by the East India Company to Kathmandu, with inventory, to set himself up as a trader in Nepal, with the objective of collecting information concerning potential trade with Tibet. The idea was to see if Nepal could be a gateway for trade with Tibet, after 1792. A trusted native trader was considered as having more chance of success in this than a European. The mission was a success in that it established that there was a market for British good in Nepal, and that furthermore, many of these goods were subsequently exported to Tibet. The primary issue was that the Gurkha middle-men stood between the British traders and Tibet, and that the commissions that they took diminished the business viability.\n\nAbdurrahman Khan\n\nSee Abdur Rahman Khan.\n\nAbruzzi, Duke of. (Prince Luigi Amedeo of Savoy) (18731933).\n\nAn Italian noble who undertook a number of exceptional expeditions, including the first ascent of Mount St. Elias on the Alaskan border (1897), an attempt to reach the North Pole (1899-1900) which reached a point farther north than Nansen's record, the Ruwenzori mountains in Africa (1906) and an attempt on K2 (1909), on which he set a world altitude record of 24,600 ft.\n\nAssociated with the geographer Filippo de Filippi and the photographer Vittorio Sella, both of whom accompanied him to Mount St. Elias, Africa and K2. On the K2 expedition, was also accompanied by the Brocherol brothers.\n\nRefs:\n\n·Audisio, Aldo (Ed.). (1991). Alpinismo Italiano in Karakorum / Italian Mountaineering in the Karakoram.

Seattle: The Mountaineers.\n\nAdam, J.\n\nSecretary to the Indian Government during Anglo-Gurkha war of 1814-16. Made the suggestion to establish relations with Sikkim during the war, as a means of establishing a diplomatic link with the Chinese in Lhasa. Given the close links between Sikkim and Tibet, the intent was to help mitigate against fears that the war might have a negative impact on Anglo-Chinese relations. (See note on Dr. Buchanan.) This led directly to the missions of Captain Latter and David Scott.\n\nAfzal Khan (1811-1867)\n\nSecond son of Dost Mohammed and father of Abdur Rahman, (who himself became Amir of Afghanistan after the second Anglo-Afghan war). Afzal had his land confiscated and was imprisoned by his brother, Amir Sher Ali. This was during the five year struggle for power after the death of Dost Mohammed in 1863. When Rahman had temporary success against Sher Ali, and captured Kabul, he freed his father, and installed him as Amir in 1866. However, Afzal Khan died of cholera 1867, and was briefly succeeded by his brother, Azim Khan.\n\nAfzul, Sher\n\nBrother of Aman-ul-Mulk. Murdered Afzul-ul-Mulk, his nephew, whom he then succeeded as Mehar of Chitral. Supported in this by Amir of Kabul. Ousted by Nizam-ul-Mulk, Afzul's brother. Nizam was encouraged to do so by Algernon Durand, who did not trust the Afghan influence on Afzul. On being deposed, Afzul fled back to Afghanistan.\n\nAfzul-ul-Mulk\n\nSon of Aman-ul-Mulk. Seized Meharship on his father's death in 1892, and proceeded to kill rivals. Meharship approved by Algernon Durand and Lockhart. Murdered shortly after taking power by his uncle, Sher Afzul, who then succeeded him.\n\nAgnew, P.A. Vans\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the first Anglo-Sikh war, in July 1846 was appointed (along with Captain A. Cunningham) as joint commissioner to establish the boundary between Ladakh and Tibet. The commissioners were also charged with investigating the state of trade with Tibet.\n\nAhmed (Ahmad) Shah Bahadur (1727 - 1775)\n\nSucceeded father, Muhammad Shah, as Mugal emperor in 1748. During his reign, his namesake, Ahmed Shah Abdali invaded the Punjab for the second time and obtained the cessation of the whole province. In 1754 he was then deposed and blinded by his Wazir, Ghazi-ud-din, who placed Alamgir II, a son of Jahander Shah, on the throne. He died the following year.\n\nAhmed (Ahmad) Khan, Shah Abdali (Durrani) (1722 - 1772)\n\nFounder of the dynasty of the Popozai/ Saduzai branch of the Durranis. Afghan military leader, known as the \"Father of Afghanistan.\" Sometimes referred to as Ahmed Shah Durrani or Ahmed Khan. Had been one of the military leaders of Nadir Shah. On Nadir's death in 1747, Ahmed not only had a number of troops at his disposal, he also had possession of his treasury, both of which he used to build up his power. This he used to take control, initially of the territories of what was to become Afghanistan, and then made himself Shah, a position he maintained until his death in 1772. Founder of the dynasty of the Popozai branch of the Durranis (Duranni / Douranee) tribe. In this, he was supported by the Barukzais branch of the Durrani, led by Payanda Khan. The Popozai branch held power until the rise of Dost Mohammed., which brought the Barukzais branch of the Durrani to power. Between 1748 and 1769, Ahmed invaded India nine times, and established an Afghan hegemony over most of northwest India, including Kashmir, Sind and Delhi. While he succeeded in uniting Afghanistan, he failed to consolidate his larger (Indian) empire, and it disintegrated on his death. Had seven sons. Grandfather of Shah Shuja. Ahmed Shah was succeeded by his son, Timur Shah.\n\nA.K.\n\nSee Kishen Singh.\n\nAkbar, Jalal ud-Din Muhammad (1543-1605)\n\nMughal emperor (1556-1605), succeeding his father, Humayun. Known as Akbar the Great: Shah of Shahs. Mother tongue was form of Turki, and the state language was Persian. Considered the greatest of Mughal rulers (see Woodruff's, The Founders, for example). Laid foundation for religious tolerance in the empire. In 1562 married Padmini, a Hindu princess from Rajaputana. In 1564 abolished the Jizya, a \"poll tax\" that had been levied on non-Muslims. Also reformed the system of land tax which was sustainable, in that it was fair, and did not \"break the back\" of those who worked the land. Father of Jehangir, who succeeded him.\n\nRefs:\n\n·Eraly, Abraham (2003). The Mughal Throne: The Saga of India's Great Emperors. London: Weidenfeld & Nicholson.\n\nAkbar Khan, Mohammed (1818-1847)\n\nMember of the Barakzai branch of the Durranis. Oldest son of Dost Mohammed. At 19 led a campaign to try and win back Peshawar from the Sikhs. In 1841 returned to Kabul as one of the leaders during the uprising against the British during the First Anglo-Afghan war. Treated with Macnaghten, but caught him in double dealing and killed him in 1841, after playing the same game in reverse. Double dealt with the British, and especially the incompetent Elphinstone, during their disastrous retreat. Lived to see his father restored to the throne, but died at age 29, never assuming the throne, himself.\n\nAkhun, Islam\n\nTreasure hunter in region around Khotan. In the mid 1890's was one of the prime sources for \"ancient\" manuscripts in a hitherto unknown language and script, which found their way into collections in London, Calcutta, St. Petersburg and Paris. Macartney bought a number of these for Hoernle. As it turns out, there was a reason that the script was unknown. As Stein was able to determine, it was made up by Akhun, and the manuscripts were forgeries that he had made.\n\nAlamgir II, Muhammad Aizuddin (1699 - 1759)\n\nSon of Jahandar Shah. Placed on the throne as Mugal Emperor in 1754 by Ghazi-ud-din, the Wazir who had blinded, and deposed Ahmad Shah. During his reign, in 1754, Ahmed Shah Abdali invaded the Punjab for the fourth time and captured Delhi. Alamgir II was succeeded by his son, Shah Alam II in 1759, after he was murdered by Ghazi-ud-din.\n\nAlexander III of Macedon (Alexander the Great) (356-323 B.C.)\n\nBetween 343-323 BC conquered Central Asia. He moved through the Persian empire, defeating the last of its provinces, Bactria, in 328 BC. Proceeded through Afghanistan, and penetrated into the Punjab and Kashmir. [Cit: 1]\n\nAli Khan, Sardar Muhammad\n\nMember of the Barakzai branch of the Durranis. Son of Amir Sher Ali, and older brother of Yakub Khan.\n\nAli Mirza, Muhammad\n\nReported to be nephew of Dost Mohammed, but the name suggests that he was rather a member of Popozai branch of Durrani tribe. Employed by Rambir Singh, Maharaja of Kashmir. Sent to Kabul on intelligence mission in July 1889, and was present when the British embassy, under Cavagnari, was sacked.\n\nAli, Muhoomed (Mohammed)\n\nNative surveyor from the Survey of India. Educated at the Engineer Institute of Bombay. Accompanied Burnes in his 1831 trip up the Indus, delivering 4 dray horses, which were a gift of the crown to Ranjit Singh. Also traveled with Burnes to Bokhara in 1832.\n\nAli, Safdur\n\nHunza ruler. Received Gromchevsky in 1888, which prompted visit by Younghusband. Obtained power by killing father, mother and two brothers. Notorious for supporting raids from Hunza on caravans traveling between Ladakh and Yarkand, on the Karakoram route. Due to this, was eventually deposed in 1891 by a British mission from Gilgit led by Algernon Durand.\n\nAllard, Jean Francois (1785-1839)\n\nFrench. Served in the imperial army of France. On defeat of Napoleon, came to Lahore, along with Ventura, in 1822 to seek service in the Sikh army of Ranjit Singh. On approaching the Khyber Pass, en route to Lahore, encountered the Hungarian Körösi, who traveled the rest of the way with their caravan. [Cit. 1 ] Placed in charge of recruiting and training Ranjit Singh's cavalry. Returned to France on leave in June 1834 and returned 18 months later. Allard continued to serve Singh until his death in 1839.\n\nRefs:\n\noGrey, C. (H. L. O. Garrett, ed.) (1929). European Adventurers of Northern India, 1785 to 1849.

Returned to Europe from his trip to Goa, India, in 1603, and reported the existence of a Christian community surviving in Ladakh. This report helped provide a catalyst for the subsequent trip of Father Antonio de Andrada.\n\nRefs:\n\noMaclagan, Sir Edward. (1932). The Jesuits and the Great Mogul.

Won out over his uncle, Nasrullah's claim to succeed Habibullah as Amir of Afghanistan. Amanullah is suspected of being involved in his father's death. Regardless, shortly after assuming control, capitalizing on unrest in India, and perhaps partially to divert attention from domestic affairs, declared a jihad against Britain on May 5, 1919. Afghans entered territories across the northwest frontier of India, which had at times been part of Afghanistan, and this prompted the brief third Anglo-Afghan War. Despite limited resources, partially due to this occurring on the tail of WW I, Britain nevertheless responded strongly and decisively to this incursion, and by May 31, Amanullah sued for peace. Despite being soundly defeated, Afghanistan came off reasonably well from this conflict. Amanullah retained his power, and, by the Treaty of Rawalpindi, Britain gave up its claim to control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs, but Afghanistan lost the subsidy that had hitherto been paid by Britain since the Treaty of Gadamank. One consequence of this was that Afghanistan became one of the first countries to recognize and establish diplomatic relations with the new Soviet Russia. Forced to abdicate in January of 1929, shortly after his 1927-28 tour of Europe. Succeeded for 5 days by his older brother, Inayatullah.\n\nAman-ul-Mulk (??-1892)\n\nStrong Mehar of Chitral for 35 years, who was considered a British ally at the time. His death in August 1892 gave rise to a power struggle which lasted two years, with British intervention and the siege of Chitral as the outcome. (See entry for Robertson.) The two years following his death were sufficiently chaotic that it is worth listing his successors during that period in order: Afzul-ul-Mulk, Sher Afzul, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Amir-ul-Mulk, and Shuja-ul-Mulk, all of whom were his sons, except for Sher Afzul, who was his brother. It is hard to match the ruthlessness and intrigue of this family!\n\nAmherst, William Pitt (Amherst, Earl of) (1773-1857)\n\nSent as ambassador extraordinaire to China in 1816. Got to China, but was not permitted to visit Beijing. Mission a failure. Governor-General of Bengal 1823-1828, following Lord Moira. Succeeded by Lord William Bentick. [Cit. 1 ].\n\nAmir-ul-Mulk\n\nHalf-witted son of Aman-ul-Mulk, Mehar of Chitral. Took asylum in Afghanistan with his Pathan uncle, Umra Khan, when his brother Afzul-ul-Mulk seized power on his father's death in 1892. Became Mehtar of Chitral by murdering his half brother, the British supported Nizam-ul-Mulk. Amir asked for British recognition from Gurdon, who had traveled there with a small escort of 8 men, to pay respects to Nizam. Fearing for his safety, Gurdon stalled Amir, and sent a message to Robertson in Gilgit for help, which came. While British were at Mastuj in January 1895, news came that Umra Khan had entered Chitral territory with an army, apparently at the request of Amir, who feared British retribution for the killing of Nizam. This led to Robertson continuing on to the town of Chitral, and the subsequent siege. Deposed by British (Robertson) and replaced by his 12 year old brother, Shuja-ul-Mulk.\n\nAndrada (Andrale), Father Antonio de (1580 - 1634)\n\nA Jesuit father. Partially motivated by the reports of Christian communities surviving in Tibet (such as from Goes and Almeida), left on his first trip from the mission in Agra, near Delhi, in 1624. Was accompanied by a lay brother, Manuel Marques. Traveled to western Himalayan province of Guge, visiting the capital of Tsaparang. Stayed three weeks before returning to Agra. Returned in 1625 to establish a permanent mission in Tsaparang. Father Andrada was called back to Goa, in 1630, and died there in 1634. The mission in Tsaparang was closed in 1635. An attempt to reopen it in 1640 failed.\n\nRefs:\n\noWessels, C. (1924). Early Jesuit Travellers in Central Asia 1603-1721. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff.\n\nAshraf Khan (XX - 1730)\n\nSon of Mahmud, who he succeeded on his father's death in 1725. Halted attempt by Turks to invade Persia, and consolidated Afghan control of the country. In 1727 signed a peace treaty with Turks that gave him control over Persia in exchange for recognition of Turkish religious supremacy in Islam. The Afghan position in Persia was ended by the rise of Nadir Shah, who was\n\nin the service of Shah Tahmasp, and Ashraf Khan was killed in 1730 during a retreat following a defeat by his army.\n\nAuckland, George Eden, Earl of, 2nd Baron Auckland, 2nd Baron Auckland of Auckland, Baron Eden of Norwood (1784-1849)\n\nIn 1836 became governor-general of British India, in Calcutta. Succeeded Charles Metcalfe. Wrote letter which alienated Afghan leader, Dost Mohammed, demanding that he both give up his claims to Peshawar, and stop his interactions with the Russians. The letter held a veiled threat of dire consequences should he not comply, and as such, undermined the relationship built up with him by Burnes. Encouraged by Macnaghten, and against the advice of Burnes, issued the Simla Manifesto, October 1st 1838. This committed the British to restoring Shah Shujah as Amir of Afghanistan, at the expense of Dost Mohammed. The justification was ostensibly Dost Mohammed's lack of loyalty in treating with the Russians (who had already withdrawn due to the pressure put on them by Palmerston). The condition of restoring Shah Shujah was that he relinquish any claims on Peshawar, in favour of Ranjit Singh. The Simla Manifesto was enforced in 1839, by British troops, the \"Army of the Indus,\" led by General Keane, thus precipitating the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-1842). Succeeded by Lord Ellenborough in 1842.\n\nRefs:\n\noTrotter, Lionel James (XXXX). Lord Auckland. XX: XX.\n\nAurangzib (Aurangzebe / Aurungzebe) Alamgir (1618-1707)\n\nThird son of Shah Jehan. In 1658 Shah Jehan became ill, and Aurangzib took the opportunity to seize the throne, kill his brothers, and imprison his father, who remained in captivity until his death eight years later in 1666. Aurangzib was the last of the great Mughal emperors. While there was an emperor in name until the mutiny in 1857, their power was increasingly symbolic, being weakened by internal fighting, self indulgence and incompetence, coupled with the increasing power of the British.\n\nAurangzib was emperor of Hindustan for almost 50 years, from 1659 -1707. His reign doomed any chance of future harmony between Hindu and Muslim. He reversed the religious tolerance towards non-Muslims established by Akbar, destroying temples and idols, and, in 1679, reinstated the Jizya, the \"poll tax\" for non-Muslims. The latter part of his reign was marked by overextending himself in wars with Sikhs, Marathas and Rajputs. Was succeeded by his eldest son, Muazzin (Bahadur Shah).\n\nAvitabile, Paolo Di (1791-1850)\n\nBorn in Agerola and began service in the Neopolitan militia. Following fall of Napoleon, ended up serving as a mercenary in Persia. Then moved to the Punjab where, along with Allard, Ventura and Court, became one of the four principal French officers serving Ranjit Singh. In 1835 was appointed Governor of Peshawar, and established order, albeit by ruthless means. He held that post during the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-1842), his presence being strategic to the British. (The possession of Peshawar was the source of dispute between the Sikhs and Afghans. It had been taken by Ranjit Singh's army in 1834, and it was one of the bargaining chips used by the British in soliciting the support of the Sikhs during the war.) Avitabile left Peshawar in 1843, and returned to Italy. He is one of the few adventurers who built a fortune and was able to leave with it.\n\nRefs:\n\noCotton, Julian James (1906).

Despite being wounded, set charges at the gates of Nilt, in Nager, which when exploded, enabled the fort to be taken.\n\nAyub Khan, Mohammed (1857-1914)\n\nMember of the Barakzai branch of the Durranis. Fifth son of Sher Ali by his third wife Mariam Begum. Governor of Herat. In 1874 fled to Merat, fearing that his father would imprison him, as he did his brother Yakub Khan. Returned to Herat as governor in 1879, when Yakub became Amir. He established himself as Amir at Herat from March 1880. In that year he set out from Herat with a large force with the intent of pushing the British Garrison in Kandahar out of Afghanistan, and to assert his claimed succession as Amir, following the abdication/removal of Yakub. On July 27, 1880, engaged the British under Brigadier-General George Burrows 60 km west of Kandahar at Maiwand. Severely defeated the British, who suffered over 1,000 casualties, and were pushed back to Kandahar and placed under siege. General Roberts, who was about to evacuate Kabul, on hearing of this disaster rushed to relieve the garrison. His force of 10,000 made a remarkable forced march of 300 miles in 20 days. On hearing of Roberts' advance, Ayub Khan retreated from the siege, and tried to negotiate. Roberts refused and engaged the Afghan force, on September 1, soundly defeating them (35 British fatalities compared to over 600 Afghan). The British subsequently withdrew from Kandahar, and ceded it to the Amir of Kabul, Ayub Khan's cousin Abdur Rahman. However, it was taken back by Ayub Khan in June 1881. This was not to last, and in July of that year he was pushed back from Kandahar and while tied up there, Abdur Rahman also sent a force to Herat, which they captured. The result was that Ayub was forced into exile in Persia, and Abdur Rahman was established as Amir of all of Afghanistan, rather than just Kabul. In the summer of 1888, Ayub attempted to return to Afghanistan to join the governor of Balkh, Ishaq Khan, who was rebelling against Abdur Rahman. He was headed off, however, and consequently surrended for protection to General MacLean, the British agent at Meshed. He then retired to India.\n\nAzevedo, Luiz de (1573-1634)\n\nJesuit missionary from Portugal active in Afghanistan. He became a Jesuit in 1588, and sailed for the Indies in 1592. In 1605 he began his missionary labours in Ethiopia, where he remained until his death. Was one of the first Europeans to cross the Himalaya. In 1631 he reached Leh by the Mani Pass and then returned to India by Baralacha and Rohtang Passes.\n\nAzim Khan (1818-1869)\n\nMember of the Barakzai branch of the Durranis. Not to be confused with his uncle of the same name (see next entry). Oldest son of Dost Mohammed. Died childless. Became Amir after his brother, Amir Afzal Khan died of cholera 1867. This prompted a conflict with Afzal's son, Azim's nephew, Abdur Rahman. The resulting power struggle provided the opportunity for Sher Ali, Azim and Afzal's brother to regain control, in 1868.

Then appointed trade agent in the Chumbi Valley until August 1909. In 1911, while on leave, travelled overland from Beijing, through Tibet, to Assam with the intent of exploring the Tsangpo River. He was stopped in Tibet. However in 1913, he returned to Tibet and the lower Tsangpo. This time he travelled with Morshead, from Assam (the first Europeans to do so).and was able to disprove the popular belief that there was a great waterfall where the river cut through the Himalaya. On the return to India, they mapped regions along the Tibet / Burma / Assam border. (This survey was timely with respect to the conference led by McMahon, and which led to the Simla Convention.) Bailey was awareded the Royal Geographical Society Gold Medal for this trip. In all of his trips, Bailey was an avid collector of flora and fauna. There are a large number of flowers, butterflies, etc. whose names reflect his discovery of them to western science. He left Political Service in 1938, having spent the years 1918-24 invovled in espionage in Soviet Russia.\n\nRefs:\n\noBailey, F.M. (1945). China, Tibet, Assam. A Journey, 1911.

Some of Robert's earliest climbs were in the Canadian Rockies, where he made two trips to Mount Assiniboine with Walter Wilcox (see account below by Wilcox) where they were the first to approach the mountain as well as circumnavigate it.\n\nOne of the main contributions that the Barretts gifted the mountaineering community is the only first person, self authored book from the early days, by someone native to the great ranges of Central Asia, Ghulam Rassul Galwan's 1923, Servant of the Sahibs: A Book to be Read Aloud. Captivated by the fire-side stories of their sirdar, Galwan, the Barretts taught him to write in order that he could put them to paper on his own. They then arranged for the book to be published, without editing (other than for comprehension), and they themselves remained anonymous in the volume which resulted. Even if it was not the only such book, it would still be in the top-10 favourites in my library. And as the sub-title states, it must be read aloud, since doing so will transport you to a different time and place, captured by the spell of Galwan's voice.\n\nSince my notes on the Barretts are not yet complete, here are two pointers for background, besides reading their diverse books, see the brief Peakfinder biography, and Wilcox's article - both below, and freely available on the web.\n\nRefs:\n\nBarrett, Katherine Ellis.

This was in the middle of \"The Great Game\" between Russia and British India, and it was during Yakub Beg's tenure that Hayward and Shaw visited, and were held, in Kashgar. British India's desire to establish trade relations with Beg led to the 1st and 2nd Forsyth Missions.\n\nTo check the advance of Yakub to the west, the Russians who had captured Tashkent (27 June, 1865) took possession of Ili (Kulja), i.e. the north of the T'ien-shan, on 4 July, 1871. This Russian expansion led the British to put pressure on the Manchu court to re-annex East Turkistan. This they began in 1876, led by General Zho Zhung Tang. Yakub Beg was poisoned in 1876 and died the next year. By 1878, East Turkistan was once again under Chinese rule.

Despite having no previous climbing experience, his experience in India and skills in logistics let to his being invited to join the expedition in the capacity of transportation officer and interpreter. Due to a range of circumstances, including illness amongst the climbers, Geoffrey Bruce, along with a Gurkha NCO from his regiment, Tejbir Bura (who, likewise, had no previous climbing experience), joined George Finch on a push from base camp on an attempt to get as high as possible - hopefully the summit. The three pushed above the North Col towards the north shoulder, where a storm forced them to camp. The next day they proceeded, however Tejbir turned back to the last camp due to fatigue, while Finch and Bruce continued using supplemental oxygen. In their push they reached 8,300 metres, which exceeded the previous high point (which had been reached by Mallory, Norton and Somervell without supplementary oxygen). Hence, Finch and Bruce set a new world altitude record - and did so on Bruce's first climb!\n\nIn 1924, Bruce was again invited to join the Everest expedition, this time in the capacity of both Transportation Officer and climber.\n\nBrydon, Dr. William\n\nInitially appeared to be the only survivor of the British retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan war.

Warned of potential problems with Anglo-Chinese relations due to the Britsh activity in Nepal, which China considered as falling within their sphere. This warning was supported by intelligence provided by Mir Izzet Ullah. To mitigate the risk, on the advice of J. Adam, the British established relations with Sikkim in the hopes of using this as a base for establishing a dialogue with the Chinese in Lhasa. Furthermore, Buchanan suggested that upsetting the Chinese could be avoided if the British did not annex Nepal, but rather just punished the Gurkhas, and restored the Newar chiefs (who the Gurkhas had deposed) back to power. As it turns out, since there were no descendents of the Newars to be found, Nepal remained in the hands of the Gurkhas after the war, leading to it remaining an independent state right up to the present.

As an army officer in India, he studied Hinustani and Persian, and eventually transferred from the Bombay Native Infantry to the Political branch, where he was assistant to Sir Henry Pottinger, Resident of Sindh and Hyderabad. His first succesful trip began in January 1831. Four dray (heavy) horses, and a carriage, had been shipped from England as a gift to Ranjit Singh. Burnes was given the task of escorting the horses to Lahore. He was accompanied by Ensign J.D. Leckie, an Indian surveyor, Muhoomed Ali, and an Indian doctor. The decision was made to transport the horses up the Indus by boat, a distance of about 1,000 miles. The British had not done this route before, and the trip therefore served a double purpose, that is, providing an excuse to explore its viability. (Burnes had instructions to survey the river, depth, breadth, navigability, as well as supplies of fuel for steam boats, and the political situation of the territories through which they passed.) The trip took 6 months. On arrival in Lahore, the horses were marvelled at, and Burnes and Leckie were extremely well received by Ranjit Singh.\n\nDuring this trip, Burnes encountered native traders who had traveled through Afghanistan to Bokhara. Their descriptions of the city and the trip helped plant the seed for his next trip. This he began in 1832. He left Lahore in Afghan dress and traveled by way of Peshawar (where he encountered Avitabile) and Kabul across the Hindu Kush to Balkh and from there by Bokhara, Asterabad, and Tehran to Bushire.\n\nIn 1836, Burnes was appointed commercial agent in Kabul, where he established a close personal relationship with Dost Mohammed, the Amir of Afghanistan. With Wood, and others, he produced a number of maps of the region.\n\nBurnes was in Kabul in December 1837 when the Russian officer, Vitkevich, arrived. For a while he was able to maintain British influence on Dost Mohammed, but was finally undermined by threatening and unacceptable demands made on behalf of the British in a letter from Lord Auckland. This turned Dost Mohammed to the Russians, and Burnes had to leave Kabul in April 1838.\n\nHe returned to Kabul as political resident in 1839, accompanying the Army of the Indus, led by Keane, and as assistant to Macnaghten, who accompanied the army in order to be the British envoy to the court of the yet-to-be-installed Shah Shujah.\n\nBurnes lived in the town, rather than the British cantonment, where he was assassinated November 2nd 1841, along with his escort, his brother, and William Broadfoot.

He left Lyons, France at Easter, 1245, and was ccompanied by brothers Stephen of Bohemia and Benedict of Poland. Traveled via Kiev. It took nearly a year to cross Europe and reach Babur's camp outside of Kiev, which marked the Mongolian frontier. Because of the efficiency of the Mongolian transportation system, it took only106 days to travel the approximately 3,000 remaining miles to Karakorum. Carpine expected to be visiting the Great Khan Ogodei, but he had died in 1241, and his wife Toregene was acting as regent (1241-46). Carpine arrived just as her oldest son, Guyuk, was being installed as Great Khan. Carpine and his colleagues were cordially received, but this was largely because the Mongols believed that they were coming with a letter of submission from the Pope. However, just the opposite was true.

After the war he returned to Great Britain. Followed Hastings as Governor-General and Commander in Chief in India (1786-93). Alienated Tibet due to his negative response to their request for British support when the Gurkhas invaded Tibet from Nepal in 1788. Cornwallis only agreed not to help the Gurkhas. When the Gurkhas invaded Tibet a second time, in the absence of British support, the Tibetans went to the Chinese.\n\nConfronted with defeat at the hands of the Chinese forces, the Gurkhas sought British help from Cornwallis. This he declined. Rather, in 1793, he sent Kirkpatrick to Nepal as a mediator. However, there was nothing to mediate, since the Gurkhas were defeated. What resulted from the British action was the alienation of all three parties: Nepalese Gurkhas, the Tibetans and the Chinese.\n\nOne result was the consolidation of the Chinese suzerainty of Tibet, which was to have significant long-term consequence. (It was not until after the Japanese defeat of the Chinese in 1895 that Tibet was in a position to exercise any attempt at independent foreign policy.) Another was an end to the (albeit limited) trade with Tibet resulting from Turner's 1783-84 mission. A third result was a closing of Tibet to Europeans, much as China was also closed. These conditions were to last essentially until the Younghusband mission/invasion of 1904-5.\n\nCornwallis returned to England in 1793, and was succeeded by Sir John Shore.

With the increase in influence of British officers in Persian service, left with Avitable and went overland to the Punjab.

Besides this map, which was drawn from data collected first hand, he also produced a smaller scale map of Nepal, based on information obtained from native travelers. Crawford may have been the first European to suggest that the mountains in the Himalaya might be among the highest in the world (at that time, the belief was that the highest mountain in the world was Chimborazo in the Andes).

Met up with Younghusband in Kashgar during his stay in 1890-91. He arrived there destitute, having set out on leave, and without mountaineering experience, to cross the Mustagh Pass in emulation of Younghusband. Due to his being a British officer, his arrival in Kashgar was taken by Petrovsky as that of a spy. This he may have been, since many or most of the British officers traveling for shooting or sport in the region were actually working for intelligence, and took this guise so that their spying activities could be denied by the British government. Regardless, his arrival triggered a significant cooling in the relations between Younghusband and Petrovsky. Younghusband, believing his work done, left Kashgar in July 1891, returning back to India via the Pamirs. He left Macartney in Kashgar as the British representative, and took Davison with him. When, on his return journey, Younghusband was being ordered out of the Pamirs by Yanov, Davison was investigating Russian activity to the west. He was subsequently arrested by the Russians as well, and escorted to Chinese Turkistan. He and Younghusband made a rendezvous and returned to Gilgit to report their experiences.

He went to Lhasa to pursue his studies, and was eventually permitted to do so, despite being \"foreign.\" He became one of the teachers of the 13th Dalai Lama, as well as his political advisor. He had the ambition to create a Tibet-Mongolian federation that would be independent of China. In order to get their support in this, in 1898-99 and 1901, he made two trips to St. Petersburg, where he was received by senior levels of the Government. The first trip, at the invitation of Ukhtomsky, was via India, then by sea to Beijing, and then on to St. Petersburg. There he met Nicholas II. These trips were interpreted as Tibet treating with Russia. That Dorjiev traveled without detection through India compounded the suspicion with which his activities were seen, and they subsequently served as a significant catalyst to Curzon's initiation of the Younghusband mission of 1903-04. [Cit. 1]. In 1909 he was instrumental in establishing the first Buddhist temple in St. Petersburg. He died in Stalin's Gulag.\n\nThere has been significant scholarly debate on what role Dorjiev was actually playing. While Curzon is generally considered to have over reacted to Dorjiev's activities, was there some foundation to his belief that Dorjiev was a Russian agent? Much of the literature is based on records from India and Britain. It is only recently that the Russian archives have opened up to scholars to contribute to the debate. But even here there is some disagreement. Kuleshov provides a study, based on newly available Russian documents, and argues that, if anything, Dorjiev was a Tibetan agent, and that Curzon was wrong. On the other hand, a more recent paper by Andreyev, which includes a newly discovered brief biography of Dorjiev, argues that Dorjiev was, in fact - as suggested by Curzon - acting on Russia's behalf.\n\nRefs:\n\noAndreyev, Alexandre (1993).

In 1816 there was a rebellion against the Afghan ruler Mahmud Shah (who had come to power in 1810, having deposed his younger brother, Shah Shujah). Following 8 years of civil strife, Dost Mohammed emerged as the strongest leader, and in 1826 became Amir. This brought to power the Barukzais branch of the Durani (Duranni / Douranee) tribe, ending the dynasty of the Suddozai branch of the tribe, established by Ahmed Shah.\n\nDost Mohammed had two external issues. First, there was his inability to consolidate Herat into his domain, which was still under the rule of Kamran Mirza of the rival Popozai Branch of the Durranis tribe. This was further complicated by Persian attempts to annex Herat. Second, there was the annexation of Peshawar, which had been governed by his brother, Sultan Mohammed Khan, by the Sikhs, under Ranjit Singh. This occured in 1834, while Dost Mohammed was distracted dealing with a failed invasion of Shah Shujah, who was trying to regain the throne.\n\nUnder the leadership of his son, Akbar Khan, in 1836 Dost Mohammed's army tried to win back Peshawar. They defeated the Sikhs, but did not follow-up, and Peshawar remained in Sikh hands.\n\nSince the British backed Ranjit Singh's claims on Peshawar, in 1835 Dost Mohammed turned to the Russians for support. The Russian mission led by Vitkevitch, (encountered by Rawlinson in 1837), was responding to these overtures. It entered Kabul on Christmas Eve, 1837. Despite Dost Mohammed's frustration with the British, he nevertheless had a close personal relationship with Burnes, who was resident in Kabul when the Russian delegation arrived. Dost's relationship with the British and with Burnes was undermined, however, by a communication in January 1838 from Lord Auckland, demanding that he cease treating with the Russians, as well as give up his claims on Peshawar, in favour of the Sikh claims of Ranjit Singh. This all led to the first Anglo-Afghan war (1839-42), and the British deposing Dost Mohammed and reinstating Shah Shujah (1839). [Cit.: 1].\n\nWhen deposed, Dost Mohammed fled north with his son, Akbar Khan. In 1840 he sought asylum in Bokhara, where he was briefly imprisoned. He eluded his captors, and returned to Afghanistan, where he tried to raise an insurrection against the British. After some success in Kohistan, he realized his position, and returned to Kabul, where he surrendered to Macnaghten. He was then given asylum in India. Akbar remained in Afghanistan, and as the British position deteriorated, negotiated their departure. In the process, he personally killed Macnaghten.\n\nAkbar was largely (mainly) responsible for reinstating Dost Mohammed as Amir in 1843, after assassination of Shah Shujah. He held this position until his death in 1863. This was followed by five years of civil unrest, after which his chosen successor, Sher Ali, ascended to the throne.\n\nDost Mohammed's family is extremely complicated, yet it helps to know something about it in order to better understand the history of his coming to power, and the struggles for power during his life and after his death. To assist in this, I have constructed somewhat of a family tree, with links to entries to the various family members.\n\nRefs:\n\noAnon.

Negotiated Treaty of Commerce between the East India Company and the Government of Nepal, l March 1792 for Cornwallis. Appears that treaty, which put a maximum duty of 2½ percent on British goods was negotiated on an ill-founded assumption that the British would provide military support to the Gurkhas in their war with Tibet. A consequence was that the Gurkhas felt that they had been tricked, and the Tibetans thought that the British were supporting their enemy.

(later Sir) Henry Marion\n\nBritish sapper in Bengal Engineers who, during the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-42), served in the British \"Army of the Indus\" under Keane. En-route to Kabul, to restore Shah Shujah as Amir, the army met strong resistance at the fortified town of Ghazni. Not having siege guns, nor sufficient supplies (or time, due to the oncoming winter), to take the fort they had to set charges that would blow up one of the gates. The task was extremely dangerous, not the least because the doors were exposed. Nevertheless, this was undertaken by Durand, in an extreme act of bravery.

Was ahead of his time in terms of technique (he was the inventor of the modern crampon) as well as style. In terms of the latter, he did not subscribe to the practice of the day of always climbing with guides. This attitude, along with other factors, led to a strong animosity between him and the climbing establishment, especially as represented by the Alpine Club. This was especially true once Conway became president in 1902. He had been part of Conway's expedition to the Karakorum in 1892, and they had had conflicts. Depending which story you believe, he left or was kicked off the expedition mid-way. In 1902 led the first climbing expedition to K2, accompanied by his frequent climbing companion, Aleister Crowley. In India, he was detained by officials, apparently at the request of Conway, who was then president of the Alpine Club. Crowley took over temporary leadership of the expedition, and went on to K2. Eckenstein joined the expedition later, after obtaining his release by threatening to reveal the meddling of the Alpine Club to the press. The controversy of the expedition was not over. Another \"memorable\" incident consisted of included Crowley threatening one of his team-mates, Guy Knowles, with a revolver. Two members of the team, the Swiss, Dr. Jules Jacot Guillarmot and the Austrian Dr. V. Wesseley, succeeded in reaching 6523 meters (21,400 ft) on the north-eastern ridge.\n\nRefs:\n\noEckenstein, Oscar (1896). The Karakorams and Kashmir, an Account of a Journey. London: T.

He was both a predecessor of and inspiration for Younghusband. Yet, little is known about him, since the bulk of his travel was undertaken as a British intelligence agent. His work included mapping the regions of his travels, geographically, politically, linguistically and ethnically, as it was as important to understand the social/political as the physical landscape of these regions.\n\nRefs:\n\noMorgan, G.

Hawkish with respect to Russian intent in Central Asia and took an active role in having British officers travel and collect intelligence about Russian activities. Replaced Auckland as Governor General of India in 1842, following the First Afghan War. He had opposed intervention in Afghanistan, but inherited retaliatory and relief missions initiated by Auckland, namely Pollock's expedition over the Khyber to relieve the post in Jalalabad, and Nott's relief of the garrison in Kandahar. Recalled in 1844 and was replaced as Governor General by Lord Hardinge of Lahore, his brother-in-law.\n\nElphinstone, General Mountstuart (1779-1859)\n\nFirst cousin of WIlliam Elphinstone. Arrived in Calcutta from UK in 1796 as member of Bengal Civil Service. In 1808 dispatched as first British emissary to the \"Kingdom of Caubul\" (Afghanistan). His purpose was to build an alliance in defense against a feared invasion of India, from the west, through Persia and Afghanistan, by Napoleonic France. This fear was propeted by French activities in Egypt, and Gardanne's activities in Persia, as well as the recently signed Peace of Tilsit. This mission of Elphinstone was the first official diplomatic involvement of the British in the affairs of the northwest frontier. In February 1809, accompanied by 400 men and 14 officers, met with Shah Shuja in Peshawar, the winter capital of the Afghan court to negotiate an agreement. Proved of little value since in 1810 Shah Shuja was driven from power by his half-brother, Shah Mahmud, before it could be ratified. Despite some references to the contrary, Elphinstone never went to Kabul, nor further into Afghanistan than Peshawar.\n\nElphinstone served as Commissioner for territories annexed to Bombay 1817-19, and as Lieutenant-governor of Bombay (1819-21). Had his advice, based on his insights gained through his mission to Afghanistan, been heeded, there is a chance that the disaster of the First Anglo-Afghan War could have been avoided.

Shelton (who openly opposed him), nor Macnaghten, responded on hearing of the murder of Burnes - who lived in Kabul rather than within the cantonment. This was taken as a sign of weakness, and prompted the Afghans to bolder moves. He led the eventual disastrous retreat from Kabul, continually negotiating with Akbar Khan, despite the British being decimated en route. He was eventually taken as a hostage, and died in captivity.\n\nEverest, Sir George (1790-1866)\n\nAn artillery captain. Appointed Chief Assistant to Lambton on the GTS (1818-23). From 1820-22 was on sick leave, due to malaria, in Cape of Good Hope. On Lambton's death assumed his role as Supervisor of the Great Trigonometric Survey (GTS) (1823-43). At the time of his appointment, the GTS was put under the Surveyor General of India. From 1825-30 was on leave in the UK. Appointed Surveyor General of India (1830-43), uniting the two positions for the first time. Under his direction, the survey of the principal 1,500 mile Great Meridianal Arc ( 78° line of Longitude), started by Lambton in 1802, was completed in 1841. Retired in 1843.
