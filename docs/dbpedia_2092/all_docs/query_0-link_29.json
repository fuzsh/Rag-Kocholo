Hero stones used to be put up at the spot where a great warrior died. For a detailed study of these stones found all over the valley, do check: Sati Stones of Kashmir\n\nAn Evening with Triloke Kaul\n\nThe post from 2012 about evolution of modern painting in Kashmir:\n\nIn 1947, just when geographic borders of Kashmir were getting re-defined, a bunch of artists started on a journey that was to alter the borders of Indian art. Six young artists founded the Progressive Artists Group in Bombay. These were FN Souza, SH Raza, KH Ara, MF Husain, SK Bakre and HA Gade. Around same time three men in Kashmir were also going Progressive mentored by the artists from Bombay group. These were S.N. Butt, Triloke Kaul and P.N. Kachru. When SH Raza reached out to these artists in Kashmir in August 1948, the result was formation of ‘Progressive Artists Association’ in Srinagar in October. It’s first exhibition was held in May 1949 and by October that year the exhibition traveled out to Delhi. The two progressive groups continued to inspire each other for many years to come. Raza famously went on to explore the Tantric symbolism in his paintings inspired by Kashmir. In 1950s, Raza went on to mentor one of the best known progressive artists from Kashmir, G.R. Santosh who too worked on Tantric symbolism.\n\n[can see the work of Bombay group here]\n\nThe post from 2011, giving the work of Kashmir Artist group from late 1940s:\n\nVILLAGE SCENE by Trilok Kaul, 1948\n\nEarlier this year I got married. I married someone related to Triloke Kaul. Kashmiri marriage formalities require that the new couple eat-out with relatives of each other. A meeting with Triloke Kaul is what I looked most forward to. I wanted the complete story of the art movement in Kashmir.\n\nAnd I had something special for him: images from March 1955 issue of Marg: A Magazine of the Arts (Heritage of Kashmir Special Issue) edited by Mulk Raj Anand. The issue carried some of his early works along with that of his colleagues.\n\nIn his room the TV was on Tetris mode. I think he plays. He doesn’t follow news much. Classical India Music plays, he records it and neatly arranges them by the Ragas.\n\nWe talked about the magazine, turns out he helped Mulk Raj Anand edit the particular issue, he even ghost wrote the introduction to the issue He identified the sketches done by him in the issue…most of the sketches of Kashmiri ornaments.\n\nIn the magazine, he saw one of his early work: Ajanta. It was done during his Baroda days. He doesn’t have it with him. I have promised to send a scan to him. He also asked for a work of S.N. Butt.\n\nAnd about that iconic self-portrait. I was happy to see that he had a sense of humor. He indulged me when I suggested that he offer me a pose with the cigarette. He even suggested the proper angle. He told me that back in 1950s when that portrait was exhibited in Jehangir Art Gallery, a photographer did capture him against the painting holding onto a cigarette between the lips.\n\nNo, he doesn’t have most of his old work with him. In 1990, he lost most of his early work to conflict when he was forced to shift to Jammu like other Kashmiri Pandits.\n\nLeft: the deity from his ancestral village talked art.\n\nHe talked art and history. How he mentored Santosh and how young Raza greatly influenced all of them. The names of the Kashmiri artists of earlier generation and the politics of the later years.\n\nHere’s the audio of the conversation (primarily in Kashmiri):\n\nHistory of Progressive Art in Kashmir with Triloke Kaul\n\nvideo link\n\n-0-\n\nA Visit to Kapal Mouchan by Anand Koul, 1909\n\nIn 1911 Volume II issue of Journal and Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Pandit Anand Koul reported discovery of stone inscriptions at the springs at Kapal Mouchan by two priest named Lakshaman Bayu and Vishnu Bayu [‘Boi’ of Kashmiri, for priest or ‘Gor Boi’].\n\nThe stone inscriptions were in Sharda and of much interest because the date on them put them in 18th century, around 1789 when Afghans were governing Kashmir (Timur Shah (1772-1793 A.D.), a period which is now remembered as a period of much persecution. It is interesting that even around that time Sharda survived and Pandits were working on their holy places.\n\nBhushan Kumar Kaul Deambi in his work ‘Sarada and Takari Alphabets: Origin and Development’ (2008) mentions the inscription but reports that this important inscription is now untraceable.\n\n-0-\n\nFinished uploading the paper, you can read it here at archive.org\n\nComplete Chronology of All Kings of Kashmir\n\nKing with his queens and attendants\n\nAwantiswamin temple\n\nA chronological Chart of the History of Kashmir based on Kalhana’s Rajatarangini (1148-1149 A.D.) and other original sources.\n\nBased on a basic list compilation originally done by T.N. Khazanchi for Marg Magazine in 1950s as Superintendent, Archeology and Museum Dept. Srinagar.\n\n[I have appended additional interesting bits, updated with recent researches in the field and my notes on the various eras. Point to note Patañjali’s Mahābhāsya c.150 B.C is the first mention of Kashmir in an Indian source. Mahabarata mentions Kāśmīramandalam, a pilgrimage holy site for sages. Some Nepalese recension of Mahabharata mention Haramukuta (Haramukh) pilgrimage. ]\n\nKalhana’s account opens with Gonanda I (accession assumed Kali Samvat 653, Lankika S. 626) and first book ends with Yudhisthira. The aggregated length of reign for 75 kings has been shown at 2268 years. The account is of course not absolutely reliable from a historical point of view. But Kalhana was working on genuine tradition, text sources (now lost, like work of Padmamihira, who in turn used another lost work of this kind, the Pārthivāvalī of the Mahāvratin Saiva ascetic Helārāja) and some of the kings have a definite historical existence. Book II of Kalhana opens with Pratapaditya I and ends with Sardhimati-Aryaraja. The aggregate length of reigns for this period is 192 years. The third book opens with Meghavahana and ends with Baladitya. The aggregate length of the reigns for this period is 589 years with 300 years ascribed to Ranaditya alone.\n\nMoulvi Ghulam Hasan Shah (1832-1898) in his three volume ‘Tarikh-i- Hasan’ is only source for the ‘lost’ kings of Kashmir and based on an old Rajatarangini written by one Pandit Ratnakar, called Ratanakar Purana and was found by one Praja Pandit.\n\nThe Lost Kings:\n\n1.

Bhawant\n\nSon of Biram Chandra and Chakra Rani.\n\nReign lasted 14 years\n\nThis ends the reign of lost kings of Kashmir (complied by Pandit Anand Koul based on writing of Hasan Shah, all catagorised as unverifiable.)\n\nThe present [definitive] list opens with Asoka, since his is the first name of the rulers of Kashmir which has a genuine historical basis. With the accession of Durlabhavardhana (founder of Karkota dynasty and successor of Baladitya) the genuine historical account of Kalhana begins [annals of the Tang dynasty of China have indicated that his time-line for the Karkota kings needs to be pushed forward by about 25 years].\n\n48. Asoka [1st century BCE/CE]\n\nKalhana opens his account with fifty two ‘lost kings’ of Kashmir out of which 17 names were recovered from Nilamatapurana, Helaraja and Chavillakara. The first name is that of Gonanada I. Since the account is historically untenable, the reference to this period is usually eschewed. The sway of Asoka over Kashmir is doubtless established, even though the sites mentioned do not exist now. Asoka according to Kalhana is son of Sacinara’s grand-uncle and great grandson of Sakuni.\n\nDuring Asoka’s time Viharas and Stupas at Suskaletra and Vitastatra came up. Foundation of Srinagari, the old capital known as Pandrethan was setup. Resuscitation of Saiva Shrine at Vijayeshvara. Asokesvara temples at Vijayeshvara. [The source of Ashoka/Jalauka story for Kalhana is the lost history of Chavillākara]\n\n49. Jalanka [Jalauka]\n\nSupposed son of Asoka and an unnamed woman atop Shankracharya hill as a boon from Bhūteśvara. According to Cunningham the temple of Shankracharya was built by Jalanka but not supported by architectural evidence.\n\nBuilt the Agrahara at the hamlet of Varabala (Baravul).\n\nHis queen Isanadevi, installed circles of mothers [mātṛcakra] in the regions that formed the gateways of the kingdom of Kashmir. Royal preceptor was Avadhūta, a tantric master. The king expelled foreigners from Kashmir, settled people of four castes in the valley. Conquered Kanyakubja and other regions of north India.\n\n50. Damodara III\n\nThe present airport is located on Damodar Udar.\n\n51. Huska [mentioned in Kharoshthi inscriptions] 52. Juska. Sten Konow in 1929 based on Kharoshthi inscriptions held him same as Vasishka. According to Konow: Vasishka and Huvishka are mentioned as successors of Kanishka. To explain this, he backs up with theory of Hemchandra Raychaudhuri about two Kanishka [I, the famous one], is followed by Vasishka, his brother Huvishka, and Kanishka II, son of Vasishka, is the ruler of Kashmir mentioned by Kalhana. Which might explain why the “famous” inscriptions that Kashmiri scholars have been looking for in Kashmir may not exit in Kashmir. As the events described by Kalhana are actually of Kanishka I. According to Tibetan sources the council took place in Jalandhara.\n\nNow accepted chronology based on inscriptions and coins is:\n\nVima Kadphises 113-127 CE Kanishka I 127-151 CE Huvishka 151-190 CE Vasudeva I 190-230 CE Kanishka II 230-247 CE\n\nDr Stein identified Chachh with Chuksha, west of the city of Taxila. Taxila was its capital.\n\nTaxila silver vase inscription mentions Jihonika [], the satrap of Chachh, son of ‘Manigula’. His coins however mostly found in Kashmir and Hazara.\n\n53. Kanishka [2nd century (120-144)]\n\nHis capital at Peshawar [where was found Kanishka casket underneath Kanishka stupa, once a marvel of India, being the tallest building even in 7th century]. Kalhana called them Turushkas i.e. Turks. Later Turk kings of Gandhara claim Kanishka as their ancestor. Buddhism at its peak in Kashmir. According to the uniform Buddhist tradition Kaniska held the 3rd 4th great Council of the Church in Kashmir under Nagarjuna (said to be near the modern site of Harwan). Hiuen Tsiang ( 602 – 664 A.D.) found local traditions regarding Kaniska fully alive in the country during his visit to Nagarjina in Kashmir during the time of Kaniska. Juska has not been identified.\n\nFounding of towns of Kaniskapura, Huskapura and Juskapura (Kanispor, Uskura and Zukur).\n\nKanishka of Gandhara arrived in Kashmir (about 400 years after the death of Buddhas) to dispose off the Kritya* kings who had abandoned Buddhism and fallen back to older traditions. After he leaves. Kritiyas again gain power. According to Konow a Tibetan text speaks of a King Kanika, who arrived from Khotan to conquer.\n\n*Kritiyas, at the time was used contemptuously to mean unclear/lowborn/pigs/demons who dig out corpses/”serfs”-slaves bought. In the story of these people we find for first time hatred for a group of people in Kashmir, for their foreign origin, for their religious practices and for their rise to power. A hatred coming from outside.\n\nAfter about 50 years post death of Buddha (around 450 BC), monk Madhyantika arrives in Kashmir to bring it into the domain of Dharma. He brings along with him Manushakritya, “householders” (brahmins) slaves to inhibit and serve the place. These people are referred as Kritiyas in Buddhist texts. They become the rulers of Kashmir after the death of Madhyantika. Native Naga worship mixes with Brahminism. They were removed from power by Kanishka.\n\nHiuen Tsiang mentions that in around 280 A.D (600 years after death of Buddha) Sakya race king of Himatala [sue-shan-hai/under the snowy mountain] of Tukhara [Indo-Scythians of Central Asia, Bactria, his origin placed in Shakya territory. Driven out of there during Buddha’s time by King Virudhaka.] with warriors came in disguise of traders to kill the Kritya king of Kashmir and re-establish Dharma again. After beheading the king in court, he hands over the country to monks and leaves. Krityas come to hate the Dharma all the more as more than once they had been defeated.\n\n54. Abhimanyu I\n\nAnti Buddhist trend in Kashmir. The traditional cult as represented in Nilamata-purana restored. However, Buddha mentioned as an avatar of Vishnu in Nilamata and celebrated. People practice Naga+brahminical+Buddhist practices.\n\nPatanjali’s Mahabhasya introduced in Kashmir by Chanda. Circa 100 B.C.\n\n55. Gonanda III\n\n56. Vibhisana I\n\n57. Indrajit\n\n58. Ravana\n\n59. Vibhisana II\n\nRestoration of Naga cult and land recovery.\n\n60. Nara [AD. 89-99]\n\nAlso known as “Kimnara”. Founded Narapura (on bank of Vitasta). Buddhism in decline.\n\nNara’s wife is seduced and taken by a Buddhist sramana. Nara responds by destroying Viharas and giving away Buddhist vihara lands to Brahmin Mathas. [Posssibly the era when Bijbihara went into Brahminical fold]\n\nFantastical tale of Naga Susrava destroying Narapura using thunderbolts as the king coveted Naga’s daughter Chandraleka married to a Brahmin. Susrava’s sister Ramani also drops rocks. The people who have taken refuge in Chakrin Vishnu temple (at Chakdhar mound in Bijbihara) are all killed. Vitasta filled with blood and flesh (in words of Kalhana like the marks on Peacock’s tail). [The events possibly allude to destruction of the city by earthquake]\n\nKalhana also tells the story of Brahmin Vishakha saving Naga’s from famine by tricking a māntrika (watchman) who keep watch over the crops. Hail/Rains is supposed to be form of Nagas. In Buddhist origin tales of Kashmir, Naga king Araval tries to defeat monk Madhyantika using hail, storm and thunder.\n\n61. Siddha\n\nSon of Nara. In the end, flew to heaven.\n\n62. Utplaksa\n\n63. Hiranyaksa\n\n64. Hiranyakula\n\nFounded Hiranyapura (modern Ranyil)\n\n65. Vasukula\n\n66. Mihirakula\n\nIt is assumed Kalhana shows him to be 1200 years earlier than his real date. His father Tormana shows up later in Kalhana’s Rajatarangini. It is now understood that there were two Tormana. In list of Alchon Huns\n\nMihirakula [c.515–540] is proceeded by a Tormana [c.490–515] and followed by a Tormana [c.530–570, father of Parvasena, founder of present Srinagar]. This Tormana was brother of Hiranyakula [?].\n\nKalhana claims he is known as Trikotihan, the killer of 3 crores. He killed hundreds of elephants on the ancient pass of Pirpantsal for fun.\n\n[Probably around 493 A.D. based on his encounter with Baladitya of Gupta Empire based on writing of Hiuen Tsang]\n\nStory of Mihirkula, at least one version of it, is similar to the story of Rincana. Mihirkula wanted to be buddhist (his father was Jain according to some Jain text )…but was offended by the monks. He turned anti- buddhist. Just like story of Rincana, the source of the tale is the party which apparently refused conversion. There is at least 1 Buddhist text that claims Mihirkula converted to buddhism…impressed by self-sacrifice of lowly monk who was send to convert him. In Chinese travelogue we read that brahmins of Kashmir were not happy with activities of Mihirkula as they themselves were into sutras and respected Buddhism. Kalhana’s testimony is towards that. He say’s during that era Kashmir was overrun by Mlecchas [refers to speaker of foreign tongues]. We see Kalhana look down upon the Brahmins from Gandhara that the king introduced in Kashmir [around Bijbehara].\n\nBühler held that there were two Toramānas and Mihirakulas. Mihirkula’s name is found in Gwalior inscription of Mihirakula at a Sun temple. It was discovered in 1861 by Alexander Cunningham. “Mihar” means Sun. Kalhana mentions he built a temple in Kashmir, “Mihiresvara”, Stein assumes it to be a Shiva temple. Alchon Huns practice a mix for solar worship (common in Iran) and worship Kushan deity Oesho, out of which start evolving concept of Shiva as it is now understood.\n\nChinese monk Song Yun is said to have met a Hun king in his army camp in c.520 at Talagang near salt range, Jhelum valley. The king is assumed to have been Mihirakula. He writes that Huns were there to control the salt trade of Kashmiris.\n\n67. Baka.\n\nSon of Mihirakula\n\nFirst proper mention in Rajatarangini of Yoginis and tantric practice:\n\nBaka attracted by a yoginī called Bhaṭṭā, becomes a sacrificial victim offered to a circle of goddesses (devīcakra). The yoginī acquires supernatural powers and flies up into the sky. At the end of the story, it is mentioned that the footprints of the yoginī, a god named Śatakapāleśa [the Lord of a Hundred Skulls] and the circle of mothers provide a recollection of this event in the monastery (maṭha) of Kherī, south of the Viśokå River (Veśau).\n\n68. Ksitinanda\n\n69. Vasunandra\n\nWrote a handbook on Erotics\n\n70. Nara II\n\n71. Aksa\n\nSon of Vasunanda\n\nAksavala (modern Acchabal) founded by Aksa\n\n72. Gopaditya\n\nSon of Aksa\n\nTemple of Jyesthesvara on Gopadri said to be built by him.\n\n73. Gokarna\n\n74. Khinkhila Narendraditya [c.430–490]\n\nAlchon Hun King. In coins represented as “Deva Sahi Khingila”. His name found on the base of a statue of Vinayaka found in Kabul in Proto-Sharda inscription. Sharda script taking birth.\n\nThese royals practice artificial cranial deformation. The head is artificially elongated, propably to show their royal status.\n\n75. Pratapaditya I\n\nThe first king of Book II of Rajatarangini. Unconnected with Gonanda dynasty. Supposed to have been a relative of King Vikramaditya. Perhaps Harsa Vikramaditya of Ujjain is indicated. Kashmir experiences first instance of a prosperity in its early history.\n\n76. Jalankas\n\nPossible that Kalhana (or his source) in fact was talking about a Hephthalite king [White Huns of Central Asia, now understood to be actually Alchon Hun and not Hephthalite]. In Sanskrit the word means “leech”. It is possible the whole story was a way to establish Alchon king’s claim over the land by linking himself to Ashoka.\n\nIn Talagan copper scroll in Sanskrit[discovered in 2006, Talagan is supposed to region in Bactria, east of Kunduz in northern Afghanistan. or better it may be modern town of Talagang in Punjab [Pakistan], north of the Salt Range], we find name of Alchon Hun Kings Khingila, Toramana, Javukha, and Mehama (who was reigning at the time the scroll was made 493/94) as donors to a Buddhist reliquary stupa in a place called Sardiysa in Talagan. They were obviously at easy with Buddhism. Based on the finding, the widely accepted theory that White Huns finished Buddhism in Gandhara is now questioned. Hans T. Bakker, indologist assumes Sardiysa to be the famous Sharda in Neelum valley. [A Buddhist Foundation in Śārdīysa, 2018]. According to him, the place name Sharda predates the goddess Sharda if this scroll is considered to be about Sharda.\n\nJavukha (c.490) “son of Sadavikha” is assumed to have reigned in the Swat Valley.\n\n77. His son Tunjina I\n\nA great famine came.\n\n78. Vijaya\n\nBelonged to a different family.\n\nFounded town of Vijayesvara (modern Bijibehara)\n\nEarliest sculpture Brahminical sculptures done in Gandhara + Sasanian style found at Bijibehara belong to 4th-5th century.\n\n79. Jayandra\n\n80. Sardhimati Aryaraja [Sandhimat]\n\nAryaraja was the minster of Jayendra and was cruelly put to death but miraculously restored to life by Yoginis. In a burial ground Yoginis put his bones together in front of his Guru and revive him from dead. Sandhimat enjoys himself with the intoxicated Yoginis as a ‘leader of their circle’ (cakranāyaka), rituals as told in tantric texts. He is elected King.\n\nSandhimati Aryaraja seems to have figured in Kashmir tradition as the beau-ideal, a royal devotee. Abdicated and lived as a recuse at Siva-Bhutesa.\n\n81. Megavahana\n\n[Around 5th century A.D.]\n\nBook II Closes with Aryaraja’s abdication. Restoration of Gonand’s family with Megavahana. Patron of Buddhism. Said to have come from Gandhara.\n\n[ His wife Amrtaprabha. Daughter of King Pragyotisa of Bhutan. Sent to Kashmir with her Guru Stonpa. Built Amrtabhva Vihar. Mentioned in writings of Ou-kong, Chinese pilgrim who visited Kashmir during the years 759-763 A.D]\n\nKalhana tells a tale with Buddhist elements of compassion, a tale told about some other legendary kings too:\n\nKing Meghavāhana sees a barbarian (śabara/kirāta) about to\n\nkill a man in front of a Caṇḍikā/Cāmuṇḍā temple. The barbarian\n\nwants to offer the victim to save his son from dying. The king\n\nvolunteers to become the victim and is about to cut his own head off,\n\nwhen Varuṇa appears and saves him. The king had to go through this\n\nordeal because of his cruel ancestor, Mihirakula, although he was\n\ncompassionate himself.\n\nStories from Kalhana in this period hint at end of human sacrifice by Meghavāhana.\n\n82. Sreshthasena (also known as Pravarasena I and Tunjina II)\n\nSacred structures at Puranadhisthana (Modern Pandrethan) came up. Siva temple of Pravaresvara which existed during Kalhana’s time.\n\n83. Hiranya, 84. Tormana (II) [c.530–570]\n\nNo independent evidence regarding the historical existence of Hiranya. Tormana represented as his younger brother. Name of Tormana on a species of Kashmir copper coins, large quantities of which have been found. Evidence of characters suggests 5th and 6th century A.D. Based on that earlier experts used to surmise that he is identical with the Epthalite king Tormana, the father of Mihirkula. And thus assumed that in Kalhana’s chronology, father has been placed some 700 years after the son. Or perhaps, there was different Tormana in Kashmir [we now know that there were 2 Tormana]. Because of 2 Tormanas the chronology of Kalhana about Alchon Hun rulers gets jumbled.\n\n85. Matrgupta\n\nThe story of Kalhana represents Matrgupta as a poor poet who has sought the court og king Harsa, Vikramaditya of Ujjayni. This king sends him a letter directing the minister of Kashmir to install him on the throne. Abdicates subsequently in favor of Pravarasena II [Alchon king]. Founded the temple of Matrguptasvamin. During his time flourished Mentha the writer of Hayagrivadha.\n\n86. Pravarasena II\n\n[c.530–590, Late 6th century]\n\nAuthentic historical data exists for Pravarsena. Represented as son of Tormana who was on a pilgrimage when Matrgupta was crowned. Supposed to have conquered Gujrat. Contemporary of Siladitya who was on the throne of Malava in 580 A.D. as narrated by Hiuen Tsiang. This is confirmed by the foundation of Pravarpura also recorded by Hiuen Tsiang. Rare specimen of his coins exist both in gold and silver.\n\nHe founded the Pravarsenapura or Pravarpura (Modern Srinagar) around Hari Parbat. He plans as Shiva temple Pravareśvarain at Pravarapura, but miraculously a Vishnu image appears at the place, he names it Jayasvāmin after the architect of the temple.\n\nA Magical Katha told:\n\nAfter death of his father Pravarsena meets a holy man, a pāśupata order siddha named Aśvapāda on the mountain of Śrīparvata. Pravarpura is promised kingship by Shiva. The story has elements of the puranic legend of Upamanyu. Pravarsena becomes king.\n\nWhen the King was looking for a site to build his city, one night he arrived at a river and on the other side of the river he could see the ghat where the dead used to be set afire. While the king stood watching burning pyres, he heard a laughter and a Rakshasa appeared with his arms raised, hands-up. The king was afraid but the Rakshasa asked the King to look beyond his appearance and manners. He was here to offer him his service, provided the King crossed over to his side like the king Vikramaditya. Saying so, the Rakshasa extended his arm in friendship, the hand became a bridge. The King took out a blade, a Kshurika and cut steps into the bridge so that he could cross over. On reaching the other side, the Rakshasa threw a measuring tape in the air, away from the spot, and told the King to build his city where he finds this measuring tape in the morning. And then the Rakshasa disappeared. Next morning King found the thread at village Sharitaka, the seat of Goddess Sharika looked over by Yaksha Atta, the Lord of Watchtower.\n\nTowards the end of Pravarasena’s life Aśvapāda send a brahmin messenger to the king informing him that his time is up. Pravarasena, obeying God’s command, flies up in the sky to join his Lord, making a hole in the ceiling of the Pravareśvara temple. [Here Kalhana is probably explaining the story associated with the hole in the ceiling of Pravaresvara temple]. Stein in 1940 gives the probable location of the temple as Bahauddin Shrine of Srinagar based on the ruined temple base earlier documented at the place. The base design of the temple later became the model for other Kashmiri temples like Martanda.\n\nIn around 571 AD, Muhammad, the prophet of Islam is born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia\n\n87. Yudhisthira II\n\nFounded Skandabhavanavihara (modern Khandabhavana)\n\n88. Lakhana, 89. Narendraditya\n\nPerhaps may be connected to Udayaditya who represents himself as ‘Raja Lakhana Udayaditya’ on his coins – which is a coin of the Epthalite type.\n\n90. Ranaditya [Around 6th century]\n\nSon of Yudhisthira II and Younger brother of Lahkhana. Supposed to have ruled for 300 years. Part of many magical tales. Example:\n\nRanaditya in previous birth fell in love with goddess Bhramaravāsinī who lived on the Vindhya mountain. Goddess is reborn as Raṇārambhā and marries Ranaditya while retaining her godly supernatural powers. She placed her own double next to her husband every night and flew out herself in the form of a bee [“Bhramara” in sanskrit is “Bee” and Bees are usually associated with Vindhyavasini goddess, possibly due to extensive bee population in forests of Vindhya. On such temple still stands. ]. The same goddess gave her husband the mantra of Hāṭakeśvara, which helped him to descend to the underworld and enjoy himself there for many years—a superhuman achievement which is called pātālasiddhi in many tantric texts.\n\nHere’s it seems Kalhana is using Kathāsaritsāgara as the source which tells many such tales.\n\nAlso, builder of the earliest Vaishnavite Shrine in Kashmir. He build two Shiva temples, but due to supernatural powers of his wife, one of the temple becomes a Vishnu temple after the image in the temple miraculously changes.\n\n91. Vikramaditya.\n\nSon of Ranaditya\n\n92. Baladitya.\n\nBrother and successor of Vikramaditya. Last king of Gonanda’s race. Married his daughter Ananglekha to Durlabhavardhana, who found the Karkota dynasty.\n\nKarkota Dynasty\n\n93. Dwilabhavardhan (600- 636 A.D.)\n\nFounder of Karkota dynasty. Karkota name coming from name of a mythical Naga serpent deity (name also mentioned in Nilamata). Durlabhavardhana is said to have been the son of Naga. Thus this is considered to be the start of the rule of Naga Karkota dynasty. Coins show him as “Durlabhadeva”. We have also possibly a reference to Dwilabhavardhana in a notice of the Chinese annals, which mention Tu-lo-pa as a king of India who controlled the route from China to Ki-pin i.e. the Kabul valley somewhere between 629-647. Hiuen Tsiang visits Kashmir (631-633) during his reign. He distinctly records that Taksasila (Taxila, now in Rawalpindi district Punjab of Pakistan) east of Indus (already in ruins in Tsaing time ), Ursaor Hazara, Simhapura or the Salt range with smaller hill-states of Rajapuri and Parnotsa (modern Punch), had no independent rulers, but was tributary to Kashmir. Vaisnavism marks a presence in Kashmir among royals. Only one temple of Shiva built/renovated by this dynasty.\n\nHiuen Tsiang ( 602 – 664 A.D.) mentions that in his time neighbouring kings held the Kashmiri Nagas in scorn, they refused alliance with them. He adds that they even called them, Kilito, translated as Kritya. He says that Kashmir at the time was again in control run of ki-li-ti / Kritiyas and thus Dharma (Buddhism) was in decline.\n\n94. Pratapaditya II/Durlabhaka ( 636-686 A.D.)\n\nBuilt the temple and town of Pratappura (modern Tapar, 22 miles west of Srinagar)\n\n95. Candrapida/Vajraditya (686-695 A.D.)\n\nEldest son of Pratapaditya II. Founded shrines of Tribhuvanasvamin, Prakasikavihara, Gambhiraswamin and Chalitasvamin. He has been identified with king Tchentolo-lopo-li mentioned in the Chinese Annals as ruling Kashmir A.D. 713, and again in 720 A.D. This contradicts Kalhana’s account who places him in A.D. 686-695. Only from 855 A.D. are Kalhana’s dates strictly correct. Margin of error in Kalhana dates by 25 years. Candrapida worried about Arab advance of Muhammad Qasim who occupied Sindh and lower Punjab around 711 and 713. Candrapida sought help from China, none arrived. Qasim was recalled to Damascus by Caliph Sulaiman. Arab invasion was averted. In around 712 AD, just when Caliphate forces conquered Sindh, a Syrian refugee named Hanim/Hamim arrives in Kashmir. Considered first muslim in Kashmir. Sindh ruler Raja Dahir Sen’ son Jaisya took refuge in Kashmir and Hanim arrived with him. After Jaisya died, Hanim took over his dependency.\n\n96. Tarapida (695 -699 A.D.)\n\nRuled for only 4 years. Died of black magic.\n\n97. Lalitaditya Muktapida\n\nYoungest son of Pratapaditya II. Most important ruler of the Hindu Period. The annals of Tang dynasty know Muktapida, under the name of Mu-to-pi, as the king of Kashmir who sent an embassy to the Chinese court during the reign of the Emperor Hiuen Tsung (A.D. 713-755), and after the first Chinese expedition against Baltistan which occurred sometime between A.D. 736-747. Lalitaditya a great conqueror. In the reign of Caliph Hisham (724-43) the Arabs of Sindh under governor Junaid again threaten Kashmir but are defeated by Lalitaditya. Lalitaditya also defeats Yasovarman of Kanauj. Kalhana mentions Bhavabhuti and Vakaoatiraja among the poet of Yasovarman’s court. Territories of Jalandhara and Lohar (Present Kangra and Punch), held by Lalitaditya’s feudatories. Sahi princes as well under his tutelage. Extension towards Yamuna. Kalhana shows Lalitaditya as having conquered the whole of India which is not historically corroborated. Tokharistan conquered. Tibetans subdued. Conquest over Dards. Buddhism and Hinduism flourish equally under him. Died on a central Asian expedition.\n\nLalitāditya built a new stone temple to house the ancient Śiva Jyestheśvara at the site of Śiva Bhūteśvara to clear his debt to the latter incurred when he had appropriated the wealth of this temple to ﬁnance his military campaigns. The only Shiva temple by Karkota dynasty.\n\nJayanta Bhatta wrote Nayanamanjari. He hold the view: “any scripture can be accepted as valid, if\n\n(in addition to some other conditions) it does not cause abhorrence\n\nor fear among people (yebhyo nodvijate janaḥ).”\n\nKashmir got Martanda Temple, Temples, Chaityas and Viharas at Parihaspura (modern Paraspor). Temple and Vihara at Uskura (ancient Huvishapura). Towns of Parihasapura, Lalitapura (modern Letapor) and Parnotsa (modern Punch).\n\n98. Kuvalayapida 99. Vajraditya-Bappiyaka 100. Prthivyapida 101. Samgramapida I (736-751 A.D.)\n\nKuvalayapida, eldest son of Lalitaditya. Ruled for 1 year only and turned an asceti practicing quietism (śama). Bappiyaka was younger son of Lalitaditya through another queen, and ruled for 7 years. Unsteady rule. The last two mentioned were his sons who ruled for short period.\n\n102. Jayapida (751-782 A.D.)\n\nYoungest son of Bappiyaka. Founded Jayapur – Andrakor town. His coins found in sufficient quantity. Credited by Kalhana as ‘digvijaya’ but no corroboration of his conquests. Usurpation of throne by Jaffa. Jayapida was a patron of literary men.\n\nInvited engineers from Sri Lanka to help build water reservoirs. He most famous work was water fort named Dvaravati (named after Krishna’s Dwarika), remains of which are now Bahirkut near Sumbal (Andarkut thought to be by Cunningham, but discovered to be Bahirkut by Buhler)\n\nVamana Bhatta wrote Kavyalamkaravrtti. Damodar gupta wrote Kuttanimata (have extensive description of Kashmiri art and culture around that time). Ksirasvamin wrote grammatical treaties and commentary on Amarkosa. Bhatta Udbhata wrote Alamkarasatra. Manoratha got quoted in Subhasitavali. Besides there were Thakkiya, Sankhadanta, Cataka and Sandhimat.\n\n103. Lalitapida (782 -794 A.D.)\n\nSon and successor of Jayapida. Neither of him nor of any other later Karkotas any coins have been found.\n\n104. Samgramapida II (794 -801 A.D.)\n\nHalf brother of Lalitapida. Also known as Prthivyapida.\n\n105. Cipattajayapida – Brhaspati (801 -813 A.D.)\n\nBrhaspati was son of Lalitapida through Jayadevi, a concubine of low origins. Since the king was a child, royal power fell into the hands of his maternal uncles, Padma, Utpala, Kalyana, Mamma and Dharma who built various structures like: Utpalasvamin (Temple of Vishnu), Padmasvamin (Temple of Vishnu), town of Padmapura (modern Pampor), Dharmasvamin (temple of Vishnu), Kalyanasvamin and Mammasvamin beside Utpalapura (modern Kakpor)\n\nDuring his reign Rudrat wrote Srngartilaka. Also, during this time Vasugupta, founder of Saivim in Kashmir wrote Spanda Karika (“The Karikas on Vibration,”). Tradition has it that Sivasutras were revealed to Vasugupta in a dream.\n\n106. Ajitapida (813-850 A.D.)\n\nGrandson of Vajraditya-Bappiyaka whom Utpala put on the throne by armed force after Brhaspati’s death. Mamma assumes supreme power.\n\n107. Anangapida (850 -853 A.D.)\n\nSon of Singramapida II. Raised to throne by Mamma after defeating his brother Utpala.\n\n108. Utapalapida (853 -855 A.D.)\n\nSon of Ajitapida. Raised to the throne by Sukhavarman, son of Utpala who led a successful rebellion. Temple of Ratnasvamin was built during this era.\n\nEnd of Karkota Dynasty. Start of Utpala dynasty.\n\n109. Avanti Varman (855 -883 A.D.)\n\nSon of Sukhavarman who was son of Utpala. Most peaceful reign in the history of Kashmir. Patronage of arts and literature. Period of great internal recovery. First soil sample survey by Suyya who was a great Engineer and regulated the cource of Vitasta through great skill. Kashmir saved from floods for many centuries owing to the great efforts of Suyya. Prosperity in Kashmir. First reference to Damars or feudal lords of Kalhana. They prove of great trouble subsequently. Rudrata writes Kavyalankara, in it once of the earliest reference to chess in India, and reference to Knight’s tour, a mathematical problem in which a knight on a chessboard moves such that it visits every square exactly once.\n\nMinister Sura has the chief of the ḍāmaras killed in a temple. The king worships Bhūteśa in a nearby temple while his minister lures the ḍāmaras to the temple of Bhairava and the mothers. He then decapitates the chief ḍāmara in front of Bhairava and throws the body into a nearby water tank. Damara (a feudal land-owner with private armies that a King could hire) was named Dhanva (Avantivarma was earlier allies with this Damara) and killed for appropriating temple endowment (agrahara) in the Lahara District [Lar, presently known as Loharin in Poonch district. Gagangir being the main fort]. Modern Kashmiri surname Dar (and possible Dhar) come from title Damara.\n\nThe story is interesting becuase Minister Sura was a Saiva follower while the King was a follower Vishnu. For his powerful minister’s sake the king went along Saiva path (outwardly), only in his dying moments did he confess to Sura that in his heart he was a follower of Vishnu. During this era, Pañcarātra form of Vaisnavism popular in Kashmir, temples built on its concepts.\n\nIn A.D. 732 or 733 King Lalitāditya borrowed from the Bhūteśa Temple ten million dirinaras to finance an expedition to the south. Stein identified the temple at Vangath village, Narnag spring ruins on way to Mount Harmukha.\n\nDuring his reign Kashmir got: town of Avantipura (modern Vantipur), Surapura (modern Hurapur), Suyyapura (Sopore). Temple of Samarsvamin, temples at Avantipur and structures at Wangath.\n\nDuring this era Sivasvamin wrote Kapphanabhyudaya, Somananda wrote Sivadrsti, Utpaladeva wrote Pratyabhejna, Anandavardhana wrote Dhvanyaloka and Dersataka, Ratnakara wrote Haravijaya, Bhatta Kallata [ mentioned by Kalhana] wrote Spanda Sarvasva and works of Muktakana who was later quoted by Ksemendra.\n\nKalhana’s chronicle now become all the more closer to verifiable history, easily cross verifiable with other works.\n\nJñnanetra (ca. 850-900, also known as Sivanandanatha) starts the Krama system in Uddiyana(now in Pakistan). This Saiva- Shakta stream popular in Kashmir places Kali as the central deity. Jñnanetra claims to have learnt it from Yoginis. The system is famous for having Saiva female gurus.\n\nTheory of Dhvani or suggestion in literary criticism propounded by Anandavardhana.\n\nRudrata writes Kavyalankara, in it once of the earliest reference to chess in India, and reference to Knight’s tour, a mathematical problem in which a knight on a chessboard moves such that it visits every square exactly once.\n\n110. Sainkara Varman (883 -902 A.D.)\n\nSon of Avanti Varman. Spent a lot of time on foreign expeditions. Supposed to have led 9 lakh foot soldiers. Darvabhisara reconquered. Prithvicandra, ruler of Trigarta subdued. Victory over Alakhana, the ruler of Gurjara (modern Gujrat in W. Punjab). Lalliyasahi of Udbhanda helps Alakhana, but is subdued. Excessive fiscal exactions. Begar (forced labor) in great vogue. Parihaspura town robbed of material for laying out Pattana. Reference to preparation of woollen clothes at Pattana. Died in Hazara.\n\nBuilt the town of Sanikarapura later called Pattana (modern Patan). Temples of Sanikaragaurisa and Sugandhesa temples at Pattam. Also, Ratnavardhanesa temple.\n\n111. Gopalavarman (902 -904 A.D.)\n\nSon of Sainkara Varman. Ruled under the guardianship of his mother Sugandha, since he was too young. Murdered though machinations of Prabhakaradeva, paramour of Sugandha.\n\n112. Sugandha (904 -906 A.D.)\n\nFounded town Gopalapura and temple of Gopalakesava. Sugandha assumes power after the death of her son. Tantrins, a military caste come into power. Their rebellion puts Partha on throne.\n\n113. Partha (906 -921 A.D.)\n\nChild-son of Birjitavarman who descended from Suravarman, half brother of Avantivarman. Sugandha executed. Partha dethroned by Tantrins in favour of his father.\n\nInduraja wrote Kavyalankara\n\n114. Nirjitavarma (921 -923 A.D.)\n\n115. Cakravarman (923 -933 A.D.)\n\nCakravarman was child son of Nirjitavarma. Tantrins demand huge sum as such he is deposed.\n\n116. Suravarman I (933 -934 A.D.)\n\nHalf brother of Cakravarman. He too deposed because he could not pay adequate sums to Tantrins.\n\n117. Sambhuvardhana (935 -936 A.D.)\n\nCrown sold to minister Sambhuvardhana.\n\nCakravarman (restored, 936 -937 A.D.)\n\nDamars support Cakravarman and defeat Tantrins. Cakravarman murdered by Damars. Cakravarman is assassinated after he becomes infatuated with the daughters of the ḍomba singer, Raṅga. Asks minister to wear the cloth stained with menstrual stains of śvapākas [outcaste] women.\n\nKalhaṇa sarcastically say’s: ‘Robbers for ministers, a ḍomba for queen and ḍombas for friends: what wonder of the world was there that did not belong to king Cakravarman?’\n\n118. Unmattavanti (937 -939 A.D.)\n\nHe was another son of Partha. Senseless cruelty and wanton license. Destroys his relatives under the influence of Parvagupta, his minister. Partha murdered.\n\n119. Survarman II (939 A.D.)\n\nLast king of Utpala dynasty. Supposed to be the son of Unmattavanti. Ruled only for a few days.\n\n120. Yasaskara (939 -948 A.D.)\n\nSon of Prabhakaradeva, Sughandha’s paramour. Yasaskara elected king by an assembly of Brahmins.\n\nIn an episode King Yaśaskara is served by outcastes who eat what is left by ḍombas and makes a veśyā his first concubine, without knowing that she is also seeing a watchman. Kalhana looks down upon such practices.\n\nKayyata writes Laghuvrtti.\n\nIn the story of Yasaskara, Kalhana mentions how the religious practices of Gurus were changing (for the worse) and how the people were changing with it.\n\n“Earlier]Brahmin preceptors did not drink wine while chanting\n\nthe Sāmaveda, and ascetics did not take wives, children,\n\ncattle and corn.\n\nIgnorant gurus, who perform ritual worship with fish and\n\ncakes, did not revise philosophical and scriptural\n\nstatements in their own writings\n\nHousewives did not figure as deities during the initiation\n\nof gurus, denying their husbands’ virtue and dignity by\n\nthe shaking of their heads / bringing their husbands,\n\nvirtues and glory to contempt by shaking their heads.]”\n\nThe last line probably alludes to the KP ritual that still survives in which post marriage, if there is any Yagnopavit event in the family, new wife sits in her husband’s lap, a mulberry stick is touched ritually to left and right ear of the bride to the chanting of shlokas by the guru. All the other members of the family repeat the same with their wife. The whole ritual is collective and women are very central to these initiation rituals. As we can see, Kalhana did not approve of these practices that saw a change in a woman’s position.\n\nIronically, what Kalhana laments back then, is now part of culture of Kashmiri Pandits that they remember nostalgically and try to retain. There are some now who even perform Yagnopavit for their daughters.\n\n121. Sangramadeva (948 -949 A.D.)\n\n122. Parvagupta (949 -950 A.D.)\n\nA descendent of a family of clerks. Murders Sangramadeva and assumes power.\n\n123. Ksemagupta (950-958 A.D.)\n\nSon and successor of Parvagupta. Married lame Didda, grand-daughter of Bhimadeva, Shahi ruler of Kabul. Because the queen was the actual ruler, the coins carried her name too, the King was known with moniker, Didda-ksema. In the coins he is prefixed with ‘Di’ which stands for queen. Ksemagupta’s union with Didda brought Kashmir under the rule of the Lohara family which continued to rule Kashmir as well as its original home down to the times of Kalhana and later.\n\nBuilt temple of Ksemagaurisvara and Bhimakesava (modern Bumazur)\n\n124. Abhimanyu II (958-972 A.D.)\n\nSon of Ksemagupta. Didda assumes guardianship, since he was very young. Rebellions are mercilessly squashed.\n\n125. Nandigupta (972-973 A.D.)\n\nWas the young son of Abhimanyu. Regency of Didda continued. Great building activities. Nandigupta murdered by connivance of Didda.\n\nBuilding activities: Abhymanyusvamin, Abhimanyupura, Diddasvamin, Diddapura Kainkanapura and Sinihasvamin.\n\n126. Tribhuvana (973-975 A.D.)\n\nTribhuvana, another grandson also murdered.\n\n127. Bhimagupta (975-980 /1 A.D.)\n\nGrandson of Didda. Tunga, a Khasa from Parnotsa becomes Didda’s Paramour. Bhimagupta put to death by torture by Didda.\n\n128. Didda (980/1-1003 A.D.)\n\nDidda herself has played an interesting and important part in Kashmir history. She was from her mother’s side a grand-daughter of King Bhima Sahi of Udbhanda. She assumed supremacy for close to half a century, ever since her marriage to Ksemagupta. Tunga becomes Prime Minister during her direct rule. Samgramaraja, her brother’s son appointed Yuvaraja.\n\nDuring her reign the greatest Saiva Philosopher Abhinavagupta (c. 950 – 1016 AD) wrote Tantraloka, Parmarthasara, Pratyabhijna Vimarsini, Pratyabhijna Vi Vrti-Vimarsini, Para-Trimisika-Vivarama and Tantrasara.\n\nAlberuni writes Kitab ul Hind. A lot of his information about Hindus comes from Kashmiri Pandits in the plains. He writes about Kashmir also.\n\nFirst Lohara Dynasty\n\n129. Samgramaraja (1003-28 A.D.)\n\nSon of udyaraja, brother of Queen Didda. The period covered by Samgramaraja’s reign witnessed great upheaval in the political conditions of Northern India under the impact of invasions of Muhmud of Ghazni. Kashmir troops under the command of Tunga support Shahi Trilocanapala in 1013 A.D., but were defeated. Trilocanapala’s father Shahi dynasty Ānandapāla of Peshawar flees to Kashmir after facing defeat at the Ghazni and signs a peace treaty with him. His father Jayapala had also earlier struggled to keep Ghaznavids from crossing Indus. Thus 3 generations of Shahis were involved in this struggle. During time of Ānandapāla people from those regions start seeking refuge in Kashmir and Kashmir closely starts guarding its passes.\n\nDuring A.D. 1015 and 1021 Mahmud tries to attack Kashmir, but fails. Tunga (and his son) are murdered after his return to Kashmir by Samgramaraja. Bhujana, a Brahmin lord of Kamraz region, tries to kill the King who is protected by Tantrays.\n\nPredominance of Darads (a chief named Arjuna), Diviras (clerks) and Damars.\n\nWe also find mention of one Damara Helachakra, a possible reference to the family that came to be later known as Chaks.\n\nLothika Matha and Tellotama Math built in Kashmir.\n\nKsemaraja (Pupil of Abhinavagupta) wrote Siva-sutra-Vrtti, Siva-Sutrap Vimarsini, Pratyabhijna-Hrdays, Spanda-Sandoha, Spanda-Nirnaya.\n\nAbu Rayhan al-Biruni as part of Ghazi’s court travels to India [in around 1017] and writes Tārīkh al-Hind, writing about Kashmir too as most of his sources are Kashmiri. He writes in it about science works of Kashmirian astronomer Bhattopala (Utpala, who wrote in 966/969). In 1872, Bhattopala’s commentaries on Varahamira’s 6th century work (Brhatsamhita and Brhajjataka) becomes one of the primary sources of Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English dictionary (which plagiarised Böhtlingk and Roth’s Petersburg Sanskrit-Wörterbuc)[*Bill Mak]\n\n130. Hariraja (1028-1063 A.D. )\n\nSon and successor of Samgramaraja ruled for only 22 days and Kingship passed to his young brother.\n\n131. Ananta (1028-1063 A.D. )\n\nYounger brother of Hariraja. Rudrapala and Diddapala, princes of the Sahi family sought refuge in Kashmir and grew in power. Ananta married Suryamati, daughter of Inducandra, ‘lord of Halanidhara’.

Kalasa (1063-1089 A.D.)\n\nAnanta abdicates in favour of Kalasa, his son, under the influence of his queen Suryamati. Kalasa – a dissolute prince who practises tantric rites with Guru named Pramadakaṇṭha for power which corrupts his mind. Kalhana hints that Pramadakaṇṭha had relations [sva-sutā-surate] with his own daughter. Kalhana’s indignation is triggered by orthodoxy that looked at tantra practitioners with horror.\n\nKalasa attacked his father Ananta who had shifted to Vijayesvara. Ananta commits suicide by sitting on a knife in A.D. 1081 and Suryamati burns herself as Sati. Kalasa consolidated his Kingdom.

Harsa (1089-1101 A.D.)\n\nHarsa was well versed in many sciences and a lover of music and arts. Harsa introduced into the country more elaborate fashions of dress and ornaments – perhaps an indication of Muhammadan influence – and made his courtiers imitate his own taste for extravagance in personal attire. Kalhana’s reference to the Dekhan fashions which Harsa copied in his amusements and also in his coinage is curiously corroborated to some extent by gold coins of Harsa, which in their type unmistakably imitate the contemporary coinage of Karnata. Ruthless spoilation of sacred shrines under Harsha for financial considerations. Temple treasures ransacked. Muslim captains employed for the first time under him. Harsa accused of incest. Disastrous expeditions in Rajapuri and Kisanganaga valley. Disastrous floods. Rebellion of Damars under Uccala and Sussala who were brothers and distantly related to Queen Didda. In A.D. 1101 Uccala attacked Kashmir from West and Sussala from the East. Harsa resisted hopelessly and was ultimately murdered. Uccala was the first to occupy Srinagar.\n\nKalhana’s father Chamnaka [Canpakdvarajah], was a faithful adherent of Harsha.

Uccala (1101-11 A.D.)\n\nKalhana’s history from 1101 to 1149 fills not less than 3449 slokas and thus forms close on on-half of the whole work. Kalhana’s work throws detailed light on the social and economic condidtions. Uccala was a capable and energetic ruler. Rebellion of Sussala who was made ruler of Punch.

Jayasimha (1128-54 A.D.)\n\nJayasimha was son and successor of Sussala. Kalhana employs more than 2000 verses (more than 1/4 th of his work) for describing the reign of Jayasimha. Jayasimha’s first 17 years of reign spend struggling against feudal barons (Damars). To embarrass him, they set up no less than 5 pretend kings, some of them crowned in the outlying district of Lohara. Jayasimha managed to hold on using intrigues. Mention of Brahmin warriors like Alamkara.\n\nAmong the claimants is Lothana, a brother of Salhana. Lothana sought help from Damara Alamkarachakra (again possible ref. to Chaks) but eventually failed.\n\nKalhana closes his account with 1149 A.D. but on the authority of Jonaraja (15th century A.D.) who continued the work of Kalhana, Jayasimha ruled till 1154 A.D.

But Arghun is dead by the time bride arrives and the bride Kokochin is given to his son Ghazan. Polo mentions Kashmir as land of “magicians” who cause rains at will. Allauddin Simnani (d.1336), uncle and teacher of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani (1314-84), was part of Buddhist Arghun’s court. Simnani has religious differences with the king who has great respect for Simnani. Simnani claims persecution in court and flees but it brought back and forced to go up in debate against Buddists. Simnani writes, “There, he [Arghun] had assembled Buddist priests from India, Kashmir, Tibet and Ighur, along with the ascetics and the religious leaders of the idolaters around him, to engage in disputation with me. So I discussed and disputed them. But God Almighty lent me strength, and I was able to refute all of them, and to disgrace and humiliate them.” At the end of it, Arghun tries to convince Simnani to give up Islam and even promises him to remain the court “Sufi”.

Ghazan is at war with his cousin Baidu, and to defeat him seeks help from Nawruz, an emir based out of Khorasan, who puts up the condition of conversion. At the time some nobles already are muslim. For chapter on Kashmir and Buddhism Rashid-al-Din relies as source Kamalashri, a Kashmiri Buddhist Bikshu in Iran. After Iran empire turns to Islam, the Kashmiri Bikshu’s asked to move back to Kashmir if they are not ready to really follow Islam.

Mughal court right from the time of Farrukh Siyar keeps applying the tax and then removing it, both acts under pressure from different quarters. In 1719 during the time of Muhammad Shah, Jazia is abolished. Mughal court is not as powerful as it was and has seen one emperor after another in quick succession. In Kashmir, a Sunni Jagirdar named Mahbub Khan (also known as Abdun Nabi Kashmiri/Mullah Abdun Nabi Muhtavi Khan) sees an opportunity to seize power of Kashmir. Mahbub Khan was appointed chief theologian of Kashmir by Emperor Bahadur Shah. He makes Jazia his rallying cry and seizes power from Mughal Deputy Subedar Mir Ahmed Khan and using support of masses and Kazis/clerics decrees that non-Muslims should not ride horses, should not put turbans, coats, armors, should not go to parks and gardens for excursions, and should not bath on certain days. Mughal officials in Kashmir refuse to comply as Emperor Muhammad Shah has already abolished Jazia and offered Zimmi status to non-Muslims. In response Abdun Nabi Kashmiri and his men start harassing and violating Hindu life and property. Mughal representatives are helpless as their troops are defeated by Abdun Nabi Kashmiri’s men but then Shias get involved in the affair as Abdun Nabi’s violence is against all those he considers non-Muslims. In the end, Abdun Nabi Kashmiri dies at the hand of Shias who managed to corner and kill him along with his two sons through deception on 12 September, 1720. This leads to Shia-Sunni riots as Zadibal is burnt down by third son of Abdun Nabi, Mulla Sharaf-ud-din and general Sunni masses. The riots end with Delhi sending fresh reinforcement in 1721 under Abdus Samad Khan. Delhi must have been worried to have sent the man who captured Khalsa rebel warrior Banda Singh Bahadur in Punjab in 1715. To put end to rioting Mughal forces kill Sharaf-ud-din and publicly hang 50 ringleaders of the rioting gangs.\n\nIn around 1722, one Ragho Ram Koul converts to Islam at the hands of Mir Abdul Rashid Baihiqi and changes name to Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah.

But, after after 40 days Mughals again manage to regain control after fight put up by Mughals under Abul Barkat Khan and Ati Ullah Khan (1739-1741). 15000 houses burn in Srinagar areas during conflict.\n\n1747, Nadir Shah is assasinated.
