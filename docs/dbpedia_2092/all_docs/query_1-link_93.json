The average annual growth rate is 3.0 percent during this period.\n\nAREA:\n\nThe total area of the District is 1,543 square Kilometres.\n\nGEOLOGY–MINING GEOLOGY:\n\nThe district is quite rich in natural resources. Marble, sandstone, gravel are available in large quantity. The same are leased out to interesting parties by the Directorate General, Mines and Mineral as per Government policy and thus a lot of money is going to the public exchequer, each year on this count.\n\nThe lime stone, sandstone and phyllite / slates are common economic rocks of the area. Limestone is used for crushers and road construction where as the sandstone and slates are used for houses.\n\nGENERAL ASPECT:\n\nYousafzai is the dominating tribe of the District whose ancestors came from Ghowra Marghai, the place is some where in Western Afghanistan. Yousafzai first occupied Peshawar and gradually they occupied the present territories. Yousafzai generally have robust built stature with fair complexion. They are well known for their hospitality.\n\nMost of the inhabitants are Yousafzai. The Major tribes in the district are as under: -\n\n(a) Razzar\n\n(b) Utman\n\n(c) Jadoon\n\n(d) Umar Khel\n\n(e) Aba Khel\n\n(f) Khattak (in small numbers)\n\nAll people belong to Muslim Sunni school of thought. The Muslims are staunch followers of the religion.\n\nLANGUAGE AND DIALECTS:\n\nPushto is the main speaking language of the district. However Hindko is also spoken in few villages i.e. Jehangira, Tordher, Manki and Jangidher etc.\n\n​\n\nCLIMATE CONDITION:\n\nSwabi has hot and humid summers and cold winters. High temperatures are recorded during the months of June and July while the coldest months are December and January. Some areas like Mahaban are situated at an altitude of 7000 feet above sea level and have pleasant weather during summers.\n\nPLACES OF TOURISTS INTEREST / HISTORICAL PLACES\n\n1. Mahaban is a famous mountain, which according to Dr. Stein has been mentioned in the Alexander campaign. It is about 7000 feet above the Sea Level. On the top of the ridge that stretches towards the Indus, known as SHAH KOT, old ruins of a fortress are still present at places. It is partly located in District Buner and the greater portion is in District Swabi. From here it extends into Haripur District.\n\nIt is a potential hill resort for the people of the area due to its close proximity to Tarbela Dam, Topi, Gadoon Industrial Estate and Mardan but it is utterly lacking in all infrastructures.\n\n​\n\n2. Hund is an important historical place. It has been the capital of Hindu Shahi dynasty. Changiz Khan while chasing Jalal-Ud-Din Khawarzmi came up to this point and then turned back. The most significant land mark is the crossing of Indus by Alexander at this place. For attracting tourists, a developmental scheme has been under-taken by the Public Works Department, Swabi.\n\nFORESTRY:\n\nThe ratio of Forest in District Swabi is negligible; however, there are some areas under forests in Gadoon like Mahaban, which is protected by the Government as well as local people. A lot of work is needed for the development of forestation in the district.\n\nHUNTING PLACES:\n\nMahaban and other adjoining hills are the hunting places in the District.\n\nCOMMUNICATION:\n\nThere is a chain of metaled roads in Swabi District. Small roads/link roads are spread throughout the District. Farm to market roads play an important role in the development of agriculture. The project of M-1 (Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway via Swabi) has further improved communication facilities in the District.\n\nPOST OFFICES\n\nThe details of Post offices in the District are as under:\n\n(a) Head Post Office 01\n\n(b) Sub Post Offices 24\n\n(c) Extra Departmental Sub Post Offices 05\n\n(d) Branch Post Offices 56\n\nAGRICULTURE:\n\nThe entire area is fertile and produces good crops. However, one of the cultivated areas is barani and under favourable weather conditions and sufficient rainfalls gives very good out put of wheat, maize, tobacco, sugarcane etc. there are a number of canals flowing in the district.\n\n​\n\nLIVE STOCK:\n\nThere are 7 veterinary hospitals, 24 dispensaries and 11 veterinary centers in the District. They provide health cover to 70% animals of different species for different diseases. Vaccination is done by the departmental staff as well as Live Stock Extension workers in different villages who are trained by the Department with foreign financial assistance.\n\nINDUSTRIES:\n\nIndustrial Estate Gadoon Amazai was approved by the Federal Government to create job opportunities for the local people in order to stop poppy cultivation in the area. Initially 200 acre of land was developed with Provincial Government grant of Rs.24.800 Million for purchase of land and Rs.20 Million by US aid for construction of infrastructure. However from June 1986 to June 1989, no investor applied for allotment, except two.\n\nIn 1989, the Government announced special package with following incentives.\n\n1. Tax Holiday for ten years.\n\n2. Complete exemption from duty on import of Machinery and Raw materials.\n\n3. Electricity at 50 % Tariff.\n\n4. Mark up at 3 % on financing of field cast.\n\n5. Exemption from Sale Tax on production for 8 years.\n\nConsequently applications for allotment poured in and SDA acquired additional land of 916 acres to meet the demand. Out of 1116 acres of land 124 acres was provided for infrastructure and 602 plots were developed and allotted to investors in various sectors. Resultantly 115 units came into operation and the remaining were in the process of construction.\n\nIn April 1991, the incentives granted were withdrawn and as a result most of the investors stopped their activities.
