        "text": "Residential dwellings in Awadh (old Lucknow and surrounding districts) province were known as &quot;Kothies&quot; and the dwellings in Shekhawati (Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu districts in Rajasthan state) province were as &quot;Havelis&quot;. These dwellings are one of a kind in the India and are the marvels in the architecture of India. Though neglected for the years these dwellings still have the essence of the glorious past it had experienced. Although developed in same time period these dwellings have different architectural styles and different architectural techniques making it sustainable buildings. Buildings in the past contained cultural as well as social values but modern buildings have developed a sense of functionalist aesthetics which neglects the regional cultures. These dwellings were built by making various uses of the vernacular techniques as well as innovative techniques of that time without losing its traditional and cultural characteristics.\n\nWinston Churchill right away says the grasp of architecture & surroundings with the phrase that \"We shape our buildings & later they shape us. Architecture is a civic profession that feels all human beings at all levels of their reality everywhere & every day. The space induced a previous old historical descendant to suggest that spaces grip our mind to think about the past events & incidents in it. The world should move towards sustainability through the vernacular aspects. In this Rapid growing modern world, the built form is majorly mechanized with the active technologies which in turn increases the cost of living. Vernacular principles provide a comfortable living environment through sustainable principles & energy-efficient techniques. Indigenous architecture is the only solution to the problem the world is facing. This paper's result represents, what does haveli mean? Through spaces & function in architecture. we also form the valid highlighting points with supporting case study. We found valid passive design ideas, intrinsic construction details of Havelis of Rajasthan. Also, endorse the vernacular aspects in the modern building through Indigenous architecture of Haveli & its responsiveness to location & climate through the case study of Nathmal ki haveli which promotes more sustainability with high energy-efficient techniques.\n\nAfter 1857, when India became a direct colony of the British Crown, was the architectural style adopted by the colonial masters an attempt at subverting the local identity and reasserting their supremacy via architecture or was its purpose to engage their institutions with their context? Was the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture anachronistic and reductive in nature or was it a way to draw on the past? What role did the Jeypore Portfolio play in negotiating colonial intent by appropriating traditional building culture? How did Bhai Ram Singh mediate an identity for 19th century Lahore by contextualizing Indo-Saracenic architecture? This exploratory study attempts to answer these questions using existing literary sources and by considering buildings designed by Bhai Ram Singh in the city of Lahore. The paper also critically evaluates the agency of the Jeypore Portfolio for Indo-Saracenic architecture, how it reduced the centuries-old local building tradition to a limited palette o...\n\nAgra was the capital of the Mughal Empire at its zenith, and the splendour of the city during this period can only be imagined. There is an abundance of royal buildings which are protected by the Government of India. There were other significant buildings too, housing the high nobility, away from both the royal quarters as well as the ordinary peoples’ houses. These have largely vanished, being large enough to attract builders as well as developers. The article describes and establishes the significance of one such rare traditional townhouse or mansion called ‘haveli’ located on the river Yamuna, Agra, in relation to a larger historical and cultural landscape. It also discusses the possibilities of conservation and management for protecting and enhancing the significance of the premises and planning for its sustainable development in future. The current edifice appears to be a coalescence of British and Mughal architecture with some local features. The building stands where similar-..."
