        "text": "Contact Counsellor\n\nCategoryWorld Affairs\n\nLast Updated19/11/2021\n\nEnglish\n\nHindi\n\nAfghan opium production rises for a fifth year, UN report says\n\nAccording to a United Nations report, Afghanistan’s opium production crossed the 6,000-ton mark for the fifth straight year.\n\nKey Findings\n\nOutput grew 8% this year and incentives for cultivation have risen as prices have picked up amid soaring poverty and food insecurity.\n\nAccounting for some 87% of the global production, despite a two-decade effort by the US to deter illegal production of the drug in the country.\n\nIncome from opiates in Afghanistan amounted to some $1.8-$2.7 billion in 2021.\n\nThis trend is undermining efforts to stop the war-torn nation from being the hub of the global drug trade.\n\nAfghanistan and Opium\n\nLargest producer: Afghanistan is the world’s largest opium producer, accounting for some 87% of the global production, despite a $9 billion, two-decade effort by the US to deter illegal production of the drug in the country.\n\nEconomy dependent on opium: The crop also makes up the largest share of illegal activity in the country where the economy has been long dependent on foreign aid and opium sales.\n\nIncome from opiates in Afghanistan amounted to some $1.8-$2.7 billion in 2021\n\nHowever, much larger sums are accrued along illicit drug supply chains outside Afghanistan.\n\nOpium\n\nOpium comes from the sap in unripe poppy-seed pods.\n\nThe sap dries into a brown latex that contains alkaloids which produce a host of narcotic and pharmaceutical drugs, including heroin, methamphetamine, morphine and codeine.\n\nGlobal Scenario\n\nThe supply source for this huge underground economy is now concentrated in three areas:\n\nAfghanistan, South-East Asia (mostly Myanmar) and Latin America (Mexico and Colombia).\n\nTogether, they supply nearly all the world’s illicit opium and heroin, but Afghanistan stands out among this group, accounting for around 90% of global illicit opium production in recent years.\n\nImpact on India\n\nRising health costs:\n\nAmong illicit narcotics, opiates are also the most costly in terms of treatment, medical care and, arguably, drug-related violence.\n\nIn addition, heroin is the drug most associated with injection, which brings about a host of acute and chronic health problems, including the transmission of blood-borne diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C.\n\n45% of Heroin in India originates from Afghanistan.\n\nStability and security:\n\nBeyond its health impact, the illicit opiate industry also has a detrimental effect on stability and security in a number of places, including through the funding it provides for insurgents in production areas, particularly in Afghanistan.\n\nTerrorist angle:\n\nThere is ‘deep concern about links between illicit drug production, trafficking and involvement of terrorist groups, criminals and transnational organized crime.’\n\nReasons Behind the Drug Menace in India\n\nMisguided Youth and Peer Pressure psychology\n\nLack of awareness about socio-legal and health consequences\n\nProximity with Golden Crescent and Golden Triangle:\n\nGolden Triangle: It includes the regions of Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand.\n\nIt is Southeast Asia’s main opium-producing region and one of the oldest narcotics supply routes to Europe and North America.\n\nGolden Crescent: It includes Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan.\n\nIt is a principal global site for opium production and distribution.\n\nSteps Taken by Government to Curb the problem\n\nInternational Cooperation:\n\nIndia has signed 26 bilateral pacts, 15 MoUs and 2 agreements on security cooperation with different countries.\n\nThey all will cooperate and work for combating the illicit trafficking of narcotics, drugs and psychotropic substances, besides chemical precursors.\n\nNarcotics Control Bureau (NCB):\n\nIt coordinated with various international organisations for sharing information and intelligence to combat transnational drug trafficking.\n\nThey included the SAARC Drug Offences Monitoring Desk; BRICS; Colombo Plan; ASEAN Senior Officials on Drug Matters (ASOD); Bay of Bengal Initiative For Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Co-operation (BIMSTEC); United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).\n\nNarco Coordination Centre (NCORD) Mechanism:\n\nAim:\n\nTo coordinate among various Central and State agencies for effective drug law enforcement.\n\nSet up by the MHA in 2016.\n\nThis NCORD system has been restructured into a four-tier scheme up to the district level on July 29, 2019, for better coordination.\n\nLaunch of e-portal ‘SIMS’ (Seizure Information Management System) in 2019:\n\nPurpose: For digitisation of pan-India drug seizure data\n\nLaunched by the MHA for all the drug law enforcement agencies under the mandate of Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS).\n\nMulti-Agency Approach:\n\nBesides the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, the following are also empowered under the NDPS Act for making drug seizures:\n\nthe Border Security Force, Sashastra Seema Bal, Indian Coast Guard, Railway Protection Force and the National Investigation Agency.\n\nIn order to strengthen surveillance along the border for preventing cross-border drug smuggling, the forces were using the latest gadgets and equipment.\""
