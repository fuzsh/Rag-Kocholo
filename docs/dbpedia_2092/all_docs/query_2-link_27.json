        "text": "India’s Assertive Stance Against Terrorism\n\nIndia has long been perceived as a \"soft state\" in the international arena, often seen merely reacting to terrorist incidents on its soil, which are aided, abetted, and masterminded from abroad, mainly Pakistan. However, recent astounding revelations by former CIA officer Sarah Adams indicate a significant departure from this perception. India is no longer regarded as a passive actor. It now proactively targets known and dreaded terrorists, especially those with proclaimed and avowed anti-India missions, often clothed as 'jihad,' stationed in Pakistan and its porous regions with Afghanistan.\n\nIndian agencies are leveraging contacts with the Afghan Taliban to have Pakistani agents on the run. Ms Adams also claimed that India has paid the Taliban $10 million to take care of their personal security of Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada (the supreme leader of the Taliban). This strategic shift involves leveraging local adversaries of Pakistan to neutralise threats effectively.\n\nBackground: The Complex Nexus of Terrorism in Pakistan and Afghanistan\n\nThe geopolitical landscape of Pakistan and Afghanistan is fraught with complexities, particularly concerning terrorism. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan has long been known and proven to be harbouring and supporting terrorist organisations that pose a potent threat to India. These groups receive arms, training, funding, fake passports, intelligence inputs, and ultra-modern communication equipment, including state-of-the-art satellite phones. The presence of militant training camps in these regions has been a persistent challenge for India.\n\nIndia’s Proactive Measures\n\nIn recent years, Indian intelligence agencies, particularly the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), have adopted a more proactive stance. According to Sarah Adams, the former CIA Targeting Officer with extensive experience in counter-terrorism, RAW has been actively involved in operations within Pakistan and Afghanistan. Her recent podcast appearances and other sources suggest several key activities:\n\na.) Operating from Strategic Locations\n\nRAW agents—mainly Afghan nations and a few Pakistani citizens— are allegedly operating from militant training camps in Afghanistan, particularly in Spin Boldak near the Pakistan border. These agents target wanted and legally proclaimed Kashmiri activists residing in Pakistan. Additionally, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) serves as a strategic and command base for Indian intelligence operations against Pakistan.\n\nb.) Supporting Anti-Pakistan Groups\n\nPakistan has often accused RAW of supporting and funding terrorist groups such as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). These groups routinely carry out attacks inside Pakistan, destabilising the region and countering Pakistan’s strategic interests, usually targeting Pakistan’s military and Police establishments and outposts. Few Indian citizens have, however, been arrested in Afghanistan for their alleged links to these groups, indicating a a unique but deep-rooted and intricate network of support.\n\nc.) Assassination of Wanted Kashmiri Terrorists\n\nThere are growing fears in Pakistan that India is deploying \"death squads\" to eliminate terrorists wanted by India who live under ISI protection in Pakistan. This includes prominent Kashmiri separatist leaders. Sarah Adams was quick to disclaim that, since her area of operational interest was Kashmir, she had no personal knowledge regarding pro-Khalistan Sikh militants in Pakistan being targeted. These targeted killings arguably represent a bold and aggressive strategy to neutralise threats before they can act against India.\n\nd.) Suspicious Deaths of Pro-Khalistan Militants in Pakistan\n\nSikh and pro-Khalistan activists wanted by India have been killed in Pakistan under suspicious circumstances since 2022, with allegations that Indian intelligence agencies were behind the assassinations. While Indian officials have been quick to deny such allegations, no worthwhile evidence has been put forth implicating Indian state actors, nor have the assailants been apprehended, much less charged. In May 2023, Paramjit Singh Panjwar, a known terrorist since the days of 1990s militancy in Punjab and chief of the outlawed Khalistan Commando Force (KCF), was shot dead in Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, in May 2023, Harmeet Singh, chief of the banned terrorist organisation Khalistan Liberation Force, another individual accused by India of involvement in murders and training Khalistani militants, was also killed in Lahore, Pakistan. These deaths have fueled suspicions and allegations against Indian intelligence agencies, though concrete evidence linking India to these assassinations remains unproven.\n\nHistorical Involvement and Strategic Encirclement\n\nIndia's involvement in Afghanistan is not new. During the Soviet-Afghan war in the 1980s, RAW recruited influential Afghan warlords like Ahmad Shah Massoud to counter Pakistan's support for the Mujahideen. This historical precedent demonstrates India’s long-standing strategy to prevent Pakistan from using Afghanistan as a base for anti-India activities.\n\nToday, India is leveraging its influence in Afghanistan to counteract threats from Pakistan and to support stability in the region, asserting that a proactive strategy is the best form of defence. The Indian embassy in Kabul, operating with minimal staff, is focused on fostering diplomatic and economic ties. Despite this, Pakistan often accuses India of conducting anti-Pakistan activities, which has led to further strains in bilateral relations. India's actions are aimed at safeguarding its national security and promoting peace in the region, despite the allegations from its neighbour.\n\nSarah Adams on India’s Strategic Operations: Abstract from the Video Transcript\n\nIn her most recent video podcast, Sarah Adams, a former CIA Targeting Officer known by her call sign \"Superbad,\" has provided a comprehensive analysis of India's covert operations involving Afghanistan and Pakistan. This transcript, covering 2:33:44 to 2:35:58 on the video, sheds light on the intricate strategies and alliances India has formed to target terrorists posing threats to its national security.\n\nAdams begins by expressing her fascination with the complexity of India’s operations, mentioning that she initially stumbled upon this information while investigating U.S. funding flows. She explains that India has been discreetly supporting various groups, including Mullah Omar's son, Mullah Yaqoob, the acting Defense Minister in the Taliban government since 2021, as also his step-brother, Daud. Additionally, India supports the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to destabilise Pakistan. According to Adams, India has taken a significant step by providing $10 million to Mullah Yaqoob, which funds Gecko Base, the personal security base of Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban’s supreme leader.\n\nIndia’s Covert Assassinations Using Taliban Networks\n\nAdams reveals a startling aspect of these operations: India is allegedly using the Taliban’s networks to assassinate Kashmiri militants in Pakistan. From 2:35:03 to 2:35:58, she explains, \"The Indians and the Taliban are doing... India is using Taliban's network to assassinate Kashmir militants in Pakistan. They have been doing all these hits, killing a bunch of militants... I don't know anything about the Sikh part, so if anyone's interested in that part, I've only looked at the Kashmir piece.\" In other words, she sedulously avoids making any claim regarding pro-Khalistan Sikh militants in Pakistan being targeted.\n\nBig Pak Cities No Longer a Safe Haven\n\nThese assassinations are occurring in major Pakistani cities like Lahore and Karachi, raising questions about the risks and implications for both India and the Taliban. Adams notes that some of these militants have been on India’s wanted list for decades, and the collaboration with the Taliban has enabled India to systematically eliminate these long-time adversaries. She speculates that some militants may have been placed in safe houses by Pakistani authorities, suggesting a complex cat-and-mouse game between Indian intelligence and Pakistani security forces.\n\nStrategic Motives of Taliban and Future Scenarios\n\nSarah Adams delves deeper into the strategic implications of these assassinations, discussing how the Taliban and its ally, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), might be using India’s objectives to their own advantage. The alliance between the Taliban and HuM, rooted in historical and personal connections, appears to be aimed at reshaping the militant landscape in Kashmir. By eliminating the old guard of Kashmiri militant leaders from organisations like Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), who are aligned with Pakistan’s military and ISI, they pave the way for a new generation of militants. These new leaders, having fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan, are likely to be more aligned with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda than with Pakistan. This effectively changes the allegiance of these well-entrenched terrorist organisations in Kashmir from the Pakistani military establishment to the Taliban.\n\nCaution of India\n\nSarah Adams suggests that this new militant landscape could drastically alter future conflict scenarios in Kashmir, sounding a huge note of caution for Indian agencies. The Taliban and Al-Qaeda's long-term strategy involves preparing for a potential future war in Kashmir, where they anticipate leveraging this new generation of militants. This forward-thinking approach highlights the strategic depth and foresight of these groups, which contrasts with the often reactive measures of traditional state actors. Thus, while the tactical successes and the headcount may be applauded by the Indian top brass, there is a need for caution. The very genie they let out of the bottle might become a Frankenstein that comes back to haunt them in Kashmir.\n\nA Complex Web of Alliances and Strategies\n\nSarah Adams' insights reveal a complex and multi-layered web of alliances and strategies involving India, the Taliban, and various militant groups. Her analysis underscores India's proactive measures to secure its national interests by neutralising threats beyond its borders. While Adams clarifies that she does not have detailed knowledge about the targeting of Sikh militants, her observations on the Kashmir-centric operations provide a compelling glimpse into the evolving dynamics of regional security.\n\nIndia's collaboration with the Taliban, though fraught with risks, exemplifies its determination to address longstanding security challenges through unconventional and assertive means. This proactive stance marks a significant departure from its earlier image as a \"soft state,\" positioning India as a formidable player in the regional security landscape.\n\nSarah Adams: A Distinguished Career in Counter-Terrorism\n\nSarah Adams, known by her call sign \"Superbad,\" is a former CIA Targeting Officer with a distinguished career in counter-terrorism. Throughout her tenure at the CIA, she specialised in targeting operations, identifying and neutralising threats to U.S. national security. Her significant contributions to the field are highlighted in her book, \"Benghazi: Know Thy Enemy,\" which details her experiences and insights into the 2012 Libya terrorist attacks. Adams' expertise extended beyond the CIA as she later served as the Senior Advisor for the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Benghazi. In this role, she conducted thorough investigations into the attacks and worked diligently to mitigate future security risks to U.S. personnel overseas.\n\nA Leading Voice on Global Terrorism Threats\n\nAfter her tenure at the CIA, Sarah Adams continued to leverage her extensive knowledge and experience in the realm of terrorism and security. Her work with the Benghazi committee positioned her as one of the most knowledgeable individuals on active terrorism threats worldwide. Adams' insights and analyses have been sought after in various forums, including her recent podcast appearances, where she discusses her CIA and congressional experiences. These appearances offer a deep dive into her strategies and the broader implications of counter-terrorism efforts, underscoring her role as a leading voice in understanding and addressing global terrorism threats. Thus, while her perspectives cannot be regarded as the gospel truth, her narrative cannot be easily brushed aside as merely that of a “well-informed” Washington-based US journalist.\n\nSumming Up: An India Perspective\n\nFrom Reactive to Proactive\n\nIndia’s shift from a reactive to a proactive stance against terrorism marks a significant evolution in its national security strategy. The 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008, carried out by 10 members of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant group, killed 166 people, with the sole surviving attacker implicating Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency in the plot. In the 2001 Indian Parliament attack, five gunmen from the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) stormed the parliament complex, killing nine people before being shot dead, pushing India and Pakistan to the brink of war. The surgical Balakot airstrikes in February 2019 already adumbrated a change in the Indian strategy, but the current approach carries the game further.\n\nProtecting its Sovereignty\n\nBy actively targeting known and hardcore terrorists in Pakistan and Afghanistan, India is not only protecting its interests but also sending a clear message that it will not tolerate threats to its sovereignty. This proactive strategy aims to neutralise threats before they can materialise, ensuring a safer and more secure future for India. While controversial and complex, these measures underscore India’s determination to safeguard its national security. The resolve demonstrated by Indian intelligence agencies, under the dynamic and assertive leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to combat terrorism at its roots, even beyond its borders, highlights a significant and assertive shift in India's approach to maintaining national security.\n\nShare\n\nIf you believe this article would interest someone you know, please feel free to share it anonymously (for us), using any platform that you prefer.\n\nShare The KBS Chronicle"
