        "text": "John Ferguson’s bloodstock journey was one with many twists and turns. He was set on a course to becoming one of the most respected leaders in the bloodstock world from a young age having spent his childhood and teenage years immersed in the Pony Club and the hunting field. His career in the racing industry started as Assistant Trainer to Nick Gaselee, for whom he led up Grand National runner Purdo. From there Ferguson moved on to spend 3 years with master trainer Sir Michael Stoute.\n\nJohn Ferguson’s bloodstock career then began gaining momentum as he started working for Bloodstock Agent Dick O’Gorman, with whom he would form a long lasting and hugely successful professional relationship.\n\nFerguson went on to set up his own bloodstock agency buying horses for various owners including the big hitting Australians Kerry Packer and Lloyd Williams. John’s indisputable talent as an agent was evident from an early stage and he quickly had Group One success with top class horses such as Pentire and First Island. John’s bloodstock expertise did not go unnoticed and he was soon headhunted by the, then fledgling, Godolphin operation.\n\nJohn Ferguson went on to spend over twenty years as Sheikh Mohammed’s main bloodstock adviser before being promoted to Chief Executive of Godolphin. During his time with Godolphin, Ferguson was responsible for the purchase and management of high-class stallions, breeding stock, yearlings, land acquisitions and racehorses. Some of John’s more notable equine achievements include the purchase of outstanding stallions Medaglia d’Oro and Exceed And Excel. Other successful acquisitions include the Champion racehorses; New Approach, Ribchester and Harry Angel.\n\nUnusually for a bloodstock agent, John Ferguson has also been a hugely successful trainer in his own right. In just four years as a jumps trainer Ferguson had over 250 winners that included two Grade One winners, Ruacana and Parlour Games. A true horseman, John also spent five years as Master of the Scarteen Hounds in Limerick."
