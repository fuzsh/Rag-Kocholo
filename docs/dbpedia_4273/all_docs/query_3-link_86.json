It would be a real shame.’\"\n\nThere are 30 foals expected to be born in the new year and they will fetch high prices as the last bred by the queen.\n\nAccording to the source, some horses have already been sold as part of the \"natural churn\", with the monarch typically selling around seven horses a year.\n\nLast year saw the queen's most successful ever in the sport, earning £590,000 prize money from 36 winners.\n\nThe queen - who subsidised the running costs of her horse hobby from her private purse as it wasn't always profitable - also kept around 30 show horses.\n\nEarlier this month, she posthumously won a top prize at the Horse of the Year show for her retrained racehorse First Receiver."
