        "text": "A quality art print from an original painting by Jacqueline Stanhope.\n\nA top-class stayer on the flat, Estimate gave Her Majesty the Queen a memorable Royal Ascot victory in the 2013 Gold Cup. Adding to the sense of occasion was that Estimate had been, in essence, an 80th birthday present from another renowned owner-breeder, His Highness the Aga Khan. Besides the Gold Cup triumph – in her first attempt at Group 1 glory – Estimate’s wins included the Queen’s Vase, Doncaster Cup, and Sagaro Stakes. Trained throughout her career by Sir Michael Stoute in Newmarket, Estimate is shown here with Ryan Moore in the saddle. Signed Limited Edition of 250 – Approximate image size (cms): 40 x 46"
