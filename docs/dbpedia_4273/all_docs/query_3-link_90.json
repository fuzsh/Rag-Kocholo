        "text": "On last night’s episode, one of the groups of 4 in the connecting wall round was Grand National winners: Rule The World, Papillon, Corbiere and L’Escargot.\n\nAs anyone who has ever watched the show knows, the wall usually has items which could fit into more than one group. This time Foinavon and Ben Nevis were also on the wall – but they were proper to the Scottish Mountains group instead.\n\nOne of the other Scottish Mountains was Arkle. I am afraid to say one of the contestants said to her team mates “What is Arkle?”. They were none the wiser.\n\nThey failed to get any of the groups. When the wall was resolved and the group of four Aintree winners was revealed, they could not answer what connected them.\n\nA useful reminder that horses we think of as famous are not that well known, even to a group of clearly intelligent people.\n\nYes I noticed that too, which meant it was the first National winner I ruled out. I knew Foinavon was named after a Scottish mountain, just like Arkle – so that meant Ben Nevis had to go into that group and well.\n\nIt was clever the way Papillon could also have fitted into the Steve McQueen films group.\n\nI believe one of the Waley Cohen family is the main question writer, so he usually fits a racing question or two into each series. Well done to him for resisting putting Noble Yeats in there!\n\nThe once a year Grand National players don’t\n\nstore or have any need to know names of famous racehorses\n\nIf they backed a 100/1 winner of a GN and you asked them to name the horse the following week I’m sure not many could.\n\nI’ve no interest in Rugby. I watched the final as it was a final and could tell you that Wilkinson kicked the winning punt but who else was in the team my memory has long pushed that information out of my head\n\nBlackbeard to conquer the World\n\nI clocked the Grand National winners pretty quickly, Rule The world was the handy one and also identified the wrong spelling of Foinaven. I drive my wife up the wall shouting at the telly when I’ve spotted the group but the team hasn’t!\n\nPointless had years of Grand National winners a while back as their prize question and I proceeded to recite all the winners from 1960 to 2000, funnily enough I struggle a bit to remember the ones after that!\n\nGot 13 out 14 when the guy came on Mastermind and took ‘Racecourses of Great Britain’ as his specialist subject. Failed on the same one as he did."
