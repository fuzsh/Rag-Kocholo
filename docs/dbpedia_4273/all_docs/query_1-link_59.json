        "text": "CÓD\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n13 min read\n\n·\n\nMay 13, 2024\n\n--\n\nLike any other sport, racing is laden with assumptions that stand the test of the time. One such assumption is the general belief that it is only the very best colts on the racetrack who are able to become the best stallions in the covering sheds. A closely related assumption is that which states the best sires are those who shall see their sirelines endure whereas lesser sires shall watch theirs gradually ease out of sight. However, like nearly any assumption related to sport, exceptions do exist; sometimes, good but not truly great colts can make their presence unexpectedly felt at stud whilst some more unlikely sirelines can stubbornly outlive their “sexier” counterparts.\n\nOne of racing’s great breeders, Federico Tesio is perhaps best remembered these days for a quote of his rather than the racing achievements of either Nearco or Ribot. Quite possibly John Magnier’s favourite line, Tesio once said “The Thoroughbred exists because its selection has depended, not on experts, technicians, or zoologists, but on a piece of wood: the winning post of the Epsom Derby. If you base your criteria on anything else, you will get something else, not the Throughbred.”\n\nUsing Derby success as the benchmark, one could note that since 2007, all Derby winners can trace their origins back to at least one of three horses. Sadler’s Wells needs no introduction; Champion Sire fourteen times and the sire of both Galileo and Montjeu, it is to the surprise of precisely no-one that his presence is still felt in the modern era. On the other hand, a mare whose best blacktype result was 2nd in the 1981 Lingfield Oaks would likely not be most people’s port of call as one of the main drivers of Derby success from a pedigree perspective. However, whilst she was a decent if unspectacular racemare, Allegretta was a terrific broodmare, herself producing a 2,000 Guineas winner in King’s Best and most famously of all, the 1993 Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe winner in Urban Sea. Allegretta’s influence extends beyond those two (Her daughter, Allez Les Trois was mated with Anabaa to produce 2001 Prix du Jockey Club winner Anabaa Blue) but it is primarily through one of the all-time great broodmares in Urban Sea that her legacy endures to this day.\n\nSo who is the third influence? And why did I open with a paragraph about unexpectedly successful stallions and “unsexy” sirelines emerging from places one could not reasonably expect? Fortunately, one horse is the answer to both questions: it could only be the weird and wonderful Cape Cross.\n\nIn all, Cape Cross sired eight different G1 winners but four in particular stand out. His first stand-out horse on the track was Ouija Board, winner of the 2004 Oaks; Lord Derby’s filly would go on to win six more G1s, namely the Irish Oaks, Hong Kong Vase, Prince of Wales’s, Nassau, and then the Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Turf twice.\n\nIncidentally, one of Ouija Board’s biggest fans was Christopher Tsui; so inspired was he by her success that he sent Urban Sea to be covered by Cape Cross. Urban Sea had already produced one top-class Derby winner and a subsequent generational sire in Galileo (Sadler’s Wells) but her mating with Cape Cross would somehow upstage even Galileo’s achievements on the track. Unquestionably one of racing’s all-time greats, Sea The Stars won six G1s in six consecutive months: the 2,000 Guineas in May, the Derby in June, the Eclipse in July, the Juddmonte in August, the Irish Champion Stakes in September, and then the Arc in October.\n\nSea The Stars wasn’t the only son of Cape Cross to win the Derby, Eclipse, Irish Champion Stakes, and Arc all in the one season; Golden Horn took home all four in 2015, with only Arabian Queen (Dubawi) denying Golden Horn a fourth all-age G1 in the Juddmonte. Somewhat ironically, Cape Cross was a miler on the track and yet his three best progeny on the track were all Epsom Classic winners. Perhaps the best miler son of Cape Cross was the Shadwell-owned Awtaad who won the 2013 Irish 2,000 Guineas under the guidance of Kevin Prendergast.\n\nAs for his record as a broodmare sire, Cape Cross was free from Sadler’s Wells which opened up the possibility of sending Cape Cross mares to Sadler’s Wells-line stallions. The potency of such an outcross was perhaps best illustrated by Lord Derby’s decision to have the aforementioned Ouija Board covered by Galileo; this mating yielded Australia who, like both sire and dam, achieved Epsom Classic success in the 2014 Derby before going on to win the Irish Derby and the Juddmonte. This however was not the only time a Derby winner out of a Cape Cross mare could trace their sireline back to Sadler’s Wells; Masar (New Approach), from the family of Urban Sea, was the winner of the 2018 Derby. Deviating away from the Galileo branch of the Sadler’s Wells sireline, Authorized x Cape Cross was the outcross repsonsible for Santiago, winner of the 2020 Irish Derby (And incidentally also from Urban Sea’s family)\n\nOf course, Cape Cross’s success as a broodmare sire extended beyond those who hailed from the Sadler’s Wells sireline. Tarnawa (Shamardal) won the Prix Vermeille, Prix de l’Opéra, and Breeders’ Cup Turf in quick succession in 2020 and her half-sister Tahiyra (Siyouni) would later take out the 2022 Moyglare before winning the Irish 1,000 Guineas, Coronation, & Matron all in 2023. Siyouni x Cape Cross also yielded Laurens, winner of the Fillies’ Mile, Prix Saint-Alary, Prix de Diane, Matron, Sun Chariot, and Prix Rothschild. Lope de Vega, a son of Shamardal, also achieved G1 success with a daughter of Cape Cross, with Lucky Vega claiming the spoils in the 2020 Phoenix Stakes.\n\nInarguably, Cape Cross produced three bona fide top-class horses in Ouija Board, Sea The Stars, and Golden Horn; to sire three racehorses of such quality would lead you to think that Cape Cross himself was an elite sire. But to be an elite sire, a stallion must do more than simply producing superstars every now and then. Elite stallions are those who consistently produce blacktype horses in substantial numbers year in, year out.\n\nSo was Cape Cross an elite stallion? Let’s take a quick look at his numbers….\n\nCape Cross sired 1,642 foals in total, of which 1,264 raced on the track; out of those runners, 814 were winners. As for the success of his progeny in blacktype races, Cape Cross sired 171 individual blacktype horses, 97 blacktype winners, 46 Group winners, and 8 G1 winners.\n\nRaw numbers aren’t always the best measure when it comes to analysing a stallion’s performance as the more foals a sire has, the more ammunition they have when it comes to siring blacktype horses. Scaling raw numbers by the numbers of foals and the number of runners gives a better indication of a stallion’s true quality as such measures cannot be gamed by simply having more foals and more runners.\n\nAs for these measures, 10.4% of Cape Cross’s named foals and 13.5% of his runners were blacktype horses, 5.9% of his named foals and 7.6% of his runners were blacktype winners, and 2.8% of his named foals and 3.6% of his runners were Group winners.\n\nIt is at this stage that I must admit that I am not a particularly big fan of scaling the raw numbers by the number of runners. For me, an important quality for any sire is the ability to reliably produce stock who get to the racecourse. Using a measure which scales the raw data by the number of runners disadvantages sires whose progeny regularly make their way to the track whereas it rewards sires whose ability to consistently sire runners is somewhat spotty. That said, in what follows, I will include both measures for posterity even though I admittedly prefer one measure to the other.\n\nBelow, we can see the foals, runners, winners, blacktype horses, blacktype winners, Group winners, and G1 winners for ten different sires. My rationale for choosing the ten sires in question was that I wanted to compare Cape Cross firstly against the stallions who have been broadly considered to be elite (Galileo, Dubawi, Sea The Stars, and Frankel) and secondly against the stallions who are generally considered as good sires if not quite elite ones (Australia, Golden Horn, Nathaniel, New Approach, and Night of Thunder). The first group of horses have all been Top 5 sires in Europe whereas the second group horses fall somewhere in the Top 15/Top 20/Top 25 range instead. The data itself was sourced from BloodHorse.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Galileo tops the charts for all the raw data metrics. None of Australia, Golden Horn, Nathaniel, New Approach, and Night of Thunder have sired more blacktype horses, blacktype winners, Group winners, or G1 winners than Cape Cross although this is hardly a revelation given that Cape Cross has had more runners and foals than all five sires. Compared to the elite sires, Cape Cross has sired fewer blacktype horses, blacktype winners, Group winners, and G1 winners than Galileo, Dubawi, Frankel, and Sea The Stars; Cape Cross has had more runners than the latter two although Galileo and Dubawi (just about) have had more runners than Cape Cross.\n\nNext, we attempt to gain a better insight into how Cape Cross compares against these two groups of sires by looking at the raw data scaled by number of foals. The percentages are colour-coded; the darker the green, the higher the percentage and the darker the red, the lower the percentage.\n\nIn terms of winners to foals, Cape Cross actually comes out well, finishing 2nd out of 10 behind Dubawi. However, the other metrics are less flattering to Cape Cross; he comes 6th in blacktype horses to foals, 6th in blacktype winners to foals, 8th in Group winners to foals, and 8th in G1 winners to foals. Even in the metrics where he comes 6th, he is closer to 10th than he is to 4th; 10.41% of Cape’s Cross foals achieved blacktype compared to STS’s 13.91% and Nathaniel’s 7.21% and then 5.91% of Cape Cross’s foals went on to be blacktype winners compared to STS’s 7.87% and Nathaniel’s 4.12%. The other metrics are hardly misleading either; STS came 4th in the Group winners to foals metric at 4.59% in contrast with Cape Cross at 2.8% and Golden Horn in 10th at 1.71%, whilst STS was also 4th for G1 winners to foals at 1.38% versus Cape Cross’s 0.49% and 10th-placed Golden Horn’s 0%. Again, the selection of stallions in this study was never meant to represent an exhaustive list but to my eyes, the sires chosen here and how their data shapes up gives a good illustration as to Cape Cross’s true quality as a sire.\n\nOn somewhat of a tangent, I must also note that the data both above and below cannot perfectly reflect a stallion’s quality. The rate at which a stallion throws blacktype horses, blacktype winners, and Group winners is of course a function of the sire’s own quality but it is also a function of the dam’s quality as well. Moreover, breeding effectively operates under a harem model whereby the better the stallion, the better the book of mares they receive. So whilst no-one can really argue that the best stallions aren’t deserving of the best mares, the gap according to the data between the top stallions and the good but not quite great ones is exaggerated; indeed, a more accurate reflection of a sire’s true quality would be one which analyses different sires when covering a similar calibre of mare. For example, one could use the same metrics as above but restrict the sample only to those dams who achieved blacktype on the racetrack themselves.\n\nHowever, I must also admit that the upshot of restricting the sample to a certain calibre of dam is a reduced sample size and with a reduced sample size comes greater variance. This greater variance leaves open the possibility that the data itself might be quite noisy rather than representing the true quality of a sire. However, this is a concern to be noted rather than a fatal defect and I still believe that restricting the sample size to a certain calibre of mare for the purpose of comparison would offer more insight than leaving the sample size unrestricted.\n\nSwitching back to the main argument, for as much as I prefer scaling the data by foals rather than runners, scaling the data by the latter still paints a relatively similar picture to the data scaled by foals. Cape Cross comes 5th in terms of winners to runners but falls to 8th for blacktype horses to runners, 7th for blacktype winners to runners, 8th for Group winners to runners, and 8th for G1 winners to runners. Much like the data scaled by foals, Cape Cross comes closer to the 10th-placed stallion than he does to the 4th-placed stallion even when we look just at the percentages rather than the ranking. Again, this is not to suggest that Cape Cross was a bad sire; he was unquestionably a good one. But what the above data shows is that Cape Cross was by and large a good stallion but not a great one in spite of his ability to somewhat sporadically throw racehorses right from the very top drawer."
