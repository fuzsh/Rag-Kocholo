        "text": "Dubai Duty Free (Gr.I), sponsored by Dubai Duty Free\n\nAustralia celebrated their first winner in Dubai when the Tony Vasil-trained Elvstroem made all to win the US$2,000,000 Dubai Duty Free (Gr.I), sponsored by Dubai Duty Free, over 1,777 metres on the turf.\n\nPartnered by Nash Rawiller, Elvstroem, set a steady pace with Whilly, trained by American Doug O’Neill, tracking in second. Elvstroem went clear 400 metres out and stayed on to win by two and three quarter lengths from Whilly with last year’s Dubai Duty Free (Gr.I) winner Right Approach in third.\n\nNash Rawiller and Elvstreom (Aus) win the Group I Dubai Duty Free (1800m) at Nad Al Sheba by 2 3/4L. Picture Duabi Racing Club.\n\nVasil said, “Great feeling to come all this way and have a win. It was a 17 ½ hour trip and he lost a bit of weight, but he has been here a week and has slowly picked up. To come all this way and win is a thrill. If ever there was a horse to come all this way with it is him. He has a wonderful temperament and easy going, he takes it all in his stride. He has done Australia proud.\n\n”We could look at the Lockinge Stakes in Britain in May and then perhaps Royal Ascot, we will take each race as it comes.”\n\nRawiller said, “My confidence grew before the race and he jumped well, it would have taken a great horse to have beaten him.”\n\nAlkaadhem, trained by Marcus Tregoning finished fourth and his jockey Richard Hills, said, “He ran a great race. They walked early and he ran bravely. The race just lacked a good pace and he ran well. I was really pleased with his effort.”\n\nFelipe Martinez, jockey of Whilly said, “I got him nice and relaxed. I thought he could go by the other horse at any time. I was just unlucky.”\n\nRoses in May takes the Cup - Dubai World Cup (Gr.I), sponsored by Emirates Airline\n\nRoses in May justified his favouritism by landing the world’s richest race, the US$6,000,000 Dubai World Cup (Gr.I), sponsored by Emirates Airline, by a convincing three lengths over 2,000 metres at Nad Al Sheba on Saturday evening.\n\nRoses in May became the 43rd international winner of the 2005 Dubai International Racing Carnival, which began on January 20th and culminated with the world’s richest racemeeting on Saturday. A total of 200 horses from 20 countries and representing 79 trainers came to Dubai to compete in the Carnival for a total of US$25,000,000 in prize-money.\n\nJohn Velazquez and Roses In May (USA) win the Group I Duabi World Cup (2000m) at Nad Al Sheba.\n\nRoses in May was in fifth place early with the field being taken along by the Mike de Kock-trained Yard-Arm. Roses in May, trained by Dale Romans and ridden by John Velazquez, came around the outside and took the lead into the straight and from that moment on there was no looking back.\n\nDynever, trained by Christophe Clement and ridden by Jose Santos, came with a late burst of speed to take second from the Jeff Mullins-trained Choctaw Nation, the mount of Victor Espinoza.\n\nGerard Butler’s Jack Sullivan ran the race of his life under Darryll Holland to take fourth ahead of the Dick Mandella-trained Congrats.\n\nRomans, “I thought the only way we could get beat was if we had some bad luck, I wanted to take the race to them, I knew he had the stamina and that no one else could catch him. I hope I can bring him back here next year, I love this nation.”\n\nWinning owner Ken Ramsey said, “I feel like I have climbed a mountain tonight. We knew our horse had so much stamina that if they wanted to run with him early they were not going to last “\n\nWinning jockey Velazquez quipped, “I hope this is the first of many.”\n\nClement said of runner-up Dynever, “He ran a great race I wish he would have won but the winner was a better horse and I am delighted with the way he ran.”\n\nPat Valenzuela aboard Lundy’s Liability who finished seventh said, “He just did not show much today, I could not even get him into the race early.”\n\nTyler Baze aboard Congrats, who finished fifth said, “He stumbled leaving the gates and cost us all position, that was the race right there. Going in he was the best looking horse in the race and I thought he would win we’ll get them next year.”\n\nHiroyuki Uchida, jockey on sixth placed Adjudi Mitsuo said, “It was not as fast a race as I thought, his start was not great but he gradually caught up the pace and managed to keep a good second position. It was a shame he couldn’t win but it was a good experience for us. The horse was quieter than usual.”\n\nVictor Espinoza on Choctaw Nation said, “He ran well. He got a little tired over the last sixth of a mile. I thought he was going to run second. I am really pleased with the way that he ran.”\n\nDarryll Holland on Jack Sullivan said, “I thought he was going to win half way down the straight. He just did not see it out.”\n\nDubai Kahayla Classic (Gr.I), sponsored by EMAAR\n\nMadjani, ridden by Willie Supple and trained by Gillian Duffield, took the lead coming into the straight and powered home to win the US$250,000 Dubai Kahayla Classic (Gr.I) over 2,000 metres for Purebred Arabians.\n\nDjelmane, trained by Doug Watson and ridden by Gaven Birrer, set the early pace but Madjani soon came past and crossed the line a length and a half clear of the Richard Hill’s partnered Al Saoudi with Velte in third.\n\nSupple commented, ““It was a tough decision for Richard (Hills), but I got lucky.\n\n“I was really impressed with this fella when I won on him at Abu Dhabi although he was beaten on his dirt debut, he was better drawn today and he was always travelling like a winner.”\n\nRichard Mullen, who finished third on Velte said, “His run an absolute cracker. We were always worried with the distance with him, and we were beaten by probably two of the best Arabs in Dubai.”\n\nGodolphin Mile (Gr.II), sponsored by Jebel Ali International Hotels.\n\nGrand Emporium, who was purchased by Sheikh Rashid bin Mohammed Al Maktoum a couple of days ago, was an impressive winner of the US$1,000,000 Godolphin Mile (Gr.II), sponsored by Jebel Ali International Hotels over 1,600 metres on the dirt.\n\nPartnered by Weichong Marwing and trained by Mike de Kock, Grand Emporium, a course and distance winner during the Dubai International Racing Carnival when claiming the first round of the Al Maktoum Challenge (Gr.II), tracked the leader in the early stages.\n\nAmerican raider Tsigane, set the pace under Pat Valenzuela, but Grand Emporium took up the running just over 200 metres from home, crossing the line a length and a quarter clear of the Frankie Dettori-partnered Qais with Tsigane in third.\n\nMarwing commented, “Everything went very smoothly. We thought he had a very good chance in this race. “\n\nDettori said of the runner-up Qais, “He ran brilliant. He went the same distance as the winner and was 4kg off.” (referring to the turn around in weights from the last start)\n\nAfter the race Valenzuela said, “He ran a great race. He kind of fell asleep and put his head across the bars in the starting gate. So I had to shake him but then he got the lead and he ran really well. He is a nice horse and he will win the Shoemaker Mile.”\n\nMichael Kinane aboard tenth place finisher Martillo commented, “The horse stumbled leaving the stalls and landed on his head.”\n\nAaron Gryder, jockey of Burnt Ember who finished in fourth place said, “He ran great. He didn’t break very well but as he went on he got stronger. I was very happy with him.”\n\nUAE Derby (Gr.II), sponsored by the Saeed & Mohammed Al Naboodah Group\n\nBlues and Royals, the mount of Kerrin McEvoy, regained Godolphin’s hold on the US$2,000,0000 UAE Derby (Gr.II), sponsored by Saeed & Mohammed Al Naboodah Group, over 1,800 metres on the dirt.\n\nGodolphin won this race in 2000, 2001 and 2002 but Mike de Kock claimed it for the next two years with Victory Moon in 2003 and Lundy’s Liability last year.\n\nShamardal, the mount of Frankie Dettori, set a cracking pace early on just ahead of the Kenneth McPeek-trained Durban Thunder, Blues and Royals was racing in sixth place on the rails. Shamardal began to weaken into the straight with Durban Thunder taking over the lead.\n\nKerrin McEovy and Blues And Royals (USA) win the Group I UAE Derby (1800m) at Nad Al Sheba.\n\nBlues and Royal, a son of Honour and Glory, came through on the rails to lead just over 200 metres out and was soon clear, running on to an easy 12 length victory from the Bobby Frankel-trained Marenostrum with the Ted Durcan-partnered Parole Board in third.\n\nNed Kelly, third to Parole Board in the Al Bastakiya – the second leg of the UAE Triple Crown, took fourth.\n\nSimon Crisford, racing manager for Godolphin, said, “We were surprised, we thought Shamardal would be the better horse tonight.\n\n“Shamardal has not been ruled out (for the Kentucky Derby). You can forget what you saw tonight.”\n\nCrisford said that it is possible that Blues And Royal, Shamardal and Parole Board are all still possible runners in the Kentucky Derby. With Parole Board possibly being transferred to Godolphin; the decision will be up to owner Sheikh Rashid Bin Mohamed Al Maktoum.\n\nDettori said of Shamardal, “He was too fresh and always going too fast. If he had have kept up that speed he would have been a motorbike not a racehorse – I just could never get him to relax and not surprisingly he didn’t get home.”\n\nPat Valenzuela said, “It was a good trip except for the winner.”\n\nDurcan on Parole Board said, “He settled really well and had the run of the race. I had Shamardal covered on the corner travelled really well. I have no excuses. He ran well.”\n\nDettori commented, “He was too fresh and always going too fast. If he had have kept up that speed he would have been a motorbike not a racehorse – I just could never get him to relax and not surprisingly he didn’t get home.”\n\nDubai Sheema Classic (Gr.I), sponsored by Dubai Waterfront\n\nPhoenix Reach claimed another overseas victory when landing the US$2,000,000 Dubai Sheema Classic (Gr.I), sponsored by Dubai Waterfront, over 2,400 metres on the turf.\n\nRazkalla, the mount of Kerrin McEvoy, set the pace, with the Hong Kong Vase (Gr.I) and Canadian International (Gr.I) winner Phoenix Reach, the mount of Martin Dwyer, came from virtually last with a great late run to take the lead just over 100 metres from the line to win by two lengths from Razkalla.\n\nCollier Hill, trained in Britain by Alan Swinbank, was always in the first four and ran on well in the closing stages to take third place, a short head from Razkalla,\n\nDwyer said, “I am over the moon, it was a great experience and come here and compete on world stage. “\n\nMike de Kock’s Greys Inn took fourth with the Aidan O’Brien-trained Powerscourt, the mount of Kieren Fallon in fifth.\n\nMcEvoy commented, “Razkalla is a very genuine horse. From the good draw we had a nice position. I wound him up on the turn and he kept giving. He was beaten by a proven Group One horse in Phoenix Reach.”\n\nMcKeown said, “It was a brilliant run by Collier Hill and it could hardly have gone better. Last time the ground was too fast and he was staying on this better ground. He got closer to Razkalla and if there had been even more ease in the turf I would have definitely run second.”\n\nFallon commented, “Powerscourt was tightened on the turn. He went OK; ran well.”\n\nPrix de l’Arc de Triomphe runner-up Cherry Mix finished a disappointing tenth and his jockey Frankie Dettori said, “He settled well but he was beaten before the turn. That was not his form. I think the horse just ran flat.”\n\nDubai Golden Shaheen (Gr.I), sponsored by Gulf News\n\nSaratoga County, trained in America by George Weaver and ridden by Javier Castellano, landed the world’s richest sprint race when claiming the US$2,000,000 Dubai Golden Shaheen (Gr.I), sponsored by Gulf News, over the straight 1,200 metres on the Nad Al Sheba dirt.\n\nSaratoga County raced in fifth early with the Brazilian-bred race favourite Pico Central setting the pace, Saratoga started making progress from the half way point and taking the lead 200 metres from home, running on to a length win over Tropical Star, trained by Ali Rashid Al Raihe, with Godolphin’s Botanical, under Frankie Dettori, in third.\n\nCastellano said after the race, “I waited for the right time to move. I always had a lot of confidence in this race.”\n\nWeaver, for who this was his biggest career win, said, “It doesn’t get any better than this. It is a big, big feeling.”\n\nRoyston French, who partnered Tropical Star to finish second said, “He ran really well. He’s a real trier and that’s half the battle.”\n\nPico Central’s jockey Alex Solis said, ““He didn’t get a hold of the track. He kept switching leads and just wasn’t himself today.\n\n“Right at the quarter pole My Cousin Matt and the winner (Saratoga County) came in on me. It cost me a better place, but I couldn’t win.”\n\nDettori said, “He ran a huge race, I am delighted with him. A huge performance.”\n\nWeichong Marwing who rode Conroy to finish tenth said, “He had a little trouble loading in but it was good enough for him. I had a good ride though probably other horses stronger for him.”\n\nPat Valenzuela aboard My Cousin Matt said, “He tracked Pico Central the whole way. He switched leads great, but when I needed him the last quarter of a mile he couldn’t go with the winner.”\n\nRACING IN DUBAI, UAE\n\nDUBAI RACING CLUB\n\nNAD AL SHEBA RACECOURSE\n\nSaturday, March 26th, 2005\n\nDirt.
