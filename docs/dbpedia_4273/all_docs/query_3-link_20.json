        "text": "Last Saturday, on one of the most memorable days of his life, Sir Michael Stoute could not contain himself. Usually, in the familiar glow of another victory, he prefers to slip away into the comforting shadows. He was different at Epsom. Stoute beamed and waved his hands in the air as if he could finally celebrate 38 years in the unsentimental business of training race horses, with Derby winners stretching from Shergar to the new champion, Workforce.\n\nWhen they called him to the winner's enclosure the normally elusive 64 year-old swirled his top hat high above him in unfettered delight. In that delicious moment, as he acknowledged his 15th English Classic victory, it was possible to imagine him as an exuberant teenager back in Barbados. It also felt imperative to remember again the extraordinary journey Stoute has made over the past 46 years.\n\nStoute left Barbados in 1964, aged 19 and having spent the previous three years as a schoolboy racing commentator moonlighting at the old island track of Garrison Savannah. He arrived in Britain with just one distant racing contact and yet, through perseverance and an uncanny talent, he has become a knighted giant of British racing, working with owners ranging from the Aga Khan to the Queen to Sir Alex Ferguson. He is now on course for his 11th champion trainer title.\n\nWorkforce's staggering run helps explain why Stoute, normally such a reluctant interviewee, should approach our meeting with a booming laugh and cheery wave. Inside his office at Freemason Lodge, the Newmarket yard where he trains more than 160 horses with a mastery that makes him one of the most fascinating figures in British sport, Stoute is even warmer.\n\n\"There have been a lot of sweet days,\" he says. \"But they become sweeter the longer you go on. Winning the Derby again was one of my most pleasurable days. It's still one of the greatest races in the world.\"\n\nBut the Derby also underlined the serious problems that now beset racing. Rather than being transfixed by an engaging storyline, featuring the venerable Stoute and the inexperienced Workforce, who ran the fastest Derby in history, the British public were indifferent. Despite no real competition from other televised sport, and a week before the World Cup, the BBC's viewing figures were down by a third on last year while betting revenues dropped between 10 and 20%.\n\n\"I'm obviously concerned,\" Stoute says. \"We're in a very worrying situation because public interest appears to be dwindling and there is a lot more competition for the punters' money. Prize money is dropping and the levy contribution [bookmakers' money paid into racing] is being reduced. In the early 1970s things were very tough but we have a really big worry today because we're in the midst of an economic climate that's darker than we can remember for a very long time.\n\nWhat can racing do to boost its waning appeal in such straitened times? \"We have to make it more attractive and one immediate answer is that Racing For Change have got to be encouraged,\" Stoute says, offering his support for the initiatives prompted by the collective of industry insiders who aim to galvanise an often badly promoted sport.\n\n\"None of us can be complacent. Racing For Change understand this and they're trying really hard. Obviously they don't have all the answers but they realise that they need to gather more facts and figures and meet the people that matter. My own worry is that we have too much racing. A lot of questions need to be asked – and we never seem to get any answers.\"\n\nRacing For Change have said they would investigate the possibility of moving the Derby to a Friday. Would this automatically revitalise the race? \"I'm not convinced it's that simple. I don't know the answer myself. We had a problem this year with a hyped-up horse, St Nicholas Abbey [trained by Aidan O'Brien]. Of course the press said he could be the successor to Sea The Stars [last year's magnificent multiple winner] because sometimes truly great horses come in twos.\"\n\nSt Nicholas Abbey finished a dismal sixth in last month's 2,000 Guineas, then suffered a slight injury and he was withdrawn from the Derby. \"Because the embryo champion didn't turn up,\" Stoute smiles thinly, \"people might have thought the Derby was anticlimactic.\"\n\nWorkforce, however, was electrifying – and another jolting reminder of Stoute's brilliance. \"His debut at Goodwood had been full of promise but he had a difficult spring. In his second race, at York, the bit came through his mouth when he straightened up. So we knew he had to show more maturity. An important part of his Derby preparation was a run-out at Lingfield where we got him to rattle down the hill and take that left-handed turn. I felt then he was ready. But none of us were expecting him to win the Derby by seven lengths.\"\n\nThat winning margin has been bettered by only two horses – one of which was Shergar in 1981. \"There was more relief than ecstasy with Shergar. He was so superior to the rest of the field that, if he'd lost, I would've felt I'd let Shergar down. I could enjoy it more with Workforce. He's a very exciting horse but the next race is really important. We need to think hard about whether he should go back 22 days later to the Curragh [for the Irish Derby] or do we hold him back for the King George?\"\n\nAccording to Stoute the latter is the more likely option. But there is a glint in his eye when he says: \"I'm sure we'll want to aim for the Arc in the autumn.\"\n\nStoute has won every other major race he cares about around the world – and, having clinched the St Leger with Conduit in 2008, at his 25th attempt, he lacks only the Arc de Triomphe. \"The Leger became a monkey on the back. I got to the stage where I said: 'The Leger? When is that?'\"\n\nStoute rocks with laughter until asked if the Arc has also begun to haunt him. \"We've run consistently well in the Arc and had so many placed horses. I try to feel philosophical about it but, yes, I would like to win it.\"\n\nSuch racing ambition deserves to be laid out in rich detail for the benefit of the wider sporting public. It's one obvious way of broadening the appeal of an often insular business for the horses themselves cannot sustain a compelling storyline. At the height of their powers they are retired to stud as the millions they can generate in the bloodstock business always outweigh the purity of sport. Stoute admits that he feels a growing responsibility to engage more with the media and public in an attempt to offset racing's deepening problems.\n\nBut why had he been so defensive in the past? \"I believe the horses should do the talking,\" he says eventually. \"The papers will ring for quotes from a trainer before a Listed race and you really should have them at the breakfast table the next day to see who talked the most rubbish. Nobody is going to say: 'I don't want to run this horse at York because the ground's unsuitable and the opposition is too tough – but the owner happens to live in Yorkshire and he's taking the family for a day out.'\"\n\nStoute's own early interest in commentating and journalism is intriguing when set against his racing persona. \"It was my ambition back in Barbados,\" he says. \"I thought I would be a journalist-cum-commentator. My mother took me to the track at Garrison Savannah and I was captivated by the colour and speed of the horses. But things really got going when my father was made deputy commissioner of police and we moved from the middle of the island to one of the Garrison houses. A ladder took you over the wall at the bottom of our yard onto the track.\n\n\"Unlike cricket, my other great love, there was no competition in becoming a race commentator. When I did a phantom commentary in the studio aged 16 there was no disquiet from the other gentlemen. If they had to come to the Garrison every race day to commentate they would have to do a lot of homework so they were very encouraging of me. In my school holidays I would go across to Trinidad and commentate for Radio Trinidad – with [the future ITN newsreader] Trevor McDonald. But Trevor was an all-rounder. He wasn't a racing man.\"\n\nStoute's sole racing contact in Britain was a retired jockey who had ridden for plantation owners in the Caribbean. \"My parents knew him and when I came to England he showed me this advertisement [for a BBC racing commentator's job]. I made it to the final six, incredibly, and we were invited to do some commentary at Newbury. We were all issued with tickets at Paddington and one of the six was [future BBC racing commentator] Julian Wilson. Five of us travelled together in second class but Julian decided he had better sit with the selectors and so he coughed up a bit more for a first-class ticket.\"\n\nThe portly trainer rolls in his seat with amusement as he remembers a day that had such ramifications for the future of British racing. If he had been successful he might have never gone into training and his lilting voice, which still carries echoes of Barbados, could have become a BBC institution. \"It was a foggy October day and visibility wasn't good. I started as the rank outsider because I did race six of six. But I had been commentating for three years and none of the others had done any commentary before. Julian got the job in the end. But they asked me to keep in touch and I did three more recordings. They saw me as a possible back-up if Peter Bromley broke his leg skiing.\"\n\nHe was ensconced, then, in the Yorkshire yard of trainer Pat Rohan. \"It was a wonderful grounding. You can go to a lot of yards and work your backside off and never really get inside a trainer's head. I got lucky. His secretary had just left and so I went into the office every evening after working all day in the stables. I became involved in Pat's thinking and conversation with owners.\"\n\nWithin four years Stoute had set up his own operation in Newmarket, with 15 horses, one of which was owned by his father. \"Sandal was my dad's only horse. I'll never forget it because it gave me my first winner at Newmarket. Oh, it was ecstasy. It won by a neck with all Lester Piggott's assistance. I knew Lester from my Rohan days.\"\n\nWas Piggott the stoneface of racing archetype? \"I saw the other side of Lester,\" Stoute cackles. \"He can be very communicative when he wants something.\"\n\nLater, when asked to name his most significant victories in a glittering career, Stoute returns to that Newmarket day in 1972. \"You cannot forget your first winner. That was a very special day. Only last year's King George, when we finished 1-2-3, with Conduit winning, ranks as highly. But perhaps the most significant of all was finishing 1-2 at the Breeders' Cup. Never mind the Leger – the Breeders' Cup was the one I wanted. That was a great, great day.\n\nA contrasting hurt clouds Stoute's face as he remembers Shergar's kidnapping by the IRA – and the recent revelation that he was probably machine-gunned to death after the ransom demand failed so abjectly. \"It was tragic. He was such a lovely horse, a great horse, and they made the terrible mistake of thinking he was owned just by the Aga Khan rather than an international syndicate. I knew it would end in a horror story – but I've closed the book on that pain.\"\n\nStoute's yard is humming again and he soon has us striding across his kingdom, pausing only to nuzzle a filly, Apace, for a photograph. His head is already full of next week's racing. \"Ascot is Test cricket all right,\" he shouts gleefully.\n\n\"Yeah, Guv,\" a stable hand agrees, \"there's none of that Twenty20 nonsense at Ascot.\"\n\nStoute even points to his most likely winner next week. \"Harbinger's a very good shot next Saturday. He wouldn't want the ground to be too fast but he's in with a real chance. Kingsgate Native is another I like on Tuesday in the King's Stand Stakes. But it's a tough ask for Ask in the Gold Cup.\"\n\nHe chuckles at his bad joke, before pointing out that, even in Ascot week, he will not be immune to World Cup fever. \"I started out following Brian Clough's teams,\" he says, grinning. \"I saw Cloughie at the 1970 World Cup and thought: 'This is a lunatic – but what a character!' I've been a Cloughie-man ever since. I'm also a Capello fan. He takes no nonsense and I think England will do well. I won't miss an England game for anything this month.\"\n\nThe rest of the time Stoute will be plotting yet more winners with a training technique that blends meticulous preparation and intuitive decision-making with an enduring ardour for his work. \"I've got a passion for the job,\" he says simply. Stoute stops in the middle of his yard to look around, almost in wonder, and all racing's problems suddenly seem redundant in the face of his winning exuberance."
