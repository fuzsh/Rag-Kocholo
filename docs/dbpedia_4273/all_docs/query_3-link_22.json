        "text": "What was your background before you became a racing groom?\n\nI started riding when I was about 9 years old at a local riding school after begging my mum for lessons like a dripping tap! Once I got the riding bug I joined the Cottesmore Hunt Pony Club where I took part in a variety of activities but soon realised that what I enjoyed the most was going fast in straight lines! From there I got introduced to polo which I loved and it gave me the chance to travel across the UK as part of a team taking part in the Pony Club Championships.\n\nIn my final year studying for my A Levels and applying to University to study Philosophy I realised that my heart just wasn’t in the route I was taking. I researched careers with horses and the British Racing School’s website popped up. Once I’d read about the racing industry that was it, there was no going back! Nothing else seemed to compare with the opportunity to work with racehorses, I knew I wanted to wake up every day and do something I loved for a living.\n\nWhat training did you have?\n\nI completed a 9 week Foundation Course at the British Racing School in Newmarket. I loved my time there and it was that first taste of working in racing that made me realise I was doing what I was really passionate about. I continued the rest of my training whilst working to gain my Level 2 Diploma in Work Based Racehorse Care.\n\nSir Michael has always been really supportive of any extra training I’ve wanted to do and so I went on to complete my Level 3 Diploma in Work Based Racehorse Care and Management. The skills I’ve learnt whilst training with the British Racing School have been invaluable to me and have given me the confidence to keep asking questions and try and improve my horsemanship.\n\nWhat do you do in your job?\n\nI had the opportunity to do lots of exciting things as part of my role such as travelling with horses to the races, going to the sales and breaking in yearlings. On a typical day though, I started by coming in early (sometimes as early as four in the morning!) to feed round the yard and check the horses’ legs. I then rode two or three horses ranging from two-year-olds to older horses which included galloping and stalls schooling. After riding out I completed medical treatments such as cleaning and bandaging wounds, icing and claying horses’ legs after fast work and working with the vets.\n\nSometimes I got the chance to watch the horses out on exercise, I loved seeing the horses from this perspective because you see everything coming together before they go to the races. I arrived early again for evening stables to check that the horses have eaten and drunk after exercise as well as to check for any injuries. I reported this information to the boss or the assistant trainer every day.\n\nSometimes the boss would look round the yard of an evening or would bring owners to see their horses so it’s important to make sure they are always looking their best.\n\nAt the end of 2018 I made the decision to pick up my studying again and work towards gaining my degree with the Open University. I am very lucky to be able to ride out for David Simcock in the mornings because, despite wanting to study again, I just can’t imagine my life without horses and riding out. I love being out on the Newmarket Heath first thing in the morning and riding thoroughbred racehorses up the gallops. It helps to blow away the cobwebs ready for an afternoon of reading and writing assignments! It is really interesting to see how another trainer and their yard operates. The brilliant thing about racing is that once you’ve invested any amount of time in the industry you will always be part of the community."
