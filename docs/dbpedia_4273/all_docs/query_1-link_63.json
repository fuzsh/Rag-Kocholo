        "text": "This was a very difficult list to compile. My late dad would never forgive me for not including the peerless Brigadier Gerard but he was before my time, for all I spent a childhood studying in a lounge overlooked by a watercolour of the great horse.\n\nSir Michael Stoute’s Shadeed and Zilzal both made a huge impression on me in my early years following the sport and along with Winx, who is only omitted because I followed her amazing achievements from afar, almost made it.\n\nEl Gran Senor produced one of the best performances I’ve seen at the trip when winning the 2000 Guineas but he was a one-hit wonder at the distance. That said, what a hit. His Newmarket victim Chief Singer, who carved out his own remarkable career, could easily have made the list too.\n\nBut I had to settle on seven. So here are my favourite milers - and we’d love yours too. Send all your comments to racingfeedback@sportinglife.com and we’ll print them at the foot of the story.\n\n1. Frankel\n\nWell it had to be didn’t it? And not for that 2000 Guineas win, which remains the most remarkable horse race I’ve ever seen, but the 2012 Queen Anne.\n\nNow there was a truly golden summer for British sport and much of the attention in the build-up to Royal Ascot had centred on Black Caviar, the star Australian sprinter who had travelled across the world to showcase her talents in the Golden Jubilee Stakes.\n\nThere was talk she was the greatest sprinter of all time, a mare who could light up the week in Berkshire. She’d have winced at such billing had she had a glimpse of the Queen Anne from her stable door.\n\nBecause in a strongly-run contest, Frankel produced the greatest mile performance of modern times. Travelling well behind stable companion Bullet Train, he was in front two out and engaged overdrive.\n\nAt the line he was a still widening 11 lengths clear of Excelebration, Tom Queally having a devil of a job to bring him to a halt afterwards. He went under 11 seconds for a furlong at least once during the race.\n\nIt was a far cry from his win in the St James’s Palace Stakes 12 months previously when he’d scrambled home from Zoffany, his keen nature seemingly on the verge of getting the better of him.\n\nIn the Queen Anne we had the professional Frankel, the finished article and a horse at the peak of his powers.\n\nHis dance card before he departed to the covering sheds at Juddmonte also included two wins in the Sussex Stakes, a Lockinge and a QEII triumph but this was his career-defining performance.\n\nOf course, others on the list were campaigned more adventurously, they took on and conquered the world.\n\nFrankel did all his racing in his own backyard but produced performances that will live forever. There are those who suggest Kingman was actually a better miler for Prince Khalid Abdullah.\n\nBut watch that Queen Anne – are you really saying he’d have not only gone with his illustrious predecessor through that final quarter mile, but also quickened past him?\n\nThere isn’t a miler who’s ever graced the turf who could have. That’s why he’s number one.\n\n2. Goldikova\n\nWhat a racehorse. 14 Group One victories including three successive triumphs in the Breeders' Cup Mile and four in the Prix Rothschild. There'll never be another like her.\n\nAs a three-year-old it was her first victory in the Deauville feature which marked her out as a rare talent, beating the Guineas winners Darjina and Natagora. They were again vanquished in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp a month later, as were star colts including Henrythenavigator.\n\nIt was to get better, despite being short of room for much of the Santa Anita straight, she found a turn of foot to win her first Breeders' Cup Mile in a matter of five strides at the sun-drenched furlong pole.\n\n2009 included a brilliant win in the Prix Jacques Le Marois, a second Rothschild and another Breeders' Cup Mile. Again things didn't fall right for her in Los Angeles. She found herself second last turning in and force to challenge five wide. Neither mattered as she thundered past Courageous Cat.\n\nShe was already a history maker before boarding the plane for the 2010 renewal, her victory in the Prix de la Foret carrying her past Miesque as the most successful mare in European Group Ones.\n\nShe soared past that brilliant French star's own Breeders' Cup landmark too, winning a third Mile at Churchill Downs, beating an American turf champion in Gio Ponti.\n\nIt was taken for granted that she'd deliver on the big day, she was that good. Whatever the continent, whatever the ground, however the race unfolded, Goldikova got the job done.\n\nConnections sportingly raced on at six and she added the fourth Rothschild and a Prix d'Ispahan to her CV but was touched off by Canford Cliffs in the Queen Anne and Dream Ahead in the Foret.\n\nThere was to be no fourth Breeders' Cup Mile either but she was carried out on her shield at Churchill Downs, finishing third behind shock winner Court Vision.\n\nAnd that was that. She retired to the paddocks after her incredible and historic big-race haul, earning a place in the American Hall of Fame along the way.\n\nA true superstar on both sides of the Atlantic her records will be safe for some time to come.\n\n3. Rock Of Gibraltar\n\nOne of the best colts ever trained by Aidan O’Brien. Forget the battle over ownership involving Sir Alex Ferguson and the Coolmore team and remember instead his brilliance on a racecourse.\n\nAs a two-year-old, following a debut defeat at the Curragh, he marched triumphantly through the Coventry Stakes, Railway Stakes, Gimcrack and Grand Criterion.\n\nThere was a defeat in his penultimate start, Dubai Destination cutting him down in receipt of four pounds in the Champagne at Doncaster. But he was clearly a top-flight performer with Classic pretentions.\n\nIt shows the regard Hawk Wing was held in that the Rock was a 9/1 chance, seemingly the stable second string, when reappearing in the 2000 Guineas. Many felt he was fortunate to win too under Johnny Murtagh as his Jamie Spencer-ridden stable companion found himself racing away from the key action in one of those races on the straight Newmarket mile that posed more questions than it did answered.\n\nThe rest of his career did that, though.\n\nMick Kinane was back in the saddle and victories followed in the Irish 2000 Guineas and St James’s Palace Stakes before he took on and beat his elders in the Sussex Stakes and Prix du Moulin.\n\nHe was a history marker, the first horse to win seven successive Group Ones, thriving on his racing. He was box office, everything you wanted in a miler, a colt who travelled strongly through his races and quickened on command. He just made it look so easy.\n\nAnd so to America and the Breeders’ Cup Mile at Arlington. The record books show he finished second, beaten three-quarters of a length, by Domedriver.\n\nBut Rock Of Gibraltar lost no caste in defeat. He met with traffic problems through a dramatic and tragic contest, with stablemate Landseer suffering fatal injuries when poised to throw down his challenge at the entrance to the straight.\n\nAt that stage, in a slowly-run race, the Rock found himself shuffled back to last place. It took a great colt to get as close to the winner as he did, grabbing the turf and slashing into the French raider’s advantage all the way to the line.\n\nHe was tough as well as talented, a remarkable winning machine and as good a miler as his brilliant trainer has ever handled - nearly as good a miler as anyone has ever handled.\n\n4. Miesque\n\nJust look at the CV.\n\nPrix de la Salamandre, Prix Marcel Boussac, English and French 1000 Guineas’, Prix du Moulin, Prix d’Ispahan and two victories apiece in the Prix Jacques Le Marois and Breeders’ Cup Mile.\n\nMiesque was one of the great milers.\n\nHer Guineas double in the spring of her three-year-old career was remarkable, her Breeders’ Cup double historic.\n\nShe had the ability to quicken at the end of a race, something Freddie Head utilised to devastating effect at Hollywood Park in the fall of 1987. She broke the track record in beating Show Dancer and Sonic Lady, a display that earned her the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Female Turf horse having already been crowned champion three-year-old filly in France and England.\n\nHer four-race career in 1988 featured a defeat of Warning in the Prix Jacques le Marois, victory in the Prix d’Ispahan and of course, a second Breeders’ Cup Mile.\n\nNo horse had previously gone back-to-back at the World Thoroughbred Championships but she achieved the feat in a deep heat. In against her were Warning, Belmont Stakes winner Bet Twice and Steinlen, who went on to land the prize 12 months later.\n\nThey never had a prayer as the brilliant Miesque sluiced home by four lengths on ground many close to her feared would blunt her speed.\n\nShe retired to the paddocks and wasn’t finished yet – her offspring including Kingmambo who carried the same Stavros Niarchos silks with such distinction.\n\nA trailblazing jet-setter who conquered America, Miesque was a true giant of the turf. She had to make this list.\n\n5. Kingman\n\nHow did he not win the 2000 Guineas? That’s the question that you keep coming back to with Kingman. Richard Mann probably hit the nail on the head with this article about the genius of Kieren Fallon. He enjoyed his finest hour aboard Night Of Thunder at Newmarket.\n\nThe rest of 2014 belonged to Kingman.\n\nThe Newmarket defeat was the only one in an eight-race career and subsequent Group One victories in the Irish Guineas, St James’s Palace Stakes, Sussex Stakes and Prix Jacques Le Marois marked him out as a true champion.\n\nJohn Gosden had been tempted to give the Curragh Classic a miss because of the rain-softened ground but stayed strong and was rewarded with a five lengths demolition of inferior rivals. At Ascot Night Of Thunder was back – and they were dancing to his tune as Richard Hughes set the fractions at the head of affairs.\n\nKingman was settled in midfield but with a clear shot at the hare and needed no second invitation to reel him in, producing a stunning change of gear to cut him old rival down and go clear inside the final furlong, despite jinking to the right. James Doyle raised a finger in triumph before the line but the best was yet to come.\n\nHis Sussex Stakes was one of the most fascinating tactical races I’ve seen. There was only a field of four and Darwin and defending champion Toronado set a sedate early gallop. Kingman settled but was out of his ground as the pace inevitably, and dramatically, quickened a furlong and a half out.\n\nFor a stride or two, just as he was trying to engage top gear, he became unbalanced. Doyle had to sit and wait to gather momentum before going again. Kingman had to show a sprinters’ acceleration to get the job done – and produced one. It was a stunning performance.\n\nHe was all about speed and displayed it again in the Prix Jacques Le Marois, a race run at a crawl for the first 200 metres. When they went through the gears in the final two furlongs Kingman had at least one more than his rivals.\n\nSadly, that was to be his last start after a throat infection ruled him out of an intended tilt at the Breeders’ Cup Mile.\n\nThe good news is the brilliance that shone so bright during that summer of 2014, is being passed on in spades to his sons and daughters.\n\n6. Warning\n\nA champion at two, three and four and a thrilling sight in full flight. That was Warning.\n\nHe was four from four as a juvenile, landing the Richmond and Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, but there were bumps in the road the following spring.\n\nThe first came in the Craven Stakes where what was expected to be a routine pipe-opener for the 2000 Guineas, ended in a four-length thumping at the hooves of subsequent Guineas winner Doyoun. He was found to be sick afterwards and the Guy Harwood team were forced to pull up stumps.\n\nIt was July before we saw him again and while he only won the Listed Bet With Tote Trophy at Lingfield by half-a-length, he was always doing enough and runner-up Salse went on to be a Group One performer in his own right.\n\nFor Warning the elevation to that level came in his next race – the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. The acid test was passed with flying colours, Pat Eddery’s mount producing a good turn of foot to beat Then Again by a length-and-a-half.\n\nDefeat followed in the Prix Jacques Le Marois – but few could master Miesque at her peak and the British raider did finish clear of the remainder in second in her backyard.\n\nHe then duly produced his own masterclass at Ascot, Salse again the victim, but this time the winning distance a widening five lengths in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. It was a stunning performance, right out of the top drawer.\n\nThe brilliance was missing behind Miesque in the Breeders’ Cup Mile, but connections opted to come back at four, although again he misfired on his reappearance. Sent off at 8/15 he was no match for Most Welcome in the Lockinge but redemption soon followed with a smooth-as-silk win over Reprimand in the Queen Anne. It was to be the last victory of his career.\n\nUpped in trip to ten furlongs for a Coral-Eclipse of the ages, he finished a tired and remote fourth behind Nashwan. Back to a mile for the Sussex Stakes, it seemed as though he was still feeling the effects when beating only two home.\n\nHe was a pale imitation of the colt who had shone so bright only two runs before and he was being freshened up for another tilt at the Breeders’ Cup Mile when an injury setback ended his career.\n\nEddery led the tributes to a “brilliant horse, an absolute top class miler” as he headed off for a new career at stud.\n\nHe did so having made his mark on the racecourse for three successive seasons. When he was good, Warning was very, very good. A strong traveller with push-button acceleration, just watch the 1988 QEII. That’s why he had to make this list.\n\n7. Selkirk\n\nThere was something particularly endearing about Selkirk, a strong travelling chestnut who formed such a formidable partnership with Ray Cochrane.\n\nTrained by Ian Balding and owned by George Strawbridge, he clearly didn’t hide his light under a bushel at Kingsclere.\n\nThe morning work was of sufficient quality to encourage connections to start him off in a Listed race as a two-year-old. The debut came in the appropriately named Stardom Stakes at Godwood in September. Sent off at 20/1, he came home four lengths clear of nearest pursuer Balaat, having sauntered to the front three out.\n\nIt was an exciting start and understandably tempted his team to roll the dice in a Group One on his only subsequent outing at two, finishing fourth behind Hector Protector in the Grand Criterium at Lonchamp.\n\nBut any Guineas pretensions were shelved in the spring when a troubled passage and two lengths defeat to Corrupt in the Easter Stakes at Kempton turned thoughts towards Epsom instead.\n\nThey ended when he hit the frame in both the Lingfield Derby Trial and Predominate at Goodwood. It all pointed to a good colt – but not one destined to be top class.\n\nEven the switch back to a mile and Cochrane in the plate for the first time failed to work the oracle in the Listed Royal Mail Stakes at Newcastle in June. The Racing Post close-up noted he “found nil” when headed, finishing a lacklustre fourth.\n\nBut there was a physical issue. An undescended testicle was limiting his movement and upon veterinary advice was removed. It led to an autumn transformation. Held up in the Fortune Stakes at Kempton, he showed a smart turn of foot to resume winning ways and book his place in the field of the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. At Ascot a star was born.\n\nAgain restrained through the early stages, he passed five rivals down the straight to claim a first top-level prize. He wasn’t passing trees either, left in his wake were some of the best milers around in Kooyonga, Shadayid and Second Set. It was a performance that led to him being crowned European champion at the distance by Timeform, an honour he was to be handed again 12 months later.\n\nThat campaign started with a Lockinge thrashing of Lahib and included smooth wins in the Celebration Mile and Challenge Stakes.\n\nIt also featured his nosebanded head being touched off by Marling after a brutal and mesmerising duel inside the final furlong of an engrossing Sussex Stakes.\n\nHe looked unlucky when barely seeing daylight as Lahib took his revenge in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and he never got rolling around the tight turns of Gulfstream Park in a Breeders’ Cup Mile swansong.\n\nBut it’s for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes win as a three-year-old, Lockinge romp at four and that Sussex Stakes humdinger with Marwell that I remember Selkirk. On his day he was a match for anything around.\n\nHe went on to carve out a very successful career at Lanwades Stud, his best offspring including Wince and Cityscape. Not bad for a horse who found himself at the cross-roads midway through his three-year-old career.\n\nSend in your favourite milers and other contributions to racingfeedback@sportinglife.com while if you’ve any ideas for more topics you want covering over the coming days and weeks, please let us know.\n\nFeedback from readers\n\nDave Chapman: What a way to end a series of articles that have entertained many of us through lockdown with the line PERFORMANCES THAT WILL LIVE FOREVER , I may only get 10 or 20 more yrs out of life but I for one will never forget Sir Henry and Frankel.\n\nDavid: A great contest and some wonderful milers in the list and also not in. Surprised that the best hasn't been mentioned by anyone yet - Dancing Brave. As described by Guy Harwood as Group 1 class at any distance between 6f and a mile and a half, his performance to win the 2000 Guineas was simply breath-taking. Walter Swinburn on Green Desert was quoted afterwards as saying that he was absolutely certain he was going to win as they came out of the dip but was passed by the Brave \"as if I was standing still\". He was going so fast, it looked like Greville Starkey was simply hanging on in the saddle ! As in the Arc, he showed top class sprinting speed at the end of all his races whatever the trip and, having watched racing for over 50 years, I have no doubt he's the best I've seen including over a mile - with the greatest respect to Frankel and (probably) Zafonic. And all owned by Khalid Abdullah - what an amazing owner / breeder.\n\nJohn Moran: Frankel was a great horse but his time figures were not all that impressive, suggesting that he was not beating very much. To claim as many do that he was the best of all time does a real disservice to the likes of Nijinsky who I saw in action. His turn of foot was spectacular, something his wonderful trainer M V O’Brien always looked for even in a jumper. He won over the full range of distances, excluding Gold Cup, Frankel never tried beyond 1 mile and 2.\n\nAs for Rock of Gibraltar the “perfect racehorse” was as handsome a TB as ever graced the turf. Beautiful horse in every way.\n\nAlan Farnsworth: Interesting debate. I note the subject is favourite milers, not necessarily best.\n\nEither way, for me, the top three are easy. I thought I’d never see the equal of the legendary Brigadier Gerard, from my secondary school days who slammed Mill Reef at Newmarket; no other justification needed. He’s closely followed by the magnificent Kris who somehow, got touched off in the 2000 Guineas, but surely would not have been beaten again if not for a serious muscle injury early in his four year season, however, 16-14-2-0 says it all (and not forgetting he sired Oh So Sharp).\n\nArrive Frankel, reset all benchmarks. The Greatest full stop, not just miler. Those suggesting he was over rated might perhaps reflect not only on his Guineas performance, but the Queen Anne, when he dismissed by 11 lengths, pushed by out hands and heels only and easing down, Excelebration, a champion miler himself and officially rated joint third best horse in the world that same season.\n\nIt’s a bit harder now, Miesque just probably shades Goldikova; Giant’s Causeway must be up there, with Canford Cliffs and Henry the Navigator. The one horse I believe to be over rated, despite his impressive record is Rock of Gibraltar, who I think got lucky in the 2000 Guineas and didn’t beat the best opposition subsequently.\n\nA mention too for a particular favourite of mine – maybe a shade behind these absolute top class stars over a mile and at his best over 7 furlongs – Paco Boy – a blistering turn of foot and a joy to watch; great little horse.\n\nFrankel\n\nBrigadier Gerard\n\nKris\n\nMiesque\n\n=Goldikova, Giant’s Causeway\n\nHenrythenavigator\n\nLeonard Robinson: A fascinating group of horses including Brigadier Gerard, Nureyev, Known Fact, Kris ,Frankel, Warning Rousillon, Miesque, Goldikova, Wise Dan and Giants Causeway. As unforgettable as Frankel’s Guineas victory wasmy vote must go to the ‘Brigadier’ just over Goldikova.\n\nJames Fairweather: Another great canter through some wonderful horses here.\n\nDon't generally disagree too markedly with most of these lists of what, after all, are favourite horses. However, Dave's favourite sprinters were basically about the 7 best, Lochsong perhaps apart, to have been trained in Britain over the past 30-odd years, and by and large, his milers seem to be going that way too, so....\n\nNo Zilzal? I know that Dave says that Michael Stoute's wonderful horse made a great impression on him but in that case, there's all the more reason to include him here, particularly as Warning, demonstrably Zilzal's inferior, rates a berth in the super seven. Those victories at Goodwood and Ascot of Zilzal, beating, among others, Polish Precedent, Warning, Shaadi, Distant Relative and Markofdistinction, who between them dominated G1 races over a mile for the year before and the year after Zilzal's great flourishing, were simply extraordinary.\n\nZilzal showed the ability to quicken twice that only the true greats possess. I would go so far as to say that no British-trained horse between the era of Brigadier Gerard and that of Frankel turned in more stunning displays over a mile, and third is where he sits in my pantheon of the greatest British milers since the War, ahead even of Tudor Ministrel, Kingman, Kris et al.\n\nStill thoroughly enjoy Dave's various articles on the greats, I hasten to add, and thanks so much for another wonderful one.\n\nLynden Kitchen: These lists always cause debate, between the generations. Both Brigadier Gerard and El Gran Senor beat the best 2000 Guineas fields....I am a massive fan of Frankel but he beat nothing at Newmarket, I know Roderic O'connor won Irsh 2000 but it was not a vintage year....that said Frankel destroyed them....this list is about the best milers, no where does it state best Guineas winner so in that case for returning at 4 and beyond and travelling the world i find it impossible to split Goldikova and Miesque.\n\nGH: Lets be serious! Frankel would occupy all seven positions. I heard Joe Mercer saying Brigadier would have beaten Frankel. Not one stood any chance. Frankel by a mile.\n\nRobert Bishop:\n\nBrigadier Gerard\n\nEl Gran Senor\n\nFrankel\n\nZafonic\n\nKev (East Yorks): For me it has to be Kris by a mile, excuse the pun. A brilliant horse\n\nThomas Pinto: I think on any list of top class milers old and new, one cannot take away from the accomplishments of the following horses who were superstars both at home and abroad Nijinsky, Zafonic, El Gran Senor, Miesque, Brigadier Gerard and Goldikova. Sorry Frankel fans i would not include him as i strongly feel that he is over rated.\n\nDave Chapman: I would give a top 3 as opposed to a top two. I reckon I would go NUMBER 3 Frankel NUMBER 2 Frankel followed (and this is after a hell of a lot of thought) at NUMBER 1 it would have to be Frankel.\n\nNeil Russell: For me it has to be Zafonic true champion at a mile\n\nRobert Thornton: Miesque from the 1980s has to be on the list. A brilliant French miler.\n\nResponsible gambling\n\nWe are committed in our support of responsible gambling.
