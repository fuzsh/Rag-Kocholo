        "text": "2 Year Olds\n\nFor such as talented trainer, he does not have the best strike rate with 2 year olds, particularly in the early months of the season:\n\n2 Year Old Debutants by Month\n\nMonthRunnersWinnersWin S/RP/L to SPA/EMay1100%-£11.000June2514%-£20.500.35July66710.61%-£23.170.82August1041110.58%-£19.750.85September1351511.11%-£41.580.85October1211915.70%-£10.521.24November4912.04%-£23.000.17December500-£5.000\n\n*A/E denotes actual number of winners divided by expected number of winners. A figure over 1 represents good value, anything under 1 is poor value.\n\nStoute tends to train backwards horses who get better with age, and therefore it is no surprise to see he hasn’t had a 2 year old runner before May in the last 10 years. In May-June, his horses are 1/36 when making their debut, and their performance from July-September, whilst acceptable in terms of strike rate, falls below market expectations, as the A/E for all of these months is well below 1.00.\n\nIn October, the strike rate of his 2 year old debutants improves significantly to 15.70%, and the A/E is also positive at 1.24.\n\nAt this time of year, Stoute tends to bring out his classy recruits who are potentials for the Classic races the following season, giving them racecourse experience before a winter break.\n\nWhen they are fancied in the market (first 3 in the betting), their record is fantastic; 17/59 (28.81%) for £28.48 LSP, giving an A/E of 1.54.\n\nFollowing on in November, the Newmarket trainer’s really backward horses tend to come out and his win record is very poor – just 1 winner from 49 runners.\n\nWhile Stoute’s first time out 2 year olds are far from prolific, the same cannot be said once they have had a run under their belt. When his horses did not win on debut, they are 68/242 (28.10%) at the second time of asking.\n\nThe following table shows how the performance varies by the break his runners are given between races:\n\n2nd Time Out 2 Year Olds (Did Not Win on Debut)\n\nDays Since Last RunRunnersWinnersWin S/RP/L to SPA/E8-1427518.52%-£16.320.7915-21722940.28%£7.111.2322-28541324.07%-£22.130.7629-42541527.78%£3.781.0943-5620525%-£7.950.7957-901317.69%-£7.000.3991-150200%-£2.000\n\nThose off for 15-21 days have an absolutely fantastic record of 29/72 (49.28%) for £7.11 LSP, giving an A/E of 1.23. 38 of those runners started favourite, and scored at a massive 60% win rate. They really seem to learn an awful lot from their debut runs and should always be respected second time out.\n\nSome trainers excel with 2 year old debutants over a particular distance. For instance, Richard Fahey is a wizard with juveniles over 5f. Looking at Stoute’s record:\n\n2 Year Old Debutants By Distance\n\nDistance (Furlongs)RunnersWinnersWin S/RP/L to SPA/E59111.11%-£4.500.506811012.35%-£31.600.8273213611.21%-£49.750.91810376.80%-£66.670.619200%-£2.000\n\nThe vast majority of his runners make their debut over 7f. There are plenty of these races in October, as the longer distances become available to the 2 year olds as the season progresses. He does much the best over 7f, and again, this is where his good ones are likely to be introduced.\n\nThe strike rate dips over 8f and the A/E is also poor – this is likely to be where Stoute runs his horses who will turn into real stayers as 3 year olds.\n\n3 Year Olds\n\nWith Sir Michael Stoute’s powerful connections and resources, he is able to give his immature and backwards horses plenty of time to find their feet before they are sent racing.\n\nAs such, he has had plenty of 3 year old debutants in the last 10 years, with results of 26/249 (10.44%) for loss of £-99.64, giving an A/E of 0.83 – again fairly moderate.\n\nStoute doesn’t put the gun to his horses head at home, and views them as longer term projects, so winning at the first time of asking, is not essential.\n\nThe success of Stoute’s second time out 3 year olds really depends on their market position:\n\n2nd Time Out 3 Year Olds (Did Not Win on Debut)\n\nSP RankRunnersWinnersWin S/RP/L to SPA/EFavourite1366144.85%-£7.570.99Not Favourtie221198.60%-£102.500.59\n\nThose who are market leaders win at a very high percentage, and win just about as often as they should based on odds. However, his runners who are not favourite, have a moderate strike rate, produce a big loss and a poor A/E.\n\nThere is perhaps a reason why those runners that aren’t fancied in the betting don’t do brilliantly – handicap marks. Stoute is a veteran and knows the importance of getting his runners well handicapped, and therefore he will often want three ‘quiet’ runs to get a favourable rating.\n\nHis thrice raced horses switching from maiden to handicap company are 28/127 (22.05%) for £20.03 LSP, A/E 1.24, providing good value."
