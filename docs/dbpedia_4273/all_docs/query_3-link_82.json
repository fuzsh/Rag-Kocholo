        "text": "Ever find yourself confounded by the conversation of the racing mad? Where is Manton? What is Darley? Who are the O’Briens? Where does Godsen train? Tatler has you covered with a guide to the best studs and yards around.\n\nManton Estate, Marlborough\n\nArguably one of the world’s finest and most successful racehorse training establishments, those who’ve read the book ‘The Masters of Manton’ by Paul Mathieu will know that the Manton estate is steeped in over 150 years of horse racing history. Renowned not just for its racing heritage, Manton‘s vistas have inspired many artists, including Sir Alfred Munnings. The equine artist once described Manton as ‘the best place in the world for horses, and men too’. Racehorses have been trained on the estate since 1860 and the stables have produced at least 50 winners of prestigious 'Classic' races; the first of these was Gang Forward, trained by Alec Taylor, who won the 1873 2000 Guineas Stakes. Later, in 1984, the estate was bought by entrepreneur Robert Sangster and has since been a training base for the likes of John Gosden, Barry Hills and Michael Dickinson. It is currently operated by Martyn Meade and Brian Meehan. The estate’s 2,200 acres provide some of the most magnificent facilities to train racehorses, with seven types of gallops including a Mile straight, Derby gallop, Kentucky Derby gallop and Peat other weatherproof gallops.\n\nWarren Place, Newmarket\n\nThis Newmarket training base was once synonymous with the late Sir Henry Cecil, who took over the running of Warren Place in 1976 from the trainer Sir Noel Murless. Cecil turned the stables into what soon became known as ‘the most glamorous yard in Europe’. The ten-time champion trainer trained from Warren Place from 1976 until his death in 2013, during which time the yard was home to champions such as Frankel – dubbed ‘the world’s greatest race horse’. After Cecil passed away, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (founder of the global thoroughbred breeding operation and horseracing team Godolphin), who owned many of the horses in training with Cecil, purchased the property from Lady Cecil. Among the facilities developed by Sheik Mohammed are 93 box stables and a 1.7 furlong exercise ring. Conveniently, the grounds of Warren Place back onto Charlie Appleby's base at Moulton Paddocks (another Godolphin stable).\n\nCheveley Park, Newmarket\n\nBuilt in 1341, several monarchs have owned Cheveley Park, including King Athelstan, King Canute, Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror, Edward I and Edward II. In 1740, the fifth Duke of Rutland established Cheveley Park as a thoroughbred centre, where he soon bred four winners of Classic races. Harry McCalmont purchased the estate in 1892 and added a large mansion, which was completed in 1898. The famed horse Isinglass was bred by McCalmont at the stud in 1890; his record-breaking winnings were not trumped by another horse until 1952 and his skeleton has stood in the National History Museum since his death in 1911. Now the oldest stud farm in Newmarket, Cheveley was bought and restored by David and Patricia Thompson in 1975. The stud now envelops almost 1,000 acres as an impressive establishment that embraces every element of modern racing.\n\nClarehaven Stables, Newmarket\n\nBuilt on the Bury Road, Clarehaven Stables was purchased by Sir David Robinson in the 1960s and became the foundation for his racing operation. Following his fortune in the radio and television rental business, Robinson set out to prove his theory that, given efficient business-like management, racehorse ownership could be made to pay. The results speak for themselves; the Robinson family backed their mare Clarehaven to win the Cesarewitch race at Newmarket, and after gambling large sums, used their winnings to buy the 17 acres and build the stables and house. Today, Clarehaven is the yard of British flat racing Champion Trainer, John Gosden. With a career stretching back to 1979, Gosden has trained over 3,000 winners worldwide, including current favourites Enable, Too Darn Hot and Stradivarius.\n\nBallydoyle, Racing Stable, County Tipperary, Ireland\n\nRacing is the most successful sport in Ireland and Vincent O'Brien's Ballydoyle has been instrumental to that accomplishment. The property was still a working farm when it was handpicked by O’Brien in 1950, but it is now seen by many racing experts as the finest training establishment in the world. First Vincent and now the unrelated Aidan O’Brien have sent out horses from this serene setting to win all the major races in Europe and the USA. In 1966, Vincent O’Brien received the Trainers’ Championship accolade and in 1996, Aiden O’Brien became Ireland’s youngest ever Champion Trainer, a title he has since held continuously since 1998. In 2001, he also became the youngest ever Champion British Trainer. Ballydoyle has undergone continuous development over the past sixty years and provides the very best grounds for horses to train on; the gallops have been created with special moss peat that adds a ‘cushion’ for when the grounds firm over summer months. A taxing process, it involved laying down thin layers of peat every year for 15 years before it was used for the first time.\n\nDarley Division at Dalham Hall Stud, Newmarket and Kildangan Stud, Kildare, Ireland\n\nA grade II listed country house and a 3,300 estate, Dalham Hall was originally purchased by former Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, Cecil Rhodes. After Rhodes’s death, the estate was sold in 1928 to Laurence Philipps, 1st Baron Milford, a shipping magnate and stud owner who turned the estate into Dalham Hall Stud. In 1981, Sheikh Mohammed purchased both the stud and the horse Great Nephew (sire of the famed Shergrar) – the only stallion stationed there at the time. Among the ten mares that came with the property was Oh So Fair, who was in foal to a filly that would one day grow into the successful racehorse, Oh So Sharp. Dalham Hall Stud was the first of the 12 studs in Newmarket that now form part of the Godolphin organisation. Under the Godolphin group, the stud was split in two; one part was used as a private stud for Godolphin mares and their progeny, and the other as a stallion unit, named the Darley Division. Dubai Millennium, Sheikh Mohammed’s favourite horse, was born and trained at Darley and went on to win the Dubai World Cup in 2000. Later, in 1986, Sheikh Mohammed founded Kildangan Stud in Ireland. Located on the grounds of Kildangan Castle, it is now home to the Irish-based Darley stallions and extends to almost 1,500 acres. The stud accommodates more than 400 horses and boasts a one-mile all-weather training track and extensive indoor riding arena for training both yearlings and older horses.\n\nStanley House, Godolphin Stables, Newmarket\n\nBuilt by Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, in 1903 and formerly known as Stanley House Stables, this racing establishment has since become one of the most famous in the world. An avid sportsman, Stanley was a Conservative Party politician who served as Colonial Secretary and was the sixth Governor General of Canada. Acquired by Sheikh Mohammed in 1988 and renamed by head trainer John Gosden, Stanley House now has the capacity for up to 115 horses. Steeped in racing history, framed horseshoes in the stables memorialise more than a century of winners. Today, Godolphin Stables is a state-of-the-art, progressive training yard with a swimming pool, sea walker, equine spas and private grass and all-weather proof gallops. The water-based training programmes allow the trainers to target different muscle groups in the horses by varying the depth and temperature of the water, while its salinity gives the pool powerful restorative properties. Godolphin horses based here have achieved many notable victories; among its residents have been the brilliant Shamardal, Dubawi, Rio De La Plata, Fantastic Light, Ramonti and the 2009 St Leger hero Mastery. The stables are also the summer base of trainer Saeed bin Suroor.\n\nMoulton Paddocks, Newmarket\n\nMoulton Paddocks has been part of the Godolphin story since 1994, and sent out 90 prestigious Group 1 race winners in its first decade. The yard is Godolphin’s second training yard in Newmarket and is operated by Charlie Appleby. Formerly known as Fidget Hall, the property has been home to many, but it was William Webber, surgeon and founder of the Norwich Royal Free Hospital, who added the yard in 1842. Webber carried out extensive work on the property and increased the size of the estate from 64 to 313 acres. With a racing pedigree that stretches back to the 19th century, this historic yard is now a highly advanced establishment; similar to Stanley House Stables, the yard comes complete with private grass and all-weather gallops, a swimming pool and an equine spa. Brass nameplates adorn the stable doors with the names of the stars that have raced out of the yard, including the great horses Dubai Millennium and Lammtarra.\n\nFreemason Lodge and Beechurst Stables, Newmarket\n\nFreemason Lodge and Beechurst Stables are the base of Sir Michael Stoute, a ten-time Champion Trainer with 25 Classic race wins in England and Ireland. Stoute trains more than 160 horses and is widely regarded as one of the most fascinating figures in British sport. The Queen is one of his stellar owners – in 2013 he won the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot on her behalf. Stoute trains from two separate yards, Freemason Lodge and Beech Hurst, positioned on either side of the busy Bury Road. The combined yard boasts the most incredible thoroughbred training facilities, including an indoor swimming pool."
