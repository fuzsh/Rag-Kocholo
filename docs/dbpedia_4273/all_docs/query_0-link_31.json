        "text": "Ryan Moore capped a remarkable week at the Chester May Festival as he partnered Cleveland to a thrilling win in the feature Chester Cup.\n\nMaking his handicap debut, Cleveland trailed favourite Coltrane but stormed home to take victory.\n\nIt was Moore's eighth winner from 11 rides at this week's festival and a first Chester Cup for Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien.\n\nBut O'Brien later said favourite Luxembourg is a doubt for the Derby.\n\nLuxembourg, who was third in Saturday's 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket, is now as big as 6-1 from 5-2 for the Epsom Classic on 4 June.\n\n\"Luxembourg was just a little bit lame on his off-hind this morning after cantering,\" said O'Brien.\n\n\"We're not sure why just yet, but wanted to let people know with the Derby coming soon.\n\n\"In a couple of days we'll hopefully know a bit more and will issue a further update.\"\n\nO'Brien's Chester Vase winner Changingoftheguard was cut to 6-1 from 10s for the Derby.\n\nMoore took a brave route in the two-and-a-quarter-mile Chester Cup, sticking to the inside rail on 6-1 chance Cleveland and sitting in the pack before angling out at the top of the finishing straight in search of a run.\n\nColtrane had already set sail for home but Cleveland - in just the Camelot colt's fifth career start - accelerated when he found space and shaded it by a neck on the line to give O'Brien a fifth winner in as many runners at Chester this week.\n\nRajinsky and Arcadian Sunrise finished third and fourth respectively.\n\nLast year's winner Falcon Eight, who was bidding to become the first back-to-back winner since Anak Pekan in 2005, finished fifth.\n\n\"He made a nice enough comeback over 10 furlongs, but the quicker ground today would have helped him,\" said Moore.\n\n\"He was still a little bit of a baby going around there, but he hasn't had many runs. We didn't have a lot of room, but he was able to pick his way through.\n\n\"I always felt like I was going to win if I could find the right gaps and got enough space.\n\n\"Maybe it wasn't the best Chester Cup ever run, but I'm delighted to have won.\"\n\nMoore also took the Huxley Stakes with Solid Stone, trained by Sir Michael Stoute.\n\nOn riding eight winners, including in all three Classic trials on O'Brien-trained horses, Moore added: \"It's been a good week, the horses have been running great, they have been all year in fairness and there's a lot to look forward to, hopefully.\""
