        "text": "Piggott made history as one of the greatest horse race jockeys of all time\n\nLily Waddell29 May 2022\n\nWorld-famous horse race jockey Lester Piggott has died at the age of 86.\n\nThe legend died in Switzerland on Sunday morning, his son-in-law and Derby-winning trainer William Haggas has confirmed.\n\n“Sadly we can confirm that Lester died peacefully in Switzerland this morning,” he said in a statement.\n\nHe was born in Wantage, Berkshire, on November 5 in 1935\n\nPA\n\n“I really don’t wish to add much more than that at this stage, although Maureen will be making a statement later.”\n\nPiggott made history as one of the greatest horse race jockeys of all time, including a record nine wins at Derby.\n\nHe was born in Wantage, Berkshire, on November 5 in 1935.\n\nAlready his family had great success with racing - his dad Keith was a trained Grand National winner, his grandfather Ernest rode to victory three times in the great steeplechase and his mother Iris was the daughter of Classic-winning jockey Fred Rickaby.\n\nImpressively a young Piggott rode his first winner The Chase at Haydock in 1948 when he was just 12 years of age.\n\nPiggott (pictured centre) had nine Derby victories\n\nPA\n\nThe last win came with Palacegate Jack at the same Merseyside track in 1994, a few weeks short of Piggott’s 59th birthday.\n\nFollowing his success, he retired for a final time in 1995.\n\nPiggott first won the Derby in 1954 aboard Never Say Die and he went onto win it eight more times, making history.\n\nHis glittering career also saw him achieve 116 Royal Ascot victories.\n\nHe was also named champion jockey 11 times between 1960 and 1982.\n\nRacing stars paid tribute to the legend following the news of his death.\n\nIn tribute, Willie Carson - who together with Piggott held sway on the track in the 1970s and 80s - said it felt like pat of him had died with the racing icon.\n\nRead More\n\nHarry and Britney go head-to-head for British Book Awards prize\n\nTrain firm admits ‘still work to be done’ to recruit more women\n\nSouth Western Railway launches campaign to highlight impact of verbal abuse\n\nSponsored\n\nMeet the fitness influencer defying stereotypes about ageing\n\n“I feel as though I have lost part of my life in way, as Lester has been part of my life ever since I came into racing,” said an emotional Carson.\n\n“I came to his in-laws as an apprentice and he was part of my life right from the word go, until the end. He was an iconic figure in the horse racing world. He is a legend.\n\n“We had the luck of some ding-dongs on the track and he was a person who made us all better – because we had to be better to beat him. We had to up our game to compete with him, because he was so magical on top of a horse.\n\n“It is so sad. Part of my life has gone – that is how I feel.”\n\nItalian jockey Frankie Dettori said: “Lester was a hero of mine and a good friend. The impact he has made in racing, on all of us, is second to none.\n\n“I will always try to remember him for the good things and I offer my sincere condolences to his family and his many friends.\n\n“He was a legend. We always tried to aspire to be like him and none of us can do it.”\n\nRod Street, chief executive of Great British Racing said: “Lester was a true titan of sport, a one off who transcended horse racing. To this very day, the top answer to ‘name a famous jockey’ remains Lester Piggott.\n\n“Enigmatic and reserved, it was on the track that he did his talking, with nine Derby wins among his 30 British Classics together with 11 champion jockey titles. He matched a fiercely competitive spirit with genius horsemanship and was revered by millions.\n\n“It was only fitting that he became the first person to be inducted into Flat racing’s Qipco British Champions Series Hall of Fame last year. We will be forever grateful for the indelible contribution he made to British horse racing.”\n\nKey moments in his career:\n\nLester Piggott (right)\n\nPA\n\n1948: Piggott, aged 12, has his first ride in public on The Chase at Salisbury on April 7.
