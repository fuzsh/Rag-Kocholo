        "text": "There were two Hors La Loi knocking around at the same time: The good one with a (FRA) suffix trained by Martin Pipe & James Fanshawe and a not so good one trained by Ian Williams (?)\n\nThere was definitely a horse called Norfolkandchance running in the late 80s or early 90s.\n\nYou really start to feel old in this game when a familiar racehorse name gets reused. Which current runners bring back memories of a notable namesake?\n\nI’ll start with Godolphin’s unbeaten Golden Goal (IRE), who made me think of Golden Goal (GER). The German version was a useful jumper for Venetia Williams and Favourites Racing in the early 2000s, winning the Pendil and the Scilly Isles in a lucrative novice season. He is listed as ‘Died as a 7yo’ on the RP database, apparently lost in training in 2003.\n\nIts sacrilege when the authorities allow the reuse of a famous name. For example there is currently an Irish jumper trained by Noel Meade called Thomond. An earlier horse of that name was twice second in the Cheltenham Gold Cup (1933 & 1935) and twice third in the Grand National (1934 & 1935). Thankfully such instances are rare these days, perhaps this one slipped through.\n\nYou really start to feel old in this game when a familiar racehorse name gets reused.

Would have been no danger with the fences they have their now.\n\nThere are hundreds of second comings unfortunately, Connaught Ranger made his debut last Monday while Gainsay had his second run on the same day.\n\nA James Fanshawe horse called Ptarmigan Ridge has started racing this year.\n\nI remember the original Ptarmigan Ridge – an honest sprint handicapper who won 8 times from 89 starts. Active 1998 to 2007 without missing any long block of time through injury.\n\nWinning SPs of 40-1, 14-1, 6-1, 10-1, 14-1, 12-1 and 25-1! Sadly put down after his final start aged 12 after sustaining a fracture. Was still an entire and was set to become a stallion for riding horses.\n\nHow about GABR????\n\nBred in 1990 and trained by Robert Armstrong\n\nbred in 2015 and trained by Sir Michael Stoute.\n\nBoth times it is Hamdan-Al-Maktoum owned.\n\nSadly I’m old enough to remember the first one!\n\nthe latest incarnation looks like he’ll be quite good as well if his first run is anything to go by."
