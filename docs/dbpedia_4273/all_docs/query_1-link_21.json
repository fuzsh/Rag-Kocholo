        "text": "Foaled 1967 Bay Horse Deceased 1992\n\nRuns: 13 Wins: 11 Places: 2 Earned: $677,177\n\nForm: 1111 - 111111122\n\nTimeform Rating: 140\n\n15th Ever Triple Crown Winner\n\nChampion 2yo 1969\n\nRailway Stakes 1969\n\nBeresford Stakes 1969\n\nAngeles Stakes 1969\n\nDewhurst Stakes 1969\n\nGladness Stakes 1970\n\nEnglish 2000 Guineas 1970\n\nEnglish Derby 1970\n\nIrish Derby 1970\n\nKing George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes 1970\n\nNijinsky was a very difficult horse temperamentally and had to be handled with the greatest patience by all who worked closely with him. He had his own ideas about life and would often rear up, sweat profusely and on ocassions refuse point blank to canter. He also had a vivid dislike for starting stalls.\n\nIt wasn't just his own age group that suffered at Nijinsky's hooves as he bettered a vintage crop of elders in the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes, including English Derby winner Blakeney, Coronation Cup winner Caliban, Italian Derby winner Hogarth, French Oaks winner Crepellana and Washington International winner Karabas. Ascot has never before or sinces witnessed a field demolished in such easy fashion, with the great Nijinsky making top class horses look like mere trainers hacks.\n\nIn August of that year (1970) Nijinsky became sick again with a bout of ringworm which set him back several weeks in his training for the St Leger, although of course this didn't worry the great horse too much and he duly won by a length on the bridle, thus cementing his now legendary status into the hearts of racegoers everwhere, forever.\n\nSadly the great horse ended his career with two defeats. The first came in the Arc de Triompe where he was beaten a head by the French Derby & French St Leger winner Sassafras, having been denied a run on several occassions in the closing stages. His jockey, the usually brillant Lester Piggot has been criticised for leaving Nijinsky with too much to do ever since as he defied trainer's orders to lie up with the pace rather than come from behind. I for one certainly wouldn't have argued with the phenomonal Vincent O'Brien, the original master of Ballydoyle.\n\nVincent rightly wanted his colt to end his career on a high so Nijinsky's swansong was in the aptly named Champion Stakes at Newmarket. However someone did not read the script and so it was that Lorenzaccio took the race by 1 1/2L from Nijinsky who must surely by now have been feeling the effects of a long, hard season, his battles with illnesses and of course many miles of travelling.\n\nNijinsky retired to Claiborne Farm in Kentucky in 1970 having been syndicated for $5.5million which was a record sum for the time. His success story continued at stud as he's sired Lammtaara 1995 English Derby, Arc & King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner, Shahrastani 1986 English & Irish Derby winner, Golden Fleece 1982 English Derby winner, Ferdinand 1986 Kentucky Derby winner, Ile de Bourbon 1978 King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner, Royal Acadamy 1991 Breeders Cup winner, Shadeed 1985 2000 Guineas winner, King's Lake 1981 Irish 2000 Guineas winner, Caerlon French Derby winner and Green Dancer who is a proflic sire himself. In 1992 Nijinsky sadly passed away at the age of 25, which is a grand age for a thoroughbred.\n\nIn 1976 Nijinsky entered the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. He was also honoured in Ireland too with a lifesize bronze statue placed at The Curragh racecourse. Nowadays he has a race; the Nijinsky Stakes held at Woodbine, Canada, named in his honour to serve as a permanant reminder to Canada's greatest equine export."
