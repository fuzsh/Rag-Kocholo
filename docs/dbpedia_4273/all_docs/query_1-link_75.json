        "text": "THE racing and breeding world was coming to terms on Thursday with the loss of one of its greatest supporters after it was announced that Sheik Maktoum Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai and one of the world's most prolific racehorse owners, had died.\n\nThe Sheik, who was 62 and is believed to have suffered a heart attack while visiting the Gold Coast for the Magic Millions sales, was the eldest of the four Maktoum brothers and head of the ruling family.\n\nHe will be credited, along with his brothers Sheik Mohammed, who becomes the new ruler, Sheik Hamdan and, the fourth brother, Sheik Ahmed, with revolutionising flat racing the world over. When they appeared on the scene a quarter of a century ago, their deep love of and enthusiasm for the horse was more than matched by the depth of their pockets.\n\nIt was immediately clear they were in racing for the long term, with the steady acquisition of some of the world's finest bloodstock lines along with the studs and stables to go with them.\n\nSheik Maktoum's racing and breeding operation, the headquarters of which are at Gainsborough Stud near Newbury, Berkshire, had horses with more than 10 trainers around the world. The Maktoums also own Darley Stud in the Hunter Valley, which has had many winners in its famous maroon and white colours.\n\nSheik Maktoum was also an integral part of Godolphin, which was set up as a racing entity for the brothers, although managed by Sheik Mohammed.\n\nWhile Godolphin has enjoyed only limited success in many Australian forays, Sheik Hamdan has enjoyed extraordinary success winning many races including Melbourne Cups with At Talaq and Jeune, which died on Wednesday, and a Cox Plate with Almaarad. Some of the best of the hundreds of horses to carry Godolphin's famous blue colours include Fantastic Light, Cadeaux Genereux, Shadeed, Shareef Dancer, Royal Applause, Green Dancer, Court Masterpiece, Lailani and Hatoof.\n\nSheik Maktoum won both English Guineas, the Oaks, St Leger but not the Derby, although perhaps his greatest individual success was breeding the unbeaten Derby, King George and Arc winner Lammtarra, which ran in the colours of one of his sons, Saeed Maktoum Al Maktoum.\n\nThe Godolphin racing and breeding empire now stretches over four continents, has up to 1000 horses in training, employs five full-time trainers and a small army of staff.\n\nWhile enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the sport, he had a slightly lower profile than Sheik Mohammed and Sheik Hamdan when racing, partly because his English was not as extensive, and television interviews with him were rare. However, if you were to ask anyone who met him they would tell you that he was one of the most charming, kind men in the sport and a pleasure to be around."
