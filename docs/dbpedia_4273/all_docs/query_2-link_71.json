        "text": "The King has employed the services of Ralph Beckett to train a number of racehorses for the upcoming flat season.\n\nMr Beckett, who is based at his yard in Andover, has never trained horses in the famous scarlet and purple royal silks before.\n\nHowever, prior to him ascending the throne, Charles had a number of horses in training with Mr Beckett along with the then Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nTheir Majesties have decided to continue using his services following an already successful 15 year partnership.\n\nBack in 2008 when it was first announced that he was to train horses for Charles & Camilla, Mr Beckett said: “It was a bit of a shock… I did a double-take. It’s a real honour and very exciting.”\n\nAccording to the Racing Post, the King has sent Mr Beckett four juveniles which were bred by the late Queen Elizabeth at the Royal Stud at Sandringham.\n\nAmongst the young horses in his care is a full sister to King’s Lynn – one of the late Queen’s most exciting horses of recent times.\n\nIt was reported late last year that The King was to reduce the number of racehorse trainers in the royal roster.\n\nAt the time of her death, Queen Elizabeth used the services of nine trainers: Sir Michael Stoute, John & Thady Gosden, William Haggas, Andrew Balding, Harry & Roger Charlton, Michael Bell, Richard Hughes, Clive Cox and Nicky Henderson.\n\nIt is unknown how many of these will continue to train horses for the monarch in the years to come if indeed The King is planning to scale down his racing operations.\n\nShortly after her death in September, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “Queen Elizabeth’s great personal interest in horse racing was one of Her Majesty’s lifelong passions and the King is delighted to honour Her legacy.”"
