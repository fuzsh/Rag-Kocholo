        "text": "Racing HQ\n\nThe historic market town, situated in Suffolk on the border with Cambridgeshire, serves as Flat racing’s headquarters.\n\nMore than 3,000 horses are stabled in Newmarket – one for every five residents ‐ spread among around 70 trainers. Both of Godolphin’s British‐based trainers – Charlie Appleby and Saeed bin Suroor – have their yards located in the town along with the sport’s top names including John and Thady Gosden, Sir Michael Stoute and William Haggas.\n\nThe town is home to two racecourses. The Rowley Mile, where this weekend’s three‐day Qipco Guineas Festival will be held, and the July Course, which is used throughout the summer months.\n\nSome of the country’s top studs are also located in and around Newmarket.\n\nThe National Stud is one of more than 60 studs breeding some of the world’s finest racehorses. It is estimated one in three people employed in Newmarket is connected to the sport in some way.\n\nRacing is stamped on the brickwork of nearly every building. Whether it’s the historic Jockey Club Rooms, the National Horseracing Museum, the British Racing School, the saddlery shops or the pubs and hotels, with pictures of the racing greats hung on every wall, the impact of the sport is unmistakable.\n\nTo walk down Newmarket High Street on Guineas weekend is to rub shoulders with every facet of racing’s spectrum. From some of the most\n\nEquine History\n\nFrom some of the most powerful owner/breeders and the greatest trainers to stable staff and weekend punters. It is a melting pot of incredible proportions with a unique atmosphere and its connection with racing dates back more than 800 years.\n\nKing James I greatly increased the popularity of horseracing and it led to the first ‘cup’ race being held in 1634.\n\nThe heathland surrounding the town, where many of the famous gallops are situated, is thought to be the largest expanse of cultivated heathland in the world. It would not exist if it wasn’t for the thousands of racehorses that use that land to hone their fitness.\n\nSome of the gallops are dissected by the Devil’s Dyke. The ancient Saxon earth mound runs between the two racecourses. It was originally built as a defensive structure but now a footpath sits on top of it offering spectacular views across the heath. The dyke is not the only evidence of ancient dwellings.\n\nThe Icknield Way, thought to be the oldest road in Britain, runs through Newmarket. Coincidentally, there is evidence of the same road near to another of the great training centres in Lambourn.\n\nA Truly Unique Town\n\nThe modern‐day walkways in Newmarket are adorned with racing tributes. The pavements around the High Street are set with plaques commemorating some of the racing greats to have made Newmarket their home down the years.\n\nThere are several statues making it clear the main focus of the town but one of them remembers the work of a man who played a hugely‐important role in World War II.\n\nNext to the Rutland Arms Hotel is a memorial of Bill Tutte. He was born at Fitzroy House Stables, now home to Michael Bell, where his parents worked and he was instrumental in cracking some of the Nazi’s codes while based at Bletchley Park.\n\nNewmarket is also known for its specialty sausages. They have protected status meaning only three local butchers are entitled to produce them. The winner of the Newmarket Town Plate, a race first held in 1666, receives some of the sausages as a prize.\n\nNo matter where you look in Newmarket there is a racing influence.\n\nIt’s an utterly‐unique town and a must‐visit destination for every racing fan"
