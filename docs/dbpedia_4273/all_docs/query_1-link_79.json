        "meta_description": "Pebbles (27 February 1981–9 September 2005) was a British-bred Thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career which lasted from 1983 until 1985, she ran fifteen times and won eight races. After showing good form as a two-year-old in 1983, she won the 1000 Guineas as a three-year-old the next spring. In 1985 Pebbles produced her most notable performances, becoming the first filly to win the Eclipse Stakes and then defeating an exceptionally strong field in the Champion Stakes. On her final racecourse appearance she became the first British-trained racehorse to win a Breeders' Cup race, when she won the Breeders' Cup Turf. She is regarded as one of the greatest fillies of the modern era.",
