        "text": "Baaeed received his final honours for his incredible deeds on the racetrack, crowned Horse of the Year and Older Horse of the Year at the 32nd Cartier Racing Awards on Wednesday night (UK time).\n\nBaaeed became the first horse owned by Shadwell to claim Horse of the Year honours, gaining the nod ahead of Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Alpinista, who has won her past six starts at Group 1 level, including three during 2022.\n\nOther nominees for Horse of the Year honours were Kyprios and Highfield Princess, who won the categories of Champion Stayer and Champion Sprinter respectively.\n\nThe William Haggas-trained Baaeed also shaded Alpinista in the Champion Older Horse category, along with Kinross and Bay Bridge. The latter had been the only horse to beat Baaeed, at his final start in the G1 British Champion Stakes on October 15.\n\nBaaeed was retired following the Champion Stakes, having won 10 of his 11 starts, and will stand at Shadwell's Nunnery Stud for Â£80,000 (approximately A$140,000) in 2023.\n\nEuropean horseracing's top awards are delivered through a combination of points earned by horses in Stakes races (30 per cent), combined at the end of the season with the opinions of a panel of racing journalists and handicappers (35 per cent), plus votes from readers of Racing Post and Britain's Daily Telegraph (35 per cent).\n\nWhile Alpinista was unable to land any of the equine awards, her breeder and owner Kirsten Rausing was recognised by a panel of 16 judges for the Cartier/Daily Telegraph Award of Merit.\n\nThe award is given to a person, who in the opinion of the selectors, has done the most for European racing and or breeding, either over their lifetime or within the past 12 months.\n\nRausing, who was the breeder of this year's Caulfield Cup winner Durston, joins an honour roll which includes Sir Michael Stoute, Aidan O'Brien, John Gosden and the late Pat Smullen.\n\n2022 Cartier Racing Awards winners:"
