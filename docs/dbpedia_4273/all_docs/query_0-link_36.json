        "text": "18th May 2024\n\nFollowing my Bletherings of 3rd May I saw a number of posts on social media from the Sun racing team in which they claimed that their coverage of racing was as extensive as ever. They then sent me a copy of their 16-page 2,000 Guineas Special. I don’t actually know what the Sun racing coverage looked like on Guineas day 30 years ago but I doubt if there was any more than this. I was impressed. I hope they keep it up.\n\n17th May 2024\n\nSecond sucks! The horses are running well but keep hitting the post. A treble of seconds at Hamilton tonight.\n\nWe have had very few horses working on the grass this year as it has been so wet but Charlie bit the bullet this morning and had quite a few galloping, or cantering upsides, on our ‘North’ gallop. It was great to watch them but, unfortunately, it is still soft. We have no watering system here so that ground is what nature has given us and, sadly, it is soft. It is, therefore, very hard to imagine that Thirsk, just 20 miles away, can need to water. I’ll go to Thirsk tomorrow, where we have one runner, and I’ll be very surprised if it is any firmer than Good-Soft (soft on the bends). We’ll see.\n\nI went to Newmarket today and Stuart Williams had the result of the 1994 Dante Stakes, in which Mister Baileys finished third behind Erhaab, on his phone. He pointed out to me that the race was run on firm ground and he was wondering how many, if any, of yesterday’s line up would have stood their ground in the going was described as firm. It highlights the fact that much of the issue of clerks of courses overwatering tracks is a result of pressure from trainers.\n\nIt was interesting to look back at that result but it wasn’t the fast ground that caught my attention, it was the prize-money. The winner received £73,884. Thirty years on, the winner of yesterday’s race received £108,996. According to the Bank of England’s inflation calculator, that should have been £150,132 if prize-money had just risen in line with inflation. We are constantly told that York has better prize-money than any course in the country and I would have liked to think that they would ensure that one of their flagship races, the Dante Stakes, would receive prize-money commensurate with its international reputation. Has British racing really declined so far? Is it any wonder that we have small fields?\n\n14th May 2024 12.31am\n\nIt is just after midnight and I have just calved a cow for the first time in a very long time. Maybe 38 years or not far off it. At 10.15pm, Mikaelle, our right hand (and left hand, come to think of it) woman came to tell me that her ‘Moocall’ ( a device fitted to the cow’s tail which, hopefully, warns of imminent calving) had gone off and that one of our heifers was calving. She watched on CCTV for a while but, as the Moocall told her that their had been ‘activity’ for the last two hours, we thought we better go and have a look.\n\nThe cows live at Friar Ings Stud, seven miles from Middleham, and by the time we got there we could see one hoof protruding and not a lot happening. We moved the heifer into a calving pen and, to cut a long story short, delivered a live calf about an hour later. I used to do quite a bit of this for a short period of my life prior to becoming a trainer and there is no feeling of job satisfaction quite like it. I’ve always said, it’s better than a winner. It was the part of veterinary practice that I enjoyed most. I didn’t do many foalings but plenty calvings and lambings and tonight brought back some great memories. I still got a kick out of it.\n\nThe night calls were the best. Waking and getting out of bed could be tough and the drive to the farm was spent wondering how long a job it was going to be and if I’d be resorting to a caesarean, but when it was over, if all went well and there was a live cow and calf in the shed, sitting in the farmhouse drinking tea and eating cake, there is no feeling like it. It struck me tonight that many of the younger members of my profession, maybe the majority, obsessed as they are with the modern view of ‘work life balance’, will never have that pleasure. They are missing the best bit.\n\n8th May 2024\n\nIt has started already. Despite an extraordinarily wet winter and spring, with numerous turf meeting abandoned and small fields due to soft ground, clerks of courses are ignoring BHA instructions and watering to aim for ground softer than the optimum agreed for flat racing. The clerk of the course at Chester, a notoriously soft track, is watering on ground currently described as good and has openly admitted to Charlie that he is not aiming for Good-Firm ground.\n\nYet again we see that we have a toothless administrator in the BHA and they allow racecourses carte blanche to do as they please. I have been complaining about this for decades, ever since the rules, which previously only permitted watering to grow grass and not to change the natural state of the going (and were enforced), were changed. I have often sympathised with clerks of the courses as they are, at times, driven by trainer preferences and this is, in turn, influenced by an illogical going scale where the optimum ground is described as ‘Good-Firm’ rather than ‘Good’. It is down to the BHA to change the scale to remove the anomaly of the optimum ground conditions being described as something other than good and make rules that they intend to enforce.\n\n3rd May 2024\n\nTomorrow is 2000 Guineas day and Tuesday 30th April, just past, was the 30th anniversary of Mister Baileys wining the race. To mark the occasion Rosie Venner organised a lunch, hosted by Baileys Horse Feeds, at the restaurant 47 in Rayne near Petches Farm where Mister Baileys was raised and eventually saw out his days.\n\nDeirdre and I attended and had a fantastic time with about 20 of the Venner and Knowles families (partners in Baileys Horse Feeds) and a few others who were with us on the day, including Ron and Norma Huggins whose Double Blue won the next race. Many wonderful stories of the time were told, Paul said a few words, in particular about those who were involved and are no longer with us, and I recited the poem written by my late sister Lyn and published in the Sporting Life on the Saturday after the race.\n\nMister Baileys! He did it! Isn’t he grand?\n\nTruly he’s one of the best in the land.\n\nMark was delirious, quite ‘over the moon’.\n\nNow we prepare for the big race in June.\n\nPaul he was worse, nearly died of delight.\n\nBet you all wish you’d seen him that night.\n\nThey danced on the floors, they danced on the tables,\n\nThey danced with Gretas, with Anns and with Mabels!\n\nThey laughed and they drank and talked till quite late,\n\nAnd all, they agreed, said the horse he was great.\n\nBut things settle down and it’s back to the grind,\n\nThere are races to win and entries to find.\n\nSo it’s up at first dawn and on with the fray,\n\nOf mucking out horses and carting the hay.\n\nSo it’s back to the yard and things carry on,\n\nBut none of the glory will ever be gone.\n\nThe Venners brought along the trophy, a photo album from the day, and a scrap book of press cuttings from Mister Baileys’ career. That was a real eye opener. There was so much coverage. There were articles from all the daily papers, front pages and headlines from the Racing Post and Sporting Life, and features on the horse and our yard. It set me to thinking what the press coverage will be like after tomorrow’s race, regardless of who wins. Will the winner even make it to the front page of the Racing Post or will it be trumped by ‘adverts’ for the day’s big betting opportunities. Sadly, I fear that we will never again see the level of press coverage that horseracing received 30 years ago.\n\n21st April 2024\n\nWherever I have been in the British Isles in the last few months, from the Highlands of Scotland to the south of England and the west of Ireland, everyone has agreed that it has been one of the wettest winters that they can remember. There is standing water where there has never been water before, farmers have been unable to get machinery onto the land, and many turf race meetings have been abandoned.\n\nEverywhere is saturated and we are all sick of the rain except, it would seem, if you live in or around Windsor. Windsor racecourse are watering for their meeting tomorrow. I find it impossible to believe that it is necessary. Actually, I am fairly certain that it is not necessary as the going is described as “Good to Firm, Good” with “a chance of a light shower”. Clearly this clerk of the course is ignoring BHA instructions to aim for Good to Firm ground for flat racing but there is nothing new in that, the vast majority ignore that instruction with impunity.\n\n14th November 2023\n\nA few days ago the headline on the front page of the Racing Post screamed ‘This is why we love the jumps’ under a picture of Paul Nicholls, Gordon Elliot and three horses which I later, with some help from Charlie, identified as Frodon, Gerri Colombe and Nassalam. It was a very promising headline and I expected there to be further detail beneath or on the next page but all there was was a subheading which stated, ‘The rescheduled Champion Chase spearheads a magical day featuring old friends and exciting youngsters at Down Royal, Wincanton and Aintree’. I was left to speculate as to why it is that jump racing seems now to be so much more popular than the flat, in the eyes of Racing Post journalists at least.\n\nRightly or wrongly, my take on this was that it is largely about the fact that the top horses are around for longer and the public can get to know them. A narrative can be built around them. And yet, one of the Racing Post’s top, and in my opinion best, journalists said of the Flat staying division that watching horses like Subjectivist and Stradivarius was like watching bicycles with flat tyres or glorified point-to-points. On the flat it is the stayers that tend to be around longest and it is them that the public are most likely to identify with and the best ones go a lot faster than the chasers or even the hurdlers.\n\nSo why is it that so many in the media see the jumps as so much more engaging. ‘Exciting youngsters’? Surely not. Or is it the trainers and the jockeys that are more interesting personalities. Maybe.\n\nI was drawn to think about it all again by another article in the Racing Post. Today, Sam Hendry suggests that we should be doing more to ‘tap into Japan’s ocean of racing-mad fans’. He seems to be saying that our product – and he is talking about flat, not jumps – is better than Japanese racing and so we should be doing more to sell it to Japanese racing fans. ‘The first step’, he says, ‘would be to entice more Japanese runners to Royal Ascot, the key arena in advertising European racing worldwide’. Note, he doesn’t say Wincanton, Down Royal, Aintree or even Cheltenham.\n\nI think he is missing the point. The Japanese racing fans are fans of the sport, first and foremost. Sure, they bet, collectively and probably individually, more than British racing’s punters but racing in Japan is marketed as a sport and the leading participants, human and equine, are afforded celebrity status. The Japan Racing Association are primarily focused on the sport of horseracing and the furtherance of the Japanese thoroughbred. The head of the JRA in the UK told me that ‘in Japan the racing is for the breeding’. I fear that, if we asked the head of the BHA, she would say, ‘in Britain, the racing is for the betting’. That is the difference between Japan and the UK.\n\nThere is a huge amount we could learn from Japan about all aspects of marketing our sport and, if we waken up and start learning quickly, we can maybe encourage more people to follow British racing and/or covert some current followers into true fans. But we are light years away from attracting Japan’s ocean of racing-mad fans. That will never happen so long as the Racing Post and most other media organisations covering racing portray it and market it purely as another betting medium.\n\n5th May 2023\n\nSomething urgently needs to be done to address the blatant disregard, by racecourses, for the rules of racing appertaining to the management of ground and the racing surface. I have, for a long time, expressed sympathy for Clerks of Courses who aim to produce ground softer than the optimum, Good to Firm, preferred by the BHA as they know from experience that there will be less non-runners on Good than on Good to Firm but, nonetheless, their breaches of the rules should not just be ignored. I think that Good to Firm ground is the ideal surface for flat racing, although I do feel that renaming the optimum surface condition or moving the scale might solve the problem, but if the majority disagree with me and can justify their beliefs then the rules should be changed. If the rule is wrong, change it. If it is right, enforce it.\n\nThe most extreme example we have seen this season was for last Sunday’s meeting at Musselburgh where the Clerk of the Course was watering on ground he described as ‘Good’ in the run up to the meeting. The forecast rain came and the meeting was run on soft ground.\n\nToday, on the first day of the Guineas meeting at Newmarket, the ground is described as Good to Firm, Good in Places (watered). Rain is forecast on all three days. I find it hard to believe that they were aiming to produce Good to Firm ground when they watered.\n\n5th January – 2023\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nOn Tuesday I received two e mails from stableemployees@weatherbys.co.uk. The first came with a BHA heading and told me that they had recently been informed that I am now employed on a full-time basis as an Assistant Trainer by Charlie Johnston as of 1st January 2023. That, of course, isn’t strictly true as I am employed by the limited company now known as Johnston Racing Ltd., in which Deirdre and I are now the only share holders, and have been since 1989. Charlie is employed by the same company and has been for seven years. The e mail went on to tell me about my obligations to abide by the rules of racing with a particular emphasis on ‘safeguarding’ and ‘inside information’, two of the BHA’s favourite subjects.\n\nThe second e mail, from the same source, told me all about the Careers In Racing website, just in case I wanted to change my job having had it for two days.\n\nTo be fair, both the BHA’s licencing department and Weatherbys have been super efficient in handling the transfer of our licence from Charlie and Mark Johnston to Charlie alone. It couldn’t have been handled better but the e mails are examples of the unwieldy, and often downright illogical, rules and systems that we are all working under. The rules on licensing seem to take little or no account of the fact that many training businesses will operate as limited companies rather than as individual sole traders and that the licence holder will often be an employee rather than an employer.\n\nIt makes me wonder just how many training businesses are now limited companies or partnerships rather than sole traders, who was the first trainer to operate as a limited company, and when that was?\n\nA much more pertinent example of the mess our rules of racing are in is the recent U-turn by the BHA on the rules relating to use of the crop (if the BHA are so concerned about public perception, why do they persist in calling this instrument a ‘whip’?). It beggars belief. Was the review worth the 95 sheets of paper it was written on? Clearly not and that is hardly a surprise as the regulator’s approach to this issue has been flawed for decades. But what of the Professional Jockeys Association’s involvement in the review itself, their agreement with the back-hand proposal, and now their own U-turn when it turns out, yet again, that they are totally unrepresentative of the views of working jockeys? It is only a few months since we had a similar situation over weights carried and allowances for equipment that would not be included in the published weight. That was another mess and it has left us with a situation in which many racing professionals, let alone the public, are unsure about the actual weight the horses are carrying ( I believe it is now 4lbs more than published). And don’t get me started on the the changes to the rules on the employment of apprentice jockeys – also pushed through to placate the PJA against the advice of trainers – which have resulted in greatly reduced opportunities for young people to get started especially with those trainers who have proved best at nurturing talent.\n\nWhy do the BHA rely so heavily on input from the PJA when they repeatedly demonstrate their lack of understanding of so many issues and, worst of all, their apparent inability to canvas the views of their members and, in particular, their more influential members? Is it simply that the BHA lack the expertise and confidence whenever it comes to anything relating specifically to the participants?\n\nAnyway, back to the crop and the new rules. The specifics of the rule changes are, for me, almost irrelevant. It seems that most now agree that this is principally about public perception rather than horse welfare and, to my mind, no organisation has done more harm to the public perception of the use of the riding crop in racing than the BHA (and BHB and Jockey Club before them). Every time we ban and/or penalise a jockey for his use of the crop, the public perceive, quite understandably, that a horse has been abused and its welfare has been compromised. This has been the case since they started counting strokes of the crop and dished out bans to the first three jockeys home in the thrilling 1996 2000 Guineas and that perception will be re-enforced and amplified when they increase the penalties, start banning jockeys for longer periods for the same ‘offence’, and start disqualifying winners.\n\nWe should never have gone down the route of counting strokes as there is little or no correlation between the number of strokes and the incidence of abuse. It was far better when the rules were geared to punishing any abuse of horses rather than principally being concerned with public perception. Apparently the BHA were in part swayed by the argument that back-hand use is more likely to result in horse being hit in the wrong place but the same applies to the, now long- standing, rule preventing use of the crop above shoulder height and yet the regulators are still very hot on that issue. Again, the rules are not about horse welfare.\n\nI heard snippets of a conversation on one of the racing channels yesterday in which they were comparing our rules with those in Germany where there are far greater restrictions on use of the crop and draconian penalties. I have also heard people, including fellow board members when I sat on the board of the BHA, cite Norway, where the use of the crop has been banned altogether, as a good example. Well, if we are aspiring to have rapidly declining racing and breeding industries like Germany or low-grade racing as in Norway, that’s fine, put those nations on a pedestal. If you want an example of a nation whose quality of racing and breeding is rapidly improving, look no further than Japan.\n\n22nd December 2022\n\nI am long past being surprised by anything that Matt Chapman says but I cannot believe that no action is taken against him by the BHA when he blatantly brings racing into disrepute. Today on Sky Sports Racing before the 1.20pm race at Lingfield, in which we were running Muir Wood and Demilion, he suggested that it is normal practice for horses to be prevented from running up to their best on their third start in order to obtain a favourable handicap rating. “Charlie and Mark Johnston aren’t stupid”, he said, “They know how the system works”. Afterwards he expressed surprise that the horses had finished second and third, he speculated that they could be rated in the 80s, and he said of me and Charlie, “maybe they don’t care”. He is basically suggesting that Charlie and I and the jockeys riding for us should break the rules and cheat in order to obtain a lower handicap mark, unless we are stupid.\n\nSadly it is a widely held view that this is how ‘the system’ works and, with people in the media like Matt Chapman perpetuating this view, it is little wonder that so many people think racing is fixed and crooked. Unfortunately, it is likely that this view is shared by many officials and regulators and it has troubled me since I entered this industry that the regulators operate a handicap system and write rules which they themselves believe can reward cheating and then spend huge amounts of money policing the system and trying to catch the cheats – money which would be far better spent on prizes for those that are trying to win.\n\nIt is, frankly, sad that nobody has taken steps to alter the system if they are so convinced that cheating is endemic and inevitable.\n\nPerhaps Matt Chapman should consider, before he accuses me of naivety or stupidity, that I have trained more winners than any other British trainer and, although I don’t know for sure, I think it is almost certain that I have trained more handicap winners than any other British trainer. I have built my business on the fact that the system does not work as Matt Chapman suggests. Horses get themselves beaten all too often without us helping them to do so.\n\n1st September 2022\n\nI am in Baden Baden, Germany, for the BBAG yearling sale and I have just returned from their eve-of-sale barbeque/party. Unlike any other sale company, they throw a little party for all vendors and their staff, buyers, and anyone else connected with the sale. The drink flows, the food is great and guess who was there, Elvis. He is alive, well, living near Baden Baden and he speaks remakeably good german inbetween banging out all his hits and familiar tunes. It was the second time I have seen Elvis perform at this sale and he didn’t disappoint. It was a great evening.\n\nI flew here yesterday direct from Newmarket where we sold two horses at the August horses-in-training sale. Soapy Stevens was sold for 125,000 guineas and will go to Bahrain. It was a great result for his owner-breeder, Jim Duggan, but a sad day for us and for British racing. Another highly-rated horse gone from the UK. I wonder how many horses rated over 90 have left our shores from that sale alone.\n\n23rd July 2022\n\nCatherine MacRae gives us ‘Another View’ in the Racing Post today and tells us that she is frustrated by the lack of horses saddled in the saddling boxes at Sandown and that trainers, by choosing to saddle their horses in the stable yard, ‘shrouded in secrecy’, will not help people fall in love with the sport. I have heard similar views expressed in the Racing Post before by people who, I would imagine, have never been in a saddling box with a horse. But, rather than assume the same about Catherine MacRae, I decided to try and determine what knowledge of the subject she might have. I ‘Googled’ her and found a LinkedIn page on which she describes herself as ‘a trainee journalist at the Racing Post’ with ‘a background in horseracing’ and she tells us that she worked for nine months as a barn manager for Lucinda Russell. She should know better.\n\nShe suggests that ‘Sandown’s shaded facilities [the pre-parade ring] offer an excellent opportunity for runners to acclimatise to the atmosphere before presenting them to the main paddock – a significantly louder and more stimulating environment’, but this is race-day, not the time for training and education, especially when you are running a filly in a Listed race and looking for her to give 100%. Once a horse is upset, even slightly, it is quite difficult to get it to relax again, especially immediately pre-race with so much going on. And saddling boxes are a very alien environment for our horses. So much so that I have to wonder when they were first introduced and how they have evolved.\n\nIf, like Catherine MacRae, you have attended a pre-parade ring with saddling facilities, you will have noticed that we lead the horse into the saddling box – a three-sided stall – and turn it to face outwards while it is saddled. Many saddling boxes, especially the older ones, are too narrow to easily turn the horse and so begins the catalogue of issues likely to upset the animal. I have, on very rare occasions, tried saddling a horse – one intent on barging out of the saddling box – facing inwards but this is fraught with dangers as the personnel have to squeeze between the horse’s hindquarters and the walls of the box to get in and out. Not a good idea if the horse gets at all fractious. And so we saddle the horse facing outwards with nothing but its groom to stop it coming out if it decides that it would rather be outside. In many cases there is little room to work on either side and it is not a nice place to be if the horse gets at all difficult.\n\nFar better, wherever possible, to saddle in surroundings that the horse is used to – a loose box – and before the horse is presented to the atmosphere of the public areas of the racecourse. Let’s face it, I don’t think fans in other sports feel the need to have a view of dressing rooms or preparation areas.\n\nWhat’s more the saddling procedure which I have described is, almost invariably, a three-person job. Staff shortages seem to be commonplace these days in many industries, including racing, and not every trainer can afford the luxury of three people to saddle a horse. The job can be done easily by two people – even one – in the stable with little or no risk to horse or handler. Why would you do it any other way if you didn’t have to?\n\n18th July 2022\n\nIn May the BHA, at last, decided to lift the restrictions which, for two years, had prevented entry to the weighing room for anyone other than jockeys, racecourse personnel and BHA officials. It was one of the many over-the-top measures introduced to help minimise the potential spread of Covid-19 and help to ensure the continuation of racing during the pandemic. However, when lifting the restrictions, they couldn’t just return to the way it was before. Some bright spark had to come up with a ‘new normal’. The BHA announced that, “From Saturday 21 May, trainers or representatives with a horse declared to run will be permitted to enter the Weighing Room complex whenever there is a clear work purpose for doing so. Work-related reasons for entering the Weighing Room are likely to include collecting saddles, observing apprentices weighing out, and for Stewards Enquiries.”\n\nI’m not at all sure what prompted this desire to explain what ‘work’ means for a trainer or, indeed, what non ‘work related’ reason a trainer might have for entering the weighing room but, inevitably, racecourses have interpreted this instruction in different ways and many, if not most, have a person posted on the door to challenge everyone, other than jockeys and officials, attempting to enter the weighing room.\n\nPre-pandemic, my usual routine on arrival at a racecourse was to go to the weighing room, collect a race card, and check the notices on the wall for non-runners (and the reasons e.g. ground, which may indicate a problem), going changes, etc.. Now, apart from the indignity of constantly having to explain my purpose for being there, there is no point as they have stopped posting these notices in the weighing room and I am not aware that they are posted anywhere else on course.\n\nAt Haydock, where, let’s face it, there tends to be a greater than average number of non-runners, I would always go immediately to the weighing room to check the situation but now the non-runners are no longer displayed and, being a Jockey Club course, it is impossible to obtain the relevant information over the internet. The jockey Club free wi-fi system is hopeless as you have to go through the whole log-in process every time you want access and they have blocked the Racing Post website which, for most of us, is the best and quickest source of information on form, non-runners, etc.. Chester is another track where non-runners are commonplace and there the wi-fi system is so bad, and mobile phone signal virtually non-existent, that we cannot obtain the necessary information and we cannot report to owners, who are not in attendance, after the race. When I am not present myself, I have no contact with my representative.\n\nIt would seem that the BHA have a hankering for the bad old days when the regulator, The Jockey Club, saw trainers as coming from a lower order akin to servants. It is time for all of us – trainers, stable staff, and all others who are working to put the race meeting on – to be afforded due respect and aided, rather than hindered, in trying to do our job. Trainers and their representatives should have unhindered access to the weighing room and all necessary information should be readily available therein, and there should be a dedicated, and efficient, wi-fi system for racing professionals on course.\n\n15th July -2022\n\nWho was the mystery ‘prominent Newmarket handler’ who supposedly urged fellow trainers not to declare their horses for the last race on Newbury’s Saturday card? He, or she, deserves a medal if it is true. I was assuming it was a ‘he’ as there were only three Newmarket trainers with entries in the race – four, if you count John and Thady Gosden as two. But, I suppose, it might have been a trainer who didn’t have an entry in the race.\n\nIt is interesting that the Racing Post have chosen not to name this person. The daily betting rag’s past form on such matters would suggest that they would be splashing the trainer’s name across the front page and castigating the rebel rouser. I can’t imagine that they would have held back if it was William Haggas. They certainly didn’t the last time that he and I urged trainers not to run in a below tariff race at Yarmouth – they called us ‘bullies’.\n\nI wonder if the name will come out and if we’ll be seeing comment pieces from Alan Byrne and Bruce Millington personally attacking the ‘rogue’.\n\nOn this occasion, I wasn’t involved and that is largely because I have been voting with my feet all season and I have had very few entries at Newbury. This ‘boycott’, if that’s what you want to call it, made me look at how many runners I have had at the Berkshire track so far this year. The answer is three and the only tracks where I have had less runners are Thirsk (2), Weatherby (2), and Ffos Las (0). Ffos Las is a particularly long journey for us and there are more than enough of the type of races they run on offer at much closer tracks. The same cannot be said for the others. I wonder if they care. The management at Newbury probably don’t. Why would they? They’re doing very well as house-builders.\n\n6th June 2022\n\nPontefract are watering, 9 hours before racing, on what they themselves describe as ‘Good To Firm, Good in Places’ ground. I have just (9.10am) spoken to the clerk of the course and he admits that it is currently raining, ‘a light drizzle’. Under BHA instructions they are supposed to be aiming for Good To Firm ground. No wonder horses are slipping all over the place on courses and meetings are being abandoned.\n\n7th February 2022\n\nGary Woods is, apparently, a bloodstock agent and he is also, apparently, the founder of Empire International Bloodstock but I had never heard of Mr. Woods or his bloodstock agency prior to his being accused, a few days ago, of defrauding a syndicate of owners by failing to tell them that their horse was dead until he had extracted £6,000 in training fees from them.\n\nHis actions have led to another call from Lee Mottershead for the licensing of bloodstock agents in order to ‘reduce the possibility of anything like this happening again’. Would it reduce the possibility of anything like this happening again? I’m not so sure.\n\nThere may be other people who are acting as bloodstock agents and managing syndicates, in fact I suspect that there almost certainly are, but I am struggling to immediately think of one. Mr. Woods, as far as I can determine from the little we know about the case, was principally acting here as a syndicate manager rather than as a bloodstock agent. He is not, as far as I am aware, accused of malpractice in any activity that we would normally associate with bloodstock agents or that Lee Mottershead is seeking to have controlled by licensing.\n\nI am not, particularly, against the idea of licensing bloodstock agents but I am wary of more layers of unnecessary bureaucracy and of unintended consequences. I would hate to see any restrictions on free trade, as we see in financial services, with buyers forced to use a licensed agent in order to make purchases. While Lee Mottershead and Justin Felice, who conducted the review of buying and selling practices, assume that licensing of bloodstock agents will afford greater protection for customers, theirs is a simplistic view and they have not, as far as I am aware, given much detail on how it would work. Consider, for example, some auctions of motor vehicles which are restricted to ‘the trade’, where bids will only be accepted from registered or bona fide traders. This may be portrayed as a way of protecting buyers, vendors and the auction house but, in reality, it allows the potential for the operation of cartels and guarantees a position for a ‘middle-man’ in every transaction.\n\nLee Mottershead points to a number of people naming themselves as agent at a recent sale and states that ‘it is hard to see why they or anyone else involved in buying horses would have any objection to being licensed’. Well, Lee, I would object to needing to be licensed to spend my own money or to being forced to use a licensed agent in order to do so.\n\n6th December 2021\n\nIt was drawn to my attention over the weekend that, in our latest Kingsley Klarion, which was published at the beginning of the month, it describes Subjectivist as ‘sadly now retired through injury’. Well, I’m sorry to disappoint the owners of other great stayers but that isn’t necessarily the case. Subjectivist is still here at Kingsley Park and there are no immediate plans for retirement.\n\nIt is well publicised that an injury came to light soon after he won this year’s Ascot Gold Cup and there is no doubt that that injury is career threatening but, in the absence of a suitable job at stud, we will make an attempt to bring him back for the Royal meeting next year. As the clock ticks by towards the 2022 covering season it looks likely that he will still be here in the New Year and returning to training.\n\nHis three-parts brother, Sir Ron Priestley, on the other hand, will definitely be retired. He is also currently still with us but it is hoped that he will shortly be departing for France where he will take up stud duties.\n\n8th November 2021\n\nIt was a sad day for all at Johnston Racing today as Maydanny left to continue his racing career in Dubai. The departure of Attraction’s five-year-old son marks the end of an era for us which began 19 years ago when ownership of Bandari was transferred from the late Mr. Abdulla Al Rostamani to the late Sheikh Hamdan al Maktoum. The horses which followed from Sheikh Hamdan brought us 167 British winners and some tremendous times with horses like Awzaan and Elarqam amongst many others.\n\nSince Sheikh Hamdan’s death in March this year his horses have run in the name of his Shadwell Estate Company and we had our last two runners in the famous blue and white colours at Nottingham on 13th October when Qitaal won and Janoobi was runner up in the next race. Those two horses were sold soon afterwards as part of the Shadwell dispersal at Tattersalls and Maydanny was the last of the great owner’s horses to remain with us until today.\n\nIt was a great privilege to train for Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid al Maktoum and I shall always be grateful for the support he gave us.\n\n10th August 2021\n\nWe are regularly told, particularly by the BHA, of the importance of the public perception of horseracing and, especially, horse welfare within horseracing. The BHA have even launched a public consultation on the use of the whip in horseracing and anyone can have their say online. Is this a good idea? I don’t think so and I fear it is a sad reflection on the administrator when they lack the confidence to make decisions in the best interests of the sport and its participants, both equine and human, without consulting the public.\n\nDare I say that the public are not very good at making decisions or driving policy on animal welfare. Take the case of Geronimo the alpaca, for example. 100,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the Government to intervene and prevent him being euthanised by DEFRA after he tested positive for bovine tuberculosis, twice. Yesterday, a group – granted, there may only have been around 30 of them – ‘marched’ on Downing Street in protest. His owner says that the tests are unreliable. The tests are, it is said, 99.98% accurate. One in 5,000 uninfected animals can give a false positive test. Geronimo has tested positive twice.\n\nI can’t remember but I wonder how many people protested about the slaughter of 6,000,000 cattle and sheep during the 2001 Foot and Mouth outbreak. Tuberculosis is a zoonotic disease – one which can spread from animals to humans – and the main cause of human infection is bovine tuberculosis. Foot and Mouth disease is not a zoonotic disease, it does not infect people, or horses, and it is not a killer of cattle or sheep and yet the public were wholeheartedly behind the eradication policy despite the necessity for the slaughter of millions of animals.\n\nSo much for the public perception of animal welfare. We should not be relying on it to guide welfare policy in horseracing.\n\n18th July 2021\n\nA good win for Dr. Jim Walker’s Value Theory at Newmarket yesterday on her second start and it hopefully provides some consolation for the owner of Subjectivist that he has some nice two-year-olds to run and give him something to dream about now that his star is out of action. You may have noticed that many of Jim’s horses have names derived from his occupation as an economist. As I understand it, names like Austrian School, Austrian Theory, Natural Value, Subjective Value, Salamanca School, Praxeology, and maybe even Subjectivist come from the world of economics but it struct me that many of these terms and, in particular, ‘value theory’, could also be applied to the way I buy yearlings and maybe this is one of the things that has led to our successful association with Dr. Jim.\n\nIt needs to be remembered, when judging the success, or otherwise, of a buyer at the yearling sales, that the yearlings bought are not necessarily the ones the buyer wanted most but are, for some of us, the ones we could afford. That certainly applies to me and it is well publicised that I select yearlings first on pedigree and only look at those that meet our established criteria. Then, of the many hundreds which Charlie and I look at, some will be excluded on conformation, looks, or soundness but the vast majority will be followed to the ring because they could be worth buying at the right price. This is my ‘value theory’ and it has helped us buy many exceptionally good horses for very little money.\n\nHowever, I still see plenty horses which I would consider good value at hundreds of thousands of pounds and well beyond my price range. I get the occasional one sent to me that falls into that bracket but for the most part I can only dream of training them and the many top class horses that have pedigree and looks but are clearly not good value. Nonetheless, I love the challenge of finding the value at all levels of the sales and get tremendous satisfaction when competing at the top level with horses bought cheaply for our owners.\n\n13th July 2021\n\nI’ve always argued that handicapping is not a science, it isn’t even arithmetic. It is, I would say, simply an opinion expressed as a figure. But, for those of you that do think it is a science and that it obeys the laws of mathematics, or even some of them, explain this to me.\n\nSir Ron Priestly (Rated 112) meets Pyledriver (Rated 119) at level weights and beats him two and a quarter lengths. After the race, both horses are rated 117.\n\nPyledriver (now 117) then meets Al Aasy (Rated 119) at level weights and beats him a neck. After the race Pyledriver is raised to 121 and Al Aasy is raised to 120.\n\nSir Ron Priestly (granted – since having run two disappointing races and having been dropped to 116) then meets Al Aasy (120), giving him 3lbs, and beats him a neck (the same distance that Pyledriver beat him but carrying 3lbs more). After the race Al Aasy is still rated 120 and and Sir Ron Priestly is now rated 118.\n\n5th July 2021\n\nHappy birthday to Brian Palmer, described in the Racing Post today as ‘Mark Johnston’s first owner’. Close but not quite correct. Our first owner was Paul Venner of Baileys horse feeds, for whom we trained Mister Baileys to win the Guineas seven years later. Brian Palmer was the owner of Hinari Video, our first winner, and he, and his wife Val, became partners in our business from 1988 until 2000. Brian and Val are no longer involved in horseracing at all but remain our close friends. They now live at Leyburn just two miles from the yard.\n\nWhen Brian broached the subject of a business partnership in 1988, he told me, ‘I can’t make you a better horse trainer than you are going to be, but I’ll move you on ten years’. He did exactly that.\n\n4th July – 2021\n\nThere is too much racing.\n\nYesterday there were 35 races scheduled in the UK with a further 15 from Ireland shown on RTV. British races were scheduled to commence as little as five minutes after the previous race and, in reality, when it comes to looking at the actual ‘off’ time, this was cut to as little as two minutes. If you throw in the Irish cards, the minimum interval between two starts drops to one minute.\n\nThis can’t be a good move for anyone involved. Some might argue that it provides more opportunities for trainers like me to have runners and more opportunities for jockeys to ride but there are only so many horses to go round and the pool of horses and owners willing to pay for them to be trained and race is diminishing. The result will be a continued decline in quality as racecourses struggle to meet bookmaker demand for field sizes and owners leave the sport or take their horses abroad in search of better returns.\n\nLook no further than BAGS greyhound racing to see where this policy can lead.\n\n18th June 2021\n\nFor the first time ever, today, I had runners at Royal Ascot without being in attendance myself. Deirdre tells me that I have missed another day in the last 30+ years since I started attending, when we didn’t have a runner and we decided to take a day off, but I don’t remember that. Generally, I would always be there from beginning to end but things are different this year. Not quite as ‘different’ as last year but different from any normal year.\n\nWe usually stay fairly nearby – for many years now it has been the Marriott hotel in Slough – but the traffic means that we still need to allow, at least, an hour to drive to the course. This year, with very little traffic, we have been flying down to White Waltham, as we would for any ordinary Ascot fixture, and getting a taxi from there. In all, it has been taking us about an hour and threequarters and I had originally planned to do the same today but, when I saw the weather forecast, I realised that flying might not be an option and so Charlie stayed down last night to cover the meeting if I couldn’t make it.\n\nAs it was, the weather was so bad that the meeting had to survive an inspection just after noon and there would have been no possibility of me landing at White Waltham or anywhere else nearby. I stayed at home in the Yorkshire sunshine – not a drop of rain here – and basked in the glory of Subjectivist’s Gold Cup win. It was great to watch the race again and to read some of the newspaper reports – Joe Fanning made the front page of the Yorkshire Post – although it was a little frustrating, if not entirely surprising, to be damned with faint praise in some quarters where the emphasis was on Stradivarius having suffered interference in running rather than on the magnificent performances from Subjectivist and his jockey.\n\nIt should, perhaps, be noted that the Gold Cup was the only race on the day where the time dipped below standard, and by a full 1.22 seconds. ITV’s analysis of the sectional times was also very interesting and it pointed out that Subjectivist covered the final furlong faster than any other horse so, if my very basic physics and maths isn’t failing me, that tells me that, for anything to beat him, it would have had to be in front of him with 220 yards to go or it would have had to finish a lot faster than it did on the day.\n\nStradivarius’s owner, Bjorn Nielsen was the first person to congratulate me when I managed to extricate myself from the winners’ enclosure and he and the Gosdens were very magnanimous in defeat as you would expect from such a professional team. They must have been very disappointed but I am sure that they feel that their great horse owes them nothing. His earnings are quite staggering as, I believe, he collected two £1,000,000 Weatherbys Hamilton Stayers bonuses to add to almost £3,000,000 in prize-money and who is to say that he is finished yet. Subjectivist is highly unlikely to ever amass such earnings although, if this was a different sport, we would probably have Subjectivist’s breeder’s husband, Barry Hearn, promoting a rematch with the bulk of the media rights earnings going to the ‘players’. Wouldn’t that be something?\n\n23rd May 2021\n\nAm I alone in thinking that Martin Bashir is being made a scapegoat by the BBC and the media in general? While there has been criticism of BBC management at the time of his Princess Diana interview, I have not heard any suggestion that his actions stemmed from a culture of lies, deceit and sensationalism which pervades the media, including the BBC, to this day. I am not, for a minute, condoning what he did but I cannot accept that this was a case of one bad apple. Most of the fruit shop is well beyond ripe.\n\nFor decades we have been sold the image that the BBC is some great bastion of moral values and beyond reproach. Panorama, in particular, has been placed on a pedestal and I now look back and wonder how many times I was taken in and accepted, without question, reports on subjects I knew nothing about.\n\nSadly, it seems, that the old adage of not letting the truth get in the way of a good story applies just as much to BBC journalists as it does to those who are seeking to outsell rival tabloids by displaying the most shocking headline. Horseracing has suffered many times, during my career, at the hands of these unscrupulous reporters and documentaries from Panorama, the BBC’s Kenyon Confronts, and ITV’s The Cook Report, sprang immediately to my mind as I read and listened to reports on this latest BBC scandal. It was only through having some inside knowledge of the subjects being covered that I came to realise how inaccurate and sensationalist many television documentaries are and I certainly do not think that the situation is any better now than it was in Martin Bashir’s time. I now wonder, was it always so? Have we always been misled and manipulated by the media? Who can you trust to tell it as it is?\n\n17th May 2021\n\nSo, so sad to hear of Joe Mercer’s death. It was only on Saturday that I saw Bruce Raymond at Newbury and asked after Joe. Bruce said, ‘He’s great. As bright as ever. He phones me every week’.\n\nAs a child and teenager, Joe was a superhero in my eyes. I could never have imagined that years later he would be coming to stay in my house. When he was racing manager for Sheikh Maktoum, he would come to stay and look at the horses the next morning. If racing was at York, Joe would leave after his last runner and, if I had one in a later race, he would let himself in and make himself at home. By the time I got back, Joe would have been raking about for a nice bottle of red wine and he’d be half way through his first glass. We loved having him to stay.\n\n24th April 2021\n\nCourse officials at Ripon are, apparently, “very disappointed” with the turnout for their seven race card today. Clerk of the course, James Hutchinson, blames it on the ‘quick conditions’. Good to Firm, Good in places. That’s not ‘quick’. In fact, knowing Ripon, there is a serious danger that it will be over-watered and slow.\n\nI have two of the three runners in the two mile handicap but, I have to say, I wouldn’t be running two and might not have been running any at all if I’d had to take on more rivals. The prize-money is so appalling that it simply doesn’t make sense to risk horses of this calibre for such poor rewards. The £11, 338.80 on offer to the winner today might seem like a lot of money when compared with the price of eggs but it is very little compared to the cost of buying, training and racing a horse and it is a pittance when compared to the value of this calibre of horse if it were to be sold to race abroad.\n\nAs with so many other things at present, this sorry state of affairs will be blamed on Covid 19 and that could, arguably, justify the the reduction from the £15,562.50 landed by our own Making Miracles in 2019 when the first six home received prize-money. But how do they justify the fact that, when Richard Fahey and Marwan Koukash won the race in 2014 with Angel Gabrial, they collected £24,900 and, again, six of the thirteen runners were rewarded for their efforts? And, when Trip to Paris won it the following year for Ed Dunlop, he collected £25,876.\n\nI, as much as anyone, believe that racehorses are for racing and I’d rather gallop them round Ripon with a good chance of winning £11,000 than gallop them at Kingsley Park for nothing but it is a large part of my job, when placing horses, to look at the risk to reward ratio and racecourse managers are going to have to wake up to the fact that, if they want to attract good quality horses, they are going to have to pay a lot more attention to the prize-money and stop blaming the weather and other factors beyond their control.\n\n9th March 2021\n\nThe influence of public opinion on the BHA and IHRB has been all too evident in recent times but that pales into insignificance when compared with the influence on governments and politicians, particularly in times of crisis. To what extent has public opinion and perception influenced the handling of the of the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, rather than virology, epidemiology, and objective assessment of risk? Sadly, it seems that politicians, of all parties and in most countries, are more likely to be driven by polls than by any genuine altruistic concern for the electorate.\n\nPerhaps it has always been so but I think most would agree that the influence of public opinion has been, at least, widened and extended into many more facets of our lives by the explosion of social media and the internet. And sadly, it seems, that the greatest influence on public opinion, especially ignorant majorities, is exerted by that section of the media which almost prides itself in never letting the truth get in the way of a good story, the tabloid journalists and those that produce the headlines to accompany their work. The objective of the headline writer, of course, is to grab attention and they really don’t mind how they do it. The perception created by the headline is often very different from that which the article was intended to convey.\n\nOn the internet, headline writers must compete with a huge volume of material and, as a result, there is a tendency to be even more sensationalist than their counterparts in print. There was a good example of this on the Racing Post website today.\n\nPeter Thomas has written a typically good piece on the 2001 abandonment of the Cheltenham Festival due to Foot and Mouth. It is a very balanced and accurate piece based on those whose dreams of Cheltenham success were shattered when the meeting was cancelled. The attitude of those involved seemed to be one of resignation. Nobody questioned the need to abandon the meeting. It is assumed that it was a necessary measure as part of the fight against Foot and Mouth.\n\nReaders of Peter Thomas’s piece will probably share the view that the abandonment of racing was an appropriate action at the time, especially if they read his article on the Racing Post website where it is presented under the headline, ‘How a killer disease thwarted two festival legends’. What ‘killer disease’? Foot and Mouth doesn’t kill people, it doesn’t kill horses, and it doesn’t usually even kill cattle, pigs or sheep. By no stretch of the imagination can it be described as a killer. What’s more, horses are no more likely to spread the disease than a bicycle or a motor car.\n\nSome comparisons have been made between that outbreak of Foot and Mouth in 2001 and the current horrendous, world-wide, situation caused by Covid -19 and the measures implemented to minimise it’s spread. I suppose there are some comparisons, if only in that sensationalist journalism, misinformation and scaremongering have been used to influence public opinion in both cases.\n\n7th February – 2021\n\nIt was a bit sad to see one of the great characters of British racing, Milton Bradley, retiring, albeit at the age of 86, especially as he felt it had been forced upon him by a lack of opportunities to run his horses. It was, however, the first time that I had heard a trainer complaining that the official handicapper drops horses too quickly. The main complaint about handicappers is invariably the opposite: that they are far too quick to put horses up and it takes far too many unplaced runs to get them back down again.\n\nThe complaint that there is a lack of opportunities for low grade horses or that it is difficult to get a run for the very lowest rated horses, on the other hand, is a common one despite the fact that we have massively more low grade races in Britain than ever before. While foreign investment from the biggest owners has kept the quality of Britain’s best racehorses at, or above, the highest standards in the world, the bottom end is choked with low-grade horses looking for opportunities to run and owners who not only think these horses should be given the opportunity to run but think they should be given the opportunity to win.\n\nWhat it tells me is that, at all levels, the handicap system is failing British racing. I have asked the question before and never had an answer, so I’ll ask it again: who, apart from the betting industry, benefits from the handicap system? The benefit to the betting industry is even debateable. Sure, their margins on handicaps are higher but, with nine of the top ten betting turnover races being non-handicaps, you will never convince me that punters prefer handicaps.\n\nIs it really beyond the wit of man to devise a graded race system in which horses move up the grades according to what they have won and move down the grades when they fail to earn any prize-money for a period of time? It is how it works in most professional sport.\n\n__________________________________\n\nIt tells us today in the Racing Post that Josh Apiafi has appointed former senior Cheltenham racecourse executive Lee Moulton ‘to develop plans to make non-riding jobs more attractive to a wider pool of the public’. It isn’t clear to me, in what capacity, Apiafi has employed Moulson. Will he be working for Apiafi personally, will he be working for his company Rewards4Racing, or has he appointed him on behalf of some other racing body?\n\nI am also a little unsure about how many non-riding vacancies there are in racing. For as long as I have been a trainer, and probably for a long time before that, there has been a shortage of light-weight riders in racing and the situation is getting worse. I was one of the first, if not the first, to separate roles in my racing yard to optimise the use of available skills and use different people for riding and yard work. That is common practice now but it hasn’t solved the problem.\n\nWe are inundated with applicants for non-riding jobs and so, as the other great barrier to employing staff in areas like Middleham is a shortage of housing and accommodation, we now largely limit our intake of non-riders to local people who will not require us to provide accommodation. And yet it seems that much of the emphasis on recruitment and retention of staff in racing is focussed on non-riders and available off-the-job training is often aimed at preparing our existing riders for non-riding positions. We’re barking up the wrong tree.\n\n31st January 2021\n\nIt is so sad to hear of the death of Paul Haigh and it is a reminder to me of how much I have missed reading his words. I have already seen many tributes to him in which he is described as a ‘great writer’, a ‘wonderful raconteur’, and even a ‘genius’ but what we must remember is that Paul was recognised as a great racing writer in an era of great racing writers. He stood out from the crowd when there really was a crowd.\n\nI don’t think I ever had the pleasure of meeting any of his family and I wish I had. It would have been good to know him better. What I did know of him, I liked a lot.\n\n25th January 2021\n\nIf I could bottle it – whatever it is that is making our horses run so well at present – and sell it, I would. But, unfortunately, there is no magic potion and it is no easier to explain a phenomenally good run of form than it is to explain a string of losers.\n\nOf course the horses are generally well but we are still encountering all the usual winter ailments: coughs and snotty noses; cracked heels from exercising in the wet; ringworm from an influx of new young horses; and so on. We are not doing anything differently.\n\nWhen we had a run of more than 100 consecutive losers one year and James Willoughby famously commented that ‘there is no such thing as yard form’, he explained our ‘poor’ performance by saying that it was down to the population of horses that we were running at the time and he pointed out that, based on previous form, the vast majority could not be expected to win. There was a lot of truth in that.\n\nIf you look at our strike rate at the end of any year you will see that it tends to take quite a dip and that is down to the fact that many horses are rushing to get a run before the end of the year to give them some experience before a winter break or to allow us to fully assess their ability if we, and/or their owners, need to make decisions on whether to keep them into another year. The same applies to many other training yards and Maiden and Novice races, in particular, tend to be big fields and pretty competitive.\n\nCome January, we have the whole year ahead of us and, for most of the horses, there is no pressure or rush to run and we can take our time to select the ideal race. That said, the same again applies to many other yards and so our current run of winners and strike-rate is still quite exceptional.\n\nWith a week to go we have already passed our best ever total for January and our 18 winners have come at an incredible strike-rate of 45%. Even more amazing, I would say, is the fact that 17 individuals from 31 to run have won. That, 55%, winners-runners is the sort of figure we might just aspire to at the end of a season but never at this stage.\n\nLong may it last but we must keep our feet on the ground and remember that the nature of the British program and its reliance on handicaps often dictates that a peak must be followed by a trough as our friends the official handicappers hike the winners up and try to stop them from winning again. Sadly, it takes a lot longer to come down in the handicap than it does to go up. Thankfully, however, we have a few more horses waiting in the wings to pick up the gauntlet if this first wave of success starts to wane. It is a great start to the year and makes the cold, dark mornings, and the boredom of lock-down a lot easier to cope with.\n\n8th January 2021\n\nDo you remember, just a few years ago, when we had a over 100 runners without a winner? James Willoughby, when discussing the situation on TV, said something along the lines of “there is no such thing as ‘yard form'” and that prompted us to engage James to look statistically at various aspects of our business. Of course, there are factors which can affect the form of a trainer’s team as a whole but, in reality, they are pretty unusual and, in 35 years of closely monitoring the cyclical fluctuations in our form and investigating the deep ‘troughs’ there have only been a couple of times that we have found a clear common factor affecting a significant number of horses. Early in my career I recognised that these apparent fluctuations in yard form were almost never related to an infectious agent and that the age old excuse, ‘the virus’, didn’t exist. I think that recognition has played a big part in our success.\n\nYesterday, I was asked by the Racing Post about our current excellent run and why it might be that we are knocking in the winners since the New Year. In reality, the same applies as when you are having a bad run: it isn’t something that we are doing differently and it isn’t down to an absence of infections amongst the horses. If it was down to something we were doing differently or something which we could affect, of course, we would do it all the time.\n\nIronically, it is less than three weeks since an owner of ours said to me, ‘you won’t like me saying this, but your horses aren’t running very well at the moment’. It was a day or two after we had had a treble and I can’t really understand where he had got that impression but it just shows you that the public impression of yard form is rarely backed by hard evidence.\n\nIn monitoring the form of the yard I tend to concentrate on the percentage of placed horses as, simply due to the greater numbers, it is a more reliable indicator. As a rough rule of thumb, I say that if we are having 50% placed, we are ‘flying’, 33% is good, and anything under 25% triggers investigation. In the last fortnight we are well over 50% but, of course, it is a fairly small sample and James might tell us that it isn’t statistically significant.\n\nCan we maintain it? That is the most important question and the reality is that, beyond doing what we always do and have done for many years, we can’t change the fact that there will be peaks and troughs in the number of winners. We just have to ride out the troughs and try to ensure that they don’t result in loss of customers and/or horses and create a downward spiral. I said to the Racing Post that, in the current circumstances, with owners cutting back and number of horses down in our yard and, perhaps, across the industry, it is more important than ever to get winners but, if we are already doing our best every day, we can’t do any better. All we can do is to ensure that it is business as usual and that we are leaving no stone unturned. The same applies when trying to maintain a good run or recovering from a poor run.\n\nThis makes it sound like whether or not we have winners or not is all down to luck and it certainly isn’t. We can’t change the fact that there will be weekly or monthly fluctuations in the number of winners but it is how we deal with the poor runs that can set us apart. If you blame it on ‘the virus’ and shut down then you are ensuring that you will not be winning for, at least, the period of the shut down. One certainty in racing is that a horse can’t win if you don’t run it. It can’t get beaten either and it seems that some owners and trainers prefer that method of dealing with a run of losers but not this one.\n\nWhen faced with a challenge, whether it is a run of losers or some threat to the business such as we are now experiencing due to Covid-19, we must rise to that challenge with attention to detail on which horses we run, where we run them, and every other little detail that makes a difference between winners and losers. Not long ago, when faced with cut backs by a major owner and a shift in the type of horses in our yard, we made a conscious decision to ‘hit the boards running’ at the start of the flat season. We had more two-year-olds ready and we aimed to run those that were going best first rather than test the water with a second division. It resulted in us winning the first three two-year-old races one year and the first four the next. It showed what can be done to combat a downturn.\n\nI can’t say that there has been any shift in policy that has resulted in seven winners in the first seven days of 2021 but I am wise to the threat of owners’ cutbacks this year and will be doing everything possible to ensure that we ride out any storm.\n\n6th January 2021\n\nWhat a great start to the New Year. Six winners in the first six days. I don’t think we have ever had such a rapid start. Long may it continue. Racing isn’t much fun for owners at present but winners always help.\n\nI haven’t been racing yet this year and, with no owners on track, and advice to limit our racing team to essential people, I don’t see that I’ll be going much in the next few weeks. It is, perhaps, a good reminder for punters if any is needed that the presence of the trainer on track has no bearing whatsoever on the horse’s chances.\n\n28th December 2020\n\nThis is my first Blethering for several months and will almost certainly be my last of 2020. I will probably resolve to make much more regular contributions to this site in 2021 but that doesn’t, necessarily, mean I will do it as I think I have made the same resolution now for many years. But, who knows, maybe I will be more determined to change my ways in the New Year.\n\nOur lives have been changed quite dramatically in 2020, mostly for the worse, but in some ways for the better, and some of those changes might stick. There is no denying that I have had more free time as there have been months with no racing at all and, when it did resume, owners couldn’t go racing. When they were allowed, it generally wasn’t much fun for them and there has been no social interaction between owners and trainers and so less time spent on the racecourse for both of us. That has given me more time to do other things like go cycling and I must admit that I have enjoyed it.\n\nOwners will also have found other things to do with their time and we in racing have to hope that they haven’t enjoyed those things too much. First indications are that some have cut back, whether as a result of financial pressures resulting from the pandemic or simply because they have re-evaluated their spend on racing. Johnston Racing will go into 2021 with about 20% less horses than we had at the beginning of this year but we still have a big team and we have scaled ‘mountains’ in the past with much smaller teams than we have now.\n\nThere is a huge amount to be positive about. Despite all the challenges this year we have still notched up more than 170 winners, with numerous Group class victories and two Group 1 winners amongst them. We have lots of exciting horses to look forward to so roll on 2021.\n\n16th August 2020\n\nI didn’t go to either of the first two meetings to be held at Chester this year, on Monday and Friday of this week, but had runners at both and, for the first time since the resumption of racing, we had really positive feedback from our owners about the experience and the hospitality on offer. They were, apparently, treated to a three-course dinner in a restaurant overlooking the finish. One owner described it as ‘five star treatment’.\n\nI was delighted, but not particularly surprised, to hear it. Chester, along with Musselburgh, Chelmsford and York, stands apart from other racecourses in terms of its attitude to the participants. There will be little, if any, good come from this pandemic – apart, perhaps, from me having lost a bit of weight – but it will serve to sort a lot of wheat from chaff in many walks of life, including racing.\n\nI didn’t go to Pontefract either this week but Charlie did and reported back that it seemed they had watered half the track, not the first mile or the last mile but the inside half. I watched it again on television and I think it is almost certain that he is right. They did this last year to a point where the outside half was baked and the inside was lush but i thought there had been some intervention by the BHA and that this could not happen again. It didn’t seem to make a lot of difference on Friday – maybe because very few jockeys spotted it and attempted to take advantage of the drier ground and maybe because the inside was still fast.\n\nCharlie’s opinion was that rain would have resulted in an extreme difference and I would have thought that, not only are they risking meetings with a considerable bias, but there is likely to be a long term effect. If Charlie is wrong and they have not watered just the inside half recently then I can only conclude that the damage is already done. I will certainly be making an effort to attend Pontefract as soon as possible to walk the track.\n\n24th June 2020\n\nI am absolutely delighted to hear that Hamilton Park are leading the way and will be accommodating horses and stable staff on Saturday night for their meeting on Sunday. It actually has no effect on my stable as Hamilton is not an overnight stay for us (we generally stay over at tracks where the journey time is greater than 4 hours each way which means Ayr to the north and anything south of Leicester) but the absence of overnight accommodation has been the greatest hardship for stable staff since racing was resumed behind closed doors and I hope that other tracks will follow Hamilton’s example in the near future.\n\nIt has been interesting to note that the form of our horses does not appear to have suffered at all when travelling to far flung tracks but it has been very hard on the staff. Some did a 26 hour shift for one meeting at Goodwood.\n\nWe have been in the lucky position of being able to ferry some staff to or from racetracks in our aeroplane and Newmarket and Haydock went to considerable lengths to open their airstrips because we were doing that. It has meant that, for some of the longest journeys, we could allow some staff to travel to the races by plane and others to travel back, greatly reducing their overall time on duty. But the majority of our travelling staff have had to travel both ways with the horses and the hours they have been working is not sustainable in the long term.\n\nI myself have been going racing a lot. I have attended 17 race meetings at 9 different tracks since 1st June and I have seen some quite different approaches to managing the day. I must say that, from a virus control point of view, I have seen nothing that could be considered remotely risky. Everyone has taken it very seriously and all workers, whether they are racecourse employees, BHA officials, or stable staff, have accepted the inconveniences and extra pressures. That said, I have seen quite a variation in the facilities and catering that has been provided for those attending, ranging from zero to to the first-class provisions at Ascot. ARC tracks, Jockey Club racecourses, Goodwood, Ayr and Hamilton have all provided a free packed lunch for everyone attending and some have added free hot drinks throughout the day but Ascot added a little touch of luxury that you might expect at the Royal meeting. It was much appreciated.\n\n10th June 2020\n\nNow that racing (but not as we know it) has recommenced I am bracing myself for the abusive text messages, e mails and, occasionally, phone calls. I used to think that I was one of the only ones receiving these but I now know that it goes with the job and most, if not all, trainers and jockeys are subjected to this.\n\nOn the other hand, I also get plenty of pleasant messages and there are more posts on social media praising our efforts than there are criticising us. Unfortunately, many of those who text or write to tell me what a wonderful trainer I am spoil it by playing their hand and adding the request for ‘a horse to follow’ but one such text message this week made me smile. It read:\n\n“Hi Mark, Just wanted to say wow what a start after horrible virus hope all your stable and staff ok everyone says you won’t reply but will try as love ya. Any horse to look out for over next few day your in amazing form? No’ worry’s if your understandably very busy but worth a try please stay safe and good luck 🙂 Louise x”\n\nI then noticed that I had received a previous message, last July, from the same number. It read:\n\n“Hi Mark, My 21st birthday today I clean out horses stables for a living. Your derby entry runs today at Epsom going for my biggest bet £20 nothing to you but awful lot to me is horse worth thumbs up no worry’s if your busy understand you are top guy and trainer. Take care. Amy x”\n\nShe/he must think I came up the Clyde on a water biscuit.\n\n2nd June 2020\n\nOh, Sir Anthony, I so agree with what you said in the Racing Post today about making your own decisions and weighing the risks but be prepared for a possible backlash from Lee Mottershead and Alan Byrne. Mottersdhead, the Racing Post’s self appointed expert in virology, might accuse you of being arrogant, blinkered, misguided or even disaffected and Alan Byrne, their editor in chief and temporary resident epidemiologist, could remind you of how many people have died, and might still die – as if your views on horseracing mean that you don’t know or don’t care. He certainly might say that society must give you ‘permission’ to make a decision to go horseracing or even to have an opinion that there should be any horseracing at all. He might think your views are ill-judged or just ill-timed but, given that he chose to print them in his paper and he is not inclined to print views that he doesn’t share, maybe he is climbing down from his high horse or maybe he had some other, more personal, agenda – or should I say gripe – when he made his little attack on myself and Ralph Beckett.\n\nToday, I attended my first, and I dearly hope last, funeral during ‘lockdown’. My mother-in-law, Kathleen Ferguson’s death had nothing to do with Covid-19 but her last two months were sorely affected by it. Her 88-year-old husband, Duncan, didn’t see his wife for the last seven weeks of her life and he is struggling to make sense of that or the fact that there were only nine of us at her funeral. I suspect he might share Sir Anthony McCoy’s view that, at his age, he and his family can make their own decisions on the risks he should take.\n\nIt was, without doubt, the strangest funeral I have ever attended and it, along with Kathleen’s time in hospital and hospice, will be the most poignant memory of ‘lockdown’ and Covid – 19 for me. But, the fact that the hearse met us at her house and the neighbours stood out in the street to see her off was touching to say the least. That might be something to consider for what people are terming the ‘new normal’. Me, I’d just like a return to the old normal as soon as possible.\n\n7th April 2020\n\nI really like Andrew Balding’s idea (Racing Post interview with James Stevens) of pushing the whole flat season back a month. It seems so obvious now he has said it. I wish I had thought of it myself.\n\nOf course, it isn’t simple and there would be no end of obsticles to overcome, many of which might be totally out of racing’s control. But it would be an excellent target for all involved. As Andrew says, it just wouldn’t be practical to run some meetings, especially later in year, but, if we could work approximately to the template of a normal season run late, it would give everyone clear objectives and benefit all facets of the industry rather than saving some and leaving others to drown.\n\nCould the sales also be moved a month? Breeze-ups, horses-in-training sales, yearling sales? Hopefully, by December, the breeding stock sales could sit in their normal place. This would give some hope to those sectors, such as the pinhookers, which, at present are facing almost immediate ruin. There is a strong argument to say that yearling sales come too early in the year anyway and there would be little or no disadvantage in holding them later when everyone had had a chance to find their feet again.\n\nIt won’t be easy but I am certainly behind it. And, if plan A doesn’t work, move to plan B: maybe it would need to be 5 weeks, or even 6 weeks, or variable to suit some tracks, but it would provide us all with a common objective.\n\n31st March 2020\n\nMy attention has just been drawn to this statement by a North Yorkshire MP. It sets out clearly the situation on travelling for work and it is as we interpreted it from the start: you can travel for work if you absolutely cannot do your job from home. It is great to have it clarified.\n\nThe National Trainers Federation advised us to give every employee a letter saying that they were an essential worker and had to travel to and from work. We have done that but I now think I will also print this out and give it to them.\n\nhttps://www.kevinhollinrake.org.uk/news/can-i-continue-work\n\n24th March – 2020 ‘Lockdown’\n\nMy cedar wood shoe trees/stretchers arrived yesterday from Amazon. If we all get very bored during this ‘lockdown’ I may take time to tell you why I bought them but, for the moment, no matter. It did, however, set me thinking on whether or not the transport that brought them here could be deemed to be ‘essential’.\n\nWhat was ‘essential’ yesterday clearly isn’t, necessarily, deemed to be ‘essential’ today as goverment advice on movement of people and interaction between them is changing every day – sometimes every hour. But even yesterday I couldn’t say that the delivery of this item was, in any way, essential for me. I could easily do without this product, and, by no stretch of my imagination, could I even begin to think that it was essential for anyone I work with or, for that matter, anyone I know. But there is a strong argument that it was essential, certainly by yesterday’s definition of the word, to quite a lot of people. Some of them, those involved in the manufacture of this non-essential item, aren’t in this country (sadly, they are imported) but we can all understand the long term implications of a failure to sell product or even, for some, a delay in selling that product and getting the money in. And there is a chain of people, from those involved in the importation, through those responsible for packing and distribution, to the person driving the delivery van who depend on this trade for their livlihood.\n\nI went out on my bike in the afternoon – something I can still do today, even under ‘lockdown’ – to think about it. Normally I try to stick to the quietest roads but yesterday, like lots of people, I was nosy and I wanted to see how people were coping with the current crisis. Supprisingly, the roads were not appreciably quieter than usual although villages clearly were. As well as private cars, I saw a multitude of commercial vehicles. There were animal feed transporters (undoubtedly essential to the 94% of us who rely on this material being converted to more palatable fare for humans); a plethora of vehicles associated with the construction trade, from those carrying materials, plant, and machenery to the vans for the various tradesmen; loads of, very essential, supermarket chain delivery vans; one carrying office furtniture; a service bus which I passed as it went from Ripon to Middleham and on its return; a van carrying car parts; numerous vans and trucks that flashed past so quickly that I could get no impression of their purpose; and a Black Sheep Brewery van doing home deliveries of six-packs of beer.\n\nAs we are in a rural area, some of the vehicles were well known to me. Some were suppliers of ours and, dare I say, some of the builders and tradesmen might consider Johnston Racing as one of their biggest customers. There was no doubt in my mind that many of them would be sorely affected by any downturn in racehorse training in Middleham. If Middleham trainers ceased trading, many other local businesses would go the same way or would, at least, employ far fewer people than they do today.\n\nYou may be wondering what all this has got to do with horseracing – I am almost wondering myself – but I was trying to get my head round the definition of ‘essential transport’ as some in the racing media, and even at the BHA, were suggesting that taking horses to a racemeeting wouldn’t be essential transport, even if racing was taking place. Surely it would be as about essential as taking bricks to a building site.\n\nAnyway, it all changed again last night when we went into ‘lockdown’ and I was up until one in the morning trying, like many others, to get my head around the latest rules and guidelines. It wasn’t easy and, at times, it gets frustrating that much of the advice is very London-centric and hard to apply in our situation. Luckily, others were burning the midnight oil on the issue too and by 10pm the National Trainers Federation had issued guidlines which answered most people’s first question, ‘do I go to work and do we keep exercising the horses? The answer is yes but, although it might seem obvious to some, it wasn’t obvious to others and understandably so. There is very little information out there that can be directly attributed to the training of racehorses. I found myself trailing through advice given for other totally unrelated industries to find useful snippets. A guidline for the construction industry which states “if you are working on site, you can continue to do so. But follow Public Health England guidance on social distancing” seemed particularly clear and useful as our staff are, effectively, ‘working on site’ but, then again, I think the situation is different in Scotland where the government has, or is about to, close the construction sites. The dilema continues. What is ‘essential’ to one person, is not necessarily ‘essential’ to another. It isn’t as clear cut as those who spend all day in an office on a PC, and can take the work home on a laptop, may think. And, in any case, they are still heading in their droves to their places of work in London.\n\nSo, we are continuing to feed, exercise and care for our horses as normal but there are no races to enter them in. The business of training racehorses in many ways lends itself well to ‘social distancing’ – horses, even nose to tail, tend to leave their riders or handlers two metres apart – and it is helped by the lovely weather at the moment. Ironically, it is the little extras which we try to provide for our staff that are causing the most concern. We have had to switch our canteen to a take-away service and, even so, we are going to have to take further measures to avoid people queuing for food.\n\nOur mini-bus service is a concern and it was an area that, surprisingly, I could find no guidlines on. I searched for advice on people sharing transport to work but could find nothing other than countless references to tube trains and other public transport which, even in the worst-hit city, are still operating albeit with a reduced service.\n\nNo doubt there will be further changes to the rules, advise and guidlines. I appreciate the fact that people are changing their minds as new information becomes available to them and/or they are faced with new challenges. We just have to try to adapt.\n\nI’ll go out on my bike again this afternoon. Alone. I’ll observe what is going on and I’ll be very interested to see how it differs from yesterday.\n\n24th February 2020\n\nDouble Trigger died yesterday in his paddock at John and Sarah Haydon’s Clarendon Farm in Wiltshire. He was 28 years and 11 months old. A great age for a thoroughbred horse.\n\nIt is only a few weeks since videos were distributed on social media of him cantering around the paddock and cavorting like a young thing. He was in rude health till the end. What a way to go.\n\nIt seems that, no matter what champions I trained or might be lucky enough to train in future, I will always be remember more for having trained Double Trigger than for anything else. He captured the public’s imagination like no other animal that I have been associated with, and rightly so.\n\nHe was purchased for just 7,200 Irish pounds at Goffs Orby sales in October 1992 and he went on to win 14 races (13 of them Stakes races) from 29 starts, amassing £559,102 in prize-money. His wins included three Goodwood Cups, three Doncaster Cups, the Ascot Gold Cup, and the Italian St.Leger. He was third in the real St.Leger on just his fourth career start and he also finished runner up twice in the Ascot Gold Cup.\n\nHis career as a stallion inevitably revolved around jump racing and he didn’t scale any great heights – few, if any, stayers do these days – but it was a long and productive career at stud with the couple who kept him in his retirement.\n\nI was neither shocked nor particularly saddened by the news that he had gone. It had to happen soon and it happened suddenly and without any suffering. To share the phrase which has been adopted as a slogan by the new Welfare Board, Double Trigger had ‘a life well lived’.\n\n19th December 2019\n\nToday the BHA issued a notification to all trainers, by e mail, of ‘several minor changes to the rules of racing which will take effect from 20 January 2020’.\n\nOne reads: “UPDATE TO RULE (L) 53\n\nDisqualified persons\n\nRule (L) 53 has been updated to clarify that a Disqualified Person may not be involved in any way with a horse that has ever been subject to the Rules of Racing, unless the BHA directs otherwise”\n\nAm I reading this wrongly? It seems to me that the BHA is saying that a disqualified person cannot be involved in any way with a horse that has ever been in training or ‘subject to the rules of racing’. With other moves they are making, this might include most thoroughbred foals born and registered with Weatherbys.\n\nAre they really trying to say that a person who has been disqualified under the rules of racing can’t own, lease, borrow or otherwise be involved with an ex-racehorse for the purpose of hunting, showjumping, eventing, or even hacking. That is what it sounds like but surely that is too ridiculous for even the most enthusiastic bureaucrat at High Holborn to think they have the power to do that.\n\n17th December 2019\n\nOn thursday of last week, according to the Racing Post, Paul Struthers of the Professional Jockeys Association felt compelled to break silence on the row over apprentice jockey terms and conditions. It didn’t seem to me that he or his association had ever been silent on the issue but now, following letters from ill-informed members of the public in Sunday’s Racing Post, the BHA’s new chairman Annamarie Phelps joining the debate, and comments from trainer Mick Appleby in this morning’s Racing Post (their bias in covering this issue has been shocking), I feel compelled to break silence.\n\nFor a start, while this is all portrayed as being about failure of some trainers to pay their share of apprentices’ travelling expenses and this has been deemed to constitute abuse of vulnerable people by the BHA and the Racing Post, this has only demonstrated to me, Andrew Balding, Richard Fahey and a host of others that the BHA, the PJA and Lee Mottershead of the Racing Post have no conception of the economics of starting an apprentice jockey or of the costs of running racehorses.\n\nThe BHA’s method for calculating the average expenses per ride was seriously flawed. They based it on an analysis of 6 appentices having had 899 rides between them and, although they assumed zero expenses for rides for the employer or at meetings where the employer had a runner, it didn’t, amazingly, occur to them that apprentices with an average of 150 rides per annum were not typical. Yes, their method of calculating the average cost of getting to the races was reasonable, but to then assume that this average cost was incurred by all apprentice jockeys on the same proportion of rides was a nonsense. Two of my apprentices last year and this year were too young to drive when they started. Their expenses were zero. We had to get them to the races and that, on occasions, involved sending a vehicle and paying the driver.\n\nI freely admit that I am one of the trainers whose apprentices have not been submitting claims for half of their travelling expenses when going racing. We have always worked on the principle that, when we are responsible for the transport, we pay 100% and,when they have to get themselves there, they should try to travel with a senior jockey or someone else that is going (we have runners at most meetings) or, if they choose to drive themselves, they pay themselves. I think this generally works well. The inexperienced riders don’t need to incurr any expenses and, for the succesful apprentices, it isn’t uncommon for me to fly them to, and between, meetings. I wouldn’t dream of asking them to contribute towards that.\n\nBut, as I said at the outset, this is not really about travelling expenses. It seems that many, including those that wrote to the Racing Post and, most surprisingly, Mick Appleby, assume that apprentice jockeys are paid less than other members of staff of similar age and experience. I would argue that they are usually paid more and they get their wages, and all bonuses, whether they are at work or away at the races and also being paid to ride. This means that, in my yard, the lowest paid, 16-year-old, apprentice jockey, would be paid £42 per day ‘worked’ (before bonuses) whether that day was spent at my yard or travelling to and from the races. The BHA say they took this into account but it is hard to see that they have.\n\nThey freely admit that they did not take into account the cost of providing horses for apprentices to ride. Keith Dalgleish is the only apprentice that I can remember having his first ride on a horse I didn’t own. He was the only one that I considered to have the skill and experience to do justice to an owner’s horse and give it a fair chance.\n\nIn November 2017 I bought Ravenhoe from a group of my owners, albeit for just 5,000 gns, and in the next 18 months he ran 31 times. always ridden by our own apprentices or amateur jockey. He wasn’t the only horse I kept for the purpose. One of our apprentices who started in 2018 had a tremendous year and ended up with 89 rides. 48 of those rides came on horses I trained but, much more significantly, 23 of the rides, the ones to get him started, came on horses I owned. I generally say that, on average, a run costs an owner £3,000 in training and running costs. I accept that the type of horse we keep for apprentices runs far more than average and surely averages out at less per run so it might be reasonable to suggest that keeping and running a horse for apprentices to ride might cost, at least, £1,000 per run. Some – including, perhaps, the BHA, PJA, and Racing Post – won’t even accept that and seem to think that trainers can keep and train horses for free so, maybe, just for them, it might be worth pointing out that, for those 23 specific rides given to that apprentice in 2018, the travelling expenses and overtime (not including any normal wages) paid to the grooms leading up totalled £2,548. The horse transport costs, again just for those 23 rides alone, were £7,536 (I’ll wait for the claims, no doubt from someone that doesn’t own a horse, that it doesn’t cost me that). Of course, I haven’t accounted for prize-money won but nor have I accounted for the cost of training, entries or even the jockey at 50% of the riding fee. I hope all reasonably objective people can see that this is a huge expense in comparison to any possible return.\n\nOf course, that apprentice was not typical. This year, with our two mainstay apprentice horses having serious issues and being retired during the season, our two new apprentices got just ten and seven rides respectively. One had his first five rides and only winner on horses we owned. The other had five of of his seven rides on horses we owned and all of his rides on horses I trained.\n\nIt is little wonder to me that some trainers are so upset at the suggestion that they have been profiting from having apprentices and, in particular, the suggestion that there has been abuse of young people by employers. If the apprentice system has been abused it has been by those that make promises [of rides] that they cannot, or will not, keep in order to get staff. I am also aware of a number of apprentices who are operating as ‘apprenticed’ to a trainer but who are not employed, or paid a full time wage, by that trainer. I suspect that a similar situation may exist with Conditional jockeys, who get 100% of their riding fees and prize-money. I would be most surprised if they are being paid a full wage when not at work for the trainer holding the licence.\n\n29th May 2019 – Later\n\nVery interesting to hear that the BHA conducted three pre-race inquiries into runners trained by Irish trainer Denis Hogan. Apparently, the inquiries mostly centred around riding instructions that were to be given to the jockeys. The trainer contacted the BHA about this and was told that they have the power to do it. I am sure they do but I’d be very interested to hear how often this has occurred in the past and when. Is this a new idea?\n\nI have only once, that I can remember, had to attend a stewards inquiry before a race and it wasn’t in this country. I’ll leave you to guess where it was.\n\n29th May 2019\n\nIt was very refreshing to read Jamie Osborne’s Tuesday Column in the Racing Post yesterday. I hope this is to become a regular feature. We always have a good, sometimes heated, debate on racing, the meaning of life, and other vitally important issues when we meet up at the sales or races. It would be great to read his views on a regular basis.\n\n25th May 2019\n\nIt is reported in the Racing Post this morning, and I had already heard elsewhere, that there was annoyance at the late arrival of horses in the parade ring at Sandown on Thursday night. My horses were amongst those late in the parade ring for the Henry ll stakes and I very much sympathise with those who would have liked them to be there earlier but it is totally wrong to suggest that it is deliberate and that we aim for the horses to arrive late. The previous race was a little late off and two of my three jockeys were late to weigh out for the Henry 11. I already had Making Miracles saddled before Charlie arrived with the next two saddles and we had separate teams saddling Dee Ex Bee and Austrian School but, nonetheless, there was apparently a call for our horses to come to the parade ring before we were ready. I didn’t notice but apparently Mekong didn’t come to the parade ring at all for that race. Sir Michael Stoute must have had dispensation if that was the case.\n\nI do accept that the horses should be in the parade ring before the race but I would be most disappointed if the right to saddle in the stables was withdrawn as commentator Richard Hoiles is apparently suggesting. Saddling boxes on many tracks are inadequate and can be a very unpleasant place to be with a fractious horse. Surely, the most important thing for all concerned is to get the horses to the race ready to do their best and not to have them upset before they even get to the parade ring.\n\nThe first race at Sandown on Thursday night was over six minutes late – I don’t know why, I didn’t have a runner in it. – and officials were trying to catch up. The second race was over two minutes late but the Henry 11 Stakes started 1 minute and 18 seconds after the appointed time: the closest to scheduled off time of any race on the night. That is largely down to it being the smallest field (two other races had only one more participant) but it shows that the horses were all at the start in good time and that delays from the first race had been made up.\n\n23rd May 2019\n\nBefore continueing further on the watering debate can I stress again that I am not having a go at any particular racetrack or clerk of the course. This issue is a problem for racing as a whole and, perhaps, even for the future strength and development of the thoroughbred breed: we should be colectively looking for a policy that can be implemented, and enforced, by the BHA to address it. But maybe we don’t do ‘collectively’ too well in racing.\n\nYork have, this morning, in their usual super-efficient way, sent out a going update in advance of their Saturday meeting. It states that the ground is Good to Firm and that there has been no rain since the Dante. They then state that they are watering each night ‘to replace moisture’.\n\nThey are clearly aiming for Good to Firm ground, as BHA guidlines suggest, and doing their best to produce it, to order, on the day. But I don’t think I need to be an agronomist, or even a gardener, to know that there is nothing natural about watering every night to replace moisture lost. Surely it is this approach to grass management – perhaps forced on racecourses by BHA guidlines and trainer pressure – that is causing many of the problems we encounter on tracks in recent years with a loose surface and sand filler flying even on ground that is described as Good to Firm. Is it not fairly obvious that, if a small amount of water is applied to grass on a daily basis, the roots will always be near to the surface and that constant supply of moisture.\n\nWe have, perhaps, forgotten what it was like under the old Jockey Club instructions – or were they just guidlines? – which said courses should only water to promote grass growth and not to alter the state of the going. In those days, if I remember rightly, Firm ground was much more common and we raced on Hard at times. Is the new system better? Do we get more or less non-runners due to going? Are the horses sounder than they were? My gut feeling is that that was a better and certainly fairer system. Back then the clerks of the courses could quite simply blame nature and the weather: two things which we all accept are outwith their control.\n\n22nd May 2019 …. later\n\nWell, having said that the Racing Post article came across as me ‘bashing’ clerks of courses, so, when I read it again now, did my Bletherings. In short, I am saying that clerks of courses are wrong to aim for softer than Good to Firm ground and that they are wrong to water so regularly but I can understand why they do it. The answer is to take the responsibility away from them or, at least, have rules and checks in place to ensure that they are genuinely aiming for Good to Firm ground.\n\n22nd May 2019\n\nIt is unfortunate that yesterday’s piece in the Racing Post about watering came across as me ‘bashing’ clerks of courses and particularly unfortunate that two individual tracks were singled out. I have the utmost symapthy for clerks of courses over this issue. They are in an invidious position and much of the blame surely sits with trainers who complain about watering but are quick to withdraw horses when they perceive the ground to be too firm. I get the impression that there are more non-runners on Good to Firm ground than there are on Good ground and, if that is the case, it is little wonder that many clerks of courses play safe and aim for Good ground or, at least, water to ensure that there is no chance of the ground going to Firm.\n\nThe fault here surely lies with the BHA’s failure to take control of the issue. They are very quick to point out that they provide guidlines, not rules, on what courses should be aiming for and the official going description is left to the, potentially biased, clerk of the course. How can something which will be written in stone in the form book for ever more, as if it were fact, be down to the opinion of one person. Even when going descriptions are changed mid meeting the, clearly wrong"
