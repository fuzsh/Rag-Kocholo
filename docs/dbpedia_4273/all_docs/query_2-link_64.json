        "text": "Six-time Derby winning trainer Sir Michael Stoute was formally inducted into racing's Hall of Fame on Sunday.\n\nHe became the first active trainer to be officially recognised as one of racing's greats and just the third trainer overall after Vincent O'Brien and Sir Henry Cecil.\n\n\"To be inducted into the Hall of Fame and joining Vincent O'Brien, who was my hero, and probably the greatest trainer that ever lived, and Henry Cecil, who was also a very good friend. I am very grateful,\" said Sir Michael.\n\nThe ten-time champion trainer, who will be forever associated with the brilliant, but ill-fated Derby winner Shergar, received his specially cast medal at the Rowley Mile during the QIPCO Guineas Festival.\n\n\"You never forget your first Derby winner. Shergar had won his Derby trials in outstanding fashion so he was odds-on,” said Sir Michael. “ He was expected to win, we expected him to win, but it was still a great thrill. I think he won by about ten lengths and (Walter) Swinburn was pulling him up by the last furlong.\"\n\nHe received his medal along with with Christopher Tsui, owner of Sea the Stars, who became the latest equine inductee into the Hall of Fame.\n\nSarah Denniff, head girl at Sir Michael Stoute's Freemason Lodge yard in Bury Road, said: \"I think Michael being inducted into the Hall of Fame is very fitting. Everybody would agree he completely deserves it. He sees things other people just don't see, even when you've been here for 20 years.\n\n\"A recent example would be with our Derby winner last year (Desert Crown). Obviously we all knew he was a good horse and we all had high hopes for him.\n\n\"A couple of weeks before the Dante, he came back from what I would describe as a routine gallop, which was a nice piece of work which we were all happy with, but there was just something different about the boss like he had just seen something and his demeanour changed after that. It was like he just knew he had a Derby winner.\"\n\nLaunched in 2021, the Hall of Fame set out to immortalise the modern greats of racing, both human and equine, from 1970 onwards. It now has its own display in Newmarket’s National Horseracing Museum where among the exhibits are Frankie Dettori’s riding boots and the Hall of Fame medal presented to the late Lester Piggott."
