The Barbadian-Brit is also the most successful trainer in Royal Ascot history, with 79 winners at the iconic meeting.

Who is Sir Michael Stoute?

Sir Michael Ronald Stoute is a thoroughbred horse racing trainer.

Born on October 22 1945 in Barbados, where his dad was Chief of Police, he left the island aged 19 to pursue a career as a racehorse trainer.

He first became an assistant to trainer Pat Rohan before setting out on his own in 1972.

His first win as a trainer came in April 1972 when Sandal, his father's horse, won at Newmarket racecourse.

He has been champion trainer in the UK ten times and he has trained 15 British Classic winners, including five winners of the Derby.

The 73-year-old has also enjoyed big-race success abroad, winning dozens of Group 1's including the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Dubai World Cup.

Stoute is having an excellent season, with four winners at Royal Ascot in June taking him clear of the late Sir Henry Cecil as the leading trainer at the meeting.

The most famous horse to be trained by Stoute, Shergar swept all before him in 1981.

Under his care, the champion racehorse won six times, including the Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes.
