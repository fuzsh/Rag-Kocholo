        "text": "Country: United States\n\nLanguage: English\n\nAbout the film:\n\nWinner of the People’s Choice Award at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival\n\nAmerican Fiction (2023) received five nominations at the 96th Academy Awards, winning Best Adapted Screenplay for writer-director Cord Jefferson. The film also received two Golden Globe nominations and five Independent Spirit Award nominations.\n\nThelonious “Monk” Ellison’s writing career has stalled because his work isn’t deemed “Black enough.” Monk, a writer and English professor, writes a satirical novel under a pseudonym, aiming to expose the publishing world’s hypocrisies. The book’s immediate success forces him to get deeper enmeshed in his assumed identity and challenges his closely-held worldviews.\n\nAbout the filmmaker:\n\nCord Jefferson is an American writer, director, journalist, and essayist who’s worked on multiple TV series including Succession (2018), Watchmen (2009), and The Good Place (2016). His directorial debut American Fiction (2023) is a comedy-drama film which won the People’s Choice Award at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nSee our upcoming films\n\nMAJOR SUPPORT\n\nOhio Arts Council\n\nGreater Columbus Arts Council\n\nThe Columbus Foundation\n\nCampus Partners\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts"
