        "text": "I hope all y’all American Pajibans enjoyed a filling and fulfilling Thanksgiving yesterday. Enjoy your food hangovers today. For everyone else, welcome to Friday! We’re glad you made it.\n\nIf you didn’t have enough forced family time yesterday, watch this trailer for Family Switch, the latest take on the awkward body-swap genre. It’s different because it’s not one, not two, but three, three, THREE body swaps in one! Bwahahahaha.\n\nCome for the weird baby/dog body-swap jokes, stay for the winking reference to 13 Going On 30 when Family Switch premieres on Netflix on November 30th.\n\nIf that was a little too wholesome for you, perhaps I can interest you in some horny history on Starz. Julianne Moore and Nicholas Galitzine (Red, White & Royal Blue, Bottoms) star as Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham in Mary & George. A mother and son team who made it their mission to seduce King James I to install George as his lover in order to gain power, influence, and wealth.\n\nYou can always count on Starz to bring the on-screen steaminess and anachronistic needle drops. Mary & George will begin on Starz sometime in 2024.\n\nAlso coming sometime next year is Giancarlo Esposito’s new show on AMC, Parish. The story follows a taxi driver whose life is turned upside down when he agrees to pick up a Zimbabwean gangster mostly known for exploiting undocumented immigrants at the U.S. southern ports.\n\nThe six-episode series will also star Zackary Momoh (Doctor Sleep), Arica Himmel (Mixed-ish), Ivan Mbakop (Red Notice), and Ekow Blade."
