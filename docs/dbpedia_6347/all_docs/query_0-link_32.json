        "text": "Coral Palms, Pt. 1\n\nJake and Holt remain in Florida, adjusting to their new lives under the Witness Protection Program, while Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis is still on the loose. Their one human link to their regular lives is U.S. Marshall Karen Haas (guest star Maya Rudolph, \"Maya and Marty\"), but their anonymity may be in danger when a video of them goes viral.\n\nUnorthodox\n\nWhen David Zelinsky (guest star Braeden Lemasters) shows up to school visibly beaten and sexually assaulted, Detectives Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) look to David's tutor (guest star Noel Joseph Allain) and his Rabbi (guest star Bob Dishy) for answers. The investigation soon leads to one of David's troubled classmates, Jack Trembley (guest star Alexander Gould), as more victims begin to come forward. The case quickly turns into a media circus as Trembley's attorney, Roxana Hickey (guest star Rhea Perlman), uses it as an opportunity for her own self-promotion. Also starring: Adam Beach, Dann Florek, Ice-T, Diane Neal, Tamara Tunie, Richard Belzer, and B.D. Wong.\n\nFear of Flying\n\nHomer is awarded free airline tickets only to discover that Marge is afraid to fly. Marge enlists the aid of a therapist, Dr. Zweig. With the doctor's help, Marge realizes her phobia comes from a youthful trauma involving her father, and she is cured."
