        "text": "Hello, Spongey here.\n\nWelcome to the finale of DCOM MONTH 3!\n\nAs you recall, I put this up to a vote. So it makes sense that we’d close out with whatever got the most votes.And only 1 got voted on more than once so we’re going with that.\n\nAnd it’s…a random throw away film. Huh. I have no idea why either wanted this one, but you got it, my friends.\n\nThere’s not much to say going into this one. This aired last year to very little fanfare. They spent so much time hyping up Adventures in Babysitting that this got not much advertising time.\n\nThey had some ads but not as much as other DCOM’s. So of course it didn’t do too well.I blame that and that the stars aren’t amazing bankable. We got Kirby Buckets and Peyton list, from Jessie/Bunk’d.\n\nThey were trying to pump her up, but that kinda failed. I mean, Bunk’d’s status is TBD at the moment, even if I wouldn’t be mad if it ended (We’ll get to it someday,I swear).\n\nI remember this being fine, compared to what I expected. It’s based on a book but I haven’t read so I can’t say too much. A friend from a blog of his own looked into it though, so here’s a link to it:\n\nhttp://nickanddisneyreviewed.blogspot.com/2016/10/the-swap-review-young-adult-novel.html\n\nAnd yeah, this is a Freaky Friday type movie from the company who made Freaky Friday…twice! I recently watched an anime film with this concept called Your Name but I imagine this won’t be as …interesting in a good way.\n\nBy the way, check that one out.\n\nThe writers have done little of note, and the director mostly does Kirby Buckets episodes. Fitting. He also oddly has episodes of Workaholics. Weird.\n\nAnyway, is this one any good? Let’s find out.\n\nThis, is The Swap\n\nThe movie opens with Kirby Buckets himself (I’ll call him that that to be “funny”) playing Hockey, after the obligatory opening pop song which is this case is ear rapeingly awful.\n\nSeriously, its got shitty autotune and everything. I can’t describe it that well, but ouch. We also meet Peyton List who does rhythmic gymnastics or something like that.\n\nKirby’s problem is that his kind of a jerk and I guess Peyton’s prob;em for now involves the school cutting finding for these kind of things They have a chance of escaping that though so we have our conflicts!\n\nAs you can imagine, we keep cutting between these 2 and it’s decently edited to give us a idea of how both sides are.\n\n“Don’t blow it!”\n\nThat’s why I say to Disney Channel all the time.\n\nLater, Kirby is playing with these guys who are of course Disney Channel jerks who call him names no one ever says. He breaks his phone and has to get a new one.\n\n“Mom sure did love her sparkles”\n\n…That’s extremely clunky, yikes. I suppose it was easy to tell we had a Dead mom but come on. Speaking of Mom’s, Peyton’s seems to be hippie-ish but at least shes’ kinda hot.\n\nAnd her friend is named Sassy. I hope that’s a bad nick name,\n\nWe also get one a rather recent tiring cliche: Text’s on screen. I don’t know, it’s not a big deal but it’s gotten annoying. What happens here could have been conveyed without it.\n\nSassy has fallen in with the Alpha Bitches which is now Peyton’s conflict. She even overhears her being a bitch in the bathroom.\n\n“It was super sad when her Dad left”\n\n\\More amazing dialogue!\n\nI feel like getting an idea what Sassy was like before would make this stronger but whatever. Kirby and Peyton finally meet and of course talk about how the other sides has it easier.\n\nThe nurse makes them shut up and just text about as they just magically have each others numbers.\n\n“I wish I had your life”\n\nSubtle. We’re following Lizzie McGuire logic on this one. And as soon they both say they’d like the other life….they swap….through the phones.\n\nYep. This makes no sense and spoilers, all their bullshit explanations won’t help at all. Zapped’s phone stuff made more sense.\n\n“What the what?”\n\nWrong Disney Channel Theme Weekend.\n\nThey quickly figure they swapped and of course freak out about it. See, Peyton’s Mom say putting too much emotional energy into an object will make it a totem and give it power over you, which is what we’re going with as our expiation.\n\nBoth the phones happened to belong to missing parenting figures, what are the odds? Mom must have been more recent as Peyton’s got a flip phone.\n\nSo now they must fake being each other until they can figure out what to do. Them telling each other what to do gives us more clunky exposition.\n\nBy the way, Sassy likes Kirby. You can imagine how awkward this is. Speaking of which, the bully guy shows up and hits on Peyton. He looks way older than her. Ew.\n\nThat stuff is thankfully short as they now official begin living each others lives. Peyton as Kirby accidentally agrees to “chop the salad” which is not as sexually as it sounds.\n\nIt means cutting his hair. Honestly it looks way better this way, it was a rat’s nest before. Meanwhile, Kirby as Peyton asks Mom about the totem thin but just finds out she deactivated Peyton’s flip phone, although that won’t be official until Sunday.\n\nTheir real names are Ellie and Jack, by the way. Still won’t call them that though, just had to say it once. He tells Peyton and they both say NOOOO in the most weaksauce way possible.\n\nThings don’t do too well so far, especially on Peyton as Kirby’s side. Especially with Dad being a jerk. The mom thing can only justify him so much but more on that later.\n\nKirby and Peyton talk about this further which ends up being a nice little moment.Would be less nice if they weren’t having the phone call while Peyton’s body is taking a bath.\n\nYeah.\n\nThey figure they need to improve each other’s lives to get this all back to normal. Kirby’s Dad pops up to take the phone away because jerk. He gets worse as we find out he makes him train hard the next morning.\n\nI do like this part where his brothers actually help him out given we’ve mainly seen them as jerks so far.\n\nWord spreads that Peyton talks to Kirby and the friend that likes him is worried. And right away she’s like “Nah” and backs off. That wasn’t pointless.\n\nBack with Kirby’s body, we get a random moment regarding the dad Mom which is kinda nice in execution. Later, she/he talks to the bully guy and drops a truth bomb about how insecure he is.\n\nI love how this really troubles him..\n\nPeyton’s body slips out to extend the phone plan only to find it was…Dad who canned it. I think that’s going to be a deal later. But that’s not important, Peyton has to fix thing’s with Sassy at some party.\n\n“Why are you friends with this chick anyway?”\n\nGood question.\n\nWe see further later that the bully guy has changed. It’s silly but pretty funny. We get a “Getting ready” montage and move on to the party. The bully helps Kirby’s body sneak out to go a get together of his own which is a good payoff for that plot point.\n\nThat means we have a contrast with the girl party and the boy party. Yeah, this is like that other “magic phone” movie in a ways, just…better.\n\nSassy is randomly on Peyton’s ass again, making that previous scene pointless. So now she drops her as a friend for reasons.\n\nTrough some events that confuse me, Peyton’s body says she and Kirby are tight so then he has to show up and they have to pretend to like each other or something.\n\nThen they drop it like it’s pointless and go back to Sassy being a bitch. Peyton finally calls her out which is very satisfying. They go home and we get the scene get a sad song.\n\nWhich in execution is effective enough. I especially like the brothers handing him this little note that Jack wrote his goals on. Later, they tell this one friend about this situation and we just skip to him believing them,\n\nThey discover they can tap into their original body’s powers because reasons, so it’s possible to have a training montage!\n\nBoth of their important events are on the same day (because of course they are) and we get to the day. We get a montage of the two events and we see they have learned to do them rather well.\n\nThey find both of their things and yeah there wasn’t much to say about all that. But even after that, they don’t switch back meaning there is some unfinished business.\n\nKirby reveals it was Dad that canned the phone contract as he wanted a new family plan.\n\n“…Oh. For his new family”\n\nOuch.\n\nThey sulk off and return to their parents.\n\n“I made varsity”\n\n“Barely and only because everyone else played worse”\n\nOh good, he’s still an asshole. Meanwhile, Peyon’s mom confronts “her” about the whole Dad thing which leads to a really nice moment. I did not expect some actually nice stuff when I first saw this.\n\n“Kirby” finally confronts asshole Dad.\n\n“Do you even love me at all?”\n\nNeedless to say, this part is amazing. The bastard deserves it. They both feel a lot better after that and realize this might be the thing their switch was all about.\n\nThey meet up and text each other saying “I wish I had my life back” and boom, it works. And there’s a joke where Kirby had Peyton put on other layers beneath her main clothes because we couldn’t end this without one joke like that.\n\nSo now their lives are fixed and things are winding down. Kirby returns home as Dad apologizes for being such a Dick. His excuse is that after Mom passed he felt like he wanted to be tough but ….eh.\n\nThis reminds me a lot of Chicken Little, with this guy technically being a worse parent. The difference here is that rant was way more satisfying since this movie blamed the parent more than that one did.\n\nNot that this does it that much better on the Dad end, but at least he directly apologizes.\n\nAs for the Sassy stuff, she randomly apologizes but Peyton tells her it isn’t enough, which is good. Kirby and Peyton introduces their parents to each other for a forced pairing.\n\nI hope that realize they might become siblings now.\n\nThe end. Yeah, let’s end on that note. That was an okay wrap up, even if it’s clear they front loaded all the good stuff at the end there.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis was a mixed bag but in general, it was better than I expected. The main flaws come from the typical DCOM problems you expect. The explanation of the switch is really stupid and there’s some dumb stereotypes here and there.\n\nThere are some plot elements that could have been written better. I like Sassy’s role in the story but on it’s own it feels kind of pointless. I suppose Peyton’s conflict of being sad over Dad wasn’t quite the most eventful but I feel like it could have been handled better.\n\nMost of the flaws, minus the magic crap can be forgiven but they are noticeable with how good some things are. Watching this again, I realize how close to really good this is.\n\nThe leads do a good job being each other to the point where I didn’t have that problem remembering bodies have swamped like I sometimes do in these kind of movies.\n\nCharacter wise they don’t go that deep but that’s fine as the events make up for it. Speaking of deep, that’s what this movies gets right. Their emotional struggles work mostly well.\n\nI say mostly as the pay off is better than the set up. Peyton’s Daddy issues aren’t shown that much but that last scene still works. I like that he never shows up, it reminds of Blendins’ Game where they could have gone through this whole thing but they decide that if he’s not gonna show up, he’s not worth it.\n\nThis isn’t nearly as good but it works. Her arc’s also nicely contrast Kirby and despite some wonky parts, they do juggle them both equally. Sassy ends up being beyond salving for now and her Dad is too late but Kirby was able to fix his similar issues before it got to that point.\n\nThe actual body swap stuff is typical and it’s clear they cared about the actual conflict more, which I’m fine. There is some okay stuff, with the bully being the best part of the whole thing.\n\nHe was pretty funny with how he turned good and all that. He even served a good use later on.\n\nOverall, the most was mixed but in the end I will say I kinda liked it. It had plenty of small problems but I appreciate that they went a bit deeper than they needed to. There’s some nice moments and the ending worked me.\n\nIt could have been great but it’s already better than it had any right to be. While Adventures in Babysitting was content to play it safe and rely on star power, this at least tried to take some chances.\n\nIt’s not all good but I give them credit for trying. Could have been better, but also could have been far worse. As it is, it was a better on a re-watch and I’m glad we ended on an okay note./\n\nRating: Decent\n\nSo that was DCOM Month 3. A solid selection and none of them were too weak. Proud Family wasn’t too flawed and Adventures in Babysitting at least was a remake of a better version, and the others were downright okay.\n\nSo the Drama was the best of course. Thanks for voting, for those that did. Voting stuff usually doesn’t turn out too well but this was fun.\n\nBut man am I glad to be back to my normal schedule next time. Next time,my brother’s birthday comes up so you know what that means.\n\nSee ya."
