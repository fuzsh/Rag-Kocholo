        "text": "Jennifer Saunders admitted she was ‘scared’ swapping comedy for drama as she joined the cast of Netflix’s newest thriller, The Stranger.\n\nThe new series is an adaption of the book by the same name by American author Harlen Coban, and follows the life of Adam Price (Richard Armitage) whose entire world comes crashing down when a mysterious stranger (Game of Thrones’ Hannah John Kamen) reveals a secret about his wife.\n\nJennifer stars as cafe owner Heidi in the programme, the best friend of police detective Johanna Griffin (Siobhan Finneran) and told press at a screening ahead of the show’s launch that the change in pace was daunting.\n\n‘I was thrilled to be asked,’ she revealed. ‘And also slightly scared because it is quite a departure for me. But the script was amazing and so gripping.\n\n‘I’ve read the book and its an extraordinary story, it’s an extraordinary cast and it was an absolute no brainer.’\n\nTaking her further away from her comedic routes in French and Saunders, the 61-year-old also had to deal with some high-tension action sequences involving her character.\n\nNow, you didn’t get that in Ab Fab!\n\nDescribing the stunts as ‘thrilling,’ the actress and screenwriter revealed that she worked ‘quite hard’ in preparation.\n\n‘I mean, I love it,’ she continued. ‘Give me some good props and prosthetics and I’m away. It was intense I have to say.\n\n‘It was quite hard and thanks to Daniel the director as he saw me through it.’\n\nWell, we for one can’t wait to see it!\n\nAlso starring alongside Jennifer in the upcoming project are Shaun Dooley, acting legend Stephen Rea and Buffy icon Anthony Head, who plays her on-screen husband.\n\nThe Stranger is just the latest adaption of a Harlan Coban book to be adapted by Netflix – the hit drama Safe was also based on a Coban novel.\n\nThe Stranger drops 30 January on Netflix\n\nMORE : Netflix and Cheer’s Varsity spirit ‘in talks to work together again’ after viral series"
