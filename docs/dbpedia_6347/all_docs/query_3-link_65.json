        "text": "Two actors pose as women to win an inheritance, but that creates romantic complications in “Leading Ladies.”\n\nCurtain Players will present Ken Ludwig’s comedy, which will open with a preview Thursday in Galena.\n\n“It’s a farce about love and normalcy … with quite a bit of physical slapstick,” director Michael Fusco said.\n\n“Ludwig’s approach to farce is a little more polished and sophisticated. … His dialogue is sharp, and his situations are extremely clever.”\n\nSet in 1952 in Pennsylvania, the two-act, 2-hour, 15-minute play revolves around Leo Clark and Jack Gable, two mediocre British actors reduced to putting on Shakespearean scenes in fraternal lodges.\n\nThey are out of money when Leo hears about Florence Snider, a dying woman in nearby York, Pennsylvania. According to Leo’s misreading of a newspaper story, Snider is looking for her long-lost nephews so she can leave them most of her $3 million fortune.\n\nLeo and Jack decide to impersonate the woman’s adult nephews, Max and Steve — until they learn that the missing nephews are actually nieces.\n\n“Undaunted by that fact, the two guys decide to pose as Maxine and Stephanie,” Fusco said.\n\nSteve Salyer plays the double role of Leo and Maxine.\n\n“In the beginning, all Leo wants is money, but by the end, he wants love and security, home and family,” Salyer said.\n\nJack Gable (Jaimie Schwartz) has been Leo’s reluctant acting partner for years.\n\n“We’re good mates, but Leo’s the one who keeps it going,” Salyer said. “Jack really isn’t as dedicated. Only Leo could convince Jack to spend time doing something as fraught with disaster as touring Amish country in the 1950s performing Shakespeare at Moose lodges.”\n\nSalyer had never played a woman onstage.\n\n“It’s daunting and exciting,” he said.\n\n“Growing up as a gay man in the ’70s and ’80s, I spent the first half of my life repressing every gesture that could possibly be interpreted as ‘feminine.’ In this play, I can finally forget all that … and simply have fun exploring this wonderful character.”\n\nPlaying a woman credibly is key to the show, Salyer said.\n\n“It’s a complete transformation. … When Jaimie and I play Stephanie and Maxine, the audience has to be convinced that the other characters believe that we’re women,” he said.\n\nAudrey-Marie Craddick plays Meg Snider, who is in line for one-third of Florence’s fortune.\n\n“She’s a big-city girl in a small town,” Craddick said. “Meg has all these ambitions and dreams she wants to accomplish, but she can’t do that in York, Pennsylvania.”\n\nMeg is engaged to marry the much-older Duncan, a stuffy minister, when she meets gender-disguised Leo and Jack. Leo falls in love with her.\n\n“They completely turn her world upside down. She adores the fact that she has cousins, which she never had before,” Craddick said. “She really clicks with (Maxine) because Maxine is in the theater, and Meg adores theater.”\n\nCraddick appreciates Ludwig’s work after seeing “Leading Ladies” elsewhere and viewing his Broadway comedies “Lend Me a Tenor” and “Moon Over Buffalo.”\n\n“Ludwig is brilliant, especially with the comic timing,” she said. “A big part of what makes his comedies funny is that the audience knows something that the characters are oblivious to, yet it’s so obvious. … My favorite part of being onstage is reading lines that make people laugh.”\n\nmgrossberg1@gmail.com\n\n@mgrossberg1\n\nAt a glance\n\nWhat: “Leading Ladies”\n\nWho: Curtain Players\n\nWhere: 5691 Harlem Road, Galena\n\nContact: 614-360-1000, www.curtainplayers.org\n\nShowtimes: 8 p.m. Thursday (preview), Friday, Saturday, Sept. 13-14 and Sept. 20-21; and 2 p.m. Sept. 15 and Sept. 22\n\nTickets: $17, or $15 for students and senior citizens, or “pay what you want” for the preview\n\nListen to the Life in the 614 podcast:"
