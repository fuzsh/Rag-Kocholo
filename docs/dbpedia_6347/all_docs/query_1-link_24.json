        "text": "What is a Coming of Age Movie\n\nLet’s define coming of age movie\n\nThe coming of age genre is one of many film genres. You can learn about them all in our ultimate guide to movie genres. Like any genre or subgenre, this one has its tropes and cliches. But when done right, these movies can be woven into the cultural fabric for an entire generation.\n\nComing Of Age Movies Meaning\n\nWhat is a coming of age movie?\n\nA coming of age movie is centered around the themes of youth, growing up, and maturation with a strong focus on a central character arc. These films follow a singular protagonist as they “come of age,” meaning they progress into the next stage of their life. Protagonists are typically young and facing the first major dilemma, ordeal, or awakening of their life. The genre often centers around major shifts or milestones in a character’s life as they grow up. The coming of age genre can also be found in literature such as Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird or Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women.\n\nComing of Age Characteristics:\n\nFocused on the arc of the protagonist\n\nTypically young characters just before adulthood\n\nCentered around major life changes and milestones\n\nWhat Does Coming of Age Movies Mean\n\nStaples of the coming of age film genre\n\nComing of age films always include dramatic elements and often inject elements such as comedy or music. They may even blend in other genres such as action or horror, though this is less common.\n\nMost coming of age films include a degree of romance — often the protagonist’s first romantic experience. However, there are exceptions such as Lean on Pete, which contains no humor nor romance, yet is a coming of age film regardless.\n\nIs Lean on Pete an anti-coming-of-age film? • Coming of age movies examples\n\nTransitional periods in life are a common focal point for coming of age films. The awkwardness and uncertainty of youth are frequent areas of exploration for the genre as well.\n\nThe common themes and pacing of coming of age films lend themselves well to slice-of-life narratives and to highly personal stories. This is why many coming of age films take on an autobiographical or semi-autobiographical nature.\n\nThey also often use the writer/director’s own life and experiences as the basis for the protagonist’s journey. Below is a breakdown of Booksmart, one of the best examples to come out in years.\n\nAn analysis of Booksmart, a modern coming-of-age classic\n\nWhether a film contains all of the hallmarks of the genre or just a couple of them, there is one aim that all coming of age films strive to capture...\n\nComing of Age in Movies\n\nThe experience of growing up\n\nThe act of growing up and all of the trials and tribulations associated with it provide the stomping ground for all coming of age films. High school is likely the most focused-on period of life that coming of age films like to explore.\n\nMovies like Superbad, Juno, Rebel Without a Cause, Lady Bird and Edge of Seventeen all use high-school-aged protagonists.\n\nWhy Lady Bird is so great • Coming of Age Film\n\nThe opening and closing scenes of Booksmart highlight the evolution the characters have gone through, but also shows us that some things will never change. Check out one of the first scenes of the movie, which we imported into StudioBinder’s screenwriting software.\n\nBooksmart script\n\nHere, the writers establish that Molly and Amy are inseparable. Now, take a look at the final scene:\n\nBooksmart screenplay\n\nThe first scene is mirrored, emphasizing the duo’s progression. Molly is now driving, and the two are ready to start building their own lives. But the final lines, where they decide to get pancakes before they part, shows us that their friendship is still strong.\n\nThat being said, high school isn’t the only period in a protagonist’s life that coming of age films like to explore. Growing up can happen at different ages and in different stages throughout a lifetime.\n\nCharacters can be younger, such as in The Fits, the Apu Trilogy, or the absolutely fantastic Eighth Grade.\n\nWhy Eighth Grade works so well\n\nOr, the protagonist can be older, and the film can explore slightly different themes involving maturation. For example, the transitional period between high school and college in Everybody Wants Some, the search for purpose post-college in The Graduate, or the awkward shift into adulthood in the instant classic Frances Ha.\n\nWatch our video breakdown of The Graduate's iconic ending. The moment Benjamin and Elaine share is a perfect example of characters unsure of how to handle the next phase of their lives.\n\nThe Graduate Video Essay • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nIn the case of Boyhood, all transitional stages of the protagonist’s life are explored from the time when he was six years old all the way into the start of his freshman year of college.\n\nIn a way, Boyhood might be the most “complete” coming of age story ever told, and the use of the real passage of time and the aging of the cast all enable the story to be told with unfettered authenticity.\n\nThe power of Boyhood • Movies about coming of age\n\nWe’ve already looked at quite a few examples of coming of age in movies, but let’s close things out by looking at a few more examples and dividing them up into two distinct categories: traditional and alternative.\n\nDefine Coming of Age Movie\n\nTraditional examples\n\nTraditional coming of age films are a sort of “you know it when you see it” breed of movie. They have a particular feel, mood, pacing, and general aesthetic. Young characters navigating major life changes, often with comedy and romance blended together with the drama.\n\nThis includes films like Almost Famous, The Way Way Back, Submarine, 20th Century Women, and Sing Street amongst many others. Coming of age films frequently make use of great needle drops.\n\nAnd nowhere is that more evident than in the one-two punch of the musically centered Almost Famous and Sing Street.\n\nAlmost Famous video essay • Coming of age movies examples\n\nFor more coming of age examples, be sure to check out our rundown of the best coming of age films ever made.\n\nNext, let’s examine a few alternative examples.\n\nWhat is a Coming of Age Movie\n\nAlternative examples\n\nOutside of the more traditional look and feel, we find a number of alternative coming of age films. These are movies that hit the hallmarks of the genre while subverting others or combining elements of other genres like action or horror.\n\nBadlands injects neo-western and action elements into an alternative coming of age romance. While Let the Right One In, Raw, and Ginger Snaps all use the horror genre to tell coming of age journeys.\n\nIs Raw a masterpiece? • Coming of age film meaning\n\nSome alternative coming of age films use the horror elements as clever allegories for matters inherent to the coming of age genre and the awkward process of growing up and maturing.\n\nRaw uses cannibalism to explore budding sexuality, while Ginger Snaps presents a link between turning into a werewolf and the start of menstruation.\n\nTake a look at this conversation between Ginger, her sister, and their school nurse:\n\nGinger Snaps script PDF\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Best Coming of Age Movies Ever\n\nNow that you have a thorough understanding of what exactly a coming of age film is, it’s the perfect time to explore the best films that the genre has to offer. Learn more about some of the films mentioned in this post and discover a whole bevy of additional coming of age movies, up next.\n\nUp Next: Best Coming of Age Movies →"
