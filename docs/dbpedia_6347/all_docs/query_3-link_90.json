        "text": "Now My Other Half is embarking on an eight-date tour of East Anglia next month and will stop by the town’s Headgate Theatre on April 13.\n\nThe brainchild of Christopher Sainton-Clark, the dark comedy thriller follows the lives of a troubled young couple who, out of the blue, swap bodies.\n\nWith an important book signing due the following day, the pair must learn how to become and act meticulously like each other.\n\nBut as the lines start to blur during the Arts Council-funded show and identities get confused, the couple’s lives soon start to descend into chaos.\n\nChris, 22, who has a technical theatre background and works at Sheringham Little Theatre, founded his own company Raising Cain Productions in the first lockdown.\n\nAfter writing the “fascination exploration,” he then also created original music for the production and is the director, technician, and marketing man.\n\nHe said: “I hope to make bold and vibrant theatre more accessible for our rural region.”\n\nTickets for Now My Other Half cost between £10 and £12 and can be purchased by visiting ticketsource.co.uk/headgatetheatre/t-dndpen."
