        "text": "Trading places is a great comedy film staring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd as two men caught in a millionaires game. Two brothers who own one of the biggest investment firms in New York place a bet of $1 to see if the can make a rich man poor and vice-versa. This in process makes rich investment banker Dan Aykroyd homeless and street beggar Eddie Murphy into one of the brother most capable allies due to his \"common touch.\" However when Eddie and Dan discover this ruse they plan to give comeuppance to the bothersome brothers. The films is well written enough that it makes neither character the sole protagonist and later in the film they both go through a tremendous amount of character development and make a great team with the friends they made along the way including a butler and a street worker played by Jamie Lee Curtis. The brothers also make good antagonists with them both representing everything wrong with american capitalism. The two also play of each other giving a great conflict between a obliviously evil man and his greedy brother. Overall this is another recommendation for the holidays , 5 stars. if you have a request feel free to send me a message. see you soon.\n\nPrint this review"
