        "text": "Deuk-pal is committed to his studies and has the utmost respect for his far younger tutor, but his test scores remain stubbornly low.\n\nWhile walking down the street one evening, he witnesses a teenage boy get up onto a bridge and prepare to jump. He implores him not to, but the youth jumps anyway and falls straight into Deuk-pal’s arms as he rushes towards him. Deuk-pal soon sits up in a daze, only to be run over by a car.\n\nDeuk-pal’s loyal underlings attempt to barge into Yi-heon’s room to demand an apology from the boy who survived after their boss saved him. Yi-heon tries to explain who he is, but all they see is a very rude teenager behaving rather strangely.\n\nNaturally, it takes some time for Deuk-pal (as Yi-heon) to acclimatise to his new circumstances. But at least he got his wish: he is going to high school.\n\nHigh School Return of a Gangster is pure formula, existing in a subgenre that combines elements of high school and gangster dramas, comedies and occasionally fantasy.\n\nOne of the progenitors of this genre is My Boss, My Hero, a 2001 film about a promising young gangster who goes incognito to high school to help him acquire the business acumen his bosses think will serve him well. The smash hit spawned two sequels.\n\nMore similar is the surprise 2019 hit The Dude in Me, another story that revolves around a gangster and a high-school student who magically switch bodies after the student falls on the gangster from above.\n\nSince our angle into the story is Deuk-pal, we understand more about him than we do about Yi-heon, who first appears when he climbs onto the bridge. This means Yi-heon’s life and personality are just as much a mystery to us as they are to Deuk-pal when he wakes up.\n\nA few crucial points soon become clear. Yi-heon is born into a rich family and has a poor relationship with his father’s vile secretary, who may soon become his stepmother, while in school he is mercilessly bullied by many of his peers.\n\nYi-heon’s new devil-may-care attitude takes his habitual attackers by surprise, although it takes a little while for Deuk-pal to get used to the boy’s much weaker body.\n\nWhen he sees him again at school, Deuk-pal believes that Se-kyung must have been Yi-heon’s friend, but the truth is more complicated.\n\nAs for Yi-heon, he appears before Deuk-pal in a waking dream. Deuk-pal promises he will try to keep the boy’s grades up and take care of his body until they can figure out how to get out of their predicament. Deuk-pal’s body, however, has already been cremated.\n\nHigh School Return of a Gangster is a simple and for the most part diverting watch that offers the vicarious thrills of seeing a bullying victim suddenly going up against his aggressors. But this lacks the comedy chops of something like The Dude in Me or the force and dynamism of a high-school bullying drama such as Weak Hero Class 1.\n\nThis is partly down to the show’s relatively low budget, which affords the proceedings a stripped-down aesthetic, but also to its lack of imagination. The tropes it wallows in are popular for a reason, but it would be nice if its creators were working as hard to get our attention as its titular gangster is to get his high-school diploma.\n\nHigh School Return of a Gangster is streaming on Viu."
