        "text": "7. Editing Techniques\n\nA simple mistake in the filmmaking process is to be so involved in production that there is little time to work on post-production. Picture, Dialogue, Sound Effects, Foley, Backgrounds and Music will all require editing time. Make sure there is enough time before the due date to make the images and sound flow smoothly. The best filmmaking technique for smooth editing is to have adequate coverage so there is a good selection of shots to choose from. Cutaways and close-ups can often help cover continuity errors. Fades and dissolves can be used effectively to show a passage of time. Some other transitions can be created during production. For example, a well-known hard cut between a bone thrown in the air by a primate to a space station somewhere in our galaxy is in the movie, 2001 A Space Odyssey, 1968. This type of transition takes planning during preproduction in order to have the needed shots in postproduction.\n\nTo avoid that amateur filmmaking soundtrack issue of changing backgrounds between dialogue lines, cleanup the dialogue by using short crossfades between the character’s lines so the background changes are less noticeable. If there is time to remove unwanted production sounds or use alternate takes of lines for poorly recorded dialogue, then do it. Sound Effects are ideal for adding a reality to a scene, but only if they are appropriate. Foley are the footsteps, body sounds and prop handling sounds that enhance the reality. Many lower budget films do not create Foley and the soundtrack is thinner for it. Backgrounds are the environmental sounds that add a sense of location to a scene. These are the basic non-sync sounds like wind, rain, traffic, birds, etc.\n\n8. Use Appropriate Music\n\nSome films make the mistake of using wall-to-wall music from beginning to end. Most films need some breathing room between music cues. Adding music to the entire length of the film could work, but it might sound like a music video. Some scenes do not require music. Use it when it counts. Too much music can dull the effect of the music. Make sure that the chosen music fits the scene, is emotionally appropriate and conveys the emotions of the actors to the audience?\n\nUse music that does not have any singing or voices unless that is called for. Music with singing can compete with the actor’s dialogue. Using popular songs may work for credit sequences and montages, but not usually for score. Also, the filmmaker would need to have the legal rights to use any popular song in their film."
