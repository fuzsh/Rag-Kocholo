        "text": "The stages of film production involve a meticulous progression, starting with pre-production tasks such as script selection, casting, and securing resources. Transitioning into the production phase, the focus shifts to rehearsals, set design, and technical preparations, leading ultimately to the final stage of post-production, where the performance is refined, polished, and presented to the audience, showcasing the culmination of creative efforts and collaborative teamwork.\n\nMastering the 7 Stages of Film Production\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe development period belongs to the project producer, who starts gathering the ideas for the film- rights from books, plays, etc. if needed- until the final draft of the screenplay is completed. During this time, a first synopsis is done, which will help the lead producer sell the idea and raise funds. Often, storyboards and other visual aids will be drafted to accompany the script and help the producer communicate the essence of the film.\n\nFinancing\n\nNetworking and making meetings, often in Los Angeles and, to a lesser extent, New York, is how many producers will meet with possible financiers. Additionally, a lot of producers travel to festivals, both domestic and international, to show the project materials to possible investors.\n\nPre-production\n\nWith enough funding, pre-production can begin, starting with selecting the cast, crew, locations of the shoot, building of sets and props, etc. Shot lists are put together, and the producer starts working on a schedule for the entire shoot, starting broad and getting more specific as production begins to ramp up.\n\nProduction\n\nThe assistant director (AD) shines during production as the footage is filmed by coordinating all the different teams simultaneously. Actors, possibly after days or weeks of rehearsing, finally shoot their scenes as the production crew–grips, lighting, sound, camera, etc. work hard to make every second count and shot look as great as possible. Writers and producers may be on set, but the director is calling all the shots creatively–with their AD making sure they’re sticking to the schedule and getting the footage they need before it’s time to move on.\n\nPost-production\n\nThis is where the editor comes into play, and if the budget is big enough, visual effects teams. In collaboration with the director, editors assemble takes and shots and create a linear film based on hours of footage. For bigger productions, teasers can be done during this time to start marketing. A music composer comes in to orchestrate the score of the movie as the final cut begins to loom. Sound design and color direction are important elements during this time and culminate in picture lock–the film’s final edit.\n\nMarketing\n\nIn the case of a major production company, teasers are already out to promote the film’s release date. In other scenarios, promotional posters, festival screenings, and social media are best to help generate buzz for the film. If the production is small, the creatives involved with the film may have to wear this hat whether they like it or not, though producers can outsource to small marketing companies that do this for a living.\n\nDistribution\n\nTheatrical distribution is typically divided between domestic and international and involves agreements with production companies to pay for the film to screen at physical theatres. Previously, producers would also concentrate their efforts on how the films would be made into physical copies of VHS, DVD, or Blu-Ray and make deals with video rental chains, but nowadays, streaming is king.\n\nWhile smaller filmmakers may try to get on as many platforms as possible–Amazon Video, Hulu, Netflix, etc.–getting an exclusive deal with a single platform may be more lucrative, especially if it comes with promotion on the platform’s end. Hand in hand with marketing, promotion for the film during its release is also key, including press interviews, red carpet premieres, and other launch parties.\n\nProduce Your Own Films and TV Shows At NYFA\n\nNew York Film Academy’s focus is equipping students to produce compelling films and television shows.
