        "text": "Disney Channel regulars Peyton List and Jacob Bertrand have been set to topline The Swap, a body-switching comedy that will be the newest edition to the Disney Channel Original Movie franchise. The comedy is based on the YA book by Megan Shull and production kicked off this week. A fall premiere on the network is being eyed.\n\nThe pic, being directed by Jay Karas from an adaptation by Charlie Shahnaian and Shari Simpson, revolves around a rhythmic gymnast (List) with a pending make-it-or-break-it competition and the youngest son (Bertrand) in a hockey family, who’s vying for a varsity spot on his school team. Their paths unexpectedly cross, and a simple text results in them actually swapping bodies. MarVista Entertainment’s Fernando Szew, Robyn Snyder and Gaylyn Fraiche are executive producers along with Original Pictures’ Kim Todd and Nicholas Hirst, as well as Sean McNamara. Ric Nish is producer.\n\nThe news comes as Disney Channel today unveiled plans for the 100th DCOM Celebration, a summer programming marathon centered on the airing of the network’s 100th original move since 1997 — the first movie was Under Wraps, and the 100th will be a reimagining of the 1987 film Adventures In Babysitting which doesn’t have an airdate yet. Things kick off May 27 with a four-day marathon of the 51 most popular original movies followed by encore presentations of these and every other movie in the franchise through June.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe 100 Disney Channel original movies event will air on Disney Channel, the Disney Channel app and on VOD. The pics will also be available throughout the summer on iTunes, Amazon Instant Video and Google Play.
