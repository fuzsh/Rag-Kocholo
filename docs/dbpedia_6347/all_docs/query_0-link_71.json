        "text": "It's the time of year when you swap serious books for beach reads, and opt for a cool, casual outdoor get-together instead of a fancier dinner party. So maybe it's time to lighten up your watchlist too.\n\nThat means scrapping those dark, depressing dramas and looking for things that are fun, or at least a little bit juicy—bonus points if they include beachy destinations and plenty of eye candy.\n\nNo matter what kind of summer vibe you're hoping to rock this year, there's a summer movie or show to binge watch for you.\n\nP.S. Feel free to bookmark this list for January, when we're all wishing for a little taste of summer.\n\nIf your summer vacation plans are a little meh\n\nIf your summer plans are more about a staycation than summer travel that involves a passport stamp and a long flight, you can at least eat up a little gorgeous summery scenery as you binge watch.\n\nStanley Tucci: Searching for Italy\n\nFollow award-winning actor (and major foodie) on a rambling, Emmy-winning multi-season tour of Italy—no passport required.\n\nWhere to watch: Discovery+\n\nThe Reluctant Traveler With Eugene Levy\n\nThis hilarious new series features comedian and very reluctant traveler Eugene Levy traveling everywhere from the Maldives to Costa Rica to Tokyo to expand his horizons (however uncomfortably).\n\nWhere to watch: Apple+\n\nThe Lost City\n\nThe lush gorgeousness of the Dominican Republic stands in for the hidden jungle paradise in this rom-com adventure story. Sandra Bullock plays a reclusive bestselling author who is kidnapped by a billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) to help him find the Lost City from her novels. Both her cover model (Channing Tatum) and a former CIA operative (Brad Pitt) attempt to rescue her—so there's plenty of eye candy to go around.\n\nWhere to watch: Paramount+\n\nLove and Gelato\n\nIt's a tried-and-true formula: young woman goes on adventurous trip to a gorgeous European capital and has to decide between two dashing young romantic prospects. But this charming movie, based on the novel by Jenna Evans Welch, sets its sights on the incomparably romantic city of Rome. (Just make sure you have a little Italian feast and some gelato stashed in the freezer for your watch party.)\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nMamma Mia\n\nMix together frothy ABBA music, incredible Greek beaches, and Meryl Streep singing and dancing—and you have the recipe for a perfect summer movie night.\n\nWhere to watch: Peacock TV\n\nAnthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown\n\nFollow the late chef and traveler on adventures in some off the beaten path places in this award-winning and beloved travel series.\n\nWhere to watch: Discovery+\n\nIf you're craving real-life summer excitement\n\nNot all documentaries are dark and serious. And these real-life stories will definitely have you thinking summer.\n\nClass Action Park\n\nIf thrill rides are your speed, this bonkers documentary about one of the most legendary—and dangerous—theme parks ever created may be right up your alley.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\nSummer of Soul\n\nThis epic Oscar-winning documentary by musician-filmmaker Ahmir \"Questlove\" Thompson covers the epic six-week festival that went under the radar in 1969, with classic performances by Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Sly & the Family Stone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Mahalia Jackson, B.B. King, The 5th Dimension and many more.\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu and Disney+\n\nIf you want that last day of school vibe\n\nRemember that last day of school, when you have that long stretch of lazy summer ahead of you? Get that feeling back (if only for a couple of hours).\n\nDazed and Confused\n\nThe entire plot of this movie is \"kids in the '70s party after the last day of school.\" Hidden in that description is a whole lot of heart and smarts, and all the drama you'd expect from a group of teenagers running wild (fights, romance, immature pranks, and generous helpings of beer and weed, all set to a killer '70s soundtrack). Shout out to Matthew McConaughey's smarmy performance as that 20-something guy who's still hanging out with high schoolers.\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime\n\nStranger Things\n\nIf you haven't already caught the fourth season, now's the time to indulge your spooky side with the spring-breaking crew from Hawkins, where the adventures get them even closer to solving the mystery of the Upside Down. (Or skip back to Season 3, which offered classic '80s summer vibes alongside the spooky chills.)\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nUnderachiever Lloyd Dobler gets his dream girl (class valedictorian Diane Court) to agree to a single date—and an epic summer romance —in this late '80s teen classic.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\nWet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Later\n\nEven if you never caught the hilarious original sendup of the 1980s summer camp movie, you'll still find a lot of fun in this limited series—including seeing stars like Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks, Adam Scott, and Kristen Wiig sporting some seriously ridiculous early 1990s ensembles.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nIf you want some soapy summer drama\n\nIt's summer! Trade in your dark The Last of Us fandom for something a little less grim.\n\nDaisy Jones and the Six\n\nIf concerts and rock music are your summer vibe, you'll want to catch this series based on the best-selling novel, which follows a Fleetwood Mac-esque band on the road to superstardom.\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime.\n\nOuter Banks\n\nThe third season of this popular Netflix series has the seaside crew looking for an even bigger treasure—with plenty of drama and adventure to enjoy.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nThe White Lotus\n\nTake your pick of incredible beachy destinations—all filled with death and drama in addition to the drop-dead-gorgeous scenery. Opt for season one in Hawaii, or season two in Sicily.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\nDead to Me\n\nThis darkly funny Netflix series is essentially a girl-buddy film—with gorgeous California scenery, a few deaths, and some serious plot twists thrown in.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\nBig Little Lies\n\nDeath visits a group of uber-moms living in grand homes in Monterey—but a lot of the drama comes from affairs, party invitation snubs, and a controversial production of Avenue Q.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\nCruel Summer\n\nIn this twisty she said-she said thriller, it's not quite clear which girl is telling the truth about a kidnapping and its aftermath.\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu\n\nIf summer chills are more your thing\n\nHalloween isn't the only scary time of year—some of the most popular horror movies of all time have a summery vibe.\n\nFriday the 13th\n\nThe original summer camp slasher is definitely worthy of a rewatch—as counselors at Crystal Lake meet some pretty horrifying ends.\n\nWhere to watch: Paramount+ and Pluto TV\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer\n\nTeenagers do the most ridiculous things—like running over someone and dumping the body. This series is a reboot of the equally fun summer horror classic.\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime\n\nScream\n\nGet ready for the soon-to-be-in-theaters latest installment of this slasher series by watching the 2022 reboot with Wednesday favorite Jenna Ortega (or indulge in the beloved original).\n\nWhere to watch: Paramount+\n\nIf you're having a summer movie marathon—or binge watch—with the kids\n\nYou can break out the popcorn over pretty much anything on Disney+, from Pixar flicks and Disney classics to all the Marvel and Star Wars content (including the latest season of the beloved Mandalorian series and the Black Panther sequel Wakanda Forever). But whether you're looking for an under-the-radar Disney option—or more family-friendly summer movies or shows to enjoy—check out these options.\n\nThe Summer I Turned Pretty\n\nBased on the bestselling novel by Jenny Han, this sweet series follows nearly 16-year-old Belly Conklin on a romantic summer at the beach with her family. Think Elin Hilderbrand for the tween and teen set. (And there's a season two on the horizon!)\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime\n\nLuca\n\nThis under-the-radar (but totally charming!) Pixar-created tale follows a young sea monster who secretly lives his best summer life on the Italian Riviera.\n\nWhere to watch: Disney+\n\nJurassic Park\n\nSure, there's a more modern reboot of this dinos-gone-wrong series, but why not start your kids off on the classic series? They still feature some pretty epic effects long before the CGI renaissance.\n\nWhere to watch: Peacock TV\n\nSisterhood of the Traveling Pants\n\nFollow four teen friends on their summer adventures—all linked by a pair of pants they share between them. (And enjoy some early-career performances by Blake Lively, America Ferrara, Alexis Bledel, and Amber Tamblyn.)"
