        "text": "\"You are the person you are, because of the body you have.\" Kino Lorber has revealed the new official US trailer for the indie German low key sci-fi drama titled Skin Deep, from filmmaker Alex Schaad. Not to be confused with the 1989 sex comedy with John Ritter also called Skin Deep. This first premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and won the Queer Lion award, with stops at the Hamburg, Zurich, and Göteborg Film Festivals. At first glance, Leyla and Tristan seem like a happy young couple. When they travel to a remote, mysterious island, a game of identities begins, which changes everything – their perception, their sexuality, their whole \"self.\" Kino Lorber adds: \"Subverting genre and gender as it toggles from body swap thriller to intimate relationship drama, Skin Deep tells a story that transcends bodies, embracing the endless fluid possibilities in the question of what it means to truly love someone.\" Starring Mala Emde and Jonas Dassler, with Maryam Zaree, Dimitrij Schaad, Thomas Wodianka, & Edgar Selge. This will finally open in a few art house theaters in the US this February, after first opening in Europe last year. Check it out.\n\nHere's the official US trailer (+ two posters) for Alex Schaad's Skin Deep, direct from KL's YouTube:"
