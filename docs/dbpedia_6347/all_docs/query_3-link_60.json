        "text": "A serial killer switches bodies with a teenage girl by way of a mystical dagger. That’s the gist of “Freaky,” a horror-comedy hybrid that is much more than another typical teen-slasher flick.\n\nDirector Christopher Landon (“Happy Death Day”) cooks up that high-concept premise with co-writer Michael Kennedy and together they infuse the script with humor, horror and most importantly, a ton of heart. It’s an unexpected breath of fresh air, something I never thought I’d say about a film depicting a table saw splitting the body of the woodshop teacher in half. So, be warned, “Freaky” is not for the squeamish. The “kills” get gory, especially in the film’s prologue when the masked Blissfield Butcher (Vince Vaughn) slaughters four unsuspecting horny teenagers at the home of a rich girl. Guess that urban legend is true after all.\n\n“Freaky” – which opens on Friday the 13th no less – also has its roots firmly planted in comedy and teen coming-of-age drama. Somehow, it all blends into a fun bit of escapism. “Freaky” stars Kathryn Newton as Milie, a shy high schooler who is pretty but plain. She’s teased about her Discount Bonanza clothing by the popular set, so she sticks close to her two BFFs, Nyla (Celeste O’Connor) and Joshua (Misha Osherovich). Her father died a year ago, her mother (Katie Finneran) is needy and her sister (Dana Drori) — a cop, conveniently enough, — is a workaholic. That’s a lot for a kid to juggle.\n\nStranded one night after the homecoming football game, Millie has a run in with the Butcher, who stabs her in the shoulder with the magical knife stolen in the opening scene. At the point of impact, thunder and lightning roil through the sky to signal the switch. Millie escapes. Cut to the next morning. The Butcher as Millie wakes up all dead-eyed in the pink bedroom of a 16-year-old girl curiously taking in the “Pitch Perfect” movie posters and ferociously eating pancakes and bacon. Mom chalks up the strange behavior to “shock.” A few miles across town, Millie as the Butcher is holed up in an abandoned warehouse surrounded by headless mannequins.\n\nBody-swap tropes take over but with a gender-bending twist. Millie as Vaughn is all swinging swagger and terror, now outfitted in a red leather jacket and crimson lipstick. Being Millie is an opportunity to get closer to her victims. At 6-foot-5, Vaughn is all high-pitched “OMG &mldr; you guys!” teenage gestures. Both are terrific in their role reversals. She has a bit about peeing standing up and he does a silly cheer to show Josh and Nyla that he’s really Millie in the Butcher’s body. Yes, you knew that revelation would have to happen in order for the story to move forward. Now, Millie and her gang, including her crush, Booker (Uriah Shelton), have 24 hours to find the Butcher, stab him with the ancient dagger and reverse the switch, or else the swap is permanent.\n\nThe movie is not all blood and guts. There’s some clever social commentary peppered among the many nods to such classics of the genre as “Halloween,” “Friday the 13th” and “Texas Chainsaw Massacre.” Landon and Kennedy’s script is very self-aware, as if winking to the audience. At one point, as Nyla and Joshua are being chased, he screams, “You’re Black! I’m gay! We are so dead!”\n\nWe’re all in on the joke, and it feels so good to laugh.\n\nMovie review\n\nFREAKY\n\n(R for strong bloody horror violence, sexual content, and language throughout.). Cast: Vince Vaughn, Kathryn Newton, Alan Ruck, Katie Finneran, Uriah Shelton, Misha Osherovich, Celeste O'Connor, Dana Drori.
