        "text": "We originally brought this subject up last year when rumors started on the internet indicating that Idris Elba was being considered to succeed Daniel Craig as James Bond after Craig's upcoming 5th, and likely final, film as Agent 007. Though the rumor was shot down, there was a vocal response on social media from people saying that a black man should not play Bond, citing that Bond was written as, and always portrayed as, a white man. Ian Fleming's original literary work seemed to be the go-to defense for anyone who didn't want to see Bond with a darker complexion, but they didn't seem to be taking into account the multitude of other changes the franchise has gone through in the last five decades. And now with the announcement of the live-action Ariel not being played by a white girl, the internet is ablaze with people saying that the character must be white.\n\nYes, there are characters where ethnicity is a defining trait and necessary to the portrayal of the character. Shaft and Black Panther can never really be portrayed by anyone other than a black man. How many times have we seen articles bashing movies for the whitewashing of ethnic characters? But there are plenty of characters where their ethnicity is such a minimal point that they can be race swapped and not fundamentally change the character. Honestly, did you know that Bond is half-Scottish and half-Swiss, or did you just chalk him up to being British? With what the average audience knows about 'The Little Mermaid', is there anything about the character that dictates is MUST be played by a white woman?"
