        "text": "History and Mission\n\nFounded in 1989, JADT is a widely acclaimed peer-reviewed journal publishing thoughtful and innovative work by leading scholars on theatre, drama, and performance in the Americas—past and present. The journal’s provocative articles provide valuable insight and information on the heritage of American theatre, as well as its continuing contribution to world literature and the performing arts. JADT is fully online and freely accessible.\n\nOur aim is to promote research on theatre of the Americas and to encourage historical and theoretical approaches to plays, playwrights, performances, and popular theatre traditions. Studies of dramatic texts from a purely literary perspective are outside the scope of the journal.\n\n​\n\n“I see American Drama and Theatre as a primary means of reflecting the excitement and progress of our language, our culture, our democracy, our social concerns and our historical roots as Americans. No better opportunity exists for understanding, or for contributing to our understanding, of our American world, past or present, than the Journal of American Drama and Theatre, as shown by the excellence of its past performance and the promise of its future.”\n\n– Walter Meserve\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nThe editors of the Journal of American Drama and Theatre (JADT) are now accepting submissions for essays on any topics relating to theatre, drama, and popular entertainments of the Americas for consideration. Please submit completed manuscripts to jadtjournal@gmail.com. We accept submission on a rolling basis. Please email the editors with any inquiries.\n\nArticle manuscripts should be 6,000 to 8,000 words in length and prepared in conformity with the Chicago Manual of Style using footnotes. Completed manuscripts should be submitted as Microsoft Word attachments via e-mail to jadtjournal@gmail.com using Microsoft Word. Articles will be peer reviewed, so please allow 3 to 4 months for a decision. If you are submitting images, please provide the images and captions with your submission. (Please Note: images should be at least 300dpi and authors are responsible for securing permissions prior to submission). Please include a short bio with your submission.\n\n​\n\nPerformance Reviews\n\nJADT now publishes performance reviews on theatre, drama, and performance in the Americas. Single reviews are usually 800 to 1,200 words in length. Please refer to these guidelines when submitting performance reviews. We encourage authors to contact the editors in advance to propose a review at jadtjournal@gmail.com.\n\nBook Reviews\n\nJADT also publishes book reviews. If you would like to propose a book review, please email the Book Review Editor, Maya Roth, at jadtbookreviews@gmail.com."
