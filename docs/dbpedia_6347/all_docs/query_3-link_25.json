        "text": "Bodyswap comedies are a time-honored tradition in Hollywood. From “Freaky Friday” to “13 Going on 30” to so, so many more, the idea of a kid switching bodies with an adult is something studios can’t get enough of. But how do you up the stakes? Well, in “Family Switch,” it’s not just one kid who switches bodies with a parent. Instead, we get both kids switching with both parents. Oh yeah, and the dog and baby switch also.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Lessons In Chemistry’ Review: Brie Larson Anchors Ambitious But Overcrowded Adaptation Of Hit Book\n\nAs seen in the trailer, “Family Switch” is exactly what you think it’s going to be. It’s a bodyswap comedy that begins with a dysfunctional family that is forced to come together after they switch bodies. Kids are adults. Adults are kids. Babies are dogs. This is surely enough fodder for comedy hijinks, right?\n\nThe film stars Jennifer Garner, Ed Helms, Emma Myers, Brady Noon, Bashir Salahuddin, Matthias Schweighöfer, Xosha Roquemore, Ilia Isorelýs Paulino, Paul Scheer, Fortune Feimster, and Rita Moreno. McG is the director of the film, working from a script written by Victoria Strouse and Adam Sztykiel.\n\n“Family Switch” hits Netflix on November 30. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nHere’s the synopsis:\n\nJess and Bill Walker are doing their best to keep their family connected as their children grow older, more independent, and more distant. When a chance encounter with an astrological reader causes the family to wake up to a full body switch, on the morning of the most important day of each of their lives, can the Walkers unite to land a promotion, college interview, record deal and soccer tryout?"
