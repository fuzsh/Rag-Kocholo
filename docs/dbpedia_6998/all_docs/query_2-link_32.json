        "text": "What images are available online from the San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection?\n\nApproximately 45,000 images owned by San Francisco Public Library are available to view and download from the Library’s website. These photos represent the most popular subjects from the San Francisco History Subject Collections. The subjects include streets, buildings, people, earthquakes, fairs, neighborhoods, bridges, parks and more. See San Francisco History Center Subject Collections for a complete list of subject headings. Images from our collection are continually being added to the Web site.\n\nWhile the San Francisco History Subject Collections is the primary focus of the digitizing effort, some materials from our other photo collections have also been scanned and are available online. New collections are added to this section as they are scanned.\n\nWhat images are NOT online from the San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection?\n\nThe Library has focused on putting popular images of San Francisco scenes and personalities in its photo database. We have not started digitizing our California photos that feature images from counties outside San Francisco.\n\nIn addition, the Library owns the photo morgue of the San Francisco News-Call Bulletin, a daily newspaper that covered the time period from the 1920s to 1965. Much of the San Francisco History Collection comes from the News-Call Bulletin morgue. However, the morgue also includes national and international subjects that have not been digitized or cataloged. Also, other photographic collections, including significant ones from city departments, such as the Department of Public Works and the San Francisco Assessor’s Office, are partially available online. See the List of Photo Collections for more information about these collections.\n\nFinally, the Library also owns many other forms of visual material including postcards, lantern slides, glass plate negatives, panoramic photographs, cabinet cards, and stereographs.\n\nAny of the visual materials that are not available online can be requested during the Photograph Collection's open hours.\n\nHow do I browse the online Photo Collection?\n\nAnyone can browse the online photo database from a computer with Internet access. Start your search on the San Francisco Digital Collections page. There are both browsing and keyword options for searching on this page.\n\nI am looking for photos of my building?\n\nPlease use our online guide How to Find Photographs of a San Francisco Building. Begin your search with the San Francisco Digital Collections. Then use the guide to explore what has not been digitized. Visit the San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection in person to view the non-digitized visual materials.\n\nI’m having problems accessing the Class Image Database: San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection. What's wrong?\n\nWe recommend using our San Francisco Digital Collections.\n\nTo access the Class Image Database, if your computer or computer network is behind a firewall (security software), then it may be blocking access to the San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection.\n\nPlease ask your network administrator to allow access to 82 (San Francisco Historical Photograph Collection).\n\nThe database is currently not available using the Safari browser. Please use Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox browsers to access the image database.\n\nHow can I view photos that are not online?\n\nThe staff at the Photo Desk of the San Francisco History Center, located on the sixth floor at the Main Library, is available for assistance with the photograph collection. The Photo Desk hours are Tuesdays and Thursdays 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturdays 10 a.m. to noon, 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nCan I print or download images from the online database?\n\nYes. You are welcome to print or download the jpeg images in the online database for personal, educational, or scholarly use for free.\n\nCan I get copies of the photos that are not online or any photo in the Library?\n\nThere are a number of options available to make reproductions of the images in the collection. See Order Images for more information. However, photocopying the photos is not possible. Check with the Photo Desk staff about using a camera for a photo shoot while at the Library.\n\nWhat if I need commercial quality images?\n\nHigher resolution scans are available for purchase as TIFF files (see Order Scans), as are photographic reproductions. See Order Images for more information.\n\nAre there any other costs?\n\nIf you plan to publish or exhibit photographic images obtained from the Library, there is a commercial use fee of $15 per image per use. See Permissions for more information.\n\nI want to hang large photographs on the wall of my business. How would I go about ordering prints of photos from the Library?\n\nPrints can also be made from scans ordered from the Library. You can enlarge the scans to the desired size and print them yourself or have it done professionally.\n\nCommercial fees will apply.\n\nI have a tight deadline. What’s the quickest way to get reproductions sent to me?\n\nRush orders are available at an additional charge; double the scan fee. We deliver images using the Library's Hightail account.\n\nHow do I pay for my purchase?\n\nPayment is made by a check, money order, cash, wired funds or credit card. At this time the credit card payment option is in-person only at the Main Library.\n\nCan I order online?\n\nNo. Payment must accompany the order.\n\nWhere does the Library get its photos?\n\nMost of the photos and other forms of visual materials have been donated to the Library by individuals, companies or government agencies.\n\nMy question has not been answered here. I would like to talk to someone on the Library staff."
