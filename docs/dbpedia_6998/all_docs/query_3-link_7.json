        "text": "Open Access Policy for Images of Works of Art Presumed in the Public Domain\n\nWith the launch of NGA Images, the National Gallery of Art implemented an open access policy for digital images of works of art that the National Gallery believes to be in the public domain. Images of these works are available free of charge for any use, commercial or non-commercial, under Creative Commons Zero (CC0). Users do not need to contact the National Gallery for authorization to use these images. They are available for download on nga.gov object pages. See Policy Details below for specific instructions and notes for users.\n\nBackground\n\nThe National Gallery of Art serves the nation by welcoming all people to explore and experience art, creativity, and our shared humanity. In pursuing this mission, we make collection images and information available to scholars, educators, and the general public to support research, teaching, and personal enrichment; to promote interdisciplinary research; and to nurture an appreciation of all that inspires great works of art.\n\nOur open access policy is a natural extension of this mission, and in applying the policy in a global digital environment, we also expand and enhance our educational and scholarly outreach. We believe that increased access to high quality images of its works of art fuels knowledge, scholarship, and innovation, inspiring uses that continually transform the way we see and understand the world of art.\n\nWorks in the public domain are those not protected by copyright. We have launched this open access policy with digital images of works of art that we believe to be in the public domain.\n\nPolicy Details\n\nUsers may download and reproduce—free of charge and without seeking authorization from the National Gallery—any digital image of a work in our collection that the we believe is in the public domain.
