It puts you right on the edge… and that’s where PhotoShelter comes in — to help us get that message out. ”\n\nChief Photographer, Jackson State University\n\n“PhotoShelter is our bread and butter. It’s what keeps us in business. It’s my lifeline to my people, my services here, my job. It’s how I push content out and show my results. It’s how we transfer our assets to our 5,000+ people.”\n\nAssistant Director of Visuals and Multimedia, Texas A&M Agrilife\n\n“Before we used PhotoShelter, we had images on individual drives, and so if we couldn’t find a photo on our computer, then we had to go track down the other person in our office and see if they had it. We were asking two or three different people if they had that image – it took their time to go and search and try to find it.”\n\nAssistant Director of College Relations, Central Oregon Community College\n\n“One of the biggest benefits of [PhotoShelter] is we’re able to create large galleries of images that people can pull from on their own. The more time that we can spend creating stories instead of working on edits or transferring files to people, the more stories we can tell.”\n\nArt/Creative Director, University of Florida\n\n“The fact that we can completely lock down our site (only we know who’s coming, who’s going), grant access for certain things, and most importantly prevent the outside world from seeing a lot of our assets is crucial because we’re in the healthcare industry. I know I can sleep better at night knowing that those tools are in place.”\n\nProduction Manager, University of Maryland Medical System"
