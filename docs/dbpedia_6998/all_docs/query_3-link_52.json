Multon is an Associate Professor of Latin American History at Stephen F. Austin State University. His research, supported by various institutions, focuses on transnational networks across the Western Hemisphere. He has published award-winning articles in Cold War History, The Americas, and the Journal of Latin American Studies. His recent project, Caribbean Blood Pacts: The Guatemalan Revolution and the Caribbean Basin's Cold War, examines how Guatemalan reactionaries, Caribbean Basin dictators, a transnational corporation, and British intelligence influenced the U.S. government’s actions that led to the collapse of Guatemalan democracy in the early 1950s. Moulton has previously received a Wallis Annenberg Research Grant from the University of Southern California Libraries and a Scholar Research Support Fellowship from Stanford University's Hoover Institution. He will soon be a Visiting Scholar at the Center for Right-Wing Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Mayers Fellow at The Huntington Library.\n\nVirtual, on Zoom\n\nJanuary’s lecture features Cecily Evonuk (they/them/theirs), 2024 Tee A. Corrine Memorial Travel Fellow. Evonuk is a dedicated third-year undergraduate student at Oregon State University where they are currently pursuing a double major in history and women, gender, and sexuality studies, with a studio art minor. Evonuk's focus centers on American history, with an emphasis on civil rights, human rights, and the LGBTQ+ liberation movement. Their passion for historical research and commitment to social justice issues has led them to set aspirations to continue their academic journey beyond the undergraduate level. Post-graduation, they plan to pursue a master’s program in History and subsequently pursue a PhD. Evonuk's academic achievements have earned them several prestigious awards and fellowships, including the Emil H. Pubols Award in American History, the Drucilla Shepard Smith Award, the Finley Academic Excellence Scholarship, the Dr. Arthur E. Gravatt History Scholarship, and the Thomas and Margaret Meehan History Award.\n\nVirtual, on Zoom"
