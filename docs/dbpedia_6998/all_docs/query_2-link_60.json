They can pull something down within a couple of minutes, versus probably hours or days.”\n\nStaff Photographer, Hartford Healthcare\n\n“Partnering with PhotoShelter has given our team a reliable one-stop-shop to house critical game-time action. By leveraging PhotoShelter’s AI functionality, alongside Socialie’s automation and analytics capabilities, we’re able to streamline the process of tagging the right players and get the content into their hands in seconds, taking the knock-on effect of social media and fan engagement to the next level.”\n\nSenior Manager of Digital Assets, Philadelphia Eagles\n\n“By using PhotoShelter, our local content contributors can submit their assets to our digital team at a moment’s notice. This workflow has led to more diverse, creative, and engaging content across our various publishing channels.”\n\nDigital Content Manager, Visit Bend\n\n“Ever since we have really followed this process with the social team, our numbers month over month have increased. Engagement rates, reach, click-through rates. We are seeing a direct correlation. Particularly through social numbers.”\n\nDirector of Marketing, Garden of the Gods Resort and Club\n\n“PhotoShelter is our bread and butter. It’s what keeps us in business. It’s my lifeline to my people, my services here, my job. It’s how I push content out and show my results. It’s how we transfer our assets to our 5,000+ people.”\n\nAssistant Director of Visuals and Multimedia, Texas A&M Agrilife\n\n“Working with PhotoShelter has been vital to our success, and I’ve been a strong advocate for the platform since bringing it to FreshDirect. Moving through this amount of creative work without it at this pace would simply not be possible.”\n\nDirector of Creative, FreshDirect\n\n“PhotoShelter is invaluable to us. Every team is able to access it, search so easily, and find what they need, and we are all benefiting from that.”\n\nMedia Specialist/Archivist, National Aquarium\n\n“Making the process agile for us isn’t about [the fact that] it saves time, it saves money. We can also save lives by getting things out more quickly and PhotoShelter is very intuitive.”\n\nSenior Communications Manager, Food for the Hungry\n\n“Before [PhotoShelter], it would have taken literally clicking through every photo and searching through thumbnails to get [stakeholders] what they need in a reasonable time.”\n\nCommunications Manager, Municipal Association of South Carolina\n\n“We often get specific requests from players. They’ll ask us for photos of their outfits when they get off the bus, etc. We want them to be active on social media so if they’re asking us for something, we’re going to do everything we can to get it to them. We also get constant requests from other groups for specific photos, so we have a weekly shot list that we aim to get to.”\n\nBen Liebenberg, NFL Director of Photography"
