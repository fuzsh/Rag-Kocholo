        "text": "Identifying Photographs\n\nPhotographs can be made using an assortment of materials and a variety of photographic processes. Proper identification of the photographâs materials (support, binder, image material, coatings, etc.) and the process of its production is essential for informing appropriate storage and handling recommendations. The information on this page covers photographic materials from all eras of photography including photographic prints and negatives, but not digital image files. The following are useful references for identifying photographic materials and processes:\n\nImage Permanence Institute, Graphics Atlas\n\nNortheast Document Conservation Center, Types of Photographs\n\nVictoria and Albert Museum, Photographic Processes\n\nJÃ¼rgens, Martin C. The Digital Print: Identification and Preservation. Los Angeles: The Getty Conservation Institute, 2009.\n\nLavÃ©drine, Bertrand. Photographs of the Past: Process and Preservation. Los Angeles: The Getty Conservation Institute, 2009.\n\nPÃ©nichon, Sylvie. Twentieth-Century Color Photographs: Identification and Care. Los Angeles: The Getty Conservation Institute, 2013.\n\nReilly, James M. Care and Identification of 19th Century Photographs. Rochester: Eastman Kodak Company. 1986.\n\nCare and Handling of Photographs\n\nTaking care when handling any collection item is one of the more effective, cost-efficient, and easily achieved preservation measures.\n\nHandle photographs with clean hands or while wearing clean nitrile gloves. Consider wearing gloves when handling metal, glass, and plastic materials such as negatives, daguerreotypes and tintypes. Recognize that gloves can limit dexterity and become soiled.\n\nAvoid touching the image area of a photograph. Whenever possible handle the photograph by its edges or its housing materials.\n\nHave a clean, dry, organized work area free of food and drink.\n\nWhenever possible, avoid marking photographs. If absolutely necessary, limit markings and write on the back and near the edge with a soft graphite pencil. It is preferable to mark the photographâs housing materials.\n\nDo not use paper clips, rubber bands, or other mechanical fasteners to mark or organize prints.\n\nDo not use self-adhesive tape, sticky notes, glue, or other adhesives on photographs.\n\nBe cautious when removing dust from the surface of a photograph. Even soft brushes can scratch or otherwise damage photographs. Use a blower, such as an air bulb, (not canned air) to remove loose dust and debris.\n\nUse care and patience when moving collections, especially glass and heavy, large, or awkward works.\n\nStorage of Photographs\n\nA good storage environment is arguably the most important preservation measure for photographic materials.\n\nA relatively dry* (30-50% relative humidity (RH)), cool** (70Â°F or below), and stable environment is best. Avoid storage in attics; basements; in close proximity to vents, fireplaces and radiators; along exterior walls; or other locations with high risk for condensation, water leaks, and extreme environmental fluctuations.\n\nLimit light exposure.\n\nMinimize exposure to atmospheric pollutants. Ideally, the storage space should be well-ventilated with filtered air.\n\n* Relative humidity is the single most important factor in preserving most photographic prints. Ideally, RH fluctuations should be less than 5% within a 24 hour period.\n\n**For color photographs and film negatives, temperature is the controlling factor affecting stability. Storage at low temperatures (40Â°F or below) is recommended. For more information on cold storage see National Park Service.\n\nHousing of Photographs\n\nPhotographs should be housed within protective primary enclosures, such as folders or sleeves, to protect them from dust, light, and handling. Suitable enclosures for photographs are made of plastic or paper that meet certain specifications. To be considered photo-safe, storage materials must pass the physical and chemical requirements outlined in ISO 18902 including passing the Photographic Activity Test (PAT). This information is often noted by suppliers. Materials that do not meet these specifications can cause damage such as fading, yellowing, silver mirroring, and embrittlement.\n\nPaper enclosures must be photo-safe and free of colorants that bleed. Paper stocks are available in both alkaline buffered (pH 8.5) and unbuffered (neutral, pH 7) options. Buffered paper enclosures are recommended for brittle prints that have been mounted onto poor quality secondary supports and for deteriorated film-base negatives. Buffered enclosures are not recommended for dye transfer prints, cyanotypes or some architectural reproductions. Paper enclosures minimize unnecessary light exposure; are porous; easy to label with pencil; and are relatively inexpensive. However, the opacity of the enclosure may require removal for viewing of the item.\n\nSuitable plastic enclosures are made of uncoated polyester, polyethylene, and polypropylene. Photographic emulsions may stick to plastic enclosures if they are exposed to high RH, especially above 70% RH, so they should not be used in uncontrolled storage environments. Plastic enclosures should not be used for nitrate or acetate-based negatives. A benefit of plastic enclosures is that they can minimize handling of frequently viewed materials by allowing for viewing of the item without removal from its housing.\n\nPrints can be matted with acid-free rag or museum board for protection. Whenever possible, adhesives should not be used directly on the print. Matting should be done by an experienced framer or conservator who follows preservation guidelines for matting and framing.\n\nStore all photographs (whether matted or enclosed in paper or plastic) in photo-safe boxes. Boxes can accommodate materials in either a horizontal or vertical storage orientation. Horizontal storage is preferable for prints on brittle mounts and oversize photographs. Vertical storage is best to prevent breakage of glass materials.\n\nIf possible, keep negatives separate from print materials. Some negatives can produce harmful gases as they age. For more information about storage of negatives, see Motion Picture Film\n\nStorage of family photographs in albums is often desirable and many commercially available albums use photo-safe materials. Avoid albums with colored, \"magnetic,\" or sticky self-adhesive pages.\n\nConservation Treatment\n\nFor condition problems that are insufficiently resolved by improving housing, conservation treatment by a photograph conservator may be necessary. The national professional association for conservators, the American Institute for Conservation (AIC), maintains an online directory for finding a conservator by specialty and geographic location and provides information on how to choose a conservator.\n\nReferences and Selected Further Reading:\n\nCanadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes: Photographs\n\nImage Permanence Institute (IPI) Storage Guides: Storage Guide for Color Photographic Materials and IPI Guide to Preservation of Digitally-Printed Photographs\n\nImage Permanence Institute (IPI) Photo-storage, Display, & Labeling Materials - A Guide to ISO 18902 âPhoto-safeâ Testing\n\nInternational Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Strategic Programme on Preservation and Conservation, Care, Handling, and Storage of Photographs: Information Leaflet, [InformaciÃ³n en español], Standards, Bibliography\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) 18902:2013 Imaging materials â Processed imaging materials â Albums, framing and storage materials.\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) 18916:2007 Imaging materials â Processed imaging materials â Photographic activity test for enclosure materials.\n\nLavÃ©drine, Bertrand.
