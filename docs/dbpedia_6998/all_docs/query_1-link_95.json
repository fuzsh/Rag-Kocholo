CalRecycle has developed a PowerPoint with talking points and a short, 3-minute video that jurisdiction staff can use to educate local decision makers on the primary elements of the law. The PowerPoint is customizable so that local jurisdictions can tailor presentations to their audience.\n\nNew Elected Officials web page available now.\n\nModel Signage\n\nIn communities where a substantial number of residents speak non-English languages, jurisdictions are required to translate education and outreach materials to ensure all residents and businesses can effectively participate in organics collection services.\n\nCalRecycle has developed model recycling signage in the following languages:\n\nEnglish\n\nSpanish\n\nMandarin\n\nPunjabi\n\nArmenian\n\nJapanese\n\nVietnamese\n\nKorean\n\nRussian\n\nCalRecycle will continue to publish resources to this page to provide jurisdictions with education and outreach tools.\n\nThese guidance tools were developed by CalRecycle as a courtesy for informational and example purposes only.
