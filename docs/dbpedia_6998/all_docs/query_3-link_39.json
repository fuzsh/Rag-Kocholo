        "text": "Copyright Questions\n\nThe vast majority of Houghton material is either in the public domain or under copyrights not controlled by Houghton Library.\n\nHoughton Library does not require that researchers request permission to quote from or publish images of most collection material (a few exceptions are listed below), nor does it charge permission or use fees. Permission, however, may be needed from other copyright holders or executors.\n\nWhen to Contact Us\n\nPlease notify the library if you plan to publish facsimile editions of Houghton materials, and for articles, editorial projects, biographical and critical works that incorporate a substantial portion of a manuscript and/or collection. The library may wish to receive a copy of such works for its records.\n\nResearchers must notify the library when publishing images of or quoting from the collections listed below. The list includes the major collections for which these conditions apply, but it’s not exhaustive. Please email the library with any questions.\n\nAmerican Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM)\n\nAmerican Repertory Theatre\n\nThomas Bouchard\n\nEmily Dickinson\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson\n\nBernie Gardella\n\nJoseph Clark Grew\n\nIranian Oral History Project\n\nSally Jacobs\n\nAlix Jeffry\n\nFrederick Kiesler\n\nJohn Lindquist\n\nAmy Lowell\n\nAngus McBean\n\nL.E. Sissman\n\nAndrei Sakharov Archives\n\nArks Smith\n\nTobi Tobias\n\nThomas Wolfe*\n\n*There can be no reproduction or publication of material in these collections without advance permission from the copyright holder.\n\nAny requests to write up or publish T. S. Eliot’s material must be cleared through Faber’s Permissions Department.\n\nFor material protected by copyright, certain uses (including but not limited to quoting, publishing, performing, and reproducing) may require permission from the copyright holder. When required, it’s the researcher’s responsibility to obtain such permissions.\n\nThe following resources may be helpful in this regard:\n\nCopyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States, published by the Cornell University Copyright Information Center, can help researchers to determine if a work is in the public domain.\n\nHarvard University's Office of Scholarly Communications Fair Use Guide explains fair use and gives advice on determining if your use of a copyrighted item falls under the fair use statue.\n\nSeveral online resources can be useful in finding the current copyright holder of a work, and requesting licensing permission:\n\nThe WATCH File (Writers, Artists, and Their Copyright Holders) maintained by the Harry Ransom Center and the University of Reading is a database of copyright contacts for writers, artists, and prominent figures in other creative fields.\n\nArtists Rights Society is a copyright, licensing and monitoring organization for visual artists in the United States.\n\nDACS is a visual artists’ rights management organization in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe ADAGP is a French collective which monitors copyright in the visual arts.\n\nASCAP and BMI are performing rights organizations which license and collect royalties for musical works.\n\nCitations\n\nHoughton Library asks that researchers cite all material referenced, quoted, or reproduced with the following citation format:\n\n[Call number]. Houghton Library, Harvard University.\n\nFor example, a photograph reproduced from the Henry James papers would be cited as: MS Am 1094 (2245). Houghton Library, Harvard University.\n\nLecture Series\n\nEach year Houghton Library invites distinguished scholars to deliver four lectures in honor of George Parker Winship, and Philip and Frances Hofer. The lectures are free and open to the public.\n\nJoin our mailing list for updates on Winship, Hofer and other public programs happening at Houghton.\n\nPhilip and Frances Hofer Lectures on the Art of the Book\n\nThe Philip and Frances Hofer Lecture Series was established in 1968 for the purpose of sponsoring “lectures on subjects of special interest to Harvard students and scholars within the range of the Printing and Graphic Arts field.”\n\nPhilip Hofer — Harvard College class of 1921 and founding curator of Houghton's Department of Printing and Graphic Arts — endowed the lecture fund in his name and that of his wife on the occasion of his retirement from Houghton Library.\n\nIn addition to the Hofer Lecture Series, Houghton Library in conjunction with the Harvard Art Museum awards an annual Philip Hofer Prize for Collecting Books or Art.\n\nGeorge Parker Winship Lectures on Bibliography\n\nThe Winship Lectures were established in 1968 by a gift from the John Barnard Associates, a society of Harvard book-lovers founded in 1927 by Winship. For further information on Winship and the history of the lecture series, see:\n\nGeorge Parker Winship as Librarian, Typophile and Teacher, edited by Roger Stoddard. Cambridge [Mass.]: The Harvard College Library, 1999.\n\n\"The George Parker Winship Lecture Series at Houghton Library: A Bibliographer’s Creed\", by G. Thomas Tanselle. Harvard Library Bulletin.Spring 2014, Volume 25, Number 1.\n\nMedia and Recording Requests\n\nHoughton Library is committed to supporting and promoting research, teaching, and learning, while at the same time preserving our rare and unique collections.\n\nHoughton Library is not available as a background setting for non-educational, non-collection-related projects or promotions.\n\nFilming and recording on-site at Houghton Library may be accommodated when:\n\nA Harvard faculty member requests filming as part of their teaching program;\n\nThe University or Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) Administration requests filming to promote education and/or teaching with the Harvard collections; or\n\nA request from outside Harvard is for an educational project in which Houghton Library collections are integral.\n\nAll filming, recording or media requests should be made at least two weeks in advance. Submit your request through the Harvard Library Communications Media Request Form."
