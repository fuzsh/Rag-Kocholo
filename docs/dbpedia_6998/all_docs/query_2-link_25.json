Are you overwhelmed by the different cloud services, and how to get your Apple Photo Library in order? if you're like most of us, you feel overwhelmed by your digital photo collection. And it's not your fault.\n\nApple Photos and other cloud services are designed to make it easier for us to store and manage our digital photos, allowing us to access and share our memories from anywhere with an internet connection. Yay! However, as these technologies become more advanced, they can also become overwhelming, and you probably do not know how to use them to their full potential.\n\nYou might want help with creating digital and physical albums, or with how to back up your photos to the cloud, and which backup cloud service you should use. You might need help consolidating your images from old devices, like old computers, phones, cameras, CDs, DVDs, thumb drives, etc.\n\nWhile Apple Photos, iCloud, Google Photos, Dropbox and other cloud services offer many benefits for managing our digital lives, they can also be overwhelming to navigate without proper training and understanding. And as we accumulate more digital content, it can become increasingly difficult to manage and organize everything.\n\nAs Certified Photo Managers (yes, that's a thing!), we can help you create a well-organized, secure and curated photo library (as well as finally make those albums you've been planning to get to) that can be easily shared with your children as a legacy. We can also help advise you on how to get organized.\n\nThe curated photo library can showcase the most meaningful moments and milestones of your family's journey and ensure that your family's memories are preserved and celebrated for years to come.\n\nIf you'd like our favorite tips on how you can get started organizing your photos, click below."
