Always re-frame your shots as needed to protect the privacy of others.\n\nMinimize disruptions to library patrons as much as possible.\n\nRemind your photographer that this is a library and not a studio, so he/she must direct your shots quietly.\n\nBe respectful of patrons who are studying.\n\nChoose less populated locations for shooting.\n\nMinimize the use of flash as much as possible when patrons are present.\n\nDo not use any liquids/sprays, glitter, confetti, or other props in your photos that could either damage library materials or leave a mess behind when you are finished shooting.\n\nAny props you bring with you for the shoot must be taken with you when you leave (balloons, cap and gown, etc.). Never leave your props unattended.\n\nThere is no portrait photography allowed in the Costo Reading Room or in the Special Collections Reading Room.\n\nLet the library Circulation / Reserves (front) desk staff know when you have finished taking photos and are leaving.\n\nIf you post your photos on social media, please tag us @ucrlibrary and use the hashtag #ucrlibrary\n\nIf approved, we will get back to you within two business days and let library staff know that your group has permission to take portraits on property."
