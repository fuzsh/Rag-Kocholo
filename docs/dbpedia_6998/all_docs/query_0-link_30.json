        "text": "In 2001, during my freshman year as an architecture student, the primary school in my small town decided to dismantle its old darkroom to make space for the janitor’s workshop. All the rusted gear faced disposal, as it did in many similar cases. Learning about this, I approached the headmaster.\n\n“What if you let me keep this junk?” I proposed.\n\n“Well, you can have it, but in return, please conduct a workshop or two for our kids. There is still value in showing them how things were done in the past,” she replied.\n\nAnd so began my journey as a mentor for photography. Over the next twelve years, what started as a workshop or two evolved into a regular extracurricular class with weekly sessions, excursions, exhibitions, and more. This isn’t just my story; it’s about a box left behind in that junk by my predecessor, Mr. Vojko Čeligoj, a teacher who once mentored me as well. The box held negatives shot by school children and himself."
