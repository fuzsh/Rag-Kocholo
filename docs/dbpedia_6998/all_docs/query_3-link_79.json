        "text": "The New Mexico Public Media (NMPM) Digitization Project is an innovative statewide collaboration that will digitize, preserve and provide access via the American Archive of Public Broadcasting the collections of leading public media stations in New Mexico, including New Mexico PBS, KUNM-FM, KENW, KANW-FM, and KRWG. NMPM stations have created substantive, original programming representing diverse communities that are underrepresented, under-resourced and oftentimes marginalized. In particular, New Mexico has large Indigenous (11.4%) and Hispanic (47%) communities. This project will take place over 24 months.\n\nThe collection currently resides on obsolete and deteriorating video and audio formats of 1”, ¾” beta, ¼” and cassette audio tape. This project includes original programming from 1970 to 2018 that provides a e chronicle of New Mexico’s political, social, cultural and artistic life.\n\nThe Library of Congress will preserve digital copies, and the collection will be made available on the AAPB website at http://americanarchive.org.\n\nThis three-year project, hosted at Indiana University Bloomington, will digitize and create item-level metadata for 78 codices and 406 medieval manuscript fragments from twenty-two primarily non-R1 Midwestern institutions. Participating institutions are a newly organized consortium extending across eight states. The Indiana University Libraries will scan or photograph holdings, and researchers at IU Bloomington, Loyola University Chicago, and Saint Mary’s College will create metadata for these objects, including many items unrecorded in previous bibliographical surveys. Resulting item descriptions and high-resolution, IIIF-compliant images will be made freely available through Pages Online at Indiana University. This project focuses on small collections that have not been economically feasible for holding institutions to digitize on their own and thus will bring a wealth of previously inaccessible and uncatalogued material to scholarly consciousness. This new material will be aggregated with existing digitized collections to yield a more comprehensive understanding of North American manuscript holdings.\n\nProposed here is a one year project to create a publicly assessable digital resource for the Esther Funk Collection, including her hand-crafted books and the Central- and South American textiles she collected in the 1930s. Funk’s work and textile collection document an indigenous industry on the cusp of the tourism industry. Her collection provides insights into this period of transition, when traditional craftsmanship shifts from community focus to commercial venue, when plant dyes are replaced by synthetic, when traditional symbols shift to market demands. Funk’s collection was gathered under the guidance of her mentor, the archaeologist Edgar Lee Hewett, who believed ancient cultures must be studied in relation to contemporary cultures. This was her contribution to Hewett’s on-going effort to document the past. For us, it is a reminder of that cultural constant of change; Funk’s collection is a temporal snapshot of the past from a now fully transformed industry.\n\nIn two years, the University of South Carolina (USC) Libraries’ Digital Collections will scan 36 boxes of material from USC’s South Caroliniana Library’s records of the South Carolina Council on Human Relations (SCCHR). Adding these materials to the existing digital collections at the university and in the state will create a comprehensive site of primary sources that deepens the understanding of the early efforts and leading role of African Americans in South Carolina in the nation’s struggle toward civil rights. This site will allow for new kinds of scholarship and more comprehensive understanding of South Carolina’s place in the national civil rights movement from the 1930s through the 1970s.\n\nThe Virginia Tech Insect Collection is the oldest and largest entomological collection in Virginia, and an important repository of Appalachia’s natural heritage. This two-year project will digitize, describe, and provide access to 15,000 pinned insect specimens through high resolution photos and 400 high resolution 3D models. Since just 3% of the collection’s 500,000 specimens are digitized, the majority of specimens are only accessible on-site. Upon completion of the proposed project, this will be the world’s largest digital 3D insect collection, available through multiple online repositories, facilitating wide use. Online insect collections typically only have illustrations and photographs, but our 3D models will allow users to virtually manipulate specimens, zoom in and out, and inspect anatomy in ways that are impossible with physical specimens or still images. This project enables global access to new educational experiences with ecologically and economically important insects, and threatened and endangered species.\n\nThe Kansas Public Media Preservation Project will include the digitization, preservation, and public access of 2,269 hours of historic public television and radio programming created by a consortium of Kansas stations including KMUW-FM, KHCC-FM, High Plains Public Radio-FM, KPR-FM, KRPS-FM, Vietnamese Public Radio, and KPTS-TV. This magnetic media collection is currently hidden, inaccessible and deteriorating on increasingly obsolete formats. Stations will contribute digital copies to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting (AAPB), a collaboration between the Library of Congress and WGBH. The AAPB currently lacks content from the state of Kansas, and this project ensures the preservation and access of Kansas’ public media legacy, which has richly documented many people, places, events, and perspectives over the past 60+ years. The Library of Congress will preserve the collection for posterity and WGBH will make it available on the AAPB website with accompanying metadata and transcripts.\n\nThis project will provide public access to collections highlighting the history and experiences of African-American and Jewish communities in and near Houston, which in turn shed light on nationally significant issues including politics, art, race, and religion. These communities are underrepresented in archival repositories across the nation, and particularly in publicly accessible digital repositories. The institution carrying out the project is Woodson Research Center, at Rice University’s Fondren Library. Original materials in formats such as photographs, correspondence, reports, synagogue and church bulletins, sermon recordings, and more will be digitized, described, and made available online via the UNT Portal to Texas History and Rice’s repository at scholarship.rice.edu. This project will span two years and will transform scholarship by enabling researchers and community members to engage with thousands of previously inaccessible archival records about the history of two ethnic communities in America’s fourth-largest city, and one of its most diverse.\n\nThe Ransom Center proposes a twenty-month project to digitize the papers of British author Radclyffe Hall and partner, artist Una Vincenzo, Lady Troubridge. Drafts of Hall’s controversial 1928 novel The Well of Loneliness – considered a landmark work in lesbian literature – are accompanied by Hall’s notebooks, additional manuscripts, correspondence, contracts, photographs, and scrapbooks, plus 131 diaries kept by Troubridge from 1930 to 1951 and other items. The Center plans to digitize 38,500 images and make them available as an online archive on multiple platforms, including DPLA; enable FancyBox viewing of the images within the finding aid; utilize IIIF and Mirador viewer to allow sharing, side-by-side comparison of drafts, and annotations; and further foster knowledge with an online teaching collection for educators. The project will provide worldwide access and broad outreach initiatives for scholars, educators, students, and interested communities to a LGBTQIA+ resource remarkable for its significance and comprehensiveness.\n\nOver a 12-month period, the Indiana Historical Society (IHS) will digitize and catalog 40,000 items of correspondence, business records, photographs, and artifacts in the Madam C.J. Walker Collection (Walker Collection) and Madam C.J. Walker Supplemental Collection (Walker Supplemental Collection). Once a single collection, it was divided by previous owners with no regard to preserving content. One half was deposited with the IHS, and the other was later purchased. Once reunited, they will comprise a comprehensive collection on nationally renowned African American entrepreneur Madam C.J. Walker. Until then, their divided state leaves gaps and makes materials difficult to discover. Despite this challenge, the processed and minimally digitized Walker Collection half is consistently the IHS’s most requested, and its online guide is the most accessed. Digitization of both halves will allow for merging and organization of content; increase meaningful dissemination online; and preserve their content for future generations.\n\nHistoric buildings and landscapes cannot always be saved. The last resort in the face of demolition is to record these buildings in photographs and measured architectural drawings, preserving them at least on paper and film. Since the 1980s the Center for Historic Architecture and Design (CHAD) has been documenting historic structures that were threatened by development. This project proposes to digitize CHAD’s collection of architectural documentation of about 5,000 properties in the Mid-Atlantic. An estimated three-quarters of these resources are now demolished, and the CHAD collection is the only record of the now vanished historic landscape. Our collection, which includes measured drawings and photographs, is the largest repository of architectural documentation of vernacular buildings in the Mid-Atlantic. Almost the entirety of the collection is not digitized. The digitization of our collection aims to make our resources widely available through the University of Delaware’s Institutional Repository (UDSpace), an open access repository.\n\nFor nine years the American Folklore Society has worked with a community of 24 important but under-resourced repositories in our field to increase access to their collections, unique and rich in scope and content but “hidden” by CLIR’s definition. This has led to our development of the online Folklore Collections Database (FCD; folklorecollections.org), which now provides metadata about more than 400 of these repositories’ collections. We are requesting support: 1) to digitize a sample of collections from our community as a means of testing systems and workflows for the larger-scale centralized digitization of these collections, 2) to make these digitized collections available though our database, and 3) to upgrade our database so that it can most effectively house and present digital objects. This project, part of our long-term partnership with FCD host the Indiana University Bloomington Libraries and this repository community, will lay the groundwork for larger-scale community-wide digitization efforts.\n\nThe University of Miami, HistoryMiami, and Duke University will partner to digitize 65 boxes of archival records, 66 boxes of advertisements, and 500 artifacts related to Pan American Airlines, producing 134,500 digital images. They will collaborate with the Digital Public Library of America to develop a curated portal on aviation. These promotional materials, operational records, and artifacts highlight the complexity and reach of Pan Am, a leader in globalizing aviation and shaping public perceptions of air travel, whose impact on global affairs, corporate culture, and social history is still relevant today. UMiami will make OCR text available for bulk download and Duke metadata, providing new avenues for intensive data analysis and digital scholarship. The DPLA portal will bring these Pan Am collections together alongside other digitized aviation materials, truly enhancing the connectedness and discoverability of resources that resonate with a global audience of scholars, students, teachers, and the broader public.\n\nDigitizing the Yale Babylonian Collection is a two-year project to image and document ca. 35,000 cuneiform artifacts housed in the Yale Babylonian Collection (YBC) using flatbed scanning, High Dynamic Range Imaging (HDR) and Reflectance Transformation Imagery (RTI). The YBC represents one of the most substantial cuneiform collections in the world, and holds documents of unparalleled historical significance, shedding light on the earliest phases of human history. The aim of the project is to advance the research and education objectives associated with this collection by documenting and disseminating the artifacts through Yale’s Discovery portal, through the YBC website and through the international cuneiform aggregate dissemination portal, Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI). The project will make the cuneiform texts – a type of artifact that has been particularly targeted for looting and illicit trade – globally accessible to scholars as well as to the public.\n\nFilm on a Boat will serve a continuing partnership between the University of Florida (UF) and the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras (UPR) to digitize each institutions’ unique, hidden holdings of Caribbean newspapers on master microfilm. This three-year project seeks to digitize and make freely available 800,000 pages of pre-1923 Caribbean newspapers. The partners will produce new second generation microfilm negatives; catalog individual titles; conduct issue-level collation; send to a vendor for digitization, creation of derivative files, and OCR text files; perform quality control on deliverables; and ingest into the Digital Library of the Caribbean (www.dloc.com) and Biblioteca Digital Puertorriqueña (https://web.archive.org/web/20190403061220/http://bibliotecadigital.uprrp.edu:80/cdm/cdm/). Once available digitally, these resources will provide scholars with access to previously unavailable information on daily life in the Caribbean to enable new research and research questions from a variety of fields and disciplines on cross-cutting issues including migration, social movements, history, and literature.\n\nThe Amistad Research Center (ARC) seeks to digitize the raw outtake film footage for the civil-rights-era documentary film, Black Natchez (1967) and an unfinished sequel film. The film, by filmmakers Ed Pincus and David Neuman, charts early attempts to organize and register Black voters and the formation of the self-defense group Deacons for Defense and Justice in Natchez, Mississippi in 1965. The filmmakers returned to Natchez in 1967 following the murder of Wharlest Jackson, the treasurer of the Natchez branch of the NAACP, to document Jackson’s funeral and the aftermath of his murder. Footage is shot cinéma vérité style, with the filmmakers acting as “fly-on-the-wall” observers to the action. This project will digitize and provide access to approximately ninety-hours of rare black and white 16mm footage of the African American community in Natchez at the height of the violence, racial tensions, and the fight for civil rights during the 1960s.\n\nThis two year project, led by The College of Physicians of Philadelphia and Thomas Jefferson University, along with six other collaborating institutions listed below, would expose the history of medical education in Philadelphia through the end of the Civil War. As the birthplace of American medicine, Philadelphia was home to some of the greatest physicians of the period, who taught thousands of students. This project would digitize, describe, and provide access to lecture tickets, course schedules, theses, dissertations, student notes, faculty lectures notes, commencement addresses, opening addresses, and matriculation records, sharing not only the voices of the medical greats, but also the often unheard voices of students. Because of physicians’ flow between institutions across the city, this project would allow physically siloed material to be viewed and analyzed in one place for the first time.\n\nThe Montana State University (MSU) and Montana State Library propose to digitize a combination of archival documents, prairie-fish metadata, and aquatic insect field notes to create a unique digital corpus that will allow scientists, historians, sociologists, and economists to longitudinally study the cultural, ecological, and economic impacts of human population growth and climate change on the biodiversity of Montana’s rich fisheries.\n\nThis digital collection will comprise: 1) 60 linear-feet of manuscripts on aquatic biodiversity and cultural heritage surrounding fisheries and fish conservation efforts in the American West; 2) 4,000 metadata records for prairie fish specimens collected over the past century; and 3) 10,000 metadata records for the invertebrates that serve as food, pathogens, and competitors for these fish.\n\nThe digitized items will be available and discoverable via the Biodiversity Heritage Library, the Montana State Library Natural Heritage Program’s “Montana Field Guide” database, and the Symbiota, Fishnet2, and XBiod repositories.\n\nThe proposed 36-month scanning project focuses on the earliest governance records of Hawai’i, from the Hawaiian Kingdom through the overthrow of the Monarchy up to its annexation by the United States in 1900. This is a collaborative partnership between the Hawai’i State Archives, Hawaiinuiakea, Office of Hawaiian Education, and other cultural institutions. A major emphasis of the project will be on providing online access to ‘Olelo Hawai’i (Hawaiian Language) records from the Hawaiian Kingdom due to their ongoing cultural, as well as legal, importance. The legality of the overthrow and constitutionality of the subsequent annexation of the State are still contentious issues to the people of Hawai’i. The intent of this grant project is to add a layer of transparency to the operation and transition of government within Hawai’i by providing online description and global access to a legally and culturally important collection hidden by language (Hawaiian) and geography.\n\nThe College of Wooster proposes a project to digitize a collection of 1075 documents including letters, sermons, journals, and reports (among other document types) that together provide insight into the life of a 19th-century missionary woman and the important impact she had on women’s education in China. The project, which will begin in January 1, 2019 and end December 1, 2020, will result in an Omeka website that showcases the items alongside transcriptions of the handwritten text in the collection in English and Mandarin, and corresponding bilingual metadata. This collection will allow for a deep exploration of the impact of the female missionaries of the Presbyterian church in this particular region and will be broadly accessible and searchable in Mandarin and English. The materials in the collection will be valuable to researchers in History, East Asian Studies, Women’s and Gender Studies, Medicine, Religious Studies, and many more disciplines.\n\nThis three-year project will bring cross-disciplinary attention to six collections that collectively illuminate understudied intersections of the Jewish and Chinese immigrant and refugee experience. These collections are significant to studies of the impact of exclusionary US legislation on individuals and communities here and abroad, artistic expressions of conflicting identities, and community formation. The Center for Jewish History will digitize materials from its in-house partner, the American Jewish Historical Society (AJHS) and project partner, the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA). AJHS collections include the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS) Records, Cecilia Razovsky Papers, and United Service for New Americans Records. MOCA collections include the Fly to Freedom Collection of paper sculptures and two Chinese-American newspapers. Following digitization, a digital exhibit and an academic conference will extend the reach of the project by bringing together multiple scholarly fields in an investigation of overlaps between these two major New York immigrant populations.\n\nThe NUTARLUKI: “Make Them New Project will result in digitization of 2,006 video and audiotapes from a 12,000 item, rare, hidden-to-the-world collection housed at Bethel Broadcasting in remote, arctic Alaska. This Project is Phase Two of a multi-year digitization plan already in process with federal and tribal support. The Project will save at-risk physical media in a collection unlike any other in the world, that documents the lifestyles, cultural traditions and languages of Yup’ik and Cup’ik Eskimos living along the western coast of Alaska for thousands of years. It will preserve, digitize, and make publicly available 2,006 magnetic records, for which preservation priorities and strategies have been established. By formal agreement, digitized archives will be sent to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, posted online and shared for safekeeping at the Library of Congress, thereby enabling general access to a collection with local, national and international significance.\n\nThe Visibility for Disability Project will provide a freely available and fully accessible digital foundation for exploring the experience of disability in the United States and the evolution of the disability rights movement. Considering both depth of coverage and national historical significance, Special Collections and University Archives at UMass Amherst (SCUA) will select 130 linear feet of material for digitization representing nineteencollections. Spanning over 150 years of history, these collections provide valuable insight into the social, intellectual, political, and cultural background of disability and the ways in which new forms of cross-disability, rights-based activism grew within a broader civil rights struggle. Drawing on both the personal papers of activists and the records of organizations devoted to disability issues, this project will reveal the significant impact of disability activism on American politics and culture, while also providing rich resources framing the experience of physical and psychiatric disability.\n\nThe Adirondack Experience (ADKX) will contract with Hudson Archival to digitize 1,308 maps of the Adirondack region in New York State, dating from 1703 to 2004. The images will be uploaded into ADKX’s Past Perfect catalog, available to researchers online at https://adirondack.pastperfectonline.com/, and will also be shared with the consortium catalog New York Heritage (https://nyheritage.org/). The faceted search capabilities and image manipulation tools (zoom, rotate, etc.) offered by New York Heritage will allow for enhanced usability of these digitized maps. Metadata on New York Heritage is also harvested by the Digital Public Library of America, exposing these collections to a national audience. Joining other collections on Adirondack and state history on New York Heritage, these maps will illustrate for researchers the ways that the forces of human intervention and industrialization have shaped one of America’s largest wild spaces — New York’s six-million acre Adirondack Park."
