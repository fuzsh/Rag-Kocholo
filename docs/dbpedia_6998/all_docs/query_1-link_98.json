Brilliant!”\n\nDana O.\n\n“I am a homeroom mom but can’t make it to every activity my daughter’s class has so this enables me to see what they are doing. Thank you so much for creating this app!”\n\nShirl W.\n\n“We have been hacking a solution to this problem for our daughter's preschool for over a year. If you don't yet have kids, it can be hard to grok how obsessively parents want to see photo updates of their young ones and what's going on at school.”\n\nChris S."
