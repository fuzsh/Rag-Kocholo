Our collections include a wide range of objects, from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, representing almost every culture in the world. We are housed in a 560,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts building.\n\nWhat is meant by the term “collections”?\n\nOur collections are made up of the works of art that the Museum actually owns. (It does not include works in special exhibitions or works temporarily on loan to the Museum.) The collections range from Egyptian sarcophagi to period rooms, with only a fraction of these works on display at any given time. Collections are rotated (that is, some objects are put away so that others can be shown) in the collection galleries, but there are always many works in our storerooms.\n\nWhat is in the Museum’s collections?\n\nOur world-renowned collections range from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art and represent a wide range of cultures. All collections can be explored on our website.\n\nWhy are some objects not on view?\n\nThe collections are very large, which is why only a fraction of them can be on public view at any given time. Sometimes, works are lent to other museums for special exhibitions; sometimes, they are in our conservation laboratory for study or maintenance. Certain types of objects, such as watercolors, textiles, and photographs, are sensitive to light and begin to fade if they are exposed for too long, so their exhibition time is limited. Finally, as large as the Museum is, there is not enough room to display everything in the collections. In order to present our best works, collections are rotated periodically.\n\nWhat is meant by the term “special exhibition”?\n\nA special exhibition is a temporary installation of artworks devoted to a particular theme. Special exhibitions may include works from our collections but usually feature works that are borrowed from museums around the country or around the world. Sometimes a special exhibition will show works that belong to just one institution or owner. Special exhibitions are usually on view for about twelve weeks and often travel to other museums before or after being shown at the Brooklyn Museum.\n\nWhat are the current special exhibitions at the Museum?\n\nVisit our On View page.\n\nArtworks and Appraisals\n\nI’m an artist. How can I let you know about my work?\n\nWe are currently unable to accept or review artist submissions.\n\nHow can I donate a work of art to the Museum?\n\nSince its founding, the Brooklyn Museum has benefited from the public’s generosity in building our collections, and we continue to welcome gifts. However, not every object is right for our collections. If we already have an identical work, or if a work would not be exhibited, we prefer not to add it to the collection. Therefore, we have a careful process for reviewing all gift offers.\n\nIf you wish to offer an artwork to the Museum, please send images, object information (such as the artist, title, dimensions, medium, history, and provenance), and a letter outlining your intentions to BKM.Collections@brooklynmuseum.org. We appreciate your generosity.\n\nHow do I find out how much an object in the Brooklyn Museum collections is worth?\n\nWe do not disclose the monetary value of objects in our collections. These works are not for sale, and we do not have or keep values for them.\n\nCan you tell me the value of an artwork that I own?\n\nAs a nonprofit institution, the Brooklyn Museum does not provide authentications or appraisals to third parties. Instead, we suggest that you contact one of the following professional organizations. They can assist with questions about value, provenance, or attribution of works of art. Foundations and catalogue raisonné committees focusing on specific artists may also offer authentications.\n\nInternational Foundation for Art Research (IFAR)\n\n500 Fifth Avenue, Suite 935\n\nNew York, NY 10110\n\n212.391.6234\n\nAmerican Society of Appraisers\n\n2121 Cooperative Way, Suite 210\n\nHerndon, VA 20171\n\n800.ASA.VALU\n\nAppraisers Association of America, Inc.\n\n212 West 35th Street, 11th Floor South\n\nNew York, NY 10001\n\n212.889.5404 x14\n\nreferrals@appraisersassociation.org\n\nArt Dealers Association of America\n\n205 Lexington Avenue, Suite 901\n\nNew York, NY 10016\n\n212.488.5550"
