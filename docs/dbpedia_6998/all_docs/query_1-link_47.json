        "text": "British Museum Images is the definitive source for high-quality imagery of the British Museum Collections. Alongside stunning photography, we offer 3D images, video footage, scientific images and bespoke photography, plus research help and advice to support your image licensing needs. Catering primarily for image-buying professionals from a range of sectors, including publishing, broadcasting and advertising, our experienced Account Managers are always available to discuss your various projects. The current online selection of about 50,000 images represents only a small fraction of the eight million objects held by the Museum, but new images are uploaded every week. If you cannot find what you require, please contact us and we can, if necessary, arrange new photography.\n\nBritish Museum Images is a member of BAPLA (British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies) and abides by the BAPLA Code of Professional Ethics.\n\nAll our net revenue goes to support the Museum, and its commitment to ensuring the collection is freely accessible for anyone, while also funding its core activities, including research, conservation and education."
