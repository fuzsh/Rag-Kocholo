        "text": "About William and Grace McCarthy\n\nWilliam M. McCarthy (1876 – 1956) and Grace C. Kane (1878 – 1957) wed in the early 1900s and lived in San Francisco for most of their lives where William was stationed as an armament expert for the U.S. War Department. The collection features photographs of the McCarthys' travels, as well as the many family members and friends they encountered along the way. Always ready with his camera, William McCarthy also captured remarkable images of significant events, including shots of San Francisco before and after the 1906 earthquake, the fire that destroyed that city's iconic Cliff House in 1907, the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, and their 1938 journey into Mexico along the newly constructed Pan American Highway.\n\nAbout the Online Collection\n\nYou can browse the entire collection or use the search tool to look for specific images. Be sure to select the McCarthy Collection in the \"Search by Collection\" box.\n\nThe original black and white photographs, mounted in eleven albums, make up one of the few private collections preserved by the California State Archives. The entire collection was digitized by the State Archives' curatorial staff and builds upon the State Archives’ online exhibit, California Memoirs: The William M. McCarthy Photograph Collection, launched on Google Arts & Culture in July 2017.\n\nTo request a high-resolution scan of one or more of these images, contact the California State Archives via email or call the Reference Desk at (916) 653-2246. Please include the Title or Identifier for each photograph in which you are interested, as well as the desired format (tiff, jpg, pdf) and resolution (DPI) for the requested scan. Duplication fees will apply.\n\nSome suggested topics appear below with sample images of what you will encounter in this unique photographic journey through life during the early twentieth century.\n\nCopyright and Permission to Use\n\nThe California State Archives, a division of the California Secretary of State’s Office, owns the copyright to the William M.
