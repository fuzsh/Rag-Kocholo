        "text": "The Oberwolfach Photo Collection -\n\nPhotographs of Mathematicians from all over the world\n\nThe Oberwolfach Photo Collection is based on Prof. Konrad Jacobs' (Erlangen) large collection of photographs of mathematicians from all over the world. In the 1950's Prof. Jacobs started to make copies of the photographs he had taken and donated these copies to the MFO. In 2005 he transferred his whole collection completely with all rights to the MFO. The collection also contains a lot of pictures taken by Prof. George M. Bergman (Berkeley), whose pictures were scanned by the MFO and added to the database in 2010/11. Since about 1998 we take photos from every single group visiting Oberwolfach and so try to continue this excellent collection.\n\nWe are interested in further enlarging our collection and would very much appreciate it to receive additional photographs, like for example of well-known mathematicians or of events interesting for the mathematical community. Since we want our collection to be as complete as possible, a relation to Oberwolfach is not compulsory. For that reason we would like to invite those who are interested to support us in our efforts to provide us with photographs (either conventional or digitized), or to inform us about potential sources. Appropriate photographs will then be added to our collection. We do not claim a copyright, but we need the authorization that allows the publication of the photographs and the transmission to third parties for scientific needs only. In particular, we need the assurance that the personal rights of the depicted persons are not violated and that no copyrights of third parties are infringed. Additional information and corrections concerning the photographs we have published are most welcome.\n\nCopyright Information/Use of the pictures\n\nThe online-version of the collection is presented in a minimized format. Publishing Houses or researchers wishing to use some of the photos within a printed publication are requested to contact the MFO to get the original version, provided that there are no outstanding copyright problems. In case of a publication we should appreciate to receive a complimentary copy of the respective book or issue for our library. Please note, that we do not allow the use of our high resolution pictures in digital publications. For the purpose of digital publications the low resolution pictures (as displayed on this website) shall be used.\n\nThe Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach gGmbH (MFO) owns the copyright to many of the images used on this website. Those images can be used in low resolution (as displayed on this website) on the terms of the Creative Commons License Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Germany.\n\nIMPORTANT: The Creative Commons License is not applicable for images to which the MFO does not own the copyright. If the copyright is owned by a third party, you must obtain a separate permission to use it, regardless if it is low resolution or high resolution. To be sure, please inform yourself beforehand on the copyright situation by asking at photos@mfo.de.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nWe cannot guarantee that there may not be outstanding copyright problems. We also cannot guarantee that there is no invasion of personal privacy. However, liability claims against the MFO in respect of the content of this website are in principle ruled out provided that there is no provable culpable intent or gross negligence on the MFO's part. In case you have information on rights of any third party, we kindly ask you to contact us.\n\nInformation for depicted persons\n\nIf you would like to know if this database also contains photos of you please type your name or the title of the meeting you have visited in Oberwolfach into the search box at the left. Click on the photos to see if any additional information is stored. If the information is not correct or if you wish a particular portrait photo of you to be deleted, please inform us via photos@mfo.de. Kindly note, that in case of group photos of scientific events your right of deletion may not apply because of our legitimate interest to document all scientific events at the institute (Articles 17(1) lit. b and 6(1) lit. f GDPR). Furthermore, already published printed media (e.g. annual reports) containing the photo remain unaffected.\n\nIf you would like to use a particular photo of you for your own purposes, please send a request to photos@mfo.de as well, and we will send you the photo in full resolution, as soon as possible.\n\nIn general, according to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the rights to obtain confirmation as to whether or not photos of you are being processed by the institute, from where we got them and to whom we eventually passed them (Article 15 GDPR), to obtain rectification of inaccurate data concerning the photos (Article 16 GDPR), to withdraw your consent to the processing of the photos (Article 17 GDPR), to obtain restriction of processing of the photos (Article 18 GDPR), to receive the photos in full resolution and in a digital format for your own further use (Article 20 GDPR), to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider the processing of the photo infringes the GDPR (Article 77 GDPR).\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nWe would like to express our sincere thanks to all persons who have been providing photographs to the MFO.\n\nIn particular we wish to thank:\n\nProf. Konrad Jacobs, Erlangen, for his generous support to build up our photo collection\n\nProf. George M. Bergman, Berkeley\n\nProf. Ludwig Danzer, Dortmund\n\nProf. Gerd Fischer, MÃ¼nchen\n\nSpecial thanks go to Springer-Verlag Heidelberg for helping to organize the digitalization of the photos.\n\nContact"
