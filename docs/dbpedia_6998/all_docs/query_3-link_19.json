Consult the CMA Collection Online or metadata associated with an object via the application programming interface (API) or data from the GitHub Repository for information that can be used for citations.\n\nThere are a variety of citation formats, but consider including the following:\n\nArtist. Title. Date (year). Medium. Dimensions. The Cleveland Museum of Art. Credit Line. Accession Number. URL from www.clevelandart.org/\n\nPlease Note\n\nA credit line features of the name of the individual or group who sourced or donated an artwork to the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\nAn accession number is the CMA’s official inventory number of record that is an artwork’s unique identifier in the collection. This number is helpful for identifying a work, especially for study, research, and publication purposes.\n\nCollection Online Art Detail Page\n\nOn the Collection Online, you may print the page as a PDF for reference and research purposes.\n\nAdditionally, images and metadata may be downloaded via the “download” button on the artwork page. Please note that while portions of metadata are available for every object in the CMA's collection through open access, image downloads are only available for CC0 artworks.\n\nImage\n\nUsers interested in access to portions of metadata dedicated to the public domain with CC0 can access over 61,000 records via the CMA’s public application program interface (API). No key or token is required for access. Documentation regarding fields, departments, and data types is available through the API as well. Portions of metadata are made available for all digital images of public domain artworks whose underlying work is in the public domain including a URL to corresponding image file. Artworks in the CMA’s collection which may have copyright or other restrictions have portions of metadata with CC0, but no image file is supplied by CMA due restrictions.\n\nUsers can also access the CMA's collection data via a GitHub Repository. Detailed documentation is available here along with the data formatted in .JSON and .CSV. Please note that the CMA does not support pull requests. Data is refreshed at a weekly rate, so please check often for the latest revisions.\n\nCC0 CMA collection data and images are also available from Internet Archive, Wikimedia Commons, and Wikidata."
