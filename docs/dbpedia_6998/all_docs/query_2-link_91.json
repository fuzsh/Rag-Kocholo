        "text": "This section describes all the possible actions related to managing photo galleries for a property through the Photo API. The Photo API supports two types of photo galleries:\n\nProperty-level photo gallery: When you upload a new photo, the API places the photo in the property-level photo gallery. You can perform several actions with the property-level photo gallery. For more information, see managing the property-level photo gallery.\n\nRoom-level photo gallery: For each room type, you can have a separate photo gallery. You can move photos from the property-level photo gallery to a specific room-level photo gallery. For more information, see managing room-level photo galleries.\n\nManaging the property-level photo gallery\n\nYou can perform the following actions with the property-level photo gallery:\n\nRetrieve the property-level photo gallery.\n\nMove photos to the property-level photo gallery.\n\nRemove photos from the property-level photo gallery.\n\nManage smart ordering of photos in the property-level photo gallery.\n\nChange the order of photos in the property-level photo gallery.\n\nSet a main photo for the property-level photo gallery.\n\nRetrieving the property-level photo gallery\n\nThe GET /properties/{property_id}/gallery request enables you to retrieve the property-level photo gallery.\n\nPath parameters\n\nThe following table describes the path parameters:\n\nResponse body example\n\nThe following is a successful response body example:\n\nResponse body parameters\n\nThe following table describes the response elements:\n\nMoving photos to the property-level photo gallery\n\nThe POST /properties/{property_id}/gallery request enables you to move photos to the property-level photo gallery. Uploaded photos are automatically placed within the property-level photo gallery, but you can remove them from this gallery. See Removing photos from the property-level photo gallery.\n\nPath parameters\n\nThe following table describes the path parameters:\n\nBody parameters\n\nThe following table describes the elements you must add in the request body:\n\nRequest body example\n\nThe following is a request body example:\n\nResponse body example\n\nThe following is a successful response body example:\n\nResponse body parameters\n\nThe following table describes the response elements:\n\nRemoving photos from the property-level photo gallery\n\nThe POST /properties/{property_id}/gallery request enables you to remove a photo from the property-level photo gallery, which does not imply deleting the photo.\n\nPath parameters\n\nThe following table describes the path parameters:\n\nBody parameters\n\nThe following table describes the elements you must add in the request body:\n\nRequest body example\n\nThe following is a request body example:\n\nResponse body example\n\nThe following is a successful response body example:\n\nResponse body parameters\n\nThe following table describes the response elements:\n\nChanging the order of photos in the property-level photo gallery\n\nThe POST /properties/{property_id}/gallery request enables you to change the order of the photos in the property-level photo gallery. The order that you choose, is the order they appear on Booking.com, provided you have disabled smart ordering.\n\nPath parameters\n\nThe following table describes the path parameters:\n\nBody parameters\n\nThe following table describes the elements you must add in the request body:\n\nRequest body example\n\nThe following is a request body example:\n\nResponse body example\n\nThe following is a successful response body example:\n\nResponse body parameters\n\nThe following table describes the response elements:\n\nSetting a main photo for the property-level photo gallery\n\nThe POST /properties/{property_id}/gallery request enables you to set a specific photo as the main photo for a property, which is the photo guests see when going through search results.\n\nPath parameters\n\nThe following table describes the path parameters:\n\nBody parameters\n\nThe following table describes the elements you must add in the request body:\n\nRequest body example\n\nThe following is a request body example:\n\nResponse body example\n\nThe following is a successful response body example:\n\nResponse body parameters\n\nThe following table describes the response elements:\n\nManaging smart ordering\n\nUse the POST /properties/{property_id}/gallery request to enable or disable smart ordering. When smart ordering is enabled for a property, the order in which the guests see the property's photos on the property page is determined by Booking.com's machine learning algorithm. Alternatively, you can disable smart ordering using this endpoint and follow one of the two approaches:\n\nAs a provider, you can set the photo order using the Photo API\n\nLet the property set the order using the extranet\n\nRegardless of the smart order setting, the property can view the chosen order on the extranet or using the API. Enable smart ordering to help boost guests' views.\n\nPath parameters\n\nThe following table describes the path parameters:\n\nBody parameters\n\nThe following table describes the elements you must add in the request body:\n\nRequest body example\n\nThe following is a request body example:\n\nResponse body example\n\nThe following is a successful response body example:\n\nResponse body parameters\n\nThe following table describes the response elements:\n\nManaging room-level photo galleries\n\nQuick actions:\n\nRetrieving a room-level photo gallery.\n\nMoving photos to a room-level photo gallery.\n\nRemoving photos from a room-level photo gallery.\n\nChanging the order of photos in a room-level photo gallery.\n\nRetrieving a room-level photo gallery\n\nThe GET /properties/{property_id}/rooms/{room_id}/gallery request enables you to retrieve a specific room-level photo gallery.\n\nPath parameters\n\nThe following table describes the path parameters:\n\nResponse body example\n\nThe following is a successful response body example:\n\nResponse body parameters\n\nThe following table describes the response elements:\n\nMoving photos to a room-level photo gallery\n\nThe POST /properties/{property_id}/rooms/{room_id}/gallery request enables you to move photos to a room-level photo gallery.\n\nPath parameters\n\nThe following table describes the path parameters:\n\nBody parameters\n\nThe following table describes the elements you must add in the request body:\n\nRequest body example\n\nThe following is a request body example:\n\nResponse body example\n\nThe following is a successful response body example:\n\nResponse body parameters\n\nThe following table describes the response elements:\n\nRemoving photos from a room-level photo gallery\n\nThe POST /properties/{property_id}/rooms/{room_id}/gallery request enables you to remove a photo from a room-level photo gallery, which does not necessarily mean that you permanently delete the photo.
