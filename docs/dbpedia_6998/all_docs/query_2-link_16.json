        "text": "The Florida Photographic Collection is:\n\nComprised of approximately 1.5 million still images and over 7,000 movies and video tapes.\n\nA nationally recognized component of the State Archives of Florida.\n\nThe largest and most comprehensive collection of Florida-related images in existence.\n\nThe Photographic Collection visually documents the people, places and events that have contributed to the state's history and development from the mid-15th century to the present.\n\nThe earliest items in the collection are copies of colonial-era maps and prints, while photographic documentation begins from the middle of the 19th century.\n\nThe earliest photograph dates back to 1845.\n\nThe Photographic Collection's films and videos date from 1916 to the present.\n\nYour family photographs\n\nThe Florida Photographic Collection strives to document Florida's history through a comprehensive array of still and moving images. We need public awareness, participation and support to continue to realize this goal through an ongoing collecting program.\n\nMost of the holdings in the collection have been obtained singly or in small groups. Together they form the most complete visual portrait of Florida - one that draws its strength from family photographs depicting the homes of Floridians, their work and their pastimes.\n\nIf you have a photograph, postcard or other photographic image that depicts any facet of Florida history that you would like to donate to the collection, please contact the Florida Photographic Collection at 850.245.6708."
