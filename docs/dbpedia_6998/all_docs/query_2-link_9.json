        "text": "I'm a professional photographer. My old website was an online gallery, but it was 10 years old and no longer up to today's standards, notably compatibility with tablets and smartphones. So I started looking for a robust solution: 3,000 albums and 150,000 high-resolution photos. My website is an important platform, as it allows me to make a backup of my work, to have a gallery for each customer, and each customer has a 10-year history and must be able to identify himself and download his old reports. After a long search, I came across Piwigo, which met all my expectations. So I created a test gallery and realized that there was even a module that allowed me to take over my old Gallery2 website. It's been almost a year since the migration. The site is fast and handles the mass of information well. The visual customization allowed me to get exactly what I wanted. Importantly, with open-source software, the site and community forum are very active and responsive to questions and problem-solving. In short, I'm delighted to have chosen Piwigo for the centerpiece of my professional activity.\n\nLuc Viatour\n\nPhotographers & individuals Belgium\n\nI'd like to express my gratitude and appreciation to Piwigo, without whom I'd have been a very unhappy archivist. Since 2007, I've been shooting my life, day by day. In 2010, I felt the intrinsic fear of losing my photos. That's when Piwigo came into my life, never to leave again. Today, I manage over 50,000 photos, and despite the sheer number, the gallery remains fluid and the many themes enhance the interface to suit your tastes. The other reason I love Piwigo is the ability to customize who sees each folder. I have 200 users who can see all the photos of all the evenings we've spent together. And thanks to tags, each of my friends can, in a way, follow his or her evolution by seeing all the photos in which he or she appears and has been tagged. Piwigo is like the Wordpress of photography.\n\nReno Laithienne\n\nPhotographers & individuals France\n\nI love photography, I travel and shoot various events and so I have quite a number of photos to manage. Coming from those primitive directory-based PHP scripts, I realized I need more. Albums, tags, geo-tagging, privacy management, virtual albums, user managementâ€¦ And all that self-hosted. And thus, I've invited Piwigo to my life. Piwigo has all the functionality I need and it's under an active development so it's continuously improving. I love Piwigo because it's fairly easy to install and then manage, easy to backup, and it's free-and-open-source software.\n\nDave\n\nPhotographers & individuals Czech Republic"
