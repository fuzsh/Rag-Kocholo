        "text": "The intensive, two-year (6 term) graduate program assumes that a film or photographic preservation specialist or collections manager must be acquainted with the materials of film/photography, with its history, the social and cultural conditions of its production, and the critical and theoretical conceptions that inform its reception. Eleven half-year courses, an internship, a field placement (residency), and a professional practice project/thesis are designed to provide students with a graduate program in which historical knowledge, practical experience, and professional education are fully integrated.\n\nCourse offerings in the graduate program include seminars in photographic and film materials and history, and issues of curatorial practice and practicums taught by Toronto Metropolitan University's faculty who are preservation and conservation specialists. Students complete an internship using archives and special collections in the third term of the program."
