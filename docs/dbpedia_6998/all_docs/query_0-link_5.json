        "text": "Unsplash is a great source for free photos that can be used for school projects, websites, print publications and more. The photos don’t require attribution, though the photographers who donate their photos certainly appreciate it when you give them credit. And the site doesn’t require registration to find and download photos. With over 1 million photos, there’s lots to choose from.\n\nThis summer Unsplash created 10 collections of photos called Unsplash for Education. Topics include History, Tech, Art, Health, Politics and more. Each collection has several hundred photos and include images from organizations like NASA, NYPL and NOAA.\n\nA handy feature of Unsplash is the ability to create custom collections of photos. Just create a free account, search or browse for images and use the Collect button to add them to collections. Your collections can be kept private or are easily shared, for example this New Zealand collection.\n\nLike any image collection, there might be some images that aren’t appropriate for younger children. But since all the images are free to download, you could download a collection of images and make them available to students through a other means, a shared computer drive or a curation collection tool like Wakelet.\n\n(via The Scout Report)"
