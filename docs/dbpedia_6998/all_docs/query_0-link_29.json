        "text": "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC\n\nPHOTO ARK\n\nSPECIES TO DATE\n\n16,000\n\nThe National Geographic Photo Ark uses the power of photography to inspire people to help protect at-risk species before it’s too late. Explorer, photographer, and founder of the Photo Ark Joel Sartore has taken portraits of 16,000 species — and counting — in his quest to document our world’s astonishing biodiversity! He’s over half way to his goal of documenting all of the approximately 20,000 species living in the world’s zoos, aquariums, and wildlife sanctuaries.\n\nExplore all the species in the National Geographic Photo Ark at joelsartore.com/photo-ark.\n\nSTORIES OF IMPACT\n\nJoel Sartore shares the weird and wonderful animals we are working to save during the 2018 National Geographic Explorers Festival.\n\nJoel Sartore discusses Photo Ark on the Weather Channel.\n\nBy saving other species, we will be saving our own, Joel Sartore explains on CBS Sunday Morning.\n\nA National Geographic Photo Ark EDGE Fellow is focused on tapir recovery in Sierra Madre de Chiapas.\n\nNational Geographic and the Zoological Society of London Announce Africa Cohort of National Geographic Photo Ark EDGE Fellows.\n\nA National Geographic Photo Ark EDGE Fellow is passionate about manatee conservation in Belize.\n\nIn honor of Endangered Species Day, Photo Ark founder Joel Sartore announced the addition of the Ark’s 10,000th species — the güiña, the smallest wildcat in the Americas.\n\nJoel Sartore, founder of the National Geographic Photo Ark, makes history by taking what is likely the first photo of the long-toothed dart moth (Dichagyris longidens) alive.\n\nAn Arabian cobra, Naja arabica, is the 12,000th species in the National Geographic Photo Ark.\n\nNational Geographic Explorer and Photo Ark founder Joel Sartore photographed the “spoonie” at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust Slimbridge in Gloucestershire, UK.\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON\n\nNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC PHOTO ARK FEATURED ON 60 MINUTES\n\n60 Minutes profiles National Geographic Explorer, photographer, and founder of the Photo Ark Joel Sartore on his quest to help save at-risk species by photographing every species currently living in the world’s zoos, aquariums, and wildlife sanctuaries.\n\nCOURTESY OF CBS/60 MINUTES\n\nI want people to care, to fall in love, and to take action.\n\nJoel Sartore\n\nPhoto Ark is a multiyear effort to document every species living in zoos, aquariums, and wildlife sanctuaries, inspire action through education, and help protect wildlife by supporting on-the-ground conservation efforts. National Geographic Explorer Joel Sartore started the Photo Ark in his hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2006. Since then, he has visited more than 50 countries and photographed more than 14,000 species in his quest to create this photo archive of global biodiversity. No matter its size, each animal is treated with the same amount of affection and respect. The results are portraits that are not just stunningly beautiful, but also intimate and moving.\n\nMAKING AN IMPACT\n\nWHAT WE'RE DOING\n\nMAKING AN IMPACT\n\nProtecting Species Through the Power of Photography\n\nWith your support, the Photo Ark will become a record of every species living in human care that inspires people to help protect these animals, fund on-the-ground conservation projects focused on those species most in need of protection, and motivate the next generation to take action through education programs.\n\nCREATING PORTRAITS OF HOPE\n\nUsing solid black and white backgrounds to create unique portraits, the Photo Ark makes each animal equal––so that a mouse appears just as large and important as an elephant––and allows people to look deeply into the eyes of each animal and see they are important and so worthy of protection.\n\nPROTECTING SPECIES AT RISK\n\nTo help save wildlife and sound the alarm for lesser-known species at risk, we partnered with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) to create the National Geographic Photo Ark EDGE Fellowships. The program provides funding, training, and capacity development to on-the-ground conservationists working to bring the most at-risk species featured in Photo Ark back from the verge of extinction. Learn More About the Fellows\n\nINSPIRING LEARNING AND ACTION\n\nThe National Geographic Photo Ark is teaching people of all ages about our planet’s amazing biodiversity and fostering a real human connection to Earth’s animals. The project engages students in the classroom through free educational materials and activities, and inspires the public through special exhibitions and events around the world. An interactive digital experience allows learners to explore each animal in the collection and share information about endangered species with their friends.\n\nRAISING AWARENESS THROUGH EXHIBITIONS\n\nMuseums and institutions around the world are hosting Photo Ark exhibitions to raise awareness for many species in need of greater conservation. Each exhibition features large-format prints, as well as a grid of many more images to highlight the range of species in the Photo Ark.\n\nAT-RISK SPECIES\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nWHY IT MATTERS\n\nSOUNDING THE ALARM FOR AT-RISK SPECIES, ONE PHOTOGRAPH AT A TIME\n\nThe interaction between animals and their environments are critical for maintaining a healthy planet that we call home. But for many species, time is running out. When you remove one, it affects us all. That’s why National Geographic, along with Explorer Joel Sartore, is dedicated to finding solutions to protect them.\n\nWe’re documenting every species in human care to inspire people to care and help protect these animals. Creating intimate portraits of an estimated 20,000 species of birds, fish, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates serves as an important record of each animal’s existence, and a powerful testament to the importance of saving them.\n\n“IT’S THE EYE CONTACT THAT MOVES PEOPLE. IT ENGAGES FEELINGS OF COMPASSION AND A DESIRE TO HELP.”\n\nJoel Sartore\n\nExplorer, photographer, and founder of Photo Ark\n\nPROTECTING AT-RISK SPECIES\n\nPhoto Ark supports on-the-ground conservation projects to help protect and save species in decline. Much-needed funding and attention is provided to endangered species (including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and fish) that we have a real chance of helping, and which do not currently have a sustained effort from others to protect them.\n\nFlorida panther: Fewer than 230 Florida panthers left in the wild. Photographed at the Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida.\n\nPHOTOGRAPH BY JOEL SARTORE\n\nWhite-backed vulture: Fewer than 270,000 left in the wild. Photographed at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo.

Meant for grades 6-8.\n\nIntroduce students to the factors and consequences of widespread amphibian decline with this activity from Explorer magazine for grades 3-5.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nPHOTO ARK & GOOGLE EARTH\n\nGo behind the scenes and learn more about the amazing species in the Photo Ark with this interactive Google Earth Voyager Story.\n\nTRAVELING\n\nEXHIBITIONS\n\nMUSEUM EXHIBITIONS\n\nMuseums and institutions around the world are hosting Photo Ark exhibitions to raise awareness for many species in need of greater conservation. Each exhibition will feature large-format prints, as well as a grid of many more images to highlight the range of species in the Photo Ark. Visitors are encouraged to take selfies with these impressive portraits to show their support.\n\nBRUCE MUSEUM LOCATED IN GREENWICH, CT\n\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\n\nHELP BUILD THE PHOTO ARK\n\nThousands of species are at risk and time is running out. Join National Geographic Explorer Joel Sartore as he leads the Photo Ark project to document our planet’s biodiversity and find innovative solutions to help save threatened species and protect their critical habitats.\n\nHELP US SAVE WILDLIFE\n\nIN YOUR HOME\n\nConsider changing your daily habits to preserve natural resources—overuse can negatively impact wildlife. Avoid single-use plastics, eat less meat and educate your friends and family about the importance of protecting the planet.\n\nIN YOUR BACKYARD\n\nLook for alternatives to putting chemicals on your lawn, which poison the soil, air, and water. Dedicate your home and/or office landscaping to native plants in order to save pollinating insects, which play a crucial role in producing fruits and vegetables.\n\nIN YOUR COMMUNITY\n\nLearn about species that are native to where you live and help them thrive by preserving and restoring their habitats. Explore local green spaces and consider volunteer opportunities with wildlife rehabilitation efforts in your community.\n\nREAD THE BOOK\n\nVANISHING\n\nVanishing, The World’s Most Vulnerable Animals, is filled with Sartore’s stunning photos of 287 of the world’s most vulnerable species.\n\nCONNECT\n\nFOLLOW PHOTO ARK\n\nKeep up with Photo Ark and Joel Sartore by following the project on Facebook and Instagram."
