        "text": "Each photo you upload can have three versions: thumb, standard and zoom. These sizes are applied when an image is downloaded by a user, rather than when a photo is added to a web page.\n\nDepending on how you display the photos, you may or may not need all three versions. Select the options you need when creating the content category.\n\nUploaded photos are stored at their original size, but can be re-sized from an album, which affects the size of the image when added to a web page. When an image is initially uploaded, users can select the thumbnail in the modal to see a preview of its actual size and orientation.\n\nWhen uploading the photo, you must upload the largest-sized photo (for example, if you are using the zoom option, upload a photo that is 800 x 800 px instead of a photo that is 200 px x 200 px). The system will then automatically create the standard-sized and thumb-sized photos. If multiple photos have been added to a category, select Next photo to advance through the slideshow and Previous photo to move back.\n\nThumb view\n\nStandard view\n\nZoom view\n\nSchool Website System has its own default dimensions for the thumb, standard and zoom versions of a photo:\n\nThumbnail: 80 x 80 pixels Max 240 x 240 pixels\n\nStandard: 320 x 320 pixels Max 960 x 960 pixels\n\nZoom: 800 x 800 pixels Max 2400 x 2400 pixels\n\nThe maximum size allowed for all images is 2400 x 2400 pixels.\n\nThese maximum dimensions are applied when users download photos which were uploaded to this album, unless you override them by entering a custom max width and max height in the photo category. Your photo dimensions will vary, depending on where the photos are going to appear on your site (in a sidebar, on the homepage, in the embedded flash player, etc). A support representative will provide you with your Site Specs document which will contain the exact photo dimensions for your site.\n\nFor example, letâs say you need to add a photo to the sidebar of a page, which is only 190px wide. If space allows, the image appears the size it was uploaded (or the size it was edited to). Otherwise, it's re-sized to fit the smaller space requirements (and may be deleted entirely.) Your photo will not appear wider than 190px, and fits in the sidebar.\n\nThese maximum dimensions will automatically be applied to the photos you upload,\n\nEven if you enter a custom max width and height, it is still recommended that you crop your images to the correct dimension and save them for the web to ensure that you get the best quality and file size.\n\nThe system will maintain the aspect ratio of your photos."
