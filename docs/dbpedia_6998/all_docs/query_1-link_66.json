        "text": "The Photos app recognizes the faces of people and pets in your photos and groups them together. You can name the people or pets in your photos, mark your favorites, and more.\n\nHere's how it works\n\nThe Photos app scans your photos to help you quickly recognize the people, scenes, and objects within the photos. And in iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and later, the Photos app can recognize dogs and cats, too. Depending on the number of photos that you have, you can watch a Memory movie of them. And when you have iCloud Photos turned on, the people you favorite or name stay up to date across your Apple devices.\n\nFind someone in the People & Pets album\n\nThe Photos app organizes the images of the people, dogs, and cats in the People & Pets album (or the People album if no dogs or cats are identified). You'll see a face thumbnail for each person or pet your device recognizes. To find someone in your People & Pets album:\n\nOpen the Photos app.\n\nTap the Albums tab.\n\nTap the People & Pets album.\n\nIf you named a person or pet in the Photos app, you can also find them under the Search tab. Just tap Search , then type their name.\n\nLearn what to do if you don't see your pets in the People & Pets album\n\nAdd someone to the People & Pets album\n\nOpen a photo of the person or pet that you want to add.\n\nTap the Info button , then tap the face of the person or pet with a question mark.\n\nTap Name This Person or Name This Pet and type their name or tap the name if it shows up.\n\nTap Next, then tap Done.\n\nPut a name to a face\n\nPhotos suggests names from your Contacts, but you can manually add a name to a person that's already in your People & Pets album:\n\nOpen the People & Pets album, then tap the thumbnail of the person that you want to name.\n\nTap Add Name at the top of the screen.\n\nType the person's name or select their name if it shows up.\n\nTap Next, then tap Done.\n\nMerge photos of the same person\n\nSometimes the same person is identified in more than one group within your People & Pets album. To merge all of the photos under one group:\n\nGo to the People album and tap Select.\n\nSelect the people that you want to merge.\n\nTap Merge near the bottom of the screen.\n\nTap Yes to confirm the merge.\n\nUse \"Feature Less\" in the People & Pets album\n\nWith iOS 14 and later, you can have the Photos app suggest certain people less frequently. This adjusts the way the Photos app curates your Memories, Featured photos, and the photos that you see in the Photos widget â€” so you see less photos of these people. Here's how:\n\nOpen the People album and tap the person's thumbnail.\n\nTap the More button in the upper-right corner.\n\nTap \"Feature [Name] Less.\"\n\nSelect an option, like Feature This Person Less or Remove This Person From People & Pets, then tap Confirm.\n\nIf you choose to feature someone less, you'll have to reset your Memories settings in order to see that person again in the People album. Go to Settings > Photos, tap Reset Suggested Memories, then tap Reset to confirm.\n\nFavorite people\n\nMark the People that you access the most as a Favorite so that it's easier to find them. If you haven't set any Favorites yet, you'll see the Favorite button on the photos. To favorite someone, just tap the Favorite button .\n\nYou can also tap the person's thumbnail, tap the More button , then tap \"Add [Name] to Favorites.\" To favorite multiple people at once, tap Select, tap each person that you want to favorite, then tap Favorite at the bottom of the People album.\n\nChange a thumbnail photo\n\nPhotos automatically assigns a face thumbnail for each person it recognizes. If you want to use a different photo for someone's thumbnail, you can change it from their photo collection screen:\n\nOpen the People & Pets album, then tap the person or pet.\n\nTap Select, then tap Show Faces to focus on just their face in each photo.\n\nTap the photo that you want to use.\n\nTap the Share button , then tap Make Key Photo.\n\nFix mixed-up names and faces\n\nIf you notice that there's a photo of someone in a collection that's misidentified, you can remove it:"
