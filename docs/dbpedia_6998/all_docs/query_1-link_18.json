        "text": "Your photo is a vital part of your visa application. To learn more, review the information below on how to provide a suitable photo. Digital images are required for some visa categories, while photos are required for other visa categories. The acceptance of your digital image or photo is at the discretion of the U.S. embassy or consulate where you apply.\n\nWe recommend you use a professional visa photo service to ensure your photo meets all the requirements.\n\nYour photos or digital images must be:\n\nIn color\n\nSized such that the head is between 1 inch and 1 3/8 inches (22 mm and 35 mm) or 50% and 69% of the image's total height from the bottom of the chin to the top of the head. View the Photo Composition Template for more size requirement details.\n\nTaken within the last 6 months to reflect your current appearance\n\nTaken in front of a plain white or off-white background\n\nTaken in full-face view directly facing the camera\n\nWith a neutral facial expression and both eyes open\n\nTaken in clothing that you normally wear on a daily basis\n\nUniforms should not be worn in your photo, except religious clothing that is worn daily.\n\nDo not wear a hat or head covering that obscures the hair or hairline, unless worn daily for a religious purpose. Your full face must be visible, and the head covering must not cast any shadows on your face.\n\nHeadphones, wireless hands-free devices, or similar items are not acceptable in your photo.\n\nEyeglasses are no longer allowed in new visa photos, except in rare circumstances when eyeglasses cannot be removed for medical reasons; e.g., the applicant has recently had ocular surgery and the eyeglasses are necessary to protect the applicant's eyes. A medical statement signed by a medical professional/health practitioner must be provided in these cases. If the eyeglasses are accepted for medical reasons:\n\nThe frames of the eyeglasses must not cover the eye(s).\n\nThere must not be glare on eyeglasses that obscures the eye(s).\n\nThere must not be shadows or refraction from the eyeglasses that obscures the eye(s).\n\nIf you normally wear a hearing device or similar articles, they may be worn in your photo.\n\nReview the Photo Examples to see examples of acceptable and unacceptable photos. Photos copied or digitally scanned from driverâ€™s licenses or other official documents are not acceptable. In addition, snapshots, magazine photos, low quality vending machine or mobile phone photos, and full-length photographs are not acceptable.\n\nPlease review the additional photo requirements for:\n\nNonimmigrant Visas\n\nImmigrant Visas\n\nDiversity Visa (DV) Program\n\nAdditional Information\n\nTips for taking photos yourself\n\nChange of Appearance\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nAdditional Requirements for Nonimmigrant Visas\n\nApplicants using Form DS-160 or Form DS-1648\n\nIf you are applying for a nonimmigrant visa by filling out the DS-160 or DS-1648 online form, the form will instruct you to upload your digital image as part of completing the online visa application form. Review the Digital Image Requirements, which also provide additional requirements if you are scanning an existing photo.\n\nSome embassies and consulates require visa applicants to bring one (1) photo, which meets requirements, to the interview. Review the embassy or consulate instructions where you will apply to learn more.\n\nAdditional Requirements for the Diversity Visa (DV) Program\n\nDiversity Visa Program Entrants\n\nIf you are entering the Diversity Visa (DV) Program online, you must upload your digital image as part of your entry. Your digital image must be:\n\nIn JPEG (.jpg) file format\n\nEqual to or less than 240 kB (kilobytes) in file size\n\nIn a square aspect ratio (height must equal width)\n\n600x600 pixels in dimension\n\nDo you want to scan an existing photo? In addition to the digital image requirements, your existing photo must be:\n\n2 x 2 inches (51 x 51 mm)\n\nScanned at a resolution of 300 pixels per inch (12 pixels per millimeter)\n\nDo you want to take the photo yourself?\n\nWhile we recommend you use a professional visa photo service to ensure your photo meets all the requirements, you may take the photo yourself. Photos must not be digitally enhanced or altered to change your appearance in any way. Please review the following technical requirements and references for guidance on taking your own photo.\n\nPhoto Composition Template\n\nDigital Image Requirements\n\nChange of Appearance\n\nIf your photo(s) or digital image does not reflect your current appearance, even if it is not older than 6 months, the U.S. embassy or consulate will request that you provide a new photo with your application.\n\nApplicants will be requested to obtain a new photo if they have:\n\nUndergone significant facial surgery or trauma\n\nAdded or removed numerous/large facial piercings or tattoos\n\nUndergone a significant amount of weight loss or gain\n\nMade a gender transition\n\nGenerally, if you can still be identified from the photo in your visa application, you will not need to submit a new photo. For example, growing a beard or coloring your hair would not generally be considered a significant change of appearance.\n\nIf the appearance of your child under the age of 16 has changed due to the normal aging process, he or she will generally not have to provide a new photo. However, the acceptance of your photo or digital image is at the discretion of the U.S. embassy or consulate where you apply."
