Learn how to set up and use a Shared Library.\n\nHow iCloud Shared Photo Library works\n\nCreate a Shared Library\n\nJoin a Shared Library\n\nUse a Shared Library\n\nLeave a Shared Library\n\nGet help with Shared Library\n\nHow iCloud Shared Photo Library works\n\nWhen you contribute photos and videos to iCloud Shared Photo Library, they move out of your Personal Library and into the Shared Library. You can join one Shared Library, and you can choose what to share, or automatically share content straight from the camera.\n\nAll participants have equal permissions to add, edit, and delete content in the Shared Library, while the person who set up the Shared Library, the library creator, provides iCloud storage for all of the content. Everyone else gets access to the Shared Library content without it counting towards their iCloud storage.\n\nCreate a Shared Library\n\nTo set up a Shared Library, you need a device with iOS 16.1, iPadOS 16.1, or macOS Ventura or later with iCloud Photos turned on. If you're under 13, you can only join or create a Shared Library with members of your Family Sharing group.*\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad\n\nGo to Settings > Photos, then tap Shared Library.\n\nChoose up to five people to invite, or you can invite participants later.\n\nChoose past photos and videos that you want to move to your Shared Library, or choose to move photos later.\n\nFollow the onscreen steps to preview your Shared Library, confirm the content that you want to share, and invite additional participants.\n\nOn your Mac\n\nIn the Photos app, choose Photos > Settings, then click iCloud.\n\nMake sure that iCloud Photos is turned on. If not, select iCloud Photos.\n\nClick Shared Library, then click Get Started.\n\nFollow the onscreen instructions to invite participants and add photos and videos.\n\nJoin a Shared Library\n\nTo join a Shared Library, you need a device with iOS 16.1, iPadOS 16.1, or macOS Ventura or later with iCloud Photos turned on. If you're under 13, you can only join or create a Shared Library with members of your Family Sharing group.*\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad\n\nOpen the invitation from the library creator or go to Settings > Photos.\n\nTap Accept & Continue.\n\nFollow the onscreen steps to choose photos and videos you want to move to your Shared Library, or choose to move photos later.\n\nFollow the onscreen steps to preview your Shared Library content and confirm the content that you want to share.\n\nOn your Mac\n\nOpen the invitation from the library creator or go to Photos > Settings, and click View Invitation.\n\nClick Get Started, then follow the onscreen steps to choose photos and videos you want to move to your Shared Library, or choose to move photos later.\n\nFollow the onscreen steps to preview your Shared Library content and confirm the content that you want to share.\n\nUse Shared Library\n\nIn Settings on your iPhone or iPad, you can turn on automatic sharing to add photos straight from the camera to your Shared Library. In the Photos app, you can switch views between your Personal Library, the Shared Library, or both at the same time. You can also learn how to find photos shared by other participants, manage sharing suggestions, and more on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\n\nShare photos straight from the camera on your iPhone or iPad\n\nGo to Settings > Photos, then tap Shared Library. Tap Sharing from Camera and make sure it's turned on.\n\nTo have the Camera app add photos to your Shared Library automatically when you're near participants, choose Share Automatically.\n\nTo choose when to have the Camera app add photos to your Shared Library, choose Share Manually.\n\nTo automatically share photos taken at home to the Shared Library, choose Share When At Home.\n\nIn the Camera app, to send photos and videos straight to your Shared Library, make sure that the Shared Library button is turned on. To send photos and videos to your Personal Library, tap to turn it off.\n\nSwitch between your Personal Library and Shared Library on your iPhone or iPad\n\nOpen the Photos app.\n\nAt the top of the Albums or Library tabs, tap the button next to Select in the upper right.\n\nChoose Personal Library, Shared Library, or Both Libraries.\n\nIn Both Libraries or Shared Library view, photos that are in the Shared Library are badged with an icon. To turn this off, tap Shared Library Indicator.\n\nSwitch between your Personal Library and Shared Library on your Mac\n\nOpen the Photos app.\n\nAt the top, choose Personal Library, Shared Library, or Both Libraries.\n\nIn Both Libraries or Shared Library view, photos that are in the Shared Library are badged with an icon. To turn this off, choose View > Metadata > Show In Library.\n\nLeave a Shared Library\n\nIf you created an iCloud Shared Photo Library, you can remove a participant or delete the Shared Library at any time. After you delete the Shared Library, all participants receive a notification. If a participant has been in the Shared Library for more than seven days, they automatically receive everything from the Shared Library in their Personal Library. If they've been in the Shared Library for less than seven days, they receive only the photos and videos that they contributed.\n\nIf you're a participant, you can leave a Shared Library at any time. You can choose to receive a copy of everything from the Shared Library in your Personal Library, or just what you contributed.\n\nLearn how to leave a Shared Library\n\nGet help with Shared Library\n\nIf you use a device with an earlier version of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, or iCloud for Windows, you can't see content moved to the Shared Library. You can see your Shared Library on iCloud.com, or see it on a device that meets the minimum system requirements for Shared Library.\n\nIf the library creator runs out of iCloud storage, content can no longer be added to the Shared Library and changes such as edits, favorites, and metadata adjustments no longer sync. To get more storage and access to other premium features, learn how to upgrade to iCloud+.\n\nWhen a participant deletes a photo or video from the Shared Library, it moves to Recently Deleted. Only the contributor of that photo or video can delete it from Recently Deleted. Learn how to delete photos and videos on your iPhone or iPad or on your Mac."
