        "text": "Your photo must be a clear shot of your entire face horizontally centered in the photo. Profile shots or photos not in focus will not be accepted. Your photo must be taken against a plain white or off-white background. Your expression should be neutral with both eyes open and directly facing the camera. Photos with unusual expressions and squinting will not be accepted.\n\nYour head should be between 1 inch and 1-3/8 inches (between 25 and 35 mm) from the bottom of your chin to the top of your hair. If you are submitting a digital image, then your head should be between 50% and 69% of the image's total height from the top of the head, including the hair, to the bottom of the chin.\n\nEffective November 1, 2016, eyeglasses are no longer allowed in new visa photos, except in rare circumstances when eyeglasses cannot be removed for medical reasons; e.g., the applicant has recently had ocular surgery and the eyeglasses are necessary to protect the applicant's eyes. A medical statement signed by a medical professional/health practitioner must be provided in these cases. If the eyeglasses are accepted for medical reasons:\n\nThe frames of the eyeglasses must not cover the eye(s).\n\nThere must not be glare on eyeglasses that obscures the eye(s).\n\nThere must not be shadows or refraction from the eyeglasses that obscures the eye(s).\n\nNo, you cannot wear sunglasses or tinted glasses for your photo. If you are applying for a U.S. passport, and you need to wear your prescription glasses that have dark on tinted lenses for medical reasons then they may be worn in your photo. A medical certificate may be required to verify prescription eyewear. If you are applying for a U.S. visa, you may not wear any glasses with dark or tinted lenses for your photo.\n\nLay your baby on his or her back on a plain white or off-white sheet. This will ensure your baby's head is supported and provide a plain background for the photo. Make certain there are no shadows on your baby’s face, especially if you take a picture from above with the baby lying down. You can also cover a car seat with a plain white or off-white sheet and take a picture of your child in the car seat. This will also ensure your baby’s head is supported.\n\nIt is acceptable to use the red-eye reduction option on your digital camera when you are taking the photo. However, you cannot use any photo editing tool to digitally remove the red-eye from your photo. In general, you are not allowed to digitally enhance or alter the photo to change your appearance in any way.\n\nNew photos are only required if your appearance has significantly changed from what is in your photo. Growing a beard or coloring your hair would not constitute a significant change. If you can still be identified from the photo in your current passport or visa application, you do not need to apply for a new passport or submit a new photo for your visa application. However, you may have to apply for a new passport or submit a new photo for your visa application if you have:\n\nUndergone significant facial surgery or trauma\n\nAdded or removed numerous/large facial piercings or tattoos\n\nUndergone a significant amount of weight loss or gain\n\nObtained a new gender identity\n\nThe acceptance of your photo is at the discretion of the U.S. passport agency where you apply for a passport or U.S. embassy or consulate where you apply for a visa.\n\nThat means the photo upload failed. Therefore, you should submit one printed photo meeting our requirements, along with the online DS-160 confirmation page, to the U.S. embassy or consulate at which you plan to apply for your nonimmigrant visa. Please contact the U.S. embassy or consulate where you are applying for specific instructions on how to do this. If the confirmation page includes a photo of you, then the photo upload was successful and no separate photo is required."
