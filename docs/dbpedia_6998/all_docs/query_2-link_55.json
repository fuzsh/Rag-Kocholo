We’re looking for photos that highlight the day-to-day life of your organization’s patients, caretakers, staff and facilities.\n\nThe collection will be open for submissions from member hospitals on an ongoing basis. Additional guidelines include:\n\nThe photo collection is a benefit of membership.\n\nIndividual files should be no larger than 50MB.\n\nInclude photo credits in the submission form.\n\nThere is an option to submit stories that we may use to accompany the photo.\n\nContact us to learn more about the photo collection submission process.\n\nMade Possible By Your Children's Hospital\n\nSubmissions to the photo collection could also be featured in \"Made Possible,\" a brand campaign to promote the critical role of America’s children’s hospitals and their advocacy priorities in Washington, D.C. Photos selected for the \"Made Possible\" campaign would require patient information, details about the care they received at your hospital, and represent one of the following:\n\nAccess to care. Patients provided access to the care they need through Medicaid/insurance, funding or their proximity to the hospital location.\n\nSpecialized care. Patients with specialized healthcare needs and complex conditions.\n\nComprehensive care. Patients benefitting from holistic care, including primary care, mental health and programs that address social determinants of health."
