        "text": "The Beinecke Library has digitized more than a million images of collections material. We are very excited to announce that Yale University Library has launched a new digital collections platform for improved user experience. The new platform is now home to the majority of digitized images from Yale Library collections. The site is a living database, and new materials are added regularly. Please note that some Yale Library digital collections are not available on this site; more information on those additional collections can be found here.\n\nUse the search box below to explore digitized images from Yale Library collections. Watch this introductory video to learn more:\n\nThe vast majority of Beinecke Library’s digital collections are open to the public (some material must be restricted to the Yale network). Material may be covered by U.S. or international copy, publicity or privacy rights. For more information about image reuse, see about permissions and copyright.\n\nWhile the Beinecke Library’s digitized materials is large – and new material is added regularly – it represents only a fraction of total collections material on-site. Learn more about searching the overall collections here. All cataloged books, pamphlets, periodicals, broadsides, published materials, single manuscript volumes, and small archival collections are discoverable in Orbis. In addition, Orbis includes collection-level records for large archival collections. However, due to the complex nature of large archival collections, we recommend researchers interested in those archives also search Archives at Yale.\n\nPlease note that audiovisual material housed on the previous Beinecke digital library has been moved to a new dedicated platform here. You can search for digital and digitized sound and visual recordings there. Note: not all a/v collections material has been digitized. More information about ordering reproductions can be found here. You can begin with a simple keyword search below. Enjoy!"
