The WHO Photo Library is a unique visual record of the Organization's work, illustrating the challenges, developments, and achievements in public health from 1948 to the present day. Our photo collection is maintained through a continuous program of analogue conservation and preservation, in addition to digital metadata enhancement.

Images and descriptions created decades ago are reflective of their time but can be considered inappropriate today. They can provide important context demonstrating the long and difficult journey of public health but can also demonstrate biases and prejudices. We attempt to balance the preservation of this history with sensitivity to WHO's values. We aim to write accurate and respectful captions and correct factual inaccuracies.

WHO Photos may be used for scientific, educational or journalistic purposes to promote public health awareness and to further the aims and work of the World Health Organization, subject to the following terms and conditions:
