Gregg Semenza, M.D., Ph.D.

C. Michael Armstrong Professor of Genetic Medicine, Pediatrics, Oncology, Medicine, Radiation Oncology and Biological Chemistry

Director of the Vascular Program at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering

Dr. Semenza was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He shares the award with William G. Kaelin, Jr., M.D. of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Peter J. Ratcliffe of Oxford University. The Academy recognized him for his ground-breaking discovery in the laboratory of hypoxia inducible factor 1 or HIF-1, which helps cells cope with low oxygen levels. The discovery has far-reaching implications in understanding low oxygen health conditions such as coronary artery disease and tumor growth.

Carol Greider, Ph.D.

University Professor

Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics

Dr. Greider, one of the world’s pioneering researchers on the structure of chromosome ends known as telomeres, was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Her improbable discovery of telomerase – a remarkable enzyme that restores telomeres and protects them from damage – catalyzed an explosion of scientific studies which, to this day, probe connections between telomerase and telomeres to human cancer and diseases of aging.

Peter Agre, M.D.

Bloomberg Distinguished Professor

Director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute

Dr. Agre received the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of the aquaporin water channels. Referred to as the "plumbing system of cells," aquaporins facilitate the movement of water across cell membranes [rapid osmosis]. Aquaporins are responsible for generation all biological fluids - cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous humor, tears, sweat, saliva, and concentration of urine. Aquaporins are also involved in plant biology and infectious diseases.
