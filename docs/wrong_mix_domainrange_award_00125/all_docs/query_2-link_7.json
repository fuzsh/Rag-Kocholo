        "text": "Johannes Stark was born in 1874 in Bavaria, the son of a farmer, and received his PhD in physics from the University of Munich in 1897.\n\nIn 1907, when he was editor of a learned science journal, Stark invited the little-known Albert Einstein to write a review of relativity. This paper had a significant impact on the physics community. However, by 1913, Stark had turned vehemently against both quantum theory and relativity, denouncing them due to his antisemitic views."
