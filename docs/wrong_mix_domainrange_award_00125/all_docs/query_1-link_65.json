        "text": "John Eccles, PhD, Andrew Huxley and Alan Lloyd Hodgkin shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their fundamental work on the synapse. Eccles, an Australian neurophysiologist and philosopher, was a professor at the Feinberg School of Medicine from 1966-1968. He later worked with Bernard Katz on some of the experiments that elucidated the role of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter.\n\nRobert Furchgott, PhD ’40, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998, which he shared with Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad for “their discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signaling molecule.” Furchgott’s discoveries have helped scientists understand and find new treatments for cardiovascular diseases and other conditions ranging from immune disorders to memory loss, pulmonary disease and erectile dysfunction.\n\nFerid Murad, MD, PhD, Robert F. Furchgott and Louis J. Ignarro shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Murad's discoveries helped scientists understand and find new treatments for cardiovascular diseases and other conditions ranging from immune disorders to memory loss, pulmonary disease and erectile dysfunction. From 1988-1998, he was an adjunct faculty member in Pharmacology and Cell & Developmental Biology."
