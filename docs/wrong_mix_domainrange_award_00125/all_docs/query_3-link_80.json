This phenomenon is known as the Stark effect.\n\nJohannes Stark autograph letter signed, composed on 23 July 1920 to fellow Nobel Prize winning physicist Wilhelm Wien. Stark writes at length about politics within the German Physical Society, likely referring to the 1919-20 decision to publish “Zeitschrift fur Physik” in addition to the Annals, of which Wien was then Editor. Wien would become President of the Society later in 1920. Two page letter on bifolium stationery measures 5.5″ x 8.75″ as folded. Near fine condition with bold and legible handwriting. With full translation. Sold for $1,860."
