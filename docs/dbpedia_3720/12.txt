Who can apply?

Anyone can apply to the program. If you haven't already, we strongly suggest you try Rize out first to see if it's something that will be part of your workflow long-term.

What do I get if I am accepted?

You will receive a personal link to share with your audience along with a unique discount code that allows your audience to get 25% off of their first three months.

You'll additionally get a complimentary lifetime subscription to Rize and 3 additional lifetime subscriptions that you can give out to your friends or for giveaways.

How do commissions work?

For every customer that you refer, you will receive 20% of their recurring payments. This means that if your referred customer pays $15 every month, you will receive $3 every month.

If the same customer switches to an annual plan and pays $120 for the year, you will receive $24 for that payment. You will continue to receive these payments as long as they continue to be a customer.

Your earned commissions will be paid out on a monthly basis through our third-party portal.
