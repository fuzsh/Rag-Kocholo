        "text": "Picture this: standing in the middle of a store, staring at an expensive product and trying to decide if it’s worth splurging on. It can be hard to decide without knowing what others have said about it. That’s why customer testimonials are so important these days; they assure people that it’s a good choice and worth spending their hard-earned money on. But you can’t be easily convinced by a few words. That’s why video testimonials are so effective, but they’re more than meets the eye. It needs to be thoughtful, creative and relevant.\n\nSo, how do you make one and tick off all the right boxes for your campaign? Here’s a complete guide to help you get started.\n\nWhat Is a Video Testimonial?\n\nJust as the name suggests, a video testimonial is when somebody talks positively about your product or service on camera. It’s like the vocal version of client reviews but in a more cinematic setting.\n\nVideo testimonials present an opportunity to engage potential customers, build trust and show off your products and services in action.\n\nThese client testimonials may be shot in a studio or even just in someone’s living room. They can also be long-form or short, snappy clips. No matter the length or setting, a video testimonial is meant to be a real-life endorsement of your business.\n\nWhy Video Customer Testimonials Work\n\nIf they’re just the same as customer reviews, why bother going through the trouble of making a video? We encounter this question all the time. But there’s so much more to it than just an average client testimonial.\n\nHere’s why video client testimonials are worth the effort.\n\nIncreased Audience Reach Through SEO\n\nBelieve it or not, videos have been known to boost SEO by as much as 157%. When you include testimonials on a website, it’s more likely to appear in the search engine results than if you just had a text.\n\nSo when someone searches “best product X,” they may be able to see your video testimonial and make an informed decision faster.\n\nMore Engaging Than Text-Based Reviews\n\nHere’s the truth about people: We’re quite lazy when it comes to reading. Text-based client reviews can be very informative, but they lack the personal touch of a video.\n\nTestimonials on a website are more likely to grab people’s attention and keep them engaged while they learn about your product or service. Seeing an actual person talk about their experiences with it is much more convincing than just reading the words.\n\nHumanize Your Brand and Products\n\nBusinesses, services and products can’t afford to be seen just as mere entities. Customers want to feel connected with what they’re buying, and video customer testimonials provide that sense of familiarity.\n\nSeeing real people talk about their own experiences puts more emphasis on the human side of your business. It’s much easier for potential customers to relate when they can see and hear somebody talking about how great your product or service is rather than just reading it off a page.\n\nReal Faces Foster Trust Through Authenticity\n\nBusinesses have a trust gap, but websites with testimonials solve that. Seeing real people talk about your services or products is a great way to build trust with potential customers.\n\n“People trust video testimonials more than written reviews,” said Tim Clarke, Rize’s Senior Reputation Manager.\n\nHaving an actual person explain how your product or service positively impacted them is much more believable than just reading off what you want them to know. If a customer feels like an endorsement is genuine and sincere, then they’ll trust you more easily, boosting your lead conversion.\n\nCommon Challenges Faced When Creating Video Client Testimonials\n\nSo, testimonial video production actually brings value to your business. Great! Now, it’s time to make one, except it’s not that easy.\n\nFor starters, your video must be high-quality, well-produced and well-edited. This can be a difficult task, requiring motion design, sound and lighting expertise. If these elements are not done correctly, the end result can look unprofessional and unappealing, deterring potential customers from engaging with your business.\n\nAnother thing to consider is your customer’s willingness to participate. Not everyone is comfortable in front of a camera or knows how to communicate their experiences in a way that sounds appealing and genuine. Sometimes, it takes a little push – or, more likely, a lot of encouragement – to get your customer ready for their video shoot.\n\nOf course, you also need to consider the cost of testimonial video production. Professional equipment and skilled personnel can be expensive, especially if you want the video to look good and sound great. And although there are cheaper alternatives, they may not always produce the quality required for compelling testimonials for website pages.\n\nOf course, you can always use a reliable video testimonial service that offers industry-standard equipment and experienced production staff, which can help keep costs down. These services often come with additional benefits, such as editing and post-production assistance.\n\nTips and Strategies When Producing Your Video Testimonial\n\nNow, how do you overcome these challenges and produce video customer testimonials that you can be proud of? While it’s hard, it’s definitely not impossible. Here are some pointers for your first effective video testimonials.\n\nFind the Perfect Customer\n\nThis is a no-brainer – you want someone who found success with your product or service to do the talking. The best candidates are people who thoroughly understand the value of what you offer and can articulate it in a way that resonates with potential customers.\n\nYou should only “ask for a small customer list” that meets your success criteria, said Clarke. If you need help finding the right person, consider running a small survey or focus group to identify the ideal customer.\n\nTestimonial video services also help with this process by providing options for people to interview.\n\nPrepare, but Don’t Script!\n\nAs the old saying goes, “Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.” Once you have the right customer for your video, it’s time to get to work.\n\nSet aside time to brief them on topics and stories they should share. It’s vital that your customers feel comfortable enough when shooting their videos so they can express their genuine experiences without sounding rehearsed.\n\nA competent video testimonial service crafts a high-quality message, experienced with storytelling practices and techniques. They also track reviews and sentiments that you could include in the video so you can capture the essence of customer experiences.\n\nThis allows you to keep your message simple and focused while captivating your audience with clear and concise stories. The result? You’ll find higher engagement, increased sales opportunities and gain invaluable insight into what works best for your audience.\n\nKeep It Short\n\nSure, it’s a video, but it isn’t a movie.\n\nNobody wants to scroll through websites with testimonials that last as long as a Lord of the Rings marathon. The best videos are those that capture a customer’s story in the shortest amount of time while still conveying your message.\n\nKeep it under two minutes, and try to focus on one particular success story or experience. Doing this ensures your video gets watched all the way through and is more likely to resonate with potential customers.\n\nTestimonial video services specialize in creating videos that are short but still effective enough to drive conversions. Consider using a service if you’re unsure about the video-making process.\n\nUse High-Quality Equipment\n\nAnother no-brainer here – use the best equipment you can afford.\n\nChris Clements, Thrive’s In-House Videographer and Photographer, recommends good audio and lighting when shooting your video. This equipment creates a more professional and authentic atmosphere, helping establish a personal connection with your viewers.\n\nAfter all, testimonials on a website and across your channels have to look and sound professional if they are to be effective, and this requires using high-quality cameras, microphones and lighting kits.\n\nInvesting in proper gear ensures your video looks great on any device and delivers a clear message without compromising its quality.\n\nDecide on the Style and Format and Follow It\n\nRemember when we said to keep it short? Well, you have to decide how you’re going to stretch that two minutes. Will your video be an interview with the customer or a series of shots featuring them and their experiences with your product or service?\n\nThe style and format of your video should suit the story you want to tell and match the look and feel of other videos you’ve produced in the past. This helps create a cohesive image for your business across all platforms.\n\nDon’t Forget About the Data\n\nIf you have it, then brag about it. Quality video testimonials should come with supporting data that provides a more complete picture of the customer’s success. This could be anything from an increase in revenue to improved lead conversion.\n\nIncluding this information ensures that viewers get a complete understanding of what your product or service does and makes it clear that it’s not just another pitch.\n\nAdd Captions and Transcripts\n\nNetflix isn’t the only one that loves captions and transcripts – they can also be incredibly useful for video testimonials.\n\nThis is especially true if people watch your videos on social media or other mobile devices, as audio might not always be available. Providing viewers with captioned versions of your videos and a full transcript ensures everyone gets access to the same great content regardless of their circumstances.\n\nHow To Ask for Testimonials\n\nEvery great client testimonial video starts with a simple request. But don’t just fire off an email without any thought – learn how to ask for testimonials the right way.\n\nOutline what the testimonial is about, what they need to say, or even a rough script they can use. This will make it easier for them to know what’s expected of them and help guide the conversation.\n\nProvide an incentive. A discount, gift card, or even a thank you note. Doing this shows you care about their time and value their opinion.\n\nMake it easy for them to leave a customer testimonial. Everything should be accessible online, and you should provide a secure way for them to upload their video file.\n\nGive them the right amount of control. That means allowing them to review and approve edited versions before they are released. This encourages trust in your brand and lets customers know their message is accurately shared.\n\nVideo testimonial services can accelerate your review generation by automating review requests. For example, Rize’s automated review request service prompts customers to either leave reviews on Google, Facebook or even a video right after they make a purchase.\n\nUsing Your Video Testimonials for Review Generation\n\nEverything’s good to go – now it’s time to generate reviews. Your video testimonials are a powerful tool for inspiring others to speak up, and there are some ways to maximize their potential.\n\nPut Them All Over Your Website\n\nFor starters, make sure you display your video testimonials on your website. You can also consider adding them on other pages related to products and services, such as product reviews or a customer support page.\n\nBe strategic about where you place them – make sure as many people see them as possible, and add calls to action to encourage more reviews.\n\nThrive’s homepage is the perfect example of leveraging video testimonials the right way. From the get-go, you’ll see their most successful client results, complete with a customer quote.\n\nSoftware and widgets help display video testimonials easier across your website.\n\nShare Video Testimonials on Social Media\n\nYour social media is like a giant lead conversion and review generation machine waiting to be switched on. Post your video testimonials with captions and transcripts across your platforms, ensuring they stand out from the regular content.\n\nInclude a link that takes people to an online form or page where they can leave a review – this way; you make it easy for them to do so without leaving social media.\n\nYou should also consider repurposing video testimonials into shorter snippets and stories for Instagram and TikTok, as these are becoming increasingly popular. Short-form content like this is great for engagement and can help you reach a wider audience.\n\nUse Them in Your Emails\n\nIt’s not the end of an email sequence when a customer makes a purchase – you can use your video testimonials to keep them engaged.\n\nSend out emails with behind-the-scenes footage or clips of customers sharing their experiences. Keep the content fun, lighthearted and entertaining – this will give them more reasons to return for more purchases.\n\nInclude calls-to-action (CTAs) in the emails, too, so that people know where to go if they want to leave a review.\n\nUse Videos and Generate Reviews With Rize\n\nCreating great customer testimonials is the first step in a successful review generation process. Fortunately, you now have all the tools to do it correctly!\n\nBut what if there was an easier way?\n\nRize helps you generate reviews even faster for your business.
