        "text": "Hey everyone! Walk with me as I share a quick snapshot of my journey into the tech world. I went from someone who once had zero knowledge of cybersecurity and product design skills to where I am now‚Äîit's been one heck of a ride! In cybersecurity, I've gone from clueless to kicking butt with Wireshark and other cybersecurity tools. It's just amazing what a little determination and a whole lot of learning can do! And when it comes to designing user experiences and interfaces, let's just say I've become quite the Picasso of pixels! Crafting engaging products that users love. That's my new jam! Reflecting on my growth, I'm seriously proud of how far I've come. Every challenge has been an opportunity to level up, and I've embraced them all with open arms. So, here's to the journey, the challenges, and the victories‚Äîbig and small. I'm ready to keep pushing the boundaries, learning new skills, and making my mark in the tech world! What about you? Share your own journey in the comments below! Let's inspire each other to reach new heights. #TechJourney #NeverStopLearning\n\nI saw that my LinkedIn stats were compromised tonight, so my visibility was caped. I was not proud of it, but I persisted in posting and moving forward. #Resilience Most of my content has been, therefore, flying under the radar. I realized that in starting some Data Analysis to optimize my content, assisted by ChatGPT from OpenAI. But it'll wait a little because I cannot pass the robot detection test for now, as shown in the following picture. Good luck with that one. I also have a motion design line of content pending because my Figma prototype is magically not working correctly, and I am already working on solving it with their agreeable support team. I now realize the hit my work reputation must have taken besides having my activities caped or blocked. With the constant high quality of work I consistently put out of there, I have been interpreting that I was suffering from intersectional discrimination. But nope, it's also heavily because of this sick cyber-criminal who I suspect also modifies tracks I listen to often on my YouTube so that I hear some extra \"wow\" or \"yeah.\" ü§¶üèΩ TIDAL, you've been attacked in the same manner. I used your platform to do a comparative analysis of one track. Fortunately, those voices FX line can't fly under the radar when I listen to deep techno. üòè So here's one open feedback for all tech companies to raise awareness. If you catch the ID of this criminal while leading some forensics work to investigate those vulnerabilities, please make sure that I get to know it so that I can file my lawsuit against them to their name. It'll help! üåÖ #CyberSecurity #CyberWarfare #CyberCriminality #OpenFeedbackCulture #Agile #Growth\n\nHey there LinkedIn fam üëã , I have been thinking for a long time to share the content I learn and come across everyday on this platform. Finally, I will start posting about new technologies and tools that I come across. The content and posts will be aligned and centered to Cybersecurity field and I am currently in that field but will also share content about other domains and technologies. Hoping to connect with more people and learn from other people as well. Also I will be more active on LinkedIn so hoping to get more and more responses about the goods and bads of my posts. Happy learning <3 #technology #personaldevelopment #careers #future #programing\n\nThey say nothing in this life is free. But that‚Äôs not quite true.
