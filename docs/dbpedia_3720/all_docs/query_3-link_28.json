        "text": "Is Anime better or Manga? I don’t know what you are thinking but to me, both are equally good in their own ways. In this blog I’ll be telling you the reason to why I think so.\n\nFirst I’d like to tell you what exactly manga and anime are. Yes of course, they both are the fine artworks done by the Japanese people. Manga is just like your normal comic books where in the writer writes his stories and gets them published. I said ‘like’ because that’s just to give you a brief idea about what a manga really is, but if you’ve ever read one then you’d know that even your manga will differ from your normal comic books. On the other hand, Anime is the Japanese animation that is loved by many people in and out the country. Only when a manga is completed and is famous, it is turned into an Anime. In other words, if a certain manga gets their fair share of fame and money then congratulations, that manga will definitely get adopted into an anime!\n\nAnime fans have long joked about how “the manga was better” when talking about anime. It’s become such a well known meme that it has transcended far beyond the realm of anime, and that’s only scratching the surface. But as is the case with many jokes, there’s often a spec of truth at the center of it. Most of modern anime is based on manga, including massive industry shakers like Dragonball Z, Naruto and One Piece. There are always a few animes that aren’t derived from a separate source material.\n\nThe only problem of a manga being adopted into an anime is about how different the two are. It’s not easy to transform a non-visual story into a visual experience, after all. Meanwhile, manga doesn’t have nearly as many transitional pains when being converted into anime. Both formats are linear, visual, and often have episodic experiences. In some cases, you do have anime that drastically cut or change things from the manga. But in many cases, an anime series can hit the major story beats of a manga without butchering it. It’s because adaptations are so common, that anime industry generally has experience in executing them well. There are notable exceptions, of course. But even mediocre adaptations still find niche audiences and expose new fans to the original story.\n\nIf anyone asked me what was better, anime or manga, I’d choose them based on the genres. Like for example – if it was a romance genre, I’d prefer reading the manga more than watching the anime because it helps you know the characters’ emotions better and you also get a good view of their expressions. If it was an action or supernatural genre, where in there are a lot of fight scenes, I’d prefer watching the anime because that way you can enjoy the fight scenes in a better way. Besides all that, there is also the fact on when and where you are. Like if you are in a class, then reading a manga would be more preferable than watching an anime. Plus above all, the manga will always give you the latest updates way before the anime does! So if you’re curious about what’s going to happen next in an anime then you can always go ahead and read the manga!\n\nThere’s also another fact that doesn’t really sit well with me, and that’s when they suddenly stop producing the anime midway! I’ve experienced this with a lot of anime that I came across. They would end the anime in a very convincing way but then if you ever check the manga, there’s always more to it. Furthermore, manga’s limited frames of animation allow for more deliberate set pieces and character expressions. Whereas a single scene in an anime could contain hundreds of unique frames. Manga lets the reader linger on specific illustrations for much longer. This can really drive the nightmare fuel in horror stories, but it’s also effective for dramatic clashes of steel in fight scenes or the kiss moments in romances. And of course, readers can also enjoy manga on the go without an electronic device or an internet connection.\n\nIt is due to this reason that I developed the habit of reading manga over watching anime, but this still doesn’t mean that I stopped watching Anime. Sometimes reading a manga may get boring but watching Anime never does! This is because anime has a lot to give us – the voices, the music, the colour , the graphics and what not. Because anime contains so many frames of animation, it can bring clarity to otherwise muddy moments in manga. Fight scenes in particular can be hard to follow in manga, but anime lays out every second of action for the viewer to enjoy. This also allows for subtle, yet nuanced moments that might be difficult in manga, such as the way characters hold hands or a character’s stride when they run. Furthermore, even if an anime departs from an author’s original intent, that may not always be a bad thing. Anime also has the benefit of being enjoyable in a community setting. While it’s possible to have a manga party with all your friends, it is easy for everyone to share a story by watching it together.\n\nSo there may be differences between the two, they both have their pros and cons but that doesn’t mean that one is better than the other. Anime and Manga are both equally good but if you ever plan to start with them then I’d suggest you to watch the Anime first.\n\nDo like, subscribe and tell us what you think about Anime and Manga in the comments below.\n\nThank you and Goodbye until my next blog!\n\nHey Everyone! Welcome back to my blog. As the topic suggests, today I will be introducing you and telling you about Anime! So here we start.\n\nWhat is Anime?\n\nIn Japan, the word anime is used to refer to all animation. However, outside Japan, it has become a term for animation from Japan. So basically, anime is Japanese Animation.\n\nFor decades, anime was produced by and for Japan as a local product, with a distinct look and feel to not just the artwork but the storytelling, the themes, and the concepts too. Over the last forty years, it has become an international phenomenon, attracting millions of fans and being translated into many languages.\n\nA whole generation of viewers in the West has grown up with it and are now passing it on to their children. You may think that you are one of those few people who has never seen anime but you are wrong. Everyone has seen at least one anime during their childhood or maybe even now when you’re with your smaller siblings. Think I’m still wrong? Then let me explain to you, why I said that you definitely must have seen anime at least once. Do you remember watching Bayblade, Dragon Ball Z , Digimon, Naruto, Doraemon or Shinchan as a child? Of not these, then I’m sure you’ve at least watch Pokemon. Ever wondered why were they so different than the other cartoons? All these what I just mentioned above are not your normal cartoons, they’re all anime.\n\nDuring my childhood, I was always the curious kid (I am still the curious one!) I just had one channel that I liked on TV and that was Animax. I used to find all the other cartoons boring but when it came to animax , I would be happily watch that channel. My favourite anime was Naruto and that time I had no idea what anime was. I used to call Naruto also a cartoon and often wondered why it was so different from the other cartoons. All my doubts got cleared when I was old enough to get access to the internet. It was then, when I learned about anime and knew the clear difference between cartoon and anime.\n\nWhat’s so special about Anime!?\n\nWhen such a question is asked to me, my answer sums up in just two words “It’s different.” Unlike the normal cartoons, anime is just different. These differences show up in many ways including the artwork, storytelling, the material and even cultural nuances exhibited by the characters.\n\nAnime art styles have a really wide range. Even the shows with the most basic artwork can still be visually striking. Anime has this way of making everything look fresh and beautiful. It also has almost all the genres present. You just need to know what’s your favourite genre, then go ahead and pick up an anime of that genre! Though the best anime, no matter what their length is, will demand great emotional involvement from the viewer.\n\nAnime isn’t only about creating fictional stories and producing them, it also shows the viewers an intimate look in Japan’s history, culture and language. It’s because of anime only, that I dreamt of going to Japan and will keep on researching about the country.\n\nIf you ever plan to start watching anime, then here is a list that I would recommend you to start your anime adventure with – Naruto, Fairytail, Tokyo Ghoul, Noragami, Your lie in April, Kaichu wa maid sama!(Kindly note – your anime starter pack may vary due to the genres you prefer watching)\n\nI would also like to point out one thing. Anime is not for kids only. Since anime has such a broad range of genre, it’s possible to find anime aimed for just about every age group. There is anime available specifically for the younger viewers, teenage audiences and even for the mature audiences. So one should always be careful of what anime the younger generation is watching because that may affect them mentally or emotionally.\n\nDo like, Subscribe and tells your views about Anime in the comments below.\n\nThank you and Goodbye until my next Blog!\n\nWhether it’s your first or the fifth time visiting Tokyo, Akihabara is a must visit area located in central Tokyo. There are plenty of things to do in Akihabara to keep you entertained. Just take a stroll along Akihabara’s main street, Chuo Dori, and you’ll easily see why Akihabara is nicknamed “Electric Town” and is also known for being the hub for the Otaku culture when you lay your eyes on all the multi-level electronic stores and the various anime goodies available there.\n\nOtaku is a Japanese term that describes someone who is passionate, or even obsessed, with some aspect of pop culture. Akihabara is home to countless stores that specialize in anime and hobby goods. You can expect to find plenty of figurine and characters goods as well as supplies to supplement all sorts of hobbies and interests.\n\nAs I had mentioned before, in my previous blog, my favourite place was Akihabara mainly because of this. I would consider myself an otaku as I do love anime a lot and this place was literally like heaven to me. In my whole two weeks trip in Japan, I visited this place at least five times and each time I went there, it felt like a new experience to me. I was so in love with this place that I had literally memorized the whole metro way from my hotel to akihabara.\n\nThe nickname Electric city that’s given to Akihabara is most probably because of the large amount of shops in the area that sell electronic goods. So if anyone is like me, who likes to keep up with the latest technology and check out new gadgets then you and Akihabara were meant to be.\n\nWhenever I used to read facts about how akihabara portrays anime and all, I used to take it as a lie and think that it was impossible for it to be like that. But no, they were my thoughts that were false. The building were actually covered with wallpapers of the latest anime, the mega screens played trailers of the upcoming anime movies and series, the streets, the shops, everywhere you go , you could hear anime songs and find various anime goodies. So if you’re an anime fan and if you ever come to Tokyo then this is definitely a must visit place for you, I’m sure all the anime fans out there will definitely love this place!\n\nAnother good thing about Akihabara is the various cafes and the food. They literally have the creative hand for everything. They even modify the smallest food item into something fun. I remember getting a taiyaki which is a simple fish shaped cake filled with custard in the shape of the infamous pokemon Magikarp! That was really a lot of effort out in for a simple quick snack. I had also visited a cat cafe along with my friend just because we love cats and oh my! The cafe was something we never imagined! The cats over there were well trained, friendly and really adorable!\n\nAkihabara is also famous for its SEGA arcade buildings. You may get addicted if you visit those buildings but it’s worth a try. They also have a lot of Gachapon machines which are basically vending machines giving us random toys in capsules. They are quite a phenomenon in Japan and are popular across all ages. Each machine is different, choose one that catches your eye and good luck!\n\nDo like, Subscribe and if you have anything else to say about Akihabara then do comment below.\n\nThank you and Goodbye until my next blog!\n\nJapan is a country, I wanted to visit since a long time. With incredible mountain scenery, one of the world’s most chaotic & quirky cities (Tokyo), a long history of culture & tradition, and of course incredible cuisine with authentic sushi to offer, everywhere you go.\n\nGoing to Japan was my dream since childhood. Everything about that country had me mesmerized. This dream of mine did turn into reality when I started going to College as I’m a first year student, I was given the opportunity to take part for a Student Exchange Programme to Japan for a complete two weeks time. Although, we had to pay for our own travel, the hotel we stayed in, the food and everything else was taken care by the college authorities. This was an opportunity I couldn’t miss, so I applied for if as soon as the forms were out and I was lucky enough to get selected with a few other students for this trip.\n\nAfter all the form filling process, bag packing and travelling, the day finally arrived when I stepped foot in Japan. Our trip started in Tokyo as it is the main gateway to Japan and is also a great city to spend a few days discovering the various attractions there. From the hustle and bustle of Shibuya and Shinjuku, over to the quiet peace and serenity of Japan’s public parks, and all the way through to Tokyo’s gaming and anime district Akihabara, I literally felt blessed as I walked and travelled the places by the metro around those areas in Tokyo.\n\nThe places seemed exactly how the internet portrayed them, beautiful and unique. If you ever decide to go there then you should make sure that the trip is of more than a week because there are too many things to explore and see in the city itself. The tourist hot spots like the Mieji Shrine, Sensō-ji temple, Ueno Park for remarkable cherry blossom viewing in Spring, Ueno Zoo, Harajuku for young fashion, nearby Omotesando for grown-up fashion, Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree for impressive views at sunset are the must visit places and if you have more time, day trips to Tokyo Disneyland, Disney Sea, or nearby Mt. Fuji will just add up the fun.\n\nMy trip to Japan was during the month of November, so because of that we missed the cherry blossom season but going there in Novemberis not bad either. In November, the Christmas season starts in Japan. The places are beautifully decorated, well lit up and it actually puts you into the Christmas spirit.\n\nEven the people there are really nice, cheerful and friendly. They will literally go out of their way, just to help you. I still remember this one incident where a friend of mine had lost her mobile. As we didn’t knew Japanese, we took help of a translator and asked a metro security guard for help. He didn’t know how to communicate with us properly but he understood that we were in search for the mobile so he called up many places to search for and then with the help of a map he showed us the exact location of the lost mobile and when we went there, we were suprised to know that someone had found it and reported it to the lost and found stations instead of taking it for themselves. We were really grateful for receiving the mobile back and the security guard looked really happy that he could help us. For me, the Japanese people were the best people I’ve ever met.\n\nFrom my whole trip, I do agree that all the places were unique in their own ways but according to me, the best place was Akihabara as it was the centre of Anime, and as I’m an Anime fan, this was my favourite place. We tried a lot of the dishes there which were really delicious. As my trip was only for two weeks, these were the only places I could visit. But if I’m ever given a second chance I’d definitely like to go back there and explore more of Japan.\n\nSo friends, If you ever plan to go to Japan, then do visit these places as they are totally worth the time.\n\nDo like and Subscribe.
