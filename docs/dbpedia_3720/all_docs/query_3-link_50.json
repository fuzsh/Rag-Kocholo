        "text": "Who can apply?\n\nAnyone can apply to the program. If you haven't already, we strongly suggest you try Rize out first to see if it's something that will be part of your workflow long-term.\n\nWhat do I get if I am accepted?\n\nYou will receive a personal link to share with your audience along with a unique discount code that allows your audience to get 25% off of their first three months.\n\nYou'll additionally get a complimentary lifetime subscription to Rize and 3 additional lifetime subscriptions that you can give out to your friends or for giveaways.\n\nHow do commissions work?\n\nFor every customer that you refer, you will receive 20% of their recurring payments. This means that if your referred customer pays $15 every month, you will receive $3 every month.\n\nIf the same customer switches to an annual plan and pays $120 for the year, you will receive $24 for that payment. You will continue to receive these payments as long as they continue to be a customer.\n\nYour earned commissions will be paid out on a monthly basis through our third-party portal.\n\nWho is building Rize?\n\nRize was created by Will Goto and Macgill Davis. Together, they previously cofounded and ran a VC-backed startup for 3 years with over $3.1 million in funding.\n\nWill has a background in front-end software engineering and design with work experience at Twitter, Periscope, and numerous early stage startups.\n\nMacgill focuses primarily on back-end software engineering with work experience at Twitter and Peer. Previously, he cofounded and sold a company called GuideHire in Boston.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish?\n\nWe feel a very strong personal connection to this project. The goal of continuously improving ourselves through quantifiable metrics and self-reflection is something that aligns deeply with our core values. We really hope to work on Rize for the long-term."
