        "text": "Telluride Bluegrass Festival 2016\n\nFestival Experience Archive\n\nfor The Lot Scene by Parker\n\nSaturday Highlights\n\nTim O’Brien Band\n\nSo, it was Saturday and Telluride was hopping. I mean, the energy was threatening to jump off the charts, everyone seemed so excited and so into things. It was as if the entirety of us gathered there for the bluegrass hit our festival strides all at once in a delightful festy singularity. And it was this very energy I was tapping into when Tim O’Brien and band took the stage. I am a big fan of Tim and his music — there is something special about the man and what he brings to the table that really kind of defies description. As traditional as one can get on one hand and as whack ado and progressive on the other, you are always in for a wholly satisfying round of music when it comes to Tim. Admittedly, this was my first time seeing him with his band so I was pretty pumped. They kicked things off keeping busy with a bit of “Working” for us, that anthem to all the hard working souls out there toiling away at myriad dirty and tough jobs the world over. “Anybody working is a friend of mine…” So, that’s what it takes to be Tim’s friend, eh? Work? Got it. Loved the overall groove to this one, a nice forward motion with a super catchy beat. What a great way to get things going for this Tim O’Brien Band set! The supremely mirthful and enjoyable “Pompadour” was up next in line, the witty tongue-in-cheek lyrics spurring countless smiles in the audience. The song is as weird as it is wonderful, this homage to that oh-so-recognizable hairdo, the pompadour. Replete with yodeling from Tim, “Pompadour” proved to be an instant crowd pleaser. This song being a perfect example of the fact that you never know just what you are going to get from Mr. O’Brien and company. This happened to be Tim’s 40th Telluride Bluegrass appearance and experience and he certainly brought all that to bear and more during his set. And from the look of things, he was absolutely grateful to be back once more doing it all over again. He dedicated the next song, “Family History”, to his Telluride family. What a nice fella, right? Exactly. A song filled with wisdom about how to navigate the trials and tribulations of a past assorted with family, it certainly wasn’t short on great music. Some supremely fine electric guitar work going on in this one, some really, really nice fills. Nothing like keeping your grass funky, right? And then, just like that, the whole show jibes back towards the traditional with “My Baby Don’t Love Me Anymore”. We’d taken a walk down to the river to get a different angle on the afternoon’s music, the sound perfect to our ears from the stage over yonder. We joined the throng of playful river-goers with their tubes and libations and dogs and children and smiles and laughter and rode out a couple of songs from that vantage. There are so many different facets to Telluride and to the Telluride Bluegrass experience and the river culture certainly is an important one. So much joy and mirth and merriment takes place along the banks of (and in, of course) the San Miguel River that runs through town. It is a great energy to tap into and one that is immensely popular. Then it was back to humor in the form of “I Gotta Move”, a song whose tale of moving woes and breakups contains many nuggets of truth for all, but all wrapped in a more light-hearted feeling musical framework. Some lovely keyboard work from the piano player in “I Gotta Move”, again keeping our grass a bit funky. As with all Tim O’Brien songs, once this one had finished you couldn’t help but feeling happily satisfied. Playing more selections from his new album, Pompadour, we got the intense and slightly brooding “Whatever Happened to Me” next in the set. This song had a dirtier, grit-rock sound and feeling to it, the perfect accompaniment to the introspective lyrics. Of note, the guitarist threw down a particularly lovely solo at one point that served as a fitting counterpoint to Tim’s lead. This one was certainly a thought-provoking number. Bravo, Tim. Can’ wait to pick up his new album (which I will probably download as soon as I am done writing this review). A little later on in the show, the band delivered a mighty fine Tim O’Brien version of “Boat Up The River”. This one was a super fun musical ride…I really got into the entire feeling of the song. It rocked along to this hybrid string band instrumentation in fine fashion, proving a great dancing song if the crowd’s movements were any indication. Always love hearing Tim play banjo, too, even though he is modest about his abilities there. Unnecessarily so, in my opinion. And then he picked up the bouzouki for the next number, an instrument near and dear to my heart. It has such a great tone…like a giant mandolin and a mellow guitar all at once. I do so love the timbre of that instrument, especially in the hands of a master like O’Brien. And, playing his ‘zouk he sang us a song about an Italian gentleman from his youth who sold produce from a truck. And this song freakin’ rocks! So upbeat and happy and lively — it really has all you could want from a song that feels like joy encapsulated in a musical shell. \"Megna's\" has been in my head ever since hearing it at Telluride. I’d never heard this one before and I cannot wait to hear it again. All you want to do is sing along to all the fruit and vegetable lyrics. And dance. And sing some more. Still later on in the set we got another fantastic selection called “Lover’s Rise”, this one having a bit of a cowboy feeling to it. Tim, on banjo once again, nailed down the lead vocals with aplomb, all of us just loving the sound of his voice. Some really lovely vocal harmonies in this one as well, serving to make it all the lovelier. Tim and band finished up their show with an encore dedicated to all those who have gone before, a rousing version of “Moses” with its chorus of “I might be gone in some lonesome graveyard”. A nice, big closer, but I’m not quite done with Mr. O’Brien and band just yet. I saved my favorite bit of their show until the last: their cover of James Brown’s “Get Up Offa That Thing”. This. Is. Amazing. And we nabbed it on video for you, too!! Please, please enjoy this wonderful bit of music, funkgrass-style:\n\nNot too shabby, eh, friends? Precisely. “Sister Golden Hair”, that mighty rock staple by America, was up next, lead vocals care of Mr. Jolliff. I happen to love this song already and the Yonder version has quickly grown on me. Then again, I am also a big fan of grassed up versions of classic rock. Dave Johnston had a big, bad solo on the banjo a couple of minutes into things which was answered by Allie’s own blistering fiddle work. They debuted a brand new song that Adam Aijala and Ben Kaufmann had just written which was, as of that performance, unnamed. A mellow and heartfelt Adam-led piece, this one seemed illustrative of the new direction the band is going in. Very pretty ensemble work happening in this song — looking forward to hearing it again. Ronnie McCoury and Sam Bush joined the band for the next song, “Rambler’s Anthem”, a Kaufmann lead. Adam’s early guitar solo was just white hot. That man is a serious guitar machine. Not to mention all that friendly star power on stage with the band. Like Sammy Bush and his phenomenal mando solo, which elicited a great roar from the crowd. And Ronnie? His monster contribution to the song? And Jake? How much mando can one person take? So groovy, so nasty…what a breakdown between those three mandolin demigods! And, as the song hurtled onwards, Ben even busted out a huge bass solo for us, rocking that instrument of his like a champ. Then there was the giant, crazy jam at the end that proceeded to melt a bunch of afternoon faces. Why not? Next up the massively talented Miss Allie Kral sweetly sang us the lyrics of “Son of Preacher Man” as if we were all hearing them for the first time. I love that they have upped her singing rep in band — her voice brings such lovely versatility to the overall framework of the group. Yet another excellent grass version of a familiar favorite with tons of musical fills to send home that very bluegrass in the rendition. Guitar, fiddle, banjo, mando, you name it. They were all there in spades. Later on in the set Jason Carter and Jerry Douglas appeared in order to rock out on fiddle and dobro, respectively, for “Black Sheep”, another standard of the YMSB catalogue. This must’ve been the best version of this song I’ve ever heard!! The band sounded great and really let their guests shine. Jerry on dobro was divine, pure and simple. Jason on fiddle? Do we even need to ask? Just amazing. As always. They really helped to transform this one into something special for Telluride. Bravi! They finished off their set with a rocketing “Traffic Jam”, with lots and lots of notes coming at the crowd in rapid succession. Like those innumerable mandolin notes from Jake. Heavens to Mercatroid!! Allie and Adam, they both elicited an insane amount of notage, too. Jerry and Jason had plenty of chances to shred as well. Such good music and so much of it…right up until the end!! The encore was an instrumental whose name I am unfamiliar with, however, I can tell you it was unbridled musical excellence all around. Fast, precise, fun, this one ricocheted off the valley walls around us in concert with the nature abounding and bringing us all the way along to the inevitable whiz bang ending. Bam!! What a show!! What a great performance by the band and by their friends and guests!! What a way to spend a Telluride afternoon, no??? Many thanks to all of Yonder for such a fantastic set!!\n\nSam Bush Band\n\nAll hail the King!!! The King of Telluride!!! Yup, you guessed it. Time for some Sam Bush Band all up in your business. And this band doesn’t play around; they play supremely wonderful bluegrass music instead. And they get serious about it, too. Sam and the fellas kicked things off with “Play by Your Own Rules” a favorite standard SBB of mine. Songs like this one really epitomize the Sam Bush Band corner of the bluegrass universe, the perfect example of the sound and stature of this music. Nasty little solos from Scott Vestal on banjo all over the song…that man is a banjo beast. Plain and simple. I have nothing but crazy respect for Mr. Vestal and that 5-string of his. Damn. Don’t you worry, there will be plenty more about Scott Vestal as things continue. Next up was “Transcendental Meditation Blues”, yet another Sammy classic. Stephen Mougin sounded excellent on the vocal harmonies backing up Sam on lead. Solos fell to many of the gents in the band, Vestal having a nice and lengthy banjo solo that was punctuated by Sam’s mandolin. So precise and so well polished, this music. Such a pleasure to listen to! Then it was time to get ourselves all aboard so we could be “Riding That Bluegrass Train” with Sammy and band. Sam and Steve had this really nice moment of interplay between them which Scott joined to make this triumvirate of sweet grass sound that was just about perfect. From guitar to mando to banjo and back again and again and again. So good!! Let there be no doubts that this group puts on one helluva show wherever they go. And they were just demolishing things at Telluride. Completely. Jumping off the “Train” we found ourselves smack dab in the middle of some “Working Man’s Blues”, Sammy on the lead. Mougin’s guitar solo on this Merle Haggard classic was nothing short of exquisite, seeing as how that man is a badass robot programmed for “shredding” when it comes to guitar. About like Scott on that banjo — what can’t that man play? And play so very incredibly well? I’d wager nothing, myself. And this song was no exception to the rule for him as he tore up a solo opportunity summarily. And then both of those men did it again!! How much good music can one song hold? Well, how about a huge bass solo from Todd Parks to sweeten the deal? Why the hell not, right? I was just adoring this set! Sam is no stranger to positive messages, it’s true. So the inclusion of the next song, “Everything Is Possible”, in the set came as no huge surprise although the song was new to me. Here is how it went down in sound and color for you, friends:\n\nSee, now don’t you feel that much better? What a pick-me-up! A little later down the set we got a nice Stephen Mougin vocal lead on “Hard Hearted”, that good ol’ one about the sad realities of love sometimes. Big mando intro from Sam was the perfect lead in for Mougin’s vocals…Sam providing harmonies as well. They took this one at a quick clip, not that they don't have the chops for fast pickin’ — Mougin certainly proved that point time and again. Later still in the set was a massive crowd pleaser: “Great Balls of Fire”. We were all ready for a little grassed-up Jerry Lee Lewis that’s for sure and they delivered in fine fashion. Hard drivin’ this one, lots of notes played very quickly coming from mando, banjo, and guitar alike. Not to mention that rocksteady beat from Chris Brown. They certainly made a crazy fun ride out of this one! Farther on down this amazing set came a requested Jeff Black song, “Same Ol’ River”, which is a big favorite of mine and was of the rest of the crowd, too. Always nice to get an old friend in a setlist. Especially at a Sam Bush Band show. A gorgeous solo from Mougin on guitar hallmarked the early minutes of the song. I really appreciate the length of the average SBB solo — you never leave feeling unsatisfied from a musical standpoint. Damn, it really was a good solo, too. Bravo, Mr. Mougin! Then, surprise!! Jerry Douglas magically appeared on stage, dobro in hand, ready to join in this fun. And join in he did with a completely baller solo of his own. So freakin’ good, my friends!! And as if that wasn’t enough, Bela Fleck came out to add himself and his banjo to the night alongside John Cowan on lead vocals for “Sail to Australia”. And Jerry was still there, too. Pretty crazy, right? Sammy and John had some really, really tight vocal harmonies that were just lovely. So easy on the ears. What a supergroup on the stage!! A true powerhouse performance. How couldn’t it have been? They finished up this giant set of theirs with some Bob Dylan, slowing things down to an intense rock’n’roll groove. And then, the intensity builds and you get that well-known chorus: “When You Gonna Wake Up”? I’ve heard Sam and band do this one before and I’ll always be happy to hear them do it again. Good songs are always worth hearing again, right? Yeah, so Chris had this drum solo, too, you see. And it was gargantuan in stature. Just huge. And awesome. Just like all the music I had just crammed into my ears like a musical glutton. Holy gods is this a phenomenal band!! Thank you so so much to each member of the band for one of my favorite sets from Telluride this year!! Everything you do is so very well appreciated!! Can’t wait to do it all over again next year. Or, hopefully, sometime sooner.\n\nLeftover Salmon\n\nSlamgrass time. Telluride main stage. Leftover Salmon. Bring it. It’s no big secret how much I love this band and, trust me, this performance only furthered those feelings. By quite a long shot. Having Salmon to Telluride has become tradition — back-to-back yearly invites are very rare. But not for Leftover. And let us all be quite thankful for that little fact!! The evening there in Town Park was just about a wonderful as a person could ask for: cool but not cold, clear moonlit skies, world class music on the new stage. Ahhhhhhhhhhh, life was very good that night. And how did they get things going? Well, with a little “Take Me Back to My Mountaintop” action to be precise. What better a starting song for the set? You know, since we were all up in the mountains together, soaking up so much of the life set forth in the lyrics…so bucolic, so relaxed, so musical, so magical. Take me back to my mountaintop, indeed!! And, big surprise here, I’m going to go on some more about Erik Deutsch, his keyboard skills, and the overall additive qualities he brings to the band. Because he was doing all that good stuff right there, right on stage. Just owning those keys like a true boss and yet gelling seamlessly with the fabric of the band. So glad to have him as a part of this madness we call Leftover Salmon. Drew Emmitt was up to the mic for the next song, “Western Skies”, all set to croon to us in that oh-so Drew voice of his. Songs like this and Mr. Emmitt were made for one another, as if that needs to be said. But you get my meaning. All throughout this song was the musical thread of Andy Thorn’s banjo line, note after note after note playing out into the night helping to weave the entirety of “Western Skies” together into a tapestry of musical genius. Magnificent. The familiar and fun “Liza” was next in line from the Salmon fellas that night. Taken at a speedy clip, this one featured a visit from Mayor McCheese to the stage to grace us all with his mighty presence, all to the backdrop of Erik’s amazing keyboard skills. Vince Herman, of course, on lead vocals sounded excellent as always…and, as always, it was like having a favorite uncle singing to you. Pretty awesome, right? Uncle Vince. I like that. Drew threw down a pretty sweet mando solo in this one about halfway through that was like pouring notes out of a bucket there were so many. What a brute on that mandolin! “Highway Song” followed “Liza” with Drew back up to the mic to take lead vocals, this being another song so well-suited to Emmitt’s strong vocals. Great multi-part harmonies going on in the chorus of this one, which I am always a sucker for. And also a really strong overall ensemble sound which provided a more than appropriate backdrop for Andy’s supremely killer shredding and Erik’s delightful keyboard dominance. What a fantastic set thus far! Next on the docket was the Great American Taxi song, a Vince-led number called “Weary Ramblin' Highway Man” to which the assembled gents on stage did great justice. Erik Deutsch was there a minute in going to town on his keyboards, making them zing and sing and rock us all. Alwyn Robinson was laying down some seriously ridiculous beats behind all this craziness up front. A lot of different tempos switching back and forth depending on the feeling of the song at that point. Masterful work. I’d never be able to keep up! And this song just jammed and jammed and jammed, Drew on electric killing a big solo reinforcing said jamming. This one was reaching monumental proportions. What a rush! Later on down the set, John Cowan, the Prince of Bluegrass, joined them for a little time in the limelight on back-up vocals. And the song? Why, the Emmitt-led “Breakin’ Thru”! Great harmonies between Drew and John all throughout this song, Cowan’s strong voice counterpointing Emmitt’s own. Most definitely an old favorite and crowd pleaser, this one was very well received by the audience who cheered their applause with loud voices up into the night skies above. Andy Thorn wrote the next selection of the evening, a song about how lucky the band is to be doing what they do: “Colorado Mountains Evermore”. With its simply stunning banjo intro, this one is one that I dig very much. And not just because I am from Colorado. This song is an anthem about all the joys and merriments and contentments associated with the bluegrass, slamgrass lifestyle and way of living. And I love hearing Andy sing, too. Hard drivin’, fast pickin’ here as well…all you can eat and more. This song just motors onwards and forwards at a blistering pace, each man keeping time on his instrument like a human metronome. Greg Garrison’s bass line laid a stout foundation upon which all this madness could ensue. Not an easy task whatsoever. Kudos to Greg, no doubt about it. John Cowan and Sam Bush were good friends to have on hand for the next number, John Hartford’s amazing “Steam Powered Aereo Plane”, which roared to life through Thorn’s banjo and ripped into the entire band spurring on one of the best renditions of this song I have ever witnessed. But, wait…you’re in luck!! Because you can witness it, too, through the wonders of this video!! Enjoy, friends!! (I am sure you will.)\n\nOf absolute note here is just how positively the crowd was reacting to seeing Fruition play. By far the most people were standing and dancing for this band than any other we saw at the secondary stage. And that sun was pretty warm. And plentiful. And people didn’t seem to care one bit as they enjoyed the delightful stylings of this fine crew out of Portland. Up next was the sweet and loving “She Loves Me Like High Waters” followed by the rocking number from a recent EP that Fruition did with Grant Farm, “Random Lee” — this one had pretty much everyone there up and moving and grooving. Folk rock at its finest here, ladies and gents. Excellence and fun all wrapped up together in an easy-to-love kind of band. And they weren’t done yet! Miss Allie Krall joined them for a song called “Labor of Love” from their upcoming album — in fact, this is, apparently, Mimi Naja’s favorite of the new tracks. A hopping, clapping rhythm coupled with superb rock guitar and Jay’s wonderfully unique vocals helped quickly make this one of my new favorites as well. After taking a few moments for much gratitude to the fest and their fellow bands, it was time for the old crowd favorite, “Mountain Annie”. Really love the melody line of that song! Something so catchy and haunting and gentle about it. Just makes you want to hit “repeat one” on the shuffle for awhile. Following “Mountain Annie” was the advice-riddled “Just Close Your Eyes” and then it was time for the big closer with “Gotta Get Back Home”, this last one almost feeling like a musical overlay to the time of the weekend, things starting to wrap up, pushing towards the final stretch. Then, come Monday, gotta get back home. And then they were done, last chords, final notes ringing out…or were they? Guess who scored an encore?? And boy did they ever bring out an encore! They said they only had a few minutes left so, why not completely melt our faces with a searing hot “Boil Over”? I mean this one was en fuego, my friends. They kickstarted that monster machine and tore through about three-and-a-half minutes of pure musical ecstasy with us, for us, for them. And then there was a second encore!! “Meet Me on the Mountain”!! It was, most assuredly, one incredible hell of a way to put the final smack down on their first Telluride showing. Damn! I have not doubts of a them being invited back again. Probably yearly after that set. Damn! Double damn! And then it was the Main Stage shuffle back over to Town Park to catch some Greensky Bluegrass. Tell yeah!!\n\nThere, wasn’t that just musical excellence personified? That, my lads and lasses, was the Gospel styling of Ricky Skaggs, Ry Cooder, Sharon White, and friends. Living legends on one stage, in the same ensemble. And boy, did it show! As with “Take Me in Your Lifeboat”, their second song of the evening. First impressions? Top-notch harmonies, no doubt. Ry Cooder on guitar? Like watching a mellow god of peerless ability. Ricky Skaggs? Seen him before…just love the guy. Great stage presence and the man can pick. I already saw exactly why this trio was pulled together here at Telluride. Later on down the set came an old Hank Williams ballad from Sharon White — “A Mansion on the Hill”, its sad and longing refrain and honky tonk tragedy feel hearkening back to an earlier time in music. Flatt and Scruggs “On My Mind” was another nostalgic selection bringing that classic sound and feeling of bluegrass of yore to Telluride, featuring Ricky on fiddle. Speaking of Ricky, he was full of stories and regaling that evening like about singing with Ralph Stanley when he was merely 15 years old. Can you imagine? Singing songs like “Daniel Prayed”, their next selection, for instance. “Morning, noon, and night” I could listen to these three and their ensemble play and sing. See what I did there? Later still a really cool and swung version of “Hold Watcha Got” was on the menu. Really dug this interpretation of it. And so did the dancing crowd! Another treat for all of us…more Flatt and Scruggs — “No Doubt About It”. I was certainly getting into this whole yesteryear vibe tonight. Which meant that the final, ultimate, final, completely, final (did I say final?) closing song of the 42nd Telluride Bluegrass Festival was Bill Monroe’s “Uncle Pen” which they absolutely crushed. Hard drivin’, fast pickin’, classic singin’ right until the beautiful end! Hats off to this trio and their band for an amazing set. Hats off to the organizers of the Festival for all their incredible efforts. Hats off to the technical support army that makes these things happen. Hats off to all the bands and artists for all the unparalleled joy and music! And, hats off to all the festival goers who made my first Telluride so special, so unique, so memorable, and so good that I’ll see you next year!!\n\nThe self-titled “Mother of Bluegrass”, Sam Bush has to be one of the genre’s all-time all-around all-stars. Popping up all over the place to guest in with incredible after amazing band after band after band as well as fronting his own group of greats, the venerable Sam is a welcome addition to any line-up and he did not disappoint. This was only my second time seeing him with his ensemble so, needless to say, I was pretty pumped. Starting out with a very free form and wandering intro, things quickly materialized and picked up into the quick pickin’, advice-laden “Play By Your Own Rules” to get things going again on the Telluride Main Stage. “Transcendental Meditation Blues” seems like an interesting name for a song…unless you are Sam Bush, that is. A mellower part of their repertoire, this song is a clever mix of bluegrass and something a bit more esoteric, all wrapped up in some savvy lyrics. They followed this with some classic Flatt and Scruggs, pickin’ and grinnin’ to “My Little Girl from Tennessee” featuring a great deal of characteristic harmonies from that golden age of grass. Another fast picker was up next, “Roll On Buddy” filled with some hot banjo riffs as well as an overall great energy displayed equally through all the musicians. A favorite of the set for me. A funky, delicious, jazzy instrumental came after followed by a Sam Bush-style love song entitled “Where’s My Love?”. Soulful and imploring, Sammy showed us in this song just the kind of breadth he posses backed by a hand-picked band that shores him up exquisitely. As if following Lake Street’s lead, The Sam Bush Band wasn’t to be outdone in terms of covers either, first absolutely nailing Jerry Lee Lewis’s “Great Balls of Fire” and then turning right around and destroying the Dead’s “Tennessee Jed”. Both barrels, both triggers. One, two. Bam. Wow. Seriously, both fantastic and both performed to the absolute high standard that is Sam Bush and The Sam Bush Band. Music of respectfully high calibre. And song after song. Finally, after a first-rate set he closed things with Dylan of all folks — “When You Gonna Wake Up” came slammin’ down with all the tour de force of the original. My friends, what a show. But, wait, there’s more? An encore you say? And what an encore, too…a Bill Monroe song but played in a fine, island reggae style. I had never heard “Blue Moon of Kentucky” in that fashion before, but I must say that I would love to hear it that way again. Sammy, fellas, Andy Thorn and Vince Herman joining in, excellence in motion. Many thanks for such a wonderful time. But that’s not all folks!! Not by a long shot, because Leftover Salmon was also there.\n\nTelluride Bluegrass Festival 2015\n\nFestival Experience Archive\n\nfor The Lot Scene by Parker\n\nSaturday Highlights - Part One\n\nThe Telluride Band Competition - Trout Steak Revival - Yonder Mountain String Band\n\nIt was “festival early” by the time we dragged ourselves into the Town Park venue. Leftover Salmon had worn us out the night before with a truly epic (yes, that word) late night show. One of the best I’ve seen…but that’s a story for another time. Right now it’s time to talk about why we were up and moving and at the Main Stage “so” early on Saturday morning: The Telluride Band Competition Finals. The five bands that made it through the prelims would be competing for the title on the very stage where one would perform a full set at next year’s festival. We walked in to the familiar sounds of a Lil’ Smokies song, with their robust texture and multi-part harmonies which then gave way to a fast pickin’ instrumental. Afterwards, The Smokies gave us the ballad of “California” followed by another tune featuring some really exquisite banjo work. Denver’s own The Lonesome Days were up next opening with “I’m Tired” a song about the futile attempt to get ahead in life and the toll it takes on the soul and body. Their quick set was peppered by some hard drivin’ music and skillful playing. They surely made Denver proud. And, after all the bands were done (and they all did an incredibly fantastic job — any of them could have taken first place), it was down to just these two bands, as fate would have it. But, there could be only one. And that one was to be Missoula, Montana’s The Lil’ Smokies, the 2015 Telluride Band Competition Winners! They were overjoyed to win and showed it freely on stage thanking the judges and crowd and everyone prolifically. It was a very happy moment. I’ll be psyched to see them and what they’ll bring to the Main Stage in 2016.\n\nSpeaking of winners on the Main Stage, it was time for Trout Steak Revival’s triumphant return to Telluride to do just that. This was my fourth or so time seeing this young band and, truthfully, I have grown rather fond of their music very quickly. I was really happy to hear them open with “Get a Fire Going”, one of my favorite songs of theirs. A happy, uplifting, joy-making number, this one always is a great positive affirmation to have alongside all your other live music. It’s one of those that makes you feel better after hearing it. “…it only takes a little spark to get a fire going.” And what a spark Trout Steak has! Bevin Foley was up to the mic next for the sassy but serious “Go On” handing some poor soul their walking papers through song. Later down the set came the driving and mysterious “Wind on the Mountain” which featured some exemplary instrumental interludes in between the hauntingly beautiful vocals. I really do love that song the more and more I hear it. “Ours for the Taking”, that optimistic tale of new beginnings and new possibilities followed — the chorus displaying some more of the harmonious vocal interplay that I have come to enjoy so much from this band. Who doesn’t love a good road trip song? Their next selection, “Oklahoma”, with its fast pickin’ banjo and guitar backing and rather memorable fiddle run, is and was that day, just that. Another great choice for this Telluride crowd. And then, into that special afternoon sunshine, Trout Steak sang and played my favorite of their songs, “Brighter Every Day”. Songs can be about anything — about any subject or situation that the writer imagines, dreams, or fashions. This song is about hope and positivity and joy and goodness and good feelings. And, in a set of songs that make you feel happy, this one stands out as their king. I challenge anyone to listen (and I mean really listen and not dismiss) to this song and not feel better for it. Of their final song they said that it was “about living life with the opportunity to meet anyone and at any moment who just might be the person that will change the course your life.” OK, I was hooked. So when they fired up the furtive “Like a River to the Sea” I could see what they had been talking about. For the unexpected encore we got the much-anticipated “Pie”, a song they told us they had thought no serious enough for Telluride Bluegrass. But what, I ask you, is more important than pie? Early in the morning, late in the evening? Till the day I die? A catchy, fun, and funny little ditty that’s both great for immediate dancing and delayed “lyrics-on-the-brain” syndrome (you will find yourself singing or humming or whistling this song over and over and over again so just get ready) and a great way to finish up a victorious back-to-Telluride set. I expect grand things from this young band in the future.\n\nAfter a quick break from the sun and a few rounds through this year’s vendors (which were fantastic and varied — it was also great to see our friend Phil Lewis at his booth, always nice to see a buddy) it was back to our spots near the Main Stage for Yonder Mountain String Band’s afternoon set. The lion’s share of their set it turned out was their new album, Black Sheep, which they played in its entirety from start to finish. Certainly a bold and daring move for Telluride, but one that also certainly paid off in the band putting their newest material directly in the hands, eyes, and ears of this of all audiences — a bold move, indeed. “Insult and an Elbow” got things off to that fast pickin’ start we’ve all come to expect from YMSB. The eponymous “Black Sheep” came after followed by the quick stepping “Ever Fallen In Love With Someone You Shouldn’t Have” featuring some very excellent fiddle work. Catching most of the set from the middle of the crowd, we walked up front to the dulcet tones of Miss Allie Krall intoning the sweet and lovely “Love Before You Can’t” in the warm late day heat and grabbed some real estate there to take in the rest of the music. I must now mention the insane mando skills of Jake Jolliff on “Drawing a Melody” a clear favorite of mine from the album if for nothing else than the opening and closing licks from Jake. Insane. Did I say that already? Well, I’m going to say it again. Insane. After wrapping the album with “New Dusty Miller” the band stepped large with the always great Sam Bush joining on for a whopping 23:00+ “Only a Northern Song” that took us all on an electrifying musical journey until finally closing things down for good with a “Shakedown Street” encore, thereby grabbing themselves a bit of small redemption from Dear Jerry as well. Another full circle. Another great set and many thanks to Yonder for an afternoon of very fine musicianship. Certainly had me very much looking forward to the rest of the day…but that will have to wait a spell.\n\nTelluride Bluegrass Festival 2015\n\nFestival Experience Archive\n\nfor The Lot Scene by Parker\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor years people had been saying to me: “You mean, you’ve never been to Telluride?!?” And it wasn’t for lack of desire, believe-you-me. But hearing the same thing over gets a bit tired after awhile you know? So, I figured that 2015 was the year to change all of that and stymie any such questions in the future by heading to the 42nd annual Telluride Bluegrass Festival. And I, for one, am so very grateful and happy that I did. While a remote distance from most major metropolitan areas, the bucolic mountain town of Telluride sits in a magnificently lovely part of southwest Colorado. As such, so worth it. Our drive from Boulder was a long one, however, when compared to countless other lengthy travels to get to other festivals, this one was, in a word (well, words), downright pleasant. Heading through the rugged Rockies, over panoramic mountain passes, past streaming waterfalls and jutting rock formations, and through charming old mining towns, each new sight was a new wonder and joy. Suffice it to say, the drive, while long, is not uninteresting. It is breathtaking. And, let’s just call it what it is: a gift. No doubt that it puts one in an incredibly excellent frame of mind for a marathon four day bluegrass bonanza in one of the stunningly prettiest settings on our planet. Arriving into town Wednesday night we were all taken aback by the quiet, charming, and lovely little community surrounded on all sides by painted mountains covered with trees and topped with snow whose sides were carved at intervals by the plummeting white waters of alpine falls. Adequate words fail me to convey to you the beauty of Telluride town if you’ve never been. So, I guess you had better get there, right? But, in the meantime, let me share a bit of what happened there this year starting with Thursday.\n\nThursday Highlights\n\nThe Jerry Douglas Band - Robert Earl Keen - Dave Bruzza & Dave Simonett\n\nI admit, I was excited as Jerry Douglas and his band took the stage as this was my first time seeing them. I know, I know. But, I was seeing them that day and that was more than good enough for me. I am biased towards the dobro as an instrument, it’s true, and one in the hand of an artist just as Douglas is a sight to be seen. And heard. As the first strains kicked to life, so did the festival around me, all of us reacting to the music emanating from the stage. It was early in the day and early in the fest and already the energy level was rising, people dancing, faces smiling, hands clapping madly at the end of each tune. Plainly, Telluride was the kind of festival that lives up to all the hype. And then makes some more. And then invents a little bit extra still after that. And then lives up to that new expectation…and then exceeds it. Like with Jerry Douglas’s unique rock’n’roll dobro groove for instance. As in Jimi Hendrix. On dobro. Played by Jerry. “Hey Joe”. Excellence. What a supremely good cover that was. It was fun watching the band all keep up which is impressive since two of them did the DelFest to Telluride “Delluride” bike trip between the two festivals. Really impressive, huh? Jerry and company finished up with “Who’s Your Uncle?” as their last tune which featured dobro and fiddle doubling the melody in a show of some very fine musicianship. Then, once the drums kicked in, the whole affair became another foot-stomping dance tune, and the crowd most certainly followed suit. I am really looking forward to seeing The Jerry Douglas Band again soon once I’ve had a chance to familiarize myself a bit more with their music. Because their music is fantastic. Robert Earl Keen was up next to bring a bit of country into the mix for us. And yet an early song in his set was “1952 Vincent Black Lightning” which they played in a style very reminiscent of Del and his band. A nice recognizable treat from a musician with whom I was not very familiar. But Mr. Keen put on a great show, replete in his pink jacket and hat and looked every part of many of the festival goers around me. Kudos for tapping into the vibe, sir! They also played the light “Footprints in the Snow”, a song from their newest album. All told I enjoyed Robert’s hour-plus set more than I thought I was going to, country not being my go-to genre. But this festival did start out as the Telluride Bluegrass and Country Festival so I suppose it is apropos to keep the tradition alive. Way to do just that, Mr. Keen! After that we moseyed on to the secondary stage at Elks Park to hear Dave Bruzza (Greensky Bluegrass) and Dave Simonett (Trampled by Turtles) play some Bob Dylan songs for us in the afternoon sun. Opening up with Simonett on “Tonight I’ll Be Staying Here With You” they continued with Bruzza singing “Day of the Locusts”, both of which were stylistically in sync with Dylan himself in many ways. They continued with a grooving, yet chill “Outlaw Blues” featuring Dave Simonett. Finally, the last song we caught was Bruzza’s “When I Paint My Masterpiece” a familiar song to Greensky fans. It was a really compelling set — I really dig Bob’s work and love hearing other musicians’ takes on it and the Daves did right by Dylan in my opinion. After a quick break, we hightailed it back to the Main Stage for Hot Rize as fast as our legs could carry us, not wanting to miss a note from that infamously awesome Colorado band.\n\nHot Rize - Red Knuckles & the Trailblazers - The Telluride House Band\n\nWalking up to the sounds of “Nellie Kane” coming down from the quartet on stage, I was already smiling ear-to-ear. Then, standing under the azure blue skies of western Colorado as we listened, it only seemed right for Tim O’Brien to sing us an apropos “Western Skies”. Which he did. And did very well. Next up we got the light and lovely but slightly sorrowful “You Were On My Mind This Morning”, another song from their most recent album, When I’m Free. My favorite song from these fine fellows was also included in the set: “Blue Is Fallin’” which sounded excellent. As always and increasingly so, I was very grateful to get to hear this selection from their repertoire. Then the boys got a little Gospel on us and sang the superb harmony-filled “I Am the Road” — such tight, well-sung harmonies like that are what so many strive for in bluegrass but few achieve to this level. A treat to hear each and every time. Then came “Come Away”, that wistful, pining, beseeching tale of love lost and love that could be. No matter what you say, “Doggone” came next (see what I did there?) which, like most of Hot Rize’s songs, I liked from the first moment I heard it. And I still do…and certainly did at Telluride. O’Brien lamented the mournful, cautionary “A Cowboy’s Life” for us which set us up perfectly for a showing from Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers, that cowboy band that travels with Hot Rize from time to time. This time Elmo Otto (Sam Bush) was guesting in with the Traiblazers as well as Elmo Otto 2 (Identity Unknown), both on fiddle. Absolutely made for some great cowboy music! Like “I Know My Baby Loves Me” for instance. And some pretty hilarious joke songs like “Bake Shop Boogie” about the antics at a cannabis bakery. And, always the comedic stylings of Waldo Otto. But, of course. However, all good things must come to an end and soon, the ‘Blazers were being rushed off-stage once more by Hot Rize who returned with the instrumental “Glory in the Meeting House”, another favorite of mine from the new album. Really reminds me of a lot of tunes from my trad Irish music days — a tune you can really drum to. They picked an old song of theirs out of mothballs for us next: “Radio Boogie”. One I had never heard but would love to hear again. All night, all four of them had been on fire musically, seemingly really tapping the whole Telluride vibe and channeling that energy through their music and to us. But their supremely fine musicianship is no surprise to anyone who knows Hot Rize. Ending with McCoury’s “High on a Mountain” these stellar fellers put on a characteristically great show with some great use of available guests. And they set the stage and scene perfectly for the Telluride House Band up next. House Band. What a term for this ensemble gathered. This bluegrass supergroup. Sam Bush, Edgar Meyer, Jerry Douglas, Béla, Bryan, Stuart…you get the idea. A list of greats very great at what they do. And what they did was probably in the top two sets of the entire weekend. And on Thursday. Way to set the bar high, fellas. They opened with “Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor” kickin’ out some Gospel for us right from the get go. Then it was time for some hard drivin’ bluegrass singing with Bryan from Hot Rize followed later by none other than the “Pink Panther Theme”. Yes, you read that correctly. The “Pink Panther Theme”. On banjo and dobro and fiddle, etc, and it was hilarious. And amazing. What a “cover”!! Good old fashioned fast pickin’ was name of the game with “The Snowflake Reel” with so many intense and intensely good solos from these virtuosi there present. What a privilege to watch so much talent and skill combined on one stage together. Incredible. They grassed-up the Waylon Jennings song “I’ve Always Been Crazy” for us next followed by a sea shanty of all things. This band was all over the place tonight and it was great. Sammy Bush sang us a wonderful “How Mountain Girls Can Love” with that rich baritone voice of his and later sang us some old Doc Watson as well. Just can’t get me enough of Sam. But who can, honestly? “Play It Straight, Strive for Tone” was an Edgar Meyer-led instrumental that was true to its name as each of the world-class musicians showed us just what their chosen instruments could do. And, finally, before the crowd could take anymore, they brought Tim O’Brien out to add his own unique energy to the mix for “Workin’ On a Building” to close down the Main Stage for the evening. My goodness, what a set that was. So much extremely first-class music and so much first-class musicianship. Honestly, even knowing the lineup, it was going to be hard for the days to follow to measure up to such a lofty benchmark as Thursday. But, I was certainly going to cheer them on as they tried. Thankful for Thursday we made our way off to enjoy some late night with The Drunken Hearts. Time to relax and just listen."
