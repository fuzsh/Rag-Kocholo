        "text": "“There is no real ending. It’s just the place where you stop the story.” –Frank Herbert\n\nCocoa and Chiya hang out in the half-timbered town’s busy market on a winter’s day. They end up running into Rize and Sharo, and wander up to a viewpoint overlooking the town. It turns out Cocoa had been out to pick something up for Rabbit House and ended up forgetting her original assignment, causing Chiya, Rize and Sharo to be late for work, too. Back at Rabbit House, Chino shares a conversation with Tippy and comments on how recently, the smell of freshly-baked bread has begun to put her mind at ease the same way the scent of coffee does. Later, Cocoa is surprised to see Maya and Megu at Rabbit House. They’re visiting to interview Takahiro and the other staff at Rabbit House for an assignment to learn more about workplaces. After speaking with Takahiro, Maya and Megu decide to swing by Fleur de Lapin and Ama Usa An. As a part of her duties as Rabbit House, Cocoa is asked to accompany Maya and Megu to the different cafés. At Ama Usa An, Chiya reveals that their rivalry with Rabbit House has helped Ama Usa An to continually innovate, but despite putting on a cool face for Maya and Megu about striking a balance between her work and coursework, it turns out both Cocoa and Chiya are concerned about their subjects of weakness. At Fleur de Lapin, Maya and Megu misunderstand the sort of café Sharo works at and end up getting distracted when Midori shows up: they wind up interviewing her about her novelist career instead. For Midori, her interest in writing came about as a suggestion from someone else, and in the present, she enjoys writing because it requires that she observe people. Maya and Megu end up emptying out Cocoa’s wallet, but their adventures allow them to complete their report. Chino later notices that Cocoa’s got a fever, and attempts to look after her. After classes end for the day, Chiya, Rize, Maya and Megu swing by to visit Cocoa. Quite separately, Sharo’s also fallen ill, but she decides to study with her time. Later that evening, Cocoa’s fever worsens, and Chino becomes increasingly worried. With Rabbit House out of medicine, Tippy suggests that Chino ask Chiya for some. Although Chino sets off alone, Tippy soon joins her, and Chino reveals that she’s become quite fond of Cocoa. Midori stops by Cocoa’s room to keep an eye on Cocoa, but accidentally becomes drunk. Chino reaches Ama Usa An and picks up the medicine from Chiya. Upon returning home, Chino finds Cocoa awake, grateful for everything that Chino’s done for her. The next morning, Cocoa’s recovered, but Chino now has the mumps. She reluctantly allows Cocoa to look after her. After recovering, Chino and Rize share a conversation. Realising that Rabbit House is about to open, and Cocoa’s still asleep, Chino heads upstairs to wake Cocoa up. With nothing working, Chino reluctantly calls Cocoa onee-chan, eliciting an immediate response which leads Chino to deny having said anything. With this, GochiUsa‘s first season drew to a conclusion ten years ago, and while GochiUsa‘s first season hadn’t initially appeared to be anything remarkable or revolutionary, the series was successful in creating a cheerful and cathartic tale of friendship and acceptance during its original run.\n\nIn its finale, GochiUsa depicts the culmination of character growth for Cocoa and Chino. The episode opens with Cocoa bungling what is a simple task, to go out and fetch something for Rabbit House. She ends up throwing even Rize, Chiya and Sharo off-mission in the process. It is clear enough that Cocoa is scatter-minded and prone to distraction. However, when Maya and Megu come to Rabbit House with an assignment from their school, and Cocoa is asked to accompany the pair to different cafés around town, she ends up completing her task. Maya and Megu manage to interview enough people about their careers for their assignments, and the pair come back to Rabbit House in a timely fashion. Coupled with Cocoa’s competence as a baker, this finale to GochiUsa‘s first season shows that Cocoa can be capable and focused, marking her growth. Having worked at Rabbit House for around a half year now, Cocoa’s become more responsible and disciplined, but she still retains her cheerful optimism and a propensity to let her mind wander. By the finale’s end, Cocoa is shown as oversleeping, showing how despite the strides she’s made since moving to the half-timbered town, she’s still herself and has a corresponding set of strengths and weaknesses. Besides Cocoa, the finale also gives Chino a chance to shine. Despite her outward manner, and general reluctance to show Cocoa this, Chino does care about Cocoa and values the time they spend together. This becomes apparent when Cocoa is late from her errand, during which she says that Cocoa’s someone who can put her at ease. Similarly, when Cocoa develops a fever, Chino becomes very concerned and decides to brave the elements so that she can fetch medicine that would help Cocoa out. While Chino remains unwilling to call Cocoa onee-chan willingly and goes to great lengths to deny this, it is clear that by the season’s end, Chino has grown to care a great deal for Cocoa; she definitely values the energy and warmth Cocoa brings into her life, to the point where if Cocoa’s not around, she becomes disheartened. The friendship between Cocoa and Chino have a net positive impact on both: Cocoa becomes more responsible and focused, while Chino becomes more open-minded and receptive towards interacting with others. The finale does an excellent job of showing how far Chino and Cocoa have come; even this early on, it becomes clear that GochiUsa is about the importance of those chance encounters which open one’s eyes to the world. Their nascent friendship allows both Chino and Cocoa to share new experiences together, experiences that accelerate their growth as individuals.\n\nScreenshots and Commentary\n\nWith this post, my tenth anniversary revisit of GochiUsa‘s first season is almost at a close. It’s been an enjoyable twelve-week journey to go back and watch through GochiUsa again – in light of the second and third seasons, the first season can appear to be overshadowed, feeling a little more muted and generic in comparison with what happens later. However, the importance of this first season was that it represents the means to establish all of the characters. Once all of the characters are established, later seasons could drop viewers right into things without additional exposition.\n\nAlthough GochiUsa‘s first season takes several liberties with the flow of events relative to the manga, the choice to do things in such a manner allows the first season to act as a self-contained story that would’ve stood on its own merits in the event that no continuation was ever made. On the flip-side, because two additional seasons were produced, things seen in the first season serve to act as foreshadowing for what was to come in later manga volumes (and correspondingly, animated adaptations). The end result of this is that GochiUsa‘s first season ends up being an extremely well-written adaptation, one that elegantly prepared for both eventualities.\n\nThe finale to GochiUsa‘s first season ended up setting the precedence for how season finales in later seasons would be structured. In most anime, even slice-of-life series, the season finale typically depicts something dramatic to represent the sum of the characters’ journeys. However, GochiUsa‘s anime adaptation is written in a way such that the penultimate episode acts as a given season’s climax: here in the first season, the Christmas episode shows the culmination of Cocoa’s presence in Chino’s life. Thanks to Cocoa, Chino is able to see her friends working together at Rabbit House for the first time. The second season had Chino realising that Cocoa isn’t as scatter-brained as she appeared during an outing to the mountains, and in BLOOM, Chino realises that she’s now made lifelong friends, fulfilling her mother’s wish to see Chino’s friends working together at Rabbit House.\n\nWrapping a season up with a more laid-back episode acts as an extended dénouement, one that allows GochiUsa to ease out of its story. However, just because the finales are relaxed does not mean they’re lacking in substance. Here in the first season, Cocoa’s (unintentional) roping of Rize, Chiya and Sharo into relaxing after walking the town market together is meant to show how Cocoa has a natural talent for persuading people to stop and smell the roses. When I first watched GochiUsa, Rize had been my favourite of the characters for her tough-as-nails personality and love of all things military, but a full ten years later, I find Cocoa to be a superb character because of her ability to rally spirits for the people around her.\n\nAt first glance, Cocoa’s ability to distract most anyone is a shortcoming, but the reality is that in today’s society, people are so fixated on being productive that they often forget to take a moment to stop and smell the roses. In fact, some folks even hold the belief that any idle moment is a moment wasted, when in reality, the productive and successful mind is one that can budget time out to get things done so that when there is downtime, they can relax guilt-free. Cocoa’s presence thus acts as a reminder to viewers that there are merits in practising mindfulness – Cocoa only prima facie appears to be lazy, but when the moment calls for it, she’s also competent, hard-working and devoted, able to master what she sets her mind to.\n\nThe first of two vignettes in GochiUsa‘s finale deals with career interviews, as Maya and Megu swing by Rabbit House to interview the staff and see how their careers unfolded. When speaking with Takahiro, Tippy becomes irate: Chino’s grandfather never quite over the fact that when Takahiro took over Rabbit House, the café/bar became more successful financially. Because Maya and Megu are not aware that Tippy houses Chino’s grandfather’s spirit, they assume that Chino disagrees with Takahiro. There is a subtle hint in GochiUsa that Rabbit House must be doing well: Chino is rocking the Xperia SP, a Sony Smartphone that dates back to 2013 and had an MSRP of 380 USD.\n\nWith a dual-core 1.7 GHz processor, 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of internal storage and an 8 MP back-mounted camera, the Xperia SP is counted as an excellent phone that contemporary reviewers felt to be Sony’s comeback in the smartphone space. All of the characters in GochiUsa use different phones: Cocoa uses the Fujitsu F-01C, Chiya runs the Sharp Aquos Phone SL, Rize has an iPhone 5, and Sharo rolls with the Honey Bee 201K. At the time of its original airing, fans pulled this information from image boards and speculated that the phones were meant to have significance. However, period discussions never did produce a meaningful conclusion regarding what the different phones said about each characters.\n\nAs such, I will step up and add that in the Memorial Blend guidebook, the director’s commentary shows that the staff had meant for the characters’ phones to say a little more about their background and personalities. Cocoa’s Fujitsu phone was originally released in 2010, four years before GochiUsa, but it was widely regarded to be a competent mid-range feature phone. This shows that Cocoa is a versatile but old-fashioned individual who may not be the best with the latest and greatest, offsetting this with sincerity. Chiya’s Sharp Aquos Phone SL was a 2014 model that was praised by contemporary reviewers as having good all-around features, but stood out because of its edgeless design. Chiya, similarly, has standout characteristics which make her immediately recognisable, but beyond her love of scary stories and fancy menu names, she’s a kind and reliable girl.\n\nRize’s iPhone 5 needs no introduction – it was one of the premiere models of its time and bears similar hardware to Chino’s phone, with the main difference being that even the entry-level iPhone 5 had 16 GB of internal storage and Apple’s devices have international recognition as being top-performers. Rize is from a wealthy background and has nothing but the best, but like her phone, Rize is reliable, dependable and has a very distinct branding in her personality. Chino’s smartphone similarly represents a well-rounded and balanced individual who’s also unassuming. Finally, Sharo’s Honey Bee 201K was originally released in 2012 and designed as an inexpensive phone for high school girls. Despite its lower hardware specifications compared to other phones of its time, the Honey Bee 201K was counted as a good budget phone, mirroring how despite coming from a lower-income background, Sharo is hardworking and competent.\n\nThis is the minimum level of discussion I expect from folks who bring up points of trivia in their discussion: details about a character are not particularly useful on their own, since they might just be included to increase the sense of immersion, but when one takes the time to stop and consider why producers go to the lengths of including said details, they might gain a newfound appreciation for the characters and world-building in a given work. If one only brings up trivia with the aim of showing how much they know, this precludes the possibility of a discussion because the “so what” aspect of what these details mean are never explored. As it was, ten years after GochiUsa‘s initial airing, I’ve shared my thoughts on why the different phones that Cocoa, Chino, Rize, Chiya and Sharo use contribute to the immersion within GochiUsa.\n\nAfter interviewing Takahiro, Maya and Megu wonder if they’d be able to go out and check out some other workplaces. To this end, Cocoa is asked to join them, and while Cocoa initially wonders if this is okay, Chino and Rize convince her that it’s fine since they’ve got things under control at Rabbit House. Period viewers assumed that Rize and Chino did not believe in Cocoa’s competence to help out at Rabbit House, but I found that the choice to send Cocoa out was because Rize and Chino know Cocoa has a natural affinity for looking after people; Maya and Megu would have the most fun with their assignment if they were with Cocoa.\n\nIn this way, Cocoa brings Maya and Megu out to Ama Usa An so they can have a chat with Chiya about her work. The rivalry between Rabbit House and Ama Usa An is brought up again, and while Cocoa remarks that the antagonistic rivalry is long past, Chiya adds that their past rivalry has allowed Ama Usa An to continually strive to innovate and find creative ways of bringing customers in. Out here, competition is all about mopping the floor with one’s rivals, and maintaining supremacy at all costs: this is why Western foreign policy is hegemonic and aggressive. On the other hand, in Asian cultures, competition is meant to drive innovation and motivate individuals to be their best self – the constant push for improvement means that people end up with better things all the time. This message is especially common in anime, where rivalries are shown as a driver for progress amongst individuals.\n\nHere at the finale, it is evident that GochiUsa manages to strike a fine balance between the heartwarming and comedic. When Maya and Megu’s interview of Chiya lead to the inevitable question of how she manages her time to ensure she can work and keep up in her studies, Cocoa and Chiya reply with a non-answer, saying that working is a different form of studying, and that creating a strict delineation between the two allow them to get by. The pair subsequently mope about how they’re screwed in their respective areas of weakness and will need to study together to make it. This shows how, while Cocoa and Chiya are both trying to give Maya and Megu the best answers they can for their career interview, they too are trying to get by.\n\nSharo is surprised to find Cocoa at Fleur de Lapin with Maya and Megu. The pair become distracted with the uniforms and imagine that Fleur de Lapin is a maid café, even asking Sharo to do poses and the like. Shortly after, Maya and Megu lose interest, leaving Cocoa to explains that they’re here for the two to interview some of the staff. Sharo’s reason for taking up such a job is so she can make ends meet, and while this is a very practical reason, I imagine that it’s not the sort of thing that Maya and Megu would count exciting. Cocoa notices that Midori’s hanging about, and the pair immediately set about interviewing her.\n\nWhen it comes to careers, there is no single path towards one’s career; for my part, the route I took was cragged and uncertain. I exited secondary school thinking I would one day become a medical doctor or bioinformatian, but lacking the temperament and skill set for either field, I ended up finding myself pulled to software development. In graduate school, I spent my time working with game engines, but having had exposure to iOS development in undergraduate courses, I was eventually made a TA for the same iOS development course I once took. Seeing how mobile devices weren’t going anywhere, and having developed familiarity with Xcode meant I began seeing iOS development as an increasingly viable career choice.\n\nOn the other hand, Midori comments on how she became a novelist because others had suggested that this was a field she had some aptitude in. In the present day, Midori also enjoys the profession because it is conducive towards one of her favourite pastimes of people watching, and she’s especially fond of staring at Sharo in a lecherous fashion. This aspect of Midori’s character appears to be purely for comedy, but when pressed about the matter, Midori remarks that she admires Sharo for always working hard to overcome her problems, and it turns out that Midori’s latest bestsellers all feature a protagonist inspired by Sharo, including Caffeine Fighter and Phantom Thief Lapin.\n\nA full half-day spent with Maya and Megu empties Cocoa’s wallet, but the outcome of this gentle afternoon was that the pair’s assignment is done. While Cocoa is made aware of the fact that being a reliable “older sister” archetype does have its caveats, being able to spend time with Maya and Megu makes up for it. Cocoa’s one to live in the moment, and despite some things getting her down, Cocoa lives up to her family name, whose kanji approximates to “always rising”: like bread, Cocoa always rises to the occasion.\n\nThe final vignette in GochiUsa‘s first season has Cocoa falling ill. According to the director’s commentary, after spending a majority of the series dealing with happier topics, the writers wanted to show that GochiUsa could be a little more serious, too. This would present an opportunity for the story to show how Chino really felt about Cocoa – when times are good, Chino tends to maintain a stoic façade and deny that she cares about Cocoa, but when the chips are down, Chino does care. The choice to present this story was a consequence of the fact that, at the time, the writers did not know whether or not they’d get a chance to extend the story.\n\nAs such, to accentuate that Cocoa has made a tangible difference in Chino’s life, the team would go with this approach so that GochiUsa, were it only to receive a single season’s worth of anime, could stand of its own accord. The framing of this scene shows how Chino’s become close enough to Cocoa to figure out that something’s off: while Cocoa is always happy-go-lucky, Chino is able to spot when Cocoa isn’t her usual self. This scene was very subtle, and even I wasn’t able to ascertain how Chino spots Cocoa’s fever. Prior to this moment, Chino comments on how adorable the snow bunny Cocoa had made was; the yuki usagi are an integral part Japanese culture and have at least two hundred and fifty years worth of history.\n\nIt turns out that Cocoa’s developed a cold of sorts and ends up taking the difference of the day to rest. Rize and Chiya end up visiting. Friends stopping by to wish one a speedy recovery is a common element in anime, but previously, I’ve remarked on how this is a storytelling element rather than anything cultural: when one is sick, the best course of action is to rest and avoid too much activity. Of course, if a work went down this route, things would be less engaging for viewers. This is why, whenever I go through a given work of fiction, I always allow for the fact that a story will unfold in a way that keeps viewers’ attention, rather than in a manner that’s considered realistic.\n\nThis was a major problem that I had with period discussions of GochiUsa, especially at TV Tropes. During its run, segments of the community claiming to be “very critical minded” to the point where, “if [they] review something, [they] will likely point out the flaws [they] see” picked the series apart. Individuals like “AnotherDuck” and “Diamite” took to posting pointless bullet point reactions to scenes in each episode and claimed that this constituted analysis. In particular, AnotherDuck claimed that GochiUsa‘s aesthetic was “forced cutesy that mostly just manages to look overproduced and plastic”, but then proceeded to watch episodes and churn out bullet-point reactions after each episode anyways.\n\nQuite separately, Sharo’s also fallen ill, and while she tires of idling, she tries to study. When Chiya arrives, she reminds Sharo that it’s better to let her body rest. The moment shows how, despite her unusual mannerisms (evidenced by the garland of garlic beside her), Chiya does legitimately cares about her friends. Over the years, I’ve continued to remind viewers that, whenever reading discussions on slice-of-life and iyashikei series, it is prudent to always exercise one’s own judgement; agreeing with the discussion at places like TV Tropes isn’t particularly productive because the online community may not always make an effort to understand what the author or studio’s goals were, nor do they always possess the requisite life experience to fairly critique what’s happening within a given story.\n\nFor instance, when Cocoa’s fever ends up worsening, Chino’s worry increases because they’re out of medicine at Rabbit House. AnotherDuck felt the events in the finale were forced and wondered “why anime characters are always so reliant on cold medicine to survive a cold”, arguing that “it’s not exactly a severe sickness, unless things are extremely hostile in Japan”. Such sentiments parallel the lack of worldliness at TV Tropes: for one, fevers are very rare in colds, and Cocoa does not have the other symptoms of a cold (e.g a stuffy noise, loss of voice or persistent coughing and sneezing). A cold can be dealt with though sleep and proper hydration; Cocoa’s fever suggests that she has influenza here.\n\nTo manage fevers, the consequence of the body elevating its internal temperature to both increase the immune response and create an environment unfavourable to pathogens, over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or aspirin are suggested. They won’t help accelerate recovery, but they can help the body fight off pathogens and in doing so, reduce the body’s need to increase its temperature. This is why Chino is so concerned with getting some medicine: while AnotherDuck believes that the medicine was to treat a common cold (incidentally, there are no treatments for the cold virus itself), in reality, Chino was looking for medicine which would lessen the severity of Cocoa’s symptoms.\n\nCooca’s situation worsens enough to spur Chino to action: she decides to fetch some medicine from Chiya and so, she steps out into the cold and snowy night on her own. Tippy ends up following her, and Chino is all too happy to have her grandfather present. The moment was meant to show how despite appearances, Chino is appreciative of company, and with support from Tippy, Chino makes it to Chiya’s place. For me, this scene was an integral piece to GochiUsa‘s season one finale – while it’s dark and intimidating amidst the snowstorm, there’s also a gentle quiet about the scene. GochiUsa sought to show how even in the darkest of moments, having a little support around can turn things around. The snowstorm hadn’t felt particularly dangerous or intimidating, but it did present Chino with another challenge, one which she is able to overcome.\n\nIn Chino’s absence, Midori looks after Cocoa, tucking her in and looking over her. Cocoa evidently has many people in her life, a consequence of her open and cheerful personality allowing her to befriend most anyone, and while Midori does decide to partake in some alcohol while watching Cocoa, the moment is meant to be humourous more than harmful. In the end, Chino returns with the medicine, and by the next morning, Cocoa makes a full recovery. In a bit of situational irony, however, Chino ends up picking up the mumps virus and becomes confined to her bed.\n\nGiven the incubation period of mumps, it is the case that Chino had already been infected, and her symptoms did not manifest until recently. As such, Chino getting sick was not the consequence of her being in close proximity to Cocoa (as TV Tropes’ Diamite claimed). From an imagery perspective, it’s easy to believe that Chino overexerted herself trying to look after Cocoa. However, the story progresses in a way that is conducive towards the producer’s intentions – the choice to go with a mumps virus was to show that at this time of year in GochiUsa, it’s easy to get sick.\n\nWhen the shoe’s on the other foot, and Cocoa is fine, Chino reverts to her usual mannerisms – she refuses any help from Cocoa. The change in circumstances reintroduces humour into GochiUsa after a more serious vignette, helping to defuse tensions and allowing the episode to conclude. However, there is a subtle moment following, one which TV Tropes’ viewers missed entirely: despite her words, Chino smiles lightly after Cocoa expresses concern for her, showing that outward appearances notwithstanding, she does appreciate all that Cocoa does for her.\n\nAfter the credits finish rolling, GochiUsa decides to present a brief scene which gives the finale its title: some time later, both Cocoa and Chino have recovered, and Chino tries to wake Cocoa up ahead of what is sure to be a busy day. When nothing has any effect, Chino decides to pull out her ace-in-the-hole and address Cocoa as onee-chan, which gets an immediate and prompt reaction. This brings the episode and GochiUsa‘s first season to a close. By this point ten years ago, the series would’ve drawn to a close, and as I was making solid progress in the Giant Walkthrough Brain, I would start my own journey into GochiUsa. It should be clear that in the present, I’ve got a bit more insight to offer readers regarding GochiUsa than I did a decade earlier, and through this revisit, I found more meaning and depth to what outwardly appears to be yet another slice-of-life comedy.\n\nEven though the me of a decade earlier did not appreciate GochiUsa as much as the series deserved, the series still left an indelible mark on me. The anime would prompt me to put in more effort in making the Giant Walkthrough Brain successful and immersive, and when news of a second season was announced, I found myself writing about the new episodes in an episodic fashion. For this reason, GochiUsa as a whole is a masterpiece because it is a work that had a nontrivial impact on my world views. At present, there’s been no news of a fourth season, but because this year marks the ten year anniversary to GochiUsa‘s original airing, I am hoping that we will see some news of a continuation in the near future. By this point in time, GochiUsa‘s animated adaptation has reached a point where the series can be concluded on a high note – fans of the series do deserve at least this much.\n\nAt the end of this ten year anniversary revisit, all thought turns towards what lies ahead for GochiUsa: the series is already standout amongst Manga Time Kirara adaptations, being one of the few series to receive three seasons’ worth of content, and given its acclaim, the possibility of another continuation is one that remains quite real. However, ten years is also a very long time for an iyashikei series to be running. The manga is ongoing, and it continues to introduce new characters, as well as presenting their interactions with the existing cast. With such a quantity of source material, it is conceivable that GochiUsa could continue running for a fourth, fifth and even a sixth season. As enjoyable as additional seasons would be, there would come a point where things would need to wrap up. As a case in point, sister series Kiniro Mosaic wrapped its series up in 2021 with a film that depicted Shinobu and Alice graduating together. Although the film condensed over five volumes of manga into a single story, the distilled story remained successful in conveying its themes. In GochiUsa, there is a reasonable stopping point as well: at the end of BLOOM, Chino begins to express a desire to explore the world, and Rize’s made it into her post-secondary of choice. Having spent the season exploring different secondary schools, Chino, Maya and Megu also prepare for their graduation. The end of one period in one’s life, and the transition into the next is a significant milestone. Anime have traditionally shown students celebrating this milestone with a graduation trip, and this is precisely what happens in the manga. As a result, a continuation of GochiUsa, one that shows the girls going on a graduation trip, returning home and graduating, and then preparing for a new stage of their lives with confidence, would allow for GochiUsa‘s animated adaptation to conclude on a definitive note. Ideally, this continuation would take the form of a fourth season running for twelve or thirteen episodes – while the theatrical format would allow for an uninterrupted story to be told, a single film with a two-and-a-half hour runtime would have around seven episodes’ worth of content. GochiUsa is the kind of story that would benefit from having the space to properly portray the events that Chino and the others experience, and the television format remains the ideal way of finishing the story: this would provide the space to showcase the large city that Chino and her friends visit, have them return home to prepare for graduation, and close off with Chino preparing for her first day of secondary school with Cocoa and Chiya. At this point, no news of a continuation exists, but because this year is the tenth anniversary to GochiUsa‘s animated adaptation, if there were a time to announce the series’ future, this would be the best opportunity to do so – GochiUsa remains an impactful anime even today, and the fact that its popularity has endured into the present speaks volumes to how well-written the series is. For my part, while this is the final episode of GochiUsa‘s first season, and the last post in my revisit, I do hope that this won’t be the last time I write about this series here.\n\n“The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others’ burdens, easing other’s loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of Christmas.” –W.C. Jones\n\nChristmas draws near in the half-timbered town, and to prepare for the holidays, Chino and Cocoa head out into the Christmas market in order to buy some ornaments for Rabbit House. Rize, Chiya and Sharo accompany them as they browse the different shops for ornaments, and the festivities surrounding the Christmas market lead Cocoa and Chino to simultaneously suggest hosting a Christmas party at Rabbit House. While Chino struggles to decide what works best, Cocoa confides in Rize that she’d like to buy a Christmas gift for her. Rize ends up suggesting a music box as a gift, and after leaving the store, snow begins falling. On Christmas Eve, it’s a busy night at Rabbit House – there are many guests who’ve shown up to try the holiday pancake special. When Chiya, Sharo, Megu and Maya arrive, they’re surprised to see that Chino, Cocoa and Rize are still hard at work – Sharo ends up taking charge and helps to direct the others, improving efficiency. With everyone lending a hand, work goes smoothly, and after Rabbit House closes for the evening, the girls’ Christmas party can begin. Although it’d been chaotic, the girls still had a good time of working together. By night, Cocoa sneaks out to Chino’s room to deliver her gift, but she ends up falling asleep, and when Takahiro spots this, he smiles. The next morning, Chino is surprised to see Cocoa sleeping in her room, and after everyone gets changed, Cocoa is surprised to see that “Santa” also left something for her, causing Chino to smile at the thought of how absent-minded Cocoa can be. When the penultimate episode of GochiUsa aired, it would’ve been a few days to the summer solstice for viewers who were actively following the series. This would be a most unusual time to be thinking about the Christmas season, especially when most people would be gearing up for the summer – watching Christmas stories in the summer always feels incongruous for folks in the northern hemisphere, as Christmas is associated with cold and snowy weather, but speaking to GochiUsa‘s ability to consistently immerse viewers, the Christmas setting never once felt forced. For me, I ended up reaching this episode a few days into my watch-through of the series, and by early July, the Giant Walkthrough Brain was in an excellent spot: most of the core infrastructure was now implemented, and we were making minor adjustments and improvements to the project at this point in the summer ahead of the inaugural presentation at the Banff Centre.\n\nGochiUsa‘s Christmas episode stands out because it marks one of the most significant turning points in the entire series – for the first time, all of Cocoa, Chino, Rize, Chiya, Sharo, Maya and Megu work together at Rabbit House. The director’s commentary in Memorial Blend state that this was a deliberate choice, done to show how Cocoa’s social circle has expanded since she’d moved to the half-timbered town, and while it is true that Cocoa has a natural affinity for livening up things for the people around her, the importance of this was that through Cocoa’s influence, Chino is also able to share in these experiences. Up until now, Chino had been accustomed to doing things on her own, but having Cocoa around means that she’s able to things with a wider range of people. Foreshadowing this, once Chiya and Sharo arrive at Rabbit House, Chiya’s already wearing a green cardigan, and Sharo borrows a yellow apron – despite lacking a dedicated uniform, Chiya, Sharo, Maya and Megu fit right in and immediately set about making a tangible difference on this evening. In GochiUsa‘s second season, the opening briefly shows all of the girls wearing Rabbit House uniforms, and by BLOOM, it turns out that long ago, Chino’s mother had begun work on at least two other uniforms, both of which have the same colour as the clothing that Chiya and Sharo were wearing on this Christmas evening. Chino’s mother had crafted these uniforms with the expectation that Chino would one day make friends who would bond with her closely enough to help out at Rabbit House, and Cocoa ends up being the one who takes initiative to, with some support from Rize, complete the uniforms (on top of creating new uniforms for Maya and Megu). In BLOOM, it is clear that Chino’s exceeded expectations, and that Cocoa appears to be very similar to Saki Kafuu in terms of personality, giving Chino the boost she needed to regain her curiosity and happiness anew. While BLOOM had made this very obvious, even GochiUsa‘s first season starts to hint at where things are headed; Cocoa’s presence is what allows Chino to, for the first time, work with all of her friends together at Rabbit House; this is not mentioned in the episode, but GochiUsa‘s anime adaptation would allow Chino to fulfil one of Saki’s original desires to see her working alongside friends early on.\n\nScreenshots and Commentary\n\nHaving already written about GochiUsa‘s first Christmas episode on previous occasions (including one standalone post on the episode to celebrate Christmas nine years earlier), finding screenshots I hadn’t previously used was one of the challenges about writing for this penultimate episode. Unless there is a specific need for it, I prefer trying to use different images here to ensure every post is fresh. Seeing the half-timbered town by Christmas for the first time was a a magic moment in a series of magic moments, and I still remember smiling widely when I reached this episode – with summer having just arrived, the days were long and warm, a far cry from the brisk weather and snow that would’ve been seen in GochiUsa.\n\nDespite having only spent a mere half-year with Cocoa, Chino begins to take on the same vibes as Cocoa; here, she reacts after she and Cocoa simultaneously suggests hosting a Christmas party at Rabbit House. When Chiya remarks that the two sound like sisters, Chino becomes shocked at what’s happening and tries to deny this. Her expression here is adorable, being quite reminiscent of Renge’s facial features in Non Non Biyori. The outward similarities between slice-of-life anime of the time meant that for some viewers, it was easy to get them mixed up: at the time, some viewers commented on how similar GochiUsa was to Kiniro Mosaic.\n\nWhile the shows do seem similar, the thematic elements differ amongst each show, and therefore, I found it worthwhile to watch all of them to see the merits of each. Despite the ten years that have passed since I first watched GochiUsa, it suddenly hits me that I’ve still yet to visit any sort of Christmas Market, whether it be the smaller local ones, or a proper Christmas market somewhere like Dresden, Cologne or Munich. With a full-frame camera in hand, it suddenly hits me that I could book a vacation in late November or early December and fly out to Germany. Any decent wide-angle fast prime lens would be suited for capturing the atmospherics of a Christmas market, and the bonus is that such a lens would be useful for astrophotography, too.\n\nThe same lens that would be ideal for capturing a Christmas market is one that’s also suited for the low-light conditions at Takehara’s Shokei-no-Michi Festival. The Sony 20m f/1.8 G I picked up a few months ago fits the bill – it’s an excellent lens and has a wide enough aperture for those lantern-illuminated shots. With this being said, the Tamron 28-200mm f/2.8-5.6 that I brought earlier this month is passable for low-light conditions if I’ve got a tripod. There’s still a few months left before this trip, but given how quickly time flies, it would be prudent to decide soon as to whether or not I’ll want to bring a tripod with me to Takehara; I bought an inexpensive tripod last year for videography, but it doesn’t fold down to a small size.\n\nThe me of a decade earlier was more concerned with Unity’s camera component than with mirrorless cameras and their lenses. The Unity camera component was an integral part of the Giant Walkthrough Brain, being the means that controlled what viewers would see. One of my earliest tasks was to constrain the camera to a spline, and after that, my focus shifted over to timing movement along this path. Towards the end of June, when we began fine-tuning the project, I used camera effects and field of view to simulate zooming in and blurring out as transitions between different scenes. I recall how I had a second camera that one could switch between, and this camera allowed one to move freely throughout the 3D space.\n\nThe audience would never see this second camera: I intended it to be used for debugging purposes. By then, I also started learning about projecting the view from multiple cameras onto screen-space, and this resulted in one of the most helpful tools in The Giant Walkthrough Brain. In tests with Jay Ingram, it was found that some viewers were getting lost and wondered where in the brain they were, so I was asked to build a mini-map. Initially, I was worried that Ingram was looking for a 3D mini-map, but when I learnt that a 2D mini-map was more than sufficient, I set about building one. Owing to the mathematics needed, it took me over a week to put this together and test it, but the results were worth it: once the mini-maps were implemented, viewers reported that they always knew where in they were, making the show easier to follow.\n\nBecause of the changes that have been made to Unity since then, I’m sure that there are numerous features and tools I’d need to learn about if I were to work on such a project in the future. Of course, I’m still a novice when it comes to lenses, and while I like the versatility of a zoom lens, a prime lens would offer solid image quality and a faster aperture for a smaller price. If I can find a focal length I like shooting at, a prime lens would be a more economical choice. With this being said, I have no plans on buying fisheye lenses to recreate scenes like this: something with a focal length between 20 and 24 mm is more than enough for the astrophotography shots I intend to take, and such a lens would also be helpful for low-light and wide-angle landscape photos.\n\nIn years past, I wrote about GochiUsa‘s portrayal of Christmas as being one of my favourite for showing how the winter festivities were woven seamlessly into a story without breaking the flow – the messages of GochiUsa are conveyed without the episode feeling like it’s out of place. Most anime use Christmas as a time to celebrate couples, and in slice-of-life anime, characters take advantage of this time to spend time together on Christmas Eve. Christmas Day, on the other hand, is another workday for most Japanese, so anime tends to portray Christmas Day as an ordinary day.\n\nAccording to the director’s commentary, this Christmas episode was a fun chance to explore the addition of festive decorations around town. The presence of glass balls, tinsel and stockings serve to make the half-timbered town feel a little more cozy, and this is something that I’m very fond of about the Christmas season; with a Christmas tree and decorations about, a space has more stuff in it and therefore feels warmer. By January, the combination of cold, short days and the absence of Christmas decorations can contribute to the feeling of darkness and isolation. This explains why many count January to be the most depressing month of the year.\n\nWith the sheer crowds at Rabbit House, the planned Christmas party is put on hold. While Cocoa was able to stay on mission, Megu and Maya’s arrival causes her resolve to waver. Originally, Cocoa had figured things were well in-hand, and invite Maya, Megu and Chiya to take it easy. Once the three try out the Christmas pancakes, they remain true to their word and begin helping out. With three extra hands on deck, work becomes a little smoother, but speaking to the fact that Maya and Megu aren’t quite accustomed to dealing with this number of customers, they need some assistance from Cocoa, Chino, Rize and Chiya.\n\nThe fact that Rabbit House can get this busy, however, is heartwarming: until now, viewers had assumed that Takahiro’s bar was single-handedly keeping Rabbit House afloat. However, logic would suggest that GochiUsa would simply choose to show moments when things are quieter. If Rabbit House is busy, Chino, Cocoa and Rize would be too busy working to interact with one another, and having many customers in Rabbit House would also increase the effort needed to animate each scene. While the studios clearly have no trouble doing so, to have Rabbit House filled to capacity in each scene would increase the amount of work needed to bring each episode to life.\n\nWhen Sharo arrives, she’s shocked to see everyone pitching in and helping out. While Cocoa and the others are more than willing to let Sharo rest, since she’d spent the day handing out flyers for Fleur de Lapin, the thought of delaying the Christmas party further causes Sharo to develop a second wind. With Sharo coordinating, efficiency increases to the point where the girls feel as though they’re communicating telepathically. GochiUsa had already indicated that actual telepathy isn’t actually at play here – the characters are just in sync enough so that it appears as though they can communicate using non-verbal means, so comparisons to other telepaths in other Manga Time Kirara works are quite unnecessary.\n\nSharo shows that she has many sides to her, well beyond just being an impoverished scholarship student who’s always worried about making ends meet. When push comes to shove, Sharo is someone who gets things done – at one point, Cocoa comments on how Sharo’s even stricter than Rize. This remark is easy to overlook, but it shows that despite their outward differences, Sharo and Rize are actually more similar than different. With everyone working at their best, the last of the customers are served, and soon, Rabbit House closes for the party.\n\nIn GochiUsa, Chino’s single largest weakness was her shy disposition, so having her lead the toast was an early indicator that spending so much time with Cocoa and the others has allowed her to open up, enough to toast the start to the Christmas party. The changes in Chino don’t happen overnight, and there are occasions in the second season, Dear My Sister and Sing For You where Chino needs an additional nudge to do something. The cumulative sum of these nudges mean that in BLOOM, Chino has no trouble being more vocal when she needs to be.\n\nIn North America and Europe, Christmas is a time for extravagant feasts. Japan, however, has different customs – unlike the customary turkey and stuffing with potatoes, cranberry sauce and seasonal vegetables, with a pudding, pie or Yule Log for dessert, the Japanese favour KFC and strawberry shortcake. The Christmas dinner in GochiUsa appears to be a hybrid between the two, with a roasted Cornish Hen, finger sandwiches, pizza and a strawberry shortcake forming a part of the banquet. I remember a time when viewers wondered where in the world GochiUsa was set, and some folks had found the different elements in the setting to be quite disorienting.\n\nGochiUsa‘s mish-mash of cultures was meant to, beyond any doubt, show how irrespective of where in the world one is, what matters most is being able to spend time with the people that mean the most to oneself. Christmas is the ideal time to show this message, and GochiUsa absolutely nails this idea in its Christmas episode – working together for the first time at Rabbit House and then spending the evening together would produce memories of immeasurable value.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the Christmas episode was an anime-only story, as was the storyline where Midori loses her fountain pen. The anime diverges from the manga, and the first five volumes happen entirely during the summer. Volumes five and six correspond to BLOOM, and it is in the sixth volume’s later chapters that Christmas finally arrives. The choice to move the seasons around and space things out mean that the anime begins to tell a different story than the manga, but at the same time, the additional creative freedom allows GochiUsa‘s anime adaptation to foreshadow future events and focus on what the producers believed to be important, allowing the anime to tell a more heartfelt and emotionally-satisfying story relative to the manga, which is comedy oriented.\n\nThis is why the producers had such a fun time with their own Christmas episode: volume six didn’t release until November 2017, and so, this gave them complete creative freedom to present the Christmas episode however they liked. The manga did not foreshadow what would come next, and it becomes clear that, even if Chiya, Sharo, Megu and Maya and the others don’t wear the Rabbit House uniform, they’re still together in spirit. This acts as a superb way of giving everyone a chance to work together. GochiUsa‘s success was such that the series would be able to adapt things for the third season.\n\nWhile the anime does deviate from the manga, the writers were also certain to keep the 4-koma style comedy, which is visible when Cocoa falls asleep rather in Chino’s room. After the surprise of seeing Cocoa wears off, Chino prepares for her day and shares a conversation with Rize, before Cocoa rushes in and expresses her surprise that Santa ended up visiting her, too. As the penultimate episode to GochiUsa‘s first season, this Christmas story showed that the writers were more than capable of filling in the gaps and telling their own stories, using the change of seasons to accentuate the characters’ experiences and memories without breaking away from the events seen in the original manga.\n\nWith this post in the books, we’re very nearly done with my revisit of GochiUsa, and this also means that the spring season is very nearly at a close. The summer solstice is actually just a day away now, and from tomorrow onwards, the days will begin to shorten again. Although it is a bit late in the game to be saying this, I am hoping that readers are finding these GochiUsa posts to be helpful – longtime readers will know that I’m very fond of the series, and since the second season, I’ve always written about the series in an episodic fashion. Until now, the first season was the only series that remained unexplored, and I figured that revisiting the first season on a per-episode basis was an appropriate way to commemorate this milestone.\n\nBecause of the original assumption that the anime would end after one season, GochiUsa‘s production team had sought to pack as much as they could into twelve episodes and show the progression of the seasons so that the groundwork for what came next would be laid down. Despite the change in framing and ordering of various events, the anime never loses its step, as all of the characters and their experiences still proceed in a very natural, plausible manner. Ahead of Christmas, Cocoa shows that one of her great joys is bringing smiles to others, and this is why she’s so drawn to the idea of playing Santa Claus for Chino. While she may appear selfish and easily distracted, Cocoa is ultimately motivated by a ceaseless desire to bring happiness to the people around her, and this is most visible in Christmas. However, at this point in the story, Cocoa is still slowly maturing. Her heart’s in the right place, but there are times when her being the little sister shows. This manifests as Cocoa falls asleep in Chino’s room after delivering her gift, and while she’s thus unable to complete her wish of surprising Chino pleasantly, her gesture is still conveyed. In this way, GochiUsa shows how intention matters more than outcomes – because her heart’s in the right place, all Cocoa needs to do is improve her game to do what she intends to accomplish. This does end up happening as Cocoa slowly matures throughout GochiUsa, and by the third season, Cocoa proves herself to be dedicated and competent without giving up the optimistic and bubbly traits that define her character. Setting the stage for this is important, and in retrospect, because GochiUsa‘s first season establishes this, the third season’s revisit of this concept allows Christmas to feel a little more luxurious, richer in spirit. The staff mention in their commentary that it was fun to decorate the half-timbered town and Rabbit House for Christmas, and while things look great in the first season, BLOOM‘s Christmas decorations completely blow anything seen in this first season out of the water. The shift in details and visuals are meant to parallel Cocoa’s own growth, showing how her learnings and time spent with Chino, Rize, Chiya, Sharo, Megu and Maya allow her to deliver an even grander experience the second time around in a manner that is a befitting of show of how far she’s come.\n\n“Teachers have three loves: love of learning, love of learners, and the love of bringing the first two loves together.” –Scott Hayden\n\nWhen Cocoa and Chiya begin preparing for their exams, Maya and Megu visit Rabbit House to keep Chino company. Rize wonders if she’ll star mixing everyone up and dubs the three Chimame. Chino, Maya and Megu object to this name, but over the course of the day, Maya and Megu settle right in at Rabbit House – the pair help as baristas while Rize runs the kitchen. However, Chino begins to miss Cocoa and inadvertently makes a large number of hot chocolates as a result. After the workday wraps up, Rize takes Chino, Maya and Megu to the town pool, where they enjoy a water gun fight and run into Midori. At Ama Usa An, Cocoa helps Chiya run things, and because the pair are so similar, they run things very well. Sharo arrives later to join their study session and becomes exasperated when Cocoa and Chiya begin studying in unusual ways. As the evening settles in, Rize returns home, leaving Chino to have a sleepover with Maya and Megu. Quite separately, after a full day’s worth of study, Cocoa stays over with Chiya and Sharo. The next day, snow begins falling over the half-timbered town, and when Rize arrives at Rabbit House, she’s incensed to learn that Chino, Maya and Megu are messing around. Chino comments that such a stunt is likely only to work on Cocoa. With this, the tenth episode is in the books, and GochiUsa‘s final quarter would’ve been well under way a decade earlier. By this point in the season, GochiUsa had sufficiently developed all of the characters such that the story is able to begin putting different combinations of characters together and portraying the outcomes to viewers – this tenth episode’s single largest contribution is hinted at in its title: Chino, Maya and Megu are the central focus in this episode, and for the first time, Chino is able to interact with Rize her friends without Cocoa hanging around, which completely changes the dynamics within GochiUsa. With Cocoa around, there’s never a dull moment, and so, when she goes off to hang out at Ama Usa An and study, life at Rabbit House suddenly feels a great deal quieter. This is why Chino ends up inviting Maya and Megu over, and even with her best friends around, it becomes clear that a part of Chino longs for the energy and excitement that Cocoa brings to the table. Seeing this, Rize ends up taking the initiative to help Chino raise her spirits, and in the process, Rize would come to act as a role model for everyone.\n\nIn creating the Chimame Corps, Rize reaches a milestone moment in GochiUsa – when Rize had first met Chino, she’d intimidated Chino with her no-nonsense, disciplined and strict manner. To persuade Chino that she wasn’t as scary as Chino thought, Rize would end up creating a hand-crafted stuffed rabbit for Chino, and since then, the pair have gotten along as friends, rather than a timid superior and spirited subordinate. By the time Rize meets Maya and Megu, she’s become aware that being all-business isn’t likely to work, and she regards them the same way she does Chino. However, seeing how Chino’s bothered by Cocoa’s absence, even in her friends’ presence, Rize worries about Chino and goes about keeping everyone busy – this is why Rize suggests going to the pool with everyone. After a hard day’s work, relaxing in hot springs would be quite welcome, and the outing represents a change of pace from routine, giving Chino a new memory to treasure. Rize’s ability to organise and look after people younger than herself, keeping them in line, but also treating them well, becomes visible in this episode, and in Dear My Sister, this side of Rize reappears. Similarly, when Chino becomes concerned about singing a solo part during her school’s choral recital, Rize devises a vigourous training regiment that helps Chino to sing more loudly, and with more confidence. By BLOOM, Rize shows that she has all of the traits to be successful as a teacher: she knows how to motivate those around her, leads by example and also rewards effort. Chiya had been concerned with a marathon, and to help Chiya improve her stamina, Rize decides to use stamp cards to show Chiya her progress. All of these traits show that Rize would make an excellent teacher, and GochiUsa had incrementally built up to this moment. Her career choice did not just appear overnight, but instead, it was the result of self-reflection. Through her interactions with the Chimame Corps, Rize was able to gain a deeper understanding of the occupation that makes her happy, and her choice in being a primary school instructor is fitting. Rize is very active, loves finding ways of motivating people, and her love of all things cute meant that she had no trouble in getting along with the Chimame Corps. Showing these early moments sets the stage for the character development that would lead Rize down her chosen path.\n\nScreenshots and Commentary\n\nA major part of the journey in GochiUsa was in showing how different social groups all end up merging into one as the series progressed. In the beginning, Maya and Megu primarily hung out with Chino, while Cocoa, Chiya, Sharo and Rize tended to hang out together with Chino. Over time, Maya and Megu begin fitting right in with the others. For Rize, it wasn’t always this easy to remember names, and she initially dubs the three Chimame (Chino, Maya and Megu) for convenience’s sake. The three don’t take kindly to the name initially, and this is unsurprising, since chimame (血豆, jyutping hyut3 dau6) translates directly to “blood blister” in English.\n\nWhile Rize’s nickname for Chino, Maya and Megu isn’t particularly flattering, that she comes up with it on the spot shows a willingness to learn new names. For me, recalling names is an iterative process: I will not be able to recall from memory the names of people I’ve met, but I have no trouble in naming the people I interact with regularly. There are some people who have a talent for names and faces, but I’m not one of them. As GochiUsa wears on, Chino, Maya and Megu become more receptive to the name, as it comes to represent an aspect of their friendship with Rize.\n\nEarly on in GochiUsa, Megu and Maya’s interests and traits aren’t immediately known to viewers. However, through the characters’ actions, one could still gain a reasonable handle on them. Megu is more similar to Cooca, being kind and graceful, while Maya is more energetic and mischievous. That Maya references skill points and levelling up shows that she’s a big fan of video games, and here, she supposes that for now, while she’s allowed to wear Rize’s uniform, she’s not quite ready to handle Rize’s model gun and knife. Megu and Chino’s reactions similarly offer insight into their personalities: Megu seems to be more go-with-the-flow, and GochiUsa establishes that Chino has less patience for hijinks.\n\nAs Maya and Megu are middle school students, they add depth to GochiUsa – there’s a chance for each of Cocoa, Chiya, Rize and Sharo to be a reliable seniors for them, and this process accelerates everyone’s growth. In Cocoa’s case, she’s the youngest of four siblings and so, has grown accustomed to being coddled, so when there’s a moment for her to be like her role model, Cocoa does not hesitate to take it. Although Cocoa’s competence is sometimes called into question, her intentions are sincere, and Cocoa does eventually end up finding her footing.\n\nRize is a year older than Cocoa, Chiya and Sharo, and so, even with her peers, she is able to lead and encourage them. When it comes to Chimame, Rize strives to put on a disciplined front, but all too often, she finds herself letting another side of her show because of how adorable Chino, Maya and Megu can be. During a quiet moment at Rabbit House, after everyone rolls with the twintail hairstyle, Maya challenges Megu to identify the real Rize. Here, Megu shows that she’s got a very earnest and sincere personality.\n\nBack at Rabbit House, things are moderately busy, and Chimame are doing their best to keep the customers happy. Cocoa’s absence is noticeable enough that Chino begins to make hot chocolates. The notion of being “Cocoa-sick” makes its first appearance here, and while Cocoa’s presence is generally counted as a bit of a nuisance, even this early in GochiUsa, Chino subconsciously admits that she misses Cocoa. Similarly, Rize indicates she knows Chino well enough to immediately identify what’s going on. Chimame help to drink the extra hot chocolates to round out the day.\n\nWhen Rize has trouble understanding what Maya is saying, Megu steps in and helps her to interpret things. She’s surprised by how close Maya and Megu are, and Chino explains that the pair can communicate telepathically, before wishing that she could do the same with Rize, as this would improve efficiency at Rabbit House dramatically. Rize comments on how it is possible to use non-verbal communications as soldiers do via hand signals, but Chino declines.\n\nAt the time, viewers were split on whether or not Maya and Megu were genuinely telepathic, or if their ability to accurately assess what was on the other’s mind came about as a result of the long time they’ve spent together. However, it appears that the latter holds true; Maya reveals that ever since Chino told her and Megu about the town’s pool, both of them had been itching to go. The focus on minutiae is one of the reasons why internet discussions about GochiUsa at the time weren’t particularly illuminating – rather than allowing the anime to explain its intentions, some viewers (especially those of TV Tropes) insisted their own interpretations took precedence over the show’s intentions.\n\nAccording to Memorial Blend, that Chino gets distracted by some rabbits near the pool was a deliberate choice to show that she’s becoming more like Cocoa. This scene was a deliberate inclusion, one that sought to show how much of an influence Cocoa had. Based on what Memorial Blend states, GochiUsa was originally planned to run for a single season, and as such, the staff sought to fit in these details so that notions of fateful encounters and growth could be conveyed. Viewers of the time skated completely over these details; period discussions fixated on Cocoa’s talents with mathematics, and one viewer wondered, “[do] anime characters ever study something that isn’t horribly bad English or Math consisting of ‘use this formula here’?”, before claiming that “[reciting] numbers is about memory, not math.”\n\nThe reason why mathematics and English are chosen for anime is simple enough: math is a field that most people are turned off by, and English lends itself to certain jokes. Both are easy enough to work into a study session without demanding specialised knowledge (as an example, I can’t predict the product of various oxidation-reduction reactions anymore, and recalling the implications of knocking out specific enzymes involved in phosphorylation isn’t something I can do off the top of my head). On this note, Cocoa’s ability to count prime numbers is, contrary to what TV Tropes’ members belief, a show of her talents. There are several algorithms for generating prime numbers, and even one of the simplest, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, is quite complex to work by hand: with a O(n log log n) time complexity, computing it in one’s head for increasingly large numbers demands excellent mental prowess.\n\nSpeaking to the different intentions behind this pool outing, Rize’s gone with a sleek one-piece swimsuit and is content to unwind this evening, while Maya and Megu enjoy the pool’s thermal waters. Eventually, Maya and Megu persuade Rize into joining a water gun fight. Quite separately, Cocoa shares a conversation with Tippy – this is her first time having friends over, and she’s not confident as to whether or not she can be a good host for her best friends. Since Chino figures she’s just speaking with her grandfather, she’s able to be honest, and she explains that until now, she’d counted on Cocoa to handle things and keep spirits high.\n\nMemorial Blend‘s commentary was that this episode’s main theme was actually about how Chino’s come to take Cocoa for granted and subconsciously allowed herself to let Cocoa drive excitement in her life. In Cocoa’s absence, Chino becomes more passive, but even just meeting Cocoa has perceptibly changed Chino, leading her to become aware of her own traits. Here, Chino unexpectedly receives advice from Midori, who’s also chilling at the pool. She simply suggests that Chino be herself, and her friends will accept her all the same. Shocked, Chino asks if Midori comes often, and the latter replies that good story ideas can come from everywhere before drifting off.\n\nThe thought of engaging in a water gun fight fires Rize right up, and while Rize is no John Wick, she shows that she’s also influenced by the films she watches. A memory flits back into my mind – when I was at Laval Virtual 2016, the academic conference was timed to coincide with a Virtual Reality exhibition, and I spent some time playing with the best VR technology of its time at the exhibitions. Most memorable was a game with the first-generation HTC Vive. Back then, the headsets were wired, required special sensors to be set up in a rig around the play area, and one needed another person to help them get the gear on. I remember playing several shooters, including Arizona Sunshine, and because I’m similar to Rize in some regards, I drew a small crowd when I played in a tactical manner, completing the games without getting hit.\n\nFor Chino, a lack of confidence in her ability means she’d prefer to leave Rize to do the shooting, and she’d prefer to camp. However, it turns out Maya and Megu have also run into Midori, and Midori figured it’s time to take Tippy hostage. Rize’s reflexes allow her to take Midori and Megu out, and Megu unintentionally betrays Maya in the process. I imagine that for Rize, she also shoots Tippy because this was meant to take away any chance of negotiations: “shooting the hostage”, as it’s called, is done to take away any leverage a hostage-taker might have.\n\nThis water gun fight, although simple, speaks to everyone’s character. Rize is all about getting things done and sometimes charges in without worrying about the consequences, while Maya loves to persuade others to do the work for her, but by not doing the work herself, things can backfire. Megu, on the other hand, is a little too honest and may accidentally hurt her friends in the process: Maya’s proven quite elusive, but Megu points Rize in the right direction. Here, after being spotted, Megu floats back to the pool’s edge in a manner reminiscent of how characters in Hidamari Sketch are animated. Some folks have previously recommended Hidamari Sketch to me, and I’ve completed the first season, finding it to be quite enjoyable, as well as answering some questions about Madoka Magica. If there’s enough interest, I may write about Hidamari Sketch in the future.\n\nTippy becomes a sodden mess after getting soaked – in a manner reminiscent of Spy × Family‘s Bond, Tippy also loses much of his volume when wet. Back at Ama Usa An, Cocoa’s continued to plough on with prime numbers until she notices a photo album, and upon opening it, she finds a picture of Chiya and Sharo on their first day of secondary school. Cocoa notices that Chiya’s looking pensive, and Sharo reveals that one of Chiya’s worries was being separated from the people close to her. None of the GochiUsa characters are without flaws, and this helped to accentuate the fact that the story in GochiUsa was about incremental growth through appreciation of everyday experiences.\n\nAfter an afternoon’s swimming, Chimame pick up drinks, and comment on how the day felt like a fun physical education class after Megu accidentally addresses Rize as sensei. The moment marks the first time Rize is told she has teacher-like traits, setting in motion the encouragement that will see her pursue a career in education. Quite separately, Midori also reveals that her biggest weakness is adhering to timelines: even the mere thought of being called sensei sends a shiver down her spine because Rin Mate, her editor, is very strict about Midori finishing her work on time. Indeed, when Rin makes an appearance in GochiUsa‘s second season, Midori tries her utmost to avoid being found and made to work.\n\nIn the end, Maya and Megu have an excellent time over at Chino’s – after their bath, Maya expresses an interest in playing a game, but Chino only has puzzles meant for one, and chess. Takahiro shows up with a board game, and subsequently, Chimame have a pleasant evening of board games and conversation. Chino’s interests do end up rubbing off on her friends, though, and by BLOOM, Maya indicates that she’d like to play chess with Chino some time. Chino ends up sending a message over to Chiya saying that they had a solid evening, and contemplates calling Cocoa to see how she’s doing.\n\nHaving studied well into evening, Cocoa and Sharo stay over at Chiya’s place. Before Chino can call, Cocoa calls Chino to check in, and during this short conversation, Chino credits Cocoa with having given her the encouragement to take initiative, allowing her to experience a side of life she had previously thought to be out of her reach. Cocoa decides to send Chino a picture of herself, Chiya and Sharo with straight bangs, but accidentally sends it to Rize, who wonders if this hairstyle is what’s in. Here, I remark that accidentally sending stuff to the wrong person is an all-too-relatable experience, and even in things like WhatsApp, people accidentally can put things in the wrong group.\n\nAfter arriving at Rabbit House the next morning, Rize is shocked to see Chimame pretending to be a “little sister” café. Unsurprisingly, Rize tells everyone off, and Chino’s comment about how such a stunt would only impress Cocoa speaks to the fact that she’s slowly coming around regarding Cocoa: although Rize is a great person to be around, Cocoa offers a different sort of presence that Chino’s become fond of. By the middle of June ten years earlier, The Giant Walkthrough Brain was well under way now, and Jay Ingram had presented us with a request: to build an integrated video and image player in the Unity project. Back then, only Unity Pro gave developers these options, so I accepted the upgrade and began learning all I could about rendering media in screen space and building an efficient navigation tool: by creating an integrated media viewer, this eliminated the need to Alt-Tab out of Unity show into a separate player, improving immersion dramatically.\n\nThe passage of the seasons in GochiUsa is subtle; with the characters and their everyday lives dominating the story, it becomes easy to forget that the half-timbered town is a living, breathing entity that acts as a unique backdrop for the characters’ day-to-day. Cocoa arrives in the half-timbered town in the spring, and spring gives way to summer in the blink of an eye. By the time Midori becomes a regular at Rabbit House, autumn sets in, and snow begins to usher in winter shortly after. The transition through the seasons in GochiUsa was meant to show the passage of time, accentuating how the characters change over time. By the tenth episode, Cocoa has settled into life in the half-timbered town and is no longer getting lost, and Chino’s begun to accept Cocoa (even if she doesn’t say it outright). However, the seasons also speak to one small detail – the anime actually breaks from the order of events seen in the manga, and the choice to portray all of the seasons indicates that GochiUsa was meant to be a standalone experience. With many anime adaptations, studios budget out enough resources to make a single season, and then, depending on sales figures, a second season might be made. Had GochiUsa ended in the winter, with Chino finally showing that she cares about Cocoa through her actions, the story would’ve been thematically sound, and the series would’ve also given viewers a chance to see the half-timbered town throughout the year. In the present, viewers know that GochiUsa was very successful, allowing it to receive a second and third season. The continuations further expand on life in the half-timbered town and delve further into how everyone grows and matures as a result of their time spent together, and by returning to the first season, it is clear that even if it was intended to be self-contained, GochiUsa would ultimately lay down the groundwork for the story ahead, showing the level of thought and attention paid to details in both the characters and their experiences. This is why GochiUsa ends up enduring after all this time: the series is far more than just a slice-of-life comedy, and as Cocoa, Chino and the others spend more time together, GochiUsa becomes an iyashikei, one which is comparable to Tamayura in terms of emotional impact and immersion.\n\n“We do not have to rely on memories to recapture the spirit of those we have loved and lost – they live within our souls in some perfect sanctuary which even death cannot destroy.” –Nan Witcomb\n\nOn a lazy afternoon, Cocoa dozes off and dreams of the time when she encountered Chino’s grandfather and Tippy for the first time; back then, Chino’s grandfather was lamenting how he was barely able to keep Rabbit House afloat and wished he could be a rabbit, unaware that the younger Cocoa had heard him. Back in the present, Rize is torn about whether or not she’d like to accept a role to play Christine in her school’s rendition of The Phantom of the Opera. Worried that she’s not sufficiently lady-like for the position, she visits Ama Usa An and asks Chiya for help. Chiya is all too happy to help out, and when Sharo drops by, she ends up helping, too. However, Rize feels that it would be quite difficult to change herself, and it turns out that at Rize’s school, her classmates ended up rewriting Rize’s role to fit her personality better. Feeling as though her efforts were wasted, Rize promises to take another role in the future. Later, while returning home from classes, Chino runs into Midori, who announces that she’s now unemployed. Chino allows her to work at Rabbit House until she gets back on her feet, and, inspired by Takahiro, Midori decides to try and offer advice to Rabbit House’s patrons, although she is saddened by the fact that Rabbit House’s original owner is no longer around to offer her feedback for her stories. While spending time with Chino and the others, Midori reveals that she had lost her favourite fountain pen and fell into a slump, unable to find inspiration for her writing. Chino offers to help Midori look for it; Chino and Cocoa return to the park where Midori had first met Cocoa to search for the missing pen. After Cocoa gets distracted by a feral bunny, Tippy manages to find the pen. Chino wistfully remarks that there’s no problem if Midori knows the truth about Tippy. Later that evening, Tippy provides his thoughts on Midori’s latest novel, and while Midori believes Chino’s grandfather is possessing one of Chino’s stuffed animals to communicate with her, Midori’s inspiration returns to her. GochiUsa‘s ninth episode is a personal favourite: it is the most poignant of the first season and is significant for establishing the direction that GochiUsa would eventually take. GochiUsa is very gentle with its messages, incorporating a great deal of humour into each episode to ensure that viewers smile alongside the characters as they learn something new. However, until now, the messages in each episode pertain to common, everyday experiences like friendship, conflict resolution, open-mindedness and honesty. By tackling the issue of Chino’s grandfather and what happened to him, GochiUsa begins to explore the side of life that might not be so easy to make sense of.\n\nBefore delving into such a profound topic, GochiUsa‘s ninth episode starts its first vignette with a more benign topic: after Rize is offered a part in the school play, she’s conflicted about trying to change her personality to fit the role. On one hand, Rize is very comfortable with who she is: Rize makes no effort to conceal the fact that she loves all things military, and in fact, her boisterous and confident nature is a signature part of who she is. However, Rize does have an affinity for all things cute and lady-like, and in contrast with her usual forwardness, she’s very shy about showing this side of her to the world. Although Rize is open-minded enough to try and act in a way contrary to her usual self, she feels that doing this feels awkward because it isn’t who she is. In the end, Rize is given a script that allows her to play to her strengths: Rize is confident in who she is, but at the same time, others have also accepted her for who she is. This outcome shows that in GochiUsa, acceptance is the norm, but the tradeoff of this is that people might not be given a chance to explore and try something new. The lesson GochiUsa sought to convey here is that, while it is important to embrace people for who they are, it is also important to let people make discoveries for themselves and step out of their comfort zone. GochiUsa later shows that Rize’s tough, no-nonsense personality is actually a facade she puts on: she genuinely enjoys all things military, but this also allows her to keep a certain amount of distance from people she’s unfamiliar with. By saying that she wanted to try being more lady-like and perform such characters in plays, Rize implicitly suggests that she wouldn’t object to becoming closer to the people around her. By Dear My Sister, a conversation that Rize has with Sharo and Chiya shows she’s envious of Cocoa’s ability to be herself and get along with everyone by default, showing how at the end of the day, Rize also longs for companionship and would prefer to get along with people, rather than intimidate them. This side of Rize will continued to be explored in the tenth episode, when Rize has a chance to interact with Maya and Megu without Cocoa around, and towards the end of the ninth episode’s first half, Rize remarks that she’d jump at the chance to play more lady-like characters, showing a certain amount of readiness to present a side of her that’s more kind and caring than her wont. With viewers feeling a degree of warmth from how Rize’s situation ends up being resolved, the ninth episode segues into a topic that GochiUsa had been waiting for the right time to convey.\n\nThe topic of Chino’s grandfather and how he came to inhabit Tippy’s body was something that intrigued viewers from the very first episode. When Cocoa and Chino’s grandfather first meet, Tippy is just an ordinary, albeit very fluffy, angora rabbit. Upon overhearing a remark Chino’s grandfather makes, Cocoa casts a spell on him and suggests that he may be a rabbit someday. This led a number of viewers to conclude that Cocoa was “somehow involved” in Tippy’s current circumstances, and this misconception has endured to this day. Although the ninth episode does not provide a mechanism for how this happened (and in fact, even BLOOM chooses to leave the topic alone during its seventh episode), it decisively answers the elephant in the room. Chino knows that Tippy houses her grandfather’s spirit, and Tippy can freely communicate with Chino. This is why Chino is so fond of Tippy; Tippy isn’t just a reminder of her grandfather, but rather, is her grandfather. Irrespective of how Tippy came to be a vessel for Chino’s grandfather, the fact that her grandfather’s wisdom and knowledge continues to live on means that even at her loneliest, Chino is never really alone, and by the time Midori becomes an increasingly regular presence at Rabbit House, Chino realises that Midori was also someone who had a positive connection with her grandfather. As a student, Midori had come to Chino’s grandfather for feedback on her writing, and he always obliged. This is why, after Tippy finds Midori’s missing fountain pen, Chino wonders why he’s unwilling to let Midori in on the secret: Chino is well aware of the fact that her grandfather’s wisdom had gotten her through some difficult times and believes that this might be helpful for those around her, too. In spite of her taciturn and reserved manner, Chino is someone who’s kind and considerate of those around her, and being willing to help comfort Midori is a sign that if given the choice, Chino would rather be more outspoken and able to actively help those around her, the same way Cocoa does. Given how this episode chose to portray Tippy’s circumstances, it is clear that how Chino’s grandfather came to reside in Tippy’s body is irrelevant, but on the other hand, the episode begins presenting the idea that one’s elders and ancestors can live on to provide help to those who seek it, and that the wisdom from those who have passed on continues to endure even when they are no longer present in this world. BLOOM would revisit this idea in greater detail, but here in GochiUsa‘s ninth episode, a slump that Midori falls into gives Tippy a chance to lend her his wisdom. In doing so, GochiUsa shows that there’s a great deal more to the story than coffee and bunnies – the world is vast enough that there are some things in life that remain a mystery despite our efforts to understand them, but the things we do not understand can also be helpful.\n\nScreenshots and Commentary\n\nIn its director’s commentary, Memorial Blend indicates that Cocoa does not have any recollection of meeting Chino’s grandfather or Tippy, and despite being a child, Cocoa was still outgoing and had no trouble with talking to other people. This flashback marks the first time Mocha is seen, and the decision was made to show Mocha because it would give the impression that as a child, Cocoa was very much the younger sister and counted on Mocha for many things. Although this flashback outwardly appears trivial, it does much for the exposition in GochiUsa, setting the stage for several important developments that the ninth episode covers.\n\nIn retrospect, every season of GochiUsa was of a consistently solid quality, and every season similarly had one episode that stood out for its thematic elements. For GochiUsa‘s first season, the ninth episode holds this particular distinction: its first half begins ordinarily enough, but its second half speaks to themes of wishing for wisdom and guidance from those who are no longer present. In BLOOM, this was especially apparent with the seventh episode – on Hallow’s Eve, Cocoa runs into the spirit of Saki Kafuu and ends up picking up a few magic tricks from her, and when she demonstrates a successful trick to Chino, Chino is reminded of her mother.\n\nThis episode had suggested that Cocoa’s presence is bringing the light and warmth back into Chino’s world the way her mother had done when she was a child, and some of Tippy’s remarks suggested that when his time had come, he opted to stay behind to look after Chino. The implications here are that Saki died before Chino’s grandfather did, and, rather than anything to do with Cocoa, Chino’s grandfather ended up inhabiting Tippy’s body because he wanted to keep an eye on Chino until she found her footing anew. The presence of supernatural elements in GochiUsa is subtle, more so than the likes of ARIA and Amanchu!, but its inclusion was meant to show viewers that certain parts of life lie beyond our comprehension.\n\nFor the most part, spirits and the supernatural do not lie at the forefront of GochiUsa, and the ninth episode begins in a conventional manner – Rize’s sharing a conversation with Cocoa and Chino about her upcoming play, and Cocoa remarks that she once played a dog. Curiously enough, the Nendoroid of Cocoa comes with the parts that let folks to recreate this moment. The Cocoa Nendoroid was originally released in December 2017, after the second season of GochiUsa ended, and as such, also comes with the Sony Cybershot that Cocoa is seen using whilst trying to get a picture of Chino smiling. The Nendoroid was re-released in November 2020, during BLOOM‘s run.\n\nThe thought of playing an elegant character intrigues, but also embarrasses Rize – with her forward and confident personality, Rize doesn’t have the same characteristics as someone like Chiya or Sharo, who are both refined and lady-like in their own manner. After stress causes Rize to break a plate, she decides to take Cocoa’s suggestion and ends up swinging by Ama Usa An. To add comedy to the moment, Cocoa decides to send Chiya a message that causes Chiya to assume that Rize’s aim is to destroy their shop. Previously, I’ve mentioned that all humour is driven by context and timing. When Cocoa remarks that Rize is “on a suicide mission”, she means that it’s something extremely difficult for Rize, but also one where Rize is aware of the risks.\n\nComedy thus comes from the fact that Chiya immediately comes to the conclusion that Rize wants to destroy Ama Usa An; once Rize arrives and explains things to Chiya, Chiya is determined to do her best for Rize. The idea of dramatically changing one’s personality and traits to fit expectations is a common enough in anime – a similar moment was seen in Non Non Biyori when it was decided that Natsumi is too brusque, and the other girls try to get her to wear a dress and act more politely. This was ultimately unsuccessful, as Natsumi found it to be too stuffy and uncomfortable. For Rize, she similarly would rather be herself, but there are times when she also wants to dress and act more elegantly than she usually does.\n\nAfter Chiya is done, Rize looks in the mirror and realises she’s basically Rozé: although she may now look a little more like Christine of The Phantom of the Opera, Chiya feels that Rize must also act the part. The Phantom of the Opera is a very famous work: Gaston Leroux’s original novel was published in 1909, and Christine is the female lead, a Swedish soprano singer that both the Phantom and Raoul are in love with. In the originals, Christine’s story is that she becomes conflicted by her feelings for both the Phantom, who instructs her in the way of music, and Raoul, her childhood friend. To properly play Christine, Rize would need to master expressing sympathy and indecision: Christine was originally set to marry her childhood friend, but the Phantom’s respect for her music causes her to pity him and eventually love him despite his shadowy nature.\n\nIn reality, Rize is both decisive and firm: once she has her mind set to something, she doesn’t back down. Of course, GochiUsa is not intended to be an accurate interpretation of this iconic novel (or the subsequent musicals) – once Chiya decides she wants to join in on the party and do some acting of her own, Rize is left confused as to what’s going on. Midori overhears their conversation and comments on how nice it is to be young and able to wholly put one’s heart to something. Her presence defuses the tension that had built up.\n\nMidori is very fond of hanging out at Ama Usa An – when Chino had found herself jealous her friends were so quick to get along with Cocoa and Rize, she’d come to Ama Usa An to talk to Chiya and similarly found Midori here. It turns out that Midori is fond of the sweets here, and in turn, she’s also willing to help Chiya come up with elaborate names for the menu items. For Midori, her favourite part about helping Chiya (and indeed, anyone who may need it) seems to stem from happiness at seeing people smile. Even at this point in time, Midori’s having a tough time coming up with any ideas, acting as a thoughtful setup for the episode’s second half.\n\nWhen Sharo arrives at Ama Usa An, she’s initially worried about being attacked by Anko, but instead, finds herself frightened by the phantom mask Chiya’s using to help Rize prepare for her role. The moment Rize mentions she needs Sharo’s help, all of Sharo’s fear vanishes on the spot, and she sets about doing her best for Rize’s sake. That Sharo’s leporiphobia can be managed whenever she’s motivated and determined enough gives viewers a bit of precedence that over time, Sharo could become less fearful of rabbits. When asked, however, Sharo only comments that the only reason why she conducts herself in this manner is to fit in and get by.\n\nOne interesting touch is that, after meeting Sharo, Midori seems to be able to churn out a new manuscript in record time. Overhearing Sharo, Midori wonders about what sort of story could be written about the struggles of a waitress and likens them to idols and fighters. This ends up being the basis of her next smash-hit, “Caffeine Fighter”, whose protagonist is modelled purely on Sharo. For the time being, while Midori has an idea, she’s unable to put pen to paper, and observant viewers will have noticed that Midori is using a generic fountain pen.\n\nBack at Rabbit House, Cocoa and Chino begin panicking when they imagine that Rize might get so into drama and acting that she ditches Rabbit House. That Chino comes along shows how Cocoa has a talent for geting others caught up in things. When the pair make it to Ama Usa An, they’re surprised to find “Rozé” there. The joke here is that, perhaps in embarrassment, Rize is able to immediately change gears and put on a show convincing enough to fool Cocoa and Chino. The shift in Rize’s manner surprises Sharo and Chiya – the pair previously had trouble convincing Rize to act more ladylike.\n\nIn the end, Rize is disappointed that her classmates had written her role in a way that fits her style – photographs of Rize’s performance has her drawing her gun and using a fragmentation grenade on the Phantom, which is a radical departure from Leroux’s story. A confident, self-actualised Christine would not be drawn to the Phantom and remain true to her original love, so such a rendition of The Phantom Of The Opera would be amusing enough to watch. When Rize expresses annoyance that all of her effort went to waste and promises to try again, Cocoa and Chino immediately express opposition to this idea.\n\nBy this point in GochiUsa, the summer has given way to autumn, and one day, when Chino’s returning home from classes, a paper airplane gently collides with her. Chino finds herself running into Midori, who reveals that she’s unemployed and has stopped writing novels. This news comes as a shock to Chino. For viewers, it would’ve been just as large of a shock – Midori is evidently very successful in what she does, and from her choice of words, she’s also quite passionate and engaged with her career choice.\n\nMidori’s family name, 青山 (“Blue Mountain”) originates from a clan hailing from the Gunma Prefecture. For Cantonese speakers, 青山 can also refer to Hong Kong’s Tsing Shan (Castle Peak), a famous granite hill located in the New Territories that stands 583 metres above its surroundings. However, most people of Hong Kong descent will immediately think of Castle Peak Hospital in Tuen Mun – opened in 1961, it’s Hong Kong’s oldest and largest psychiatric institution, and because of its function, Hong Kongers use 青山 as a slang to refer to someone who’s insane or crazy. The dramatically different backgrounds creates this bit of comedy, although for non-Hong Kong viewers, this joke is lost.\n\nTo help Midori out, Chino decides to bring her back to Rabbit House and have her help around until she can get back on her feet. When she accidentally dons Cocoa’s uniform, Cocoa believes she’s been laid off for being late one too many times. Fortunately, this turns out to be a misunderstanding, and Chino hands Midori the correct outfit. Once things settle down, Midori explains her situation and also brings up Chino’s grandfather, whom she’d known back when she was a secondary student. As it turns out, Midori had come to Rabbit House often to write and get feedback when she was younger.\n\nAt Rabbit House, Midori feels completely at home, and she expresses a desire to meet Chino’s grandfather again. However, in this time, Chino’s grandfather had passed away. Midori comments on how she’d heard his voice a few days earlier at Ama Usa An, and Cocoa, unaware of Chino’s grandfather actually living on in Tippy, believes that Midori must be devastated by his passing. She instinctively hands Tippy to Midori, and Midori immediately takes a liking to Tippy, commenting on how the fur covering his eyes feels familiar and comforting. Tippy’s fluffier appearance here suggests that as Chino’s grandfather, he both knew Midori and was quite fond of her.\n\nWhen Midori catches the same scent of coffee on Tippy that Chino’s grandfather has, a wave of memories returns to her, and she finds it difficult to believe that he could be gone. This moment was the most poignant in GochiUsa, marking the first time that topics surrounding the dead have been brought up in the series. Accompanying the scene is the incidental piece, “Telling a Story”. It’s a sad, wistful piano piece that exudes a gentle sense of comfort, and amongst the songs on the soundtrack, this is one of my favourites. The piece is used again in BLOOM when Chino bursts into tears after being overwhelmed with emotion at the thought of Maya and Megu continuing to stay with her and help out at Rabbit House.\n\nThis is the most down viewers see Midori, but a few days later, she appears to have found a new spring in her step. When Chiya visits, Midori’s set up an advice booth – Midori was inspired by how Takahiro is able to talk with patrons and, enjoying the prospect of offering advice to others, decides to do the same for Rabbit House during the daylight hours. The change in tone is mirrored by the use of the song “Is that Kilimanjaro”, a cheerful and light-hearted piece that makes use of xylophone and flute to convey a happy tone. For me, this is probably the most iconic piece of incidental music in GochiUsa – each of the three seasons uses the song to some capacity, and I associate the song with Cocoa. The song is named after its first usage, when Cocoa arrives at Rabbit House and orders three coffees, one of which is a Kilimanjaro, but to Chino’s irritation, finds herself being completely unable to recognise them.\n\nCocoa mistakenly holds that Midori’s mysterious presence might be why no one’s spoken with her yet; Rabbit House appears to be very quiet during the day, and this is why Midori hasn’t had the chance to put her advice-giving skills to the test yet. Rize is shown serving one other customer, but otherwise, the place is quite quiet. While speaking with Midori, Cocoa’s got Tippy on her head – previously, this was Chino’s jam, so the fact that Cocoa can also do the same shows that she’s settled into Rabbit House quite well.\n\nIn typical GochiUsa fashion, Cocoa, Chiya and Chino decides to bring their own solution to the table: in order to make Midori look more approachable, Chino lays out her stuffed animals to make the advice booth area seem cuter, but Midori worries that she’ll be cursed. The anime doesn’t elaborate on what Midori means by this, and while I’m certain the moment was done for comedy’s sake, it is possible that the presence of anything looking at her sets difficult expectations, which Midori believes might cause her to choke.\n\nLater, Chiya brings Sharo to Rabbit House, and after meeting Midori, she’s treated to coffee. Although hesitant to drink it, the moment Rize mentions she blended it, Sharo immediately turns around and drinks it. It is unlikely that Rize was in on things – the moment simply represents yet another instance of how easily Sharo can be manipulated, unintentionally or not, whenever Rize is involved. While it’s said that Sharo’s mood changes based on the blend she drinks, there’s a scientific reason for why this can happen. This has nothing to do with variations to the chemistry behind different blends, but rather, because coffee is a stimulant and can amplify one’s emotions.\n\nSince Sharo was already feeling stressed about her finances and the fact that Anko keeps biting her, the coffee would simply help her to open up faster. Rize hears Sharo out and gives her pats, impressing Midori, who’d been longing to do exactly thus. What Midori is missing here is that Rize and Sharo know one another well, and so, Rize is able to reassure Sharo to the best of her ability. Without alcohol to help break the ice, one can imagine that people would be a little more reluctant to share their innermost secrets with a stranger. While this is going down, Cocoa capitalises on the moment to write a letter to Midori.\n\nThe moment Chino realises that Cocoa’s letter deals with her, she flushes so hard that the glow is visible from behind her. In retaliation, Chino sends a letter right back to Midori. Amidst the cheerful spirits at Rabbit House, Sharo recovers enough to ask if Midori was okay with suddenly changing careers. Since all of the tensions have now gone, the characters trust one another enough to be honest, and it is here that Midori reveals what had happened. It turns out that after losing the fountain pen Chino’s grandfather gave her, Midori’s motivation tanked.\n\nRize’s strong reaction to Midori stems from her earlier disappointment that she wasn’t able to put Midori’s advice to use – at Ama Usa An, Midori had commented on how important it was to never give up, and in reminding Midori of this, Rize shows that she’s someone who stands by her values. Once Midori tells the other of what had happened, and that she believes she lost her pen the same day she met Cocoa, Cocoa and Chino head out into the evening to search for Midori’s fountain pen. At first glance, such an occurrence is trivial, but the fact that Midori lost her pen the same day she meets Cocoa might speak to Cocoa’s talent for getting others lost in the moment.\n\nAlthough certainly a bad thing in the short term, in the very long term, such a chance encounter would be mutually beneficial to all parties: Cocoa and her friends gain the company of someone older than themselves to share wisdom with, and the carefree lives that Cocoa and her friends lead gives Midori the inspiration to write her stories. Once Cocoa and Chino reach the park, they begin searching for Midori’s fountain pen, and here, I noticed that, in contrast with the evenings seen in earlier episodes, this episode’s evenings have a cooler feel to them, and in other episodes, sunsets felt warmer. The reason for this is because this evening’s objective is a little more melancholy and introspective in nature.\n\nCocoa and Chino have no luck finding Midori’s fountain pen, and once Cocoa gets distracted by a bunny, Chino is left to search for it on her own. In the end, Tippy locates Midori’s fountain pen, a black pen with gold trim: the pen is briefly seen in Midori’s flashback when she reminisces about how Chino’s grandfather would provide feedback on her writing, but since she’s holding onto the pen, only the cap can be seen. In this way, viewers wouldn’t have a clear picture of what the pen looks like, putting them in the same position as Cocoa and Chino. This sets the stage for Tippy to find it: Chino’s grandfather would’ve known what the pen had looked like.\n\nTippy wants Chino to give Midori the pen, and here, it is revealed that Chino’s been keeping her grandfather’s secret for some time. Chino herself is comfortable with letting her friends know of what happened, but Chino’s grandfather is adamant that she preserve the secret for her sake. As Chino and Tippy reflect on things, the evening breeze picks up, and the expression on Tippy’s face is one of imploring. The effect the wind has on Tippy’s fur creates an eternal sense of longing, and while the dialogue does not elaborate further, BLOOM later would suggest that the soul of Chino’s grandfather ended up being housed in Tippy’s body because he had wanted to keep Chino company following her mother’s death.\n\nThroughout my posts on GochiUsa, I’ve referred to Chino’s grandfather and Tippy interchangeably. They previously had been separate entities, but for the present, I’ve oped"
