My name is Amanda Solloway and I am proud to be the Member of Parliament for Derby North since 2019, having also represented the constituency between 2015-2017.

I've lived in Derby for over 20 years and worked as a businesswoman, school governor and an active community volunteer.

During my previous tenure as MP, I had the privilege to be the PPS to the Secretary of State for International Development and I sat on the committees for Human Rights and then Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy. Since February 2020, I have been Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Science, Research and Innovation within the BEIS Department, which is such an honour. My portfolio also includes Space, Maritime, Intellectual Property, Industrial Strategy Delivery and Technology.

Being elected to represent the area you call home is the privilege of a lifetime. Getting the opportunity to do it twice is indescribable, and I am humbled that the people of Derby North have, once again, put their trust in me to be their representative in London.

Derby North is home to a wealth of people of all backgrounds, each person a thread in the tapestry that makes our community. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of them and aim to meet many more.

Derby North needs an MP who acts on their concerns and I aim to do so with some good Derbyshire common sense!
