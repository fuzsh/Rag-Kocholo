Following Derby County FC's decision to enter administration in September 2021 Solloway played a prominent role in the campaign to save the club from potential expulsion from the English Football League.[9] Amanda organised the formation of the "Team Derby" campaign, composed of other local MPs and Derby City Council, and facilitated meetings between "Team Derby", administrators Quantuma, the then Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston and the EFL on multiple occasions.[10][11] Solloway has credited helping to save the club from administration as her "single most important thing" she did while the MP for Derby North.[12]

From May to July 2022, Amanda has campaigned on behalf of constituents in Darley Abbey, following the closure of the Darley Abbey Bridge, for the installation of a temporary replacement.[13] Following news that Derby City Council had agreed to purchase the temporary structure and keep it in place until 2027, Solloway has campaigned for a permanent alternative instead.[14]This campaign included a visit to Darley Abbey by both the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Arts and Heritage Lord Parkinson in April 2024 the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Roads Guy Opperman in May 2024.[15]

Between July 5, 2022 and the 21st of March 2023, Solloway successfully campaigned for Derby to be chosen as the location for the Department for Transport's Great British Railways Headquarters.[16] Her efforts included asking constituents to vote for Derby by scanning a QR code printed on a T-shirt she wore at constituency events and by holding meetings with the Secretary of State for Transport Mark Harper and Minister of State for Rail and HS2 Huw Merriman.[17][18]

In October 2023, rollingstock manufacturer Alstom announced that its Derby factory Litchurch Lane could close if orders were not found to fill a production gap at the site, putting over 1,000 jobs at risk of redundancy.[19] Solloway described her work to address this as her "main priority" over the following eight months until, in June 2024, a deal between Alstom and Transport for London, financed by £220 million of Department for Transport funding was agreed for an order of 10 Elizabeth Line trains.[20] Over this period Solloway routinely met with the Secretary of State for Transport Mark Harper who stated Solloway "deserved a lot of credit for her absolutely tenacious campaigning" for a solution for Alstom's production gap.
