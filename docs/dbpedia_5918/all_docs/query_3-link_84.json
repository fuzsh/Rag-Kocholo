        "text": "At an event today, 3rd July, business and political leaders from throughout the East Midlands have gathered in Derby to launch a report titled “Full speed ahead: bringing high-speed rail to the East Midlands” that sets out an overwhelming case for the East Midlands to have high-speed rail.\n\nAmong those attending the launch which is being jointly hosted by Midlands Connect and Transport for the East Midlands are HS2 and Rail Minister Huw Merriman MP, who will be making a keynote speech, business chiefs, and senior politicians including Sir Peter Soulsby, Cllr Ben Bradley MP, Amanda Solloway MP and Toby Perkins MP.\n\nThe report outlines the benefits that will accrue from extending HS2 to the East Midlands and Sheffield as proposed in the Government's Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands (IRP).\n\nWhen integrated with other projects such as the Midlands Rail Hub and electrification of the Midland Main Line, extending HS2 to the East Midlands will bring the region's cities and towns closer to each other and to larger centres such as London and Birmingham.\n\nOnce HS2 is complete, an extra half-million people will be within 90 minutes by rail from Derby and an additional 600,000 people within 90 minutes of Chesterfield.\n\nThis will result in increased job opportunities for East Midlands residents and more trade for local businesses.\n\nAt the moment, Nottingham, Derby and Chesterfield can access an economy of around £250 million within 90 minutes by rail, but HS2 will increase that to over £550 million.\n\nFigures in the report show that HS2 Nottingham will benefit from having nearly double the number of jobs in high-value, rail-linked sectors within an hour by rail, and nearly four times the number of jobs within two hours.\n\nThe extension of HS2 will result in 74 stations throughout the East Midlands benefitting from improved journey times to and from London and Birmingham.\n\nThe reduced journey times will shift the location of major urban areas closer to the East Midlands. London will effectively move 60 miles north to Northamptonshire (relative to Derby, Chesterfield and Nottingham), whilst Birmingham will move 30 miles northeast to between Derby and Loughborough (relative to Nottingham).\n\nThese quicker journey times will benefit residents travelling to London for work, business or leisure.\n\nMaria Machancoses, CEO of Midlands Connect commented: “It's great to be here in Derby today, highlighting the importance of high-speed rail for this region. The East Midlands is an area so poorly served by rail at the moment; with these proposals in place connections from North to South, and East to West, will be quicker and easier.\n\n“The case for delivering HS2 from Birmingham to the East Midlands is overwhelming.”\n\nSir Peter Soulsby, Chair of Transport for East Midlands added: “The East Midlands boasts a resilient and thriving economy which is well placed to reap the benefits of major rail investment.\n\n“HS2 to the East Midlands is key priority for TfEM and will transform links to Birmingham and London.\n\n“With direct HS2 services to Nottingham, Derby and Chesterfield stations, coupled with the electrification of the Midland Main Line, travel times across the region will be significantly reduced and capacity enhanced.”"
