        "text": "The British government has come under heavy scrutiny and criticism after more than 300 Tory MPs voted against free meals for school children over the holidays.\n\nEarlier this year, Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford led a successful campaign that allowed hungry children to have access to free meals during the summer holidays, drawing upon the own troubles that his mother went through when he was a child.\n\nA motion had been brought back to the Commons to have the same initiative extended for the upcoming October half-term break and the Christmas holidays in order to help families that have been hit hardest by the pandemic and were already struggling in the battle against poverty.\n\nHowever, the motion was defeated by the government's majority with prime minister Boris Johnson, chancellor Rishi Sunak, health secretary Matt Hancock and former PM Theresa May amongst the 320 Tories who voted it down. The Tories were joined by Dr Julian Lewis, the independent MP for New Forest East.\n\nRashford's response to the vote was a plea for MPs to work together and put aside party politics adding that \"child food poverty has the potential to become the greatest pandemic the country has ever faced.\"\n\nTensions proved to be high in the Commons during the debate with Tory backbencher Christopher Clarkson accusing Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner of calling him 'scum.' She later apologised.\n\nAnother Tory backbencher Brendan Clarke-Smith, accused Rashford of \"celebrity virtue signalling on Twitter\" adding \"where is the slick PR campaign encouraging absent parents to take some responsibility for their children?\"\n\nThe uproar about this decision, which will affect millions of families across the country has been sizeable. Even Nigel Farage, possibly one of the most disliked politicians in Britain, called the government \"mean\" and asked why they were able to subsidise money for the Eat Out to Help Out scheme but can't help hungry children.\n\nSome Tories have attempted to hit back at the criticism. Ben Bradley claimed that reintroducing the free school meals campaign \"increases dependency\" while Steve Baker attempted to debate Rashford and claimed that \"feeding hungry children is a top priority.\"\n\nFormer health secretary Jeremy Hunt has claimed on morning television on Thursday that the government will look at the motion again at Christmas \"if help is needed\" but also accused the Labour motion of \"attempting to embarrass the government.\"\n\nWhether the motion does return to the Commons remains to be seen but for the record here are all the Tory MPs that voted against the school children having access to free school meals.\n\nNigel Adams (Conservative – Selby and Ainsty)\n\nBim Afolami (Conservative – Hitchin and Harpenden)\n\nAdam Afriyie (Conservative –
