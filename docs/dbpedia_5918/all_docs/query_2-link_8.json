        "text": "Parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom, 1950 onwards\n\nDerby North ( ) is a constituency[n 1] formed of part of the city of Derby, represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2024 by Catherine Atkinson from the Labour Party. It was previously held by Amanda Solloway, a Conservative.[n 2]\n\nBetween 1983 and 2005, the seat was a bellwether; in 2010 and 2017, the seat leaned more to the political left than the overall result. The seat has been relative to others a marginal seat since 2001, as well as a swing seat, as its winner's majority has not exceeded 8.6% of the vote since the 15.9% majority won at that year's general election. The seat has changed hands twice since then.\n\nBoundaries\n\n[edit]\n\nHistoric\n\n[edit]\n\n1950–1955: The County Borough of Derby wards of Abbey, Babington, Becket, Bridge, Derwent, Friar Gate, King's Mead, and Rowditch.\n\n1955–1974: The County Borough of Derby wards of Abbey, Babington, Becket, Bridge, Derwent, Friar Gate, King's Mead, and Rowditch, and the parish of Chaddesden in the Rural District of Shardlow.\n\n1974–1983: The County Borough of Derby wards of Abbey, Allestree, Breadsall, Chaddesden, Darley, Derwent, Friar Gate, Mickleover, and Spondon.\n\n1983–2010: The City of Derby wards of Abbey, Allestree, Breadsall, Chaddesden, Darley, Derwent, Mackworth, and Spondon.\n\n2010–present: The City of Derby wards of Abbey, Chaddesden, Darley, Derwent, Littleover, Mackworth, and Mickleover.\n\nMembers of Parliament\n\n[edit]\n\nDerby prior to 1950\n\nElection Member[2] Party 1950 Clifford Wilcock Labour 1962 by-election Niall MacDermot 1970 Phillip Whitehead 1983 Greg Knight Conservative 1997 Bob Laxton Labour 2010 Chris Williamson 2015 Amanda Solloway Conservative 2017 Chris Williamson Labour 2019[3] Independent 2019 Labour 2019 Independent 2019 Amanda Solloway Conservative 2024 Catherine Atkinson Labour\n\nConstituency profile\n\n[edit]\n\nThe constituency covers a largely residential area immediately north of Derby city centre, including some of the city's most affluent suburbs, as well as some of its council housing, though much of this is now in private ownership because of Right to Buy. Unemployment is below the national average. Average incomes are above the national average.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nA seat contested relatively closely between the two largest parties since 1950, Derby North was held consecutively by the Labour Party's Clifford Wilcock, Niall MacDermot, and Phillip Whitehead.[n 3] At the 1979 general election, it was covered by the BBC as the bellwether seat as the 41st of 41 seats that the Conservative Party needed to win; that year it stayed under control of Labour, but the Conservatives won the election regardless. Its exit poll was a central point of discussion of the BBC's election night coverage.[5]\n\nThe Conservative Greg Knight gained the seat in 1983, and held it until 1997.[n 4]\n\nLabour's Bob Laxton defeated Knight in 1997 and held the seat until retiring in 2010, when the seat was retained for Labour by Chris Williamson. In 2015, Amanda Solloway, a Conservative; gained the seat with a swing of 0.8%. The 2015 result gave the seat the second-most marginal majority (measured by percentage) of the Conservative Party's 331 seats.[6] Williamson regained the seat in 2017. He was subsequently suspended from the Labour Party, and was blocked in November 2019 from running as a Labour candidate at the following election;[7] he resigned from the party and stated his intention to run as an independent.[8]\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\nElections in the 2020s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 2024: Derby North [9] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 8,915 21.8 N/A Turnout 40,919 57.2 −7.0 Labour gain from Conservative Swing +13.6\n\nElections in the 2010s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 2019: Derby North[10] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 2,540 5.4 N/A Turnout 47,017 64.2 −4.9 Conservative gain from Labour Swing +4.8\n\nGeneral election 2017: Derby North Party Candidate Votes % Majority 2,015 4.1 N/A Turnout 48,672 69.1 0.0 Labour gain from Conservative Swing +2.1\n\nGeneral election 2015: Derby North[13] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 41 0.09 N/A Turnout 44,745 69.1 +6.0 Conservative gain from Labour Swing +0.8\n\nGeneral election 2010: Derby North[17][18] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 613 1.4 −13.2 Turnout 45,080 63.1 Labour hold Swing -7.4\n\nBoundary changes occurred in 2010, so percentage changes are based on notional results\n\nElections in the 2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 2005: Derby North[21][22][23] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 3,757 8.6 −7.3 Turnout 43,818 64.3 +6.5 Labour hold Swing -1.8\n\nGeneral election 2001: Derby North[24][23] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 6,982 15.9 −3.0 Turnout 44,054 57.8 −16.0 Labour hold Swing -1.5\n\nElections in the 1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 1997: Derby North[25][23] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 10,615 18.9 N/A Turnout 56,143 73.8 −6.9 Labour gain from Conservative Swing +13.2\n\nGeneral election 1992: Derby North[26][27] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 4,453 7.5 −3.8 Turnout 59,019 80.7 +4.9 Conservative hold Swing −2.0\n\nElections in the 1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 1987: Derby North[28][29] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 6,325 11.7 +4.8 Turnout 54,356 75.8 +3.3 Conservative hold Swing +2.4\n\nGeneral election 1983: Derby North[30][31] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 3,506 6.9 +6.5 Turnout 51,024 72.5 −4.3 Conservative gain from Labour Swing +3.2\n\nElections in the 1970s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 1979: Derby North[32] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 214 0.4 −6.5 Turnout 64,181 76.8 +3.6 Labour hold Swing -3.3\n\nGeneral election October 1974: Derby North[33] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 4,193 6.9 +4.9 Turnout 60,564 73.2 −5.9 Labour hold Swing\n\nGeneral election February 1974: Derby North[34] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 1,293 2.0 −7.4 Turnout 64,760 79.1 +6.9 Labour hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1970: Derby North[35][36] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 3,479 9.4 −14.2 Turnout 36,749 64.2 −6.6 Labour hold Swing\n\nElections in the 1960s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 1966: Derby North[37][38] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 8,818 23.6 +5.3 Turnout 37,248 70.8 −3.6 Labour hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1964: Derby North[39][40] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 7,395 18.3 +12.7 Turnout 40,434 74.4 −2.3 Labour hold Swing\n\n1962 Derby North by-election[41] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 8,018 24.0 +18.4 Turnout 33,364 Labour hold Swing\n\nElections in the 1950s\n\n[edit]\n\nGeneral election 1959: Derby North[42] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 2,407 5.6 −6.0 Turnout 42,939 76.7 +1.0 Labour hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1955: Derby North[43][44] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 5,006 11.6 −6.7 Turnout 43,318 75.7 −9.8 Labour hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1951: Derby North[45] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 5,562 14.18 Turnout 39,218 82.49 Labour hold Swing\n\nGeneral election 1950: Derby North[46] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 7,430 18.3 Turnout 40,580 85.5 Labour win (new seat)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of parliamentary constituencies in Derbyshire\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
