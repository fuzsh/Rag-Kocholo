        "text": "Write hard and clear about what hurts – Ernest Hemingway\n\nMass testing, mass restrictions or mass contradictions – Who do we follow?\n\nJust like so many people, my Christmas plans were ruined with the new Tier system. But perspective is everything and yesterday another 744 deaths were announced. This is rather frighteningly with the 28-day cut off, so during the last lockdown. I found myself increasingly angrier by the day which was consolidated by yet another out-of-body experience; the Daily COVID briefing from Downing Street. Let’s make no bones about it, this country NEVER had control over the pandemic.\n\n2020 has been the year where so many of us have made heart-breaking sacrifices and if missing Eid was not hard enough, Christmas has thrown us a new curve ball. All sentiment aside, the elephant in the room is schools. What does the government do? Education is the political arena for policy makers to project their ideological agendas and flex their zealousness. In this neo-liberal market place that is now education, the pandemic has exposed the gaps which are now enormous chasms and canyons. The pre-COVID damage cannot have a bandage placed over it as this pandemic has melted all that is certain into thin air.\n\nHead teachers up and down the country are beyond anxious, constantly having to deal with moving goal-posts, ill-direction and last minute guidelines from the DfE. Our Education Secretary and Schools Minister assess the situation from a vantage point of comfort and detachment. Teaching unions are labelled as “militant” for seeking assurances on safety. Finally, teachers themselves are branded as “lazy” if they dare complain and “political” if they dare question education policies. This political merry-go-round exists against the backdrop of rising COVID cases, tighter restrictions, a faltering economy, UNICEF and Marcus Rashford intervening to feed our most disadvantaged children and Britain having the highest death toll in Europe. This is simply abhorrent for the 6th richest country in the world.\n\nI am an avid viewer of the Downing Street briefings (please don’t ask why I put myself through the pain). Just like so many of us, I walk away feeling cheated, lied to and gaslighted. No matter who leads them, these briefings are filled with political rhetoric, watered down ideological language and rarely have public health at heart. I patiently wait for one of the experts (especially Jonathan Van Tam) to mention schools and then I react. The briefings alone are an experience in themselves but the mixed messages, that is what is causing mass confusion and such discontent amongst the public, especially educators. From my own analysis, I have some non-exhaustive points of discussion.\n\nSchools – COVID Factories?\n\nBetween April and September, Gavin Williamson continued to tell us that schools are someone miraculously COVID free. On the eve of schools reopening for September, Williamson said, “I would urge you to keep in mind that all four of our country’s chief medical officers, including [chief medical officer for England] Chris Whitty, are unanimous in believing the health risk posed by Covid-19 to children is extremely low.”\n\nAt this stage, we were all “eating out with Rishi” and it appeared the number of cases and deaths had fallen significantly. The celebratory sentiment of the government could not be more evident as national lockdown restrictions had been lifted. As teaching unions continued to be caricatured as “Marxist”, they pleaded with the DfE to intervene and plan the 2020-21 academic year more carefully, schools still reopened. Williamson was so assured schools were safe that all year groups returned in September and vast social mixing was visible in schools even with social distancing measures in place. In fact, according to Worldometres, on August 31st there were 1,406 new cases and COVID-19 had claimed 41,501 lives by this stage. Some six week later when my school had broken up for October half-term, the number of cases skyrocketed to 20,890 and an additional 3,489 had been announced over this six week period. Of course, reopening schools and rising cases/deaths is an easy and somewhat nebulous correlation but it not one that we can totally rule out. The situation actually got so bad that the Independent SAGE group actually called for a circuit-breaker lockdown during October half-term which was ignored and during this term the WHO actually notified the government about a new variant of COVID. I bet they didn’t tell you that at the daily briefings did they?\n\nOne thing that remains clear is that the number of cases and deaths has increases exponentially since schools reopened in September. Whether we like it or not, the only logical way to tackle this pandemic is to reduce the numbers of people in circulation to stop the spread. This includes children who do carry and spread the virus. A viable and sustainable long-term strategy is required where the government liaise with school leaders, local authorities and vested stakeholders to intervene as clearly the current state of affairs is simply not working.\n\nǝɔuǝᴉɔS ǝɥʇ ʍolooℲ\n\nOne thing I love about Professor Van Tam is his subtle ability to embed integrity into his words. Back in September, JVT were openly said that infection rates are rising fastest in: confined spaces, close contact, crowded areas, extended duration of contact and volume (singing, shouting, etc). Implicitly or explicitly, Van Tam described a modern day school/classroom. This came days after Williamson giving the green flag for schools to reopen. So, which one is it gents? Are schools COVID-free zones or as the data and clearly the experts tell us, are they breading grounds for this virus? Are we actually following the science?\n\nBy November, the number of cases and deaths began to get out of hand by November when the PM called for a national lockdown which excluded education settings. Despite, at this stage, ONS data showing that COVID cases were spreading fastest in education settings, schools remained open. Data continued to show that cases were rising and daily deaths were hitting 500/600 a day. When we watched on at Italy in March and prayed nothing like this would happen in Britain, nine months on this country is world-beating, well Euro-beating in deaths. However, the political agenda to “save Christmas” began to take precedence but the setting where COVID was spreading uncontrollably remained off topic and a taboo for policy makers. But the confusion continued…\n\nLeaks to the press meant the last week of term was, well you know, unprecedented. Apparently teachers will now be trained to administer COVID tests! Who actually knows? Yet, when guidelines are sent out the night or weekend before the term starts or ends, do you blame school leaders for feeling so frustrated? When the term had ended, Matt Hancock in an interview with Sky News openly said, “we need to do everything to stop the spread in school-age children now.” Yet, Williamson told us, “there is little evidence that the virus is transmitted at school.” Check your notes, Gavin. Your data comes from April to August when schools were in-part closed, thus making this inference is like sneezing into a face mask and calling it moisturiser. Hancock had contradicted Williamson, for Chris Whitty to say that COVID spreads in “biologically advantageous “ conditions which Van Tam once described as essentially being schools. Then yesterday, Jenny Hardies claimed that teachers are at no greater risk than anyone else, which is backed by Whitty’s comments that teaching is not a high-risk occupation. Most school leaders would struggle to get their head around this.\n\nThe farrago of confusion and misleading ideological wordplay from the experts and politicians provides no peace whatsoever for those teachers and support staff who have had to self-isolate and the families of those who are grieving. It is gaslighting beyond epic proportion to say that schools do not spread COVID when you have all the necessary ingredients for this virus to breed. Namely, poorly ventilated and crowded areas, close contact, and duration of time. Isn’t it time we followed the science? You know, the science that is sanitised of ideological point-scoring and “world-beating” jargon? The science that will actually save lives?\n\nDisadvantaged Children\n\nClosing schools has always been somewhat of a non-negotiable under the veneer of “disadvantaged children are falling behind.” The same disadvantaged children who have had to live under the crippling decade of austerity that has seen mainline services cut, university tuition fees tripled and schools chronically underfunded. Yes, the disadvantaged children! The same disadvantaged children our Education Secretary voted against feeding over half-term?\n\nI am still in disgust that the sixth richest country in the world cannot provide meals let alone adequate resources for learning to moved online to protect communities from COVID-19. This is a damning indictment of the society we live in, the inequalities that have perpetuated and prospered and repeated failure of successive governments to solve child poverty. Although teachers and social commentators will be branded as “political” if they are up in arms about inequality, when did keeping others safe and providing them equality of opportunity become political? As previously stated, the unwillingness to tackle structural inequalities over the past decade and the stagnant social mobility in this country has been left ruthlessly exposed by the global pandemic. We have got to the stage where the most vulnerable children are unsafely attending school and potentially taking home a virus that could harm their loved ones. With no real alternatives being provided, leaving schools open in their full capacity is unsafe, dangerous and although there is consensus that schools are the safest place for children, are we considering the impacts staff absences, self-isolation and material deprivation on our most disadvantaged learners? We need a plan which goes beyond handing out laptops or marking pupil premium books first. The legacy of this pandemic will be how we supported our most vulnerable. As MPs continue to mention throwing a “protective ring” around the most disadvantaged, how about we throw one around schools and teachers who are a child’s best resource and safe place. If we want to “save” these children, let’s start by protecting them and their families from this potentially fatal virus.\n\nIn Summary\n\nI am always very conscious of my writing as I don’t intend to make it grim reading but there is a fine line between venting and dumping. Teachers have just spent 14 weeks in COVID-inducing conditions, many are self-isolating or in lockdown when they should be around loved ones. As schools are the arena for policy makers to reflect their ideological values, educators should never forget their purpose, their role and responsibility to provide every child with the best education in the safest environment possible. I speak to friends who are purchasing hand sanitiser for their students and even additional PPE for colleagues, it makes you wonder if the chasm between political rhetoric and our daily realities will ever be bridged.\n\nI do want to go back to data and statistics. Between September 1st and December 23rd, the number of COVID deaths has risen by 27,550 (from 41,501 to 69,051). We all know the elephant in the room isn’t “it’s true season” or “there’s more testing.” Schools are driving COVID. We may have had bubbles burst, year groups sent home or perhaps we know of colleagues who have tragically passed away from this virus. What is being done to prevent more deaths? On-site testing isn’t the eureka moment, schools and their leaders need more, much more. It is time to safeguard the public and introduce,\n\n-Blended learning\n\n-Face masks\n\n-PPE for schools\n\n-Year group rotas\n\n-Equitable alternatives to exams\n\nCutting off the conditions in which COVID prospers should be our priority. Simply placing a bandage over the wound does not deal with the infection itself, both literally and metaphorically. Ironically, teaching unions actually called for these interventions and I’m still unsure how they pay homage to Karl Marx, do you?\n\nWho do we follow? Who will stand up and lead us through these challenging times? The answer is – YOU. You have been in those classrooms. You have made the ultimate sacrifice this year under unbelievable pressures from MPs and the press. To every teacher out there, it is time to switch off and whatever obstacles come in front of us in January, we will be there and we will honour both our students and those who have suffered losses during this pandemic. We follow the example set by Marcus Rashford. We find our own leaders or we become them. Here’s to the vaccine too. May 2021 bring us all some much needed joy. Ameen.\n\nFinally, to those who are reading this and struggling over this Christmas period, there is support out there.\n\nSamaritans – 116 123\n\nMind Charity – 03001233393\n\nYoung Minds – textline 85258\n\nEducation Support – 08000 562 561\n\nThe Calm Zone – 0800 585858\n\nWomen’s Aid – 0808 2000247\n\nFinally, sending a extra Merry Christmas and Christmas Mubark to all those:\n\n•Who have been through a break up,\n\n•Spending Xmas alone,\n\n•Grieving the loss of a loved one,\n\n•Self-isolating,\n\n•Suffering from anxiety or depression,\n\n•Caring for a loved one\n\nStay safe. Thank you for reading.\n\nShuaib Khan\n\nChristmas, unconscious bias, diversity and inclusion.\n\nPractical ways we can make Christmas inclusive for Muslim teachers.\n\nI love Christmas time. Even as a Muslim, I am always in awe of the sense of community, the festivities and the togetherness. However, before anyone hands me a glass of mulled wine, which I have Googled countless times to ensure is halal for me to drink, I have some questions. In the Islamic faith we commemorate all the Prophets and their contributions. I hate to break it to those on the right but in my life I am yet to meet a Muslim who is offended by eggnog or Santa. I have yet to meet a Ebenezer Scrooge praying in Arabic or tearing down a Christmas tree as he chases down carol singers and condemns the Queen’s speech. Sorry, Laurence Fox. However, I do believe there are many tacit loaded assumptions or what are commonly known as “unconscious bias” about those who do not celebrate Christmas. This is certainly the case for Muslims too. We can sensitively and respectfully challenge these biases to enable us all to have a Merry Christmas however we may wish to celebrate it.\n\nI have read a handful articles about celebrating Christmas, Xmas jumper days and much more but what about those who do not celebrate it? How about those who don’t attach the same level of importance or tradition to it as the host population? Surely they deserve recognition? In the era of inclusion, why are we excluding? Isn’t their battle worthy? Shouldn’t schools be promoting cultural and religious sensitivity? There appears to be a gap and as some voices remain rendered invisible, it was time to write about the British Muslim perspective on Christmas. What does Christmas look like through the lens of a British Muslim? May be it something you have never considered but together, let’s consider it. ‘Tis the season to hold difficult conversations.\n\nThis has been a year of self-pride and self-discovery. In September, I wrote about the underachievement of Pakistani-British Muslims and ways we can address this as educators. As we are holding conversations about inclusion, equality and diversity, what about Muslim staff during the Christmas break? Due to the global pandemic, our equivalent to Christmas – Eid, it was cancelled. Many Muslim families celebrated Eid alone for the very first time. Personally, I was unable to complete Eid prayer at my local mosque because of lockdown. Close relatives and neighbours chose not to gather and the traditional Eid brunch, well you could hear the echo in the rooms as the spoon kissed the rasmalai bowl. COVID-19 really did hit the community hard but as the Christmas holidays fall in line with national holidays, Muslims up and down the country will also be having a much deserved break. We must seek to confront unconscious biases, othering and micro-aggressions through our interactions with others. Let’s rest over Christmas but not rest on our laurels when it comes to inclusion and diversity.\n\nHow can we support Muslims teachers during the festive period?\n\nI believe there are many ways we can support our Muslim teachers and also just those who do not celebrate Christmas out of choice. Before we begin a rapturous chorus of the 12 Days of Christmas or deck the halls with boughs of holly, we must approach this dialogue with sensitivity. I have four non-exhaustive ideas that aim to provide opportunity for dialogue and bridge greater understanding. Also to challenge unconscious bias in a more holistic way.\n\nBe sensitive\n\nFor me, sensitivity is key. Not everyone celebrates Christmas but that does not mean they do not understand the meaning of the celebration, the significance and tradition of the day and national importance placed behind it. Sometimes we make loaded assumptions without realising and we are not corrected because those we have spoken about do not feel comfortable in doing so. Let’s take a snippet of a conversation I had at work last year.\n\nN: “Shuaib, what do you do over Christmas? It is a void day, right?\n\nMe: “I have family and friends who do celebrate it.”\n\nN: “So, would you like a Christmas card?”\n\nN is a lovely chap and don’t get me wrong, his intentions were never to upset me but this lack of sensitivity came from a lack of understanding. Being sensitive towards those who do not celebrate Christmas is about not assuming their position, stance or viewpoint. If anything, this sensitivity can be created by simply getting to know your colleagues and your students, and bridging the cultural or religious gap, all of which will help promote future dialogue in more sensitive way. You can ask questions, it really is ok.\n\nIf you are unsure…\n\nAsk and ask respectfully. Please don’t assume. In one school I was excluded from Secret Santa and the end of year Christmas meal because in their word own words, “we were unsure if you would want to get involved because you are a Muslim.” Yes, my faith is Islam but does it prohibit me from attending staff gatherings or sharing gifts? Absolutely not. It can be so innocuous at times like offering someone a mince pie or inviting them to the staff Christmas party or simply wishing them a Merry Christmas. How will you know what is appropriate if you do not ask? I was once handed a bottle of Chardonnay as a secret Santa present. I am a Muslim, I don’t drink but was I offended? No. However, if this colleague was to have struck up the conversation with me, I would have signposted them. Most Muslims are kind and friendly people who will answer questions and want you to understand their faith. With Christmas too, if you are unsure, please just ask. It is either asking or handing me a bottle of Jack Daniels which I cannot consume anyway! If you are unsure about a present, or what is in festive food, please ask. The number of times I’ve had to ask colleagues, “Is this halal?” as I’m offered a mince pie, it will leave you astounded. Simply asking a Muslim member of staff what they are comfortable with and how you can approach the topic of Christmas sensitively would be so beneficial for all parties involved. Next time you ask a Muslim colleague about their decision not to participate in Christmas jumper day, just be considerate. Christmas can be an excellent opportunity for inter-faith dialogue which can only be done if we are prepared to be brave enough to ask. Ask; but respectfully.\n\nInclusion\n\nThis has become the buzzword for 2020. From personal experience, many Muslim teachers do want to feel included in every aspect of their working environment. Whether this is in the office or in the classroom. Inclusion in a non-tokenistic manner is something every institution should be striving for to form a diversity of viewpoints that everyone will be beneficiaries of. At the very core, although most Muslims do not celebrate Christmas, they still want to be included in the festivities. In my previous article about underachieving Pakistani-British Muslims, I referred to the notion of “over-assimilation.” There is a case for this here also. To the Muslim teachers who were born and raised in Britain, Christmas is engrained in their psyche. It is a banal and ordinary part of their life and calendar year. This means, although many of us don’t have Fairytale of New York or Last Christmas on our Spotify playlists (I do), Christmas is still a significant event for us. At one particular school, some Muslim staff asked not to attend the school Christmas nativity. The school assumed this was on religious grounds but when I caught up with two TAs, they openly told me they felt excluded from the production process. It was assumed they didn’t know enough about the Nativity story despite having performed in it themselves when they were at school. These two ladies grew up on the staple of watching Home Alone on repeat! If we etch out the blaring differences we uncover stark similarities with one another. Again, if you are unsure, ask. With Christmas, there come loaded tacit assumptions but including all staff could go a long way in creating more understanding about one another.\n\nYour break is our break too\n\nChristmas may be a non-Islamic festival but it is also a break for everyone. After seven long gruelling weeks, the assumption that Christmas does not mean anything to those who celebrate it does implicitly trivialise the hard work they have put in during the term. When I have been asked, “So, what do you do over Christmas?” Really, my Christmas is not too different from yours. Of course, I don’t have a tree or Christmas lunch with extra brussel sprouts, but I rest, relax and recover. The assumption that my break is somewhat radically different from your is so misleading. Just like you, I am tired and ready to switch off from work. Like you, I may binge watch an entire Netflix series, eat my body weight in chocolate (not me, as I hate chocolate – sorry), catch up on podcasts, enjoy my lie ins and really, just enjoy not being at work. It has been an unprecedented year and all of us just been to pause, reflect and have a break. For everyone not celebrating Christmas, they deserve this time too. Your break is our break too.\n\nIn Summary\n\nI wish everyone reading this piece a very Happy Christmas. So many of us are often left clenched up and anxious at the thought of approaching others about holidays because we are unsure of how they may react. Christmas is a special time of year and most Muslim staff and those who do not celebrate Christmas are looking forwards to the break. But please be sensitive, do not make assumptions, be inclusive and remember, your Christmas break is also a chance for others to take a breather after a truly exhausting term. The tacit and often value-laden assumptions can be dismantled through dialogue and learning more about one another. We must all keep working to challenged and unravel unconscious bias and although Christmas provide us with a much needed break, we cannot allow the festive period to stop us fighting the good fight.\n\nUltimately, as reflective practitioners, we should all be looking to ensure greater sensitivity and inclusion through our every interaction. Christmas is a unique opportunity to bridge misconceptions and gain more light about each other.\n\nIf you have not began work on making yourself more inclusive with your words and actions, I pray Christmas provides you with the time to reflect and reconsider. Here’s to 2021. A year of prosperity, inclusion and for us all to have conversations that matter.\n\nChristmas Mubarak.\n\nThank you for reading,\n\nShuaib Khan.\n\nhttps://shuaibwriteskhanthinks.wordpress.com/2020/09/15/british-pakistani/?preview=true\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/antismalltalk-by-shuaib-khan/id1518310026?i=1000489104130\n\n“Death doesn’t end relationships, it changes them”\n\n– Megan Devine\n\nLove, grief and the endless cost of love.\n\nAlthough I am not an expert in grief, I know how life looked before and after it . Drawing on Megan Devine’s remarkable book It’s OK that you’re Not Ok: Meeting Grief and Loss in a Culture That Doesn’t Understand, these are my own reflections five years after losing my Grandfather (Dad/Aba’Jee).\n\nA year of writing passionately and personally, 2020 has been truly unprecedented. I still find myself coming to terms with the privilege of platforms. Today I wanted to write from the heart about something, and more specifically someone close to my heart. It has taken five years to find the strength to write this piece. After spending a lifetime of trying to articulate emotions into words, grief continued to give me writers block. Sometimes words can’t do our feelings any justice, sometimes they can for others. I just hope it finds a fellow griever.\n\nNovember 15th is a day that I will never forget. As a child, I loved the month of November as winter dawned upon us, as did Christmas. November 2015 changed my entire outlook. There was me, starting my PGCE placement in rural Northamptonshire. I rocked by usual check shirt, knitted-tie and Dr Marten combination. It was time to shine. Preparation, planning and the route to work all mapped out. On Friday November 13th, I received a phone call that I still recall word-for-word. Trembling with fear, I got straight into the car and hastily arrived at the family home which itself felt eerily different. My Grandad had been taken to hospital that morning and the regrets began to flood in. We always shook hands before bed, the night before I had forgotten. So much was said and unsaid. Little did I know that by Sunday he would be taking his last breath in front of me. All of a sudden the world appeared to be a colder place. No one could conceptualise how I felt, many I still consider as close still don’t understand how I feel the rawness of my loss five years on. The trauma of watching someone you love die never disappears. November was never the same again. I was never the same again. It is on anniversaries in particular that social and emotional norms just melt into thin air. Grief is so isolating, lonely and we are often left wondering “am I the only one feeling this way?” Although five years have passed, I still miss you like it was yesterday.\n\nBefore losing Dad I had attended dozens of funerals. In the Muslim community, we tend to have a prayer at the Mosque before the person who has passed away is laid to rest. This is often a final opportunity for others to console the family, see the face of the deceased and gather in unity. These moments evoke such powerful and raw emotions but prior to Dad passing away, I would shut them down. I could, and in hindsight I will say it was arrogance and immaturity. I still recall a distant relative dying and I was unmoved. This was an uncertainty, a world that contradicted my happy-go-lucky nature. It went against the normalities and checklists we set ourselves. Any outward expression of emotion that did not neatly fit into society’s expectation, it tends to be negated. You see, hurt changes people. Grief pushes us into a corner but we don’t decide when we can leave that corner.\n\nThere remains a paradox. We are either deemed “brave” if we talk about those who have left us or “negative” for holding conversation about our losses. In order for us to appreciate the finer things in life, acknowledging the existence of what causes us pain is a key part of this process. It isn’t bravery, it is basic human emotion – the type that remains misunderstood and badly misjudged. One of the kindest compliments I received is “Shuaib, you express your feeling so well.” I don’t. With grief, just like the rest of us, I am milling around in the dark, I still need guidance and I am lost without Dad. Grief is a bit like a left over meal. It is there, we were able to arbitrarily dip in and out of it but even if we throw it away, that does not deny its existence. I tried so hard to put my grief into some type of petri dish, scientifically and rationally dissect this emotion I had once never come to terms with. Even selecting the words, images and title for this piece was so exhausting. Deciding exactly when to publish it too was beyond difficult. How can I do grief any justice in just one blog?\n\nAt various points in my journey, I was told to research the Stages of Grief model which did not comply with how I was feeling. Kind of like a one-size-fits-all lesson plan, it did not differentiate and cater for my needs. In her later years, the founder of this Stages of Grief model, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross regretted ever writing the stages and did not want it to be the universal veneer from which loss is conceptualised. Grief cannot be pigeon-holed, it isn’t predictable and no two people grieve in the same way. When we homogenise the personal lived experiences of others, we oversimplify and thus misunderstand individual stories. Grief is, as Megan Devine tells us, incredibly misunderstood. The emotional illiteracy surrounding loss is pushing those who are grieving further away, trapping them into corners and creating an emotional distance at a time where they need to know someone is there beside them.\n\nWhy do you call him ‘Dad’?\n\nIn the South-Asian community and I’ll be careful not to stereotype, as a rule of thumb, the extended nuclear family is the norm. Grandparents hold a special and significant place in the family home. Growing up, everyone from aunties to uncles called my Grandad ‘Dad’. So, as his grandson, it fitted, it matched his position and given his place in my heart, being someone’s ‘Dad’ means something. He meant something. So, when I often refer to my Grandad, I, for my own personal reasons, call him ‘Dad’. He never liked the name/tag ‘Grandad’ anyway!\n\nI don’t think words can do him justice. He was well built man with such strength. As children, we would sit in awe of him doing DIY and bragged that someday we would muscles the same size as his. Dad was simple, shy, humble and kind. He didn’t have the opportunity to go to school, he lost his father when he was just 10 or 12. After years of working in markets in our native Kashmir, he moved to Britain to build a better life from himself and his family back home. To this day I don’t for one second believe he ever wanted to settle here but it happened. A fiercely friendly and jovial man, he gave my siblings and I the most wonderful childhood. He used his pension to pay for my first car. Dad used to shop for our neighbours, check up on vulnerable members of our community and, always had a new joke to match his beautiful smile. We knew him as ‘Dad’ but everyone else called him ‘Hajji’. This is the highest rank in the community. His simplicity was his sophistication. His kindness was his USP. The slow-walking, Punjabi-talking, Dad loved his sweet dishes. If there was cake, Dad was there! Clutching onto his Afghan scarf, he owned few positions but wore his heart on his sleeve. If he spoke, you listened. He said it like it is, never sugar-coated the facts and the outpouring of emotion when he died was so moving. was Above all else, he loved his family.\n\nHe was the first to hold me as a newborn baby. Grandma said, “he delayed his retirement because he found a new love – his grandsons.” Of course, the magnitude of all his sacrifices I was unaware of until he left us. I never got the chance to say, thank you. There was no fairy-tale ending but I take some peace in the fact he was around his family as his time drew near. Ultimately he preached the notion of having a ‘small circle but a big heart’. This is now my motto. Dad also once said, ”we are all one misfortune from losing everything we have. If you can’t help, don’t ridicule others.”\n\nBetween us, I know 15/11/15 is not our last meeting. So much has changed but my love for you hasn’t died, it grew stronger with distance which is one of the saddest contradictions of loss. The unbreakable bond we shared has left me with unconditional grief. We will see each other again, Insha’Allah. I love you. May the Almighty grant you the highest place in Jannath ul’Firdous. Ameen.\n\nFive years, six lessons.\n\nFive years is a long time but also nothing compared to the lifetime of joy, happiness, love and challenges I saw with Dad. I have six non-exhaustive points of reflection. Don’t get me wrong, grief is crippling. It punctures your heart and hold no prisoners. Managing that grief is what is key for us grievers. For me, no one comes out the other end of their grief journey the same but how can they? And also, why should they? It’s ok to miss someone who gave you so much to remember. It’s ok that’s it’s not ok.\n\nGrief illiteracy is real.\n\nWe don’t live in a grief-literate culture. It is that simple. Grief is made to feel like a burden, something we should feel guilty for expressing. Grief is threatening. Even when we are meant to be ‘throwing kindness around like it’s confetti’, society is not sensitive to loss. Grief is a universal emotion, it is not spoken about universally. I do not believe this is specific to Britain but loss that remains a taboo, a conversation that is rarely aired and those who dare to openly share their experiences are often shouted down, dismissed or labelled as “negative.” This is because, not only do people not understand the gravity of your loss, but they are also never taught how to either. Grief is not something that is taught in schools, but rather it is a lesson that is learnt through the most heart-breaking experience. I recall group counselling sessions where I would try my best to revel and understand the grief of others but I could not. I could not see the “bigger picture” because I was consumed with my own emotions. Again, we don’t live in a grief literate culture because in a time of instantaneous communications, the veneer of “keep calm and carry on” remains as prevalent as ever. Grief is threatening. It challenges the rather banal expectations that we have a “stiff upper lip.” Even during my most basic interactions, grief would be written all over my face but very few people could read these tacit codes. Those who could, they understood and a mutual understanding of our losses connected us in such a significant way. To those who are grieving, we don’t know much different. These are such personal emotions that only a handful of people can approach in a sensitive manner. Not everyone will understand your grief and that is ok too. However, those who do remind is it’s safe to talk about someone who is gone, these people do exist, they are incredible and they have felt pain just like you.\n\nNot everyone deserves to hear about your grief\n\nWhen Dad died, I had to tell everyone. I would slip it into every conversation. The whole world needed to know his name. I would tear up easily and share personal information about Dad to anyone who spared an ear. I wore the pieces of my shattered heart on my sleeve. Revealing a broken heart does not mean your audience can piece it back together. No tannoy announcement was going to bring Dad back but I didn’t care! The world was my campsite, I wanted everyone to sit around the fire and listen to me tell them how much I missed my Dad. I knew the world could not feel my hurt which pushed me further away from others. I was desperate find someone who felt the same way. Someone else who had lost someone they loved more than themselves. I would search far and wide for every opening to drop in, “My Dad passed away.” This was often met with side-ways looks and silence. You see, not everyone has the emotional competence to understand your grief and that is ok too. When we lose someone we love, we are looking for an open heart and a kind ear to listen rather than clichèd Pinterest quotes to be read aloud to us or pinged to us via WhatsApp. I was abhorred when a fellow PGCE student told me she had gone out partying the day after her Dad had died. “How could she?” continued to play on my mind. That is how she dealt with her own grief. We are all different and all of us feel things differently but not everyone can just ‘get’ grief. It is a personalised lived experience. You cannot get anyone to feel your grief with you because just like our victories and our loses, there are our own. With grief, everyone cares and then no one cares. You go from being surrounded by fellow mourners to being alone. These days I rarely ever share personal memories or stories about Dad because I am still trying to make sense of his life and legacy. This was always my own loss and only until I realised that I must begin a new chapter without someone who I could never image even beginning a new book with – that is when it dawned upon me. My Dad was a special, kind and loving soul. No words could do his memory justice and that’s ok too so long as lives on in the hearts of those he inspired. Not everyone deserves to hear about your grief as the right ones, they will listen carefully and support unconditionally. These people do exist, trust me. It’s finding them, that’s the hard part.\n\nIt comes in waves\n\nGrief does come in waves. Some days we are swimming merrily against the tide and on others, we are drowning. As loss is so personal, we never truly know how others feel, their anxieties, fears, insecurities and challenges. I still remember having a fantastic day at work where I had taught well and left with a huge smile of satisfaction on my face. On the drive home it would hit me that I could not share my successes with Dad. Other days I would visit the local Mosque and purely at random, I would glance back and I would feel his presence. I feel it when I pray and thus praying attains more emotional significance. The waves of grief can come in all forms and sizes. Some days we are surfing brilliantly, other days we are a shipwreck. I found it impossible not to look at photos, find new cues and spot something different each time I saw something with Dad in it. I asked neighbours, friends and everyone if they had any photos or family videos, I just wanted to see my Dad. I wanted to know what others thought of him to help validate my own views and place myself in his shoes. I was obsessed. Then there would come days I would just process losing him in my own quiet way. When Dad died, I was shipwrecked, I was drowning in a combination of heartbreak, regret, guilt, sadness and shock. Five years on, I still feel those emotions but his memory and all that floats around me, be they photos, letters, memoirs or stories, they float around me, giving me hope that this is just another wave. Although I hang onto a piece of that wreckage from that shipwreck, keeping my head above the water every time is a reminder to me that there is so much more living to do and so much still to honour.\n\nThe quotes and clichés\n\n“I can’t image how you must be feeling.”\n\n“Everything happens for a reason.”\n\n“They are in a better place now.”\n\n“It gets easier with time.”\n\nAll four of these messages were sent to me hours after Dad passed away. My eyes were blurry, my heart was heavy and my memory was hazy. Till this day I still failed to understand what those four messages meant. These were awfully reductive things to say to someone who had watched someone they loved pass away. I felt helpless as Dad died in my arms and as the family read prayers. I was in a state of shock. The most powerful person I ever knew was dying and there was not a thing I could do to stop it. When people began to send me quotes too, I got frustrated as they all had some tangible form of progress in them. I didn’t feel like I was making progress, the clichés weren’t working. These quotes were white noise and escapism for others to not fully understand the enormity of my loss. They were a neutral position. All I could think was “How can anyone be neutral? Why won’t you listen?” Again, not everyone can understand your grief which is ok, they aren’t expected too. Until you have felt the full gravity of a loss, you can never understand what grief is, let alone how to console a griever. You will find your own way and naturally gravitate towards those who understand. In Islam, we do firmly believe that this life is a test and that we shall all someday return to our creator. I continue to draw strength in my faith and with the current pandemic, I wonder if Dad, who was the most sociable person ever, could have coped with lockdowns or the incompetence of the government. Hindsight is a beautiful thing and I was thinking selfishly. I wanted more time with him but I had 23 years living under his loving guidance. Some people don’t ever have someone who loves them as unconditionally as Dad loved me. My grief still exists but we must remember that love is not measured by time, it is measured in moments. Those tangible accomplishments we all look for may not exist but spending time to mend your heart and gain peace of mind rarely attracts outward expressions. Again, that is ok. Keep healing, loving and mending.\n\nLoss helps us connect\n\nThis sounds like an oxymoron, right? Grief connects broken hearts. When Dad died, part of me also left this world. Our connection was always powerful, moving and strong. Along the way I found that people could not comprehend the complexity of how I felt. Many joined my journey and then left but that is ok too. Losing Dad broke my exterior walls of resistant which cemented together by a combination of toxic masculinity and inexperience. This grief journey enables me to spot a fellow griever from a mile off which is unique gift. We carry the weight of our experiences everywhere we go. In essence, everyone has emotional baggage. It is just the case that some carry it better than others, whereas some struggle with their load. We all have baggage. The early weeks after Dad died, the messages from friends and colleagues stopped. There was an eerie feeling that I had somehow “snapped out of” my grief and everything could go back to normal. These friends and colleagues never once asked how I felt after the initial few days. For them, my episode of grief had ended but for me, the journey only just began. I’ve met people who I have really liked but when we talk about families, the awkward silence begins when I refer to Dad. Our stories are very powerful, they can move mountains. Making connections is not about suppressing who we are but rather embracing ourselves, our feelings and yes, our grief. Grief sits with us at the table and that is ok too. Loss does help us connect and reconnect with ourselves and others. We find commonalities with others through our loss, strike up conversations with fellow grievers and this helps us on our own journey. I remember reading Rio Ferdinand’s Thinking Out Loud: Love, Grief and Being Mum & Dad. Rio was an absolute monster on the football pitch. Fearless, brave, resilient, I could go on. Rio lost his wife, Rebecca, to cancer and struggled badly. Just reading his own account of grief, I could resonate, understand and empathise. Losing someone creates such a terrible pain and huge hole in our lives but also changes our outlook on life. I found myself connecting with others, with myself and my beliefs, all of which are very much a work in progress. With all the dark days where we struggle to get out of bed, and I can assure you there are many of them, loss softens the heart. I find it impossible to understand why Dad was so kind to those who openly disrespected him but I now I know. He once said, “the dogs pass on by but there will always be places for the humans, always.” The tragic beauty of losing someone we love is we only appreciate their existence when they are no longer with us. It’s what we do when they are gone and the connections we make in their honour, those last an eternity.\n\nSelf-care is everything\n\nAs Megan Devine reminds us, grief is not merely emotional or psychological, it is also biological and physiological also. Weeks and months after Dad died, I found myself unable to sleep or eat. Grief attacks your immune system, appetite and the feeling of loss is tiring, exhausting even. Our personal and professional relationships suffer. Although I could no longer see Dad, hear his voice or speak to him, the true connection with those we love never dies. Our loved one may have passed away but we are still here. A griever tends to punish themselves and live in a world of self-denial, regret, heartbreak or a combination of all of these. I wouldn’t laugh too loud or smile too hard because I thought Dad wasn’t there to laugh or smile, so why should I? It is so consuming because when we deny ourselves the subtle joys of life, we lose so much. Dad would always smile and laugh, always. Simply dropping these traits like a bad habit did not honour him in any way. Such is grief and the juxtaposition of emotions it brings. It is unfair. It is shit. Life can feel as though it is stuck in reverse, that everyone else has “moved on” but you are still struggling. Self-care cannot be corporate packaged or purchased off a shelf. It is not something you can gaze at through a shop window. Self-care is personal, it requires reflection and individualised attention for our basic physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual needs. When you are grieving, recovery and self-care is not about just moving on or part-taking in middle-class pastimes like Yoga. Everyone heals in their own time, we must always remember that. Recovery and self-care are thus so important. Recovery is about learning to accept and understand exactly what grief is. In our often emotionless transactional society, we are taught a “stiff upper lip” or to “keep calm and carry on” is the veneer required to address our problems. When you someone close dies, we forget to eat, shower, take care of our basic needs and I often found myself so emotionally exhausted. We neglect our basic needs, often creating a hierarchy of these needs. What we really want is to ask more questions, learn more about the ones who have died and just more time with them. Grief can do this and self-care is so important in helping us find proactive steps to heal. Whatever works for you, I pray you find it. Self-care is so important and the ones we have lost would never want to see us suffer. Please look after yourself.\n\nIn Summary\n\nMegan Devine reminds us that we cannot fix grief but we can listen right here, right now. No matter who the author is, everyone has their own story to tell about loss but words have finite stages, grief doesn’t. Our grief never fully heals as when a heart is broken, it’s pieces cannot be placed back together in the original form. Instead, those pieces settle in new places and that is ok too. I just hope society begins to see grief as any other wound that needs tending to. No one chose to be a griever, loss chooses us, often at the most unexpected times.\n\nMy sincerest apologies that I have not provided any practical steps forwards but we are all making these painful strides to heal. When I hear of people losing loved ones or watching funerals via Zoom, it’s heart-breaking. I can’t give you answers amidst your pain, what I can offer if a smile amidst the rain. With this pandemic also, my heart goes out to anyone who has lost someone they love. Although I can’t provide you the answers to your grief, I can signpost you to help and lend an ear. Ultimately, when I get flashbacks of that cold November day, that’s all I ever wanted too. Someone to listen, to be patient, to remind me it was ok to remember my Dad. Please don’t ever feel as though you are alone or a burden. The life of those we lose deserves to be celebrated, cherished and treasured. Never forget that and never forget them. The world may never understand the gravity of your loss but that is on them. You should never underestimate the love you shared with those who are now gone. That will never die as Rumi reminds us, “Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with heart and soul there is no such thing as separation.”\n\nSometimes I feel like I am full of contradictions about grief but that’s it, grief is a contradictory emotion. As my favourite Rapper, Loyle Carner asks in his wonderful poem BFG, “must we love so much?” Grief is the true and endless cost of love, Loyle. Grief is the true and endless cost of love. I would just like to finish off with a poem I wrote for Dad. I hope you can find peace within these words too. Next Sunday will be tough.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nShuaib Khan\n\nTwitter: @shuaibkhan26\n\nFor additional support, the following links and sites offer some great advice and practical steps forward.\n\nMegan Devine’s – https://refugeingrief.com – Her work cannot be understated.

A critical analysis.\n\nLast night I wrote about the British obsession with examinations but inadvertently unearthed something deeper in my reflections. This has been a truly remarkable year and not just in the world of education. 2020 will go down as the year where we had the most sustained dialogue about the attainment of disadvantaged children. However, the rhetoric could hardly be any further from the reality in providing equality of opportunity for our young people.\n\nYesterday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson gave the green light for the 2021 GCSE and A-level examinations to go ahead. After six months of remote learning, schools up and down the country are hastily trying to ensure pupils can plug gaps in knowledge. These gaps were inevitable but as is the case in education, there is no place to hide and no respite for teachers. As policy makers try to balance the economy and public health, teachers are on the back foot but our are most vulnerable and disadvantaged don’t have a foot to stand on at all.\n\nBefore I began to write this blog, a close friend said to me, “Shuaib, not another article about disadvantaged children.” He was referring to my piece called Enemy of the State in May. But it does feel like, apart from Marcus Rashford and teachers, disadvantaged children have been left stranded. Whilst our national treasure, Marcus campaigns to feed the neediest, we fight to give them a seat at the table.\n\nThe strain placed on teachers with Williamson’s announcement yesterday cannot go understated. Alongside the rising number of COVID cases in educational settings, the true practicalities of compensating for six months of remote learning by pushing exams three weeks further is beyond outrageous. Yet, as true professionals, teachers will plough on and put in the graft until the inevitable U-turn. Until then, teachers and disadvantaged children remain in the line of fire.\n\nYesterday the DfE have openly stated that, “students will have extra time to prepare for exams next summer.” Gavin Williamson later Tweeted, “Exams are the fairest way of judging performance. We’re giving students and teachers the certainty that exams will go ahead in 2010 with more time to prepare plus support from the COVID Catch Up Fund.” The ideological fascination with high-stakes testing and assessment retains it stranglehold on teaching and learning here in Britain. However, it must also be said that after the exam shambles this past summer, perhaps allowing our students to just sit exams really is the fairest way to allocate grades, as clearly the algorithms worked a treat! My concern with yesterdays announcement really is about equity and equality of opportunity. These three concerns are not exhaustive but an opportunity for us to critically reflect.\n\nMisunderstanding and depolitcisation of disadvantaged children\n\nInequalities in society are a political as well as a social issue. This idea that education is the sole force for equalising inequalities and that meritocracy is ubiquitous must be questioned and analysed. Britain is a grossly unequal society and report after report illustrate the chasm between the wealthy and deprived. 2020 is the year where we begin to openly discuss about the role of schools and teachers in helping equalise the disadvantages for our most deprived children. Context is key. Do we ignore the brutal cuts to education funding and a decade of austerity where annually £12 billion has been taken from our public sector and frontline services to support the most disadvantaged and vulnerable? Gavin Williamson has said that exams are the fairest way to assess progress but does this empty rhetoric have practical groundings? The 10,000 laptops that were promised to our disadvantages learners are still missing and apart from the British tradition of throwing money at the problem, what has been done at the grassroots level to challenge inequalities? This idea that disadvantaged children exist in some sort of political vacuum is nebulous, misleading and depoliticising education at a time where the state has its ideological stranglehold over most aspects of state education. Disadvantaged children do not walk into school at the tender age of 4/5 and a decade later cleanse themselves of all inequalities and experiences that have shaped their life chances. Inequality just like education is political. The ability to heat and freeze discussions and use certain groups to thrust ideological stances is a pillar of privilege and platform. If there was any real effort to make education a real equalising force for society, then socio-economic disparity would be contested. With the Social Mobility Commission estimating that 5.2 million children will be living in poverty by 2022, Britain’s deliberate and ideological understanding of disadvantaged children will only continue.\n\nDouble disadvantage\n\nWe know that on average, children who are entitled to Free Schools Meals (FSM) underachieve compared to their more affluent peers. Even as former Education Secretary Michael Gove once rather crassly put it, “rich, thick kids’ achieve much more than poor clever ones.” This layer of disadvantage is historical and through decades of misplaced policymaking, it remains somewhat expected or a comfortable fact in British education. Richard Tawney even referred to social class as the ‘hereditary curse’ of the English education system and this was in 1931. Sociologists Jackson and Marsden wrote about the class-specific role of education to police and pacify the disadvantaged and educate and liberate the most affluent. Despite our education having connotations of social mobility, social class inequalities have polarised Britain, with schools being a microcosm of wider society. The double disadvantage includes what could be referred to as the COVID-induced disadvantage. Sure, exams will take place but is it really a fair process? Some regions across the country are facing stringent local lockdowns, student and staff absences are high as people self-isolate. This entrenches inequality even further. Our pupils have missed six months of schooling in its full-time capacity but for the most disadvantaged who may not have access to the internet thus remote learning facilities, therefore this disadvantaged is doubled. Historical disadvantages could be challenged by radical changes to policies but don’t hold your breath. The COVID disadvantage could be challenged by policy and providing adequate resources, timer and space for these disadvantaged children to adequately catch-up, progress and blossom. A three extension to exams is like expecting Pupil Premium to equalise generations of inequalities. This is absurd. We cannot address the post-COVID inequalities without unpacking and tackling those prior to the pandemic.\n\nRemaining ‘apolitical’\n\nThe final thought I had following yesterday’s announcement was actually a comment directed at me. I was told to “remain apolitical” and “just get on with it”. Apparently questioning political policies were against “mainstream edu-narratives” whatever that means. It is 2020, the year where we have conversations that matter, where we become comfortable with the uncomfortable and reflect in a deeper and more profound way. When did it ever become “political” to want to provide young people the best opportunity to succeed? We wear the weight of what we hear and seem – our experiences shape us. Whilst children walk into my classroom hungry and whilst little attempts to create a fairer society are in place, “apolitical” helps none of these children. Someone even had the audacity to say, “we are fed up with hearing about disadvantaged children.” I am fed up and exhausted with policies that fail to scratch the surface, also that my fellow professions being scapegoated for society’s evils and the mass fence-sitting and selective populism when it comes to dialogue about poverty, inequality, deprivation and disadvantage. We have to always keep in mind the contextual factors that make up our classrooms. The fact that we can track and trace these inequalities before the first bell hits. Even if we don’t challenge them so openly, I know my fellow teaching professionals will do so in their daily practice. We have been helping our learners ‘catch-up’ and make up ground before COVID and we will carry on doing so until a cure is found. For me, I will never stop talking about disadvantaged children. This is a cohort I was I once part of and an intellectual world I once inhabited. A man in a suit could never conceptualise let alone compensate for these hardships. With platform comes privilege and these disadvantaged children don’t need saviours, they need their voice heard. Time to scream at the top of out lungs like a siren. Do we develop selective amnesia as schools reopening and forget the antics of the media and politicians towards teachers?\n\nIn summary\n\nThe global pandemic has put teachers on the back foot and the announcement that GCSE and A-level exams will go ahead must be carefully considered. No one wants another algorithm shambles but after six months of remote learning, three weeks are not sufficient for teachers and learners. The wider structure of the education system needs to negate from the ideological moorings of high-stakes testing and reintroduce some alternative form of assessment. We may never see coursework return nor will teacher discretion through CAGs ever be fully respected, but with time ticking away, a DfE U-turn is definitely still on the cards. A three week delay to exams of simply plastering over the enormous chasms and canyons in education right now. These are wounds that need healing by taking teachers and students out the line of fire during such unprecedented times.\n\nAre exams the fairest way to assess student progress? Do we place their futures in the hands of Gavin Williamson after the summer exam shambles or just keep calm and carry on? The lesser of the two evils is the latter which is a damning indictment of the educational policy making that has perpetuated and entrenched inequalities. It is shocking. We have deeper questions and reflections as educators, including if exams are even the most effective measure of a child’s progress? People in this country have the uncanny ability to be the voice of those they have no social attachment to. It’s frightening.\n\nA final note on this disadvantaged children narrative. It has been peddled downstream but avoided the rapids. Until we consider wider contextual factors, structures and policies that have caused, maintained and sustained disadvantage, we are dangerously simplifying and depoliticising a debate about inequality. Disadvantaged children have been trying to ‘catch up’ for several decades, it is time we provide their teachers the support and guidance to take us out the line of fire.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nShuaib Khan\n\nTwitter: @shuaibkhan26\n\nPodcast with Becky Bainbridge – https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/antismalltalk-by-shuaib-khan/id1518310026?i=1000493249954\n\nEnemy of the State article – https://shuaibwriteskhanthinks.wordpress.com/2020/05/14/enemy-of-the-state/\n\nWhen ideology supersedes humanity.\n\n“Poverty is like punishment for a crime you didn’t commit.” ― Eli Khamarov\n\nAs Sunday dawns upon us and the clocks go back, where have we gone back to? It appears the days of Oliver Twist, where brutal levels of poverty, hopelessness, degradation and hunger play a salient part in the lives of millions of children in Britain. Back to the days where silence and emotional distancing from those suffering pushes their cries for help further into silence. Perhaps these days were never a thing of the past but rather our uncomfortable relationship with poverty was suppressed for so long it became a “normal”, “expected” and dare I say, “common sense” way of life in Britain.\n\nWe are still in 2020 and the world is still on its knees. The glimmer of hope in such unprecedented times comes in the form of a Footballer – Marcus Rashford. The 22-yeard-old Manchester United and England forward has fought tirelessly to help raise awareness of and find proactive solutions to child hunger in Britain. His work has been remarkable, yet just days after being awarded an MBE, which was recommended by the Prime Minister himself, this week 322 MPs voted against providing the most disadvantaged children free meals over school holidays. Marcus Rashford has made us all think about poverty in a more humane way.\n\n“Stick to football, Marcus.”\n\n“He needs to focus on the pitch.”\n\n“It isn’t your battle, Rashford.”\n\nThese are three comments I heard before Manchester United’s Champions League game on Tuesday. In the 87th minute, Rashford buried a beautiful winner to silence the doubters. Truth be told, he did stick to his job. A forwards role is to score and make goals – objective complete. Through interviews with Rashford, we know he wants to use his platform to support children who are entitled to free school meals, children just like him. When the results came in from the 2019 general election, the post-Brexit prosperity sentiment was wheeled out. The government assured us they would help “level up” Britain. Perhaps if they stuck to their job in this “levelling up” process, we would not have children starving.\n\nMy own experience of poverty is not something I have talked about openly. Growing up, whatever my family could not provide materially, they made up with love. However, it became painfully obvious that in our highly competitive playgrounds at school, not having what others had was alienating. I was ashamed to ask for help, the stigma was surreal but the hope that things would improve meant I placed all my faith in education. We reap the fruits of our labour but “making it” and having a voice only takes me back to the days of sharing a single bowl of cereal with my siblings. Also, the days where we would feel so ashamed to ask for seconds and thirds at lunch time. These pains were not just hunger pains, these are the pains of inequality that remain eternal.\n\nJodie and Melissa\n\nI wanted to share two very powerful stories with you. Both stories made me reconnect with the inequalities I have faced during my own life. Please note that both people in this story were signposted to support by multiple agencies. Let’s call them Jodie and Melissa.\n\nJodie is a single mum of two. She works two part-time jobs, both on zero hours contracts and with the continued rise of living costs, Jodie struggles to make ends meet. As a regular food bank user, I met Jodie at a local café where she was waitressing. After finishing my newspaper, I spotted her gather an uneaten sandwich from departed customers table. Making nothing of it until later I saw her wrap it in foil and place it in her bag. She immediately began to tear up, knowing that I saw her doing this and said, “please don’t tell my manager, I need my job. This is for my kids.” As someone who has always been able to articulate their words, I was speechless. As the café emptied, I waited for her and over a cup of tea she revealed her awful predicament. As a single widowed mum, who also cares for an elderly family member, Jodie was balancing all of society’s expectations and the weight of her children’s dreams. She was adamant her children would not have to endure the poverty she was facing and faced as a child herself. I could see first-hand how this very malnourished lady was almost at breaking point where diving into bins at work was the only way to make sure she could get through a shift at work. We are the 5th richest country in the world and I can only imagine out of the 14 million plus people in Britain who live in some form of poverty, this is a daily reality.\n\nMelissa was a teacher but after a mental health breakdown, she left her role. Unable to provide for herself, she moved into accommodation provided by the local authority. I met Melissa at our local food bank where I was dropping off some donations. We struck up a conversation after I mentioned being an educator and within minutes, I was wiping away tears. It struck me. Poverty and food insecurity can happen to anyone at any given time. Melissa explained how she went from a somewhat privileged white, able-bodied young professional female and within six months of purchasing her first home, her life was turned upside down. With no real family to turn to after relocating for her teaching post, Melissa’s mental health breakdown was the result of chronic stress and depression. I sat listening to her and it was heart-breaking. A teaching or any professional salary provides us with some form of comfort and status, losing it all in the blink of an eye is such a scary thought. It can happen to anyone at any time and we would hope that the system we endorse so blindly through taxation would provide us with a safety net if such times do come. Melissa was living off a mere £72 a week, which was to cover her rent, expenses and basic necessities. From living in a new-build home, she now lived off cans of beans, free teas and coffees at her support group and the kind donations at the food bank. This is reality for so many. I truly believe we wear the weight of the things we see and hear. I am Melissa, we are Melissa. Again, in one of the wealthiest nations on Earth, how are such levels of inequality accepted?\n\n“Take some responsibility”\n\nI did not want to bombard my readers with data and the fact we do have over four million children living in poverty. The global pandemic has exposed the deeply entrenched inequalities in Britain as well as the flaws in our approach towards humanitarian issues on our own shores. I just want to unpack this past weeks vote against providing the most disadvantaged children free meals over school holidays.\n\nCulture of poverty – This is a farce and a fallacy. Whenever we read about poverty, the poverty porn or fetishisation of deprivation is the frame used to conceptualise, simplify and down peg the true complexity of poverty. Telling someone who is poor to, “take some responsibility” for themselves and their loved ones is the most reductive thing to say. As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “It’s all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstraps, but it is cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.” Repeatedly providing this nebulous rhetoric brings exactly what to the table? It certainly doesn’t bring groceries to it or fill the tummy of a poor child. Britain does operate with this very neo-liberal Thatcherite veneer of poverty. At a time of austerity, cuts to mainline services and growing disparity between the haves and have nots, telling someone to “take responsibility” is such back-handed ideological commentary. When did it become a crime to cry out for help? When did we become so entrenched with political zealousness that we regurgitate the callous rhetoric of our political leaders who have denied the most disadvantaged children the basic human right to be fed? A commentary that is Dickensian in nature, built upon shaming the most deprived. Also, to depoliticise and individualise poverty, as if to render the polarised social structures invisible in dialogue about inequality. This ideological ping-pong is used as an “intellectual” argument to continue downsizing structures of support for the most disadvantaged and dismantle any form of opposition to a status quo that already represents elitist and corporate interests rather than those of the general public. I am sick to the core of the Vicky Pollard or Benefits Street tunnel vision we have of those in poverty. The notion of “if they chose to feed their children rather than smoke and drink.” This offers nothing. It creates further emotional distancing and pits us against people whose children may share the same classroom as our own. I am never one to deny agency but without considering the impacts of social structures, blaming individual’s and their lifestyles as opposed to inequalities simply exacerbate those inequalities further. How is it ever ok for MPs to get a pay rise whilst millions are trapped in poverty or in fear of losing their jobs during a pandemic? Poverty is political in the sense that it has been formed out of political choices and failures to adequately tackle structural inequalities around us. Blasé explanations and nebulous comments from people who have lived in their own realm of social prestige will never tackle poverty. In fact, this culture of poverty is the noose around the neck of the most disadvantaged who are grasping for every breath as Marcus Rashford fights for every meal.\n\nUncomfortable truths – I think since the pandemic started and Black Lives Matter began to expose the fragility in the psyche of the status quo, Britain has had to face some uncomfortable truths. Marcus Rashford has got us talking about poverty in a more humane and kinder way. His social media threads show people connecting, networking, supporting one another and helping find proactive solutions to many uncomfortable truths. Part of the British experience is the acceptance poverty and inequality with little efforts to tackle the true causes of it. A lot of this comes down to paddling through and being rewarded by our own hard work that we are self-driven success stories and “making it” means leaving behind generations of inequality. Meritocracy is a myth and this is succinctly illustrated by the stagnation of social mobility and underachievement of children who are entitled to free school meals. Poverty is the proverbial elephant in the room. It is also an inter-generational wound that will not disappear by providing children with laptops (10,000 which remain missing), through planting magic money trees, Pupil Premium coupons or broadcasting our donations. Confronting the uncomfortable truths of poverty is done through understanding, empathy and compassion, all of which Marcus Rashford encompasses. Only when we realign ourselves with these principles and not ideology, can we then mobilise and offer support to our most disadvantaged.\n\nAre we being voyeuristic? Let’s face it, out of those 322 MPs, how many have experienced poverty or hunger? How many voted in favour of austerity? How many claimed to want to “level up” Britain but are now complicit in starving disadvantaged children? There is a clear and obvious disconnect between what is morally right and what is ideologically “right.” We watch on in disgust as Williamson, Gibb, Donelan, Keegan and Ford – all of whom have a vest interest in education and our young people voted against feeding our most disadvantaged children over the summer. I am going to make this crystal clear too, the way the disadvantaged children narrative was bastardised to unsafely reopen schools is absolutely disgraceful. These MPs should be ashamed of themselves and to hear former Education Secretary say that she took offence to being branded a “Tory Scum” thus out of contempt voted against the free meal scheme. Goodness gracious me. What an absolute disgrace. To be so triggered, fragile and incensed by accountability and social justice, beggars belief why these people even decided to go into politics. When Chancellor Rishi Sunak ploughed £500 million into his second-wave of COVID-inducing eat out to help out scheme, but they couldn’t spare £1 million to feed the most disadvantaged children, you cannot feel any more astounded. Or perhaps the fact we have lived under austerity for a decade, saving an estimated £12 billion annually, how on Earth has national borrowing gone up? How is the country still broke? Dearie me! This is not a lefty liberal intelligentsia critique, these are stone cold facts about how the country is being run. The fact there was a vote to feed our most disadvantaged is a damning inditement of this country. What a time to be alive! However, we can be the change as individuals and we are the change that Marcus Rashford is looking for and inspiring. Hundreds of businesses, many of which are on the brink of closure because of the pandemic have opened their door this half term to provide meals for these deprived children. We can be voyeurs, watch on feeling outraged or we can donate to a food bank, volunteer at a local charity, support our local businesses, the list is endless. Ultimately, if we carry on waiting for Superman to save us in the form of political personnel, poverty, inequality and hopelessness will only worsen. Nothing ever changes if we watch on from a position of comfort and detachment. It is on us to do what Marcus Rashford is doing. To be inspired, use our platforms in whichever capacity they come, to never turn our heads at injustice and create a better future for us all. We may not be able to solve all of humanity’s problems, so let’s make it our goal not to add to them either.\n\nLet’s name them\n\nThis is important.\n\n318 Conservative MPs: Nigel Adams (Selby and

Julian Lewis (New Forest East).\n\nTellers for the noes were Conservative MPs Tom Pursglove (Corby) and Leo Docherty (Aldershot).\n\nIn Summary\n\nThis has been an incredibly challenging year for everyone. However, alongside the pandemic, a double disadvantage has hit the most deprived in society. Instead of beating down, we should be helping up those who are in need. No child chooses to grow up in poverty and at a time where asking for help remains taboo, we must change how we frame the battles of others. The stories of Jodie and Melissa illustrate the fragility of status, the hardships of poverty in 21st Century Britain and how it can happen to any of us.\n\nPoverty is inglorious and cannot carry on. No one becomes poor, unworthy or irresponsible overnight. This is political. It always has been. A u-turn is expected as the establishment has been given much food for thought whilst they deprived the most disadvantaged any food at all.\n\nOur MPs have let is down, the 322 disgraced individuals have let down an entire generation of children. These are not leaders or role models. Marcus Rashford is everything they will never be. He is our national treasure. A remarkable human being who is using his platform for the betterment of society. Someone who understands the intricacies and complexities of being disadvantaged. I am inspired and I hope you all are too.\n\nTogether we can #ENDCHILDFOODPOVERTY. Ideology will never overcome human dignity. Ameen.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nShuaib Khan\n\nTwitter: @shuaibkhan26\n\nhttps://shuaibwriteskhanthinks.wordpress.com/2020/09/08/our-national-treasure/\n\nFareShare – https://fareshare.org.uk/\n\nThe FoodAid Network – https://www.foodaidnetwork.org.uk\n\nExams – a critical reflection\n\n“Learning happens in the minds and souls, not in the databases of multiple-choice tests” – Sir Ken Robinson\n\nLast week I hosted podcast with Karl Pupe (@actionheroteacher). Karl spoke so eloquently about the Victorian nature of our education system and the need for innovation and context-centric pedagogical approaches to engage and educate our students. These are my reflections from that conversation and Karl’s underlying question, “What is the purpose of education?”\n\nThe curious case of Charlie.\n\nI met Charlie during my NQT year. A tall lad who loved football, playing guitar and Philosophy. Charlie was in my boy-heavy Religious Studies class. This was a tough crowd, some serious behaviour issues and being in Year 11, the stakes were high. As an NQT I was keen work with this class and also adhere to the school teaching and learning policies which included fortnightly assessments. My class HATED assessments, exams and just the thought of sitting in silence with relentless pen-to-paper pressure. A handful of years on, I realise the anxieties of my students back then and the need for radical changes in how we assess the knowledge, and more importantly, the skills of our students.\n\nExams and assessments are the be-all and end-all of education. It is ‘common sense’ and rather banal that we can develop an understanding of our students progress through an assessment or exam. A grade, whether this is a letter or a number, it supposedly conceptualises all that our students know about a specific topic. From as early as reception, children sit assessments in their various forms which become numerically translated, added to data bases and Excel spreadsheets. Data, exams and assessments are big business. Many schools have roles and TLRs allocated to exams, data and assessment. However, with the exam debacle over the past summer, is it time we ditch exams?\n\nAt the heart of all pedagogical discussions come reflection, analysis and a broader understanding of context. Certain ideas, viewpoints and narratives have become almost biblical in pedagogical literature. A Head of Department once told me, “lesson, assessment, lesson, assessment, lesson, assessment.” This rigid bureaucratic structure made lessons feel somewhat like Groundhog Day. I prepared students for assessments, they either got their target grade or they did not. We would then spend a lesson using purple pen to ‘reflect’ and ‘improve’ their grade and we moved onto the next cycle. It was the cookie-cutter approach to teaching and learning. As schools begin to embed the much adored ‘retrieval practice’ and ensure students can retain knowledge for examinations, despite both ideas being completely valid depending on context, learning is more complex. Our cognitive development is more complex than to simply aim to improve our long-term memory. Finally, education is more complex than examinations and assessments. Most teachers I would assume step into the profession because they believe in developing their students both academically as well as to become active members of our democracy. The holistic and intangible element of pedagogy can be lost whilst there is such an over-reliance of examinations.\n\nSince 2010, education has seen far-reaching changes as the disconnect between policy makers and educators continues to grow. But it has taken a global pandemic these cracks in the education system to become chasms and canyons. Many students have missed six months of school, so in GCSE and A-level terms, that is potentially a quarter of the time to complete their respected courses. Today, the DfE announced that the 2021 exams will take place which adds fuel to the existing ‘catch up’ programme fire. When ‘disadvantaged children’ falling behind were key rationale behind the hasty decision to reopen schools, this era of anti-expert has taken a turn for the worse. Fellow teachers are trying to help plug gaps in knowledge but the gap and gulf in attainment due to social class remains unspoken of.\n\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson himself has said, “we know that examinations are the fairest way of measuring a student’s ability and accomplishments, including the most disadvantaged”. Summer 2021 exams have even been pushed back three weeks as that will clearly compensate for six months of lost learning won’t it? It’s almost as nebulous and absurd as to say Pupil Premium can compensate for generations of socio-economic inequality. Also, with declining social mobility, the children from disadvantaged backgrounds inheriting generational inequalities and international data all stating the opposite, are you sure, Gavin? That aside, perhaps considering such unprecedented times, a radical overhaul of how we assess the effectiveness of teachers and also teaching and learning is required. Examinations in their current format fail to bridge gaps, offer equality of opportunity, empower our learners, develop our teachers and provide an accurate broader picture of the knowledge and skills accumulated and cultivated in our learning environments.\n\nBack in 2013, Michael Gove was warned about the pressures and dangers of high-stakes testing and assessments. Yet, with ideology rushing through the course of his veins, Gove pushed through with changes to educational policies that were never mandated by those effected by such policies on a daily basis. A ‘knowledge rich’ curriculum, changes to early years frameworks, obsessive and nebulous comparative international testing data (PISA, TIMSS and PIRLS), the scrapping of coursework, new GCSE grading systems and linear A-levels were hurried through under the veneer of ‘standards’. Education was being made ‘rigorous’ and teachers had to implement such these policies under our performative and competitive educational culture. Exams and assessments became the yardstick of success for both teachers and their learners. A simplistic correlation has been made and remained central in conversations about targets, appraisals, performance management, Ofsted frameworks and league tables. How do we know a student knows what we have taught them? Assessment/Examination. It is THAT black and white, apparently.\n\nDo you have any alternatives?\n\nFrom the vantage point of social justice and equality, no catch up programmes could make up for the six months schools were closed. Teachers worked tirelessly from the beginning of lockdown to now but the loss of time, routines and opportunities to ensure students are best placed to sit examinations in the summer of 2021 is questionable. With the additional workload in mind, alongside the obvious gaps in learning and disruption caused by the global pandemic, maybe it is time for a radical overhaul of our exam-reliant education system. Perhaps even, examinations could be altered, changed and supplemented with something else to judge our students, their knowledge and skills. Realistically, what options are available?\n\nExternally- assessed coursework,\n\nTeacher assessments,\n\nPortfolios or e-portfolios,\n\nE-assessments\n\nThese are just a few and a non-exhaustive list. Again, the straightforward correlation between assessment and knowledge is not so straightforward. I don’t have the answer but the solution certainly is not anxiety-inducing, do or die, high stakes testing. How many teachers are left disillusioned and disgruntled when a totally random exam question appears in a specimen paper or the real exam?! At the heart of any alternatives to moving away from rigid and inequitable examination and data-driven methods ideals, there must come greater professional trust placed in teachers. With the current political climate, this remains an incredibly unlikely utopia. But one day, maybe just one day, teachers and policy makers will meet somewhere in the field of unity for the students.\n\nThe late Sir Ken Robinson spent many years talking about the need to embed creativity and innovation back into education. As even with vocational education, the exam-centric nature of knowledge and demonstrating progress is creating a very standardised one-size-fits-all approach for teaching and learning. Teaching is so much more complex as is learning. Both deserve respect and their practitioners deserve the time and space to exert their expertise.\n\nBack to Charlie\n\nCharlie struggled to concentrate in class and his assessments and mocks continued to fall well under his predicted grade. I was under pressure, he was apathetic and intervention season sprung upon us. Charlie was a great thinker and could remember almost infinite details but suffered, in his own words, “a mental block” when he got to exams. He was anxious at the sight of an assessment and his class would do everything for “5 more minutes of revision.” It became painfully obvious to me that my class did not have the study skills to make notes, to revise, retrieve, reflect and then articulate their ideas in examinations. These snap-shot assessments could never conceptualise the engagement, love for learning, skills and discussions my students were developing in lessons. With this class, I changed focus and moved away from working to exams to helping students have the skills to attempt these exams. But when you are fighting external pressures to meet deadlines and expectations, we do get boxed in to a corner. Results are the only real empirical que for us to say, “I have done by job.” It is tough. In the end, Charlie got an 8 which was two grades above his target grade and on results day in his typically nonchalant manner he said, “Khan, I just thought out loud in that exam.” For a child like Charlie and we all know a Charlie, exams are not the best way for us as teachers to showcase his skills and talents as a student.\n\nIn Summary\n\nI have sat over a hundred exams in my life. From infants school all the way to undergraduate level and at face value, they are the only tangible measure of my qualifications. This does not mean the knowledge and skills we develop are not of equal importance but rather, examinations and assessments take precedence. This year was a real opportunity to reflect, reconsider and radically overhaul our dated education system. Pen to paper examinations have existed for centuries but as Karl Pupe reminded me, education remains in a time capsule and teachers and students remain straitjacketed by traditionalists methods. Such methods do have a time and space but if we analyse education and its purposes more holistically, are exams really what education is all about? What is the purpose of education? Why do we teach? Is all knowledge objective? These are all questions we need to be asking ourselves as educators.\n\nI also expect a U-turn from the government with regards to the 2021 exam season still taking place. The pressures placed on schools, teachers and students to ‘catch up’ is unparalleled. In some regions the infection rates are leading to many pupils having extended periods of absence. The cracks that appeared in our education system have had bandages placed over them but in reality, it is painfully obvious what needs to change. Learning is so much more complex than an examination. It needs to mean more and be worth more too.\n\nThank you for reading\n\nShuaib Khan\n\nBlack Lives Matter revisited – my lessons and reflections.\n\n“I can’t make people not afraid of black people. I don’t know what’s going on. I can’t explain what’s happening in your head. But maybe if I show up every day as a human, a good human, doing wonderful things, loving my family, loving your kids, taking care of things that I care about—maybe, just maybe that work will pick away at the scabs of your discrimination.

A vicious, inhumane and awful killing of an African American man at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. The outcry, protests and uproar was like nothing we have seen before. The world finally appeared to unite and Black Lives Mattered. However, let’s get this clear too, it was not just about George Floyd. It was about Breonna Taylor, Tarika Wilson, Trayvon Martin, Stephen Lawrence, I could go on. We are four months on, so where is vigour, energy and drive to reshape the social fabric of society?\n\nBlack Lives Matter is everyone’s issue because racism is everyone’s issue. However, some say that’s it’s impossible to retain the same level of vigour and energy for any movement. For the majority of BAME people, the social trends of late autumn and the summer were as close to a breakthrough as we were ever going to get. A breakthrough to challenge cultural norms, values and traditions that have for so long been the bastion of implicit racial biases. Tearing down statues was a symbolism of the removal of racial divisions and the celebratory rhetoric of the evils of empire and slavery. With over 21,000 public complaints against the dance group Diversity for incorporating Black Lives Matter into one their routines, people now appear to be triggered by Alesha Dixon wearing a garment. Britain’s uneasy relationship with race grows more uncomfortable. But where are we now? What’s next?
