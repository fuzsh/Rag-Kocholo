        "text": "Conservative MP Amanda Solloway has said she has been left “incredibly surprised and disappointed” after the Labour-led Derby City Council “refused” to buy homes at the former La Gondola site for council housing stock. The Derby North MP expressed her anger after it was suggested in a recent cabinet meeting that the council “had recently turned down the opportunity to purchase properties” for council home stock at the former hotel and restaurant.\n\nThe well-known site has stood derelict for a number of years. But last year a planning appeal by developer Elgie Properties was upheld by the Planning Inspectorate – meaning the Osmaston Road site can now be transformed into new residential accommodation, comprising 42 new flats.\n\nAt the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, January 10, councillors approved plans for the authority to buy 13 new-build homes in South Derbyshire to be run by the council’s social housing arm Derby Homes. This came just after another meeting heard that the city was facing “unprecedented” housing pressures with more than 8,000 households on a waiting list for council homes in Derby at a time when not many are available to move into.\n\nDiscussion on the topic saw Conservative leader Steve Hassall say that he understood that the council had refused to buy new homes at the La Gondola site – questioning why the council were buying homes outside the city boundary and refusing properties within it.\n\nLabour councillor Shiraz Khan, cabinet member for housing, replied: “I do not believe this (La Gondola site) is a better development than what we are buying. I don’t believe people who would have lived there would have benefited fully from the accommodation that is needed. It’s quality of accommodation that we need, not just quantity. There is no comparison between this site and the acquisition of the 13 properties.”\n\nCouncil leader Baggy Shanker added: “I think more importantly, the last time I drove past the La Gondola site it was a derelict building. They are not properties ready now to purchase and return to our housing stock.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Derby North MP Amanda Solloway said: “I was incredibly surprised and disappointed to hear the response from the cabinet member for housing, property and regulatory services that the possibility to purchase 42 flats for affordable housing did not fit the council’s priorities (amid) significant pressure on our social housing stock.\n\n“The cabinet member’s reason for rejecting this development, which provides more homes, in a more appropriately located area than the properties the council has bought – a proposal I also support - was entirely unsubstantiated and has been repudiated by the Planning Inspectorate. The cabinet member should explain to those waiting for homes exactly why this site, and the 42 properties it could offer, do not fit with the council’s priorities.”\n\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) asked Derby City Council if it could reveal any details as to what exactly the council was offered in terms of housing at the La Gondola site but the council did not answer this. Instead, the authority said: “Not every site or proposed development matches (the) criteria (for new council homes in Derby)”.\n\nA spokesperson for Derby City Council added: “Providing new council homes is a key priority for the council to address the large numbers waiting for suitable properties and the council adopts several strategies to meet this.\n\n“Since 2018, we have delivered 375 additional affordable council homes in Derby through acquisitions and new builds and provided genuinely affordable quality homes for 375 single people and families registered on Homefinder. In addition, we have over 70 new-build homes due to start on-site in 2024.\n\n“We are equally committed, however, to providing quality homes and improving the sustainability of our council housing, which will reduce bills for tenants and contribute to the city’s net-zero ambition.\n\n“Our new-build homes are designed to achieve a high space standard and thermal efficiency and design as demonstrated by our recent provision of our first four zero-carbon homes. Our aim is for the next 70 to also be zero-carbon. Not every site or proposed development matches these criteria.”\n\nFollowing the meeting, Tory councillor Hassall said: “The decision to not work with a developer to construct affordable housing on the site is a regrettable short-sighted approach from Derby City Council’s leadership. The responses from both the council leader and the cabinet member for housing, property and regulatory services were totally inadequate and are at odds with their stated objective to sustain and increase the portfolio of Derby Homes.”"
