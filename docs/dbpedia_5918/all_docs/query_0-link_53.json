        "text": "St. Modwen Logistics has completed of the first phase of a £46.5m project to bring warehouse space to Derby.\n\nThe development – which has been delivered by Winvic and will see the transformation of 67-acres of brownfield site as part of a partnership between St. Modwen Logistics, Derby City Council and Network Rail – expects to bring up to 1,250 jobs as it bids to be selected as one of the government’s newly announced investment zones.\n\nSt. Modwen Park Derby comprises four units totalling 303,000 sq ft and was opened at an event alongside a host of local dignitaries including Amanda Solloway, MP for Derby North; Chris Poulter, Leader of Derby Council; and the Mayor of Derby, Councillor Robin Wood.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Solloway said: “It’s been fascinating to see St Modwen Park taking shape on what was waste ground next to the Wyvern Centre, but now that I have attended the launch event it’s incredible to consider the huge benefits that it will bring to Derby in terms of job creation and the provision of high quality warehouse space and the kind of modern, dedicated office space that the city and the wider Midlands needs if it is to grow and prosper.\n\n“We have always spoken of Derby’s position in the country and its excellent transport links, and this development, and Phase 2, when it is completed, are perfect examples of the how the city is using them to its advantage.”\n\nRobert Richardson, development director, St. Modwen Logistics, added: “It is great to officially declare St. Modwen Park Derby open and to see the support the development has had from the local council and other stakeholders.\n\n“This project is symbolic of our commitment to invest in areas where we feel we can provide local economic growth and generate jobs for the local region. There is currently a huge appetite for warehouse space like this is across the Midlands and the North and these units were built to address this.\n\n“We are already in advanced discussions with parties about these units and look forward to welcoming businesses to this space ahead of commencing work on phase two.”"
