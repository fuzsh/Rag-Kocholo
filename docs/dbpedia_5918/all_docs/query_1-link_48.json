        "text": "Derby North MP Amanda Solloway had a taste of life as an apprentice at Derby train maker Alstom after the firm announced a recruitment drive following a big Government order.\n\nThe MP visited the UK’s largest supplier of trains – formerly known as Bombardier – after it was awarded part of a £2 billion contract to produce trains for HS2.\n\nAlstom is currently offering opportunities for 30 apprentices and graduates with roles for engineers as well as jobs in project management and finance.\n\nShe was given a tour of the Anglia Aventra Production Line at the Litchurch Lane factory by apprentices Hannah Robinson and Aiden Blake.\n\nThey showed her how to connect brake hoses underneath one of the carriages and explained the benefits of working at the UK’s largest rolling stock factory.\n\nMs Solloway said: “The city has a long and proud association with the rail industry so it’s absolutely brilliant to see this engineering expertise continuing to put the city on the map.\n\n“Aiden and Hannah were so enthusiastic about their roles and their apprenticeships which is allowing them to earn a salary and gain vital experience in this industry.\n\n“They were also very good teachers and I particularly enjoyed rolling my sleeves up and following their instructions – although as a regular train user I was glad that they double checked my work.”\n\nThe new Alstom jobs have been created after the company was awarded a £2 billion contract by the Government in a joint venture with Hitachi Rail to produce 52 trains for HS2.\n\nThe MP said: “Derby has a proud tradition of engineering excellence and I'm delighted a new generation of apprentices like Aiden and Hannah are strengthening our reputation as a national centre of excellence.\n\n“Aiden has been at Alstom for more than two years, while Hannah had only started at the company six months ago, but they were both absolutely loving the opportunities they were being given.\n\n“They are quite literally building the future – both for themselves and for companies like Alstom – and I was very proud to see the future of Derby as a train maker in safe hands.”"
