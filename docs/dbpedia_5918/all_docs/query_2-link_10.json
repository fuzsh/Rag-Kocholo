        "text": "Despite difficulties I was fortunate to have strong enough foundations in my education and after many years finally felt ready to pursue a political career, even if that meant failure.\n\nHowever, many young people are not so lucky. Mental health remains an issue which can lead to people dropping out of education.\n\nThat’s why, like so many Blue Collar Conservatives, I care passionately that we must we must do all we can to support people’s mental wellbeing.\n\nThe Conservatives are at the forefront of supporting those with mental health issues, with mental health services receiving a budget growth of £2.3 billion to help fund children and young peoples’ crisis teams.\n\nWhile there is always more that can be done, we are heading in the right direction.\n\nHaving been a school governor for more than 20 years, I believe that education is crucial for our young people.\n\nI am a Conservative because I want to enable and support people to fulfil their dreams and make their own way in life through hard work and determination.\n\nI also firmly believe we must give people back control of their lives through a positive agenda which is confident about the country’s future and empowers people in their everyday lives.\n\nWithin the community, I have spoken with and visited many amazing organisations in Derby who help make sure that we do get it right for everyone.\n\nEngineered Learning in my constituency runs an engineering workshop where young people who have fallen out of school systems, can gain the qualifications they need to find employment for the future.\n\nIt was incredible to speak to some of the young people and hear from themselves how attending the workshop has genuinely helped them to achieve, avoid getting into trouble with the police and even prison.\n\nThe Coronavirus has made it difficult for me to visit my Dad who lives in Wales, but he is so incredibly proud of my achievements and sits in the front room of his council house smoking his pipe, looking out for me on the TV. When I do visit, he likes to show me off and very loudly ask me ‘so what is it like in Parliament then?’.\n\nIt was my Dad of course who inspired me to get into politics, he was always reading the paper and interested in what is cracking off politically. He’s like so many Blue-Collar Conservatives who believe that hard work pays off and opportunities are there if you look for them."
