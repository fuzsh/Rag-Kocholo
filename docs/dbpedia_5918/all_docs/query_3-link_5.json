        "text": "The Government has launched a new scheme that aims to make it easier for businesses to access the full range of support that the Government currently offers.\n\nThe Government has said that one of its core priorities is to “make Britain the best place in the world to start and grow a business”. As part of this drive, they have launched the Business Support Campaign.\n\nAs part of the campaign, BEIS is bringing all of the various support together in one place, www.businesssupport.gov.uk. The support is categorised into four themes on the site, to help businesses find what they are looking for:\n\n• Finance and business planning - including funding for new businesses and business growth, dealing with late payments, and equity and debt finance\n\n• Leadership and Talent - including mentoring schemes, help with recruiting, developing leadership skills or joining a network.\n\n• Innovation and Technology - including funding for innovation, adoption of new technology, intellectual property and finding partners for innovation.\n\n• Exporting - including support for doing business internationally and expanding online.\n\nThe website provides links to local organisations which can understand the challenges and opportunities in that geographic area, such as local Growth Hubs and Local Enterprise Partnerships. The site also signposts the financial support on offer from the British Business Bank, which has supported 90,000 smaller businesses with over £7 billion in investment or loans. Start-up loans are also set to be expanded\n\nThe move has been welcomed by Conservative MP, Amanda Solloway. Solloway, who represents the constituency of Derby North and was recently promoted to a ministerial position at BEIS, said:\n\n“I have a background in business, and I know that it can sometimes be difficult to navigate all the information that is available out there. The Government does a lot to help businesses, rightly, and the new format will help them so they can grow and develop. I hope this will go a long way to regenerating our high streets, particularly here in Derby.”"
