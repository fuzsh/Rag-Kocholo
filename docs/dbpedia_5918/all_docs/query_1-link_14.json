        "text": "In Westminster, we have experienced the first digital parliament, and now continue to find new ways to allow business to continue as usual with strict social distancing measures in place. Since the election in December 2019, we have voted on laws and regulations that we would have never expected to, such as to legislate for people to stay at home in order to protect our NHS and save lives.\n\nMore importantly, I’ve seen the impact this pandemic has had on my constituency of Derby North.\n\nI have received a high volume of correspondence from concerned constituents and business owners and I feel honoured that I can be of guidance and assistance to them during these really difficult times.\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak we have been guided by the science and continue to do so as we now start to return to a ‘new normal’.\n\nAs the Minister for Science, Research and Innovation, I am incredibly proud and grateful to all of our amazing scientists and researchers who have guided our nation through life-threatening times.\n\nCovid-19 is a novel virus, and so there is so much we are yet to learn about it, such as how long an individual’s antibodies last for.\n\nHowever, we have also quickly identified the vulnerabilities which can make the disease more fatal to an individual, as well as discovering the use of Dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid treatment which can help save lives of those who are critically ill with the virus.\n\nI am so delighted to see local businesses back open for trade as this is just vital for our ability to recover economically.\n\nHowever, we will not come out of this until we have naturally achieved herd immunity or a vaccine has been developed, and so it is absolutely crucial that we continue to listen to the science and stay alert when we are out and about to help prevent the spread.\n\nIt is our amazingly talented scientists and researchers who will play one of the most vital parts in overcoming and defeating the virus for generations to come."
