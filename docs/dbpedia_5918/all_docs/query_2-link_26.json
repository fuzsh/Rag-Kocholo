        "text": "What were the key election results in the East Midlands?\n\nThe results have been declared at constituencies across the East Midlands in the UK general election, with some major shocks emerging from the vote.\n\nLabour made big gains across the region, but there were also notable wins for smaller parties and independent candidates.\n\nIndependent wins seat with rallying call 'for Gaza'\n\nIndependent candidate Shockat Adam Patel caused a huge shock in Leicester South by narrowly beating Labour's Jon Ashworth.\n\nMr Patel secured 14,739 votes to Mr Ashworth's 13,760.\n\nDuring his winning speech, Mr Patel said: \"This is for Gaza.\"\n\n\"This was a grassroots, community, constituency-run campaign, which is an indication to those that have been in power for so long that you cannot forget the people that you serve,\" he added.\n\nMr Ashworth, who held the seat since 2011, said it had been \"the greatest honour and privilege of my life\" serving Leicester South for 13 years.\n\nThe departing Mr Ashworth congratulated Mr Patel but said he did not believe an independent MP would be able to deliver for voters in Leicester South.\n\nConservative Shivani Raja won Leicester East from Labour - the party's sole seat gained on election night.\n\nShe said she was \"thrilled\" to end decades of Labour dominance in the constituency.\n\nMs Raja beat Labour's Rajesh Agrawal into second place with a 4,426 majority.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats's Zuffar Haq came third.\n\nFormer MPs Claudia Webbe, who stood as an independent, and Keith Vaz, of One Leicester, who previously held the seat for 32 years, came fourth and fifth respectively.\n\nAnderson holds Ashfield\n\nLee Anderson held on to his seat in Ashfield and secured a first win for Reform UK on the night.\n\nMr Anderson was elected as a Conservative in 2019 but was suspended earlier this year after refusing to apologise for claims Islamists had \"control\" of London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\nHe then defected to Reform UK.\n\nHe received 17,062 votes, with the Labour Party's Rhea Keehn finishing in second with 11,553 votes.\n\nHe said \"this wonderful place that I call my home\" will have a \"massive say\" in how the country is shaped, adding: \"I want my country back and Ashfield can play their part in that.\"\n\nAshfield Independent candidate Jason Zadrozny finished third with 6,276 votes.\n\nWipeout in Derbyshire\n\nIn Derbyshire, Labour gained nine seats from the Conservatives, while holding on to Derby South and Chesterfield.\n\nLabour's Jon Pearce has won the High Peak seat from Conservative Robert Largan.\n\nLinsey Farnsworth, who beat Nigel Mills to take the Amber Valley seat, said: \"After 14 years of Conservative chaos, you've chosen change.\n\n\"I want to pay tribute to Nigel as the outgoing MP. I want to give you my personal assurance the constituency is safe in my hands.\"\n\nDerbyshire Dales was won by John Whitby, who beat incumbent Sarah Dines by 350 votes.\n\nMr Whitby described the result as \"historic\" and said the country was \"desperate to rid itself of the Conservative government that has fought itself and fought against the interests of its people\".\n\nCatherine Atkinson took Derby North from Amanda Solloway, while Jonathan Davies beat Luke Gardiner in Mid Derbyshire.\n\nLouise Jones won the North East Derbyshire seat for Labour.\n\nConservative Lee Rowley, who vacates his seat after seven years, said: \"If I have in any tiny way been able to help North East Derbyshire to progress, to get better, I'll be happy.\"\n\nLabour’s Samantha Niblett won the South Derbyshire seat from Conservative MP of 14 years, Heather Wheeler.\n\nMs Niblett said: \"I will work tirelessly in your interests and be the voice of the entire community down in Westminster.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ms Wheeler said: \"I wish everybody well with the new incumbent. I regret everything that's happened, but it's a new dawn.\n\n\"Good luck South Derbyshire, you'll need it.\"\n\nLabour's Adam Thompson took the Erewash seat with 17,224 votes (40.1%).\n\nMaggie Throup, a Conservative who had held the seat since 2015, received 11,365 votes.\n\nNatalie Fleet has won for Labour in Bolsover, pushing former Conservative MP Mark Fletcher into second place.\n\nMs Fleet received 17,197 votes (40.5%), while Mr Fletcher, who took the seat from Dennis Skinner in 2019, got 10,874 (25.6%).\n\nIn Nottinghamshire, Labour has gained Rushcliffe from the Conservatives - the first time the party has won in the constituency for 54 years.\n\nJames Naish, leader of Bassettlaw District Council, won the seat from Ruth Edwards with 25,291 votes.\n\nMs Edwards, who received 17,865 votes (30.9%), won the seat in 2019 with a majority of more than 7,600, having taken over from long-standing Tory MP, Lord Ken Clarke.\n\nReform UK's James Grice finished third with 6,353 votes (11%).\n\nLabour also gained Broxtowe from the Conservatives, as Juliet Campbell claimed 15,579 votes (47.4%).\n\nConservative Darren Henry, husband of the former Nottinghamshire police and crime commissioner Caroline Henry, has lost his seat after receiving 11,158 votes (23.3%).\n\nLilian Greenwood has retained her seat in Nottingham South, with 15,579 votes (47.4%).\n\n\"We've waited 14 years for this, so you'll have to excuse me if I can't stop smiling,\" she said.\n\nTory candidate Zarmeena Quraishi finished second, with 5,285 votes (16.1%).\n\nLast Tory in Nottinghamshire\n\nNewark's Robert Jenrick is the last Conservative MP in Nottinghamshire.\n\nHe thanked his local team for their work, saying it was \"a huge compliment\" to them that his constituents offered their backing \"against almost every poll\".\n\nFormer deputy chairman of the party, Brendan Clarke-Smith, lost in Bassetlaw to Labour's Jo White, while farmer Mark Spencer lost the new Sherwood Forest constituency to Labour's Michelle Welsh.\n\nElsewhere in Nottinghamshire, current leader of the county council, Ben Bradley, lost his seat in Mansfield to Labour's Steve Yemm.\n\nMr Bradley, who was also defeated in his bid for the new East Midlands mayor role in May, said it had been \"an immense privilege and honour\" to serve as an MP.\n\nConservatives Ruth Edwards and Tom Randall also lost their seats.\n\nLabour holds Nottingham\n\nThe three Nottingham constituencies have been held by Labour candidates Lilian Greenwood, Alex Norris and Nadia Whittome.\n\nMs Whittome, who held in Nottingham East, said: \"The last time Labour won a general election, I was just eight years old.\n\n\"What we are seeing is truly historic.\"\n\nMr Norris is now the MP for the new constituency of Nottingham North and Kimberley.\n\nHe said: \"Our city has cried out for serious change for a very long time, and it seems that we just might have got it.\n\n\"I believe that with a Labour government, a Labour mayor, and a Labour council, we can do some very special things.\"\n\nLiz Kendall, of Labour, held Leicester West with 44.6% of the vote and an 8,777 majority.\n\nMs Kendall, an MP since 2010, said: \"Across the country, people have rejected this failed, divided, self-serving, Tory government and instead chosen Keir Starmer’s transformed Labour Party.\"\n\nShe beat the Conservative Max Chauhan, who was second, and Reform’s Ian Hayes, who got 5,666 votes.\n\nConservative MP, Neil O'Brien, has retained his place in Parliament, beating Labour’s Hajira Piranie.\n\nHowever, his majority from 2019 has reduced from more than 17,000 to about 2,000 votes.\n\nDr Luke Evans held Hinckley and Bosworth for the Tories with 17,032 votes.\n\nMichael Mullaney, for the Liberal Democrats, came second with 11,624 votes and Peter Cheshire for Reform was third with 8,817.\n\nNext Conservative leader?\n\nConservative Alberto Costa also held his seat in South Leicestershire, but has seen his vote share drop by nearly 31% since 2019.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Leicester, Mr Costa has said he could run for Tory leadership.\n\n\"I've just been re-elected and I promise the people of South Leicestershire this, I will ensure that the Conservative Party reflects and goes forward in the right direction and if that means I stand for leadership, I will do so,\" he said.\n\nMr Jenrick is another possible contender, according to Tory colleague Ms Cutts.\n\nShe said: \"He's a very clever man, he's taken the Newark seat and looked after it extremely well.\n\n\"He's come out recently - I think we've seen the real Robert Jenrick stand up, he's felt that the policies we've been following are probably not Robert Jenrick's policies, and not Conservative policies.\""
