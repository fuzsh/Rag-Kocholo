Since February 2020, I have been Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Science, Research and Innovation within the BEIS Department, which is such an honour. My portfolio also includes Space, Maritime, Intellectual Property, Industrial Strategy Delivery and Technology.\n\nBeing elected to represent the area you call home is the privilege of a lifetime. Getting the opportunity to do it twice is indescribable, and I am humbled that the people of Derby North have, once again, put their trust in me to be their representative in London.\n\nDerby North is home to a wealth of people of all backgrounds, each person a thread in the tapestry that makes our community. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of them and aim to meet many more.\n\nDerby North needs an MP who acts on their concerns and I aim to do so with some good Derbyshire common sense!"
