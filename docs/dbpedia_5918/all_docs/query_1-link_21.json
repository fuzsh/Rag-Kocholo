        "text": "It was a pleasure to welcome Amanda to our school. Our Landau Forte MPs posed a series of challenging questions to Amanda in an event that was as rigorous as PMQs! Our MPs asked about the right to protest, the recent leadership changes within the Conservative party, crime levels in Derby and Amanda’s thoughts on MPs participating in reality TV shows. Amanda was then taken on a tour of LFCD by Rumaisa and Ahmed – thank you to all students involved in this successful visit. Amanda was able to see first hand what a happy, successful and thriving school LFCD is!"
