        "text": "Derby North is definitely a seat to watch at the 2019 General Election, if only because of the decision by the former sitting MP Chris Williamson to stand as an independent.\n\nHe lost the seat in 2015 by 41 votes and re-took in 2017 by 2,015 votes.\n\nIn total there will be six candidates for people to choose from with the return of former Conservative Derby North MP Amanda Solloway and Brexit Party candidate Alan Graves, who is also councillor for Alvaston on Derby City Council.\n\nIn the EU Referendum, 54.25% of the electorate voted to Leave. In the recent European elections, the Brexit Party won in Derby (including both North and South) with 18,075 votes, followed by Lib Dems second, labour third and Conservatives a lowly fourth.\n\nThe seat has been relative to others a marginal seat since 2001, as well as a swing seat, as its winner's majority has not exceeded 8.6% of the vote since the 15.9% majority won at that year's General Election.\n\nBetween 1983 and 2005, it was a bellwether seat - one which changes with the prevailing political control in the country as a whole.\n\nIt will be a tricky seat to predict, especially as the poll is likely to be widely split, particularly between Conservative and Brexit Party leave supporters and old allegiances to former Labour MP Chris Williamson.\n\nAdd in the Green and Liberal Democrat parties, who are both contesting the seat, and there could be a split in the remain vote.\n\nIt should be an interesting contest.\n\nHere, we round up details of all the Derby North candidates, plus key constituency info:\n\nWho are the Derby North candidates?\n\nAlan Graves - Brexit Party: Alan Graves is the Brexit Party group leader on Derby City Council. His experience on the council started back in 1995. He left Labour in 2009 to become an Independent and then joined UKIP. Earlier this year, all of the UKIP councillors on the city council defected to the Brexit Party. He is currently a ward councillor for the Brexit Party in Alvaston.\n\nHelen Hitchcock - Green: Helen Hitchcock is a teacher and classical musician and lives in the constituency. She has long been active in positive local organisations such as Trees for Derby, Local Welcome and Derby Concert Orchestra.\n\nShe said: \"To be selected as the Green Party candidate for Derby North means I can offer people another choice, to try and promote a different way of thinking about the economy, of focus on wellbeing rather than growth, to appreciate the esteem in which they hold the NHS and talk about how we would like to include social care in its remit.\"\n\nAmanda Solloway - Conservative : Former Derby North MP Mrs Solloway was born in Nottingham. She is an experienced management consultant specialising in behavioural development and previously worked in retail management and human resources. In 2017, she founded HeadHigh, an organisation which seeks to address the stigma surrounding mental health. Her priorities include education and work opportunities, protecting and enhancing the natural environment and strengthening the NHS.\n\nTony Tinley - Labour: Tony Tinley is Unite regional officer for the East Midlands. He started work at 17 as an apprentice at Rolls-Royce and recently helped secure a landmark agreement between the company and Unite that covered 1,700 managers in Derby and Hucknall. After being elected as a shop steward, he worked his way up to the positions of political officer and regional officer. He stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in May’s European elections.\n\nGreg Webb - Liberal Democrat: Greg Webb says that backing him will help to stop Brexit. On his Twitter profile, Mr Webb says he is \"campaigning against Brexit, Christian, software engineer, photographer and volunteer youth worker\". He said he is \"delighted to be the Liberal Democrat MP candidate for Derby North\" and added: \"We've got a great chance to demand better for Derby.\"\n\nChris Williamson - Independent: Former Derby North MP Chris Williamson was suspended from the Labour Party over remarks he made about the party's approach to anti-semitism. Unable to defend his seat for Labour because of the suspension, he decided to resign from the party and \"spend more time fighting for socialism\". He says he will campaign for \"social justice, internationalism and socialist values\". On his Twitter profile he states: \"Remember, I will be the ONLY pro-Corbyn candidate on the ballot paper in Derby North.\"\n\nWhat do I need to know about the Derby North parliamentary constituency?\n\nDate formed: 1950\n\nElectorate: Around 72,000\n\nWards: There are seven Derby City Council wards - Abbey, Chaddesden, Darley, Derwent, Littleover, Mackworth, and Mickleover.\n\nMany constituency boundaries changed for the 2010 general election. This seat changed quite significantly, which made the seat less of a Labour Party safe seat based on council results for electoral wards.\n\nProfile: The constituency covers a largely residential area immediately north of Derby city centre, including some of the city’s most affluent suburbs, as well as some of its council housing, though much of this is former council housing in private ownership. Unemployment is below the national average. Average incomes are above the national average.\n\nHistory: Derby North has been closely contested between the two largest parties since 1950, It was initially held consecutively by the Labour Party's Clifford Wilcock, Niall MacDermot and Phillip Whitehead.\n\nIn the 1979 election, it was covered by the BBC as the 41st of 41 seats that the Conservatives needed to win - in that year it stayed Labour (but the Conservatives won the election).\n\nThe 2015 win by Amanda Solloway for the Conservatives by a mere 41 votes, saw Derby North become the most marginal seat in England.\n\nWhat was the percentage of people who voted Leave in the 2016 EU Referendum?\n\nA total of 54.25% of voters chose Leave in 2016.\n\nWhat was the result for Derby North in the 2017 General Election?\n\nLucy Care – Liberal Democrats: 2,262\n\nBill Piper – UKIP: 1,181\n\nAmanda Solloway – Conservatives: 21,607\n\nChris Williamson – Labour: 23,622\n\nTotal: 48,672\n\nMajority: 2,015\n\nTurnout: 69.1%"
