        "text": "To improve care for people with mental health, Rehman has introduced two Bills in Parliament.\n\nWith one in four people in the UK suffering a mental illness at some point in their lives, and around two million more adults likely to face such an illness by 2030, Rehman believes more needs to be done to put mental health care on a more equal footing with physical health.\n\nRehman has authored a letter, now supported by 72 MPs, asking the Prime Minister and the Government to support these two Bills.\n\nHis “Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services)” Bill aims to improve access to specialist services for the tens of thousands of women affected by perinatal mental illness every year. The Bill would guarantee an appropriate level of provision for Mother and Baby Units in England, ensuring that 95% of patients do not have to travel more than 75 miles to reach expert care.\n\nRehman’s “Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability)” Bill, would require health care commissioners to take full account of mental health needs when making decisions on care. This would require those who commission health services to always consider how their services meet the needs of people with mental health problems.\n\nFull Text of Letter to the PM and the updated list of MPs supporting the Bills are below\n\nRt Hon David Cameron MP\n\nPrime Minister\n\n10 Downing Street\n\nLondon\n\nSW1A 2AA\n\nDear Prime Minister\n\nRE: Support for Mental Health Bills\n\nWe, the undersigned, ask that the Government supports two Private Members Bills, put forward by Rehman Chishti MP, which aim to improve access to mental health services. They are scheduled to receive their Second Reading on Friday 20th November 2015.\n\nYour leadership has been vital in ensuring that, for the first time, mental health was officially recognised by the NHS as having parity of esteem with physical health. However, there is still more to be done to make sure that this becomes a reality.\n\nThe Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) Bill would tackle the parity issue head on by challenge commissioners of health services to make an annual report to the Secretary of State setting out how they have met mental health needs. This Bill would ensure that commissioners of both mental and physical healthcare services must always consider how the services they commission meets the needs of people with mental illness and people with learning disabilities, and if not, explain why.\n\nThe Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Families Services) Bill aims to end one area of weakness in mental health provision which would have been unthinkable it if was for a physical condition. This Bill would make sure that every area provides sufficient specialist beds so mothers suffering from mental health problems can stay safely with their babies.\n\nBoth Bills are being supported by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Centre for Mental Health.\n\nWith the NHS England Mental Health taskforce soon to report, we believe that this would be an excellent opportunity to take a lead to make mental health a priority.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nRehman Chishti MP -
