        "text": "Dozens of electric scooters are to be made available for key workers travelling to and from work in Derby during a year-long trial starting this month.\n\nThe scheme, operating in both Derby and Nottingham, will offer a new, greener travel option to help mitigate congestion, improve air quality and provide affordable travel options.\n\nKey workers will be able to hire one of 50 e-scooters, at a discounted rate of £30 per month, for a minimum of a month, and up to one year.\n\nCouncillor Matthew Holmes, Derby City Council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for regeneration, planning and transportation, said: “I’m pleased that Derby has been selected to trial this government scheme, which means that e-scooters are a new alternative choice for green travel in our city.\n\n“There’s no doubt that they offer a cheap and clean way to travel around Derby, improving not just the air quality in our city, but also the user’s physical and mental health at a time when that is more important than ever.”\n\nAs part of the response to Covid-19, the Department for Transport (DfT) has made changes that allow e-scooters to be used on public roads, using the same road space as cyclists.\n\nHowever, these legislation changes only apply to DfT-approved schemes and not privately owned e-scooters.\n\nThe e-scooters in the Derby scheme, operated by Wind Mobility, will be fitted with technology that means they will not operate outside of certain boundaries, with the operator able to track the scooters to ensure proper use.\n\nMr Holmes said: “There are likely to be a few teething problems to work out, as you’d expect with the introduction of new transport modes.\n\n“We’ve listened and will continue to listen to any feedback as the trial progresses. Hearing the views and experiences of the users themselves, cyclists, other road users and pedestrians is going to be vital to the trial’s success.\n\n“E-scooters are certainly becoming a more popular choice for people, so it’ll be interesting to see whether they’re embraced and become as common as bicycles in Derby!”\n\nEric Wang, chief executive and co-founder of Wind Mobility, said: “Winning the tender to operate in Derby and Nottingham is a true honour.\n\n“Wind brings wealth of experience, with over 40 city launches across Europe, Middle East and Asia.\n\n“We have fine-tuned the recipe for a successful trial in the East Midlands.”\n\nSupporting the scheme, Amanda Solloway, MP for Derby North, said: “I am delighted that Derby has been chosen to trial e-scooters.\n\n“It’s a great step forward for the environment and brings with it many benefits such as lower congestion and cleaner air.\n\n“I really hope we can embrace them as a city as the trials begin this month and would encourage our key workers to sign up and give them a go.”"
