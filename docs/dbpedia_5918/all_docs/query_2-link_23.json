        "text": "THE winners of a competition to design a card for King Charles III to mark his coronation have been given a seal of approval from the Prime Minister.\n\nDerby North MP Amanda Solloway asked children across the constituency to design a card which will be sent to Buckingham Palace ahead of His Majesty’s Coronation.\n\nThe standard of entries was so high that Amanda chose two designs and gave Prime Minister Rishi Sunak the chance to look at them before sending them to the Palace.\n\nA card designed by six-year-old Charlie Smith from Mickleover Primary School, in Vicarage Road, was selected after impressing Amanda with his drawing of a crown, orb and sceptre complete with bunting.\n\nAnd a design by five-year-old William Harrison-Chen, a pupil at Derby Grammar School, was also chosen. His card featured a portrait of King Charles, with a castle and was completed with a green and yellow background to represent His Majesty’s love of nature.\n\nAmanda said: “We thoroughly enjoyed going through all the wonderful designs sent into us by creative Derby children – thank you to everyone who took part in the competition.\n\n“Having received hundreds of entries it was incredibly hard to choose just one winner, so in the end I chose two instead. Congratulations Charlie and William!”\n\n“Their designs will now feature on the card which will be sent to His Majesty on behalf of everyone in Derby North.”\n\nLynne Gerver, head teacher at Mickleover Primary School, said: “We are thrilled that Charlie’s card has been chosen to send to King Charles on his coronation.”\n\nAngela Wheat, from Derby Grammar School, said: “This is amazing news! William often lacks confidence in his artwork but when he was set this task, he thought so hard about his design and asked a lot of questions when we began researching about King Charles.\n\n“You could tell how thoughtful he was about this project from the way he explained why he chose and used the colours he did. This will be such a huge accomplishment for him and I could not be prouder.\""
