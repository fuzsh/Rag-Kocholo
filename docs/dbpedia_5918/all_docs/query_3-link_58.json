        "text": "Introduction\n\n1 - The Ministerial Code sets out in Chapter 7 the standards expected of ministers in the handling of their private interests. The overriding principle, as set out at paragraph 7.1 of the Code, is that ‘ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise’. At paragraph 7.2, the Code makes clear that ‘It is the personal responsibility of each minister to decide whether and what action is needed to avoid a conflict or the perception of a conflict, taking account of advice received from their Permanent Secretary and the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ interests.’\n\n2 - The Ministerial Code stipulates that, on appointment to each new office, ministers are required to complete a declaration of all interests that might be thought to give rise to a conflict. Ministers are also asked to complete a new declaration whenever there is a substantial change to their portfolio and are expected to inform their department of any substantive change in their circumstances during the intervening period.\n\n3 - The declarations that ministers provide are treated in confidence. This allows for the fullest possible disclosure even where matters may not necessarily be relevant. The declaration is reviewed by the permanent secretary, who brings to bear an in-depth understanding of the minister’s portfolio and responsibilities and the associated activity of the department. The permanent secretary provides advice on any action that should be taken; the declaration, together with that advice, is then shared with my secretariat.\n\n4 - The role of the Independent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests is to provide advice on the arrangement of a minister’s personal affairs so as to be able to meet the principle in paragraph 7.1 of the Ministerial Code. Paragraphs 7.6 to 7.8 of the code set out some of the steps that may be advised so that interests that are retained can be managed in a way which does not give rise to a conflict of interest. That may include, for example, a minister recusing themselves from decision-making on a particular issue.\n\n5 - The Ministerial Code requires that a statement covering relevant interests be published twice yearly. This statement takes the form of a list of Ministers’ interests. A role of the Independent Adviser is to advise on what it is necessary to publish within the list. The list is not a register of interests and does not therefore include every interest that a minister has declared in relation to themselves and their family members. To do so would represent an excessive degree of intrusion into the private affairs of ministers that would be unreasonable, particularly in respect of their family members. The list instead documents those interests, including of close family, which are, or may be perceived to be, directly relevant to a minister’s ministerial responsibilities. The list also provides details of charities and non-public organisations where a minister is a trustee or patron. Further information on the types of interest covered in the list is provided in the next section (page 4).\n\n6 - The List of Ministers’ Interests should be read alongside the parliamentary registers (House of Commons Register of Members’ Financial Interests and the House of Lords Register of Members) and any relevant information published by the Electoral Commission.\n\n7 - This list is the first List of Ministers’ Interests I have overseen. Scrutinising the declarations of interest and preparing the list for publication has been a priority for me since my appointment on 22 December 2022. It comes after a pause in the regular publishing cycle that followed the resignation of my predecessor, Lord Geidt, in June 2022. It should be noted that the process of managing the interests of ministers still continued in the absence of an Independent Adviser. The permanent secretary, as the policy expert on each department’s remit, led the process in their department and the Cabinet Office was also able to provide advice in line with precedent. It is my intention to restore routine, with appropriate rigour in the ministers’ interests process and to re-establish the twice yearly cycle.\n\n8 - This list records the relevant interests of all ministers forming part of the government, as at 26 March 2023 and accordingly includes ministers appointed during the period since the start of the current Prime Minister’s tenure on 25 October 2022, up to 26 March 2023. It does not include former ministers in post during this time. The Prime Minister carried out various changes to the composition of the government in February 2023 which led to a number of new appointments in February and March 2023. Ministers appointed after 26 March 2023 will be included in the next list of interests.\n\n9 - I have found that the majority of the instances in which I have been required to provide advice have related to:\n\nThe need for a blind trust where a minister holds a financial interest with significant value, particularly where there might appear to be a connection to their ministerial portfolio.\n\nThe ability of ministers to continue with non-executive directorships of private companies. This has been considered acceptable if the underlying business is clearly a small family enterprise and the minister plays no active part in its management, e.g., a farming partnership.\n\n10 - There are a number of departments with policy areas that have broad commercial relevance: the Office of the Prime Minister, HM Treasury, Department of Business and Trade, Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. In light of this, the entries for ministers in these departments in particular should be read alongside the parliamentary registers where details of additional financial interests can be found. Links to the registers are included in these sections for this purpose. As a general principle, all list entries should be read alongside the parliamentary registers of interests.\n\n11 - I am content that any actual, potential and perceived conflicts have been, or are in the process of being, resolved, but it is important that ministers and their permanent secretaries remain alert in the context of their respective portfolios if ministers’ interests change.\n\nSir Laurie Magnus CBE\n\nIndependent Adviser on Ministers’ Interests\n\nApril 2023\n\nGuide to the categories of interest\n\nMinisters are asked to declare their relevant interests to their permanent secretaries and the Independent Adviser in a number of categories. Permanent secretaries and the Independent Adviser advise on the management of any interests that may conflict, or appear to conflict, with specific ministerial portfolios. The Independent Adviser also considers which interests require publication in the List of Ministers’ Interests because they may be deemed relevant to a minister’s portfolio.\n\nThe List of Ministers’ Interests is not a register of interests and should be read alongside the House of Commons Register of Members’ Financial Interests and the House of Lords Register of Members’ Interests, which provide additional information on interests held by ministers.\n\n1 - Financial interests\n\nThe list includes financial interests held by a minister that are relevant, or may be perceived to be relevant, to their ministerial portfolio. It is not therefore a register of all financial interests.\n\nThe list indicates where financial interests are held in a blind trust or similar blind management arrangement. Blind trusts and blind management arrangements are longstanding mechanisms for protecting ministers in the handling of their interests. They ensure ministers are not involved in decisions on the management, acquisition or disposal of items in the arrangement and do not have live knowledge of the contents of such arrangements. The list also provides information on ministers’ involvement with trusts which are not blind, for example family trusts where a minister may be a trustee, beneficiary, non-beneficiary or any combination of these.\n\nThe list also includes information on pensions that are relevant to a minister’s portfolio.\n\n2 - Directorships and shareholdings\n\nDirectorships\n\nWhile ministers would not normally retain directorships while in office, in some specific circumstances the Independent Adviser may advise that it is acceptable for a directorship to be retained, for example in connection with the management of a residential property or small family enterprise, subject to specific undertakings to avoid any conflict. Recently appointed ministers sometimes need time to arrange their retirement from private company directorships and, in such cases, the relevant directorships are included in the list. All such positions are generally expected to be unpaid.\n\nShareholdings\n\nInformation on shareholdings should be read alongside the relevant parliamentary register. The registers maintained by the House of Commons and House of Lords include details of all shareholdings held by MPs and peers over certain thresholds.[footnote 1] The List of Ministers’ Interests does not duplicate this information and is not a register of all interests. However, where shareholdings are held by particular ministers that are below the parliamentary thresholds for disclosure, but are deemed to be relevant to their respective portfolios, these are included within the list.\n\n3 - Investment property\n\nThe list includes investment properties where relevant to the minister’s ministerial portfolio. It is not therefore a list of all investment properties.\n\n4 - Public appointments\n\nIn line with paragraph 7.11 of the Ministerial Code, most public appointments are relinquished on appointment to ministerial office. Where exceptionally it is proposed that such an appointment should be retained, for example, to allow for a replacement to be recruited, ministers are expected to seek the advice of their permanent secretary and the Independent Adviser.\n\nFor the purposes of the list, public appointments are those which are regulated public appointments, as found on the Public Appointments Order in Council.\n\n5 - Charities and non-public organisations\n\nThe list includes charities and non-public organisations where a minister holds a significant position such as patron or trustee, and includes those which are relevant to their ministerial portfolio.\n\n6 - Any other relevant interests\n\nThe list includes other interests which could have relevance to their specific ministerial responsibilities, for example a relevant business based in their constituency or membership of a Town Deal Board or relevant community groups.\n\n7 - Interests of spouse, partner or close family member\n\nUnder paragraph 7.3 of the Ministerial Code, ministers are expected to disclose to their permanent secretary the interests of their spouse or partner and close family which might be thought to give rise to an actual or perceived conflict. Where a spouse or partner’s interests are deemed to be potentially relevant to a minister’s portfolio, arrangements are put in place to manage this.\n\nAdditional care is taken in considering which interests held by ministers’ family members should be included in the list so as to avoid excessive and unreasonable intrusion into their lives. It is important to recognise the right of these individuals to a degree of privacy over their affairs and also to avoid compromising their ability to continue in gainful trade and/or employment. Accordingly, judgments are made about which interests are directly and significantly relevant and should therefore be included in the list. What counts as “close family” is determined on a case by case basis. Ministers cannot be expected to know the detail of the affairs of all those they are related to, but where they have close and ongoing contact ministers are expected to take reasonable steps to ensure they adhere to their responsibilities under Chapter 7 of the Ministerial Code.\n\n8 - Tax affairs and duty to comply with the law\n\nIn addition, ministers are asked to confirm that: their tax affairs are up to date and that the arrangement of their affairs is consistent with their overarching duty to comply with the law.\n\nPrime Minister’s Office\n\nThe Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP, Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service, and Minister for the Union (member of Cabinet)\n\n1.
