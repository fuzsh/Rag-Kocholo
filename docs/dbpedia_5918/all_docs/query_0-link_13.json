        "text": "CITY retailers say they have seen a significant rise in shoplifting over the last 12 months, with brute force and knives increasingly being used during thefts.\n\nThe growth in shoplifting was highlighted during a roundtable arranged by Derby North MP Amanda Solloway, which was attended by representatives from stores including One Stop, Sainsbury’s, Age UK and the Co-op.\n\nTo help tackle the issue, Amanda has pledged to create a communication channel for retailers to share information with each other and the Police, creating a stronger network to combat crime effectively and help prepare business owners.\n\nShe intends to create local Whatsapp groups for specific areas around her constituency such as Prince Charles Avenue in Mackworth, Nottingham Road in Chaddesden and The Parade in Mickleover, as well as a wider group for the city, so that retailers facing security challenges in real-time can stay in touch with each other.\n\nThe meeting, which was also attended by Police and Crime Commissioner Angelique Foster, heard from Julie Croft, a shift leader at One Stop, in Chaddesden, who explained that staff had faced knife-wielding thieves and threats.\n\nBronwyn Broodryk, from Sainsbury’s at Kingsway, said organised thefts were on the increase, with a recent incident on the premises leading to the discovery of £4,000 of stolen alcohol from around the city in one car.\n\nKatie Pugh from Age UK, which has 11 retail sites in Derbyshire run by volunteers, said there had been a perceptible increase in crime in its outlets.\n\nAmanda said: “As an MP, I am deeply concerned about the increase in shoplifting incidents within our communities, retail crime is neither petty nor victimless.\n\n“Shoplifting not only impacts the livelihoods of hardworking business owners but also contributes to higher prices for consumers and threatens the safety and security of our neighbourhoods.\n\n“It is essential that we work collaboratively and as a community to stand together against activities that threaten the safety and prosperity of our local areas.\n\n“WhatsApp groups for retailers provide a practical and efficient means for businesses to collaborate, share information, and work collectively to deter and address crime.\"\n\nIt is hoped that the messaging service will facilitate the reporting of various incidents, including shoplifting, theft, vandalism, and suspicious activities.\n\nMembers will have the opportunity to alert their peers about potential risks, share best practices for theft prevention and coordinate responses in emergencies.\n\nIt was felt that small independent retailers would benefit from the information collated by bigger retailers and police.\n\nRetailers interested in joining and helping to create the WhatsApp groups are encouraged to contact Amanda Solloway’s office for more information and registration details.\n\nAmanda thanked all the retailers who participated in the roundtable and looks forward to the positive impact the initiative will have on community safety.\n\nShe added: “Shoplifting is not just a crime against businesses, but a theft from the community's trust and prosperity.\n\n“I hope we can all work together to improve our neighbourhoods and safeguard the livelihoods of our local businesses.”\n\nAngelique said: “As Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner, I have worked hard over the last 3 years to help increase support for our business and shop owners across Derbyshire and Derby City to cut crime and tackle persistent offenders.\n\nI have increased the number of police officers, strengthened our neighbourhood policing, and invested in extra police patrols. We are starting to see increased visibility and our police force is already working with businesses to focus on prolific offenders."
