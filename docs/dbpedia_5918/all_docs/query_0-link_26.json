The recovery plans, including funding to help businesses expand, create more jobs and a more vibrant city centre with more homes are very impressive. And the transformation of the Market Place into an alfresco dining area provides a great place for people to socialise safely and real support for the local hospitality businesses. We are keen to work with the City Council as their ambitious plans develop and are already supporting the regeneration plans with £36.7m investment – on top of providing over £62.8m to support communities in Derby during the pandemic and help businesses in the area reopen safely."
