        "text": "“There is no place for Chris Williamson in my Labour party. I think out of all the issues around antisemitism in the party he has been the biggest surprise and has caused me the most heartache,” says Steve Lapsley, a lifelong Labour supporter, who adds that he will never be able to forgive the Derby North MP for the alleged damage he has done to the party.\n\nAs pressure mounted on Jeremy Corbyn to cut loose one of his closest allies, party supporters in Williamson’s constituency described a man who was previously “a very good friend to the Jewish community”, but who had deliberately become embroiled in the antisemitism controversy in a bid to reinvent himself as a Corbyn loyalist.\n\nLapsley, a Jewish Labour Movement member, said Williamson had been a good friend and was not someone who was “particularly interested in the Middle East” or someone that had previously commented on issues of antisemitism.\n\nIn fact while he was leader of Derby city council Williamson was instrumental in setting up Holocaust Memorial Day events in the city, and he also rescinded the medieval proscription of Jews living in Derby.\n\nHowever in 2015 things began to shift. Lapsley, who is on the national executive committee of Open Labour and has lived in Derby for 30 years, said there was a distinct change in Williamson’s behaviour after he lost his seat to Amanda Solloway of the Conservative party by 41 votes. Following his defeat Corbyn described Williamson as a “very great friend” saying his defeat was “the worst result of the night”.\n\n“I had some interaction with him on social media and I was worried with the people he was supporting and some of the things he was saying. He agreed to see me but he completely shut me down and refused to listen to anything I had to say. I wanted to show him some examples I had got of antisemitism I had seen in Labour party forums and he refused to look at. Didn’t want to have anything to do with it,” he said.\n\nLapsley said Williamson, a former bricklayer and social worker who won the seat back from the Tories in 2017 with a majority of 2,000, was no longer the “fairly pragmatic guy” he remembered, accusing him of “appalling Jew-baiting”.\n\nIn February Williamson faced complaints about having booked a room in parliament to screen a controversial film about Jackie Walker, an activist suspended from the party.\n\nLapsley said: “He is someone who is a loyalist. He was pretty loyal to Tony Blair but his politics changed. He is now very much a do-or-die Jeremy Corbyn loyalist and he sees any criticism of Jeremy Corbyn as an attack on him which isn’t necessarily the case.”\n\nAt Jewish Labour Movement meetings Williamson is the main topic of conversation due to “deliberately seeking notoriety” but Lapsley fears it will eventually lose Labour the Derby North constituency.\n\n“He has had to invent this new Chris Williamson to keep his seat. Reinvent himself as this ultra Corbyn loyalist but he doesn’t do Corbyn any favours and I don’t think he can win in Derby again because of the damage he has done,” he adds.\n\nMeanwhile, Eve Sacker, a former teacher, said she was forced to leave the Labour party due to Williamson’s reluctance to acknowledge and tackle the issue of antisemitism. Sacker revealed that she contributed to a dossier presented to the Labour party containing evidence of Williamson’s alleged denial of antisemitism. The dossier was handed to the party shortly after Williamson’s suspension.\n\nSacker, who is now the deputy manager at the multicultural education charity Open Centre in the city, said she was blocked by Williamson after she raised concerns about an article he shared after the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings in October last year.\n\nShe said: “When I told him on Twitter how upset I was at his response in the wake of such a tragedy, he just blocked me.”\n\nThe 2011 census recorded just 110 Jews in Derby city, while in the county of Derbyshire there were approximately 370 Jewish people.\n\nSacker believes with them being such a tiny minority they are all the more vulnerable and said she and her children had repeatedly been subject to antisemitic abuse.\n\nShe said: “I have written to [Williamson] many times asking him to support our community but he just ignores me. I have had people make Nazi salutes at me, I’ve had children who have said to me the Holocaust happened because Jews owned everything. One of my daughters had to move school because another child told her she belonged in a concentration camp. This is the kind of abuse we suffer but he does not want to listen to us, which is alarming for a politician.”\n\nSacker said she voted for Williamson when she first moved to Derby, but would never do so again, as she believes he is baiting the Jewish community.\n\n“He knows that appearing with [Jackie] Walker will upset us. He is not making any effort to engage with us both locally and nationally. We are not asking him to stop advocating for Palestinians but we would like him to listen to what we have got to say. He’s a bit like a leaf blowing on the wind. He just doesn’t listen,” she said.\n\nMike Carr, a former mayor of Derby, said: “He just doesn’t listen to people – he is a great orator – but so forceful and aggressive and constantly rubs people up the wrong way. He will definitely lose the seat if he carries on like this. It’s simple really – stop saying silly things.”"
