        "text": "Good Monday morning. This is Dan Bloom.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nFRESHERS’ WEEK: Steel yourselves for the mother of all pass office queues — hundreds of newly-minted MPs will flood into Westminster today for a gleeful victory lap. Parliament doesn’t actually sit until Tuesday afternoon but there will be a real first-week-of-uni vibe as the vast 2024 intake of MPs start arriving in London to gawp at their palatial new digs. All along Whitehall, new Labour SpAds will be negotiating their contracts while the new government basks in honeymoon press coverage with a flurry of press releases. Meanwhile, a Tory operation that would normally give it both barrels sits quietly in the corner, licking its wounds.\n\nSay 172 majorityyy! Prime Minister Keir Starmer will host Labour MPs this afternoon for their first PLP meeting in central London — the location is only being revealed to them today. Expect the inevitable photo of the colossal lineup to get plenty of coverage at the top of tonight’s news bulletins. No word yet on whether there’ll be a women-only pic like 1997.\n\nAnything they can do … Lib Dem Leader Ed Davey is also due to meet his 71 fellow MPs for the first time (and call for an “emergency health and care budget”) ahead of a photocall on Tuesday … Plaid Cymru’s four MPs (up from two) have a 1.30 p.m. photo … And don’t forget the independents. Jeremy Corbyn has already given the new broom the brush-off in today’s i.\n\nFIRST LECTURE: Today’s actual newsmaking event could be Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ 10.30 a.m. debut speech and press Q&A in the Treasury, in which she will confirm Labour is reinstating compulsory house-building targets for councils (as the manifesto already pledged to do “immediately”). It gets splashes in the Telegraph, Mail and Times. Plans also include the existing pledge to allow some building on the green belt.\n\n**A message from Airbus: Congratulations to all of the newly elected MPs. As a strategic partner to the UK in aerospace, space, defence and security, Airbus is proud to sponsor this week of London Playbook as Parliament returns for the first time since the election.**\n\nExpect the questions … to be dominated by hacks trying to nail down what some of the various tricky decisions both Starmer and Reeves have been talking about will actually involve. E.g. on tax.\n\nTime’s ticking: Reeves could also be asked when she’ll give the Office for Budget Responsibility notice of her first budget. The OBR normally expect 10 weeks’ notice — which from today would already take us to September 16.\n\nFIRST TUTORIAL: Hacks have the first No. 10 Lobby briefing of the new regime at 11.30 a.m., where the PM’s civil service spokesperson regenerates, Doctor Who-style, into the voice of a Labour government.\n\nGAP YEAH: Starmer’s devo tour of the four nations meanwhile continues today. The new PM met the Northern Irish police last night (just like old times) and is due to meet Sinn Féin First Minister Michelle O’Neill, DUP deputy Emma Little-Pengelly and the UUP, Alliance and SDLP at Stormont this morning. Then it’s another grip-’n’-grin with scandal-hit Welsh First Minister Vaughan Gething in Cardiff. There should be one pool clip after each meeting.\n\nCAREERS FAIR: Behind the rapturous Labour backers’ applause the horse-trading over jobs is well underway — and who ends up where will shape the next five years as much as any speech or policy, often more.\n\nSCOOP — THANK BEW FOR YOUR SERVICE: No. 10 foreign policy adviser John Bew will not be serving under Keir Starmer, my Playbook colleague Stefan Boscia reports. He hears that Bew, while rated by Starmer’s team, was considered too close to the Conservative Party legacy after working for three previous PMs.\n\nAnd that means … a “furious battle behind the scenes” over who gets to be Bew’s successor, along with other high-profile posts like the still-unfilled ambassador to Washington, one well-connected figure tells your author. Watch this space very carefully.\n\nIn other job news: Starmer’s election chief Morgan McSweeney will be “head of political strategy” in No. 10, the Guardian reports. Its story has loads of detail, including that former Director of External Relations Vidhya Alakeson will get a beefed-up role as political director … attack unit chief Paul Ovenden will be director of political strategy … policy director Stuart Ingham will head the policy unit but separate “mission delivery boards” will do some of the work … toppled MP Jonathan Ashworth could get a consolation job … and strategy director Deborah Mattinson is “thought to be heading for the Lords.”\n\nPress gang: The No. 10 political press team is now in place — Matthew Doyle as director of comms, Steph Driver as deputy and Sophie Nazemi as press secretary.\n\nAnd one more: Matt Pound — one of the “two Matts” involved in Starmer’s ruthless party reforms and selections — will be Reeves’ political secretary, as first reported by Gabriel Pogrund of the Sunday Times.\n\nPerfect timing: My colleague Esther Webber has a fun rundown of the 12 most powerful players in Starmer’s new government — as well as previewing potential areas of tension at the top. Doyle, Reeves, Angela Rayner, McSweeney, Sue Gray, Pat McFadden, Torsten Bell, Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson all make the cut.\n\nCentral casting: A Labour spokesperson, meanwhile, tells Playbook the party will launch a website at noon (link will be here) to take applications for up to 1,000 new parliamentary staff. The central party will then “sift and recommend” a readymade pool of Starmtroopers that MPs can choose from. Officials insist this is to help and won’t stop MPs recruiting whoever they want, even if applicants haven’t gone through this process. One to watch.\n\nOh, and the people who technically run the government: A load more ministerial appointments are expected today after none materialized on Sunday. About 34 out of more than 100 jobs are filled so far if you count Development Minister Anneliese Dodds (who was revealed by her nameplate).\n\nPOLICY BLAZE: In the meantime, No. 10 aides will scarcely believe their eyes that the front pages of the Mail, Telegraph, Times, i, Mirror, Guardian and Express all focus on actual government policy — albeit not all supportive, obvs (the Express leads on its own 10-demand manifesto). Not to mention the Sun, which came out for Labour last week and was duly invited along with Defence Secretary John Healey on his first post-election trip to Ukraine. Healey said he wants the Tory government’s existing aid package to happen “in the next 100 days” and pledged another package including 90 Brimstone missiles, 10 artillery guns and 61 bulldozers. List here.\n\nLots of fodder: Healey being rushed to a bomb shelter mid-meeting with his counterpart Rustem Umerov was a gift to pol ed Harry Cole’s copy. “Only a lock of hair and a slightly damp brow on the head of the usually dapper British ambassador was amiss,” it notes.\n\nBut but but … Cole also reports Starmer will axe the standalone post of veterans’ minister in the cabinet.\n\nRUH-ROH: New Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has been told the government has to make a decision this week to stop prisons hitting full capacity on August 1 — and the preferred solution is to release some prisoners just 40 percent of the way through their sentence, the Times’ Matt Dathan and Mirror’s John Stevens report. A tricky one for Labour’s attempts to project a tough-on-law-and-order image — especially given previous PM Rishi Sunak is reported to have blocked something similar.\n\nHEALTH CHECK: The new government has a flurry of announcements to look as busy as possible. Health Secretary Wes Streeting will have his first meeting with the British Dental Association and talk about why the NHS is “broken” with NHS England officials today. But the bigger focus is on his first face-to-face talks with the BMA on Tuesday over striking junior doctors’ pay. BMA rep Philip Banfield told Times Radio he was ready to have a deal sorted within the week — yet an official tells Playbook Tuesday’s talks are introductory, not full negotiations. Hmm.\n\nTEACHER’S PET PROJECT: Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson joins the press release flurry too, with the DfE saying she will meet unions and host a reception in the coming days. Existing government ad campaigns will also be “expanded” as part of the pledge to recruit 6,500 teachers over a five-year parliament. The BBC writes it up.\n\nSHORT NOTICE PERIOD: The Home Office also said last night that “rapid recruitment” for Labour’s “border security commander” will start today. The promise of “early legislation” with “counter-terror style powers” gets a big write-up in the Mail.\n\nWE <3 EU! But the area the Tories would be shouting about loudest — if they were on the pitch — is the new government’s overtures towards the EU. After Starmer said work has “already begun” ahead of reworking the post-Brexit trade deal, the Foreign Secretary told the Guardian he wants to go “broader than just defence” in a U.K.-EU security pact to (potentially) cybersecurity, migration and climate. Lammy, who’s back from a trip to Germany, Poland and Sweden, also plans to attend the EU’s foreign affairs council.\n\nRock, meet hard place: Naturally, the Mail has given Starmer’s first Cabinet meeting the classic “numbered photo” treatment to explain how every single member opposed leaving the EU … while the i’s Arj Singh and the Times’ Bruno Waterfield and Oliver Wright have decent pieces explaining all the ways the EU won’t just roll over, either.\n\nIN THE NATIONS: The government will push for “job guarantees” as part of any deal over Tata Steel’s plant in Port Talbot, reports the Times’ Jessica Newman. Likewise, Starmer said “preserving” jobs at Scotland’s Grangemouth oil refinery was a priority.\n\nJAMMY NEW GIG OF THE WEEK: Tech Secretary Peter Kyle got to go to Silverstone.\n\nCLOSER TO HOME: Starmer could move into the Downing Street flat (with JoJo the cat) from next weekend — but first has to get through NATO’s 75th anniversary in Washington from Tuesday. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to attend (as confirmed by the White House), which would suggest Starmer will get his first meeting with the Ukrainian president since becoming PM.\n\nLAST NIGHT IN FRANCE\n\nHOLD MY COGNAC, AGAIN: Our election may have obeyed the polls (well, ish) but France just lives for drama. Its parliamentary election delivered a proper upset one week after Marine Le Pen’s right-wing National Rally (RN) came out top in the first round. Final results overnight confirm the left-wing New Popular Front alliance won the most seats instead — with President Emmanuel Macron’s Ensemble coalition second and RN third. Check out this split-screen view of the two camps reacting to the exit poll … and the glee fading in real time from these young RN chaps’ faces here.\n\nHung parliament: The New Popular Front won 188 out of 577 seats in the National Assembly … Macron’s Ensemble 161 … and RN 142, according to my colleagues in Paris.\n\nSo what now? Err … more turmoil. Gabriel Attal, the 35-year-old French prime minister, of Ensemble, said he will offer his resignation this morning after only six months in the job. Radical-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon said a new PM should be appointed from his triumphant New Popular Front, and rejected the prospect of a coalition with the presidential camp … even though the left is several dozen seats short of an absolute majority.\n\nAnd meanwhile: The far right still managed to increase its vote share.\n\nHow is this going to work? This government is starting how it means to go on — messily. My colleague Clea Caulcutt has written the top five things you need to know about the election, including why governing France now will be hellish.\n\nPLANET TORY\n\nARISE, SHADOW CHANCELLOR HUNT: Playbook hears Tory leader Rishi Sunak is working on appointing an interim shadow cabinet in the coming days — possibly as soon as today — after Thursday night left his team full of holes, including Grant Shapps (Defence), Gillian Keegan (Education), Penny Mordaunt (Commons Leader) and many more. With little reason to unleash big surprises, will former big-hitters like James Cleverly and Jeremy Hunt end up having to shadow their old jobs?\n\nAs for the leadership contest: That debate about going short or long is still very active. Sunak himself is being lobbied but trying not to back one view. The party board will meet today to start drawing up the rules, reports the Guardian’s Jessica Elgot, who says Sunak has been calling defeated Tory MPs one by one. One Tory official tells your author: “At the moment, there’s no parliamentary party. I think the mood will become a lot clearer on Tuesday.”\n\nArmageddon out: According to the i team, Sunak has told friends he doesn’t think it’s feasible for him to remain leader beyond summer — opening up the prospect of a caretaker if it all runs too long.\n\nHow long is too long? A second Tory official tells Playbook the idea of a year(!)-long contest has even been knocked about by some. That seems fanciful. The first official says there’s even concern of it repeating the mistakes of Labour’s four-month contest in 2010 — which “took their eye off the political ball [while] George Osborne and David Cameron ruthlessly framed the legacy of the Blair-Brown government.”\n\nLAST MEN STANDING: Two people tell Playbook the process to choose a new chair and exec of the backbench 1922 Committee will be overseen by MPs Bob Blackman and Geoffrey Clifton-Brown — the only two out of 18 (!) officials leading the ’22 who are still here. Er, even though both of them told the Sunday Telegraph they want to run for chair themselves. The aim is to have a new chair in place by the King’s Speech on July 17.\n\nMEANWHILE IN RUNNERS AND RIDERS: Leadership hopeful Suella Braverman is slated to speak at 7 p.m. U.K. time at the National Conservatism conference in Washington. Other right-wingers on the platform include former Trump aide Steve Bannon. Definitely worth watching closely for the future of the Conservative Party, and whether it involves a big swing to the right.\n\nBut but but … Braverman’s presence causes more drama than a Twitter chat between ex-Tory MPs Marcus Fysh and Nicholas Soames, with mutterings in the Guardian and Times that her campaign is on the floor. The Telegraph reports “New Conservative” Danny Kruger is backing Robert Jenrick instead.\n\nThe greatest gift: Playbook hears center-right Tory Tom Tugendhat is holding his belated birthday party for friends and supporters in Westminster tonight. A great opportunity for him to conspicuously not rule out a run, and tell them he’s still “reflecting on the result.”\n\nCOMING UP SHORT: As a consolation prize the Tories are due £5 million-ish a year in “Short money” to opposition parties, Playbook reckons — while the Lib Dems roll like Scrooge McDuck in £2.3 million. But it’s sour times for Reform UK and the Greens, both of which will be spanked by a cap on parties that have five or fewer MPs. The Greens have four MPs and Reform has … exactly five.\n\nMaking scams for Nigel? Rules changed in 2016 to cap smaller parties’ Short money at (now) £376,000 regardless of their vote share. That takes Reform’s and the Greens’ cash down from what would’ve been more than £1 million and £500,000 respectively. “They stitched the rules up after [Douglas] Carswell” won for UKIP in 2014, a Reform official fumes to Playbook. The Times’ Oliver Wright is told similar.\n\nIn Reform news: The party’s Ben Habib told Talk’s Peter Cardwell on Sunday that new North Antrim MP Jim Allister, of TUV, will meet Farage on Tuesday to discuss if he will take the Reform whip.\n\nBONFIRE OF THE CONTACTS: Meanwhile, Playbook’s number-crunching over the weekend confirmed that 175 incumbent Tory MPs failed to get reelected on Thursday — more than any of a previous defeated government, according to politics prof Rob Ford. It really is worth us repeating the updated list for the sheer number of big names out the door to sink in.

The number of new MPs — 329 — is so huge that if they were a political party, they’d run the government. After they’ve subscribed to Playbook (natch), they’ll soon be bombarded with coffee invites, lobbying and casework. But first …\n\nJoin the queue: Inductions start the moment they walk through the doors of Westminster Hall, where parliamentary staff will be lined up “like a taxi rank” to be buddied up with MPs, a Commons staff member tells Playbook’s Bethany Dawson. They’ll then be taken around the building “almost like a freshers’ fair” to see stalls from IPSA, security, and HR. These sessions started on Friday for the keenest new members and continue through the week.\n\nDay two: Tuesday is for the Chamber induction, where the newbies learn about debates, the structure of the day and rules (nod or bow when entering the chamber, and don’t call anyone by their name). Sounds scary, but mistakes pop up for the “first few years,” so … it happens. For now, there’s little actual business going on in Westminster. It won’t last long.\n\nNOT KEEPING 1.5 ALIVE: Global temperatures have been 1.5C higher than the pre-industrial average for 12 months in a row, reports the Guardian.\n\nSW1 EVENTS: More in Common and UCL host an online election post-mortem from 11 a.m. … before MIC’s Luke Tryl hops on to another briefing on the election and new government by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit from noon (stream here).\n\nREPORTS OUT TODAY: The Institute for Government wants Chancellor Rachel Reeves to make big waves and “redesign economic policy-making structures” in her first days in the job.\n\nBEYOND THE M25\n\nYIKES: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Sunday that the presence of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea at this week’s NATO summit demonstrates the world is getting more complex. “As the Japanese prime minister said: What happens in Ukraine today can happen in Asia tomorrow,” Stoltenberg told CBS.\n\nGAZA LATEST: A senior Hamas official, Ihab Al-Ghussein, was among four people killed in an Israeli air strike at a Gaza City school next to a church, the BBC reports.\n\nTICK, TOCK: Several more senior House Democrats called on President Joe Biden to abandon his reelection bid during a private call lasting nearly two hours on Sunday afternoon, several people participating told my colleagues across the pond.\n\nStrong message here: Axios correspondent Alex Thompson got his hands on an event template used to brief President Biden, and found two of the document’s five pages are separate pictures of the walk to his podium. Gotta get the basics right.\n\n**A message from Airbus: As the UK’s largest aerospace company, a world leader in cyber security, a major supplier of helicopters, as well as the biggest supplier of large military aircraft to the RAF through the A400M Atlas and the A330 MRTT Voyager, Airbus is a strategic partner to the UK.

Even the Downing Street switchboard message has changed to reflect the whole “call me Keir” thing. “I’m sorry the prime minister cannot take your call personally.

The moment the clock struck 10 p.m. on Thursday, a sign was put up counting down the days until the next general election, an insider told Playbook’s Bethany Dawson. It now reads 1,465 days.\n\nWARM WORDS: Green Leader and new Bristol Central MP Carla Denyer had a cordial exchange on Twitter with ousted Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire.
