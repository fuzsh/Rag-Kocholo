The new department was announced as part of a mini reshuffle by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and will be under Grant Schapps, who previously was Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\n\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, has been tasked with securing the country's long-term energy supply, bringing down bills and halving inflation.\n\nA Government statement said: \"This year, the department will focus on easing the cost of living and delivering financial security by bringing down energy bills and keeping them down - better insulating consumers from external impacts. Longer term objectives include ensuring properly functioning energy markets, coordinating net zero objectives across government and bringing external delivery expertise to bear on its portfolio of major projects.\"\n\nREAD MORE Live updates as Princess of Wales arrives at Derby for surprise royal visit\n\nMs Solloway said she was delighted to be asked to serve and said: \"I am looking forward to getting on with the task of securing our long-term energy supply, bringing down bills and halving inflation - committing to delivering on this Government’s five priorities. These changes will focus on the issues that will build a better future for our children and grandchildren.\"\n\nShe will retain her role as a Government Whip (Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury). Ms Solloway first represented Derby North from 2015 to 2017 and then was elected again in 2019. On February 14, 2020, she was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Science, Research and Innovation at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy during the first cabinet reshuffle of the second Boris Johnson ministry.\n\nOn September 17, 2021, she was appointed a lord commissioner of the Treasury and she served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Equalities and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Safeguarding from July to September 2022.\n\nIn a Government department, the Secretary of Sate and Minister of State roles, respectively, are immediately above the under secretary position.\n\nWe send out the biggest stories in an email every day.
