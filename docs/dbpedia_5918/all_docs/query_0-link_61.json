        "text": "BUDDING netball stars, train drivers and business leaders – plus a real-life pirate – have all shown their support as Derby bids to become the new home of the Great British Railways.\n\nDerby is on a shortlist of six cities who are hoping to be chosen as the national headquarters. Great British Railways will be the new, single public body responsible for running and transforming Britain’s railways.\n\nThe city already has the backing of Local Authorities across the East Midlands and has received support from Derbyshire, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, Leicester and Leicestershire, alongside 21 MPs from across the region – including Pauline Latham and Amanda Solloway, who visited Derby County’s Pride Park Stadium for their opening League One fixture of the season, to drum up support for the campaign.\n\nAnd it seems that there is support in the county, too, with Jan Manfredi of Chesterfield-based award-winning ice-cream company Smith’s Creamland Ices and voluntary engine driver Debbie Jackson, who drives popular steam train ‘Little David’ through Matlock’s Hall Leys Park, giving the bid their backing.\n\nEven Captain Jack Sparrow, who was visiting Matlock Bath recently, has voted for Derby to be the next home of the Great British Railways. He said: “Arrghh, Derby gets my vote every time.”\n\nChesterfield MP, Toby Perkins, believes that Derby is “the perfect place as the home of railways” and has written a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.\n\nHe said: “Derby’s geographic location and transport links are perfectly situated at the heart of the country’s rail network and would provide the ideal setting for linking together the north and south of Britain.\n\n“Locating the new HQ in Derby would be very beneficial for the Great British Railways and would bring in much-needed investment and skilled jobs to the city, which would benefit the whole of Derbyshire and the East Midlands region.”\n\nBut more votes are needed before the August 15 deadline and campaigners will be asking shoppers in the Derbion to back the bid this week (Tuesday, August 9) whilst other supporters have visited tourist hotspots in the county.\n\nHusband and wife Adam and Natalie Bamford, of Derby-based personalised corporate gifting company Colleague Box, are backing the bid. Adam said: “Derby is the birthplace of the industrial revolution and a city of innovation and home to leading global companies such as Alstom, Toyota, Rolls-Royce and many more.”\n\nNatalie added: “It’s also a city with a big heart, supportive community and is brimming with talent. Its location makes it the perfect choice to be the home of the Great British Railways and the project would diversify and strengthen the local economy.”\n\nLeading public relations company Penguin PR, who have offices in Derby and Chesterfield, are also supporting the bid. Director Simon Burch said: “Anyone who lives in Derby knows someone who works or used to work on the railways and there are reminders of our railway heritage everywhere, so the city has got rail tracks running through its veins.\n\n“But as a local business owner and dad to two children, I realise how the region’s future relies on attracting projects of this calibre. Derby has been living in the shadows for too long when it comes to national recognition and attracting Government investment. I can’t think of a project that the city is more suited for, nor deserves as much.\n\n“That’s why we’re supporting the bid and have placed our votes for Derby.”\n\nBeverley Wakefield, of city-based Vibrant Accountancy, says that it would be a fantastic coup for the local economy.\n\nShe said: “We are very lucky to be situated in the heart of the country and so our network links are strong. Derby and Derbyshire has a great history with the rail industry and the city being home to the Great British Railways would be a fantastic boost for jobs in the region, and the local economy.”\n\nMeanwhile, keen netball players Abi Smith (10) and her friend, 11-year-old Grace Ganly said that they love the fact that Derby is central to all UK destinations – and how exciting taking a train to a different city is.\n\n“I travelled on the train from Derby to London at Christmas time, with my mum,” said Grace, “and it was really exciting. It didn’t take long at all, and I enjoyed watching the scenery go whizzing by.”\n\nYou can vote for Derby to be the location for the Great British Railways by visiting www.derbygbr.co.uk"
