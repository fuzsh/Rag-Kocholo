        "text": "Chesterfield’s iconic Winding Wheel theatre is becoming Derbyshire’s latest COVID-19 vaccination site today, continuing the rapid rollout of the vaccination programme across the county.\n\nThe site will begin vaccinations on Thursday morning, using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and it will be followed closely by a second Chesterfield vaccination site at Wheatbridge Surgery on Saturday.\n\nThe Chesterfield Borough Council-owned Winding Wheel becomes the tenth primary care vaccination site serving Derbyshire. It is the first of a new wave of openings, with six other sites also opening in the coming days.\n\nThe Winding Wheel is a Grade II listed building, built in 1923, and was previously the Picture House Cinema. It normally hosts a popular programme of arts and entertainments, but has been converted into a vaccination site through the hard work of teams from several organisations working together.\n\nThe Winding Wheel will initially only carry out vaccinations for healthcare workers, while patient vaccinations are carried out at the nearby Wheatbridge Surgery, ensuring Chesterfield is well provided. Some Chesterfield patients may also be offered appointments at Stubley Medical Practice in Dronfield, if that is more convenient for them.\n\nThis start of vaccinations at the Winding Wheel site marks the start of a new wave of openings, including the county’s most southerly vaccination site so far, in Swadlincote. The full list of this wave of openings is:\n\nWinding Wheel Theatre, Chesterfield\n\nWheatbridge Surgery, Chesterfield\n\nLittlewick Medical Centre\n\nSprings Health Centre, Clowne\n\nBuxton Medical Practice\n\nShirebrook Sports Sports Hall\n\nOaklands Village Commmunity Centre, Swadlincote\n\nVaccinations at the Winding Wheel are being carried out by Chesterfield & Dronfield Primary Care Network (PCN), representing 12 GP practices. Vaccinations are all by appointment only.\n\nPeople should not contact their GP about a vaccination unless asked to do so, and should not attend any vaccination site without an appointment.\n\nDerby & Derbyshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is managing the rollout of the vaccine across the county, and CCG medical director Dr Steve Lloyd said the opening of the Winding Wheel was another big step forward.\n\nThe Winding Wheel is such a treasured and historic part of Chesterfield and I’m delighted that it is playing an important in this major vaccination programme.\n\nCarrying out vaccinations at the Winding Wheel means we can provide this vital vaccine to the people of Chesterfield and its surrounding areas in a location well known to most people.\n\nTeams from the PCN, Chesterfield Council and Derbyshire Community Healthcare Services and the CCG have all worked incredibly hard to get this vaccination site up and running, and I’m really proud of their efforts.\n\nThe contrast with the modern surrounds of Derby Arena, which opened just last week, demonstrates how flexible, thorough and determined our teams are to identify and prepare the most appropriate venues to reach as many patients as possible.\n\nI’m also particularly pleased that we are beginning vaccinations in Swadlincote, which is our most southerly site yet and provides a vaccination site for communities of South Derbyshire.”\n\nCouncillor Tricia Gilby, Leader of Chesterfield Borough Council, said: “We’re delighted that the Covid-19 vaccination programme is being rolled out in Chesterfield. The use of The Winding Wheel Theatre, which the council owns and operates, as a local vaccination site is a huge step forward in our fight against the virus.\n\n“We’ve been working closely with NHS Derby and Derbyshire Clinical Commissioning Group and other partners to support the roll out and ensure that The Winding Wheel Theatre is ready to receive health care workers for their vaccinations. At this time, Chesterfield residents will be invited to have their vaccination at another local venue, and I urge as many people as possible to come forward and get vaccinated.\n\n“Although this is a huge step forward, we must all make sure we continue to follow the Government guidelines and protect our most vulnerable.”\n\nVaccinations will be rolled out to more sites over the coming days and weeks, as the vaccination programme continues to build momentum.\n\nThe first vaccinations in Derbyshire took place at Chesterfield Royal Hospital and Royal Derby Hospital on December 8th, followed by the county’s first vaccinations at a primary care site on December 18th at Stubley Medical Centre.\n\nDespite the return to lockdown, Chesterfield businesses are now looking ahead to a spring recovery following the roll out of the Oxford vaccine.\n\nWhether your focus is survival or growth, there is plenty you can be doing to prepare for the future. Every decision you make now could impact your business’ ability to thrive post pandemic.\n\nBut you’re not alone in your preparations. Chesterfield businesses are keen to collaborate and have shared their stories to inspire further success across the town.\n\nAre you working closely with local organisations?\n\nOssies’s Fresh Ginger was grateful of complimentary support from Chesterfield Borough Council’s business advisor, Adrian Williamson. Owner, Ossie Bash Taqi said: “As a fledgling enterprise we needed advice and guidance in developing the business particularly in COVID times. Adrian has been invaluable in advising on procedural measures and in setting both long and short term targets and guiding us in the development of a business plan – all extremely useful to a relaunching business.”\n\n“Adrian provided us with contacts and links to a variety of appropriate organisations which we will be able to use for continued support and specialist guidance such as the Food and Drink Forum and Feast 2, as well as giving us options on potential funding streams as the business is unexpectedly expanding.”\n\nSDE Group has saved money by trading locally with Mad Designs Ltd. Charlotte Watson, 3D Designer at SDE Group said: “They have assisted in huge cost savings in producing good quality loading signs for our clients. We received advice in the most cost efficient and best quality way in producing our signs to provide 100% customer satisfaction to all our clients – therefore increasing our sales.”\n\n“We are always looking for more local businesses to collaborate with, aid the local community and welcome any person / company to talk through more opportunities.”\n\nThe team at Mitchells Chartered Accountants has been recommended by Nine Limes Digital for being so helpful despite the web design agency not being a client and offering advice free of charge. Steve Bassett, Director of Nine Limes Design said: “Mitchells Chartered Accountants made us aware of the availability of discretionary grants to local businesses in the Chesterfield area which were not eligible to receive funding from other areas. Andrew provided invaluable support and advice in our successful application and I am extremely grateful for this.”\n\nDo check out more local businesses for your next tender.\n\nHow can you support your team?\n\nWith so much change over the past year, it’s likely you will have identified a need to invest in training to drive things forward.\n\nLast year Peak Pipe Systems, ControlPoint Ltd and Weightron Bilancia all upskilled their management teams with thousands of pounds worth of training – for free, thanks to a Government scheme.\n\nLaura Chapman HR Manager at Peak Pipe Systems commented: “Investing in our people is a priority but we have to keep an eye on our budgets. A number of talented staff across our shop floor, offices and warehouse had been promoted to team leaders, but had not received managerial training. Skills Support for the Workforce enabled us to support them in their roles.”\n\nChesterfield businesses have been benefiting from free online workshops. A new programme has been announced this month by D2N2 Growth Hub with courses ranging from email marketing to employee empowerment. And 12 week digital skills courses opened in December for both employees and job seekers with local training provider GBS offering courses in Digital Marketing, Content Creation and IT.\n\nThere’s support on hand to help your senior team establish goals for the year ahead with a free webinar from Business Doctors Chesterfield.\n\nAnd six businesses can access twelve months of complimentary coaching from ActionCOACH, with applications due by 29th January.\n\nSee more programmes that support with skills and training.\n\nIs it time to recruit?\n\nWhilst some redundancies may be unavoidable, the Government’s furlough scheme has helped millions of people to stay in employment. And you may be thinking about growing your team to hit the ground running ahead of recovery.\n\nLocal recruiters that are working with Destination Chesterfield to grow the town’s economy have been pleased to assist during the pandemic.\n\nIf you’re looking to recruit an apprentice like Chesterfield businesses Addooco, Inspire Design and Development and UKATA, the upcoming Chesterfield and North Derbyshire Employability and Skills Conference will provide a helpful platform to find out more. The Chesterfield Apprentice Town website is also very informative.\n\nCommunity Chesterfield, which supports the voluntary sector, has benefitted from the free recruitment of two interns through the University of Derby including graduate, Hayley Beaumont.\n\nCharlotte Repton, Project Manager of Community Chesterfield said: “Using Hayley’s design skills and expertise, Community Chesterfield was able to offer branding services free of charge to voluntary organisations, which included refreshing logos and designing web pages, delivering over £1000 worth of services during her short internship”.\n\nAnd Chesterfield businesses have been supported to offer virtual work experience to young people. For more details check out this information session on 27th January.\n\nCan you afford not to update your IT?\n\nIt requires careful planning to maintain adequate cash flow. But prioritising innovation will be key to unlocking post crisis growth. And there is financial support available to help you achieve this.\n\nThe Government Grant and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and the speedy response of Chesterfield Borough Council were cited as key factors in the recent growth of Chesterfield recruiter, Edwards Employment Solutions.\n\nIzabella Edwards, Managing Director explained: “Thanks to funding I was able to invest in a CRM system which allows the business to manage candidates and clients more easily, saving time and money. Having this system in place meant I had the resources and infrastructure to pitch for and secure a number of large contracts. It meant a complete turn-around for us and led to the business making four new appointments and needing larger offices.\n\nSimilarly, a free IT review from Central Technology has given Ashgate Hospicecare a strong understanding of future requirements, enabling the team to start 2021 in a stronger position.\n\nMatt Corbishley, Director of People and Performance, Ashgate Hospicecare said: “We enlisted the services of CT to help us ensure technology provided the foundations we need to support our charitable objectives and long term future goals. The team have worked closely with our IT Manager, leadership team and board of trustees to develop a technology roadmap that met these long term charitable and business objectives.”\n\nHow can you raise your profile?\n\nWhether your business is busy or temporarily closed, it’s always a good idea to remind current and future customers that you are here and to maintain a positive image of yourself in your customer’s mind, ready for when they are looking to access you.\n\nSome of the companies that have been learning how to gain free coverage within the local media include Liza Bakes, StraightCurves and A&A Photography. Destination Chesterfield’s PR free workshops run twice a year and the first 2021 date will be announced shortly.\n\nAnd there are currently 190 local organisations – known as Chesterfield Champions – working with Destination Chesterfield to raise the profile of the town and its successful businesses.\n\nIt has been a popular time to invest in improvements to the online customer experience. Love Brewing has made its website more user friendly and added more product lines. Cheese Factor has traded online for the first time by adding Shopify to its existing website. Rosewood Wealth is taking appointments through Shop Appy.\n\nAnd businesses have been thinking creatively when it comes to live experiences. Bridal boutique, Precious Memories brought her brand to life outdoors in St James Square at Vicar Lane Shopping Centre, also utilising the new big screen where a number of independent retailers have been promoted.\n\nDotique was one of a number of Chesterfield businesses to benefit from free inclusion in the Fiver Fest scheme promoted by S40 Local to encourage shopping locally.\n\nClaire from Stephenson’s Tea & Coffee House was grateful of free promotion in Twist magazine, which responded to the pandemic by setting up a loyalty card scheme for readers. Claire said: “We’ve been shown cards by people coming in, entitling them to receive a free hot drink with their breakfasts. I regularly received comments from people who say they have seen our offer mentioned in Twist.”\n\nA safe space to work?\n\nDuring lockdown many small and start-up businesses have found themselves sharing their home office workspace with partners, who have suddenly found themselves working from home, as well as with children who are self-isolating.\n\nWorking at local cafes such as Stephensons Tea and Coffee House has provided quiet and productive space to work, and will be appreciated again once venues can reopen. And Chesterfield’s meeting spaces have strengthened hygiene policies to provide a safe space to meet ready for reopening (although please do check with each individual venue as the end of lockdown approaches).\n\nIf you’re looking for new premises in the near future, the team at Chesterfield Borough Council can carry out a free property search for your business. One option is the Chesterfield Enterprise Centre, which is due to be completed in spring 2021.\n\nLocal charity, Junction Arts, which works with people to improve well-being and inspire change through the arts, recently moved into West Studios to take advantage of the benefits the space offers. Jemma Burton from the team at Junction Arts said:\n\n“It is really nice to be in the office at West Studios. The studio space works really well for us on a practical level and moving gave us a better deal because of everything that was included as part of the tenancy: utilities, internet, security, cleaning, and parking are all part of the package. The money we have saved on our running costs will go directly into projects which will benefit communities. Not only that, it has a nice feel to it from a social and networking point of view. There is a welcoming atmosphere. We are meeting different tenants and making connections with artists and different businesses. It is a great place to raise your profile.”\n\nWest Studios has also launched a virtual office space to support small and start-up businesses in Chesterfield to develop and be part of a bigger network of creative industries.\n\nTime to become more sustainable?\n\nTackling the effects of climate change is a key priority for Chesterfield Borough Council, having declared a climate emergency. And East Midlands Chamber has launched its Sustainable East Midlands campaign to help businesses engage with the sustainability agenda.\n\nAlthough some businesses may be reluctant to the required changes coming from new regulations, becoming greener also brings opportunities to reduce costs, for securing new business and for innovation.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Chesterfield based Custom Solar created energy savings for local company, Xbite, equivalent to supplying eight average UK homes with electricity for one year. Xbite was awarded a maximum value £20,000 low-carbon energy grant to help install over 270 solar panels at its HQ offices at Barlborough and warehouse at Markham Vale.\n\nNick Whitehead, managing director at Xbite, said: “The DE-Carbonise Team took all the hassle away from applying for the grant and were great to work with. Solar panels will help us reduce our CO2 emissions by 20,731kg per year, and generate 74,760 kWh per year of electricity, some of which we will be able to sell back to the National Grid.”\n\nThe DE-Carbonise project launched in November 2019 and is a 3-year extension to the previously successful and award-winning D2EE project, part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund. Grants of up to £20,000 are available for businesses looking to improve their environmental practices. Over 500 businesses in Derby and Derbyshire have been supported to date.\n\nLet’s work together\n\nIt’s likely your business has already engaged with other local organisations – either before or during the pandemic. The town is well-known for collaborative working and Destination Chesterfield is pleased to link together with partners to support growth and development.\n\nWe’d love to say hello.\n\nIf you would like to access marketing and other local opportunities, training, peer networks or a free business adviser with bespoke advice for your needs, please contact Tara Underhill for more information: 07392868746 or tara.underhill@chesterfield.co.uk.\n\nThe economic recovery has stalled in the East Midlands as tightening Covid-19 restrictions took their toll on businesses, according to new research published today.\n\nAn East Midlands Chamber study found cashflow and advanced orders were significantly affected for many firms during the final quarter of 2020 as the second national lockdown in November – straddled by the most severe tiered coronavirus restrictions imposed on the region and the uncertainty leading to the end of the Brexit transition period – undermined resilience to future shocks and the ability to respond to new opportunities.\n\nHowever, the Quarterly Economic Survey for Q4 2020 showed signs of light at the end of the tunnel as a net 16% of businesses in Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire said they expected to create jobs in the three months following the study, which was conducted in November – while there were also positive indicators for turnover, profitability and investment intentions.\n\nThe restrained confidence for the prospects of 2021 was reflected in the Chamber’s State of the Economy Index, which aggregates the survey data to provide an overall “health score”, as it flatlined following the rebound of Q3.\n\nChris Hobson, director of policy and external affairs at East Midlands Chamber, said: “Future pricing intentions started to creep up as increases in raw material costs – along with access difficulties – began to impact on manufacturers. Advanced orders and bookings were down for many as the national lockdown in November caused some to pause their plans and a general sentiment of ‘wait and see’ started to pervade the conversations of some.\n\n“In conversations with businesses, many spoke of a ‘weariness’ and ‘fatigue’ at navigating themselves and their staff through the difficulties of the past 10 months.\n\n“However, there was still an undercurrent of tentative optimism for the coming year, as reflected in the confidence indicators for future turnover and profitability, perhaps acknowledging that the current predicament can’t last forever.\n\n“The economy, as a whole, hasn’t slipped back to the place it was in during May and June, nor has it continued its rebound from that position. Instead, it can best be described as ‘treading water, waiting to see whether the final days of a year that asked more questions than anyone would have anticipated finally delivered some answers.”\n\nKey findings of East Midlands Chamber Quarterly Economic Survey for Q4 2020\n\nSome 476 businesses across Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire took part in the Chamber’s Quarterly Economic Survey for Q4 2020.\n\nA third of these were from a manufacturing background, while 200 exporters were represented within the cohort.\n\nKey findings from the survey, conducted between 2 and 23 November, showed:\n\n• Sales decreased for a net 9% of businesses involved in the UK market and net 17% of firms in the overseas market in the three months leading to the survey\n\n• Advanced orders for the three months following the study were down for a net 14% of companies in the UK market and net 21% of those with international operations\n\n• Cashflow worsened for a net 15% of companies. This was the fourth consecutive quarter in which this indicator fell into negative territory\n\n• Investment intentions were in positive territory, with spending plans revised upwards for a net 2% when it comes to buying new plant, machinery or equipment, and a net 10% for training\n\n• A net 6% decreased their workforce during Q4 but a net 16% expected headcount to increase over the first three months of Q1 2021\n\n• Business confidence levels remained stable after a deep fall over the summer. A net 35% of firms expected turnover to improve in Q1 2021 and a net 20% predicted a rise in profitability\n\nWhat policymakers must do in 2021 to help businesses\n\nThe Chamber models the survey data across a range of key performance indicators, including sales and orders, recruitment, cashflow, investment intentions and confidence, to produce a quarterly State of the Economy Index, which enables it to compare local business performance quarter-by-quarter.\n\nIn Q2, the score fell to -411, its lowest level on record and the first time it’s fallen into negative territory. It was back into positive territory for Q3 – but only just at +17 – and there was only a three-point increase to +20 in Q4.\n\nThis means it remains the third lowest score on record and 221 points lower than the pre-Covid survey for Q1 2020.\n\nChris added: “It’s clear that 2020 was unprecedented, unpredictable and created amazing levels of uncertainty. Much of what has gone on has been out of businesses’ ability to control. However, under those circumstances, with one hand tied behind their backs, they have worked to manage those factors that they can control, looking for internal efficiencies, improvements in quality and new opportunities.\n\n“As we move into 2021, policymakers must do likewise. It is in their gift to control the nation’s capacity for testing, the speed at which a vaccine is rolled out and the availability and reading of data on how the pandemic is progressing.\n\n“They can also control the levels of business support provided, the rules as to how it’s accessed, and the measures that exist to allow businesses to reopen and make money without Government support.\n\n“It is essential that we get this right for 2021, particularly as we begin the year in the worst possible manner with the prospect of at least two months of national lockdown.\n\n“Despite all the challenges of the past year, the vast majority of businesses have made it through – with some even finding opportunities to excel. If the first half of 2021 follows a similar pattern to the past six months, then more of those currently treading water may sadly slip under.”\n\nDestination Chesterfield chair, Peter Swallow has outlined his hopes and aspirations for Chesterfield and North Derbyshire as we enter the new year…\n\nFollowing what has been a very difficult year for everyone, we go into 2021 with hope, in the knowledge that a vaccine will soon hopefully eradicate Coronavirus, there is an undercurrent of excitement and energy going into the New Year.\n\nWith light at the end of the tunnel, we can now not only look forwards but also back at what has been achieved, despite the pandemic.\n\nWhile we may have felt that 2020 was a year in limbo, now that we have time to reflect, we can see that the town made significant progress in the face of adversity enabling us to go into 2021 with a firm foundation for growth.\n\nPre Covid our strong and proud Shop Local message came to the fore during lockdown. As our high street closed, we opened our laptops and phones and shopped locally virtually with help from Destination Chesterfield and the local media. They sprang into action and brought attention to the myriad of independent retailers and market traders to ensure we gave them our business.\n\nThe very real experience of the high street closing I believe, has made us value it even more. We have missed the opportunity of being able to ‘pop’ into town and meet up with friends or simply bump into them while out on errands.\n\nIt is the strong community spirit that exists in Chesterfield that makes us resilient as a town and able to face the catastrophic effects of a pandemic head on. I am proud that we didn’t bunker down and ride out the storm- we chose to fight it head on instead. This resilience has enabled us to identify opportunities which have emerged during the pandemic; one of these being the growth in demand for quality office space, a fact which is acknowledged by virtually all commercial property advisors and consultants.\n\nExperts agree that working from home is not a long-term option for a number of reasons. I know that I am fed up with it! Instead, they predict that we will combine home and office working.\n\nRather than having a single large office, large companies will want to spread risk and look to regional markets like Chesterfield in which to establish satellite offices.\n\nChesterfield could not be better positioned to capitalise on this opportunity in 2021. Three new office developments will open – the Enterprise Centre at Northern Gateway, No.1 Waterside Place at Chesterfield Waterside and Glass Yard on Sheffield Road.\n\nThe offices will of course benefit the town centre as office workers will create critical footfall in local shops, stores and market stalls.\n\nIt is this forward thinking, resilience and community spirit that will ensure Chesterfield thrives in the face of a global recession, just as it did 10 years ago when the council established Destination Chesterfield. If history repeats itself then we have much to look forward to in 2021 and beyond."
