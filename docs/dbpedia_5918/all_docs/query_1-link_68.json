I have made a couple of visits to Rwanda and heard first-hand the gruelling and heart-wrenching accounts of survivors of the genocide that tore their country apart. It’s only when you hear these stories, and accounts from any holocaust survivor that you truly realise how awful these events were.\n\nWe must learn lessons from the past, and Holocaust Memorial Day is a poignant opportunity to promote democratic and tolerant societies, free from prejudice, where every individual has a right to participate fully throughout all forms society and across all cultures."
