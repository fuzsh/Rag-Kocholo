Please tell your friends and neighbours and anyone else who has an interest in our historic village so full of memories. If you have something interesting to share, write an article for us. It’s quite therapeutic too, in these difficult times.\n\nThis months ‘Memories’ is another excellent piece of research written by Andrew Thurman, who has been searching the National Archives for the early Mills and Wills of very early residents of Darley Abbey. It concerns a dispute in 1650 in the London Courts between Godbehear a mill-owner in Darley and the Mundy’s of Markeaton and Allestree, who denied him access to his mills on the Darley / Allestree border. We are trying to work out which mills and land were disputed.\n\nIndustries of Darley Abbey before the Evans’ Cotton Mill – Part Two:\n\nMills, Farms and a Forge:-\n\nIn part one of Darley Abbey Historical Group newsletter I wrote about the Bullock’s were who Lords of the Manor for about eighty years at Darley Abbey for three generations of Bullocks. John Bullock acquired Darley Abbey in 1574 from the son of Sir William West.\n\nIn 1654 and 1656 Thomas Goodbehere, a yeoman lead miner acquired Darley Abbey in several purchases (as described in part one). He acquired Darley Hall separately from two water torn mills, known as Darley Malt Mill and Darley Corn Mill. These mills were likely owned by Darley Abbey canons until the dissolution of the abbey in October, 1538 and two mills in Darleigh were recorded in a survey of water torn mills, commissioned by King James I in 1608 the two mills annual value of income was £3 6s 8d (see FIG 1).\n\nFIG 01: Extract From Survey of the King’s Water Mills in 1608:\n\nThe two mills in 1608 recorded in “Derleigh Priory” are most likely the same one’s Thomas Goodbehere acquired in 1654, but the purchase of the mills was far from straightforward as John Mundy Esquire, of Markeaton bought them from William Bullock in about 1652 and purchased them by a proxy deed. This meant that Mundy did not buy the mills directly from William Bullock but from a third party broker. Thomas Goodbehere had made an agreement with John Mundy to buy three closes (cul-de-sacs) known locally as Shroggs Close, Forge Close and Bramble Close; land and “two water corn mills” with a wain-croft (storage barn) attached to the Allestree / Darley Abbey boundary wall on the Darley Abbey side of the boundary. NOTE: “water-torn” may mean two mills separated by a steam or river?\n\nThomas Goodbehere had agreed to pay to John Mundy £1,350 totally by Midsummer Day on 24 June, 1656 and he paid an installment of £500 and another £50 before 7TH February, 1655 for maintenance of roads from the mills passing from Darley Abbey to Allestree and towards the repair of the mills. However, Goodbehere was suspicious on at least two counts; John Mundy had mortgaged the mills in another agreement predating his agreement with Thomas Goodbehere and it was made with Charles Bate, Thomas Hallam and George Allestree and was made by John Mundy on the eighth of May, 1653. This was a conveyance or mortgage trust fund set up to raise money on the “two water-torn” mills. The money raised from the mortgage on the mills was put into trust for John Mundy’s youngest children and to discharge the debts of John Mundy. Furthermore, when Goodbehere asked to see the proxy deed obtained by a third party in which Mundy said he’d purchased the two mills with horses, land, and three closes from William Bullock, Mundy stalled and said the deed was “mislaid or in the hands of a friend”.\n\nThis spooked Thomas Goodbehere and he smelled a rat, so he made a complaint to the Chancery Court dealing with land and deed disputes asking for John Mundy to prove the mills, land and closes were not mortgaged and to produce the proxy deed he claimed he held for this property purchased from William Bullock (see FIG 2).\n\nFIG 2: Header of Thomas Goodbehere’s “Orator” (Address) Dated 7TH February, 1655: “To the right honorable the Lord Commissioners of the Great Seats of England:- Courtesy the National Archives – Crown Copyright.\n\nBasically, plaintiff, Thomas Goodbehere explained about the agreement he made with John Mundy Esq. and the situation about the mislaid deed and mortgage arrangement for two mills that Mundy previously entered into with three other parties before he sold it to him. I don’t know if John Mundy attended this hearing and it was more than one year before he answered the complaints of Goodbehere on 27TH May, 1656.\n\nI think after this time John Mundy acquired a reputation for dodgy dealings, albeit there is a possibility that his judgment towards the high church was coloured by his being both a Parliamentarian and a Presbyterian. Nevertheless, in the future he was to be called out and taken to court on at least two more occasions:\n\nMackworth Church and Allestree Chapel were obtained by purchase of the Priory of St. Mary, Darley Abbey C.1438 when the Touchets fortunes were reversed. So the priest and rector were entitled to tithes and the living of Mackworth paid by Darley Abbey priory and tithes (10%) of the parish produce were paid from local produce including wool and grain. The abbey sold off assets to avoid seizure of assets with the dissolution of the abbeys on the horizon in October 1538 to avoid their seizure by the Crown. The funding of Mackworth Church and Allestree Chapel and the right to collect manor tithes was sold separately and passed through different hands over the years and ended up in the hands of Francis Mundy, the father of John Mundy ii. In 1650 a Parliamentary Commission confirmed he as “impropriator” and rector of the tithes having an income of £300 per annum and at this time the living was vacant.\n\nFrancis Munday died in 1650 and his son John Mundy ii became the Lord of the Manor and he appropriated the assets of the living of Mackworth, including the parsonage, and tithes of hay and glebe land and Easter dues of Mackworth. This caused Mark Hope, who was jointly the vicar of Kedleston and Mackworth since June 1663, to take Mundy to “The Court of his Majesty’s Exchequer” in September, 1663 in the hope of restoring his living of Mackworth. Hope said that John Mundy ii had sold the assets that were part of the living of Mackworth in 1650, the year he inherited the title “impropriator” upon the death of his father Francis Mundy. We don’t know the outcome of Mark Hope’s “Orator” as plaintiff as there is no record of any answer given by John Mundy.\n\nFIG 3: Extract From a Derbyshire Miscellany article by Rosemary Lucas “ A Dispute and Mystery Solved? The quarrel between John Mundy, Lord of the Manor of Markeaton, Mackworth and Allestree and Mark Hope the vicar of Mackworth in 1663 and its consequences”\n\nThe Reverend Hope, possibly had the last word preventing John Mundy ii from being buried at Mackworth Church, the traditional burial place of the Mundy’s. John Mundy ii was buried at St. Edmunds, Allestree on 22ND April, 1681.\n\nFIG 4: Law suit Against John Mundy Brought by Allestree Parishioners in 1682 – (Courtesy Derby Daily Telegraph, 9TH August, 1929)\n\nHooray! In 1682, the parishoners of Allestree won their case and John Mundy was ordered to restore such property (fields and houses) as did not belong to him within one month. But he was dead and buried by then in Allestree.\n\nReturning to the “Answer of John Mundy” as the defendant to the accussations made by Thomas Goodbehere. He made his answer on 27TH May 1656 and this is recorded at the Chancery Court.\n\nFIG 5: John Mundy Answer – Header. 27TH May, 1656, “The answer of John Mundy Esquire to the bill of complaint of Thomas Goodbehere” Courtesy National Archives\n\nJohn Mundy addressed the court to reply to the points complained of by Thomas Goodbehere and said that the deed of ownership he received from William Bullock was mislaid and promised that he had received the said deed and that a replacement bill was necessary to legalese his lawful ownership in order to legally sell on to Thomas Goodbehere.\n\nMundy reiterated that in the earlier hearing, the plaintiff Thomas Goodbehere had said that he made an agreement to buy land, two mills with horses and three closes; Shroggs Close, Forge Close and Bramble Close in Darley Abbey. At the plaintiff’s hearing he’d said much about the money due in April, 1655. Mundy stated he bought the land, closes and mills including the boundary wall separating Allestree from Darley Abbey from William Bullock by proxy deed (meaning a third party)?\n\nIn April, 1654 Mundy said he made a contract agreement with Thomas Goodbehere for him to buy a wall and two water- torn mills and a wain-croft (Barn or store building). For this Goodbehere agreed to pay five hundred pounds in hand and the remaining balance of eight hundred and fifty pounds by Midsummer Day (24TH June 1656). Before Godbehere would receive the draft deed, he was to pay another eight hundred and fifty pounds balance and “then it would be his and his heirs forever”.\n\nTranscript Notes: There was a mention by John Mundy that Thomas Goodbehere had been paying the initial five hundred pounds at a rate of 6 pounds (interest?). I think that the initial five hundred pounds was supposed to be for the three closes and the eight hundred and fifty pounds for the two “water-torn mills” and the storage barn. In Goodbehere’s earlier testament he mentioned he’d agreed to pay another fifty pounds towards maintenance of the mills and roads leaving the mills and into Allestree. In Thomas Godbehere’s will, made in 1658, the two “water-torn mills”, known as Darleigh Malt Mill and Darleigh Corn Mill were mentioned. But there was no mention of the three closes, Shroggs Close, Forge Close and Bramble Close. He did mention another; Flower Close in his 1658 will that was to be a dowry for his stepdaughter. Also in the will, Goodbehere mentioned that upon his death some of his property may be seized.\n\nTranscript continued:\n\nMundy said that Goodbehere should receive a draft deed of assurance from him for the closes, mills and “wain-croft” (storage barn) and would convey the promise that he John Monday received this of William Bullock lawfully and by good promise and that the deed would show the ownership was passed from John Mundy to Thomas Goodbehere and his heirs forever. The agreement from William Bullock transferring the ownership was informal and the agreement made by promises and Mundy could not remember if it was drawn up into a formal deed of contract or not. Whereas, stated Mundy, Thomas Goodbehere had debunked the validity of John Mundy’s agreement with William Bullock as the IOU and promissory notes connected with the transaction between William Bullock and John Mundy was mislaid and could not yet be found. Mundy said he had no doubt that the missing deed or promises could be found once the full amount agreed between he and Thomas Goodbehere was paid in full, the sum of one thousand three hundred and fifty pounds by Midsummer Day, 24TH June, 1656.\n\nJohn Mundy said that he’d given proof out of court to Thomas Goodbehere that the two mills were no longer under any mortgage agreement with other parties. This meant that the agreement made with Charles Bate, Edward Heely and George Allestree was now settled and clear. The previous occupants had left and Thomas Goodbehere was now in full possession of the two mills. William Mundy said he desired to give the deed to the mills to Thomas Goodbehere and the deed might be in some friend’s hands and if the complainant (Goodbehere) pleases he would convey the deed from William Bullock to Thomas Goodbehear and his heirs forever. Until the deed is found the conveyance of assurance was to be “this draft” unto the complainant and his heirs and that was previously explained to the complainant before he agreed to the purchases of the land and mills. Mundy stated It was true that Goodbehere had a good hearing in the Chancery Court “about groats” (small money) and that the complainant might have his promise and assurance that he might retain the residue (remaining) eight hundred and fifty pounds and IOU interest for the said agreement did as and unto one Mr. Roger Allestry, a friend of the complainant desires surety and a promise of the said mills, land and promise made to Charles Bate, Edward Heely and George Allestry and that the promise might advise his counsel and yet a good conveyance drawn from this deed that and his transfer of the mills, land and promise that it might be done without the sight of the conveyance made as aforesaid by William Bullock unto this deed and land as aforesaid and then advised the said William Bullock to deliver unto the counterpart without that Anion (seller of security) of the maker or things with him in the said deed sealed and delivered. A duplicate of the deed might be reproduced and notarized by the court. Mundy said he would pay a “reasonable cost” of making a duplicate deed and having it notarized.\n\nNotes: It is not surprising that Thomas Goodbehere was suspicious and asked the court to subpoena John Mundy to attend court and he did so (after fifteen months) and presented quite extraordinary reasons for not being able to produce the deed and his reasons and excuses, I think, must have raised some eyebrows on their Lordship’s bench.\n\nI don’t know what the judgment was by their Lordships and I can only surmise the two parties managed to come to an agreement. I say this because the 1658 will of Thomas Goodbehere did NOT mention his leaving the three closes, known locally as Shroggs Close, Forge Close and Bramble Close, whereas he did mention in the will that he would bequeath another close, known locally as Flower Close. He also made his intentions clear to bequeath his two “water-torn” mills, known locally as Darley Malt Mill and Darley Corn Mill.\n\nThrough the will of Thomas Goodbehere in 1658 and his litigation with John Mundy Esquire in 1655 & 1656, we learn the names of four closes (cul-de-sacs) and that he owned (or tried to own), two “water-corn mills”, possibly this was two mills separated by water. We learn that he lived in Darley Park in an early “Darley Hall”. I have a hunch that the heart of Darley village was probably closer to Allestree boundary wall than it is today and as a boy playing on Appleby’s Field, in-between Nut-wood and Weirfield Road, I recall seeing foundation stones of old buildings around where the Nutwood Close development now stands. I believe the ancient boundary wall separating the parishes of Darley Abbey and Allestree also ran along there (see FIG 6).\n\nAlthough I think the heart of the villager’s settlement may have been closer to the Allestree – Darley Abbey boundary wall than where it is now. Also there are said to be the remains of a tiled chapel floor in a private garden in South Avenue, being close to the Allestree boundary. It also occurred to me that the Hill Square and the Flat Square are essentially closes or cul-de-sacs with no passing through rout. In places on the Squares, there are some older foundation stones under cottages built at the end of the eighteenth century, so it’s possible that Thomas Goodbehere’s closes mentioned in the litigation with John Mundy and his will, stood here. Also “Nutwood Brook “could have supplied a small village with fresh water. See Darley Abbey Liberty Map dated 1811 (showing Nutwood Brook) adjoined to Allestree Field map dated 1737 (FIG 6) and photos of Nutwood Brook and ancient stone conduit (FIG 6).\n\nFIG 6:\n\nMap Showing Parish Boundary Allestree & Darley Abbey and photos of Nutwood Brook and an\n\nold Stone Culvert. Curtsey Darley Abbey Historical Group Report #3 Hydraulic Arrangements\n\nat Darley Abbey, by Alan Bradwell.\n\nThe name of one of the closes, known locally was “Forge Close”, so I think; it’s a fair bet that there was a metalwork furnace in this location.\n\nOTHER INDUSTRIES IN DARLEY ABBEY:\n\nOther manufacturing buildings were often referred to as mills, even though they weren’t engaged in grinding cereal and did not necessarily need a water wheel.\n\nGeorge Beige was a Darley Abbey papermaker and his mill was in Darley Abbey when he married Mary Bakewell on 5 July, 1719. His father Robert Bage was a Staffordshire paper maker and a novelist. His mill was likely the same one that stood on the banks of the River Derwent, where Dean’s Field is now. A photo that was taken of the paper mill, about 1930, was in the Darley Abbey FC article, in the DAHG March 2022, newsletter. Charles Wooley Bage was a son of George Beige and he was an engineer and a pioneer of using iron to frame industrial buildings. Although he didn’t work on the Evans mill, he did observe and learn from William Strutt who designed the fireproofing of Darley Mill when it was rebuilt and reopened in 1793 after catching fire.\n\nSteel frame and steel roof supports were used in Darley mill as well as wrapping steel sheets around wooden beams to prevent and delay fires. The mill at Darley was insured and rebuilt in 1788, whereas the Strutt mill at Cromford was not insured against fire when it burned down. So the work of William Strutt and Darley Abbey born Charles Wooley Bage, in developing steel structures for industrial buildings was pioneering.\n\nThe Rev. Edmund Evans, brother of Thomas Evans who built the Boar’s Head Cotton Mill, in 1773 acquired a corn mill, a tin mill, a paper mill and a flint mill from Abraham Hirst of Derby. The Evanses also owned a rope mill (hemp fibers) and a red lead mill (see FIG 9).\n\nFIG 9 (below) : Extract Boar’s Head Mills Old Lane Darley Abbey City of Derby – A Survey and Investigation of the Cotton Mills and Ancillary Buildings\n\nCourtesy of English Heritage by Adam Menuge.\n\nIn 1762 Josiah Wedgewood developed a process that enabled potteries to fire cream-white porcelain. Before this new process English pottery was thick and the colours of red marl clay or at best a grey colour. Wedgewood found that by firing flint in a kiln and then grinding it with water, the resulting white paste added to the clay produced fine cream-white pottery. At this time many water powered grain mills were converted to flint mills, especially in the potteries. Darley Abbey had at least one flint mill supplying the china works in Derby, belonging to Abraham Hirst. This was important as it allowed English potteries to produce fine cream-white pottery at a fraction of the cost of fine imported Chinese pottery (see FIGS 10 & 11).\n\nPreviously I surmised that Darley Malt Mill, owned by Thomas Goodbehere also had a kiln for roasting the germinated sweet barley grains used in brewing beer. Although I found no records for a maltster business in Darley Abbey, I have found a marriage record for “Richard Lowndes Maltstser of Darley Abbey” to Elizabeth Sculthorpe.\n\nFIG 12: Marriage Record of Richard Lowndes to Elizabeth Sculthorpe.\n\nDarley Abbey had, “Darley Malt Mill” and a Maltster who lived in Darley Abbey in 1791, so it’s likely the malt mill kilned and maltstered its own sweet barley grains and brewed beer.\n\nBefore Brick Row was built at end of the eighteenth century, the street was known as Brick Kiln Street and the Evanses had bricks fired there for the cotton mill workers cottages. Kilns in this location would be convenient for kilning malt, especially as it’s a short trip to the river bank where “Darley Malt Mill” would have stood. Also one of the mills was converted to a flint mill in the 1760’s so kilns were needed to fire and soften the flint stones before grinding.\n\nIn 1828, Samuel Evans set up his old school friend with the old flour mill in Darley Abbey and with the shop, presumably on Abbey Lane. The Derbyshire Advertiser in 1926 published two letters from people remembering the flint mill, red-lead mill and flour mill. Possibly all these industries were in the same mill in different time periods. See FIGS 13 & 14.\n\nLawrence Greensmith and his family were millers and shopkeepers in Darley Abbey for about three generations, Lawrence Greensmith died in June 1862 See FIG 15.\n\nAGRICULTURE, FARMING AND INDUSTRY FROM THE TIME OF THE ABBEY:\n\nThe canons of Darley Abbey Priory received and gave tithes of produce, supposed to have been 10% of the produce of a parish. To glean an idea of the typical kinds of produce is listed in various charters. Charters will only have been written when the canons scope and responsibilities have to be defined. There won’t be any charters showing produce grown or livestock reared in abbey owned lands unless they were obliged to give tithes, pannage for an outsider’s pigs, collecting firewood, wool, sheepskins and ale. They were granted all these commodities and rights far and wide, from St. Thomas the Martyr in Stafford, Newstead Abbey, Wigwell and Wirksworth to name just a few. Darley Priory probably had as many lay brothers as they did canons. The lay brothers would have done any manual tasks like farming, butchering meat, cooking and ground maintenance, whereas canons preached in surrounding churches and took the sacraments.\n\nThere was a stone quarry owned by the abbey bordering Allestree and Derleigh and part of it was near to the palm court island and where the trolley bus terminus was next to the Court Barbeque Café (later known as Palm Court).\n\nFIG 17: Extract – English Episcopal Acta 1980: David Michael Smith, M. J. Franklin, B. R. Kemp giving Robert de Piro & Son William Augmentation (Building of Darley Abbey) and Henry Tuschet and Son Simon the Right to Quarry Stone from Abbey Owned Land circa 1175.\n\nSheepskins and wool was a valuable commodity to Darley Priory and it derived a considerable income from the sale of wool and it was exported to Flanders having passed through the Derby Market C.1300. Pilkington’s: Derby Its Rise and Progress, “Darley Abbey wool was on Flemish price lists among others”. About 1384 the canons had a reputation for high and extravagant living about this time and that it was decreed the king had taken over the revenues of the abbey for four years on account of “divers oppressions and wrongs done to it by adversaries causing a diminution of its revenues and of divine service and other works of piety”.\n\nThe same source gives us a remarkable story that is so fantastic, I can’t decide if it’s a gossipy tale or a remarkable fact and this is supposed to have happened in 1535, not long before the dissolution of Darley Abbey in October, 1538 and the abbot and the canons of Derleigh took action to avoid the King’s asset strippers. The value of that money shipped in fleeces is about £70 million in today’s money (according to National Archives online inflation calculator (See FIG 18).\n\nFIG 18: Extract Pilkington – Derby Its Rise and Progress – 1901 by A.W.

It’s quite therapeutic too, in these difficult times.\n\nThis months ‘Memories’ is an excellent piece of research written by Andrew Thurman, who has been searching the Archives for the early Mills and Wills of very early residents of Darley Abbey.\n\nThe Industries of Darley Abbey before the Evans’ Cotton Mill of 1788 – Part one Mills:\n\nThe Darley Abbey Historical Group booklet #6, gives a sketch of the mills of Darley Abbey from Roman times and the time of the abbey founded circa mid twelfth century until the dissolution at Darley in October, 1538. Just to recap; it is likely the Romans made a mill on the River Derwent in Derby or Darley Abbey, although there is no archeological evidence thus far confirming the existence of any Roman mill. However an archeological watching brief on the construction of a “Fish Pass” adjacent to the island on the River Derwent, near the weir, recorded wooden structural support posts and “stone foundations or packing” and this is thought to be evidence of a mill from the time of the abbey. Dendrochronology dating from tree-rings from laboratory tested samples (wooden posts), indicated the timbers were felled at the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 16th century, pointing to a date just before the dissolution of Darley Abbey.\n\nFIG 01: Location of island and wooden posts excavated from the fish pass site, courtesy of Trent Rivers Trust.\n\nBottom left shows a “linear stone foundation or packing” courtesy of Trent & Peak Archeology.\n\nThe dating of the timber posts indicated that the structure from which they came were dated from the early 1500’s, however charters show that the “villa of Derby had 14 mills in 1066 and just 10 mills by 1086 and by ‘the latter half of the twelfth century there were 6 owned by Darley Abbey canons although I doubt that they were all in Darley Abbey.\n\nAuthor’s Note: The wooden posts may have been water level markers and not structural? See a description of water level posts at the Breadsall Mill pool in Charter #05540486.\n\nFIG 02: From the Introduction to the Cartulary of Darley Abbey by Reginald Ralph Darlington\n\nVarious cartularies of Darley Abbey mentioned mills belonging to or associated with Darley Abbey translated from Latin by Reginald Ralph Darlington (1947):\n\nCharter #05540357 in 1205: Chillwell, Notts on the River Erewash, the canons retained one-third of said mill and Sampson of Strelley (co Notts) and Ralf de Wildbuf the other two-thirds\n\nCharter #05540486 in 1240: Agreement between the lord Robert de Dun and abbot Ralph in these terms:- the canons shall make in their mill-pool on the Derwent (at Breadsall), below their court, a 30 foot sluice in addition to the old 24 foot sluice and shall maintain both in perpetuity and they shall not raise the level of the said pool above at which it stood in 24 year of Henry iii (1239 – 1240), and when the water reaches this level, the canons shall open the sluice gates for the liberation of excess water. If the water is raised above the appointed level, indicated by six stakes, fixed to the side of the said pool, it shall be reduced without litigation and delay, by lawful men of the neighbourhood. 1239 – 1240.\n\nCharter #05540487 in 1268: Grant by Hugh de Dun to the canons that they may make and maintain their mill-pool on the Derwent (at Breadsall) a sluice with nine flood gates provided that the water level was not raised above the level at which it stood in year 52 of Henry iii (1267 – 1268).\n\nNOTE: Hugh de Dun was lord of Breadsall at the time this charter was granted.\n\nCharter #05540488 in 1291: Agreement by which Richard de Curzon, lord of the lands which Hugh de Breadsall held, granted to the canons that they may and maintain their mill pool on the Derwent, provided it is not raised above the level at the making of this agreement. 3 May, 1291.\n\nCHARTERS HELD BY THE DUKE OF RUTLAND AND PRESERVED AT BELVOIR:\n\nThe following charter is of uncertain date but was made by William de Ferrers ii, forth Earl of Derby (1197 – 1247):\n\nFIG 03: Reconfirmation of charter originally made by Robert de Ferrers ii 2nd Earl of Derby by William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby from 1197 – 1247.\n\nIn this charter, three mills are mentioned, owned by de Ferrers and with liberties assigned to the canons of Darley Abbey:\n\nMill at Duffield\n\nMill at Aldeport\n\nMill at Derby on the Derwent\n\nNotes: I also believe there was a mill owned by the abbey at Markeaton Brook or Mackworth, but I didn’t yet find any charter to sketch in the involvement of this mill with Darley Abbey. Regarding the wooden posts excavated on site of Darley Abbey, River Derwent Fish-Pass, there is no charter or deed confirming a monastic mill here. This land and the river therein were owned by the abbey so charters and deeds were not necessary.\n\nAfter the dissolution of Darley Abbey and assets were stripped the land and abbey remains were sold to Sir William West who “altered some of the conventional buildings or built a new house thereon for his own residence”. I don’t know of any involvement by him with Darley mills or other industries and perhaps his will, of which a copy is in the possession of Darley Abbey Historical Group, may glean some information after it is transcribed later.\n\nThe son of Sir William West sold the Darley Abbey estate to John Bullocke Esquire of Norton in 1574 and he rebuilt the abbey house and his sons and grandsons continued in possession of Darley Abbey estate for eighty years. A descriptive catalogue of the charters, roles, deeds, pedigrees, pamphlets, monumental inscriptions, maps and miscellaneous papers forming the “Jackson Papers”, was formally held by Sheffield Public Reference Library and contains some informative deeds, relating to the Bullocke’s of Darley Abbey.\n\nFIG 04: From Catalogue of Rolls Deeds.\n\nJohn Bullocke owned extensive lands and property all over Derbyshire including 6 mills at Greenhill.\n\nFIG 05: From Catalogue of Rolls Deeds.\n\nThis deed mentioned the three sons of John Bullocke, John Bullocke (jr), Francis Bullocke and Henry Bullocke. This settlement of lands owned and resettled after revoking, again lists yet more land owned by John Bullocke.\n\nFIG 06: From Catalogue of Rolls Deeds.\n\nThe first John Bullocke died in 1607 and an inquest was held into his death. In 1603 he created an estate at Darleighe Abbey) for his second son, Francis Bullocke.\n\nFIG 07: From Catalogue of Rolls Deeds.\n\nThere were three John Bullocke’s and this was the third one, a grandson of John Bullocke who acquired Darley Abbey in 1574. The property in all the named places was put into trust for John Bullocke iii, for all his life.\n\nFIG 08: From Catalogue of Rolls Deeds.\n\nThis is a marriage settlement deed of the second John Bullocke, detailing dowry payments to be made to his wife Agnes Coke. At Norton, then in Derbyshire and nowadays is part of Sheffield, he owned “New Mill” and an iron forge and iron works. Also, “Four mills called Darleigh Mills or Darwent Mills”, presumably at Darley Abbey.\n\nIn 1654 and 1656, a yeoman lead miner born about 1584 in Cromford Derbyshire, Thomas Goodbeheare bought Darley Abbey in several lots purchased. He was hands on in his lead mine and actively supported miners rights and opposed Barmaster’s duties that were payable on all lead ore mined. He was accused of cheating by using a none-standard measuring dish for lead ore.\n\nFIG 09: Extract Lead Miners’ Heyday: The Great Days of Mining in “Worksworth”\n\nand the Low Peak of Derbyshire By Ron Slack.\n\nGodbeheare made his last will and testament on 29 June, 1658 in good health but his age was 74 years. He mentioned in his will that upon his death, his lands and property in Darley Abbey may be seized, so it likely that he made a will in order to delay any seizures of land and property. He named two daughters and his wife Margarette’s daughter as beneficiaries receiving an income from rents of tenements and farms and his wife was to receive a portion of rents and be permitted to remain in the East wing of his manor, “called by Mr. Jonas, Darley Hall”. There was also a row of three tenement cottages called “The Birches”.\n\nThe main beneficiaries named in the will, were two grandsons; Thomas Bowden and John Poyser.\n\nGoodbeheare married Ellen Summer in 1617 and Susana Alsop in 1619; both marriages were at Wirksworth, Derbyshire:\n\nFIG 10: Curtsey of Family Search.\n\nOn 26 June, 1617 he married Ellen Summer he would have been about 33 years of age.\n\nAfter he started buying lots in Darley Abbey, in 1654, he married a widow, Margarette Hopkinson of “Worksworth” (Wirksworth) at Allestree St. Edmunds Church.\n\nFIG 11: Marriage Records of Thomas Goodbeheare & Margarette Hopkinson 26 June, 1654 at St. Edmund’s Church Allestree, Derby Courtesy of Family Search and Phillimore Marriage Registers 1531 – 1913.\n\nHere are some points I summarized from the 1658 will of Thomas Goodbeheare:\n\n2 grandsons, Thomas Bowden and John Poyser were immediate and main beneficiary’s after the death of Thomas’ wife Margarette\n\nIf grandsons had issues, the 2 granddaughters, Penelope & Anne Poyser would be his main beneficiaries\n\n8 horses owned (nose and hoofs) and lead mines (in Worksworth & Cromford)?\n\nThomas said upon his death some property may be seized to pay debts\n\nHe owned many Pinto horses (with large white patches) and mentioned assigning 100 of the ponies – used in lead mines? And leaden parts to be used to pay his debtors with rents from houses and parcels of land\n\nMill inlets streams and banks belonging to 2 Darley mills known as “Darley Maltte Milles,” and “Darley Corne Milles”, provision made requiring beneficiary(s) to keep and maintain them\n\nThomas Godbeheare’s birthplace was Cromford, Derbyshire and in his will he made provisions to pay poor townspeople 20 shillings annually on the feast day of St. Thomas\n\nCanal and river routs are mentioned in Derby & Cromford to Hull, presumably used for moving, mined lead, Malt and Corn from his Darley Mills\n\nHe left 20 shillings to his good friend Mrs. Allestry (wife of Roger Allestry) and *70 shillings to one daughter of Mrs. Allestry named Fornity?\n\nAccording to his will, Goodbeheare owned two mills in Darley Abbey known as “Darley Malt Mills & Darley Corne Milles”. This is the first record I have seen in Darley Abbey of a Malt mill. The process is usually different for crushing sweet barley grains to the process of grinding corn into flour. I think it is likely that Goodbeheare had a Maltster attached to his malt mill. The process of making malt includes dampening the malted barley grains, turning the grains with a spade in a warm room to encourage sweet shoots to grow inside the whole barley grains. The sweet grains are then kilned, lightly for light colour ales and dark roasted for porters and stouts.\n\nHowever, there is no record of making malt in the 1654 will, so it is my conjecture that Godbehere made malted barley grains, rather than just owning a malt mill to crush them.\n\nThomas Goodbeheare, didn’t succeed in leaving his estate to his family as he intended in his will, although it is possible his wife Margarette lived out her days in the East wing of Darley Hall. I think this because:\n\nFIG 12: Extract Record held by The National Archives.\n\n” In 1665 a Thomas Goodbehere, yeoman, aged 84, of Wirksworth was one of several inhabitants who brought an action at the common land v. Armyn for the rights of common on Cromford moor in the names of 2 poor men.”\n\nThere were other yeomen, probably related in Wirksworth and Cromford, with the same name, Thomas Godbeheare, so I am not certain when he died. There is a death record of Thomas Godbeheare of Wirksworth in 1669. I think it’s likely that his estate in Darley Abbey was either sold off or seized before his death. Darley Abbey was sold to the Allestry family in lots in 1672 and 1675. The Allesty’s were friends of Thomas Godbeheare. Another lead merchant, Obadiah Hodgkinson, sold Darley Abbey William Wooley Esquire in 1709. Wooley rebuilt Darley Hall in 1727.\n\nFIG: 13: Magna Britannia; Being a concise topographical account of the several\n\nCounties of Great Britain By Daniel Lysons, 1762-1834 Samuel Lysons, 1763-1819\n\nOther mills in Darley include a paper mill on the bank of “Dean’s Field” a leather mill, a red lead mill, a flint crushing mill used in porcelain and a Fulling mill for washing and dyeing cloth.

Our February Meeting may therefore be the last to which these restrictions apply. We will also be guided by DACA/DCC policy on the Village Hall. Watch the web-site for further details, but see our current Covid Statement at the end.\n\n18 FEBRUARY 2022 – Our proposed Speaker for this meeting is indisposed and cannot attend. At very short-notice, David Skillen has agreed to bring forward his talk, scheduled for July, about “The Many Behind The Few” at 7.30pm, for which we thank him.\n\nWe hope to fit in the talk “Derby River Boat to Darley Abbey” by Jon Millhouse later in the year. The Events and Programme of Talks for 2022 is, as always, on our website.\n\nOur Talks Programme, arranged by Marie, for the near future is :-\n\n18 MARCH 2022 – ‘The History of Clowning’, with Jean and Clive\n\n15 APRIL – ‘The Contest of Sophistry over Truth’ by Jane Whittaker.\n\nEvents\n\nWe would like to think that some Events will take place in 2022, as the CoronaVirus pandemic fades.

However the Newsletter circulation is relatively small and not everyone searches for DAHG on the Net. Most months our hit rate is around 200, so not huge, We have decided to remedy this situation and offer to the general public selections of the memories you read each month, in the form of our standard Booklet 40 – 50 pages in length. These we will sell at the current Booklet price of £2.50 each (plus p & p, if required).\n\nAs you know all Booklets can be purchased from Sarah’s Village Shop and via the website.\n\nThe two new Booklets titled, “Darley Memories by Darley People”, Part 1 and Part 2 are selling well. Two further Memories Booklets have been compiled by Tony and are ready for printing.\n\nWe hope you will support this new venture as it adds ££ to our coffers. Please tell your friends and neighbours and anyone else who has an interest in our historic village so full of memories. If you have something interesting to share, write an article for us. It’s quite therapeutic too, in these difficult times.\n\nThis month’s “Memories” is a fascinating article by Andrew Thurman about “Football in Darley Abbey” :-\n\nDARLEY ABBEY FOOTBALL TEAMS\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn the 1960s, Dean’s Field, was used for football games by St. Matthew’s C of E School and once a week, Mr. Wake, the headmaster, led two teams of boys from the school to Dean’s Field, formally the site of the paper mill that was demolished after a fire in the 1930s. Dean’s Field as it became known was named after a parks head gardener who lived in the detached house on the site.\n\nFIG 01: The Paper Mill. (Courtesy of Peter Nelson)\n\nFIG 02: Darley Abbey C of E Schoolboys 1948.\n\nThe older boys in the above photo are 13 & 14 years of age from a time before secondary schools were available after age 11 years. Mr. Wake is on our left on the back row.\n\nThe photo in FIG 02 doesn’t look like Dean’s Field due to the uneven surface and “Deanies” field, as it was called by kids, was perfectly level and ideal for football.\n\nIn my time at the school, it didn’t often use the field for more than a couple of hours a week, so from the age of 7 or 8 years I used to meet with other boys in Darley Abbey village and play football on “Deanies”. We played there almost every weekend and in summertime, in the evenings as well. It wasn’t just the young kids like me, older boys and young men from Darley village met informally on “Deanies” and spontaneously split into two evenly balanced teams of roughly equal ability and ages. These games went on for hours at a time and there wasn’t usually any rigid tally of keeping a score; it was just the enjoyment of playing and the fellowship enjoyed at the meetups.\n\nABBEY ATHLETIC FC:\n\nAbbey Athletic formed about 1965 when many of its players were just 16 years old and these lads were mostly 4 – 5 older than me and I’d played with many of them on Dean’s Field before they formed a club. Their first season was in the Sunday League in the bottom division at the end of 1965-66 seasons they finished 7th in that division as they usually came up against older and more experienced teams who’d been playing a few seasons already.\n\nFIG 03: Abbey Athletic FC Sunday League Season 1966-1967\n\nCourtesy of Keith & Dot Midgley.\n\nThis was Abbey Athletics’ original line-up in their second season in the Derby, Sunday League. The shirts were green with yellow sleeves and neck trimmings and white shorts.\n\nHome games were played, in the early days on Darley Playing Fields and later seasons at Rykneld Recreation Ground.\n\nFormer Abbey Athletic player, Paul Windle recently recalled a game they played away against Ilkeston Tiltion, from a higher division. Abbey’s opponents were formidable, which is not surprising, as they had 2 or 3 Derby County players and the score, Paul preferred not to recall, was “probably in double figures.”\n\nAnother, less traumatic recollection comes from another former player, Brian Bacon when Abbey Athletic, played the New Inn, Heanor team, known. The New Inn side was a great team and at top of their division in the league, so Abbey Athletic had low expectations for a good outcome in that match. Many of them, if not all the team, attended an all-night party before the match and turned up for the game straight from the party as it wasn’t worth going to bed and expecting the match would be a lost cause for them. Surprisingly, Abbey Athletic won convincingly, but Brian didn’t mention if the Heanor players were also at the party?\n\nAndy Gibson and Derek Collins were players who kick-started Abbey Athletic, forming as a Sunday League team and they were also active in organizing fixtures and social events and getting the football kit in Abbey’s colours made to order.\n\nAndy recalled that:\n\n“All those players (in photo in FIG 03) are still alive apart from Derek Collins & Johnny Dodgson. Most of the players lived in Darley Abbey. I think our home games were played on Darley Fields but later we had a few seasons at Rykneld Recreation Ground.\n\nAfter every game, most of us met up on the Sunday evening at the Broadway Hotel. Walter, (aka) “Wally” Bates was landlord from 1961 – 69. In the sixties, the Broadway had a lounge & a bar plus an off license & we frequented the bar, always monopolising the same table/tables. Later in the years 1971 – 88 Norman and Brenda Graves were the landlords.\n\nWe started to organise social do’s & if we were honest, the football became secondary & the meeting up socially became the main event & that’s where the friendships were born lasting well over 55 years. Obviously, players came & went but many of the original line up still meet up from time to time.” (See FIG 04):\n\nAs well associalmeetups at the Broadway Hotel and the subsequent “lads’ reunions” were held at Derby Rugby Club, Derby Rowing Club and the Friary Hotel, Derby.\n\nFIG 04: Abbey Athletic reunion >10 years ago. Courtesy Keith & Dot Midgley\n\n.\n\nAbbey Athletic FC, were probably the first Darley Abbey team to play in a league since before WW2, as I found no records of a Darley Abbey team in the 1950’s. There is a strong tradition of football teams in Darley Abbey, dating back to at least the 1880s, when Darley Abbey FC had a formidable reputation.\n\nNo doubt, Qualcast probably had a football team playing on Haslams Lane in the 1950s, but I am thinking of teams of Darley lads, meeting informally and then coming together and playing league football.\n\nThe Glory Years:\n\nThe 1880s and 1890s were glory years for Darley Abbey FC and fifty years later, journalists lamented that they were one of the best teams in Derby Midland League, three players went onto greater things with Derby Midland League and then with Derby County. They were Ernest Hickinbottom, Jack Flowers and “Kid” (Lewis) Cooper (see FIG 05).\n\nFIG 05: Three players progressed and went on to to play for Derby County FC\n\n(Courtesy Derby Daily Telegraph and Wikipedia)\n\nIn the 1880s and 1890s the players in the Midland League and those in higher leagues including Derby County, did not pay salaries and players expenses. So, Ernest Hickinbottom, didn’t give up his job as a “riveter” at Derby Carriage and Wagon Works (seen in 1901 Census).\n\nFig 6 Below . This Derby Telegraph Article lists the names of the 1887 Darley Abbey Football FC.\n\nTwo Former Darley Abbey F C Players Jack Flowers and Ernest Hickenbottom played for Derby Midland FC 1888-89 are in this photo (Derbyshire Life.\n\nJack Flowers, Ernest Cooper (both pictured) and “Kid” Cooper (not in the above photo) went on to play for Derby County FC and I’ve seen their names listed in the Derby County lists of players year by year in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Their names fall away after the legendary Steve Bloomer joined and became Derby’s most prolific goal scorer\n\nFIG 09: Darley Abbey FC 1922.\n\nIt’s probably fair to say that no Darley Abbey team, before or since the one including three future Derby County players has achieved the awesome reputation that they earned, albeit I surmise, they probably all enjoyed some level of fulfilment when representing their village club.\n\nHowever, Lewis “Kid Cooper” was photographed with his Derby County teammates in County’s second season, 1889 – 1890. See FIG 10 below, Cooper is on the front row, second from our right:\n\nFIG 10: Courtesy “Memory Lane – in association with the Telegraph\n\n(No copyright infringement intended).\n\n:\n\nIn wartime the local amateur football teams disbanded, due to menfolk going away to fight.\n\nWhen I posted this photo on Allestree Village History Facebook group, Mart Layton commented:\n\n“William ‘Bill’ Allsopp was my maternal great-grandfather’s brother. He lived in Mile Ash Lane, Darley Abbey. Not sure if the other Allsop is related, despite the different spelling of his surname.”\n\nIn 1922 there was a first and a second team; F. Sadler (pictured), club secretary, touted for games in local newspaper “Miscellaneous Wants” adverts. In 1924, J. Hackman (pictured) became secretary.\n\nMart Leyton also posted a photo of Allestree FC in 1924 (see Fig 11), saying:\n\n“My grandfather Bill Allsopp also played for Allestree FC, and they originally played in the Sunday School League, Division 1, on condition that all players played for Allestree Methodist chapel. Mart commented that perhaps this wasn’t strictly enforced as the Allsopp’s were all Catholics!\n\n“However, chapel officials Corny Smith and Tom Nelson were part of the team. When Alllestree FC left the Sunday School League to join the newly formed Derby and District Armature League in 1922, Corny Smith refused to play with them.”\n\nFIG 11:\n\nAllestree FC in 1924 (Courtesy Mart Layton), Allestree Village History Facebook Group and the Derby Trader, April 20, 1983.\n\nFIG 12: Darley Abbey FC 1927 (Courtesy David Smith,\n\nDerby Past and Present, Facebook Group)\n\nDavid commented on his photo:\n\n“Darley Abbey FC 1927. I thought perhaps some names might be of interest, Sam Dickenson was the uncle of my wife lived 1 Mile Ash Lane.”\n\nAuthors Note: A childhood playmate, Dennis Dickenson, lived with his parents Oswald and Beattie and a sister at 1 Mile ash Lane (later changing to number 5). Sam Dickenson was Dennis’ uncle.\n\nWW2 Servicemen Killed & Missing in Action:\n\nHow well Darley Abbey FC played in the 1920s and 1930 is not known to me, but I can surmise the players at least enjoyed the fellowship and joy of playing for the village team, as was described to me by the Abbey Athletic FC players, when they played in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nI found nothing in the way of fixtures for Darley Abbey FC in the late 1920s and 1930s in any newspaper reports.\n\nPress reports I found were for fallen or captured WW2 servicemen, who’d played for Darley Abbey FC, presumably in the 20s and 30s. See FIGS 13 and 14.\n\n(Two articles, courtesy Derby Daily Telegraph).\n\nFIG 13: Private WH Brown\n\n“Missing or captured”\n\nFIG 14: Aircraftman Carrington former Darley mill accountant and Darley Abbey FC player.\n\nPrivate W.H.

This variant has been spreading fast and clearly can affect jabbed and boosted persons; but its effects seem to be milder and, thankfully, the rate of infection is reducing. We therefore intend to go ahead with our next meeting. Please see our Covid Statement towards the end of this newsletter.\n\nMeetings\n\nOn the 21st of January we hold our AGM followed by Marie Gibson’s talk on, “Educating Darley”.\n\nAt the AGM we will be reporting progress for the year 2021 and electing our Committee.\n\nVice-Chairman Tony Lintott is standing down in Jan. and we will need several new Committee members to fill his various roles. Many thanks to Tony for his activities for the Group over the past 7 years – as Vice-chair; as Web-site creator and supervisor; as Booklet editor; as Darley researcher; as Heritage-Funding organiser; as Newsletter Editor etc, etc. He will no doubt continue to assist in these roles, but new people are needed to take on these tasks, or the Group will struggle.\n\nPlease give serious thought to putting your name forward for the Committee at the meeting.\n\nEND OF JANUARY UPDATE – The new Committee can be found under the “About us” website tab.\n\nOn the 18th of February we will hear all about, “The Derby to Darley River Boat” from Jon Millhouse, Director – Chartered Town Planner at Planning Design, Derby.\n\nOn the 18th of February, Jean and Clive will talk about, ‘The History of Clowning’.\n\nThe Events and Programme of Talks for 2022 is, as always, on our website.\n\nOther Events\n\nWe would like to think that some Events will take place in 2022, as the Corona Virus pandemic fades. The Open Day/Flower/Book Fayre has been pencilled in for 16th April, and we would like to resurrect our project to explore the hole in the Village Hall lawn for finds and to make it safe. Other projects might include designing Information Boards for the Tilley Fire-Engine Display in the Mill, and archaeological surveys of the Monastic Gatehouse at The Slade or the Roman Bridge piers in Darley Park. Darley Abbey Scouts Archaeology Team have offered assistance in such projects.\n\nBooklets\n\nOur Booklets are selling well, and we appreciate the receipts coming into our account. Our Treasurer will be speaking to our Certified Accounts at the AGM, and it will be interesting to hear about the ‘booklet effect’.\n\nThe completion of booklet #8, The Worker’s Cottages, is still pending a few more photographs of historic cottage interiors. We would really appreciate cottage owners sending us some interesting photographs, particularly of original features. Please be assured that any photographs shown will not be linked to an address, i.e., anonymous. Send to our email address please. Two more “Memories” booklets are approaching the print stage.\n\n“Memories”\n\nThis month’s “Memories” features someone who is relatively unknown but who, along with his sons, was fundamental to the development of the Mill after the long period of Evans family involvement. It also signaled the end of the feudalism apparent from the 18thC.\n\nOnce again, we are grateful to Andrew Thurman for his research and creating another fascinating memory about Darley and the Mill.\n\nIf you have something interesting to share, write an article for us. It’s quite cathartic too, particularly in these difficult times. Please tell your friends and neighbours and anyone else who has an interest in our historic village so full of memories to put pen to paper.\n\nHere is this month’s “Memories” …….\n\nThe Beginning of the End of Feudalism in Darley?\n\n& The John Peacock Era at Darley Mill\n\nWalter Evans, born in 1826, married Susan Gisborne in 1854. Their only son, Arthur, born in 1855, died in 1870, aged 15 years. Susan died in 1891. After the death of Susan, Walter married Ada Roscow and although she was 35 years younger than Walter, they had no children and the Evans line came to an end when Ada died in November 1929.\n\nFIG 01 – THE EVANS FAMILY TREE (courtesy of Peter Nelson):\n\nSir William Evans of Allestree Hall married Mary Gisborne (sister of Susan) in 1846. They also had no heirs to their extensive estates, including Allestree Hall, and it passed into the Gisborne family. The Gisborne’s sold Allestree Hall and the estate in 1913 to Captain Herbert Johnson, a wealthy wire manufacturer.\n\nIn 1920, the Derby Daily Telegraph lamented, “The Passing of Feudalism in Allestree”. The author is unknown to me, and it could have been written by a former Allestree councilor and local history buff, John T. Ward.\n\nFIG 02 – Derby Daily Telegraph Wednesday 15 December 1920.\n\n“The Passing of Feudalism”\n\n(Transcript and short extract only due to condition of the original file)\n\nThere was a time not so very remote when one even by the wildest stretch of imagination could hardly have pictured Allestree as utterly divorced from feudalism even in its most benevolent and acceptable form.\n\nMore than a generation ago when Mr. Thomas William Evans received the honour of a baronetcy and returned home to Allestree an ovation from all classes of his neighbours, the man had ventured to predict that within forty years the Hall would have passed into other hands and the farms, and the village disposed of to the tenants and occupiers would have been derided as a madman. Yet today that is the transformation that is in actual progress in this pleasant Derbyshire village.\n\nFeudalism for good or for ill is passing so far as Allestree is concerned and will soon be a thing of the past. Yet the ancient system had a pretty good innings, and though the village has not grown under it has in the main tended to the happiness and prosperity of its people.\n\nIn the last century, when under the Evans regime Allestree may be said to have attained its highest pitch of contentment, there were plenty worse things that could have happened to one than to have been an inhabitant of the village, which, while preserving its rusticity, was in pleasant touch with the fuller life of the County town. The ancient name of the place was Adelardestre – ‘Æðelheard’s tree’; and it was one of 15 manors which after the Norman Conquest passed into the hands of Henry de Ferrers.\n\nThe Munday family appeared on the scene in 1516 when the place was acquired by John Mundy, who in 1522, became Lord Mayor of London. The Manor House at Allestree, which was occupied by a branch of the Munday family, was situated near the site of the farm, now known as “The Mulberries,” for long occupied by the well-known family of Tomlinson. The stricken remains of the old Mulberry Tree may still be observed in the orchard adjoining the house.\n\nThe Munday of Allestree played their part in the public life of Derbyshire, in those days, Gilbert Munday being High Sheriff of the County in 1697. There is a curious circumstance in connection with the third son of Gilbert Munday, who in a mural tablet in the old church is described as “Of this town”. “Why the term town is used in such a connection is not easy to divine, as Allestree was probably no bigger than in the later years of the Eighteenth Century, when Pilkington described it as containing about twenty-one houses. Either Pilkington was not quite accurate, or Allestree must have had an extensive housing programme in hand in as much as some thirty years later Glover spoke of it containing 70 families and 361 inhabitants. Thirty-eight of the latter were described as in trade, “chiefly cotton spinning.” A considerable portion of the estate was sold by Mr. F.N.C.Munday, a well-known magistrate and poet, whose bust by Chantrey, is to be seen in our County Hall today—to Mr. Thomas Evans and Mr. Charles Upton, of Derby and Mr. Bache Thornhill of Stanton-in-the-Peak. Mr. Thornhill afterwards purchased Mr. Upton’s portion of the property and built a handsome modern mansion on the estate. These old mansion-builders selected many choice sites in Derbyshire wherein to make their homes, but none chose better than Mr. Thornhill.\n\nAllestree Hall as it stands today, enjoys a situation second to none in the County. Although the Evans family had acquired territorial interests in the parish, they made no sign of more closely cementing their association with Allestree for some years. In 1805 they were content to see Mr. Thornhill dispose of the Hall to Mr. Girardot, an East Indian Nabob, who kept up much display, and brought black men (sic) from the East to act as footmen and out-riders.\n\nNot until 1824 did the Evans family give determination to settle at Allestree, the Hall in that year being purchased by Mr. William Evans, the famous cotton spinner and Liberal politician, and father of Thomas William Evans and other sons scarcely less well known in Derbyshire’s public life during the Victorian era. Mr. William Evans was a famous political fighter, even in the days when Great Whigs like the Cavendishes, Strutts and Mr. Michael Thomas Bass did not hesitate to spend fortunes to furtherance their political ideals. He fought a famous election at Leicester, which was reported to have cost him £20,000, but it was only an incident of a life that was given over to strenuous campaigns on behalf of Reform, Free Trade and the more advanced planks of the Whig programmes. Member for Leicester, North Derbyshire and later for Retford, he took a prominent part in the County’s affairs, serving the office of High Sheriff and ever giving evidence of his devotion to public affairs and philanthropic causes. He it was who effected such improvements at Allestree Hall as made it one of the most comfortable mansions in Derbyshire as well as one of the most attractive to the eye. His wife was a daughter of Mr. Thomas Gisborne of Yoxall Lodge, and the alliance between the two families was further cemented when their son Mr. Thomas William, married the daughter of Thomas John Gisborne, of Holme Hall, Bakewell. The marriage, it is of interest to note, took place in 1846 at Corfu, where the ex-Kaiser established his Mediterranean home. Mr. Thos. William Evans, though for the greater part of his political life a moderate Liberal, had none of that innate distrust of Toryism which characterized the political faith of his father. Long before Mr. Gladstone introduced his Home Rule Bill, “T.W.” was still a merely nominal Whig.\n\nMr. George Curzon, at a rather hostile meeting at Darley Abbey, infuriated his Radical tormentors by blandly observing that the Squire of Allestree “was one of the best old Tories in Derbyshire.” Nor was the future Earl Curzon far wide of the mark. Those behind the scenes in South Derbyshire knew perfectly well that towards the close of his career of old undivided South Derbyshire Mr. Evans considered it an ideal arrangement to divide the representation with the Tory Party in the person of that popular Conservative, Sir Henry Wilmot. He was a Whig by consent, rather than by conviction. On the death of Sir William — old South Derbyshire campaigners continued to style him “Thomas William,” without titular prefix- — the Allestree estates passed to his kinsman, Mr. William Gisborne.\n\nMr. William Gisborne had had a distinguished career in New Zealand, where he had filled almost every position available to members of the Colonial Parliament. The gratitude of the people of New Zealand is attested by the fact that a town on the north coast, bears his name. His book “New Zealand: Its Rise and Progress,” was completed at Allestree Hall, and is held in high esteem as a standard work on the history of the Colony.\n\nDuring his residence at the Hall an event of unique interest occurred, this being this being the birth of a direct heir to the Allestree estate. Little was it thought that that in the rejoicings that followed the birth of Mr. Gisborne’s little grandson—now twenty-five years of age—that the estate would pass into other hands long before his accession to it could have become possible Mr. William Gisborne has been dead more than twenty years. His son Mr. Lionel Gisborne, after residing at the Hall a few years, in 1902 let it to Mr. H.H. Raphael, later Sir Herbert Raphael, how four years later became member for South Derbyshire, and revived the old Liberal traditions of the place vacated possession on the sale of the Hall to Colonel Johnson, but he is remembered in Allestree not merely by the Village Institute which he presented, but by a series of smaller gifts and pleasant happenings which endeared his wife and himself to the great majority of the inhabitants.\n\nExcept the old church of St. Edmund with its Saxon porch, very little is remains of ancient Allestree. There is a legend that Dorothy Vernon on the occasion of her elopement with John Manners, stayed the night at the old inn, but whether at the old inn, which formally stood at the entrance to the Park Gates, or elsewhere is not known. The churchyard itself contains a yew tree which is thought to be as old as the Church, which at once attracts the interest of the visitor. Between the Church and Duffield Road there is a formal row of poplar trees which, standing on such high ground, were a familiar landmark for miles. They were known as the Twelve Apostles — we are not quite sure whether there were not thirteen, and one had to be cut down in the early part of the present century.\n\nJust beyond the Wesleyan Chapel — the Methodist movement is past the point of celebrating its centenary in the village. It is also soon to be sold as the Chapel has ceased to exist. Near the park gates is another curious object that attracts the attention of passers-by. A curious archway formed of whale’s jawbones, which were originally placed in position by Mr. Moses Harvey. That would almost be in the days when Mr. J.C. Girardot and his coloured servants reigned at the Hall.\n\nJ.C. Girardot with Black Coachmen and Livery—He held Allestree Hall from 1805 to 1824\n\nClearly Darley Abbey’s history is entwined with Allestree’s.\n\nI now take the definition of feudalism and the end of the Derby Daily Telegraph, Allestree article, which I follow for Darley Abbey to be a little different.\n\nIn the case of the Evans family, their brand of feudalism entailed providing employment and housing with other benefits. An example of this was a milking cow to each family, seen in Derby Mercury advertisements in 1787. Some Darley villagers were still provided with land and a pigsty into the 20th century, albeit they had to buy their own piglets and pay for the feed. My great-grandfather, William Thurman, employed at Darley vicarage, kept piglets, and tended and reared piglets for the vicar.\n\nThe ownership of the mill passed to John Peacock in 1905, two years after the death of Walter Evans.\n\nThe death of Walter Evans in 1903 and his brother Sir William in 1902 was the beginning of the end of feudalism in Darley Abbey and Allestree and Walter’s second wife Ada, probably had no inclination or expectation of running Walter Evans & Company, cotton mill.\n\nFIG 03 – Extract of Darley Memories by my Great Uncle, Bill Thurman\n\n(“Up-Darley Down Darley” by Erica Perry.)\n\nFIG 04 – John Peacock, Derby Daily Telegraph Notices, following his death on 14 February 1930.\n\nAlso\n\nFIG 05 – John Peacock Portrait courtesy 1933 Booklet, “A Century and a Half of Progress.”\n\nJohn Peacock’s wife Mary passed away ten years before him in 1920 and until his death in 1930, he still took an active interest in the running of the mill.\n\nExtract from DAHG booklet #7, “THE EVANS BOARS HEAD COTTON MILL”\n\n– this booklet used additional material gleaned from English Heritage investigations.\n\nHere is a description of John Peacock and his sons as told by Darley Villager “Totty Palin” who had been active in the mill strike in 1917. She also took in evacuees during WW2.\n\n“In 1903 Walter Evans, a great-grandson of Thomas, died, and two years later the business was sold to the manager of some years’ standing, John Peacock (d. 1930), who had come from the Scottish textile-manufacturing town of Paisley. With his three sons, Capt. H. M. J. and A. D. Peacock, he converted the business into a limited company ‘and made extensive alterations to accommodate the latest machinery’. No significant additions to the building stock accompanied these changes and for the final seventy years of cotton manufacture changes were largely confined to repairs.”\n\nA 1932 company booklet seems to contradict this statement and cites many examples and instances of product innovation and upgrading of the plant and machinery.\n\nJohn Peacock knew the business of managing operations, materials and people and as the owner he had to find out about sales merchandising, product development and innovation. Later he brought his three sons into the business and although he retired several years before his death in 1930, he continued to take an interest and was a mentor to his sons, who took over as joint managing directors of the business.”\n\nFIG 06 – From 1933 Booklet, “A Century and a Half of Progress”\n\nThe opening words of the booklet remind me of a modern company mission statement and the sons of John Peacock were mindful not only of tradition, but also the need to be innovators and to have foresight. It goes on to say that “Since the death of their father, the mills have been owned by Captain H.M. Peacock, Mr. John Peacock and Mr. Archibald D. Peacock, who are working Directors controlling different sections of the business. They have a practical knowledge of every process carried out in the Mills and have devoted their time and energies to developing the products of Darley Mills, branded with the “Boars Head” trademark, so these are admitted to be second to none in the textile world.\n\nThe Directors are in personal touch with the workers and know the intricacies of their work. Loyalty and good feeling are evident everywhere at Darley and the satisfactory state of affairs is recognised to be an important factor in the business, for it also means loyalty to the interests of customers and a keenness to give them satisfaction. That the workers appreciate the treatment they receive is shown by the fact that generations of the same families have worked in the Mills, and many of the same names on the timesheet today appeared on those of a century and a half ago, thus bringing\n\nwith them the added advantage of inherited skill.\n\nThe utopian description of a loyal and skilled workforce probably didn’t apply during the Mill Strike of 1917, when management and office staff had to keep production flowing, whilst the workers paraded around Darley village, banging pots and pans. This came about when wages didn’t keep up with WW1 inflation and it caused hardship to many workers in the country. Also, young Johnny Peacock upset some female strikers who were picketing near to Tresillian, the Peacocks home (now the Broadway Hotel and pub) on Duffield Road.\n\nFIG 07 – From 1933 Booklet, “A Century and a Half of Progress”, the Sons of John Peacock.\n\nFIG 08 – PLANT & MACHINERY.\n\nBy 1933, the original water wheels for powering the heavy machinery, was replaced by five up- to-date turbines which obtained power from the River Derwent. These were supplemented by steam and gas engines, as well as one powered by electricity. The firm generated its own electricity and own “turnery” department to make some wooden reels and bobbins.\n\nResearch and Development, Processes and New Products:\n\nFIG 09 – Extracts from 1933 Booklet “A Century and a Half of Progress”\n\nThe plant had a Research Department and there is a photo here of a testing laboratory.\n\nNew product developed at the mill during the Peacock’s time included high strength sewing thread used for all manner of stitching clothing, also thicker cotton yarn for crochet and knitting and many patents were taken out during the ownership of Walter Evans and the Peacock’s in the twentieth century.\n\nDuring the tenure of the Peacock’s, silk threads were researched and developed and sold by their agents.\n\nFIG 10 – Extract from 1933 Booklet, “A Century and a Half of Progress”\n\nFIG 11 – Extract from 1933 Booklet, “A Century and a Half of Progress”.\n\nAgents for Walter Evans Mill in 1933.\n\nSOME LONG SERVICE EMPLOYEES AT WALTER EVANS MILL.\n\nFIG 12 – Extract from a 1933 Booklet, “A Century and a Half of Progress” mentioning Employees with Long Service.\n\nThe tradition of long service continued and later in 1946 Arthur Nelson Senior a department manager, finally retired after 63 years’ service.\n\nFIG 13 Retirement Presentation at the Mill in September 1946, Courtesy of Peter Nelson:\n\nThe Final Years of the Mill\n\nFIG 14 – Extract from DAHG booklet #7, “The Evans Boars Head Cotton Mill”\n\n“Negotiations for the sale of the mill began in 1941, and in the following year a controlling interest in the company was acquired by Kerr & Co. Ltd of Glasgow. However, it was not until 1943 that the sale of the mills to J. and P. Coats Ltd of Paisley, later part of the Coats Viyella Group, was concluded, the operating name of Walter Evans & Co. Ltd being retained. At this date the bobbin shop was still in production, and there was a research department and dyeing rooms. Doubling continued (probably in East and Middle Mills) until at least 1952, when a newspaper article noted that many machines at the mills were idle owing to a recession in the cotton trade. In 1968 or 1969 a flood-prevention scheme led to the decommissioning of the five turbines in favour of a conventional AC supply. Acceptance of such a move was probably also an indication of declining production, now confined to finishing processes. In the following year East and Middle Mills were sold to Patterns [Derby] Ltd, and in 1970 finishing processes were relocated to Lancashire and merchandising to Leicestershire, bringing to a close almost 190 years of continuous textile production.”\n\nAndrew Thurman – January 2022\n\nReferences relevant to this article:\n\nDerby Mercury\n\nDerby Daily Telegraph\n\nPeter Nelson’s files.

Please tell your friends, neighbours and anyone else who has an interest in our historic village so full of memories.\n\nThis month’s “Memories” is the last of 2021. Written by member Julie Barlow it is about a Darleian who is famous pretty much everywhere except in Darley Abbey. A fascinating read, as we hope all of our “Memories” features have been this year.\n\nThe John Stobart Story by Julie Barlow\n\nA young, aspiring artist from Darley Abbey becomes a world-famous American Marine Artist. It was a long journey. He went to live in America in 1965, but the journey began in Darley Abbey.\n\nHe was born in Leicester in 1929, but tragically his mother died in childbirth. He already had George as an elder brother, born 1927. He was ill for the first year. His father Lancelot was born in 1890 and lived in extreme poverty with his mother in Newcastle. She worked hard to support them and Lancelot also took on work. He was determined to improve his situation and studied pharmacy at night. He passed his exams and joined the company of Boots and took up a post in Leicester. In 1930 he was offered the post of manager and pharmacist at Boots in Derby. It was where Costa Coffee bar is now at the corner of East Street and St. Peters Street. He accepted because he wanted to get away from his unhappy memories in Leicester. It was a large store on four floors, with general goods, a library, a café, a restaurant and pharmacy. He was always well-dressed with bowler hat, spats, a suit and umbrella. He was a stickler for the use of correct grammar and strict with the boys. Silence was maintained whilst the radio was on during World War II. He worked hard and became a capable businessman.\n\nThey came to live in Darley Abbey at No. 17 Darley Park Rd. and later at No. 24 Church Lane. John attended Darley Village school, where he became a friend of my brother Peter. His father employed various housekeepers over the years. One had retired and went to live at Weston Underwood. Peter and John often cycled over to see her. George was academically gifted, but John struggled at school. Geography and Art were the two subjects that interested him. Geography because it inspired his curiosity to see the world and travel. Art because he had a natural ability, possibly from his mother. He always said that it may be a gift, but motivation and encouragement from good teachers was also needed. He was always doodling. George went to Derby Grammar School in 1937, where St. Helen’s House was the site of the school. In 1939 with the outbreak of WWII, the boys were sent out of Derby to Amber Valley Camp. John joined George there for his secondary education in 1939. My brother Peter went to Bemrose Grammar School.\n\nMy father had been in Belgium and France during WWI and felt it was important to keep the family together. John’s secondary education was different from Peter’s, because he was away from home. Mr. Bradley was an excellent headmaster who was loved and respected. Many pupils kept in touch with him until his death in the nineties. John learned to be self-sufficient, self-disciplined, punctual, well-mannered and able to mix and make friends. It was all very character-forming. They all had a plot of land to garden. He showed his father’s entrepreneurial skills in selling his produce. Mr. Bradley always took an interest in each boy, even if they were not academically gifted. John thrived.\n\nDuring holidays like many boys at that time, he bought lots of model aeroplanes to assemble. It required patience to complete the task, concentration and attention to detail. They were made out of balsa wood. His favourite was the Spitfire. He learnt by trial and error.\n\nHe loved the Derbyshire countryside with its dales, hills, streams and rivers. He always said that he disliked artists who took photographs and then painted the scene in the home or study. – they lost the atmosphere.\n\nIn 1937 he travelled to Liverpool by train under the watchful eye of the guard to visit his maternal grandmother, aunts and uncles. They spoilt him and he very much felt part of a family. He went by tram to see the River Mersey. He was amazed at the sight of the Docks, all the different ships including liners, ferries, barges, freighters, and tankers and tugs. It was so different from the Derbyshire countryside. He wondered where they had come from and where they were going. He made sketches outdoors at the scene.\n\nHe failed his school certificate at sixteen. His father was frustrated. He knew that Art was the only subject that appealed to John. He knew Frank Hounsell, the Principal of The School of Art & Design in Green Lane. He approached him and John was accepted as a pupil.\n\nAlfred Bladen was an excellent teacher. John liked the relaxed atmosphere. He thrived in the four years he attended. He studied anatomy, still life, portraits, life drawing, perspective, the history of art and architecture.\n\nThey had visits to Derby Art Gallery and Museum and Birmingham Art Gallery to see major exhibitions of famous artists.\n\nConstable re-awakened his love of the countryside and landscape painting.\n\nJoseph Wright taught him the effect of light and shade and especially moonlight.\n\nMr. Bladen taught him to paint on-site and not from a photograph, which John already admired. It taught him to develop his own style. He gained permission to paint Kedleston Hall and Viscount Scarsdale spoke to him. He admired the painting and purchased it later, where it was displayed in the South Wing.\n\nHis maths teacher taught him that if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing well. He made a canoe to sail on the River Derwent in Darley Park. His teacher told him to go into Derby and sketch a building, noting other buildings and their style of architecture He passed his Intermediate exam Alfred Bladen his art teacher suggested he try for entry to the Royal Academy of Arts in London. He chose his painting of Irongate, showing his knowledge of perspective and colour. He was one of nine chosen out of the whole of England. Derbyshire Education Committee granted him a State Scholarship, which gave him the money towards expenses. He spent the next five years at the Academy.\n\nHe visited the Wallace Collection, the V&A and other places of interest. The River Thames fascinated him. It reminded him of the River Mersey. He made many sketches. He visited the Cutty Sark and was enthralled with the sails and rigging. He completed his National Service between 1953 – 55. He ended up on the Dorset coast. This was Constable country and it re-awakened his love of landscape painting. He made many sketches.\n\nThere were several art galleries around the college and he visited them, hoping to sell his paintings. Mr. J. A. Tooth owned one gallery and borrowed paintings. John returned one day and was introduced to Mr. John Meadows Q.C. from Toronto. He bought a painting and gave John his card. Other galleries were not interested. They preferred dealing with ex-public school-boys and university-educated people. They bought from auction houses for their regular clients. It was really a closed shop.\n\nHis father had re-married and emigrated to Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia, where he bought a pharmacy.\n\nIn 1955 he invited John to stay and sent a ticket for him to travel by sea to Cape Town and then by train to Bulawayo, and home by sea from the east coast. He made sketches. He sailed out by ‘Union Castle’ and home by ‘Durban Castle’. He felt he had seen some of the places he had seen the ships leaving from London and Liverpool would visit.\n\nIn 1953 he had permission to paint the Review of the Fleet on The Solent for the Coronation. He visited the offices of Union Castle in Leadenhall Street, London. He asked if he could have a copy of the plans for the yet to be launched ‘Braemar Castle’.\n\nThey agreed.\n\nHe carefully painted the water in the foreground and was careful with the proportion and detail of the ship. The Directors bought it for their boardroom. He visited one of his uncles in Liverpool, where he saw ‘SS Aureol’ of The Dempster Line. He painted it and sold it to the senior Dempster for their London office. He produced one painting each year for the next twelve years.\n\nOther shipping lines became interested and commissioned paintings. He was becoming interested in painting ships in port, instead of just at sea, like so many other artists.\n\nIn 1957 he decided to go to Canada to take up the offer of Mr. Marsh Q.C. He stayed near him and visited the Maritime Museum of Upper Canada. He met Alan Howard the curator – he had a vast knowledge of rigging, sails and clipper ships.\n\nHe told John he must go to New York as there was a bigger market. He travelled by overnight train and had four canvasses with him. There was another man in the compartment reading books. John got into conversation with him and showed him photographs of his paintings. He explained he had come from England to Canada and was on his way to New York. The man presented him with his card – he was Donald Holden editor of American Artist Magazine.\n\nHe gave John a list of galleries. John visited the Kennedy Gallery. The president was Rudi Wunderlich. He liked the four paintings and asked John to paint some more and he set up an exhibition of his work. John felt he had arrived. He was his own boss. He travelled back and forth to England to keep clients happy in England. In 1959 he married. They had two daughters and a son. They bought a house in Surrey. They moved permanently to New York in about 1970.\n\nJohn realised America was a great maritime country, especially in the colonial period of the early 19th. C. Internally boats travelled across America from east to west by rivers and canals. Sail depends on wind and was giving way to steam.; and steamships were getting bigger.\n\nThe days of the Clipper were gone.\n\nTankers were taking cargo; liners were being used for cruising and pleasure; aeroplanes were being used for Atlantic crossing and around the world. And photographs were replacing paintings. Having sketched ships on the Mersey and"
