        "text": "Business and political leaders are set to outline what they say is an overwhelming case for HS2 to be extended into the East Midlands. Despite the Levelling Up promises, the Government looks likely to scale back the Eastern leg of HS2 – potentially ending it at Parkway Station, near East Midlands Airport.\n\nSenior figures will be meeting up in Derby today for the publication of a report called “Full speed ahead: bringing high speed rail to the East Midlands”, setting out what they say would be the massive economic benefit of high-speed rail in the region.\n\nHS2 and Rail Minister Huw Merriman MP will make a keynote speech at the event – co-hosted by Midlands Connect and Transport for the East Midlands – and will be joined by industry leaders and senior politicians including Sir Peter Soulsby, Coun Ben Bradley MP, Amanda Solloway MP and Toby Perkins MP.\n\nThe organisers say the report outlines the benefits of bringing HS2 to the East Midlands and Sheffield as proposed in the Government’s Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands (IRP).\n\nThe say HS2 in the East Midlands, linked to other projects such as Midlands Rail Hub and Midland Main Line electrification, would bring cities and towns in the East Midlands closer to each other and to London and Birmingham.\n\nThey also say it would increase the number of people within a 90-minute rail journey of Derby by more than 500,000 and within 90 minutes of Chesterfield by 600,000 – boosting job opportunities and trade.\n\nThey say Nottingham, Derby and Chesterfield can currently access an economy of around £250 million within 90 mins by rail – with HS2 in place that would rise to more than £550 million.\n\nA spokesman said: “Analysis in the report shows that HS2 will nearly double the number of jobs in high value, rail-linked sectors within an hour of Nottingham by rail, and nearly quadruple the number of jobs within two hours.\n\n“In total, journeys from 74 stations across the East Midlands are set to benefit from improved journey times to and from London and Birmingham.\n\n“The quicker journey times resulting from HS2 will ‘shift’ the location of major urban areas closer to the East Midlands.\n\n“London will ‘move’ 60 miles north to Northamptonshire (relative to Derby, Chesterfield & Nottingham). Birmingham will ‘move’ 30 miles northeast to between Derby and Loughborough (relative to Nottingham) meaning residents can get the capital far quicker for work, business or leisure.”\n\nMidlands Connect chief executive Maria Machancoses said: “It’s great to be here in Derby today, highlighting the importance of high-speed rail for this region.\n\n“The East Midlands is an area so poorly served by rail at the moment; with these proposals in place connections from North to South, and East to West, will be quicker and easier.\n\n“The case for delivering HS2 from Birmingham to the East Midlands is overwhelming.”\n\nLeicester City Council leader Sir Peter Soulsby, who chair Transport for East Midlands, said: \"The East Midlands boasts a resilient and thriving economy which is well placed to reap the benefits of major rail investment.\n\n\"HS2 to the East Midlands is key priority for TfEM and will transform links to Birmingham and London.\n\n\"With direct HS2 services to Nottingham, Derby and Chesterfield stations, coupled with the electrification of the Midland Main Line, travel times across the region will be significantly reduced and capacity enhanced.\""
