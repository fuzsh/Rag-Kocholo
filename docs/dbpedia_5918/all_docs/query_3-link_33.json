        "text": "A conference highlighting the East of England’s commitment to achieving net zero heard a minister stress the issue could not be left to the next generation or future generations.\n\nThe East of England Local Government Association (EELGA) and Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) hosted its fully-booked 2023 Net Zero Conference at Homerton College in Cambridge last Wednesday (Sept 20).\n\nAttended by prominent public and private sector figures – including MPs and representatives of Stansted Airport – the conference highlighted the region’s needs and opportunities.\n\nDiscussions focused on achieving investment to deliver net zero ambitions, showcasing innovation, decarbonisation in freight and aviation, accelerating electric vehicle infrastructure and more.\n\nIn her keynote speech, energy, consumers and affordability minister Amanda Solloway, Conservative MP for Derby North, said: “Everyone in this room knows how far we’ve got to go and how important it is we keep going, and we go at pace, and we don’t think we can leave this to the next generation or future generations.\n\n“We’ve heard how important our region is – a growing economy, a growing population and a range in our economy from a big rural economy to really hi-tech industries. Today, I learned 44% of offshore energy is already generated off our coastline, so we are a really important region and what we do locally really matters.”\n\nEELGA brings together all 50 of the region’s local authorities – including Herts and Essex county councils and East Herts and Uttlesford district councils – to provide a unified voice and works with partners and stakeholders to support on matters including climate change.\n\nHerts County Council leader Cllr Richard Roberts, who chairs the Regional Climate Change Forum, said: “The East of England is a key player in delivering net zero ambitions.\n\n“Topics discussed throughout the conference shine a light on the truly unique position the region is in, including the opportunities present and the challenges we face.\n\n“Delivering on net zero ambitions and addressing any obstacles faced is a priority for the East of England’s private and public sector, and the fact this event was fully booked makes that clear.”\n\nJoe Chapman, head of corporate affairs at Stansted Airport, said: “Stansted Airport and aviation plays a massive role in supporting regional growth, bolstering trade and jobs through our role as the international gateway for the East of England.\n\n“But we know our growth needs to be sustainable, which is why we’re playing a leading role in ensuring the sector is net zero by 2050.\n\n“From building a solar farm which will be able to power the airport’s entire operation on a sunny day, through to offering financial incentives for our airlines to take up sustainable aviation fuels, this is a huge priority for the business.”"
