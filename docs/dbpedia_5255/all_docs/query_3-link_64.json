        "text": "In April 1997, some lucky customers were able to take possession of their road going 911 GT1, almost a year after the racing version debuted on the track. The technical regulation of the GT1 category required the road production of a minimum number of units. To comply with this rule, Porsche therefore produced a GT1 \"Strassenversion\" (road configuration). The 3163cc engine gave 544 horsepower; the car weighed 1150 kg and was credited with a top speed of over 300 km / h. The competition version made its debut in 1996 and then continued its career the following year both with the official team and with private teams such as BMS Scuderia Italia, Konrad Motorsport, Jabouille-Bouresche, Kremer, Rook, Schuebel Engineering. The 911 GT1 benefited from several improvements for 1998, which allowed Porsche to return to victory at Le Mans with the McNish / Aiello / Ortelli crew."
