        "text": "Even though the '90s seem recent, the truth is that this decade ended over 20 years ago. We still fondly remember the '90s, it started as an extension of the '80s, but it ended with mobile phones and the world wide web. By all accounts, it was one of the best decades in human history with a stable economy, significant political changes (fall of Communism), memorable cultural moments, and the start of the internet revolution. All of that reflected onto supercars, which became much faster, better built, and more purposeful. Yes, the '90s were a decade of computer-designed cars, but contrary to current models, supercars of the '90s still retained the soul and essence of uncompromising machines of the past. That is why we will take a better look at the ten most legendary supercars of the '90s.\n\n1. Jaguar XJ220\n\nIn 1992, Jaguar stunned the car world by introducing the XJ220, its first road-going supercar. In those days, Jaguar was known for its portfolio of luxury sedans and GT coupes, and the appearance of the thoroughbred supercar was quite shocking. However, for those who followed Jaguar's efforts in endurance championships, XJ220 represented the crown of a successful racing project, which resulted in two Le Mans wins in 1988 and 1990.\n\nEven though the Jaguar had a proven V12 engine sitting on the shelf, XJ220 was equipped with an unusual twin-turbo V6 unit, which had a displacement of 3.5-liters and output of 550 hp, an extraordinary figure for the early '90s. Due to sleek and aerodynamically-efficient styling and Jaguar's racing know-how, the XJ220 was officially the fastest production car in 1992/3 with a top speed of 212 mph. However, despite the stellar performance, gorgeous looks, and racing legacy, XJ220 was pretty impractical for use, which was the main reason why Jaguar sold just 262 examples and discontinued the model in 1994.\n\n2. Cizeta-Moroder V16T\n\nOne of the craziest supercar stories from the '90s was the saga of Cizeta-Moroder V16T. This project started when engineer Claudio Zampolli started the Cizeta company with famous music composer Giorgio Moroder. With his expertise and Moroder's founding and legendary Marcelo Gandini's help, V16T was presented in 1991. Even in the crazy world of supercars where anything is possible, this was something nobody had ever seen before.\n\nThe main feature was its unique V16 engine, which was constructed from two Lamborghini Urraco's V8 units and placed transversally (as the \"T\" in the name suggests) behind the driver. This made the car very wide but also provided it amazing power and performance. The 6.0-liter V16 engine delivered 540 hp and propelled this unusual machine to 204 mph top speed. Unfortunately, the enormous price, as well as production difficulties and conflict between the partners, limited the production to only 20 examples (est.).\n\n3. Ferrari F50\n\nIf the iconic F40 established Ferrari's dominance in the supercar category with its raw power, brutal performance, and race car dynamics, the F50 was set to refine this experience and make it more Formula One for the street then boulevard Group B rally car. In 1995, Ferrari presented the F50 and returned to its roots with a 4.7-liter, high-revving V12 engine with 520 hp and six-speed manual transmission.\n\nEven though the F50 is not as quick as F40 (which is something Ferrari tried to hide), it is still a blisteringly fast and gorgeous machine with 194 mph top speed and 0 to 60 mph times in just under 4 seconds. However, this fantastic supercar's real value lies in the fact that it is probably the last classic Ferrari of the 20th century with a naturally-aspirated V12, manual transmission, and analog driving feel, which is something collectors sometimes like more than the muscle car approach of F40. The production was ended in 1997 after just 349 examples.\n\n4. Lamborghini Diablo\n\nThe supercar fans will always love the Countach more than Diablo, simply based on the image this winged legend has in the collective consciousness, even though the Diablo is a far superior machine in every way. It is also one of the most successful Lamborghini supercars, which stayed in production for 11 years (1990 to 2001), and it was sold in almost 3000 examples.\n\nWith a wedge-shaped body, screaming 5.7 or 6.0-liter V12 in the back, pop up headlights, and, how appropriate, Lambo doors, Diablo is the typical supercar. The look was backed by a performance with 492 hp in earlier models and 583 hp in later, redesigned models with a bigger engine. However, the Diabolo proved to be much more than just a Countach replacement. Over the years, it was improved continuously, changed, enhanced, and even produced with an all-wheel-drive train in the Diablo VT version. It had success in racing and was also sold as a roadster.\n\n5. Bugatti EB110\n\nForget for a moment the modern Bugattis and their questionable design and over-the-top technology, and let's get back to 1991 when EB110 was introduced. Romano Arioli, an Italian businessman, just resurrected the famous Bugatti company and rounded up the biggest names in supercar game to make a modern-day Bugatti supercar that would make legendary Ettore Bugatti proud.\n\nEven though the EB110 proved to be a commercial failure, it was a glorious car in every way and something that uncompromising character like Ettore Bugatti would like. Just look at the basic spec of EB110 with its 3.5-liter, quad-turbo V12 with 560 hp (610 in SS version) and capable all-wheel-drive. The EB110 was one of the first cars ever built to come with active aero and even active air flaps, which is technology straight from a fighter jet. Unfortunately, the exceptionally high price and manufacturing difficulties limited the EB110 production to only 139 examples, and the company closed its doors in 1995.\n\n6. Porsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion\n\nThe Porsche's first supercar, the eponymous 959, was the real child of the '80s, but after its demise in 1993, the company didn't introduce the replacement. However, in 1996 another Porsche supercar was presented, this time barely legal for road use. Called the 911 GT1 Straßenversion, it was a homologation special, produced in just 25 examples as an attempt to enter the GT1 class of endurance racing.\n\nEven though the name suggests it was based on 911, only the basic shape front lights were the same as the standard car. Under the composite body, everything was built from scratch and competition-ready. The 3.2-liter, twin-turbo flat-six was derived from the 911 Turbo engine but delivered 544 hp and managed to launch the GT1 Straßenversion to 191 mph and achieve 60 mph in less than 4 seconds.\n\n7. McLaren F1\n\nThere is a good reason why the asking price for one of the 106 McLaren F1 ever made is north of $20 million. In a world of supercars, this is amongst the most respected creations, representing the unique approach and design and serves as a testament to Gordon Murrey's ingenious work.\n\nIntroduced in 1992, F1 cost $1 million, which was an insane amount of money for any car, 30 years ago. However, for that price, buyers got state-of-the-art chassis, gold-plated engine bay (not as a luxury feature but as a heat exchanger), 6.1-liter V12 with 620 hp, unusual central seating position, and Le Mans-winning heritage. Such an incredible machine attracted the world's most discriminating buyers and received rave reviews from motoring journalists lucky enough to road test it when it was new. Even though the F1's performance and top speed are still impressive, the sheer perfection of the engineering, elegant design, and fantastic driving dynamics makes it probably the best supercar ever made.\n\n8. Mercedes CLK GTR\n\nEven though you might think that McLaren F1 was the most expensive supercar of the '90s, you would be wrong. This honor goes to the 1997 Mercedes CLK GTR, which retailed for around $1.5 million and was sold in just 30 examples.\n\nConceived for the same purpose as the Porsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion, Mercedes CLK GTR was a bona fide race machine, tuned down a little just to get a street-legal approval from German DMV. Produced by the AMG department; it was powered by 6.9 or 7.3-liter V12 engine which delivered 612 hp. Massive engine ensured the insane performance, and this Mercedes had a top speed of 214 mph.\n\n9. Nissan R390 GT\n\nNissan was no stranger to competent sports cars but never produced an actual supercar until 1998 and very elegant and extremely fast R390 GT. This obscure model was kind of Holy Grail amongst this brand's fans, being completely different from anything this company ever produced before.\n\nDesigned by Ian Callum, this Nissan was intended for racing, with GT being one of just two road-going examples ever produced. Powered by a 3.5-liter, twin-turbo V8 engine with 560 hp. This was enough for 0 to 60 mph time of 3.9 seconds and a top speed of 220 mph. The R390 GT was offered for sale at $1 million, but it is unclear if any of the two produced cars were ever actually sold to the public.\n\n10. Vector M12\n\nThe 80's car fans probably remember the crazy-looking Vector W8, one of the rare American-made supercars of the period. With its unique styling and turbocharged V8 engine it was very fast but failed to attract attention from well-off buyers. However, in 1995, new owners of the company introduced M12, a Lamborghini-powered model that took the W8's design and introduced it to the '90s.\n\nThe M12 ditched Chevrolet's V8 for a more refined Italian 5.7-liter V12 engine. It was the same engine used in Lamborghini Diablo, which meant that the power output was 499 hp. Even though the M12 looked terrific, it couldn't hide its '80s shape, and despite the excellent performance, the company managed to sell only 17 cars before going bankrupt in 1999."
