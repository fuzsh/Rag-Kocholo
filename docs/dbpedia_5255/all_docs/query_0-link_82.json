        "text": "Regulations for the GT1 category are very strict and for a car to to be eligible, a total of 25 cars must be built for road use. As a result Porsche developed a fully road-legal version, dubbed “911 GT1 Straßenversion” essentially a race car with lights and a few other creature comforts that mean they can be driven on the road. Crazy, we know! Porsche delivered an example in early 1996 to the German government for compliance testing, which it passed.\n\nUnfortunately the engine had to be slightly de-tuned to meet European emissions laws, although its 544 PS (400 kW; 537 hp) and dry weight of 1,150 kg proved to be more than adequate. As you can imagine this car was very very fast! The street legasl car can accelerate to 100 km/h from a standstill in just 3.9 seconds on its way to a top speed of 308 km/h, insane figures for a car that is well over 20 years old!"
