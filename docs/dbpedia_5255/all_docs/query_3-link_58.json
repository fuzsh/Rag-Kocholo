        "text": "Autoblog\n\nPorsche\n\n911 News\n\nAuctions\n\nPorsche 911 GT1 Evo up for grabs in Monaco valued at $3M\n\nThis is the only street-legal 911 GT1 Evolution in the world.\n\nView 24 Photos\n\nOn paper, Porsche didn't do a flagship supercar in between the 959 and the Carrera GT. In reality, it did. Sort of. It was the strassenversion of the 911 GT1, a homologation special based on a spectacularly successful racing car. And RM Sotheby's has a standout example consigned for its upcoming sale in Monaco.\n\nWhat you're looking at is a 911 GT1 Evolution that served as the mid-point in the GT1's development, following the original and followed in turn by the GT1-98 that won the 24 Hours of Le Mans that year. One of just fourteen 911 GT1s held in public hands, chassis number GT1 993-117 won the Canadian GT Championship three years running, and is the only GT1 Evo that was ever registered for use on public roads. RM Sotheby's anticipates that it will fetch between $2.9 and $3.25 million when it crosses the auction block in May, marking the first time that this particular example has come up for auction. That would make it considerably more valuable than the GT1 Evo Gooding & Company sold at Amelia Island in 2012 for $1.26 million, according to Sports Car Market.\n\nOf course, the Porsche isn't the only notable item the auction house has lined up for the sale during the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique weekend. There's a pair of 1930s German convertibles – one Mercedes 540 K and one Horch 670 – valued at about the same level as the 911 GT1, a Tucker 48 (~$1.6m), and Niki Lauda's debut March 711 grand prix racer (~$550k). Those are some tempting sets of wheels, and we'll be watching to see how they fare two months from now.\n\nRelated Video:\n\nShow full PR text\n\nHistoric racing greats and magnificent tourers join the starting grid for RM Sotheby's multi-million Euro Monaco sale\n\n- RM Sotheby's prepares for biennial Monaco sale, 14 May, during the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique weekend\n\n- Latest highlights led by the only road-registered Porsche 911 GT1 Evolution in existence, and Niki Lauda's first Formula One car - a 1971 March 711\n\n- Sale also features pre-war grand touring greats including a 1936 Mercedes-Benz 540 K Cabriolet A and a 1932 Horch 670 Cabriolet\n\n- Handpicked roster of blue-chip automobiles also features a 1948 Tucker 48, a rare addition to any European sale\n\n- Further sale information and a frequently updated list of entries available at www.rmsothebys.com\n\nLONDON (8 March, 2016) – RM Sotheby's is delighted to announce a fantastic collection of historic competition and exquisite road-going touring cars - a group that collectively spans more than eight decades of leading automotive development - as the latest highlights for its upcoming Monaco sale, 14 May, during the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique weekend. In keeping with the sale's location, RM's biennial Monaco auction always attracts fabulous racing machinery, and this year, every major racing discipline from Formula One to Group B and endurance racing, is represented.\n\nThe upcoming RM sale, unquestionably one of Europe's most eagerly-anticipated auction events, has already grabbed headlines with the previously announced 1951 Ferrari 340 America Barchetta. The Ferrari will be joined at the May sale by another racing great of a different era: the 1997 Porsche 911 GT1 Evolution, chassis no. GT1 993-117. The only known road-registered example, GT1 993-117 is one of just 14 GT1 race cars in private hands and has never before been offered for sale publicly. With over 13 wins to its name from 31 starts, this 993-based GT1 Evolution not only won the Canadian GT Championship three times (1999-2001) but also participated in the Daytona 24 Hour race. Believed to be the only ex-race car with road registration in existence, it is a vehicle that will wow crowds wherever it goes (Estimate: €2.700.000 - €3.000.000).\n\nA Monaco sale without a Formula One car is unthinkable, and just as RM offered the iconic, ex-James Hunt, Hesketh 308 in 2014, this year will see RM present the first car that three-time World Champion, Niki Lauda, drove in Formula One. One of the most distinctive GP cars of the era, the 1971 March 711 was driven by Lauda at the Austrian Grand Prix, although the car was originally built for Ronnie Peterson, who took podium finishes in '711-02' at both the Monaco and Hockenheim Grand Prix. Offered out of single-ownership since 1973, it is perceived to be one of the most significant and original pieces of Formula One history (Est. €550.000- €650.000).\n\nAway from the competition cars, RM's upcoming Monaco auction features some very important pre-war grand touring cars. No country did large, extravagant touring cars quite like the Germans during the 1930s. A fantastic example of this is offered by the 1936 Mercedes-Benz 540 K Cabriolet A, chassis no. 130941, one of just 33 of this body style and one of just a handful equipped with the desirable 5.4-litre engine (Est. €2.700.000 - €3.300.000). Just as Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union battled for honours in Grand Prix racing, Horch was Mercedes' great road-going rival during the same period. The 1932 Horch 670 Cabriolet on offer, chassis no. 67045, is one of only five cars known to exist. Of the small known group of these incredible V-12 Horch 670s, four of the five are in institutional ownership, with this being the only example in private hands, presenting a singular opportunity for someone wishing to purchase a 670. The featured example boasts known UK history prior to being imported to the United States in the late 1950s (Estimate: €2.700.000 - €3.600.000).\n\n'Rare' doesn't begin to describe a 1948 Tucker 48. Just 51 Tucker 48s were ever built, and chassis no. 1049 is the only one currently in continental Europe. The Tucker 48 was the only car made by well-respected automotive industry veteran Preston Thomas Tucker. Although the marque's demise still remains controversial, the Tucker remains a rolling symbol of the American dream, and is still regarded as one of the most advanced early post-war automobiles produced. The late production example slated for RM's Monaco podium has long-term provenance with respected enthusiast ownership to its name, including Nick Jenin, Gene Zimmerman and Bob Bahre. Presented in period-correct Waltz Blue paintwork and offered fresh from a restoration by its current owner, its pre-sale estimate of €1.350.000 - €1.850.000 reflects its condition and rarity.\n\nThis content is hosted by a third party.
