        "text": "The Porsche 911 is one of the greatest sportscars ever made. Find out how much the 911 costs and other important facts\n\nHow much is a Porsche 911? The 911 is not only the most famous model in the Porsche range but also one of the iconic names in motoring, with a history dating back to the early 1960s. Today, the price tag for new 911 models varies across different global markets. In the USA, the Porsche 911 Carrera starts at around $114,400. In the UK, it begins at Â£97,000. Meanwhile, in Germany, the birthplace of Porsche, the starting price is â¬122,493. For customers in China, the price is 1,298,000 CNY. In the Middle East, the base price of the 911 Carrera is 461,100 AED in Dubai and 522,900 SAR in Saudi Arabia.The figures for the 911 sportscars above represent the starting price as of March 2024 for the base model of the Porsche 911 Carrera with standard fittings. When was the 911 first launched?Designed by Ferdinand Alexander Porsche, the Porsche 911 made its debut at the 1963 Frankfurt International Motor Show. At the time it was initially called the 901, but by the time it went into full production at the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen in September 1964, the name had been changed to 911. As well as its flowing silhouette â one that has carried through to every iteration of the 911 ever since â one of the other main facets that continue to set it apart from its sportscar contemporaries is its distinctive rear-engine layout. It was a feature of the first 911, just as it is today in the current 911 model, the type 992. The unveiling of the one millionth 911 in 2017 â a Carrera S painted in Irish Green, the favourite colour of the current chairman of Porsche AG, Dr Wolfgang Porsche â marked a significant milestone. Over the years, more than 1.2 million 911 cars have rolled off the production line, cementing its status as one of the best-selling sportscars of all time. Why does the 911 have a rear-engine layout?The signature rear-engine layout of the Porsche 911, where the engine â unlike most other road cars â is positioned just behind the rear axle, is a defining characteristic that truly sets it apart from others. This unique arrangement contributes to the distinctive driving dynamics of the 911, providing a high level of traction at the rear wheels when accelerating. What has allowed this layout to endure over the past 60 years and more since the 911 was launched is how Porsche engineers have masterfully balanced the carâs weight distribution to aid its supreme handling characteristics. Continuous improvements by the Porsche engineering teams over the decades have given the 911 a unique blend of agility, stability and performance. It also led to the creation of a âfrunkâ in the 911 â or front trunk â a compact front storage area under the bonnet, as opposed to the traditional rear location found in most other internal combustion engine cars. What are the different Porsche 911 model names?The 911 is the pinnacle of the Porsche sportscar line-up with a range of different versions distinguished by a number of body styles and engines. The Porsche 911 Carrera, for example, pays tribute to the motorsport provenance of the sportscar by referencing the Carrera Panamericana, the famous Mexican road race that in the 1950s was considered one of the most challenging in the world. The 911 Targa, meanwhile, is the name for an open-top variant that honoured the Targa Florio, the renowned Sicilian endurance race. Then there is the Porsche 911 Dakar, with its unique off-road capabilities, which is named after the legendary Dakar Rally. Apart from honouring great motorsport events, Porsche also has other naming conventions for its iconic 911 line. For example, the Porsche 911 Turbo â which made its debut in 1974 and had the internal Porsche designation 930 â was one of the first production sportscars to use a turbocharged engine, hence its Turbo name. The Porsche 911 GT3, meanwhile, offers a pure, track-focused driving experience. The GT3 RS, an even more powerful version of the GT3, gets its name from the initials for Rennsport, which means âracingâ in German. Currently, the most expensive version of the 911 available (as of March 2024) is the Porsche 911 S/T. Its name first appeared in 1969 on a race-only variant. Today, the S/T is a production sportscar, and its name stands for Sport/Touring. This extremely lightweight version of the 911 boasts significant engine upgrades.How fast is a Porsche 911?As of March 2024, there are currently 26 different versions of the Porsche 911 available (dependent on specific markets), each with different performance specifications.The power output of the Porsche 911 Carrera is 385PS, which allows it to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.2 seconds, reaching a maximum speed of 293 km/h. In the case of the 911 GT3 RS, youâre looking at a substantial boost in performance. This 525PS model can achieve a top speed of 296 km/h as well as accelerate from standstill to 100 km/h in just 3.2 seconds. The fastest current production Porsche 911 as of March 2024 is the 911 Turbo S. Its 3.7-litre engine produces 650PS, enabling it to rocket from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.7 seconds when twinned with the PDK gearbox and Sport Chrono Package. It has a top speed of 330 km/h. What is the most expensive 911 ever sold?As of March 2024, the record for the most expensive Porsche 911 model ever sold at auction belongs to the unique 1998 Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion, which fetched $5,665,000 at Gooding & Coâs Amelia Islands Auction in 2017.When it comes to current production models, the most expensive is the Porsche 911 S/T, which retails from $290,000 in the USA, â¬292,187 in Germany and Â£231,600 in the UK, as of March 2024. The price in Dubai is 1,149,600 AED while in Saudi Arabia a new 911 S/T costs 1,303,700 SAR.\n\nConsumption and emission information 911 Carrera S (WLTP): Fuel consumption combined: 11.1 - 10.1 l/100 km; COâ emissions combined: 251 - 229 g/km; COâ class: G. 911 Carrera 4S (WLTP): Fuel consumption combined: 11.1 - 10.2 l/100 km; COâ emissions combined: 253 - 231 g/km; COâ class: G. 911 Dakar (WLTP): Fuel consumption combined: 11.3 l/100 km; COâ emissions combined: 256 g/km; COâ class: G. 911 Carrera (WLTP): Fuel consumption combined: 10.8 - 10.3 l/100 km; COâ emissions combined: 245 - 233 g/km; COâ class: G. 911 S/T (WLTP): Fuel consumption combined: 13.8 l/100 km; COâ emissions combined: 313 g/km; COâ class: G. 911 GT3 (WLTP): Fuel consumption combined: 13.0 - 12.9 l/100 km; COâ emissions combined: 294 - 293 g/km; COâ class: G."
