        "text": "By Rennlist.com -\n\nWe don’t condone smoking, except when it comes to smokin’ the competition on the track in a turbocharged Porsche 911 GT1.\n\nThe Petersen Automotive Museum gives auto enthusiasts a chance to see some of the most rare, most amazing cars ever built, like at its new Japanese custom cars exhibit, and its just-opened “The Vault presented by Hagerty” showcase. On a recent visit, Rennlist was, naturally, distracted by the stunning Porsches. This 1997 Porsche 911 GT1 caught our attention immediately. The GT1 packs some amazing power, and has a history of domination on the track.\n\nThe 911 GT1 means business with a 3.2 liter flat-six turbocharged, water-cooled mid-engine. It packs a wallop with 600 hp, and top speeds of 206 mph. It is a slick race car with an impressive pedigree. This particular model, chassis #101, has earned its respect on some of the most grueling tracks. It showed its prowess in both velocity and endurance in several races such as 1997 FIA GT Championship, 24 Hours of Le Mans, and won Three Hours of Zhuhai in China. Competing in 36 races, the 911 GT1 earned an impressive 21 podium finishes, and 8 wins.\n\nThis 911 GT1 is truly red, white, and badass all over. Check out more shots straight from the lobby of the world-famous Petersen Automotive Museum, below.\n\nFor more details about the Petersen and its current exhibits, like “The Porsche Effect , check out the L.A. museum’s website. And if you can, definitely plan a visit!\n\nPhotos for Rennlist by David M. Ciminelli\n\nJoin the Rennlist forums!"
