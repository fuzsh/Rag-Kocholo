But each time, I try to apply these designs to my car, it states success, but the color doesn't change. Does this only happen to me, or did you notice similiar behavior?

As far as I know, it is available in three different original colors: blue, yellow and white. Apparently, there is no paint chip called \"blue\" from Porsche.

But each time, I try to apply these designs to my car, it states success, but the color doesn't change. Does this only happen to me, or did you notice similiar behavior? Thanks for your help.\n\nPlease post video or pictures\n\nIt's likely that the designs you found were posted without any changes to the paint the car came with on the uploader's end (i.e. the car was originally blue).\n\nWhen applied, the game will also not change the paint on your car, so it stays yellow.\n\nIn the preview it should say something like \"paint colours have not been set for this design.\""
