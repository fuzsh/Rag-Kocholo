        "text": "Check out this highly uncommon opportunity to see a driver actually pushing the road-going version of the 911 GT1 racecar. With only 21 of them in existence, most owners keep the supercars in climate-controlled garages and seldom take them out on the road. This one engages in multiple drag races, including against a Carrera GT.\n\nWatch Some More Supercar Drag Races\n\nThe 911 GT1 Straßenversion (which directly translates to street version) packs a mid-mounted 3.2-litre twin-turbo flat six that produces 536 bhp and 443 pounds-feet of torque. The supercar weighs just 1,150 kg, which lets the ample power get it to 60 mph in around 3.6 seconds and a top speed of 196 mph.\n\nThe Carrera GT was Porsche's next supercar after the GT1. A mid-mounted, naturally aspirated 5.7-litre V10 produced 603 bhp and 435 pound-feet of torque. While power was higher, the vehicle was also somewhat heavier at 1,427 kg. This allowed for acceleration to 62 mph in a claimed 3.3 seconds.\n\nAfter initially snacking on a 993-generation Porsche 911 and a Mercedes-Benz SLR, the 911 GT1 lines up next to the Carrera GT. Neither car gets a great start off the line, but they come up to speed in a hurry. The angle of the video and lack of timing equipment makes it hard to judge the winner. However, this is definitely a close race, and the GT1 has no problem keeping up with the later supercar."
