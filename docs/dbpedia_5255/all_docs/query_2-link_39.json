        "text": "From its sportscars to its racecars, #Porsche has always been associated with speed and the thrill of driving. But some sportscars are a little more extreme than others â€“ and thatâ€™s when a car becomes a hypercar. Just like the Porsche 959: Back in 1985, our roads were still mostly filled with boxy cars. It was into this world that the car considered the first-ever Porsche hypercar â€“ the Porsche 959 â€“ was unleashed. It would go on to have a significant impact on not just the future of Porsche car design and engineering, but what fast cars could be in general. It all began when Porsche sought to find a potential successor to the 911, which saw it develop a new all-wheel drive vehicle as a Group B rally car. When motorsportâ€™s governing body, the FIA, ditched the Group B designation during through the development process of the 959, Porsche made the decision to continue making it anyway. It would result in 292 road-going examples, creating a Porsche hypercar legend in the process. Read more about how Porsche hypercar models have redefined whatâ€™s possible when it comes to fast cars: https://lnkd.in/efWA-82g\n\nðŸš© It's about Time, Mr Porsche I think we can all agree that Porsche makes mighty fine high-performance sports cars, but supercars or hypercars, not so much. However, four particular models have broken that mould: the Porsche 959, the Porsche 911 GT1, the Porsche Carrera GT, and the Porsche 918 Spyder. The 959 was introduced in 1986. At the time, it was one of the world's most technically advanced motor cars. Capable of 60mph in 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 197mph, an all-wheel-drive system and a very complex suspension set-up. The 959 was renowned for its state-of-the-art technical features and performance capabilities. It is a significant motor car in Porsche's history. The mid-90s brought us the Porsche GT1, a race car adapted for legal road usage. Initially, the GT1 was developed for GT1 Class motorsport. The Porsche GT1 experienced victory at the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 2004, we witnessed the launch of the high-revving 5.7-litre V10 Porsche Carrera GT. It was built using a carbon-fibre subframe and monocoque body, resulting in a lightweight yet rigid design. Creating a motor car to succeed the Carrera GT was a challenging task. Welcome the hybrid 2013 Porsche 918 Spyder. Porsche fitted it with a 4.6-litre V8, which delivered 887hp with the assistance of two electric motors. Like the three previous cars, the 918 Spyder's engine was derived from a Porsche race car. All four remarkable cars embody Porsche's commitment to innovation and performance, thereby setting a higher bar for competitors to reach. 2023 was Porsche's 75th Anniversary, and surprise, surprise, a proposed hypercar, code-named Mission X, was announced. Since then, it has been very quiet from the technophiles in Stuttgart. The last I heard, the target launch date was 2025.\n\nðŸš© It's about Time, Mr Porsche I think we can all agree that Porsche makes mighty fine high-performance sports cars, but supercars or hypercars, not so much.

There are many great cars from the 1990s, but some of my favourites are: The Acura a mid-engine sports car that combined Honda reliability with supercar performance and handling. It was praised by many critics and drivers, including the legendary Ayrton Senna. The Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR1, a rare and exotic homologation special that was built to compete in the FIA GT Championship. It had a 6.0-liter engine and a carbon-fiber body, making it one of the most extreme road cars ever made. The Mazda MX-5 a lightweight and affordable roadster that revived the spirit of classic British sports cars. It was fun to drive, easy to maintain, and had a loyal fan base around the world. The a pickup truck that could outrun a Ferrari thanks to its turbocharged V6 engine and all-wheel drive system. It was a sleeper that surprised many unsuspecting drivers with its acceleration and handling. The Chevrolet Corvette the ultimate version of the C4 generation that featured a unique engine developed by Lotus. It had 375 horsepower and could reach over 180 mph, making it one of the fastest cars of its time. What about you? Which cars from the 1990s do you like the most? D.K\n\nI've always been a bit of a demo slut and tend to run with a car for about a month before I get distracted by something else and switch into that. But during discussions with customers I often get asked what I drive and what I like, and I normally say I'm in a hot hatch of some sort. I also say that in a perfect world I would need to have 3 cars, those 3 being a big spec Porsche 911, a huge spec Range Rover and a Golf GTi (or similar) as a daily runner. With those 3 cars in the garage you could live anywhere on the planet (pretty much) and never need anything else. But what if you could only have one ? Whilst performing the final titivation to this lovely spec Porsche Macan GTS that I handed over today, I was thinking that maybe the Porsche Macan is the answer. I know its quite a busy segment of the market, mid-size, premium brand SUVs with some motor sport heritage and there's a few choices for customers. Not least the BMW X3M which is a serious machine. But for me I think Porsche really did open the doors for other manufacturers to follow when they took the premium mid size SUV and gave it perfect balance and some serious beans. And in terms of bang for your buck this big spec Macan GTS with everything you would ever need left the dealership today for (about) ten grand more than a nice spec 5 series. I think that's value. #Porsche #Macan #GTS #MotorSport #3for1\n\nAir-Cooled Porsche 911s Can Rev to 12,000 RPM With These New Cylinder Heads https://lnkd.in/e73-p3ut Some say there's no replacement for displacement; I say there's no replacement for revs. Low-end torque is a boon, but it has nothing on a tachometer that plays the floor-is-lava with the 7,000 rpm mark. And if you own an air-cooled Porsche 911, you can now play that game with a new set of four-valve cylinder heads that are built for a mystical 12,000 rpm. Such heads are a new offering from Swindon Powertrain, the exclusive supplier of the British Touring Car Championship's race engines, which also appears to have had a hand in the canceled Jaguar C-X75 supercar. The heads are built to fit the Porsche M64, the family of air-cooled flat-sixes used in the final two generations of air-cooled 911, the 964 and 993. From the factory, they're just single-overhead-cam three-valve units, or about on par with that you'd find in a minivan of the time. These are still single-cam too, but they're a world apart from the stock engine. For starters, they now feature four valves per cylinder, enhancing flow. They raise compression from about 11:1 according to 964UK.com to 11.5:1, with 12:1 being available if you buy the right pistons. They're 7.7 pounds lighter than the stock heads too, which ought to improve handling. Better still, they're a perfect fit with the stock engine's cam drive, oiling system, valve covers, crankcases, and even exhaust.\n\nDouble take - the original Nissan R390 GT1 road car! In 1997 Nissan unveiled the R390 GT1 road car. A super car that was built to homologate their Le Mans racecar entry. To this point, Nissan was fielding their GTR. However, with rule changes taking places at the time, the GTR was simply not competitive enough. So the R390 GT1 was born. They built road car in collaboration with TWR. It was originally painted in Red with a shorter rear-end and was given the UK registration number \"P835 GUD\", which you see in the top photo. Though, Nissan did state they would build more at $1 million a pop. Something that never came to fruition in the end. Then in 1998, that chassis was rebuilt. Changing parts of the front end, the side vents, a much longer rear section and a duck tail spoiler. Modifications they also made on the race versions of the car. It was painted Blue, given a fake registration number of \"R390 NIS\" and became a Nissan Heritage car. The car travels with the Heritage Collection and is stored at the Zama Garage in Japan. Under the hood of the road car was a de-tuned, but updated version of the Twin Turbo 3.5L V8 VRH35 out of the R89C race car, dubbed the VRH35L. It made 550hp (641hp in the R390 GT1 racecar). That power was pushed to the rear wheels through an Xtrac 6-Speed Sequential Transmission. Making the road car good for a 3.3 second sprint from 0-60mph and a top speed of 220mph. Making it one of the fastest road cars Japan has ever produced. Sidenote tidbit: the engine rights were actually acquired by McLaren from TWR to develop the MP4-12C engine. They dubbed it \"M838T\" and it was built in conjunction with Ricardo. #nissan #r390gt1 #supercar #performance #speed #japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ #Anis_Maaouia"
