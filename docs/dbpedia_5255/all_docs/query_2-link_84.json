        "text": "There are hobbies in this life that I just don’t get. Cigars. Collecting stamps. Amateur arachnology. Knowing how to groom oneself attractively. The Porsche 911. It is a proud member of a family of cars to both exist as a classic and a modern masterpiece, having been in production since 1963. The 911 predates even the Mustang, possibly the world’s most iconic sports car. With its long production comes deeply-sewn tradition: two driven wheels, four seats, six cylinders, all pushed as far to the rear as they will go. The styling is a constant too; it can’t change without casting its following away like a security blanket.\n\nThe necessary tradition is why so many love the 911, and why so many detest it. I happen to shelter under the latter umbrella. I want my new generation of car to be new. Very little has actually evolved since the first 911 was birthed in Germany. Power steering has gone electric from hydraulic, an unpopular change, but a small one to the outside world. Sports cars with a similar age have nearly nothing in common with their ancestors. The C1 Corvette shares barely any DNA with the C7, as seven generations in any family (sans Porsche) will do. The Jaguar E-type, although it waited until its early fifties, had a successful and handsome son. The 911, however, is the product of a young couple who decided to have a new child every several years, without ever thinking to stop. The 911’s appearance is divisive, and once again, I join the crowd that jeers.\n\nHeritage is a valid reason to fawn over the 911, though, and since I’m not a Porsche person I can’t knock it. The line of available 911’s today is a better reason to dislike it. See, when a 911 is bought, it’s not the best 911 for its owner. Maybe they can only afford the base model, or the Sport package but not the turbocharger. They might splurge and get any combination of the words Carrera, 4, S, and Turbo. But when you buy a 911, you’re never really getting the best. Buy a Carrera Turbo 4S, and you still fall short of the 911 GT3 or the GT3RS. Then, a richer Porsche collector buys a 911 GT2RS, but whilst driving it laments a little how he preferred something about the 993. That’s when the guy in the homologation special 911 GT1 Straßenversion overtakes him in the left lane. But still none of these are really the ultimate 911.\n\nWhat strikes me most about the current 911— and even the next one, years before it exists, is that it is certainly not the best they can make it. The aforementioned engine/drivetrain levels confirm that. Businesses the size of Porsche put all their chips on planned obsolescence. Samsung does it, Microsoft does it, Chrysler does it. Entirely sober, I would put down $100 to say that Porsche held back technology to use in the next 911, even though this generation is so young. Look at the tech in the 918. It’s a halo car, but halo cars are always representative of technology that the company plans to add to the rest of their cars. A hybrid 911 may one day exist, which will bring more pitchforks and torches out than a lost World Cup match. And that one will be too heavy or unnatural to be an ultimate 911.\n\nHistory ties in appropriately here. If the same model comes out with a new generation, it had best be an improvement over the last one in any way possible. It’s taken decades to smooth the folds in the stubborn rear-engined layout, but it’s finally there. The story doesn’t continue that way though. They’ve finished the hard part, it’s time to make the improvements incremental. Ask a 911 fan who has driven or owned them all— which had the best steering? Which was easiest to work on? Which had the nicest exhaust note or power delivery? Which transmission was slickest? Which looked the best? They will answer every question with a different generation, some current, some long past. They have memories of what they liked best about every single one. It’s like wanting hot fudge on your ice cream, but they aren’t offering ice cream any more. You can still get the fudge, but only on brown bread. You want hot fudge, so you eat it anyway. Although I must say, that doesn’t sound bad at all to me. It’s still good, but it’s still wrong.\n\nDespite their outward looks, none of them are really the same. If you haven’t owned, or even driven all the 911’s, you have nothing to look back on with a sense of what once was, and what can not be again. New 911’s can’t just replicate the old; technological and regulation changes have ensured that. If you wanted everything right with every 911 in one 911, you were only able to buy the current generation and hope it was closest to what you want. Brown bread and all. There was never a bad 911; they were always good. There just wasn’t one that was objectively the best 911 ever made.\n\nThe past tense is important to use, since the present doesn’t apply. Singer, a circle of 911 enthusiasts with the willpower, know-how, and a blank check, are united with a goal of making the 911 that they have always wanted. It took them years, but they built something astonishing. Ask the 911 fan to make a wish list of every 911 attribute, past and present, that they want on their dream 911, and even some new features. Modern safety? Active aerodynamics? Classic styling? Handmade interior? Best drivetrain? Check all the boxes: Singer’s 911 is a Greatest Hits album.\n\nWhile it may be a Porsche-inspired product, and it’s certainly built with a huge number of Porsche-built or Porsche-based parts, it is not a Porsche 911. It is the Porsche 911 as everyone has always wanted it to be. The way it has been assembled, from a Porsche Lego bin of dreams, is something that does more than make a brilliant car. The Singer accomplishes something that Porsche cannot. It makes me feel nostalgia for the past 911’s, though I’ve never driven one. It’s putting those rose-tinted specs over my nose. Singer makes me see what every 911 enthusiast has always seen in the 911.\n\nWhat Singer have really done, then, is not just make a car. They’ve depolarized the 911. They’ve brought both sides together. I can’t even make Volkswagen Beetle jokes about the Singer, I’d sooner bring up sewing machines. This car is something rare in 2014. It’s the best product a company can possibly release. At a price of up to a half million dollars, you’re going to need a few hours to talk with the spouse about it, but money ceases its relevance at the turn of the key. At about 5000RPM, every single thing you’ve ever heard about the 911 comes true in spectacular fashion… or so I’ve worked it up in my head. I may never drive a Singer 911, but I can always appreciate what they’ve done to make it. If only Singer could bring the Middle East together so convincingly. Get cracking, lads."
