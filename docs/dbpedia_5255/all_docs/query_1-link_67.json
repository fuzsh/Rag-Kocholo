        "text": "A couple of months ago, a stunning 1998 Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion was listed for sale in the U.K. While it remains unclear if it has found a new owner since then, the ultra-rare light yellow example was recently spotted in Cannes by Passion Auto Photographie!\n\nIn order for Porsche to enter the GT1 racing category, it was required for homologation purposes that 25 units had to be created for road use. What Porsche came up with was the Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion; a car so out of this world and seemingly unfit for the road that the only other car it can be compared to is the CLK GTR.\n\nUnder the hood, it features a 3.2-liter twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine delivering 537 hp. While that may not seem like much in todayâ€™s terms, the Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion despite its size, tips the scales at a mere 1,150 kg! As a result of this, it can accelerate from 0-100 km/h in a mere 3.9 seconds and onto a top speed in excess of 300 km/h.\n\nThis particular example was the tenth GT1 Strassenversion produced and was hand built by Porsche Motorsport to the specifications of its owner. It has covered less than 6000 km and seeing it out on the road must have been an incredible sight."
