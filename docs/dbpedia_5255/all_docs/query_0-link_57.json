        "text": "There appears to be a new hypercar every day in today’s modern world. Their beautiful design and outrageous look appeal to car fanatics, but true enthusiasts still think old is gold. We now have exotic cars quicker than certain light planes, but vintage supercars are not just about speed and engines. Their value is nearly unquantifiable when the hypercar we talk about has an actual racing lineage. The Porsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion is one such hypercar, and it’s rather valuable.\n\nPorsche 911 GT1 Straßenversion: An Overview\n\nThis 1990s classic bridges the gap between the Porsche 959 and the Porsche Carrera GT in the chronology. The 911 GT1 was a racing hypercar that had practically little in common with the 911 model of the time and was developed for the 1996 season of the FIA GT Championship. Porsche needed to produce a limited-run, street-legal variant in order to compete, which is how the Straßenversion (roughly known as “Street Version” in German) was born.\n\nPeculiar Features And Quirks\n\nPorsche used 911 bodywork on a modified chassis from its victorious 962 racer to produce the GT1. It was one of the craziest Porsches the world has ever witnessed. So, let’s see what this legendary exotic car features:\n\nCompartments And Engine\n\nIn the purest sense, this is a race car for the road. The doors are standard and open in the same way as most vehicles. A pull lever is located to the steering wheel’s left. On pulling it, the front compartment gets unlocked, which opens from the windshield’s side. There’s a 964 gasoline tank that takes up the majority of the room, as well as the battery and washer fluid.\n\nTo access the little back compartment, look for the electrical switch hidden under the roll cage in the driver footwell. The trickle charger, and some special tools, among other things, are kept in this compartment.\n\nThe special tool that we just mentioned is actually used to unwind the hinges that keep the huge engine cover in place. Just stick the tool in the openings (you’ll see them when you open the doors) and give a few rotations until you hear a click. A self-locking mechanism is what keeps the huge hood in place while open.\n\nOnce everything is off, you can admire the 3.2-liter twin-turbo flat-six engine, which churns out 536 horsepower, using 5W-40 oil and paired to a 964 gearbox. Furthermore, Porsche claims that the car can accelerate from zero to sixty miles per hour in 3.9 seconds.\n\nA Look Inside The Cabin\n\nThe 993 dashboard greets you right when you get inside the car. But “the arching ceiling” houses the centre air scoop, reducing headroom. You’ll find the keyhole positioned on the steering wheel’s left, as is customary for Porsche. In the GT1, you’ll feast your eyes with the six-speed manual’s exposed gear linkage, an engineering work of art.\n\nOn the driver’s left sits the handbrake lever, as it is in other exotic cars from that era. Aside from that, it’s exactly what you’d imagine from a 993 dashboard. Buttons are limited and well-placed. One new addition is a rear-mounted camera, which can be left on all the time if desired.\n\nWrapping Up"
