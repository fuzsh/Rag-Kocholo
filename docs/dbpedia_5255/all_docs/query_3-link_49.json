        "text": "The Porsche 911 Strassenversion is a pretty rare beast since only approximately 20 units were built to homologate the GT1-spec racecar. A pristine example of the street-legal exotic with extra-low mileage is currently offered for sale in Japan, for an eye-watering price of €10,550,000 ($12,263,584) before taxes.\n\nThe 1998 Porsche GT1 Strassenversion in question is painted in Fern White combined with a black interior. It has 996-style headlights and taillights and features an ultra-wide body with extreme aero components and huge intakes. While it is not as rare as the even more lightweight GT1-98 Straßenversion, this example is still amazingly cool and most Porsche collectors would do anything to own one.\n\nWatch Also: Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion Is Truly A Street-Legal Race Car\n\nThe twin-turbo 3.2-liter water-cooled flat-six engine is tuned to produce around 700 hp (522 kW / 710 PS), which is a significant increase over the stock model’s 537 hp (400 kW / 544 PS. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a manual gearbox. The factory spec model accelerated from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 3.7 seconds and had a top speed of 310 km/h (192 mph). The amazing thing is that it only has 787 km (489 miles) on the odometer, making it even more desirable.\n\nThe car is listed for sale at James Edition through BTC Auction Cars. Mind you, even if it sells at $10.55 million, the GT1 Straßenversion won’t be the most expensive Porsche ever. This title belongs to a 1971 917K racecar that was sold for over $14 million to a private collector."
