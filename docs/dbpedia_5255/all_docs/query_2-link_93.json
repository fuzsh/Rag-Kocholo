        "text": "I tested suspension setups with GT-4 Ford Mustang at Watkins Glen and at lap 2 I had a lethal accident. At the high speed chicanes right after the main straight I turned left and felt the rear end sliding just a little, I counter-steered just a bit but suddenly the tires bit into the asphalt and I steered right into the right hand barriers head-on doing around 250 km/h.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of Allan Simonsen lethal accident - when his Aston Martin slipped on the curb at Le Mans, he counter-steered and then when grip suddenly returned he went head-on into the barriers full speed. (Rest in peace Allan )\n\nAnyway, here is the pic. I crashed so hard into the barriers the rear lifted off the track, that's a first for me in this game. (Also, I'm pretty surprised to see the GT4 car has no flat floor)\n\nWell, I thought I had Casparello’s S15 dialed in perfectly, but when I went to run it, not so much. I focused way too much on trying to get 3 laps out of it and ruined the car in the process. It got to the point where I was going to write it off completely, even after the win. Even went so far as to drive my not-swapped S15 and started making arguments in my head as to what a waste the swap was for the car, which is somewhat still true as the stock engine is great it. Then I tore it all down, reset the chassis and kept it at WR1 for better power and just accepting it as a 2-lap car. What a difference that made, the car actually became fun to drive again and I managed a new feat in the process, lapping the entire damn field!\n\nThen I tuned up the Huayra to see how many credits I’d have left over. Had what I needed, so before I pulled her on to the track, I had the pleasure of this…\n\nBack out on the track with my Huayra and holy cow that thing has torque for days! Couple that with adequate fuel economy, allowing for 3-lap stints, made for a very pleasent drive.\n\nNow for the fun part of the day…\n\nTook out the Peugeot 208 and its close, but it has some very odd behavior when decelerating, it needs some suspension and LSD work far beyond my very limited expertise. I got a 2nd place, but couldn’t overtake the leader. You want a challenge? Take this car to Sarthe.\n\nSuperbird next, thank God Praiano had a tune. If you can remember that you’re in a classic American muscle car with all the characteristics that come with it and the weather cooperates, its a really fun drive…the 4th attempt at least.\n\nFirebird for the finale, it was easy after the Superbird. The swpped engine gives it enough legs for 3 laps or else this may have been a repeat of the Plymouth. I’m just thankful I managed to survive these 3 cars.\n\nBy far the most challenging day of the CfS project. I’ll be sure and not schedule like that again, lol.\n\nDamn I need a beer.\n\nCalled to see Mr Hagerty. He sold me a Maserati Spyder, a Nissan Skyline Super Silhouette and a Porsche 911 Gt1 Strassenversion for a total of 7.15 million credits. Seems like a bargain. The Skyline has paid for itself already, winning at Le Mans and Sardegna. Took the Maserati on a gentle trip down the Ring. A bit squirrelly under braking, I think. Not driven the Porsche yet.\n\nThe 3 star daily workout ticket of dispondency revealed a Chevrolet Corvette C7 ZR1... Go figure... A nice change of luck??...\n\nPractising for Sundays rearranged Discord race at Dragon Trails Seaside in the Porsche 911 RSR Cup. Can't seem to get a rhythm going. I'll do 8 pretty good laps, then end up binning it 😩. It's always in a different place though. Can't work it out. Probably just need to walk away & have a fag break, figuratively speaking, as I don't smoke. You know what I mean..\n\nTtfn chaps"
