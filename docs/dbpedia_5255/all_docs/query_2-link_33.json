        "text": "One of the most special road-legal Porsche cars is for sale. Via duPont Registry an US owner is offering the last GT1 Strassenversion car built for $2,325,000.\n\nThe 911 GT1 was built for Porsche’s participation in the GT1 class in the 1996 edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans and sportscar racing. Homologation standards required that a total of 25 cars must be built for road use. The limited-production street-legal version was labeled the 911 GT1 Straßenversion (Street version), which is literally a road-going racing car.\n\nAlthough the engine of the road-going 911 GT1 had to be slightly de-tuned to 536hp to meet European emissions laws, the car offered here has a total output of 690 horsepower, which enables it to accelerate from standstill to 100km/h in 3.3 seconds. The top speed is a whopping 378km/h.\n\nThe vehicle only has 4,900 kilometers on the odometer. It was recently serviced by Porsche and is listed as being in museum condition."
