Heck, I might even include the fictional brands that may connect to my car, too, like Auto Plus or Brighton Antiques.\n\nLast edited: Sep 19, 2021\n\n735\n\nMaryland, USA\n\nSep 19, 2021\n\n#3\n\n100% gonna make a 1999 Calsonic GT-R livery on top of the 1999 Pennzoil GT-R.\n\nAlready made an exact replica of the 2008 Raybrig NSX in GT Sport, probably the most fun I've had making a livery.\n\nLast edited: Sep 19, 2021\n\n3,706\n\nSão Paulo\n\nPhilip-Giger\n\nSep 19, 2021\n\n#4\n\nI'm already predicting that Living Legend will be the car I'll work the most, but I would start with a classic livery like this:\n\n(Livery by Sean Bull)\n\n49,986\n\nAustralia\n\nSpacedustDaddy\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#5\n\nI do certain takes on replicas. Doing BTCC Super Touring liveries, on the GR.4 Atenza. Seeing the GR.4 G70, if it's FR(hope it's not 4WD), I'll make another replica of my avatar. I've done a couple for the Crown Athlete in GT Sport, but really want the latest car.\n\nI'll have to see what the GR.4 car list looks like. If we get updated GT4 cars, I'll probably replicate the GT4 European Series liveries.\n\n4,929\n\nUnited States\n\nStawookie\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#6\n\n1938 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B:\n\nThe same car (Chassis #412035) PD modeled for GT7 won the very first Watkins Glen Grand Prix in 1948.\n\nAnother 8C Lungo Berlinetta won the Mille Miglia in 1947.\n\n1944/45 Ford GPW/Willys MB\n\nSome Jeeps in the USAAF were painted in a bright yellow livery and were used as “Follow Me” vehicles to guide outbound aircraft to the correct departure point.\n\n1952 Mercedes-Benz 300SL W194:\n\nThe W194 that won the 1952 Carrera La Panamericana.\n\n1956 Porsche 356A GS Carrera:\n\nThe 1951 Porsche 356 SL that won the 1100cc class in Le Mans.\n\n1971 Nissan Skyline 2000 GT-R\n\nThe GT-R that won the 1971 Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji Speedway.\n\nLast edited: Sep 20, 2021\n\nStephan\n\nStill progressing........\n\n5,122\n\nManila\n\nFilracer\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#7\n\nI'm so far thinking of doing this on the CLK LM but replacing that woman decal with something else.\n\nAnd while I'm aware that there's going to be a ton of these, I would still like to make one my own.\n\nLast edited: Sep 20, 2021\n\n575\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nTheEvstar\n\nSep 20, 2021\n\n#8\n\nI'm already predicting that Living Legend will be the car I'll work the most, but I would start with a classic livery like this:\n\nView attachment 1081620\n\n(Livery by Sean Bull)\n\nThat's what I want to do to the 917LL.

Maybe not an exact 1:1 replica since it's pretty plain but certainly utilizing a similar kind of stripe and the same black/red over silver colour pallet. Get some sponsors on there an all that too.\n\nThen I'd also like to get the 2017 911 RSR factory livery on both the 917 Living Legend and the 911 GT1. The black, red and white one with the Porsche Intelligent Performance badges in the grey stripe. I love that livery so much and put it on the 962 in Sport.\n\nAlso on the Genesis Vision GT car in Group 3 I'd also like to put a Hyundai \"N\" factory livery on it like this I30N here. Absolutely love the Hyundai factory colours too.\n\nLast edited: Sep 22, 2021\n\n5,343\n\nDruids Bend\n\nZ4E_Midnight85\n\nSep 22, 2021\n\n#13\n\nI'm hoping they make vintage-style tyre stickers, so we don't have to put ultra modern Michelin tyres on a Group C car...

I don't seem them bringing through the old coding - the existing editor uses an old format for SVG's, so they'll probably want to update it to the new format.
