        "text": "If the pundits are to be believed, the beginning of the end came with the 901 debut in 1963 when the flat-six-powered Porsche doomed itself as the porkier and less-pure follow up to the hallowed 356. It also might have begun when turbocharging entered the 911 lineup in 1975. Or maybe it was when flüssigkeitskühlung finally replaced luftkühlung in 1999 — but definitely the moment turbos infiltrated the lineup with the 991.2 in 2016.\n\nPorsche expert Nathan Merz gives us a full overview of the 1978-1983 911 SC, from body styles, year-to-year changes, helpful resources, and all kinds of things to look out for when you're in the market.\n\nIf you haven’t rushed to read or watch a video on the new, 2025 911 Carrera GTS, here are seven quick facts about the hybrid system which will bring you up to speed so you can hold your own at the next PCA event or cars and coffee.\n\nWhile showing us the 992-generation 911’s mid-cycle update, Porsche uncovered the most controversial development of the iconic sports car in quite some time: a hybrid powertrain for the new 911 Carrera GTS (and Carrera 4 GTS and Targa 4 GTS). We’re going to focus on the electrified GTS and its T-Hybrid system first before touching base on the other Carrera models.\n\nPorsche is so good at drumming up excitement for new models. Spy shots of prototypes testing on the Nürburgring and around the world pop up frequently. Usually there’s some controversy, and this time it’s the now 100%-confirmed hybrid drive system. Porsche states that the performance hybrid drivetrain to be installed in the mid-cycle refresh of this particular 992 variant makes it a faster and more dynamic car.\n\nThe recent debut of the Air|Water show from the creators of Luftgekühlt hammered home the point that the Porsche tent is ever-expanding, and that the distinction between air and water-cooled 911s in terms of desirability/collectability is starting to fade. The darling among the latter appears to be the 997 generation. Here’s why it’s sought after now and will be even more prized in the future.\n\nFor the first time ever, you are invited to commemorate your 911's story in this exclusive super-glossy, hardcover, luxury coffee-table book. A book that’s destined to take pride of place in your office, home, or den.\n\n“I think it belonged to my great aunt,” I guessed, looking over at my mom again. It felt like I’d been uttering that same comment over and over, as the appraiser I’d hired inquired about the origins of our family’s china, silverware, and crystal. My family has gotten smaller and smaller over the generations, and I am now the only person to whom much of this property has been given. My mom knew only that this particular item, a sterling silver coffee urn, was a favorite of her aunt’s, and she never wanted it to leave the family.\n\nOn February 24th, the much-anticipated ordering phase commenced for PCA members eager to immortalize their cherished Porsche 911s in a distinctive yearbook. This crowd-published masterpiece has already garnered enthusiastic participation, with dozens of PCA members joining owners from across the world in seizing the opportunity to feature their beloved 911s on its luxurious pages.\n\nTo celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the September 1964 market launch of the Porsche 911, PCA members are invited to feature their beloved 911s in this luxury coffee table yearbook.\n\nSince 2017, I’ve owned three 1999 996 coupes. The most recent, and the one that I currently own, has over 215,000 miles on it. It’s not just a high-mileage car, but it’s one with more stories than the Brothers Grimm, and there’s both joy and occasional pain in owning a 911 that is never going to be anyone’s heirloom.\n\nAlois Ruf — yes the founder and owner of RUF Automobile — shares the story of his Porsche 901 prototype, one of two in existence. The other one is owned by PCA member Don Meluzio. Each brought his prototype to Rennsport Reunion 7, where we spent some time examining how the cars are different from each other and a production 911.\n\nDamon drives the original 2006 911 Carrera S Club Coupe, which marked PCA's 50th anniversary, and the 2016 911 GTS Club Coupe, marking its 60th. Find out what they're like and how they rate!\n\nLet’s imagine that you had to list the ten most iconic Porsche road cars ever. Odds are that the majority of the models would share one thing: homologation. Most sanctioning bodies running classes based on production cars require that the car being raced also be available for sale as a road car. In 1995, when Porsche realized that the 911 GT2, as formidable as it was, was not going to be able to compete against the McLaren F1 GTR, Porsche brought something new: the 911 GT1.\n\nMart Fresh is a bi-weekly column in which we pick what we think are the \"freshest\" Porsches currently available, and then attempt to explain our reasoning. Up this week are a 1970 911T, 1988 944 Turbo S, 2011 911 Carrera GTS, and 2018 718 Cayman."
