        "text": "It might not be the prettiest Porsche to look at, but the 911 GT1 Straßenversion is without doubt one of the most rare and radical street legal 911s ever to leave the Stuttgart firm’s factory.\n\nYou see, the 911 GT1 Straßenversion is the fully road-legal version of Porsche’s 1997 GT1 race car, While based on the 993, it features many modifications including a bespoke carbon-fiber body made to improve aerodynamics and lower the car’s weight, and a detuned version of the competition model’s turbocharged flat-six engine delivering some 540 horses.\n\nAnd now, one of the very few examples that were built to homologate Porsche’s 911 GT1 contender in the late 1990s (Porsche is said to have built around 20 cars) is up for sale on a German site with an asking price of €1.2 million or about US$1.7 million.\n\nNotably, the seller says the car is located in Tokyo, Japan, but will deliver anywhere, and that the car’s engine is rated at 700-horses.\n\nSeller: Mobile via Gtspirit\n\nPHOTO GALLERY"
