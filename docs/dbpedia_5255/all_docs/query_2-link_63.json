        "text": "If the most you’ve ever managed to collect has been a book of rare stamps or Panini World Cup football stickers, be prepared to turn pea green with envy. A private collection of Porsches featuring four of the most desirable models of the modern era is set to cross the block at Gooding & Co’s Amelia Island auction on 10 March, including the truly feral 911 GT1 Strassenversion.\n\n1998 Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion\n\nYou could be forgiven for not immediately recognising the bonkers GT1. The model started life as a thoroughbred racer, picking up a class victory and overall win at the 1998 Le Mans 24 Hours before a street version was offered to the public – but only to a select few. Just 20 examples were ever built, with most going straight to top brass and VIP clients. Your best chance of spotting a GT1 is at the firm’s museum in Stuttgart, which makes this public auction one to watch. The price tag? If you have to ask…\n\n1993 Porsche 964 Turbo S Leichtbau\n\nLike the GT1, the 964 Turbo S Leichtbau is essentially a roadgoing version of a race car, this time the 1992 IMSA SuperCar Champion. Just 86 examples were ever built, each a product of Porsche’s Motorsport division and ready for the track, thanks to drastic weight reduction that sacrificed – among other things – the radio and air conditioning system. Owned by the same family for many years, the car has got less than 1400 miles on the clock and, as a result, is expected to fetch as much as $1,600,000."
