This 30\" x 48\" painting is made from acrylic media on canvas.  The 911 GT1-98, fulfilled Porsche's hopes, taking both first and second place overall thanks to reliability, giving Porsche its record-breaking 16th overall win at Le Mans, more than any other manufacturer in history.  In April 1997, some lucky customers were able to take possession of their road-going 911 GT1, almost a year after the racing version debuted on the track. The technical regulation of the GT1 category required the road production of a minimum number of units. To comply with this rule, Porsche therefore produced a GT1 \"Strassenversion\" (road configuration). The 3163cc engine gave 544 horsepower; the car weighed 1150 kg and was credited with a top speed of over 300 km / h.  The 911 GT1 benefited from several improvements for 1998, which allowed Porsche to return to victory at Le Mans with the McNish / Aiello / Ortelli crew.Greg Stirling started painting in 1980. After going through three decades of self-guided exploration in abstract expressionism, art of the 20th century, and post-war impressionism, he arrived at the door of realism. To continue his area of study, Greg experimented with new techniques, media as well as innovative processes and concepts. Mr. Stirling is also an engineer, kinetic metal sculptor, and automotive enthusiast.A message from the seller: \"This 1998 Porsche 911 GT1 painting is larger than my previous pieces measuring 48 x 30 inches. The photos shown on the wall are to scale.  This painting is the first in a series emphasizing the feeling of speed and motion, and a new technique using spray paint.  The stripes hint at trackside features of grandstands and a nighttime race.  The vapor following the car give the impression of a low pressure vapor trail that follow jet fighters.  I also like the reflection of the wet surface on the pavement, often the case at Le Mans.  A portion of the proceeds from this auction will be donated to the victims of hurricane Ian\"",
