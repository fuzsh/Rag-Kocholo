        "text": "I hope you all enjoy these lovely tunes. Let me know how you get on with the Gr.1 tunes and what their full potential is. I tuned them in mind for the menu book (where 3rd place gets you the 6 star roulette ticket) but I am pretty sure they can win in the right hands.\n\nAfter sorting through my garage and finding all the unfinished tunes left, I have 13 tunes which are ready for tuning. Some are half done, some haven't been touched as yet. A mixed bag of tunes that I'm sure you'll enjoy when I get the time to tune them all up.\n\nI look forward to seeing what you make of the new ones however. Feel free to try them out and leave any feedback on them.\n\nI still have loads of unfinished tunes still to come. Lots of tunes that I am not happy with as yet and definitely need more time. This is the selection I have worked through the past week to get into tip top shape for everyone.\n\nI wish that tuning was not quite as expensive as it is as there are sooo many nice cars in the legend cars which I cannot afford but would love to own. Need to find a new money race. What is everyone using at the moment to make credits fast and simple?\n\nAs always, I would love to get feedback on the tunes published, new and old. Enjoy them all and hopefully I will have another load of tunes ready to go for next week.\n\nI still have loads of unfinished tunes still to come.

Enjoy them all and hopefully I will have another load of tunes ready to go for next week.\n\nHave you tried AFK? I have my personal laptop just sitting on my desk at home and can earn you loads of money with very minimal input. It does go wrong sometimes but that's the advantage of WFH\n\nView attachment 1159218\n\nNice tune, drives like a monkey with its tail on fire. Definitely capable of sub-4:15 laps in the right hands.\n\nDriving a monkey with its tail on fire sounds like fun to me. Glad you enjoyed the tune. Great lap times on the 700pp race.\n\nA little feedback on the Focus... Mainly because those road races with rally cars were getting on my nerves!\n\nWhat can be said about the Focus WRC...? For me it feels amazing on the road tracks!\n\nMain Strong Points:\n\nSuperb handling on asphalt\n\nExcellent agility and quite nimble\n\nGreat mid-cornering grip and exit corner acceleration\n\nMinimum tyre wear (managed to do all 10 laps with the same RH)\n\nVery good FM, managed to do 8/10 laps before refuel\n\nNo body roll present, the car feels correct in balance\n\nOverall superbly tuned\n\nOnly \"negative\" point:\n\nThe front tyres due tend to wear a tiny bit faster, perhaps because of the torque of the car?\n\nDo you mind if I keep posting these small reviews? Have a bunch of your tunes still to try...\n\nView attachment 1159327\n\nThank you for the excellent review. I am more than happy for you to keep posting these kinds of reviews. it’s just like the ones you use to do for gt6. They are always informative and useful. You have a good selection of tunes to test still.\n\nNissan GT-R GT500 '99 (800PP)\n\nRacing Medium Tyres\n\nHello shaun,\n\nA small feedback on the GT500:\n\nTested on Monza WTC800 (10 laps) - Chosen because of fast corners, medium straights and the 2 1st gear chicanes...\n\nChanges to the original tune - Racing Hards\n\nThe GT500 is already pretty good stock as stated, so after these 10 laps the main points:\n\nOn RH, great overall grip!\n\nSuper stable (no oversteer) on exiting the 2 chicanes due to the long 1st gear, unless you drive like a baboon!!\n\nSuperb acceleration out of cornering, despite the 1st and 2nd gear being long ones...\n\nNO mid cornering understeer, this is one the key point, combined with great brake strenght and balance the car does not understeer on the mid-acceleration making it faster and very nimble on the slower corners!! (loved this one!)\n\nGreat fuel saving on FM6 - pitted on lap 6...\n\nGreat tyre wear on the RH - no tyres changed, all 10 laps done with the same;\n\nExcellent rotation of the body on the slower cornering, allowing you to get a bit of advantage on the opponents!\n\nThere are many other features I enjoyed, but can't remember now 'cause was having loads of fun driving!!!\n\nStill have to repeat the race on RM, but I believe the only differences will be the higher grip level and faster wear...\n\nNo \"negative\" points, but a very important note:\n\n- This car is a totally diferent animal once you change the fuel saving settings, meaning, I did the 6 laps on FM6 and the car handles superbly, but after the pitstop changed to FM1 and the beast awoke!! It became a petrol eater and a full tank for the remain 4 laps almost wasn't enough!!\n\nThe car gets lively and the power surge is out of this world, it keeps the grip, but the driving style needs to be adapted to the new power input, therefore the tune has Racing Mediums!!\n\nThis was a long one, but a blast!!\n\nTY!"
