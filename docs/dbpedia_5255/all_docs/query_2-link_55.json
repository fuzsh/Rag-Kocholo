        "text": "\"Sports car\" is a term that defies easy definition, especially in the context of endurance racing. When the BPR (European racing series) started its program of 4-hour enduros for Gran Turismo cars, its aim was to give what the man in the street calls sports cars a chance to compete against one another after having undergone some strictly defined modification to make them raceworthy and safe. To allow some high-grade cars built in numbers too small for homologation in the old FIA GT class (which required a minimum of 200 cars to be produced in 12 months), no minimum production was specified, provided the competing cars were certified for use on public roads. This paved the way into racing for cars from Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Lotus, Venturi, Marcos, McLaren and others, though initially the races were dominated by Porsche 911s of all sorts.\n\nCompletely changing the face of things at the beginning of the 1995 season was the McLaren F1, powered by a 6.1-liter BMW V-12 engine. In nearly standard trim, the car really dwarved the opposition and even won Le Mans outright. Even Porsche had no answer to its domination—within the frame of regulations, the old, faithful 911 just could not match the McLaren’s performance.\n\nThis story originally appeared in the September 1997 issue of Road & Track.\n\nSIGN UP FOR THE TRACK CLUB BY R&T FOR MORE EXCLUSIVE STORIES\n\nFor Porsche, there was only one solution: design an almost completely new car, making the best of the regulations. But here, the normal way of doing things was reversed: Instead of developing a racing car from a production road-going model, the road version was developed from the racing version before being submitted for road certification. And this is what every manufacturer seeking a chance in the GT championship will have to do from now on, whether it intends to produce road versions for sale to rich enthusiasts or not.\n\nPorsche intends to sell a number of road versions; 30 cars have been mentioned at 1,500,000 Deutsche Mark (about $1 million) each if enough customers can be found. Having driven both the racing model and the road version, I can say that the latter is the nearest thing to the racing GT1 that can be driven on the road, preferably the Autobahn.\n\nThough steel rotors (in lieu of the race car’s carbon pieces) reside behind those 18-in. BBS wheels, stopping power is still incredible.\n\nMechanically, the road car replaces the race car’s carbon brake discs with steel discs of the same dimensions. It also has a slightly higher ride height, with less hard (but by no means soft!) springs and shock absorbers, a road- legal exhaust system, gear ratios suitable for traffic as well as fast work and a different state of tune of the water-cooled 3.2-liter twin-turbocharged flat-6 engine, now managed by a Bosch, rather than a TAG, computer. The rims of the 18-in.-diameter BBS light-alloy wheels are a mere half-inch narrower (11 front, 13 rear) than the racing models and are shod with Pirelli P Zero road tires.\n\nThe cockpit is only slightly more civilized. Here we find two adjustable sports seats with integral headrests, upholstered in the finest quality leather. The entire dash panel of the pre-airbag standard 911 is retained almost without modification, including the glovebox. Trim is limited to the footboxes, the integrated rollcage, the doors (with carbon-fiber inner panels) and the firewall, while the floor mats come straight from the standard 911.\n\nBefore I leave Porsche’s Weissach Technical Center, Hartmuth Kristen, the engineer responsible for the development of the road version, lifts the front hood. The space usually dedicated to luggage is filled with two horizontal radiators and fans, the battery, the ABS controller and the engine-management box. Nearer the cockpit is the standard plastic 19.3-gal. fuel tank (not very generous for such a powerful car; the race version has a deformable 26.4-gal. tank) and a simple ventilation system, though air conditioning can be ordered.\n\nThough the basic silhou­ette and dashboard might suggest otherwise, the GT1 has virtually nothing in common with the produc­tion 911. This Porsche’s lucky driver grips a fat 3- spoke Momo wheel and puts the flat-6’s 544 bhp to the road through six ratios selected by that titanium-capped, high-mounted lever. Door panels are of leather-trimmed carbon fiber, exquisitely crafted.\n\nAt the back, where the entire rear body section hinges at the extreme rear of the chassis, any similarity with the standard 911 ends. Here is pure, modern racing technique with tubes rigidly supporting the midship flat-6 engine, almost completely hidden under twin intercoolers and the intake system with cooling air from the intake above the windshield. From the engine, the torque is transmitted through a single­ plate clutch with sintered metal linings to the 6-speed gearbox overhanging the 40/60 limited-slip differential (40 percent locked under power and 60 percent locked when the throttle is released, helping make the car more pointable with the accelerator pedal). The entire unit is rigidly mounted on the tubular girder that is part of the welded-in rollcage, and the rear suspension is anchored to the gearbox and differential housings. Except for its ratios and an oil pump circulating the lubricant through a heat exchanger, the racing gearbox’s innards are similar to those of Porsche’s current G50 box.\n\nThe 5.3-cu.-ft. luggage compartment required by the regulations is in the tail, right above the gearbox.\n\nA car-lover’s community for ultimate access & unrivaled experiences. JOIN NOW\n\nThough the racing car’s steering wheel is removable (it is a safety requirement), the road version’s is not, and one chassis tube has been curved to ease entry and exit. This does not mean the exercise can be performed as easily as in an S-Class Mercedes' or even a 911; some talent for contortionism is a great help. Slam the door shut (initially, two or three tries are necessary because the lightweight Kevlar door has so little inertia), adjust the seat for reach, and any 911 old hand finds himself in familiar surroundings, except for the attractive, bagless Momo three-spoke steering wheel. The beautifully styled gear lever (with a titanium accent on top) sits high on its console and operates the gearbox directly through a rod running between the seats.\n\nTurn the key—in its usual place, left of the steering column— and the engine springs to life, with valve clatter and gear rumble invading the cockpit. The rigidly mounted powertrain does nothing to reduce the decibels, despite the efforts of the firewall’s thin padding or the twin-mass flywheel, particular to the Strasseversion. Idle speed is about 850 rpm, amazingly low for a near racing engine.\n\nScoop above windshield delivers air to the twin-turbo flat-6 that’s anchored amidships by an elaborate tubular structure. Suspension differs only in tuning from race-car setup.\n\nDown goes the clutch pedal— which, by supercar standards, is not particularly heavy— in goes 1st gear, the gates open, and I leave Weissach and head toward the lightly traveled Wurzburg Autobahn. But before reaching the open road, I have 40 miles of busy traffic to contend with— and a 75-mph speed limit. These are surely not the best conditions to drive a GT1. The noise inside the car seems to be completely inappropriate for such a low speed, even if I drive at some 15 percent over the limit, as everyone does. In 6th gear with the engine running at less than 3,000 rpm, the car seems undergeared! I wonder who would want a radio in this car, even though at this speed, it is not music that comes from behind!\n\nWhile I trundle along, I try to understand the beast. The power-assisted steering is very high geared, and its response very quick. I am sure the ratio has not been changed from the racing car’s and the assist is quite moderate; I am glad it is there when speeds are low, but at higher speeds it does not in the least interfere with the feel.\n\nEven on the Autobahn, the suspension feels harsh but the comfort is quite acceptable, probably because the driver and passenger are seated near the center of the wheelbase.\n\nWe reach the junction of the Wurzburg Autobahn, where the road is slick with rain. As the “free speed” sign appears, I shift to 3rd, and the electronically controlled twin turbos quickly raise the boost to its 14.7-psi maximum. The big tires, helped by the downforce created by the large rear wing, grip the wet pavement and the tachometer needle soars toward the red zone (which, strangely, starts at 6,600 rpm, 400 below peak revs). A pull on the gear lever, in goes 4th and the fierce acceleration continues. The synchro-mesh is wonderful: I can’t remember any gearbox of another really powerful car in which the shifts are that quick.\n\nAs this goes on, the noise increases proportionally, but the noise quality improves too, a purely mechanical sound that’s heard because the exhaust is so quiet. The intervention of the twin turbos working in parallel (not sequentially as in the fabulous Porsche 959) is very progressive, and the huge power is easily controlled, turbo lag being reduced to a barely perceptible minimum. But it must be remembered that the engine’s capacity is only 3.2 liters and that it wants to be revved to develop its massive 442 lb-ft of torque (at 4,250 rpm) and its 544 bhp at 7,000. No boost gauge is provided, but when accelerating from the lower ranges, you feel the pressure build up around 3,600 rpm; from about 4,000 rpm in the lower gears, flooring the accelerator catapults the GT1 forward. Thanks to the excellent synchromesh, turbo lag due to lengthy shifts is never felt, well demonstrated by the 0-125-mph time of 10.5 seconds obtained by the German magazine Auto, Motor und Sport.\n\nIn maximum speed, the Porsche is not the fastest supercar. The Weissach team realizes that speeds of well over 300 km/h (187 mph) are of no practical interest in today’s traffic and that engine responsiveness and high-speed stability are more important. Consequently, priority has been given to drag-increasing downforce obtained by ground effects and the large rear wing, flexibility being obtained (at the cost of maximum speed) by deliberate undergearing. This is why the maximum speed quoted by the factory is “only” 193 mph.\n\nEven more impressive than the Por­sche’s power to go is the car’s power to stop. The combination of huge brakes, well-tuned ABS, enormous tires and downforce (which increases as the square of the speed) allows for deceleration well over l.0g from 62 mph, and Porsche engineers claim that a deceleration of 1.8g has been recorded from 174 mph. Thanks to its high-pressure hydraulic booster inherited from the Porsche Turbo and Carrera 4, such stops do not require a Herculean push on the pedal, though it is firm enough to allow easy modulation.\n\nGetting the best out of the GT1 on less-than-perfect secondary roads re­quires more than usual concentration. The wide, very precise Pirelli P Zeros, the hard suspension and the strong anti-roll bars combine to make the car very sensitive to the irregularities of the road surface, at the cost of straight-line stability. The quick steering was a help here when the rear wheels were asked to transmit more driving force than the grip allowed, causing several power slides on the wet roads. Drivers not used to such quick steering should take care not to over­ correct, which could easily get them into trouble. Don’t forget this is a racing car modified just enough to meet the law and to provide the adequate reliability and driveability required in today’s traffic.\n\nDriveability in general is probably the most astonishing feature of the Porsche. Only the clutch requires a little delicacy when gently starting from rest, as the sintered metal linings grip rather firmly. The width of the car (76.8 in.) should be remembered, and the very thick windshield pillars integrating the rollcage hinder your view when it comes to sharp turns. But the engine is a model of tractability, readily pulling away from 900 rpm (about 25 mph) in 6th without protest.\n\nEven in its road version, the Porsche 911 GT1 is a much closer parent to a racing car than a road car. At its price, Porsche could have certainly made it more comfortable, provided it with more noise-absorbing material and made it an altogether more usable road car than it is without significantly compromising its performance. But that misses the point: The GT1 will be bought for the pleasure of driving the closest possible thing to a full-blooded, very high performance racing car. And where can this best be enjoyed? On a racetrack, possibly in club racing.\n\nIt is with this in mind that, while making the GT1 fully roadworthy, Porsche has preserved as much as possible the racing model’s raceworthiness and character."
