        "text": "[Not a valid template]\n\nAll this is moot however without the homologised version, an avenue into which the snappily named 911 GT1 Straßenversion (‘Street Legal’) stepped in 1997. Save a different paint finish, softer suspension, more practical/less ferocious gear ratios, leather seats and – good grief – floor mats, the GT1’s roadgoing counterpart boasted little difference. It was a technical mastery, but to drive? Well, like most late 80s/early 90s supercars, it was terrible. Suspension so stiff drivers were often paralysed from the waist down before they’d even rolled off the driveway, the 600+bhp flat-six with the best part of 460lb ft of torque stood more chance of tipping the earth from its gravitational pull than pulling gently away from traffic lights, and while the race-hewn handling was deliciously precise, unbelievably heavy steering meant performing a full lock required more than one person in the car to help. Though less of these examples wound up mounting lampposts and roundabouts than their less-expensive turbo 911 brethren in the late-90s, the GT1 was a 911 most definitely in name and nature.\n\nEven if you were able to afford the then-asking price of $900,000(ish) without mortgaging the house and selling vital organs to children’s hospitals, the chances of scuffing the lowered end plates, curbing the M3-value alloys or chipping the paint on the gullwing doors left most owners in the foetal position before they’d turned the 3163cc unit over.\n\nOf course like most 90s supercars it had one pretty key feature going for it: looks. The GT1 may not have achieved the success of its forbears, but beautifully sweeping lines, the famous ‘egg yoke’ headlights (which unfortunately were replaced for the road models) and a gorgeous three-quarter profile means the 911 GT1 remains one of the prettiest Porsches ever developed. Let’s not forget that iconic Mobil livery either.\n\nGiven its history, it seems apt that this 911 GT1 – one of only 25 produced (two of 993 derivation, the remainder 996) – should make one of its rare outings at the Bahrain International Circuit, a feature on the World Endurance Championship calendar of which the 24 Hours of Le Mans is the headliner. One last run before Porsche’s next Le Mans contender hits the Middle East with a certain Mark Webber behind the wheel.\n\nOut of the shadows for one day. Surely the 911 GT1 deserves that at least."
