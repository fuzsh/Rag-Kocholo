The 1998 Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion - abbreviated as "Porsche 996 GT1" or "Porsche 911 GT1" - is a rear-wheel drive supercar by Porsche.

It appears in Forza Motorsport 2 as part of the December Car Pack and Forza Motorsport 3. It returns in Forza Motorsport 7 and all subsequent main series titles, as well as Forza Street.

Synopsis[]

The successor to the Porsche 959, the 911 GT1 Strassenversion - German for road version - was designed to homologate the Porsche 911 GT1-98 racing car of which 20 units were built. It received a successor in 2003, the Porsche Carrera GT.[1]

The 911 GT1 Strassenversion was developed from the 911 GT1-98 race car, with headlights derived from the 996-codenamed Porsche 911. Two other 911 GT1 Strassenversions, one delivered in early 1996 to the German government for compliance testing and another delivered to Bahrain-based private collector Khalid Abdul Rahim, use headlights from the 993-codenamed Porsche 911 instead.

Detuned to meet European emissions laws, the 3.2L flat-6 engine, equipped with twin turbochargers, made 536 hp (400 kW) and 443 ft·lb (600 N·m) at 7,200 rpm, which proved to be more than adequate for the car. Power was sent to the rear wheels via a six-speed manual gearbox.
