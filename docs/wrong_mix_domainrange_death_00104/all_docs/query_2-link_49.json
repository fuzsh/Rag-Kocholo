        "text": "Call for Book Chapter Proposals\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan: Haunting American Populism for 100 Years\n\nOne-page proposals are invited from communication, rhetoric, and other humanities scholars. This is the final call for proposals. The book project is proceeding smoothly; other authors are encouraged to submit a proposal in a timely fashion. Contributions from senior faculty, independent scholars, and graduate students alike are encouraged.\n\nThe timeliness of a fresh look at the Bryan political tradition is palpable. As America braces itself for the 2024 presidential election, National Public Radio’s recent headline pulls us back a century: “Ghost of William Jennings Bryan haunts Trump's next run for the White House.” Ron Elving, Senior Editor and Correspondent on the Washington Desk for NPR News, explained that:\n\nWe are likely to see that linkage between Trump and Bryan again in the 2024 election cycle. We can be sure Trump will continue striving to strike the populist chord as a candidate. Beyond that, if a nominated Trump failed to win the popular vote for a third time, he would match the record of Bryan, who lost the popular vote for the White House in 1896, 1900 and 1908.\n\nThe similarities with current events, in fact, are striking. Both Bryan and Trump articulate a populist vision, advocating for the common man while being anything but working-class. Both enjoy a quixotic cult of personality (especially among white nationalists). Both articulate a not-quite-orthodox religion that feels familiar to conservative Protestants. And both use a commanding rhetorical delivery that captivates listeners. Nonetheless, the contrasts between the two visions separated by a century are distinct and perhaps grow from different historic ground.\n\nScholars have connected Trump and Bryan since at least 2015. The distinguished American teacher, historian and writer Bernard A. Weisberger observed in early 2016 that “the rebellions in both parties this year mark an uprising against our second Gilded Age, with excesses greater than ever.” Trump ally Steve Bannon used his speaking time at 2017’s C-PAC meeting by drawing parallels between Bryan’s and Trump’s speech style and campaign tactics. Campaign 2016 and Campaign 2020 were both, as Weisberger predicted, “outrageous, passionate and wastefully, tragically expensive.” Campaign 2024 appears to be on course to deliver the same.\n\nWith William Jennings Bryan as a touchpoint to understand our current public sphere and with 2025 marking the centennial anniversary of the (in)famous Scopes Trial, as well as Mr. Bryan’s death, scholars must reckon with William Jennings Bryan’s rhetorical legacy and the way it haunts our current public sphere.\n\nChapter proposals should describe potential 3,500 – 4,000-word essays that explicitly examine issues related to the sway and influence of William Jennings Bryan, three-time presidential nominee for the Democrat party and contemporary religious, political, social, and other themes. Proposed chapters that treatments the (in)famous Scopes “Monkey” Trial are explicitly solicited.\n\nFull title: William Jennings Bryan: Haunting American Populism for 100 Years\n\nEditors:\n\nDaniel S. Brown, Jr., Ph.D. (Louisiana State University), Independent Researcher Noblesville, Indiana, USA. DrDSBrown@gmail.com\n\nCamille K. Lewis, Ph.D. (Indiana University), Greenville, SC. camille.lewis@furman.edu\n\nPublisher: TBD – A university or other scholarly press with a record of successful publication and marketing of texts related to communication, politics, and religion.\n\nDescription: William Jennings Bryan: Haunting American Populism for 100 years is envisioned by the editors to be an essential reader that examines contemporary communicative issues that emerged during Mr. Bryan’s political career and continue to inform twenty-first century politics. These issues include religious, political, social, and other arenas that link Mr. Bryan’s legacy as an orator and politician to our contemporary moment. Again, chapter topics related broadly to Bryan and the Scopes Trial are welcomed.\n\nSend proposals and inquiries to either (or both) of the editors at the email addresses above. Proposals for chapters should include the following: a one-page, single-spaced chapter proposal and a brief c.v. (or alternatively a one-paragraph biographical statement) from the prospective author(s).\n\nTentative schedule for publication"
