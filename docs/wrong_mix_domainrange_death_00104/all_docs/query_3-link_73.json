        "text": "William Jennings Bryan Jr., of Gladstone, passed away unexpectedly, on 25th of February, 2019.\n\nBill was born on the 16th of August, 1962, in Gladstone, to William J. and Shirley (Anderson) Bryan.\n\nGrowing up a proud “East Ender”, Bill was a legend at the Gladstone “Rec”. Year in and year out, Bill could be found tearing up the Ping Pong tournaments. Summers were spent swimming in Little Bay de Noc, fishing and working at the Gladstone Dairy Flo with his lifelong friends.\n\nAfter Graduating from Gladstone High in 1980, Bill moved to California and enlisted in the United States Navy, becoming a nuclear reactor operator on the carrier, USS Carl Vinson.\n\nOn Valentine’s Day, 1983, he married his childhood love Barbara Weycker, welcoming daughters Candice in 1984 and Amanda in 1989.\n\nFollowing the birth of their daughter Amanda, the family moved to Minneapolis. Bill received a Civil Engineering degree from the University of Minnesota and operated his own consulting firm.\n\nIn 2008, Barb and Bill decided to return to the California sunshine and split their time between Gladstone and The San Francisco Bay area.\n\nBill was an avid golfer and hit the links, in the U.P. and California, at every opportunity with his closest friends. A food and wine enthusiast, Bill was known to always pick the right vintage for the meals he was passionate about cooking. Meals which (usually) turned out deliciously.\n\nIn addition to his loving wife Barbara, Bill is survived by:\n\nDaughters: Candice (Dale) Eberly\n\nAmanda (Eric Savage) Bryan\n\nSisters: Genie Gillis and Vicki Kasper\n\nGranddaughters: Christianna and Charlotte\n\nBill is further survived by his nieces, nephews, cousins and many close friends.\n\nBill’s parents, William and Shirley, preceded him in death.\n\nBill’s family will receive friends on Saturday, from 2:00PM to 4:00PM, at the Skradski Funeral Home in Gladstone. Military rites will follow visiting hours, followed by funeral services with Pastor Diane Srutowski of Trinity Lutheran Church in Stonington officiating. A celebration of Bill’s life will follow at the Gladstone Yacht Club.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be directed to St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. Envelopes will be available throughout visiting hours. Bill will be laid to rest in the Gardens of Rest Cemetery in the spring."
