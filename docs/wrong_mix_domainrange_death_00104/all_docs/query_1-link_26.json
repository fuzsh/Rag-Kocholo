        "text": "William Jennings Bryan\n\nHave you ever tried to accomplish something and failed? How about trying something three times and failing? That can be very discouraging. But William Jennings Bryan did not become discouraged when he ran for president three times and failed three timesin 1896, 1900 and 1908. He remained one of the most influential men in America, and presidents envied his popularity.\n\nBryan was born in Salem, Illinois, in 1860. He studied law in Chicago. In 1890 he won a seat in the United States Congress.\n\nBryan's great talent was oration. He made speeches about his progressive views on a graduated income tax, regulating child labor, and woman's suffrage. Because he was such a powerful speaker, everyone listened whether they agreed with him or not.\n\nAt the 1896 Democratic Convention, Bryan swept up the nomination with his famous \"Cross of Gold\" speech. He was only thirty-six years old, which is very young for a presidential candidate. He campaigned all over the country by train. He made hundreds of speeches. But he lost to William McKinley who stayed in Ohio and campaigned from his front porch.\n\nBryan did not give up. He ran for president two more times. In 1900 he lost again to McKinley. In 1908 he lost to Theodore Roosevelt. When Woodrow Wilson became president in 1912, he appointed Bryan secretary of state. He resigned when the sinking of Lusitania moved the country closer to war with Germany. Bryan was a pacifisthe did not believe in going to war. But he supported the war effort when the United States entered World War I.\n\nBryan believed in the Bible in a literal sensethat what it says is exactly what it means. When a Tennessee teacher, John T. Scopes, went on trial for teaching the theory of evolution (that the human race began as apes, not as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden as the Bible records), Bryan volunteered to prosecute him. With Bryan's powerful defense of Tennessee law and the Bible, the teacher was found guilty. Shortly after the trial, Bryan died at the age of sixty-five.\n\nAlthough he never became president, Bryan was a major political figure who held great influence over public opinion for thirty years."
