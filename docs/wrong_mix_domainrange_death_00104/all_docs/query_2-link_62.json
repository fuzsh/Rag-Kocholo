One such meeting took place in Clarendon County.  Dorn opens his address with anecdote about name recognition.  In his Congressional days, a fellow congressman from Florida, Billy Matthews, enlisted Dorn to help campaign for him around Matthews' home state. Dorn explains that  he did not know how popular William Jennings Bryan was in Florida.  Matthews did, and his constituents assumed there was a family relationship between Dorn and the late William Jennings Bryan.",
