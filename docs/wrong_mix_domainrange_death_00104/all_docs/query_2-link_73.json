His death does not alter the record; to convert the sympathy we feel for his family and his friends into any sort of pretense that we think he was a good influence upon his generation would be to rob a thirty years’ struggle of its meaning. Mr. Bryan had many virtues. He was simple. He was accessible. He was resolute. He had the common touch. But the battle with Bryanism has not been a sham battle. And so as we salute a fallen foe we cannot turn the story of that battle into a farce by constructing a eulogy that no follower of his could wish to hear us speak."
