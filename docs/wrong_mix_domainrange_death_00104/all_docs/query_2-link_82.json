        "text": "Shortly after the conclusion of the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial – officially, the case of State of Tennessee versus John Thomas Scopes, the National Book Company (Cincinnati, Ohio) published transcripts of the trial. Under the title, The World’s Most Famous Court Trial: Tennessee Evolution Case, this claimed to be a “complete stenographic record”.
