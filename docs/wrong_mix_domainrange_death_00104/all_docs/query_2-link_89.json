        "text": "(Also @David T , having read your post, I'm curious who the 16 candidates were. Would you happen to know, and if you do could you post them here?)\n\nUnfotunately, David Sarasohn (*The Party of Reform*) doesn't give most of their names (apart from Johnson and Wilson) merely observing as I noted that they were mostly \"too old, too obscure, too southern, or too conservative--or else were Bryanites unlikely to challenge their leader.\"\n\nIncidentally, Pulitzer allowed George Harvey to write an anonymous editorial in favor of Wilson as one of the possibiities, indicating how conservative both Harvey and Wilson were in 1908 (Harvey would remain so):\n\n***\n\nDissociated opposition (to Bryan) will no longer suffice. There must arise a real leader around whom all Democrats uninfected by Populism, and thousands of dissatisfied Republicans, may rally. .. The man's principles must be sound. He must be a defender of the Constitution, but not the worshipper of a fetish. He must realize that 'a return to the old ways' of government by Plutocracy, Privilege, Protection and Plunder is impossible; that the moral regeneration begun in violence must be completed in sobriety. . . . He must detest, on principle, any taxing of the people beyond the actual requirements of their government. He must favor immediate reduction of the tariff. He must be a hater in equal measure of paternalism and Socialism. He must set his face like flint against government ownership of railroads, initiative and referendum, government guaranty of deposits, and all other Populistic notions. He must demand from all corporations publicity, obedience to law, and recognition of the rights of the whole people, but he must also observe the obligations of the State to protect its own artificial creation in all legitimate and authorized undertakings. He must favor the singling out and rigorous punishment of individual wrongdoers, not merely the fining of an impersonal corporation. He must be a radical conserver, not a destroyer of both public and private credit. He must be an opponent of imperialism, militarism and jingoism. He must prefer too little government to too much government, and must insist unceasingly upon rigid application of the basic principle of government of the people through their authorized repre sentatives in Congress in preference to any government by commissions.\" '\n\nEditorial, New York World, January 18, 1908, quoted in Sam Hanna Acheson, *Joe Baliey, The Last Democrat, * pp.299-300.\n\nRacist, yes (as was TR). But he actually thought it was a good thing the Confederacy had been defeated:\n\nI disagree. If he thought the South's defeat was a good thing, he would have supported the needed reforms to the class system and the economy. He would not have misrepresented the issues of the war as he did.\n\n\"But I am conscious that there is one point at which Mr. Bright may seem to you to stand in need of defence. He was from the very first a resolute opponent of the cause of the Southern Confederacy. Will you think that I am undertaking an invidious task, if I endeavor to justify him in that opposition? I yield to no one precedence in love for the South. But because I love the South, I rejoice in the failure of the Confederacy. Suppose that secession had been accomplished? Conceive of this Union as divided into two separate and independent sovereignties ! To the seaports of her northern neighbor the Southern Confederacy could have offered no equals; with her industries she could have maintained no rivalry; to her resources she could have supplied no parallel. The perpetuation of slavery would, beyond all question, have wrecked our agricultural and commercial interests, at the same time that it supplied a fruitful source of irritation abroad and agitation within. We cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that slavery was enervating our Southern society and exhausting to Southern energies. \" https://books.google.com/books?id=0RTVAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA56\n\n(^^^) Did I mention that Wilson was a liar in print? Especially in his self serving public papers.\n\nWoodrow Wilson’s Civil War — Woodrow Wilson\n\nIn his marginal notes on a book by James E. Therold Rogers, Woodrow Wilson wrote in 1880, in shorthand: To me the Civil War and its terrible scenes are but a memory of a short day. I have reached maturity at a time when the passions it stirred have cooled and when it is possible even for those w\n\nTo me the Civil War and its terrible scenes are but a memory of a short day. I have reached maturity at a time when the passions it stirred have cooled and when it is possible even for those who were actual participants in its transactions to judge its issues without heat and almost without prejudice. In this calmer period I can clearly see that the suffering of the Confederacy was an inestimable [?] blessing, that the doctrine of states rights was a danger settled, and that the abolition of slavery was, even for us, a lasting benefit.\n\nThat manure was written in 1880.\n\nOn Apr 24, 1877: Federal Troops Leave South, Ending ...\n\nHence... the bleatings of someone who was within three years of the withdrawal of federal troops and the formal end of \"reconstruction\" putting forth that tripe is more in line with someone who writes for a northern audience, what he thinks they want to read.\n\nWoodrow Wilson only shows his true self when he thinks it is safe. Try World War I and its aftermath for the genuine rat bastard.\n\nWhich doesn't mean that he didn't believe it himself.\n\nHis writings do not indicate that he was inconsistent between core belief and act and his public duplicity to hide his core beliefs which drove his acts. The most famous two examples are; of his lying about state's rights as a core political principle argument in his scholarly writings as the historical driver behind the United States' political irreconcilables, when it was a purely convenient post- defeat emergent argument that the slavocrats class and their defenders seized upon to divest and divert their basic treason and crimes against humanity against the people of the United States that those bastards perpetrated.\n\nThe other was his public praise of \"The Birth of a Nation\", in which he praised a false depiction in art of the perpetuation of and post war operation of the terrorism and gangsterism which underpinned the continued efforts by the slavocrats to maintain their rights and privileges after the war should have decommed their basic economic and political system which they exploited to establish their class positions in the first place.\n\nThird proof; when he thought he could get away with it; Wilson applied those same core beliefs to revert federal government policy and custom (still unequal and racist but far less than so when his administration finished) against the hiring and promotion of people of color in federal employ.\n\nAs the case of Andrew Johnson illustrates, it was perfectly possible to to be both impeccably Unionist *and* incorrigibly racist.\n\nBUT Andrew Johnson can be better explained historically by his hatred of the slavocrats and by extension their privileged position they maintained through the owning and exploitation of human beings, including, as he believed, the poor white southern farmer.\n\nThe contradiction is somewhat more subtle in Andrew Johnson's case and while his racism is indefensible, it is less hypocritical, more culture learned and based, and less of a hidden lie, for he was quite open about his declarations, than Wilson ever was.\n\nDid I mention that not only was Wilson a liar and a hypocrite, but he was a coward, which Andrew Johnson most assuredly was not?\n\nThe other was his public praise of \"The Birth of a Nation\",\n\nOf course everyone \"knows\" he praised \"Birth of a Nation\" as like \"history written with lightning\". But did he? (Wilson always claimed that the screening was just a favor to Thomas Dixon as an old friend.) I'll quote an old post of mine at https://www.alternatehistory.com/fo...te-woodrow-wilson.402116/page-2#post-13471264\n\n***\n\nDid Wilson praise \"Birth of a Nation\"? It seems extremely doubtful.\n\n\"The viewing before the president, chief justice and various cabinet members occurred on the evening of February 18. There is a tradition that the President said to Thomas Dixon after the presentation, \"It is like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.\" The problem is that this quotation first appears in print in 1937 without attribution. Dixon did not quote Wilson to this effect in his memoirs. The only surviving person at the viewing in 1977 told Arthur Link that Wilson seemed lost in thought during the showing, and that he walked out of the room without saying a word when the movie was over.\" http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrow...Hvdng&user=&pw=\n\nRichard Schickel in *D. W. Griffith: An American Life*, says on page 619 that while he accepts the attributed quote (\"perhaps the most famous words ever spoken about a film\"), \"Yet no one has been able to fully authenticate it. In print, so far as I can determine, its provenance is based entirely on secondary sources.\" https://books.google.com/books?id=-YFNfV5fRDgC&pg=PA619\n\nMoreover, three years after the alleged praise, Wilson wrote to Joseph Tumulty that \"I have always felt that this was a very unfortunate production and I wish most sincerely that its production might be avoided, particularly in communities where there are so many colored people.\" https://books.google.com/books?id=4N3EeOX0w44C&pg=PT271\n\n***\n\nBut, you may say, didn't Dixon repeatedly quote Wilson's history of the US in his intertitles? He did, but in a *very* distorted form:\n\n\"Clearly, Grifﬁth believed it in his interest to have the president appear to legitimate the “history” in Birth. This explains both the special showing of the ﬁlm at the White House and the quotations form Wilson's earlier historical work. An examination of the intertitles and what Wilson had actually written suggests, however, that Griffith was at the very least rather inexact in the quotations he used and that, in each case, his selective excerpts altered to a degree the original meaning...Although Wilson plainly sympathized to a considerable degree with the South (he had grown up in Virginia), his *History* was in reality much more balanced in his discussion of Reconstruction than Griffith would have wished....\" Melvyn Stokes, *D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation: A History of the Most Controversial Motion Picture of All Time,* p. 198. https://books.google.com/books?id=fGJFpiTjbKwC&pg=PA198\n\n\"According to Wilson, it was the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery by the House of Representatives, not the restoration of white supremacy in the South, that marked the real beginnings of American nationhood (\"Men dreamed...that they had that day seen a new nation born'.) \"He blamed the early difficulties facing the freedmen on the fact that slavery had encouraged their habits of dependence. To Wilson, the establishment of the Freedmen's Bureau in March 1865 had been unavoidable: the plight of former slaves, many of them refugees, meant that it had become 'obviously necessary that, for a time at least, Congress should take care of the negroes under the direct supervision and care of the government.' Wilson agreed that most Southern states were mismanaged by corrupt radical governments—his statistics on South Carolina's fallen taxable values and rising taxes were taken straight from [James] Pike--and that huge debts were accumulated. But he also anticipated later 'revisionist' arguments by emphasizing that corruption in the South was in no sense unique: there were many comparable scandals (Credit mobilier, the Whiskey Ring) in the North. Wilson was also surprisingly understanding toward the motives of members of the Republican Party who imposed Reconstruction on the defeated South; he pointed out that some supported the radical program despite their misgivings because they felt it necessary to do something to protect African Americans and to prevent the old leaders of the South from returning to power, and he also absolved the Republicans from implementing a deliberate plan to ruin the South.\n\n\"Where Wilson differed most from Griffith was in his treatment of the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan had been, Wilson observed, 'a very tempting and dangerous instrument of power for days of disorder and social upheaval.' In the beginning, 'sober men' had advised upon and curbed the activities of the hooded order. As time went on, however, such control proved increasingly impossible to exercise as the Klan was drawn deeper and deeper 'into the ways of violence and outlawry. 'Men of hot passions who could not always be restrained,' Wilson commented, 'carried their plans into effect. Reckless men not of their order, malicious fellows of the baser sort who did not feel the compulsions of honor and who had private grudges to satisfy, imitated their disguises and borrowed their methods.' The number of abuses grew: 'Brutal crimes were committed; the innocent suffered with the guilty; a reign of terror was brought on, and society was infinitely more disturbed than defended.' In contrast with Griffith's later film, which depicted the Klan as rescuing white women from the threat posed by black men, Wilson made it clear that the Klan itself arracked female targets. 'The more ardent regulators,' he wrote, 'made no nice discriminations. All northern white men or women who came into the South to work among the negroes, though they were but school teachers, were in danger of their enmity and silent onset.' According to Wilson, the Klan was deeply unchivalrous. It was also shortlived and relatively unsuccessful. Instead of overthrowing Radical regimes and restoring white suprmeacy by force, as *The Birth of a Nation* suggested, the original Klan had been effectively destroyed by new federal laws of 1870 and 1871 and the determined actions of President Grant..\" https://books.google.com/books?id=fGJFpiTjbKwC&pg=PA200"
