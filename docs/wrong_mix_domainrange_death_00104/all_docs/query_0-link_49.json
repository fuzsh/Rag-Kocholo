        "text": "A young millionaire has revealed the insane reason men cannot stop giving her money.\n\nAt just 26 years old, Grace claims she has already made over $2.4 million and owns a lucrative property portfolio worth over $1.5 million.\n\nThe Melbourne adult content creator – known online as ‘Grace Wears Lace’ – is living the life of her dreams being financially independent and jetting around the world.\n\nWhile she works regularly to create content for her subscription site, she also manages to top up her bank account through one kink that she had never even heard of until recently.\n\nGrace is a now a findom, or financial dominatrix. For most men she is involved with, this is as simple as them sending her cash to buy a nice dinner or coffee.\n\n“I have a lot of married men in contact with me and I know that I am a secret from a lot of wives and girlfriends,” Grace told news.com.au.\n\n“Sometimes I’ll be on a call with them and their spouses will come home and they’ll cut off the call midway.\n\n“I’ve sent underwear to married men, or they’ve paid a high price for my phone number so that it is more personal.\n\n“But often they’ll just send cash for no reason at all. Guys will often pay for my dinners, coffees or petrol.”\n\nOne Melbourne fan has taken his adoration of Grace so far that he has let her have complete control and access to his bank account – despite the pair never meeting.\n\nThe anonymous man, who simply goes by ‘Slave Dave’, is reportedly a mid-20s Australian teacher who loves being Grace’s ‘pay pig’ – a term used to describe a psychological kink where a submissive participant provides another person with money.\n\nDave will often beg Grace to drain his bank account and said that despite often struggling to pay for bills, he would not have it any other way.\n\n“I ended up having to change careers to something higher paying so I could continue paying Grace more,” he said.\n\n“I went down a bad path and sent money to other girls during that time. To make up for it, I made the decision to completely hand over my bank account logins, my debit card details and even my emails to Grace, to monitor and make sure every dollar I earned was going toward her.\n\n“I’ve lived with her completely ruling over my life and finances for the last couple of years, and I couldn’t be more content.\n\n“I go to work every day knowing my paycheck is going toward Grace to pay for her nails, hair, clothes, food, gifts. Anything she wants at all.\n\n“With the allowance she leaves me, I’m able to get food and petrol to get through the weeks.”\n\nGrace has raked in $50,000 from the financial arrangement she has with Dave alone.\n\n“I have never seen Dave in person or have any idea what he looks like,” Grace explained.\n\n“I know that he’s single and that he is a teacher, but we never talk about his personal life.\n\n“The first time Dave gave me access to his bank account I was thinking ‘there’s no way this is going to actually work’ but it did.\n\n“I logged in and sent myself money and it started from there. I had never personally heard of this kink before talking to him, I still cannot believe this is such a popular kink for a lot of people.”\n\nThe pair’s arrangement is completely consensual. In response to claims she might be “taking advantage”, Grace explained that both parties get something out of it.\n\n“Anyone who thinks I am taking advantage of him is just jealous and wished they could do this too,” she said.\n\n“Dave begs me for it and is so happy after a wallet drain. I’ve never forced him.\n\n“It is quite the contrary, it makes him happy, and I benefit so why the hell wouldn’t I do this?\n\n“Dave trusts I would never screw him over or take too much that he couldn’t afford to live. We also chat about his expenses and bills to make it work the best mutually.”\n\nGrace has been an adult star for the last five years and says she has loved every moment of it, with no plans of stopping yet.\n\nShe says she is the epitome of ‘good girl gone bad’, with her prior life dedicated to the church due to her strict, religious upbringing.\n\n“Every day I find out about new kinks and I’m very kink friendly on my platform,” she said.\n\n“I love that I provide a safe space for people to have fun and enjoy themselves.\n\n“I wouldn’t change anything about my life. I’m very proud of how far I’ve come and how hard I work.”"
