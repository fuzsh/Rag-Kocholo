        "text": "See my post at\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/soc.history.what-if/q0N9PcXBl4s/aePaSHpmPzUJ\n\n***\n\nWe had a somewhat extended discussion of a Bryan administration at\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/browse_thread/thread/5a4a22cfafdeff41\n\nHere I'll just make a few points:\n\n(1) Assuming that Bryan does succeed in instituting free silver (whether a\n\nnarrowly elected Bryan could get it through Congress is an open question)\n\nthe best discussion of the likely economic effects is by Noel Maurer (now\n\nof Harvard Business School--one of the few economists who has ever\n\ncontributed to this newsgroup) at\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/msg/19c1be1c62862260\n\nHe agrees with me that Bryan would be introducing free silver at the wrong\n\ntime (as I put it, \"There was a case for it throughout the long, generally\n\ndeflationary period between the 'Crime of 1873' and 1896. But now with\n\nthe cyanide process and the discovery of gold in South Africa, the\n\nKlondike, etc., gold production was increasing, and free silver would only\n\nadd to inflation.\") but thinks it would be only mildly inflationary, and\n\nprobably would not harm the economy (though he acknowledges that there is\n\nsome danger of loss of investor confidence). So I doubt *very* much that\n\nBryan is going to extend the depression \"all the way to 1903.\" And that\n\nputs the idea that he will be a one-term president in some doubt--he may\n\nbe able to claim some credit for the recovery: even though *we* know it\n\nwould have happened without him, all the voters of 1900 would know was\n\nthat there was a depression under the conservative gold-standard Cleveland\n\nand there was a recovery under the \"radical\" Bryan.\n\n(2) The notion that Bryan would have objected to the Spanish-American War\n\nas \"imperialism\" is a confusion between the war itself and one of its OTL\n\nresults--the acquisition of the Philippines. Many people (in the\n\nBryanite silver camp and elsewhere) favored the former--regarding it as a\n\njust war for the liberation of Cuba--and opposed the latter. Bryan would\n\nhave favored an independent Philippine republic--though of course he could\n\nsupport US naval bases there (and in Cuba). As Bryan's career as\n\nSecretary of State after 1913 showed, his opposition to a formal colonial\n\nempire for the US didn't necessarily mean that he opposed all US\n\nintervention in places like the Caribbean.\n\n(3) Not enough attention is usually given to Bryan's likely domestic\n\npolicy in areas other than free silver. As I noted at\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/msg/b989f95239596484\n\n\"[W]hile it is certainly true that Bryan and the Democrats concentrated on\n\nfree silver in the 1896 campaign, one should not forget that the\n\nDemocratic platform--while of course not as radical as the Populists'--was\n\nby no means restricted to free silver. It called for an income tax and for\n\n'the enlargement of the powers of the Inter-State Commerce Commission and\n\nsuch restrictions and guarantees in the control of railroads as will\n\nprotect the people from robbery and oppression,' and denounced high\n\ntariffs, 'government by injunction,' and \"[t]he absorption of wealth by\n\nthe few, the consolidation of our leading railroad systems and the\n\nformation of trusts and pools.'\n\nhttp://projects.vassar.edu/1896/chicagoplatform.html\n\n\"Some comments on the Chicago platform from conservatives:\n\n\"'No wild-eyed and rattle-brained horde of the red flag ever proclaimed\n\nsuch a specific defiance of law, precedent, order, and government' was the\n\ncomment of the *New York Mail*...'Considering the platform,' declared C.\n\nEllery Anderson of New York, 'it may be as well that a revolutionist like\n\nBryan stands upon it. We want them with red flags so there will be\n\nprovocation for shooting them down.' (*Literary Digest,* Vol. XIII, July\n\n18, 1896, p. 357.)\" Philip Foner, *History of the Labor Movement in the\n\nUnited States, Volume II* (1955), p. 336. Foner, a Communist, gives the\n\nChicago Platform the Red Seal of Approval, proclaiming it 'progressive.'\n\n(p. 333).\n\n\"It's important to remember this because it goes against the widespread\n\nbelief that the Populist support for Bryan was put over by 'conservative'\n\nPopulists who believed in free silver as *the* panacea. And it may help\n\nto explain the enthusiastic support for Bryan by what some might consider\n\nan unlikely source--Eugene V. Debs (although, interestingly, even Debs, in\n\nhis campaign tour for Bryan, put a heavy emphasis on free silver).\"\n\nOf course, once again, the question is to what extent Bryan could get\n\nthese \"radical\" measures through Congress. Perhaps more railroad\n\nregulation and some procedural safeguards in the use of labor injunctions\n\nin federal courts would pass. There might be some strengthening of the\n\nSherman Anti-Trust Act. The Democratic platform pretty much acknowledged\n\nthat the tariff couldn't be lowered as long as the Supreme Court decision\n\ninvalidating the income tax stood, but the death of Stephen J. Field\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Johnson_Field would eventually give\n\nBryan a chance to make the Court a bit less conservative. In any event,\n\npresumably the *increases* in the tariff in OTL with the Dingley Act would\n\nnot have been enacted.\n\nIt is true, though, that while both Bryan and the Democrats were in\n\nprinciple in favor of many reforms other than free silver, they\n\nconcentrated heavily on that last issue in 1896, and Bryan might have\n\nspent a disproportionate amount of his energy as President to getting it\n\nenacted, to the detriment of other reforms.\n\n(4) Bryan is notorious for sharing the white South's attitudes toward\n\nAfrican Americans, though as I note at\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/msg/4a22984a42f06a6c he\n\nwasn't as racist in 1896 as he would be later. But in any event it is\n\nhard to see how African Americans (other than some federal patronage\n\nemployees) would fare much worse under him than under McKinley. The\n\nsouthern states would have continued with segregation, disfranchisement,\n\nlynchings, etc., no matter who was in the White House.\n\nMy friends, we declare that this nation is able to legislate for its own people on every question, without waiting for the aid or consent of any other nation on earth; and upon that issue we expect to carry every State in the Union. I shall not slander the inhabitants of the fair State of Massachusetts nor the inhabitants of the State of New York by saying that, when they are confronted with the proposition, they will declare that this nation is not able to attend to its own business. It is the issue of 1776 over again. Our ancestors, when but three millions in number, had the courage to declare their political independence of every other nation; shall we, their descendants, when we have grown to seventy millions, declare that we are less independent than our forefathers? No, my friends, that will never be the verdict of our people. Therefore, we care not upon what lines the battle is fought. If they say bimetallism is good, but that we cannot have it until other nations help us, we reply that, instead of having a gold standard because England has, we will restore bimetallism, and then let England have bimetallism because the United States has it. If they dare to come out in the open field and defend the gold standard as a good thing, we will fight them to the uttermost. Having behind us the producing masses of this nation and the world, supported by the commercial interests, the laboring interests, and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\n\n-William Jennings Bryan, in his speech to the Democratic Convention, July 9th, 1896.\n\n(Republican cartoon criticizing Bryan's speech)\n\nThe Presidential Election of 1896 was, without a doubt, the greatest upset of American electoral history. William Jennings Bryan had a massive funding disadvantage and ran as the incumbent Democratic president presided over a poor economy. To make matters worse, Conservative Bourbon Democrats who supported the Gold Standard formed a third party ticket, dividing William McKinley’s opposition. On paper, the election should have been the biggest landslide since the Era of Good Feelings. And with any other Democrat, it likely would have been. However, two factors contributed to Bryan’s upset victory. One was Bryan’s great oratory skills and his decision to actively campaign for himself. In order to assuage fears that Bryan was a radical, he denounced radical elements within the labor movement in speeches in New York and Chicago. While this tactic certainly made him competitive despite all the disadvantages he had against McKinley, it was not what ultimately gave him victory. Many historians now believe that Bryan won the election because of a critical error made by the McKinley campaign. William McKinley decided to make an appeal to Democrats alienated by Bryan’s populist rhetoric. He believed that an army of Bourbon Democrats, including many Southerners, would carry him safely to victory on Election Day. In doing this, the tariff issue was greatly downplayed for fear that protectionism would scare away potentially sympathetic voters. This proved to be a great miscalculation as his support for protectionism was well-known and he didn’t use it to his advantage as much as he could. McKinley’s inability to effectively counter Bryan’s appeal to the working class led to the Republican Party’s defeat in November.\n\nThe election was very close, and that must have added to the pain felt by McKinley and his supporters. McKinley also lost his home state of Ohio by less than 2,000 votes. Had he won Ohio, he would have won the election. In addition, the McKinley/Hobart ticket actually won more votes than the Bryan/Sewall ticket. It is one of history’s great ironies that “The Great Commoner” won the election without winning the popular vote. This showed that not everyone in the working class supported Bryan and the cause of free silver. Many industrial laborers voted Republican as they feared that his monetary policies would only benefit the farmer. Indeed, the election of 1896 was not simply labor against business, rich against poor. While business generally fell behind McKinley, they by no means were a monolith. Bryan’s running mate, Arthur Sewall, was a shipping magnate, and the silver mine owners were more than happy to see an enemy of the Gold Standard in the Executive Mansion[1]. Nonetheless, Bryan entered office determined to enact policies that benefited the farmer and the laborer rather than the businessman.\n\n-Excerpt from Silver vs. Gold, the Election of 1896, Sumner Sewall[2], Howard Publishing Co., 1946.\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan (D-NE)/Arthur Sewall (D-ME): 6,735,052 votes (48.3%)/244 Electoral Votes\n\nWilliam McKinley (R-OH)/Garret Hobart (R-NJ): 6,885,607 votes (49.4%)/203 Electoral Votes\n\nOthers[3]: 320,465 votes (2.3%)/0 Electoral Votes\n\nBryan’s inauguration was compared to that of Andrew Jackson in 1828. Hordes of rural Westerners flooded into DC to hear their young energetic champion speak. The Eastern elites were horrified just as they were then. His speech was full of the same passion and oratory eloquence that his supporters were used to. He praised America’s system of government and the opportunities it gave for peaceful transition of power. He called for national unity; between Republicans and Democrats, between North and South, and between East and West. He stated that America was entering a new era, an era in which the farmer and the worker would fully enjoy the privileges of living in the American Republic. His supporters loved every word; they had high hopes for the man from Nebraska. Meanwhile, those who voted against him feared that he would destroy the country. Many urban workers feared that they would lose their jobs if Bryan won. While these prophecies of doom never came true, neither did the hopes of many that Bryan’s Presidency would bring great prosperity to all. For most Americans, 1897 was no different than 1896, life went on.\n\nBryan began his presidency with a Democratic House and a Republican Senate. However, this does not tell the whole story, as there were Conservative Bourbon Democrats and pro-Silver Republicans. Some politicians, sensing the winds of change, opportunistically switched from supporting gold to supporting silver. Bryan’s cabinet appointments were dominated by Southerners and Westerners, the regions that supported him. He also appointed two Republicans to his cabinet. America, for better or worse, had entered a new age. It was an age that continued beyond Bryan’s Presidency. It wasn’t a golden age by any definition, but it had some moments of greatness. Rather, in consideration of William Jennings Bryan’s favorite metal, these years should be referred to as America’s Silver Age.\n\n-Excerpt from America's Silver Age, Edward S. Scott, Patriot Publishers, 2017.\n\nOn March 4, 1897 William Jennings Bryan, Mary Baird Bryan (the new First Lady), and their three children; Ruth, William Jr, and Grace moved into the Executive Mansion, their new residence. Vice President Arthur Sewell was a common guest of the Bryans. Sewell was somewhat an oddity in politics. He was a New England businessman who was not only a Democrat, but also a supporter of silver. His presence was very useful during Bryan’s early presidency. Sewell met with business leaders to reassure them that Bryan was not anti-business, that he only opposed bad businesses and bad business leaders. This had mixed results. The titans of industry still largely opposed Bryan, but some businessmen, like oil baron Thomas L. Hisgen, would support the President.\n\nOther guests of the Bryan’s included the members of his cabinet. For Secretary of State Bryan chose Senator Henry Moore Teller of Colorado. Henry Teller was a prominent Silver Republican who supported Bryan’s campaign. He was also Secretary of the Interior under President Chester Arthur. Teller, like Bryan, was an opponent of American Imperialism. Teller also was a proponent of Native American rights. For Secretary of the Treasury Bryan chose Alexander del Mar, a member of the Silver Party from New York. Del Mar was an outspoken opponent of the Gold Standard. Bryan’s most controversial cabinet nomination was undoubtedly John Tyler Morgan of Alabama for Secretary of War. Bryan wanted to bring a former Confederate into his cabinet to promote national unity. Senator Morgan had been among the Democrats who opposed Grover Cleveland and the Gold Standard. He was also an extreme racist and a former slave owner. He was happy to be appointed to Bryan’s cabinet and hoped to steer him away from his pacifist leanings. John T. Morgan and Henry Teller would often clash during the Bryan administration.\n\nUS Representative Benton McMillan of Tennessee was chosen as Attorney General. He was known for supporting progressive causes such as the income tax and child labor laws. Populist Alabama Representative Milford W. Howard[4], who gained fame challenging corruption in Congress and was even younger than the President, was chosen as Postmaster General. For Secretary of the Navy, William C. Whitney of Massachusetts, who was given that position during Cleveland’s first term, was chosen. Bryan chose Idaho Republican Senator Fred Dubois as his Secretary of the Interior. Dubois was a supporter of Silver, environmental conservation, and an anti-Mormon. Finally, for Secretary of Agriculture, Bryan chose Representative Joseph C. Sibley of Pennsylvania, who was a farmer and opponent of the Gold Standard.\n\n-Excerpt from The Guide to the Executive Mansion, an in Depth Look at America's Presidents by Benjamin Buckley, Harvard Press, 1999.\n\n1: What the White House was called before Theodore Roosevelt gave it that name.\n\n2: Sumner Sewall was the Grandson of Arthur Sewall and governor of Maine during the 1940s IOTL.\n\n3: Gold Democrats, Prohibition, Socialist Labor, and National Prohibition Parties.\n\n4: In my original Bryan TL, Howard served as Vice President for most of Bryan's Presidency.
