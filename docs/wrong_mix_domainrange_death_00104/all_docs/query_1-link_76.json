        "text": "Historians date the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy from 1922 to 1936, though its roots can be traced back another fifty years. By the mid 1920s, the battle between Fundamentalists, who believed in the literal truth of the Bible, and Modernists, who believed religion should progress with modern society, embroiled most Protestant denominations. It was particularly divisive among Presbyterians, contributing to the formation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936.\n\nHarry Emerson Fosdick struck the first blow in the controversy in May 1921 when he gave the most famous sermon of his career at the First Presbyterian Church in New York City. Having recently returned from a missionary visit to China, Fosdick was dismayed that evangelical missionaries were doing work separate from the major Protestant denominations. In his speech “Shall the Fundamentalists Win?”, Fosdick blasted the Fundamentalists for intolerance. “The question is: has anybody a right to deny the Christian name to those who differ with him on such points and to shut against them the doors of the Christian fellowship? The Fundamentalists say that this must be done....I plead this morning the cause of magnanimity and liberality and the tolerance of spirit.”\n\nConservatives reacted quickly. The 1923 PCUSA General Assembly voted to reaffirm the Five Fundamentals adopted at previous assemblies; it also instructed the Presbytery of New York to make sure that the teachings of the First Presbyterian Church in New York City were in line with the Westminster Confession. Liberal Presbyterians drafted the Auburn Affirmation in response, defending doctrinal liberty in the church. Its signers accepted the Westminster Confession but denied its infallibility.\n\nPerhaps no issue caused more discord between Modernists and Fundamentalists than evolution. Bryan, who was nominated for moderator at the 1923 General Assembly, wanted to go so far as to have the church pull funding from any institution teaching Darwinism. He lost the moderator's election to Charles F. Wishart, president of the College of Wooster, where evolutionary theory was taught. The assembly adopted a more moderate approach to evolution that year. It decided to withhold approval, though not funding, from any schools teaching a “materialistic evolutionary philosophy of life.”"
