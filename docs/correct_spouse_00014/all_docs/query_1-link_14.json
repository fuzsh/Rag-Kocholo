She portrayed The Source's Oracle in the season 4 episodes \"Charmed Again, Part 1 and Part 2\" and \"Brain Drain\".\n\nBiography[]\n\nKrista Allen was born April 5, 1971 in Ventura, California to Katherine and Dalton Allen. She grew up in Houston and later lived in Austin, Texas, going to school at Austin Community College and majoring in education. Krista eventually graduated from the University of Texas with an education degree. She considered teaching as a profession but ultimately decided to move back to California and pursue an acting career. Allen is sometimes credited as Krista Allen-Moritt as a result of her marriage to Justin Moritt which lasted from 1996 to 1999; they have one son, Jacob Nolan, born on July 12, 1997. Allen also dated actor George Clooney from 2002 to 2004.\n\nOn October 10, 2010, she married Mams Taylor, a British musician. They separated in August 2011 and Allen filed for divorce at Los Angeles County Superior Court on February 12, 2012.[9]\n\nKrista is descended from Elizabeth Key Grinstead, thus giving her distant African-American ancestry. Through Elizabeth, Krista is a very distant cousin of Johnny Depp.\n\nCareer[]\n\nFilmography\n\nLiar Liar (1997)\n\nTotally Blonde (2001)\n\nShutup And Kiss Me (2004)\n\nFeast (2005)\n\nStrange Wilderness (2008)\n\nFinal Destination 4 (2009)\n\nTelevision[]\n\nDiagnosis: Murder\n\nDays Of Our Lives\n\nPacific Blue\n\nThe X Files\n\nSpin City\n\nCharmed\n\nFriends\n\nJust Shoot Me!\n\nFrasier\n\nSmallville\n\nTwo And A Half Men\n\nMonk\n\nWhat About Brian?\n\n[]"
