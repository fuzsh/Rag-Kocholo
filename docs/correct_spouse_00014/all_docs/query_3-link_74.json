        "text": "The Bold and the Beautiful star Krista Allen revealed she was secretly dropped from the show in October despite receiving her first Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Dr. Taylor Haynes.\n\nAllen broke the news during a recent interview with Deadline.\n\n“The craziest thing is right before I got dropped, I did the cast photo shoot, and then the next week they called and said, ‘We’re not going to keep your third year and thank you very much, you were wonderful and thank you, goodbye,” she said. “And I was like, what?”\n\nThe actress hasn’t appeared in an episode since Nov. 8. According to an inside source, Allen was offered the chance to take a recurring role on the show, but a rep for the actress said she was only offered the chance to say “three lines” in an episode “after a couple months of nothing.”\n\nAllen took on the role in 2021, replacing Hunter Tylo who was already a fan-favorite. But she said she initially began to notice a change on the show when she realized she wasn’t being written into the scripts, even though her character played a major role on the soap.\n\n“The fan base was going insane during this time because the character of Taylor was needed on the show,” she recalled. “There was a lot of stuff going on and people were starting to tweet about it. They were starting to say, ‘where is Taylor?… ‘Where is Taylor? Bring back Taylor, bring back Krista.’ The show just said that my character wasn’t really needed.”\n\nShe later added that “nobody was giving me any information” after she and her agent inquired about the change. Allen, who is preparing to attend the Daytime Emmy Awards taking place tonight, stated that she still believes that none of her cast mates are aware that she has been dropped from the show.\n\n“I think the hardest thing for me has been trying to stay quiet,” she said. “I haven’t known what to say. And then when I got dropped, I was like, ‘Oh, okay, is the show going to announce this?’ But they never did.”\n\nThe actress said that she was hopeful that Taylor will be recast again, but she is unsure of what the show has planned for the role.\n\nDespite the surprising news, Allen seems optimistic about the future.\n\n“When the Emmy nominations came out and I was nominated, I was blown away. It was my first year as a recast. It was kind of like against all odds,” she said. She added that she plans to move to Atlanta soon and turn “the page on this really interesting chapter.”\n\nThe irony on this dramatic exit is not lost on the actress, however. “The most ironic part of it is that it’s like a real life soap opera. This is the Friday cliffhanger!” Allen said."
