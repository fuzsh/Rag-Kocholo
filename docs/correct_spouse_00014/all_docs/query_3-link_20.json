        "text": "The doctor is out. Two years after joining The Bold and the Beautiful as a recast for Hunter Tylo as Taylor Hayes, Krista Allen has been let go, she tells our sister site Deadline.\n\n“The craziest thing is right before I got dropped, I did the cast photo shoot, and then the next week they called and said, ‘We’re not going to keep your third year… you were wonderful and thank you, goodbye. And I was like, ‘What?’”\n\nA show spokesman declined to comment for the article, but an insider said that the Daytime Emmy nominee was offered the chance to recur on the show and rejected it. Allen’s rep, in turn, countered that in late November, she was offered what amounted to an under-five appearance “after a couple months of nothing.”\n\nWhen the Days of Our Lives vet’s frontburner Taylor/Ridge/Brooke love triangle was resolved — as he always does, Ridge picked Brooke — Allen said that she convinced herself “everything is cyclical. I just figured that that was the situation, but then I was dropped, so that was it.”\n\nA Bold & Beautiful mainstay since 1990, Taylor has had four husbands besides Ridge and was also involved with his father and brother. She is best known as a shrink but was originally an oncologist and, while “deceased,” was the princess of Morocco."
