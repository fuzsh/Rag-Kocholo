        "text": "Mams Taylor (Legal Name) is a British musician.\n\nContents\n\n1 Life and career\n\n2 United for Neda\n\n2.1 Albums\n\n3 References\n\nLife and career\n\nMams Taylor was raised in Cricklewood, London. Growing up, he took on odd jobs from selling roses to nightclub bouncer on his way to connecting with Hollywood and music industry royalty. Mams Taylor's debut album, \"King Amongst Men-The Lost Album\" is available on i Tunes and features collaborations from Snoop Dogg, The Game, Lil Kim, Fat Joe Bobby V, Rico Love, Ya Boy, Christina Milian, DJ Tiesto, Mario Wynans, Yung Joc, and T-Pain. Production collaborations on the album include Scott Storch, DJ Tiesto, legendary producer Rodney Jerkins, as well as self-produced tracks. The album had hundreds of thousands of downloads through Mininova and other web sites including his own. He has unreleased tracks coming soon featuring Robbie Williams, Joel Madden (Good Charlotte) Jacoby Shaddix (Paparoach), Travis Barker and Dave Navarro.\n\nMams Taylor is also the pioneer of the new genre of music runk, which is the fusion of rap, rock and punk. Taylor began experimenting with the runk sound in opposition to those who wanted to restrict his music to any one type or genre. He explained Runk in detail on the home page of his website:\n\nTo define Runk is paradoxical. Runk is a movement, an attitude and expression that is born from deep within, mothered by love and yet the son of a thousand fathers. It is a boundary breaker, an anti-establishment rebellion with spiritual undertones. There are no rules. Guitar riffs from rock, punk bravado, hip hop beats, classical piano, eerie voices of opera, high octane techno - it can all be there. It is born out feeling and not thought. It all comes together and represents the oneness that is inevitable in music and life. Runk on.[1]\n\nTaylor's first music video, entitled \"L.A. Girls\", received over 500,000 hits on YouTube and featured an all star cast including Mila Kunis, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Carmen Electra, Kelly Carlson, Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson, and Joel Madden. The video was shot by Constellation Jones and released in early 2008. Taylor released a video and song featuring Snoop Dogg \"Girl Gotta Girlfriend\" in 2009. His next album is set to be released sometime in 2011.\n\nMams Taylor is also gaining recognition as a producer and song writer for a variety of known and unknown artists. He produced the west coast radio hit single \"Party Girls\" for \"Ya Boy The Rockstar\" signed to Akon as well as numerous others such as Steel Bill, Erika Jayne, The Massey Boys, Christina Milian, Jay Rock, Ashley Roberts (Pussy Cat Dolls), Monet, Rico Love, Macy Gray and Glasses Malone. Additionally, he produced tracks featuring T Pain, Robbie Williams and Joel Madden. Mams Taylor set up a label \"Premiere League Music\" in California and signed an artist from Louisiana called Steel Bill, in 2010. Taylor is expected to drop a mix tape as a producer FT \"Ya Boy\" in the summer of 2011.\n\nOther than his love of music, Mams Taylor has a passion for mixed martial arts fighting. Taylor appeared in Fight Magazine in 2009.\n\nMams Taylor has worked with charitable organizations called \"Kids Company\" and Los Angeles based \"A Place Called Home\". Both charities help enhance the lives of children.\n\nOn October 10, 2010, he married actress Krista Allen in a quiet ceremony.\n\nUnited for Neda\n\nMams Taylor was among more than two dozen Iranian expatriate superstars who united to spread a musical message of non-violent resistance. His song \"United for Neda\" is a call to action against human rights violations by the Iranian government against citizens who protested the disputed outcome of the June 2010 presidential elections. The song brought together Iran’s most elite entertainers, poets, thinkers, actors and singers in one harmonious voice pleading for freedom. The song and video included three of Iran’s most iconic singers--Dariush, Satar and Morteza, Oscar-nominated Iranian-American actress Shoreh Aghdashloo, Iranian-American actress Sheila Vosough, Iranian-American composer and vocalist Sussan Deyhim, actor and poet Parviz Sayyad, Kamy R, a singer from Black Cats (Iran's most popular singing group), and rappers Kamyar, Payam Jaffari and The Kid. Taylor wrote and produced the song.\n\n\"United for Neda\", which was recorded in English and Persian versions to reach Western and Iranian audiences, was inspired by the plight of Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year old Iranian woman who was fatally shot on the streets of Tehran during a brutal crackdown on June 20, 2010 by the Basij. The ordeal was recorded on cell phone video and received international attention when it hit the Internet.[2]\n\nAlbums\n\nYear Album Chart positions RIAA certification U.S. U.S. R&B 2009 King Amongst Men:The Lost Album TBA TBA N/A\n\nReferences"
