        "text": "By\n\nThe daytime world was a bit rocked last Friday when heading into the 50th annual Daytime Emmy Awards, an item broke that Krista Allen (Taylor Hayes) had been taken off contract at The Bold and the Beautiful and the series chose not to exercise its option for the third year of her three-year deal.\n\nWhile other insiders revealed to Deadline, that Allen was actually offered to go recurring with the soap opera, she turned it down. Now, Allen has finally arrived in her new digs in Atlanta. She had previously expressed she would be moving to Georgia following the Daytime Emmys last week.\n\nIronically, all this was playing out while Krista was a nominee in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category and taking to the red carpet at daytime’s biggest night of the year.\n\nWith an update via her X account on Thursday, Allen shared: “I made it to my new place in GA! I’m officially a bicoastal babe now! I’ve wanted to find a place out of CA for a long time. Amazing how a simple shift in perspective can make the biggest difference. Sometimes when you think you have been buried, you have actually just been divinely planted Here’s to all my new growth fam out there! U!!”\n\nLastly, she gave a shout out to #TeamTaylor her rapid B&B fans base and expressed:”I miss you as much as you miss me (frfr!) and I love you so BIG!!!!! You’ll never know how much I appreciate each and every one of you – or how much joy you give me – but, from the bottom of my heart … Thank you!”\n\nShare your well-wishes to Krista via the comment section below, and let us know if you hope she will be back on our daytime screens sometime in the future.\n\nUp Next\n\nJohn J.

Cwikly had previously written for DAYS in the early 2000’s, while Ford had been a current breakdown writer for the series.\n\nWith his quick exit that was effective immediately, Carlivati gave a statement to TV Insider now that he has wrapped his run in Salem.\n\nCarlivati expressed: “It has honestly been one of the great joys of my life to be the Head Writer of Days of Our Lives for the past seven-and-a-half years,” Carlivati says. “I want to thank (Executive Producer) Ken Corday, (Co-Executive Producer) Janet Drucker and the entire cast and crew at Days for an amazing run. Thanks also to Peacock executives, Michael Sluchan, Cherise Masukawa and everyone at Peacock for their unfailing support. To the fans, thank you for your passion.”\n\nRon’s daytime career began as a writer’s assistant for One Life to Live, eventually being named the show’s head writer, where he won his first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series in 2008.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of One Life to Live, Carlivati jumped over to another ABC soap opera, General Hospital where from 2012-2015 he created the stories that were front and center. While picking up multiple WGA awards for DAYS, Carlivati and team, won Ron his second Daytime Emmy in 2018 for his work on DAYS.\n\nIn conclusion, Carlivati said to DAYS fan, “My material will continue to air through April of 2025, so I really hope you enjoy what’s coming!”\n\nWhat do you think of Ron’s statement as he says farewell to Days of our Lives?
