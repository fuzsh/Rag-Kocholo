        "text": "Krista Allen recently left The Bold and the Beautiful, and Taylor Hayes is now missing in action. However, the actress has something big to celebrate today.\n\nHappy Birthday, Krista Allen\n\nAnd that’s because she was born on April 5, 1971, in Ventura, California, which means that this beloved star is turning 53 years old today! Despite majoring in education at Austin (TX) Community College and then landing an internship as a kindergarten teacher, Allen’s aspirations to be an actress won out, and she soon moved to Los Angeles.\n\nShe made her professional debut in 1994 as the title seductress in a series of soft-core made-for-TV movies inspired by the Emmanuelle character.\n\nSeveral guest starring credits followed — Patty on High Tide, Page Tanner on Diagnosis: Murder, and Crystal Clark on Married…With Children, to name a few — and soon after, Allen was tapped to replace the outgoing Lisa Rinna as Billie Reed on Days of our Lives. That role lasted from 1996 to 1999.\n\nOne year, and several more additions to her resume later, Allen landed a spot on Baywatch: Hawaii Nights. Among a plethora of other works that include the Jim Carrey-starring Liar Liar, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind [on which she met future paramour George Clooney], and recurring parts on Charmed, CSI, Fastlane, and What About Brian. Allen appeared in several reality series: Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race, Denise Richards: It’s Complicated, and Love Bites.\n\nStarting in December 2021, Allen played Dr. Taylor Hayes on The Bold and the Beautiful, a character originally helmed by Hunter Tylo. This marked a homecoming of sorts for Allen, as she’d previously had a short run on the serial as Shelly in 1995. She received a Daytime Emmy nomination for her work as Taylor, but General Hospital‘s late Sonya Eddy ended up winning the category.\n\nAllen is a proud vegan, a director/spokesperson for the non-profit organization R.I.S.E. & Stand, formerly owned and operated her own T-shirt line [SuperEXcellent, née Sex Brand], and is a mother to son Jacob “Jake” Nolan Moritt (born July 12, 1997).\n\nSoap Hub would like to wish Krista Allen a very happy birthday and many more, and you can do so by clicking on the X (formerly Twitter) link below.\n\nSend Krista Allen a birthday tweet now:\n\nHappy Birthday @KristaAllenXO!
