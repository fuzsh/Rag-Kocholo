Through out my high school career I discovered three important characteristic about myself: humility, creativity, and leadership.

Creativity in my love and appreciation for the arts and being in an independent film along with being accepted into distinguished art for my last year of high school.

Alexis was born in Houston, Texas, on September 16, 1981. Although she was born in America, her parents laid out their Latin roots. Her mother is Mexican and her father is from Argentina. Her parent's origins created an environment that was multicultural and Spanish speaking. She did not start speaking English until she entered school. Alexis was timid as a young girl but found her way into acting and modeling. In return, this encouraged her to break open her shell. She first received her “big break” when she was eighteen. Bledel was attending NYU when she auditioned for the popular, show, Gilmore Girls. She said, that at the time, she only auditioned for the experience.\n\nIn the early 2000’s she was landing prominent roles in films like The Wedding Planner, Maid in Manhattan, and Monster In Law but it’s been a while since we’ve seen her in a movie. She’s still working in film and television but her roles are smaller and she’s taken quite a few voice parts to fill out her filmography. But why? Did she just not have the talent to make it any further or was it her diva like behaviour on set that gave her a bad reputation?"
