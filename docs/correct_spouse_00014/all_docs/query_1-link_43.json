        "text": "According to latest reports, Dr Taylor Hayes is finally returning to ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’ and veteran TV actress Krista Allen will assume the iconic role starting December 10. Prior to this, Hunter Tylo played the part of the psychiatrist from 1990 to 2019.\n\nAn insider told Entertainment Weekly that the show reached out to Tylo about reprising the role but was unsuccessful. Since Tylo started with the role in 1990, the character battled Katherine Kelly Lang’s Brooke Logan for the affections of Ridge Forrester, played by Ronn Moss and later Thorsten Kaye.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nIs 'The Rookie' star Nathan Fillion single? Dating George Clooney's ex to being engaged, a look at his love life\n\nWho are Michael Tylo's wives? 'Guiding Light' star dies at 72\n\nTylo was a two-time Soap Opera Digest Award nominee for Hottest Female Star. As per TV Line, when Tylo exited the soap for good in 2019, the show explained her absence on the show by saying that Taylor Hayes went to do missionary work in another country. Allen is a veteran soap actor as well. From 1996 to 1999, she played Billie Reed on ‘Days of Our Lives’. She went on to appear in shows like ‘CSI’, ‘The X-Files’, and ‘Baywatch’.\n\nMore recently, she appeared in ‘9-1-1’ and in the TV movie ‘I Almost Married a Serial Killer’. Allen, per reports, is scheduled to start taping episodes of ‘The Bold and the Beautiful’ in Los Angeles on October 28. Her first scenes, per Entertainment Weekly, will be with her daughter and ex-husband Ridge (Thorsten Kaye), who's been with Brooke for some time now.\n\nDid Krista Allen date Nathan Fillion?\n\nAllen reportedly dated George Clooney for two years after meeting him on the set of ‘Confessions of a Dangerous Mind’ in 2002. In 1999 she divorced production manager and producer Justin Moritt, with whom she shares son Jake. Later, she married again. This time it was rapper Mams Taylor. In 2012, she divorced the Iranian-English rapper.\n\nIn 2015, it was reported that Allen was dating actor Nathan Fillion, famous for his roles in ‘Castle’, ‘Firefly’, and most recently in ‘The Rookie’. In November 2015, multiple sources confirmed to Us Weekly that the two were dating. “They met a few months ago through friends and it’s going really well. He’s met her son and they get along,” a source said at the time.\n\n“Krista is super happy. She’s been kind of unlucky in love in the past and now she’s found this genuinely nice guy who treats her well,” another source said then. “They are having a great time together.” But while it has not been explicitly reported, many reports say that the two broke up after some time. Allen also reportedly deleted photos of the ‘Castle’ star from her Instagram, even though Fillion appears to have a few of her photos on his profile. After Allen, there has been no confirmation regarding Fillion's relationship status and he is believed to be single.\n\nBefore Allen, Fillion dated Mikaela Hoover. They met in 2013 and it was reported that the two were also engaged the very same year. Fillion and Hoover also attended many events together where they appeared for photographs at the red carpet. However, things didn't work out and the two of them broke things off."
