        "text": "While Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Daytime Drama Series, Krista Allen (Taylor Hayes), was walking on the red carpet last night at the 50th Daytime Emmy Awards, earlier in the day the news had broke, that the reason viewers of CBS’s The Bold and the Beautiful had not seen her on-air, is that the show decided not to pick up the third year of her contract.\n\nAllen told Deadline, that she was told back in October that her contract wouldn’t be renewed. Smart B&B viewers had noticed that she has not appeared in any episodes since November 8th. Given Eric Forrester’s (John McCook) failing health storyline, where her children Thomas (Matthew Atkinson) and Steffy (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) were greatly impacted, many were wondering where was Taylor?\n\nNow the answers became clear: Krista was told the show opted out of her contract, but the events surrounding it didn’t initially add up to her. Allen expressed, “The craziest thing is right before I got dropped, I did the cast photo shoot, and then the next week they called and said, ‘We’re not going to keep your third year and thank you very much, you were wonderful and thank you, goodbye.’ And I was like, what?”’\n\nKrista said it was very challenging for her to keep quiet about the whole situation: “I haven’t known what to say. And then when I got dropped, I was like, ‘oh, okay, is the show going to announce this?’ But they never did.”\n\nWhen Allen checked out X (formerly Twitter) on December 10th, she realized it was the two-year anniversary of playing Taylor and many of her fans were posting messages to her about, but she didn’t know how to respond.\n\nHowever, a source also told Deadline that Allen was offered to go recurring with the series, and turned that down. Krista’s rep shared that she had been offered three lines in an episode in late November, after “a couple of nothing months.”\n\nNo word yet if the role will be recast, but Allen shared that following the Daytime Emmys, she was moving to Atlanta, Georgia and out of Hollywood. nterestingly, Krista’s former leading man, Thorsten Kaye (Ridge Forrester), took home the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\n\nWhat do you think of Krista confirming her exit from B&B? Share your thoughts on the situation via the comment section below.\n\nDays of our Lives made a major change in its creative regime on Friday with Ron Carlivati departing his position as head writer of the Peacock soap opera being replaced by a new co-head writing team of Paula Cwikly and Jeannie Marie Ford. Cwikly had previously written for DAYS in the early 2000’s, while Ford had been a current breakdown writer for the series.\n\nWith his quick exit that was effective immediately, Carlivati gave a statement to TV Insider now that he has wrapped his run in Salem.\n\nCarlivati expressed: “It has honestly been one of the great joys of my life to be the Head Writer of Days of Our Lives for the past seven-and-a-half years,” Carlivati says. “I want to thank (Executive Producer) Ken Corday, (Co-Executive Producer) Janet Drucker and the entire cast and crew at Days for an amazing run. Thanks also to Peacock executives, Michael Sluchan, Cherise Masukawa and everyone at Peacock for their unfailing support. To the fans, thank you for your passion.”\n\nRon’s daytime career began as a writer’s assistant for One Life to Live, eventually being named the show’s head writer, where he won his first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series in 2008.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of One Life to Live, Carlivati jumped over to another ABC soap opera, General Hospital where from 2012-2015 he created the stories that were front and center. While picking up multiple WGA awards for DAYS, Carlivati and team, won Ron his second Daytime Emmy in 2018 for his work on DAYS.\n\nIn conclusion, Carlivati said to DAYS fan, “My material will continue to air through April of 2025, so I really hope you enjoy what’s coming!”\n\nWhat do you think of Ron’s statement as he says farewell to Days of our Lives? Comment below.\n\nMark Consuelos and Kelly Ripa continue to be a hit, as the husband/wife team co-host a morning daytime talk show. Now the former All My Children alums have continued to show audience growth over the last three weeks.\n\nOn the strength of their Fourth of July episode, with nearly 2.2M viewers tuning in and up 4% vs. 2023, the Nielsen ratings reveal that’s the best July Fourth performance in three years for ‘Live’.\n\nFor the week of July 1-5, ‘Live’ scored 2.1M viewers, with the key demos of: 25-54 receiving a 0.54 rating and women 18-49 coming in at 0.24 rating. On the strength of those numbers, Live with Kelly and Mark was also the top daytime talk show for the week.\n\nThe ratings increase also marked the third consecutive week that Live with Kelly and Mark posted audience growth, up 2% from the week prior. This season thus far, Live with Kelly and Mark is averaging around 2.7 million viewers.\n\nBack in April, Consuelos celebrated his one-year as co-host of ‘Live’. In June of 2024, Kelly and Mark won their first ever joint Daytime Emmy as Outstanding Talk Show hosts.\n\nBefore Mark joined Kelly on ‘Live’, Ryan Seacrest held the gig for six years. Seacrest has since moved on and moved back to the West Coast from the East Coast where “Live” is taped, and his now getting ready to debut as the new host of Wheel of Fortune replacing iconic host, Pat Sajak. among is numerous other projects.\n\nSo, what do you think about Kelly and Mark’s continue success as co-hosts of ‘Live’ together? Do you enjoy their on-screen banter? Comment below.\n\nThere are changes afoot at Peacock’s Days of our Lives, as Ron Carlivati who served as the head writer of the soap opera for seven years is out. The move is effective immediately.\n\nCarlivati will be replaced with the co-head writing team of Paula Cwikly and Jeanne Marie Ford, as confirmed by Days of our Lives. However, because the show tapes so far ahead of when they stream, episodes written by the Carlivati regime will be seen by DAYS viewers through April of 2025.\n\nCwikly and Ford have longtime ties to the soap. Previously, Cwikly served as head writer and associate writer at Days of our Lives in the early 2000’s, while Ford has been serving as a current breakdown writer at DAYS. Both women have worked on writing teams for As the World Turns and One Life to Live, while Cwikly has also held positions with the Sunset Beach and The Young and the Restless writing teams.\n\nIn a statement on the head writing change, Days of our Lives executive producer, Ken Corday said, “We look forward to approaching our 60th Anniversary next year with Paula and Jeanne Marie at the helm and fresh, exciting stories that we know the fans will embrace. We wish Ron nothing but the best and thank him for his dedication and the respect he has shown to me, the cast, and the show’s legacy.”\n\nCarlivati came to DAYS back in 2017, with his first episodes airing in July of that year. He previously served as the head writer for One Life to Live and was its final head scribe until it went off the air in 2012.
