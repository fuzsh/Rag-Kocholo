        "text": "KSI has CONFIRMED he will be back in the boxing ring this year - but refused to reveal who against.\n\nThe YouTube, music and crossover boxing star suffered his first defeat last October in a controversial decision to Tommy Fury.\n\nKSI spoke out to say he was taking time away from the sport, leaving his future in the ring up in the air.\n\nBut, at a press conference to promote Misfits 12 in Leeds, he confirmed that he will fight again this year.\n\nSo here, SunSport takes a look at five names we could see the social media sensation in the ring with.\n\nJake Paul\n\nIs is the biggest and most obvious choice. No fight in the crossover boxing scene is greater than this.\n\nAnd this could be the year the bitter enemies put egos aside and get a deal done to finally fight.\n\nThey are both aligned with DAZN but must negotiate a fight weight that would see the two meet in the middle.\n\nTommy Fury\n\nBoth Fury and KSI have insisted their mutual hate for each other makes a rematch almost impossible.\n\nBut, KSI may not lie until he has attempted to settle the score with Fury after such a tight and contentious first result.\n\nThe grudge bout sold a reported 1.3million pay-per-views, meaning it could be too big to turn down.\n\nJoey Essex\n\nThe reality TV legend is the nephew to legendary British trainer Tony Simms, who once coached Anthony Joshua and currently works with Conor Benn.\n\nEssex has been teasing a boxing match, posting training clips and asking fans who they want to see him fight.\n\nAnd the TOWIE icon also said he would \"wallop\" KSI and claimed there is a behind-the-scenes rift between them.\n\nJorge Masvidal\n\nBefore KSI got a deal over the line with Fury, his manager Mams Taylor teased that they could turn their attention to Masivdal.\n\nBut the American was signed to the UFC, meaning any move would be blocked.\n\nHowever, the UFC have since given him the green light to rematch Nate Diaz in the boxing ring, opening the door to a future bout with KSI.\n\nTyron Woodley\n\nWoodley crossed over to boxing in 2021 but suffered a points and knockout defeat to Paul.\n\nBut it did not stop talks for him to face KSI last year although a deal collapsed amid a weight disagreement.\n\nEx-UFC champ Woodley is still open to the fight and it could give KSI the perfect route back into a big-time bout."
