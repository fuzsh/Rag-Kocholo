        "text": "George Clooney and professional wrestler Stacy Keibler made a beautiful couple in the three years they dated. (Of course, George Clooney and anyone makes a beautiful couple.) But like the rest of his leading ladies over the years, it didn’t last. Clooney and Keibler, a former “Dancing With the Stars” contestant, broke up last year. And over the weekend, she got married to interactive tech firm honcho Jared Pobre on a beach in Mexico.\n\nWonder what’s become of the other women who’ve canoodled with Clooney over the years? Here’s a rundown:\n\nKelly Preston, 1987-89\n\nClooney was just 26, and Preston, 25, when they shacked up in a Hollywood Hills house. Clooney hadn’t yet found fame as Dr. Doug Ross on “ER” — he was best known at the time for work on “The Facts of Life.” And Honolulu-born Preston was in films like “Amazon Women on the Moon.” There was a good chance their relationship was doomed when Clooney gifted Preston with a baby potbellied pig named Max. (Hey, George, here’s a hint: Most women prefer jewelry over pork.)\n\nTalia Balsam, 1989-93\n\nThe New York-born actress — daughter of actors Martin Balsam and Joyce Van Patten — is the only woman to get Clooney down the aisle. They tied the knot in Las Vegas in 1989 (and divorced in ’93). “I gave it a shot,” Clooney said of marriage in a 2011 interview with Piers Morgan. “I’ve proven how good I was at it, and I just . . . I’m allowed one.” Balsam has been married to “Mad Men” star John Slattery since 1998, and has played his ex-wife, Mona Sterling, on the AMC series.\n\nKimberly Russell, 1993-95\n\nBrooklyn-native Russell had previously dated Eddie Murphy and was known for her work on TV’s “Head of the Class.” But Clooney didn’t show much class, reportedly dumping her with a “Dear Kim” letter. Russell and her husband of 13 years, Michael Bonewitz, who live in Malibu, already had three children of their own when they adopted five children whose single mom died from lung cancer last year. Proving she is more than just another pretty face.\n\nCeline Balitran, 1996-99\n\nClooney was in Paris filming the thriller “The Peacemaker” when he met French law student/waitress Balitran. (He didn’t meet her in court.) She was just 23 — he was 35. A few months after they met, she was jetting to LA to be Clooney’s date for the Emmys. Soon after, she returned to Paris to retrieve her belongings and settle in LA with Clooney. She dropped law school, and taught kindergarten for a while. Since their relationship ended, she married and divorced filmmaker David M. Rosenthal and appeared on the French reality show “La Ferme Célébritiés.”\n\nLisa Snowdon, 2000-2005, on and off\n\nThis Brit beauty met Clooney when they worked together on an ad for Martini, an Italian vermouth, in 2000. Snowdon went on, post-breakup, to host “Britain’s Next Top Model,” as well as a popular radio show in England. She told England’s Daily Mirror newspaper last year: “I sometimes think it will be written on my tombstone, ‘George Clooney once dated Lisa Snowdon.’ I will have to do something super-radical for people to forget about it. Goodness knows . . . I’m definitely too old for Prince Harry!”\n\nRenée Zellweger, 2001\n\nLongtime friends, and co-stars in the 2008, Clooney-directed “Leatherheads,” Kentucky-born Clooney and Texas sweetheart Zellwegger did have something going on. Asked once if he and Zellwegger had dated, Clooney admitted, “A little bit.” Let’s leave that to the imagination.\n\nKrista Allen, 2002-2004\n\nCalifornia girl Allen first met Clooney on the set of his directorial debut, “Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,” about game show host Chuck Barris. In her small part, she was billed as — what else — “Pretty Woman.” Clooney apparently took notice, or maybe he first noticed her as a sexy soap star on “Days of Our Lives” (1996-99). Allen married British singer Mams Taylor in 2010 — and filed for divorce a year later.\n\nSarah Larson, 2007-2008\n\nBefore dating Clooney, Larson’s claim to fame was as a contestant of Season 5 of “Fear Factor.” Apparently, she parlayed that into a cocktail waitressing gig in Las Vegas, where the actor ran into her. The Washington state gal quickly became Clooney’s date for the Venice and Deauville film festivals in 2007, and accompanied him to the Oscars in 2008, where he lost in the Best Actor category (for “Michael Clayton”) to Daniel Day-Lewis (“There Will Be Blood”). Despite their breakup, Larson shared something with Clooney that no other woman ever has — they were in a motorcycle accident together. Now living in NYC, Larson told the Celebuzz Web site last year she’s the director of a medical spa. “We do mostly aesthetics — hydro facials, oxygen facials, laser treatments,” she said. “And I still teach yoga part time on the side.”\n\nElisabetta Canalis, 2009-2011\n\nItalian beauty Canalis was hosting her country’s version of “TRL” when she and Clooney first hit it off. She was his date for the Oscars in 2010, where he was nominated for Best Actor (“Up in the Air”), but lost to Jeff Bridges (“Crazy Heart”). Canalis also took it all off — not just for George, but for PETA in its “I’d rather go naked than wear fur” campaign. And went on “Dancing With the Stars” post-Clooney. She is currently dating American orthopedic spine surgeon Brian Perri."
