        "text": "The Bold & Beautiful star hasn‚Äôt been replying to messages and wanted to explain why.\n\nWhen the lovely Krista Allen (Taylor) isn‚Äôt acting like herself (at least on social media), her Bold & Beautiful followers not only notice but also grow concerned. In this case, the worry turned out to be warranted.\n\nAfter joining the Bold & Beautiful as a recast Taylor Hayes in 2021, Allen and her ready wit became an instant hit with fans both onscreen and off. Though not everyone (including Allen) was a fan of that wig, the soap vet‚Äôs posts on Twitter quickly garnered her a legion of admirers ‚Äî especially when she poked fun at her alter-ego‚Äôs dreadful hairpiece.\n\nBut Allen isn‚Äôt just funny online, she‚Äôs honest and regularly interacts with her followers on Twitter, which has endeared her to them all the more.\n\nSo, it‚Äôs not surprising that her absence would be noticed and her witty banter missed. Realizing this, Allen returned to social media to check in with her followers and to let them know what was going on with her given she hadn‚Äôt tweeted since mid-March and hadn‚Äôt been responding on social for much longer than that.\n\nThe star began, ‚ÄúJust wanted to say hi! I miss y‚Äôall and haven‚Äôt checked my tweets in many weeks.‚Äù She promised, ‚ÄúI will soon.‚Äù\n\nShe then revealed the reason behind her absence, ‚ÄúHad a personal tragedy and been dealing with that. Trying to get back to normal now.‚Äù\n\nEven in the face of such a heartbreaking admission, Allen managed a quip and qualified her statement with, ‚ÄúWell, ‚Äònormal‚Äô for me. (Never actually normal! üòÇ).‚Äù\n\nWe‚Äôre going to take her ability to crack a joke as a hopeful sign that she‚Äôs doing okay.\n\nFinally, the star signed off with a message to her fans and followers: ‚ÄúLove you and sending belly laughs and smiles.‚Äù\n\nSOAPS staff send Allen love, strength, and positive vibes as she continues to deal with this difficult situation."
