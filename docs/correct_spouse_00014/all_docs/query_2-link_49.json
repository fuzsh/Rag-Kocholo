        "text": "Misfits Boxing will seemingly have a new member entering its boxing ranks. Only, the person is not entirely a novice when it comes to the world of sports. Per the latest available news report, well-known CBS sports broadcaster Kate Abdo may reportedly fight on Misfits Boxing. The crossover boxing platform, founded by YouTuber-turned-boxer KSI and managed by Mams Taylor, concluded its X Series 13 successfully in Nashville’s Worldwide Stages on March 23.\n\nThe 42-year-old sports anchor, known for her coverage of UEFA Champions League matches, is not new to the sport. Apparently, she receives her training from former professional boxer and now former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder‘s long-time trainer, Malik Scott. According to several accounts, the two are said to be in a relationship. The Manchester-born presenter frequently shares posts of training footage and snaps through her Instagram account.\n\nKate Abdo: A Sports Pundit Exchanges Mikes With Gloves\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nCiting Misfits News, IFN Boxing reported, “Kate Abdo will be fighting on Misfits Boxing, Mams Taylor confirms.” So, on the show’s latest episode (#14), when asked, “Another fight that’s being called is Kate ABDO; she’s obviously got relations with Malik Scott. What is the truth behind this? Could Kate Abdo potentially make that move to Misfits Boxing?” the Co-President of Misfits Boxing, Mams Taylor, replied, “Yes.”\n\nIncidentally, last month, the sports broadcaster shared a clip through her Instagram account. It shows her in conversation with former American soccer player and now sports analyst with CBS, Clint Dempsey. The latter asked, “How’s the boxing thing going?” When Kate Abdo replied that it was going great, another query popped up: “Hey, when you gonna be fighting?” The Manchester-born commentator replied, “I’m gonna be fighting this summer……..I’am training for something! Find me the right person, I’ll fight’ em.”\n\nBorn Kate Giles, Kate Abdo began her career with DW-TV (Deutsche Welle) in 2005. Subsequently, she moved to CNN and later jumped over to Sky Sports. While working with the British sports channel, Kate Abdo received widespread acclaim for presenting the FIFA Ballon d’Or and Laureus World Sports Awards ceremonies.\n\nKate Abdo, who received her education in Spain and France, joined CBS’s show, UEFA Champions League Today, after the network acquired the rights to broadcast the club tournament in the United States. The show that saw her work alongside legends Thierry Henry, Jamie Carragher, and Micah Richards found overwhelming approval among fans and followers.\n\nThe Maverick Journey\n\nThough founded in 2021, Misfits Boxing’s inaugural event came up in August 2022 only. Since then, the KSI venture has been moving forward consistently. Last year, the crossover platform conducted eight shows.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFor the year 2024, Misfits Boxing has thus far conducted two events. The first one, X Series 12, took place on January 20 in Leeds, England. The four-round bout between Mexican boxer Luis Pineda and English TikToker Ed Matthews headlined the show. The X Series 13 maincard featured British YouTuber FoxTheG and American social media influencer Evil Hero.\n\nRead More: Is Kate Abdo Married?
