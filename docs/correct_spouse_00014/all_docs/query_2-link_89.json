        "text": "It takes a village to raise children, as the saying goes. And in Nick Cannon‘s case, that village includes not one, not two, but six baby mamas (so far).\n\nIn recent years, the Masked Singer host has become famous for being, well, fertile. He was already a dad to three kids when he welcomed his fourth in December of 2020, an occasion that marked the start of a baby-making marathon during which he fathered eight more children in the span of two years. Need a math check? That’s a total of 12 kiddos, starting with the twins he shares with superstar ex-wife Mariah Carey and ending, for the moment — ’cause who knows if another pregnancy announcement is coming? — with a baby girl he and model Alyssa Scott welcomed in December 2022.\n\nBillboard has been covering the Nick Cannon baby beat since day one, from his many birth announcements to his vasectomy deliberations to the jokes famous friends such as Kevin Hart and Ryan Reynolds have made at his expense.\n\nBut it’s about time his children’s mothers got some recognition of their own, because — let’s be honest — when it comes to actually carrying the baby and giving birth, they do all of the work. But on top of that, these women are impressive in their own rights and should be highlighted for their accomplishments as singers, actresses, models and moguls on top of being loving mothers.\n\nSo, in the spirit of giving some due respect on the title “baby mama,” keep reading to find out more about the six women Nick Cannon has had children with."
