        "text": "KSI'S manager Mams Taylor is making his childhood dreams come true by bringing WWE to life in the boxing ring.\n\nTaylor, a music mogul-turned boxing promoter, launched Misfits alongside KSI in 2022 to home celebrity-style crossover bouts.\n\nStars from the worlds of social media, music and entertainment - including KSI himself - have all taken to the Misfits ring.\n\nBut Taylor has tried to revolutionise spectacle showdowns by blending them with a bit of pro wrestling both in and out of the ring.\n\nMisfits have sensationally had tag-team matches and this weekend in Nashville host their first two-on-one HANDICAP bout.\n\nAnd it has all been part of Taylor's master plan since he began watching WWE almost 40 years ago to bring the best of pro-wrestling to the world of boxing.\n\nHe said: “I think it’s a good blend and you’ve got something for everyone, especially with the two-on-one outnumbered tag match, again, shades of WWE but with real fighting.\n\n“Because for me, when I watched WWE as a kid it was WWF and I remember when I found out that it was predetermined outcomes and I was more heartbroken than when I found out there’s no Santa.\n\n“So I said one day we’re going to make it so that they really fight each other but you still have that entertainment and the storylines and all of that.\n\n“And I think Misfits Boxing is as close as you can get to that because obviously there’s no predetermined outcomes, nothing’s choreographed or anything like that it’s all real boxing.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\n“But you’ve got some colourful characters.”\n\nTaylor got his break in the music industry, which is where he met UK chart-topper KSI before becoming his manager.\n\nBut his dream was always to be a shot caller like former WWE boss Vince McMahon.\n\nTaylor said: “I wanted to be like the Vince McMahon of something, of some kind of combat sports organisation.\n\n“So it’s absolutely a manifestation of something I’ve thought about over and over again.\n\n“I remember playing with the WWE toys and organising them and playing the matches out and doing the story lines and it was like practise for what it’s like now.\n\n“Obviously, I didn’t know it would be in boxing per say but that’s how it’s kind of worked out.”\n\nI think Misfits Boxing is as close as you can get to that because obviously there’s no predetermined outcomes, nothing’s choreographed or anything like that it’s all real boxing.\n\nMams Taylor on comparisons between WWE and Misfits Boxing\n\nTaylor appeared to come out of nowhere when he teamed up with British promoter Kalle Sauerland to launch Misfits on streaming service DAZN.\n\nBut in fact, it was a long time coming after testing the waters in MMA.\n\nTaylor revealed: \"I was a boxing fan through way of proxy through my brother as well who loved that and I boxed myself from the age of 14.\n\n“Then MMA came about and tried my hand at that and actually put on an MMA show with some friends of mine about 20 years ago.\n\n“So as a fan and someone who has trained it’s something I am very passionate about just in general, combat sports.”\n\nMisfits co-founder KSI rarely misses an event and the man himself is hoping to be in the house to watch the never-before-seen two-on-one bout.\n\nTaylor said: “We’re working on it, hopefully.\n\n\"He hates missing them but he’s got some commitments so we’re trying to work some things around. Hopefully he’ll be there.”"
