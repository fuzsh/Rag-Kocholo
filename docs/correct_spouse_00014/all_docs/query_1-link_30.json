        "text": "Castle has found his real-life Beckett! Actor Nathan Fillion is dating actress Krista Allen, multiple sources confirm to Us Weekly.\n\n“They met a few months ago through friends and it’s going really well. He’s met her son and they get along,” a source tells Us of the sweet new couple.\n\nAllen, 44, who famously dated George Clooney after meeting him on the set of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in 2002, has been married twice before.\n\nIn 1999 she divorced production manager and producer Justin Moritt, with whom she shares son Jake, 18, and in 2012, she divorced Iranian-English rapper Mams Taylor.\n\n“Krista is super happy. She’s been kind of unlucky in love in the past and now she’s found this genuinely nice guy who treats her well,” another source tells Us. “They are having a great time together.”\n\nClooney, 54, moved on to romances with Sarah Larson, Elisabetta Canalis, and Stacy Keibler, before marrying human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in September 2014.\n\nFillion and Allen haven’t been shy about their romance. Allen’s Instagram account is filled with photos of them together. In one shot from June, she is cuddling up to Fillion at a big dinner party with the caption, “Just because. #significantdinner.” The pair also attended Halloween festivities together recently as a satyr and a forest nymph.\n\n“Anyone else feeling horny? #Satyr #ForestNymph #halloweeneve @natefillion,” Allen captioned a funny pic of the Firefly alum, 44, in a mask and costume.\n\nIn early October, pal and actress Dina Meyer also shared a cute selfie with the couple, writing, “@NathanFillion and I make a delicious @KristaAllenXO #selfie sandwich …. Just for you. Want a bite?”\n\nThough his character, mystery writer Richard Castle, is married to Detective Kate Beckett on the hit ABC show Castle, Fillion has kept his own personal life incredibly private in the past. He has previously been linked to actresses Mikaela Hoover and Christina Ochoa, though he has not publicly commented on any of his relationships.\n\nHis Castle leading lady Stana Katic secretly wed her longtime love Kris Brkljac in April 2015."
