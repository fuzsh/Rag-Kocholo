        "text": "As a pediatrician, I treat newborns through adolescents. I’m particularly interested in newborns, helping moms troubleshoot breastfeeding and promoting adolescent health. I aim to make every patient and family feel welcome, heard and informed.\n\nDuring high school, I volunteered at Shriner's Hospital and was inspired daily by the patients. Pediatric patients show so much hope and resiliency, and they are more fun to spend time with! After my residency, I was chosen to be a chief resident. I oversaw the residency program, had an active involvement with the administration at Riley Hospital for Children and spent more clinical time focusing on adolescent health — specifically mental health, reproductive health and care for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) population.\n\nI pride myself on having a laid-back demeanor with patients and families so everyone feels comfortable bringing up concerns. I ensure all questions are answered and that patients and families support the care plan. My goal in caring for adolescents is to help them find their voice/independence in their care.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy spending time with my husband and my young children. We love to explore parks, bake and travel."
