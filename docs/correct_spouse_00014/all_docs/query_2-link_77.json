        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor lived here during her marriage to her second husband, British actor Michael Wilding from 1954 to 1957.\n\nNoticing a for sale sign at Taylor and Wilding hopped over the wall to get a better look at the property. Realizing that the sliding glass door was unlocked, the couple crept inside and began exploring the home which was made of glass and adobe. Elizabeth quickly fell in love. In her book, An Informal Memoir, Elizabeth describes the unique interior: “One whole wall was built of bark with fern and orchids growing up the bark, and the bar was made of stone. And the fireplace had no chimney. There was a device making the smoke go down under the building and out through the barbecue pit.” Elizabeth also recalled that “You really couldn’t distinguish between the outside and inside. And all the colors I loved—off white, white, natural woods, stone, beigy marble. The pool was so beautiful. There were palm trees and rock formations—it looked like a natural pool, with trees growing out of it. It was the most beautiful house I’ve ever seen.” The state of the art home also featured an intercom, automated doors, light dimmers, automated curtains, and a movie screen.\n\nTaylor and Wilding bought the estate for $150,000 after loaning the money from MGM Studios.\n\nThe estate was built in 1953 by architect George MacLean. The architect later became godfather to Elizabeth’s son, Christopher.\n\nMontgomery Clift suffered serious injuries in a car accident after leaving a dinner party here on the evening of May 12th, 1956. Rumour has it Elizabeth ran down the hill, got into the crushed car via a back door, climbed over the front seat and cradled Monty's head in her lap while they waited for the ambulance to arrive at the scene.\n\nThe estate went on the market in 2018 for $15.9 Million and was sold in 2021 for $7.1 Million.\n\nHomes - Celebrity - Entertainment - Actors\n\nLinks: en.wikipedia.org, www.architecturaldigest.com, www.businessinsider.com, www.hollywoodreporter.com, www.today.com, www.youtube.com, www.youtube.com, www.forbes.com, www.mansionglobal.com, dameelizabethtaylor.com\n\nBy: Gorecki"
