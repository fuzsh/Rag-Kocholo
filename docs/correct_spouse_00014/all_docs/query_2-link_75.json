        "text": "Logan Paul is expected to have an involvement when KSI returns to the boxing ring this summer for his first fight since 2019.\n\nThe British YouTuber and rapper famously fought the elder Paul brother twice in 2018 and 2019, drawing their initial bout before winning the rematch in Los Angeles by split decision. But the pair have patched up their bitter feud and are now business partners working on an energy drink called Prime Hydrate.\n\nAnd it appears that Paul will have something to do with KSI's boxing return, which will be co-promoted by the YouTuber and Wasserman Boxing with the Sauerland Brothers Nisse and Kalle. It remains to be seen what exactly Paul's involvement will be, with KSI's manager Mams Taylor letting slip that with Prime playing a part in the show we will likely see an appearance from the American.\n\nTaylor appeared on the Happy Punch Promotions Twitter Space alongside YouTubers Daniel 'Keemstar' Keem, Wade Plem, Yusef 'Fousey' Erakat and Faze Sensei last night, and said that it was even \"a possibility\" that Paul could fight on the card. Asked by Keem if there was a chance that Paul would be involved, he remained coy but complimented the YouTuber-turned-boxer on his draw in the sport.\n\n\"It's a possibility,\" he laughed, before insisting that he \"didn't say anything\" when Keem declared that they had just broken news. \"But look it's a possibility, anything's possible. Obviously Logan is a great guy, a hell of an athlete, he's a great draw and people would love to see him fight, he's made it clear he's got intentions to fight in one capacity or another so we'll see what happens\".\n\nWould you like to see KSI and Logan Paul fight on the same card once again? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below!\n\nPaul has recently returned to Puerto Rico, where he and his brother Jake who is a 5-0 professional boxer, have a purpose-built training facility that they use to prepare for fights. Jake is expected to confirm his ring return soon, with a summer date also in mind, but Logan's coach Milton Lacroix has also appeared in videos from camp.\n\nThe YouTube star's most recent fight took place last June when he fought Floyd Mayweather in an exhibition bout. He went the distance with the 50-0 boxing legend, with no winner being announced at the end of the contest, where Paul weighed in 35lb heavier than his rival.\n\nHe has teased a fight with Brazilian influencer Whindersson Nunes, as well as asking UFC president Dana White if he would be willing to offer him a fight in the octagon. As yet, nothing has been confirmed about his future, nor his brother, who could face a variety of different opponents once he's finished co-promoting Katie Taylor vs Amanda Serrano with Eddie Hearn."
