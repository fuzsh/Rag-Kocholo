        "text": "The Bicycle Thief\n\nPhil is determined to help Luke prove to mom that he is responsible enough to have the brand new bike they just got him. However Phil ends up being the irresponsible one when a hot neighbor clouds his judgment. Meanwhile Mitchell and Cameron take Lily to their first Mommy & Me class, and Jay and Manny have some awkward father and son time.\n\nThe One Where Joey Dates Rachel\n\nPhoebe gets Monica and Chandler a Ms. Pacman arcade game for a wedding present, which leads to some heavy competition between Monica, Phoebe, and, surprisingly, Chandler. Ross gets to teach an important class because of a retiring professor, but soon learns that its on the other side of town, and he doesn't have enough time to get there. Joey takes Rachel to dinner on a pretend date to make her feel better since she can't have a normal relationship due to her pregnancy.\n\nThere Goes the Neighborhood\n\nThe 118 rush to save a man pinned under a Humvee, and a garage band that rocks out too hard. Enlisting Bobby and Athenaâs help, Michael installs a new ârear window,â and turns into an amateur detective after noticing strange behavior at a nearby apartment. Meanwhile, Henâs mother unexpectedly arrives and announces she is moving to LA, and Buckâs re-entry into the dating pool ends in disaster.\n\nDid You Check with the Captain of the Flying Monkeys?\n\nCharlie rethinks the way he treats women when he, Alan and Jake are forced to cheer up a pitiful Evelyn after her serious new boyfriend terminates their relationship. Meanwhile, Charlie teaches Jake some valuable lessons about screening calls from women, but the lesson backfires when Jake reveals a little too much about what he's learned to a disapproving Alan."
