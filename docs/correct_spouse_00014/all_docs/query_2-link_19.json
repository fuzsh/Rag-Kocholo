In Hollywood time that's long enough to get pregnant, married and divorced.\n\nOur spies say the couple have had numerous secret rendezvous at STK and at Eva Longoria's restaurant Beso. Milian also hasn't missed any of Taylor's shows.\n\nThere's the real shocker -- Mams Taylor has gigs.\n\nUPDATE: Christina's peeps tell us she is not dating Mams, he's just a family friend. She sang on one of his songs recently. Our sources, however, totally stick by their story."
