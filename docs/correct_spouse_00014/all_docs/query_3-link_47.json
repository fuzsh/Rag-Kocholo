        "text": "Krista Allen is writing a new book that might be more fact than fiction.\n\nIt was revealed that The Bold and the Beautiful star will not be returning to her role as Dr. Taylor Hayes. The news was announced the day of the Daytime Emmy Awards, where Krista was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series award.\n\nThe award eventually went to the late Sonya Eddy for her role in General Hospital. The actress died after she got an infection after surgery last year.\n\nBut Krista seems to not be worried about losing the award, she tweeted that she felt \"joy\" that Sonya won. Instead, she was more concerned with losing her role and not understanding why.\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nREAD MORE: Sign up to Mirror US's SMS updates for the latest straight from the newsroom\n\n\"I have no idea what's going on,\" she told PEOPLE while attending the award show. The 52-year-old actress added that she knew \"for a long time\" that her role was coming to an end, but the network \"just never announced it.\"\n\nShe added: “The contract was dropped, which is so crazy. It's like, make that make sense.\"\n\nKrista seemed to allude to the fact that everything wasn't all roses behind the scenes of the soap. She didn't say it outright, but the actress shared her possible \"fun\" future plans which could have some hidden meaning.\n\n\"I think I might write a book,\" she said, \"It's based on a true story… About a woman who took over a role on a soap opera and against all odds ended up winning over a fan base and getting nominated for an Emmy. And then there's a lot of backstage drama going on, and she has to find her way.”\n\nShe teased that the book might have a drama level that The Bold and the Beautiful fans are used to. \"I think I could write something really fun, really make it dramatic and really soapy,” she added, “I figure if I could just make a fun book and just make it into a real-life soap opera kind of thing because it kind of feels that way.”\n\n\"But yeah, it could be fun,” she concluded, “It could be like a fun thing.”\n\nKrista played Dr. Taylor Hayes for the last two years on the hit soap opera. This wasn't her first role in a daytime soap - she played Billie Reed on Days of Our Lives in 41 episodes from 1996 to 1999."
