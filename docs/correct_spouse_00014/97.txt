Actress Krista Allen has filed for divorce from her British rapper husband.

The Liar Liar star filed papers at Los Angeles County Superior Court earlier this month (Feb12) to end her short-lived union to Mams Taylor.

The pair wed in October, 2010 but separated in August last year (11).

Allen, who was previously married to Justin Moritt from 1996 until 1999, cited irreconcilable differences as her reason for filing.

They have no children.

Taylor hit the headlines in 2008 when he punched Desperate Housewives hunk Jesse Metcalfe during a bust-up outside a Los Angeles nightspot.
