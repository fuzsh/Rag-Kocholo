Posidonius of Rhodes is also known as Posidonius of Apameia. The first of these names refers to where he taught while the second refers to the town of his birth, Apameia on the Orontes. One must not think of these two as different people. Although he was born in Apameia in Syria, Posidonius was from a Greek family and he was brought up in the Greek tradition. He went to Athens to complete his education, and there he studied under the Stoic philosopher Panaetius of Rhodes . Posidonius travelled widely in the western Mediterranean region and he made many scientific studies on his travels relating to astronomy, geography and geology. Some time not long after 100 BC Posidonius became the head of the Stoic School in Rhodes. While in this position he also held political office in Rhodes. It was in a political position, as ambassador of Rhodes, that he travelled to Rome in 87-86 BC. There he met a number of men who he had known and taught earlier including Cicero In Rome Posidonius visited Gaius Marius , the Roman general and politician who was consul seven times. Marius died on 13 January 86 BC while Posidonius was still in Rome. While there Posidonius became friends with

It may be surprising that Geminus 's name seems to be Latin rather than Greek but as Heath writes [3]:- The occurrence of a Latin name in a centre of Greek culture need not surprise us, since Romans settled in such centres in large numbers during the last century BC. Geminus, however, in spite of his name, was thoroughly Greek. Geminus is believed by many historians to have worked in Rhodes. Certainly his astronomy text uses mountains on Rhodes to make specific points but, as Dicks points out in [1], this is not proof that he worked there. For example, Geminus refers to Mt Atabyrius (today called Mt Attaviros) without giving any indication of where it is but when he refers to Mt Cyllene he is careful to indicate that it is the Peloponnesus. However, since Rhodes was at this time the centre for astronomical research, and was taken as the reference point for latitude in astronomical observations, it is quite possible that Geminus would assume his reader were familiar with the reference points of Rhodes such as Mt Atabyrius without further comment. Geminus was a Stoic philosopher and either a pupil, or perhaps a later follower, ofStoic School Buttons: Chronology, Zeno of Citium, Chrysippus of Soli, Middle, Epictetus, The Sources Aristotle Plato and the Stoics, was teacher at court; and with the ascension of Marcus Aurelius to Emperor of Rome, Stoicism became the philosophy of state.

Panegyric to ConstantiusChlorus, 18.3; tells of the Frank's sea voyage from the Black Sea to their home. (Some Franks were captured and deported to the East) "the unbelievable audacity and unworthy success of a small group of Frankish prisoners who, under the divine Probus, left the Black Sea on ships they had captured, ravaged Greece and Asia, pillaged almost at every point on the Libyan coast, and finally took the town of Syracuse... and having accomplished their long voyage, they entered the Atlantic Ocean... proving by the success of their bold enterprise that no country is sheltered from the fury of pirates, whenever it is within reach of ships."

Paterculus, Gaius VelleiusMathematician Report Index Below is a list of mathematicians. You may choose from this list or report on a mathematician not listed here. In either case, you must discuss with me the mathematician you have chosen prior to starting your report. No two students may write a report on the same mathematician. I would advise you to go to the library before choosing your topic as there might not be much information on the mathematician you have chosen. Also, you should determine the topic early in the term so that you can "lock-in" your report topic!! The report must include: 1. The name of the mathematician. 2. The years the mathematician was alive. 3. A biography. 4. The mathematician's major contribution(s) to mathematics and an explanation of the importance. 5. A historical perspective during the time the mathematician was alive.

Some suggestions on the historical perspective might be:

(a) Any wars etc.

(b) Scientific breakthroughs of the time

(c) Major discoveries of the time

(d) How did this mathematician change history etc.Charting Neptune's Realm The Enigma of Currents In the sixteenth, and well into the seventeenth century, the course of ocean currents was virtually unknown. But as European ships left the familiar shores of continental Europe and their trade routes in the Mediterranean to venture out into the Sea of Darkness, or Great Green Sea of Gloom, as Arab geographers called the Atlantic Ocean, they encountered great rivers within the seathe ocean currents. With an ever increasing number of expeditions to discover new lands and a sea route to the East Indies, mariners slowly accumulated new knowledge of these currents. Gradually, general patterns began to emerge. William Bourne, in his A Regiment for the Sea (1580), describes how the Portuguese in sailing toward the East Indies kept away from the westward setting Agulhas current off Cabo bone sperance (Cape of Good Hope) by sailing a hundred or a hundred and fifty leagues south of the Cape. On the return trip they made use of this self-same current to speed their passage by sailing close to the Cape. When they entered the northern Atlantic, mariners avoided the contrary setting Canary Current, and the Northeast Tradewinds, by making a wide sweep to the northwest until halfway to America, before setting a final course homeward. The Spanish also gained knowledge of this invisible mover of shipsthe great clockwise gyre of water in the North Atlantic. On their way to the West Indies, Spanish ships sailed south past the Canary Islands, then turned west to take advantage of the westward flowing North Equatorial Current. Returning, they sailed north with the Florida Current (between the Bahamas and Florida) to higher latitudes, then headed homeward. Christopher Columbus followed this route on his voyages, but he attributed the favorable eastward set of the Gulf Stream to the effect of tides, rather than recognizing it as part of the continuous circle of current in the North Atlantic.document.write("");

HERMANDAD

a large panel in the church of Dinkelsbuhl. A Crucifixion, with eight scenes from the New Testament, is shown as his in the cathedral, a Christ in Judgment, with Mary and John, and the Resurrection of Souls in the town-hall of Nordlingen. A small Epiphany, once in the convent of the Minorites of Ulm, is in the Holzschuher collection at Augsburg, a Madonna and Circumcision in the National Museum at Munich. Herlens epitaph, preserved by Rathgeber, states that he died on the 12th of October 1491, and was buried at Nordlingen.

In the Romance language spoken on the east coast of Spain in Catalonia it is written germandat or germania. In the form germanic it has acquired the significance of thieves Latin HERMAN DE VALENCIENNES, 12th-century French poet, was born at Valenciennes, of good parentage. His father and mother, Robert and Hérembourg, belonged to Hainault, and gave him for god-parents Count Baldwin and Countess Yoland doubtless Baldwin IV. of Hainault and his mother Yoland. Herman was a priest and the author of a verse Histoire de la Bible, which includes a separate poem on the Assumption of the Virgin. The work is generally known as Le Rome-n de sapience, the name arising from a copyists error in the first line of the poem:[p. 29]

CHAPTER IV.

PROCLUS AND HIS SOURCES

It is well known that the commentary of Proclus on Eucl. Book I. is one of the two main sources of information as to the history of Greek geometry which we possess, the other being the Collection of Pappus. They are the more precious because the original works of the forerunners of Euclid, Archimedes and Apollonius are lost, having probably been discarded and forgotten almost immediately after the appearance of the masterpieces of that great trio. Proclus himself lived 410-485 A.D., so that there had already passed a sufficient amount of time for the tradition relating to the pre-Euclidean geometers to become obscure and defective. In this connexion a passage is quoted from Simplicius who, in his account of the quadrature of certain lunes by Hippocrates of Chios, while mentioning two authorities for his statements, Alexander Aphrodisiensis (about 220 A.D.) and Eudemus, says in one place , âAs regards Hippocrates of Chios we must pay more attention to EudemusE ncyclopedic Theosophical Glossary: Ard-Asr EDITORS' NOTE: This electronic version of the Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary is presented to the public as a work in progress.

Ard-Asr

Ardan See ERIDANUS Ardeshan Ardeshir Babagan Revisor and translator of the Zend-avesta Ardhamatra (Sanskrit) [from ardha half + matra a metrical unit] Half a short syllable; the Nadabindu-Upanishad in speaking of Aum says that the syllable or character A is considered to be Kalahamsa's right wing; U, the left wing; M, the tail of the Swan, and the ardhamatra its head (cf VS 5, 74-5). In the Mahabharata kalahamsa is the name of several species of the hamsa bird, a goose or swan. Ardhamatra is a mystical term for one of the portions of the swan of time Brahma or the manifest or Third Logos of the universe, whose emanation or creative activity is hamsa-vahana (the vehicle or carrier of the swan). Ardhamatra, therefore, has reference to the egoic individuality of the cosmic Third Logos or Brahma (also called Purusha), considered to be "one-half the measure" of the eternal past and the eternal future such egoic individuality being the product in space and time of the continuously reimbodying spirit of the universe, evolving and changing its nature by evolution as the cycles of time pass from the present into the past, and forwards into the future.
