        "text": "Strabo (born c. 64 bce, Amaseia, Pontus—died after 21 ce) was a Greek geographer and historian whose Geography is the only extant work covering the whole range of peoples and countries known to both Greeks and Romans during the reign of Augustus (27 bce–14 ce). Its numerous quotations from technical literature, moreover, provide a remarkable account of the state of Greek geographical science, as well as of the history of the countries it surveys.\n\nStrabo belonged on his mother’s side to a famous family, whose members had held important offices under Mithradates V (c. 150–120 bce) as well as under Mithradates the Great, the opponent of Rome (132–63 bce). His first teacher was the master of rhetoric Aristodemus, a former tutor of the sons of Pompey (106–48 bce) in Nysa (now Sultanhisar in Turkey) on the Maeander (now Menderes) River. He moved to Rome in 44 bce to study with Tyrannion, the former tutor of Cicero, and with Xenarchus, both of whom were members of the Aristotelian school of philosophy. Under the influence of Athenodorus, former tutor of Octavius, who probably introduced him into the future emperor’s circle, he turned toward Stoical philosophy, the precepts of which included the view that one unique principle ceaselessly pervading the whole universe causes all phenomena.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nHistory Buff Quiz\n\nIt was in Rome, where he stayed at least until 31 bce, that he wrote his first major work, his 47-book Historical Sketches, published in about 20 bce, of which but a few quotations survive. A vast and eclectic compilation, it was meant as a continuation of Polybius’s Histories. The Historical Sketches covered the history of the known world from 145 bce—that is, from the conquest of Greece by the Romans—to the Battle of Actium (31 bce) or to the beginnings of the principate of the Roman emperor Augustus (27 bce).\n\nIn 29 bce Strabo visited the island of Gyaros (today known as Yiáros, or Nisós) in the Aegean Sea, on his way to Corinth, Greece, where Augustus was staying. In 25 or 24, together with Aelius Gallus, prefect of Egypt, who had been sent on a military mission to Arabia, he sailed up the Nile as far as Philae. There are then no further references to him until 17 ce, when he attended the triumph of the Roman general Germanicus Caesar (15 bce to 19 ce) in Rome. He died after having devoted his last years to compiling his second important work, his Geographical Sketches. Judging by the date when he wrote his personal notes, he must have worked on the book after his stay in Egypt and then have put it aside from 2(?) bce to 14 ce, when he started the final edition, which he brought to an end about 21 ce.\n\nThe first two books, in effect, provide a definition of the aims and methods of geography by criticizing earlier works and authors. Strabo found fault with the map designing of the Greek scholar Eratosthenes, who lived from c. 276 to c. 194 bce; Eratosthenes had combined astronomical data with coast and road measurements, but Strabo found his work lacking in precision. Although Strabo closely followed the treatise against Eratosthenes of the Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who had lived in the 2nd century bce, he blamed Hipparchus for neglecting the description of the Earth. On the other hand, he appreciated Polybius, who had written, in addition to his historical works, two books on European geography that Strabo admired for their descriptions of places and peoples. Although he praised Poseidonius (Posidonius), the Greek historian and philosopher who lived from about 135 to 51 bce, for his knowledge of physical geography and ethnography, he rejected Poseidonius’s theory of climatic zones and particularly his hypothesis that the equatorial zone was habitable. This critical study led him logically to decide in favour of a descriptive type of geography, based on a map with an orthogonal (perpendicular) projection. The problem of projecting the sphere on a flat surface is not dealt with at any length, for his work, as he said, was designed not for mathematicians but for statesmen who must know countries, natural resources, and customs.\n\nIn Books III to VI, Strabo successively described Iberia, Gaul, and Italy, for which his main sources were Polybius and Poseidonius, both of whom had visited these countries; in addition, Artemidorus, a Greek geographer born about 140 bce and the author of a book describing a voyage around the inhabited Earth, provided him with a description of the coasts and thus of the shape and size of countries. Book VII was based on the same authorities and described the Danube basin and the European coasts of the Black Sea. Writing about Greece, in Books VIII to X, he still relied upon Artemidorus, but the bulk of his information was taken from two commentators of Homer—Apollodorus of Athens (2nd century bce) and Demetrius of Scepsis (born about 205 bce)—for Strabo placed great emphasis on identifying the cities named in the Greek epic the Iliad. Books XI to XIV describe the Asian shores of the Black Sea, the Caucasus, northern Iran, and Asia Minor. Here Strabo made the greatest use of his own observations, though he often quoted historians who dealt with the wars fought in these regions and cited Demetrius on problems of Homeric topography in the region about ancient Troy. India and Persia (Book XV) were described according to information given by the historians of the campaigns of Alexander the Great (356 to 323 bce), whereas his descriptions of Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and the Red Sea (Book XVI) were based on the accounts of the expeditions sent out by Mark Antony (about 83 to 30 bce) and by the emperor Augustus, as well as on chapters on ethnography in Poseidonius and on the book of a Red Sea voyage taken by the Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides (2nd century bce). Strabo’s own memories of Egypt, supplemented by the writings of Poseidonius and Artemidorus, provided material for the substance of Book XVII, which dealt with the African shores of the Mediterranean Sea and with Mauretania."
