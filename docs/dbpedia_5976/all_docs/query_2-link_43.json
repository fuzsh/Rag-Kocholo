In astronomy he is known as the greatest star observer of antiquity as he catalogued the position and brightness of hundreds of stars. Hipparchus was also the first to deduce the precession of the equinoxes (the slight wobble of the Earth’s rotational axis) and estimated the duration of the solar year with amazing accuracy for his time. For these and many other achievements he is regarded by many as the greatest astronomer of antiquity. Apart from his advances in astronomy he is also famous for his discovery of trigonometry.\n\nHipparchus Observing from Alexandria: Taken from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Observatory_in_Alexandria_at_the_Time_of_Hipparchus.jpg\n\nHipparchus used observations from a total eclipse of the Sun to estimate the distance of the Moon from the Earth. The eclipse he used was total at the Hellespont (the narrow strait that separates the European and Asian parts of Turkey) but only part of the Sun was seen covered from Alexandria, in Egypt.\n\nFor a total eclipse of the Sun - Moon - Earth are aligned. The Sun itself is so distant that when viewed from anywhere on Earth, it covers practically the same patch of the sky, with an angular width of about 0.5°.\n\nGeometry of solar eclipse: Taken from: http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/charts/geometry-of-a-total-solar.html\n\nHipparchus concentrated on point C at the edge of the Moon, which during totality, when viewed from the Hellespont (point A), just overlapped point D on the edge of the Sun."
