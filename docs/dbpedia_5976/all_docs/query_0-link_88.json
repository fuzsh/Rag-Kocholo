        "text": "\"And for Aram there came forth the fourth portion, all the land of Mesopotamia between the Tigris and the Euphrates to the north of the Chaldees to the border of the mountains of Asshur and the land of 'Arara.\"\n\n(The book of Jubilees)\n\nThe Arameans are the indigenous people of Syria and Mesopotamia, which the Hebrews called Aram-Naharaim (Aram of the two Rivers). They established several important kingdoms, spread the knowledge of the alphabet, and generally exercised a great influence on the advance of civilization. Their language spread to the neighboring peoples. It survived the fall of Niniveh (612 B.C.) and Babylon (539 B.C.) and remained the official language of the Persian empire (538-331 B.C.). There is evidence to show that Aramaic was widely used in Palestine in Roman times. Hence, Jesus and his direct followers spoke Aramaic, and words in that language have been preserved in the New Testament in transliteration as well as translation.\n\nSince the end of the Aramean kingdom of Osrhoene, the peaceful-minded Arameans have been without any state of their own. They have been constantly victimized for different religious massacres, discrimination, ethnic cleansing and persecutions for hundreds of years, so that they became a minority in the area, which was called by themselves Aram, Aram-Nahrin and Beth Aramaye.\n\nAfter converting to christianity the East and West-Arameans adopted the term \"Syrian\" (in Greek \"Syrioi\", in Aramaic \"Suryoyo\"/\"Sur(y)aya\"), which became both a lingual and a group designation [to avoid a confusion with the residents of today's Syria i will use here the term \"Syriacs\"]. But they continued to call themselves Arameans and used this Greek term as a synonym for their original name.\n\nDespites their common language, culture and history the Arameans of today are divided into various groups (Syriacs, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Maronites, Melkites, Mandeans). Some of the Arameans insist on calling themselves \"Assyrians\"; other prefer the term \"Chaldean\".\n\nThere are no descendants of the historical ancient Assyrians and the Chaldeans of Antiquity were just a group of Arameans. There is no reason for the present-day Arameans to name their nation \"Assyrian\" or \"Chaldean\"- the names given to them by unknown western missionaries in the 16th and 19th century. The only historically correct name for these groups is Aramean, as it is testified by many historians and the great scholars of the Arameans, who enlightened the entire Mankind.\n\nFlavius Josephus (c. 37  c. 100 AD (or CE)) was a 1st century Jewish historian and apologist of priestly and royal ancestry who survived and recorded the Destruction of Jerusalem in 70 and later settled in Rome.\n\n\"Aram had the Arameans, which the Greeks called Syriacs.\"\n\n(Antiquities of the Jews, translated by William Whiston in 1737, Book I, Chapt. 6)\n\nEusebius of Caesarea (c. 275  May 30, 339), was a bishop of Caesarea in Palestine and is often referred to as the father of\n\nchurch history because of his work in recording the history of the early Christian church.\n\n\"and from Aram the Arameans, which are also called Syriacs\"\n\n(Sebastian Brock, \"Eusebius and Syriac Christianity,\" in Harold W. Attridge and Gohei Hata, eds., Eusebius, Christianity, and Judaism (Leiden 1992), p. 226)\n\nAbu Al-husayn 'ali Ibn Al-husayn Al-mas'udi, born 895 in Baghdad [Iraq] and died 957 in al-Fustat [Egypt], was a historian and traveler, known as the Herodotus of the Arabs. He was the first Arab to combine history and scientific geography in a large-scale work.\n\n\"Tur Abdin is the mountain where remnants of the Aramean Syriacs still survive.\"\n\n(Michael Jan de Goeje: Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum III, Leiden 1906, 54, I)\n\nProf. Dietrich Hermann Hegewisch born Dec. 15, 1746 in Quakenbrück [Germany] and died April 4, 1812 in Kiel, was a\n\nprolific german historian at the University of Kiel with a wide span of interests.\n\n\"Do not the Syriacs, as they are usually called, or the Arameans, as they in fact are termed, deserve more attention in world history than they are usually given?\"\n\n(D.H. Hegewisch: Die Aramäer oder Syrer; ein kleiner Beitrag zur allgemeinen Weltgeschichte, Berlinische Monatschrift, 2, 1794, p. 193)\n\n\"The names Syria, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Babylon, etc. stem from the Greeks, who were not familiar with the true geography of these lands when the names first started to be used. Later, partly because of continuing ignorance and partly because of convenience despite having accurate knowledge, they persisted in using them since it would have required something of an effort to give up the old, familiar names and divisions of the countries and switch to the new ones, even if they were more accurate. The old, true, and single name of these lands is Aram; it is mentioned numerous times in the Bible of the Old Testament, and Greek scholars were also familiar with it and probably described the population of these areas as Arameans, though seldom, as they usually continued to use the term Syriac, which had been familiar to the Greeks.\"\n\n(ibid, p. 197)\n\n\"The Syriacs or Arameans were not merely a numerous and large people, they were also a much cultivated people.\"\n\n(ibid, p. 307)\n\nProf. Theodor Mommsen born Nov. 30, 1817, Garding, Schleswig [now in Germany] died Nov. 1, 1903, Charlottenburg, near Berlin, was a German historian and writer, famous for his masterpiece about the History of Rome. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902.\n\n\"the history of the Aramaean or Syriac nation which occupied the east coast and extended into the interior of Asia as far as the Euphrates and Tigris\"\n\n(The History of Rome, written between 1854 and 1856, Leipzig, by Theodor Mommsen, Book First, Chapter One)\n\n\"the Arameans defended their nationality with the weapons of intellect as well as with their blood against all the allurements of Greek civilization and all the coercive measures of eastern and western despots, and that with an obstinacy which no Indo- Germanic people has ever equalled, and which to us who are Occidentals seems to be sometimes more, sometimes less, than human.\"\n\n(ibid, Book Third, Chapter One)\n\nProf. Theodor Nöldeke born March 2, 1836 in Harburg near Hamburg, died December 25, 1930 in Karlsruhe, was the leading german semitic scholar, who studied at Göttingen, Vienna, Leiden and Berlin.\n\n\"The main body of the population of all these wide landscapes from the Mediterranean Sea to beyond the Tigris belonged to a certain nationality, that of the Arameans.\"\n\n(Th. Nöldeke: Assyrios Syrios Syros, in Zeitschrift für klassische Philologie, Hermes 5, Berlin 1871, p. 460)\n\n\"It is well understandable that people have started to transfer the name of the country to the most important nationality and so the name 'syriac' was apprehended ethnological and was equated with 'aramaic'.\"\n\n(ibid, p. 461)\n\n\"Since the times of Alexander [the Great], if not already somewhat earlier, people have started to transfer the name of the Syriacs exclusively over the prevailing in Syria nationality, and in this way this originally political-geographical term became an ethnological one that was identified with the local Arameans.\"\n\n(ibid, p. 468)\n\nFrom the time the Greeks came to have a more intimate acquaintance with Asia, they designated by the name of Syriacs the people who called themselves Arameans.\n\n(Th. Nöldeke, Kurzgefasste Syrische Grammatik (Leipzig, 1880), p. XXIX)\n\nRegarding the name of this nation and its language is the original Aramean in essence also the only one [sic], that for the employment of the present-day scholarship as yet strongly fits.\n\n(Th. Nöldeke, Die Namen der aramäischen Nation und Sprache, in Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft 25 (1871), p. 131)\n\nKarl Eduard Sachau born 20 July 1845 and died 1930 was a German orientalist. He was 1872 professor at the University of Vienna, and in 1876, professor at the University of Berlin, where he was appointed director of the new Seminar of Oriental languages in 1887. He is especially noteworthy for his work on Syriac and other Aramaic dialects.\n\n\"The nation of the Arameans: This national name later, mainly in consequence of Jewish-Christian literature influences, gave way to the Greek designation Syriacs.\"\n\n(Verzeichnis der Syrischen Handschriften der königlichen Bibliothek zu Berlin von Eduard Sachau 1.

For this reason, the language is not called Syriac in the Old [Testament], but Aramaic, which is its genuine and original name, as it appears to us.\n\nFor the Christian doctrine prospered first in that part of Beth Aram, which was called especially by the Greeks Syria, and primarily prospered first in Antiochia, the mother of all cities, where the disciples were called christians for the first time.\n\nAll the people from Beth Aram, who became christians, were called Syriacs.\n\nEveryone of the children of the Aramean race, and especially the clergy, should care for, learn and sponsor the precious Aramaic language.\"\n\n(Treasure of the Syriac Language by Thomas Audo Metropolitan of Urmia, Part I-II. ND Verlag Bar Hebräus, Losser-Holland 1985, preface)\n\nunder the entry \"Aramean\" we find the explanation:\n\nArameans, that is, Syriacs. Aramaic language, [that is] syriac\n\n(ibid, p. 49)\n\nAugin Manna (1867-1928), born in Bet Qopa [Iraq] was the Metropolitan of Basra [Iraq].\n\nIn 1901 he wrote in Mossul a book called \"Selected pieces of aramean literature\".\n\nIn his dictionary Aramaic-Arabic he writes:\n\n\"What induced us to dedicate to the mentioned topic a special chapter is to end the controversy between many Chaldeans and Syriacs. Everyone of them claims the origin for himself and to be the older one, without having a reliable evidence or a funded scientific proof. In order to clarify the actualness of this problem and avoid the controversy, we say: All tribes, which lived in ancient times in the expanded countries, which were limited in the east by Persia, in the west by the Mediterranean, in the north by Asia Minor, by the countries of the Armenians and Greeks and in the south by the Arab peninsula, were known as children of Arams or as Arameans.\n\nThe countries of Babylon and Assur were at all times, even after the Arab conquest, called Beth Aramaye, that is countries of the Arameans. It is not necessary to demonstrate the innumerable testimonies in order to prove this fact; it is a truth, which is known for everybody, who has the slightest idea of the informations about the Church of the East, because the books of our ancestors are full of them. Likewise the countries of Mesopotamia were well-known as the countries of Arams.\n\nYou will realize from the mentioned testimonies here and also from others, that the inhabitants of Edessa and Jazira all of them were Arameans by nation and language. Regarding the dwellers of Syria, it is even more evident.\n\nYou will receive testimonies of the church authors, who confirm this position. It became clear that all countries, which are known today under the designation syriac is, whether in the east or in the west, were since time immemorial known as Aramean, and this is the correct designation.\n\nThe syriac authors whether in the East or in the West, state that the term [Syriac] comes from Suros. Suros was a man of Aramean origin, who founded according to their opinion the city of Antiochia and conquered the countries of Syria and Mesopotamia. Following him these countries were called Syria and their inhabitants Syriacs, as today the inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire are called Ottomans.\n\nThe Syriacs generally, whether from the East or from the West were not called Syriacs in former times, but Arameans in dependance on their progenitor Aram, the son of Shem, the son of Noah.\n\nThe name 'Syriac' dates from a time about 400 or 500 B.C.\n\nThe term Syriac was adopted by the East-Arameans (Chaldeans and Assyrians) after Christ through the apostles, who had proselytized these countries.\"\n\n(Bishop J.E. Manna, Chaldean-Arabic Dictionary, Babel Center Publications. Beirut 1915, p. 11-21)\n\nAlphonse Mingana, the theologian, historian, orientalist, and a former priest, was born on the 23 December, probably in 1878, in the Christian village of Sharansh al-'Ulya in the district of Zakho [North Iraq] and passed away on 5 December 1937.\n\nHe wrote a book called \"Key of the Aramean language or complete or practical Grammar of the two syriac dialects of the Occident and Orient\" in Mosul in 1905.\n\nHe says:\n\n\"the dependence of these vowels on those of Arameans obliges us to find a centre where the culture of the Aramaic language was flourishing, and this centre is the school of Baghdâd, which was, as we have already stated, under the direction of Nestorian scholars, and where a treatise on Syriac grammar was written by the celebrated Hunain.\"\n\n(Rev. A. Mingana & A. S. Lewis (eds.), Leaves From Three Ancient Qur'âns Possibly Pre-`Othmânic With A List Of Their Variants, 1914, Cambridge: At The University Press, p. xxxi.)\n\n\"In fact, no Church can claim to have studied the Scriptures more, carefully, and to have applied all the scientific resources of the early ages of Christianity to biblical criticism more steadily than the Syriac community. From the second century till the first quarter of the seventh, eight different versions of the New Testament were produced by genuine researches of the Aramaean population, spreading from the Mediterranean shores to the East of Persia, and from the massif of the Taurus to the Arabian peninsula [...] On the other hand, the writers of the Gospels, being from an Aramaic-speaking population, while writing in Greek were generally thinking in Syriac, and the Aramaic stamp |150 of their phrases is sometimes so strong that without a knowledge of this language and the reading of the versions which are written in it, the real thought of the sacred author will perhaps be misunderstood.\"\n\n(A. Mingana, New documents on Philoxenus of Hierapolis and on the Philoxenian version of the bible. The Expositor, 9th series vol. 19 (1920) pp. 149-150)\n\nin \"The Early Spread of Christianity in Central Asia and the Far East\":\n\n\"It is not sufficiently realized by modern scholars that the immense majority of the members of the Nestorian Church living east of the Tigris were of Persian, and not Semitic or Aramean birth and extraction\".\n\n(Asia Research Associates reprint of The John Rylands Library, vol. 9, No. 2, Part I., Foreword)\n\nBishop Israël Audo, born 6 Aug 1859 in Alqosh [Iraq] and passed away on 16 Feb 1941, was the brother of Touma Audo. He was appointed as bishop of Mardin in 1909.\n\nHe wrote a book about the Genocide on the Arameans called \"The Book on the persecutions of the christian Armeniens and Arameans of Mardin, Diyarbakir, Séert, Djézireh-Ibn-Omar and Nsibin which took place in the year 1915\".\n\nHe also wrote an exercise book in Aramaic language which was finished on March 3rd, 1952 by the monk Yonan Bar-Chabbah Margaya (of the diocese of Zakho, Iraq) and kept (preserved) to the Chaldean monastery of Bagdad.\n\n(Jacques Rhétoré, Les Chrétiens aux bêtes Préface par J-P Péroncel-Hugoz Etude et présentation par Joseph Alichoran, Les Editions du Cerf, Paris, 2005)\n\nWe see that there is no motif for the Arameans to call the Aramaic Nation \"Assyrian\" or \"Chaldean\". The present-day Arameans will not increase the respect of other peoples towards their long and venerated History by neglecting their own name for foreign, wrong and mistaken ones!"
