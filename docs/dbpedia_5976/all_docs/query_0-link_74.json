        "text": "THE SELEUCID EMPIRE. 358-251 BC. HOUSE OF SELEUCUS\n\nCHAPTER 11.\n\nSYRIA\n\nThe reigns of the first Seleucids have hitherto been traced in regard to Asia Minor; they have appeared but as a long struggle for the possession of that country. But while it is in this light that the surviving records show them, while this perhaps they principally were, the successors of Seleucus wished also to preside over the life of that remoter world which the Greek had come to know beyond the Taurus, to be the sovereign power over the ancient Aramaean and Babylonian peoples, over the husbandmen and horsemen of Iran. But of the work they did there, of the cities they built, of the Hellenic communities they planted far and wide, of the way in which the native peoples looked upon this new element thrust into their midst and upon their alien overlordsâof all that what memorial is left?\n\nThe Seleucid domain towards the east consisted, as we have seen, of three main divisions, the lands immediately to the south of the Taurusâthat is Cilicia, Northern Syria, and Mesopotamiaâthe lands of the lower Euphrates and Tigrisâ that is, the Assyrio-Babylonian countryâand lastly, Iran. We will take each of these separately and see what can be made out of Seleucid rule there up to the accession of Antiochus III. For all of them our evidence is two-fold, literary and archaeological, both sorts scanty enough. In the remains of historians only a notice here and there occurs relating to some part of these countries, as they were touched by the interminable wars; from the geographers the names of cities can be gathered which bear witness to the Hellenizing activity of the Seleucid kings, and sometimes show on what main pivots geographically the life of those days turned. The archaeological evidence may be multiplied in time by the traveler and excavator; but at present practical difficulties have prevented the examination of most of this field, and we have no series of Seleucid inscriptions, as in Asia Minor. The coins, lastly, can tell us something, although the extreme uncertainty which hangs about their places of minting makes this line of evidence a seductive, rather than a safe, guide.\n\nThe land which we call Syria is created by the line of mountain which goes from the Taurus on the north as far as the Gulf of Akaba in the Red Sea. These mountains prevent the Arabian desert, traversed by the Euphrates and Tigris, from extending quite to the eastern shore of the Mediterranean. They interpose a belt of habitable country between the expanse of sea and the expanse of sand. From its position Syria has always been the bridge between Egypt and Asia. But it was not only traversed by a world-route going north and south, it was crossed east and west by the routes from Babylon and the Further East, which found on its coasts their nearest outlet to the Mediterranean, and in the Cilician Gates their natural door into Asia Minor. It belongs to the Mediterranean lands, and at the same time is of those lands the most closely connected with the great seats of Asiatic civilization.\n\nThe line of mountain on which Syria is formed is a double one. From end to end a depression divides two parallel ranges. Sometimes the floor of the depression rises with the mountains to a considerable height above the sea, as in Al-Bika (Coele-Syria in the narrow sense) between the Lebanon and Antilibanus; sometimes it sinks even below sea-level, as in the Jordan valley. The mountains themselves have different names in different parts of their line. Sometimes they are too high and rugged to be habitable near the summit; in that case they come as a barrier between the people who inhabit the depresÂ­sion and those of the outside slopes; sometimes they are low enough to be habitable in all their breadth; Judaea covers the high ground between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. The depression makes the bed of different rivers, the Orontes, Al-Litani, the Jordan; the two former burst through the western range to the Mediterranean; the Jordan ceases before finding an exit.\n\nThe name of Syria, however, extends somewhat farther than the two parallel ranges and the lands which thence draw their water. It covers those adjoining lands on the north which receive their water from the Taurus and its foot-hills, and which extend eastwards as far as the Euphrates, where it most nearly approaches the Mediterranean. They rise above the level of the desert, and of the plains in which the depresÂ­sion just spoken of ends to northward. Between these plains and the Euphrates they intervene as a sort of plateau pushed out from the Taurus. The plains are the natural center of Northern Syria, receiving the Orontes from the south as well as streams from the Taurus on the north, communicating through the gorge of the Lower Orontes with the coast and by an easy ascent with the plateau of inner Syria. The climate of the plateau is other than that of the plains and coast. It is a more arid and barer world. The soil yields under labor, but is apt to be stony. There are here longer winters and more parching summers. But it is crossed by the roads to the Euphrates, and it is in Aleppo that the life of modern Syria finds its center.\n\nThe administrative system according to which Northern Syria was divided under Seleucus and his first successors canÂ­not be traced with any clearness. We know that the Seleucis consisted of the four satrapies of Antioch, Seleucia, Apamea and Laodicea, and outside of this there lay to the north Cyrrhestice and Commagene. To the south the frontier between Seleucid and Ptolemaic Syria was probably, on the coast, the river Eleutherus, and in the interior some point in the valley called Marsyas or Massyas.\n\nIn this country the invasive Greek element soon made itself thoroughly at home. Syria became a ânew Macedonia.â Its districts and rivers were renamed after those of the motherÂ­land. The mountain region north of the mouth of the Orontes, perhaps from some resemblance to the mountains north of Tempe, became Pieria, the Orontes itself Axius, and so on. Local attachments had to be found for the old Greek legends. At Daphne, four miles from Antioch, the place was shown where the nymph Daphne, pursued by Apollo, was changed into a bay-tree. It was in this region that Typhon was blasted by Zeus; the river-bed, in fact, had been formed by his writhings. The wandering heroes of Greek mythology were especially useful in making these connections. On the Amanus mountains Orestes had been delivered from his madness, as the name provedâAmanus, âa-mania.â lo naturally had left traces of herself, and Triptolemus, as we shall presently see.\n\nThe establishment of Hellenic communities in barbarian Asia was not, of course, the outcome of spontaneous immigraÂ­tion only; we see in it rather the fixed policy of the kings. A Greek population could not exist except as grouped in Greek cities, and these cities the kings were zealous to build. Their citizens, no doubt, were to a considerable extent Greeks driven from their old homes by political or economic causes, or drawn by hopes of advantage, but they consisted also of soldiers, Greek and Macedonian, settled by royal order, and also, one must believe, of natives and half-breeds, who had put on the externals of Hellenism. The lower classes were perhaps frankly barbarian; but whatever the real parentage of the citizen-body, it was in theory and guise Macedonian or Greek. It was in the Orontes valley that the life of Seleucid Syria pulsed most strongly. Of the four great cities established by Seleucus Nicator, three were here, Seleucia, Antioch, and Apamea.\n\nSeleucia-in-Pieria guarded the mouth of the river. The coast of Northern Syria, ramparted by hills which jut out to sea in rocky promontories, offers little friendliness to ships. But where the Orontes breaks through this wall, a bay, some ten miles across, reaches from Mount Coryphaeus (mod. Jabal Musa) on the north to the great landmark of the coast, the towering Mount Casius (mod. Al-Akra) on the south. Along the inner recess of the bay lies a crescent-shaped plain, presenting to the sea a fringe of sand-dunes and salt pools, but a little inland covered with corn-fields, with figs and pomeÂ­granates, and enfolded by the rich background of wooded hills. At the southern extremity of this plain, close under Mount Casius, the Orontes flows into the sea; at the northern extremity, about five miles off, was built the city of Seleucia, above what was in those days the principal harbor of the coast. The mountain here rises from the sea in a series of ledges or terraces. From the quay one ascended to a level which stood some 20 or 30 feet above the waves, beyond which a much higher shelf rose in rocky walls of 400 or 500 feet. It was on this shelf that the upper city of Seleucia lay. Behind it were the wild contours of the Pierian range. At its feet along the level was the lower city, containing the harbor, the warehouses, and the âouter townâ. Set upon precipices, Seleucia was remarkable for its strength. Mighty walls, the work of kings, supplemented the cliffs. Climbing streets and rocky stairways connected its upper and lower parts. Its temples and buildings were displayed in their full magnificence by the rising ground. It was worthy to be the gateway of a great kingdom.\n\nThe legend of the founding of Seleucia by Seleucus Nicator after sacrifice on Mount Casius is given by a late writer. That it was really the first Seleucus who founded it is open to no doubt. Bearing his name, the city worshipped him as its god. It was granted the possession of his body by Antiochus I, and a temple was built over his sepulcher, with a sacred precinct attached, the Nicatoreum.\n\nIt was not necessary for those voyaging to Antioch to disembark at Seleucia. Till as late as the Crusades the Orontes was navigable as far as Antioch itself. From the mouth of the river the traveler would ascend, having on his left the plain of Seleucia and on his right the base of Mount Casius. This region was once full of human life. Casius was vested in immemorial sanctity as the holy mountain of some Semitic Baal whom the Greeks, of course, called Zeus. Its summit was too sacred to be mounted. The festivals of the god periodically called forth gay throngs of worshippers from the capital. Today it is a wilderness, given up to the jackal, though the remains of ancient works and once well-trodden roads can still be found among its growth of oleanders. Presently, as the traveler continued to ascend the river, the mountains would close in on the left as well; he would be in the gorge, some six miles long, by which the Orontes cuts through the coast range to the sea, a place of extraordinary and romantic beauty, not unlike the Thessalian Tempe. From the gorge he emerges upon the plains of inner Syria. The spur of Casius, however, on his right, continues to keep close to the bank, splendidly covered with timber and flowering shrubs, and sending down a thousand torrents into the river. The chain ends in Mount Silpius, round which the Orontes makes its westward bend, coming from the south. Beyond Mount Silpius to the east is open country, the plain of Amyce, with the great levels of the lake of Antioch beginning some ten miles farther on.\n\nUnder the northern slopes of Silpius rose the new Seleucid city. The beauty for which Antioch was notable was derived in part from its setting, the near background of wild mountain contrasting delightfully with the rich culture of its well-watered plain. Its position was favorable to growth in greatness and riches. The climate, except in the matter of some malignant winds from the north, was excellent; the soil was very fertile; and, in addition to these advantages, it was admirably placed with regard to the commerce of the world. The Orontes valley here opens out into the plains which, as has been said, are the natural center of Northern Syria. Along this way went the regular land-routes from Babylonia and Iran to the Mediterranean. It suffered indeed from certain inconveniences. The most serious was the frequency of earthquakes in Northern Syria. Besides this the numerous torrents from Silpius, which added to the cityâs charm and made it singularly fortunate in its supply of good water, had the drawback of being sometimes swollen and intractable, when they spread devastation on the slopes.\n\nBefore Seleucus, Antigonus had chosen this region as the site of one of his principal cities. But the two designs did not exactly correspond. Seleucus found the infant city of Antigonia north of the Orontes on a stream (Arceuthus, mod. Kara-su) which carried to the Orontes the overflow of the Lake of Antioch. He marked out Antioch along the southern bank of the Orontes on the level strip, two miles broad, between river and mountain. He avoided building on the slope for fear of the torrents. The city was designed by the architect Xenarius, according to the practice of the time, on a regular plan with straight-ruled thoroughfares. It formed an extended oblong, the main street running through it parallel with the river, and making a long vista from end to end.\n\nThe legend of the foundation of Antioch, as given by Malalas, represents what the Antiochenes liked to be believed as to the origin of their city. In naming the different constituents of which the first population was formed it perhaps reflects some historical facts. According to this legend Antioch had a claim to be held one of the first-born Greek colonies, no parvenue of Macedonian creation. It claimed affinity with Athens and Argos; Io, the daughter of Inachus, had died there, and the party of Argives, led by the Attic Triptolemus, who had gone in quest of her, had settled on Mount Silpius, and their descendants had made the nucleus of Antioch. They appealed to the name which the native Aramaeans gave the great city, Ione, as the Greeks pronounced it; it meant, of course, in reality no more than âcity of the Greeks (Javan).â That there was an Athenian element in the population first settled by Antigonus at Antigonia and transferred by Seleucus to Antioch is quite possible; both the coins and the monuments of Antioch put forward the connection with Athens. It is allowed by Malalas that a good part of the original colonists were Macedonians. Cretans and Cypriots are also mentioned.\n\nDuring the reigns of the first successors of Seleucus Antioch grew. To the original city of Seleucus a second city was added with its own separate wallâa foundation, according to Strabo, âof the resident population,â whatever that may mean. A third quarter was founded on an island in the Orontes opposite the existing double city, when Seleucus II, driven from Asia Minor, made Antioch his residence. It was perhaps in this island quarter that the palace of the later Seleucids lay. A bridge, of course, connected it with the mainland, and Antioch was thus become a tripolis. Seleucus II probably only began to build, since the island city is represented by Libanius as the work of his son, Antiochus III.\n\nIt would seem that at the foundation of the new cities of that age a cult was instituted of the Fortune of the city, that is, the spiritual personality of the city, and an image of it was set up. According to stories told in later times a virgin was actually sacrificed, and thereby identified in some way with this soul of the city; but the stories possibly have no basis but the image itself. The image of Antigonia, when Seleucus destroyed the foundation of his rival, was transferred to Antioch and worshipped in the new city till it was again removed to Rhossus on the coast. But Antioch had a Fortune of its own. The sculptor, Eutychides of Sicyon, a pupil of the great Lysippus, was commissioned to make its image. Of all the great works of art with which Antioch the Beautiful was adorned this is the only one which retains a visible form for us today. A copy of it in marble exists in the Vatican, just as it is shown on many of the coins of Antioch. The personified Antioch sits with a certain noble freedom, holding an ear of corn in her hand, her head crowned with flowers, and a small figure, representing the river Orontes, rising out of the ground at her feet. The original must have had all that dramatic effectiveness which stamps the products of Greek sculpture in the third century B.C.\n\nA chief glory of Antioch was the paradise of Daphne, which lay between river and mountain some four or five miles below the city. The place today is notable for its rich greenery and rushing streamsâthe âHouse of the Watersâ (Bait-al-Ma). In ancient times these streams ran through the gloom of giant cypresses which encompassed the temple of the Pythian Apollo. Under their shadow, or among the bay-trees and oleanders, the population of Antioch spent their hours of pleasure. A course for games, of which the god was patronâan imitation of the Pythia of Greeceâwas made near the temple, and Daphne was continually filled with the noise of festivals and the glitter of gay processions. The image of Apollo, put up by Seleucus I, was the work of the Athenian Bryaxis. It represented Apollo in his form as Musagetes with the lyre and the long garment down to the foot. Other lesser temples rose among the trees. The place was a sanctuary, and as such, one would think, did not tend to diminish the criminality of the great city close by. Its whole circuit was eighty stadia.\n\nThe high-priesthood of Apollo at Daphne was a position of ease and dignity. It seems not to have been annual but permanent, since we find Antiochus III conferring it upon a distinguished servant who, after the long campaigns in Asia Minor, was too broken for further fatigues.\n\nThe third great city of Seleucus, Apamea, dominated the middle Orontes. The course of the river between the neighborhood of Apamea and the point where it issues from the mountains to make its westward bend round Silpius is very ill known. About Apamea the valley widens out into a swampy basin. Continual streams fall into it from the hills on the east and produce a rank vegetation. Alongside of the river stretch reedy lagoons. It is a district which seems hardly to belong to dry Syria. Apamea stood on the lower slopes of the eastern hills. South of it comes one of those depressions in the range which opened out easy communications between the Orontes valley and the east. Seleucus seems to have found here an earlier settlement of Macedonian soldiers, who called their city Pella after the Macedonian capital. Whether the altar of the Bottiaean Zeus, at which the city worshipped, was really put up by Alexander himself, as the tradition asserted, may be questioned. Apamea became the military headquarters of Syria, if not of the Empire. Here was the central office for the army and the military schools. Here were the government studs, which embraced at one time more than 30,000 maxes and 300 blood stallions. Here Seleucus placed the 500 elephants which he got from the Punjab.\n\nThe neighborhood of Apamea seems to have been dotted with settlements of soldiers, which formed petty townships dependent upon the great city. Strabo gives the names of Casiani, Megara, Apollonia, and Larissa. The sites of none of these are known except that of Larissa. This was the modern Shaizar, set upon a rock of reddish-yellow limestone, which stands up precipitously above the Orontes on its western bank. Just south of this the river issues out of a narrow gorge that has been compared to the Wye at Chepstow, and Larissa is thus a position which must have been always strategically important as guarding the entrance into the Apamea basin. The settlers in Larissa were Thessalians, and it was after the Thessalian Larissa that the township on the Orontes was called. They furnished horsemen to the first agema of the royal cavalry, and their descendants seem to have kept up for more than a hundred years at least after the death of Seleucus the tradition of horsemanship and prowess.\n\nThe remaining one of the four great cities was not in the Orontes valley, but at one of the few safe harborages along the rocky coastâLaodicea, called after Laodice, the mother of Seleucus. It stood on the coast about in a line with Apamea in the Orontes valley, and communicated both with it and Antioch by roads across the mountain. These roads, however, are said to be difficult in winter, and Laodicea did not possess the advantages of Seleucia and Antioch in standing on a great commercial route between the Mediterranean and the East. It offered, however, a good harbour, nearer than Seleucia, to ships coming from the south or from Cyprus, and it had its own produce to export. This consisted mainly in wine. The hills behind the city were terraced almost to the top with vineyards, and Laodicean wine found a large market in Egypt.\n\nThese four cities show us the chief centers of life in the Seleucis. But they were only the first of a growing number of communities, Greek in speech and structure, which overÂ­spread the country during the rule of Macedonian kings and Roman emperors. The hills and valleys are full of the remains of this departed life. But the very names of the towns have mostly perished. A few gathered from ancient authors cannot in most cases be certainly fixed to particular sites. On the coast in the Bay of Issus was a foundation of Alexanderâs, Alexandria, the modern Alexandretta. Its relative importance, of course, was not so great as it is to-day, when it is the main port of Northern Syria. We hear of a Heraclea and an Antioch in Pieria, of Meleagru-charax in the plain of Antioch, of Platanus on the road through the hills from the great Antioch to Laodicea of Lysias and Seleucobelus, which seem to have been among the dependent townships of Apamea. The ancient Arethusa, a colony of Seleucus I according to Appian, is represented by Arrastan. In the region of the Upper Orontes and the Lake of Kadesh, round which are the remains of a once numerous population, some of them classical, we have Laodicea-on-Lebanon. South of it the Lebanon and Antilibanus close in and make the narrow valley, called by the ancients Marsyas. In this there was a Chalcis, and near the sources of the Orontes, Heliopolis (mod. Baalbek).\n\nThe great desert east of the Orontes valley made a blank for civilization. Only in the neighborhood of the hills which divide the desert from the valley is a strip of country, treeless and bare-looking, but covered In the spring with grass and flowers, and repaying the toil of irrigation. Along this also are abundant remains of the people who dwelt here in the days of Greek and Roman ascendancyâtheir sepulchers, their buried cities, and dry cisterns. Towards the north the desert ceases as the land begins to rise. We reach the plateau of inner Syria. Here the traces of a great population are thicker than ever. In Al-Jabal al-Ala, the most northerly of the hills which bound the Orontes valley to the east, merging on the side away from the valley by gradual declivities with the plateau, there are âtwenty times more Greek and Roman antiquities than in all Palestine.â The road from Antioch to the modern Dana, to the north-east of Al-Ala, is one series of ruins on both sides of the way. It is here that a traveler asserts he was never out of sight of architectural remains, of which he could sometimes see from ten to twelve heaps from a single point of view.\n\nThe plateau is divided by the river Chalus (mod. Kuwaik), which flows from the hills of Cyrrhestice and loses itself in a salt swamp on the confines of the desert. From the hills which divide the plateau from the plain of Antioch as far as the Chalus valley, the undulating country is capable of cultivation, and was once populous. It is now neglected and to a large extent waste. The valley of the Chalus is much more fertile. Where it opens out into a rich plain, stood, no doubt, long before Seleucus, the Syrian city of Chalep. This became a new Greek city with the name of Beroea. The route from Antioch to Hieropolis passed through it, and it must have drawn its resources from the road as well as from its fields. Aleppo, as we call it, is to-day the most important centre in Northern Syria. Near Beroea, and apparently to the north of it, Strabo mentions a Heraclea whose site has not been identified. Beside the route from Antioch to the Euphrates, which crossed the Chalus valley at Beroea, there was one more to the south, reaching the Euphrates at Barbelissus (mod. Balis). This route crossed the Chalus only one mile above the salt marsh in which it ends, and here on a lower terrace of the hills which overlook it was the city of Chalcis. The modern Kinnasrin, the frontier town towards the desert, which corresponds in position to Chalcis, holds a very inferior place with respect to Aleppo. Under the Seleucids the relative importance of the two cities was perhaps reversed. We know almost nothing of the life of inner Syria in those days, but we may conclude something from the fact that the region of the lower Chalus was called, not after Beroea, but Chalcidice.\n\nBetween the Chalus and the Euphrates the country is today almost unoccupied, one âlevel sheep-tractâ. We hear of a Seleucid colony, Maronea or Maronias, which seems to have been on the road from Chalcis to Barbelissus. But the great place of this region was the ancient Syrian town Mabog, about twelve miles from the Euphrates. It stands in the center of a rocky plain, some 600 feet above the river, without running water or any advantage likely to create a place of importance. Its greatness had a religious ground. Men had congregated here about a famous temple of the Mother-goddess, whom under different names the Semites adored, here as Atargatis. Under Greek rule its name was temporarily Hieropolis, Seleucus himself according to one statement having made the innovation. It strikes coins under Antiochus IV, and had therefore been certainly Hellenized before that time. Its old name in the Greek form of Bambyce was still in use, and survives as Mambij to this day.\n\nThe plateau of Beroea stood to the east of the plain of Antioch; to the north of the plain rose the lower spurs of the Taurus. The upland tracts among them were not an unfavorable field for Hellenic colonization. Although the soil was generally light and stony, the spring crops were productive, and the climate was healthier than in the plain. At the beginning of the reign of Antiochus III the troops drawn from this region, consisting no doubt of Macedonian and Greek settlers, numbered 6000 men, and formed an element of account in the royal army. The whole political situation in Syria might be affected by the disposition of these colonies. These things would point to a liberal plantation of Hellenic communities in the region in question. We cannot, however, get from our authorities the names of the new foundations, except one or two. Cyrrhus, the city after which the whole region was called Cyrrhestice, borrowed its name from Cyrrhus in Macedonia. Later on, another city, Gindarus, in a valley opening out into the plain of Antioch, seems to have taken the first place. Strabo calls it the âacropolis of Cyrrhestice.â In the disordered times of the later Seleucids it probably became what Strabo describes it, a robber-hold. One Greek city of these hills goes back perhaps to Alexander himself, Nicopolis. It stood on the eastern slopes of the Amanus, in the valley of the river now called Kara-su, on the place where Darius had pitched before he crossed the Amanus to meet Alexander at Issus. North of Cyrrhestice the hill country of Commagene lay above the Euphrates. Here Hellenism was probably later in establishing itself. How soon Samosata, the capital, became a Greek city we do not know. The Antioch mentioned in Commagene may have been founded by one of the later Seleucids, or even by the semi-Iranian dynasty which reigned here in the last century B.C. and used Antiochus as a royal name to show its affinity with the house of Seleucus. Whether Doliche and Chaonia were Greek cities is a question.\n\nThere is a line of Greek foundations along the Euphrates at the places of passage, and in coming to those on the eastern bank we enter upon the province of Mesopotamia. By this name the Greeks understood the country between the Euphrates and Tigris above Babylonia. Only that part of Mesopotamia which lay far enough north to receive water from the Taurus was habitable land, and this region was divided from Babylonia by the great desert. From Syria on the other hand it was separated only by the Euphrates, and thus by geographical position, as well as by the homogeneity of their population, Syria and Mesopotamia formed almost one country.\n\nThe most northerly place of passage on the Euphrates was at Samosata in Commagene, and here on the Mesopotamian bank opposite Samosata stood a Seleucia. A much more important passage was that where a bridge of boats crossed the river on the direct route between Antioch and Edessa. Either head of the bridge was held by a Greek town, a foundation of the first Seleucus. On the Syrian bank was Zeugma, called after the bridge, on the Mesopotamian Apamea (mod. Birejik), with a rocky fortress of exceptional strength. Where the road from Syria to the East by way of Hieropolis struck the Euphrates was a Europus, called after the native city of Seleucus I, and near it a Nicatoris. The ancient route between Syria and Babylon crossed the Euphrates at Thapsacus, and some twelve miles lower down, on the opposite bank, was Nicephorium, founded, according to Isidore and Pliny, by Alexander, and acÂ­cording to Appian by Seleucus I. Whether the Kallinikon, said by the Chronicon Paschale to have been founded by Seleucus II Kallinikos, was identical with Nicephorium is a matter of dispute. There seem to have been other Greek cities in this neighborhood. The immense importance of the ford at Thapsacus, as one of the cardinal points in the traffic of the world, no doubt made the Greek rulers wish to secure it strongly. Amphipolis, described as a foundation of Seleucus I, is identified by Pliny with Thapsacus. It was perhaps adjacent to the old native town. A city called Aenus is also mentioned as opposite or close by. Near Nicephorium, a Zenodotium is mentioned. On the Euphrates below Thapsacus we can point to no more Greek cities till we reach Babylonia except one, Europus, about half-way between Nicephorium and Babylonia. It was the native town of Dura Hellenized, and the old name continued in use with the people of the land.\n\nWe come now to the Greek cities of the interior of Mesopotamia. Their appearance gave the country a new character. Under the old Oriental empires the immemorial village life had predominated, although there had been towns like Haran and Nisibis. Now new centres of life sprang up everywhere in the Greek cities. It was along the river valleys, as we saw in Syria, that these cities were for the most part built. In Mesopotamia, the most westerly of the streams sent down from the Taurus and its foot-hills combine in the Belichas (mod. Al Balikh) before they fall into the Euphrates by Nicephorium. Moving up the Belichas from the Euphrates, we come, at a point where another stream comes into the Belichas from the west, to Ichnae, called after a city of Macedonia, and described as âa Hellenic city, a foundation of the Macedonians.â At the time of the campaign of Crassus it was apparently little more than a fortress. In the valley of the western tributary we have Batnae, a gathering-place of merchants, since here the great eastern road from Hieropolis crossed the valley, described as a Macedonian colony, and near the source of the tributary Anthemusias, the first station on the road from Apamea to Babylon. In the valley of the Belichas itself, understood to include that of the Scirtus (mod. Daisan), we have the two important cities of western Mesopotamia. They were both old native towns transformed. The more northern, Urhai, or as the Greeks wrote it, Orrhoe, was given the new Macedonian name of Edessa. The native element was allowed to retain its place here to a larger degree than was usual in the new cities. According to Malalas, Seleucus first made it an Antioch. In later times it was one of the chief seats of Syriac letters, proud of its pure dialect. In the modern Urfa the old name survives. The other city on the Belichas was Haran, associated in our minds with the story of Abraham. Its transformation to the Macedonian colony of Carrhae seems to be rightly attributed to Alexander himself. Seleucus, as we saw, found a body of Macedonian soldiers settled here in 312. It became one day tragically famous by the disaster of Crassus.\n\nIn the valley of the Chaboras (Al-Kabur), and along those many streams which go to form it, we cannot show Greek cities as we can to the west. That they existed is highly probable, but if so, their names have perished. There is one exception, Nisibis. It became an Antioch. Part of the new population is said to have consisted of Spartans. An inscripÂ­tion speaks of it as the âholy city, which Nicator built, upon the stream of Mygdon, in a land of olivesâ It was a great junction of roads. The highway of communication between Syria and lands beyond the Tigris ran through it. In this case also the old name prevailed in the long run over the new. The district, in which Nisibis-Antioch was, got from the Macedonians the name of Mygdonia after their home. Antioch-in-Mygdonia was the cityâs official name. We may perhaps infer that the district was more completely approÂ­priated by the new civilization than we could guess from the one city, whose existence is established.\n\nWe have followed what can still be traced of the network of Greco-Roman cities cast by the new rulers of the East over the country of the Aramaeans (Syria and Mesopotamia). We should like to know more than we do of the inner life of these communities. The political forms of the Greek city-state were, of course, maintained. We should have found in each the periodically elected magistrates, a boule and a demos passing decrees after the usual pattern and inscribing them on tables of brass and stone. The social organization of the citizens also probably followed the Greek type. At Antioch the people was divided into tribes, and we may infer the same thing in the other cities. The gymnasium, with the body of epheboi attached to it, was an essential feature. But to what extent the old Hellenic spirit survived in these forms, to what extent the new settlers preserved their type in the new environment, escapes our discovery. According to a speech which Livy puts into the mouth of Manlius (189 B.C.) there had been rapid degeneracy. âJust as in the case of plants and live-stock, breed alone will not maintain the quality against the influences of soil and climate, so the Macedonians of Alexandria in Egypt, of Seleucia and Babylonia, and all the other scattered colonies throughout the world, have degenerated into Syrians, into Parthians, into Egyptians.â Titus Flamininus said of the armies of Antiochus III that they were âall Syrians.â Whether this testimony is biassed, or again whether there was the same degeneration in the smaller cities as in great cosmopolitan centres like Antioch, we have not the means of making out. The Syrian Greeks were regarded as inferior by the Greeks of the motherland.\n\nIt must be admitted that we do not get a favourable picture of them from their fellow-countryman, Posidonius of Apamea (circ. 135-51 B.C.); and even if his description be true only of the later days of the Seleucid dynasty, the decline must have begun long before. âThe people of these cities are relieved by the fertility of their soil from a laborious struggle for existence. Life is a continuous series of social festivities. Their gymnasiums they use as baths, where they anoint themselves with costly oils and myrrhs. In the grammateia (such is the name they give the public eating- halls) they practically live, filling themselves there for the better part of the day with rich foods and wine; much that they cannot eat they carry away home. They feast to the prevailing music of strings. The cities are filled from end to end with the noise of harp-playing. Consonant with this picture is the account Posidonius gives of the war between Apamea and Larissaâsome petty war of two neighbor cities which is not otherwise known. He narrates the setting out of the Apamean force. âThey had caught up poignards and javelins which were indistinguishable in rust and dirt. They wore hats with broad brims, exquisitely adjusted so as to shade the neck without keeping off the cool breeze. Behind them trailed a string of asses, laden with wine and all sorts of viands, alongside of which might be seen pipes and flutes, the instruments of revelry, not of war.â\n\nIt is possible, of course, that Posidonius caricatured his countrymen. The fact that he himself was of Apamea shows that the stock could still produce men capable of taking the highest place in the literary and scientific world. But the traces of intellectual activity among the Syrian Greeks are, it must be admitted, scanty. The only way in which we can estimate it is by noting which of the memorable names are coupled with a Syrian origin. And this is an unsure method. For the literary world was cosmopolitan, and a manâs activity might not lie in the place where he was born. There is, howÂ­ever, this to be said, that some degree of culture must be supposed in the early environment of men who left their native place to seek learning or literary fame, something to have stimulated them to such a quest.\n\nLooking, then, at the list of remembered names in. all departments of culture, we find that Antioch, the greatest of the cities, contributes during the Seleucid epoch only a Stoic philosopher, Apollophanes, and a writer on dreams, Phoebus. Cicero describes Antioch as a âcity once much resorted to, and abounding in men of the highest education and in the pursuit of liberal learning.â Seleucia-in-Pieria produced Apollophanes, who was body-physician to Antiochus III, and made some valuable contributions to ancient medicine. The only Syrian city to whose name any literary luster attaches is one which did not pass under Seleucid supremacy till the time of Antiochus III, Gadara. This is leaving out of count the Phoenician cities, to which we shall come presently.\n\nOne question which naturally suggests itself about this Syrian Hellenism is whether the newcomers were influenced to any extent by the people of the land, whether they adopted their traditions and modes of thought. We have very few data to go upon. The matter of language, which is a capital point, must be largely conjectural. The educated classes in the cities of course spoke Greek. But was it usual for them to have any real knowledge of the native language, without which a communication of ideas must have been very scanty? That they picked up common words and phrases, as an Anglo- Indian does of Hindostani, is to be taken for granted, but does not prove much. It is somewhat more significant that the nicknames of some of the later Seleucids (Balas, Siripides, Zabinas) are Aramaic. The Antiochene populace with whom they started was, no doubt, bilingual.\n\nThe only distinct borrowing of native tradition which we can point to is in the cults. The ancients thought it prudent to honor the gods of a land into which they came, even when they came as conquerors. Most, if not all, of the new cities stood where native towns or villages had stood before them, each with its local Baal or Astarte. These cults were, no doubt, in most cases retained, the Greeks, of course, giving to the native deities the names of their own gods.\n\nAt Antioch there was a temple of Artemis Persike, that is, one form of the great Mother-goddess worshipped by the Semites and peoples of Asia Minor.\n\nAt Seleucia-in-Pieria there appears from the coins to have been a temple whose deity was represented by a conical stone, and that it was an old local god is shown by the name of Zeus Casius, which is often attached to the symbol. Zeus Casius was the god of the neighboring mountain, worshipped from time immemorial by the Phoenician coasters. Sometimes the epithet on the coins is not Casius but Keraunios, and this suggests that the thunderbolt, the sacred emblem of the city, may be connected with the old worship, and the Greek story of the foundation of the city have been invented later to explain it.\n\nAt Laodicea-on-the-Sea the coins show an armed goddess, identified by numismatists as Artemis Brauronia, whose image had been carried away from Attica by the Persians in 480, was found by Seleucus at Susa, and presented to his new colony. This does not exclude the possibility that in the native township, Kamitha, or Mazabda, which had preceded Laodicea, a goddess of this type had been worshipped, and that this was the motive which led Seleucus to choose Laodicea as the recipient of the venerable idol; or the whole story of the image may even have been invented in later times by the Laodiceans to give an Oriental cult a respectable Attic parentage.\n\nThe great example of an ancient cult continuing to flourish under Greek rule was in Bambyce-Hieropolis. The deity here was Atargatis, i.e. Astarte (the wife) of Ateh. The temple and ritual are described at length by Lucian in a special work, De Syria Dea. According to the story told him by the priests, the actual building was the work of Stratonice, the queen of Seleucus I and Antiochus I. The story told about her is cerÂ­tainly fabulous, and it is therefore possible that an old legend may have become accidentally attached to her name from its resemblance in sound to that of Astarte. A prominent feature of the religion of Atargatis was the sanctity of fish. There was a pond with the sacred fish beside the temple, some of them with pieces of gold attached to their fins. On certain holy days the images of the gods were carried down to the pond. The priests were, of course, native Syrians, and there was a great body of consecrated eunuchs.\n\nA goddess of the same type as the Ephesian Artemis, certainly a form of the Mother-goddess, is seen on coins of one of the late Seleucids; she was, no doubt, worshipped in the place where these coins were minted. On other coins of the same epoch is a bearded deity in a conical cap, holding an ear of corn in his hand. The Baal of Doliche in Cyrrhestice did not only continue to be worshipped by the Greeks, but his cult, as that of Zeus Dolichenus, was spread into foreign lands, and became one of that farrago of Oriental superstitions, cults of Sarapis, of Isis and Mithra which were so much in vogue throughout the Eoman Empire in the latter time of paganism. The same thing happened in the case of another Syrian god, Baal Markod, the âlord of dancing.â At the village of Baetocaece there was a miraculous shrine of the local god (Zeus Baetocaeceus), which obtained from a King Antiochus a grant of land and a sanction of its inviolability, as his letter (of which a copy made in Roman times was found on the spot) declares at large.\n\nIt is difficult to trace the action of their new environment upon the Greeks and Macedonians of Syria; it is no easier to follow the workings of the old Aramaean civilization and life under the strange forces which now came to bear upon them. The country-side retained its old speech, this much we know. In the cities the populace was largely, and perhaps mainly, Aramaean. Even as an official language Aramaic did not quite die out, as is shown by its use later on in Palmyra and among the Nabataeans. There were still circles, in such places preÂ­sumably as Edessa, in which Aramaic literature continued to be cultivated. The oldest works in Syriac which have come down to us (Christian) show the language in a fixed and developed form. They were not first essays in a new medium.\n\nBut although Aramaic speech and literature survived, they were discredited among the upper classes. They shrank with a sense of inferiority from contact with the Muses of Greece. Greek throughout Seleucid Syria was the proper language of official documents, of literature and of monuments. The Syrian youth, who aspired to be counted wise, found the wisdom of his fathers no longer of any savour, when he might put on the Hellenic dress and talk Zeno or Epicurus in the porticoes of the new cities. Meleager of Gadara seems to have been of native Syrian origin. Even where the old language of the land was used, the thought was, no doubt, largely Greek, as is the case with the dialogue On Fateâone of the oldest Syriac works we possess, written early in the third century A.D. by a disciple of the heretic Bardesanes, and continuing possibly a pre-Christian tradition. It is not really surprising that that literature should have perished. Driven into the background by Greek literature as barbarian during the pagan period, it was annihilated in the Christian period as pagan.\n\nWe have hitherto left aside that Semitic people of whom we know more than the Aramaeans, the Phoenicians of the coast. Greeks and Phoenicians had known each other since the prehistoric centuries. The Phoenicians, like the coast-peoples of Asia Minor, had already undergone some degree of Hellenic influence before Alexander. They had also before Alexander had a long experience of foreign rule.\n\nBut under their various foreign masters, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, the Phoenicians had maintained from time immemorial their nationality and local independence. The cities had their own constitutions or kings. In opposition to Alexander, to the advent of a power far more penetrating and transforming than that of the earlier monarchies, history sees the national spirit of the Phoenicians blaze up for the last time in its original seat. In Africa, indeed, it was still to meet Rome for life or death. But the siege of Tyre, which delayed Alexander for some eight months in 332, was the last of those sieges of Phoenician cities of which history remembered so many, the last in which the defenders were the natives themselves, animated by a national or civic spirit against a foreign king. Sidon had been crippled twenty years before by the fearful vengeance taken by Artaxerxes Ochus for its revolt; Tyre was crushed finally by Alexander. With some few exceptions, all its inhabitants who could not escape were killed or sold for slaves. Some of the old population may have drifted back, strangers came in to fill the gaps, Tyre became again a great commercial town, but the old spirit never returned, the ancient tradition was broken for ever.\n\nIn the new population the Hellenic element was probably considerable. At any rate the old Phoenician cities now undergo the same sort of transformation into Hellenic cities as we have seen in the case of the Aramaean cities. The Phoenician tradition would seem, however, to have been less completely suppressed by the new culture. Not only are Phoenician inscriptions put up by private citizens under the Macedonian rule, but the coins of Tyre, Sidon, Aradus, Laodicea-Berytus and Marathus bear Phoenician legends alongside of Greek legends and the heads of the Macedonian rulers. As late as the Christian era there were many people in Tyre who did not even understand Greek. At the same time, the Hellenism which took root here became in time more vigorous and productive than that in the Aramaean domain. Several of the prominent philosophers of the last centuries B.C. are described as being of Tyre or of Sidon. In the closing century before Christ, the development of the Greek epigram, âwhen it had come to a standstill in Alexandria, reached its completeness on the Phoenician coast, on a soil, that is, properly Semitic but saturated with Greek culture and civilization.â\n\nThere is another region which we have to consider in connection with Syria.\n\nWe have seen that Cilicia went, according to ancient geography, rather with Syria than Asia Minor. The Seleucid kings who wished to reign in both naturally looked upon Cilicia as theirs. As a matter of fact the Cilician plains were cut off both from Syria and from the rest of Asia Minor by tremendous mountain barriers, communicating with Asia Minor only by the narrow doorway of the âCilician Gates,â with Syria by a pass equally narrow between mountain and sea, the âSyrian Gates,â or by the difficult roads over the Amanus. Cilicia, whose native population was probably akin to the Aramaeans of Syria, had a history which went back like that of Syria into the days of Assyrian supremacy, and had, like Syria, its cities of old fame, Soli, Mallus and Tarsus, the seat under the Achaemenians of those semi-independent native princes who bore the name of Syennesis. But the Hellenic influence had come to work earlier in this region; the old cities had already become more than half Hellenized by the time that Alexander arrived, and thought it decent to appear as Greek colonies. Actual Greek colonists may indeed have come to settle in them. Soli claimed Argos and Rhodes as its mother-cities. Tarsus called sometimes the Greek hero Triptolemus, sometimes the Assyrian king Sardanapallus its founder. Mallus had been founded in the dim days of Greek legend by Mopsus and Amphilochus. Mopsus, indeed, as a wandering hero figured largely in the myths of the Greek colonies along the south coast of Asia Minor, and the most important town of the interior of Cilicia after Tarsus bore in Greek the name of Mopsuestia, the Hearth of Mopsus.\n\nThe Hellenism of the cities of Cilicia vindicated itself in the third century by its fruits. Just as at the very beginning of Greek philosophy, in the case of Thales, there had been matter supplied to Hellenic thought by the Phoenician tradition, so now it was on this ground, where Hellenic cities had grown up among a Semitic people, that the great philosophic school of later Hellenism, the Stoic, took its rise. The founder, Zeno, was a native of Citium in Cyprus, the Phoenician Chittim; but his follower, Chrysippus, who developed and systematized the doctrine, the âsecond fatherâ of the school, was a Cilician Greek, of Soli, born just about the time that Seleucus Nicator wrested Asia Minor from Lysimachus. Tarsus became a principal seat of the Stoic school. Zeno, the successor of Chrysippus, was of Tarsus, so was Antipater, head of the school somewhat later; the fellow-pupil of Antipater, Archedemus; the disciple of Antipater, Heraclides, and Nestor. Among the Stoics of a still later generation we hear of the Cilicians, Crates of Mallus, and his disciple, Zenodotus of Mallus, and several of those philosophers who were associated as friends and teachers with the leading men of Rome in the last age of the Republic were natives of this region. Some of the Cilician philosophers inclined to other schools than the Stoic. One of the greatest names among the leaders of the Academy in Athens was that of Crantor of Soli, and we hear of a Diogenes of Tarsus as an Epicurean. Tarsus by the last century B.C. had become one of the great âuniversitiesâ of the Greco-Roman world. âSuch an enthusiasm for philosophy and all the other parts of a liberal education has been developed in the people of this city,â says Strabo, âthat they have surpassed Athens and Alexandria and all other places one might mention as seats of learning and philosophical study. Here all the students are natives, and strangers do not readily come to reside. They have schools for all branches of literary culture.â It is not only in philosophy that Cilicia produced great names. Soli, whose Hellenic character was of an older standing than Tarsus, produced men of letters in the first century of Macedonian rule who attained world-wide fame, Castorion of Soli was even commissioned at Athens (309-308) to compose hymns for public festivals. A still greater name is that of Aratus, the author of the astronomical poem which we still possess, the model for numerous imitaÂ­tions by later writers, Greek and Roman. The tragic poet Dionysiades of Mallus or Tarsus is by some reckoned among the âPleiadâ of Seven which shone at the court of the second Ptolemy. Apollodorus of Tarsus was known as a comÂ­mentator on Euripides and Aristophanes.\n\nAs to the working of native Cilician influence upon Cilician Hellenism, we have the same indications as in Syria of the continuance of the old cults. On coins of Mallus, struck under the Seleucids and Romans, appears the goddess of the neighboring Megarsus, the usual Semitic Mother-goddess, whom the Greeks here called Athene. So, too, on the coins of Tarsus a common type is a curious pyramidal monument or shrine with a barbarian male-deity depicted upon it, whom Babelon conjectures to be Zeus Dolichenus.\n\nOf the events which took place in Syria and the adjoining provinces under Seleucus and his earlier successors we know almost nothing. These regions had, of course, formed part of the realm of Antigonus till the battle of Ipsus. After that Syria passed to Seleucus, but Cilicia was at first handed over to Plistarchus, the brother of Cassander, and the garrison set by Antigonus In Tyre and Sidon held firm for Demetrius when the news of Ipsus reached them. As we saw, Demetrius expelled Plistarchus from Cilicia and occupied the country in 299, at the time when Seleucus and Demetrius were friends.\n\nBut it was exactly because Seleucus wished himself to be master both in Cilicia and on the Phoenician coast that the rupture between them occurred. Demetrius refused on any terms to part either with Cilicia or the Phoenician cities. Then in the following years, whilst Demetrius was busy in Greece and Macedonia, Seleucus succeeded in making Cilicia his. At the same time Demetrius lost Tyre and Sidon. Into whose hands did they fall? They lay close both to Northern Syria, which belonged to Seleucus, and to Palestine, which had been occupied by Ptolemy. We have not yet any conclusive evidence to show which of the rival houses at this juncture obtained possession of them.\n\nThe score of years, however, during which Seleucus Nicator ruled Syria, if they have furnished no matter to the historians, were far from unimportant. A great work of organization, of Hellenization, as to which the historians are silent, must have been carried through. The four great cities of Seleucid Syria, Antioch, Seleucia-in-Pieria, Apamea, and Laodicea, as well as a large number of the lesser Greek communities, were founded and started in life. The division of the country into districts, such as Seleucis, Cyrrhestice, and Commagene, and of Seleucis again into the four satrapies corresponding to the four great cities, presumably goes back to the reign of Seleucus. Thenceforth these Greek comÂ­munities were the active and determining element in the population.\n\nAs soon as the death of Seleucus became known, a faction hostile to his house raised its head in the Syrian cities. Antiochus I found the Syrian Macedonians and Greeks largely in arms against him. âIn the beginning of the reign of King Antiochus,â says the Sigean Inscription, âat the instant of his accession he adopted an honorable and glorious policy, and whereas the cities in Seleucis were troubled in those days by those who had made insurrection, he sought to restore them to peace and their original well-being, to do vengeance on the rebellious, as justice would, and to recover his fatherâs kingdom. So, cherishing an honorable and just purpose, and not only finding the army and the court zealous to carry his cause to victory, but having the favor and assistance of heaven, he brought back the cities to a state of peace and the kingdom to its original well-beingâ Through these high-sounding official phrases we must see all that can be seen of the truth.\n\nFrom this moment till Seleucus II is driven out of Asia Minor by the battle of Ancyra, the history of Syria is a blank, except in so far as it is involved in the long wars between Seleucid and Ptolemy. War indeed seems to have been opened by a battle, in which the Seleucid army was commanded by King Antiochus I in person, somewhere in Syriaâalthough, if Antiochus was the aggressor, most probably in the Ptolemaic province south of the Lebanon. At least, a Babylonian inscription says that in the year 274-273 B.C. King Antiochus, who had come east of the Euphrates, returned to the âland beyond the Riverâ against the army of Egypt. Ptolemyâs strength lay on the sea, and perhaps the interior of Syria was less involved in the war, even on the frontier, than the coasts. The only recorded incident of which inland Syria is the scene is the capture of Damascus. Damascus was held by a Ptolemaic garrison under Dion; King Antiochus (the First, no doubt) was with an army at some daysâ distance. Antiochus knew that Dion was receiving intelligence of his movements, and accordingly caused his army to celebrate a Persian festival and in appearance give themselves up to jollity. This deceived Dion and threw him off his guard. Antiochus crept round upon Damascus by mountain and desert solitudes, fell upon it unawares, and took the city. In 242 Damascus is in Seleucid possession. Whether the Seleucid kings kept their hold on this important place all the time from its capture by Antiochus till that date, or whether it changed hands with the varying fortunes of the war we do not know.\n\nIt is in the provinces open to the sea that the struggle was probably fiercest. The possession of Cilicia and the Phoenician coast, with their wealth in timber, was especially important to a power like the Egyptian.\n\nCilicia seems to have changed hands at least three times. If the poem of Theocritus is any evidence, the second Ptolemy before 271 had ousted the Seleucid. He gives the signal to the warriors of Cilicia. Then Antiochus II seems to have recovered it, since it is not among the countries inherited by Ptolemy III in the Inscription of Adule. Then again it is conquered by Ptolemy III in the campaign for which we have the Ptolemaic officerâs dispatch. And in Ptolemaic possession it still was on the accession of Antiochus III.\n\nFrom the Gurob papyrus we get a fragmentary view of the organization of Cilicia as a Seleucid province in 246. It is, as we saw, under the strategos Aribazus, divided into smaller districts with hyparchs of their own, whom the Ptolemaic captain describes likewise as strategoi; that is, the same general form of government appears as we find in the rest of the Empire. The town of Seleucia is, for the moment at any rate, the headquarters of the administration. Soli is seen to take a line of its own, shifting its allegiance to the house of Ptolemy at discretion.\n\nFrom the outbreak of the war, during the time of the two first Antiochi, Tyre and Sidon are under Ptolemaic influence. Tyre strikes coins of Ptolemy with an era dating from 275-274, that is, from about the time when hostilities were opened in Syria. Sidon also strikes coins of Ptolemy II with dates which run from 261 to 247. A certain Philocles, son of Apollodorus, who commands Ptolemaic forces in the Aegean, is described as âking of the Sidonians.â Phoenicia is mentioned on the monument of Adule as one of the countries inherited by Ptolemy III from his father. The more northern Phoenician cities, on the other hand, were probably Seleucid from the battle of Ipsus. Some of the coins of Antiochus I bear the monogram of Aradus. The year 259-258 is the starting-point of a new era for Aradus, and this is generally thought to show the concession of complete autonomy to the city by Antiochus II. In the âLaodicean Warâ an attempt was made by Ptolemy to capture these northern Phoenician cities, but unsuccessfully. Orthosia, which was beleaguered by his forces, was relieved by Seleucus Kallinikos in 242-241. Later on Aradus secured fresh privileges by declaring for Seleucus against Antiochus Hierax. In recompense for this, the obligation to deliver up fugitives from the Seleucid realm was remitted, and such right of sanctuary, in times when political fugitives of wealth and influence were numerous, proved extremely profitable to the city.\n\nWe have already in a former chapter dealt with the occurrences on the coast of Cilicia and Syria in the opening stage of the Laodicean War.\n\nThe expulsion of Seleucus Kallinikos from the country north of the Taurus shifted the center of gravity in the Empire. The disreputable court of Antiochus Hierax at Sardis could not claim equality with the court of the elder brother, which was now fixed in the Syrian Antioch. By this change Antioch rose at once in dignity. And the change made itself apparent in the outward aspect of the city. Seleucus Kallinikos added a new quarter.\n\nOf the events which took place in Syria in these days we know only the incident of Stratonice and her rebellion, Stratonice was that aunt of Seleucus who had been married to Demetrius, son of the King of Macedonia. In 239 Demetrius succeeded to the throne and was moved to contract a new marriage with an Epirot princess. To Stratonice the idea of remaining at the Macedonian court under the new rÃ©gime was not unnaturally repugnant. She departed, studying revenge, for the court of her nephew. Her scheme was that he should marry her and declare war on her late husband. When, however, she proposed it to Seleucus he displayed a mortifying unwillingness to marry his aunt. For this attitude on his part Stratonice had been wholly unprepared. But her spirit was not broken. She waited her time. The Antiochenes came to know the figure of an unfortunate princess who moved amongst them as an injured and angry woman. Her opportunity came about 235, when the King was absent on an expedition into Iran. She then summoned the city to revolt, and so well had she played her game that the city responded and took up arms on her behalf against Seleucus. When the King returned from the East he was reduced to the necessity of recapturing his capital. Stratonice was unable to offer a prolonged defense. When she saw that the city must fall she fled to Seleucia. Thence she might have escaped, but was induced by an adverse dream to put off sailing. As a result of this delay she was caught by the people of Seleucus and put to death. The story certainly proves that the restiveness which the Syrian Greeks had shown at the accession of Antiochus I was not extinct under Seleucus Kallinikos."
