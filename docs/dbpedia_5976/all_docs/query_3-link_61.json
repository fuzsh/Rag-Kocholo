        "text": "I review this fine collection of articles on ancient ethics ranging from the Presocratics to Sextus Empiricus. Eight of the nine chapters are published here for the first time. Contributors include Charles H. Kahn on “Pre-Platonic Ethics,” C. C. W. Taylor on “Platonic Ethics,” Stephen Everson on “Aristotle on Nature and Value,” John McDowell on “Some Issues in Aristotle’s Moral Psychology,” David Sedley on “The Inferential Foundations of Epicurean Ethics,” T. H. Irwin on “Socratic Paradox and Stoic Theory,” Julia Annas on “Doing Without Objective Values: Ancient and Modern Strategies,” and Susan Sauvé Meyer on “Moral Responsibility: Aristotle and After.” There is also an introductory essay by the editor, Stephen Everson. I summarize and then critique each chapter in this rather lengthy review."
