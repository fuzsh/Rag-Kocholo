This document discusses the Greek tradition of ethnography from its origins to the time of Posidonius. It examines how ethnography developed as a genre alongside history, typically describing a people's land, culture, and customs. Key figures who influenced the tradition included Herodotus, Hippocrates, and philosophers in the 4th century BC who brought interests in politics and theories of degeneration. The document aims to reconstruct the Celtic ethnography of Posidonius by analyzing how later writers who quoted or were influenced by him portrayed Celtic peoples.",
