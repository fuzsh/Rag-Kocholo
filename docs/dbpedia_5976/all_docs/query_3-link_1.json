        "text": "Poseidonius (born c. 135 bce—died c. 51 bce) was a Greek philosopher, considered the most-learned man of his time and, possibly, of the entire Stoic school.\n\nPoseidonius, nicknamed “the Athlete,” was a native of Apamea in Syria and a pupil of the Greek Stoic philosopher Panaetius. He spent many years in travel and scientific research in Spain, Africa, Italy, Gaul (modern France), Liguria, and Sicily. When he settled as a teacher at Rhodes, his adopted Greek city, his fame attracted numerous scholars. By his writings and his personal relations, he did more to spread Stoicism in the Roman world than anyone else except Panaetius. He was known to many leading men of his time, including the Roman statesman Cicero, who studied under him in 78–77 and whom he mentioned as a friend. Such other Roman writers as Strabo and Seneca provide the major source of knowledge about his life; until the 20th century, scholars accorded him only a minor place in the development of Stoicism.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhilosophy 101"
