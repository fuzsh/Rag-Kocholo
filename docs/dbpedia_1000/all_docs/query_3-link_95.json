        "text": "Not the same as Thomas Lane of Surry\n\nThomas Lane from Long Bennington appears to have also married an Elizabeth (maiden name unknown) and this Thomas probably died in Long Bennington. His wife Elizabeth appears to have died in 1666 and he appears to have remarried to Mary Pacy.\n\nHe had three sons with his wife Elizabeth: Thomas born 1660, John born 1662 and died 1662, and William born 1663. All three were born in Long Bennington.\n\nHe also had some children with Mary Pacy.\n\nHere is the record of the burial of Thomas's wife Elizabeth (maiden name unknown) in Long Bennington.\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:J8RF-7M3\n\nHere is the record for his remarriage to Mary Pacy:\n\nhttps://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NF4Y-MQH\n\nHe was still living in Long Bennington by 1675 when him and Mary's last child Robert was born. This seems to show that Thomas Lane from VA and Thomas Lane from Long Bennington, Lincolnshire, England were two different people.\n\nBiography\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lane-7160\n\nThomas Lane was probably born in Oct 1630 in Long Bennington, Lincolnshire, England. He was baptized in Oct 1630 in Long Bennington, Lincolnshire, son of Thomas Lane. The exact baptism date is hard to read but is between 23 Oct and Oct 31 based on the adjacent records.[1]\n\nPossible siblings based on baptism records in the same location, with father Thomas include:\n\nMary Lane, baptized 25 Oct 1630, daughter of Thomas, according to Ancestry.[2] However, note that this transcribed record does not appear in the original Long Bennington baptism records available at Lincolnshire records here. Is this a mis-transcription of Thomas Lane?)\n\nJohn Lane, baptized 19 Jul 1632, son of Thomas.[3]\n\nElizabeth Lane, baptized 27 Oct 1633, daughter of Thomas and Mary.[4] Notes\n\nThomas Lane is assumed in some family trees to have emigrated to Virginia, where he married Elizabeth Jones/Sheppard. However that Thomas Lane of Virginia was born 1634/35, and there is no evidence he was born in England nor in particular that he was born in Lincolnshire.\n\nOther Thomas Lane's baptized in Long Bennington around this time according to Ancestry records are:\n\nThomas Laine, baptized 3 Apr 1619, son of Edward.[5]\n\nThomas Lane, baptized 13 Oct 1660, son of Thomas and Elizabeth.[6]\n\nSources"
