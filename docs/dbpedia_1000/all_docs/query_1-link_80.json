        "text": "A former Minneapolis police officer has pleaded guilty to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in the killing of George Floyd.\n\nThomas Lane on Wednesday admitted that he intentionally helped restrain Mr Floyd in a way that created an unreasonable risk and caused his death.\n\nAs part of this plea agreement, a more serious count of aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder will be dismissed.\n\nMr Lane and former Officers J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao have already been convicted on federal counts of wilfully violating the rights of Mr Floyd, who was black.\n\nWhile they have yet to be sentenced on the federal charges, Mr Lane's change of plea means he will avoid what could have been a lengthy state sentence if he was convicted of the murder charge.\n\nThe guilty plea comes a week before the two-year anniversary of Mr Floyd's May 25, 2020, killing.\n\nMr Floyd, 46, died after Derek Chauvin, who is white, pinned him to the ground with a knee on his neck, with Mr Floyd repeatedly saying he couldn't breathe.\n\nThe killing, captured on widely viewed bystander video, sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the globe as part of a reckoning over racial injustice.\n\nMr Lane, who is white, and Mr Kueng, who is black, helped restrain Mr Floyd, who was handcuffed. Mr Lane held down Mr Floyd's legs and Mr Kueng knelt on Mr Floyd's back. Mr Thao, who is Hmong American, kept bystanders from intervening during the 9-minute restraint.\n\nAll three are free on bond; the state trial scheduled for June is expected to proceed for Mr Kueng and Mr Thao.\n\nMr Lane is scheduled to be sentenced on the state charge on September 21.\n\nLoading...\n\nOfficer heard Mr Floyd say he couldn't breathe\n\nIn his plea agreement, Mr Lane admitted that he knew from his training that restraining Mr Floyd in that way created a serious risk of death, and that he heard Mr Floyd say he couldn't breathe, knew Mr Floyd fell silent, had no pulse and appeared to have lost consciousness.\n\nThe plea agreement says Mr Lane knew Mr Floyd should have been rolled onto his side — and evidence shows he asked twice if that should be done — but he continued to assist in the restraint despite the risk.\n\nMr Lane agreed the restraint was \"unreasonable under the circumstances and constituted an unlawful use of force.\"\n\nThe state and Mr Lane's lawyers agreed to a recommended sentence of three years — which is below state sentencing guidelines — and prosecutors agreed to allow him to serve that penalty at the same time as any federal sentence, and in a federal prison.\n\nOne legal expert said this would appeal to Mr Lane because he would have less chance of being incarcerated with people he had arrested.\n\nMr Lane told Judge Peter Cahill that he understood the agreement. When asked how he would plead, he said: \"Guilty, your honour.\"\n\nAttorney-general Keith Ellison, whose office prosecuted the case, issued a statement saying he was pleased that Mr Lane accepted responsibility.\n\n\"While accountability is not justice, this is a significant moment in this case and a necessary resolution on our continued journey to justice.\"\n\nMr Lane's lawyer, Earl Gray, said in a statement that Mr Lane did not want to risk a lengthy prison sentence if convicted of aiding and abetting murder, so he agreed to plead guilty to aiding and abetting manslaughter.\n\n\"He has a newborn baby and did not want to risk not being part of the child's life,\" Mr Gray said.\n\nWednesday's hearing was streamed over Zoom for Mr Floyd's family members. Their lawyers issued a statement afterward, saying Mr Lane's plea \"reflects a certain level of accountability,\" but that it came only after his federal conviction.\n\n\"Hopefully, this plea helps usher in a new era where officers understand that juries will hold them accountable, just as they would any other citizen,\" family lawyers Ben Crump, Jeff Storms and Antonio Romanucci said.\n\n\"Perhaps soon, officers will not require families to endure the pain of lengthy court proceedings where their criminal acts are obvious and apparent.\"\n\nPlea deal comes in wake of killing of 10 black people at supermarket\n\nMr Chauvin pleaded guilty last year to a federal charge of violating Mr Floyd's civil rights and faces a federal sentence ranging from 20 to 25 years. The former officer earlier was convicted of state charges of murder and manslaughter and is currently serving 22 1/2 years in the state case.\n\nMr Lane's plea comes as the country is focused on the killing of 10 Black people in Buffalo, New York, by an 18-year-old white man, who carried out the racist, live streamed shooting Saturday in a supermarket.\n\nMr Lane, Mr Kueng and Mr Thao were convicted of federal charges in February after a month-long trial that focused on the officers' training and the culture of the police department.\n\nAll three were convicted of depriving Mr Floyd of his right to medical care and Mr Thao and Mr Kueng were also convicted of failing to intervene to stop Mr Chauvin during the killing.\n\nAfter their federal conviction, there was a question as to whether the state trial would proceed. At an April hearing in state court, prosecutors revealed that they had offered plea deals to all three men, but they were rejected.\n\nAt the time, Mr Gray said it was hard for the defence to negotiate when the three still don't know what their federal sentences would be.\n\nRachel Moran, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas, said it's possible Mr Lane received a better offer, though the public doesn't know what happened behind the scenes. As for the other officers, she said Mr Lane's guilty plea has \"got to make them think.\"\n\n\"Particularly when I think most people would conceive of Thomas Lane as the least culpable of the three — and he's the one pleading guilty,\" Ms Moran said.\n\n\"Now if you are one of the other two left standing, it might change your position. … They may have less appealing offers to work with, but it still puts pressure on them.\"\n\n'A very sweet deal'\n\nIt's still not clear what federal sentence Mr Lane and the others could face. Many factors go into determining a federal sentence; One legal expert told the AP earlier this year that a federal penalty could range anywhere from five to 25 years. Federal sentencing dates have not been set.\n\nUnder state sentencing guidelines, a person with no criminal record could face a sentence ranging from just under 3 1/2 years to four years and nine months in prison for second-degree unintentional manslaughter, with the presumptive sentence being four years.\n\nMr Lane's recommended sentence of three years, which still must be approved by the judge, would be five months less than the low range.\n\nIf Mr Lane had been convicted of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, he would have faced a presumptive 12 1/2 years in prison. And prosecutors served notice in 2020 that they intended to seek longer sentences for Mr Lane, Mr Kueng and Mr Thao — as they did for Mr Chauvin.\n\nBaker said a guilty plea makes sense and he would not be surprised if at least one of the other former officers also took a deal.\n\nA lawyer for Mr Thao, Robert Paule, was in the courtroom for Lane's plea hearing. When asked if his client would also plead guilty, he replied \"No comment.\"\n\nMr Kueng's lawyer, Tom Plunkett, also declined to comment.\n\nStorms, one of the Floyd family lawyers, said the deal with Mr Lane happened \"very quickly.\"\n\nWhen asked if he knew of any other possible negotiations with Mr Thao or Mr Kueng, he declined to comment on that, but said: \"I think the family is hopeful, now that a state and federal jury have spoken, that the other officers will voluntarily be held accountable.\""
