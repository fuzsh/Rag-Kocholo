I demonstrate that commitment by my ongoing quest to further educate myself and sharpen my skills in areas that impact my clients’ financial lives. This commitment to my profession, and ultimately my clients, enables my clients to benefit from my objective and practical advice in matters pertaining to their overall financial planning, including tax, investments, debt management, cash flow, insurance, and estate planning. My ability to work closely with my clients’ other advisors ensures a meaningful experience for our clients and gives them the peace of mind in knowing that we are working collectively as a team for their benefit.\n\nI have been married to my wife Gina for 42 incredible years (though she may not agree). Together we have three awesome children, Tom, Julie, and Tim and have been blessed with three beautiful grandsons, Jackson, Gavin and Graham. My family is unquestionably my greatest passion in life.\n\nMy personal interests and hobbies outside of my family include painfully watching Philly sports teams, spending time at the Jersey shore, skiing, kayaking, and cycling. For many years I coached travel soccer and basketball.\n\nPhone: (856) 638-1855\n\nEmail: tom@lanehipple.com"
