        "text": "A former Minneapolis police officer, Thomas Lane, was sentenced to three years in prison on Wednesday for his role in the killing of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nMr. Lane, 39, who pleaded guilty in May to a second-degree manslaughter charge, has been serving a two-and-a-half-year federal sentence for violating Mr. Floyd’s civil rights and will serve the three-year sentence concurrently. As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors dropped a more serious charge of aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder.\n\nJudge Peter A. Cahill, who has overseen the trial of all four officers charged in connection with Mr. Floyd’s death, accepted the plea agreement in Hennepin County District Court on Wednesday.\n\n“I think it was a very wise decision for you to accept responsibility and move on with your life,” Mr. Cahill said, according to The Associated Press.\n\nMr. Lane, who has been in federal prison in Colorado since last month, attended the virtual hearing wearing a gray prison jumpsuit. Given an opportunity to address the court, Mr. Lane declined.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mr. Lane admitted that he knew the risks of handcuffing a person in a prone position from “his experience and training” as a police officer. Mr. Lane “was able to hear Mr. Floyd repeat that he could not breathe numerous times during the restraint,” the agreement says. “The defendant was also aware that Mr. Floyd fell silent as the restraint continued, eventually did not have a pulse, and appeared to have lost consciousness.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
