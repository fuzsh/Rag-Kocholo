        "text": "Jefferson County, NY Pioneers\n\nPIONEER LANE FAMILY\n\n1. THOMAS LANE was born about 1768 in Devonshire, England. He married NANNY \"Anna\" STAMP. The couple emigrated to Hounsfield in May 1834, settling adjacent to the Washburns, Stoodleys, and Eveleighs -- all families that they would later become related to by marriage. Their place of residence appears on the 1855 land ownership map of the town but not on the 1864 map, probably indicating that none of the children occupied the property after Thomas' death in 1861.\n\nIn the 1850 federal census of Hounsfield, Thomas and Nanny were enumerated as the heads of dwelling number 232, family 232. Thomas reported his age as 79 and his occupation as farmer. Nanny was 75 and reported no occupation, possibly an indication that they both worked on the farm. They both reported their birthplaces as England. The value of their real estate at that time was estimated at $2,000.\n\nLiving with them was their daughter Jane Jeffrey, age 44, born in England, and her son, Duane, age 5, born in New York State. Also living in the same household and enumerated with the same family number were William Stokes, age 50, born in England, and his wife Ann, age 46, born in England, the daughter of Thomas and Nanny Lane. The ages of their children indicate that William and Ann did not emigrate until about 1842, a full 8 years after Thomas and Nanny.\n\nTHOMAS wrote his will on 15 January 1856 and it was witnessed by James Marsh and William \"Stodley\", his son-in-law. In the will he specifically mentioned daughters Ann and Jane and he assigned his son Charles to be sole executor of his estate. On 26 May 1862 the will was proved and each child of Thomas was required to give their full name and place of residence, thus providing a valuable resource for establishing this Lane genealogy.\n\nTHOMAS died 11 April 1861 at age 93 in the town of Hounsfield, Jefferson Co., New York, where he had been a farmer.\n\nHe married in or before 1801 in England\n\nNANNY \"Anna\" STAMP who had been born about 1774 in Devonshire, England. She died 25 November 1857 in the town of Hounsfield, Jefferson Co., New York. They are both buried in the Sulpher Springs Cemetery on Sulpher Springs Road, Hounsfield. Their gravestones, in exquisite condition, stand half-way back from the road at the east end of the cemetery.\n\nChildren (all except Thomas taken from the will and estate of Thomas Lane, probated 1862) LANE:\n\n2 i THOMAS LANE married CHARLOTTE WILLIAMS\n\n3 ii CHARLES LANE married FRANCIS HALLYARD\n\n4 iii ELIZABETH LANE married WILLIAM STOODLEY\n\n5 iv SARAH LANE married JOHN EVELEIGH \"of Hounsfield\"\n\n6 v MINERVA LANE \"of Henderson\"\n\n7 vi PETER LANE \"of Clayton\"\n\n8 vii JAMES LANE \"of Montague, Lewis County, New York\"\n\n9 viii ANN LANE married WILLIAM STOKES of \"Adams, Jefferson Co.\"\n\n10 ix JOHN LANE\n\n11 x JANE LANE married ROBERT JEFFREY\n\n2. THOMAS LANE (son of THOMAS & NANNY/Anna (STAMP) LANE) was born 1801 in Dorsetshire(?), England, died 1887 in New York. Though they are not mentioned in Thomas of Hounsfield's will the best available evidence suggests that Thomas Lane, born 1801, may have been a first born son of Thomas and Nanny Lane. This Thomas emigrated about 1835, one year after Thomas and Nanny Lane and in the same year as Charles Lane, Thomas and Nanny's next eldest son. Thomas and Charlotte had a daughter, Sarah, who lived in Montague, Lewis Co., New York, while Thomas and Nanny had a son, James who also resided there. In addition, Thomas and Charlotte's descendants bear the names Charles, Ann, Sarah, Thomas, Amos, Henry and Peter, all names found among the other descendants of Thomas Lane and Nanny Stamp. Thomas Lane and Charlotte Williams were farmers.\n\nHe married in 1825\n\nCHARLOTTE WILLIAMS died in 1876.\n\n12 i ANN LANE married WILLIAM CRANNAGE\n\n13 ii WILLIAM LANE married SARAH A. STOODLEY, daughter of WILLIAM & ELIZABETH (LANE) STOODLEY\n\n14 iii GEORGE LANE married CLORINDA/CLARINDA BULLOCK, daughter of HARRY ALEXANDER & PHOEBE (---) BULLOCK\n\n15 iv SARAH LANE married DANIEL DENING\n\n16 v CHARLES LANE\n\n17 vi HARRIET LANE married JOHN MATTHEWS\n\n18 vii HENRY LANE\n\n19 viii MARIA LANE married ALEXANDER MATTHEWS\n\n20 ix MARION LANE d.y.\n\n21 x THOMAS N.

EGGLESTON\n\n3. CHARLES LANE (son of THOMAS & NANNY/Anna (STAMP) LANE) was born in Devonshire, England;\n\nHe married before emigrating about 1835\n\nFRANCIS HALLYARD, who died April 1878.\n\nChildren, (taken from Child's History of Jefferson Co.) LANE:\n\n24 i ANNA LANE\n\n25 ii ALBERT LANE\n\n26 iii CHARLES E. LANE married CLARA E. HOLBROOK, daughter of WILLIAM M. & HELEN (WATKINS) HOLBROOK\n\n27 iv HENRY J. LANE married ROSALTHA S. PAYNE, daughter of WORDEN & RHODA (WARREN) PAYNE.\n\n9. ANN LANE (daughter of THOMAS & NANNY/Anna (STAMP) LANE) was born about 1804 in England. As noted from the birthplaces of their children, they emigrated from England in or after 1842. She died 12 March 1871 \"age 68 years\", and is buried in Sulpher Springs Cemetery, town of Hounsfield, Jefferson Co., New York.\n\nShe married\n\nWILLIAM STOKES of \"Adams, Jefferson Co.\" who died 28 March 1871 \"age 71 years\", also buried in Sulpher Springs Cemetery with the inscription \"Gone but not forgotten.\"\n\nChildren, STOKES:\n\n28 i WILLIAM STOKES\n\n29 ii ROBERT J. STOKES married JANE A. (---)\n\n30 iii ANN STOKES\n\n31 iv GEORGE STOKES\n\n11. JANE LANE (daughter of THOMAS & NANNY/Anna (STAMP) LANE) was born about 1806 in England. She married Robert Jeffrey and they settled in Sackets Harbor. She received a legacy in her father's will of 1856, but she was noted as \"a deceased daughter of said Thomas Lane\" when the will was proved in 1861 when she would have been age 55. Her husband was not mentioned in the will and since he does not appear in 1850 and 1860 census records, and since their youngest son, Duane, had a court appointed guardian, it can be assumed Robert died or left the area soon after Duane's birth about 1845.\n\nShe married\n\nROBERT JEFFREY whose ancestry is unclear.\n\n32 i SYLVANIA JEFFREY\n\n33 ii ELIZABETH JEFFREY married SETH LARKINS of Henderson. She is mentioned in Thomas Lane's will and is probably Robert and Jane's daughter, since Thomas & Nanny already had a daughter named Elizabeth. Though surely a close relative, further research is needed to determine their connection.\n\n34 iii MATILDA JEFFREY married JOHN READER\n\n35 iv MANUEL JEFFREY\n\n36 v THOMAS JEFFREY\n\n37 vi JOHN JEFFREY\n\n38 vii DUANE JEFFREY\n\n13. WILLIAM LANE (son of THOMAS & CHARLOTTE (WILLIAMS) LANE) was born 25 September 1828 in England. This Thomas emigrated about 1835 and may have been a first born son of Thomas Lane and Nanny Stamp of Hounsfield who emigrated in 1834.\n\nHe married in 1858\n\nSARAH A. STOODLEY, who was his first cousin, the daughter of WILLIAM & ELIZABETH (LANE) STOODLEY\n\nChild, LANE:\n\n39 i CHARLES A. LANE\n\n21. THOMAS N.

He was the son of George Reader, born near Bridport (sic), Dorsetshire, England, who located at Sackets Harbor in 1851, where he died in 1871, aged 70 years. John's mother was Mary Huxford, of Uplyme, Devon, England. John H. Reader had two brothers, John and George (twins), who were born in Lyme-Regis, Eng., in 1832.
