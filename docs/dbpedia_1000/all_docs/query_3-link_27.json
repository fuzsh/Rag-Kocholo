I visited Cal Poly over Easter break and when I walked on the campus, I knew I wanted to go there. I fell in love with it. The academics are great and I really liked things like the outdoor duals they have there. Plus, it's 75 degrees every day and 10 minutes from the beach with beautiful scenery.\""
