        "text": "Sir (Captain) Thomas Lane, of Bentley Esquire is the son of Captain Richard Percy Lane, born 1610 Blithfield, East Staffordshire District, Stafforddshire, England, died by drowning August 7, 1657 Surrey, Virginia, Colonial British America, alternate death, 1657, Eleuthera, Bahama Islands, and his wife, Alice Lane (born Burwell), born 1612 London, Middlesex, England, married Captain Richard Percy Lane January 11, 1661, CT, died Septembr 4, 1678, Surry, Virginia, British Colonial America.\n\nNot the same as Thomas Lane, of Long Bennington\n\nDisambiguation\n\nPlease see the wikitree below:\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lane-7160\n\nThomas Lane is assumed in some family trees to have emigrated to Virginia, where he married Elizabeth Jones/Sheppard. However that Thomas Lane of Virginia was born 1634/35, and there is no evidence he was born in England nor in particular that he was born in Lincolnshire.\n\nFrom Thomas LANE of Jamestown, VA.\n\nFIRST GENERATION\n\n1. Thomas LANE Sr. was born about 1634 in , (VA/England). He died on 3 Jan 1709 in , Surry Co., Va and was buried about 1709 in , Surry Co., Va., Will proved.\n\nHe was married to Elizabeth (unknown) JONES (she was previously married to a Mr. JONES, they had a daughter named Elizabeth JONES) about 1661 in , VA.\n\nThomas LANE Sr. and Elizabeth had the following children:\n\nThomas JR. LANE.\n\nJoseph Sr. LANE.\n\nnotes\n\nIn a Land Deed signed by his son Joseph LANE Sr, it states that:\n\n\"Deed from Joseph Lane and Julian his wife of Isle of Wight County, Sept. 4, 1710, to Thomas Lane, of Surrey County 200 acres given me by my father (Thomas Lane, patent 1682) in his last will and testament (father Thomas Lane, patent 1682). Signed, Joseph Lane (Ielian) Julian Lane\n\n\"Sealed in red wax. Wit: Thomas Hart, Mary Hart, Thomas Lane Jr. The witnesses Thomas and Mary Hart were the son in-law and daughter of Richard & Eliz. Washington- his will Nov. 9, 1724, Surrey Co.\" (Ref. Surrey County Deed Book 5, page 37) This can be found on Microfilm at the Family History Center called\" General History of the LANES of NC and GA.\"\n\nDisputed Origins\n\nThere is some refrences that state Thomas LANE SR. was the son of John LANE who married the daughter of Robert BIRD, John had sons Robert, Thomas and John, however more research needs to be done.\n\nhttps://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lane-222\n\nAccording to his own declarations Thomas Lane was born ca 1634 (between 3 Jan 1633 and 1 Feb 1635). His date of birth was determined from two conflicting depositions in Surry, Virginia:\n\nThomas Lane on 3 Jan 1670 made a deposition in which he gave his age as 36. This yields a date range of 4 Jan 1633 (if he was just shy of his 37th birthday) to 3 Jan 1634 (if he had just turned 36). [1]\n\nThomas Lane on 1 Feb 1674 made a deposition in which he gave his age as 39. This yields a date range of 2 Feb 1634 (if he was just shy of his 40th birthday) to 1 Feb 1635 (if he had just turned 39). [2]\n\nThese depositions did not indicate where he was born.\n\nThomas Lane has been suggested to be the son of Richard Lane[8], but there is no evidence to support that ancestry.\n\nRichard Lane Lane (1610-1686 and wife last name Burwell. Richard's parents are Thomas Lane b. 1594, Bentley, England who married Alice Bagot. The documented proof are wills of Richard Lane, Thomas Lane and Land Abstracts and Deed Records, I would like his parents to be added to his tree, as they are my family.\n\nA Thomas Lane is listed as living in Virginia in Elizabeth City 16 Feb 1623 https://archive.org/details/originallistsofp00hottuoft/page/194/mod... page 183\n\nIt has been proposed that this Thomas Lane was born in England. From ship lists, the most plausible would be Thomas Lane who was brought from England to the colony in 1653 by William Debnam.(9) It has also been proposed that he was born in Virginia, and was the son of parents that immigrated from England. Thomas Lane, age 30, who came to Virginia in The Treasurer in 1613; and Alice Lane, age 24, who came to Virginia in the Bona Nova in 1620 have been proposed as his parents.[3] However these are hypotheses and are therefore not included in this profile.\n\nSome trees have him as the son of Richard Lane, of Lawnes Creek & Alice Lane without supporting evidence."
