Whilst known for his pragmatic, efficient and client centred approach, Thomas is equally capable of exercising his legal acumen to achieve superior legal outcomes for his clients.\n\nPrior to joining the firm, he held a position at a national firm providing litigation services to various Commonwealth government clients under a panel firm arrangement."
