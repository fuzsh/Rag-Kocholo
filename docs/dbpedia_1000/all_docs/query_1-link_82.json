        "text": "THE LANE FAMILY.\n\nFrom\n\nShravokee\n\nCounty Clare  Ireland\n\nWE ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE CAN TRACE OUR LANE FAMILY BACK TO A TOWNLAND IN COUNTY CLARE WHERE DESCENDANTS OF OUR FAMILY STILL FARM.\n\nWE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER MANY OF THE EARLY LANES WHO EMIGRATED TO VICTORIA IN THE 1800'S AND BY DEATH CERTIFICATES, OBITUARIES AND FAMILY HISTORY ETC. WE CAN TRACK THE FAMILY BACK TO A SMALL TOWNLAND CALLED \"SHRAVOKEE\" IN COUNTY CLARE, IRELAND A FEW km's FROM THE LIMERICK BORDER.\n\nIreland has suffered many catastrophes and severe hardships in its time including the invasion by Oliver Cromwell and its effects as well as a number of severe famines.\n\nOliver Cromwell landed in Ireland from England in 1649 with his New Model Army and savaged the Catholics and Royalists. Under brutal punitive terms of surrender mass confiscation of all Irish Catholic owned land occurred. In addition many thousands of the population were sent to The West Indies or New England in America as indentured servants or slaves.\n\nCromwell's army would have passed what were the Lane farms some 150 years later.\n\nThese confiscated lands in Ireland were in part distributed to some 12000 soldiers and adventurers as they had not been paid for some eighteen months and England was unable to pay their wages.\n\nThis huge turmoil resulted in the Irish Landowners and their tenants being banished or transplanted to the province of Connacht and County Clare. They had to transplant themselves, their families, dependents, livestock and goods before the 1st May, 1654. The penalty for not transplanting was death by hanging.\n\nNo event in Irish history had a more emotional effect on Irish national feeling than the Great Famine of 1845-1849.\n\nThe continual disastrous failure of the potato crop, due to a killer tuber-rotting fungus Phytophthora Infestans , known as the Potato Blight , had by February, 1846 struck every county in Ireland and destroyed three-quarters of the country's crop.\n\nConditions in Ireland up until that time were poor and travellers often commented on the extreme misery of the poorest Irish peasant. He lived off a tiny piece of land for which he paid such a high rent that almost all, and sometimes all, the cereal crops he grew on it had to be sold to pay the rent, with the result that the farmer and his family subsisted on a plot of potatoes which became the staple diet for the people of Ireland.\n\nThis situation had become increasingly precarious during the first four decades of the nineteenth century, which had seen a vast population explosion in Ireland. The population of Ireland in 1800 was estimated at 4.5 million however this had increased to 8 million by 1841.\n\nThe pressure of this vast increase of people on the land became a serious problem as land became subdivided into smaller and smaller plots on which increasingly people subsisted mainly on potatoes.\n\nThe crop failed due to the disease for four successive years.\n\nDeaths from starvation in Ireland during the Famine years 1845-1849 have been estimated at approximately one million people. These were mostly peasant farmers and their families, who starved to death..\n\nIn 1846, the rate of ‘famine’ burials in East Clare from the infamous workhouse at Scariff, not all that far from Shravokee, was so great, that the existing graveyards were filled to capacity.\n\nAt Ennis, also in County Clare, during the Famine period Marcus Keane was a notorious Land Agent who acted with untold brutality on behalf of Landlords and specialised in clearing the land of tenants. The Landlords realised there was more money to be made out of raising cattle for export than in keeping starving tenant farmers, Keane had control of some 60000 acres and levelled as many as 500 homes on behalf of his clients.\n\nFrom 1847 to 1850 more than 14000 people (2700 families) were evicted in the Kilrush Union alone.\n\nEvicted tenants had few options, the prospect of being admitted to the workhouse was tantamount to a slow death, with cholera, malnutrition and family brake up part of the destitute package.\n\nMany chose to brave the elements by making temporary shelters in bog holes, behind stone walls, or in ditches using the remnants of their homes as makeshift shelters.\n\nIn County Galway, it was reported that there were dead bodies everywhere and that every village had bodies lying unburied for many days. The streets were daily thronged with moving skeletons and the fields were strewn with the dead. Food riots were occurring in every County due to the population starving. Typhus was soon raging throughout Ireland resulting in many deaths.\n\nIn the period 1846 to 1847 people died in their hundreds of thousands of starvation and fever - one quarter of the population of Ireland died in those two years.\n\nOne sad fact is that Ireland produced enough corn in those two years to feed the whole country but it was all exported by the English landholders whilst the peasantry were dying of hunger.\n\nThe conditions in the area around Clonlara and Shravokee were no better.\n\nIt was in this context that mass emigration occurred with people leaving from every port in Ireland. In 1847, some 250,000 people left Ireland and the rate was to continue at that level and sometimes higher for the next four years. Many of them travelled to the United States, Canada and also Australia where they were to profoundly influence the societies into which they were absorbed.\n\nThe circumstances of the Lane Family before and during the famine period are not known.\n\nIrish farmers were not permitted to own land and operated as tenant farmers paying rent to landowners which in the main were English who were rewarded with lands by Cromwell.\n\nThe various Lane Families from 1824 appear to have had more than reasonable holdings enabling them to survive.\n\nIn addition they were Tenant Farmers to the Barrington Family who had the Annaghbeg Estate which was a very large farming area.\n\nSir Matthew Barrington, 1788 - 1861 was by all accounts an excellent landlord to his Catholic Tenants, not at all common in Ireland at that time.\n\nDuring the Great Famine, he gave his tenants a reduction in their rents and in many cases did not exact any payments.\n\nTHE CLARE ELECTION OF 1853\n\nThis perhaps resulted in loyalty from his tenant farmers as the Doonass Catholic Parish Registers noted that in 1853 a substantial number of tenants on the Estate voted for Colonel Vandeleur, a noted Tory who was against Home Rule for the Irish, in a controversial election for County Clare..\n\nThese included from Shrankee (Shravokee)\n\nMichael Moloney,\n\nTom Lane,\n\nTommy Lane,\n\nJames Lane,\n\nJames McCormack,\n\nPatt Mulqueeny\n\nas well as John Madden, Michael McCormack and Daniel Madden all from Gurrane who were neighbors..\n\nThis would have been a big decision for these tenant farmers to make as at the time in County Clare the Catholic Clergy were becoming extremely active in local political affairs.\n\nMany Landlords believed they had the right to tell their tenants how to vote.\n\nIn addition many tenant farmers were caught in the middle between the Church and their landlord but in a lot of cases had to vote in accordance with the landlords wishes or face eviction.\n\nSome tenants were of the opinion they must obey their landlord when they have a good landlord, as a mark of respect.\n\nBy making a note in the Church Registry clearly the Parish Priest in this case was not happy.\n\nThe following web site gives a brief history on the Barrington family.\n\nhttp://www.limerickcity.ie/media/barringtons%20and%20their%20tenants.pdf\n\nThe two Thomas Lane(s) were Tenant Farmers with reasonable holdings of 1st and 2nd Grade Land near the River Shannon as shown in the Tithe Applotment Books of 1824.\n\nThese holdings were farmed in a partnership arrangement where families or friends pooled their resources to achieve economy of scale.\n\nThe 1841 census revealed that 88%of farms in County Clare were between one and fifteen acres. It was estimated 80,000 families in Clare held an average of four acres.\n\nIndications were that the critical farm threshold for an income above subsistence level was 20 acres, which was the reason many where possible pooled their resources to form a partnership.\n\nThis period was the lead up to the Great Famine and small farms, large families and the potato as a staple food had a huge affect.\n\nThe 1841 Census reveals the Barony of Tully Lower, which included the area where Shravokee is located, had a total of 5032 houses of which 38% were one room thatched roof houses.\n\nWe know from the obituary of Michael Lane, of Koroit in Victoria in 1912, that his father, Thomas Lane b1818, wanted to settle him on a farm prior to him coming in 1861 to Australia, but he came to Australia instead, leaving us to think the family were in reasonable circumstances.\n\nOne would think that the obituary would be correct as most of Michael Lane's neighbours and friends originated from the same area in County Clare.\n\nThe Lane family came from the Town land of Shravokee near Clonlara, County Clare in the south west of Ireland, a few miles north of Limerick City overlooking the River Shannon.\n\nClonlara was once known as Doonas and many places in the village and surrounds, including the Falls of Doonas on the River Shannon between Limerick and Killaloe, are still called by this name.\n\nDoonas or Dun Ease means the Fort of the Rapids. In 1841, the population of the rural districts was 4016 with 629 houses.\n\nVarious newspaper obituaries of the early Lane families and other families around Koroit, Victoria in Australia confirm they came from Shravokee in the Parish of Doonas in County Clare.\n\nIt must be remembered that the English ruled Ireland in those days and had a number of unusual terminologys relating to the areas of the country and of course, many of the people used the old Catholic Church Terminology.\n\nWe are fortunate in that three gravestones survive in a very small cemetery \"Teampall Mochulla\", which is a matter of a few hundred meters from where the Lane Families farmed give some idea of the Family History.\n\n1. LANE.\n\nThere is a headstone in the Lane Cemetery at Teampail near the 1855 Lane Farms listed in the Griffiths Valuation.\n\nIt reads -:\n\nERECTED BY THOMAS, PATRICK & ANNE LANE\n\nand their COUSIN\n\nTHOMAS LANE\n\nin memory of\n\nJAMES LANE\n\nwho departed this life\n\n10th February 1855\n\naged 45 years\n\nThis headstone links the Lanes who held land in the Griffiths Valuation of 1855 in Shravokee, Garraun & Quinpool North..\n\nThe property which James Lane held, was after probate, passed to his wife Anne Lane (Malone).\n\nThis would be the farm listed as House 8 below in the 1901 Census for Srawickeen (Cappavilla, Clare).\n\nMargaret Lane & Mary Anne Lane who came to Australia and married the Gleeson Brothers were children.\n\nThe Thomas Lane's listed on the Headstone are believed to be Thomas Lane (Mulqueeney) and Thomas Lane (Moloney) who both occupied farms at Srawickeen .These areas were called Shravokee and Mt.O'Donnell at the time of the Tithe in 1824.\n\nThe Patrick Lane listed is probably Pat Lane of Quinpool.\n\nThe Griffiths Valuation shows that Patrick Lane shared 21 acres at Garraun with Michael Madden.\n\nOn December 6th, 1851 Michael Madden of Quinpool married Margaret Malone of Shravokee.\n\nWitnesses were Patt Lane & Anne Lane of Shravokee.\n\nAnn Lane (Malone) and Margaret Malone were both from Shravokee and would have been sisters.\n\nThis headstone also explains the change in ownership of the farm of James Lane to Anne Lane in the two Landed Estate Sales Documents of 1851 and 1856. The reports cover the sale of the Annaghbeg Estate.\n\nThis headstone covers the wife of Patrick Lane 0f Quinpool.\n\n2. LANE.\n\nErected by Patrick Lane in memory of his beloved wife Ellen Lane who died on 10/?/1878 aged 60 years.\n\n3. LANE\n\nThis is a replacement tombstone)\n\nIn loving memory of Michael Lane b1788, His wife Catherine.\n\nThomas Lane died 25 Aug. 1891, aged 73 yrs. His wife Elizabeth died 29 Nov. 1895, aged 75 yrs.\n\nThomas Lane died 23 Oct., 1895, aged 56 yrs. His wife Mary died Feb. 1923, aged 80 yrs.\n\nRev. James Lane (brother of Thomas), died 24 Jan. 1877, aged 31 yrs in USA.\n\nJohn Lane died 27 Feb. 1934, aged 54 yrs. His wife Ellen died 12 Dec. 1978 aged 90 yrs.\n\nJohn Lane died 22 May, 1982, aged 55 yrs.\n\nThis headstone relates to our Michael Lane b1788 and his wife Catherine.\n\nIt was erected by Father Tom Lane and Father Michael Lane, who were the sons of John Lane d1934, with most of the detail taken off old headstones.\n\nThe town land is the smallest and most ancient of the Irish land divisions. There were 60,462 town lands in Ireland. Shravokee and Mt. O'Donnell were the old local names for the official town land of Srawickeen.\n\nThe Civil Parish is in effect a group of Town lands which in our case was Kiltenanlea.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Parish was Donnas. Due to the imposition of the English System of Local Government in the 16th Century, Ireland had to adapt to a different Civil Parish system centered on towns and villages. The local people continued to use the Roman Catholic system.\n\nThe Poor Law Union  Ireland in 1838 was divided into unions or districts to which the local rateable tenants were to be financially responsible for the care of paupers or poor people in their areas. These areas were generally centred on a large market town. In this case, the Poor Law Union was Limerick.\n\nIreland was divided into four provinces and Clonlara was in the province of Munster.\n\nSrawickeen at the time of The Griffiths Valuation consisted of a little over 361 acres described as good arable, pasture and meadow land, of which 30% was liable to flooding due to its proximity to the River Shannon.\n\nCrops grown were potatoes, corn and flax.\n\nThe landlord was Daniel Barrington of Glenstal, a clerk of the Crown at Limerick. He died in 1842.\n\nThe land was let at will to 11 groups of tenants in farm sizes from 10 to 38 acres, with rents charged at £1-16-0 per acre.\n\nPopulation -:\n\n1841 Males 59. Females 43. No of Houses 11.\n\n1851 Males 53 Females 54. No of Houses 11.\n\nThe surnames of tenants occupying land included -: Moloney, Shaughnessy, Lane, Malone, Callaghan, Mulqueeny, and McCormack.\n\nIt was noted that John Moloney had a small Osiery (willows used in basket making) on his property. .\n\nThe Tithe Applotment Books of 1824 list the holders of agricultural land in Ireland who had to pay tithes to the Established Church of Ireland ie. the Protestant Church.\n\nIt was a tithe resented by the Roman Catholics of Ireland.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the Tithe Applotment Books for the Parish Of Kiltenanlea, which lists occupiers of land in the Parish as at October 24th, 1824 that a Thomas Lane occupied land at Fravoukee sharing with Roger Moloney and Daniel Shaughnessy.\n\nThere is also an entry for the almost the same landholders at Isleland.\n\nThere is another entry for a Thomas Lane occupying land at Mt. Donnell sharing with Pat and John Mulqueeny.\n\nThe place names of Isleland and Mt. Donnell are old local place names which were incorporated into the Townland of Srawickeen for the Griffiths Valuation.\n\nMt. O'Donnell is situated within a few hundred meters of Shravokee.\n\nShravokee has many spellings possibly due to the English officials not understanding the Irish accents. e.g. Shravokee, Fravoukee, Shraumucky, Shramucky, Shrenmakee, Shamalky, etc.\n\nSometimes the Lane name is spelt as Lane, Lean or Leane.\n\nThese place names with the tenants names also tie in with the Griffiths Valuations of 1851.\n\nReferring to the original records of Tithe in 1824 and in particular to the Townlands of Gurrane (Garraun), Mt. Donnell, Fravoukee (Shravoukee) and Isleland the records give an insight as to who was occupying land at that time.\n\nFor a list of landholders at the time of The Tithe by Townland refer to Clare Library Web Site -: http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/genealogy/tithe_applot/kiltenanlea_tab.htm\n\nThis can be of use when comparing landholders in Griffiths Valuation of 1851 where the names of the townlands had changed.\n\nTITHE APPLOTMENT 1824.

Previously valuations of over 40 shillings were allowed to vote.\n\nThis in effect decreased the number of landholders allowed to vote in elections from 230000 to 16000.\n\nThe register shows the following freeholders applied to be registered -:\n\nSurname\n\nForename Residence of\n\nApplicant Description of Freehold,\n\nwith names of Barony and\n\nTownland in which situated Valuation\n\nSessions\n\nheld at.

He had no choice but to let the Encumbered Court to arrange the sale of the remaining 30,000 acres.\n\nThe Annaghbeg Estate.\n\nThomas Lane (Moloney), Thomas Lane (Mulqueeny) and the other families who are named in the Tithe were tenants of the Annaghbeg Estate.\n\nAt the time of the Griffiths Valuation the Land Owner was shown as the \"Representatives of Daniel Barrington\".\n\nHe was Clerk of the Crown at Limerick but died in 1842.\n\nHe was married to Anne Williams and was the 2nd son of Sir Joseph Barrington.\n\nThe Barrington Family held very large land holdings in Clare and Limerick.\n\nThe Estate was offered for sale by Thomas William and Croker Barrington, sale by auction in the Encumbered Estate Court on the 28th June, 1850.\n\nThe Estate of 1187 acres was bought by William Jameson & George White West and was offered for sale again in 1856.\n\nThese sales provide us with further details of these families and their holdings.\n\nThis map shows the complete estate in 1850.\n\nThis map shows the complete Estate in 1856.\n\nAn enlarged view of Lot 2 shows the holdings of the various Lane families. (The various Lane holdings are near Mt.O'Donnell)\n\nSome Lane farm buildings can be referenced.\n\nNote the proximately of the Townlands of Garraun and Cappavilla.\n\nThis map shows where Mt O'Donnell is situated in reference to Schravokee.\n\nThese maps can also be compared to the Griffiths Valuation map.\n\nThe documents in 1850 Lot 2 and Lot 3 and also 1856 show the Rents and Holdings of the following tenants as well as the Terms of their Tenure -:\n\nName\n\nTotal Holding 1850\n\nTotal Holding !856\n\nRemarks\n\nThomas Lane (Molony) 36 37 Thomas Lane (Mulqueeny) 31 70 James Lane. 21 25 Transferred to Anne Lane -1856 Michael Moloney 27 38 John Moloney 17 187 Large holding Cappavilla - 1856 Bridget Malone.

O' Donnell & Shravokee as quite beautiful and that both of these divisions are bounded by the Shannon River, above which they rise gently and command a rich and varied prospect of the river and its opposite banks. They would afford a purchaser an admirable site for a residence or they might with great advantage be sub divided for villa lots.\n\nThe conditions of sale show some interesting details of the Estate.\n\nJames Lane died on 10th Feb, 1855 aged 45 and Anne Lane his wife is shown as the tenant in the 1856 sale.\n\nJohn Mulqueeny and Bridget Mulqueeny show no holdings in 1856 but Patrick Mulqueeny has 26 acres\n\nThe Griffiths Valuation Of Tenements took place in County Clare between 1852 and 1856.\n\nWe do know from the Griffith Valuations that various Lane families were farming at Shravokee (Srawickeen) ,Garraun and Quinpool North including -:\n\n1. Patrick Lane at Garraun who occupied 31 acres of land with Michael Madden.\n\n2. Thomas Lane (Moloney) at Srawickween with 38 acres of land, house and offices,\n\n3. Thomas Lane (Mulqueeny) also at Srawickween with about 30 acres of land, house and offices.\n\n4. James Lane at Srawickween with 23 acres of land, house and offices.\n\n5. Thomas Lane (Mulqueeny) at Cappavilla North with 3 acres of land.\n\nAll of these properties are in close proximity with each other. (Refer Griffiths Valuation map).\n\nIt is also not known exactly as to how these families were related.\n\nIn the case of the two Thomas Lane properties it is believed likely that there were two Thomas Lane's at the time and that the name in brackets may be the name of the partner involved to differentiate between the families.\n\nThomas Lane (Moloney) would have had a tie up with the Moloney's.\n\nThomas Lane (Mulqueeny) would have had a tie up with the Mulqueeny's.\n\nIt is believed that James Lane, who married Anne Malone was a son of Thomas Lane (Mulqueeny)\n\nThe following table shows the major land holders in the Townlands of Garraun and Srawickeen at the time of Griffiths Valuation as well as a small Lane (Mulqueeny) land holding in the Townland of Cappavilla North.

valued at £0-14-0..\n\n3(c) Bridget Malone, offices - valued at £0-10-0..\n\n3(d) Thomas Lane (Mulqueeny), house and offices - valued at £2-2-0. .\n\n3(e) Michael Moloney, house and offices - valued at £1-10-0.\n\nAll of these people occupied substantial land holdings nearby but it appears they all grouped their houses, offices and barns close together again for economy of scale.\n\nThe Wyndham Act Of 1903.\n\nLand reform was a very hot topic in Ireland for many years.\n\nThe Land Act of 1881 granted official rent reductions and recognised the \"interest' of tenants in their leased farms.\n\nThe Wyndham Act of 1903 allowed most Irish tenants the opportunity to actually purchase their holdings from their landlords with British Government assistance.\n\nLandlords received a generous set price by the government whilst tenants repaid the government purchase over time.\n\nAs a result the centuries old landlord system in Ireland, which had resulted in exploitation of the people and much suffering, was finally ended\n\nWe know that Michael Lane b1838 who came to Australia and Thomas Lane b1839 who married Mary Ward and stayed on the farm at Shravokee were brothers and were the sons of Thomas Lane b1818 and Elizabeth Gleeson.\n\nThis Thomas Lane b1818 was in turn the son of Michael Lane b1788 and Catherine Moloney.\n\nThomas Lane b1818, could not have owned land at the time of the Tithe Applotment in 1824 due to his age.\n\nThomas's father, who was named Michael Lane b1788, is not listed in the Tithe Books as holding land.\n\nIt is believed that the father of Michael Lane b1788 was the son of Thomas lane (Moloney) as\n\nthe descendents of Michael Lane b1788 have farmed the property as far back as we can trace and a descendant (Noel Madden) still farms the original Thomas Lane/Moloney holding.\n\nOther descendants in this line are Thomas Lane b1839 who married Mary Ward and stayed on the farm.\n\nJohn Lane b1879 who married Ellen McMahon who farmed the property.\n\nMichael Lane b1838 who came to Yangery, near Koroit and married Ellen Moloney.\n\nPatrick Lane b1849 who had properties in Shravokee and Limerick and married Mary Lynch.\n\nOne of the properties farmed by Michael Lane (Mulqueeny) which was occupied by James Lane b1810 est. and Ann Malone was in turn passed down to their son Patrick Lane b1837 est. who married Mary Ann Keane.\n\nJames Lane & Anne Malone descendants include Bridget Lane who married John Madden and Margaret & Mary Ann Lane who came to Australia and married the Gleeson brothers from Tower Hill near Koroit.\n\nDescendants of Patrick Lane & Mary Ann Keane include Margaret Lane (USA) who married Martin Madden & Bridget (Delia) (USA) who married Dan Clancy.\n\nThree other family members were Jim, Mary and Annie none of whom married and lived on the farm until they passed away.\n\nThe farm of 71 acres was sold in 1967.\n\nFor a comparison between surnames listed on the Tithe Applotment Records, Griffiths Valuation and the Census of 1901.\n\nhttp://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/genealogy/surname_list_combined.htm\n\nFor a list of County Clare Townlands at the time of the Tithe Applotment.\n\nhttp://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/places/townlands/tithes_townland_parish.htm\n\nFor a list of occupiers of land in the Parish of Kiltenanlea, Count Clare at the time of the Tithe Applotment in 1824..\n\nhttp://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/genealogy/tithe_applot/kiltenanlea_tab.htm\n\nClick here for photographs of Shravokee House taken in 1973 where Thomas Lane b1839 and his family lived, also shown are some of the outhouses on the property where the original Lane's probably lived.\n\nThese outhouses are possibly the ruins where various families had houses and offices as shown in Griffiths Valuation.\n\nShravokee House was demolished about 1990. This was replaced by a new home built by Noel Madden whose mother is Patricia Lane.\n\nIrish family history is difficult to trace due to the lack of records, however the following gravestones were located at Teampall Mochulla Cemetery near the Madden farm at Shravokee.\n\nLane Family cemetery.
