That, in my opinion, should be a given. What makes an advisor-client relationship successful is the interaction between them. We need to feel comfortable together in order to achieve the best possible results. That is why we devote such a large portion of our website to our life outside of the office. We want to clearly show you the type of people we are and what is most important to us.\n\nI am married to my incredible wife, Christie. We have known each other since middle school and were married in 2009. Together we have 3 awesome boys, Jackson, Gavin, and Graham. I never knew how much I could love someone or something until I became a husband and father. They provide me with unlimited motivation to be the best possible version of myself. Now that the boys are getting old enough to get into sports, I coach baseball and soccer, which has been a very rewarding addition to my life. When I’m not with my family you can probably find me in the rough somewhere looking for my golf ball. I also love to ski and try to maintain a healthy lifestyle by getting to the gym regularly. I enjoy giving back to my community, where I am the President of the Cinnaminson Education Foundation.\n\nI hope this gives you a little insight into the man that I am, and I look forward to building a long-term relationship built on trust, hard work, and friendship.\n\nPhone: (856) 638-1855\n\nEmail: tlane@lanehipple.com"
