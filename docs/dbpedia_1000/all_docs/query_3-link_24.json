It is likely that he had property in Hanover in 1719. He was on vestry of St Paul's Church in 1719. Who he married is not known, but the following are his likely issue: (son) Lane, Edward Lane b. 1705; Thomas Lane b. 1715; Daniel Lane b. 1725.[2]\n\n21 Feb 1704 A George Eskridge in Northumberland Co. VA granted 2,950a for transporting about 30 people, including a Thomas Lane. (The following year Eskridge was granted 1050a for transporting several including a Mary Lane.\n\n18 Jun 1712 Northumberland Co. Court Record: John Thomas, Court order that a road be laid out through his land for Tho. Laine. 18 Jun 1712\n\n25 Aug 1714 Lancaster Co. VA, DB11, pg2: Richard Wood of Lancaster County VA sells land to Thomas Lane of Northumberland Co. For Richard's love and affection and for one gray mare branded with an R on the right buttock ... land beginning at a white chestnut in Richard Woods ... James Black's line ...the main branch of Marrati..Creek ... Daniel MacCarty's line ... Wicomico River .. to the beginning. Wits: George Merdock(?), Richd. Welch, Daniel Coavaill(?)\n\n20 Feb 1719 Thomas Lane granted the right to purchase 600a for 3 pounds. The land was on the north side of Little River at the North Anna and Pamunkey, adjoining John Kimbrow and Edward Garland. New Kent County VA.\n\n29 Jul 1719 Need explicit data on the following:\n\n'WESTMORELAND COUNTY, VIRGINIA ORDER BOOK: 1718-1721 [Antient Press]; Page 371 At a Court held for the said County the 29th day of July 1719. GEORGE TURBERVILE, Gent. presented into Court an Inquisition by him taken on the body of THOMAS LANE and one other taken on the body of JANE MORRISS both which were ordered to'\n\nThis entry could be the link for this Thomas and his father James to Thomas Lane of Northumberland (our current subject's possible grandfather). As of yet, there is no hard evidence linking this Thomas to James, and no hard evidence linking James to the older Thomas.\n\n8 Oct 1719 Thomas Lane's land processioned into a precinct.\n\n8 Feb 1720 Lancaster Co. VA Book 11, page 184: Thomas Lane of St. Mary's White Chappell in Lancaster County VA to Owen Kelly of same. Sd. Thomas Lane for in consideration of 1070lbs of Tobacco, one pair of spoons & ladel, ...five yards of Kerley & buttons, Mohair to trim, to him the sd Thomas Lane by Owen Kelly, 35a of land in Lancaster, part of 420a granted to Richd White & George Vincent in 4 Apr 1671.

Nathaniel West's Mill Creek Tract and Charles Chiswell.\n\n1739 Thomas Lane and sons William and Daniel are documented in the Cedar Creek Quaker meeting house in Hanover County VA.\n\n1742 Louisa County created. It's clear that Thomas was granted more lands in Hanover that fell into Louisa when it was created. Those records recorded in Hanover were likely lost in the fire.\n\n1747 Death. In a 1746 deed in Louisa his son Thomas Lane was referred to as Jr. which likely meant this man was still alive. Therefore, our current subject died in 1747 or later. No record available. Many lands were clearly inherited by his children in Louisa (and sold later) but the inheritance records were lost.\n\nRecords Lost\n\n1862 Hanover County Historical Society Quote: The Battle of Hanover Courthouse, on May 27, 1862, brought heavy skirmishing through the Courthouse area, and when Union forces returned at the end of May 1864, they imprisoned Hanover County's Clerk of Court.\n\nThe county's court records were shortly thereafter boxed up and moved to Richmond for \"safekeeping,\" which proved to be a poor decision indeed when much of Richmond was burned to the ground in April of 1865 by the retreating Confederacy. Hanover is considered a Burned Record County, as most of its pre-Civil War court records were lost in the blaze.\n\nResearch Notes\n\nApparently many records for Hanover County have been destroyed.\n\nEnglish Duplicates of Lost VA Records of Quit Rents of 1704 include a Thomas Lane of New Kent, VA (p. 167) and Thomas Lane and Thomas Lane, Jr of Surry (p. 268). New Kent is adjacent to Hanover and 70 miles away from Surry/Sussex.\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"James Lane\", p.7 in N.
