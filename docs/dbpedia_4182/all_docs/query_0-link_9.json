        "text": "Quotes • Headscratchers • Playing With • Useful Notes • Analysis • Image Links • Haiku • Laconic\n\nThe writers put in a joke (almost always a pun), but never make or put in a punch line or explicit statement, hiding it in the set up of the joke. Some percentage of the audience will \"get\" the joke, but the rest will know it was there and be going, \"What? Why didn't you say it?\" There can be several reasons.\n\nIt's naughty and not appropriate for this time-slot, in which case this serves the same purpose as a Last-Second Word Swap.\n\nIt's an Incredibly Lame Pun and is only remotely funny when realized later; using it in story would grind everything to a halt.\n\nTelling the punch line would keep our lawyers busy for months, so we'll just leave a blank here and let you do the copyright infringement.\n\nThe writer thinks they're being clever. Sometimes they even are.\n\nThey are trying to set up a moment of Fridge Brilliance.\n\nThe pun is in the middle of a song, poem, or other rhythmic verse, where using it fully would break the meter.\n\nThe form can range a bit from a \"fill in the blank\" stand up style jokes to cases where the plot and setting form a pun that you only realise when you try to summarise the situation later. If you're on the Internet, expect someone to respond \"I see what you did there\".\n\nAlso, as this page is about puns that are intentionally obscured in-work, it is one of the few times when it is good form to explain the joke.\n\nCompare Visual Pun, another form of subtle punning.\n\nExamples of Stealth Pun include:\n\nAdvertising[]\n\n\"Charmin\" toilet paper commercials featured cartoon bears. Left entirely unsaid is they're all about bears shitting in the woods.\n\nAn advert airing in the UK has an angry bear in the middle of a cubicle farm, who turns back into a flustered office worker when given a painkiller. Implying, of course, that she's acting like a bear with a sore head.\n\nBoost Mobile has a commercial with Danica Patrick racing and going into the pit where her pit crew are a bunch of men dressed in outfits similar to the Dallas cowboy cheerleaders, one even has tan lines for a bikini. So it features drag racing.\n\nIn the 1980s, noted football/baseball player Bo Jackson appeared in a series of ads under the concept \"Bo knows\". Inevitably, there would be a sport he didn't know, often leading to the response \"Bo don't know diddly!\" The stealth was later removed and lampshaded when several ads featured the noted guitarist.\n\nIn fact, he was trying and failing to play a guitar when the famed performer himself said, \"Bo, you don't know Diddly.\"\n\nIn another commercial of the same type, Sonny Bono showed up, saying \"I thought it was another 'Bo Knows' commercial.\"\n\nThere's an advertisement for Sharp Quattron Pixel Technology, which features George Takei promoting the four-color TV in question. It would seem that Takei is only in the commercial for his hammitude, but some careful thought reveals a dastardly hidden pun. Watch:\n\nGeorge Takei is very, very gay.\n\nHe is also very, very Asian.\n\nThe new Quattron technology adds yellow to the standard RGB array of colors in a TV's pixels.\n\nSo, what is George Takei describing? He's describing adding YELLOW to the RAINBOW. Now, the reason why the pun in question needed to be made seems to lie in Takei's fondness for all kinds of stupid puns, as evidenced by his facebook wall. It might be hard to understand for many a good folks, but it's a sneaky one regardless.\n\nThis commercial begins with a driver placing a CD in a car stereo. A familiar song plays. The driver turns up the volume and rocks out, while the passenger is clearly uncomfortable. As they drive along, other drivers sound their horns, give the thumbs up and whatnot. Finally, the vehicle is shown and before they reach the chorus, they cut away. The song is Queen's \"Another One Bites The Dust\" and the car is a hearse leading a funeral procession.\n\nA UK advert for children's shoes showed kids the size of tower blocks running around a city. And the music? \"Birdhouse In Your Soul\". Because they might be...\n\nThe font used to write the original Cooper Tire logo is actually called Cooper Black. They redesigned the logo in a way so its name is written in a different font all because of this.\n\nSimilarly, the font used to write the word \"Optima\" on a Slim Fast Optima bottle is actually called Optima.\n\nAnd the older logo for the University Inn in Seattle, WA was originally written using University Roman.\n\nAnime and Manga[]\n\nThe Geneon dub of Lupin III once had Jigen describe a house-fly that turned out to be a listening device as \"a flying pun\".\n\nIn Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Nanoha is pursuing Jewel Seeds. One such Jewel Seed had possessed a tree that was near a couple's confession of love, and it responded by turning into a massive murdering monster, trapping them inside itself and trying to consume everything. The pun comes when you realise that they pined for each other. (This pun actually works in Japanese, too.)\n\nIn Chobits, Hideki is searching desperately for the on switch for his new discovery, a female robot, when he says there's only one place left he hadn't checked. Cut outside to a mewing cat.\n\nThe main character of One Piece is named Monkey D. Luffy, and his first appearance in the anime was breaking out of a small barrel. Perhaps the implication is that the show will be more fun than a barrel of monkeys.\n\nOr about Donkey Kong.\n\nAnother pair are for Mr. 1, his devil fruit is called the Supa-Supa fruit, it gives him super powers and his secret dream is to be a super hero. The obvious one is \"super\" a play on \"Supa\", his devil fruit name. The second not quite pun is he is literally a Man of Steel. A \"Supaman\" if you will..\n\nLater in the series, Sanji uses a move called the \"Parage Shot\" to change people's looks by kicking them in the face. In other words, he can literally \"rearrange your face\".\n\nCowboy Bebop: Spike goes out with a bang.\n\nPossibly unintentional, but Edward Elric's attempts at human transmutation in Fullmetal Alchemist literally cost him An Arm and a Leg.\n\nA particularly painful one is the Mobile Suit Gundam MSV model MS-07H-4 Gouf Flight Test Type, a prototype Zeon mobile suit adorned with their iconic mono-eye camera and forehead-mounted communications antenna, and painted in outrageous magenta demo-colors. An early, unsuccessful attempt at creating a flight-capable Humongous Mecha, it was scrapped for its unfortunate tendency to kill its test pilots. Long story short, it's a one eyed, one horned, flying purple people-eater.\n\nIn another, more obscure Gundam example, one of the various artbooks features a scene with Haman Karn eating a piece of cake with a candy on top shaped like one of her Humongous Mecha Quebeley's funnels.\n\nThen there's Gundam ZZ, who is composed of two (or three, depending on how you count) fighters. One forms the legs, the other goes on top.\n\nAt the end of the first episode of Gankutsuou, Albert is making out with Peppo, the local \"Bridget\" (although he doesn't know that yet), when she stops him and, points a gun at him, and helps kidnappers take him hostage (thus, she had a pistol in her pocket, but might have been happy to see him as well).\n\nAlso, it really was a trap.\n\nBecause of their Make Me Wanna Shout/Magic Music powers, those operating the Dolems (sort of living mecha) in RahXephon are termed instrumentalists. Although the series involves an End of the World Special rather than an Assimilation Plot, there's probably a deliberate allusion to \"Instrumentality\", given that RahXephon is sort of a Lighter and Softer Neon Genesis Evangelion.\n\nThere's one that's true of both RahXephon and Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin. Both series make reference to the whole \"2012 End of the World\" idea, and it's probably no coincidence that both also have characters named Maya.\n\nIn Darker than Black, April has the power to create real hurricanes that make it rain. No one refers to \"April Showers\" though.\n\nThe Pokémon episode that introduced Barry is titled \"Barry's Busting Out All Over!\" Even if you get the reference, it sounds inexplicable, unless you are aware that Barry's Japanese name is Jun.\n\nPokémon: Jirachi Wishmaker: One of the characters in the movie is Butler. He's a villain. In other words? The Butler Did It.\n\nCharles Goodshow is the president of the Pokémon League and appears in the episodes pertaining to the larger tournaments. He is a short elderly man with a large beard, bright-colored shorts and a backwards cap, giving the visible impression that he is still a child at heart. Goodshow, old boy?\n\nAlternately, Jolly Goodshow.\n\nIn Pokémon Special, White has a Sandile actor trained to cry for any sad scene. Crocodile Tears\n\nIn New Getter Robo, there's a pun in the first episode. When Ryouma is told by Professor Saotome that he is to be one of the pilots of the Getter Robo, Ryoma replies \"Getter?\" With the scene being shot at floor level, focusing on Saotome's \"geta\".\n\nA flashback in Naruto has someone hearing what Sasuke's name is, and commenting that's also the name of the Third Hokage's father. The Third Hokage's real name is Hiruzen Sarutobi, thus making his father...\n\nAnother example could be during one of the fillers, Naruto has to sit in during the funeral and has to not laugh the entire time or else the person they're doing the mission for will not get the inheritance which causes for everyone trying to get him to laugh. One of the gags that happened were with a guy having a flower coming out of his nose. In Japanese, the word for nose can also mean flower.\n\nHidamari Sketch: When the residents of the Hidamari Apartments go to a sentō following the cultural festival, they relate things that they did and experienced. For example, during a Cinderella play they put on, Miyako did the voice of a horse; while in the baths, Hiro asks her to replicate it. Miyako refuses, not wanting to sell herself cheap, but an unspoken reason is that horseplay is against bathhouse etiquette. (Probably not intended...)\n\nThe Tatami Galaxy represents the protagonist's libido via a cowboy with a phallic-looking nose called \"Johnny\". The intent becomes clearer when you realize that he looks a whole lot like Woody from Toy Story.\n\nIn the Virtual World arc in Yu-Gi-Oh, Noah, the arc villain chooses Shinnato's Ark for his Deckmaster. It is never mentioned that this would make it Noah's Ark.\n\nIn Black Butler, demonic butler Sebastian Michaelis' catchphrase is \"I'm just one hell of a butler.\" Has the bonus of working perfectly in its original language as well.\n\nThe title of Neko Kissa is either a Bilingual Bonus Stealth Pun or a Accidental Pun. In Japanese, \"Neko\" = \"Cat\" and \"Kissa\" = \"Cafe\". So, \"Cat Cafe\". The title could also be translated as being the word \"cat\" in two different languages - Japanese and Finnish: Neko (Japanese), Kissa (Finnish).\n\nOsaka of Azumanga Daioh is somehow unable to so much as float when in the water in an episode taking place at the pool. She's dense. In spite of this, she can somehow keep just far enough above the water to speak with Tomo and Nyamo during the same scene. Maybe she's airheaded.\n\nIn Tiger and Bunny, Nathan's name, when pronounced in Japanese (\"Nee-San\"), sounds eerily like the role he plays in the series. There's also Kotetsu/Wild Tiger's eye color, which shifts between Brown Eyes, gold, and something in between. There's actually a gemstone with the same sort of coloring. It's called tiger's eye.\n\nIn the first episode of Medaka Box, Hyuga knocks Zenkichi unconscious and calls him \"Ahoge.\" (Idiot.) The scene abruptly cuts to Shiranui. Just look at her hair!\n\nComic Books[]\n\nDuring one of Adam Warren's Dirty Pair stories, a villain introduces a clone of \"good girl\" Yuri into the convention the girls are hosting, to shake things up. We first hear about \"clone-Yuri's\" antics from one of the con-goers (much to real Yuri's distress). Then we cut to Clone Yuri's room and we can clearly see (though the words are never spoken) that she has been literally \"screwed, blued, and tattooed\".\n\nDuring a Robin issue during Infinite Crisis, the Teen Titans are in a secret lab looking for a cure for Superboy, after his first beating by Superboy-Prime. Speedy who has HIV asks for everyone to look out for a \"Speedy Fix\". Notable for making a Black Comedy pun.\n\nTwo issues of James Robinson's Firearm involved the title character entering a virtual world based on Glasgow, mostly as a gift to Glaswegian artist Gary Erskine. In one panel, Erskine drew a figure that resembled Alex from A Clockwork Orange outside an underground station. The local nickname for Glasgow's underground railway is \"the clockwork orange\".\n\nIn Watchmen, Rorschach breaks Nite-Owl's lock to get into his apartment. It gets replaced. Then he does it again. It gets replaced. Then the police break in. The lock holds but the door is destroyed. The pun? The lock company was called Gordian Knot Lock Company.\n\nThis is less likely to be a pun than an intentional thread in Moore's insanely complicated web of incestuous connections in Watchmen. Ozymandias later refers to Alexander the Great and cutting through the Gordian Knot, which is also, metaphorically, what he himself ends up doing.\n\nRorschach's foe in prison is short, and his two henchmen are, respectively, nasty and brutish. All three of them perceive Rorschach's comments (\"small world\", \"fat chance\", etc.) as being snide remarks about them.... Hrm... possibly true. Must look into later.\n\nUltimate Spider-Man updates Peter Parker's status quo; he still works for the Daily Bugle in this version, but he helps manage their internet site instead of taking pictures. That's right, Spider-Man's a webmaster.\n\nThe second issue of the Great Ten series is called The Tao of Archery. It involves Celestial Archer, whose real name is Xu Tao.\n\nOne of Brian K. Vaughan's earlier works was a backup story in a Batman special where, among other things, the Joker breaks into a chemical lab to steal bomb ingredients. While he's there, he decides to amuse himself by re-arranging canisters so the abbreviations on the labels spell out funny things. Boron Argon and Flourine spell BArF, which is \"Positively tame\" compared to what he did with Copper (Cu) and Niton (Nt).\n\nThat must have been a very old canister — \"Niton\" has been officially named Radon for almost eighty years.\n\nWhere do you practice your Deathstroke? In the Deadpool, of course.\n\nIn Preacher, two minor villains list their \"services\" as Sexual Investigators.\n\nOr to put it another way, private dicks.\n\nGladiator, the Superboy counterpart in Marvel's Captain Ersatz Legion of Super-Heroes, comes from the planet Strontia. While his Kryptonite Factor is actually self-doubt, it's probably not a coincidence that Strontianite is a real mineral.\n\nJ. Jonah Jameson was mutated in Earth X. It wasn't revealed until the end that he had a head of a donkey. That's right, he became a jackass.\n\nAt one point, the various Clayfaces (who, as the name suggests, are made of living clay) teamed up to take on Batman. Two of them fell in love, married and had a child. What was his name? Cassius.\n\nA stealth pun in Salvation Run (Stealth rhyme? I swear I didn't mean it. Anybody want a peanut?) is explained in the third story here.\n\nIn The Wizard of Id, a visitor to the untrustworthy King's castle notices that the King's flag consists of a pair of black X's on a white background. The visitor asks for the name of this emblem. The king moves on to another pun before it mentioned the king is represented by Double Crosses.\n\nCharlie Chaplin did that joke earlier in The Great Dictator, where Adenoid Hynkel's movement is also referred to as the Sons (and Daughters) of the Double Cross. By the way, a different type of double cross (two horizontal bars) has been used in heraldry centuries before the term \"to double-cross\" was invented (it comes from horse-racing).\n\nA rare unfunny example that's nonetheless good: an arc in The Sandman spin-off The Dreaming was about the loneliness of Matthew the Raven, entitled \"The Unkindness of One\".\n\nDeath from The Sandman made a Lawyer-Friendly Cameo during Peter David's run on Incredible Hulk. She visited Marlo Chandler's wedding and gave her a brush as a wedding present. Marlo had recently died and come back to life. Get it? She had a brush with death.\n\nIn one issue of Top Ten, a bunch of stretchy heroes gawk at a teleporting accident as they drive by. Yes – those Rubber Men are rubbernecking.\n\nUsually, the first words out of an infant's mouth is \"Mama\" or \"Dada/Papa\". In Archie Comics, what is the first word of scientific genius Dilton? Pythagoras, the father of Geometry.\n\nMoose, a Literal-Minded individual, provides lots of these. In one story, he was selected as an election candidate. When he appears at the pre-meeting, Mr. Weatherbee asks Moose why he was wearing a track outfit, Moose replies that it's because people are telling him that he's going to \"run for office\". In another, Dilton's advice to Moose is that he should put his money in the bank to make it grow. Moose decides to grow the money himself, and instead goes home, puts the money in a flowerpot and begins to water it.[1]\n\nIn Alan Moore's Cthulhu Mythos/porn comic Neonomicon, wherein there's a literary allusion to the works of H.P. Lovecraft on practically every page, drug dealer/avatar of Nyarlathotep/screaming queen Johnny Carcosa shows up dressed up like Edward Elric. This seems like kind of a random thing to reference, until you remember that one of Lovecraft's short stories was entitled The Alchemist.\n\nThe waste disposal robot in The Smurfs comic book story \"You Don't Smurf Progress\" would eat garbage and turn them into bricks that he would expel from his rear hatch. In essence, he was shitting bricks.\n\nFan Works[]\n\nIn Three Messengers, one of the fortune-tellers is Old Woman Riley—in Japanese, this would be Riley-obaba. The author is a fan of The Who.\n\nMost Actor Allusion Fan Art of characters cosplaying as other characters with the same seiyuu for both characters is never said out loud unless someone actually asks. Like all those Shana, Louise, Nagi and Taiga Fan Art.\n\nThe fanfic Azuvengers gives the Azumanga Daioh girls the powers of different Marvel Comics characters - Sakaki is the Sentry, Yomi is the Incredible Hulk, and so forth. Osaka learns magic, gets a flying umbrella, and communicates clairaudibly with a man named Steve. She's Dr. Strange.\n\nIn the Haruhi Suzumiya/TV Tropes crossover Kyon: Big Damn Hero, chapter eleven's name is Yeah, It Went There. It's saying this chapter will get Up to Eleven.\n\nThere's a Daria fanfic where it turns out that Tiffany's biological father is one of the actors from Osamu Tezuka's Star System. Specifically, Lampe.\n\nMetal Gear fanfic The Joy of Battle: Historical Espionage Action is full of stealth puns, especially in the chapter titles. The second chapter is called \"Schadenfreude\" which includes the word \"joy\" (freude in German), also the main character's name. The most bizarre is probably the chapter \"Stained Glass\" in which there is a moment near the end where a grassy lawn is stained with blood. Stained grass... incredibly lame and probably entirely on purpose.\n\nThis Pokémon fan comic has a Stealth Pun that doubles as a Shout-Out. The pun in question is the species of the Pokemon, Quagsire... which is based off the word Quagmire, which also happens to be the name of a legendarily perverted character from Family Guy.\n\nIn the Sherlockian fic The Ghost Map, Colonel Moran has a Sidekick/Dragon named Yorick. In the Sequel Hook at the end of the story, guess who bites the dust, courtesy of the Bigger Bad? That's right. Alas, poor Yorick!\n\nFilms — Animation[]\n\nIn South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Gregory (the French revolutionary kid), at the beginning of the song montage that got the film nominated for an Oscar, jumps up on a wooden box to sing about freedom and rights etc. On the box in big stenciled letters is the word SOAP.\n\nThat's less a pun and more a stock reference.\n\nIn Shrek, the evil Lord Farquaad is alleged to have been based partially upon then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who had a falling out in the mid-Nineties with Jeffrey Katzenberg, who would go on to found DreamWorks—the company that produced Shrek. \"Farquaad\" is rumoured to be a cloaked insult aimed at Eisner, calling him a fuckwad.\n\nAccording to Word of God, it's a reference to the \"Far Quad\" on the campus of the writer's alma mater, Notre Dame—full name Notre Dame du Lac (Dulac is the name given to Farquaad's little kingdom). However, the obvious pronunciation-gag was not missed by FoxTrot, which used the second meaning as a stealth punchline.\n\nAlso, anyone familiar with ND will recognize a certain building outline (The Golden Dome) on the back of Shrek's vest.\n\nIn Shrek 2 the potion given to the King to make Fiona fall in love with the first man she kisses is labeled \"IX\". It is not mentioned then that it must be Love Potion Number 9.\n\nIn the scene where Shrek and Donkey (in human and horse forms) are in a bar after their plan fails, the barmaid says to Shrek \"Why the long face?\", while Donkey is standing right next to him.\n\nIn Coraline, the seats of the theater are filled with small dogs—Scotties. Later, when the world shows its dark side, the dogs become skeletons... Night Terriers?\n\nThe toy tank in the Otherworld bedroom resembles the British Mark 1, which nickname is... Mother.\n\nIn Up, there is a scene in which several dogs pilot fighter planes, making them... dogfighters.\n\nAlso, Dug's name. No, that isn't misspelled.\n\nThe dogs are introduced in order of the Greek alphabet; Alpha, Beta, Gamma... Epsilon. There is never a Delta shown, there is however Dug. Furthermore, he is the fourth dog named.\n\nIn Cars, Sally Carrera, the female lawyer car, is a Porsche. The term Portia is a slang term for a female lawyer; it was lifted from the female lead from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, who impersonated a lawyer to defend Antonio against Shylock.\n\nIn a later scene, Lightning notices Sally (who used to be from Los Angeles) has a decal just above her bumper, the car equivalent of a tattoo on the small of the back, which is sometimes known as a \"California license plate\".\n\nIn another scene, Lightning claims Doc Hudson is a famous racing car, the Hudson Hornet, who \"won three Piston Cups!\", causing Mater to Spit Take and say \"He did what in his cup?\"\n\nIn The Incredibles, the name of Syndrome's island is only mentioned once: a passing reference to \"current temperature on Nomanisan\" during Mr. Incredible's second visit. \"No-man-is-an Island\". This could also serve as a Meaningful Name, if you consider the way Syndrome became who he is now.\n\nThis is also the reason for Violet's Meaningful Name (she's painfully shy, i.e., a \"Shrinking Violet\"). Or it could refer to ultraviolet, referencing her powers (energy shields and invisibility). Same with her brother Dash who is extremely fast.\n\nJack-Jack, as his powers are a \"jack of all trades\" thing.\n\nTheir ironic pun of a last name: Parr. As in average.\n\nWALL-E: When EVE comes back with a plant, activating the centuries old recolonization protocol, a manual pops out, which the captain orders to relay its information. AUTO shows him that the pages must be turned by himself; i.e., it is Manual.\n\nWALL-E's name. It's actually A113 (a common running gag featured in many Pixar films, such as \"Directive A113\", also from this movie), but written in Leet Speak and with a \"W\" added to the front.\n\nWALL-E (with the E standing for Earth-class) eventually runs into an Axiom-class version of himself named WALL-A. Actually, he runs into two of them. Which of course means that they're... WALL-A WALL-A. *rimshot*\n\nIn Toy Story 2, Woody has a nightmare about Andy throwing him away. In Toy Story 3, Woody tells the other toys he needs to get to Andy's house, which is on Elm Street. Woody had a nightmare on Elm street.\n\nWoody is the leader of Andy's room—in the first movie, we see that Slinky is (or used to be) the second-in-command. A cowboy... and a \"long little doggy\"...\n\nIn 3, one of the toys at Sunnyside Daycare is a blue stuffed kitten. Who gets played with by a little girl that tells it \"Boo!\"\n\nAt the very beginning of Finding Nemo, just right before the divers take him away, causing his father to go after them, the titular Nemo can be seen attending school with several other young fish. A group of fish is actually called a school.\n\nAlmost every name in the movie is a reference to fish or something water-related. Gil, Marlin, [Captain] Nemo, Anchor, Chum... Even Deb (Flo and Deb, or, if you prefer, Ebb and Flow).\n\nRatatouille has a few to boast of as well, including Alfredo Linguini, whose name is so dreadfully punny it's almost painful to utter aloud, and Anton Ego. Along with the title of the movie, of course, although that's lampshaded.\n\nIn Disney's Robin Hood, Maid Marian (a vixen) has a hen as a nursemaid, but nobody references the aphorism about \"setting a fox to watch the henhouse\".\n\nProbably because a hen is watching the foxhouse, which isn't a thing.\n\nThere is, however, the saying about someone who is constantly anxious and worried being a \"mother hen\".\n\nIt could also mean that Maid Marian is \"henpecked\" by her nursemaid.\n\nA scene specifically depicts Friar Tuck, who is portrayed as a badger, cheering during a fight scene, while the music playing in the background is the fight song of the University of Wisconsin Badgers.\n\nIn Corpse Bride, the bar where Victor first arrives is called the \"Ball and Socket\", making it the Ball and Socket joint. And the bar is a popular place, or a \"hip joint\".\n\nThe first Veggie Tales movie contained—without comment—a bunch of city guards whose weapons were long poles with fish on the ends of them.\n\nThe writers behind Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs claim they had to turn one of the opening lines into a version of Stealth Pun #2. To wit:\n\nIn A Matter of Loaf and Death, Wallace attempts to stop Piella's bicycle by having Gromit throw tea cakes between his knees and the bicycle and squeezing them. He says he should have tried the granary rolls, which makes sense; after all, Let us break bread together on our knees... no?\n\nIn The Great Mouse Detective, Basil and Dr. Dawson walk into a bar to find information on Ratigan, who lures them into his lair and into a gigantic trap. The name of the bar they enter? The Rat Trap.\n\nIn The Iron Giant, Dean, the artist, directs the Giant to make a mobile, a hanging children's toy, out of cars. Automobile\n\nIn Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, there is a Training Montage/Good Times Montage which involves various shots of Ga'hoole—a vast city full of owls. (Well, vast if you're an owl, anyway.) Over said montage, there's a cheerful song called \"To the Sky.\" The song itself is not a pun on the action happening... until you realize what band is performing it.\n\nPorco Rosso is about when pigs fly.\n\nAt the end of The Princess and the Frog, the firefly character dies, and a funeral is held for him.\n\nAnd after his funeral is over, said firefly for some reason is reincarnated as a star in the night sky.\n\nToward the end of the \"Pomp and Circumstance\" sequence from Fantasia 2000, a female dove actually bursts into tears after Donald Duck throws her mate over the railing of Noah's Ark so that he can find the olive branch.\n\nExcept that mourning doves don't look like that...\n\nOne of the lyrics from the song \"Topsy Turvy\" from The Hunchback of Notre Dame is \"...every clown's a king and every king's a clown...\". The song is question is actually sung by Clopin, a colorful and enigmatic character who constantly refers himself as the king of the Gypsies, and dresses up in a clown suit.\n\nA Stealth Shout-Out: there's a horse with two rear ends in the crowd.\n\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire featured giant insects that for some reason caught fire and exploded if they made contact with anything on the ground.\n\nAt the end of the film, Kida is last seen climbing up a large rock structure wearing a long, flowing dress and a tiara with pink and blue feathers coming out of the back, making her a High Queen.\n\nIn Antz, the two main characters come across two insects by the name of \"Chip\" and \"Muffy\" who talk with Thurston Howell III type accents and act in other ways consistent with the stereotype of a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. While never specifically named, its obvious from their character models that they are in the order hymenoptera, specifically WASPS.\n\nThis little tidbit shows up at one point in the film Brave: ACXIII.\n\nThe Rugrats Movie had Charlotte say towards the beginning of the movie, when referring to the soon-to-be-born Dil, \"You know what they say - born under Venus, look for a--\" which is then interrupted by her cellphone ringing.\n\nFilms — Live-Action[]\n\nSaved has several blink-and-you'll-miss-it stealth pun moments, including \"is he going to come out or not?!\" and \"your mother's missionary position....\" They make no sense out of context and are pretty hard to explain, but in the film they're just a few of many subtle moments of brilliance.\n\nIn the middle of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Nick asks Russ where he learned artificial respiration after he delivers it to Amy. Russ replies, \"In French class\". Nick doesn't get it and the build-up is left unfinished... then, at the very end of the movie, right after the Fade to Black, Nick suddenly gets it and laughs hysterically.\n\nIn Evan Almighty, Evan's wife is Joan. And the movie is about building an ark.\n\nThis one may also count as a Genius Bonus. When God shows up in the back of Evan's car and scares the pants off him, God replies \"Let it out, son. It's the beginning of wisdom.\" Proverbs 1:7 states \"The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom\"\n\nNoah had a son named Ham. Evan has a son named Ryan, or Ry. Ham and Rye.\n\nIn The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the meal the characters have been eating is suddenly revealed to be the remains of Eddie, played by the singer Meat Loaf. The audience traditionally fills in the joke: \"Not Meatloaf again!\"\n\n\"That's a rather tender subject.\"\n\n\"That's a rather tasteless joke.\"\n\nAnd don't forget the well-hung speakers.\n\nMeat Loaf also made an appearance on Tales from the Crypt. Take a wild guess at what happened to his character.\n\nIn Scotland, PA, an adaptation of Macbeth set in and around a fast food restaurant, it is casually mentioned that Donald (Donalbain in Macbeth) and Malcolm's father, Duncan, made most of his money through donut sales. Duncan Donuts. Later, Donald takes over the restaurant, which had been renamed to McBeth's, and calls it, well, guess what... McDonald's, of course.\n\nIn the 2009 Star Trek movie, the alien in the bar that sits between Uhura and Kirk has elongated features. So why didn't the bartender say \"Why the long face?\"\n\nRiff Trax did it.\n\nThe character was credited as \"Long Face\".\n\nIn yet another Star Trek film, the commanders of a Klingon vessel give the order of \"Fire at will.\" There is an immediate cut to the bridge of their target, the Enterprise, currently commanded by Commander Riker. Will Riker.\n\nPicard did the same thing in the series during a training exercise.\n\nAnd in a Star Trek: New Frontier novel, we get \"I've been wanting to say this for ages...Fire at Will.\"\n\nThat joke was done in Tale Spin too, but the order was followed by a volley of gunfire and the line, \"Do not fire at Will, he is my second mate. Fire at the Sea Duck!\"\n\nIt's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World: The guy at the beginning of the movie, who tells the four drivers about the treasure buried under a big W, as he dies, kicks a bucket with his foot.\n\nI used that same visual pun in a production of The Fantasticks when the Indian dies.\n\nIn The Dark Knight Saga, the police convoy is diverted by a large vehicle that had been set ablaze. When you see the vehicle up close, you realize what it is and the stealth pun indicates it as one of the Joker's jokes. It's a fire engine.\n\nAnd by the end of the second act, the Batmobile has lost a wheel (well, two, but whatever) and the Joker got away.\n\nIn the original Flash Gordon the aliens have ray guns that fire gauntlets/armored gloves which strangle and throw people. That's right, the aliens have HAND-guns.\n\nIt's also a case of \"throwing down the gauntlet\" (i.e., challenge) to the good guys.\n\nIn Jeepers Creepers, the two main characters are nearly run off the road by a truck with a Vanity License Plate which says \"BEATNGU\". Darry guesses it just meant \"beating you\", but it's never stated what it really meant: \"be eating you\", as the driver is really the man-eating monster.\n\nFor the first shot of the villain in The Neverending Story II, she has no face until she takes a swipe of some mystical glowing gunk on her hands and swipes it over her face. Guess she just had to put her face on.\n\nEither that or it's Face creme.\n\nThe title of the excellent German short film Schwarzfahrer means fare dodger, though it could literally be interpreted (with some license) as \"black rider\". It features a black man sitting on a tram next to a Racist Grandma who puts him through racial abuse, including saying all black people had AIDS. When the conductor comes round to collect the tickets, the black man eats her ticket, making her a lawbreaking type of schwarzfahrer. For added irony, a biker onlooker who never had a ticket gets let off.\n\nThis may or may not be a stretch, but after the makers of Monty Python and the Holy Grail ran out of money, they just had the film end with everyone being arrested by the police for the death of a historian earlier in the film. In other words, the ending is a cop-out.\n\nThe Bride's exchange with O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill Vol. 1 could count, since (unless you were able to get a good look at her passport when she flew to Japan) we don't learn until Vol. 2 that her name is Beatrix Kiddo:\n\nA possible double bonus: So you're saying that they called a woman named Beatrix a \"rabbit\"?\n\nAdditionally, Bill repeatedly calls the Bride \"kiddo\".\n\nIn Clue, Professor Plum: \"I work for U.N.O., the United Nations Organization. I work for a special branch, the World Health Organization.\" (I.e., he works for UNO [you know] WHO.)\n\nLord Voldemort?!\n\n\"Mr. Boddy won't be staying with us for very long. In fact, he's just Lee Ving.\"\n\nIn Terminator 2, the T-800 chases John Connor through a mall carrying a box of flowers with a rifle inside. For 50 points, what was the name of the band that had a breakaway hit for the movie?\n\nIn the Æon Flux movie, when breaking into Trevor's estate, Æon's partner shows off her new genetically modified feet, altered into hands for added utility. When Æon asks how they're working out, she replies, \"Useful\". In other words, \"Handy\".\n\nIn Mean Girls, Janis Ian (named for a lesbian folk singer) has been hounded throughout high school by rumors that she's gay. While hating her former best friend for starting the rumors and causing her to be ostracized, she never actually denies liking girls, and at times it seems the movie is teasing us with the question. Then at the end, she winds up in a relationship with Kevin, after he comes up to her to find out if she fits his policy of \"only dating women of color\":\n\nThe end credits for Stranger Than Fiction include a few visual puns. For instance, the credit for the casting director has a couch underneath it.\n\nThe title character of Bubba Ho-Tep yells vulgarities in hieroglyphics during the final confrontation. The mummy's curse.\n\nHot Shots! Part Deux has the rescue action take place in a Qurac country (albeit one with a sufficient enough jungle backdrop to allow parodies of the Vietnam set Rambo: First Blood: Part 2). They actually show it on a map by fashioning it out of the Iranian side of the Iran/Iraq border. Presumably due to the upheavals which lead to this split, Iran is labelled simple as A Hard Place. In other words, it was placed between Iraq and A Hard Place.\n\nIn Zombieland, twice Tallahassee guns down zombies whilst riding a rollercoaster. In other words it's an on-rail shooter.\n\nDungeons & Dragons has the villain knock the hero to the ground and shout \"not so Talented now, are you Mister Ridley?.\n\nIn Inception, during Yusuf's dream, in the first level, Cobb accidentally creates a locomotive in the middle of the street. He was probably thinking about his dead wife, Mal. In other words, it was his train of thought.\n\nAnd also the moment their plan goes off the rails.\n\nIt also tells us that the relationship turned into a real trainwreck\n\nIn Back to The Future Part II Doc Brown warns about meeting yourself from another time, thus creating a paradox. Near the end, you actually have Doc Brown meeting up with himself; thus creating a \"pair o' Docs\".\n\nIn Land of the Lost film it's telling that the place with an above average tachyon flow is one decidedly lacking in taste.\n\nRiddled throughout Hot Fuzz, normally in the form of a Stealth Bond One-Liner. For example, Simon Pegg and Timothy Dalton have a stand down in a small model town. The pun? This town isn't big enough for the both of us.\n\nAlso lampshaded when a swan causes the villain to crash his car during his escape. with this exchange:\n\nI guess you could say it was his swan song.\n\nWhen Larry finds what he needs to place in the action figures inSmall Soldiers, he triumphantly exclaims, \"Hello, Mr. Chips!\"\n\nThe Blues Brothers has a stealth pun in the White Supremacist Rally scene. The Rally speaker refers to their party as the American Socialist White People's Party, or, if you were to initialize it, ASWPP. The neo nazis are ASsWiP(P)es.\n\nJokes[]\n\nThere are a number of riddles of the form \"What's the difference between a X and a Y?\" where only the first half of the punchline is ever given, to avoid speaking profanity. Suffice it to say there are many half-punchlines with the word cunning in them, followed by a word that rhymes with hunt and doesn't start with the letter C.\n\nWhat's the difference between (annoying female celebrity) and the Panama Canal? Well, the Panama Canal is a busy ditch ...\n\nWhat's the difference between a smart midget and gonorrhea? A smart midget is a cunning runt ...\n\nWhat's the difference between a tailor and a bad viola player? Well, the tailor tucks up the frills...\n\nWhat's the difference between a chiropodist and a bad drummer? Well, the chiropodist bucks up the feet...\n\nWhat's the difference between a clever spoonerism and a fart? One's a shaft of wit...\n\nWhat's the difference between an epileptic corn farmer and a prostitute with diarrhea? One of them shucks between fits...\n\nWhat's the difference between a rooster and a lawyer? One of them clucks defiance...\n\nWhat's the difference between a baby and a high-school choir director? The baby sucks his fingers...\n\nWhat's the difference between a pickpocket and a peeping tom? The pickpocket snatches watches...\n\nWhat's the difference between Barnum & Bailey's Circus and a line of Playboy bunnies? The circus is a cunning array of stunts...\n\nWhat's the difference between a woman in church and a woman in a bathtub? The woman in church has hope in her soul...\n\nWhat's the difference between a snake and a goose? A snake is an asp in the grass...\n\nWhat's the difference between you and a mallard with a cold? Well, one's a sick duck... I forget the rest Trebek, but your mother's a whore.\n\nWhat's the difference between the manager of Barclays having a fight and Inspector Fowler having a conversation? Well, one's a warring banker...\n\nLiterature[]\n\nOne example in Mistborn, although it might have been accidental. Mistborn, coinshots and people with hemalurgic steel augmentations tend to use metal objects like small-denomination coins as bullets. The smallest denomination of coin in the mistborn verse is known as a clip (also a term for a self-contained unit of ammunition).\n\nThere's another example which is clearly intentional this time. Aluminum is allomantically inert so wearing aluminum around your head protects you from allomantic abilities that affect emotions. So don't forget your foil hat.\n\nDiscworld\n\nIn The Wee Free Men, a talking toad is introduced as a guide for Tiffany Aching. Although it was explained that said toad's yellow colour was caused by his being unwell, nobody ever actually told her to \"follow the yellow sick toad\". As the author said:\n\nThis was played as a straight Pun in Moving Pictures, where a man in half a lion suit says \"I don't know what it's called, but we're doing one about going to see a wizard. Something about following a yellow sick toad.\"\n\nSimilarly, in Jingo, when Carrot is investigating an attempted political killing with strong similarities to the Kennedy assassination, he interviews a gnoll. In addition to being an informant, the creature has plants growing on it. That's two possible routes to the phrase \"grassy gnoll\", but it never happens.\n\nThe worst offender has got to be Soul Music. There's a scene where the main character, Imp Y Celyn, explains his name: imp being a term for new growth at the end of a stalk, and celyn being a member of the holly family. The entire book is full of music puns like that, some more subtle than others. Of course this is made even more obvious when he starts going by the name Buddy.\n\nOr possibly his band-mate, Lias Bluestone, who changes his name to Cliff. The fact that one of the band's songs is \"Sto Helit Lace\" suggests that he's supposed to represent J. P. Richardson Jr. AKA \"the Big Bopper\".\n\nLater on in the book, the Dean of UU spends several scenes constructing an elaborate coat. Later, Death, knowing that some things have to look right, borrows it before going very quickly to an important place. When he gets there, he kills The Music. None of this is ever spelled out.\n\nThe Dean also spends a lot of time riveting trousers out of denim. The Archchancellor complains, and the Dean replies that soon everyone will be wearing them, and they certainly won't be called Archchancellors.\n\nThere was a more obvious pun than that there.\n\nOne of the bands manages to acquire a leopard, which is a bit hard of hearing.\n\nThe band names are full of these. Consider, for instance, the opposite to \"We're certainly Dwarves\".\n\nDon't forget Death riding to the rescue on a motorcycle, which turns ghostly as parts break off... meaning that by the end, he's hitting the highway like a battering ram on a silver-black phantom bike. (Like a Bat out of Hell...)\n\nPlus, the motorcycle was built in the basement, so Death gets it out of the building via the ceiling... through the ground above.\n\nAnother scene mentions a great musician, who was a priest that robbed a temple (a felonious monk, if you will).\n\nIn Witches Abroad, there are a couple of puns where the first two witches give an outright pun or Allusion but Nanny Ogg delivers the stealth pun.\n\nThe three of them are deliberating on the idea of a transport system built on broomsticks. Their ideas for names are puns on well know real world airlines but Nanny Ogg gets cut off before she says hers. However, note she is looking at Magrat and being rather coquettish. Consider Magrat's role in The Hecate Sisters trio. Virgin.\n\nIn a later scene, while stuck in a Wizard of Oz parody, Magrat and Granny have a falling out. As they walk along the obligatory yellow brick road, Magrat says \"some people\" need a little more heart, Granny Weatherwax says \"some people\" need a lot more brain, and Nanny Ogg, both literally and figuratively stuck between the two, thinks to herself that she needs a drink. i.e., Dutch Courage [2]\n\nFollowed not long afterwards by a farmhouse falling on Nanny Ogg, and then some rather confused dwarves who want to have Nanny's red boots.\n\nThere's also a recurrence of Granny trying to tell a joke about an alligator sandwich (\"...and make it snappy!\"), but she keeps blowing the punchline (\"...and do it fast!\").\n\nIn Pyramids, a voting system involving each elector placing round beads into a jar is described as giving rise to a popular saying about politics. Presumably that it's a load of balls.\n\nI always thought that was a reference to being blackballed.\n\nOr it could just be \"-insert party here- has no balls.\"\n\nI always thought that this one was a simple reference to the Athenian practice of doing basically just that.\n\nSybil in Guards! Guards!: \"Lord Vetinari seldom had balls. There was a popular song about it, in fact.\"\n\nIn Going Postal, John Galt Captain Flint Reacher Gilt dresses up as a pirate and has a parrot sitting on his shoulder that continually shouts \"twelve and a half percent!\" Twelve and a half is 100 divided by 8, or, in other words, one Piece of Eight, which is the traditional coinage that all pirates are after, and \"Pieces Of Eight!\" was the Catch Phrase of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island.\n\nThe Last Hero includes some pages that are excerpts of fictional documents. One of these is a list of \"Varieties of the Swamp Dragon\". One of the listed varieties is the \"Nothingfjord Blue\", which is given this description: \"Wonderful scales, but a tendency to homesickness.\" In other words, it's pining for the fjords.\n\nIn Night Watch, Dr Lawn briefly refers to \"the founder of my profession, the philosopher Scepturn.\" Since this is obviously the Disc version of Hippocrates, the highly cynical Lawn has presumably taken the Sceptic Oath.\n\nThe Guild of SeamstrWHORESLadies of Negotiable Affection (pre-legalization and renomination) employed Dotsie and Sadie, known as the Agony Aunts since that's what they inflict on badly behaving customers. Now say their names the other way round.\n\nIn British English, an Agony Aunt is an advice columnist.\n\nIf you swap Dotsie and Sadie around and drop the \"ie\" you get Sad-Dots or Sadists.\n\nMight be overthinking, but in Thud!, Mr. Shine is a troll made of diamond, making him the troll king by their ancient mythology, spoilered for convenience. It would be surprising if Pterry meant this one, but would that make him King Diamond?\n\nAnother absolute genius Late to the Punchline turns up in Thief of Time. The whole way through the book it is emphasized that Susan hates nougat. The book finishes with her eating a chocolate privately in the closet. The chocolate turned out (to her dismay) to be nougat. She is then interrupted when Lobsang arrives. They kiss and the book closes with \"Even with Nougat, you can have a perfect moment.\" This line doubles in Heartwarming when you remember what Lobsang was called before he joined the History Monks' clan; Newgate Ludd.\n\nIn Unseen Academicals, a girl calls Glenda \"the leftover queen\", then thinks it might be taken insultingly and explains she meant that Glenda was very good at cooking with leftovers. Why would someone not like to be called the leftover queen? Because in the card game, the left-over queen is the Old Maid.\n\nAlso Trev Likely is a \"likely lad\" and a skilled dribbler (he works in the University candle vats before getting involved in the football). And a teddy bear with a third eye sewn on its forehead is described as \"more enlightened than the average bear\" an obvious gag on Eastern mysticism and Yogi Bear's catchphrase, but a subtler one when you remember a yogi is an Eastern mystic.\n\nThere are many in the Latatian mottoes of various families, groups, and guilds: The City Watch motto, \"Fabricati Diem Pvnc\" is translated as \"To Protect and to Serve\", but means something else: \"Make my day, punk.\" A favourite is \"Non Timetis Messor\" (if you like Blue Öyster Cult, at least). That one is translated correctly at one point, though.\n\nBecomes a minor plot-point in Feet of Clay.\n\nExplanation for non-British readers: have you ever seen one of those \"cryptic crosswords\" with the multiple-meaning clues and such? That's standard for British crosswords.\n\nThe dog-latin used in the books is bursting with such gems. When asked what \"Sodomy Non Sapiens\" means, the reply is \"Buggered if I know.\" Which is, in fact, the literal translation.\n\nIn Guards! Guards!, Vimes refers to an unusually weak beverage as \"love-in-a-canoe\" coffee. The punchline goes unsaid—it's fucking close to water.\n\nOne from Paul Kidby: his illustration of Leonard of Quirm in Nanny Ogg's Cookbook includes many Leonardo references, including the original sketch of the Mona Ogg. Another picture of the young Gytha, however, shows her lying naked on a divan, which is a reference to a completely different Leonardo.\n\nPossible one in Sourcery, when Rincewind points to his hat and says \"What does this mean to you?\" and someone else says \"That you can't spell.\" Not only is the word Wizard misspelled (there are two Z's) on his hat, Rincewind is also an Inept Mage. He... can't spell.\n\nThe protagonist of Small Gods is Brutha, a lowly acolyte who ends up reforming the warlike theocracy of Omnia and becoming its leader after a number of hardships. So he's actually a Christ analogue, but Pratchett somehow waited until Unseen Academicals to use the fairly obvious joke about the Discworld equivalent of \"Jesus Christ!\" being \"Oh, Brutha!\"\n\nThe Motto of the Quisition (said warlike theocracy) is Cvivs Testicvlos Habes, Habeas Cardia Et Cerebellvm. The loose translation is apparently \"when you have their full attention, you have their hearts and minds\", and how loose the translation is.\n\nThe Grim Reaper's main adversaries in the series are the Auditors of Realities. Which means that Pratchett is pitting against each other the two certainties in life: Death and Taxes.\n\nBesides having Death's powers, another Lamarckian inheritance Susan got was a mark on her face mirroring one given to her father, Mort, when Death hit him. This seems to be a Stealth Pun on the idea of \"hitting someone so hard their children will feel it\".\n\nOne of the creatures in The Phantom Tollbooth is the Everpresent Wordsnatcher, a bird who comes from a place named Context and likes to take words from other people's mouths and twist them. He comes this close to explaining the pun:\n\nThe book is really entirely made up of these puns.\n\nIn The Rock Rats by Ben Bova:\n\nOh for Fuchs' sake...\n\nIn Godel Escher Bach, the dialogue \"Aria with Diverse Variations\" (named after a piece by J. S. Bach more commonly known as the Goldberg Variations) mostly concerns the Goldbach Conjecture and variations on it. Near the end of the dialogue, Achilles suddenly offers the Tortoise the gift of a \"very gold Asian box.\" This pun doesn't get to sink in until after the true ending of the dialogue: a fake ending in which a cop arrives and Achilles turns the Tortoise in for the reported theft of a Very Asian Gold Box.\n\nIn The Dresden Files, there's a supporting character named Virginia, who is a werewolf. No one mentions that they are afraid of Virginia Wolf.\n\nAlso in The Dresden Files, Harry is asked to guess the name of the wizard who is the newest member of the Senior Council. His guess is \"Klaus the Toymaker.\" It is implied that Harry is not joking, but he's wrong.\n\nIn Summer Knight, we meet a very small fairy that looks to be nothing more than a spark of light. Her name? Elidee. L. E. D.\n\nNorse related characters tend to have names that are Kenning, and if you can figure it out tells you exactly who and what they are.\n\nFor instance: MonOc Securities. MonOc is a combination of words for \"one\" and \"eye;\" it didn't take the fans long to realize it was led by Odin One-Eye. And one of their employees is Ms. Gard: If you read up on your Norse Mythology, you'll know that Asgard is the home of most of the gods and location of Valhalla. She's a Valkyrie.\n\nThe Archive asks Harry to tell his kitty hello for her. This means that, had she not gone through a third party, she would have said, \"Hello, kitty.\"\n\nSwedish children's comic Bamse has an anthropomorphic wolf named Virginia. Note that you'd have to jump languages to make it work too.\n\nIn War of the Dreaming, there's a brief mention of Parliament as \"something owls do when they get together. Boring, but then it's better than what crows do.\"\n\nIn the classic Sherlock Holmes story \"The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle\", Holmes and Watson find a priceless gem inside a stolen Christmas goose, and figuring out how it got there takes them all over London. Somehow, Conan Doyle managed to resist having Watson complain about a wild goose chase.\n\nA similar situation occurs in the Dalziel and Pascoe novel A Killing Kindness where the detectives spend most of the novel after a suspect called \"Wildgoose\" who turns out to be a red herring.\n\nCombined with a Shout-Out in Randall Garrett's Too Many Magicians, in which a character named Tia Einzig learns that her uncle Napoleon has escaped to the Isle of Man. Since \"Einzig\" is German for \"solo\", this would make him Napoleon Solo, the UNCLE from Man. (For extra Shout-Out points, she learns this from her uncle's friend Colin McDavid; Napoleon's partner, of course, is played by David McCallum.)\n\nGarrett did one even stealthier in another Lord Darcy story, \"The Sixteen Keys\": a young-looking man ages abruptly when he dies, due to a magical process that spread out his aging through his entire body so everything deteriorated at exactly the same rate. The developers of the technique were Reinhard von Horst and Duivid Shea, but the story never calls it the \"von Horst-Shea\" process ... a pun on Oliver Wendell Holmes' humorous poem about \"the wonderful one-hoss shay,\" all the parts of which disintegrated at once.\n\nThe last of Patricia C. Wrede's Enchanted Forest Chronicles features a character called Daystar. Guess how he relates to the previous main characters.\n\nIn the Ciaphas Cain (HERO OF THE IMPERIUM!) novel Duty Calls, the pilot of Amberley's ship is named Pontius. Also one of the major players in the novel are soldiers from an all-female religious order based in the planet's region of Gavaronne. The fact that they are literally the Nuns of Gavaronne is never explicitly made.\n\nIn The Traitor's Hand, there is a brief mention of an animal called the nauga, whose hide is particularly useful for \"certain hard-wearing applications.\" The maker of Naugahyde fabric ran with this, selling Nauga dolls.\n\nA Civil Campaign introduces Armsman Roic, who battles against the off-planet law enforcement coming to take away Dr. Borgos. It could be said that the Armsman was acting he-Roic-ally. (This only works if you pronounce his name that way; reportedly the author Herself pronounces it differently, thus didn't see the pun coming.)\n\nThursday Next has a ton of these. The best is probably when Thurs has to remove Hamlet from his play, while in the A-plot, recurring villain Yorick is running around. You do the math.\n\nIn one Star Trek: New Frontier book (all written by Pungeon Master Peter David), a beast is described as cyclopean, with a large horn, wings, and purple fur, hunting crew members for food. Lampshaded later as one of the stalked crew members says, \"It sure looked strange to me.\" \"He was a one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater // Sure looked strange to me\"\n\nAlthough almost certainly not deliberate, the scene with Count Ugolino and Archbishop Ruggieri in Dante's The Divine Comedy has one of these. Ugolino only stops gnawing on Ruggieri's head long enough to tell Dante about the horrible way Ruggieri killed him, in effect giving the Archbishop a good chewing out.\n\nIn Harry Potter, Vernon Dursley works at Grunning Drills—or, in other words, his job is very boring.\n\nThe names of some locations in the magical world are symbolic puns, which are never mentioned or called out by the characters at all. \"Diagon Alley\" (Diagonally) was said by J. K. Rowling to reference Harry's entrance into the magical/adult world, because it was very unusual, or some such. \"Knockturn Alley\" (Nocturnally) is a dark and frightening underbelly sort of place.\n\nThere's also Durmstrang, a Spoonerism of the German phrase Sturm [und] Drang (Storm and Stress). Puns honestly seem to actually be a naming convention of the Wizarding world, they come up so much.\n\nI think it's just Jo. The extreme \"Muggle\" community where the Dursleys live is called Little Whinging, which is a pun lost to many American readers who don't know that to whinge means to complain. And all the Dursleys seem to do is complain about their neighbors, Harry, their other relatives, Harry, weirdos, Harry, work, etc. (Especially in the first book.)\n\nWell, here's a rather hidden one. The door to Dumbledore's office has the knocker in the shape of a griffin. Any one seeing the Griffin Door puns now?\n\nRedwall‍'‍s seagoing rodent villains are referred to as \"corsairs\" specifically to avoid an endless string of \"pi-rat\" puns.\n\nIn the kids' story Bee-Wigged (about a giant bee who passes himself off as a schoolboy thanks to a Paper-Thin Disguise) the main character Jerry Bee is noted to be extremely good at spelling. Which of course makes him a spelling bee.\n\nThere's a character in the Codex Alera named Rook. Rook is a watercrafter powerful enough to manage Voluntary Shapeshifting. At one point, she uses this to switch places with a member of the nobility, providing protection for the noble and increased maneuverability for herself. Rook castles.\n\nBlood Trail, the second book in Tanya Huff's Blood Books series, features Henry and Vicki protecting a family of werewolves living near London (Ontario). Not one character ever mentions Warren Zevon or his song, \"Werewolves of London\".\n\nIndeed, the working title of the book was A Canadian Werewolf in London, Ontario.\n\nOne of the Foundation short stories, \"...And Now You Don't\" / \"Search by the Foundation\", mentions that students in the Composition and Rhetoric class were required to write their names as initial-of-given-name followed by surname, \"except for Olynthus Dam, because the class laughed so when he did it the first time.\"\n\nIn Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut, boko-maru, the only real ritual of the Bokononists is described as a meeting of souls. It is performed by having the two participants remove their footwear, and then press the soles of their feet together.\n\nThe dangers of the Stealth Pun are featured in one of the Callahan's Crosstime Saloon stories, while the actual Stealth Pun is subverted through explanation; a story on Tall Tales Night is about to bomb because of a Stealth Pun that went over everyone's head, so the narrator steps in to state the pun that the pun-making Star Wars fan was O.B. Juan's kin, Obie.\n\nSpider Robinson has what many would regard as an unfortunate tendency to lampshade his Stealth Pun s. Witness the Callahan story \"Have You Heard The One ...?\", about a time-traveling salesman: the female guest character, Josie Bauer, turns out to be a time-traveler as well and mentions at one point that her father has almost finished \"the Riverworld ser — \" The narrator ends by pointedly explaining that he's not going to explain the translation of her surname. (The Stealth Punchline is, \"Have you heard the one about the traveling salesman and Philip Jose Farmer's daughter?\"\n\nIn The Day my Bum Went Psycho, it turns out the Kisser is an ass-kisser in more ways then one.\n\nIn \"Nightfall\", a short story by Isaac Asimov, an advanced society regresses to barbarism once the light from all six of their planet's suns are blocked. In other words, they enter a literal Dark Age.\n\nIn the Dragaera books, during the period where Vlad was a gangster, he had two mooks working for him known as Schoen and Sticks. Schoen means stone- thus, they are Sticks and Stones (and will break your bones).\n\nThe cellular phone implant during the Millennium in the Left Behind book Kingdom Come. It gives new meaning to the term \"a ringing in your ears.\"\n\nRecently[when?] used as a joke in the comic strip Cow And Boy.\n\nIn the Doctor Who Expanded Universe novel Borrowed Time, Rory has acquired a 51st century camera that speeds up time in a given area. The phrase \"time bubble\" is repeatedly used to describe this. The main plot involves an extradimensional stock exchange that buys and sells time, and a being who believes that she can manipulate the market by buying more time than her debtors have, as long as she can keep passing the debts on before they're called. Despite this being explicitly compared to both the contemporary financial crisis and 17th century tulipmania, the phrase \"time bubble\" is not used in this context.\n\nIn A Song of Ice and Fire, Varys refers to his spies by the nickname \"little birds\". While the name was probably chosen to reflect the saying \"a little bird told me\", no one references that in-universe. In another figure-of-speech based example, the Kettleblack brothers (as in \"the pot calling the kettle\") are scoundrels who accuse others of crimes of which they themselves are guilty. Also, it's been noted that the Kettleblacks seem to be deliberately flat characters and all around mediocre, down to having near-identical appearances and names. Notably, the initials of every Kettleblack are O.K..\n\nA Storm of Swords: Jon is an illegitimate member of the Stark family, whose sigil is the direwolf. When Jon goes undercover among the wildlings, he is forced to abandon his black cloak and is given a sheepskin cloak as a replacement. So Jon is A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing.\n\nIn Death: Nadine Furst. Why is she always first when it comes to being a reporter?\n\nIn Who Cut the Cheese? by Stilton Jarlsberg, after Ho almost gets run over by a rat in a sports car, Ho writes a warning on the wall of the maze: \"Honk If You Love Cheeses\". This alludes to Christian bumper stickers.\n\nLive-Action TV[]\n\nSince 2006 Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve has had the west coast portion that airs after midnight on the east coast hosted by Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas. In case you do not understand the pun you are traditionally supposed to eat black eyed peas on New Year’s Day to bring you good luck in the upcoming year.\n\nOverlapping with an ILP, in the Firefly episode \"Safe\", River wanders off and starts dancing—and it's stated in her backstory that she was a ballerina (Real Life Writes the Plot, Summer Glau is one). How is this a pun? Her name is River, and she is dancing. River. Dancing. Riverdance.\n\nIn the DVD's scene selection for the episode, this scene is actually called \"River Dance.\"\n\nThe Father Ted episode \"Chirpy Burpy Cheap Sheep\" is about a sheep who is being driven neurotic. There's a concealed pun implicit in this concept (and [formerly] revealed in The Other Wiki's relevant episode entry) but it is something of a subversion since neither the pun nor the punchline are actually spoken.\n\nThe famous Nantucket limerick shows up in the pilot of Babylon 5. Delenn has heard it, and thinks it's a typical example of Earth poetry...\n\nIn the B5 prequel, In The Beginning, one of the few Minbari who advocates giving peace a chance is named Lennon. (Word of God confirms that this was intentional.)\n\nMultiple human characters are cautioned not to use the phrase \"aw, hell\" while commanding a White Star, or are shown doing so. In Minbari, it means \"fire all weapons\".\n\nAnd again in this Daily Show/Colbert Report bit, as a shorter alternative to an epic poem.\n\nA variant appears in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"The Naked Now\". As the Enterprise crew succumb to an inebriation-inducing virus, Data reports picking up numerous disturbances on internal sensors, including a crewman singing a limerick:\n\nAnd speaking of TNG, there's the emotionless android Data and his more human brother Lore. This borders on Fridge Brilliance.\n\nHow about Star Trek: Voyager‍'‍s Tuvok, the black Vulcan?\n\nOne from the Pushing Daisies episode \"Dummy\":\n\nThe Colbert Report has Gorlock, a Signs-esque alien who advises Stephen on various topics. He was first introduced as Stephen's financial advisor and an excuse to make Scientology jokes, but we later find out that he's also Stephen's attorney. Making him... A legal alien.\n\nWas there ever a mention of him taking a sick day? Which would make him an ILL-legal alien.\n\nIn Veronica Mars, the late Lilly Kane called her younger brother Duncan by the nickname \"Donut\". One (admittedly cute) Fanfic posited that it was because he wanted to be a cop as a kid. Someone clearly missed the pun.\n\nThe BBC's series Merlin features King Uther. He keeps used to keep a dragon penned up in the dungeon.\n\nSherlock does not once excrete onscreen.\n\nIn Star Trek: The Original Series, Kirk claims to be from the island of Noman at one point.\n\nA famous example from Saturday Night Live‍'‍s \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" sketches:\n\nPresumably, one is a sick duck, and the other a dick-suck. That is, a Precision F-Strike.\n\nIn Reaper, the Devil gives Sam his phone number. We never see it, but Sam's reaction to the area code makes it pretty obvious it's 666.\n\nOn Mock the Week, Milton Jones comments that farmers have recently started using heroin but finding the evidence has been difficult. It's like finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nIn this Scrubs episode an imaginary patient has a kitten in his mouth. Probably he misunderstood the concept of eating pussy. Either that or the cat's got his tongue.\n\nFor several episodes of Season 4 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Oz wore a sheepskin jacket. As he's a werewolf, you know what that makes him...\n\nIn the episode \"Tabula Rasa\", Spike is being pursued by a demon he owes money to. The demon has the head of a shark. Which makes him... a loan shark.\n\nIn another episode, Spike and others are gambling with baby cats instead of poker chips. In card games the betting pool is often referred to as \"the kitty\".\n\nIn Angel, Wesley and Angel are trying to translate a passage from memory, leading to the predictable gibberish. One of the \"nonsense\" phrases they come up with is \"strangling poultry\".\n\nStargate SG-1 has the following exchange:\n\nParodied in that this is an actual conversation change because he didn't know the meaning of his name....\n\nSo when it comes to names, he doesn't know Jack.\n\nIn The Sopranos, Phil's men is hiding in Vito's motel room, where they ambush and plan to kill him due to the revelation that he's gay. Phil himself is hiding in a closet, and once Vito has been subdued, Phil reveals himself to Vito by coming out of the closet.\n\nOn Top Gear, there is a joke award for the biggest presenter error called the Golden Cock award (a small figurine of a rooster). In the 2009 Top Gear Awards, the award was given to their \"tame racing driver,\" The Stig, who refused to give it back and got quite violent when Richard Hammond tried to take it away from him. So you could say The Stig really likes the cock.\n\nCheers episode \"Little Carla, Happy at Last\": Carla finds out she's pregnant by Eddie LeBec. Worse yet, it's twins. She thinks that's bad news but the father disagrees:\n\nAn episode of Malcolm in the Middle has Dewey being menaced by a girl in his class. Reese offers to help him come up with some barbs to throw at her, and suggests finding something that rhymes with her name. Dewey says she's \"Regina Tucker\", and Reese says that isn't much to work with, but he's sure they'll think of something.\n\nLost has a ridiculous amount, if you stop to think about it. Locke—a man known for thinking out of the box—used to work at a box company. Naomi in fourth season didn't have a Ruth, making her ruthless. And in sixth season episode \"The Substitute\", Sawyer dangles for a while between the devil and the deep blue sea.\n\nDoctor Who episode \"Aliens of London\" features a pig being put into a spaceship and fired at Big Ben in order to create a fake alien invasion which will scare the populace. So the entire plan revolves around a flying pig...\n\nAnd in \"The Parting of the Ways\", the Doctor mentions the planet Barcelona:\n\n\"The Girl in the Fireplace\". The Doctor saves the day and simultaneously foils the bad guys' plans by riding a horse through a mirror. This isn't obvious at first, until he explains and finishes with \"I'm not winding you up\". Sure, it's a Britishism for \"I'm not joking\", but he's talking to clockwork, ie. windup, robots.\n\nIn \"The Curse Of The Black Spot\", the Siren disappears injured people away to a hospital sickbay. When someone requires medical attention and help is being sent, it's generally heralded by a siren.\n\nIn the Torchwood episode \"Dead Man Walking\", after learning how much it sucks to be a zombie, Owen (unsuccessfully) attempts to drown his sorrows in beer.\n\nAnd then he literally tries to drown himself.\n\nChuck's ability to access data on threats to the country is called \"flashing\". When he temporarily is unable to do so, he tries to practice, and is shown using a series of cards with images of spies on them, which are never actually called :\"flash cards\".\n\nIn \"The Great British Nightmare\" special episode of Kitchen Nightmares, Ramsay's attempts to prove a local restaurant is better than a chain restaurant are accompanied by the instrumental opening of Fleetwood Mac's \"The Chain\".\n\nTensou Sentai Goseiger‍'‍s ending song has a line which mentions Five Star. That's a possible meaning for Gosei, as used in Gosei Sentai Dairanger.\n\nIn Supernatural, we get a quick scene of the producer of a movie named Jay talking on the phone to a man named Bob. We never hear Bob's side of the conversation.\n\nA possibly unintentional one from Coupling: Jeff has brought up the question of what would happen if breasts were given the power of independent thought, suggesting that \"similar people in similar jobs, working in the same bra,\" wouldn't get along. Patrick suddenly comes up with an idea for a new porn film about battling breast-brains and spends the rest of the episode suggesting titles, including Wobble Wars, Two Minds, One Bra, The Girl with Two Brains (\"Three brains, Patrick!\") and The Girl With Two Breasts which Steve calls the stupidest title yet. At no point does anyone suggest the obvious pun: Bra Wars.\n\nNot \"Bra Fight\"?\n\nOne episode of Smallville is all about nightmares. Every single song in the episode is by REM Another has a story where Lionel drove his wife insane — it ends with him listening to Madame Butterfly.\n\nArrested Development at one point had Henry Winkler walking along a dock, and had to take a bit of a leap to get past a cartilaginous fish that was lying there.\n\nA Getting Crap Past the Radar example- Lindsay has done a Cheek Copy and shows Michael a picture of that, thinking it's a picture of a car she wants to buy. Michael replies that what she showed him isn't a picture of a Vol-vo (it's a picture of her vulva).\n\nHow I Met Your Mother had an episode where Ted was lecturing his class about the work of an architect who had died midway through his work, leaving it unfinished, and repeating the word \"unfinished\" until the word lost all meaning. The background music? Schubert's Unfinished Symphony. Might double as a Genius Bonus.\n\nOne of the main characters is Marshall Erickson, a law student (and later a full-fledged lawyer). Incredibly, in six seasons, this pun-loving show has yet to make a joke about Marshall law.\n\nActually, Marshall himself made that joke in the episode where he found out he had passed the bar. Literally, ten seconds later.\n\nFarscape has Rygel, a deposed king who has a tendency to release farts similar in effect to helium. Should I really point out that helium is a noble gas?\n\nGlee‍'‍s episode \"Furt\" revolves around Finn's mother and Kurt's father marrying, making them into a family. Finn gives a speech in which he says that, as they're together, they should have a portmanteau name (no); they are now \"Furt\". Left unsaid is that, as of their families joining, they're Kin(n).\n\nThe very name of Dexter Morgan is most likely a Stealth Pun, given that it's Latin for \"right.\" The corresponding term for \"left\"? Sinister.\n\nAdrian Monk (notice the last name) is an OCD-ridden detective, making him a Creature of Habit.\n\nThe Cold Case episode \"Beautiful Little Fool\" opens with the 1929 New Year party in a mansion. In the next scene, one of the attendants is dead. It turns out the killer worked as butler in said mansion, meaning The Butler Did It.\n\nIn the first season of Burn Notice, Michael adopts the persona of good ol' boy Homer to repo a boat. He's working for a man named Virgil.\n\nIn the Forest Dragon part of Dragons: A Fantasy Made Real, there's a confrontation between the dragon and a tiger. While the tiger is crouching around, the dragon is hiding in the forest trees. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\n\nIn the fourth-series Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch \"A Doctor,\" a doctor hands a questionnaire to a patient bleeding profusely (where his nurse stabbed him) and gives him failing marks for wrong answers (correct answers include \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"the Treaty of Versailles\"). He never says he's giving his patient an exam.\n\nIn the Degrassi franchise, nobody ever called Mr. Raditch \"Radish\" until JT and Liberty in his actor's last episode on the show.\n\nIn an episode of Red Dwarf, Lister suggests a game of squash with Rimmer's light-bee, a device which flies around and projects his holographic image. Squash is a game played with a small hollow ball. Hollow, holo...\n\nDavid Letterman did something along these lines when he gave a list of the top ten Bill Clinton jokes. He never actually got to the punchline, he just would trail off and look at the audience, who could figure it out for themselves and were hysterical by that point.\n\nConan O'Brien on Late Night, doing one of the 'cat is to kitten, what dog is to puppy' routines:\n\nMusic[]\n\nIn the song \"Necessity\" from Finian's Rainbow, the lines quoted below provoke the shouted question \"Do you mean he's a --?\", which is answered in the affirmative (the implied statement being that Necessity is a bastard):\n\nIt also seems to be a stealth pun on the saying \"Necessity is the mother of invention.\"\n\n\"Girl Anachronism\" by The Dresden Dolls: about a girl who blames her constant sickness on having been born too soon by C-section. Including the line \"You can tell (...) that I'm not right now at all.\"\n\nDuring his polka medley \"Polka Face\", \"Weird Al\" Yankovic breaks into an accordion solo immediately after the \"Break Your Heart\" section. The obscure song is actually an instrumental version of the \"Tick Tock Polka\" originally done by polka-meister Frankie Yankovic (no relation). Appropriately enough, this leads directly into his version of Ke$ha's \"TiK ToK\".\n\nThe cover of REM's Life's Rich Pageant is a Visual Pun: It's a collage depicting band member Bill Berry and a pair of bison... as in \"Buffalo Bill\".\n\nThe textless cover of The Pixies' \"Gigantic\" single is a photograph of a crying naked baby, while the back cover has a picture of a driving glove laying on the ground. This may seem like a True Art Is Incomprehensible sort of thing, until you realize it's actually a play on a potential Mondegreen of the song: \"A baby glove\" instead of \"A big, big love\".\n\nThe real name of 2D, lead singer of Gorillaz, is Stuart Pot, a.k.a. Stu-Pot. He spent some time in a coma. At least one fanfic, but nobody in the canon, has pointed out that this would make him a vegetable Stu.\n\n\"Flowers On The Wall\" by The Statler Brothers: \"Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty-one.\" The narrator's missing one card... he's not playing with a full deck.\n\n\"Mother Superior jumped the gun...\" A nun jumps the gun. Well, it's a stealth rhyme, anyway, a sort of wordplay.\n\nThe Divine Comedy song, \"The Complete Banker\", which is about the role of the banks in the current recession. From his point of view, he's a complete banker, but we'd rather call him a complete wanker.\n\nThe main chord sequence for ACDC's \"Long Way To The Top\" is A, C, D, C.\n\nThere's a Linkin Park song called \"Cure for the Itch\", which is instrumental and performed solely by Joe Hahn, who plays turntables. He's scratching.\n\nMac McAnally's \"Back Where I Come From\":\n\n\"Rollin' (The Ballad of Big & Rich)\" by Big & Rich has two. The first is \"Charley Pride was the man in black / Rock & roll used to be 'bout Johnny Cash\", and the other is \"I'm a crazy son of a {{[[[Sound Effect Bleep]] bad word}}] / But I know I'm gonna make it big and rich\".\n\nThe Rush song \"Roll the Bones\" deals with questions of existence and causation in a funkier style than the band's usual prog-rock fare. In other words, it's existential funk.\n\nNewspaper Comics[]\n\nThis [dead link] Mallard Fillmore strip. The punchline sounds almost like a parody of his usual Strawman Political rants; eventually someone figured out it's a Stealth Pun. (Because NASCAR fans are \"race-ists\".)\n\nA late 2009 Housebroken strip had DJ Dog mentioning his plans to expand his empire. His plans include a line of handbags called DJ Doggie Bags, a soft drink called DJ Doggie Dew, and a fashion and lifestyle magazine called DJ Doggie...Fashion Magazine. Maya says she can't think of a better name for the last one without them getting cancelled.\n\nFoxTrot sometimes has the characters making references to Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity being on TV—which of course means that the Fox family is watching Fox News.\n\nDilbert: Man, does Scott Adams love this.[context?]\n\nPrint Media[]\n\nOne issue of Private Eye, covering the scandal after Jacqui Smith's husband used her expense account to buy adult films, ran with the joke \"At least he's not a banker!\", the unspoken pun being that he is however (literally) a wanker.\n\nPrivate Eye also often refer to themselves as an \"organ\". On the obvious level, it's a pun on the fact that the eye is an organ, the Stealth Pun comes in with the fact that this then makes them a \"Private Organ\".\n\nStealth Running Gag—A Private Eye Caption Competition photo showed Chris Woodhead (former Chief School Inspector, who had a relationship with an ex-student) and a teenage girl looking at a large book. The winning caption was \"Look, there it is, next to Kenya.\" - the suggestion being that they really were discussing Uganda.\n\nPuppet Shows[]\n\nOn Eureeka's Castle the character Batley wore big glasses and crashed while he landed from flying. Playing on the phrase \"blind as a bat\"\n\nOne episode of The Muppet Show opened with the Bug Band, a group of four insects, singing \"She Loves You\". Backstage after the song, Kermit says that the group needs a name and instead of the obvious suggestion they come up with The Who and The Grateful Dead.\n\nIn the \"Bear on Patrol\" segments, Patrolman Fozzie Bear's superior officer is Link Hogthrob, a \"pig\". Think about that for a second.\n\nThe Muppet Christmas Carol. In order to get both Statler and Waldorf into the movie, they had to invent a brother for Jacob Marley. They called him Robert. Think about that for a second. Get up, stand up...\n\nLampshaded somewhat in a vintage Sesame Street short where Kermit the Frog reports live from the court of Old King Cole, just as he's about to call for his pipe, his bowl, and his fiddlers three.\n\nAnother episode has Elmo leading the children in a game about who can cry the loudest.\n\nRadio[]\n\nFrom The Very World of Milton Jones:\n\nThe correct punchline is, of course, \"the deputy head\".\n\nRecorded and Stand Up Comedy[]\n\nDane Cook: Rough Around the Edges gives us this gem: \"You know what'd suck? Being the guy who played the flute. That had to blow.\"\n\nA somewhat well-known joke concerns a pair of hikers who die while rock-climbing. As their souls ascend to heaven, they see a pair of eagles and exclaim, \"Ah, eagles!\" The eagles, to be polite, say nothing.\n\n\"Ah, souls!\" (Say it out loud. Works best with a British accent.)\n\nAnother variation involves a flounder and a sole who bump into each other on the bottom of the ocean. Same punchline.\n\nIn Crazy with a Capital F, Dan Cummins talks about an ant infestation he once had and says he imagines that all ants speak with a British accent. It's because they colonize. Well, it was a stealth pun until he explained it.\n\nTabletop Games[]\n\nProbably unintentional, one would note that the bishop in a game of Chess moves diagonally, or to use another word crosswise.\n\nIn Warhammer 40,000, the Chaos god of anger, rage, and bloodlust has demonic servants called Flesh Hounds. Or, in other words, Khorne dogs.\n\nGame author Robert M. Schroeck has admitted to burying jokes into all of his books for GURPS, starting with the parent group to the titular Superhero organization in 1990's GURPS International Super Teams: The United Nations Committee on Law Enforcement (U.N.C.L.E.).\n\nTheater[]\n\nThe Bible: The Complete Word of God (abridged):\n\nIn Of Thee I Sing, in the Senate scene, the Senator from Massachusetts rises to demand a governmental pension for Jenny, Paul Revere's horse. Another Senator points out that Jenny died in 1805, and after an observed minute of silence the matter is declared finished. To put it literally: it's a dead horse.\n\nIn the English translation of the French play Tartuffe, which is not a direct translation (the lines rhyme in both versions) we get this after Elmire convinces Orgon, her husband and the head of the household, that Tartuffe is evil, so that he will not entrust him with the family's fortunes. She finally convinces him that Tartuffe is corrupt by seducing him while Tartuffe is under a table, and he must believe her. Later, he tries to convince his mother:\n\nThis changes based on the performance.\n\nToys[]\n\nEjector, a transforming toaster from the Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen toyline, is a small toaster with a maxed out Courage rating.\n\nIn the Ninjago LEGO sets, the blue ninja's name is Jay which makes him a Blue Jay, like the bird.\n\nSimilarly, Hero Factory has Julius Nex, who is orange. Orange Julius is a drink brand.\n\nThe Beyblade sub-line \"Stealth Battlers\" includes the clock-themed Tempo Hammer Hit. Hammer time.\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nIn Half-Life 2, Dr. Kleiner's pet headcrab is named Lamarr, and later confirms the pun when he can't find it.\n\nThat's Hedley!\n\nThe exact same gag was used in Camp Lazlo.\n\nThere's another one, maybe. \"It's spawning season for the antlions!\" And they do indeed spawn. And spawn, and spawn... They're the only enemies in the game that do, in fact.\n\nIn case 2 of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Trials & Tribulations, a valuable jewel is called the \"Tear of Emanon\". If you don't get it, read it backwards.\n\nIn the third case, the murder victim was a computer programmer working for a company called Blue Screens. The phrase \"blue screen of death\" is never used.\n\nMaya comments that it \"sounds like a really stable company\".\n\nThe final case features two characters using false names with the surname \"Deauxnim\". Considering the series' love of Punny Names, it's quite surprising that neither is called \"Sue\".\n\nThe character's name in Japanese is also a Stealth Pun: her pseudonym is \"Elise\", but her real name is \"Maiko\" (one translation of which is \"dancer\").\n\nThe Ace Attorney series is famous for giving the characters incredibly punny names. Like Shelly de Killer, the assassin who leaves cards with the images of shells at the scene of the crime to draw suspicion from his clients. The killer with the conches.\n\nOne potentially obscure pun can be found in the name of Max Galactica, the magician Phoenix defends in the third case of Justice For All. Max is particularly fond of milk, and needs it to calm his nerves before a performance. How many players realize that the word \"galactic\" is defined as pertaining to milk in the first place?\n\nIn Ace Attorney Investigations, it's eventually revealed that the Yatagarasu's Key has a handle that opens up to reveal a concealed knife blade. They key part has a bit shaped like a butterfly, and the way the handle opens makes it a literal butterfly knife.\n\nThe second game's third case introduces us to Acro's pet monkey Money, who has a tendency to steal and stockpile shiny objects. While this causes Phoenix some early grief, the other members of the circus seem to be used to it and regard it as a harmless prank... or monkeyshines.\n\nNo points for guessing which animal is featured on the coat of arms of Aswan in Crusader Kings by Paradox Interactive. A lion.\n\nNot a swan?\n\nIt's a Stealth Pun that's subverted by a deeper Stealth Pun. Whoa.\n\nAt the beginning of the second episode of Tales of Monkey Island, Morgan tells Guybrush how much she admires him, and says she even learned how to hold her breath for five minutes. Guybrush informs her he can hold it for ten. \"You mean that's true? I thought the stories were exaggerated! Impressive!\" So in her opinion, reports of his breath...\n\nIn Kingdom Hearts II, Namine tells Kairi at one point to \"Believe in yourself\", whilst trying to convince her to step through a dark portal. If you don't get it, remember that Namine is Kairi's Nobody.\n\nAlmost certainly unintentional, but a large element of the plot of the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog is Princess Elise's budding romantic feelings for the titular anthropomorphic hero. Thus making her a fur Elise.\n\nThe head of Pokémon's mafia-esque Team Rocket is named Giovanni, making him Don Giovanni.\n\nAlso, Spoink and Grumpig are pig-like creatures adorned with pearls. Pearls Before Swine?\n\nPokémon Black and White introduces the ability Big Pecks, found on seven Unova birds and four pre-existing Dream World birds, which makes them immune to defense loss. The \"pecks\" bird reference is immediately apparent, but you may not know that the original Japanese name for the ability translated to \"Pigeon Breast\". So it really means they have big pecs. Groan.\n\nSpeaking of Unova, Zekrom, the Legendary Mascot of White, not only has a domain over electricity and lightning, but also has large thighs. It has thunder thighs, get it?\n\nThe most powerful axe in most modern Castlevania games is the Golden Axe. In Dawn of Sorrow, Yoko is able to make said weapon even more powerful by combining it with a boss's soul. Specifically, she adds Death.\n\nThere's also the enemy in Order of Ecclesia known as the \"Chosen Une.\"[3]\n\nA particularly dark one in Empire: Total War, in which you get different trade resources from different trade ports- sugar from South America, spices from the East Indies, and ivory from Africa. However, that sure is a lot of ivory, considering the profit to be made... and then you realize it's a reference to Black Ivory.\n\nIn Thief: Deadly Shadows, one mission requires you to break into a clock tower operated by the Hammerites (colloquially, the Hammers) and sabotage the mechanism, causing the clock to stop. In other words, you have to Stop Hammer Time.\n\nIn Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, there is a character named Broque Monsieur who speaks with a heavy French accent and is made out of blocks. If you try saying his name with a fake French accent, it sounds like you're saying \"block monster\".\n\nOr, of course, Mr. Block.\n\nThat's also a normal Punny Name; it refers to a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. If you add a fried egg to the top, you get a Croque-madame. Hee...\n\nOf course there's also a Madame Broque, his ex.\n\nAlso in that game, the villain Fawful, who is from the Beanbean Kingdom, has a pig henchman named Midbus, making them pork and beans.\n\nMidbus also has spikes down his spine so he's also a razorback and when he gets ice powers he can give Bowser a cold. A little coincidence with a recent[when?] panic.\n\nIn Mass Effect, when accessing a computer system in a trashed laboratory, the computers personality asks you: \"It looks like you are trying to restore this facility. Would you like help?\"\n\nOne response option is labeled \"Crap. A pop-up\"\n\nIf you buy the Collectors' Edition of Mass Effect 2, you get some extra content: namely suit of armour and a rifle modelled after those of the Collectors, the chief enemy in the game. Note the apostrophe.\n\nQuarians bear the name of their home ship in their names preceded by the preposition 'vas', which can be somewhat embarrassing if the ship name is ridiculous, as is the case with Admiral Zaal'Koris vas Qwib Qwib. If you ignore Tali's advice and ask him about the name, he'll mention that he's considered transferring to the Defrahnz or Iktomi.\n\nIn Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, one of your last tasks is to explore the derelict vessel Valhalla to obtain a \"pirate code\" that will grant access to one of the enemy's leviathans. But the only reason you need it is so that the leviathan can plot a course for you and the Federation fleet to follow to Phaaze, the living Phazon planet. So when you think about it, the pirate code is really more like a guideline...\n\nSamus manages to kill a B.O.X. security robot infected by the X parasites in Metroid Fusion. If you've been paying attention to the naming scheme for X victims, this makes it an \"X-B.O.X.\"\n\nNot really, since X is always used after the name; Core-X, Serris-X, Yakuza-X, SA-X... It would make the infected robot B.O.X-X.\n\nGuilty Gear XX has two characters with connections to each other named Eddie and Venom. Would you believe that one of them is a black shape-changing symbiote who combined with a human and went on to control his body?\n\nThat's subtle?\n\nConsidering that the symbiote is the one named Eddie...\n\nIt's still not the least bit subtle.\n\nThat Zato-1 is the name shown on the character selection screen for the first games with Eddie in, and that he appears to be more a batwinged demonic figure and Venom is a pool cue wielding Egyptian assassin with long purple hair over his eyes, kinda obfuscates the pun a bit too and makes it more stealthy.\n\nAlso, the number \"1\" in Japan is pronounced \"Ichi\", thus making him Zato-Ichi\n\nBrütal Legend features a demon named Fletus who's obsessed with cars and racing. No-one mentions that this makes him a speed demon.\n\nOr that if he ever got more than one, he'd have a fleet of cars.\n\nDitto for Glottis from Grim Fandango.\n\nIn Katawa Shoujo, the protagonist Hisao is hospitalized after a confession of love provokes his arrhythmia and gives him a heart attack. The girl in question eventually breaks ties with Hisao, which is one of the many reasons he's depressed at the start of the game. In other words, Hisao's got a broken heart.\n\nLilly Satou, who is blind, says \"I don't see why it matters\" when asked to make a name for her team in the fishing competition. Keep in mind that people often say things such as \"I see\" around her, only to sheepishly apologize, and she is amused by their apologies.\n\nIn Team Fortress 2, one of the Demoman's unlockable weapons is the Eyelander, a big Scottish BFS. Since it's a Scottish BFS, that makes it a claymore. However, there's more than one type of weapon called a claymore. The aforementioned type of sword, and a kind of bomb.\n\nHe's a black Scotsman. Black Angus.\n\nDo not forget the line \"DON'T RUN! IS JUST HAM!\" when eating the Sandvich (a ham and/or baloney sandwich) as the Heavy, a character who is extremely boisterous and over the top.\n\nAnd the Sniper's camper van. A \"camper\" in FPS terminology is a guy who rarely moves from one particular spot to kill people. Which is something snipers usually do.\n\nThe bobble head in \"Meet the Sniper\" that he pretended to headshot was originally of an old man holding a bottle of apricot jelly, a reference to the part of the brain often called \"the apricot\" by snipers, but they decided against it because it was so obscure.\n\nThat didn't stop them from giving him apricot air freshener\n\nThe Sniper's parents apparently live on \"Adelaide St.\" which is in itself a reasonable name for a street, but Australians joke that the city of Adelaide only has one street anyway.\n\nSimilarly, the \"Meet the Engineer\" video has him sitting at a campfire. Guess what one of the main Engineer strategies is.\n\nThis is actually a double stealth pun. Take a closer look at his 'campfire.' It's the burning corpse of the Sniper. So the camper is using a camper as a campfire.\n\nThe \"Mann-Conomy\" update was announced with a letter from Saxton Hale explaining how he discovered the Internet, in which he also notes that \"the perverts at AnagramYourName.com should be ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES.\" (\"Saxton Hale\" is an anagram of \"hot anal sex\".)\n\nSo...is that the reason his products are known to spontaneously combust at random, and his top customers happen to be ill-tempered assholes that really like big guns?\n\nProbably unintentional, but in old Irem arcade game Ninja Spirit you control a ninja named Moonlight. He can create up to three shadow clones which follow his every move. Moonlight Shadow!\n\nEither that or He's being followed by a Moonshadow.\n\nNezumi Man has Milky Nezumi, who doesn't attack with dairy products (like Butter Nezumi), but stars. In case you're wondering, he named himself after our resident galaxy.\n\nPaper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has two in the gameplay mechanics. The first is Ms. Mowz's standard attack, a slap that ignores enemy defenses, and the second is the fact that machine type enemies are easy to freeze with ice attacks, (one of the hints old Wonkey tells you).\n\nWhen tattling one of the harder enemies in the X-Naut base, the X-Yux, Goombella informs you that its name is properly pronounced \"Cross-Yux\". This in itself doesn't reveal a pun, but instead results in two when you combine this logic with the rest of the base's denizens. First, the X-Nauts, who would be properly pronounced \"Cross-Nauts\". Noughts and Crosses. And second, their computer TEC, which is a shortened form of its proper name TEC-XX. Double Cross.\n\nSaid computer is found in a base on the moon. Considering what game this is, would make it a paper moon.\n\nThe text-based game Scapeghost has you as detective Alan Chance killed during an undercover drugs operation and coming back from the dead to take revenge. You are literally the Ghost of A. Chance.\n\nBackyard Sports: Duksana Pond.\n\nThe newest Touhou game, Double Spoiler, is another camera-based Gaiden Game starring the reporter Aya Shameimaru. Given how much fans love Aya, one has to wonder why? Well, it's been joked that Aya is ZUN's girlfriend. And ZUN is apparently aware of this, because he's releasing Double Spoiler on White Day, i.e. the day that boys give gifts back to their girlfriends to thank them for the Valentine's Day chocolate.\n\nFrom Viewtiful Joe 2: The Black Film.\n\nSheep Man from Mega Man 10. He's an electric-themed robot master.\n\nSome fans, not content with this explanation of Sheep Man's name, have noticed that his stage is set inside a computer, and computers of course have RAM.\n\nIn the same vein, Mareep, Flaaffy, and Ampharos are Electric-type sheep Pokémon.\n\nFrom Metal Gear Solid:\n\nThe joke is, this conversation takes place over codec. Meryl is, in fact, green. Just like everyone else.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater brings us several stealth puns on the subtitle \"Snake Eater\". \"Operation Snake Eater\" is the codename of Snake's mission, and codenames tend, by their natures, to be stealth puns on the mission's objective. In this case, it is either that Snake was going to have to eat the native wildlife to survive or that he was sent to assassinate the leader of the Cobra Unit.\n\nSnake was also a Green Beret before joining FOX, and \"snake eater\" is a military slang term for Green Berets.\n\nIf Snake eats a snake and then calls Para-Medic, she won't call him a \"snake eater\" but instead a \"cannibal\".\n\nIn a later cutscene, Snake cooks a snake over a fire and then eats it.\n\nThen there's the stealthiest use of the pun - Ocelot's favorite animal according to the database is a Markhor, which in Persian means \"snake eater\".\n\nThe American release date of BlazBlue: Continuum Shift is July 20, roughly 19 days after the Japanese release. 7/20. As in the 720 degree motion required for Iron Tager's Genesic Emerald Tager Buster distortion drive. REAL SOVIET RELEASE DATE!\n\nThe main characters of Mega Man ZX start out delivering packages. Consider the pronunciation of the game's name in British English, and think of a famous company name that rhymes with it.\n\nWhile he was reverse-engineering the Wii's architecture, Segher discovered that the Hollywood processor (officially the graphics processor) contains a tiny ARM core in addition to its normal ATI core.[4] Since it wasn't documented anywhere (not even in the developer's guide!) it didn't have a name, so he nicknamed it \"Starlet.\" Because it's a little piece of Hollywood.\n\nIn the seventh Fire Emblem game, three Pegasus Knight sisters share similar names. The first two, Florina and Fiora, are Latin words for \"flower,\" while third sister Farina's name means \"flour.\"\n\nIn Red Dead Redemption, a high-stakes poker game in Mexico results in several people pointing their guns at each other. Someone notes that \"There must be a name for this.\"\n\nBanjo-Tooie has one that can spawn two stealth puns: One move Banjo learns, Snooze Pack, has him fall asleep inside his backpack to recover health. Thus literally making his pack a Nap Sack or a Sleeping Bag.\n\nThe general of the Cornerian forces in Star FOX is named Pepper. Which means he had to have been a sergeant at some point in the past.\n\nNot really as enlisted men and officers are on separate pay grades, but that just ruins it doesn't it?\n\nLong before the N64 version, the Nintendo Power comics (which promoted the then-recently released Super NES game) actually incorporated this pun into one chapter.\n\nIn EV Nova, there is a ship called the Cambrian. Some historically-inclined gamers like to call it the Prince of Wales.\n\nIn Mega Man Zero, Zero can divide enemies if you deal the final blow with a bladed weapon.\n\nThe Fable series has monsters called Hobbes. They're nasty, brutish, and short.\n\nVery near the end of Professor Layton and the Unwound Future, you discover that the London of the future is actually the London underground. Not phrased like that, so...\n\nRatchet from Ratchet and Clank is a mechanic. Ratchet is also the name of a socket wrench. Furthermore, Ratchet's ears are shaped like the head of a standard wrench.\n\nThe final level of Mario Zone (where the levels are inside a giant mechanical Mario) in Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins has a lot of (suspiciously Lego-like) bricks. The level apparently takes place in the Mario-bot's head. So the Mario-bot is a blockhead.\n\nAnother level has a lot of what seem to be rubber balls - and considering this level is set in Mario-bot's crotch...\n\nIn Left 4 Dead 2, Whitaker's gun shop from the first campaign is running a 2-for-1 special for 9mm pistols.\n\nIn the second campaign, you visit a theme park with a nut theme. The character on the hammer-bell game is named Mustachio. The game never mentions what kind of nut he is. He's a pistachio.\n\nIn Lunar Knights, Perrault is an antagonist who keeps confronting Aaron and Lucian with her mobile ship Schrodinger. It is only later that the player finds out that Perrault is a cat.\n\nIn Fallout: New Vegas, you can recruit the cyberdog belonging to The King, leader of the gang, The Kings. The dog's name is Rex. Rex's personal quest involves replacing his aging brain. One of the candidates for the transplant? A dog named Rey. Rex is Latin for \"king\". Rey is Spanish for . . . you guessed it! \"King\".\n\nThough possibly unintentional, Fallout: New Vegas is often abbreviated as \"NV.\" Much of the game takes place in Nevada. What's the US Postal Code for Nevada? NV.\n\nA nice Stealth Pun gives the town of Novac its name. The town is built up around a prominent hotel (of which we are unaware of the real name) and a large, partly working neon sign outside the hotel entrance tells us the hotel has \"No Vac ancy\"\n\nIn Minecraft, all monsters of a particular type share the same behavior patterns, often leading to the player being ambushed or chased by several enemies at a time. The common term for an NPC among the Minecraft community is a shortening of \"mobile entity\": mob.\n\nMobs are actually a generic term for mobile entities for any MMORPG. Sure enough, it's rather easy to get mobbed by mobs in most of them.\n\nCreepers have an irritating habit of hiding behind corners, under ledges, and outside doorways to ambush the player.\n\nCreepers have a mottled green texture that, at a distance, can cause one to mistake them for cacti or the tops of trees. The word \"creeper\" can also refer to various plants.\n\nChibi-Robo! features a beautiful princes"
