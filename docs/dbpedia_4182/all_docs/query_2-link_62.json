        "text": "(Citrus County, FL) Yesterday, January 18, the Citrus County Sheriff's Office (CCSO) hosted the Florida Sheriff's Association (FSA) Regional Task Force Summit. Seven sheriffs, members of their staff, and representatives of the FSA attended the summit to discuss recent deployments to gauge what has worked and how each region can improve its capabilities.\n\nWe live in an all-hazards state. Thanks to the mutual aid agreement, when a natural or man-made disaster impacts an area, a Sheriff from that region can request assistance from other Sheriff's Offices through the FSA. During storm recoveries, task forces, like CCSO's Sheriff's Mutual Aid Response Team (SMART), can provide immediate services that aid in daily operations. These services ensure the citizens of that region can continue to receive adequate public safety services to protect their lives and property while beginning recovery efforts.\n\n\"We've learned over the past few years that when the unexpected comes along, it can happen to any county in Florida. None of us can do it alone, and it's important to know that you can count on your fellow Florida Sheriffs for help,\" said FSA President Sheriff Bill Leaper from Nassau County. \"I want to thank Sheriff Prendergast for hosting this meeting and showcasing the equipment that will be used as we respond quickly and safely to affected areas, helping citizens receive the assistance they need.\"\n\nThe FSA Task Force is divided into seven regions. Recently, CCSO was selected to maintain the Region Four Disaster Base Camp for lodging personnel during mutual aid missions. FSA furnished our agency with the first of many planned base camp set-ups, which include two large inflatable tents, cots, portable air conditioners, bathroom trailers, a water trailer, generators, and a mobile kitchen.\n\nCCSO utilized the set-up in August of 2023 when Hurricane Idalia made landfall in northwest Florida as a category four hurricane with sustained winds of 125 mph. Just hours after Hurricane Idalia struck, CCSO efficiently deployed 18 deputies, who were part of SMART, to Dixie County with all our new assets.\n\n\"This is personal to me; 2018 Hurricane Michael, a major category five hurricane, struck Bay County. I can't tell you how it felt to have our community destroyed and then have over 600 sheriff deputies respond from throughout the state into our community to help us, so it is an honor for me to serve on the task force,\" said FSA Task Force Chairman Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford. \"We have received gracious support for the task forces, and we're working to have base camps like this stationed at various areas throughout the state because it's important when we respond to a disaster that the sheriff's offices coming in are self-supporting and have a place to stay and feed their people, so they don't become a further burden on the requesting community.\"\n\nDuring the morning's news conference, Sheriff Ford announced that the FSA Shared Assets Committee is working to purchase a second base camp and that they aim to start supplying smaller counties that cannot be self-sustainable during a disaster with the equipment.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's about excellence in public safety – Plain and simple,\" said CCSO Sheriff Mike Prendergast. \"Each member of each sheriff’s office within the FSA took an oath to protect and serve, and when our neighbors need help, we will be there, gear in tow, ready and willing to help in any way necessary. Thankfully, because of our state's past amazing leader's forethought, we can sleep soundly knowing that if we need any aid, our FSA partners have our backs.\"\n\nThank you to Nassau County Sheriff Bill Leaper, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford, Highlands County Sheriff Paul Blackman, Columbia County Sheriff Mark Hunter, Indian River County Sheriff Eric Flowers, Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden, FSA System Coordinator Eric Owens, FSA Law Enforcement Coordinator David Brand, and FSA Public Safety Coordinator Steve Cole for attending and contributing to these important discussions.\n\nAbout the FSA Task Force: The FSA Regional Task Force comprises CCSO and 66 other sheriff's offices, divided into seven regions and headed by a Chair who is the Sheriff of a county in the region. Citrus County is in Region Four, encompassing Citrus, Sumter, Hernando, Pasco, Hillsborough, Pinellas, Polk, and Hardee counties. Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast is the Region Four Chair.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Earlier this month, Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) Animal Control Officers (ACO) responded to a residence on East Watson Street in Inverness in reference to an animal cruelty investigation that resulted in the arrest of three residents.\n\nImmediately upon arrival, ACOs noticed a strong odor of animal feces and ammonia outside of the residence. ACOs made contact with 23-year-old Chelsea St. Hilaire, who advised there were three dogs living on the enclosed patio and an additional three living inside her residence. Once ACOs and deputies entered the residence, they found multiple piles of garbage bags mixed with animal feces and urine inside the bathroom. Multiple soiled diapers and empty liquor bottles were scattered throughout the bedroom. Inside the kitchen, ACOs found stacks of dirty dishes and two buckets with mold growing inside of them. Throughout the entire home, the floor was spongy and caked with feces, and multiple holes were observed in the ceiling.\n\nAs ACOs continued their investigation, they discovered two juveniles were living inside, one of which was crawling on the ground. Multiple cats were found roaming inside the house but were able to come and go through windows. An additional dog was found inside the home that was not originally disclosed. There was little food and zero sources of water for any of the animals – most dogs also had missing patches of fur due to fleas.\n\n“The condition of this home was so disgusting that deputies and ACOs could not take a single step without their boot touching feces, urine, or both,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “No child or animal should ever have to experience living conditions such as this. I am thankful for the partnership between our team and the Citrus County Animal Shelter for saving these innocent young children and animals who cannot speak for themselves.”\n\nThe two juveniles were immediately removed from the home – further charges are pending regarding the children. A total of seven dogs were removed from the home, as well as the cats roaming near the residence. All were taken to the Citrus County Animal Shelter to be cared for by the county veterinarian.\n\nThe following individuals were arrested and charged:\n\nChelsea St. Hilaire (2/10/2000) – 7 counts of animal cruelty;\n\nRobert Brooks (7/11/2000) – 7 counts of animal cruelty;\n\nTina Maddox (8/26/1956) – 7 counts of animal cruelty.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) In light of our recent operation, Operation Lucky Strike, which was a strategic, undercover internet operation to apprehend dangerous, cyber predators, we are sharing this vital information. Our High Tech Crimes Unit Detectives have deemed the below applications the top 10 apps parents should be aware of based on a higher likelihood of abuse.\n\nYou probably hear that these apps can be dangerous, and brush it off, but just last week during our operation we arrested 11 child predators who were utilizing these same apps to solicit minors. These applications continue to be virtual interstates for online predators to gain access to our youth. Predators know how easy it is to get online and start chatting, so monitor access as much as possible.\n\nTop 10 apps to watch for:\n\nSnapchat lets users take and share photos & videos. App settings will also allow people to see your location.\n\nTikTok lets users create and share short videos. There are very few privacy controls available, so it is not hard for your kids to discover explicit content.\n\nOmegle is an online chat that allows users to socialize with strangers worldwide without needing to register an account. It randomly pairs users with one-on-one, anonymous chat sessions.\n\nKiK allows users to send an array of multimedia messages through a Wi-Fi connection and engage in live video chats.\n\nRoblox is an online game with a chat feature that includes profanity, sexual content, drugs, and more. The age range of gamers varies widely.\n\nDiscord is an instant messaging app where users have the ability to chat via voice/video calls & text messages privately.\n\nInstagram is a social media platform that hosts a sheer amount of inappropriate content that users can access without having an account.\n\nWhisper is an anonymous social network that lets users share secrets with strangers. The secrets are created by typing words onto images.\n\nWhatsApp is a messaging app that allows texts, video calls, photo sharing, and voicemails with users worldwide. It is a cross-platform IP service owned by Facebook.\n\nVault App is a password-protected app that hides private files such as videos and photos behind a functioning calculator app.\n\n“Parents, remind your children that they should only chat with those online that they truly know, and especially never give out personal information online like addresses, phone numbers, or personal photos,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “I recommend that you sit down with your child and talk to them about the potential dangers of the internet, social media, and online games.”\n\nParents, please pay attention to these potentially harmful apps and talk to your children about what they can do to stay safe online and avoid lurking dangers such as an online predator. For questions about internet crimes or to report an internet crime, please contact our office at (352) 249-2790.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Earlier this month, Andrew Ezekial Lynch (D.O.B. 10/05/1989) of Crystal River was convicted for production of child pornography. Lynch was sentenced to serve a total of 29 years in prison, plus an additional 20 years of supervised release, by U.S. District Judge John L. Sinatra, Jr.\n\nBetween May of 2017 and May of 2018, Lynch contacted five different female victims ranging from 13 to 17 years old through Facebook Messenger using several different fake accounts.\n\nIn 2017, Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) High Tech Crimes Unit Sergeant Tiffany Barry received various tips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and discovered all of the messages were coming from the same I.P. address in Crystal River. Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) detectives began their investigation finding multiple juveniles were contacted by Lynch and coerced to send sexually explicit photos and videos.\n\nDetectives discovered that Lynch threatened the minor victims by claiming he would send their explicit photos and messages to family or post them publicly if they didn’t continue talking to him. CCSO detectives then made contact with Lynch at his residence. Lynch advised he had no social media accounts, including Facebook, and denied ever making fake accounts online.\n\nIn a later interview at CCSO’s Emergency Operations Center, it was found that an individual, who was previously a resident of Lynch’s home, was having several of his old Facebook photos used on the fake accounts used to talk to the victims. These photos ranged from ones taken while the individual was only 15 years old, up to ones taken in his early twenties. The individual stated he did not know who would be using his photographs to message juveniles but advised he would not communicate with someone who was under-aged. Following this interview, CCSO’s case was adopted by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) who was also looking at Lynch for similar crimes. The FBI charged Lynch for the crimes he committed involving these minor victims.\n\n“Yet another repulsive child predator has been taken off of our streets and put behind bars. The disgusting actions of Andrew Lynch show just how dangerous these perverted individuals can be, threatening several juveniles by using social media as a weapon,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “My team is dedicated to safeguarding our youth and will remain committed to apprehending predators like Lynch. Thank you to our persistent detectives, Captain Brian Spiddle, and our federal partners for their collaboration and tireless work in this case.”\n\nIf you suspect someone is committing crimes against our youth, call (352) 249-2790 to immediately report your suspicions to our office. Or download the Sheriff’s App (search Citrus County Sheriff’s Office) to use the ‘Submit a tip’ feature to make a report instantly.\n\nCCSO App users can look up Sexual Offenders in their area by clicking on the ‘Sexual Offenders’ feature, which will show a photo of the offender, their name, physical descriptors, address, and your approximate distance from their location.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) The Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) is constantly recognizing and celebrating the accomplishments and fierce dedication that our team exemplifies. Last week, we hosted an awards ceremony to commend the remarkable actions of our personnel. During this ceremony, we presented ‘Of the Year’ awards to four devoted professionals in their respective categories: Deputy Sheriff, Communications Officer, Civilian, and Volunteer. These individuals go above and beyond their duties and exhibit extraordinary professionalism in their work achievements every single day. Those given this distinguished award exemplify our agency’s core values of ‘Integrity’, ‘Service Above Self’, and ‘Loyalty Above All’, and are committed to providing excellence in public safety.\n\nThe Civilian of the Year was awarded to Mr. Dave Harvey in recognition of his exemplary performance of duties and service to our mission throughout the year. He has assisted in bringing the highest level of training and education to our agency members, helping to improve and maintain their knowledge and skills of vital lifesaving techniques. Dave’s recent involvement in facilitating and coding the programs necessary for our recent Motorola CAD transition was instrumental to our agency, where he kept vital operations running.\n\n“Dave Harvey has helped his team in an immense way by sharing his years of experience to teach his fellow colleagues and advance our operations,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “While converting over to a new Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system to better serve our community, Dave played a crucial role in ensuring the smooth transition of our critical infrastructure. Congratulations to Dave Harvey for receiving the ‘Civilian of the Year’ award!”\n\n(Citrus County, FL) The Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) is constantly recognizing and celebrating the accomplishments and fierce dedication that our team exemplifies.

Robert has embodied the role of a communications officer throughout his consistent display of patience with callers facing dangerous situations. His thoroughness in collecting pertinent information for deputies and fire rescue responders has proven to be invaluable in the case of several calls for service handled by our agency. Additionally, Robert played an instrumental part in the Motorola Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) transition through his efforts in building the ‘CAD View’ program. This program required a significant time commitment and expertise in SQL and SSRS coding languages. Robert’s involvement was imperative to keeping critical operations for emergency services running smoothly throughout his significant transition.\n\n“Mr. Robert Hayden was an important asset to our Communications team during a difficult and lengthy transition to a new computer-aided dispatch program, all while providing premier service to our citizens,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “I want to extend my gratitude to Robert for his commitment to serving our community and ensuring Citrus County stays safe.

Deputy Ritli played a vital role in our agency by training with other School Resource Deputies (SRD), thus ensuring our team maintained excellence in various areas. CCSO especially wants to give recognition to Deputy Ritli’s actions as an SRD at the CREST School. Another instance highlighting the excellent level of care Deputy Ritli holds for his students is when a student confided in him that Christmas would be challenging for their family due to financial constraints. Deputy Ritli took it upon himself to organize a fundraiser and provided the student and their mother with an all-expenses paid trip to Universal Theme Park. The level of care and support provided by this law enforcement professional, not only to his students but also to his fellow deputies, serves as an example to all.\n\n“Deputy Ritli is a prime example of a law enforcement professional,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “I am extremely proud of the dedication Deputy Ritli exhibits every day. This is a well-deserved recognition, and he is an integral part of our team. Congratulations to Deputy Ritli on being recognized as ‘Deputy Sheriff of the Year’!”\n\n(Citrus County, FL) The Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) is constantly recognizing and celebrating the accomplishments and fierce dedication that our team exemplifies.

Don started with our agency as a volunteer in 2019 and has investigated over 800 cases, working countless hours communicating with victims, financial institutions, and coordinating with other agencies to combat the effects of fraud in our community. In 2022 alone, Don investigated 222 fraud-related cases for Citrus County citizens and provided assistance and closure to them while still acting as an invaluable asset to our detectives in the Major Case Section. Don’s professionalism and selfless service in lightening the burden on our detectives not only allowed them to focus on urgent outstanding cases but also ensured that the cases he took were still received with the same exact attention and high level of care as our high-profile cases. Don is a true resource and an integral part of the Sheriff’s Office, and the time he has volunteered to help us work toward our mission is essential.\n\n“Mr. Don Dittemore has been a substantial help to our agency, eager to show up to assist our community every day,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “Our agency is extremely grateful to have Don as a teammate and I couldn’t be prouder to have him represent all of the astounding work that our volunteers do. Congratulations to Don Dittemore for receiving the ‘Volunteer of the Year’ award!”\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Citizens were warned the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) would not tolerate any form of malarkey when it comes to traffic safety over the Saint Patrick’s Day weekend. Sadly, not everyone heeded our warnings and several vehicle operators were witnessed driving under the influence by our Traffic and Patrol Units.\n\n“Driving while under the influence of any substance is reckless behavior. It is simply selfish to risk not only their lives, but the lives of countless innocent people by getting behind the wheel,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “I am beyond disappointed in those choosing to operate a vehicle while under the influence. Our units will continue to be on the roadways protecting our community from their careless decisions by targeting those who make these selfish decisions.”\n\nLast weekend, CCSO joined Operation CARE (Crash Awareness and Reduction Effort), led by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), in an effort to increase officer presence on Interstate and U.S. Highways across the nation during specific high crash periods.\n\nAs part of this operation, our agency took to the streets of Citrus County alongside our partners at the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP). We conducted 75 traffic stops, which resulted in four DUI arrests (one by FHP) and a total of 74 traffic citations being issued.\n\nThe following three people were taken into custody for DUI by CCSO:\n\nMichael Steven Shafer, 30, of Crystal River, was pulled over after failing to stay in his lane of travel, almost hitting multiple vehicles. His bond was set at $1,000 per the bond schedule.\n\nChristopher Mark Parreault, 56, of Inglis, was stopped after deputies observed his vehicle make multiple traffic infractions. His bond was set at $1,000 per the bond schedule.\n\nStephen Anthony Rivera, 51, of Inverness, was failing to stay within his designated lane of travel when deputies activated their overhead red and blue emergency lights, Rivera instead of pulling over, lead deputies on a brief pursuit where he continued to swerve in and out of lanes, before he stopped to let a passenger out along the side of the road, and sped off again. The passenger alerted deputies that Rivera was “heavily intoxicated.” Rivera then continued to flee at reckless speeds, conducted multiple U-turns, came within feet of ramming a patrol vehicle, and almost hit multiple other vehicles in the area before finally coming to a stop and being apprehended.\n\nOperation or not, CCSO is dedicated to keeping intoxicated and erratic drivers off our roadways. While our actions may not always be visible, our dedicated team is always out in full force to ensure the safety of our motorists and community.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) April 9th through April 15th marks National Public Safety Telecommunications Week, an opportunity to recognize and honor our committed Communications Officers for their tireless dedication to public safety. These heroes are the calm voice on the other side of the phone when our citizens call for help during an emergency and are the connection between Citrus County residents and Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) deputies, firefighters, and paramedics. From being the initial first responder relaying instructions and critical information to callers until help arrives, our Communications Officers are there to offer aid, guidance, support, and comfort every step of the way.\n\n“Our remarkable Communications Officers at CCSO are of considerable importance and are the heroes who answer the call. I am extremely grateful for all of our Communications Officers and their unmatched professional service to the citizens of Citrus County,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “These remarkable professionals play an invaluable role in protecting our front-line responders and their unmatched ability to remain the calm voices of reason in the most chaotic of situations is critical to the daily operations of CCSO in attaining our vision to make Citrus County the safest community in Florida.”\n\nIn 2022 alone, CCSO’s Communications Officers processed 84,339 emergency calls and 187,108 non-emergency calls. Whether a citizen is calling 9-1-1 for an emergency, or ringing our non-emergency line for information, reporting a crime tip, or calling for another non-urgent matter, our Communications Officers are there 24/7, 365 days a year to pick up the phone and assist our citizens. Equipped with information to help those involved in ANY type of emergency, CCSO Communications Officers go through some of the most extensive training in the industry, ensuring the best service possible.\n\n“Our Communications Officers are the first responders to so many emergencies,” said Communications Manager Mike Story. “Their quick thinking and efficient responses are life-saving during some of the most chaotic moments when help is needed most. They are the unsung heroes behind the scenes and their dedication and commitment to the public is commendable. Their tireless efforts to keep the public safe and secure are appreciated more than they could ever know.”\n\nAt any given time, our agency has an average of 8 individuals working in our communications center. This includes those professionals answering the call, transcribing vital information during the call, and dispatching emergency services – every single role is essential in providing excellence in public safety to our citizens.\n\nCCSO is thankful not only this week, but every single day for our exceptional Communications Officers.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Please join the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) and Sheriff Mike Prendergast in extending our sincerest gratitude for the outstanding work and dedication the members of our Animal Control Unit contribute to our mission.\n\nApril 9th through April 15th marks National Animal Care and Control Appreciation Week, where we take the time to highlight the amazing contributions of our Animal Control Officers (ACOs) and their superior commitment to protecting our animal residents in Citrus County.\n\nAs heartbreaking as it is, Citrus County is no stranger to animal abuse. Thankfully, our team is out there responding to calls for service concerning animal well-being. Animal Control Officers respond to a multitude of calls, from loose animals to noise complaints and, of course, welfare checks on animals when someone calls in concerned about their level of care.\n\n“I am thankful for our dedicated Animal Control Officers and everything they do to help protect the lives of helpless animals,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “I am grateful for our employees and the Citrus County Shelter staff as well, who ensure we have a safe place to bring these animals after they are removed from egregious conditions. This teamwork goes even further than a safe space for the animals; thanks to both our ACOs and other sheriff office staff, we have successfully charged multiple offenders, saving countless innocent animals from deplorable lives.”\n\nA fine example of this teamwork can be seen when reviewing Jason Munn’s case. Munn attempted to relocate animals in his possession by surrendering 14 dogs to the shelter, three of which showed signs of long periods of neglect. Subsequently, Munn was arrested last year, and this February, he was sentenced to 9 years in prison for 21 counts of aggravated animal cruelty charges. Munn will also serve a 12-month period of home confinement, undergo mental health treatment, and never own an animal for the rest of his life.\n\nThis past year, our Animal Control team was able to put together an unprecedented number of criminal cases to hold errant pet owners responsible for abusive and neglectful environments they created for their animals. Because of their pursuit of excellence and dedication to care for all kinds of animals, they ended up doubling their numbers from 2021.\n\nSome of these cases, such as the take-down of multiple cock-fighting rings, even extended beyond Citrus County borders reaching as far as the Philippines. Altogether, they were able to rescue 396 animals from disgusting, inhumane conditions, offering them the opportunity to thrive in safer conditions elsewhere.\n\n“I just want to take a minute to applaud the most dedicated and hard-working team around,” said Animal Control Unit Supervisor Lora Peckham. “I’m so proud to be a part of this team and am so grateful to work with our amazing ACO volunteers. Thanks to each and every one of you for continuing to focus on helping animals and being the voice of those that can’t speak!”\n\nPlease join our office in offering our sheer appreciation for the outstanding members of our Animal Control Unit and all they do.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Last week, the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) Marine Unit partnered with the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in a two-day training to strengthen Search and Rescue (SAR) efforts in our county’s waters. Nearly 25% of Citrus County is made up of various waterways, to include various rivers, canals, lakes, and the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of this, it is essential our marine deputies have a complete understanding of the best practices to locate an overboard individual.\n\n“We are proud to be able to provide this hands-on crucial training for our marine deputies in the event we experience a real-life scenario or are called to assist another agency,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “As a member of the Regional Task Force, one of our Marine Unit’s prime responsibilities is to be of aid to our counterparts during an urgent situation. This training establishes that our team is well-prepared and experienced during a situation where every second matters.”\n\nDuring any SAR effort, CCSO teams up with the USCG to deploy methods such as the Victor Sierra Model, Creep Model, and the Expanding Square Model to rescue an individual as quickly as possible. Following these methods increase the likelihood of our deputies locating an overboard individual within those critical first couple of hours. These SAR methods render a customized search pattern based on a variety of conditions, like water currents and wind force, that profoundly influence the displacement of an overboard person.\n\nThe first day of training included mapping and practicing these models. The second day of training included a simulation of an overboard individual using a 5-gallon bucket with a life preserver, which is equivalent to a 180-pound individual. Our Marine Unit was able to utilize those SAR models to successfully locate the simulated overboard individual.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Today, the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) partnered with several other crucial organizations in our county to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season. CCSO’s Emergency Management (EM) Division conducted a table top exercise at our Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to ensure agencies such as the Department of Health, Citrus County Fire Rescue, the Clerk of the Court, local utilities, and Citrus County Transit know what to do in the event of an emergency activation.\n\n“I am proud that our EM Division is able to host this crucial training every year, and provide a significant amount of educational material and knowledge during this informative exercise,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “Unfortunately, Citrus County is no stranger to hurricanes and other severe weather, so it is pivotal that our county partners are prepared for this inevitable situation. I am excited to see that so many county organizations joined us during this event, and I know that this group will be able to handle anything that comes their way.”\n\nCCSO’s EM Division directed this annual exercise in collaboration with various agencies in Citrus County. During an actual activation, the EOC is operational 24/7 to ensure our citizens can stay updated with the latest information on how to stay safe in the event of an emergency such as hurricanes and other severe weather. Activations take place in the EOC ‘War Room,’ which facilitates an ample amount of room for over 60 county professionals to gather and disseminate important information to each other and the public.\n\n“Today’s exercise was about readiness! It was an opportunity for our emergency partners to strengthen capabilities in the event we are impacted by a hurricane. Even though the focus was a hurricane, we cannot forget that we live in an ‘All Hazard State,’” said Emergency Management Director Chris Evan. “It is incumbent on all residents to prepare now for natural or man-made disasters, as they can happen at any moment. I am so thankful for the dedicated professionals who participated, and I can say we are blessed as a county to have them.”\n\nThis tabletop exercise aimed to educate the group on how to handle large-scale emergencies that affect our county, such as hurricanes, through mock-scenario activities. This included practicing timely communications in support of situational awareness and operations that may affect our community and enhance participants’ ability to effectively communicate and work with other Emergency Support Function (ESF) individuals. Participants were also able to enhance their ability to anticipate needs or resources prior to official requests.\n\nThank you to all of the amazing organizations that joined us today!\n\nCenter for Independent Living of North Central Florida\n\nCitrus County Board of County Commissioners\n\nCitrus County Clerk of Courts\n\nCitrus County Department of Health\n\nCitrus County Department of Transportation\n\nCitrus County Fire Rescue\n\nCitrus County Libraries\n\nCitrus County Schools\n\nDuke Energy\n\nFlorida Department of Health\n\nFlorida Department of Law Enforcement\n\nHCA Citrus County Sheriff's Office\n\nHernando County Emergency Management\n\nNature Coast Volunteer Center\n\nSECO Energy\n\nThe Salvation Army\n\nWith the start of hurricane season a month away, now is the time to assess potential risks to your home or business & mitigate against costly impacts.\n\nFind out what types of water & wind hazards your area is prone to on our website at www.sheriffcitrus.org or on FloridaDisaster.org/PlanPrepare with the Florida Division of Emergency Management.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Last week, Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) deputies and Animal Control Officers (ACO) responded to a residence off East Yale Lane in Hernando following a call for service requesting a well-being check on the animals located at the home. CCSO ACOs have been monitoring this residence for several years – which is also the location of a local ‘animal shelter,’ Critterville.\n\nUpon arrival, deputies and ACOs were led to the backyard, where they discovered several dirty sheds and enclosures where most of the animals were housed. As deputies and ACOs investigated the area, they noticed a strong odor of ammonia and found urine-soaked floors, overflowing litterboxes, and fecal matter scattered across nearly every surface. Several cats were extremely sick and covered in fleas with urine and feces matted into their fur. Upon opening one cage, ACOs found a cat that was assumed to have been deceased for multiple days.\n\nFollowing the investigation in the backyard, CCSO officials moved to the patio, which was also cluttered with debris and extremely small cages containing five dogs. Next to these cages, officials located a refrigerator filled with rotten food and dead maggots. When ACOs opened the freezer door, they discovered two blankets wrapped around a large item and zip-tied shut – when opened, they found two deceased cats.\n\nInside the home, officials initially located several more dogs and cats with oily, matted fur and covered in fleas. Most of these animals were sick with numerous other medical issues. When led to a room in the back of the house, thirteen more cats were found covered in fleas.\n\n“It’s disturbing to see animal abuse and neglect cases in Citrus County – this is an inexcusable act. This so-called ‘shelter’ is undeniably repulsive to see,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “I am proud of our ACO team for vigilantly following up on this case and thankful for our partnership with the Citrus County Animal Shelter. These teams work endlessly to assist these helpless animals and provide them with the proper care that they deserve.”\n\nAll animals at the residence were seized by CCSO ACOs and transported to the Citrus County Animal Shelter for evaluation. A total of 42 animals - 35 cats and seven dogs - were rescued from the residence. 56-year-old Lisa Bennett was placed under arrest and charged with 39 counts of animal cruelty and four counts of aggravated animal cruelty with a total bond of $47,000.\n\nAnimal Control Officers are available to respond to routine calls for service between 8:00 am & 8:00 pm every day of the week, including holidays. Emergencies are responded to 24 /7.\n\nRequests for service should be made to CCSO Communications Center at 352-249-2790 or simply by dialing 9-1-1.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Shortly after 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, May 2, 2023, members of the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) Tactical Impact Unit (TIU) and members of SWAT responded to a residence off of North Brutus Ave. in Dunnellon to serve a narcotics search warrant.\n\nUpon arrival, deputies gave instructions for all occupants of the home to exit the residence to execute the search warrant. After a brief period of time, deputies located two subjects who were then detained for the remainder of the investigation. Those subjects were identified as 35-year-old Cameron Richard Bosley and 32-year-old Alissa Paige Harding.\n\nWhile searching the home and two other structures located on the property, deputies located 211 plants and 12 pounds of dried and processed cannabis bud, for a total combined weight of 68 pounds. Officials also seized a small amount of MDMA, various drug ledgers, scales, baggies, and a large quantity of cultivation equipment.\n\n“Although activities like selling marijuana or even owning a grow house may be legal in other states, let this serve as a reminder that they are NOT legal here in Florida,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “My team and I will not tolerate any kind of illegal drug being trafficked in Citrus County. We will treat this unlawful act the same as any other drug activity by making every effort possible to put a stop to it. I am extremely proud of our TIU and SWAT members for successfully putting an end to yet another criminal scheme.”\n\nThe following arrests were made as a result of this search warrant:\n\nCameron Richard Bosley, DOB 08/20/1987, charged with\n\nTrafficking in Cannabis\n\nSell/Manufacture/Possess with intent to Sell/Manufacture/Deliver a Controlled Substance\n\nPossession of a Controlled Substance (MDMA)\n\nOwn/Lease/Rent a Structure with knowledge to traffic a controlled substance\n\nPossession of Manufacture/Cultivate/Grow/Plant paraphernalia for a controlled substance\n\nObstruction of a lawful search warrant\n\nTotal bond $39,000 – Bond set at NONE due to violation of felony probation\n\nAlissa Paige Harding, DOB 10/17/1990, charged with\n\nObstruction of a lawful search warrant\n\nTotal bond $1,000\n\nAbout the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office’s Tactical Impact Unit:\n\nThe Tactical Impact Unit responsibilities include narcotics investigations, street-level reverse stings, regular checks for narcotics in schools and traffic interdiction. The unit coordinates and assists other organizations and departments in combating street-level drug crimes. The unit’s detectives identify, investigate, and infiltrate street-level to mid-level narcotics dealers and their organizations within Citrus County. They work closely with other units within the Bureau of Special Investigations as well as local, state, and federal authorities.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Last night, Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) deputies responded to a 9-1-1 call referencing a home invasion at an occupied home in Crystal River. Upon arrival, one of the victims told deputies that they heard a noise coming from the bedroom. When they went to inspect the noise, they saw two unknown individuals – one of which was armed – in the hallway, later identified as Ryan Wainwright and Cameron Ingram.\n\nWainwright demanded the keys to the victims’ vehicle while Ingram pointed a gun at another resident who was sleeping. Once Ingram obtained the keys, he gave them to Wainwright, who then exited the residence to start the vehicle. The awake victim attempted to leave the residence on two separate occasions but was stopped by Wainwright, who directed that victim to sit on the couch. The suspects also took both victims’ phones before fleeing the residence. Once the suspects were gone, both victims went to a neighbor’s residence to call 9-1-1.\n\nShortly after the two suspects departed the residence, deputies were able to quickly locate the vehicle stopped on the side of the road with two male occupants inside. When deputies activated their emergency lights, the suspects immediately fled in the stolen vehicle, crossing North Suncoast Boulevard before crashing into the woods. Both suspects exited the vehicle and fled into the woods on foot. CCSO’s Air Unit was deployed to assist in locating the suspects, who were subsequently spotted in a nearby river. The Air Unit observed both suspects exit the river, remove their clothes, and make another attempt to hide. Additional units responded to the area and converged on both sides of the river, where they located both suspects hiding under a floating dock.\n\n“It is exceedingly disappointing to see two individuals at such a young age committing crimes such as the ones in this case. These two juveniles ran away from their homes, caused us to spend valuable time and resources looking for them, and then turned to unconscionable felony behavior towards innocent citizens,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “I am proud of my team’s rapid actions in tracking down these individuals and putting an end to their criminal behavior before they caused any further harm to anyone else.”\n\nAll items stolen by the suspects were subsequently recovered. Ryan Wainwright and Cameron Ingram were arrested and transported to the Department of Juvenile Justice in Ocala.\n\nRyan Thomas Wainwright, DOB 5/27/2006, charged with\n\nHome Invasion Robbery (with firearm)\n\nFalse Imprisonment\n\nGrand Theft Auto\n\nGrand Theft (more than $750 less than $5000)\n\nBattery on a Person 65 Years of Age or Older\n\nResist Law Enforcement Officer without Violence\n\nFlee and Elude Law Enforcement\n\nCameron David Ingram, DOB 2/08/2007, charged with\n\nHome Invasion Robbery (with firearm)\n\nAggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon\n\nGrand Theft Auto\n\nGrand Theft (more than $750, less than $5000)\n\nResist Law Enforcement Officer without Violence\n\nLeaving the Scene of an Accident\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Earlier this month, the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) Behavioral Health Unit (BHU) partnered with Citrus County Fire Rescue and Zero Hour Life Center to engage individuals who are currently without housing.\n\n“Being homeless, no matter how long the duration, is a life-altering event that creates stress in a person’s life. Often, navigating or having an understanding of the various resources within the community can be challenging,” said BHU Sergeant Montgomery. “Our BHU plays a vital role within the community by removing barriers, bridging gaps, and connecting individuals to the appropriate resources they need to live a healthy life.”\n\nMembers of this collaborative group met with approximately fifteen individuals in Homosassa and provided them with everyday necessitates such as water, snacks, hygiene products, and pet food. Each individual was also supplied with Narcan.\n\n“I applaud the efforts of these organizations working together for a unified cause,” said County Administrator Steve Howard. “They are making a positive difference in Citrus County.”\n\nThe supportive team also informed the group of community resources and treatment options for substance use disorders.\n\n“CCSO’s BHU was established in October of 2020 and has done outstanding and noteworthy work for our community in such a short period of time,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “I am extremely proud to see this unit working with our community partners to provide assistance in our community. This unit is momentous for our community. I am eager to see what the future holds for our Behavioral Health Unit.”\n\nAccording to the Florida Coalition to End Homelessness, Florida has the third-largest homeless population in the United States. To reduce the number of individuals facing housing challenges in Citrus County, our BHU will continue to work collaboratively with our community partners, like that of Citrus County Fire Rescue, to address the needs of individuals who are here to help.\n\n“We hope this collaboration will continue to impact our community and residents in a positive manner,” said Fire Chief Craig Stevens.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health or needs assistance with finding resources, please contact our Behavioral Health Unit at (352) 249-2790.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Today, June 8, 2023, Colonel Justin Ferrara graduated as a member of the 286th session of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Academy.\n\nThe FBI National Academy (FBINA) is one of the premier law enforcement training programs in the world. Only 1% of the world’s law enforcement personnel ever get the privilege of attending this prestigious program. The FBINA was established in 1935 to provide advanced investigative, management, and fitness training to senior law enforcement officers who are proven leaders within their organizations. The graduation ceremony was held at the National Academy in Quantico, Virginia, earlier this morning.\n\n“I congratulate Colonel Justin Ferrara on his significant achievement in graduating from the FBI’s National Academy,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “His dedication, commitment, and hard work have paid off, and we are all incredibly proud of his accomplishment. He is ready to embrace new challenges and opportunities, and continue his drive for excellence in all that he does. I have no doubt that Colonel Ferrara’s leadership skills will continue to thrive and make a positive impact here in our community.”\n\nInternationally known for its academic excellence, the National Academy offers ten weeks of advanced communication, leadership, and fitness training. Participants must have proven records as professionals within their agencies to attend. On average, these officers have decades of law enforcement experience and usually return to their agencies to serve in executive-level positions.\n\nThe 286th session consists of 238 law enforcement officers from 47 states, 25 countries, five military organizations, and six federal civilian organizations.\n\nColonel Ferrara is a graduate of Lecanto High School. He holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Florida. Throughout his career in law enforcement, he has garnered an impressive list of accomplishments and has been instrumental in the development of new units, policing strategies, and innovative processes to better serve the citizens of Citrus County.\n\nCongratulations to Colonel Ferrara and his fellow graduates on this accomplishment!

Johnson exited the vehicle carrying what appeared to be an AR-15 style rifle and knocked on the door of a camper while shouting \"Citrus County Sheriff's Department,” according to victims. The rifle was later identified as an “Air-soft” rifle.\n\nWhile pointing the weapon at the victims, Johnson demanded that they exit the camper. Believing Johnson was an armed law enforcement officer, they complied. Once outside, Johnson kept both victims together at gunpoint.\n\nThe female victim attempted to call 9-1-1; however, Johnson took away the phone. While Johnson was distracted, the male victim ran to the nearest home for help, and noticed Selvog sitting in the driver seat of an SUV parked near the road.\n\nJohnson chased after the male victim and kicked in the door of the home the victim entered. Once inside, a fight between the victim, the homeowner, and Johnson ensued. The homeowner disarmed Johnson and struck Johnson’s in the head with the buttstock of the weapon. Johnson and Selvog then fled the property.\n\nSheriff’s Office personnel located Selvog at another residence, who disclosed Johnson was hiding in a nearby shed. Deputies found Johnson, who was holding a gun to his head. After failed attempts to gain compliance, K-9 Deputy Elias released K-9 Odie to apprehend Johnson. As K-9 Odie grabbed Johnson, he positioned his gun underneath K-9 Odie's chin and pulled the trigger.\n\nWhen the gun malfunctioned, he reloaded the gun and pulled the trigger again. After the second malfunction, the deputies moved in and gained control of Johnson.\n\nAfter receiving treatment at Oak Hill Hospital for injuries, Johnson was charged with:\n\nHome invasion robbery while armed;\n\nTwo counts of kidnapping to commit a felony;\n\nBurglary of a dwelling while armed;\n\nAggravated assault on a person 65 years of age or older;\n\nAggravated assault with a deadly weapon;\n\nHinder, delay, or prevent communication to law enforcement;\n\nImpersonating law enforcement;\n\nBattery on police canines;\n\nResisting law enforcement without violence.\n\nSelvog was arrested and charged with:\n\nHome-invasion robbery while armed with a weapon;\n\nPrinciple in the first degree.\n\nHis bond was set at $50,000.\n\n“Incidents like this are incomprehensible, and the fear this suspect put these victims through is unforgiveable”, said Sheriff Mike Prendergast, “I am thankful none of the victims were seriously injured, and all law enforcement personnel made it home safely”.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Today, July 27, 2023, the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) hosted the United States Secret Service (USSS) “Enhanced School Safety Using a Threat Assessment Model” training at CCSO’s Emergency Operations Center in Lecanto, FL.\n\nThis crucial, informative training was attended by various organizations, all with the goal of protecting our schools against threats:\n\nCCSO School Resource Deputies (SRD)\n\nSeven Rivers School Safety Deputy\n\nCCSO Behavioral Health Unit\n\nCCSO Major Crimes Detectives\n\nCCSO Intelligence Analysis Unit\n\nCCSO Community Crimes Detectives\n\nCCSO Administration\n\nCCSO Patrol\n\nCCSO Emergency Management Division\n\nFlorida Department of Juvenile Justice\n\nMarion County Sheriff’s Office\n\nLifeStream\n\nCitrus County School District\n\nSolid Rock Christian Academy\n\nInverness Christian Academy\n\n“This training is critical for our team to be fully prepared in the event of a school threat and has equipped our SRDs, detectives, and support staff with the knowledge they need to assess potential threats in order to negate them before they happen,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “I am proud of our partnership with the USSS and would like to thank them for coming to present this information to us today, so we can keep our school children and faculty safe and secure.”\n\nThe training included reviewing the research of previous attack statistics and comparing information such as the area they occurred, the type of school targeted, and whether they were averted or completed. This training also looked into how different threats have been formulated, such as the selection and procurement of weapons, setting the location and date, victim selection, and how to divert first responders through planned misdirection.\n\nFollowing the investigation of previous attacks, this training also examined the USSS’s ‘threat assessment model.’ This model can assist in identifying any potential threats, but also focuses on how to assess and intervene with students exhibiting concerning or threatening behavior as early as possible.\n\nThe training was led by the USSS National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC), which has conducted studies on the behaviors of those who have committed acts of targeted school violence in an effort to prevent future tragedies. NTAC has found this research, combined with establishing threat assessment teams and consistently encouraging individuals to report any concerning behaviors, can help prevent targeted violence at our schools.\n\nIf you see or hear any possible threats of targeted violence, please report them immediately to our office by calling 9-1-1. Never wait to report a potential threat – any information is useful and may prevent a potential tragedy.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Today, August 15, 2023, the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) hosted a round table discussion alongside U.S. Senator Rick Scott, to discuss the significance of the School Guardian Act of 2023 in enhancing school safety, along with the dangers of fentanyl and the threats of unmonitored social media. This crucial bill, proposed by Senator Scott, will support the hiring, training and equipping of armed law enforcement officers to provide full-time security at every K-12 school in the nation. Through a block grant program, the School Guardian Act of 2023 will be administered by the U.S. Department of Justice and funded by reallocating currently unused portions of the $80 billion appropriated to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the Inflation Reduction Act. Every law enforcement officer assigned to a school will complete rigorous training and be dedicated to protecting and keeping students and faculty safe from harm.\n\n“The safety of our students and faculty will always remain a top priority. The School Guardian Act of 2023 proposed by Senator Scott prioritizes school safety at the national level, which I am a strong advocate for,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “I believe we will soon see this vital legislation come to fruition with the immense support that we’ve already seen from the Florida Sheriff’s Association, the Florida Police Chiefs Association, the National Sheriffs’ Association, and so many more. I urge everyone to support this proposed bill and reach out to your congressional leaders. Let’s keep our children and our schools safe and protected.”\n\nThis round table discussion was held at our Emergency Operations Center in Lecanto and attended by several community members and leaders. In attendance was:\n\nSenator Rick Scott\n\nCitrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast\n\nHernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis\n\nMarion County Sheriff Billy Woods\n\nDoug Dodd – Chairman, Citrus County School Board and Appointed Commissioner for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission\n\nShannon Rodriguez – Hernando County School Board\n\nDana James – Headmaster at Seven Rivers Christian School\n\nGary Marriage – Parent, CEO & Insurance Professional\n\nNick Choto – Director at HCA Florida Citrus Hospital\n\nNicki Greene– Parent, community leader\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Local government officials, including the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) Emergency Management Division met today to discuss potential emergency actions in relation to Tropical Storm Idalia.\n\nIt was decided that Citrus County is declaring a Local State of Emergency effective immediately. We urge all citizens and businesses of Citrus County to make preparations - residents living in campers, recreational vehicles, tents, other structures unable to withstand the winds of a tropical storm, or along the west side of U.S. Highway 19 are advised to voluntarily evacuate.\n\n“Although there are many uncertainties surrounding the impact of Tropical Storm Idalia, we are not taking any chances when it comes to your safety. As this storm begins to strengthen in the Gulf, we will feel certain impacts,” said Sheriff Prendergast. “I strongly encourage everyone to get prepared: Make sure you have a plan in place before the storm reaches Florida, gather your important documents, and pack your go-bags. Even tropical storms can affect our county first responder’s ability to respond out in an emergency. Once those winds reach upwards of 45 miles per hour emergency vehicles cannot respond out to your location.”\n\nThe National Weather Service believes that the West Coast of Florida could experience the storm’s impact sometime Tuesday into Wednesday. Based on best available information, the National Hurricane Center predicts that counties along the coast may receive catastrophic storm surge from 6-9 feet above ground level.\n\nRemember, with any storm, you should NOT focus on the cone, rather focus on the impacts. The track could always move toward Citrus County and even if it does not, storm impacts can be far reaching. For those in coastal surge areas, be prepared to move sooner than later - DO NOT WAIT. When water starts coming in, it can move quickly and trap you.\n\nWe will open up the Citizen Information Lines tomorrow, please continue to monitor our social media for updates throughout the duration of Tropical Storm Idalia.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Tuesday, August 29, 2023, Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) detectives within our High-Tech Crimes Unit arrested two Inverness residents, 37-year-old Krystal Dawn Rose and, 37-year-old Jacob Michael Rose, an already registered sex offender, on multiple sex-related offenses.\n\nOur agency was notified of an incident involving two adults, who had traveled to meet with an individual who they believed to be a thirteen-year-old female with the intention of engaging in sexual acts.\n\nCCSO detectives responded out to a local business in Inverness where a confrontation had ensued between the Rose’s and the complainant.

They then asked for photos of her in return.\n\n“Even though a major hurricane was barreling towards our county during this arrest, our dedicated team was still hard at work protecting our citizens,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “This couple not only knowingly sent vile, sexually explicit messages to a minor, but went as far as to meet up with them to carry out repulsive acts. I am extremely proud of our detectives for putting this abhorrent couple behind bars and away from our children.”\n\nThe two were charged with the following:\n\nJacob Michael Rose:\n\nOne count of travel to meet a minor\n\nThree counts of transmission of harmful material to minors\n\nOne count of online solicitation of a minor and one count of sex offender failure to register online account.\n\nHe is being held at the Citrus County Detention facility without bond.\n\nKrystal Dawn Rose:\n\nOne count of travel to meet a minor\n\nShe is being held on a $5,000 bond per the bond schedule.\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Please join the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) and Sheriff Mike Prendergast in congratulating Detective Thomas Dowling, Major Crimes Officer in Charge, on his well-deserved promotion to the rank of Sergeant over CCSO’s Major Crimes Unit.\n\nDetective Dowling has consistently demonstrated his exceptional investigative skills and leadership qualities throughout his tenure with CCSO.

While rendering aid to the victim, the deputies saw a vehicle matching the description roughly 50 yards away. After ensuring the victim’s safety, deputies approached the vehicle, where they discovered victim two, Haybron, who had also been shot multiple times. Despite attempting life-saving efforts on scene, his injuries were not survivable.\n\nIn less than 24 hours after the incident, an arrest warrant was obtained for Murrell, and he was taken into custody by 5 p.m. on December 28.\n\n“Today, justice was served thanks to the outstanding teamwork displayed by CCSO and the State Attorney’s Office throughout this case,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “This life sentence reflects our commitment to maintaining the safety and well-being of our residents. We will continue to work tirelessly to hold those who seek to harm the citizens of our community accountable for their actions.”\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Recently, members of the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) Marine Unit, along with members of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) were recognized for their efforts in rescuing a boater in distress.\n\nOn October 11, 2023, CCSO received a call from the USCG regarding a boater in distress 15 miles off the coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, who was on a 16-foot aluminum vessel and advised the vessel was sinking. This call came in just hours before a devastating tornado touched down in Crystal River. As dangerous, life-threatening storms were approaching, CCSO quickly initiated rescue efforts and contacted FWC for assistance to utilize FWC’s 29-foot SAFE Boat. The USCG arrived on-scene just moments before CCSO and FWC, locating the vessel 18 miles off-shore. CCSO and FWC were able to get the subject on FWC’s vessel and bring him safely to shore.\n\nIn recognition of the team’s dedication to safety and rescue efforts, they received two separate awards, one from First Lady Casey DeSantis and another from Attorney General Ashley Moody. First Lady Casey DeSantis presented CCSO Sergeant Evan Marshall and Deputy Jimmy Sudlow, alongside two FWC and four USCG members with the ‘First Lady’s Medal for Courage, Commitment, and Service.’ Two days later, these brave first responders were also recognized with a ‘Back the Blue’ award presented by Attorney General Ashley Moody.\n\n“I am beyond proud of Sergeant Marshall and Deputy Sudlow for their superb example of service above self, and for their collaboration with FWC and the USCG in making this dangerous rescue,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “These individuals truly exemplify our mission of Excellence in Public Safety and put service above self every single day. We are very thankful for their dedication to keeping our community safe.”\n\n(Citrus County, FL) Last week, the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) conducted ‘Operation Rescue Thor,’ where Animal Control Officers (ACO) and Community Crimes Detectives served a search warrant to rescue over 100 animals from a residence in Inverness.\n\nOn July 31, 2023, CCSO ACOs began an animal cruelty and neglect investigation at a residence located on East McCartney Loop in Inverness. The residents of this address, 66-year-old Faustino Alfredo Valladares and 46-year-old Patricia Maria Villadamigo were alleged to have over 16 dogs and 40 chickens and turkeys on their .22-acre lot, with animals suffering from neglect. Throughout a four-month investigation, ACOs worked diligently to check on the well-being of the animals and investigate the allegations despite Valladares and Villadamigo’s minimal cooperation. All dogs in their possession were found to be without current vaccinations, and they did not have a kennel license, which is mandated by county ordinance with ownership of ten or more dogs.\n\nThor, a 7-year-old German Shepherd, was discovered to be displaying signs of pain and suffering from a severe ear infection, as well as issues with his hips. Valladares and Villadamigo refused to provide treatment for Thor, regardless of being issued a citation and a 24-hour mandate to be treated. Villadamigo ultimately made it known to ACOs that they would not be allowed to check on Thor and any other animals' well-being on their property.\n\nCCSO’s East Operations Community Crimes Detectives then assisted ACOs in obtaining arrest warrants for both Valladares and Villadamigo for one count of felony animal cruelty each. A search warrant was also obtained and served last week to rescue Thor from the property so he could receive proper treatment. During the execution of the search warrant, 18 dogs, 11 puppies, and 73 varying species of fowl, one of which was deceased, were located on the property. Partners with Citrus County Animal Services responded with deputies to assess the animals on-site, alongside Citrus County Code Enforcement. All animals were surrendered by Villadamigo and Valladares, and given to Citrus County Animal Services, where veterinary forensics and treatment will continue for all rescued animals.\n\n“Our ACOs work tirelessly to help defend innocent animals, such as Thor, whom irresponsible owners mistreat. It is sickening to see how Villadamigo and Valladares had such disregard for taking care of their animals,” said Sheriff Mike Prendergast. “I am proud of the quick investigative work of both our ACOs and Community Crimes Detectives, as well as our partnership with Citrus County Animal Services for their assistance in saving these helpless animals.”\n\nPatricia Maria Villadamigo was charged with:\n\nFelony Animal Cruelty\n\nResisting Arrest Without Violence\n\nObstruction of a Search Warrant\n\nFaustino Alfredo Valladares was charged with:\n\nFelony Animal Cruelty\n\n“This is why we established our Animal Cruelty Taskforce – an expert team dedicated to investigating and preventing animal abuse,” said William “Bill” Gladson, Fifth Judicial Circuit State Attorney. “Last week, Sheriff Mike Prendergast and his team took decisive action to rescue innocent animals from continuous, unimaginable harm. We will work together to ensure justice prevails in this case and to show compassion triumphs cruelty every time.”\n\n“This is why we established our Animal Cruelty Taskforce – an expert team dedicated to investigating and preventing animal abuse,” said William “Bill” Gladson, Fifth Judicial Circuit State Attorney. “Last week, Sheriff Mike Prendergast and his team took decisive action to rescue innocent animals from continuous, unimaginable harm.
