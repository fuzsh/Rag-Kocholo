        "text": "Hey GQ, I'm Alex Smith\n\nand I'm going undercover on the internet.\n\nThis is Actually Me.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nOkay, let's check Twitter.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n@KSeaboldt how much if any credit\n\nfor the Chiefs success goes to Alex Smith\n\nfor his professionalism and mentorship\n\nduring Patrick Mahomes's first year?\n\nWell, I would probably say most,\n\nif not all the credit probably deserves to go to me.\n\nNo, honestly, I hear some of this talk,\n\nand it's really flattering.\n\nYou know, my time there in KC\n\nwas really special to me and still is.\n\nBut I'm so happy for what these guys are doing,\n\nI wish I'd taught Pat how to throw sidearm across the field\n\nwhile backpedaling, you know, but I didn't.\n\nI was an early pick in my career.\n\nI remember how hard it was and I played right away\n\nand it was really difficult and I took my lumps.\n\nAnd you have no choice in where you go,\n\nso when Pat got drafted,\n\nI mean, it's not like he chose the situation.\n\nSo for me, I think also to be a good teammate,\n\neven when it's not necessarily convenient for you\n\nwas important to me\n\nand also to help out another young quarterback,\n\nI felt like I'd been there,\n\nso it was easier for me to relate\n\nto some of the things that he may be going through.\n\nLet's see some YouTube comments.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nFootball team is the best name ever.\n\nEven if you are sober, you sound like a drunk\n\nwhen you scream football team.\n\nWell, it's better to sound like a drunk than a racist.\n\nI don't know where to go with this one, posted.\n\nWas there ever any doubt that Alex Smith\n\nwould win AP Comeback Player of the Year?\n\nWell, apparently there's one person that didn't vote for me.\n\nSo I guess it wasn't that for sure.\n\nYeah, you never totally know,\n\nI guess how people feel that are in your circle\n\nor around it.\n\nSo I didn't totally know how people thought\n\nof this out there, you know in the journey\n\nand trying to come back.\n\nAnd then there were obviously a few stages of the comeback\n\nfrom even just making the team and then playing at first\n\nand then obviously to be able to be a starter,\n\nyou know obviously a tremendous honor\n\nand you know anytime in a team sport,\n\nyou get this kind of recognition,\n\nit's obviously a pretty special.\n\nAnd it says a lot about the people around me,\n\nall my teammates, and certainly a lot of people\n\nthat help me off the field as well.\n\nLet's see what's on Wikipedia.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nDuring a game against the Houston Texans\n\non November 18th, 2018, Smith suffered a spiral\n\nand compound fracture to his tibia and fibula\n\nin his right leg when he was sacked\n\nby Kareem Jackson and J.J. Watt.\n\nThis is completely factual and awesome reliving it.\n\nThanks a lot J.J., everybody says, J.J. is such a nice guy.\n\nThe crazy thing about this play is I really felt\n\nlike it was a pretty innocent play\n\nand sack by NFL standards.\n\nYou know it was one of those that I felt\n\nlike I was kind of conceding the sack\n\nand just trying to protect the football\n\nand you know weirdly enough getting hit\n\nby J.J. on the front and Kareem on the side,\n\nit just obviously it was enough that that my leg gave out.\n\nI remember a really funny feeling in my leg,\n\nit wasn't like I knew it was broken immediately.\n\nIt went fuzzy, that's what it felt like.\n\nAnd then really it was the visual when I looked down\n\nand could see that my leg,\n\nobviously wasn't straight anymore,\n\nthat told me that I'd broken it.\n\nFollowing the initial surgery,\n\nSmith developed life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis\n\nthat resulted in sepsis,\n\nwhich required him to undergo 17 surgeries,\n\nincluding eight debridements across four hospital stays\n\nover a period of nine months.\n\nSay that fast five times, again, all factual.\n\nLuckily I was unconscious for a majority of these surgeries.\n\nIt was not fun,\n\nI was in the hospital for about a month for the initial stay\n\nand then shorter stays thereafter luckily.\n\nUnfortunately, my wife and family probably endured\n\nthe most of this as I was kind of out of it.\n\nI mean, I know this now\n\nbut I never would have understood\n\nwhat any of this meant prior to my injury.\n\nSo for those of you out there,\n\nnecrotizing fasciitis is commonly known\n\nas flesh eating bacteria.\n\nSo basically this bug grew in my leg\n\nthat it was eating and killing the flesh in my leg.\n\nAnd then the doctors with the debris movements\n\nthat's essentially they're cutting out the infection.\n\nSo they had to cut out all the tissues,\n\nand they kept doing it, they had to go\n\nin eight different times 'cause it kept spreading\n\nand spreading finally got it under control\n\nwhich was then obviously I was left\n\nwith what was left in my leg.\n\nAs a part of his recovery process,\n\nhe wore an external fixation device for nearly a year.\n\nExternal fixation devices a really nice way of saying,\n\nthey bolted a metal cage to my leg\n\nbecause of all the surgeries\n\nand the skin grafts and pretty complex limb salvage.\n\nYou're not allowed to have a cast\n\nor any kind of boot to hold my bone in place.\n\nSo the only other alternative is to bolt a metal halo\n\ninto my bone, pretty gnarly looking when you see it on.\n\nYou can't get pants on, shorts on, underwear on\n\nover this thing 'cause it's really big.\n\nSo basically my wife was nice enough to go get\n\nlike a few pairs of underwear shorts\n\nand some pants altered for me where they could zip up\n\nor button up on the side,\n\nso I could just kinda put them on like basketball warmups,\n\nbut that's basically all I wore for those 10 months,\n\nwhere some version of those underwear shorts or pants.\n\nAlex Smith mentored three quarterbacks\n\nthat eventually went to a Super Bowl.\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Colin Kaepernick, and Nick Foles.\n\nI wish I got to play in the Super Bowl.\n\nAlways the bridesmaid, never the bride, I guess.\n\nAgain, an honor to somehow people think I deserve any kind\n\nof credit with these three guys,\n\nbut again, flattering.\n\nYou might not believe it, but it's actually me.\n\nAre we sure Mahomes becomes who he is\n\nas quickly if he doesn't sit?\n\nDidn't look nearly as good in preseason\n\nor his loan game his rookie year,\n\nhas said many times sitting behind Alex Smith led him\n\nto better recognizing defensive schemes.\n\nThere's no one size fits all approach in my opinion.\n\nI still couldn't break him of his ketchup habit,\n\napparently either.\n\nAgain, this is really flattering,\n\nyou know, maybe if I was a little better\n\nat reading the situation\n\nI could have seen that I was gonna get traded that year.\n\nTo even say I have a small sliver\n\nof the Chiefs' and Pat's trajectory is flattering.\n\nAgain, the left-handed passes,\n\nI wish I had been the one taking those notes\n\nwhile we were together.\n\nReplied, let's check out Reddit.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nYou know what is amazing?\n\nThe fact that he is taking risks\n\nunlike I've seen in San Fran or KC,\n\nit's almost as if after the surgery he feels\n\nas though there's nothing to lose\n\nand it is wonderful to watch.\n\nI could lose my other leg.\n\nNo kidding, here it is, the game manager checkdown thing.\n\nI don't know,\n\nI'm just playing out there.\n\nI'm trying to make the right reads to help our team score.\n\nIf it calls for throwing it down the field\n\nI try to do that.\n\nAnd when it's about checking it down, I try to do that too.\n\nWell, I think from the moment,\n\nespecially for my first start this last year,\n\nall week, it was amazing.\n\nI felt like a rookie driving into work every day,\n\nI had these like amazing butterflies all week,\n\nleading up to that game that I never thought would happen.\n\nI just kept telling myself that this could be my only start.\n\nThis could be it, I may never get another one.\n\nIt was amazing to live like that\n\nthat whole week and play like that,\n\nthat just there is no tomorrow,\n\nnothing's guaranteed beyond this.\n\nI really wish I could go back to maybe my younger self,\n\nand you know instill that.\n\nAnd I think it's something\n\nthat we can all hopefully live like,\n\nand certainly for me play like, just being in the moment,\n\nmaking the most of it,\n\nand you're not taking anything for granted.\n\nNext, in 2007, Smith founded the Alex Smith Foundation\n\nand the Alex Smith Guardian Scholars Program,\n\nwhich helps send foster teens to college.\n\nThis is true.\n\nApparently, we couldn't come up with any better names\n\nthan just putting Alex Smith on the front of everything.\n\nThis is still one of my passions, still rolling today\n\nis helping foster kids finish high school and college.\n\nI didn't grow up in a foster kid,\n\nI grew up basically the total opposite.\n\nStill have a ton of support to this day from my family.\n\nAnd I could not imagine trying to do that alone.\n\nI was just trying to help kids,\n\nit really kind of came to my attention in 2007\n\nGod, I was still in my early 20s\n\nand meeting some of these kids that were homeless,\n\ntrying to finish school completely on their own.\n\nAnd I just remember how daunting that seemed to me\n\nat the time and how unfair,\n\njust trying to help the kids out who were obviously born\n\ninto a completely different situation\n\nthrough no fault of their own.\n\nYou may not believe it, but it's actually me,\n\nAlex Smith, the former Chiefs QB Alex Smith,\n\njust agreed with me backstage in an interview\n\nthat Brady is the GOAT.\n\nSo there you go.\n\nWell, Briar, I told you so.\n\nIt's tough to argue with this one.\n\nI mean, he's got more championships\n\nthan every franchise there is.\n\nCan we all agree that it should be two-hand touch rules\n\nwhen it comes to Alex Smith?\n\nI'm always so nervous watching him play,\n\ncan't even imagine how his wife and family feel.\n\nI don't disagree with this.\n\nIf someone could tell Aaron Donald this,\n\nthat would be awesome.\n\nWhen I got home after the first game\n\nthat I played in that I got tackled,\n\nmy wife and family were celebrating\n\nand really made it a big deal for me,\n\nkind of the milestone.\n\nAnd they seem so happy.\n\nAnd then I saw some pictures of their faces\n\nduring the game as I was getting tackled\n\nand clearly, a very different emotion for my wife and kids.\n\nWow, Alex Smith's wife made a replica\n\nof the Lombardi trophy out of his leg brace.\n\nThey don't make them like that anymore. #project 11.\n\nYou're right, Chris,\n\nit is a really strong brace.\n\nElizabeth's pretty good too.\n\nYou know I'm not a big, like memorabilia guy.\n\nWe don't have anything, there's no like den.\n\nSo this is the only thing\n\nfrom my career that really sits out.\n\nDeservedly, it's the coolest present I've ever got.\n\nYou know, it was something that I wore that,\n\nlike I said, it was life-changing and a pain\n\nto live with for so long.\n\nBut certainly I think to flip it\n\nand change it into something like that,\n\nI really I think is so cool\n\nand really signifies the journey.\n\nIf Alex Smith retires this offseason Kyle Shanahan needs\n\nto make him QB Coach, obviously still loves the game\n\nbut wants to move back to the Bay.\n\nHe got peak Kaepernick ready,\n\nMahomes mentally ready,\n\nand now Heinecke, Haskins question Mark,\n\nyou can lead a horse to water\n\nbut you can't make them drink.\n\nMan, I guess I can't be an OSI,\n\nI gotta be a quarterback coach.\n\nI am planning on moving back to the Bay eventually,\n\nbut I don't know, I think my wife would kill me\n\nif I decided to coach.\n\nShe sacrificed enough during my playing career,\n\nbeing away I think if I decided to continue on,\n\neven more so as a coach,\n\nI don't think that would be good.\n\nLAURA, in all caps, ask him if he's going\n\nor wants to play next year?\n\nI think this is about the 60-minutes.\n\nAnd Mark Workman, her name is Norah.\n\nSo if you were screaming, she might've heard you\n\nif you called her by her real name.\n\nI had so much fun playing this last year.\n\nI felt like my leg and my body\n\nwith the time off and the injury responded so well.\n\nAnd so for me, I feel like it only fueled the fire for me\n\nto kind of continue to see where I can go\n\non this journey back.\n\nI still feel like I have more to do\n\nand more to gain.\n\nSo we'll see again, I really need to sit down,\n\nmy wife deserves a lot of input in this\n\nas she is been through even more than me.\n\nSo here get into the off season and see where we're at.\n\nAll right, GQ, thanks for all the comments.\n\nI'm Alex Smith and I'm signing off internet."
