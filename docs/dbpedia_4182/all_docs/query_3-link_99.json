        "text": "With record industry cutbacks all round, the prospect of success with a major record label seems more remote than ever for most musicians. So why not start your own? Many of us think about it, but what would you actually need to do? Our new series tells you...\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that home recording was a very expensive business beyond the reach of most musicians, but now affordable technology, like that featured in SOS each month, offers us all the opportunity of making release-quality records in a project studio. Many people who have self-produced a record ask themselves why they shouldn't release the record on their own, instead of trying to get another party interested. There are attractive reasons for the DIY approach, such as keeping artistic control and retaining copyright of your recordings and songs (as we'll see, there's an important difference between the two). Then there are new incentives, like the possibility of distributing and selling on the Internet.\n\nFor those choosing to go it alone, having a good recording or commercial song is just the beginning of the process, albeit perhaps the most important starting point. But from there on, DIY record releasing is a game of business management, promotion, marketing, selling and negotiating. If you look carefully at any of these subject areas, you will find that there are people and organisations who specialise solely in one of these disciplines as full-time jobs — and by releasing your own records, you may take on the roles of all of these people. You may already have done the jobs of songwriter, musician, arranger, engineer, producer and mastering engineer to create your recordings, but as a record-label owner, you will find yourself with plenty of other work to do.\n\nThis series will be looking at the business of setting up your own record label. As you can probably imagine, there are a million ways to do things, and many of your decisions will depend on who is involved in your project, and what you are trying to achieve in the long run. With the help of several case studies, we will look at what you need to know and what you should be wary of, leaving you with the basic knowledge needed to get started. Principally, though, this series is aimed at musicians and songwriters intending to release their own work, rather than at the businessman intending to release the music of others. The other caveat to mention is that most of the advice in the series relates to how things work in the United Kingdom — if you're based in the US or elsewhere, you may find that other practices and laws apply which affect how you go about setting up your label — so beware!\n\nSongwriters & Artists\n\nThe first thing to establish and understand is the basic structure of the industry. The diagram on the left below is a simplified plan of the industry, showing the relationships between various organisations and main players like record companies and publishers. As we continue through this series, we will talk about the most important players featured in this diagram in more detail, but before going any further, there is one very important point to make clear, and that is the differentiation between publisher and label — a distinction which is not always fully understood. Although we will discuss the roles of both in more detail later, for the purpose of introducing a few basic concepts, it is necessary to briefly explain the two here.\n\nSimply put, an artist earns money from the purchase and playing of their recordings, while a songwriter earns money from the recording and playing of their songs. The publisher is the person who deals with the rights of songwriters, whereas the label deals with the rights of artists. It may be the case for you that both writer and artist are one and the same person, but publishing and recording still remain separate issues, and as you will see, some people decide to run their own label and do their own publishing, while others sign to a third-party publisher.\n\nSeparate though they are, publishing and recording are intrinsically linked, simply because every recorded song has a songwriter. Consequently, the publisher is constantly dealing with labels, and labels are constantly dealing with publishers. It's also true that releasing your own records rarely means that you will be acting without the use of some kind of record label or publisher. Perhaps the label will be your vehicle for creating the products, after which you will let a publisher take hold of the rights to your songs. Or you may just need to sub-publish and license your music and records for overseas distribution. You might even decide to keep your publishing, but get another record label to sign you to take advantage of the cash advance and promotional clout they can offer. However you cut it, if you have any kind of success, you will come into contact with publishers and record labels at some stage, even if it's because other artists on other labels are keen to record your songs — or, in this day and age, to sample your recordings.\n\nYou will also notice from the diagram that the publisher and label stand between you (as artist/writer) and certain organisations, the main ones here being the MCPS, PRS and PPL. These are collection agencies, who gather royalties from the exploitation of recordings and public performance of recordings. A DIY label will have to deal with these organisations directly. We'll look at how that works later in the series.\n\nGoing Legal\n\nIn the meantime, there are some important planning stages which you would be wise to consider before starting your label. Although releasing records may seem far removed from running a corner shop or garden centre, a record label is still a business venture, and as such requires income and expenditure accounts by law, and dealings with entities like the much-feared Inland Revenue. You may even have to cope with VAT returns if your turnover is beyond a certain amount (for more on these terms, see the box later in this article), and these, along with other important issues like National Insurance contributions and annual tax returns, will demand a significant degree of organisation and planning. There will be more on how to handle these matters in future parts of this series.\n\nInitially, you will need to establish a structure for your business. The choices you make will depend on what you decide to put out on your label and how many people will be involved. Penny Ganz, a specialist music lawyer, explains your options. \"Before anything else, you need to consider the legal structure of your operation. If it's just you, doing your own music, then you will probably operate as a sole trader. If there are a couple of people working together, then they become a partnership. If you want to ring-fence the operation in some way, you can form a limited company. If a limited company is wound up, the directors will not be liable for any debts, unless they have personally guaranteed them. That is automatic with a limited company.\n\n\"Limited companies are appropriate if someone has contributed a sum of money for manufacturing or other costs. In that case, it might be a good idea to give them some shares in the company. So it's a good way to create a vehicle for investment.\n\n\"That aside, I would say that in normal circumstances it's not worth forming a limited company, because of the amount of paperwork involved. A government organisation called Companies House is obliged to keep details on all limited companies, and so if you form a limited company, there are lots of Companies House forms that have to be completed at the outset. These can be obtained through a Companies Formation Agent, where you buy a ready-made company and slot in your own shareholders, directors and so on — that usually costs about £100. Once a year, you have to do a return to Companies House with the accounts attached, so they become public. That means you are under scrutiny, but it can work to your advantage, as it allows you to check out other people, too. If as a lawyer, I were signing an artist into a little production company, I would normally do a search at Companies House, and see how long the company had been going, if they'd been making the returns properly, and how much capital they had.\"\n\nIn contrast, a sole trader is personally liable for all amounts owed to creditors and the government. If you go this route, you could find your house repossessed if things go badly wrong. Where two or more people start a business in which neither are considered employees, they become a partnership and are jointly liable.\n\nFor any partnership, you will need to sign some sort of joint agreement, and for that you will need to see a music-industry lawyer. A lawyer may seem a little unnecessary when you are starting out, but it really is essential to have one to oversee any agreements you make. If there is more than one of you, you will need the aforementioned partnership agreements to define how the business will be shared. In the case of a DIY label, it is extremely important to establish a 'song-share' agreement to specify the percentage breakdown for words and music each member of the writing team are to receive. Penny explains why this can be a problem. \"You might be certain that your working partners are happy with the arrangements, but there are girlfriends, family and friends who may convince them that they should be getting a better deal, and that is unpredictable. An agreement will protect you from those outside influences, so it is essential to put things in writing.\"\n\nRoyalties & Contracts\n\nAs far as UK law is concerned, music is a 'musical work', whereas lyrics are 'literary works', but both command the same statutory rights. David Gedge, who made his name in the band The Wedding Present (see the interview in SOS February 2001) and now runs his own Scopitones label, explains how The Wedding Present arranged their affairs. \"Everything apart from the publishing was split four ways between the band members. That meant the recording royalties and all the merchandising, but the publishing was shared between the writers in an agreed way.\n\n\"We split publishing into thirds between the music, the lyrics and the arrangement. I thought it was quite fair, but subsequently I found out I have probably done myself out of a few quid, because standard practice is half for lyrics and I've always been the sole lyric writer. So, I got my third for lyrics and then there was me and two others writing the music. The fourth person wasn't a writer, but he was involved in the arrangement. Beyond that basic theory, not everybody wrote on every song and there were instrumentals, so it was fairly flexible.\"\n\nIt's important to take the same degree of care over establishing recording royalties whenever you are using other musicians on your recordings. Organisations like PAMRA (the Performing Artists' Media Rights Association) exist to defend the performance rights and subsequent royalty earnings of recording musicians. Even if a friend agrees to help you out by contributing instrumental parts on your record, it could still turn into a legal battle years later if that music becomes successful and that person decides they deserve a share of the royalties. To avoid any confusion, contracts are needed, and once again, these ideally need to be overseen by a lawyer to avoid legal wrangles later.\n\nIt's not just musicians who can cause problems in this way — if you use an artist or designer (or both) to produce the look of your release package, you still need to respect their copyright of that material, and an organisation called DACS (Design and Artists Copyright Society) also exists to protect their rights. This principle applies to any photography you use, and therefore an agreement needs to cover the use of logos, artwork and photos for releases and merchandise, and for publishing on your web site. To keep your accounting simple, you will probably want to agree on a one-off fee for all such services, but your artistic collaborators may have other ideas!\n\nPenny Ganz explains the legal situation with regard to musical collaborators: \"If the musicians you're using belong to the Musicians Union, then it is very easy to use MU Forms, which are standard one-pager fill-in-the-gaps forms. They contain the wording that you need about the musicians not making any further claim once they have been paid. The idea is to get the musicians in, pay them their fee or whatever you decide, and ensure you then have all the rights to do what you want with the record afterwards. The MU is one source for the document, but most lawyers, studios, and producers will also have standard forms.\"\n\nOwnership and copyright of finished recordings can also be a cause for dispute. Again, you may need to confirm your agreements in writing. \"The owner of the copyright of a sound recording is the person who arranged for the recording to take place, which includes getting people together,\" explains Penny. \"It's a bit of a loose concept, but essentially, if you are recording in your own room or your own studio, and nobody else is involved or paying for it, then it is perfectly clear that the resulting recording will be yours.\n\n\"If you have a manager setting up recording dates for you, then probably on balance the manager would be the owner of the copyright of the recording, which is why in that sort of scenario you would want to discuss your expectations with your manager to make sure everyone is in agreement.\"\n\nIn the UK, copyright immediately exists when an original musical or literary work is recorded, whether in writing or otherwise. That could be as a hand-written score or a hissy tape recording. Penny: \"It is a myth that you need to do something to register a copyright — it is automatically yours. If you want some proof, you can do the thing where you put a demo in an envelope and post it to yourself and then don't open it. Some people put them in a bank vault, and so on, but that's not really necessary.\"\n\nUntil very recently, it was possible to register any work with a body called Stationers Hall Registry for a fee. Unfortunately, the organisation no longer accepts submissions, although there is now an alternative service provided by the Copyright Protection Agency. The Agency offer something called a First Protection Envelope System which, for a fee of £55, provides you with a uniquely coded envelope for your work. Once sealed and posted, the envelope is stored in a secure vault, while you hang onto a matching warranty form. Comforting though this is, after considering the work involved in making your music and running a label, you may soon decide that this extra task is not worth the trouble or expense.\n\nThere May Be Trouble Ahead\n\nOf course, it almost goes without saying that any publishing deal or recording contracts you sign will need to be fully checked by a lawyer to protect your rights. As we briefly mentioned earlier, even though you are intending to take the DIY approach to releasing your music, that doesn't mean you won't be using a publisher or that you won't be sub-licensing your records to a larger label to take advantage of their worldwide links. But there are some important issues which you need to consider, not least of which is what happens if one of the companies you have licensed to goes bust (see the 'Small Print, Big Problems' box).\n\nPenny Ganz explains the importance of 'reversion' clauses: \"If your lawyer has been doing their job, then your rights should automatically revert to you upon liquidation of the other company. However, sometimes that is more difficult with recording contracts, because they tend to grant rights for ever. If you are under one of those contracts, the rights would go to the liquidator, official receiver or whoever bought the company through the receiver. You could try to buy them back from the receiver, because quite often they don't know the value, but step number one is to check the contract to see whether there is something in there dealing with this issue. Most publishing agreements do not run forever, so they should allow the rights to go back. That is because there is the principle of the rights being licensed to the publishing company rather than being owned by them, so they tend to be more flexible. Recording companies, however, often insist on owning the copyright for ever, because they are putting money into making the recording and, in a lot of ways, are investing a lot more than a publishing company would. The publishing just takes on and administers the rights to something that's already been created.\"\n\nIf you have no contact with a label or publisher, you may go directly to a distributor in order to secure a manufacturing and distribution deal. We will look as some real-life examples of distribution deals later in this series, but it's worth noting that distribution is another very important facet of the business which you should check with a lawyer. \"You need to watch out for anything where the distributor is likely to charge a fee for their services. If you, as the releasing label or artist, are not getting income from a record, you can quickly end up with a negative balance. So you need to think about how open to later problems an agreement will leave you. There will be common-sense things, but it varies from contract to contract. The typical things are handling charges, stock movement charges, and charging to return the records to you if you are the label and you've stopped selling records.\"\n\nMastering and manufacture of your work is something else we will come back to later when looking at the running of your label, but while we're on the subject of protecting your investments, you may want to be cautious when handing over your precious master or cash deposit to a production plant. \"Pressing plants go bust quite frequently.\" warns Penny, \"so if you can possibly avoid paying a deposit up front, then do. Recently, another artist I was representing was in the process of doing a release, but she couldn't find out why her CDs hadn't been delivered — and it was because the plant had gone into liquidation. She had to drive up there very fast and extricate her masters. Thankfully, she hadn't paid the deposit they had first asked her to.\"\n\nPart 2"
