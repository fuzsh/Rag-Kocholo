Yet it is only in the public course of acceptance and compensation that we discover the power of our sufficiency. \"As a child, a teenager, and a young adult, I was much more shy and withdrawn than I am now,\" says David Byrne, talking quietly in his loft home in Lower Manhattan's Soho district as he considers the long prelude to \"David Byrne\" (Luaka Bop/Sire/Wamer Bros., due May 24), his first self-titled record. \"I was bom May 14, 1952, in Dumbarton, Scotland, coming to this country with my parents when I was 2 years old, and I had a Scottish accent until I was in the second grade. I had to lose it because my classmates couldn't understand me. And we moved around a lot, to places like Ontario, Canada, and Baltimore, because of my father, who worked as an electrical engineer for Westinghouse. I always had to find whole new groups of friends, yet I was able to remake myself every time I made those new friends, so I wasn't saddled with their knowledge or awareness of the person I was before. I learned self-reliance. \"As for my music,\" he confides, \"to complete my personality I Aa£(to jump onstage. It became a way for me to introduce myself, to meet and talk to people. Now, I'm hooked.\" But no less needy? \"Right,\" he laughs. \"In fact, just before my last East Coast club tour in September and October of '93, when my new band [drummer Todd Turkisher, bassist I^ul Socolow, and vibes/marimba player Mauro Refosco] heli)ed me break in the new songs on 'David Byrne,' I'd been listening to music like I^lsy Cline and Thelonious Monk, with ver>- direct emotional qualities. And I thought, 'Hey, maybe some of that's missing in what I tr>' to do.' \" And in the act of responding to that protracted artistic imbalance, Byrne hxs fashioned the kind of record even his most loyal votaries could not have anticipated: a frank, confessional work of frail simplicity and forceful compassion. Whether re- viewing past aspects of his professional and per- sonal schema in \"A Long Time Ago\" (\"I kept my feelings to myself/Until the perfect moment comes\") or assaying their outcome in \"Angels\" (\"I can barely touch my own self/How could I touch someone elseT/I'm just an advertisement/For a version of myself), Byrne mixes wit and wistfulness with the calm will of someone who has bypassed any crisis of self in order to embrace the enigma. By the time he arrives at \"A Self-Made Man,\" he's gently mocking the hectic vocal hook of Talking Heads' seminal \"Psycho Killer\" — the first song he ever wrote and performed. Byrne recalls his boyhood as a period of seldom-interrupted self- absorption, father Thomas Byrne and wife Emma encouraging any artistic drives on the part of David and younger sister Celia. \"I liked to draw as a kid,\" he says, \"and I would sketch pictures of rockets, or scenes from James Bond or 'The Man From U.N.C.LE.' \" Music (Scottish and American folk) was heard ofien in the Byrne household, as were the tolerant philosophies of his moth- er's Quaker faith. In his mid-leens. Byrne took up the guitar, violin, and accordion, later attempting to write \"fake Bob Dylan songs.\" \"When I first got into pop music, I was a sophomore in a subur- ban Baltimore high school called Arbutus,\" he says. \"My father helped me rig up a Norelco reel-to-reel tape recorder so I could do overdubs.\" Time spent at the Rhode Island School of Design and Mary land Institute College of Art helped him cultivate a social cir- Artistics (also known as the Autistics). In 1975, the latter combo became the basis of Talking Heads, the Byrne-led group taking its name from a passage in an issue of \"TV GUIDE.\" Talking Heads did its first shows at CBGB in June 1975. Eigh- teen years later, Byrne jumped back onstage at the venerable Bow- ery club to complete the \"prerecording road test\" of \"David Byrne.\" \"I put my name on this project because it seemed Uke a begin- ning,\" he notes. \"Like when I started performing.\" As co-produced by Arto Lindsay, Susan Rogers, and Byrne, the new album is a purgative potpourri of unpremeditated melodies and inspired mis- cellany, its orderly 12-track structure belying the messy substance and blessed accidents that ultimately evoke the gift of emotional engagement What triggered such candor in the customarily cau- tious Byrne? \"It began,\" he says, \"with *Buck Naked,' a song I wrote in Janu- ary 1992 when Tina Chow, the sister of my wife Bonny, was dying of AIDS. I was singing it to my little daughter Malu, who liked to run around the house without clothes. Events like the loss of a family member help catalyze your deeper feelings. And for me it led to things like the record's first single, 'Angel,' with that sense of soaring above the world, de- tached, but also intense physicality, accepting the funk and sweat as part of the beautj* of life.\" The album is not without a tinge of the incorpo- real, its traces of mysticism and spirituality per- haps linked to the Scottish heritage Byrne has ex- plored since his youth. \"My relatives all live around Glasgow.\" he says, \"and my family would go back every couple of years to visit. I'd hitch- hike up into the Highlands, to Edinburgh, or out to the Isle of Skye. My last trip was a little over a year ago, and since then I've started reading about Scottish mythology and fairies, which seem to be a remnant of pre-Christian Druid society. A lot of it is taken by the people to be fact, like ancient tales of UFO sightings and abductions. I definitely feel a kinship with the beauty and mystery of the cul- ture, and with their music, too, which swings in a way that shows its affinity for R&B. Like most things, an appreciation of it de- pends on acceptance of its unique differences.\" Meanwhile, avid fans will have to get accustomed to David Byrne works with the vulnerable abandon of \"Back In The Box,\" \"Lillies Of The Valley,\" and \"You And Eye,\" as well as material (\"A Self-Made Man,\" \"Sad Song,\" \"My Love Is You\") that is touch- ing enough to move listeners to the verge of tears. Having progressed as an artist to the point where he could re- turn, without guile or apology, to the purest underpinnings of his talent and its hunger for human attachment, Byrne has rendered the best album of his entire, restless career. One cannot mourn what one has not loved, and in that depth of pity is the most sincere gesture of respect and cherishmenl. As Byrne summarizes in \"Sad Song\": \"There are those who are happy /There are those who are wise/But it's the truly sad people/Who get the most out of life.\" \"Real sadness is such an all-encompassing, intense thing that it takes you out of your humdrum existence,\" Byrne says softly. \"If you can still function, you want to savor it while it's peaking. So when people tell you to cheer up, it's not always the best thing. Like your conscience, sadness is a natural and beautiful impulse that gives you moral guidance. These things are the foundations of cle that led to involvement in groups with names like Bizadi and the most religions. And in their humanity, they're just like music.\" THIS WEEK IN BILLBOARD A NEW TURN FOR MARTIN PAGE Having earned his wings writing hits for Starship, Heart, Go West, and others, singer/songwriter Martin Page has recruited an impressive array of guests for his solo debut, due from Mer- cury July 26.

Littiofonl Commentaiy Solving Europe's Billion-Dollar Question I BY GUNNAR PETRI When EMI Music joined the rest of the major international record companies in striking a central licensing deal for Europe, many in the field of authors' rights saw it as another retrograde step in the authors' battle to defend the value of their work. The accepted practice of giving record companies a rebate on mechanical copy- right is disturbing, and the prospect of the lai^er European societies competing with each other to offer discounts at the expense of the author is even more so. However, with all the record companies now inside the central licensing system, there are also new opportunities for cooper- ation. Europe is now the world's biggest single unified market for recorded music, and in 1993 sales were worth $10.23 billion. Pub- lishers and creators of the raw materials for this industry — ^the songs and composi- tions — receive an estimated $500 million in copyright payments. However, we are still without an adequate central clearing sys- tem for administering these rights, the value of which can only grow in years to come. The high level of copjTight protection also has resulted in increased payments to U.S. rights owners, a factor that has height- ened their interest in how rights are col- lected in Europe. Criticism of the existing system is legitimate; It is far from perfect, but more often than not criticism of the de- fects is exaggerated and based on faulty premises. Record companies are not being unrea- sonable when they ask to pay their rights to a single source in what is effectively a single European market. Moreover, it is now an accepted fact of life that all m^'or record companies will seek to do business in this way. A decade ago. the situation was different Before the advent of the Common Market, there was a system in which national socie- ties licensed rights in their own territories. This had advantages for all concerned. Rec- ord companies could report in their own languages, while writers benefited from economies of scale on a national level. Then came the single market in the Eur- opean Community, and with it the conse- quent centralization of production facilities for the whole continent. The deal between Holland's STEMRA and CBS in 1982 marked the birth of this system. Since then, Germany's GEMA, France's SDRM, and most recently the U.K. society MCPS, have entered the competition for licensing rec- ord companies. Societies that have administered these deals in the last 12 years have profited fi*om them in the short term, but the advantages have been for their owti members and not for the greater good of the creative commu- nity. With hindsight, it is obvious that the The most obvious solution is to create a European one-stop iicensing source' Gunnar Petri is managing director of Sweden's perlorming rights society, STIM, and chairman of the executive bureau of CISAC, the international authors' rights organization. system they created cannot last. We cannot rewind the clock and outlaw these central deals, but the present offers opportunities for collaboration, so that rec- ord companies and rights holders can enjoy the benefits of economies of scale. These benefits do not exist when there is competition between the societies, as there is pressure on each licensor to pass on any savings he or she may make to his or her record company customer in the form of a rebate, and not to the author in the form of reduced commission. When it comes to the task of centrally ad- ministering rights payments, I do not for one second believe that any society is rel- ishing that task, nor is any one society ca- pable of administering copyrights for all record companies. Yet, at the same time, we all share the common goal of wanting to reduce the administrative burden on our societies. One solution was presented in the form of the EMRO project, which would have led to a cumbersome and repressive split in Europe. The mathematics in EMRO were flawed, and did not take into account com- plexities such as the web of sub-publishing contracts in Europe. EMRO's significance was that it e.x- pressed genuine discontent among some rights holders — discontent that still exists, especially among U.S. publishers. What Ls now needed is a pan-European solution to this issue. We need to find ways of communicating between ourselves. The last two central li- censing deals also have included a substan- tial amount of national repertoire from sev- eral countries. For example, it is possible in theory to administer rights to Swedish songs in France. Yet on a practical level, it is difficult for the computer systems to read the character symbols unique to each lan- guage. Administrative practices also vary greatly throughout the continent It makes sense for local societies to carry on licens- ing national productions. For international repertoire, the most obvious solution is to create a European one-stop licensing source. This also would have the advantage of allowing smaller la- bels to take advantage of the same econo- mies of scale which larger multinationals have negotiated through strength. The one cloud on the horizon is the Eur- opean Commission, which no doubt has been watching the competition between na- tional societies with approval. It might be unwilling to accept a de facto monopoly: The Commission has already shown, through its treatment of video-licensing body VPL in its dispute with MTV Europe, that it takes a dim view of monopolistic cen- tral licensing of copyright. In June 1992, MTV filed a complaint against VPL with the Commission, claiming the licensing body violated European Community com- petition rules because it would not allow the network to deal with record companies in- dividually. In a preliminary assessment last August, the Commission indicated that it takes a dim view of VPL's position (Bill- board, Aug. 21, 1993). A final judgement has not yet been issued by the Commission. On the other hand, it already approves of BIEM acting as a negotiating cartel in its regular three-year discussions with IFPI. It also has showTi interest in supporting a project on collaboration between the socie- ties. Yet the EC will not be able to decide un- less the organizations representing rights holders agree on a plan themselves and present a European solution to the Com- mission. Any other imaginable scenario for the coming years has to be worse than this.

(Billboard, April 16, 1994), there appears to be conftjsion and mL<;information among broadcasters regarding licensing of nicknames and slogans, which are trade- marks, not copjTights nor patents. The purpose of trademark registration is to prevent confusion among the listening public. Only if a station owner has federal registration of his trademark from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Washing- ton, D.C., can he prevent other stations out- side his listener area from using it. An owner cannot get federal registration with- out using or intending to use the trademark in interstate commerce. Mere state registra- tion of a trademark does not protect it na- tionwide; if a station in Detroit has regis- tered its slogan in Michigan, it cannot de- mand payment from a station in Los Angeles. The statement attributed to consultant Mike Joseph that rights to a licensed name are normally good for 17 years is incorrect. A federal trademark has a duration of 10 years but can be protected forever as long as a renewal application is filed every 10 years and the trademark is still being used.

Stable growth in the major devel- oped music markets made a signifi- cant contribution to the increase, which compares less favorably with 1992's year-on-year increase of 9.2%. However, the 1993 figure is seen by industry executives as more than satisfactory, given the slug- gish state of the world's key econo- mies. Retail sales broke the $30 billion barrier last year, with IFPI stats showing a toUl of $30,489 billion worldwide, excluding music video sates. Senior executives of the major corporations point out that while the total sales growth in 1993 was slower than 1992, profits from the newer markets have begun to make surprisingly large contributions to the bottom line (for in-depth com- ment and analysis, see page 51). By contrast, European and North American economies are growing at slower rates and are seeing less sig- nificant increases in terms of profit.

MTV Asia went off the air May 2. a casualty of months of intense negotia- tions between MTV parent Viacom and Star TV, the Hong Kong-based satellite network that has been carry- ing the channel since September 1991. In its place, Star TV (part of Ru- pert Murdoch's News Corp.) began broadcasting a 24-hour music video service across Asia — one which soon may be financially underpinned by a partnership involving most of the multinational record companies, to- gether with cable giant TCI. At press time, executives from TCI and MCA were unavailable for com- ment; executives from PolyGram, Sony. BMG. EMI, and Warner Bros, declined comment The deal is expected to be similar to the one that established the Viva! service in Germany as a local alterna- tive to MTV Europe. Star will be the largest shareholder, but will not take a majority position, insiders say. International record company in- volvement in music broadcasting was inevitable in a region where opera- tions are becoming increasingly local- ized. \"Domestic music is what sells music television in Asia,\" says I^ul Ewing, Warner Music International VP and regional director, based in Hong Kong. \"[The majors] have be- come actively involved [with Star] be- cause we feel we should have some say in what is being broadcast\" The Star channel is airing a video mix of international pop, Chinese bal- lads, and Hindi movie music, com- plete with the former MTV Asia VJs (under contract to Star) and graphics. Viewers polled said they didn't notice that the MTV logo was missing. \"We replaced [MTV] without miss- ing a beat,\" says Star music channel managing director Don Atyeo. \"The whole thing will be a lot easier with a local strategy.\" The service does not yet have an official name, but insiders say it will be known as \"V\" once negotiations with the new partners are finalized. Star TV reaches approximately 42 million households across Asia and the Middle East For its part, MTV Networks de- clared May 2 that it will launch sepa- rate, wholly owned and operated mu- sic channels for the Asian market- place in the fourth quarter this year. The official statements about the MTV/Star split were as amicable as any uncontested divorce. Both sides said they would pursue \"separate op- erations in order to better serve the market\" The reality couldn't have been more different Star executives say the 2'/2-year relationship was rup- tured by conflicts over programming and how much money Viacom would get from its MTV-brand license. Sources say MTV had even threat- ened to pull its name if it did not achieve an ownership position. MTV last year received approximately $1 million in licensing fees and advertis- ing revenues from Star. Although Star refuses to reveal how much the music channel's revenues have grown, it says they have been consis- tenly healthy. During talks, one Star executive ex- plained that to renew the MTV license. Viacom officials sought \"pretty well 100% of the operation, after we'd spent millions building it up. It reveals a major difference in philosophy.\" (Continued on page 19) Jit Somettilng To Crow About.

McDonald's To Serve New Video Premiums But MCA Denies 'Jurassic' Link To Food Chain ■ BY EILEEN FITZPATRICK LOS ANGELES— Although the de- tails are sketchy, it appears McDon- ald's is cooking up more video premi- um offers for this summer and fall. According to trade sources, the promotions may include MCA/Uni- versal Home Video's \"Back To The Future\" trilogy, which would be sold at the fast-food restaurant as part of its annual \"Holiday Film Festival,\" scheduled for late November The fast-food chain, which did a theatrical tie-in when \"Jurassic I^rk\" opened in theaters last summer, is re- portedly working a cross-promotion with that video release. But MCA Home Video president Louis Feola denies trade reports hinting that the dinosaur epic may be sold at the chain. \"Our plan is to make 'Jurassic f^k' the biggest-selling cassette of all time in our video account base,\" Feola says. \"There are no plans to make 'Jurassic I^k' available in any premium-type promotion.\" Feola would not comment on fur ther plans for \"JurassK I^ric\" or the \"Back To The Future\" promo. The supplier is due to unveil its campaign for \"Jurassic Pirk\" May 24. Other industry sources indicate \"Jurassic F^rk\" will have multiple tie-in partners, including a consumer sweepstakes offering a trip to Ha- waii, where the film was shot Sources also say McDonald's is close to a deal with another studio for several kid vid titles, slated for July. As in past deals, the \"Back To The Future\" tapes would be available at the food chain for a low price with the purchase of a large sandwich. Pricing has yet to be determined, but previ- ous tapes were $5.99 and $7.99. McDonald's spokeswoman Sue Bergen would not comment on the chain's video plans. \"Right now, things are being finalized and there is not a definite deal with anyone.\" McDonald's is set to conduct a CD promotion that would raise money for its Ronald McDonald Children's Charities. In that promotion, sampler CDs from Garth Brooks and 'Tina Turner, among others, would be sold at a discount price, with $1 going to the charity (Billboard, May 7). If they pan out, the video deals will mark the third consecutive year Mc- Donald's has enticed a video supplier to sign on for a premium promotk>n. On average, the monthlong Mc- Donald's sale has moved approxi- mately 10 million cassettes. In 1992, Orion Home Video stunned retailers with an exclusive McDonald's premium for \"Dances With Wolves\"(Billboard, Nov. 21, 1992). Last year, l^ramount took the heat from retailers when it sold \"Wayne's World,\" \"The Addams Family,\" \"Ghost,\" and \"Charlotte's Web\" to the fast-food chain (Bill- board, May 22, 1993).

Berry became a Heatseeker Impact artist when the song went to No. 121 the following week; it contin- ues that upward movement, jumping to No. 102 on this week's chart SoundScan reports the album has sold 93,000 units to date.

White, working closely with producer (and RCA VP of A&R) Garth Fundis, has created the kind of focused record that could solve that problem. \"Lari's first album was a really fine record,\" says Fundis. \"It just didn't have that something that radio could embrace. What I tried to do with this record, without reining her in, was to give focus to Lari's direc- tion. We're trying to give radio some- thing they can work with and re- spond to, and then go from there.\" So far, that strategy seems to be working. The new album's leadoff single, \"That's My Baby,\" which shipped to radio March 21, is already faring better than any of White's pre- vious releases and is bulleted at No. 43 on Billboard's Hot Country Sin- gles & Tracks chart (Continued on page 101) Catching TTie Plane.

While at the hospital in Atlan- ta, Berry, who had been suffering from severe headaches, decided to undergo tests, and he was amazed to hear that he had a keloid cyst on his brain. He'll spend some time on the sidelines for surgery and recovery, but Berry is already preparing to hit the ground running upon his release from medKal care. \"The word is that John could re- sume normal activities within three or four weeks,\" says Bob Freese, Lib- erty's VP of marketing and sales. With the album's debut single, \"A Mind Of Her Own,\" Berry managed to reach only No. 51 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart The label's promotional persistence began to bear fruit with \"Kiss Me In The Car,\" the album's second release. \"We opened the doors for John with that single,\" says Freese. He re- calls that \"Kiss Me\" was still moving up the chart when Bill Catino, Liber- ty's senior VP of promotion, started getting feedback from radio about \"Yoiu- Love Amazes Me.\" Last December, when it started to look like that single \"might win radio over,\" the Liberty team called a brainstorming session with David Corlew of the Nashville-based Cor- lew O'Grady, Berry's management firm, and Bucky Williams of Monte- rey Artists, his booking agency. \"We sat down and said, 'OK, we've got a single here that we really be- lieve m, and radio has already told us they like it,' \" says Freese. \"We have since set up a micro-marketing cam- paign that we are going to blueprint for the rest of our developing artists. It has been absolutely fantastic.\" Following the company's strategy. Berry would arrive in a city the day before a concert, squeezing in as many radio and television appear- ances as possible, including acoustic performances on drive-time radio and MCA Inks Production Deal With Fort Apache Pact Brings Team's Modern Rock Savvy To Major I BY CRAIG ROSEN LOS ANGELES— In an effort to bring new rock acts to the label, MCA Records has signed a produc- tion deal with five producer/engi- neers who have produced numerous breakthrough modem rock acts at the Cambridge, Mass.-based Fort Apache studios. Under the agreement, Gary Smith, Paul Kolderie, Sean Slade, Tim O'Heir, and Lou Gurdano will sign and produce demos by new tal- ent, which they will present to MCA. The label will have the first look at any new talent discovered by the Fort Apache crew. MCA Records presklent Rrehard Palmese calls the deal \"one of the most important moves\" he has been involved with during his tenure as president of the label. \"If we pass, they have the right to take artists elsewhere,\" Palmese says. \"However, I can't imagine that we will pass on any of the art- ists they sign. This is a great group of talent scouts.\" Indeed, the Fort Apache crew has some notable credits. Smith, who co- owns the studio with singer/ guitar- ist Billy Bragg, manages Belly and Juliana Hatfield through his man- agement company Geronimo Man- agement He has produced a num- ber of acts, including Hatfield, the Pixies, the Feelies, the Connells, Throwing Muses, Blake Babies, Bragg, the Chills, and Pylon.

The artist received two ACM tro- phies this year his fourth consecu- tive award as entertainer of the year and the top country video award for \"We Shall Be Free,\" directed by Tim Miller. In addition, his wife Sandy deliv- ered their second child, August Anna, just moments before the awards tele- cast wrapped. Brooks, who did not at- tend the awanls, was unable to ap- pear via satellite on the telecast as originally scheduled. TTie three-hour telecast, which has been a ratings winner for NBC in the past, logged its lowest prime-time scores on record this year, according to numbers supplied by the A.C. Niel- sen Co.

It remains unclear what the exact distribution relationship will be, but sources indicate that Island Records may play an integral part in the new arrangement. It also is understood that the wide-ranging deal includes film projects and other rights. Under the impending deal. Def Jam will retain all rights to its cata- log, which includes multiplatinum ti- tles by Public Enemy, L.L. Cool J, and the Beastie Boys. Similar to Def Jam's deal with Sony's Columbia label, the new agreement will give PolyGram an equity stake in the company. All parties involved are refusing to comment on the transaction until the final terms are settled, but one source describes the departure from Sony as amicable and says that the move could occur within the next 30 days; June 1 has been mentioned as a target date. It has been indicated that all em- ployees of RAL/Def Jam will remain in place. The first act scheduled for release by Def Jam under the new arrange- ment is rapper Warren G, whose 12- track album, \"Regulate . . . G Funk Era,\" is set to drop June 5.

In total, the April 6 birthday bash, which featured a star-studded lineup of artists asso- ciated with the label, has spawned spin-offs in five formats. First up is the PBS broadcast, a joint production by Carnegie Hall, Thirteen/WNET, and PolyGram Di- versified Entertainment in associa- tion with NHK, Japan's public televi- sion system. Titled \"Carnegie Hall Salutes The Jazz Masters,\" the 90- minute program is drawn from a high-definition taping of the two- hour-plus concert. According to Da- vid Horn, series producer for \"Great Performances,\" all but two artists from the concert are included in the program. PolyGram's point of view is more complete. The label will follow the PBS airing with its own laserdisc and VHS video releases that document nearly the entire show; each is about 120 minutes long. In addition, the la- bel is issuing a 76-minute audio vei^ sion of the concert on CD and cas- sette. PolyGram's audio and video re- leases will be marketed under the \"Carnegie Hall\" title with the subti- tle \"Verve Records At 50.\" This will distinguish the releases from the PBS program. The titles will be mar- keted to a mainstream audience, with a price structiu* that is decidedly top- of-the-line; CDs, $16.98; cassettes, $10.98; laserdisc, $34.95; and VHS, $24.95. \"We're going for the broadest pos- sible consumer base,\" says Greg Bar bero, director of marketing for Poly- Gram Classics and Jazz. \"In national print, we'll tap the 'Great Perfor- (Continued on page 99) AUDRETCH HUGHES Nina Bueti is promoted to manag- er of international for Jive/Silvertone Records in New York.

Artists & Music London Has 'Jewel' In Solo Sister Marcella Detroit Bows Post-Shakespear Set I BY PAUL SEXTON LONDON — As former Shakespear's SLster member Marcella Detroit steps up to the plate v.iih her debut solo sin- gle, \"I Believe,\" going to top 40 June 16, PolyGram Label Group senior di- rector of marketing Jeb Hart is hoping for some immediate result*. \"We've all felt for a k>ng time that this is a one-listen record that will cover several formats,\" he enthuses of the track, a No. 11 hit in March in the U.K., where Detroit's career was nur- tured during her days in Rhakespear's Sister with Siobhan Pahey and where her sok) venture has already had great acceptance. Although PLG is apparently in the process of being restructured. De- troit's album, \"Jewel,\" on the London imprint, is still expected to come out June 21, as scheduled (Billboard, Mav 7). Detroit's first album since splitting with Fahey showcases her multi-in- strumental talents on various musical styles, from pop to funk to ballads. \"I come from ShaJtespear's Sister, but I still have other influences: classical, Beatles, Motown influences,\" says De- troit. 'They're much more naked on this record.\" The album includes Detroit's duet with Elton John on \"Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing,\" just released as the second U.K. single and also fea- tured on John's current \"Duet\" set, al- though Hart .says this will probably not be the second U.S. release. Detroit, bom with the surname of Levy but who adopted the city of her birth as her stage name, was a .song- writing and touring veteran long be- fore Sister, most notably writing \"Lay MARCELLA DETROIT Mercury Makes A Home For Page's 'House Of Stone' Set ■ BY MEUNDA NEWMAN NEW YORK— If one can tell a man by the company he keeps, Martin Page is in good stead these days. Among those joining the noted songwriter on his Mercury solo de- but, \"In The House Of Stone And Light,\" are Robbie Robert- son, Phil Collins, the Blue Nile's Paul Joseph Moore, Geoffrey PAGE Oryema, and Brenda Russell. As a songwriter. Page has written or co-written songs for Robertson (\"Fallen Angel\"). Go West (\"King Of Wishful Thinking\"), Heart (\"These Dreams\"), and Starship (\"We Built This City\"), among others. But none of those tunes approaches the emo- tional depth, honestly, and maturity behind his solo songs. \"When I wrote with other people, I took on their feelings. For the first time. I've been thinking about me,\" Page says. \"I've been waiting for this moment. Those were all a pre- lude (to this]. I'm very proud of [the earlier material], but I felt like I was at university. Now I have the rision and confidence to know how to do my own music.\" With a craggy voice that recalls Peter Gabriel or Sting, Page deliv- ers personal songs on the July 26 re- lease that draw from a lyrical well at times spiritual and uplifting, at other times destitute. The words weave through the layered, textured melodies. The songs were written by Page alone, except for a pair penned with Bernie Taupin.

Country Can Take Or Leave Manhattan; Where's Buck Owens When You Need Him? UF THINGS COUNTRY: Though the perception lingers that New York City and country music are mutually exclu- sive, fans once again proved otherAise during last week's Country Hoot, the cor>clusion of Carnegie Hall's Third An- nual Folk Festival. The show's title, something of a misnomer, should have been Bluegrass Hoot. The venue was full, and the audience hooted and hollered for the Johnson Mountain Boys' har- monies and excellent mandolin and violin playing; Alison Krauss* angelic voice, the sweetest this side of Emmylou Harris; and Ricky Skaggs* spirited renditions of bluegrass standards. If artists like these, who get New York-area airplay onty via an occa- sional cut on National Public Radio or university specialty shows, man- age to draw such a crowd, shouldn't other, more mainstream country artists be playing here too? In all candor, we're starting to get an in- feriority complex. Maybe country artists don't like Manhattanites as much as they pretend to. The truth is, most artists seem a little scared of New York City, preferring to play Long Island. Any booking agent who thinks a Long Island gig counts as an all-encom- passing New York-area date should be forced to schlep out to Nassau Coliseum or Westbur^' Music Fair via public transportation. It can be done, but it ain't pretty. Additionally, unions and other factors diive costs higher in the city than elsewhere, and many artists are loath to increase their ticket prices in a market where they're un- certain of their drawing power in the first place. The theon,' that artists and agents, rather than the audi- ences, are perpetuating this myth is backed up by the de- mise of \"Country Takes Manhattan,\" last year's successful 10-day music festh'al featuring artists ranging from Dolly to Billy Ray to Wynonna. Perhaps it was just post-con- cert afterglow, but following 1993's event, organizers at Radio City Music Hall Productions were ah'eady planning the 1994 shows (Billboard, June 5, 1993). So what happened? According to Radio City executK'e producer Scott Sanders, when he started making calls for this year's \"Country Takes Manhattan,\" Nashville gave him the cold shoulder. Despite last year's growing pains, including \"having to overpay some of the artists to get them to play,\" Sanders says he wanted to make \"Country Takes Manhattan\" an annual event. \"But then we started running into road- blocks. I wanted artists to tell their managers and agents to make sure they're part of 'Country Takes Manhattan* and that they were routed in the Northeast in May, but we just weren't getting that kind of support\" Sanders acknowledges that, because of costs, artists can't make the kind of money in the city that they can make by Melinda Newman elsewhere, and adds, 'The big headtiners also weren't will- ing to come [into the city] and be part of a festival.\" Sanders admits that he is \"disappointed\" by the festi- val's disappearing act, but says the experience proved to him that country music does work within the city limits, and that Radio City will continue to book country shows on an indi\\idual basis in venues throughout Manhattan. Another reason artists may avokl coming here is that small matter of radio. The orily game in town is WYNY. In the latest Ar^)itrons, WYNY had a 2.1 share 12-plus for winter \"94, finishing 20th in the New York market It ranked 14th in the Nassau-Suffolk (Long Island) rat^ ings, with a 3.1 share (Billboard, ^ril 30). We don't blame artists for thinking, \"Yikes, th^ don't want us here,\" even though we believe the low numbers are more a reflection of WYNY's programming than the public's aversion to twang. We predict that the numbers will sink fiirther, given WYNY's recent programming switch from 50% to 70% recurrent as well as its slashing of the current playlist from 45 titles to 25. WYNY is just as likely to play \"Meet Me In Montana\" by Dan Seals and Marie Osmond or ''I Was Country (When Country Wasn't Ox)l)\" by Barhara Mandrell during morning drive as any current song out- side of its main 25 titles. I know, because I've heard both songs plenty in the last few weeks. While prospective country station operators may take WYNY's low numbers as proof that country doesn't work in New York, the maricet is ripe for a sav\\y programmer who could treat New Yorkers like adventurous, urbane country fans instead of spoon-feeding the listeners old hits by names some consultant believes they will recognize. Can't someone persuade Buck Owens, who already owtis se\\'eral radio outlets, to come here and start a competing 8tatk>n? That way we could convince the artists and the station owners in one fell swoop that we like country mu- sic— we really, really do. This and THAT: Among those acts slated to play Bethel '94 are Fleetwood Mac. Ray Charles, Michael McDonald, Leon Russell, Hugh Masekela, James Brown, Richie Havens, Melanie, John Sebastian, Blood Sweat & Tears, Judy Collins, Grand Funk Railroad, and Tom Paxton, according to organizer Sid Bernstein. Additionally, Bernstein is booking \"undisco- vered\" bands like London-based Spanglehead for the Aug. 13-14 festival. Bernstein says he expects to be awarded a temporary permit \"imminently\" . . .

The duo's long- anticipated second American album, \"Tales FYom The Urban Prairie,\" due June 21 from Epic Records, fiirther ce- ments that reputation. \"We've never been in a scene, which I think is good,\" says Hancock, the group's guitarist. \"If we'd been a Mandtester scene band, we woukln't be able to put out records now, because ev- eryone thinks that's boring. We're just musical sponges: More than anything, I think we celebrate the klea of pop.\" The act's lush sound — a blend of folk and power-pop elements — was first introduced to stateside audiences on 1991's \"Flying Down To Mono Valley,\" though the album failed to establish an American base for the Popinjays. \"Our initial efforts will be in creating an awareness at retail — especially mom-and-pop outlets,\" says Epic prod- uct manager Ari Martin. \"That's where we have the more active consumer of independent music, so we're going to emphasize the connection with One Little Indian [the British indie from which 'Urtan Prairie' is licensed).\" Martin adds that Epic is readying a retail-oriented four-color newsletter and CD sampler that will feature the Popinjays' first single — \"When I Be- lieved In You\" — as well as other One Little Indian acts. \"This is the perfect climate for a record like this to do well, given the success of female-fronted bands like the Cranberries.\" WhUe Robinson's lilting voice is cer- tainly airwave-ready, the biting lyrics of songs like \"Queen Of The Parking Lot\" and \"Kentish Town\" have a decid- edly earthier bent than most of the band's modem pop peers. That, ac- cording to Hancock, comes from the self-professed musical sponges' recent immersion in old-school country music. \"The more we thought about this record, the more in common we saw with country musk,\" she says. \"It's not POPINJAYS: Wendy Robinson and Polly Hancock. like, \"Oh, we're just country girls,' but there's a metaphor in the title that goes throughout the album — about the dty as the new prairie. It's there in the mu- sic as well: One thing 1 love about coun- try is its ability to make cliche sound new.\" The Popinjays have managed to steer clear of cliche since day one, when they solicited a deal from One Little Indian by sending a packet of homemade fanzines and fliers in lieu of a tape. The band was promptly signed. \"Our ambitions were to get a record out, get in the NME, and get on the John Peel show,\" says Hancock. \"We did all that in four months, and then [we] wondered where we could go from there.\" At the moment, it would appear that the Popinjays' next destination is America, where the band has never toured. Epic's Martin acknowledges, \"It's very important to reinforce in people's minds that this is a real, work- ing band, not just a pop act\" Hancock is enthusiastic about doing just that \"We're hoping to have projec- tions and all sorts of things to put across the ambience of the album,\" she says. \"I'm curious to see how it will go down o\\'er there. On our last trip, all we really did was go from town to town having lunch. The lunch was fantastic, but we're looking forward to mo\\ing beyond that this time.\" Africa Fete Tour Returns To U.S. World Music Series Begins July 21 NEW YORK— The success of last year's Africa Fete tour, which brought several world music acts to the U.S. in a musical roadshow, has led to a repeat of the series here. The tour will start July 21 in up- state New York and conclude l(i dates later at the Reggae On The River festi\\'a] in Redway, Calif. Two acts from last year's bill, Mango Records artists Angelique Kidjo from Benin and Ismael Lo from Senegal, will return to the festi- Vdl. They will be joined by creole-fla- vored fellow Mango act Ziskakan, whose monbers hail from Isle Reun- ion, an island near Madagascar, and by popular African band Kassav, which is on the TriStar label. When Africa F6te landed on U.S. shores last year, it fulfilled Island Records CEO Chris Blackwell's de- sire to bring the celebration to North America. Africa Fete was begun in Paris in 1978 by Mamadou Konte and has grown into a weeklong celebra- tion there. Last year's festival featured acts only on Island Records' Mango im- print, though Blackwell said he wxHild be open to imiting other labels' acts to participate (Billboard. June 5, 1993). That has happened this year with the inclusion of Kassav. Africa Fete will be produced in the U.S. by French businessman Pascal Imbert, with assistance from Peggy Dold, VP of marketing for Island In- dependents, and Island national tour director Karen Yee. 16 BILLBOARD MAY 14, 1994 UCR Chrome HCX Cobalt Typ SKX Premium Ferric SH Standard Ferric Professional Audio Duplicating Tape SKMA PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS & 199/1 SKMA, Inc. 1041 Via Oro Avenue, l ong Beach, CA 90810 1-800-331-5729 Outside CA 1-800-237-8372 Copyrighted Artists & Music You demand experience and commitment behind the scenes.

For All IheConunlhmnts You Make* Bolton Plans A Challenge Of Isley Song Ruling ■ BY BRETT ATWOOD LOS ANGELES— The legal battle between Michael Bolton and the Is- ley Brothers may not be over. Bol- ton's attorney will seek a post-trial motion within three weeks to ovei^ turn a jury's finding that the artist stole parts of the Isley Brothers song \"Love Is A Wonderful Thing\" for his 1991 hit of the same name (Billboard, May 7). Meanwhile, Gerard Fox, attorney for plaintiff Three Boys Music Corp., says that the case could go on for \"months, even years\" as Sony, Bolton, co-writer Andrew Gold- mark, and Warner/ Chappell are forced to open their accounting books to determine income from sin- gle and album sales, as well as li- censing. On April 29, a jury in federal court here awarded the Isleys 66% of all royalties from sales of the Bol- ton single and 28% of royalties from sales of the multiplatinum album \"Time, Love & Tenderness.\" \"This is all a bit scary,\" Bolton said in an interview with Billboard. \"Unless a song is a hit, we can't be expected to know every recording by a major artist If this [decision] sets a precedent, then the system has failed.\" Bolton expressed concern about the lack of physical proof present- ed to the jury. He said the plaintiff failed to establish that Bolton had access to the relatively obscure re- cording, which was released in 1966. \"You would think that with three years of preparation, the plaintiff could come up with some form of physical evidence that I had access to this song,\" said Bol- ton. \"There were no BMI royalty statements. There was no physical proof of airplay of any kind. The jury didn't understand the signifi- cance of this lack of evidence.\" Bolton also emphasized that his song did not appear on an album until one year after he and Gold- mark penned the tune. The Isleys' song was included on the 1991 EMI release \"The Isley Brothers: The Complete U.A. Sessions.\" Fox estimates that the settle- ment amount will end up \"proba- bly somewhere between $2 million and $8 million, but it could go as high as $15 million.\" Bolton stirred up a bit of contro- versy at a New York press confer- ence Monday when he attributed part of the jury's reasoning to race, pointing out that four of the jurors were African-American. \"That's scraping the bottom of the barrel,\" Ronald Isley told Bill- board after being informed of Bol- ton's remark. \"He lost the case. Why is he bringing [race] into the music?\" It had not been determined at press time whether the plaintiffs would receive a percentage of for- eign royalties. Also to be deter- mined is whether damages will come from pre- or post-tax profits. 18 BILLBOAHD MAY M. 1994 Artists & Music Hardly Bourne Yesterday, Publisher Celebrates 75th Bourne to UVE: At the age of 31 in 1919, Irving Berlin was al- ready a household name as a song- writer. Eight years before, he creat- ed a worldwide sensation with his song \"Alexander's Ragtime Band.\" His other hits by 1919 also included \"Play A Simple Melody,\" \"When I Lost You,\" \"Oh, How I Hate To Get Up In The Morning,\" \"You'd Be Surprised,\" and \"When The Mid- night Choo-Choo Leaves For Ala- bam',\" among others. Berlin, one of the founders of performance rights society ASCAP in 1914, also \"Bye Bye Blues,\" \"That Old Gang Of Mine,\" \"Wabash Moon,\" and \"Gimme A Little Kiss.\" In 1957, Saul Bourne died and his his wife, Bonnie, took over, to be replaced by her daughter Bebe in 1993 when Bonnie died. With its catalog of perennials, in- cluding songs by Charlie Chaplin {e.g., \"Smile\"), Bourne continues to make chart news, the most recent example of which was the revival smash of Irving Gordon's \"Unfor- gettable,\" which, through the mag- ic of technology, had Natalie Cole singing the was a pioneer among song- writers who went into the publishing busi- ness to house their own songs — he had formed a pub- lishing company the year that ASCAP was estab- lished. So in 1919, in partnership with Saul Bernstein — who would later shorten his last name to Bourne — and Max Winslow, he formed a new company, Irving Berlin Inc., which, in addition to his own works, would publish the songs of his peers. Berlin's main task, of course, was to contribute more hits to the catalog, while Bourne acted as busi- ness manager and seeker of song- writing talent, and Winslow mainly did songplugging. The Irving Berlin name lives on in music publishing. It is today ad- ministered by Williamson Music, as is a company spun off in 1944 when Berlin and Bourne ended their part- nership (Winslow had died earlier). This was a split in more ways than one: Berlin took his own song creations, and Bourne was left with songs, many of them already stan- dards, other than those written by Berlin. The circumstances of this rather unusual parting of the ways is one of continuing speculation and con- troversy. In his biography of Berlin, \"As Thousands Cheer,\" Laurence Bergreen suggests that it was brought to Berlin's attention that Bourne had created fictitious song- writer contracts in order to gener- ate income for himself; however, another point of view says that Bourne, as the firm's business man- ager, resented special rates Berlin would offer on his own copyrights. Whatever the reasons for the breakup. Bourne Music, starting off with non-Berlin songs published under the partnership, can claim a birthright of 75 years in 1994 — it definitely can mark its 50th anniver- sary this year. Of course, the company's catalog has grown beyond its 1944 hoMings, which by that time included the publishing rights to songs from such Walt Disney classics as \"Snow White,\" \"Pinocchio,\" and \"Dumbo\" and such Tin Pan Alley standbys as Words&Music by In Lichtman song in a 1991 \"duet\" with her dad, the late Nat King Cole, who had the original hit ver- sion of the song in 1951. Years before, a 1926 copyright, Roy Turk and Lou Handman's \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" had en- tered the rock'n'roll era with a bang with Elvis Presley's 1956 rendition. A year ago, a sentimental rem- nant of Bourne Music's past resur- faced. \"In the '50s, dad thought of a slogan for the company, 'Music Bourne To Live,' \" says Bebe Bourne. \"Some years later, it was dropped. But I thought it was catchy, and so I picked it up again.\" R&B WORKSHOP: The 1994 ASCAP East Coast R&B Songwrit- ers' Workshop is set for June 22 from 6 a.m.-9:30 p.m. at the soci- ety's New York headquarters.

STAR TV STEPS IN AS MTV ASIA GOES OFF AIR (Continued from page 8) But MTV Networks chairman Tom Freston told Billboard that revenues were not a stumbling bk)ck. What was at issue, he says, was an \"inability to agree over programming rights and some minor accounting problems. Wliat Star was providing was nickels and dimes to us. If they think this [problem] was a revenue thing, you can understand the gulf between us.\" Local content apparently was a longstanding problem. Throughout most of the relationship, according to insiders, MTV executives had fought Star's decision to introduce non-En- glish programming that went beyond Western mainstream music, which neverthless had made Star into Asia's most powerful cross-border musk influence. The day Star dropped MTV's logo, it introduced a northern signal in Mandarin, and a southern signal in English and Hindi. Both use videos by topflelling Western acts, but are turning slowly to more local content The northern signal offers three hours of Chinese videos daily, and will eventually expand to eight hours. The southern signal broadcasts one hour of Hindi film music, as well as some Chinese music, although Hindi programming will soon move to a four-hour format According to Freston, the rights Star got from MTV were only for a pan-Asian, English-language chan- nel. \"We withheld rights for things like Mandarin programming because we knew we were going to divorce form Star and wanted those rights for ourselves,\" he says. When the new MTV channel takes to the air — via a Chinese sateUite, Ap- st^ 1, to be launched this summer — the programming is expected to be more or less the same as Star's, in- cluding a scrambled Mandarin signal. As a backup, MTV has reserved a transponder on the Pan-Am satellite. MTV also is negotiating for space on a Singapore cable network. Industry sources say it will cost the U.S. com- pany $5 mi]lion-$10 million, based on investments made by Star, to reen- ter the market \"We are willing to invest tens of mil- lions of dollars [to get back in]. We've done our homework and are confident of our ability to craft a product for Asian customers,\" says Freston. He added that MTV was actively looking for minority partners for ground sup- port and ICK) new employees in prepa- ration for the relaunch. MTV has no contractual right to any videos in Asia, especially high- profile Western clips that are con- trolled by regional headquarters of the international record companies through an IFPI iKensing deal that runs until 1997. The majors say they would not withhold videos from legit- imate customers. \"We can compete with the record companies as long as they don't act in a cartel fashion,\" says Freston. According to Freston, MTV ended its arrangement with Star because, \"We did not want to rent our name to another company for something we feel we can do for ourselves. The Asian market is going to be huge in a few years, and we want to be part of it as MTV, not as a subsumed identity.\" He adds that 18 months ago MTV realized \"there were inherent prob- lems\" in its arrangement with Star. \"We were never in control of the agenda,\" Freston says. \"There was an absence of market information coming from Star.\" Star executives say they became so exasperated with MTV's demands during talks that they were left with no choice but to go their own way. Because final papers for the new mu- sic service have not yet been signed, Star executives would only talk with a guarantee of anonymity about the breakup. \"[MTV executives] have contin- ually shown an utter inability to un- derstand how business works here,\" says one. \"What they wanted out of Star in terms of programming would have virtually killed any chance of fu- ture ad revenues. \"When will they realize that you can't run programming for Asia, or other regions for that matter, out of an office in Manhattan?

Williams Stevie Wonder HILARY ROSEN (Continued from page 8) in the music community that have served it vfelL\" As was suggested when he was promoted last year, Herman will like- ly focus more on the international marketplace, while Rosen will con- centrate on domestic policy. \"Jay has gotten more invohred in recent years in the international pro- grams [as] so much of the [future] growth of the companies we repre- sent will be based on international sales,\" says Rosen. \"He's become an incredible ambassador around the world for the record industry and the plan is to maximize him in those ar^ eas.\" However, Rosen adds that Berman will still have input in stateside mat- ters. \"His sense of political strategy and his contacts are critical for our continued success,\" she says. Under her presidency, Rosen plans for the RLAA to keep \"on the road we've been on with some continued forward thinking.\" Her immediate goals for 1994 are \"passage of the performance right bill, creatwn of a strong piracy pro- gram against suppliers of counterfeit products, and d^ing with the piracy in China.\" Most of these initiatives are already under way. A long-term goal, says Rosen, \"is assuring that as we move into the in- formation superhighway environ- ment, that our companies are maxi- mizing their distribution potential and income . . . The reality is that this infrastructure is being created. We lax>w how the music is going to be used and distributed, so it's a matter of how people are going to get paid.\" Rosen, who is involved in social causes such as the Human Rights Campaign Fund, says she would also like to launch a publicity campaign that highlights the good works of the RIAA's member music corporations. \"We have the most generous indus- try in the country aiKl I think that the public and policy makers don't realize it,\" she says. \"I want to take on the role of the RIAA being the booster of the extraordinary amount of good works that are already going on, in addition to creating some new ones ... I see this not just as a one-time publicity campaign, but as part of the ongoing RIAA mission.\" On an in-house level, Rosen says that \"in seven years, the RIAA's bud- get has doubled and oiu- stalf has al- most doubled. A significant part of my job will be managing that growth and [seeing that] we have a coordi- nated approach to meeting [the rec- ord companies'] needs.\" The RIAA has 58 staffers. Al- though some of her previous day-to- day activities will be transferred to other employees, Rosen says she does not expect any new positions to be created. Pnor to joining the RIAA in 1987, Rosen operated her own consulting firm. Before that, she was a VP for Liz Robbins Associates, a Washing- ton lobbying firm. Rosen serves on the boards of the National Music Council, Rock The Vote, and the Human Rights Cam- paign Fund. She is also a conunissxm- er on the D.C. Commission on the Arts and the Humanities. 20 BIIXBOARD MAY 14, 1994 WHERE MONA USA MEETS \"THE KID ff SI The new X'EYE Multi Entertainment System from JVC plays Sega Genesis™ & Sega CD''\", Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia'\", Electronic Books, Karaoke CDs, CD+G Graphics, and Music CDs.

Ci ; iterial Artists & Music iifi mm Motown mngirrilerii Brian Holland, Eddie Holland, and Lamont Dozier were at the peak of their creative powers in the Hummer of 'S5 when the Four Tops took their \"It's The Same Old Song\" to No. .5. On his \"Hig Horizon \" album, singer 'songwriter David Wilcox unplugs and unearths some hidden aspects of this timeless classic. Edited By Peter Cronin IT'S THE SAME OLD SONG Published by Stone Agate Music (BMl) 'To me, the magic of doing a song again is putting it in a different emotional con- text,\" Wilcox says. \"It changes the light- ing. You're looking at the same thing, but the lighting is so different that you go, 'Ah,' and it's like seeing it for the first time. In some ways, I think you can tell more about somebody when they do a cover, because you get their spin on something. I always imagined the song that is referred to in 'It's The Same Old Song.' The story line is that there are two lovers who always used to listen to this old song, and they used to just kind of let the words go by. 'Then, when the re- lationship is over, suddenly this guy is lis- tening and he hears the words for the fu^t time. It's as if the song had been trying to tell him all along what was going to hap- pen. The song has this wisdom that he wasn't ready to hear, so when he finally heai-s it after the split it's like, 'Ouch, how could I not have known?' I love getting in- side other musicians' hearts and minds. It feels like archaeolog}' when you learn a song and really slow it down and get ex- actly what they're doing. By walking in some el.se's footsteps like that, you can re- ally get inside their .state of mind.\" ARTISTS IN ACTION SALIF KEITA Wiljskirv Theater, Beveriy HilU Calif. SaLIF KEITA'S remarkable rise to stardom has become the stuff of legend among wor\\6 music fans. As an albino bom into a family directly descended from one of the great kings of the an- cient Malian empire, the odds were heavily against Keita's pursuing, let alone succeeding in, a musical career in what was still a caate-ridden society. Yet, after some 25 years in the busi- ness, he has become one of the most celebrated singers to emerge frran the Mother Continent. Playing the second of 13 dates on his first U5. tour, Keita and his nine-piece band brought the house to its feet in a 90-minute-plus set here that aroused the crowd's funk instincts on some tunes, and hypnotically pulled it into the mysticism on others. His Paris- based, Pan-African group adroitly handled Keita's techno-roots material. Leading the way was master guitarist Ousmane Kouyate, a front man in his own right and a frequent collaborator with Keita, whose careening runs and percussive riffs often emulate*! such griot instruments as the tcora harp-lute and balafon vibraphones. While many vocalists struggle to make thonselves heard in a live mix, Keita had no trouble penetrating the Afro-global -fusion polygrooves laid down by his accompanists. He some- times struck a contemplative pose, his head bowed and hands clasped in prayerful supplication, while other times he stomped and whirled across the wide stage. One of Keita's early signature tunes, \"Mandjou,\" pro\\ided a puissant con- trast of trance and fire. Between the singer's peaks of passion, trumpeter Peter Tholo Segono sweetly squeezed out muted tones k la Miles Da\\is v^liile guitarist Kouyate traced ancient-fu- ture lines over reggae-like rhjlhms an- chored by bassist NDoumb^ Djengu^.
