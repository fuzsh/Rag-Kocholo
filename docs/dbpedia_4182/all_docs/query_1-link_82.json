Experts\n\nies such as New York and Los Angeles, while many upwardly mobile young Latinos have successfully integrated themselves into U.S. society. Many younger Latinos were raised without a speaking knowledge of Spanish. Another reason why Latino culture may be overlooked may be the great diversity it encompasses. Unlike many minorities in this country, Latino Americans do not come from one country or region but from 18 different nations and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, a part of the United States. While the great majority of Latino Americans trace their roots to Mexico, Puerto Rico, or Cuba, there are significant numbers of them from Central and South America and the Caribbean, especially the Dominican Republic. Each of these peoples has its own culture and traditions, although they all, with a few exceptions, share a common language, Spanish, brought by the explorers and missionaries of Spain who first “discovered” and colonized these lands. But it is not only a language that they share. The 178 artists in this book represent both performing artists (actors, musicians, singers, dancers, comedians) and visual artists (painters, sculptors, filmmakers, photographers, and other fine artists). The selection is not exhaustive and is meant to be a cross section of Latino artists, not a definitive list. That would take a much larger book, if not a series of them. The author has tried to highlight artists who have been pioneers or innovators in\n\nhave predicted that by the year 2100, one in three U.S. residents will be Latino. Everywhere you look in the United States today Latinos are exercising their newfound power. Economically, the Latino market is estimated at more than $636 billion annually. In politics, Latino Americans are becoming a powerful voting block. Mexican-American governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico is a leader in the National Democratic Party. In 2004, the first Latino senators in 25 years were elected in Florida and Colorado. In May 2005, Democrat Antonio Villarigosa was elected mayor of the country’s second-largest city, Los Angeles (LA), California. He is the first Latino mayor of LA in 133 years. Latino culture, arts, and architecture are a dominant force in the Southwest, southern Florida, and much of California. Yet, a visit to your local library will reveal surprisingly few books about Latinos. While the section devoted to African-American culture, literature, and issues is a full one, that for Latino Americans is bare in comparison. How can this be for the nation’s largest minority? There are a number of reasons for this neglect. For many North Americans, Latinos are the invisible minority. Socially and culturally, many older Latinos have largely kept to themselves in large cit-\n\nvii\n\nialtfm.indd vii\n\n3/23/07 8:14:36 AM\n\nviii Latinos in the Arts their field and those who reflect Latino culture and traditions. While the greatest number of people in this book are Mexican, Cuban, or Puerto Rican in ancestry, Spain is also represented, as is nearly every South American country and several Central American nations. At the same time, the author has confined himself to artists who were born in the United States or who settled here permanently after emigrating from a Latin country. Puerto Rican artists who reside in Puerto Rico and not on the mainland have not been included. Several Brazilian-born artists have been included even though Brazil, settled by the Portuguese, is not a Spanish-speaking Latino country. But Brazilians are in spirit and culture closely connected to their Latin neighbors. Besides, what performer better represented Latin America in the United States in the 1940s than Brazilian movie musical star Carmen Miranda? A few words need to be said about terminology. Why do we use Latino and not Hispanic in this book? For many years, Hispanic was the preferred term, applied to Americans from Mexico, the Caribbean, and South and Central America. Hispanic is derived from España (Spain), the country that conquered the indigenous peoples and col-\n\nialtfm.indd viii\n\nonized their lands in the 16th and 17th centuries. For many contemporary people, Hispanic smacks of a colonialism that they would rather forget. Latino does not apply to Spain but rather to the Latin ancestry of the Spanish language. Of course, there are people, including some of the individuals in this book, who reject the term Latino as well. But, in general, it seems to be the more acceptable term in today’s world. When speaking specifically of a female artist, the word Latina is used, and Latino is used for a male artist. Finally, there is Chicano. The word is more than a short form of Mexican American. It is also a political and historic term that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s when it was used by United Farm Workers (UFW) leader Cesar Chavez (César Chávez) to identify the underprivileged Mexican Americans whom he represented in California and the Southwest. The Chicano art movement that came about in those years was closely identified with the greater Chicano struggle, and many of the artists who were a part of it still proudly consider themselves Chicanos or Chicanas. For some younger artists and performers, the term is not a part of their experience and has less relevance.\n\n3/23/07 8:14:37 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞\n\n“[W]\n\nhat seems to me particularly notable is not the diversity of the Hispanic groups and the differences among them,” writes the Mexican writer Octavio Paz, “but rather their extraordinary cohesion, a cohesion not expressed politically but in collective acts and attitudes.” This cohesion is dramatically apparent when considering Latino artists. While these creative men and women are all individuals with their own personal means of expression, for many of them their ethnic roots have played a significant role in their careers. Certain common themes reoccur in their work. Among these themes, especially for the visual artists, are the traditions and spiritual elements of the Roman Catholic Church, first brought to Latin America in the 16th century by the missionaries who accompanied explorers and conquistadores. This influence can be most clearly seen in the Santeros of the Southwest. Their expressive wooden carvings of Jesus, Mary, and the saints, go back to the 18th-century artist Pedro Antonio Fresquís and continues down to such contemporary practitioners as Luis Tapia and Charles M. Carrillo. Religious imagery and symbols can be seen in the more secular art of a wide range of contemporary artists from the dark fatalistic paintings of CubanAmerican Carlos Alfonzo to the more celebratory altar arrangements dedicated to famous Latinas of Mexican-American Amalia Mesa-Bains.\n\nAnother theme that runs through Latino art is the struggle for social justice. The crusade for Chicano rights that began with Cesar Chavez in the 1960s gave birth to an art movement that included posters, murals, sculptures, and paintings by such socially committed artists as Victor Ochoa, Frank Romero, Patssi Valdez, and Andrew Zermeño. Many of these artists moved on to more personal artistic expression, but many retain their commitment to social change in the United States for Latinos and other minorities. Filmmakers such as Luis Valdez and Moctesuma Esparza also sprang from the Chicano movement of the 1960s, while many Latino actors have played the role of social activists both on and off the screen. Their number include Raúl Juliá; Ricardo Montalbán, founder of Nosotros, an organization that promotes and encourages Latinos in the entertainment industry; Esai Morales; Edward James Olmos; Martin Sheen; and Jimmy Smits. Some actors—such as Olmos, Andy Garcia, Salma Hayek, and Jennifer Lopez—have gained the power as directors and producers to initiate their own film projects that focus on Latino history, concerns, and issues. This influence has only recently been earned. Early Latino entertainers, particularly in the film and television industries, were most often trapped in limited stereotypical roles that tended to denigrate their culture and people. These included the Mexican spitfire (Lupe Vélez, Rita Moreno); the exotic female ix\n\nialtfm.indd ix\n\n3/23/07 8:14:38 AM\n\nx Latinos in the Arts (Raquel Torres, Dolores del Rio); the lazy, comic Mexican (Leo Carrillo); the zany Latin entertainer (Carmen Miranda, Olga San Juan); and the everpopular Latin lover (Fernando Lamas, Ricardo Montalbán). That all these performers managed to breathe life and personality into these stereotypes that they were often forced to play speaks volumes about their talent and determination. Some of them, such as Montalbán and Moreno, eventually broke through the stereotype barriers to play a wide range of characters and become stars and role models for a new generation of Latino performers. Other actors achieved stardom by changing their names and not drawing attention to their Latino backgrounds. How many of their fans even today know that Rita Hayworth, Anthony Quinn, Martin Sheen, and Raquel Welch all have Latino roots?\n\nialtfm.indd x\n\nBy the same token, a number of Latino singers, including Joan Baez, Vikki Carr, Eydie Gormé, and Linda Ronstadt, rediscovered their roots relatively late in successful careers and found a new audience and market for their music. Other musicians, including Selena, Ricky Martin, and Gloria Estefan, moved effortlessly from Spanish-language music to mainstream American pop. As one reads about the lives of these Latino American artists, one may be surprised by the range of their talents and achievements, be inspired by their struggle to succeed, and be moved at how many of them have given back to the community that produced them. As Latino Americans take their rightful place in U.S. society, their stories need to be told and serve as models, not just for a new generation of Latinos but for all Americans. Their story is the story of the Americas—North and South.\n\n3/23/07 8:14:38 AM\n\nA\n\n⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞⠞\n\nAguilera, Christina (Christina Maria Aguilera) (1980– ) pop singer, songwriter\n\nyoung for the program. Two years later, now 12, she was invited to join the show. Among her fellow Mouseketeers were future stars Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. The show folded two years later, and Aguilera returned to Pittsburgh. Anxious to record, she sent a tape to a singing competition in Japan. The winner would record a duet with Japanese pop star Keizo Nakanishi. Aguilera won the competition and flew to Japan to record the song “All I Wanna Do” with Nakanishi. It became a major hit in Japan, and Aguilera went on tour with the Japanese singer. On her return to the States, Aguilera was asked to record the ballad “Reflection” from Disney’s latest animated feature, the Chinese saga Mulan (1998). The song was only a mild success on the adult contemporary charts, but its wide exposure in the movie led RCA Records to sign Aguilera to a recording contract. Her debut album, Christina Aguilera (1999), was a smash, immediately taking the #1 spot on the pop charts. One cut from the album, “Genie in a Bottle,” went to #1 on the singles’ charts and stayed there for five weeks. Two other album cuts, “What a Girl Wants” and “Come on over Baby (All I Want Is You),” both followed it to the top of the charts. The album eventually ended up selling 8 million copies. At the 42nd Grammy Awards, Britney Spears was expected to win in the category of Best New Artist. To the surprise of everyone, including Aguilera, she won the award.\n\nOne of the most celebrated female pop vocalists of the last decade, Christina Aguilera, with her four-octave range, has a voice and technique that surpasses most of her competitors. She was born Christina Maria Aguilera on Staten Island, a borough of New York City, on December 18, 1980. Her father, Fausto Aguilera, is from Ecuador and immigrated to the United States to serve in the military. Her mother, Shelley Fidler, of Irish descent, is a gifted violinist who played with the Youth Symphony Orchestra in her teens. The family moved frequently from one military post to another as Christina was growing up. The Aguileras separated in 1986, and Christina’s mother took her and a younger sister Rachel to live with her in Wexford, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, where she remarried. Christina already displayed a beautiful singing voice and from age six competed in local talent shows. In 1988, she appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search but did not win. However, she was a star in Pittsburgh, where she frequently sang the national anthem before games of the Pittsburgh Steelers football team and the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team. Aguilera auditioned for the New Mickey Mouse Club on TV’s Disney Channel in 1990, but despite her obvious talent, she was turned down as too\n\n1\n\n2 Aguilera, Christina\n\nPop singer Christina Aguilera’s career began as a Mouseketeer on the Disney Channel’s The New Mickey Mouse Club. (Photofest)\n\nHer next album was the Spanish language Mi Reflejo (My reflection) (2000). Aguilera was embraced by young Latino listeners and became that rare crossover from the pop to the Latino market, even though she did not speak Spanish and had to learn the lyrics phonetically. The album sold 3 million copies and earned her a second Grammy for Best Latin Artist. To consolidate her affinity for Latino music, she recorded a duet with pop star Ricky Martin, “Nobody Wants to Be Lonely,” in late 2000. It became a worldwide hit. Aguilera joined forces with four other female singers—Pink, Lil’ Kim, Mya, and Missy Elliott— to record a remake of the 1970s LaBelle hit “Lady Marmalade” for the soundtrack of the movie musi-\n\ncal Moulin Rouge (2001). It became another huge hit and earned her a third Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. After releasing a well-received Christmas album, My Kind of Christmas, Aguilera recorded Stripped (2002), an album that showed a new maturity in her singing and choice of material. She cowrote six of the songs and produced one. “Getting older, you just don’t want to sing fluffy,” she has said. “You just have more things to say about real life and real people and the bitterness that you get from people.” In 2003, Aguilera released the music video Dirrty, a performance of the hit song from her Stripped album. Tattoos, body piercings (most of which she had removed by 2004), and very sexy outfits have not hurt record sales, despite some controversy over her new raunchy image. Rolling Stone magazine has declared Dirrty the most played music video of all time. Aguilera is a spokesperson for Coke, Versace, and MAC–cosmetics. She won her fourth Grammy in 2004 for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her recording of “Beautiful.” She married music executive Jordan Bratman in November 2005. Her latest studio album, Back to Basics (2006), a scintillating blend of soul, jazz, and blues, presented a new, sophisticated Aguilera and was well received by the public and critics. A pop-music megastar around the world, Christina Aguilera believes she has the staying power of such role models as Julie Andrews and Whitney Houston. “I’m in it for the long run,” she said in a recent interview.\n\nFurther Reading Dominguez, Pier.

He was born Eduardo Lopez in Tijuana, Mexico, on April 16, 1964, the son of Mexican immigrants. His parents met in an English as a second language (ESL) class. Six weeks after his birth, the family moved to San Diego. As a child, Lopez drew constantly. He was inspired to draw comics after discovering Gus Arriola’s Gordo comic strip in the funny pages of the newspaper. By the late 1980s, he was drawing editorial cartoons under the name Lalo Alcaraz for L.A. Weekly, a Los Angeles Latino paper. His bold, larger-than-life style with its childlike captions attracted the attention of the Universal Press Syndicate, which picked up his one-panel editorial cartoon feature La Cucaracha (Spanish for “cockroach”). It was soon appearing twice weekly in more than 50 newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe. While his satire made people think about issues affecting Latinos, Alcaraz also wanted to educate. In 1990, he illustrated Latino USA: A Cartoon History, written by college professor Ilan\n\nStavan. Although witty and humorous in both artwork and text, the book took a serious look at Latinos in U.S. history. One critic called it “required reading for anyone interested in democratic inclusive history writing.” In 2002, Alcaraz transformed La Cucaracha into a daily narrative comic strip with ongoing characters. The central characters are Eddie Lopez, a reporter for bilingual Latino newspaper the Barrio Bugle, and radical Internet blogger Cuco Rocha. Like Garry Trudeau, creator of the comic strip Doonesbury, Alcaraz is not afraid to satirize American politicians and social issues head-on but does so with plenty of humor. “Some folks have asked me if I wouldn’t be happier in my ‘home country,’” he wrote in the introduction of a book collection of his cartoons. “I usually reply, ‘Dear moron, the United States is my home country, and yes, I wish I could be happier here.’ ” Although he is highly critical of government and its institutions, Alcaraz has a healthy skepticism toward just about everyone and everything— including himself. He has defined a political cartoonist as “an opinionated jerk with a pen.” Lalo Alcaraz has won numerous awards for his work, including four Southern California Journalism Awards for Best Cartoon in Weekly Paper. He is also the recipient of the Los Angeles Hispanic Public Relations Association’s Premio Award for Excellence in Communications. He lives and works in Los Angeles.\n\nFurther Reading Alcaraz, Lalo.

He was born in Havana, Cuba, on September 24, 1950. When dictator Fidel Castro took power in 1959, Alfonzo’s parents chose to remain in the new communist state that Castro established. Alfonzo’s artistic gifts exhibited themselves early, and in 1969, he entered the San Alejandro School of Fine Arts, Cuba’s most celebrated art academy. After graduating in 1973, he taught art briefly at art centers in the Havana region. He then studied art history at the University of Havana, receiving a degree in 1977. During this time, he had his first major solo exhibition at a Havana gallery. As an artist and a homosexual (a brief marriage ended in divorce), Alfonzo felt that his creativity was severely restricted in Castro’s regimented socialist state. In 1980, along with more than 10,000 other Cubans, he fled in a boat from Mariel Harbor, seeking political asylum in the United States. He settled in Miami, Florida, and found adjustment to his exiled state so difficult that he was unable to paint for a year. He eventually found work painting restaurant and hotel murals for an interior designer. He resumed his career as an artist and in 1982 traveled to New York, where he greatly admired the work of such American artists as Jackson Pollack and Mark Rothko. He tried to imitate their abstract expressionistic works but in a few years had developed his own unique figurative\n\nstyle. Alfonzo’s work became highly personal and was affected when he tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The closeness of death thereafter became a major theme in his work. His canvases were filled with symbolic images and figures that reflected his fascination with religions, damnation, and salvation. “My work has been nourished by two currents—one, the Cuban, of drama and chaos; and two, the American, of rationality and structure,” he once said. “Between these two currents my work grows.” Alfonzo was fascinated by the two central religions of Cuba—Roman Catholicism and Santeria, an African religion brought to the island by African slaves. His dark, dreamlike canvases were filled with religious imagery, including Catholic crucifixes and martyred saints as well as the axes and skulls imagery of Santeria. His work began to attract critical attention. He earned a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in Painting in 1984. In 1987, Alfonzo’s paintings were considered one of the highlights in the traveling exhibition Hispanic Artists in the United States, organized by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas. Wealthy art patron Craig Robin gave Alfonzo a spacious studio in Miami Beach, providing him at last with the economic freedom to devote himself full time to painting. More exhibitions in both solo and group shows followed. In 1990, Alfonzo was invited to exhibit his work in the prestigious Biennial of American Painting at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. Artnews magazine named him one of the 10 artists to watch in the 1990s. But by then Alfonzo had been diagnosed with the deadly virus acquired immunity deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Facing death, the artist took his art in an entirely new direction. His so-called black or blood paintings were dark, simply composed, and filled with both the specter of death and the hope of an afterlife. His last completed\n\nAlmaraz, Carlos 5 painting, Blood, depicted his soul, a brown form, declining into death. Carlos Alfonzo died on February 19, 1991, in Miami from an AIDS-related cerebral hemorrhage. In 1998, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden opened the first major retrospective of his work, titled Triumph of the Spirit: Carlos Alfonzo, a Survey, 1975–1991. “Alfonzo’s impassioned canvasses trace the struggle of the human spirit by relating one man’s poignant journey,” wrote the exhibit’s curator Olga M. Viso.\n\nFurther Reading Alfonzo, Carlos. The Art of Carlos Alfonzo: January 7, 1988 to February 5, 1988. Miami: Frances Wolfson Art Gallery, Miami-Dade Community College, 1988.

He was born in Mexico City, Mexico, on October 5, 1941, and moved to the United States with his family while still a child. The Almarazes settled in Chicago and later moved to East Los Angeles, California. Carlos attended California State College–Los Angeles and the University of California–Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1965, already an aspiring artist, he moved to New York City where he lived for five years. He studied every prevalent\n\nart trend of the day, including abstract expressionism and minimalism. The insularity of the New York art world dissatisfied him, and he returned to Los Angeles to create a populist art for the Chicano people. Almaraz was quickly drawn into social activist Cesar Chavez’s United Farm Workers Union (UFW), which sought to reform an unjust system for migrant farm workers through protests and strikes. Almaraz created murals, banners, and other practical artwork for Chavez and also created set designs for El Teatro Campesino, a traveling theater company made up of Chicano farm workers. They performed social plays to raise funds for the UFW and its activities. Around this time Almaraz joined with fellow Chicano artists Robert de la Rocha, Gilbert “Mager” Lujan, and Frank Romero to form Los Four, a Chicano art collective. Their goal was to get their street art recognized by the established Los Angeles art community. Traveling to Mexico, Almaraz was inspired by the murals of such masters of the form as Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco. Through the 1970s, he painted murals celebrating Chicanos and other minority groups throughout the Los Angeles area. In 1974 he earned a master of fine arts (M.F.A.) degree from the Otis Art Institute. In the 1980s, his work began to appear regularly in galleries and museum shows, largely thanks to his acceptance into the Jan Turner Gallery in Los Angeles. Almaraz’s paintings and his other artworks have a restless energy. He brought his figures to life with vibrant lines and bold color schemes. His Echo Park painting series, with its vivid scenes of city street life, are among his best-known works. Almaraz was a harsh critic of U.S. society and its materialism. Greed, a symbolic painting of two vicious dogs fighting over a bone, is set against a rust-red lunarlike desert landscape. One of his last paintings before his untimely death from AIDsrelated causes is Death Rides By (1989), which\n\n6 Almendros, Néstor depicts a ghostly skeletal figure of Death racing across the canvas on a horse. The epitaph on Almaraz’s tombstone reads: “Here lies a chap quick as a cat and short one life.” Carlos Almaraz remains a major influence on a new generation of Latino artists. His wife, Elsa Flores Almaraz, is also an artist and frequently collaborated with him.\n\nFurther Reading Almaraz, Carlos. Moonlight Theater: Prints and Related Works.

He was born Néster Almendros Cuyas in Barcelona, Spain, on October 30, 1930. At age 14, he moved with his family to Cuba, where his father had been sent into exile for opposing Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. Almendros attended the University of Havana, where he studied philoso-\n\nphy and literature. But it was film that became his strongest passion, and he wrote film reviews for journals and founded a cineclub in Havana where he screened foreign films. At age 20, Almendros worked on an amateur film with celebrated Cuban filmmaker Tomás Gutiérrez Alea. He went on to study cinematography at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, Italy. Back in Cuba, he served as cameraman or director on six short documentaries at the Instituto del Arte and Industria Cinematografica. Two of these films focused on social injustice in Cuba under dictator Fidel Castro, who seized power in 1959. The government banned these films, and Almendros left Cuba to live and work in Paris, France. There he found work as a cameraman in television and soon came to the attention of leading French filmmakers Erich Rohmer and François Truffaut. He worked with both directors on such classic films as Rohmer’s My Night at Maud’s (1969) and Chloe in the Afternoon (1972) and Truffaut’s The Wild Child (1969) and The Story of Adele H. (1975). In The Wild Child, Almendros’s evocative black-and-white photography perfectly captured the film’s 19th-century setting. Almendros’s first important Hollywood film was Days of Heaven (1978) directed by Terrence Malick. Almendros’s glorious sun-lit visuals, most of which was shot during the “golden hours” (the first hour of dawn and the last hour of dusk), of this period drama set in the American Midwest were so stunning that they almost dwarfed the story of a tragic love triangle. For this film, he earned his first and only Academy Award for best cinematography. Almendros was immediately in demand by some of America’s top directors. He worked with Robert Benton on Kramer vs. Kramer (1979), Places in the Heart (1984), and Nadine (1987). He also shot Sophie’s Choice (1982) for Alan J. Pakula and Martin Scorsese’s segment of the anthology film New York Stories (1989).

He was born Marco Antonio Muñiz in New York City on September 16, 1969, into a large Puerto Rican family with four brothers and three sisters. His father was his first and best teacher, instructing him in composition and music theory. As a child, Marco listened to the music of Rubén Blades, Willie Colón, and José Feliciano, among other Latino-American singers. At age 12, his gift for singing was discovered by demo and commercial producer David Harris, who also hired his sister. While gaining experience in the recording studio working for Harris, Anthony also began to write songs. He gave one song to his friend Latina hip-hop singer Safire to record on her debut album. “Boy, I’ve Been Told” became a top–40 hit on the singles charts.\n\n8 Anthony, Marc Anthony sang backup and was a featured vocalist on one cut on Safire’s album. He also sang on albums by the Latin Rascals and Menudo. About the same time, he made his film debut, starring and singing in the Latino musical East Side Story (1988). The film’s score was composed by producer and deejay Little Louie Vega, who was so impressed by Anthony’s performance that he offered to work with him on an album. The result, When the Night Is Over, was released in 1991 and featured hip-hop Latin music. The album showed that Anthony was part of a greater tradition of Latino music, featuring guest appearances by legendary percussionist Tito Puente and bandleader Eddie Palmieri. A single taken from the album, “Ride on the Rhythm,” was released and shot to #1 on Billboard’s dance music chart. Anthony’s place in Latino music was further solidified when he played as the opening act at a celebration of the release of Puente’s 100th album at New York’s Madison Square Garden. For his next album, Anthony turned to the popular Latin dance music, salsa, with which he had had little experience. “This gives me the opportunity to establish new goals; it gives me new life,” he said at the time. “And that’s what keeps a person like me going.” The album, Otra Nota (1993), became a smash and put Anthony in the forefront of salsa singers. One song on the album he cowrote and sang with his father. Anthony’s film career continued to blossom. He played a Latino disco singer in Carlito’s Way, (1993), starring Al Pacino, and had small parts in Hackers (1995) and The Substitute (1996). He was a convincing drug addict in director Martin Scorsese’s grim urban drama Bringing Out the Dead (1999), starring Nicholas Cage. The same year, Anthony costarred with one of his idols Rubén Blades on Broadway in the short-lived Paul Simon musical, The Capeman. After two more hit salsa albums produced by Sergio George, Anthony made the crossover to the English-language market, signing a $30-\n\nmillion recording contract with Columbia Records. His first album with the label, Marc Anthony (1999), soared to #1 on the charts with a blend of Latino funk and smooth adult contemporary music. Libre (2001), his next album, was a return to his salsa roots and earned him some of his best reviews to date. The critics were less impressed by Mended (2002), complaining that its pop ballads were bland and lacked the passion of Anthony’s best music. Yet, his fans did not seem to mind, and the record sold well. He released Sigo Siendo Yo, a Spanish-greatest hits album in July 2006. Marc Anthony divorced his first wife, former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres Delgado, in 2004 and four days later made headlines by marrying singer/actress Jennifer Lopez. The two sing a duet on his 2004 album Amar sin Mentiras. Anthony has a daughter Ariana by a previous relationship and two sons, Cristian Anthony and Ryan Anthony, by Torres.\n\nFurther Reading All Music Guide. “Marc Anthony.” All Music Guide Web Site.

She was born in Panama on October 14, 1967. She grew up in a hearing family that did not expose her to sign language or any part of deaf culture. Frustrated by her inability to communicate with people, she began to express herself from the age of nine through drawing and painting. Her first subject was the seaside, which she often visited with her family. “As a child I basked in the beauty of the waves and sand . . . ,” she remembers. “My parents recall my surprise and inspiration at the salty taste of seawater.” She was also inspired to be an artist by visits to the Museo de Arts Contemporaneo in Panama City. “There I found not only a connection between my heart and the visual arts, but support from the professional community,” she says. Her parents encouraged her artistic talent, and she attended the Justo Arosemana Institute, receiving a bachelor of arts (B.A.) in 1984. Aranda continued her studies at the University of Panama in Panama City, where she received technical degrees in applied arts design (1983) and plastic art (1987). She went on to earn a master of arts (M.A.) in applied arts design at the university in 1997. While attending an international conference on deaf education on the island of Bermuda, Aranda met a woman who would change her life. Alisha Bronk was an advocate for the deaf, having grown up with two deaf brothers in Wisconsin. The two women struck up a friendship, and Bronk invited Aranda to come to the United States where she felt she could better pursue her career as an artist. She joined Bronk, who became her manager, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where she lives and works\n\nBorn and raised in Panama, Iris Nelia Aranda is deaf and has found a powerful means of communication through her art.

She has created art for such major companies as CocaCola and Colgate and has sold her work to Very Special Art, an affiliate of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. She has also designed corporate and home interiors. Aranda has held children’s art workshops at the Wisconsin School for the Deaf and the Milwaukee Sign Language Immersion School, among others. She has exhibited her work in the United States, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Mexico, Chile, France, and Egypt. Her work was represented in the second biennial art exhibition of Panama in 2004–05. She signs her artwork “Irisne.” “All my figures, whether plants, animals, fruits or human forms, reverberate in the depths of my starry, surreal skies,” she explains. “My soul is drawn to living lineal figures and natural cylindrical shapes. My colors fuse freshness, harmony and spontaneity—the joy and rush of life in the natural world of animals, water and climate that flows from within my art.”\n\n10 Archuleta, Felipe\n\nFurther Reading Aranda, Iris Nelia.

He was born in Santa Cruz, New Mexico, in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains on August 23, 1910. The eldest of six children, Felipe and his family lived in abject poverty. After a minimum of schooling, he went to work as a migrant farmworker in neighboring Colorado. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, he became a stonemason through the federal agency, the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Archuleta later settled down in Tesuque, New Mexico, in a simple adobe house and worked as a carpenter for more than 30 years. Unemployed in the mid–1960s, he experienced a religious awakening and prayed to God to give him guidance. He claimed that God directed him to carving. He began to carve small animals—sheep, burros, cats—out of cottonwood or elm, which he sold to gift shops and art galleries. Using only a few carpenters’ tools, Elmer’s glue, and house paint, Archuleta created fantastic creatures with great snouts, enlarged genitals, and wild eyes. Soon, he was fashioning larger, more wild and exotic animals such as monkeys, elephants, and fish. Some were even life size. In true folkart fashion, he set out to capture not the literal animal but the fierce, untamed spirit that it symbolized.\n\nArchuleta used a chainsaw to begin these large carvings and adorned the finished beasts with such simple but original materials as hemp, brush bristles, wool, and marbles. He was part of the grand bultos tradition, the carving of fully rounded figures that flourished for two and a half centuries in Mexico but had almost completely died out by 1900. Archuleta’s intricate work renewed interest in nonreligious bultos and revived the tradition. Among those who followed him were Alonso Jimenez and Archuleta’s own son Leroy (1949– ), both of whom began their careers as his assistants. As he grew older, Archuleta’s reputation in the growing folk-art market rose, and he was unable to keep up with the demand for his work. “I can’t satisfy the whole world, amigo,” he complained to one collector. But he tried his best, turning out his unique animals until 1987. He died on January 1, 1991, in Tesuque. Felipe Archuleta received the Governor of New Mexico’s Award of Excellence in Achievement in the Arts in 1979. His work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico; the Milwaukee Art Center/Museum in Wisconsin; and the Museum of American Folk Art in New York City, among others.\n\nFurther Reading Congdon, Kristin G., and Kara Kelley Hallmark.

Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha III was born in Santiago, Cuba, on March 2, 1917. He came from Cuba’s privileged class; both sides of his family were well-to-do landowners. His grandfather was a founding partner in the Bundaberg Rum Company, and his father, Desiderio II, was the mayor of Santiago. Desi’s charmed childhood came to an abrupt end in 1933 when he was 16. A revolution overthrew President Gerardo Machado, and Fulgencio Batista came to power. The Arnaz family, friends of the former president, was stripped of its wealth, status, and property. Desi’s father was thrown into jail and only released through the negotiations of U.S. officials, who claimed he remained neutral during the revolution. The family fled to Miami, Florida, where the former privileged son found himself cleaning canary cages in a pet shop and driving a truck to help the family survive. Through sheer grit and raw talent, he joined a Cuban band as a guitarist and vocalist in 1936. His sparkling personality on stage impressed Spanish bandleader Xavier Cugat, who hired him in New York as lead vocalist with his famous orchestra. After only six months with Cugat, Arnaz left to form his own combo, in which he sang and played the bongo drums. The new band, which grew to an orchestra, rode to fame on the then-current conga craze, based on the syncopated Brazilian dance that swept the country in the late 1930s. In 1939, Arnaz was cast as a Cuban bongo player in the Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart Broadway musical Too Many Girls. It was an apt\n\nMore than a conga player, bandleader, and sitcom actor, Desi Arnaz was one of the first great innovative television producers. (Photofest)\n\ntitle, for Desi was an irrepressible ladies’ man. When Hollywood picked up the musical the following year, Desi reprised his role in the film version. One of his costars was a vibrant redhead, Lucille Ball, who had been acting in films since 1933. The two fell in love almost immediately and were married a few months later. For the next decade, the Arnazes saw precious little of each other. He was busy traveling with his band and making an occasional movie, including the excellent war film Bataan (1943), his only dramatic role in a Hollywood film. Shortly after, he was drafted during World War II, but, due to a knee injury, he spent his time in service directing United Service Organizations (U.S.O.) shows\n\n12 Arnaz, Desi for soldiers at a California military hospital. Lucy was busy with her film career, playing second leads and comic roles in dozens of movies. They later claimed to have spent $30,000 on telephone calls and telegrams during these years of separation. In the late 1940s, Ball starred in a radio comedy My Favorite Wife opposite actor Richard Denning. The Columbia Broadcast System (CBS) wanted to bring the radio show to the new medium of television in 1950, with both actors reprising their roles. Ball insisted that her real husband, Desi, play her television husband on the new show. Both of them saw it as a golden opportunity to work together after years of working and living apart. But the head of programming at CBS was adamantly against Desi. He claimed viewers would never buy that Ball was married to a Cuban American. He also felt Arnaz could not act and would be unintelligible with his Spanish accent. The couple set out to prove him wrong. They put together a vaudeville-style show and took it on the road to perform live before audiences around the country, all at their own expense. The road show was a hit, but CBS still was not convinced. The couple filmed a pilot episode, again at their own expense. Desi played Ricky Ricardo, a none-too-successful Cuban bandleader and Lucy, who retained her own first name, was his zany, show-biz crazy wife. There were other problems to surmount before their show, named I Love Lucy, hit the airwaves. Most television shows were shot live in New York, but the Arnazes wanted to remain in California and do the show from there. There was as yet no permanent national, coast-to-coast cable, and CBS was against sending copies that had been filmed off a TV screen, called kinescopes, to the East Coast because they were of poor quality. Lucy and Desi said they would solve the problem by filming the episodes live. This presented a new problem of how to film a situation comedy before a live audience. Working with technicians, Desi came up with a solution. They would film each episode in con-\n\ntinuous action as a three-act play with multiple cameras and then edit the different camera shots later for viewing. This technique has since become standard practice in television. The Arnazes would pay the extra $5,000 that the filming would cost per episode, and in return CBS would allow them to own the shows. This proved to be a gold mine for the Arnazes. Their shows are still rerunning on television today, more than a half century after they were first shown. I Love Lucy was a smash success after its debut in Fall 1951. It became the #3 show of the season and then went to #1 for the next three seasons. In April 1952, a research agency announced that it was the first television program to be seen in 10 million homes. When Lucy became pregnant with their second child during the second season, Desi convinced the sponsor to let them incorporate her pregnancy into the show’s story line. Never before had a real pregnant woman portrayed a woman who becomes pregnant on television. However, the network refused to allow the word pregnant to be used on the show. Lucy Ricardo was instead “expecting.” Incredibly, the real Arnaz baby, Desi, Jr., was born the same day that the episode about the birth of little Ricky Ricardo aired. The two events gained bigger newspaper headlines than the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower! In their five seasons on the air, the Ricardos moved to Hollywood when Desi was cast in a movie, traveled to Europe, and eventually settled in suburban Connecticut. Beginning in 1957, the couple filmed 13 one-hour specials entitled The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour. This show, like I Love Lucy, was produced by their own production company, Desilu Productions. Under Desi’s skillful direction, Desilu became television’s biggest producer of shows, including such hits as the sitcoms Our Miss Brooks, The Danny Thomas Show, and December Bride as well as the ground-breaking period crime series, The Untouchables. They even had their own dramatic anthology series, Desilu\n\nArreguín, Alfredo 13 Playhouse, which Arnaz hosted and in which he sometimes starred. While professionally the Arnazes were thriving, their marriage was falling apart. A large part of the problem was Desi’s alcoholism and his womanizing, about which he wrote candidly in his autobiography A Book (1977). After completing their last comedy hour, the couple divorced in 1960. Desi sold his interest in Desilu Studios to his former wife in 1962. She continued as television’s top comedienne in two more television series; Desi went into semiretirement and married Edith Mack Hirsch in 1963. He was executive producer of one more sitcom, The Mothers-in-Law (1967–69) and appeared occasionally on the show as the bullfighter Raphael del Gado. Arnaz retired to Del Mar, California, in the 1970s. One of his rare television appearances in the 1980s was as host for the NBC comedy show Saturday Night Live. He was working on a second volume of autobiography, Another Book, when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died on December 2, 1986. Lucille Ball died three years later. Desi Arnaz was a giant in early television, whose accomplishments were all too often overshadowed by his equally gifted wife. Ricky Ricardo with his crazy English and perfect straight-man timing, was a memorable creation, although Desi was never nominated for an Emmy. Unlike Lucy, he put very little stock in awards and honors. “I’m waiting for them to put in a category of bongo drummer,” he said at the time, “and if they have one and don’t nominate me, then I’ll squawk.” His two children by Lucy, Luci Arnaz (1951– ) and Desi Arnaz, Jr. (1953– ), are both actors. The younger Desi portrayed his father in the movie The Mambo Kings (1992).\n\nFurther Reading Arnaz, Desi. A Book. New York: Warner Books, 1977. Harris, Warren G.

He was born in Morelia, in the Mexican state of Michoacan, on January 20, 1935. Exhibiting a gift for art at an early age, Arreguín became the youngest pupil at age nine to attend the Morelia School of Fine Art. When he was 13, he moved to Mexico City with his family; at age 23, he immigrated to the United States, settling in Seattle, Washington. Arreguín pursued art studies at the University of Washington, earning a bachelor of arts (B.A.) degree in 1967 and a master of fine arts (M.F.A.) degree two years later. He had his first solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art (MOCHA) in New York City in 1978. The natural world and all its splendor is Arreguín’s favorite subject, and his green landscapes teem with birds, butterflies, fish, and other creatures.\n\n14 Arriola, Gus His art, while sophisticated enough to please the art critics, enjoys a greater commercial appeal than many of his contemporaries. In 1985, he created a greeting card for the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) that was distributed throughout Europe. He designed the White House Easter egg in 1988 and 1989. In addition, an oil triptych of flowers, Sueño (Dream: Eve Before Adam) (1992), is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American Art (SAAM) and was rated by the Smithsonian as “one of its seven most important acquisitions from among more than 600 works of art collected by the museum in 1994.” Other paintings reside in the permanent collections of numerous museums, including the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum in Chicago; the Tucson Museum of Art in Arizona; the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the Tacoma Art Museum in Washington State; and the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. Arreguín has been the recipient of many awards and honors including a Special Humanitarian Award from the Washington State Legislature Centennial Commission (1989); the OHTLI Award from the Mexican government (1997), its highest civilian honor for a nonresident; and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Washington Alumni Association (2000). He has also received two National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grants in 1980 and 1985. Arreguín served as Seattle Arts Commissioner from 1980 to 1982 and continues to live and work in that city today. “Alfredo Arreguín’s paintings unleash our imagination and free us to envision an ideal world by celebrating both the ethereal and the tangible in the contested world around us,” SAAM curator Andrew Connors has written.\n\nFurther Reading “Alfredo Arreguín,” Art and Resume.

Arriola) (1917– ) cartoonist The first Latino-American cartoonist to be nationally syndicated, Gus Arriola gave millions of Americans their first taste of Latin-American life and culture in his charming, colorful comic strip Gordo. Gustavo M. Arriola was born of Mexican heritage in Florence, Arizona, on July 17, 1917. When he was eight, his family moved to Los Angeles, California. After graduating from high school, Arriola got a job as an in-betweener, a person who draws the transitional animation in a cycle of motion between extremes in cartoons. He worked at the Charles Mintz Studio, which made cartoons for Screen Gems, a Hollywood studio. After a year at Mintz, Arriola moved on to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios, which had its own animation department. He worked as an animator on a character known as the Lonesome Stranger. A Mexican bandit in this cartoon would serve Arriola as a model for his most celebrated creation. Three years later, Arriola left MGM and decided to try his hand at a comic strip. The main character was a Mexican bean farmer named Perfecto Salazar Lopez, better known as Gordo, which is Spanish for “fatso.” United Features Syndicate bought the strip, and it debuted in American newspapers on November 24, 1941. Only two weeks later, the United States entered World War II. Arriola soon stopped work on Gordo and joined the air force, where he worked\n\nAzaceta, Luis Cruz 15 animating training films for U.S. troops. Before he entered the service, he married Mary Frances Sevier. On evenings and weekends, he found time to start a Sunday Gordo strip in color. The war ended in August 1945, and Arriola returned to civilian life. He settled with his wife in La Jolla, California, and resumed the Gordo daily strip the following year. Soon, the popular strip was appearing in more than 250 newspapers. In many ways, Gordo reinforced stereotypes of Latin Americans. Gordo was overweight, wore a big sombrero, and preferred long siestas to working in his bean fields. He had a young nephew named Pepito, a chihuahua he called Señor Dog, and a menagerie of barnyard animals that freely wandered in and out of his house. He also had a stout housekeeper, Tchuana Mama, who, after years of watching him pursue other women, became his wife. Arriola treated Gordo and his other characters with respect and gave them a warm humanity that often transcended the stereotypes. Over time, he deepened and enriched his characters, and Gordo’s broken English became noticeably better. In 1958, Gordo largely abandoned his bean farm for a career as a tour guide, showing U.S. visitors the wonders of Mexico from his eccentric old bus, La Comita Halley (Halley’s comet). Ironically, Arriola had never set foot in Mexico until the strip had been running for 20 years. His bold sense of design and color made the Sunday strip a treat for the eye and a favorite of readers. The cartoonist “retired” Gordo in March 1985 after 44 years. During that time, he had won many awards. Gordo was named Best Humor Strip by the National Cartoonists Society in 1957 and 1965. In 1981, Arriola received the San Diego Comic Convention’s “Inkpot Award” for Outstanding Achievement. The year he retired, the California state legislature voted a resolution honoring Arriola’s professional excellence and his promotion of interethnic understanding. Gus Arriola lives with his wife on California’s Monterey Peninsula.\n\nFurther Reading Arriola, Gus. Gordo’s Critters. Berkeley, Calif.: Celestial Arts, 1989 [reprint].

He was born in Marianao, Cuba, on April 5, 1942, the eldest son of an airplane mechanic. Dissatisfied with Fidel Castro’s communist regime that took power in 1959, Azaceta caught one of the last commercial flights to the United States at age 18 in 1960. He settled in New York City and supported himself by working in a trophy factory. He soon began to take courses in drawing at a community center. He was accepted by the School of Visual Arts in New York and paid for his tuition by working as a clerk in a library. He graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in 1969. Azaceta’s early paintings captured the chaos and brutality of urban life. They were first exhibited publicly at the International Art Exhibition at the Loeb Student Center at New York University. His identification with the victims and rejects of society was graphically depicted in a series of self portraits in which he painted himself as an acquired immunity deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient, a cocaine addict, and even a cockroach. In such later works as Rafter Hell/Act I, Azaceta expressed the terrible suffering of Cuban refugees, crossing the ocean to Florida and freedom in\n\n16 Azaceta, Luis Cruz flimsy rafts and tiny boats. By the 1990s, Azaceta began to experiment with collage. He would photograph objects with a Polaroid camera and then cut the images for his collages. Everyday objects took on sharp, symbolic meaning in these works. For example, a food processor in Immigrant stands for the new arrivals’ dream of mass consumerism but also makes a point about the mixing of cultures that takes place in the United States. Azaceta’s work earned him a National Endowment for the Visual Arts (NEVA) fellowship in 1980 and 1985. In 1986, his one-person show Tough Ride Around the City opened at the Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art (MOCHA) in New York City. His more recent one-person show Prayers—Beads—Cells (2001) at the Arthur Roger Gallery in New Orleans included the painting series “Trax,” filled with round polka-dot shapes that represent the toxic organisms spread by terrorists in post–September 11 America. From 1981 to 1984, Azaceta taught at several institutes of higher learning, including Louisiana State University (LSU) at Baton Rouge and the University of California–Berkeley. In 2005, he was appointed the Lamar Dodd Professorial Chair of Art at the University of Georgia’s Dodd School of Art. His paintings are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Art in Boston; New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museo de Barrio; and the New Orleans Museum of Art, among many others. Luis Cruz Azaceta is married and\n\nlives and works in a warehouse studio on Tchoupitoulas Street in New Orleans. “Cuba gave me my values, my sense of humor, and sarcasm; in other words, a tragic-comic look at life,” he has said. “The United States gave me the opportunity to become an artist, the freedom to paint the realities, anxiety, and horrors of the urban environment. The human condition.”\n\nFurther Reading Azaceta, Luis Cruz. Hell: Luīs Cruz Azaceta: Selected Works, 1978–1993. New York: Alternative Museum, 1993. Cockcroft, James D., assisted by Jane Canning.

Baca married at age 19, but the marriage did not last, and the couple divorced six years later. She returned to her high school in the late 1960s to teach art but was soon fired for activist activities against the Vietnam War. She taught arts and crafts to children and senior citizens in 1970 with the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department. By 1974, Baca had established herself as an area artist and started a mural program for Los Angeles, the first of its kind in the city. She hired local people and professional artists to create murals in public places. She also brought in hundreds of youth, many of them with criminal records, and involved them in creating something positive—a mural. Two years later, Baca founded the Social and Public Arts Resource Center (SPARC) in Venice, California, which she is still the artistic director of today. The nonprofit group’s purpose was to create public art projects in ethnic communities where most residents had never seen the inside of a museum. That summer, Baca began work on what would become her most ambitious and celebrated artwork—the Great Wall of Los Angeles. She chose an unlikely site for this massive mural—the Tujunga Wash drainage canal in the San Fernando Valley. Her subject was nothing less than the history of the state of California as seen through the eyes of the many minority groups who helped create that history. She drew for inspiration on the\n\nCreator of the world’s longest mural, Judy Baca has spent her career bringing the heritage and dreams of different peoples to life in dramatic and vivid public art. Judith Francisca Baca was born in East Los Angeles, California, on September 20, 1946. Her maternal grandparents fled Mexico in 1919 during the Mexican Revolution and settled in La Junta, Colorado, where Mexican Americans were treated as second-class citizens. Their daughter, Baca’s mother, Ortencia Ferrari, moved to California in the mid-1940s and worked in a tire plant. She had a relationship with a navy man who died in World War II and shortly after gave birth to Baca. Soon, mother and daughter were joined by her grandmother and two aunts in a tiny duplex in Watts, a poor section of Los Angeles. “It was the perfect situation for creating an empowered young woman,” Baca has recalled. “I was the center of everybody’s life, and nobody ever told me I couldn’t do things.” Baca’s mother later married an Italian upholsterer, and the family moved to Pacoima, California. Baca attended a Catholic high school where her gift for art brought the shy girl out of her shell. She went on to the California State University– Northridge, where she earned a master of fine arts\n\n17\n\n18 Baca, Judy\n\nArtist Judy Baca stands before “Triumph of the Hearts,” one panel in her monumental mural World Wall: A Vision of the Future Without Fear. (Judith Baca)\n\nstories and memories of Chicanos and other ethnic peoples whom she spent months interviewing. The mural, composed of 40 panels, was the work of hundreds of volunteers, young and old. The scenes depicted ranged from the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores to the waves of ethnic immigrants to the state in the 19th and 20th centuries. For five summers during the next seven years, the artists, under Baca’s supervision, painted with acrylics on the solid concrete walls of the wash. When it was finally finished in 1984, the\n\nGreat Wall was nearly a half-mile long and 13 feet high—the longest mural in the world. Big as it is, the Great Wall was just one of more than 250 murals made by more than 2,000 artists and volunteers under Baca’s direction in the program’s 10 years of operation. Her next major project was not quite so colossal but in many ways more ambitious. She conceived the World Wall: A Vision of the Future Without Fear at a time (1998) when communism was crumbling in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This 210-\n\nBaez, Joan 19 foot, two-side portable canvas mural depicted such global issues as peace, cooperation, and interdependence. Since its original completion, this unique mural has traveled around the world. As the Soviet Union was in its final days, 150,000 people viewed it in Moscow’s Gorky Park. As of 2001, new panels from artists in Australia, Mexico, and Canada were being added to the work. In 1988, the city of Los Angeles started a new mural program under Baca’s direction entitled Great Walls Unlimited: Neighborhood Pride. The program had produced 105 murals in a multitude of ethnic neighborhoods in Los Angeles County through 2003 when it ended. One of Baca’s personal favorites is the Guadeloupe Mural (1988– 90), in which she collaborated with hundreds of residents of the small, rural town of Guadeloupe in Santa Barbara County. The completed mural was a unique tribute to the town and its people, combining their colorful past with their hopes for the future. SPARC and Baca are currently working to restart the mural program In recent years, Baca has been preoccupied with preserving the Great Wall of Los Angeles, which has been marred by the elements over the years. Along with restoration of the existing work, she has planned new panels to reflect the state’s history since 1950, where the original mural left off. Judy Baca, who describes herself as a “cultural attack dog,” currently teaches at the University of California–Los Angeles (UCLA) and is director of the school’s Cesar Chavez Digital Mural Lab, which is an experimental lab for new techniques to create murals and other large artworks. “Muralism is the only art form that was so identified with communities of color that it came to be considered lower-class,” she has said. “But in reality, muralism is a very noble art form because it talks about civic space as an amenity to our lives. We require civic spaces to come together, and we should be inspired by those spaces to become better citizens.”\n\nFurther Reading Congdon, Kristin G., and Kara Kelley Hallmark.

Joan Chandos Báez was born in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, on January 9, 1941. Her father, Alberto Vicio Báez, was a Mexican-born physicist who had immigrated to the United States with his family at the age of two. He met Joan’s mother, Joan Bonk, a Scotswoman who grew up in New York City, at a dance. The Báezs and their three daughters moved to California in the mid-1940s where Alberto attended graduate school at Stanford University. When he graduated, they\n\n20 Baez, Joan returned to New York City. In junior high school, Joan was snubbed by other students because of her Mexican name and olive skin. By now a research physicist, Dr. Báez moved his family to Iraq, where he worked for the United Nations (UN). In 1958, the family returned to the states and settled in Boston, Massachusetts. Dr. Báez took a teaching position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in nearby Cambridge. Folk singing was beginning to undergo a revival in many American cities. In Harvard Square, Cambridge, Joan and her father went to small coffeehouses to hear folk music, and it struck a responsive chord in her. A student at Boston University, Báez learned the guitar and started to play in these same coffeehouses. Her untrained but pitch-perfect soprano gained the attention of a music promoter who got her a two-week gig at a Chicago club. Another folksinger, Bob Gibson, was so impressed by her singing that he invited her to sing with him at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island in Summer 1959. She and Gibson sang two songs together to enthusiastic applause. The next summer, she returned to Newport to sing solo to even greater acclaim. Vanguard, a record label devoted to folk music, signed her to a recording contract, and her debut album, Joan Baez, a collection of 13 traditional folk songs, was released in December 1960. Soon after, Baez and her boyfriend Michael moved to San Francisco. On her arrival several weeks later, she was surprised to learn that her album was selling briskly and moving up the record charts. She went on tour to promote the album, taking time out to record Joan Baez 2 (1961). The second album’s popularity boosted sales of the first album, and by the time Joan Baez in Concert, a live album, was released in 1962, all three were best sellers. They remained on the charts for more than two years. No other American folksinger had sold so many records before. In November 1962, Joan Baez’s reputation as the “Queen of Folk Music” was firmly sealed when her picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nAbout this time, Baez met and befriended young singer/songwriter Bob Dylan in New York City. Baez was greatly impressed by Dylan’s original folk songs dealing with social issues and quickly became his champion. She helped start his career by singing his songs in her concerts. The two eventually became lovers. Baez’s sixth album, Farewell Angelina (1965), included four Dylan songs as well as songs by the English folk-rock artist Donovan and American folk pioneer Woody Guthrie. Baez’s change of repertoire from traditional folk music to more contemporary songs coincided with her growing social activism. She sang at the historic March on Washington for civil rights led by the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. A live recording of the protest song “We Shall Overcome” that she sang at Mills College in Birmingham, Alabama, that same year became her first single on the pop charts. She joined in the protest movement against the Vietnam War, which the United States waged in 1965 to fight communists in Southeast Asia. That same year, she founded the Institute for the Study of Nonviolence in Carmel, California, where she lived. In 1968, while in jail briefly for protesting the war, she met peace activist David Harris. The two fell in love and married in 1968. They had a daughter, Gabriel, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1972. In the late 1960s, Baez began to move from folk to country and rock music. She recorded a song by The Band, a rock group that was formerly Dylan’s backup band. “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” (1971) became her biggest pop hit, going to #3 on the pop charts. In 1972, around Christmastime, Baez visited Hanoi, the capital city of North Vietnam, the United States’s enemy in the war. She described the experience in her original song “Where Are You Now, My Son?,” splicing into the track the sound of American bombs dropping on Hanoi. Baez’s Latina roots were largely unknown by the public until she released an album of Spanish-\n\nBanderas, Antonio 21 language songs, Gracias a la Vida (Here’s to Life) in 1974. The album was her response to the downfall of the socialist presidency of Chile’s Salvador Allende Gossens and the rise of a military dictatorship in its place. She dedicated the album to her father who, she wrote, “gave me my Latin name and whatever optimism about life I may claim to have.” Her crowning moment as a songwriter came four years later with the release of the best-selling album Diamonds and Rust (1975). The title song, her last hit pop single to date, was autobiographical and described her complicated relationship with Bob Dylan. In the 1980s, the few albums that Baez recorded were mostly done in Europe, where she found a new and eager audience for her music. She concentrated on the concert circuit and her many social causes, which included performing at the Live Aid concert in 1985. In the 1990s, she resumed recording in the United States and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Recording for the album Play Me Backwards (1992). Her next album, Gone from Danger (1997), featured songs by such young gifted songwriters as Sinead Lohan, Richard Shindell, and Dar Williams. In her music and her life, Joan Baez continues to embody the spirit and social conscience of American folk music. Her younger sister, Mimi Farina, who died of cancer in 2001, was also a well-known songwriter and folksinger.\n\nFurther Reading Baez, Joan. And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir.

José Antonio Domínguez Bandera was born in Málaga, Spain, on August 10, 1960. His father was a policeman, and his mother, a schoolteacher. As a child, Banderas’s dream was to become a professional soccer player. That dream ended at age 14 when he broke his foot during a soccer game. He turned his ambitions toward acting and attended the School of Drama Art in Málaga. In 1981, he was hired by the National Theatre of Spain in Madrid where he developed his acting skills playing a variety of roles in repertory. His first break came a year later when Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar saw him in a play at the National and cast him in his next film Laberinto de pasione (Labyrinth of Passion) (1982). The two men worked well together, and Almodóvar cast Banderas in four more of his films, including the screwball comedy Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1987). The film proved a breakthrough for both\n\n22 Banderas, Antonio\n\nDespite his image as a Latin lover, Antonio Banderas has proven to be a serious actor, who also has a flair for comedy and self-parody. (Photofest)\n\nAlmodóvar and Banderas. It was an art-house film hit in the United States and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Foreign Language Film in 1989. On the basis of this success, Banderas decided to move to the United States and try his luck in Hollywood. In his first American film, he played himself as Madonna’s love interest in her star vehicle Truth or Dare (1991). He had a more substantial role as a Cuban musician in New York in the 1950s in The Mambo Kings (1992), the film adaptation of Oscar Hijuelos’s Pulitzer Prize–winning novel. Banderas did not speak English at that time and had to learn all his lines phonetically. While the film was not a hit, it boosted Banderas’s image as a sexy Latin lover. Uncomfortable as many Latino screen actors before him were with this label, Banderas played against type as Tom Hanks’s gay lover in the drama Philadelphia (1993).\n\nHe established his credentials as a leading action hero in two solid films, Desperado and Assassins, both released in 1995. Desperado was the second film by director Robert Rodriguez about El Mariachi, a mysterious, guitar-playing outlaw in Mexico. In Assassins, Banderas was a professional hit man pitted against a top competitor, played by Sly Stallone. Now a bona fide Hollywood star, Banderas was named one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world by People magazine in 1996. His marriage to Spanish actress Ana Leze, whom he married in 1988, fell apart, and in May 1996 he married American actress Melanie Griffith, his costar in the flop comedy Two Much (1996). Banderas was reunited with Madonna in the long-anticipated movie version of the hit musical Evita (1996), based on the life of Eva Perón, wife of Argentinean dictator Juan Perón. Banderas played the pivotal role of revolutionary Che Guevara, and made an impressive debut on screen as a singer. His next major film was The Mask of Zorro (1998), a vastly entertaining adventure movie based on the popular masked character who fought evil in old Spanish California. Banderas managed to hold his own with costars Anthony Hopkins, as the older Zorro, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, as Hopkins’s fetching, sword-wielding daughter. Banderas’s comedic abilities were more fully exhibited in another Rodriguez production, Spy Kids (2001). Banderas and his screen wife, Carla Gugino, played secret agents who kept their true identities from their two children. That quickly changed as the offspring became part of their next assignment. Banderas repeated his role in two successful sequels, Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams (2002) and Spy Kids 3–D: Game Over (2003). He then completed Rodriguez’s El Mariachi trilogy in the action epic Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), which reunited him with costar Salma Hayek. This same busy year, Banderas returned to his first love, the stage, starring on Broadway in a revival of the musical Nine. It was a role that was\n\nBarela, Patrociño 23 originated by another Latino actor, Raúl Juliá. In October 2005, Banderas was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Banderas and Griffith have a daughter, Stella, and two children from Griffith’s previous marriage to actor Don Johnson. An actor of great range, Banderas works hard at each role and has a healthy attitude toward his career. “This may sound a little harsh, but I don’t care about my career,” he has said. “Really, I don’t like actors who are always planning what they’re going to do next or always worrying about doing something that will go against the image they’ve created. To me, that’s almost like an attack of narcissism.”\n\nFurther Reading Allison, Amy. Antonio Banderas (Latinos in the Limelight). New York: Chelsea House, 2001.

He was born into a poor Mexican family sometime around 1900 (the exact date and place of his birth are unknown).\n\nHis father Manuel emigrated from Mexico and settled in Bisbee, Arizona, where he worked as a miner in the copper mines. Patrociño’s mother died when he was an infant. The family moved north to Taos, New Mexico, about 1908; there, Manuel bought a small ranch and became a shepherd, while Patrociño and his brother briefly attended school. He showed little interest in schoolwork and spent most of his time drawing and making clay models. His father saw no point in education and took his sons out of school after a few weeks. Patrociño was given the job of tending the family goats. At age 11, he ran away from home; a black family took him in as a foster child and taught him English. After wandering from place to place and working as a shepherd, farmworker, and miner, Barela settled in Pueblo, Colorado, where he worked for seven years in a steel factory. He finally returned to New Mexico in 1930, married, and settled in Canon, just outside Taos. One day, a friend asked him to fix a damaged wooden carving of a saint, called a santos. Barela discovered that he had a gift for carving. Working with only a pocketknife and a chisel, he became a santero, a carver of wooden religious statues, a centuries-old tradition in the Southwest and Mexico. As his work matured, he turned from carving only saints to carving ordinary people but with the same expressiveness and spiritual power that he gave to his religious subjects. In 1935, Barela began work for the Works Progress Administration’s (WPA) Emergency Relief Administration hauling gravel and dirt for building in his horse-drawn wagon. A representative for the WPA’s Federal Arts Project saw his carvings and was greatly impressed. He showed them to Vernon Hunter, director of the WPA in New Mexico. Hunter befriended Barela and hired him to make carvings for the Federal Arts Project (FAP). The two men became close friends. Barela was now able to devote himself full time to his carvings in cedar and pinewood. He gained wider recognition when eight of his works were included in an exhibition of the FAP in 1936\n\n24 Barretto, Ray called New Horizons in American Art, held at the prestigious Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York City. Time magazine published a feature article about his work, calling him the “discovery of the year.” MOMA went further, hailing Barela as the “most dramatic discovery made in American art for the past several years.” His work was also featured at the New York World’s Fair in 1939. While Barela was part of the long Hispano (original Mexican settlers of the Southwest) heritage of New Mexico, he drew on many other influences in his work. These included the severe beauty of European romanesque art of the Middle Ages and the primitive art of the Polynesian people of the South Pacific. He was also strikingly modernistic in his bold use of semiabstract figures and negative space. Despite his sudden fame, Barela gained little monetarily from his art. After the FAP shut down in 1943, Barela continued to create wood sculptures. New York galleries expressed interest in representing Barela’s work, but because his English was poor and he could not read or write, communication was difficult. Vernon Hunter and other people tried to represent his interests, but their efforts were not successful. Unable to make a living at his art, Barela returned to shepherding. His last years were marred by alcoholism, which he battled for many years. Patrociño Barela died tragically on October 24, 1964, in a fire that broke out in his workshop. One of his last works, a triptych (triple) carving, shows a spirit springing forth from a corpse at the moment of death. Since his death, Barela’s reputation has continued to grow. His highly personal approach to a traditional art form has had an enormous influence on many of New Mexico’s contemporary Santeros. His grandson Luis was so moved after attending an exhibit of his grandfather’s work in 1980 that he decided to become a carver. Today, Luis Barela is a prominent New Mexico santero, as is another grandson Carlos.\n\nIn 1996, the Harwood Museum of the University of New Mexico–Taos organized an ambitious traveling exhibition of Barela’s work entitled Spirit Ascendant, the Art and Life of Patrociño Barela. Other carvings are in numerous museums including the Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe; the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM) in Washington, D.C.; and MOMA in New York. “His work comes from the roots of the land and Hispano society of New Mexico,” wrote artist Edward Gonzales and art historian David L. Witt. “The images he made, from the erotic to the tragic to the religious, shows individuals bearing the struggles of life.”\n\nFurther Reading Congdon, Kristin G., and Kara Kelley Hallmark.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York, on April 29, 1929, the son of Puerto Rican immigrants, and was raised from the age of four by his mother after his father left. While his mother was at night school, Ray and his siblings stayed at home alone, listening to recordings of the big bands of the 1940s. “They were our baby-sitters!” he recalls. Barretto served a hitch in the army in the early 1950s after graduating high school and was stationed in Germany. Here, he began to play the conga drums. Unlike many Latin jazz musicians, his first musical love was jazz, and he came to master the rhythms of Latin music later. Returning home after his military service, Barretto found work playing congas in small jazz groups. His big break came in 1958 when bandleader Tito Puente hired him to replace percussionist Mongo Santamaria. Barretto stayed with Puente for four years and then formed his own group, Charanga Moderna, in 1962. He modernized the sound of traditional charanga—a style of Cuban dance music with strings, flutes, and percussion—by adding brass to the mix. The group recorded for Riverside Records but also released singles on the Tico label. One of these, an offbeat novelty instrumental “El Watusi,” became a crossover top-20 pop hit in 1963. This strange record consists of two men discussing in Spanish a big mean hombre called El Watusi while Barretto’s group plays a catchy if repetitive dance riff in the background. It was his only pop-charting single. While he continued to record on his own, Barretto had great success as a session player on albums by such jazz luminaries as Dizzy Gillespie, Cannonball Adderly, West Montgomery, and Cal Tjader. He began to record for the top salsa label Fania in 1967 and later took over as the musical director of the house band, the Fania All-Stars. With this group, he made memorable recordings with a number of top Latin artists, including Celia Cruz. His duet with Cruz, “Ritmo en el Corazon,” won a Grammy Award for best tropical Latin performance in 1990.\n\nAfter a period of experimentation with rock and funk in the 1970s, Barretto made what many consider to be his finest album, La Cuna (1981) with guest players Tito Puente and Charlie Palmieri. He became musical director of the prestigious Latin music television program Bravisimo. Barretto formed the Latin jazz sextet New World Spirit in 1992 and played and recorded with them until his death. In January 2006, he received the Jazz Masters Award from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Two days after the induction ceremony, he suffered a heart attack and died of heart failure on February 17, 2006.\n\nFurther Reading Chinen, Nate. “Ray Barretto, a Master of the Conga Drum, Dies at 76” [obituary].

Drawn to photography as a young man, Bernal studied for a time with master photographer Frederick Sommer at Prescott College in Prescott, Arizona. In 1971, Bernal was hired as a photography instructor at Pima Community College’s West Campus in Tucson, Arizona, where he would teach for the next 18 years. When he was not teaching and sharing his experience with his students, Bernal was roaming the barrios of New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas with his camera. He got to know his subjects, treating them with a respect that few of them had experienced before. Bernal photographed people in their homes, surrounded by the things that they loved most—a small religious shrine, family photographs, and dusty heirlooms. He saw each subject as an individual and tried to capture the person’s spirit in simple black-andwhite images. It was a job that he took very serious. As he told one student, “you like to take the easy photographs, great photographers don’t take the easy shots.” In 1984, Bernal, along with nine other top photographers, was invited to cover the Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. While others focused on capturing the athletes and the competition, Bernal was fascinated with the people in the stands, the vendors, and all the excitement, celebration, and ceremony of this special event. Five years later, in October 1989, Bernal was riding his bicycle to Pima College when a vehicle struck him. He was seriously injured and went into a coma from which he never emerged. Four years later, on his 52nd birthday, he died. Later that year, the fine-art gallery at Pima was renamed in his honor. An annual scholarship for a photography student was also set up in his name.
