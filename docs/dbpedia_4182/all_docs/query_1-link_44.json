        "text": "Martin Lloyd: How am I supposed to tell a story without my lead character?\n\nCam Mitchell: Easy, just bring in a character to replace him.\n\nEveryone looks at Cam in silence\n\nCam Mitchell: ...What?\n\nA character who joins the cast as a replacement for a character who has left the show due to real-life distractions (contract negotiations, death, etc.) despite being integral to the plot or concept of the series. Invariably, this character fills the Stock Character slot left vacant by the departed, whether that be comic relief, intellectual, or musclebound bruiser.\n\nOften, the character has some twist or gimmick to make it seem as if the character is unique, and the writers aren't actually grasping at straws to salvage the year's worth of scripts already written.\n\nSome shows will take risks in such replacements, making the replacements truly different characters, rather than a similar character with a twist. That is much harder on the writers, since they can't simply tweak the scripts they had already written for the old character. Usually when this happens it is very intentional on the part of the production.\n\nThe vast majority of these replacements still take up the role of the previous character, such as a missing member of the Five-Man Band, but as to how much they resemble their predecessor is up for debate.\n\nJustified Trope in military and some business settings where there are specific roles.\n\nA Suspiciously Similar Substitute is dangerously prone to becoming hated by the fanbase, creating a Replacement Scrappy.\n\nFor very suspiciously similar substitutes, see Backup Twin. Compare Discard and Draw, which does the same sort of thing with superpowers instead of characters. The inversion, where the same character fills a different role, is Same Character but Different.\n\nCompare with Expy, Temporary Substitute, The Other Darrin, The Nth Doctor, Put on a Bus, Dropped a Bridge on Him, Role-Ending Misdemeanor, Counterpart Comparison, Replacement Love Interest, Anti-Hero Substitute (when the substitute is Darker and Edgier), and Suspiciously Similar Song (substitute in the form of a song).\n\nExamples of Suspiciously Similar Substitute include:\n\nAnime and Manga\n\nIn Naruto, Sai, the quiet, serious and emotionally distant ninja replaced Sasuke, the quiet, serious and emotionally distant ninja. It doesn't help that they look so similar, either. This fact is repeatedly lampshaded within the series. It is also somewhat ironic that the two resemble each other so, given that Sai quickly begins the Character Development that would start to bring him away from the stoicness he was known for originally, and Sasuke quickly begins to descend into complete insanity.\n\nIn Pokémon, the female soon-to-be-Gym-Leader Misty was replaced by the female coordinator character of May (and her brother Max), although the latter was indeed a distinctly different character. She was then replaced by the female coordinator character of Dawn in a straighter use of this trope.\n\nLest we forget Brock's one-season substitute with the artist Tracey (who was a rather different character).\n\nAs of Best Wishes, we have Cilan, who's basically Brock with more food focus and less lechery.\n\nIn terms of actual Pokémon, Jessie and James end up releasing their Victreebel (a fly-trap Pokémon), Weezing (a poisonous gas cloud Pokémon), and Arbok (a poisonous snake Pokémon). Later on, James acquires a Cacnea, which retains Victreebel's tendency to accidentally injure its owner in displays of affection, and Jessie gets a Seviper, which is...a poisonous snake Pokémon. Ash also gets a new bird Pokémon in every region which eventually is fully evolved (Pidgeot, Noctowl, Swellow and Staraptor, respectively).\n\nJames also gains a Carnivine, who bites him on the head to show its affection.\n\nThe character Priss from Bubblegum Crisis was originally going to be killed off and replaced by Vision, who was suspiciously similar (brown hair, kind of feisty, was a singer) but ultimately fans liked the character, so she wasn't killed off after all, thus avoiding the trope entirely.\n\nTenchi Muyo is unique in that the third OVA did something of an alternate continuity substitution. Mihoshi's partner in the Galaxy Police had long been Kiyone Makibi in the Universe and Tokyo continuities, but supplemental materials Kiyone was the name of Tenchi's Mother (The first movie, based off the first TV series, named her Achika). OVA 3 introduces us to Noike, who happens to be Mihoshi's previously not known to exist GXP partner, while Tenchi's mother is finally officially named as Kiyone(and (re)introduced, in a way, by Tenchi's older sister who is strangely identical to her).\n\nNear from Death Note.\n\nJustified, since Near tries to imitate L and eventually admits that he failed to imitate L, but succeeded through Teeth-Clenched Teamwork.\n\nKaioh, the main antagonist of Fist of the North Star 2, has many similar characteristics to Raoh, the antagonist from the first series, including the fact that they rode huge elephant-sized horses. He is eventually revealed to be Raoh's blood-related older brother.\n\nThere's also the renegade Gento successors, Boltz and Taiga, who appear only in the anime to replace Jakoh's sons, Sheeno and Jask, from the manga.\n\nShikabane Hime's Keisei dies, allowing Ouri to come closer to Makina and to also be brought into the story as a major player instead of a male damsel in distress and hapless bystander. About 2 episodes later Keisei's mentor is introduced. He has a very similar hairstyle and replaces the former as the even more perverted comic relief and Ouri's new mentor.\n\nIn Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Neil Dilandy, killed late in the 1st series, is replaced by his twin brother Lyle Dilandy.\n\nOne of the supporting characters in D.Gray-man was killed. He was replaced by his equally chubby and androgynous sister.\n\nIn Inuyasha: The Final Act, Kagura is pretty quickly killed off and replaced with Byakuya, who is more-or-less identical but for a gender-switch and a loyalty reset.\n\nIn Patlabor, Takeo Kumagami replaces Kanuka Clancy after Clancy returns to America. They have very similar skills and fulfill the same police positions, although Kumagami is given a few quirks to distinguish her.\n\nScattorshot in Transformers Cybertron is an Expy of Ironhide from Transformers Energon. Likewise, the Jones family in Energon is this to the Witwickys from Transformers Generation 1.\n\nComic Books\n\nX-Men‍'‍s Jean Grey, during periods when she has been rendered temporarily dead or otherwise unusable, has been substituted numerous times, most notably by her Alterniverse daughter, Rachel. Now we currently have Hope Summers, the first mutant born after the Decimation events. She looks like a teenaged Jean, wears the same colors as she had, and even displays similar Phoenix-like powers.\n\nAs a long-running tradition in X-Men, the team roster always has to include one plucky, Badass Adorable teenage girl who adopts Wolverine as a Big Brother Mentor. When the character grows out of the role, she's always replaced by another one. Kitty Pryde started the tradition, and her replacements have included Jubilee, Marrow, Armor, Pixie, and X-23. Marrow shook up the tradition a bit by having Gambit as her mentor instead, but the writers cut out the middleman with X-23 by making her Wolverine's female clone (the closest thing to an actual little sister Wolvie's ever going to get).\n\nParodied in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Black Dossier, where we're told the British Government, in assembling the 1950s League, tried to find substitutes of the entire 1890s League. It didn't work.\n\nW.E. John's Worrals for Mina; Hotspur's Wolf of Kabul for Alan; Peter Brady (TV's first Invisible Man) for Griffin; Professor Grey (from The Beano strip The Iron Fish) for Nemo; and a giant robot called the Iron Warrior (from Thrill Comics) for Hyde.\n\nThis went as far as to have Wolf hit on Worrals, when Worrals was openly gay.\n\nThe Pre-Crisis version of Jason Todd, who took over the role of Batman's sidekick Robin after Dick Grayson became Nightwing, was a carbon copy of Dick Grayson right down to having a similar origin story (his parents were acrobats murdered by Killer Croc). This was averted with the Post-Crisis version, which revised Jason's origin as a street hoodlum who was picked up by Batman. Oddly enough, Pre-Crisis Todd was a red-haired boy who dyed his hair black, while Post-Crisis Todd was naturally black-haired.\n\nNow he's back to being a red-head. Appropriate, given his current nom de guerre.\n\nBut wait, post relaunch: black hair, no white stripe, and this is his natural colour again.\n\nIn a rather peculiar example, when the Batgirl mantle was returned to Barbara Gordon from Stephanie Brown following Flashpoint, Barbara's personality appeared to shift to be closer to Lighter and Softer Stephanie's, so she was a similar replacement to her replacement's replacement. Incidentally becoming the Replacement Scrappy to the Replacement Scrappy, yet both of whom have Vocal Minority fanbases. The Batgirl question is a massive Base Breaker with a lot of Executive Meddling.\n\nWhen Grant Morrison was writing JLA, he was unable to use Hawkman because the character's Continuity Snarl had become such a problem. Instead, he created the replacement character Zauriel. He even hangs a lampshade on it by having Aquaman briefly mistake Zauriel for Hawkman in his first appearance.\n\nA cross between this and Psycho Rangers happens with Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers; villainous ranged-combat expert Bullseye imitates heroic archer Hawkeye, the new Venom symbiote imitates Spider-Man, Wolverine's psychotic son takes his place, and so on.\n\nIn JLA comics, Vibe was a member of the poorly received Detroit League who, like the other newcomers to the team introduced in that run, had a stroke of misfortune or two when the roster needed to be cleared up for a new team. In his case, he died. Later, the Conglomorate, a rival team to the Justice League, is formed, featuring Vibe's identically-powered brother Reverb (as well as Vibe's JL teammate Gypsy). This was written by the same writer who killed off Vibe in the first place, mind you; of course, Reverb lacks Vibe's out-there personality and is generally unlikable for the opposite reason.\n\nJohn Byrne's run on Wonder Woman dumped the supporting cast established by the previous creative team, most notably archaeologist Julia Kapatelis and her daughter Vanessa, in favor of his own creations, most notably archaeologist Helena Sandsmark and her daughter Cassandra.\n\nLana Lang started her existence blatantly filling the role of Lois Lane when they started telling stories about Superman's childhood as Superboy. Unlike her modern incarnation, she was both the love interest and the nosy inquisitive girl always trying to prove Clark was Superboy.\n\nThe early 1960s Doctor Who comics had the Trods, who were a suspiciously similar substitute for the Daleks, who were unusable at the time due to the rights to publish Dalek comics being in the hands of a different company.\n\nFilm\n\nThe Godfather: Part II: Frank Pentangeli was a replacement character for Peter Clemenza.\n\nThe Godfather: Part III: Tom Hagen is written out (died in between sequels) and is replaced by the much less charismatic and interesting George Hamilton character, B.J. Harrison. This was done thanks to a paycheck dispute with Robert Duvall, forcing Francis Ford Coppola to create this new replacement from scratch.\n\nLt. Mauser replaced Capt. Harris in the 2nd & 3rd Police Academy, acting as that film's villain and having more or less the same traits has Harris had, filling the same role. They were so similar that when Harris returned in the 4th movie, he was paired of with Mauser's assistant, Proctor, and the two had the same relationship Mauser and Proctor had.\n\nThis is changed in the Animated Adaptation, where Mauser becomes a good guy, whereas Harris remains an antagonist.\n\nAlso, when Steve Guttenberg refused to reprise his role as Sgt. Mahoney for the 5th and 6th movies, Commandant Lassard's nephew Nick was brought in to fill Mahoney's shoes, while the 7th movie had a cadet named Kyle Connors also fill the very same spot.\n\nWhen the Wachowskis wrote the second and third Matrix films, they originally intended to bring back the character of Tank from the first one. But after they had a falling-out with his actor, they created Link as a replacement.\n\nRoman in Two Fast Two Furious replaced Dominic from The Fast and the Furious as the Anti-Hero with a criminal past. Though it's worth noting that Brian is now the main character with Roman as his sidekick, instead of co-lead with Dom.\n\nBoth Roman and Dom are back in Fast Five.\n\nBeerfest plays this one for gags, when Landfill dies and the character is promptly replaced by his twin brother, portrayed by the same actor, who asks the rest of the characters to refer to him by his dead brother's name and never speak of the death again.\n\nDon't forget him promptly sleeping with his dead brother's widow.\n\nNot to mention how Landfill pretty much told him everything about his friends, so he feels that he's already known them all his entire life.\n\nThe Keanu Reeves character in Speed was replaced by Jason Patric's character in the sequel, with Sandra Bullock being the holdover from the first film and having mentioned her previous relationship.\n\nA rather bizarre set of examples occurred within the Godzilla franchise regarding the monster Baragon. First, Destroy All Monsters was going to have Baragon be the monster seen destroying France. Unfortunately, the suit was too badly damaged and instead Gorosaurus was used (Ironically, the dub version still calls Gorosaurus \"Baragon\")...And Baragon himself was reduced to a mere 10 second cameo. Later, Baragon was going to appear in Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla but the suit was still too damaged to function and Anguirus was used instead. In both cases, Anguirus and Gorosaurus were given traits that were originally attributed to Baragon (IE: Jumping and burrowing).\n\nAnd then averted in Godzilla Mothra King Ghidorah Giant Monsters All Out Attack!, when the director wanted to use Varan, Anguirus and Baragon as the Guardian Monsters, but the studio wanted more popular kaiju. This time, Baragon survived the axe.\n\nLos Superagentes: Nueva Generación. Unlike the recent sequels to Bañeros and Brigada Explosiva, the new characters were clearly meant to replace the originals, as per the original Tiburon and Delfin show up in insultingly short cameos as opposing to joining in the action. Worse, the original Mojarrita and Chief of Acuario don't even show up.\n\nJulio De Grazia (the original Mojarrita) died in 1989.\n\nJason replacing his own mother as the slasher in the Friday the 13 th sequels.\n\nThough he still had the same M.O. and a related motive, Jason was a markedly different killer than his mother (Mostly due to the fact that his mother had several \"higher-functions\" Jason lacked). Roy Burns from Part V (Following Jason being \"Killed Off for Real\"... for one film) would be a more \"traditional\" example. When disguised as Jason, Roy not only used his M.O. but also acted like Jason; silently determined instead of deceptive, crazy-violent and motive-hissing.\n\nWhen Crazy Ralph was killed in Part 2, audiences were introduced to very similar doomsayers in Part III and VIII.\n\nSubverted like no tomorrow in Scream 4. Characters are thrown at us as being replacements for the characters of the original film, but most of the new characters die, the apparent Sidney replacement turns out to be the killer, and we even get a subverted Billy replacement who is almost successfully framed for all the murders.\n\nJamie Kennedy as the new Mask in Son of the Mask.\n\nEvery Cenobite that follows Pinhead that is NOT Butterball, Chatterer or the Female Cenobite in the Hellraiser sequels.\n\nThe Marx Brothers - Allan Jones essentially takes over for Zeppo in A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races.\n\n\"Nigel\" appears to be a replacement Composite Character for Colin and Dennis Creevey in the Harry Potter adaptations. (Colin appeared in the second film, but the actor decided not to do any more after that. Dennis never appears in the films full stop, but he's a very minor character in the books anyway.)\n\nStar Wars: The Phantom Menace had Captain Panaka (Hugh Quarshie), Queen Amidala's bodyguard. After Quarshie was unable to make it to the location shooting for Attack of the Clones he was replaced in with Gregar Typho (Jay Laga'aia). Aside from the Eyepatch of Power, they're pretty much the same, both in appearance and personality, to the point that some viewers wondered why Captain Panaka was suddenly sporting an eyepatch.\n\nRockstar depicts such a replacement when the main character Chris, lead singer of a tribute band, is hired to replace his idol due to his intentionally similar appearance and slightly better vocals. The film culminates in Chris picking a fan out of the audience at a concert to replace himself.\n\nAlthough the film is based on actual events: Judas Priest replacing their original lead singer by picking the front man of a Priest tribute band.\n\nPlayed in The Gamers: Ambrose dies, to be replaced by the nearly-indistinguishable Magellan, with a heaping helping of Plug N Play Friends.\n\nIn The Room, the actor who plays Peter (essentially the voice of reason or the man who \"is always playing psychiatrist\") quit at some point during the shooting. Another actor replaced him and took the lines he would have had in a later scene. However the new character never has any formal introduction. It is just implied he is another friend.\n\nIn Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Jim Broadbent plays a character meant to be a stand-in for Marcus Brody, who had died since the last movie, just as the actor Denholm Elliott had died in between films.\n\nDuke in City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold is a suspiciously similar substitute for his deceased identical twin Curly. Granted, his personality is different enough (less of a Jerk with a Heart of Gold, more Machiavellian) not to be cause for viewers to truly cry foul (there are shades of the Evil Twin trope here), but he's a suspiciously similar substitute all the same.\n\nAlso in City Slickers II Bruno Kirby did not return from the first movie, so his spot was filled by Jon Lovitz, playing Billy Crystal's annoying brother.\n\nQuarrel Jr., in Live and Let Die is a Suspiciously Similar Substitute for his father, Quarrel, who was killed Dr. No. This is because the films were made in a different order from the books, where Quarrel gets introduced in Live and Let Die, before being killed in Dr. No.\n\nGrindor from Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. He looks exactly like Blackout in both shape, size, appearance and alt-mode (they both turn into helicopters).\n\nAlso, Megan Fox's Mikaela being replaced by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's Carly.\n\nEd Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space. Bela Lugosi died minutes into filming the movie (actually, he died before production started, but Wood used recycled film to include him in the motion picture at all), so Wood hired his dentist to fill in for Lugosi, holding a cape over his face to disguise the considerable differences between him and Lugosi.\n\nActually, it was his wife's chiropractor.\n\nIn the second Rescuers film (which takes place in Australia), the role of Orville Albatross is replaced by that of his brother, Wilbur.\n\nThe Third Stooge. While Shemp was not Suspiciously Similar, Curly Joe was trying to copy the more popular (than Shemp) original Curly.\n\nCurly had two Suspiciously Similar Substitutes: Joe Besser and (Curly) Joe DeRita.\n\nLiterature\n\nThe 1996 Star Wars spin-off, Shadows of the Empire (novel, comic book, video game, and breakfast cereal), being set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, found a replacement character for Han Solo in the lovable scamp Dash Rendar. Dash not only sported Han's in-your-face attitude, he flew a nearly identical ship to the Millennium Falcon and had a wacky robot sidekick. Though hastily offed when he no longer served a purpose, Dash apparently still exists in the hazier reaches of the \"Expanded Universe.\"\n\nOh, there are plenty of other substitutes. Ben in LOTF's a substitute for Anakin; Tahiri even tries to seduce him...and he's 13!\n\nGavin Darklighter, who is the cousin of Biggs Darklighter.\n\nHeck, with the repeated \"new Dark Lords\" and \"new superweapons,\" the WHOLE Expanded Universe should be called Shadows of the Empire!\n\nAfter Ned Stark's death at the end of A Game of Thrones, Davos Seaworth shows up to serve the function of The Stoic, family and honor oriented, speaker-of-truth-to-power to a Baratheon king. They even mirror each other in interesting ways, particularly their fates ( Ned is killed in a last minute whim of Joffrey's, Davos miraculously survives his ship's sinking) compared to their children's ( Ned's children find ways to thrive in adversity, while four of Davos' sons are killed in battle).\n\nOberyn \"The Red Viper\" Martel was Too Cool to Live, and fans have suspected that The Scrappy Gerold \"Darkstar\" Dayne was created as one of these. Both men are the black sheep of their families and have badass reputations and are known by cool nicknames. More to the point, both men are from the some place and Dayne interacts with Oberyn's family members.\n\nA meta-example in Neal Stephenson's The Baroque Cycle: Daniel Waterhouse notes that some people can be replaced in their positions with only the most superficial elements changing, but other people are more crucial to the story, and their loss will forever change the status quo no matter who replaces them.\n\nIn Death series: Eternity In Death has Eve and Peabody questioning the housekeeper who worked for the murder victim. Then they go to see the murder victim's friend, whose housekeeper might have been a clone of the previous one. The story states that the two housekeepers are sisters.\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nStargate SG-1. Jonas Quinn was sort of like Daniel Jackson... but from another planet! However, after Michael Shanks decided to return as a regular, Jonas Quinn was abruptly and permanently written out of the series at the beginning of the seventh season.\n\nQuinn sometimes had knowledge that made very little sense for an alien. Daniel, of course, was a linguist and archaeologist who had spent his career studying Earth languages and cultures. How Quinn, an alien, was able to spontaneously recognize markings on an alien ship as similar to ancient Celtic is unclear.\n\nDespite being the Trope Namer for a while, Jonas Quinn wasn't even the best example of this trope on this show. Cam Mitchell, an Air Force colonel with a snarky sense of humor and a tendency to make pop culture references (like the actor Browder's character in Farscape) replaced Richard Dean Anderson's character, Jack O'Neill, when he started Commuting on a Bus to spend more time with his family. This somewhat falls under the \"military role\" exception, but is more likely due to a desire to have a new leading man, particularly one with a built-in audience. In addition, the \"military role\" exception doesn't explain their sufficiently similar personalities; Mitchell hadn't Seen It All like O'Neill, had a lower rank and lacks the Ancient gene, but other than that they could have delivered the same lines.\n\nThis trope received its Lampshade Hanging (along with about a hundred others) in \"200,\" when an actor backs out from playing the lead in the Show Within a Show based on the SG team's adventures, leading to the page quote above. And at the end, we find out the \"Colonel Danning\" character from Wormhole X-Treme! was substituted. \"Dr. Levant\" is not indicated to have had a Suspiciously Similar Substitute when he left the show, but much like the real Stargate SG-1, they may have resolved to never speak of it.\n\nStaite's Dr. Keller also replaced Dr. Beckett on Stargate Atlantis as the caring and sometimes out of his/her element doctor, despite having appeared on the series previously as a different character.\n\nMade easier because the 'other character' was a Wraith, requiring full makeup and making her all but unrecognizable, even for those watching for her.\n\nSupernatural has Balthazar, who's very, very similar to the now-dead Gabriel, much to the displeasure of half the fandom.\n\nOne could argue that Crowley is the suspiciously similar substitute, assuming of course that the show even needed to replace Gabriel in the first place.\n\nLater in the series, fans commented that the character \"Frank\" was just an unnecessary replacement for Bobby, who was taken away from the leads to supposedly \"strip the show back down to just the brothers.\"\n\nDavid Spade's and James Garner's characters on 8 Simple Rules.\n\nOn Cheers, the sweet-natured, dimwitted old bartender Coach was replaced by the sweet-natured, dimwitted young bartender Woody Boyd. Rebecca Howe (a ruthless and hot corporate exec) was more distinct from her predecessor Diane (a bookish and pretty in a girl-next-door-way barmaid), but Rebecca gradually became more and more like Diane.\n\nShe was a brunette.\n\nAl, the elderly man who sat at the opposite corner of the bar from Norm and occasionally made sarcastic comments, was replaced by Phil, the elderly man who sat at the opposite corner of the bar from Norm and occasionally made sarcastic comments. In the Reunion Show episode of Frasier, Frasier says how good it is to see Al again, only to be told \"I'm Phil, you jackass! Al died!\"\n\nSpeaking of Frasier, this trope was neatly deconstructed/lampshaded with Mel Karnofski, Niles' Romantic False Lead between divorcing Maris and getting together with Daphne. Mel was a blatantly obvious slightly-milder carbon-copy of Maris (or rather, Maris's actions and descriptions given a more subtle form and voice), paralleling her in everything from being a manipulative and domineering Jerkass to her hysterical, unstable, mood-swinging, and obsessively fussy and neurotic behavior—and Niles is unable to see it. Frasier outright tells Niles that he's repeating a horrible pattern (Maris was quite emotionally abusive and generally had an adverse effect on Niles' mental state), and speculates that he's just jumping at the chance for someone comfortingly familiar due to the fact that Daphne is getting engaged and he (apparently) no longer has a chance with her.\n\nPhil Capra (for Joel Fleischman) on Northern Exposure.\n\nIn season 3 of Lost, the Others' chief tough guy, Danny Pickett, was replaced by Ryan Pryce a few episodes after the former's death.\n\nBram first appears in the same episode in which Ceaser dies (the actor didn't want to stay in Hawaii) and takes over his role, which was promised to be important at least for the season.\n\nAgents Doggett and Reyes on The X-Files.\n\nAlso the various informants, starting with Deep Throat, coming into X, and finishing with Marita Covarrubias.\n\nOne case was forced: \"Travelers\" and \"Agua Mala\" featured Arthur Dales, the first FBI agent to deal with X-Files. Dales' actor Darren McGavin suffered a stroke filming \"The Unnatural\", leading him to be replaced with M. Emmet Walsh playing his brother Arthur Dales, a former police officer (who lampshades his parents didn't have much creativity with names). To make it worse, both Dales were played in flashbacks by the same actor.\n\nMash replaced half its original cast during its run, but averted the trope somewhat by making sure the new characters were differentiated in various ways from their predecessors. B.J. Hunnicutt was a family man while Trapper John was a womanizer, Charles Winchester was a snooty but highly competent Jerk with a Heart of Gold to Frank Burns' incompetent Jerkass, and Col. Potter was an old school war veteran and taskmaster while Col. Blake was oblivious to almost everything.\n\nThis is actually lampshaded depressingly in the episode \"Depressing News,\" when Hawkeye is lamenting to B.J. how the war rolls on even as the people fighting it are killed or replaced (using the surplus tongue depressors that have been shipped to the 4077th as a visual aid):\n\nObviously, the Hawkeye switch was in the \"Maudlin\" position.\n\nRadar wasn't given a replacement character but instead his duties were handed off to Klinger.\n\nSgt. Luther Rizzo is arguably a substitute for Sgt. Zelmo Zale.\n\nCapt. Oliver Hudson on SeaQuest DSV.\n\nLonnie Henderson is probably a better example, going so far as to step in as Ford's love interest in season 2 to replace Katie Hitchcock.\n\nIda Mae Brindle on Small Wonder.\n\nJeffrey Sinclair and John Sheridan (both J.S.'s, like creator J. Michael Straczynski), and, later, Susan Ivanova and Elizabeth Lochley, on Babylon 5. The difference between the two changes and their effect on the show is marked, as was general reaction.\n\nIvanova was herself a Suspiciously Similar Substitute for Laurel Takashima from the Pilot Movie Babylon 5: The Gathering.\n\nThat's how it ended up, but according to JMS that wasn't the original intention. The two characters were originally supposed to coexist until the end of the second season when Laurel would turn out to be The Mole and leave the show (written in because JMS knew Tamlyn Tomita wouldn't want to commit to five years) and Ivanova would become the executive officer... but then Tamlyn Tomita decided not to come back for the series at all.\n\nLikewise, Talia Winters replaced Lyta Alexander when the series began; in a recursive twist, though, when Andrea Thompson decided to leave the show, they brought back Lyta in a double-un-Suspiciously Similar Substitute maneuver.\n\nWord of God admits this was a blatant Bridge Drop. Talia's actress was clamoring for more screen time and generally being a pain to work with, so JMS unceremoniously fired her. Additionally served as a standing notice to other cast that Anyone Can Die, in addition to the flexibility mentioned below.\n\nStephen Franklin replaced Benjamin Kyle. Noticing a pattern yet? Hell, let's face it - if this wiki had been around ten years ago, the page you're reading would be called \"John Sheridan.\"\n\nStraczynski has stated that every major character on the show had an \"escape hatch\" for each season, to allow the actor to be replaced if necessary without affecting the overall story arc.\n\nBabylon 5 did this with alien species too. After the Shadows left the galaxy, a suspiciously similar race called the Hand appeared.\n\nFlo replacing the deceased Selma on Night Court. Flo then also died a year later, leading to the younger Roz. (Also on this show, Lana was replaced by Mac, and Liz was replaced by Billie, then Christine).\n\nOn Threes Company, Dumb Blonde Chrissy being replaced by her cousin, Dumb Blonde Cindy.\n\nOliver (for Jeff) on Coupling\n\nMystery Science Theater 3000 is an interesting case. All characters other than the robots had been replaced by the show's end, yet the writers took care to make the replacement (and their interaction with the rest of the cast) different from the departing character. Consequently, there's no real consensus among the fans whether any given replacement was better or worse than the original. It also helps that each replacement actor was either behind the scenes since the start, or with the team for ages before they got in front of the camera, so none of them were really \"new.\"\n\nJoel was sort of a father figure to the 'bots. His replacement, Mike, interacted with the 'bots as their equal (at best) and tended to be more overtly sarcastic. The flame wars over which of the two was better are notorious.\n\nTV's Frank was Dr. Clayton Forrester's minion and punching-bag; when he departed, he was replaced by Pearl Forrester, Clayton's mom and one of the few people capable of cowing her son into submission. After Clayton departed, Pearl took over as the head Mad, and gained her own minions, Bobo and Observer.\n\nTV's Frank himself being a replacement for Dr Erhardt, who \"went missing\" after the first season. Prompting Joel to remark during \"Earth vs. The Spider\" when a character who looked alot like Dr Erhardt was eaten \"So THATS what happened to him!\"\n\nThe actor playing Dr. Erhardt also provided the voice of Tom Servo during the show's first Comedy Channel season. When he left, and Kevin took over for Tom Servo in season 2, a fan mailed in an 11-page long banner screaming \"I HATE SERVO'S NEW VOICE\". (\"Does he realize,\" Kevin later commented, \"That he just sent hate mail to a puppet?\")\n\nSikozu replacing Jool, who initially replaced Zhaan on Farscape.\n\nNoranti somehow replaces Zhaan, as \"cleric/spiritual leader/healer\" on the ship too.\n\nThis was more of Zhaan being replaced by two characters: her science side by Jool and her spiritual side by Stark. Then Jool is replaced by Sikozu and Stark by Noranti.\n\nCrichton lampshades this series of changes by simply calling Sikozu \"the new girl\" in the Season 4 opener. By this time even he's blasé about the Combo-Platter Powers of the various new additions.\n\nSergeant Baker replaced Sergeant Kinchloe as 'radio operator who happens to be black' on Hogan's Heroes in the final season. Unfortunately, unlike Kinchloe, Baker didn't have much characterization outside 'radio operator who happens to be black' and wasn't the most satisfying of replacements.\n\nAn interesting exception can be found on A Different World. Originally it was a star vehicle created for Lisa Bonet by Bill Cosby's production house, but after Bonet's 1988 pregnancy forced her from the program after the first season, no substitute for her was cast. Instead, it became an ensemble show, and eventually two minor characters—Dwayne Wayne and Whitley Gilbert—evolved into its real stars and carried the show for five more years.\n\nStep by Step replaced Cody (upon actor Sasha Mitchell's run-in with the law) with Bronson Pinchot's character, who, despite being French, was essentially the wacky roommate Cody was in every way.\n\nThey also had the character of Flash, nicknamed because he was an adult with the hyperactivity of a 4 year old. Essentially another Cody given a justification.\n\nIn Heroes, West's relationship with Claire leaves him as little more than a straight version of Zach. The writers tried to cover this up by giving him the power of flight/levitation but his lines and role as a foil character made it obvious.\n\nFor one season of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Dr. Kate Pulaski (played by Diana Muldaur, who'd appeared twice as different characters in the Original Series) replaced Dr. Beverly Crusher as ship's doctor.\n\nPulaski was indeed a Suspiciously Similar Substitute, but not for Crusher. She shared far more personality traits with McCoy.\n\nIn a case falling halfway between Suspiciously Similar Substitute and The Nth Doctor, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine replaced Jadzia Dax with Ezri Dax in the final season: different hosts, same symbiote, and a Trill's personality is a blend of the host and symbiote.\n\nIn the early production of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Kira Nerys was actually a replacement character for Ro Laren, because the actress that played Ro in the Star Trek: The Next Generation declined the offer to appear in Deep Space Nine\n\nThe exact same thing happened in the early production of Star Trek: Voyager: B'Elanna Torres was also a replacement character for Ro Laren, because Michelle Forbes again refused to commit to a seven-year show.\n\nAnd Tom Paris was a suspiciously similar substitute for a character the same actor played on Next Gen for various complex reasons.\n\nTo complete a common pattern, T'Pol was originally written to be T'Pau, a Vulcan priestess who appeared in the Original Series and in Star Trek III: The Search For Spock. But since it was thought at the time that reusing a character would force them to pay royalties to the writer who created the original T'Pau, the character was changed. T'Pau did appear in the fourth season during a story arc on Vulcan. It was some years later that a judge in California ruled that such a reuse would not force a producer to pay royalties to the original writer. (This, incidentally, is one of the reasons why Nicholas Locarno in TNG became Tom Paris in Voyager).\n\nTaurik, a Vulcan Ensign who appeared in a single episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, became a recurring crew member in Voyager, where he was called Vorik, for the same reason that Locarno became Paris and T'Pau became T'Pol. Jeri Taylor, a producer on Voyager and the mother of the actor (Alexander Enberg) who played Taurik and Vorik, once quipped that the rhymedly named Vulcan Ensigns were identical twin brothers.\n\nActually this trope has been in Star Trek from the start were Captain Pike is replaced after the Pilot with Captain Kirk. Both are square jawed, two fisted adventurers with a close friendship with the ship's physician and a mild romantic interest in a female yeoman.\n\nPike was not exactly an established character, though, since the pilot was not shown in the series' regular run. Yes, it was chopped up to become the story-within-a-story of \"Menagerie\" but that was run well after Kirk was established as Captain.\n\nThe characters of TOS were based on the characters originally conceived for the rejected pilot, with Pike becoming Kirk, Boyce becoming Bones, Smith becoming Rand, etc.. This practice is extremely commonplace when a Pilot turns into a green-lighted series. Similarly, the characters of TNG were based on the characters of the abandoned \"Star Trek: Phase II\" series: Will Decker became the similarly-named Will Riker; Decker's old flame, the empathic Deltan Ilia, became Riker's old flame, the empathic Betazed Troi; and Xon, the Vulcan struggling to understand humanity, became Data, the android struggling to understand humanity. A writer's strike proved to be nothing more than a minor inconvenience for TNG: they just dusted off some old \"Phase II\" scripts and went to work.\n\nAnd, of course, Xon was created to replace Spock when Leonard Nimoy decided he didn't want to do the \"Phase II\" series.\n\nCaptain Picard is based on Captain Pike.\n\nOne of the world's few substitute anticipations happened in the kids' series Space Cases. With Jewel Staite having Flash Forward hanging in the balance, her character, Catalina, was given an \"imaginary friend\" named Suzee, who was really a person living in Another Dimension that Catalina could communicate with. When the other series required Ms. Staite's services, a little Applied Phlebotinum switched Suzee to the real world (as played by Rebecca Herbst) and Catalina to the \"imaginary\" world.\n\nBeakmans World substituted its lovely young female assistant not once, but twice. Both were a result of the show's fate: The first switch happened as the show moved to CBS from syndication, and the second happened after an Un-cancellation.\n\nMany older kids shows, like You Can't Do That on Television and Kids Incorporated, substituted the entire cast, and Kids Incorporated did so repeatedly. Their reasoning is likely similar to why the Vienna Boys' Choir and Menudo boot their kids out at 13.\n\nSimilarly, the late 80s-early 90s incarnation of The Mickey Mouse Club turned over its cast a few times. Notables in the mix include Keri Russell (as part of the first rotation of new blood) and Britney Spears (as part of one of the last rotations).\n\nThe UK kids' show Why Dont You... is another example, but is had one notable exception in its later years: Ben, the Welsh Mad Scientist, was evidently considered un-substitutable, so he continued past the typical age, eventually playing a Holly-style computer program based on the original Ben, so that the disparity between his age and the rest of the cast wasn't an issue.\n\nBefore the series adopted its Japanese counterpart's format of each season essentially being a standalone show, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers did have some cast changes, always preserving the number of Token Minority characters. The second Pink Ranger, Katherine Hillard, is an especially egregious example, not being much like her predecessor before becoming a Ranger, but then rapidly becoming her clone. (Dark Action Girls take heed: Good Is Dumb).\n\nLet's not forget Power Rangers Zeo where they replaced the African-American yellow ranger Aisha with a girl in Africa who she was apparently Switched At Birth with.\n\nThey did manage a successful change in Power Rangers Lost Galaxy, where actress Valerie Vernon had to leave due to being diagnosed with leukemia. Originally they were going to take the previous pink ranger and bring her in as a replacement, but when that deal fell through, they took the previous season's reformed Big Bad, Karone, and made her the replacement. In this case, the character was vastly different because she had aspects of The Atoner.\n\nAnother successful change was Adam Park, the second Black Ranger. While Zack was fun-loving and energetic, Adam was fairly quiet and thoughtful. Early on, this was pretty much all his character had to him, but an ad-lib in The Movie (his dejected \"I'm a frog...\" when finding out what his spirit animal is) gave him some Woobie points and being the second-longest serving ranger gave him fairly decent character development. He's one of the most popular characters in the series now and the only pre-Disney buyout ranger to appear in the 15th anniversary Reunion Show.\n\nThe original Kamen Rider was forced to do this with Takeshi Hongo/Kamen Rider 1 after Hiroshi Fujioka broke his leg while attempting a stunt. Unlike many examples of this trope, however, the replacement character (Hayato Ichimonji/Kamen Rider 2) is remembered fondly by the fanbase and has become just as much a fixture of the franchise as his predecessor, and when the former returned to the show, the two are often paired under the nickname \"Double Riders.\"\n\nKamen Rider Decade has done this to most of the cast of the shows they visited, using the conceit of Alternate Universes. Sometimes these changes are justified (for instance Kamen Rider Kuuga's actor considers the series an Old Shame). However, a good number of actors have returned to play their original characters as well, even if they're also AU incarnations.\n\nThe old-school Riders had a recurring, cross-seasonal ally named Tobei Tachibana. He started out as Hongo's friend who ran the motorbike racing club, but got more and more involved with things Rider-related just due to being close to the guys trouble followed most, becoming something of a Badass Normal. When The Powers That Be decided to bring the character back in Kamen Rider Skyrider but the actor declined, the Tachibana role in that and the following series went to the nigh-identical Genjiro Tani. His personality and role were exactly Tachibana's, and sometimes past Riders talked to Tani as if they knew him much better than they did, as if scripts with Tachibana in mind had already been written. They really shoulda gone the Magic Plastic Surgery route.\n\nThe Metal Heroes series Space Sheriff Gavan had Gavan's Bridge Bunny Mimi leave to see to her ill mother for the last 3rd or so of the series, and replaced with a character called Marin who was basically the exact same character minus the Love Interest part (since Mimi was only leaving for a short while so her and Gavan were still technically in a relationship) Unlike most examples though Marin was already an established character on the show as a Bridge Bunny to Gavan's Mission Control and was specifically called in to fill in for Mimi.\n\nWill Bailey on The West Wing appears to have begun as a Suspiciously Similar Substitute for Sam Seaborn (right down to several \"passing the torch\" incidents in which Sam encouraged Toby to accept Will's help with the Inauguration speech, Will was semi-formally inducted into Sam's old position, etc.), but the writing of the show shifted after Aaron Sorkin's departure, and within a year Will's character had shifted jobs into the Vice-President's office and was portrayed more as a cynical political operative than as an idealist.\n\nJoshua Malina (Will) has even described himself as a worse-looking, less-expensive Rob Lowe (Sam).\n\nWhich you have to admit has a grain of truth to it.\n\nNot to mention Joe Quincy (Matthew Perry), who was hired to fill a position opened by Ainsley Hayes (Emily Procter), a \"blonde, leggy Republican.\" Yeah, he was a Republican too. Josh doesn't like that the similarities end there.\n\nThe TV show Maverick introduced a Suspiciously Similar Substitute before the star left, in the form of Bret Maverick's brother, Bart. This was principally done in order to accelerate the show's shooting schedule, since they could shoot a Bret episode and a Bart episode at the same time. Reportedly, the show's writers had no idea whether a given episode would be a Bret episode or a Bart episode when they wrote it. By the show's end there were two other Mavericks in rotation, one of them played by Roger Moore. The most suspiciously similar of them all was Brent Maverick, who was introduced shortly after James Garner (who played Bret Maverick) left the show. Not only was Brent's name just one letter off from Bret's, but he was played by Robert Colbert, who bears a remarkable likeness to Garner. When Colbert discovered the producers' plan for him, he rebelled against them, reportedly begging them to, \"Put me in a dress and call me Brenda! ANYTHING but this!\"\n\nSpeaking of Profiler's, for that show's final season, exit Ally Walker, enter Jamie Luner.\n\nExit off-screen nemesis Jack, enter off-screen nemesis Damian Kennasas.\n\nTo an extent, Hugh Laurie in the third and fourth series of Blackadder seems to have filled this role (aristocratic fop) in replacement of Tim McInnerny from the first two series, after McInnerny left because he didn't want to be typecast. When McInnerny rejoined the regular cast in the fourth series, his character resembled that played by Stephen Fry (brown-nosing rival) in the second series, with Fry in turn now playing a character more akin to that of Brian Blessed and Miranda Richardson respectively (insane tyrant) in the first two series. This slightly convoluted game of \"musical chairs\" in regards to actors and characters appears however to have been of little detriment to the series.\n\nNancy Oleson on Little House On the Prairie is a replacement for long-time nemesis, Nellie Oleson. This is lampshaded in the episode where the Olesons adopt her, as Harriet mentions how she looks \"just like Nellie\" while Nels later ruefully acknowledges that she acts just like Nellie, too.\n\nNancy was Nellie on steroids; actually vicious enough to unthinkingly put people's lives in danger, much like their mother. When Nell returns for a visit, even she is struck by the resemblance—and put off as well, fearing her mother is making the same mistakes—which was an understatement.\n\nRobin of Sherwood replaced Michael Praed's Robin of Locksley with Jason Connery's Robert of Huntingdon, tying two contradictory legends together by making Robin Hood a Legacy Character.\n\nThe BBC version of Robin Hood appeared to be about to do this too. Season 3, episode 10 invented a backstory for Robin Hood and Guy of Gisbourne that created a mutual half-brother for the characters. Both Jonas Armstrong (Robin) and Richard Armitage (Guy) were expected to leave the show at the end of the third season, presumably to be replaced by their brother Archer. Then the show was cancelled.\n\nLikewise, on the BBC version, the character of Marian was replaced with Kate...who had the same personality as her predecessor, only blonde and poor (and shrill). The result was cringe-inducing considering that Kate was written as arrogant, impetuous, and initially antagonistic toward Robin, just as Marian was. What the writers failed to realize was that such traits are understandable and even endearing in a privileged noblewoman who had been jilted by Robin, but completely nonsensical in a peasant girl who had no reason to be any of these things.\n\nLaw and Order has always had six main characters: two detectives, their chief, the DA, the executive assistant DA, and a regular assistant DA. Given that the series lasted for 20 seasons, all six roles have been substituted as actors move on, some of them several times over. It also helps that the show is heavily story-based, and not too dependent on characterizations.\n\nLaw and Order Special Victims Unit has seen this a few times; while actress Mariska Hargitay was away due to pregnancy, her character Olivia Benson was briefly replaced by arguable Canon Sue Dani Beck, who spoke fluent French, physically assaulted perps without consequence, was famous for her effectiveness in fighting crime, had a cool personal PDA/GPS system that she flashed around a few times, and had the romantic affair with Elliot that fans wanted him to have with Olivia. In general, the fandom doesn't miss her.\n\nSimilarly, the ADA's in SVU get replaced. Most people didn't mind the Alex Cabot replacement by Casey Novak (they have very different personalities), but the ADA who replaced Novak for Season 10 was a mediocre blend of both of them, with a dash of Informed Ability to boot. \"They used to call me the Crusader.\" Fan backlash led to them bringing back Alex.\n\nCoy and Vance replaced Bo and Luke Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard. They were such substitutes, they even had the same hair color.\n\nBut they did swap shirt colors with the originals.\n\nOf course, the following season Bo and Luke were brought back, and Coy and Vance were never heard of again.\n\nDeputy Cletus Hogg, although his initial appearance on the show preceded Enos' departure for his own series, and he was allowed to stay on even after Enos returned.\n\nRoscoe was also replaced briefly by two different sheriffs - including The Other Darrin himself.\n\nIn the Australian teen series Wicked Science, the girl in Toby's group, Dina, was replaced by Toby's cousin Sasha in Season 2.\n\nMr. Harmon, Old Mr. Grace, and Mr. Spooner replacing Mr. Mash, Young Mr. Grace and Mr. Lucas on Are You Being Served.\n\nAlso Mr Grainger, the head of menswear, was replaced by Tebbs, Goldberg, Klein, and Grossman before they eliminated role and made Mr Humphries head of the department.\n\nCharlie Crawford replaced Mike Flaherty as the Deputy Mayor on Spin City. The key difference was that Charlie was a Handsome Lech and Mike wasn't.\n\nCharlie Crawford was played by Charlie Sheen, who also played Charlie Harper in Two and A Half Men. Sheen ended up getting fired from the show due to his drug problems and for making derogatory remarks about the show's creator and executive producer. Harper was killed off and replaced by Walden Schmidt, played by Ashton Kutcher. Both characters are immature womanizers.\n\nWhen Gomer Pyle left The Andy Griffith Show in 1964 for his own spin-off, Gomer Pyle USMC (of \"'PYYYYLE!'...'Shazam!'\" fame), he was replaced by equally hayseed cousin Goober Pyle.\n\nUp to that point, Goober was only referred to by Gomer as a running gag; his materializing as Gomer's replacement would be something like Seinfeld's Kramer being replaced by the infamous \"Bob Sacamano.\" Weird.\n\nWell, technically, Goober did appear in one episode (\"Fun Girls\") prior to Gomer's departure from Mayberry.\n\nWarren Ferguson and (arguably) Howard Sprague, for Barney Fife.\n\nAndy's steady girlfriend in the first season was pharmacist Ellie Walker; after she was written out of the show (apparently due to lack of chemistry between Andy Griffith and Elinor Donahue), Andy was given a couple more temporary love interests before Helen Crump was finally introduced in season 3.\n\nWhen the show was retooled as Mayberry, R.F.D., Sam Jones and his son Mike essentially became the substitutes for Andy and Opie Taylor.\n\nIn Only Fools and Horses, when the actor playing Granddad died he was almost immediately replaced by his previously mentioned brother Uncle Albert.\n\nThe long-running Australian sitcom Hey Dad..! continued for a 13th and 14th season after the titular character left, with a family friend serving as an unofficial father figure. Over its long lifespan, the show had a nearly complete changeover of cast, with replacements alternating between thinly-disguised substitutes and unexplained Other Darrins.\n\nMy Three Sons did this a lot. They replaced grandpa Bub with Uncle Charlie. Later the oldest son left so the dad adopted the youngest son's friend.\n\nDoctor Who did this recently, when Howard Attfield, who played Donna Noble's father in \"The Runaway Bride,\" died during the filming of Series 4. They filled his role with Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins), who had been created as a one-off guest character in \"Voyage of the Damned\" and was promptly retconned as her maternal grandfather.\n\nThis is not the first time Cribbins has been a Doctor Who Suspiciously Similar Substitute; in the second of the 1960s non-canon movies, Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D., he plays Special Constable Tom Campbell, who replaces the character of Ian Chesterton who appeared in the corresponding episode from the TV show and who appeared in the earlier movie Dr. Who And The Daleks. A Joanie Quinn, Louise, also replaces Barbara.\n\nThe Doctor's regeneration was designed specifically to avoid this. Originally there was no plans for him to regenerate he wasn't even designated an alien, it only came about when William Hartnell had to leave the show due to health issues. A producer thought it would be a novel idea and thus the doctor as we know him was born.\n\nThe real offenders are the early companions. Once Barbara and Ian left, Steven replaced them. Before that, Vicki replaced Susan, and was later replaced herself by Dodo, with Sara and Katarina briefly holding the role. The companion model of a young heroic male and attractive young female was used as a counterpart to the older Hartnell, and the slightly old Troughton, at which point it was changed for a sidekick-type model. There were several exceptions -\n\nPolly and Ben were a pair, and separately didn't fit the ideas of a female and male companion. They were seen with Jamie, the new version of the young heroic male.\n\nThe original plans for Season 7 had Zoe as the Third Doctor's companion; when her actress declined to stay on, they created Liz, a similar Hot Scientist, to replace her.\n\nStephen Fry had to pull out of writing a script because he couldn't find the time to rewrite his episode to accommodate Martha Jones instead of Rose Tyler as the companion.\n\nTorchwood did this in Children of Earth with Lois, who fills the role Martha was joining to play had Freema Agyeman been available.\n\nSubverted hard in the same miniseries when a character who seems like he's being built up to be a substitute for Owen suddenly shoots Jack in the back, and then gets shot himself. RTD says this was intentional, because he thinks it's a disservice to characters to outright replace them with a Suspiciously Similar Substitute.\n\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures, as well as replacing Maria with Rani, plays with this in-universe a few times:\n\nLuke has a nightmare about being replaced in The Nightmare Man.\n\nIn Goodbye Sarah Jane Smith, Ruby attempts to become this for Sarah Jane.\n\nDue South did this surprisingly well, mixing in a bit of Sister Becky. One character is sent away \"under cover\" while the main character is out of town. The replacement is introduced as someone pretending to be that character, in order to maintain his cover.\n\nFor bonus points, the replacement is almost nothing like his predecessor, with almost everybody except Fraser seeming to be totally unaware of this\n\nChannel 4's Mockumentary series This is David Lander changed its title to This is David Harper when Stephen Fry was replaced by Tony Slattery.\n\nOn a similar note, a few years earlier, Stephen Fry was supposed to be the second regular on Whose Line Is It Anyway?, but backed out at the last minute (he didn't actually like doing improv that much). He was replaced by...Tony Slattery.\n\nStephen Fry and Tony Slattery were both members of the Cambridge Footlights at the same time, by the way. And Slattery took up the position of Footlights president after Fry's good friend and frequent collaborator Hugh Laurie served in that position for a year.\n\nNCIS did this on several occasions.\n\nAt the end of Season 2, NCIS agent Kate Todd is shot and killed by Ari Haswari, a Hamas terrorist working undercover within Mossad. Then at the beginning of Season 3, Mossad agent Ziva David, Ari's sister, joins the NCIS team as a Liaison Officer. Ziva resembles Kate physically- both are slim, brown eyed brunettes. And Ziva quickly picks up Kate's habit of engaging in rivalry, banter and Unresolved Sexual Tension with NCIS agent Tony DiNozzo. Otherwise, Kate and Ziva are quite different characters, but this is not a case of The Other Darrin.\n\nThe fifth season of NCIS ends on a Cliff Hanger which implies that Tony, Ziva, and McGee will all be substituted, and, indeed, the sixth season premiere shows Gibbs leading a new team, with establishing shots helpfully indicating which of the previous characters' niches the new agents fit into. The trope is then fairly quickly subverted and by the end of the second episode of the season, the team is reunited and back in business.\n\nSubverted in the 7th season opener when the team interviews replacements for Ziva. Two don't live up to their hype, and one came in at the wrong time. Ziva returns at the end, at least physically.\n\nSliders was rife with substituting toward the end, though most weren't very similar to those they replaced. However, Quinn got substituted when actor Jerry O Connell left, by way of The Nth Doctor by being \"fused\" with 'Mallory' (his non-identical counterpart from a parallel universe), at the same time Colin was Put on a Bus. But with a totally different personality and face, Quinn Mallory's substitute isn't the other Quinn Mallory. Hot Scientist Diana Davis takes his role as the scientific brains on the team.\n\nA certain segment of the fanbase believes that Arturo was substituted by his own alternate.\n\nTo be fair, the episode that this happens in allows for that interpretation as Arturo's villainous duplicate tries to replace him so he can escape his own world and just before they slide they are having a classic \"which is the real one?\" battle, and after the slide the Arturo who was left behind gives a quiet, \"Oh, my God.\"\n\nSeries creator Tracy Torme has tormented fans by saying that he knows which Arturo made the jump, but will never reveal it.\n\nDone by necessity quite a lot on gentle old dears' British comedy Last of the Summer Wine, as elderly cast members die off with inconvenient regularity. (Currently only one member of the original central trio is still alive).\n\nDone on Allo Allo when Mimi and Captain Bertorelli appeared as substitutes for Maria and the German Captain Hans respectively—in particular, Mimi was at least as short as Maria and both had fiery tempers. It allowed them to continue the gag of Mimi/Maria having to get a stool to stand on in order to hug René. Later, Monsieur Leclerc was replaced by his twin brother after the original actor died. Captain Bertorelli and the second Leclerc were then replaced in a The Other Darrin manner.\n\nAlso parodied in the series, when René's death was faked and he was forced to pose as his own Suspiciously Similar Substitute twin brother for the rest of the show.\n\nRené: \"I am also named René.\"\n\nThe German police drama Siska did this when they replaced the eponymous lead character with his never-before-mentioned brother after he was killed off.\n\nLuka Kovacs for Doug Ross in ER.\n\nMarried... with Children: Straitlaced banker Steve Rhoades (David Garrison) was Marcy's husband for four seasons, and then was replaced by pretty-boy Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley) when Garrison wanted to leave the show to avoid being typecast. This was rather a subversion because Jefferson was a completely different character than Steve.\n\nEverwood, for some extent at least: Linda and Amanda are both facing a tragedy of sorts, both feel uneasy around Nina (foreshadowing, much?) and both have a similar relationship with Andy: the rocky start, people against the affair, having a hard time fitting in Andy's family life, and finally breaking up over something directly related to the aforementioned tragedy. Amy's best friends, Laynie and Hannah (who never appeared simultaneously, although they'd be best friends themselves in Grey's Anatomy, same actresses, different characters), also share some traits: tragedy again (pretty much the common denominator for everybody in the show), introverted, both have an older brother (one of them dies and the other has a strong chance of inheriting Huntington's), both are somewhat \"dark\" and both girls click with Ephram instantly (Laynie actually dates him, Hannah is more a best friend / neighbour / like sibling type). Last but not least, Stephanie is in many ways a short-lived Madison II (college-girl, very different from Ephram, great with Deliah, kind with Amy in spite of her (Amy's) jealousy).\n\nTeachers initially both justified and averted it. It justified it because, in a school, teachers genuinely do come and go and get replaced, so it never seemed odd to have cast changes between series. They averted it by not replacing characters with direct clones, particularly after main character Simon left and the show became an ensemble piece. Unfortunately, after the third series, ensemble darkhorses Kurt and Brian left, along with Simon's arbitrary replacement Matt, to be replaced by Damien and Ben, substitutes for Kurt and Brian, and Ewan, a substitute for Simon. Cue Seasonal Rot and no fifth series.\n\nDr. Peele of American Gothic was this, replacing Dr. Crower—only to then be sent veering off in a different direction by being paired up with the Femme Fatale, then relegated to backburner status for the rest of the series.\n\nSandy Duncan's character on The Hogan Family, which was Valerie before Valerie Harper quit.\n\nNeil Morrissey as Tony Smart from series 2 of Men Behaving Badly, replacing Harry Enfield as Dermot Povey. Since this happened on ITV, and the show only became popular after the third series was taken up by The BBC, most viewers have only the vaguest idea there ever was a Dermot Povey. (In one Clip Show, a single scene from series 1 is shown, prompting Tony to ask \"Who was that?\")\n\nThat '70s Show replaced Eric and Kelso with Randy, who had similar personality traits of both other characters.\n\nYet instead of getting an empty-headed loser, which were the funniest parts about Eric and Kelso, we ended up with a smart pretty-boy, which is ultimately, a Gary Stu. This did not go unnoticed by the viewers.\n\nIn Blakes Seven, substitutes are always the same gender as the outgoing character, for no particular reason but to make up the numbers. Jenna is replaced by Dayna, Blake is replaced by Tarrant, and Cally is replaced by Soolin. Slightly subverted in the episode 'Rescue', though, where the tough guy and the female pilot are replaced by a male pilot and a tough chick, respectively.\n\nIn Frontline, each season features a new Executive Producer, all of whom are equally amoral but manipulate people in slightly different ways.\n\nIn Gilmore Girls, when Chad Michael Murray (Tristan DuGray) left for One Tree Hill. This left a void in the Rory/Dean/Other love/hate triangle. The void was soon filled by Jess Mariano (Milo Ventimiglia).\n\nAlthough Jess's character was VASTLY different from Tristan's, and the dynamics of the relationship between him and Rory were much more even.\n\nLogan Huntzberger, however, was basically just Tristan 2.0.\n\nNatalie in Monk replacing Sharona as Monk's assistant. The next few episodes were very obviously written for Sharona, with the only real difference in the characters being Natalie calling her boss \"Mr. Monk\" instead of \"Adrian.\" This gets especially weird when she states that she's never seen Monk's feet like that's a big deal, despite having only taken the job in the previous episode. The point at which the writers ran out of their previous scripts and were able to start creating material specifically for Natalie (mostly involving her dead husband at first) is very, very clear.\n\nDue to the death of Stanley Kamel (Dr. Kroger), Hector Elizondo has taken on the role of a new psychiatrist for Adrian Monk.\n\nGet Smart (the original show) did this for the episode \"Ice Station Siegfried.\" Don Adams had a root canal and couldn't be there for the shooting of one episode, so the writers created Agent Quigley, who acted exactly like Maxwell Smart and was also attracted to Agent 99, to replace him for one episode. He was never seen nor mentioned again. Incidentally, the script for \"Ice Station Siegfried\" was so bad that Adams purposely scheduled his dentist appointment so that he would miss the filming of it and not another Season 5 episode.\n\nDads Army introduced Private Cheeseman as a substitute after the sudden death of James Beck, who played Walker. The character fast became a Scrappy and was written out after only one season.\n\nAlthough not as obvious as some other examples, the producers of Buffy the Vampire Slayer wrestled with who they could get to replace Cordelia's snarky truth-telling character (who had left for Angel, where she'd undergo a whack of Character Development and change personalities anyway). At first, when getting wind of the popularity of Spike and deciding to keep him on, they'd thought to have him do it, but they later decided to use Anya, a previously one-episode appearance, to become a regular and take over Cordelia's role in the group.\n\nWhile we're at it, Spike, the Vampire-fighting-for-good, is curiously similar to Angel. Eventually even the slightly-different motivation, the behaviour-dampening hardware placed in his brain, is written out and he is given a soul just like his counterpart. And yeah, they both date Buffy.\n\nTheir personalities are not remotely similar, though.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer also inverted the trope with Kennedy, who was deliberately made very different from Willow's previous love interest Tara. Perhaps not the best idea, as Kennedy was pushy, arrogant, and abrasive where Tara was shy, gentle and empathetic. She was not received well.\n\nMeanwhile, in the spinoff Angel:\n\nThere's a textbook subversion in season 1, after Angel loses Doyle. He complains that his link to the Powers That Be is gone, only to be told that \"whenever a door closes, another opens.\" Enter a very Doyle-like character...who turns out, after a series of misdirections, to be the Monster of the Week, not the new sidekick. Cordelia gains Doyle's powers and role.\n\nDoyle himself was a Suspiciously Similar Substitute for Whistler, a character who appeared briefly in flashbacks in Buffy's second season finale and recruited Angel to the side of good. Both are sarcastic demons (half-demon, in Doyle's case) who work for the Powers That Be. Doyle was originally intended to be Whistler, but the actor was unavailable when the show was greenlit, so they reworked him as newcomer Doyle.\n\nCreator Joss Whedon admits that after Cordelia went insane, fell into a coma, and was absent in the show's final season, the writers felt that the show had lost an important puzzle piece. Enter Harmony. Dim-witted, blonde, and completely peculiar vampire who seems to carry the personality of Cordelia circa Season 1. They even went as far as adding her as a main character in the opening credits for the final six episodes.\n\nThough since Harmony had been there since the very first episode of Buffy (and being one of the Cordettes) her character was already known and accepted.\n\nFor Season Five, Eve served the part of Cordelia that was to play Angel's foil. Spike as in Buffy Season Four came on to give the much-needed sarcastic remarks. Illyria, later, became the one who provided conflict by always saying it like it is.\n\nEve also effectively replaced Lilah Morgan as the untrustworthy senior female at Wolfram & Hart, as she herself commented on in her first scene.\n\nIn Judging Amy, Dan Futterman played Vincent Gray, Amy's highly intelligent younger brother, in episodes 1 through 51, when he left the show. He was soon substituted by Kevin Rahm in the role of Kyle McCarty, Amy and Vincent's highly intelligent second cousin who had much of the same intelligence and mannerisms as Vincent. With Kyle's introduction, it was explained that Vincent and Kyle had been roommates and spent much of their younger years together. Vincent returned to the show in episode 100, and effectively reverse-substituted for Kyle who left the show in episode 118. Vincent remained for the rest of the show's run.\n\nJeffrey Coho from Boston Legal is an interesting example, in that he was the substitute for a character who was still on the show. Over the first two seasons, the main character Alan Shore transformed from being a rather-slimy-lawyer-with-a-deeply-buried-heart-of-gold type to a civil rights crusader. Jeffrey Coho was brought onto the show at the beginning of Season 3, and was pretty much identical in personality to Season 1 Alan, even down to his politics and his feuding with Brad Chase (except, mercifully, for the friendship with Denny Crane, which was only ever Alan's).\n\nBenson - Rene Auberjonois' Clayton Endicott III was pretty much a clone of his predecessor, Taylor (albeit with a more impressively pretentious name).\n\nHill Street Blues - When Michael Conrad died after Season 3, his Sgt. Esterhaus was replaced with Robert Prosky's Sgt. Jablonski (who was even given a similar catchphrase to close out the briefing at the top of each episode).\n\nAlice - Jolene, for Flo.\n\nJolene didn't actually replace Flo per se. When Polly Holiday left to star in the short-lived spinoff \"Flo,\" she was replaced by Diane Ladd (who played Flo in the movie), although on the TV show, she played an original character named \"Belle Dupree\", another sassy, sarcastic middle aged southern gal. Eventually Diane left, and SHE was replaced by Jolene.\n\nThe Streets of San Francisco - Dan Robbins, for Steve Keller.\n\nInverted, somewhat, on All in The Family: The character of George Jefferson was expressly written for Sherman Helmsley, who was unavailable at the time the show's early seasons were shot due to his appearance in a Broadway musical; the character of George's brother, Henry Jefferson, was devised as a placeholder until Helmsley became available in Season 4 (although George was \"on\" the show as an offscreen character in the earlier seasons).\n\nPhil in Corner Gas replacing Paul as the Cree with long hair and the four letter name that starts with P and ends with L who works as the head bartender. The only difference apart from name is that Phil looks older and has a deeper, less enthusiastic voice.\n\nWhen Mickey left Hustle after season 3, Billy was introduced as a Suspiciously Similar Substitute for Danny, with Danny taking up Mickey's role. In season 5, Mickey's back and the Danny/Billy role is taken by Sean, with his sister Emma as the new Stacie.\n\nUtterly averted in Kindred: The Embraced, a show loosely based on White Wolf's old Vampire: The Masquerade setting. The main character's actor died in a motorcycle accident shortly after the first season, but, rather than writing in a new lead, the show was cancelled.\n\nThis was because Mark Frankel's character Julian Luna had quickly taken over as star of the show after proving far more popular than the original lead—C. Thomas Howell's Frank Kohanek—who was intensely disliked by fans and critics alike. Frank was supposed to be written out in Season 2, and Julian made the lead. Without the fan favorite, the producers believed that the show was too weak to continue.\n\nTiffani Thiessen's Valerie Malone on Beverly Hills, 90210. Valerie was introduced after Shannen Doherty was fired from the show and was a brunette of similar temperament to Doherty's Brenda who lived in her room and slept with her ex-boyfriend. Her twist was that she was a pot-smoking 'naughty girl', as the characters in the show would constantly remind us.\n\nThis happened with Doherty again on Charmed . When Doherty left the show she was written out of the show and her character, Prue, was killed by a demon which left a rather big hole in the show's premise of having three sister witches prophesised to be the greatest force of good the world has ever had. Word of God says that they decided they needed another young, hot, brunette to fill the role of the third sister, so in steps Rose McGowan as Paige the unknown fourth Halliwell sister given up for adoption and happens to be Half-Whitelighter as a result of the sister's mother having an affair. (Bonus points for averting an Ass Pull in that the mother's affair with her Whitelighter was already established.) In-Universe the third sister needed to have the power of telekinesis as Prue had so Paige was given the power to teleport herself and other objects via her Whitelighter powers.\n\nAfter Howard Hesseman left Head of the Class in 1990, Billy Connolly's character substituted him for the show's final season.\n\nDiff'rent Strokes - After Edna Garrett's departure for her own spinoff (The Facts of Life), she was replaced as the Drummonds' housekeeper with Adelaide Brubaker...who was substituted, in turn, by Pearl Gallagher.\n\nMrs. Garrett was eventually substituted herself on The Facts Of Life by her sister, Beverly Ann Stickle.\n\nThe Love Boat replaced Julie McCoy with her sister Judy as \"Your Cruise Director,\" following actress Lauren Tewes' departure from the show due to cocaine addiction.\n\nSophie's cousin Barney in the fifth series of Peep Show is a fairly obvious replacement for her brother Jamie from series four; they look similar, are both musicians, both obsessed with Jeremy, and Barney even hangs around with Sophie's father for no explained reason.\n\nSeason three of M.I. High replaced Daisy, Blaine and their boss. A number of minor characters are also gone as well. In fact the only characters who have been carried over from the last season are Rose, The Grand Master and the school headmaster.\n\nKnight Rider replaced Wrench Wench Bonnie Barstow with April Curtis for the second season, then brought back Bonnie the next year.\n\nHappy Days, upon the leaving of Ron Howard, brought in a family friend named Roger who replaced the 'straight-man' tendencies of Richie.\n\nThere have been seven Iron Chefs: Chen Kenichi (Chinese), Hiroyuki Sakai (French), Masaharu Morimoto (Japanese), and Masahiko Kobe (Italian) are the ones American viewers are most familiar with. The dubbed version tried to push the idea that Morimoto was the direct successor to Rokusaburo Michiba, the original IC Japanese. In truth, Morimoto was a substitute to a substitute: Michiba's replacement was Koumei Nakamura (Who can be spotted behind Chairman Kaga in the opening credits, where Kaga is standing behind the pile of strawberries). There's also the original IC French, Yutaka Ishinabe (Who's portrait can be spotted in the opening panorama).\n\nSeason 7 of Twenty Four introduces Janis Gold, a frumpy bespectacled computer technician, who basically is the FBI's version of Chloe. They bring Chloe back for a few episodes, and they don't get along.\n\nThe character of Mandy is another example. If the producers couldn't get Mia Kirshner the actress who played her they created another sexy terrorist. Season 4's Nicole is a prime example, because she behaves in EXACTLY the same way as Mandy would, she has sex with a character to get him on side, then reveals her true colours. Mandy did more or less the same thing in the first episode\n\nLucy replaced Kate in Not Going Out.\n\nDr. Jesse Travis replaced Dr. Jack Stewart in season 3 of Diagnosis: Murder although he was a very different character and it's generally regarded as a change for the better.\n\nWhen the actor who played him died, The 50's sitcom version of Dennis the Menace US replaced George Wilson with a made up \"brother\" named John; there never was a John Wilson in the original comics.\n\nDexter had James Doakes replaced after his death in Season 2 with another detective named Joseph Quinn in Season 3. Possibly lampshaded if one considers a former Trope Namer...\n\nCSI replaced two characters in the ninth season, with Ray Langston, and Riley Adams, though they seem to be the latter type, each having their own character traits.\n\nDB Russell is said to be a more straight version of this, because he has some similarities to Grissom, though not so close that it screams \"Grissom Light\".\n\nBy comparison, CSI: NY replaced Aiden Burn with another occasionally-sarcastic female character, who was even suggested to be in a relationship with the same character, at least until she was Killed Off for Real. Her other traits were added to a previously-existing background character, who occasionally takes Don Flack's place.\n\nWhile the original ducklings still appear on House, their roles as, well, ducklings have been replaced. By Taub, Kutner and Thirteen, who are superficially similar to the original three characters. Their exact personalities don't line up but House admitted that he hired them based on the same dynamic he had with the earlier team. Interestingly enough for the trope, the previous actors didn't leave the show, they just added more cast members and reorganized the dynamic. For most of seasons 4 and 5 the new characters and Foreman were the team while Chase and Cameron went on to other departments in the hospital.\n\nCompletely averted, character wise. While the dynamic of \"Older Guy\", \"Younger Guy\", and \"Younger Girl\" still existed, the characters filling each slot were completely different. Thirteen, the character suffering most from accusations of the like was actually as completely different from her predecessor as was possible.\n\nKellie replacing Kate on The Drew Carey Show after Christa Miller left for a recurring role on Scrubs.\n\nNYPD Blue is the master of this trope, having replaced Andy Sipowicz's partner three times. Jimmy Smits replaced David Caruso when the latter decided he was too big to do the show. Rick Schroeder replaced Smits. Mark-Paul Gosselaar replaced Schroeder. Gosselaar and Schroeder are the best examples here, both having similar physical make-ups and similar character personalities.\n\nThe 2004 Battlestar Galactica replaced Billy Keikeya with Tory Foster. This is actually the only Battlestar example. Given the improvisational nature of the series' writing it's unclear if Billy would have followed a similar arc to Tory, had Paul Campbell remained on the show.\n\nWell, at the very least, he probably wouldn't have slept with Anders and Baltar.\n\nThis trope is played straight or averted, as the lack of similarity between the two characters is noted by Roslin and Adama in Tory's very first appearance.\n\nIn The George Lopez Show, Carmen is replaced with Angie's niece Veronica Palmero because of creative differences between Carmen's actress, Masiela Lusha, and George Lopez. Veronica is pretty much the same as Carmen, only more shallow and with a sadder story.\n\nIn Scrubs, the character of Laverne was killed off, due to the writers being under the impression the 6th season would be the last. It wasn't. Cue Nurse Shirley, who is played by the same actress that played Laverne! This is lampshaded when JD nicknames her \"Laverneagain.\" The hospital's fake website uses the exact same picture for both nurses' profiles.\n\nIt's actually a subversion, since what little personality the writers had a chance to give to her dialogue, and a good deal of the acting Aloma Wright did, was meant to create the impression of an anti-Laverne.\n\nLaverne and Shirley?\n\nFor the last season, the main character is basically JD and Elliot combined (narrator, daydreaming delusions, blonde, crazy, bullied by Dr. Cox...) and Denise is also given some more obvious JD traits after he leaves.\n\nAccording to some, Kochanski was this for Rimmer on Red Dwarf. Others thought Kochanski replaced Kryten, while the latter became Rimmer's replacement.\n\nAlso inverted - Rimmer is killed off in the first episode and replaced by a hologram, portrayed by the same actor. Hologram Rimmer was written out of the story in Series VII after Chris Barrie chose to leave the show. He returned in Series VIII to play the revived original Rimmer.\n\nAfter the death of Bea Benederet, the mother and hotel manager from Petticoat Junction, June Lockhart was cast as a new town doctor who took up residence in the hotel. Although she was clearly not the girls' mother, and the girls were all well into adulthood by that point, she carried on Benederet's function as motherly advisor, and the town's most sensible resident.\n\nAfter the first season of |Mission Impossible, team leader Dan Briggs was replaced by Jim Phelps. After the third season, Rollin Hand was replaced by \"The Great Paris.\" Replacements were pretty much seamless, since the characters were constantly playing roles within the show, and were purposely written to show a minimum of personality outside their jobs.\n\nJim was actually rather different in personality from Dan, a more friendly and avuncular sort whereas Dan was a hardass with a ruthless streak. Also, Dan sometimes supervised the missions remotely rather than joining them, whereas Jim was always part of the mission team. Jim was also more suited for romantic roles than Dan. However, Paris was an exact replacement for Rollin, with the exact same skill set (disguise, magic, cheating at cards, pickpocketing). In his first season (year 4), he was basically Rollin by another name, but in season 5, when the show got more character-driven for a time, he developed a distinct, more casual and \"hip\" personality.\n\nIn addition, The Chick in the Five-Man Band started out as Cinnamon, who was replaced by a parade of guest stars in Season 4, Dana in Season 5, and Casey in Seasons 6-7 (with Mimi briefly serving as a Temporary Substitute). Averted somewhat with Casey, who was not just the femme fatale but also replaced Rollin and Paris as the team's makeup master, since budget cuts required reducing the cast size. The show also attempted to replace Willy with a doctor named Doug, but Willy was Saved by the Fans.\n\nAverted, kind of, in Bones. At the start of season 3 we were given recurring character Sweets, a young, clever psychologist. He became a regular with his name added to the opening credits at the end of the season when Zack, the young, clever anthropologist, left the show. Averted in that the characters don't have much more in common and that Sweets is very well-liked. Also averted in that Zach's in-universe role (anthropology student in the lab) is now pointedly rotated between five different guest characters, because everyone agrees that Zach is irreplaceable anyway.\n\nSully could be seen as a variation of this trope. Booth had not left the series, but Agent Tim Sullivan was brought in as a replacement boyfriend for Brennan-but he was so much like Booth that the fans dubbed him \"Booth Light\".\n\nSeen repeatedly in Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict, due to the show's unusually high cast turnover rate. In fact, the only character to last through all 5 seasons was series villain Agent Sandoval.\n\nGene Roddenberry's Andromeda. The character of Tyr, a Nietzschean who could not be trusted was replaced by Rhade, a Nietzchean who could not be trusted. Tyr went on to become a complete wuss when the actor guest-starred in later episodes.\n\nThe character of Doyle in the final season is also somewhat of a replacement for Lexa Doig's Andromeda when her role needed to be reduced due to the actress's pregnancy. Doyle provided a love target and protector for Harper, among other regular Rommie duties.\n\nDoig similarly played a replacement doctor in Stargate SG-1, though her character was less-developed than the one she replaced, Dr. Frasier, and the replacement was not immediate.\n\nDoig's husband is also Michael Shanks, whose Daniel was SG-1's original character substituted for with Jonas Quinn.\n\nLexx couldn't get the actress who played Wist back, so they created a second gorgeous blonde predator with a childlike demeanor in Lyekka.\n\nThe Tick (animation) suffered from a number of poor copies meant to be substitutes when Fox failed to get the rights for any characters besides The Tick and Arthur. But given that it was Fox, no one was really surprised as the show's days were numbered from day one.\n\nThough, to give credit where credit is due, Bat Manuel is one of the funniest television characters ever.\n\nEven better the actor who played Bat Manuel in the live action version of The Tick played the Mayor in the Batman movie The Dark Knight Saga.\n\nArden replaced Chelsea as the Alpha Bitch for seasons two and three of Naturally, Sadie.\n\nAshley's ultimate demise in Sanctuary was particularly predictable because in the two episodes preceding it, they were already gearing up her replacement.\n\nIn M.I. High, the third series replaced Lenny Bicknall with Frank London, both retired superspies posing as a high school caretaker.\n\nIn The Thick of It series three has a new Minister For Social Affairs - Nicola Murray replacing Hugh Abbot. Her only points of difference with her predecessor are that she's a woman, and that she's not best friends with her main ministerial advisor. This is entirely justified, as the premise of the show is that all politicians are the same.\n\nOn Leverage, Gina Bellman's pregnancy required a hasty write-off of Sophie before she started showing, so she was replaced for half a season by Tara Cole (played by Jeri Ryan).\n\nCarried out with style by British fantasy show Hex, where new girl Ella, an experienced witch, shows up at the start of the second season and by the end of the second episode has stabbed original lead witch Cassie and taken her place as the show's main character. She goes on the have an almost identical doomed relationship with demon spawn Malachi that Cassie had with demon Azazeal in the first season. To round things off, Malachi is Cassie and Azazeal's magically-aged son.\n\nDrop the Dead Donkey replaced Alex, the one sensible person in the Globelink office, with Helen, a virtually identical character, at the end of the second series. Both of them even had one-night stands with Dave (despite Helen being a lesbian).\n\nAverted in, of all things, Mutant X, which saw Lexa replace Emma at the start of the final season after Emma's death in the previous finale. Counts as an aversion because, rather than the new character being designed to fill the superpowered gap in the team the old one had left, telempathic Emma was replaced with light-manipulating Lexa, whose personality, loyalties, and storyline were radically different to Emma's.\n\nOn The Cosby Show, when Rudy got too old to be the Cute Little Kid, a step-granddaughter was written into the cast to be fill the role. Unlike other examples, Rudy stayed.\n\nTo quote Wyatt Cenacc on The Daily Show: \"WHY WOULD YOU THROW RUDY UNDER THE BUS?! SHE'S STILL THE SAME RUDY!!\"\n\nReally head-spinning example from THE PAPER CHASE: When the study group is formed during the pilot episode, one woman is included. In the very second episode, that character's place in the study group, with no explanation, has been taken by another woman, Logan, who remains a major character throughout the series.\n\nOn MythBusters, Kari Byron went on maternity leave, and was replaced by Jessi Combs for a few months. The original Build Team was Kari, Tori, and Scotty (Wrench Wench) who left the show under \"personal reasons\" and was replaced by the now better known Grant. And there is also Christine, a \"Mythtern\" before the Build Team came into play, who directly assisted Jamie and Adam and had a certain resemblance to Scotty.\n\nEmily Prentiss and David Rossi were replacements for Elle Greenaway and Jason Gideon respectively. Both characters were initially hated by many fans, but gained pretty good fanbases the longer they remained on the show.\n\nThe trope is played straight with Prentiss, but not Rossi. Word of God from creator Ed Bernero on the \"About Face\" commentary says they wanted to make him as least like Gideon as possible, so they made him an egotistical wannabe rock star of a profiler who doesn't really \"do\" teams, and the first thing he does is shoot a bird.\n\nTo clarify: Jason Gideon was part ornithologist and part birdwatcher. Many times throughout Mandy Patinkin's run you would hear and see references to his characters' love for birds. A Take That indeed!\n\nAnd now, since JJ's departure, there will be another new character joining the team—meet Ashley Seaver , FBI cadet and based on previews, the daughter of a serial killer. Yes, she does look like JJ superficially, but whether is she a good, distinct, well-drawn out character in her own right (despite the physical similarities) or a Scrappy Mary Sue copycat replacement will be determined soon when her first episode airs.\n\nSubverted by the fact that the majority of the fanbase disliked Seaver prompting the return of JJ (and Prentiss who left at the end of last season).\n\nA few from Neighbours, though the straightest examples may be Tom Ramsay replacing his brother Max, and Oliver Barnes being hastily written in to replace his brother Will/Sebastian, even taking over his whole character arc.\n\nOn the final season of Waiting for God, Jane's Scottish grandfather, Jamie, came in, after the actor playing Basil died.\n\nBesides The Other Darrin, Roger Davis, Alias Smith and Jones replaced the character Clementine \"Clem\" Hale with Georgette \"George\" Sinclair. Probably a case of the writers recycling scripts already written for the other character.\n\nThe German soap opera Alles Was Zahlt originally dealt with Diana Sommer, who was a plucky blonde delivery girl turned up-and-coming figure skater. In the first episode Diana was sort of hit by a car... which led to the Meet Cute introduction to her boyfriend Julian. After Julian died and the actress playing Diana decided to leave the show, a new character was introduced: the plucky blonde circus performer turn up-and-coming figure skater, Stella. Upon arriving in town her car broke down, which meant she almost got rear-ended by her immediate love interest, Lars. It wouldn't be so bad if Stella and Lars were bearable, but unfortunately, they're not.\n\nMrs. Greenlaw for Mrs. Hall on All Creatures Great and Small.\n\nCarla Borrego for Maddie Magellan in Jonathan Creek.\n\nAgent Shaw on Chuck seems pretty similar to Bryce from Seasons 1 and 2. They're both romantic rivals to the lead character, they both mentor him on how to be a spy, and they both are super spies.\n\nWhen Nickelodeon's variety show All That began, Katrina Johnson was easily the youngest-looking cast member and was mostly used to play a variety of little girl characters. In Season 3, with Katrina looking too old to pull off these roles, Amanda Bynes was added to the cast to fill the void. Katrina left the show entirely later in that season.\n\nDesigning Women: Charlene was replaced by her sister Carlene, who was about as similar as you can get.\n\nOddly played on Saved by the Bell. After losing Jesse and Kelly the producers introduced biker chick Tori who picked up Kelly's role as Zach's love interest. That still left a gap though, so rather than introduce new characters they transferred Jesse's brains and Kelly's popularity to Lisa who overnight leapt from average intelligence and popularity to straight A-student and homecoming queen.\n\nMore so on Saved By The Bell: The New Class, most blatantly in their first season. The new youngsters were virtual carbon copies of their old-class counterparts: Scott for Zack (even breaking the Fourth Wall in the same way), Weasel for Screech, Tommy D for Slater, Linday for Kelly, and Megan for Lisa and Jessie (due to her being Weasel's unrequited crush, as well as the smart one in the group).\n\nWhite Collar introduced FBI agent Diana Barrigan in the pilot, but when the actress had other commitments, she was replaced without explanation by the character Lauren Cruz. (Who was subsequently re-replaced without explanation by Barrigan in season 2).\n\nDiana took a job in Washington, DC because it's where her girlfriend was from, and decided to come back to New York. Lauren left with no explanation.\n\nCharlies Angels. At the end of Season 1 Farrah Fawcett left the series and her character, Jill Munroe was replaced by her kid sister Kris. The show's ratings soared after that.\n\nSubverted in NCIS: Los Angeles. Originally the team was to be headed by agent Lara Macy, played by Louise Lombard, but after apparently she didn't test well with audiences in the pilot, she was replaced by Hetty Lange, played by Linda Hunt. They are nothing alike.\n\nIn Midsomer Murders, DCI Barnaby was replaced by... DCI Barnaby (his cousin, who had the same rank and personality, but was played by a different actor). Also, he had already changed his sidekick twice.\n\nIn the second season of In Treatment Luke and Bess, a couple whose divorce was harming their son, were clearly substitutes for Jake and Amy in the first season. This is because, in the Israeli series the show is based on, the corresponding couple's arc continued into the second season.\n\nIn the Retool of Square One TV, Kate Monday was replaced by Pat Tuesday on the Show Within a Show Mathnet.\n\nThe Season 2-4 recasting of 3-2-1 Contact: Miguel=Marc, Robin=Trini, Kathy=Lisa.\n\nPlayed with on Tremors: The Series when Michael Gross was unavailable for shooting. The female scientist who appeared in the episode was given a personality Suspiciously Similar to Gross's Burt Gummer, a similarity which was Lampshaded by the other characters, although she didn't perform his usual in-universe functions of shooting or blowing up monsters.\n\nSabrina the Teenage Witch had Dreama replace Valerie and Brad replace Libby in season 4.\n\nValerie herself replaced Jenny in season 2.\n\nAnnie replaced Fi as the protagonist in the final season of So Weird. Like Fi, Annie had paranormal encounters which she posted on a website. The \"twist\" was that she was a singer.\n\nAverted and played straight by The Red Green Show. The marina owner changed from the reasonably-built but lazy Glen Brachston to the overweight and even lazier Dwight Cardiff. However, they averted this with the role of animal control officer: the original one, Garth Harble, loved animals, while replacement Ed Frid was terrified of them.\n\nOn Home Improvement, Heidi replaced Lisa as the Tool Girl on the Show Within a Show Tool Time in season three. Lisa was a Flat Character and Heidi started out as one but she eventually had some Character Development.\n\nPrimeval had Sarah Page, who was killed because her actress couldn't continue acting for the show, and was replaced by Jess Parker. However, their roles are very different; Sarah was an expert in mythology and ancient cultures, while Jess is a techie and team coordinator.\n\nSarah in turn replaced Jenny Lewis, who was an alternate-timeline duplicate of Claudia Brown, played by the same actress but with a completely different personality and role, an inversion of the typical Suspiciously Similar Substitute.\n\nThe series has also been through three different leading men and two different tough-guy supporting men. Only three cast members have stayed with the show through its entire run.\n\nThe leading men are a particularly interesting example of this. With the first switch the authors went for a genuine attempt to not make the substitute suspiciously similar, and in fact the character changed the entire tone of the series. When this second leader was in turn switched out they brought in a replacement that was suspiciously similar to leading man number one, up to and including his accent. The tone of the series also switched back, becomming particularly obvious when number two reappeared for one more episode.\n\nEllen DeGeneres seemed to be this when she replaced Paula Abdul on American Idol except with zero knowledge of the music industry. She even managed to be less useful than The Scrappy Kara DioGuardi.\n\nReviews of The X Factor's new judges Kelly Rowland, Tulisa, and Gary Barlow recall up their respective predecessors, Dannii Minogue, Cheryl Cole, and Simon Cowell. Some reviewers even noted that Tulisa even physically resembled Cheryl in terms of looks and personality.\n\nUpstairs, Downstairs replaced Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard and Lady Marjorie Bellamy, with Georgina, the daughter of a couple killed in the Titanic disaster alongside Lady Marjorie. The changeover wasn't immediate, and demure, idealistic Elizabeth had a very different character to the louche Georgina, but Georgina filled the same role, so it may count. Lady Marjorie's role went through two changes as well, with Hazel and then Virginia Bellamy taking over the position of mistress of the house. Downstairs, after Emily's suicide, the show also went through a handful of identikit kitchenmaids before settling on the hapless Ruby.\n\nOn Fox's New Girl, the character of \"Coach\" (Damon Wayans, Jr.) appears only in the pilot. By the time the second episode rolls around, we instead have \"Bishop,\" (Lamorne Morris) another young, handsome, goateed, athletic African-American roommate. The switch is given something of a Hand Wave, with the explanation that Bishop is the \"real\" roommate, and that Coach was just subletting while Bishop was off playing pro basketball in a Latvian league. The actual reason for the switch is that Wayans shot the pilot while his ABC show Happy Endings was on the cancellation bubble, and between the pilot being shot and the show being picked up as a full series, ABC decided to renew Happy Endings...Which did the same for Wayans' contract.\n\nLeonard Rossiter's final role on UK television was as a supermarket manager in the dreadful sitcom Tripper's Day. After his death, he was replaced by Bruce Forsyth and the show was renamed Slinger's Day. This was even worse than the original but was somehow renewed for a second (six-episode) season and even crossed the Atlantic to become Check It Out.\n\nAverted in Twin Peaks, when Kyle Mac Lachlan talked the producers out of turning teenage sexpot Audrey Horne into the love interest for his character, Agent Dale Cooper. Instead, they introduced Heather Graham as Annie ... a formerly suicidal former nun. Definitely not a teenage sexpot.\n\nAmy Amanda Allen was put on a bus and replaced for ten episodes by Tawnia Baker on The A-Team.\n\nOne episode of El Chavo del Ocho featured Don Ramon's cousin Don Roman. Roman practically did and suffered like his cousin did in a similar episode.\n\nMitchell, a reformed vampire with a troubled past who's sworn off blood and lives alongside a werewolf and a ghost, was killed off at the end of Series 3 of Being Human (UK). Series 4 replaces him with Hal... a reformed vampire with a troubled past who's sworn off blood and lives alongside a werewolf and a ghost.\n\nAt the same time, George, the resident werewolf, also left. His role in the house was replaced by another werewolf who had almost nothing in common with George. The reason? Tom, his replacement, had been an on-and-off recurring character since the first series. Zero new characterization was required.\n\nPut-upon straight man, oftentimes Only Sane Employee, and Leslie's original love interest Mark Brendanawicz leaves Parks and Recreation at the end of Season 2, the same time put-upon straight man, Only Sane Employee, and Leslie's love interest Ben Wyatt joins the cast.\n\nIn Misfits when Nathan left, due to actor Michael Sheehan not wanting to continue to Series 3, he is replaced by Rudy, and equally mouthy character who like Nathan has the habit of saying outrageous things for shock value (or perhaps because he just doesn't think before he speaks). Subverted slightly in that Rudy has a literal dual personality; he splits into two different Rudys. The 'other' Rudy is more tactful and caring.\n\nBedlam replaces Jed, a man who sees ghosts and works to put them at rest and investigating the house's mysteries, with Ellie, a girl who can see ghosts, investigating"
