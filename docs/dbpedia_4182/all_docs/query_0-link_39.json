The obituaries of over 1300 people are included in the current book, along with pictures of the vast majority. The years losses ran the gamut from the Godfather of Soul James Brown to the Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, and from legendary film director Robert Altman to the former President of the United States, Gerald Ford. Other notables include Mike Hammer’s creator Mickey Spillane, Charlie’s Angels producer Aaron Spelling, Jaws writer Peter Benchley, 60 Minutes broadcast journalist Ed Bradley, legendary animator Joe Barbera, and Dark Shadows creator Dan Curtis.

This book provides a single source that notes the deaths of all major, and many minor, figures in the fields of film, television, cartoons, theatre, music and popular literature. The obituaries within this volume contain pertinent details of deaths including date, place and cause, of 1345 celebrities. Biographical information and career highlights and achievements are also provided. I have also included a complete-as-possible filmography for film and television performers. I have discontinued the practice of including citations with individual entries, as more often than not I have utilized on-line sources for much of the information. Both print and on-line resources used are listed below and in the bibliography. A photograph has been included for many of the individuals. I have been writing obituaries of film personalities for nearly thirty years, beginning with a column in Forry Ackerman’s Famous Monsters of Filmland in the late 1970s. Many of the film obituaries in the work are taken from my monthly column in Classic Images (P.O. Box 809, Muscatine, IA 52761), a newspaper devoted to classic films and their performers. Information on the passing of the individuals found in this volume has been gathered from a myriad of sources. Primary sources, as previously noted are listed in the individual bibliographies, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Times (of London), The Washington Post, Variety, Time, People, TV Guide and Newsweek. Other sources include Boyd Mager’s Western Clippings, The Memphis Commercial Appeal, The Hollywood Reporter, The (Manchester) Guardian, The Comics Buyer’s Guide, Locus, Pro\n\nxi Wrestling Torch, Psychotronic Video, The Comics Journal and Facts on File. Several sources on the internet have also been helpful, including Celebrity Obits (http://www/voy.com/60649/ ), Life in Legacy (formerlly Famous Deaths — Week in\n\n2006 • Obituaries Review) (http://www.lifeinlegacy.com/ ), Entertainment Insiders (http://www.einsiders.com/ features/columns/2006obituaries), and the Internet Movie Database, Ltd.

Altman helped script the 1948 detective film The Bodyguard before heading to Hollywood in the mid–1950s. He directed the 1957 film The James Dean Story, but primarily worked in television, helming episodes of such series as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Peter Gunn, Bronco, Troubleshooters, Whirlybirds, Hawaiian Eye, The Millionaire, Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, U.S. Marshal, Sugarfoot, The Gale Storm Show, Maverick, Lawman, Surfside 6, The Roaring 20’s, Bonanza, Route 66, Bus Stop, Kraft Mystery Theater, The Gallant Men, Combat!, Kraft Suspense Theatre, The Long, Hot Summer, and Premiere.

Altman earned an Academy Award nomination for directing the 1970 film adaptation of M*A*S*H, an off-beat comedy about a military field hospital during the Korean War that audiences related to the then on-going Vietnam War. He followed this success with the ambitious failure, Brewster McCloud (1970). Altman then directed the 1971 deconstructionist western, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, staring Warren Beatty and Julie Christie. He continued making such films as the psychological drama Images (1972), the non-traditional adaptation of Raymond Chandler’s detective thriller The Long Goodbye (1973), Thieves Like Us (1974) and California Split (1974). Critics considered his 1975 film Nashville to be his masterpiece, interweaving the lives of two dozen characters during a presidential primary with a country music setting as its backdrop. His career stalled in the aftermath with the ill-fated 1976 western Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull’s History Lesson, staring Paul Newman. His subsequent films, Three Women (1971) with Sissy Spacek, and Quintet (1979) a futuristic thriller staring Paul Newman, were both critical and financial failures.

They included A Wedding (1978), A Perfect Couple (1979), HealtH (1980), Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean Jimmy Dean (1982), Streamers (1983), Secret Honor (1984), Fool for Love (1985), Beyond Therapy (1987), O.C. and Stiggs (1987), Aria (1987), and Vincent and Theo (1990).

His adaptation of Micheal Tolkin’s satirical novel The Player (1992), and his version of Raymond Carver’s short stories, Short Cuts (1993) both earned him Oscar nominations. Altman again hit a slump in his career with the films Pret-a-Porter (aka Ready to Wear) (1994), Jazz ’34 (1996), Kansas City (1996), The Gingerbread Man (1998), Cookie’s Fortune (1999), and Dr. T and the Women (2000), and the 1997 television series Gun.
