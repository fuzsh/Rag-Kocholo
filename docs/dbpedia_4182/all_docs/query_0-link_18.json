        "text": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer \"Welcome To The Hellmouth\"\n\nSo, in the wake of the revelations of Joss Whedon's jerkish behavior on the set of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, that sort of led me to decide to rewatch the series (and Angel) on Hulu and see if knowing what I know now colors how I view the show.\n\nAs far as the first episode ever goes, I didn't notice too many red flags (although Jessie asking Cordelia if she wants a shoulder to cry on, or to better yet, nibble on, is super gross) but it's very clear to me my previously low opinion of the first season was justified. There are a couple of interesting and refreshing choices in the storytelling (including making Darla at the beginning the Vampire in the opening late night at the empty school horror scenario) but frankly a LOT of this makes me cringe. Joss Whedon has been celebrated his entire career for his sharp dialogue. Is this truly the same guy who wrote Cordelia's painful \"Coolness test\" or Buffy's first ever entirely cliched and unfunny banter with Darla and Thomas in the tomb? I always thought these aspects of the episode were lame, but I always gave Whedon a free pass for them because stuff got better later on. But there's really no excuse for the show to be this badly written at this stage of the game.\n\nThere is some moody and atmospheric lighting during some of the horror scenes, and yet the direction for most of the episode is quite pedestrian. A lot of the boarding and directing in the high school is the exact same kind of stuff you could see on 90210. And I don't mean that as a compliment. The Avant Garde stuff the show later became famous for was not present at the beginning.\n\nI also have to say, the score absolutely sucks. Walter Murphy has composed some good things for Family Guy later on, but his work on Buffy is entirely unremarkable. Buffy always had one of the most memorable scores to me out of any TV show I watched. And Murphy's stuff is not only forgettable, but it sounds a little tinny too. Generally speaking, the show's later composer Christophe Beck was not afforded an orchestra either. But the music was elaborate enough that you either couldn't really tell, or you didn't mind when you could.\n\nIt's interesting that David Boreanaz initially affected his performance as Angel with a sort of droopy-eyed demeanor and a somewhat slow, slurry, and croaky voice. It's an interesting choice right off the bat, but simply not sustainable. Boreanaz was new to acting when he got the part (he was a dog-walker before he was cast as Angel) but I think he quickly learned a quirky performance is not something to saddle your character with forever if you don't have the chops for it at that stage in your career.\n\nIt is not credible that there is a dead body found in a school locker, and the worst thing that happens is that gym is canceled.\n\nFun Fact: The Cthultu Mythos, longtime considered a major influence on the franchise, is present in the very first episode, and further delved into at the beginning of the next. What else are the Old Ones a reference to? While the writing on the show may not always have been sound, it appears the bones of the long-term mythology was. This is all stuff that eventually played out with Illyria on Angel: Season Five 8 years later. That's a pretty impressive level of groundwork being laid in the first episode ever.\n\nI smiled at watching the theme song again for the first time in years. That is a great tune and main title. And the first and second season's versions are spooky and horror movie atmospheric, rather than the rockin' action movie homages the later main titles became.\n\nUltimately, however the first episode was a bore, and Cordelia's casual cruelty seems even worse than when this aired. Not a great start. *1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"The Harvest\"\n\nOh, yeah, bad warning signs aplenty here. Sheesh.\n\nLet me start off by saying the episode sucked, and the last scene is not actually iconic as fans of the series think it is. It's lame. Maybe it wasn't in 1997. But it is now.\n\nBuffy calling herself \"mentally challenged\" is the casual cruelty of Joss Whedon in a nutshell.\n\nSpeaking of which, the scene where Cordelia tells Willow that she doesn't interfere in her private conversations because she's boring was remarked in the DVD commentary by Whedon as something he snarkily said to a female classmate in high school, and found out later he really unintentionally hurt her feelings. That notion and this scene feel a lot less understandable knowing Whedon was still making those kinds of snide comments the entire time on the series and didn't understand he wasn't loved for it.\n\nI liked the scene transition from the sewer sliding vertically into the library card catalogue. It's a VERY early example of the show using an \"interesting shot\" which it got better at later on.\n\nIt's not credible that people are making excuses for the vampires not being vampires at the end. The series is asking us to believe they are offering a harsh critique of the denialism present in society. No. That's not what it is. The people in Sunnydale always make excuses because if they didn't, that would change the entire premise of the show. And while I do appreciate that would make it worse (especially after only episode 2) I don't appreciate being sold the idea that the show is doing a cynical observation of people. Observations actually have to be true. It's simply a thin excuse for the Total Reset Button being rehit at the end of every episode. And it isn't remotely believable.\n\nSimilarly not credible is the \"deliver\" scene. Are you telling me the teacher never told the students what the delete key does? That joke seems to have been written by an adult who believes the younger generation is a lot more computer illiterate than they are. It's not a commentary on Cordelia being stupid at all. It's something that a student in 1997 would already know in order to function in a computer class. It's sloppy writing in the name of a very cheap joke.\n\nBack in the day, I appreciated the allegory the show was making of Buffy's mom not actually understanding that her being grounded IS actually the end of the world. She says Buffy only believes that because she's a 16 year old girl. In the years since I watched the series I learned about a political rationalization called a \"false equivalency\". It's not actually a good allegory in hindsight after all. It's actually bothsidesing the apocalypse. It's not something I tolerate anymore. I don't put up with it from The New York Times, and I won't put up with it from Buffy The Vampire Slayer either.\n\nGarlic can briefly be seen in Buffy's weapons chest. Very, VERY rarely seen in the franchise, and it only made a single other appearance in either Buffy or Angel past the Pilot.\n\nMy favorite scene in the episode holds up years later, and frankly I'm a bit shocked more people aren't impressed with it. Xander says a fairly stupid and cliched line: \"Oh, we've gotta stop Jessie from doing something even stupider than usual.\" And Giles gets fiercely angry at him for that, and insists with both fury and sympathy that Jessie is dead, and they are dealing with the thing that killed him. I like that moment. It's a serious reminder of the stakes, after Xander says a thing that would be not particularly controversial for another character to say in a different franchise. Instead he get reamed for it, which I like.\n\nFinally, the thing I want to talk about this episode is something that is actually kind of minor in the episode itself, but it's the first symptom of a larger pattern of bad messages. Ironically, this was not a problem that affected Firefly at all, so I'm not sure why only The Buffyverse was afflicted. But Joss Whedon has been getting a lot of flack for his feminist insensitivities for the past few years. After MeToo, that was inevitable. But until Ray Fisher, I don't think people have ever given him the proper level of shade he deserves for his racial insensitivities.\n\nWe'll be talking a LOT more about this as we get into reviewing Angel, but in the second episode of Buffy ever, the tough, muscled, black bouncer is turned into a quivering coward and killed. Basically, Joss took the one black person who has appeared on the series so far, and completely emasculated and killed him off for shock value. I believe that every death you show in fiction makes a statement. The statement of the first black man on Buffy The Vampire Slayer being killed in such a humiliating fashion shows that Ray Fisher was probably onto something.\n\nAs I said in the first review not off to a flying start. *.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"The Witch\"\n\nIt's been years since I've seen this, and the first thing that jumped out at me is that as far as mysteries go, it is beyond poorly constructed. The supposed clues are all misleading, and don't actually make sense to what is going on. The selling point of a red herring is that a red herring is a plausible culprit. What this episode does instead with \"Amy's\" various confused and innocent seeming reactions to horrible things she's deliberately caused is make it completely outside of what the mystery is. Is it possible Catherine is merely acting surprised to dupe Buffy and friends? Conceivable. But if this is a mystery, that is something that needs to be spelled out explicitly to the viewer in hindsight. As it stands, it's simply an unfair mystery.\n\nThe reason I so readily identified it as such is because the Buffyverse has its share of unfair or unjustified plot twists, and I've sort of been on the look-out for them. This is definitely the first example, although it's not as egregious as some upcoming ones (I'm specifically thinking of the \"bogus\" prophecy arc in Angel: Season Three).\n\nWhat else? I like Buffy asking Giles how he planned to stop her being a cheerleader. I was annoyed at Giles' behavior for many reasons. His \"I forbid it,\" suggests he believes he holds more power over Buffy than he does. Who can he contact in the school to object to this? The principle? Her Mom? Won't they be questioning why a school librarian is raising the objections he is? And frankly Buffy saying she wanted something normal in her life is something Giles would want for her in later seasons. I'm not suggesting Giles grew as a character. I'm suggesting he's being written out of character here. Why? For pretty much the single most vulgar reason you can write a character out of character: to create artificial conflict where none should actually exist. To be blunt, this era of television was rank with that, and I can't indict Buffy The Vampire Slayer for it without slamming every single other show I watched and loved at the time. But it's a failing in hindsight, and it's one I no longer tolerate.\n\nAs I was watching Cordelia's driver's ed scene, I noticed something for the first time. The direction on the show this season is entirely dated. I'm not saying the Buffyverse is a timeless franchise. Many of the references and fashions put it in a very noticeable place in time. But as far as filmmaking goes, as much as I could (and will) criticize some of the scripts, the direction became relatively cinematic and modern, and it stayed that way. That sequence and the rest of the episode could have been made on an unmemorable low budget TV drama from the 1980's. Whatever else the Buffyverse felt like, it felt fresh at the time. I was underwhelmed with this era of the show back then. And that's probably because it's filmed like every other boring piece of television I didn't care about.\n\nI think as far as creepy, nice guys go, Xander Harris was essentially Patient Zero for that gross phenomena. I found his \"You're like a guy\" thing to Willow appalling for that reason. Which is why I smiled when Buffy drunkenly told him he was like one of the girls. I think Xander's behavior towards Buffy is creepy. I liked that moment because he actually had to pay for it a little.\n\nBuffy's mom Joyce is annoying at this stage of the game, but she's real. The movie version of Buffy's mom is a cartoon caricature of the most clueless and absent mother ever. I like that as annoyed as Joyce's foolishness makes me, she does actually care about Buffy. Although the real thing that tells me that she's not paying attention to her is that Buffy tells her there was an accident during the cheerleading tryouts and she doesn't look up and say, \"My God, what happened? Are you okay?\" I actually think it's out of character and bad writing that she doesn't do that, but television wasn't TOO concerned with making parents on teen-themed shows entirely realistic or sympathetic to viewers. And that's another failing.\n\nI will say something nice. Anything I really objected to was due to it being a weak episode. Not due to the producers failing women and minorities. It's just not a strong script. Which is frankly nice. Because I am predisposed to like the show. If I don't have any ideological problems with it, I'm inclined to just sit back and enjoy a crappy episode. Now maybe this episode was slightly TOO crappy to actually enjoy. But I suspect better episodes coming up with nothing infuriating in them will be very enjoyable to watch. **.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Teacher's Pet\"\n\nI'm with Buffy and Giles. I liked Dr. Gregory too. Although it's weird he has his name embroidered on his labcoat.\n\nThe look on Sarah Michelle Gellar's face as she was listening to Cordelia's counseling session was priceless.\n\nPrinciple Flutie remains one of the most inconsistently written characters in the franchise's history.\n\nThis episode starts the trend from this era of the show of making the last scene or shot a cliffhanger that is never followed up on.\n\nIt's a bit noticeable that in the establishing shots of Sunnydale High, the same people walk in front of it (in the same clothes) each time.\n\nThe She-Mantis puppet is fake-looking, but here's an unusual opinion: That kind of thing doesn't actually matter. None of Buffy's non-human creatures have ever been remotely credible during its entire run, and that never stopped my enjoyment of the show, even knowing and being able to tell they were totally fake. Realism in science fiction and fantasy is a vastly overrated commodity. If the writing is actually good, the visual effects don't matter. It's a pity current stuff takes the opposite stance.\n\nOnly so-so as far as it goes, but that pretty much describes Season 1 in general. **1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Never Kill A Boy On The First Date\"\n\nThe Anointed One reveal at the end was pretty great.\n\nI still use the phrase \"Okay, at this point you are abusing sarcasm,\" in my everyday life.\n\nI'm not saying Whedon was eyeing Cordelia for Angel in a spin-off at this point in the game, but \"Hello, Salty Goodness\" is still somewhat ironic in hindsight.\n\nXander's creepiness has gotten a fair amount of backlash in hindsight (he's particularly bad in this episode) but I wonder why Cordelia doesn't get the same shade for exhibiting the exact same predatory behavior here. Probably because the gender power dynamics are reversed, but I rarely have seen Cordelia grosser and more unlikable than this episode.\n\nSpeaking of Xander, that bit with the Tweety Bird watch was hysterical. One of the funniest things on the series up to this point.\n\nAll right. **1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"The Pack\"\n\nTechnically, the scariest episode so far. But's it's also not aged well.\n\nThe rape implications are pretty nasty, but that's par for the course for the show, and simply the introduction to the producers using that as a threat against the female heroes by the male ones. It's systemic and gross, and it's really unfortunate.\n\nI want to address the Zookeeper's demise. Buffy threw him into the hyena pit. For all intents and purposes she killed him. Why is nobody making the federal case out of her doing that when they were all over Faith for doing the same thing to the Deputy Mayor in Season 3, except by accident? I have found that when it comes to television and the morality of its heroes, when it is and isn't appropriate to use lethal force is entirely arbitrary.\n\nI find Principle Flutie's death unfortunate not simply because he didn't deserve it. But it's clear he was only killed off because he didn't quite mesh with the dynamic of the rest of the show, and the writers were clearly frustrated by that. It's a valid storytelling choice, but whenever TV writers do it, it certainly is never fair to the actor for the character the writers couldn't crack. But the close-up of the smiling photo makes me feel especially bad in hindsight.\n\nThere are a couple of amusing things in the episode. Giles declaring Xander a 16 year old boy, and Buffy calling that him trying to Scully her was fun. It also delighted me to realize the lead bully Kyle was played by a youmg Eion Bailey, who played August on Once Upon A Time. I suspect if I like watching the franchise less this time than I do any of the others, I might be a bit surprised and delighted about who I now know used to be on the show in a bit role.\n\nMy biggest question is something I would have been asking the entire time if I were a better writer or a more observant viewer back in the day. We took this for granted during the Oz episodes but it really makes no sense. Why does the school library have a cage? I don't get that bit, and it's weird it's not something I've ever questioned before.\n\nFor the record, the Zookeeper was giving me skeevy feelings from the beginning of the episode. It's very weird that I seem to recall being surprised by the twist ending at the time. In reality, his behavior in the first scene would have been a red flag to the 45 year old me he was responsible all along. The painting already being on the floor would also not be something I would have missed if I had watch this for the first time today.\n\nI found the scene in the Bronze at the beginning of Buffy and Willow discussing Xander and Angel entirely insufferable. Whedon had obviously never heard of the Bechdel test. Almost all female on female scenes in this show so far have been about discussing love-lives. Not great.\n\nOne of the interesting things about the episode that I have not seen it complimented about (although most fans seem to agree it's a good episode in an otherwise bad season) is that it's very interesting that lot of the performances and cues being asked for the actors to get across to the audience are entirely nonverbal. The gym teacher's dumb joke about loving the brutality of the dodgeball game is besides the point, and probably only there to help any dummies in the audience who couldn't quite grasp how horrible that was supposed to be. But I like that a lot of what the characters are feeling is shown mostly through their expressions and non-verbal cues. That's unusual for television, especially for television from this era.\n\nBut yeah, the whole franchise is starting to feel a bit shaky in hindsight. If I'm noticing the dumbness of a cage in the library way back in episode 6, what other dumb stuff in the future will I no longer tolerate? Eyes wide open, man. For sure. ***1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Angel\"\n\nIf you had told me going in that this was the first episode of Buffy I really would have laid into and nitpicked to death, I would have been shocked. \"Angel\" is generally considered by all fans to be a turning point into the show becoming great. It didn't turn the show great YET. But it wouldn't have later become great without it. I am a little amazed and disturbed that if Arrow had aired this episode two seasons ago, I'd give it one star at best. Some positive turning point.\n\nLet's start off with the ugly. Xander telling Cordelia her outfit makes her look like a hooker is eye-opening to me. Major red flag there. Not only is it uncalled for, it's not even funny. It's telling that Joss Whedon identifies most with Xander Harris and made him the comic relief at the same time. I'm starting to get the feel for how he treats other people just based on the way Xander does. He thinks those kind of remarks are cute and endearing instead of hurtful and annoying. And it seems like he always did.\n\nYes, I'm aware David Greenwalt's name is in the writing credits. But Whedon was famous for sprinkling one-liners into other writers' scripts. If he didn't write that specific line, I'll eat my hat.\n\nBuffy talking about Darla being a bit worn around the edges is gross for the same reason, although since it's not constructed entirely as a clever quip, it's possible Whedon didn't write it.\n\nIt's very weird the Master is talking about power and responsibilities. That's Spider-Man's whole bit.\n\nKristine Sutherland made an interesting acting choice that I love, that I also entirely missed until now. But when she meets Angel for the first time, Sutherland plays it as if Joyce clearly doesn't like him. Whoever this strange man is, he's bad news, and she's trying to figure out how to get Buffy away from him without driving her straight into his arms. It's interesting that Joyce doesn't like or approve of Angel instantly, but she always seems to have gotten along with Spike. Which tickles me in hindsight.\n\nGiles' problem with fighting Buffy with the quarterstaff is that he forgets she has superpowers. Her easy victory is a lot less impressive than the show is saying it is.\n\nEven knowing it's coming, the Angel vampire reveal is quite effective. I don't know if I would have actually been surprised if I had first seen this episode before I already Angel's deal (I started watching the show in Season 2) but the dramatic beats of making it and revealing it as a surprise are sound.\n\nIn reality, don't you think this is something Angel should have already revealed and discussed with Buffy ahead of time? Granted, there would be no drama in the episode if they had done that, but I am not a big approver of creating drama in lieu of common sense.\n\nIf you ever need proof how dated the show actually is, just witness how freely Angel uses the word \"Gypsies\".\n\nIn Angel's first Vampire episode, it's revealed he has hospital blood-bags in his fridge. In later episodes it's said Angel drinks pig's blood, and that human blood is addictive and dangerous for him to drink because it makes him overly aggressive. I don't blame the writers for not having that down completely in his first real episode, but it's a difference I notice.\n\nI'm not saying the episode and the show downplayed Angelus' old actions in this episode. After all the Master declares \"Angel\" the most vicious creature he's ever met. At the same time, Giles saying Angelus was like all of the other Vampires will be retconned in season 2, when it's revealed that he's probably the cruelest and most evil vampire who ever lived. He's like if Hannibal Lecter lost his soul and humanity. It's also weird to hear the Master and Darla call him Angel when describing his previous evil actions. The series was not quite consistent on that point yet. Hearing Darla call him Angel after he's staked her especially hits the ear wrong.\n\nGiles pronounces \"Angelus\" correctly right off the bat, but he's one of the few characters in the first two seasons who do.\n\n\"It's so nice of you to invite me into your home.\" I don't like that line of Darla's. At all. It's said for effect for the sake of the audience, but it's not something a real person would ever say. This isn't just a problem with Buffy The Vampire Slayer by the way. That kind of atrocious dialogue was endemic in ALL television in 1997, especially genre. Subtlety was unheard of, and almost every show needed to hit the audience over the head with what was going on for fear of losing the audience's interest because the average audience member in question couldn't follow complex ideas. Now due to cable and streaming, television can be a lot more intelligently written, because smart people can now seek out smart shows, and those shows can find audiences and make money without having to worry about dumb viewers getting lost. Buffy was a show on network television at the time, and that line is a prime piece of evidence that it equally depended on dumb eyeballs as much as smart ones in a way current good television doesn't need to.\n\nWhile I'm on the subject of bad writing, Buffy finding Angel in the position with Joyce she did is beyond lazy, and not credible, and they really had to set up a ton of unbelievable and unlikely pieces to make it happen. As huge a moment as it is to see Buffy believe Angel has fed on and tried to kill her mother, they had to move mountains to put Angel in that specific moment, and none of it is remotely believable. I don't like that either.\n\nAngel and Buffy's fight at the end, as well as him goading her feel entirely unnecessary too.\n\nWillow and Buffy can still talk about nothing but boys. It's really tiresome.\n\nI like that Joyce questions what the school librarian is doing at the hospital to see her. Her asking that tells me she's far more sensible than the writers who gave her the lines about barbecue forks or the school really caring would have you believe.\n\nDarla using guns was a nice wrinkle.\n\nAngel says here that he's never fed on another human being since the day he was cursed. This was later retconned. Big time. He's actually done it several times.\n\nI adore the phrase \"With a song in my heart\" to describe violent, unforgivable actions. I named a Gilda And Meek story after that phrase for the same reason. It gives me the chills.\n\nI like the moment where Collin comforts the Master about losing Darla. I like it because it's a moment of empathy for two characters I barely know and roundly dislike anyways. What I especially like about it is that Collin uses the evil framework of \"Darla was weak and we're better off without her\". And he's doing it to make the Master feel better! One of the interesting things about the vampires in the franchise is that they can exhibit love, concern, and caring. And that doesn't change the fact that they are completely evil creatures at the same time. I think this is the first time we've witnessed that idea outside of Angel, and later on Spike and Drusilla. And it's the only time we've gotten that for either the Master OR the Anointed One as well.\n\nI have to say it was a huge mistake to kill off Darla this soon. She's a great character, and I see why Angel: The Series resurrected her. I get the logic of killing her off. By Angel doing that, he's resisting temptation once and for all, and casting the die and throwing in with the good guys. The problem is Darla still being a temptation would have been good for the show. I don't like or respond to love triangles, but this one already exists, and the stakes are much larger than \"My boyfriend didn't call me tonight. I think he's cheating\". I get the storytelling logic of Angel definitively choosing Buffy for this episode. I just don't agree with it. And this is spoken as someone who HATES love triangles! This one actually half-works, and it's not one I'd simply get rid of. Simply because there are so few that actually do.\n\nI will give the episode something. And it's something all Mutant Enemy shows deserve credit for: A great last scene. The cross being burned into Angel's chest after Buffy describing their last kiss as painful is properly romantic, grand, epic, iconic, memorable, and all those other big superlatives you want in a tragic romance. And I take note that unlike the contrivance of Buffy finding a half-dead Joyce in Angel's arms, they didn't have to move mountains to create the scene. It feels right and perfect, and it's the reason I respond to the Buffyverse in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, it's quite possible that great and memorable scene colored my response to how good the episode actually was back in the day. It actually sucked. But truthfully I don't think that amazing ending was why I overlooked the suckiness of the rest of the episode before now. I think I simply wasn't a sophisticated enough viewer and writer to recognize the rest of the episode as sucky, or understand that many of the story turns and pieces of cliched dialogue were b.s.. I'm not saying I've gotten too demanding in the meantime, but standards on TV HAVE been raised, and there is plenty of current stuff that can deliver an ending that bittersweet without the rest of the script being an utter mess. I think my standards have simply changed. What this means for me rewatching the rest of the franchise going forward is anybody's guess. *1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"I Robot, You Jane\"\n\nThe last time I reviewed this episode (in the beforetimes) was back when I got my first DVD player and reviewed the Buffy: Season 1 set (one of the first DVD's I ever got). I've seen it a few times since that review (which was quite pedestrian by my current writing standards) and I've also been through many DVD and Blu-Ray players in the meantime, but this is the first time I'll be writing down my thoughts since then.\n\nAnd the episode \"Angel\" concerned me because I always liked it back in the day, and clearly I was wrong. My old review declares \"I Robot, You Jane\" the single worst episode in the entire Buffyverse, with the worst dialogue hands down. Not an exact quote, but close enough. Can you see my concern from here?\n\nAnd yeah, it sucks, and yeah, it's probably the worst episode of Buffy (although there are a couple of Angel episodes that I hate more in hindsight). But what surprised me going in is that I liked the opening scene. It's a flashback to the 1600's which is refreshing and unusual enough. But the romance it's depicting that Moloch has cast on his last victim before Willow is actually same-sex, which I can't believe didn't register with me before. I must have simply thought Moloch's love worked differently between male and female acolytes, but I'm a very simple minded viewer now, no longer invested in refusing to believe what I'm seeing. The dude Moloch kills at the beginning is clearly gay, and it's weird that didn't register before.\n\nBut from there it's pretty much all downhill from Fritz's embarrassing \"jacked on\" rant. But the first thing the awful episode did to me is surprise me with a scene I liked.\n\nLet me see if I get this straight: Sunnydale High allows Xander to walk around with a T-shirt that says \"Porn star\" on it? How did I miss that? High definition makes everything better (and in this case much worse).\n\nThis is the era of teen television in which everything on the internet is portrayed as inherently dangerous. It's not just dated, it's wrong about the actual dangers that exist. Since this aired I have become aware of some of the very real dangerous things the internet has been responsible for. And almost all of those dangerous things DO involve misinformation. But it's more to do with people sharing hatred and propaganda, rather than tricking teen girls in chatrooms. I'm not saying that isn't a problem. But considering all of the real problems social media has caused the world, and this country in particular in the meantime, warnings about internet stranger danger feel like missing the forest for the trees. The real danger of the internet isn't the person on the other end. It's the misinformation that gets passed back and forth. People in 2021 meatspace using the internet rarely cause the kinds of havoc seen in 1997 network TV, and if they do, Chris Hansen is on top of it. I feel like the episode acting like the freedom of untold information is the great thing, but making online connections is bad, is the opposite moral they should be teaching.\n\nGranted, I have 24 years of hindsight to think that, but it's another reason this episode (and the show) are dated.\n\nIt's not credible Giles doesn't know Spider-Man. He's 40 years old, and a person.\n\n\"We read make our speaking English is good,\" is a great line. It's terrible dialogue, and in the episode with the worst dialogue, I am unsurprised they made it funny. It's the writers playing to their strengths.\n\nI knew I would be giving the episode a zero again by the scene with Willow writing to Malcolm in the computer library. Why does her school computer have a speech function? The show tries to pass Malcolm's voice off as emotionless but a real speech function in 1997 would actually sound like Stephen Hawking. There would be no inflections at ALL. And this is an intimate conversation, right? Why would she make it audible in a public area of the school? And it IS a public area. So where are all the other students? Is the show saying she's the only youth there interested in using a computer?\n\nAnd why is Dave using the speech function? He's essentially discussing and admitting his crimes in a public. And you know what? The suicide note read out-loud was extra tacky. I don't find that funny or entertaining. This show has some messed up priorities and ideas about what good horror actually is. That's just sick.\n\nLater when Moloch is in the robot body, it's clear how and why he was able to make the speech function work that way. Which means it never would have worked in real life, and as a computer nerd Willow would already know that. Before Miss Calendar came along, Willow was the group hacker. They made her in explicably computer illiterate in this episode which is another sign it's badly written.\n\nThis writing is all shady if you ask me. I called this the worst episode ever 15 years ago. If I was right is to be determined. But there's a ton of awful stuff in it that actually blew by me at the time.\n\n\"Tell me the truth. How's my hair?\" That admittedly made me laugh.\n\nXander falls down off the fence as if Uncle Phil just threw him out of the Bel Air mansion.\n\nI never gave the episode proper credit for this because I started watching in Season 2, but Miss Calendar already being in the loop about the demon on the internet IS actually a good and surprising twist.\n\nI like when Giles suggests a computer virus, Miss Calendar says he's seen too many movies. That's actually great.\n\nI'll tell you what I like: I like it because it happens over and over again, and isn't quite in your face any time. But Moloch appears to be creating various obscene moments of internet havoc among the tertiary or background characters. During scene transitions various never-before-seen characters express frustration over their laptops acting in bizarrely violent and even fascist ways. And I like that it's not made explicit for any of those weird happenings, and the viewer has to tie that together themselves. I will give this episode zero stars with no regrets. But the truth is it's better than I remembered in a lot of ways. Because of that.\n\n\"Demon come!\" is like the dirtiest demonic command in hindsight.\n\nWillow's last confrontation with Malcolm was beyond excruciating. I said this episode had the worst dialogue? Yup.\n\nThe score during the climax is pretty tinny and amateurish-sounding too. Even for this season.\n\nI like Giles' thing at the end about liking books over computers because they smell and have texture. It's understandable. It's weird. But it's understandable.\n\nFor the record it's a quirk I share. Tactile sensation is why I prefer books to Kindle and DVD's to streaming. It's relatable even if Jenny doesn't think it is. Physicality is the key. It's amazing the TV show is talking about this 20 years before I ever heard anyone else bring it up. It's definitely a real thing.\n\nOne last thing before I grade the episode the zero it may or not actually deserve. Joss Whedon said something many years ago after I watched and graded this episode so poorly that made me pause. He said it contained his favorite scene of the entire first season: The conversation between Buffy, Xander, and Willow talking about their disasters with relationships, and ending upon Xander joking that they were doomed, them all laughing, and then realizing it's not funny because it's true. Watching it again, I see why Whedon liked it. I still don't. It's cloying, and sounds like it comes from snarky adults on a sitcom rather than teenagers with actual problems. That's probably true for a LOT of the dialogue on the show. But I'm not giving this episode or that scene extra credit for it. It's actually kind of annoying.\n\nSo yeah, worst episode ever. At least until the one in Angel: Season 3 where Angel verbally threatens to eat his infant son in front of Wesley at the end, and Wesley is supposedly the bad guy for trying to stop it in the next episode. But one dud at a time. 0.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"The Puppet Show\"\n\nI suspected two things going in, and knowing them made me make a promise to myself. I was 95% sure that this episode was going to be overrated by both the creators and the fans. And I promised myself that wouldn't matter when I'm reviewing it. No matter its quality, I'm going to judge it by my own standards and expectations, not anyone else's. We'll see how I did.\n\nIn truth, I still feel the episode is overrated. But it's still the best episode so far. Why? We'll get to that. But it's a well constructed mystery for the viewer, that interests me because it isn't one for the characters. The characters take an awful lot on faith, and even though the audience is given the information they are right to (out of context) Buffy and her friends have no way of knowing that. When Xander suggests they may have been \"Keyzer Sozed\" for all THEY knew, he could have been right. And they would have been screwed because they would have had no counter to that. But that's for later. We'll get there soon enough.\n\nFirst, I again object to the idea that there are several murders at the school and the students are not sent home, and school and / or the talent show aren't canceled as a result.\n\nI'll tell you something that shocked me. Principle Snyder was infamous on this show for being the one character with zero redeeming virtues. But I actually liked his first scene. I loathed him as much as I remembered from his second scene forward, but I like that he hears Buffy, Willow, and Xander mocking a teacher's discomforts and punishes them for it. What shocks me is that it actually serves them right. They were being obnoxious brats simply because they knew Giles wouldn't call them on it. Regardless of their relationship to Giles outside of school, they shouldn't be talking to him like that IN school, especially in front of other people. In school he is not their peer or their friend. He's an authority figure. I liked the new principle reacting badly to that and defending his teacher's honor.\n\nOf course in the very next scene Snyder is revealed to be the single worst human dirtbag in the show, but I'm shocked his earliest negative impression of Buffy and friends is actually justified. Did not expect that.\n\nThings Snyder won't tolerate: \"Students loitering on campus after school. Horrible murders with hearts being removed. And also smoking.\" So we know the dude's priorities.\n\nHe is also a sufficient red herring and mislead. He's so horrible you wish he's the culprit, which is part of why you might think he is.\n\nXander and Giles' trick with Cordelia's hair IS kinda neat.\n\nLet's delve in the mystery further. I think it's exceptional as far as the viewer is concerned. In fact, I don't believe I've understood exactly how tight it was, and how impressive its narrative tricks were before this viewing. And one of the reasons I noticed THIS time is because I am aware that the Buffyverse has a problem of telling very unfair mysteries to the viewer, that do not hold up to scrutiny. That is the entirety of the arcs of Season 7 of Buffy and Seasons 3 and 4 of Angel. It is obviously easier to tell a mystery fairly if it only occurs over the course of one episode. But the episode went above and beyond at first glance.\n\nThe thing I love is the deliciously brief, out-of-context scene between Sid and Morgan, where Sid is trying to convince Morgan to kill Buffy. Outside of everything else, it means Sid is guilty. Knowing the actual solution means the writers basically figured out a genius way to make a scene of Sid planning Buffy's murder being iron-clad evidence to the audience in hindsight that Sid is actually innocent! Another major clue (which I missed entirely until this viewing) is that when Xander takes Sid to the library, while Giles, Willow, and Xander don't say anything that sounds incriminating to each other, to an outside observer with Sid's mission, the things they are researching, and the fact that they are trying to help Buffy, makes them sound like willing and knowing accomplices to a demon murderer. Now if Sid were slightly smarter, he'd question how and why Demon Buffy could possibly have finagled real human allies, but it works if you accept Sid is under pressure, and believes he's working on a clock. Everything fits.\n\nFor the audience. In reality, Buffy was foolish to trust him. Or at least trust him as much she did. I'm not saying her trust was unfounded or unreasonable, but it could have screwed them if she was wrong. And I think her being right is luck more than anything. If Sid had been scamming Buffy (or as Xander put it, Keyser Sozeing her) he said the exact right things. I recently wrote a comic book story involving the fake psychic scam known as \"cold reading\" which is how John Edward convinces grieving people he can contact their dead loved ones, and why I believe that man is sinister and belongs in jail. But I recognized a lot of what Sid said as consistent with how cold readers get people to believe unlikely stories. One of those ways is to flatter the listener. He tells her he suspected she was the demon because how could not after seeing what she could do? Also playing to Buffy's vanity is Sid claiming to have known and loved a Slayer. The reality is, if Sid WERE Keyser Soze, these are all lies he could have believably made up off the top of his head to cover his tracks. And Buffy would have believed him anyways, even if he were guilty. The audience is given a few ironclad instances that Sid is on the level. Buffy should actually be a LOT less sure of that than she claims to Xander, if she were being more responsible. But she believes Sid is on the level for the same reason people believe in John Edward: He made a seemingly real connection with her. The fact that it WAS real is random luck as far as I'm concerned. He offered no proof, and him disappearing when he did meant Xander's theory should at least have been considered.\n\nI love mysteries that make me pour through minutia, which makes this a good one.\n\nFinally, let's talk about the tag. Probably the most overrated scene in Buffy history. I have been a Buffy fan for a LONG time. I actually used to collect the VHS tapes. The tapes were also woefully inadequately collected and the first 3 seasons essentially only contained the 6 most important episodes to the given season's arc. The last Season 1 tape collected this episode instead of Prophecy Girl which was a mistake beyond all reason.\n\nAnd the reason given for including it with the tapes is the tag. In 1997 when this aired, networks used to cut off the end credits of programs, and the makers of the tapes assumed people would like to have this for posterity because obviously it would only be aired on the WB the once, and never seen again. But I've seen it aired repeatedly since then, even on the WB. FX aired it in every time it broadcast the episode, so I think the makers of the tapes thought it would be a rarer Easter Egg than it was. And yeah, it's on Hulu with no fuss or muss too.\n\nAnd you know what? It's not even funny. It's not worth destroying the entire Season One arc just for a 30 second improv from the cast. So that's where I stand.\n\nSo yeah, maybe the episode is overpraised for some things. But on another real level (the construction of the mystery) I don't think it's praised enough. ****1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Nightmares\"\n\nAh, the Fear / Nightmare Trope. A better demonstration of it here than most projects. And this is spoken as someone who doesn't really dig the episode. It's boring, but it still used the trope well.\n\nI have a surprisingly significant superficial-sounding complaint. The actor who plays Billy looks FAR too similar to Andrew J. Ferchland. I've seen the episode many times, so I know better, but if it had been a few weeks since you last saw the Anointed One, you might be a little confused about who the kid in the teaser is. The fact that Ferchland is in the episode too doesn't help much. They look that much alike.\n\nIf you ever believed Marti Noxon was a terrible writer and showrunner, and should not have been placed in charge of things from Season 6 onward, this episode gives you all the proof of that you need. It is clearly demonstrated here that Buffy has a very real fear of being buried alived, the other characters see that for themselves, and it isn't brought up once in the first three episodes of season 6 (or ever again). Make no mistake: Joss Whedon is not off the hook for this unforgivable oversight either. He actually wrote the story for this specific episode! If he were doing the bare minimum of his job, instead of spending his free time telling the cast and other writers how much he thinks they suck, he would have caught this himself. Season 6 really is unacceptable on every level.\n\nI very much like that idea that when Collin was a mortal boy, his biggest fear was monsters. A child psychologist would have a field day with The Annoying One.\n\n\"It's funny if you're me,\" is a good line. And really unfortunate in hindsight. And almost certainly written by Whedon. Like I said. Unfortunate.\n\nI mentioned this is a great use of the Fear / Nightmare Trope. I love Wendell's fear of spiders. Because he doesn't hate them, he loves them, and his fear come from guilt. That's a very interesting and unusual dynamic which is why this episode uses the trope better than most.\n\nUnfortunately as well written as the tropes are, for a horror episode, the direction is really quite bland. It could have been seen on Degrassi Junior High in the 1980's. That's how basic the school drama is. That's a regular problem for Season 1, but it should not effect the Nightmare episode. It does right by the trope in the writing (rare) and botches the execution (frankly, also rare).\n\nLike \"I Robot, You Jane\", various misfortunes involving the premise seem to be happening in the background to various never-before-seen characters. Also like that episode, they are mostly played for laughs (the tough kid being embarrassed by his gushy mom is kind of funny).\n\nKudos to the show for making Cordelia's fears as stupid as they should be.\n\nI am very unimpressed that Xander is the type of person who picks up random candy off the floor and eats it. I don't care that it's already wrapped, he doesn't know where it comes from, or where it's been, so it's totally stupid and nasty.\n\nAnd he's so stupid he can't even imagine brand-name candy bars.\n\nWillow's stage fright fears were great. Do you know what's ironic? Alyson Hannigan obviously has some real-life hang-ups about her singing voice, so it's kind of funny this was a part of Willow before it ever became an issue in the musical episode.\n\nBuffy as a vampire was interesting. It's played as if that's what she actually is but it doesn't completely track because she never acts or does anything evil. But that describes Spike sometimes when he has a larger agenda of working with the Scoobies. Perhaps evil Buffy thought being human again and saving the day were actually in her best interest. But that still doesn't fully track with the behavior of other vampires.\n\nStill a vampire doing the right and noble thing for entirely selfish reasons is not unheard of. That's that janky raping cretin Spike's entire reason for getting his soul back. I just can quite figure out what Buffy's selfish reasons could possibly be, especially considering how empathetically she still treats Billy.\n\nI'm probably overthinking it, and it was simply badly written. But the problem is that I'm always the guy trying to figure out reasons why what I just saw wasn't actually badly written. It's a definite flaw of mine and I tend to rate bad episodes of something I otherwise like higher than I should because of it. This episode will probably be another example of that.\n\nDo you know what does track? Giles' fear of Buffy dying, and her fears of being buried alive and turning into a vampire compound on and compliment each other beautifully. There is almost an elegance and symmetry to each worsening level of horror there.\n\nFinally, I'm going to go into a bit of depth why the Fear / Nightmare Trope almost never works, at least not for me. I almost never believe it or find it credible.\n\nMost projects are unwilling to give their heroes realistic fears in these types of episodes. Their scenarios are so outlandish and outside of the audience's experience, that you'd think the first thing the character would wonder is if they were dreaming, realize they were, and find the power to fight the nightmare and wake themselves up. The very first time I saw the trope (outside of Star Trek, which has so much crazy stuff going on it doesn't count) was the third episode ever of Batman: The Animated Series, \"Nothing To Fear\". That episode is utter turd on every level, and it's the biggest reason I think that for the most part, the DC Animated Universe version of Scarecrow is a total dud.\n\nYou see, Batman's life is genuinely scary. He deals with life-threatening and horrifying things every night. But that was the era of kids television that believed a hero showing a human emotion like fear is a weakness, rather than something the viewer, young or old can relate to. No, when Scarecrow sics his fear toxic on Batman, Batman isn't afraid of the Joker learning his identity and killing everyone he cares about. He's afraid... Groan, his father, Thomas Wayne would be disappointed in him! Of course! Basically the producers decided the actual scary thing in Batman's life is the idea that he simply isn't awesome ENOUGH! It's a bit disgusting on some level to be truthful. Instead of me thinking Batman brave for not having a life-threatening, or God forbid \"unflattering\" fear, I'm questioning the World's Great Detective's logical capabilities. He's freaking Batman! There is no part of Thomas Wayne that would ever be ashamed of him and not proud of every inch of him. How dumb is Batman's fear to boil down to bogus insecurity he should already know isn't true? They wanted to give Batman a flattering fear? In truth it makes it so I cannot actually think any less of him. What a dope.\n\nYou can argue, \"Fears are irrational, and fears don't make sense.\" Which would be perfectly fine if Batman were a stupid and gullible person. Intelligence-wise he's supposed to be one of the smartest people in the world! And he worries Daddy won't love him for risking his neck every night to save lives and bring criminals to justice in his parents' honor? C'mon, now. How dumb do you think I am? Because you are portraying the World's Greatest Detective as even dumber than that.\n\nThe reasons Buffy's fears resonate with me is because I think a lot of them are justified. Not only because stuff like Xander being in his underwear is coming true, but as the series progressed, although we RARELY saw Hank Summers, what we DID see of him leads me to believe he's one of the worst fictional fathers on television. I don't believe Buffy is being a drama queen for her essentially having Batman's same fear. I believe she totally thinks Hank has this in him to actually say to her on a bad day. What makes me angry (and really empathize with Buffy's pain here) is that I think she's right. The guy is never there, and frankly him giving a real reason for cutting ties other than just always refusing to answer the phone would actually be a vast improvement. Basically, as horrible as Buffy's vision of her father is, he's far more present and real in the dream state than he is in reality. I sympathize with Buffy rather than Batman because Batman thinking Thomas Wayne sucks is unforgivable, and Buffy thinking Hank Summers sucks is totally accurate. Did I mention that I love how the episode uses the trope and it's one of the few fictional projects I did? Buffy can't reason herself out of the worst of this stuff because unlike most saps who fall for and believe the dumb things the trope shows them, she has no evidence they are actually untrue. Maybe she'd piece it together quicker knowing a bunch of nightmarish things are happening to everybody else too, but it's credible simply because Hank DOES suck that much, and Buffy always believed he had that in him. And he probably would have said something similar to this at some point if he weren't such a GD coward all the time.\n\nLike I said, the episode handled the premise wonderfully. I'm not giving it five stars though. No TV episode that ever does the awful and lame Wizard of Oz callback at the end deserves that. Four's the best I can do. Sorry. ****.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Out Of Mind... Out Of Sight\"\n\nCan you believe it's episode 11 and this is Cordelia's first spotlight? Long overdue.\n\nHer chastising Shakespeare's Shylock for every single thing she herself is guilty of is Cordelia in a nutshell.\n\nI like that Buffy is wistful that she used to be May Queen. Xander isn't selling the \"You don't need that, you've got us now,\" argument very well, is he?\n\nActually, Xander, the vampire bat joke WAS funny. It borders on criminal no-one else laughed.\n\n\"Can you say 'Gulp?'\" Another good one.\n\nPrinciple Snyder is proving to be an effective thorn in the heroes' sides. He's an unneeded complication in scenes that didn't used to have that complication, which makes him an good antagonist. Plus Armin Shimerman makes the dude super easy to hate.\n\nUltimately, I don't think the invisibility gimmick is believable here. At least not to me. I imagine there are superhero fans who'd dig it. But my problem with the power is the person would always be accidentally knocking into people who don't see them. Marci commits her attacks in crowded public spaces, gets away clean each time, and isn't knocked over flat even once. Xander said it's the superpower he wants the most. It's the one I'd want least. It's the Monkey's Paw of superpowers. It's the one that puts the person in the most unwitting danger without even realizing it until the truck hits them. And it never stops. The episode exploring its abilities without ever even hinting at the alarmingly huge amount of drawbacks means it's failing the premise.\n\nYou could argue that maybe Marci doesn't knock people over because she's had the power for so long and mastered it. My opinion is that is not something a person could EVER get used to or master. A ninja maybe. A high school girl? No way.\n\nI loved Xander's line of \"Want to come over for dinner? Mom's making her famous phone call to the Chinese place.\" That's great. It clearly came from a middle-aged comedy writer rather than a high school kid. But that's why it's funny.\n\nVampires not casting shadows is a form of invisibility. No wonder Angel has Giles spooked. But not being able to see yourself in the mirror is an overrated pleasure.\n\nDo you know what REALLY bums me out about Angel and Giles' first scene? They really like each other! Giles is legitimately grateful to have someone find something as amazing as the Codex for him and I get the sense Angel is never allowed to talk to guys like Giles as a peer. Until now. They don't exactly trust each other yet. But they both trust Buffy and that's good enough. It kills me that Giles is a far bigger advocate for Angel's role as Buffy's helper than Xander ever could be. Especially considering what that vampire butthole is gonna wind up doing to him in season 2 when he turns evil. What a waste of a perfectly good potential bromance.\n\nCordelia's May Queen acceptance speech is TOO terrible. I know it's supposed to be funny, but there is no way I can sympathize with anything else bad that happens to her in the episode from that point forward. The problem with Season 1 Cordelia is that she simply isn't dumb (or innocent) enough. She's too smart and insightful to be forgiven. She seems to be fully aware of how horrible she is. But believes it's fully justified against whichever lesser being she chooses to bully. Which makes her deplorable rather than funny.\n\nI like Charisma Carpenter's line-reading on \"Bait?\". I also like Buffy correctly agreeing with Cordy that canceling the celebration is letting Marci win, and that that's wrong because she's way more evil than Cordy herself. What's especially messed up is that it's true.\n\nCordelia's speech to Buffy about feeling alone is something she believes is a valid explanation for her messed up views and behavior. In reality, it's a blazing indictment of them. Like I said, she's TOO smart. She knows how wrong it is, and does it anyways. That justification to Buffy seemed to justify Marci's actions far more than they would be if Cordy hadn't said it.\n\nI like Marci calling that out for being the manipulative drivel it was when she tried it on her. But as Buffy said, she's a full-on loony. so I can't fully support her disgust with that while she's attempting to carve up and disfigure Cordy's face to horrify future generations of children. Bummer.\n\nFBI guys all around the episode in the background. The show is always good at those kinds of background \"set-up\" Easter Eggs. They get especially good at them in Season 4. This is a good and rough early example.\n\nBuffy was all \"Little late, fellas,\" to the FBI agents and she was right. They've been on-campus the entire episode. There was no excuse for them to only show up after it was already over.\n\nLike \"Teacher's Pet\", the episode ends on a twisted and delightful cliffhanger that was never resolved, nor ever intended to be resolved. But the idea of the government having a special ops team of invisible assassins is great. Am I wrong in thinking this probably should have come up in the Initiative arc in Season 4?\n\nThis was solid but I found plenty to complain about too. ***1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Prophecy Girl\"\n\nThe underwhelming end to the teaser with the Master was fun specifically because it was deliberately underwhelming as a joke and wink to the audience. This is definitely the first episode written and directed by Whedon.\n\nBuffy breaking a nail is a callback to the movie. The end of the world is truly nigh for that reason.\n\nThis episode is a turning point. It contains the best scene Joss Whedon had ever written up to that point. Granted, Sarah Michelle Gellar did most of the heavy lifting, but the words he gave her were pitch perfect: \"I'm 16 years old. I don't want to die.\" How is it that people were screaming at the unfairness of Sarah Michelle Gellar being snubbed for an Emmy nomination for \"The Body\" when the truth is she should have been nominated already in Season 1 for this? When she asks if it will hurt my heart breaks. She throws things at Giles when he starts talking about the signs, and she yells at him to tell her her fortune, and that he's useless there with \"your books\". That's a perfect distillation of the unfairness of the Watcher / Slayer dynamic. Granted, it's no fun for Giles. But just because as Buffy herself says, \"That the deal,\" doesn't mean it's not a totally raw deal.\n\nXander's invitation to Buffy to the dance it outwardly sweet. But it drives me crazy. He botches what could have been a nice moment for the both of them. When she tells him she doesn't want to ruin what they have, he could have backed down gracefully, said \"You have a point\", or \"Call me if you ever change your mind.\" Instead he's like, \"That's not the point. You either feel something or you don't.\" That manipulative. He's making Buffy be the bad guy, and he counting his increasingly diminished chances on the fact that's she too nice to be direct with him. But I don't think a \"nice guy\" backing a girl into a corner deserves niceness. Because he isn't being nice. Frankly this is a lesson I could have probably taken myself earlier in my life and saved myself some grief, but I don't like the fact that stuff like this ALWAYS happens on TV with characters like Xander and the character is never called on it.\n\nWhat's worse is he's petulant and rude to her after HE forced HER to do that. He not only forced her to be the bad guy, but let her feel and believe she was that every second she had to do it. Some friend.\n\nFrankly when Aeryn called out Stark for this on Farscape, as a person who loved Stark, I was devastated. But she was right to do it, and it also made me admire both her and Farscape. It's not fair that Xander is putting the responsibility to set limits in their relationship entirely on her. I wouldn't even object too much to her feeling her out and seeing where the limits need to be. But he shouldn't be making her set them all herself. That's not fair. If he senses she's uncomfortable, he needs to back up, at least a little. He shouldn't be demanding a definitive answer from her about something she's clearly never even thought about before.\n\nAnd after all that, he thoughtlessly asks Willow to the dance without once considering how much that would actually hurt her. Because if there is one thing nice guy creeps are good at, it's spreading their nice guy creepiness outwards to infect others around them.\n\nAnd what bothers me the most is that Xander is Joss Whedon's surrogate character! Whedon speaks though him. And apparently the initial plan was for Buffy and Xander to end up together! He didn't realize with all of the various petty sabotaging Xander has done between Buffy and Angel, including suggesting killing him without talking to him, how bad that would come off as? Am I really supposed to believe the guy who created television's most visible \"Nice Guy\" creep as his own surrogate is a feminist or an ally? And am I to understand he calls himself that without ever being a single bit aware of how episodes like this make Xander come across?\n\nNo, Joss, the problem isn't that people don't get you or your humor. The problem is you are a creep. That's always been the only problem, and why we aren't allowed nice things.\n\nI do have a shameful confession. I have used the line \"On a scale of 1 to 10, it sucked\" many times. Often in these very reviews. I can only take my bashing and disdain of Xander and Whedon so far as long as I possess the brass to do that. Mea culpa.\n\nI love the scene of Joyce giving Buffy the dress. Best mom ever. Although I think Joyce miscalculated something. She tries to sell the idea of her going to the prom alone and winding up meeting Hank as an example of a happy ending. Considering what a turd Hank is, it might actually be a cautionary tale instead.\n\nI like that Miss Calendar expresses surprise that Buffy is the Vampire Slayer because she's so little. It's funny because it's true. That's only the kind of joke the series could do once it was up and running for a bit. It wouldn't make sense if Gellar hadn't been cast as Buffy yet. Which makes it fun.\n\nThe scene with Cordelia and Willow bonding over how annoying and not cute it was the guys were watching cartoons is amazing for how quickly it devolves from humor to appalling horror. The bloody handprint on the TV over the dancing pigs really sells what an actual violation to the kids' safety this actually is. And that's got to be extremely tough to get across in a show where students are routinely murdered every week. But the bloody handprint on the happy pigs sells why Willow is as devastated as she is, even after all this.\n\n\"It wasn't our world anymore. They made it theirs. And they had fun.\" Joss Whedon's reputation for perfect dialogue is somewhat overstated, but things like this and Buffy's earlier scene with Angel and Giles are the reasons he has it to begin with.\n\nAlso, tell me again why school wasn't canceled after that.\n\nAfter all that, Willow telling Buffy she likes her dress is why I like Willow. It's a perfectly Willow thing to say.\n\nAgain, I don't want to take away too much credit away from Joss Whedon's dialogue writing ability. He IS good. But ultimately it is probably fair to say that a LOT of his career success has to do with pure timing and luck. He is very lucky television was as bad and hackneyed and cliched as it was before he got there. The truth is the line, \"Tell him... Think of something clever, and tell him I said it,\" is not particularly smart or clever as far as writing dialogue goes. But Whedon is the first guy ever to make that specific obvious joke so it seems like the most brilliant thing ever. Whedon's star only really started to diminish once people as good or better at this than he was started to give him competition. When the most famous TV writers from this era is a jackass like David E Kelly, who won shelffuls of Emmys despite being the worst fictional writer of the 1980's and 1990's, Whedon had the medium and the entire playing field to himself for two or three solid years. And people complaining about Whedon never winning an Emmy never really understand why it doesn't bother me. Those idiots gave Kelly, a writer who is basically a cautionary tale in every single aspect of how you should NOT write a script, boatloads of Emmys for multiple terrible series. I don't think Breaking Bad nabbing the Emmys even matters nowadays. After Kelly fooled the organization so long into believing he could pass for a good scriptwriter, writing Emmys are meaningless and not worth winning. Whedon never winning and only being nominated once is actually a career selling point if you ask me. Twin Peaks was shut out too. The Emmys don't reward great television. They reward easy television. What's amazing is that that line makes the impact it does because it's effortless. Because TV was so bad it never occurred to anyone else before Whedon wrote it. So Whedon saying a very funny but obvious joke makes him the hottest writer in Hollywood. And that's largely due to luck. If television were at the current quality it is now in 1997-99 Whedon would get practically no attention or traction. But his success involves writing great scenes when no-one else was even writing good ones. And never winning anything because none of his shows had a creepy dancing baby.\n\nWhedon never needed to be great to catch fire the way he did. He just needed to be good when nothing else was. And yeah, that's what happened.\n\nI think this next bit might be a plot-hole on Joss Whedon's part, but I'm going to choose to believe it was deliberate. But when Buffy tells the Anointed One she knows who he is, you can assume that the prophecy was botched by Joss himself, and he didn't keep the story consistent enough to make what he planned in episode 5 go down the way it should have. Whether that is true or not (and I suspect it's true) I choose to view it as a happy accident instead. If that huge a part of the prophecy is so clearly wrong, isn't it possible that Buffy's death is being misinterpreted too? And the reason I will give the episode that benefit of the doubt, is because that's what happened. I choose to believe a sloppy mistake is clever foreshadowing instead. Because despite all my negative reviews of various things, I like finding reasons to like a project rather than excuses to hate it. The notion that prophecies are not all they are cracked up to be gives me a reason to actually like the Annointed One's inconsistent arc. And that's just fine with me.\n\nI like that Xander and Willow are all \"Do you mind?\" to Miss Calendar and wondering why she's now in the club. It's actually a fair question.\n\nThe Locutus of Borg reference is so great because it's the first time I had ever seen a pop-culture reference to the Borg from Star Trek: The Next Generation. That made the joke matter to me when I first saw it back in the day.\n\nAs much as I hate Xander in the episode, him thrusting the cross at Angel and saying he didn't like him was cool, as was him asking him to prove Buffy right that he's a person. Xander is such a manipulative bunghole earlier on. I can actually like him when he's direct.\n\nI love that the Hellmouth opens directly in the high school library. That's something I have always loved.\n\nSpeaking of great dialogue, the Master dryly disparaging the \"feeble banter\" portion of the fight is not great dialogue (and the feeble banter actually IS feeble). But Joss is the first guy to do the joke, so he has the playing field entirely to himself, and it seemed like genius at the time. The credit belongs to him for something Dan Harmon or Vince Gilligan could have pooped out in their sleep today. The guy was super lucky everyone else was so bad at this.\n\nThe Master taunting Buffy that he needed her there to escape in the first place was a great and horrifying moment. He seems to have similar mesmerizing and telekinetic powers as Dracula in Season 5. I also liked her echoing that he liked her dress after he kills her and she drops dead face-first into the water. Although unlike Willow, it's cold-blooded rather than cute when he says it.\n\nI like Buffy telling the Master he has fruit punch mouth. THAT is a perfectly Buffy thing to say.\n\nYeah, yeah, Angel, everyone likes the dress.\n\nI don't like the idea that Xander saves the day by giving Buffy the Prince Charming kiss. I don't like that subtext one bit.\n\nThe Master is so old that when he's dusted he leaves behind his bones. There's a Yo Momma snap in there somewhere. I'm sure of it.\n\nHis slo-mo walking outside WAS pretty epic. Nice moment.\n\nThis is the best episode so far, and arguably the first great one. But do you know what? The score still totally sucks! It's bad when the only music cue that really lands is when they play the Nerd Herder theme during the climactic Power Walk. I think this great episode would have been even better had Christophe Beck been around to score it. Still, great. *****.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"When She Was Bad\"\n\nBuffy doesn't just have issues. She has a whole subscription.\n\nFirst Christophe Beck score. And the show is miles better for it.\n\n\"Hey, guys. Miss me?\" is a pretty iconic moment.\n\nNice to see David Boreanaz in the main titles.\n\nLiked Giles questioning the wisdom of Principle Snyder's vocation.\n\nI like the look of bitter shade Giles gives Xander when Xander wins his bet over when Giles would say he'd need to consult his books.\n\nI don't like the dream sequence where Giles turns into the Master and tries to kill Buffy. It doesn't play fair with the viewer. Also, did they actually hired Mark Metcalf back or just get in a stand-in to wear the make-up? He doesn't look quite right.\n\n\"Oh, sarcasm. Right.\" I hate that line. Season 2 is the era of the show when it was starting to become great. But it's not great yet. And Whedon often would have the characters say something embarrassingly stupid and then say \"I can't believe I just said that.\" Joss was trying to have it both ways. Have the characters be as dumb as a jokey bad TV show, but buying it back as he tried to make things on the show seem more and more credible and grounded. It never worked. Willow believing the clog-dancing is not remotely believable, and the joke is badly written and ill-placed.\n\nCase in point. \"A bitcuh?\" I don't know how Whedon shows his face in public after that.\n\n\"They're gonna cook her dinner?\" It's really beyond the pale and unacceptable at this point.\n\nHowever Snyder not knowing smell is one of the five senses is actually in character for that dope.\n\nThis mentions something about the Anointed One that either brushed by me or I forgot. It mentions he has power and control over the other Vampires, and that they will do whatever he says. For obvious reasons Andrew J. Ferchland's days on the series are numbered, but that's a cool idea. It's very interesting he can get the vampires to keep digging in a grave with consecrated soil. Nothing says they'll do anything for him quite like burying through dirt while their hands are set on fire.\n\nAbsalom is a pretty cool villain. It's a shame he lasted only the one episode. But Joss really enjoys killing off black characters so we are where we are. His death is pretty great though.\n\n\"You've got something on your nose.\" Xander is the worst.\n\nA rarity: Hank Summer's isn't the worst person in the episode. I don't think that ever happened again outside of dream sequences and flashbacks.\n\nBuffy's dance with Xander is so mean because it's cruel to three different people at once (Xander, Willow, and Angel) for three different reasons. It's not a great thing to realize in hindsight how good Joss Whedon is at writing casual cruelty.\n\nI liked Cordelia saying she could hold her own. Not the response Buffy was looking for, and I like that Cordy didn't take the bait.\n\nSpeaking of bait, the selling point of Angel is that he can tell when a trap is not going down as planned. He's smarter than Buffy. It's no wonder he later pulled the same scam himself when he turned evil.\n\nXander saying he'll kill Buffy if they hurt Willow is the emptiest of threats, but you can tell he believes he means it when he says it.\n\nFor some reason I like that they've stopped treating the Anointed One's voice.\n\nBuffy saying killing all the vampires would distract them is a good line.\n\nUnfortunately, I dislike the idea of Buffy torturing vampires. What sucks is that this is a problem Whedon, who believes he's progressive and woke, should have picked up on himself. Yeah, vampires aren't people and are completely evil monsters. But that's why showing a hero like Buffy torturing them is shady. Well, vampires aren't people, so it's okay. Well, terrorists are monsters too, so that's okay. And Muslims are pretty much terrorists, right? See how the dehumanization chain works? If you can come up with a rationalization for torture for a pretend reason like Whedon has here, your mind will get closer to accepting it for a real-world reason on real people. If Buffy were called on it at the end of the episode, and this was treated as part of her \"Dark Buffy\" arc in the episode, it would be one thing. But instead Whedon is acting like she just means business, and is finally taking things seriously. It's not okay.\n\nBuffy smashing the Master's bones was cathartic and the right way to start off the second season.\n\n\"We could grind our enemies' bones into Talcum Powder, but gosh we just did that yesterday.\" I like the \"All is forgiven\" expressions on Xander and Willow's faces.\n\n\"I hate that girl.\" There is so much about the Anointed One I do not know, and I regret that I never will.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer is known for having very weak and boring premieres. I think this one and the seventh season's opener are the only ones that feel narratively satisfying, and as a good kick-off to the season in question. But I do however feel that much of the writing is still sophomoric, and that Whedon still hadn't fully got ahold of how seriously to take the premise and treat the characters' intelligence. It's a pretty good episode in and of itself, and a rare decent premiere, but it still contains many growing pains. Much like Buffy herself. ****.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Some Assembly Required\"\n\nI like that Anthony Stewart Head has taken over the opening narration. He has a lot more gravitas and far less cheese than the WB announcer ever did.\n\nI like that Angel is actually jealous of Xander! What a dope! Buffy is right to call him on the \"He's just a kid,\" thing. It's another reason I think Buffy and Angel's jailbait romance was so ill-thought out in hindsight.\n\nAnd he is not afraid to use Cordelia to get Buffy jealous. That's the emotional maturity level of the Vampire with a Soul.\n\nSame students in the same clothing walking across the opening wide shot of the high school. What a coincidence!\n\nI like Giles suddenly deciding this was none of their business. But the whole stork thing is a smokescreen.\n\nI will actually get into the debate over whether a tomato is a fruit or a vegetable. It's a vegetable. Full stop. I don't care if it has seeds. So do cucumbers. Are you saying THOSE are fruit? That's a slippery salad and sub topping slope, my friend. It's a vegetable. One of the very real things science is wrong about.\n\nWeird that the episode is directed by a guy named Bruce Seth Green. No relation?\n\n\"Yeah, I knew that. But did you see the look on her face?\" One of the few things I like about Xander is that he knows the right way to get a proper negative reaction from Cordelia. As far as obnoxious person skillsets go, that doesn't suck.\n\n\"Love makes you do the wacky.\" That's a great line. Full-stop.\n\nBuffy's an old-fashioned gal. She was raised to believe the men dig up the corpses, and the women have the babies. Another great line.\n\nCall Xander an optimist but he's hoping to find a fortune in gold doubloons.\n\nXander saying it's a first that Cordelia has told the truth hits me BADLY. It's wrong. Love her or hate her, she is always completely honest. It's like Xander was grasping for an insult in the moment, seized on the untrue thing, and said it because there was no better slam available. Xander's a jerk. That doesn't surprise me. What bothers me is that none of the other characters call him on that. Not even Cordelia! It bugs the poo outta me.\n\nI love how Buffy's criticizing throwing the body parts away from a time-management standpoint. Honestly, being analytical like that is an important skillset for a given hero to have. Buffy isn't given it enough and neither are most other heroes, who tend to have to have the smarter person in their supporting casts point out things like that.\n\nEric singing \"My Girl\" as he cuts off Cordelia's head on the picture shows how messed up he is. It's a good jump cut to end the scene. Eric's so creepy he has a porn collection that scares even Xander.\n\nI like Jenny saying Miss Calendar is her father.\n\nI like Giles' rugby slam. It's a good one.\n\nThe moment of Daryl under the bleachers is moving simply due to Christophe Beck's music cue (although the episode's score was by Adam Fields). The second Beck joined the show, it got ten times better than it was.\n\nIt is never a good idea to invite Cordelia to scream all she wants.\n\nThe climax leading to the lab being set on-fire is a bit unlikely and convenient, but it sort of works.\n\n\"Do you mind? We're talking here.\" Xander is the worst.\n\nFor some reason at the end of the episode, learning the first thing Daryl said to Chris after he woke up is that he shouldn't have brought him back makes me forgive him a little. Nice touch.\n\nSolid-ish week. ***1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"School Hard\"\n\nSpike running over the Sunnydale town sign, stepping out of the car, lighting a cigarette and saying \"Home sweet Home\" is like the perfect introductory scene for the character. Him immediately poking holes in the braggy Vampire's crucifixion story by using Woodstock is an allegory is great too, and sort of tells us everything about the character immediately. I really like the idea that many vampires falsely claim to have been at the Crucifixion in the same way many Boomers falsely claim they were at Woodstock. It's very instructive about what world events actually effected Vampire-kind. And I think the thing that created the Cross and Holy Water is definitely a defining moment in the next generation of Vampires. A Was A Moment.\n\nDrusilla makes a similarly favorable impression by saying absolutely insane sounding things in a spooky voice with those bulging eyes. I love the way Spike dotes on her, which is another fascinating insight into the ways vampires can care about and love each other (which will be more fully explored later on).\n\n\"Miss Edith speaks out of turn. She's a bad example and she'll have no cakes today.\" I mean, that's just NUTS! I like that she can do the Vampire roar.\n\n\"What's the up, guys?\" is great Buffyspeak.\n\nSpike's introduction to Buffy is memorable too, although his predatory stalking of her in the Bronze has unfortunate implications for later on.\n\nI like Xander saying he's putting a collar with a little bell on Angel.\n\nAre we supposed to believe Buffy is so stupid that she doesn't know you put sugar in lemonade? Because I don't. Typical Season 2 cheap joke that isn't remotely credible.\n\nI like that Cordelia is immediately impressed with Joyce's appearance. She declares her a woman who really knows how to moisturize.\n\nDo you know what I'm not impressed with? Joyce's intelligence. Her taking what an obvious worm like Snyder says at face value says she is very unfair to her daughter.\n\nSpike's \"William The Bloody\" mythology is surprisingly tight with what came later. Yes, he's faced and killed two Slayers since the Boxer Rebellion. However, some of this was retconned later on. Angelus wasn't actually his sire, Drusilla was. Angel was like his Grandsire. Also, Spike like almost everyone else in season 2, pronounces \"Angelus\" wrong. Also, the last Slayer Spike killed (Nikki Wood) didn't actually beg for her life, although that IS the kind of lie Spike would tell to Buffy to sound bigger.\n\nAnd of course the black guy dies. It's systemic in this franchise.\n\nI'll tell you what I like: \"Set 'em up. Knock 'em down,\" is a good plan. I like that Buffy is the one on the show who comes up with the plans. That's quite refreshing from when Giles used to always tell her what to do last season. But at this point, Buffy is the group leader and they view her as such. I can quibble about Joss Whedon's intentions and other messed up messages. But I can't deny how refreshing it was to do that for a young female character. It still happens rarely. I mean, you still have to tell Supergirl, Stargirl, and Batwoman where to punch. I like that it's Buffy who not only comes up with the plans, but that they actually work with little to no fuss attached.\n\nDo you know why Angel sucks? He actually offers up Xander's neck to Spike before Spike calls his bluff. Xander may hate Angel for the wrong reasons, but his hatred isn't irrational. The guy sucks.\n\nI like Spike promising to make it quick and that it wouldn't hurt and Buffy corrects him that it's going to hurt a lot.\n\nJoyce for the save at the end! It is not lost on me Spike would have actually killed Buffy without her intervention. Women!\n\nThe Mayor isn't mentioned yet at the end, but Snyder suggesting he knows the truth and is a part of the media covering it up suggests the larger conspiracy already.\n\n\"The Annoying One.\" I love that. I love that Spike actually bends his knee in supplication, before he's all like, \"Nope\" and simply kills the kid off instead. It may be the third episode of the season, rather than the first, but I think when Spike promises the audience a little less ritual and a lot more fun, the season is off to a roaring start. Great stuff is happening. ****1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Inca Mummy Girl\"\n\nI like the idea that Xander doesn't like Rodney for that time he beat him up every day for five years.\n\n\"Blah, blah, bliddy blah. I'm so stuffy. Give me a scone.\" It's like Buffy knows Giles.\n\nFirst appearance of Seth Green as Oz. Green's mustache and goatee look SO weird here.\n\nI'm a little insulting nobody figured out Impada was the Mummy. Literally every single thing she said about her backstory was a red flag to her being the actual culprit. I don't know if I want to solve a mystery being looked into by heroes this dumb.\n\nSpeaking of which, why doesn't it register with Xander that the bodyguard recognizes Impada and says \"You!\" I know he's got a thing for her, but still.\n\nFirst appearance of the Danny Strong as the very unfortunate background character Jonathan. He's pretty pathetic right off the bat.\n\nI feel like there is a scene missing in the jump cut between the scene with Giles in the library and the bodyguard immediately attacking Impada and Xander. It feels very sudden and forced and as if the scene leading up to it must have been cut for time. I guess they needed to make room for the lame Twinkie scene.\n\nThe whole \"Chosen One\" thing suggests any girl who gets called that is destined to get a raw deal. It's amazing that nobody really ever made a big deal about Impada telling the bodyguard she was in love. That seems a little quick, if you ask me.\n\nIt's SO cute that Oz is into the Eskimo.\n\nCordelia is SO mean to her exchange student. Hate that character. I like him asking if Cordelia is even from this country.\n\n\"Does it look like I'm with Xander?\" is crucial. It gives us permission to hate Impada. We needed it. Bad.\n\nI like Willow's reaction to Impada being the Mummy: \"Oh. Good.\"\n\nBuffy casually uses the slur \"gypped\" at the end of the episode which is another reason I don't like this era of television.\n\nNot feeling the episode. **1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Reptile Boy\"\n\nI like Xander, Willow, and Buffy deconstructing Bollywood musicals.\n\nBuffy isn't going to let go of Giles immediately because I'm thinking at this point he needs the lesson more than she does.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar's pout gets to you every time.\n\n\"Nothing happened last week. I was there.\" That's a good one.\n\nHow great are Angel's accurate warnings about how badly this is gonna end? \"When I kiss you, you won't wake up from a deep sleep and live happily ever after.\" \"When I kiss you I want to die.\" Seriously. What great, torpid, overly dramatic dialogue. These are things that would definitely be said by an emo vampire and a teenage girl. I've never even read Twilight but I can bet it doesn't have a line as epic and ridiculous as that. I'm sure there are epic and ridiculous lines in Twilight. But I'll bet not all at once. Buffy's greatest gift is the ability to do both at the same time, and make you believe both things at once too. I sincerely doubt Twilight pokes holes in itself as it happening.\n\n\"When I was your age, I wasn't into grown up things either.\" I hate people like that. As if Richard there is SO freaking mature for trying to get underage girls to drink so he can sacrifice them to his lizard God. The series really has an ear for despicable young men, which is kind of alarming. But I mean, that it is not a quip said by any decent person ever.\n\nBuffy is 16 going on 40 (accurate description by Willow) and knows more about adult things and responsibilities than Richard ever will. I resent that he actually made her feel bad about that.\n\nRichard coming upon Buffy passed out on the bed is creepy and horrifying. I really don't like the buttons this series is pushing with that.\n\nAngel's going to live forever and he doesn't have time for a cup of coffee? Go Willow.\n\nI personally believe the series physically body-shames and humiliates Nicholas Brendon far too much. I get he wasn't actually a teenager when this was filmed, but it still feels skeevy to play him undressed and in women's clothes for laughs.\n\nHow DOES Angel shave? I never got that bit.\n\nI like the notion with that with the Reptile dead, fortune 500 CEO's that used to pledge the frat were being raided by the FBI and financially ruined. I don't feel like Tom going to jail was as just a punishment as he deserved for what he did. The consecutive life sentences and the implosion of their elders makes me feel a little better.\n\nOne of my favorite Xander moments of all time occurs in the episode. Mostly because it's a moment played unlike any other time I've seen the moment. Including on a Joss Whedon show. But Xander is talking about what a freak Angel is, sees Angel is behind him, doesn't miss a beat, and says \"Hey, man, how you doing?\" I love that. Every other show would play the \"He's right behind me, isn't he?\" unfunny bit instead. But Xander simply doesn't care that Angel heard that. There is not much admirable about Xander Harris. But this is one of the moments where I truly liked him most.\n\nMachida is apparently played by voice actor Robin Atkin Downes. I always thought Downes was kind of handsome for a voice actor, and could be a leading man if he chose. When I thought of him in a live-action role, Reptile Boy isn't quite what I had in mind.\n\nAll right episode, but nothing special. ***.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Halloween\"\n\nI like that Hulu has the recaps at the beginning of the episode. The DVD collections are wholly inadequate for always leaving them off, and in some places, cutting them off so much they actually got rid of parts of the beginning of the episode. Buffy needs a proper DVD rerelease in the worst way. Fox's early efforts were beyond pathetic.\n\nIt's not mentioned by the other characters, but this is the first episode to explicitly prove vampires can show up on film, even if they cast no reflection. It's very interesting it isn't remarked upon here because it's kind of a big deal. And it's still consistent with stuff that is shown later. You can find set bloopers where David Boreanaz's reflection showed up on camera. But I like the idea that vampire photographing but not photographing well has been true since at least this episode.\n\nI love that Cordelia makes Angel laugh at the beginning.\n\n\"Rough day at the office.\" I love that the Slaying stuff is always referred to as \"the office\". It's just a job after all, as crazy as it is. \"Office romance\" between Buffy and Angel is funny for that reason.\n\nLarry's first appearance is wild to me. He's such a vulgar, thoughtless jerk. Which is in reality a mask. It's very interesting.\n\nI love that Vampires stay in on Halloween. Nice facet to the characters. Spike watching the Great Pumpkin in Season 6 is also great.\n\nWillow stating Cordelia is not Angel's type is inaccurate, to say the least.\n\nWhen Cordelia says that \"When it comes to dating, I'm the Slayer,\" that is a perfect distillation of Cordelia.\n\nDrusilla: \"Do you like my insides? The parts you can't see?\"\n\nSpike: \"Eyeballs to entrails, my sweet.\"\n\nI repeat: This show is great at the epic and ridiculous at the same time.\n\nEthan Rayne is an interesting character but I never felt his arc was ever properly paid off. Robin Sachs played the heck out of him, and I think it's kind of weird I never really saw him in anything else but this show (at least on this side of the pond).\n\nBuffy, Lady of Buff and Duchess of Buffonia. Love that line.\n\nOz's scene with Cordelia was funny as was his meet/cute with Willow as the ghost. Who is that girl?\n\nToothbrushes. Mrs. Davis must be stopped. Show has its priorities right about that.\n\nBuffy instantly fainting shows what a disadvantage the heroes have going in. Ethan does not play fair.\n\nIs this woman insane? She's never seen a car. Sgt. Rock is taking a lot on faith here.\n\nI like that Spike thinks this is just neat.\n\nGiles is flipped out the exact proper amount at seeing Willow walk through a wall.\n\nMajor Plothole: How did the Vampire get into Buffy's house without being invited in? What really bugs me most is that it's SO huge of a plot-point and this is literally the first time I've noticed it. How dumb am I?\n\nBeating up that pirate gave Sgt. Rock a weird sense of closure.\n\nI STILL think \"Ripper\" sounds like a weird nickname for Giles.\n\nEthan saying he knows who Giles is and what he's capable is juicy, but I still don't think it was ever paid off properly. After seven seasons and three or four appearances by the character, I still never even slightly understood the motivation for Ethan Rayne.\n\nGiles beating the poo out of him is what is known as a good start.\n\n\"Hi, Honey, I'm home.\" It's a well-worn line for a reason. I kind of want to cheer that moment.\n\nOminous ending. Not too many episodes black out on a close-up shot of Giles' face.\n\nThere were interesting elements but I didn't feel the episode was too strong as a whole. Things didn't feel quite cohesive to me. ***1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"Lie To Me\"\n\nCordelia sympathizing with Marie Antoinette is why I don't like Cordelia.\n\nI like Xander telling Ford he'd only be imposing in the literal sense.\n\n\"Oh, THAT'S what that song is about?\" I love Willow.\n\nFord isn't wrong. Angel is older and has cold hands.\n\nI like the expression on Xander's face after Willow tells him he made Angel do that thing where he's gone. He don't care.\n\nWillow's bedroom door opens directly outside? I have never seen a bedroom door operate like that.\n\nAngel talking about honing his brooding skills isn't actually funny, but it's a progression because it's the first time he's been allowed to make a joke.\n\nChanterelle as seen here (later to become Anne Steele on Angel) has one of the most surprisingly solid arcs of the entire franchise. And she appears for a total of four or five times. But the progression we've seen from her each time is pretty impressive, especially considering the naive wallflower she is here.\n\nFord saying every teen should be allowed to die young and stay pretty is sort of a funny joke in a show with vampires but it's also not true to life for most teenagers who consider themselves unattractive. It never occurs to Ford that other people his age might value different things.\n\nI like Giles worrying Buffy is compromising her secret identity to impress cute boys.\n\nI like Angel telling Xander to stop calling him \"Dead Boy\".\n\nThe dude being dressed exactly like Angel sort of undercuts his entire rant against these kids.\n\nSpike is a bad, rude man. I like how he dotes on Drusilla after she starts whimpering about being told the bird is dead. It's very funny.\n\n\"I've known you for two minutes and I can't stand you. I don't really feature you living forever.\" This is one of my favorite Spike lines of all time, and one of the best Buffyverse lines ever. And after Ford actually brow-beats him into doing the lame 30 seconds line, I feel and understand Spike's disgust at the kid. He's super annoying. I don't see what Buffy sees in him.\n\nAngel and Willow's is a forbidden love.\n\nAngel's story of what he did to Drusilla is horrifying. But he's still underselling the deliberate cruelty behind it. Buffy is unfortunately going to have to learn about Angelus for herself.\n\nI like that the threat to Drusilla is enough to make Spike back down completely. That's an interesting thing about Spike.\n\nAlso interesting that he actually comes through with his bargain with Ford. What's interesting is that if he had doublecrossed him I actually wouldn't have blamed him.\n\nI don't actually sympathize or feel sorry for Ford having brain cancer. He's made some pretty deliberate choices that dying gives him no actual excuse for.\n\nIt was an interesting episode but I think I gave it more credit back in the day than it was actually due. ***1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"The Dark Age\"\n\nI like that Buffy thinks Giles's diapers were tweed.\n\nI don't think Slayer missions should involve protecting blood banks from vampires. At least they aren't killing live people. And if we have to stake every vampire who stole blood from hospitals we'd have to go after Angel in season one.\n\nI like Nicholas Brendan's line reading on \"Extra class AND Cordelia? Mix in a little rectal surgery and it's my best day ever!\"\n\nFist mention of Xander's Uncle Rory who we'll meet in Season 6.\n\nI like when Buffy accuses Ethan of selling her that dress at Halloween and nearly getting them all killed he says, \"But you looked great.\" WHAM!\n\nIt's interesting that when the zombie guy escapes the cage Xander immediately moves to protect Cordelia.\n\nXander asks if him feeling pretty good about digging through Giles' files makes him a sociopath. I'm guessing yes.\n\nI like the black and white photo of Anthony Stewart Head with the long hair, leather jacket, and guitar.\n\n\"Don't be sorry, be Giles.\" I like that. I also like Head's line reading on not knowing how to stop Euygon without killing Jenny.\n\n\"We're sorry./ \"We'll be good.\" I like that Willow just scared Cordelia and Xander with her authority.\n\nAngel throttling Miss Calendar here has unpleasant implications later on.\n\nI like that Jenny is a bit cold to Giles after all that. I don't blame her one bit.\n\nI like that Giles likes the Bay City Rollers.\n\nDecent episode. ***1/2.\n\nBuffy The Vampire Slayer \"What's My Line? Part 1\"\n\nAs far as mysteries go, the first part is well-constructed. I suppose that's easier to do in a two-part episode rather than a season arc, but Buffy has whiffed short mysteries in the past and will again.\n\nMr. Pfister the worm guy is suitably creepy, but I thought the same thing about the coroner on Picket Fences, and they are the exact same guy.\n\nThe cliffhanger is great. It's a bit of a cliche that Kendra and Buffy get into a fight when they first meet, but at least the show put in the legwork of making the audience see Kendra's suspicions seem entirely justified just based on what she saw.\n\nI totally forgot Willy the Snitch existed until I saw this episode again just now. I love that character and I forgot I loved him.\n\nDalton the learned vampire is another minor character I'd forgotten, but I think he would have been better served taking off after the events of this episode. He is not cut out to play in the big leagues, and every second he's around Spike and Dru is another that ticks on his mortal clock. NOT as smart as advertised.\n\nI often forget that just because Oz does poorly in school, that his aptitude is high, and he is not actually stupid. I also liked him deadpanning that Buffy was a \"Tense girl\". Mr. Wears-A-Bowling-Shirt-Everywhere-Before-Wearing-Bowling-Shirts-Was-Cool has always been a master of understatement. I also love that he's the kind of guy who takes things like that in stride.\n\nWhat does \"Don't warn the tadpoles!\" actually mean? Willow using \"Frog fears\" as an explanation is entirely unhelpful.\n\nI like Giles' yelling at Xander for joking around when the situation was so serious. He doesn't do that often which lets you know it IS serious.\n\nBuffy's paranoia in the hallway was great. Giles worrying he might have been TOO alarming later on is the wrong mindset. Willow was right that it was good she took him seriously.\n\nBuffy just killed a Superbowl Champ? Great laugh-line. I also should point out that that guy seemed to me to be human, and supposedly against the Slayer code to kill. Faith gets nothing but grief for it later on, although admittedly a large part of that is probably her sociopathic reaction to it.\n\nXander calling Cordelia \"transportation\" in the way he did was really dirty and low-class, but I DID like him describing her as his witless foil.\n\nMy favorite Xander moment in the episode, and I think it's my favorite thing in the episode, is something that either brushed by me before now, or I simply wasn't mature enough to appreciate how great it was. I love after Snyder says this horrible thing about Xander being a waste of space, (nothing any adult has any business telling any kid, especially one under their care,) I love that Xander's response is to thank him for being honest with him. And that he hopes someday that he's in a position to be equally honest with him. I love that. It's unfair that Snyder can say something like that to Xander, but if Xander says something horrible back, he'll get in trouble. I like the moment because it points out the unfair power dynamic a lot of adults have with kids, and also shows the true thing that many adults abuse that dynamic to air their petty grievances on people unallowed to call them on it. Because the cruel adults know if they spoke that way to people their own age, they'd get reamed for it. I think a large part of the show uses Snyder and some of the miserable adults the kids encounter in the first three seasons to pander to its core audience a bit. But it's not like this specific unfair thing is untrue, or something teens watching this don't have to put up with themselves. Good for the show. Pandering or not, it's true and unfair that small men like Snyder take out their frustrations over their miserable lots in life with people not permitted to fight back. It's in"
