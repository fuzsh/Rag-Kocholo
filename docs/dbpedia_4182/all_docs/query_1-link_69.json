Macdonald's tenure in office spanned 18 years, making him the second longest serving Prime Minister of Canada. He is the only Canadian Prime Minister to win six majority governments. He was the major proponent of a national railway, the Canadian Pacific Railway, completed in 1885, linking Canada from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. He won praise for having helped forge a nation of sprawling geographic size, with two diverse European colonial origins, numerous Aboriginal nations, and a multiplicity of cultural backgrounds and political views.\n\nQueen Victoria knighted John A. Macdonald for playing an integral role in bringing about Confederation. His appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George was announced at the birth of the Dominion, July 1, 1867. An election was held in August which put Macdonald and his Conservative party into power.\n\nhttp://www.glasel.org/gopherhole/JaMAC.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: ninny\n\nThe Word of the day...Crest\n\n*\n\nThe crest of a hill or a wave is the top of it.\n\no\n\nIf you say that you are on the crest of a wave, you mean that you are feeling very happy and confident because things are going well for you.\n\n+\n\nThe band are riding on the crest of a wave with the worldwide success of their number-one-selling single.\n\n*\n\nWhen someone crests a hill, they reach the top of it.\n\no\n\nThe first wave of marchers crested the hill.\n\n*\n\nA bird's crest is a group of upright feathers on the top of its head.\n\no\n\nBoth birds had a dark blue crest.\n\n*\n\nA crest is a design that is the symbol of a noble family, a town, or an organization.\n\no\n\nOn the wall is the family crest.\n\nhttp://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a214/godskronos/badgerobertson.jpg\n\nhttp://i658.photobucket.com/albums/uu310/danstiles/familycrest.jpg\n\nhttp://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h171/razzman68/IM003788.jpg\n\nhttp://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z235/MrSlim843/Picture011.png\n\nhttp://i565.photobucket.com/albums/ss95/jcalexand3/Evolution/StanfordCrest.jpg\n\nhttp://i872.photobucket.com/albums/ab281/Jessee2010/needlework_hog4houses_ravcrest5_tb_.gif\n\nhttp://i145.photobucket.com/albums/r225/drjenniferperkins/Catholic/ocd4-Copy.jpg\n\nhttp://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y252/CGreypaw/Florida%20Vacation%20Photos/Vaughan.jpg\n\nhttp://i897.photobucket.com/albums/ac180/fran1981/2006%20In%20a%20Snapshot/c209.jpg\n\nhttp://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q41/fredsjeep/GHFC%2012-09%20Hauser%20Geode%20Beds/_MG_3351.jpg\n\nhttp://i379.photobucket.com/albums/oo238/ladycrest4/009.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: Howard\n\nDon't forget The toothpaste Crest. ;)\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: Womble\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Qzd9HIsRWeA/RwpmilbEugI/AAAAAAAABfY/P-eden9-rY8/s400/Rod+Taylor.jpghttp://www.richardsimpkin.com.au/Australian-Legends/ROD-TAYLOR.jpg\n\nRod Taylor then and Rod Taylor now.

On 25 August 1875 he swam from Dover to Calais in less than 22 hours.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nHe was born at Dawley in Shropshire, one of twelve children of a Coalbrookdale doctor. He joined the merchant navy and served a three-year apprenticeship with Rathbone Brothers of Liverpool.\n\nWhilst serving as second mate on the Cunard Line ship Russia, travelling from New York to Liverpool, he attempted to rescue a man overboard by diving into the sea in the mid-Atlantic. The man was never found, but Webb's daring won him an award of £100 and the Stanhope Medal, and made him a hero of the British press.\n\nEnglish Channel swimming record\n\nIn 1873 Webb was serving as captain of the steamship Emerald when he read an account of the failed attempt by J. B. Johnson to swim the English Channel. He became inspired to try himself, and left his job to begin training, first at Lambeth Baths, then in the cold waters of the Thames and the English Channel.\n\nOn 12 August 1875 he made his first cross-Channel swimming attempt, but strong winds and poor sea conditions forced him to abandon the swim.\n\nOn 24 August 1875 he began a second swim by diving in from the Admiralty Pier at Dover. Backed by three chase boats and smeared in porpoise oil, he set off into the ebb tide at a steady breaststroke. Despite stings from jellyfish and strong currents off Cap Gris Nez which prevented him reaching the shore for five hours, finally, after 21 hours and 45 minutes, he landed near Calais—the first successful cross-channel swim. His zig-zag course across the Channel was over 39 miles (64 km) long.\n\nLater life\n\nAfter his record swim Captain Webb basked in national and international adulation, and followed a career as a professional swimmer. He licensed his name for merchandising such as commemorative pottery, and wrote a book called The Art of Swimming. A brand of matches was named after him. He participated in exhibition swimming matches and stunts such as floating in a tank of water for 128 hours.\n\nOn 27 April 1880 he married Madeline Kate Chaddock, and they had two children, Matthew and Helen.\n\nHis final stunt was to be a dangerous swim through the Whirlpool Rapids below Niagara Falls, a feat many observers considered suicidal. Although Webb failed in an attempt at raising interest in funding the event, on 24 July 1883 he jumped into the river from a small boat located near the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge and began his swim. Accounts of the time indicate that in all likelihood Webb successfully survived the first part of the swim, but died in the section of the river located near the entrance to the whirlpool. Webb was interred in Oakwood Cemetery, Niagara Falls, New York.\n\nIn 1909, Webb's elder brother Thomas unveiled a memorial in Dawley.

During World War II, Hill was one of the students evacuated with the school to Bournemouth School, East Way, Bournemouth. After leaving Bournemouth School, Hill worked variously as a milkman in Eastleigh, a bridge operator, a driver and a drummer before he finally got a foot in the door of the entertainment industry by becoming an assistant stage manager. Inspired by the 'star comedians' of British music hall shows, Hill set out to make his mark in show business. For the stage, he changed his first name to 'Benny', in homage to his favourite comedian, Jack Benny. Hill began appearing at working men's clubs and Masonic dinners before graduating to nightclub and theatre jobs. Hill auditioned for Soho's famed Windmill Theatre (home of Revudeville, a popular show of singers, comedians and nude girls), but he was not hired. Benny's first job in professional theatre as a performer was as Reg Varney's straight man, beating a then unknown Peter Sellers for the role.\n\nPrivate life\n\nHill had only a few friends, although colleagues insist he was never lonely but content with his own company. He never married, although he did propose to three women—one the daughter of a British writer—but was rejected by all three. Although he owned the family home in Southampton he never owned his own home in London, nor a car, preferring to rent, first a large double apartment in Queensgate, London, for 26 years until 1986, and then a small flat in Teddington, within walking distance of the studios of Thames Television where he taped his shows. His mother died in 1976 aged 82 and Benny kept the family house at 22 Westrow Gardens in Southampton as a shrine to her, not changing anything. Before his move to Teddington, whilst looking for somewhere else to live in the Richmond area of London, he lived at 22 Westrow Gardens. Travelling was the luxury he permitted himself. Hill became a first-degree Francophile, enjoying frequent visits to Marseille. Until the 1980s, he could enjoy anonymity in France's outdoor cafés, public transport, and socialising with local women. Besides mastering French, he could also speak enough German, Dutch and Italian for travel purposes. Hill's overseas holidays were often gathering missions for comedy material, some inspired by foreign surroundings, or borrowed from regional acts.\n\nEarly career\n\nBetween the end of the war and the dawn of television, Hill worked as a radio performer. His first appearance on television was in 1949 in Hi There. He continued to work intermittently until his career took off with The Benny Hill Show in 1955 on BBC Television. Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included Patricia Hayes, Jeremy Hawk, Peter Vernon, Ronnie Brody, and his co-writer from the mid-1950s to early 1960s, Dave Freeman. He remained mostly with the BBC through to 1968, except for a few sojourns with ITV station ATV between 1957 and 1960 and again in 1967. He also had a short-lived radio programme, Benny Hill Time, on BBC Radio's Light Programme from 1964 to 1966. In addition, he attempted a sitcom anthology, Benny Hill, which ran for three series from 1962 to 1963, in which he played a different character in each episode. In 1964, he played Nick Bottom in an all-star TV film production of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.\n\nFilms and recordings\n\nBenny Hill's film credits include parts in nine films including Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965); Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), in which he played the relatively straight role of the Toymaker; The Italian Job (1969); and, finally, a clip-show film spin-off of his early Thames shows (1969–73), called The Best of Benny Hill (1974). Hill's audio recordings include \"Gather in the Mushrooms\", (1961), \"Pepys Diary\", (1961), \"Transistor Radio\" (1961), \"Harvest of Love\" (1963), and \"Ernie (The Fastest Milkman In The West)\" (1971). He also appeared in the 1986 video of the song \"Anything She Does\" by the band Genesis. Hill's song, \"Ernie (The Fastest Milkman In The West),\" on the Best of Benny Hill album made the UK chart as Christmas number one single in 1971. A link to the lyrics is provided in the External Links section of this article.\n\nThe Benny Hill Show\n\nIn 1969, his show moved from the BBC to Thames Television, where The Benny Hill Show remained until cancellation in 1989, with an erratic schedule of one-hour specials.\n\nThe most common running gag in Benny Hill's shows was the closing sequence, which was literally a \"running gag\" in that it featured various members of the cast chasing Benny Hill and usually featured scantily-clad women as part of the chase, along with other stock comedy characters such as policemen, vicars, old ladies, and so on. This was commonly filmed using stop motion and time-lapse techniques for comic effect, and included other comic devices such as characters running off one side of the screen and reappearing running on from the other. The tune used in all the chases, \"Yaketty Sax\", is commonly referred to as \"The Benny Hill Theme\". It has been used as a form of parody in many ways by television shows and a small number of films. The Wachowskis used the same style (and musical theme) in a scene in the film V for Vendetta (2006). It also appears in the cult movie The Gods Must Be Crazy.\n\nReflecting opinion of the time within certain quarters the 1980s alternative comedian Ben Elton denounced him as a \"dirty old man, tearing the clothes off nubile girls\". The Independent newspaper opined the vendetta was \"like watching an elderly uncle being kicked to death by young thugs\". Elton later claimed his comment was taken out of context.\n\nIn response to such claims his close friend and producer Dennis Kirkland said it was the women who chased Hill in anger for undressing them, all of which was done accidentally by some ridiculous means. An article on 27 May 2006 in The Independent quoted Hill and Dennis Kirkland as saying they believed this misrepresentation demonstrated critics could not have watched his programmes.\n\nIn a documentary on Benny Hill, the former head of entertainment at Thames TV who had cancelled the show, John Howard Davies, stated there were three reasons why he did so: \"...the audiences were going down, the programme was costing a vast amount of money, and he (Benny) was looking tired.\" Benny was devastated by the loss of his show.\n\nUS producer Don Taffner heard of Benny's plight and in 1991 produced a new show complete with Benny and his usual team, called Benny Hill's World Tour.\n\nDeath\n\nHill's health began to decline in the mid 1980s. He suffered heart problems, and on 11 February 1992, doctors told him he needed to lose 2 stone of his 17 stone body and recommended a heart bypass. He declined and was diagnosed a week later with renal failure. Benny Hill died on or about 19 April 1992, Easter weekend, alone in his flat at 7 Fairwater House, Twickenham Road, Teddington, South West London, at the age of 68. On 21 April, neighbours called the police, who then found Hill, deceased, sitting in his armchair in front of the television. Ironically on the day Hill purportedly died, a new contract arrived in the post from Central Independent Television. He died of natural causes. His death nearly coincided with that of Frankie Howerd, who had died at the age of 75, on 18 April 1992, only one day before Hill's death.\n\nHill was buried at Hollybrook Cemetery near his birthplace in Southampton on 28 April, 1992. In October 1992, following rumours that he was buried with large amounts of gold jewellery, an attempt was made by thieves to exhume his body. However, when authorities looked into his open coffin the following morning, there was no treasure. Consequently, only the culprits or the first officer on the scene know whether anything valuable was inside. Hill was reburied with a new coffin lid and a solid slab across the top of the grave.\n\nIn Hill's will, he left his estimated £10 million (GBP) estate to his late parents. Next in line were his brother Leonard and sister Diana, both of whom were also dead. This left his seven nieces and nephews, among whom the money was divided.\n\nhttp://www.mjukvara.se/blogg/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Benny-Hill.jpg\n\nhttp://www.virginmedia.com/images/funny_songs_benny_hill.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: ninny\n\nThe word of the day...Tourist\n\nA tourist is a person who is visiting a place for pleasure and interest, especially when they are on holiday.\n\nhttp://i380.photobucket.com/albums/oo245/jodwurz/Animals%20for%20Game%20Room/200px-The_accidental_tourist1988.jpg\n\nhttp://i740.photobucket.com/albums/xx44/meaghanmaher/roma%20part%201/IMG_0071.jpg\n\nhttp://i895.photobucket.com/albums/ac154/BaileyLeigh88/Colorado%202008/36.jpg\n\nhttp://i874.photobucket.com/albums/ab307/drew_thompson/DSC00496.jpg\n\nhttp://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee153/LostWendy/DigitalCamera4012.jpg\n\nhttp://i257.photobucket.com/albums/hh205/niseskills/Tourist.jpg\n\nhttp://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww306/lengtarang/tourist.jpg\n\nhttp://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c5/vcdepmkg/tourist.jpg\n\nhttp://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j308/guardiansangel1713/tourist.jpg\n\nhttp://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n88/debzgirl/tourist.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: ninny\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VscVP_Gt_s&feature=related#\n\nPeggy Lee..Is That All There Is\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYxoAJ3Boyc&feature=related#\n\nPeggy Lee ..Fever\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: Frank\n\nCanadian person of the day: Mike Bossy\n\nhttp://www.lessignets.com/signetsdiane/calendrier/images/oct/24/3/mike-bossy--with-stanley-cup3.jpg\n\nMichael Dean Bossy (born January 22, 1957 in Montreal, Quebec) is a former Canadian ice hockey player who played for the New York Islanders for his entire career and was part of their four-year reign as Stanley Cup champions in the early 1980s. Known for his powerful shot, he was among the league's goal scoring leaders and considered one of the greatest bona-fide snipers of the game. His career was cut short by injuries.\n\nhttp://i.cdn.turner.com/sivault/si_online/covers/images/1984/0514_large.jpg\n\nBossy scored a then-record 53 goals as a rookie in the 1977–78 season, won the Calder Trophy for rookie of the year, and was named a Second Team All-Star. In 1980–81, Bossy scored 50 goals in the first 50 games of the season, the first to do so since the great Maurice Richard thirty-six years earlier. Richard was on hand to congratulate Bossy for achieving that milestone.\n\nIn the 1980–81 NHL season, he scored 50 goals in the first 50 games of the season. He also recorded nine hat tricks that season, establishing an NHL-record (broken by Gretzky in 1981–82 with 10). Bossy also set a record for goals in a season and playoffs combined with a total of 85, breaking Reggie Leach's record of 80 in 1975-76. In 1982, Bossy set scoring records for right-wingers with 83 assists and 147 points in 80 games. These would stand until the 1995–96 season when Jaromir Jagr broke both records with 87 assists and 149 points, in what was an 82-game schedule.\n\nBossy earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP in 1982, and scored 17 goals in three straight playoffs -- 1981, 1982, and 1983 -- the only player ever to do so. In reaching the Stanley Cup Finals five times, between 1980 and 1984, Bossy scored 69 goals. By contrast, in Gretzky's five Stanley Cup Finals playoffs during his peak years with the Edmonton Oilers, he scored 59 goals.\n\nHe was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1991. His #22 jersey was retired by the Islanders on March 3, 1992. In 1998, he was ranked number 20 on The Hockey News' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, despite having an injury-shortened career.\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: ninny\n\nThanks Phil & Frank for those 2 great bios.

He is generally regarded as the best player in the history of the NHL,and has been called \"the greatest hockey player ever\" by many sportswriters, players, and coaches. Upon his retirement on April 18, 1999, he held forty regular-season records, fifteen playoff records, and six All-Star records. He is the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season—a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100 points in 15 WHA/NHL seasons, 14 of them consecutive. Gretzky's jersey number, 99, has been retired by all teams in the National Hockey League.\n\nWayne Gretzky held or shared 61 NHL records upon his retirement on April 18, 1999, including 40 regular season records, 15 playoff records, and 6 all-star records.\n\nhttp://fearandarrogance.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/wayne-gretzky-si-cover.jpg\n\nThe regular season records include most goals in a season (92), most assists in a season (163), and most points in a season (215). He also holds the record for the fastest 50 goals, accomplishing that feat in only 39 games and the record for most goals in a 50 game period (61, which he accomplished twice). In 1983–84, he had a 51-game point-scoring streak that has been compared to \"Joltin' Joe\" DiMaggio's streak in baseball, during which he averaged exactly three points per game, scoring 61 goals and 92 assists for 153 points.\n\nGretzky set impressive records in both regular season and post-season play, holding the record for most career regular season goals (894), assists (1,963), points (2,857), and hat tricks (50). The next closest player in total points for the regular season is Mark Messier at 1,887. Gretzky's point total including regular season and playoffs stands at an imposing 3,239. Gretzky also had more career assists than any other player has ever gained total points.\n\nHis 47 playoff points in 1985 and 31 assists in 1988 are still records for a single post-season round, and he holds the record for career playoff goals (122), assists (260), points (382), hat tricks (10), and game winning goals (24).\n\nhttp://scrapetv.com/News/News%20Pages/Sports/images-2/wayne-gretzky-edmonton-oilers.jpg\n\nhttp://www.visiontech-usa.org/2009/Hayden/image006.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: ninny\n\nThe word of the day...Fish\n\nA fish is a creature that lives in water and has a tail and fins.

His maternal grandfather was Wahunsunacock, the chief of Powhatan tribe in Virgina. After growing up in England, he married Elizabeth Washington on 13 September 1632, at the St James's Church in Clerkenwell, London. Their daughter Anne was born in 1633. Elizabeth died shortly after Anne’s birth, and in 1635 Rolfe returned to Virginia, leaving his daughter with his cousin, Anthony Rolfe. In 1659, Anne Rolfe married Peter Elwin (1623-1695), of Thurning, Norfolk, England, and left descendants.\n\nRolfe became a powerful leader in the tribe his grandfather had led. During this time, he met and married Jane Poythress. He served in the English military until 1675. His only child by his second wife, called Jane Rolfe, was born on October 10, 1650, and in 1675 married Colonel Robert Bolling and herself had two children, John Bolling (born January 26, 1676) and Rebecca Bolling. Many Americans claim descent from Rolfe, including some politicians. In 1675, Rolfe died at the age of 59 or 60, and was survived by his wife and child. Rolfe is buried in Hopewell's Kippax Plantation.\n\nAs a result of Thomas Rolfe's birth, the Rolfe family is considered one of the First Families of Virginia. He appears as an infant in the 2005 theatrical film The New World, but does not exist in the 1998 Disney animated straight-to-video film Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World, a sequel to the 1995 motion picture.\n\nhttp://richmondthenandnow.com/Images/Articles/Pocahontas.jpg\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: ninny\n\nThe word of the day...Groovy\n\nIf you describe something as groovy, you mean that it is attractive, fashionable, or exciting.\n\nhttp://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i38/kevy_nova/087StJmGtDavDur.jpg\n\nhttp://i93.photobucket.com/albums/l50/naty199/Annia%20Vermont/anniagroovy.png\n\nhttp://i938.photobucket.com/albums/ad221/sereejolynne/graphic%20sheets%20bottlecaps%20dogtags%20tiles%20dominos/groovybcetsy.jpg\n\nhttp://i787.photobucket.com/albums/yy160/janemckenzie/Best%20of%20South%20America/IMG_1403.jpg\n\nhttp://i936.photobucket.com/albums/ad201/HippieChick1981/Groovy%20Psychedellics/psion005-abstract-digital-art-fract.jpg\n\nhttp://i981.photobucket.com/albums/ae292/cherishscloset/custom%20casualwears/DSC_0271.jpg\n\nhttp://i656.photobucket.com/albums/uu288/sewmesane/For%20Sale%20Wovens%20Flannels%20Misc/DSC02803.jpg\n\nhttp://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee242/lientecada/groovy.gif\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: Womble\n\nGreat bio's, Ninny.
