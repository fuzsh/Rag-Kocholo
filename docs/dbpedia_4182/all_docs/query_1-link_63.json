The notable passings include The Gipper (Ronald Reagan), The Godfather (Marlon Brando), and Superman (Christopher Reeve). Reagan, who went from Hollywood star to President of the United States, died after a long illness during the year. Brando, who transformed Hollywood with his masterful performances in the 1950s and won an Oscar two decades later for his comeback role of Vito Corleone also passed on. Brando, who had played Kryptonian scientist Jor-El in the 1979 film Superman, shortly preceded in death the courageous young man who had starred as the Man of Steel, Christopher Reeve. His near fatal horse riding accident a decade earlier had left him paralyzed, but he had proven himself a hero both on and off the screen with his tireless effort in favor of medical research. The baby boomers also lost a childhood television icon with the passing of Captain Kangaroo — Bob Keeshan, and those slightly older lost a late night fixture in Tonight show host Jack Paar. Legendary singer Ray Charles’ death came shortly before the release of an acclaimed film about his life, and comic Rodney Dangerfield deserves our respect for his years of making audiences laugh. King Kong’s paramour, the lovely Fay Wray, and Artie Shaw, the last of the Big Band leader, join tap-dancing queen Ann Miller, Oscar-winning British actor\n\nPeter Ustinov, comic legend Alan King, French chef Julia Child, and Psycho shower victim Janet Leigh in this year’s volume. Whether he was Felix Unger or Dr. Lao, Tony Randall never failed to entertain, and Alistair Cooke added dignity to the small screen with his many years of hosting Masterpiece Theatre. They join Law and Order’s Lennie Briscoe ( Jerry Orbach), The Jeffersons’ Isabel Sanford, Dead End Kid Bernard Punsley, Mercury Astronaut L. Gordon Cooper, Murphy Brown’s Eldin (Robert Pastorelli), Buffalo Springfield guitarist Bruce Palmer, Superfly Ron O’Neal, Oscar-winner Mercedes McCambridge, The Blob director Irwin Yeaworth, Jan and Dean’s Jan Berry, Captive Wild Woman Acquanetta, Doobie Brother Cornelius Bumpus, Munchkin Tiny Doll, bodybuilding legend Joe Gold, funkmeister Rick James, Broadway star Howard Keel, country singing sensation Skeeter Davis, and Rockin’ Granny Cordell Jackson in the list of ones we’ve lost. John F. Kennedy’s biographer — William Manchester, press secretary — Pierre Salinger, and comic imitator — Vaughn Meader, all passed away during the year. Dorothy Hart, who was Jane to Lex Barker’s Tarzan, and Eleanor Holm who leading lady to Glenn Morris’ Tarzan are also found within these pages. They join James Bond villain Tee Hee — Julius Harris and Hercules’ television mom — Liddy Holloway, along with other notables including Cabaret lyricist Fred Ebb and Cabaret’s Max, Helmut Griem, Space\n\n1\n\nIntroduction Patrol star Ed Kemmer, game show host Art James, UFO abductee Betty Hill, Hawaii Five O’s Kono — Zulu, Disney animator Frank Thomas, Blair Witch Project’s ground-breaking cinematographer Neil Fredericks, and Noriaki Yuasa, director of the Japanese film series starring Gammera, the giant flying turtle. The world of opera lost legends Robert Merrill and Renata Tebaldi, and ballet’s loses include Dame Alicia Markova and Ludmilla Tcherina. Sexploitation director Rene Meyer and schlockmeister Larry Buchanan, are joined in death with cult film leading lady Katherine Victor and Playboy Playmates Donna Michelle and June Cochran. Famous families are also represented with the passing of John Barrymore’s son John Drew, Kirk Douglas’ son Eric, Bing Crosby’s son Philip, Bob Hope’s son Tony, and Doris Day’s son Terry Melcher. Other passings include Frances Dee, who, in the 1940s, Walked with a Zombie, and Paul Atkinson, who rocked with The Zombies in the 1960s. Some met violent ends during the year. Pantera’s rock guitarist Dimebag Darrell was shot to death during a performance, actor and essayist Spaulding Gray drowned in a suicide plunge from a New York Ferry, Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh was gunned down in the streets of Denmark, and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein scripter Robert Lees was decapitated by a deranged intruder who then carried his head to a neighbor’s home. The ranks of film composers were hard hit during the year with the loss of Elmer Bernstein, Jerry Goldsmith, Carlo Rustichelli, David Raksin, Piero Piccioni, Gil Melle, and Fred Karlin. The list of celebrity photographers was also thinned with the passings of Helmut Newton, Richard Avedon, Francesco Scavullo, Carl Mydens, and Henri-Cartier Bresson. The world of Superman also lost radio actor Jackson Beck, who intoned the familiar phrase “It’s a bird… It’s a plane… It’s Superman!,” and Danny Dark, who lent his voice to the Man of Steel in the animated Super Friends cartoons. Longtime DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz also died, as did Harry Lampert, artist and cocreator of the Golden Age Flash and Bob\n\n2 Hamm, creator of the Silver Age Teen Titans and Doom Patrol. December Bride’s Matt and Ruth Henshaw (Dean Miller and Frances Rafferty) both died during the year, as did Babylon 5’s Dr. Franklin (Richard Biggs) and Zathras (Tim Choate). Among the athletes found in this volume are football star Elroy “Crazy Legs” Hirsch and Reggie White, and pro wrestlers The Big Bossman, Pepper Gomez and Hercules Hernandez. Palmolive’s Madge the Manicurist ( Jan Miner), Broadway’s Lion King ( Jason Raize), the voice of Cousin Itt (Tony Magro) and the voice of Deputy Dawg (Dayton Allen), General Hospital’s Lila Quartermaine (Anna Lee), Doctor Who villain The Master (Anthony Ainley), Dark Shadows’ Don Briscoe, and reality television producer MaryEllen Bunim also died in 2004. The literary world lost author and essayist Susan Sontag, along with the writers of Bonjour Trieste (Francoise Sagan), The Far Pavilions (M.M. Kaye), Day of the Dolphin (Robert Merle), Fail-Safe (Harvey Wheeler), The Ruling Class (Peter Barnes), Airport (Arthur Hailey), Inherit the Wind ( Jerome Lawrence), and horror novelist Hugh B. Cave. The music scene also lost rock singer Laura Branigan, jazz drummer Elvin Jones, the New York Doll’s Arthur “Killer” Kane, The Ramones’ Johnny Ramone, and Wu Tang Clan rapper Old Dirty Bastard. Other notable passings include Jerry Scoggins, who sang the unforgettable theme to The Beverly Hillbillies, June Taylor, who led the June Taylor Dancers on The Jackie Gleason Show, On Death and Dying psychologist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, The Haunting scriptwriter Nelson Gidding, Guinness Book of Records co-creator Norris McWhirter, Amicus horror film producer Max Rosenberg, Indiana Jones stuntman Pat Roach, and Alexandra Ripley, author of the Gone with the Wind sequel, Scarlett. Also joining the death roll of 2004 were numerous other familiar faces from films and television including leading actors Richard Ney and Paul Winfield, child star Sammy McKim, leading ladies Irene Manning, Peggy Ryan, Barbara Whiting, Maria Perschy, Laura Betti, Caitlin Clarke, Marion Shilling, Carrie Snodgress, Jan\n\n3 Sterling, Uta Hagen, Suzanne Kaaren, and Virginia Grey, and character performers Buck Flower, Lu Leonard, J. Edward McKinley, Eugene Roche, John Randolph, Peter Blythe, Lynn Cartwright, Doris Dowling, Joe Viterelli, Noble Willingham, Peter Woodthorpe, Sam Edwards, Carl Esmond, Tommy Farrell, Paul “Mousie” Garner, H.B. Haggerty, Lincoln Kilpatrick and Robert Lang. This book provides a single source that notes the deaths of all major, and many minor, figures in the fields of film, television, cartoons, theatre, music and popular literature. The obituaries within this volume contain pertinent details of deaths including date, place and cause, of 842 celebrities. Biographical information and career highlights and achievements are also provided. I have also included a complete-as-possible filmography for film and television performers. Most obituaries are followed by citations to major newspapers and periodical stories reporting the death. A photograph has been included for many of the individuals. I have been writing obituaries of film personalities for over twenty years, beginning with a column in Forry Ackerman’s Famous Monsters\n\nIntroduction of Filmland in the late 1970s. Many of the film obituaries in the work are taken from my monthly column in Classic Images (P.O. Box 809, Muscatine, IA 52761), a newspaper devoted to classic films and their performers. Information on the passing of the individuals found in this volume has been gathered from a myriad of sources. Primary sources, as previously noted are listed in the individual bibliographies, including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Times (of London), The Washington Post, Variety, Time, People, TV Guide and Newsweek. Other sources include Boyd Mager’s Western Clippings, The Memphis Commercial Appeal, The Hollywood Reporter, The (Manchester) Guardian, The Comics Buyer’s Guide, Locus, Pro Wrestling Torch, Psychotronic Video, The Comics Journal and Facts on File. Several sources on the internet have also been helpful, including Celebrity Obits (http://www/voy.com/60649/), Life in Legacy (formerlly Famous Deaths — Week in Review) (http://www.lifeinlegacy.com/), Entertainment Insiders (http://www.einsiders.com/features/ columns/2003obituaries), and the Internet Movie Database, Ltd.
