        "text": "Images\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\nPlay the video of the Motown group the Temptations singing “My Girl” and discuss:\n\nWhat do you notice about the way the group’s act is staged? How are they dressed? How do they move? Does their performance seem planned out or spontaneous?\n\nWhat kinds of things would the group have to rehearse in order to prepare a performance such as this one? What might be difficult or challenging for the group?\n\nDo you imagine that the Temptations had help preparing their performance? If so, who do you think might have assisted them?\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Show students the photo of Motown’s “Hitsville, U.S.A.” studio. Explain to students that the Motown Recording Corporation was founded in this house in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959 by Berry Gordy Jr. It would go on to become one of the largest and best known record companies owned and operated by an African American, and it helped many black musicians start successful careers. The company produced many Top 40 hits in the 1960s.\n\n2. Watch the video of Smokey Robinson— a Motown singer, songwriter and producer who worked with Gordy — talking about the company’s first day of operations. Briefly review the video:\n\nWhat does Robinson say about Gordy’s mission for the record label? To whom was he trying to appeal? What do you think the challenges were for African-American artists who wanted to appeal to white listeners in the late 1950s and early 1960s? (Remind the class that Motown was founded as the Civil Rights movement was taking hold, and only a few years prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.)\n\nAccording to Robinson, what has made the music of Motown so lasting?\n\n3. Distribute the biography handouts and ask students to study them. As an option, students may also conduct research to learn more about their assigned persona. (This could be done as homework before class.) They should be able to answer the following questions:\n\nBerry Gordy handout\n\nMaxine Powell handout\n\nCholly Atkins handout\n\nSmokey Robinson handout\n\nMaurice King handout\n\nWhat was this individual’s primary role at Motown Records?\n\nHow did this person approach his or her responsibilities at Motown? What attitudes, sayings, or philosophies did he or she have?\n\nHow do you think this person helped Berry Gordy to achieve the company’s mission of “making music for the whole world”?\n\n4. Next, divide students into groups of five, with each student representing their assigned persona: Berry Gordy, Maxine Powell, Cholly Atkins, Smokey Robinson, or Maurice King. (Note: depending on the size of the class, students may alternate observing and playing roles.)\n\n5. Have students briefly introduce their persona to the rest of their group.\n\n6. Explain to students that they should imagine that it is the mid-1960s, and Motown has just signed a new group, a hypothetical trio of young women who grew up in the Detroit projects. Ask the group to discuss how they will help this group to create and promote hit records. Some things that they might touch on in discussion:\n\nHow should the group appear on stage? What clothes should they wear, and how should they move?\n\nWhat kind of training might they need to deal with the press and public appearances (interviews, television appearances, etc.)?\n\nWhat challenges might these artists face, and how can these difficulties be overcome? For example, as African-American artists who wanted to appeal to white as well as black audiences, what would they need to consider?\n\nWhat musical skills will this group need to have? What steps will be involved in making a record, and who will oversee this?\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nShow students the video about assembly line production at an automotive plant, noting that the Detroit area was home to many such factories, including those operated by Ford. Inform the class that before he opened Motown Records, Berry Gordy worked on a Ford assembly line. If necessary, remind students that on an assembly line, each worker has a specialized task that they perform in succession as the item — such as a car — is built and inspected. Discuss:\n\nHow is Gordy’s way of running Motown similar to a factory production line — what about this approach may have inspired him? (Think about production as well as promotion.)\n\nWhat advantages could this approach provide to a record company? What did the team of experts at Motown achieve that may have been more difficult for any single individual to accomplish?\n\nHow is producing a hit record different from producing an item like an automobile? Is it really possible to create a “factory” for producing good music? Why or why not?\n\nWriting Prompt:\n\nImagine that you are a young singer coming to work for Motown for the first time. Write a journal entry describing what it was like to work with Berry Gordy, Maxine Powell, Cholly Atkins, Smokey Robinson, and/or Maurice King. What did they help you with? What did they teach you to do?\n\nExtensions:\n\nHave students conduct research on the history of Detroit. Topics could include:\n\nRacial tensions and rioting during the civil rights era\n\nThe development and decline of the automotive industry\n\nHousing conditions for the working poor in the postwar period, and the development of housing projects such as the Brewster-Douglass complex.\n\nHave students read the article “Berry Gordy: Motown Musician,” a more detailed biography of Gordy. Ask them to use the information in the article to create a timeline of Gordy’s early life and career.\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout – Berry Gordy Handout – Cholly Atkins Handout – Maurice King Handout – Maxine Powell Handout – Smokey Robinson\n\nStandards\n\nNew Jersey State Standards\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Reading\n\nNJSLSA.R1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Writing\n\nNJSLSA.W3: Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Speaking and Listening\n\nNJSLSA.SL1: Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners, building on others ideas and expressing their own clearly and persuasively.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Language\n\nNJSLSA.L4: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.\n\nNJSLSA.L6: Acquire and use accurately a range of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases sufficient for reading, writing, speaking, and listening at the college and career readiness level; demonstrate independence in gathering vocabulary knowledge when encountering an unknown term important to comprehension or expression.\n\nNew York State Standards\n\nNew York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards\n\nReading Anchor Standards\n\nKey Ideas and Details\n\nStandard 1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly/implicitly and make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nWriting Anchor Standards\n\nText Types and Purposes\n\nStandard 3: Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective techniques, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.\n\nSpeaking and Listening\n\nComprehension and Collaboration\n\nStandard 1: Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners; express ideas clearly and persuasively, and build on those of others.\n\nPresentation of Knowledge and Ideas\n\nStandard 4: Present information, findings, and supporting evidence so that listeners can follow the line of reasoning.
