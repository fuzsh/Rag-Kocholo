        "text": "PREFACE This dissertation argues that white American novelistic response to the events of 9/11 places the spotlight on the domestic lives of the majority, while invoking nationalism and prose of otherness against other cultures and religions. In this predominantly WASP-cultural response, living togetherness in a multicultural society has been a far cry. Post-9/11 white American fiction deals with the nation’s trauma, and it tries to patch up the tear in the WASP cultural fabric overplaying American nationalism on the one hand, and on the other, by a prose of otherness against the Muslims. This dissertation posits such a response as the cultural trauma of the Americans. The first among the four novels under study for the dissertation—Jonathan Safran Foer’s Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close—evoke ethics, melancholia, and traumatic solidarity of the Americans with the Jews, which invariably make the translation of trauma cultural—what Jeffrey Alexander calls cultural trauma. Don DeLillo’s The Falling Man, too, dramatizes the trauma of 9/11 as cultural trauma which finds its entry into the novel in the form of the novelist’s discourse of us vs. them syndrome. John Updike’s Terrorist comes out as a perfect example of cultural trauma since it others the Muslims as terrorists, while deploys a clear-cut territorial divide between Western and Eastern spaces in order to envision a unified American space. A welcome departure from the above three novels has been Joseph O’Neill’s Netherland, which tires to come to terms with the trauma of 9/11 by building up cosmopolitan echoes for a peaceful multicultural living in America. Taking a cue from Joseph O’Neill’s Netherland as a literature of trauma of a higher order, this study uses it as a touchstone to comparatively evaluate the other three novels in terms of the representation of the trauma of 9/11 and finds them failing to match the quality of Netherland. What the examination of the representation of terrorism and the discourse of trauma in the above novels reveals is how American authors, with the exception of O’Neill, have not been able to free themselves from xenophobic media representations of 9/11. It has also aimed at raising questions about the patriotic tendency behind the canonization of the above novels of violence. Texts like Don DeLillo’s Falling Man and John Updike’s Terrorist present 9/11 as cultural trauma which is sought to be repaired through an appeal to an intensified prose of otherness which comes about due to these novelists’ attempt to understand the terrorist incident as the conflict between two contrasting frames of reference—the Orientalist stereotypes and the self-trumpeting civilized West. The prose of otherness in DeLillo and Foer is, however, not as brazen as that of Updike who resorts to an Orientalist discourse to malign the Muslim Other and reinforce stereotypes about Islam and Muslims, thus contributing to antagonism.\n\n9/11 was a watershed moment in history in more ways than one. It occasioned the resurgence and even creation of many rigid and reductive binaries: West vs. East, “us” vs. “them”, good vs. evil, Christianity vs. Islam, Western modernity vs. Muslim medievalism, multiculturalism vs. assimilation, democracy vs. Islamic Terror, secularism vs. religious fundamentalism, and so on and so forth. The most important fallout of 9/11 in the USA was the deep polarisation it created within mainstream American society. The lay American suddenly found themselves forced to take a stand on things that never used to occupy their minds as they chased the American Dream, like their country’s foreign policy, immigration policy, national security and its stand on issues of importance in international geopolitics. Literature and popular culture contributed significantly to bolstering or attenuating the dominant 9/11 rhetoric in the public imagination. Writers of fiction after 9/11 too had to traverse this minefield, as they tried, mostly in vain, to not fall into the trap of discourse and counter-discourse. This paper analyses how post-9/11 fiction has engaged with neo-Orientalist stereotypes, Manichaean myths and representations of alterity perpetrated in the wake of September 11, how it handled burning topics like terrorism, Islamophobia, assimilation, multiculturalism, nationalism and xenophobia, and whether it functioned as a conduit or a barrier to totalizing and dichotomizing post-9/11 frames, through a close reading and critique of a significant post-9/11 novel that directly confronts the politics of American culture after 9/11—Amy Waldman’s The Submission (2011\n\nThe pendulum between liberty and terror swings back and forth, its arc becomes narrower with each cycle in contradistinction to the breach between the vision of America in the collective imagination and the unsettling reality. While expecting America to reinvent itself, yet again, and maintain that delicate balance between myth and reality, writers, journalists, and analysts are making an extra effort to explore how terrorism is posited against the abstract notion of liberty and the dream of its possible realization in America. It is an effort to make meaning of the dynamics between liberty and terror, and to find possible solutions to the current crisis with globalization and terrorism as the two main adversaries. The search for answers involves for me an exploration of the interconnection between terrorism, art, and culture with a special focus on the perception and representation of Otherness. The crucial questions in this context are: What is the role of fiction and the artist in interpreting and translating the common cultural and political obsession with terrorism, surveillance, violence, and injustice, and in comprehending the way it has rearranged our perception of reality? Currently the dominant narrative – communal and personal, of polity and politics – is that of the reaction to terror. The main protagonist of the counter-narrative to terrorism, in my view, is the terrorist within – an internal, critical, and often destructive force that can be interpreted on several levels. On one level, this is the image of America sabotaging itself in the complex tangle of liberty and terror as I have already suggested. On another, it refers to the domestic, homegrown terrorist – the alien within the gates. The examples are so many by now and have occurred largely beyond American turf. On a third level, this is the Other within who speaks in the voice of trauma, the voice of fear, the voice of hatred and retribution. On a fourth level, every writer who approaches the subject of terror and terrorism acts as the unsettling voice of provocation – an unrelenting force investigating, probing, recalling terror, positing it against freedom, and examining the problematic correlation between the two as will be discussed in the subsequent pages. It is no coincidence then that Eagleton uses terms from the realm of literary theory and applies them within the social realm to define terrorism. For him it is “the ultimate act of defamiliarization, transforming the everyday into the monstrously unrecognizable. It is meant to cut the ground metaphorically as well as literally from beneath our feet. Shock and outrage are part of its meaning, not mere side-effects” (Holy 92). My claim is that transcultural literature will serve as the remaining evidence of how people across the US and the world have reacted and attempted to make meaning of acts of terror such as 9/11. The current chapter does not aim to present an exhaustive account of this substantial body of 9/11 American and transnational fiction, nor could it do so, but rather it focuses on two texts as its object of study: Don DeLillo’s Falling Man (2007) – a novel by one of the most prominent contemporary American writers who has written extensively on terrorism, and Frédéric Beigbeder’s Windows on the World (2003) – a French novel with an English title, chosen here for its transnational perspective."
