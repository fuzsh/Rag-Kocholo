This contrasts science fiction with \"realism\", which is set in the real world with little scientific or social difference from our real world depicted.\n\nThe second half of this definition is \"and which is set in a universe run by rational scientific laws.\" This distinguishes science fiction from \"fantasy\", which is set in a universe run by some impossible postulate or principle (often magic). And from \"supernatural fiction\", set in a universe run by supernatural forces.\n\nPlease see the Wikipedia article on \"Definitions of science fiction\". It lists numerous definitions, many of which have much in common with my own, above.\n\nActual SF Tales and the Definition. Both the definitions in the Wikipedia article, and my own definition, reflect the common practice of numerous actual science fiction writers and their stories. These definitions are not, or at least not entirely, a priori prescriptions for how sf should be written. Instead, they reflect the underlying principles of countless real science fiction tales.\n\nObviously, there are worthwhile tales that say, mix science fiction and fantasy, and which thus do not conform to the above definition. So there are good stories that fall outside my definition, and most of the definitions in the Wikipedia.\n\nBut the big point: most science fiction tales do conform to these definitions. Maybe at least 95% of the tales in the field. So such definitions are very much worth keeping in mind. They make explicit the ideas underlying most, although not quite all, of the stories in the sf field. (Ideas in the arts do not need to cover every artwork to have value. An idea, even if it has many exceptions, can illuminate big chunks of a field, and thus be useful and valid.)\n\nThe above definition works just as well for \"literary\" authors of science fiction, such as Karel Capek, Margaret Atwood or William S. Burroughs, as it does for genre writers like Asimov and Heinlein. Burroughs' book Nova Express very much deals with innovations like aliens invading Earth, and \"word viruses\". While its literary technique is highly experimental, its content is squarely within the boundaries of the above sf definition. Writers like Capek, Atwood and Burroughs clearly saw value in science fiction paradigms, and choose to write books with science fiction as the underlying principle.\n\nAlternate Paths. Two kinds of fiction are often published as \"science fiction\", but do not correspond well with most definitions of science fiction, including mine:\n\nAlternate History: tales which show, for example, what might have happened if the South won the US Civil War, or the Black Death never happened.\n\nAlternate Paths: tales which show how a person's life might have been different if they had married someone else, or caught a different train. These are popular in the movies.\n\nBoth of these kinds of stories are interesting and legitimate. But the fact is, that they do not correspond well with most definitions of science fiction - or with most standard kinds of science fiction books and films actually made.\n\nIt is not clear if such tales are \"really\" science fiction. Maybe they are actually separate, distinct genres. If so, that is fine!\n\nGood SF vs Bad SF. Unlike some of the Wikipedia definitions, mine is NOT an attempt to distinguish between good and bad science fiction, or to define goals toward which good science fiction should aspire. Instead, my definition simply seeks to distinguish science fiction from other kinds of literature, such as realism, fantasy or the supernatural.\n\nNote: I very much agree that defining good science fiction is a worthwhile task. And that the definitions of people like Heinlein or Sturgeon that attempt to point to good science fiction make informative reading. My definition simply does not attempt to do this - instead, it tries to differentiate science fiction from other kinds of fiction.\n\nJorge Luis Borges\n\nBorges is an unusual combination of mainstream and genre writer. An extraordinarily well read and cultured man, Borges' work is packed with literary and philosophical allusions. Yet most of it has strong ties to either mystery fiction, or science fiction and fantasy. Borges' fiction is complex and highly plotted. The plots are fully in the tradition of popular writers of mysteries and sf. Many of the stories are brilliantly ingenious. Borges' work consists of short stories and essays. While the essays tend to be critical works about some author or topic, they usually develop complex, ingenious ideas that are very similar to those in Borges' stories. A strong influence on all of Borges' work are the ingenious tales of G.K. Chesterton, with their complex, well made plots, their rich atmosphere, and philosophical allusions. Borges was also strongly influenced by Chesterton's master Robert Louis Stevenson, and by such 19th Century pioneers of mystery and sf as Poe and Hawthorne.\n\nBorges' first book of fiction was A Universal History of Infamy. This is a collection of brief, highly fictional biographies of real life criminals and adventurers. It has nothing to do with the Rogue tradition of Hornung and Leblanc. Instead, its tales unroll Borges' complex philosophical imaginings. Many of the tales are loaded with Borges' humor. The best of these 1933-1934 tales are included in the omnibus, Borges A Reader. Borges followed this collection in the 1940's with Ficciones, his greatest collection of stories.\n\nMystery Stories\n\n\"Death and The Compass\" is an anti-detective story, where the idea is to look at all of the ingenious ways in which the author subverts the conventions of the traditional detective tale. The mystery plot is complex, but every aspect of it supports Borges' logical satire of detective fiction. One point: one element of the mystery that is never explained is the nakedness of the corpse under the cape; I suspect that this is simply Borges' homage to Ellery Queen's The Spanish Cape Mystery (1935), where such nakedness plays a role in the solution. Like his master Chesterton, and like Ellery Queen, most of Borges' mystery fiction reflects the intuitionist tradition.\n\nBy contrast, \"Theme of the Traitor and Hero\" is a triumph, a real detective story of the first water. It was made into a beautiful color film by director Bernardo Bertolucci, The Spider's Stratagem (1970), a gorgeous film that is like taking a vacation to Italy.\n\n\"Ibn Hakkan al-Bokhari, Dead in his Labyrinth\" (1949) is full of vivid story-telling detail. Both in plot and style, the tale is a skillful pastiche of Chesterton. It has a fascinating central image of the labyrinth, and some not bad detective deduction at the end about the significance of a labyrinth. Unfortunately, the mystery plot as a whole is not that clever.\n\nSix Problems for Don Isidro Parodi, Borges' collaboration with Adolpho Bioy-Casares, lies somewhere in the middle. Most of the problems are too contrived to make really good classical detective stories. Most of the stories also contain some real ingenuity, and the collection is very much worth reading.\n\nScience Fiction: Borges and the Campbell Tradition\n\nBorges' solo fiction includes more science fiction than detective stories. Even \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" is more interesting for the sf ideas its characters discuss, than for the thriller elements that make up the story proper.\n\nBorges' writing shows the systematic, logical development of ideas found in Campbell writers of the \"Golden Age\" of science fiction. Borges is more of a Campbellian than is sometimes realized. Borges repeatedly expressed his admiration for H.G. Wells. Wells is the writer who most influenced Campbell and his authors.\n\nBorges' \"The Immortal\" (1949) likely shows the influence of John W. Campbell's \"Forgetfulness\" (1937), a once-famous story. SPOILERS. There are broad similarities, with a huge advanced city, now deserted, and a group of primitive people nearby. Both stories contain a similar plot twist. Both stories have the hero exploring the city, entering by an obscure passageway.\n\nBorges' An Introduction to American Literature (1967), written with Esther Zemborain de Torres, cites Van Vogt and Heinlein as outstanding science fiction authors. They were widely viewed in the 1940's as the two leading writers for John W. Campbell's magazine Astounding Science Fiction.\n\nMathematics\n\nSeveral of Borges most important works deal with mathematics, especially permutations and infinity - two not unrelated subjects. These include the stories \"The Babylon Lottery\" (1941), \"The Library of Babel\" (1941), \"The Book of Sand\" (1975) and the essays \"The Doctrine of Cycles\" (1934), \"The Total Library\" (1939), \"Avatars of the Tortoise\" (1939), \"The Analytical Language of John Wilkins\" (1942). These works take place in an abstract domain entirely created through mathematics.\n\nIn addition are those Borges stories that deal with \"everything\": the concept of infinite collections of objects or ideas. These include \"Funes, the Memorious\" (1942) and \"The Aleph\" (1945). These two stories by contrast, take place in real neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. They feature characters who eventually encounter the infinite during their otherwise realistic daily lives. Borges' best story, \"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\" (1940) deals with not \"everything\", but almost everything: a whole planetful of information. It too has some authentic Buenos Aires atmosphere, and the striking contrast between the near-infinite and the everyday.\n\nKarel Capek\n\nCapek, like Borges, was a plot-oriented mainstream writer, who often turned to either mystery or science fiction in his writings.\n\nTales from Two Pockets\n\nCapek published two collections of brief tales loosely linked to crime, Tales from One Pocket and Tales from the Other Pocket (1928 - 1929). They have been translated into English by Norma Comrada and published in one volume as Tales from Two Pockets (1994).\n\nSome of Capek's tales in these collections are philosophical detective stories. \"The Blue Chrysanthemum\" is especially concerned with epistemology: how do we know things, learn things, acquire new knowledge. What limitations do we subconsciously impose on our search for truth? Capek's tale ingeniously explores the nature of such concepts. It reminds one somewhat of the philosophical tales of Borges.\n\n\"The Stolen Cactus\" has some links to \"The Blue Chrysanthemum\". Both tales involve rare plants and plant collectors. The way the thief in \"The Stolen Cactus\" evades people's mental categories through disguise, is a bit linked to the epistemological concerns of \"The Blue Chrysanthemum\". This unexpectedly leads to a brief but interesting discussion of the nature of God, in \"The Stolen Cactus\", reminding us that Capek is the author of an sf tale about the Deity, The Absolute at Large.\n\nSince the early scientific detective stories of Arthur B. Reeve and Cleveland Moffett, there has been an interest in the \"word association test\" and what it might reveal about our subconscious thoughts. \"The Experiment of Professor Rouss\" offers an interesting twist on this idea, one that combines satire with a genuine look at how the word association paradigm might break down.\n\nCapek had a certain realism in his approach. His detectives tend either to be policemen, or ordinary people who take up amateur detection for the first time in their lives, as in \"The Disappearance of an Actor\". This last story is perhaps the closest Capek came to a conventional detective story; one is surprised that it has not been anthologized more often. The mystery in \"The Disappearance of an Actor\" is linked to what might loosely be termed the victim's mental makeup or world-view, giving the tale a bit of a cognitive or philosophical cast. \"The Disappearance of an Actor\" is a search for someone missing, linking it the searches for missing objects in Capek tales like \"The Blue Chrysanthemum\", \"The Missing Letter\", \"The Stolen Cactus\".\n\n\"The Receipt\" is a nicely done old-fashioned detective story, in which clues found on a corpse are used to deduce the victim's identity. \"The Receipt\" anticipates \"The Disappearance of an Actor\", in that the sleuths have to reconstruct the mind-set and behavior of the victim and people the victim knew, to make progress and understand the crime. In \"The Disappearance of an Actor\" this is then used to develop a surprising mystery puzzle plot twist. By contrast, in \"The Receipt\" the reconstruction is used purely for purposes of trying to track down who the victim was. Both \"The Receipt\" and \"The Disappearance of an Actor\" also share imagery of a decayed corpse found long after a killing.\n\n\"The Poet\" also deals with the police getting information to track down a crime. It explores different witnesses and their world views, and how this leads the witnesses to process information in different ways. This has philosophical and cognitive implications.\n\n\"The Orchestra Conductor's Story\" develops a similar theme as \"The Poet\". In \"The Poet\", the creative poet \"translates\" everything he sees into modernist poetry. The conductor \"hears\" all the sounds around him as a form of music. And this awareness helps him understand things better than other people, even things said in other languages he doesn't speak. \"The Orchestra Conductor's Story\" is not constructed as a mystery story, though, unlike \"The Poet\".\n\n\"The Crime on the Farm\" is a brief and mainly minor tale of murder without mystery or detection. Its most interesting part involves farm fields and the plants that grow on them, as well as the farmer's attitudes towards such fields. The tale's extensive plant imagery links it to Capek botany mysteries like \"The Blue Chrysanthemum\" and \"The Stolen Cactus\".\n\n\"The Fall of the House of Voticky\" is a fair play mystery story, but one with an unusual structure. Capek's series sleuth policeman Dr. Mejzlik is asked to solve a mystery. But the mystery is a historical one. Events in the 1400's are known only from a few scraps of information; Dr. Mejzlik is asked to reconstruct them from these bits of knowledge. Dr. Mejzlik uses deduction, and also some guesswork he subjects to Occam's Razor. This whole structure for a mystery is highly unusual in detective fiction. The mystery involves a puzzle of who killed a certain victim and why. But it goes beyond that to the riddle of explaining all the confusing pieces of information about the case, and reconstructing now forgotten events.\n\nBoth intriguing and annoying are sketches in which Capek propounds a mystery, then fails to provide a solution. Such solutionless mysteries include: \"Dr. Mejzlik's Case\", \"Footprints\", \"The Old Jailbird's Story\". Capek tries to milk these situations for philosophical profundity, but mainly they seem a cheat. \"Footprints\" is a variation on a much better story Capek wrote earlier, \"The Footprint\" (1917), found in the collection Toward the Radical Center. \"The Footprint\" explores more possible solutions for its impossibility, before deciding that none of them would work. These ideas are interesting. Then, \"The Footprint\" suggests some non-trivial philosophical concepts. \"The Footprint\" does not concentrate on the alleged \"ux-explainability\" of the impossible footprint. Instead, it develops a metaphor about ideas are which are unconnected from the great bulk of other ideas, just as the mysterious footprint is not connected to a known cause.\n\n\"The Stolen Murder\" is strikingly surreal, in its odd developments. An idea Capek uses was already in use in crime stories: for example in episode 5 of Les Vampires (1915-1916), a crime movie serial directed by Louis Feuillade. But Capek uses this idea to develop something original: a whole \"collapse or transformation of reality\". Actual reality, and how reality \"officially\" looks, become different, midway through the tale. Perhaps this relates a little bit to the cognitive ideas of \"The Blue Chrysanthemum\", where people have to think outside of standard categories.\n\n\"The Little Countess\" is a burlesque of spy stories. But the details of the comic parody are also used to create a puzzle plot, mystifying the narrator and reader about what is going on. The narrator-sleuth goes through several stages in understanding the events.\n\nInterpreting Modernist Literature, to Furnish Clues in a Mystery\n\nIn Capek's mystery short story \"The Poet\", a modernist poem is analyzed for hidden content. This approach is used in:\n\n\"The Poet\" in Tales from One Pocket (1928 - 1929) by Karel Capek.\n\nThe Body Goes Round and Round (1942) by Theodora Du Bois.\n\n\"Mouthpiece\" (1974) by mystery-science fiction hybrid writer Edward Wellen. He is discussed elsewhere in this article.\n\nSee also attempts to understand apparently surrealist utterances in:\n\nThe Dark Garden (1933) and the short story \"Easter Devil\" (1934) in The Cases of Susan Dare by Mignon G. Eberhart.\n\n\"P as in Poison\" (1976) by Lawrence Treat.\n\nR.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)\n\nR.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (1920) is a science fiction play by Capek. It is about machine-made workers, and invented the word \"robot\". It became a sensation on the world's stages in the 1920's, and made Capek famous. A more complete and faithful English translation than the earlier 1920's one is found in the Capek collection Toward the Radical Center.\n\nMuch of R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) satirizes industry and the industrial age. The robots are artificially made humans, created purely to be workers. And they are themselves designed according to industrial principles. They are what industry would design and manufacture, if it could replace human workers by a \"better\" product: better by the standards of modern factory production. Capek develops a large amount of science fictional detail in his picture of the robots, their origin, manufacture and behavior. And most of this detail is logically based in the values and needs of industrial manufacture.\n\nCapek shows modern commerce leading to horrible, unexpected results. The robots are created by the methods and standards of industrial capitalism; they are made in huge numbers by inexorable demands of their economic impact - but everything leads to disaster. Reading the play today, it is hard not to think about global warning, and the economic forces that keep promoting it.\n\nCapek returned to the theme of commerce as a powerful force running roughshod over humans values in other works. The short fantasy \"The Five Loaves\" (1937) in Toward the Radical Center satirizes commercial goals destroying Christian values. It is an imaginative and chilling tale.\n\nAnthony Boucher\n\nAnthony Boucher was a mystery and science fiction writer, editor and critic. There is a book-length biography and critical study of him, Anthony Boucher: A Biobibliography (2008), by Jeffrey Marks. During 1945-1948, Boucher also plotted a large number of mystery radio plays. A collection of his radio mysteries, The Casebook of Gregory Hood is available from its publisher, Crippen & Landru.\n\nNone of the Boucher novels I have read, considered as fair play, puzzle plot detective stories, reach the heights of his mystery short fiction collected in Exeunt Murderers. These are general purpose mystery stories in the Ellery Queen tradition, not impossible crime tales, and are outstandingly plotted.\n\nBoucher's short tales are persistent users of that EQ convention, the dying message. And variations on the dying message, in which the detective has to find hidden meanings or obscure clues, in a piece of text. These are not \"dying\" messages, strictly speaking, but are closely related.\n\nBoucher is generally undervalued, both as a mystery writer and as a science fiction author. Many people in both fields think of him in his later years, when he functioned mainly as an sf editor and mystery critic. He left a reputation for both personal kindness and literary quality in these roles, with a special emphasis on the encouragement of new authors. Boucher was both the writing teacher and first publisher of Philip K. Dick, for example; Dick later dedicated his classic Ubik (1968) to Boucher's memory. But Boucher's well deserved reputation as an editor has obscured his earlier literary contributions.\n\nBoucher had an influence on several later science fiction authors. His story \"Barrier\" (1942) sets forth the basic time travel scenario that will later underlay Isaac Asimov's The End of Eternity (1955). Boucher's mystery novel, The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (1940), seems to be a key ancestor of Philip K. Dick sf stories where reality collapses. In Boucher's tale, which is not a science fiction story, characters get involved in many strange surreal adventures, that are later explained naturally as bizarre schemes of the villain. The \"feel\" is remarkably similar to Dick novels, such as the strange adventures of the hero in The Man Who Japed (1956).\n\nBoucher and the Van Dine School\n\nBoucher's novels have some Van Dine school characteristics:\n\nThe settings are among the sort of intellectuals one often finds in Van Dine school writers: the playing card collectors in Knave, the mystery fans of Baker Street, the theater people in Solid Key.\n\nWhile Fergus O'Breen is technically a private eye, he is very intellectual, and falls into the tradition of genius amateur detective who works closely with the police.\n\nBoucher's investigations take place immediately after the crime and explore every aspect of the crime and people's lives, in the Van Dine tradition.\n\nBackgrounds: Intellectual\n\nBoucher seemingly moved in every intellectual circle in California, in the 1930's and 40's, as a grad student, aspiring playwright, aspiring screen writer, critic for a political newspaper, mystery writer, science fiction writer, radio writer, practicing Roman Catholic, and classical music lover. Intellectuals from all of these areas show up in his stories, delineated with startling vividness, and much background on their life and work. One has a feeling that one is getting a first hand portrait of a real era in American life. And one that is less idealized (and whitewashed) than the portraits of New York City intellectuals in Van Dine, Ellery Queen and the Lockridges.\n\nAnthony Boucher's works contain three impossible crime novels. One of them, The Case of the Solid Key (1941), is my favorite of Boucher's novels. But not because of the impossible crime. Rather, because it is a fascinating book about 1940's Hollywood, focusing on a bunch of young people who, like Boucher himself at the time, were trying to break into the film industry. Boucher never made it in Hollywood, by the way, but he did become a prolific writer of radio plays. The Case of the Solid Key also looks in detail at a Little Theater play production in which some of these hopefuls are involved. The actual impossible crime in Key is solid but slight.\n\nThe best parts of The Case of the Seven of Calvary (1937) deal with putting on a play, and are full of allusions to and ideas about literature. Similar rich inventiveness about matters literary is found in another early Boucher tale, the satire \"Threnody\" (1936). And while \"The Punt and the Pass' (1945) is negligible as a mystery plot, it gives a lively look at a University campus, just like The Case of the Seven of Calvary.\n\n\"The Girl Who Married a Monster\" (1954) has characters who work in television, and an attempt to create a bit of an inside look at that institution too.\n\nThe early Gregory Hood radio plays deal with \"celebrity culture\". Hood is a society figure who has many celebrity friends, who make guest appearances in his radio plays. I confess this enthusiasm for the famous makes me uneasy. Celebrity culture doesn't seem any more appealing in the 1940's than it does today. 1940's radio was deep into celebrities: they made frequent appearances on radio programs, in a way they rarely or ever did in books or movies. Celebrities were also linked to expensive night clubs and restaurants, a venue that appears in \"Murder in Celluloid\".\n\nBoucher loved party scenes, involving artists and intellectuals. Some of his most joyous works are centered around such parties: The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars, \"Mystery for Christmas\", \"The Elusive Violin\". The presence of artist characters links such tales to the Van Dine School tradition.\n\nNine Times Nine (1940) shows the frustrating career, or non-career, of a young writer during the Depression. He keeps getting fired from whatever \"starting position\" writing jobs he can find. The novel doesn't seem especially enthused about the WPA or its hero's writing work there.\n\nThe Case of the Seven Sneezes as a whole is Boucher's poorest novel. But its opening chapter is an excellent look at a Hollywood party: one of Boucher's joyous gatherings of creative people. The representative of old, silent era Hollywood is especially interesting. It is good to see that Boucher is knowledgeable about film history as a whole, not just contemporary Hollywood.\n\nThere are some unusual writing partnerships in Boucher: The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (Chapter 14), the frame story in \"Mystery for Christmas\". The one in \"Mystery for Christmas\" gets compared to a detective partnership.\n\nBackgrounds: Eerie Tales\n\n\"The Adventure of the Headless Monk\" and \"The Adventure of the Beeswax Candle\" are two radio plays from the same period, Spring 1946, that have much in common in subject matter. Both:\n\nAre eerie tales that pit the sleuth against sinister villains who practice the black arts. Boucher clearly had nothing but contempt for black magic, but he also felt that it made for an appropriately creepy background for a thriller.\n\nTake place on foggy or misty nights. Please see my list of Fog in Mysteries.\n\nHave creepy settings\n\nHave sinister music associated with the events: an organ in \"The Adventure of the Headless Monk\", a clarinet in \"The Adventure of the Beeswax Candle\". Such music is a natural for radio.\n\nThe puzzles in the two plays are quite different, however.\n\nBackgrounds: Other\n\nBoucher's \"Coffin Corner\" (1943), employs sports backgrounds just as EQ did, four years previously, in his Paula Paris series of shorts. Sports also plays a role in Boucher's radio play \"Gregory Hood's First Case\".\n\nBoucher could also write about policemen.\n\nSome of Boucher's work is quite racy. His first novel The Case of the Seven of Calvary is downright salty. To be blunt, I don't like this. Explicit material sinks the second half of The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars. The first half is an enjoyable, light hearted Sherlockian romp. The second half has a pair of sex crimes emerge from the suspects' past: dark and unpleasant material. \"The Stripper\" deals with a serial killer, and the suspects' perverse sex lives. Most of this material is not very good. Boucher was perhaps fortunate, that the puritanism of American radio seems largely to have steered him away from explicit subjects in his radio plays. The occasional exception, like the Gregory Hood radio play \"Murder in Celluloid\", are among his least likable radio work.\n\nThe comic elements in Boucher's novels recall those of John Dickson Carr. The events lurch between wild farce and serious crime; such an alternation of tone derives from Carr. There is also a certain self consciousness about the conventions of detective storytelling, that also recalls Carr, such as Dr. Fell's assertion in The Three Coffins (1935) that one was in the midst of a detective tale.\n\nThe Case of the Crumpled Knave\n\nBoucher's series detective Fergus O'Breen first appears in The Case of the Crumpled Knave (1939). This is a Golden Age novel that has everything but a really clever solution. It makes pleasant reading, till one reaches the end and discovers that there is nothing clever lurking behind all this development.\n\nAlong the way there are numerous subplots focusing on the suspects. Boucher reveals that most of them are Not What They Seem To Be. This is a persistent plot gambit in his novels: Boucher will ring many changes on this theme throughout his books.\n\nBoucher includes some clever science fiction ideas in Chapter 7 of this book. This chapter also contains some of the running background information on playing cards and their collectors; more is found in Chapters 10 and 12.\n\nSubjects: Vacancy with Corpse\n\nThe short story \"The Ghost with a Gun\" (1945) and the novella \"Vacancy with Corpse\" (1946) have subjects in common:\n\nSettings in greater San Francisco at the time of World War 2.\n\nThe housing shortage brought on by industrial workers moving to the city, for war production work.\n\nUnderworld and mobster types.\n\nBuildings with plate glass windows are the opening locales\n\nA sympathetic policeman on the Homicide squad. (The two cops in the tales might or might not be the same man. The cop in \"The Ghost with a Gun\" has a rank, Lieutenant, but no name. The cop in \"Vacancy with Corpse\" is Detective-Lieutenant Ben Latimer.)\n\nFBI Agent Lafferty makes brief, friendly appearances in both tales. He bonds with the cop hero. Lafferty's presence in more than one tale is an example of Boucher's world-building, especially his use of shared characters.\n\nBoth works were published several years after Boucher had stopped publishing novels.\n\nBoth Nine Times Nine (1940) and \"Vacancy with Corpse\" (1946) have:\n\nSister Ursula as detective.\n\nA begining with a criminal threatening an honest older man who's helped bring the criminal to justice. In Nine Times Nine this older man is an investigating journalist (Wolfe Harrigan) who's gathered evidence for a trial of the criminal. In \"Vacancy with Corpse\" the older man (Graffer) is a judge who sentenced the criminal to prison.\n\nA family mansion where the honest older man lives.\n\nA romantic rival for the hero who is handsome, very well-dressed, and conscious of social class.\n\nA young woman who wants to be a nun, which leads to a connection with Sister Ursula.\n\nSister Ursula's unexpected skill as a cook in \"Vacancy with Corpse\", recalls retired film star Stella Paris' unexpected cooking expertise in The Case of the Seven Sneezes (Chapter 1).\n\nOther Writers. Wartime housing shortages earlier played a role in The Case of the Dowager's Etchings (1943) by Rufus King. As in \"Vacancy with Corpse\", a mansion is thrown open to workers who need a place to stay.\n\nThe Halloween setting of \"The Ghost with a Gun\" plays a role in the mystery plot. It also recalls such holiday-set mysteries as Calamity Town (1942) by Ellery Queen.\n\nStorytelling: Vacancy with Corpse\n\n\"Vacancy with Corpse\" would make a good movie or TV film. The romance between the heroine and the investigating cop would be great for film.\n\n\"Vacancy with Corpse\" has a traditional mystery setting: a mansion owned by a rich family. And traditional mystery characters: the family, including an invalid, a doctor, nurse, and male secretary. What, no lawyer?\n\nThe story telling in \"Vacancy with Corpse\" is logical. After two pages introducing the hero and heroine and setting up their romance, Boucher gets down to business. The heroine starts right in telling the hero something: something that does indeed turn out to be important in the case. The opening is NOT a tease: it starts at a genuinely logical starting point of the mystery plot.\n\nThe opening shows three of the main characters \"on stage\". And mentions five more characters, in the dialogue. All eight of these people will play a major role in the plot. Boucher tells us something clear about each of these characters, letting us readers get a good grip on who each character is. Later chapters will develop all of these characters further. But the opening gets readers off to a good start.\n\nSister Ursula's solution begins with a list of still-unsolved mysteries that any good solution must explain (Chapter 12). Such a \"list of unsolved mysteries\" is a common feature in detective fiction. And always welcome.\n\nSister Ursula's solution is full of clever ideas. It helps make \"Vacancy with Corpse\" one of Boucher's best long-form mystery works.\n\nThe Nick Noble short stories\n\nNine of his short stories employ Boucher's series detective Nick Noble. This character recalls Erle Stanley Gardner's Mugs Magoo, in Gardner's Paul Pry stories. Both are alliteratively named former police officers who were thrown off the force for political reasons, had tragedy strike their lives, and who subsequently declined into alcoholism.\n\nThe first Nick Noble tale, \"Screwball Division\" (1942), includes Los Angeles homicide detective Lt. Herman Finch, a character from Boucher's The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars, a novel with ties to Boucher's Fergus O'Breen series. The last tale in the Nick Noble series, \"The Girl Who Married a Monster\" (1954), has references to Fergus O'Breen, or at least his detective agency. These indicate that the Nick Noble tales are set in the same \"universe\" as the O'Breen works.\n\nA non-series short story \"Mystery for Christmas\" (1943) stars sleuths Mr. Quilter and Tom Smith, characters who bear a bit of a resemblance to Agatha Christie's Mr. Quin and Mr. Satterthwaite. This story too has a frame that refers to the film studio Metropolis Pictures from The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars, and its head F.X. Weinberg.\n\nNick Noble hangs out in a cafe on Main Street, the downtown near-slum area that served as Los Angeles' Skid Row in the 1940's.\n\nAnthony Boucher and Mystery Plot Structure\n\nBIG SPOILERS in this section.\n\nAnthony Boucher repeatedly used a number of mystery plotting techniques, always with variations.\n\nMany Boucher stories contain numerous plot ideas, often from the different categories below. The plot of the story is a mosaic, made up of a series of different plot gambits. It can be startling to read a brief Boucher mystery short story, and see that it has three or four plot ideas, any one of which might have served a lesser writer as the sole subject of a story.\n\nDying Messages. Anthony Boucher's stories are filled with Dying Messages. This is a favorite technique of an author who heavily influenced Boucher, Ellery Queen. Examples in Boucher: the card in The Case of the Crumpled Knave, the victim's statement in \"The Three Silver Pesos\", the title reference in \"QL 696.C9\", \"Death of a Patriarch\", \"The Adventure of May Tenth\", the coins in \"The Adventure of the Green-Eyed Murder\", \"The Stripper\", \"The Red Capsule\", \"The White Masters\". There are also statements that are not strictly from dying murder victims, but which function in the same way: such as the identification of the thief in \"Mystery for Christmas\", the name clue in \"Gregory Hood's First Case\". The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (Chapters 11, 24) contains two small verbal phrases with more than one meaning; these puzzles also work like dying message mysteries.\n\nThe dying messages in Boucher are hard to interpret: the sleuth often comes up with more than one meaning. This adds ingenuity to the tales.\n\nThere are also stories in which the presence of a dying message is not immediately obvious, but which has to be unearthed by the detective. See \"Screwball Division\".\n\nSleuth Nick Noble in \"QL 696.C9\" does some ingenious meta-level reasoning about a dying message. This allows him to interpret what the massage means - without at first understanding the underlying methodology of the message.\n\nHidden Clues in Text. Boucher also sometimes had his sleuths uncover hidden patterns in a piece of text. This text might not strictly speaking be any sort of dying message. Still, this plot approach does have some broad similarities to the dying message problem. I've dubbed this approach Textual Analysis. In Boucher, see \"Crime Must Have a Stop\". This approach occurs in MacHarg and Balmer's \"The Axton Letters\" (1910).\n\nCiphers. The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (Chapters 5, 8), \"The Singular Affair of the Baconian Cipher\" show his sleuths working out simple ciphers. In both tales, this is part of the set-up of the stories, rather than part of the finale.\n\nThe Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (Chapter 8) shows how an extra clue is worked into the cipher format. It is a bit related to the dying message puzzles found elsewhere in Boucher.\n\nFaked evidence. Killers in Boucher often fake evidence, in ways designed to implicate another person. All sorts of evidence can be faked, including dying messages. This means that plots involving faked messages sometimes intergrade with dying message plots in Boucher. Boucher could also mix phony evidence with impossible crime plots, as in \"Gregory Hood, Suspect\".\n\nBoucher was especially ingenious, in coming up with reasons for his sleuths to conclude a certain piece of evidence is faked. Examples: the card and fingerprints in The Case of the Crumpled Knave, the arrow in \"Gregory Hood's First Case\", the hair in \"The Adventure of the Sad Clown\", the document in \"The Out-Of-Date Murder\".\n\nThe evidence for the faking can be part of an elaborate chain of reasoning, involving many aspects of a case. This chain of reasoning can become a complex dance of ideas, as in the finale of The Case of the Crumpled Knave, or the solution to \"Screwball Division\". The finale of \"Murder Beyond the Mountains\" involves meta-level reasoning about some faked evidence, linked to a second deduction identifying the killer. The mere fact that evidence has been faked, itself becomes significant, and used for deduction.\n\n\"The Adventure of May Tenth\" is an unusual Boucher dying message tale, in which the message is partly real, partly faked by the killer. It offers another Boucher variation on two of his favorite plot approaches, dying messages and faked evidence.\n\n\"The April Fool Adventure\" is unusual, in that we readers know the evidence is fake right from the start.\n\n\"The Strange Case of the Girl with a Gazelle\" is a seemingly impossible crime, that is actually faked due to phony evidence. The tale is an unusual hybrid of impossible crime and fake evidence plot.\n\nDeductions from real evidence. Boucher detectives do Sherlock Holmes style deductions about people from objects: the archery finger tip and bow in \"Gregory Hood's First Case\". The Hood radio play \"The Forgetful Murderer\" has deductions from unbound pages of a book found at a crime scene, and to a lesser degree, from a mysterious metal object.\n\nSeveral of Boucher's Sherlock Holmes radio plays open with the sleuth making deductions about his clients: something regularly featured in Doyle's original tales. Boucher's deductions tend to be sound but simple. For example, in \"The Camberwell Poisoners\" Holmes deduces that since his client carries a briefcase, and is out doing business in the middle of the night, that he is probably an insurance adjuster. This play also has deductions about a dog. Other examples: \"The Singular Affair of the Uneasy Easy Chair\". Such deduction is discussed in The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (Chapter 12), with an example.\n\nLocked Rooms. Locked room puzzles appear in Nine Times Nine, The Case of the Solid Key, Rocket to the Morgue, \"Gregory Hood, Suspect\", \"The Smoke-filled Locked Room\".\n\nWhile some mystery writers deal with a wide range of impossible crime situations, Boucher instead seems most interested in pure locked rooms.\n\nThe solutions of Rocket to the Morgue and \"The Smoke-filled Locked Room\" have some broad elements in common, in terms of their basic approach. The solution in \"The Smoke-filled Locked Room\" is fairer and more imaginative, though.\n\n\"The Strange Case of the Girl with a Gazelle\" is an impossible theft from a locked room.\n\n\"The Adventure of the Headless Monk\" is a locked room murder - or more strictly, a \"watched room\" mystery, a common variant of the locked room in mystery fiction. Its solution would be a cheat in most circumstances. But within the context of Boucher's story, the solution is an interesting idea. The tale also benefits from its vivid storytelling.\n\n\"The Singular Affair of the Uneasy Easy Chair\" is a locked room mystery. But its solution is such a cliche that it is not very interesting.\n\nHidden Objects. Boucher also created examples of an Ellery Queen and Stuart Palmer specialty, the ingeniously hidden object. Examples: the jewels in \"Mystery for Christmas\", \"The April Fool Adventure\", \"The Double Diamond\". Some of the hiding places will only work within the special backgrounds of the story: see \"Mystery for Christmas\", \"The Double Diamond\".\n\nThe violin in \"The Elusive Violin\" is also hidden, but more by a process, than by a fixed hiding place.\n\n\"The Singular Affair of the Baconian Cipher\" deals with the hiding of a man.\n\nStrange Cars. Boucher tales have strange vehicles, sometimes with hidden drivers: The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (Chapter 11), \"The Adventure of the Sad Clown\".\n\nAlibis. Alibi puzzles occasionally show up in Boucher, as in \"The Adventure of the Green-Eyed Murder\", \"The Camberwell Poisoners\". Both alibi tales involve the mathematical calculation of a single time. Once the calculation is done, the sleuth knows everything about the alibis.\n\nA look back at a previous murder case contains a very simple alibi puzzle The Case of the Solid Key (Chapter 7). It is solved right away.\n\nA more traditional, bust-the-perfect-alibi plot shows up in the finale of The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars. This seems right out of the Freeman Wills Crofts tradition.\n\nTracing a crime to an apparent murder victim. This plot gambit appears in Margery Allingham's Police at the Funeral (1931). Boucher used an Allingham-like approach in a number of works: The Case of the Crumpled Knave (Chapters 23-24), \"The Three Silver Pesos\". In all of these works, a character's actions murder another person, long after that character's death.\n\nIn \"Screwball Division\", a complex chain of circumstances disguises a victim's guilt.\n\nThe complex murder in The Case of the Solid Key was planned by the victim, and was originally designed to murder someone else. The victim winds up in the middle of it, after accidentally getting killed himself. Something similar happens in \"The Red Capsule\". Both tales also involve a similar planned switch of identity, between killer and victim.\n\nMultiple Villains. Another recurring Boucher approach: a tale in which more than one villain has committed crimes. The detective (and the reader) has to disentangle this, figuring which villain did what. At its crudest, in Boucher's novels The Case of the Seven of Calvary (1937) and The Case of the Seven Sneezes (1942), this is not very inventive, or even especially fair to the reader. But several later Boucher short works use this approach with considerable ingenuity, and a greater fairness to the reader. See \"Screwball Division\", \"Mystery for Christmas\", \"The Girl Who Married a Monster\", \"The Three Silver Pesos\".\n\nThe plots in \"Mystery for Christmas\" and \"The Girl Who Married a Monster\" seem related.\n\nSchemes that Backfire. Ellery Queen's There Was an Old Woman (1943) looks at a \"harmless\" scheme that turns deadly. Boucher wrote some tales in this tradition: his Sherlock Holmes radio play \"The Notorious Canary Trainer\" (1945), \"Like Count Palmieri\" (1946).\n\nBoucher and Radio\n\nThe Sound of Detection: Ellery Queen's Adventures in Radio (2002), by Francis M. Nevins and Martin Grams, Jr., is a detailed history of the Ellery Queen radio program, with a complete listing of all the shows. It gives an account of Boucher's involvement with the program, to which he provided plot synopses. The book reprints three of Boucher's synopses, written for the Ellery Queen radio show, but never actually used.\n\nThe synopses are highly detailed. They include every aspect of the plot, from the initial set-up, to all of the sleuth's reasoning in uncovering the solution. Characters and backgrounds are defined. Some scenes are just a prose summary. But key scenes are fully dramatized, including dialogue. Dialogue that contains clues to the mystery or significant plot elements is especially spelled out in detail.\n\nOf the three synopses, two have good enough mystery elements to be worthy additions to Boucher's canon: \"The Adventure of May Tenth\", \"The Adventure of the Green-Eyed Murder\".\n\nPolitics\n\n\"The Smoke-filled Locked Room\" (published 1968) was written around 1950. It seems to show the influence of the best-known mainstream political novel of its day, Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men (1946). Both works go behind the scenes in political campaigns, both contain a tough but decent and vulnerable woman political operative, who supports the career of a male politician who ultimately betrays her and what he originally stood for. Both works end in tragedy.\n\nThe characters in \"The Smoke-filled Locked Room\" seem to be from the far left of the Democratic Party.\n\nBoucher would look at Communists in \"Death of a Patriarch\" (1943). The Case of the Baker Street Irregulars (1940) has a brief but pointed condemnation of Los Angeles' anti-Communist Red Squad, comparing it to Hitler's Gestapo (Chapter 7). There is also a discussion of Communism and the Sinclair Lewis campaign in California (end of Chapter 4), a campaign which gets a brief mention later (Chapter 14).\n\n\"The White Masters\" (1946) finds sleuth Gregory Hood going after a sinister Neo-Nazi organization.\n\nBoucher's politics are perhaps clearest and most detailed in The Case of the Solid Key (1941). His hero, sleuth Fergus O'Breen, attacks both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (Chapter 5). The book mentions the Ukrainian famine (end of Chapter 4): something that expresses anti-Stalinist politics.\n\nA play which represents the characters' political ideals says that their philosophy is essentially the same as Gandhi's philosophy of passive resistance (Chapter 2). Such Gandhian ideas might, however, be just part of Boucher's political beliefs, rather than a central premise of them all. The novel also idolizes a man who had been a pacifist during World War I (Chapter 3).\n\nPolitical action reaches a climax in The Case of the Solid Key (Chapter 12), when the good guys decide to run the theater as a cooperative.\n\nBut Boucher's left wing politics also have an eclectic aspect: The Case of the Solid Key also sympathizes with executed violent anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti (Chapter 3). So did many left-of-center people who did not share the pair's violent politics. A sympathetic playwright character uses Lillian Hellman's Days to Come (1936) as a model for one of his own plays (Chapter 3). Hellman was a Communist. The character's play is left wing, although it is not explicitly Communist.\n\nBoucher and Mystery Criticism\n\nAnthony Boucher wrote a vast amount of mystery criticism, from the early 1940's till his death in 1968. His writings are the foundation of most histories of mystery fiction of that period, and he is the most influential critic in modern mystery history. Just as Howard Haycraft's Murder For Pleasure (1941) was treated as a canon-defining look at the pre-1941 era, Boucher's critical writings set the tone for modern mystery reviewing. Boucher's early mystery criticism is now available as The Anthony Boucher Chronicles: Reviews and Commentary 1942 - 1947, edited by Francis M. Nevins. This 450 page volume can be ordered from its publisher Ramble House. It mainly contains brief reviews of hundreds of books and authors, including reprints of many works originally published before 1942.\n\nBoucher's influence began right away, in that many of the books he recommended became winners of the Edgar awards, the annual awards for mystery fiction presented by the Mystery Writers of America. Boucher also had two of the most influential pulpits in mystery reviewing: The New York Times (for general readership) and Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine (for hard core mystery fans). One might also point out that Howard Haycraft was a big admirer of Boucher, so that Boucher had the sponsorship of both Haycraft and Ellery Queen, the two best known American critics of the era immediately preceding his.\n\nBoucher was often the first writer to identify famous talent. He was the first translator of Borges into English, in the 1940's, nearly 20 years before anyone else outside of Argentina was aware of his existence. He championed Ross Macdonald as the leading private eye writer of the 1950's, a dozen years before Macdonald achieved mainstream fame in 1969. One might point out that when mainstream critics took these writers up in the 1960's, that they completely failed to mention Boucher's early championing of these authors. Boucher, like all mystery critics, was treated as a non-person by the mainstream establishment.\n\nBoucher started a tradition of separate but equal treatment of the many subgenres of crime fiction. A Boucher year-end round up of the best books of the year, will break the books down into categories such as classical puzzles, police procedurals, private eyes, suspense, spy fiction, comic mystery novels, social commentary novels, and so on, and cite the best books in each category. No one category of crime fiction will be privileged over any other by Boucher. He will suggest that good books in each subgenre are especially worthy of respect. However, Boucher will express personal affection for the classical puzzle. He will make clear that this is the most loved genre of crime fiction, by him at least, and his personal favorite. This will be presented as a personal taste, not a belief that puzzle fiction has greater objective merit than other approaches. This is a delicately nuanced approach to the proliferation of genres within mystery fiction today. It is precisely the approach that has been taken by several of today's mystery historians, such as Francis M. Nevins and Jon L. Breen.\n\nBoucher also strongly influenced the generation of mystery reviewers that came after him. Today's large annual convention of mystery fans is called the Bouchercon. Today's critic for Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, Jon L. Breen, writes in a format recognizably similar to Boucher's, and Breen's yearly round-ups in the Mystery Scene annuals recall Boucher's. Bill Pronzini and Marcia Muller's 1001 Midnights (1986) is a huge collection of reviews of mystery novels, most of them from the post-1941 era. It is the most accessible source of information on the 1941-1985 period, and has become a de facto canon of recommended books for that era. Again and again while reading it, one is struck by the fact that many of the books covered in it were first recommended by Boucher in his reviews. The collection reflects a cultural tradition first started by Boucher himself. I cannot imagine that any of the these writers will be offended by my suggestion that they write in the tradition of Boucher. I think they will take it as a compliment.\n\nNot all modern mystery critics are Boucher derived. Authors of large scale histories of mystery fiction, such as the great Encyclopedia of Mystery and Detection (1976), and the current Guide you are reading, were probably most influenced by earlier historians Haycraft, Queen, and their ancestor, S.S. Van Dine. I know that in my own case, I have wanted to write a history of mystery fiction ever since I read Van Dine's The World's Great Detective Stories (1928) as a child, a work I have read and reread with intense fascination ever since. The debt I owe all these earlier writers is huge. And a major strand of modern mystery criticism, the book length author biography cum critical study, is also largely independent of Boucher. Classics here include Norman Donaldson on R. Austin Freeman, Charles A. Norton on Melville Davisson Post, Francis M. Nevins on Ellery Queen and Cornell Woolrich, Jan Cohn on Mary Roberts Rinehart, Richard Layman on Dashiell Hammett, Frank MacShane on Raymond Chandler, John McAleer on Rex Stout, Patricia D. Maida on Anna Katherine Green, Roger Bonniot on Émile Gaboriau, and Douglas G. Greene on John Dickson Carr.\n\nMinorities and Civil Rights in mystery fiction\n\nVan Dine School: Pro Civil Rights. Anthony Boucher's sf story, \"Q.U.R.\" (1943), was the one of first to describe African-Americans gaining political prominence in the future: one of them is Head of the Council that governs Earth. This is like being the modern-day President of the United States, only including all of the planet Earth. Both that story's sequel, \"Robinc\", and The Case of the Solid Key, give early, sympathetic portraits of gay people. All of these depictions of minorities are astonishingly liberal for their time, and probably form the high water mark of integrationist treatments of minorities in genre fiction before the Civil Rights movement of the 1950's. A later sf tale, \"The Ambassadors\" (1951), treats civil rights issues in an allegorical fashion, with great wit and humor. \"Vacancy with Corpse\" (1946) (Chapter 5) has a sympathetic character giving a speech praising tolerance and love.\n\nBoucher was a protégé of Ellery Queen, and hence a member of the Van Dine school. This school showed a continuing interest in a more equal treatment of minorities in its fiction:\n\nThis starts with S.S. Van Dine in The \"Canary\" Murder Case (1927), where the detective actually congratulates the Canary's black maid on her intelligence, a startling comment with political implications at the time, when so many black people were depicted in the racist literature of the day as of low mentality. In The Kennel Murder Case (1933), Philo Vance's egalitarian regard of a Chinese witness is contrasted to the racist stereotypes of the day, which are satirized as they fall from the lips of the low brow Sgt. Heath.\n\nKennel is probably the model for Rex Stout's Too Many Cooks (1938), in which his detective Nero Wolfe has a memorable encounter, in Chapters 10 and 11, with a group of black waiters who are possible witnesses to a crime. Stout later served as a leader of a World War II writer's group, whose goal was to promote non-stereotyped treatment of minorities in the media. See also its Civil Rights era sequel A Right To Die (1964). Stout's detectives Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin often seem to have a gay subtext. James Howard Wellard's The Snake in the Grass (1942), a novel likely influenced by Rex Stout, has a pointed look at black waiters and the oppression they face. Anthony Abbot's About the Murder of the Circus Queen (1932) has a sympathetically described tribe of Ubangis. His \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" (1932) looks at violent injustices done to blacks by the police. \"About the Disappearance of Agatha King\" also has a white man suspect who loves another man. Ellery Queen introduced realistic African-American characters in such early tales as \"The African Traveler\" (1934) and \"The House of Darkness\" (1935), as well as such later books as The Murderer Is a Fox (1945) and Cat of Many Tails (1949). Tiller in The Spanish Cape Mystery (1935) is a highly positive portrayal of a man of mixed Asian and European ancestry. \"The Telltale Bottle\" (1946; based on a 1939 radio play) has respectful treatment of Native Americans. There are signs of a gay subtext in Ellery Queen. Helen Reilly has brief hints that her series sleuth Inspector McKee might be gay. See: Murder in the Mews (1931) (Chapter 1), The Line-Up (1934) (Chapters 1, 15), Dead Man Control (1936) (Chapters 4, 6), All Concerned Notified (1939) (Chapters 1, end of 16), Death Demands an Audience (1940) (Chapter 7), The Dead Can Tell (start of Chapter 1). Her Murder in Shinbone Alley (1940) offers a non-stereotyped look at a mentally disabled man. It emphasizes his human worth, and problems as a member of the working poor. Clyde B. Clason focused on sympathetic depictions of Tibetans and Chinese respectively in The Man from Tibet (1938) and Green Shiver (1941); both novels are explicitly anti-racist. There are hints that Clason's series sleuth Theocritus Lucius Westborough might be gay. Rufus King has many thinly veiled gay characters, in books like Murder by Latitude (1930), The Lesser Antilles Case (1934), Murder Masks Miami (1939), and Lethal Lady (1947). Idealized male characters in Crime of Violence (1937) and A Variety of Weapons (1942) also reflect a gay sensibility. And on race: the black butler is treated highly positively in \"The Case of the Lonely Ladies\" (1940?). King's series detective Lt. Valcour expresses distaste for ethnic humor and the stereotyped foreign villains of fiction in Murder by the Clock (1929). John T. McIntyre, a Van Dine School precursor, drops broad hints that his series sleuth is gay, in the opening of Ashton-Kirk: Investigator (1910). Ngaio Marsh attacked anti-Semitism in Death in a White Tie (1938), and gave a sympathetic portrait of Maori culture in New Zealand in Colour Scheme (1943).\n\nThe comic detective writer Stuart Palmer has a satirical chapter in The Puzzle of the Happy Hooligan (1941), in which it is made clear that a black servant is far more intelligent and sensible that the ditzy group of white suspects he has to watch over. Palmer would go on to an endorsement of the Civil Rights movement in The Green Ace (1950).\n\nCraig Rice has the series character Max Hook, the Chicago gambling czar, in her mystery-comedy books starting with The Wrong Murder (1940). Although it is not explicit, Hook seems to be gay. Rice created the plot for the film Underworld Story (1950) in which a black woman is falsely accused of murder. Hulbert Footner regularly included sexy men in his mysteries. Some tales can be interpreted as showing other men attracted to these men, in a gay way: \"The Ashcomb Poor Case\" (1922), Who Killed the Husband? (1941) (middle of Chapter 6), The House With the Blue Door (1942) (Chapter 1). Richard Burke has sympathetic non-stereotyped Chinese-American characters in Chinese Red (1942). George Bagby in In Cold Blood (1948) criticizes the racial prejudice a sympathetic black character faces; Give the Little Corpse a Great Big Hand (1953) extends this critique. The Real Serendipitous Kill (1964) has a sympathetic Chinese woman teacher of calligraphy. The article discusses the extensive gay subtext in Bagby's work. Francis and Richard Lockridge include a Jewish police detective and a taxi driver among their supporting characters in A Pinch of Poison (1941). Later they created a long series starring Jewish detective Nathan Shapiro, starting with The Faceless Adversary (1956), Murder and Blueberry Pie (1959). They offer a satiric look at both race and class in Accent on Murder (1958). Despite its light comic tone, it includes approving mentions of the NAACP. Harry Kemelman helped pioneer Jewish detectives with his novels about sleuth Rabbi David Small, starting with Friday the Rabbi Slept Late (1964). Patricia McGerr has her heroine support the Civil Rights movement in Is There a Traitor in the House? (1964). Lillian de la Torre wrote the anti-slavery tale \"The Blackamoor Unchain'd\" (1974) in The Return of Dr. Sam: Johnson, Detector.\n\nHIBK School. Mary Roberts Rinehart usually treated the black characters in her novels realistically, without any of the stereotypes or cheap humor some authors of the period favored. The Had I But Known (HIBK) writers of the Rinehart school often followed suit. Among Rinehart's followers, Dorothy Cameron Disney's The Balcony (1940) is especially notable for its trenchant treatment of racial issues. Leslie Ford's Murder with Southern Hospitality (1941-1942) looks at police persecution of blacks in the South. Ford's detective Colonel Primrose has a gay subtext.\n\nHIBK writers pioneered in positive portraits of lesbian detectives:\n\nMignon G. Eberhart comes close to having her series detective Sarah Keate be openly lesbian in the short story \"Dead Yesterday\" (1936). Anne Nash has a thinly veiled lesbian couple as heroines in Said with Flowers (1943).\n\nMuch earlier Anna Katherine Green has a lesbian dimension in her archetypal spinster sleuth Amelia Butterworth, in her debut case That Affair Next Door (1897).\n\nMary Roberts Rinehart in The Great Mistake (1940) (Chapter 2) has her heroine describe how she \"fell madly in love with\" another woman. Earlier she describes how she \"fell for\" a different woman (Chapter 1). The close friendship between two men is described as \"love\" in The Swimming Pool (1952) (first part of Chapter 16).\n\nHard-Boiled. There is a tendency today for some critics to regard the Van Dine school as artificial, and the hard-boiled school of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler as realistic. Be that as it may, the admirable and pioneering treatment of race by the Van Dine school contrasts with the racism of the two best-known early hard-boiled writers. Hammett's The Dain Curse (1928) shows an unfortunate acceptance of the stereotypes of the day, whereas the more vicious Chandler positively wallows in hatred in The High Window (1942).\n\nDuring the 1950's some hard-boiled writers became far more positive in depicting racial minorities:\n\nJack Webb pioneered Jewish detectives with his series about the team of Jewish policeman Sammy Golden and Catholic Father Joseph Shanley, starting with The Big Sin (1952). (Webb is not to be confused with the actor-director of the TV show Dragnet). There also is a possible gay subtext in these books.\n\nSome liberal private eye writers wrote sympathetically about black people and Civil Rights, notably Ed Lacy in Room to Swing (1957), and Kendell Foster Crossen in A Hearse of a Different Color (1958). Crossen's comic book story \"The Four Freedoms\" (Green Lama #5, May 1945) is a landmark Civil Rights tale that denounces both Jim Crow and anti-semitism.\n\nJ. Lane Linklater in Shadow for a Lady (1947) (start of Chapter 11) offers a brief but pointed denunciation of the awful housing black people were forced to live in.\n\nHard-boiled writers sometimes included gay feelings into their work. While rarely explicitly labeling such feelings as \"gay\", there are often vivid queer subtexts:\n\nDashiell Hammett often centered his works on male relationships. Erle Stanley Gardner has a Chinese heroine in his thriller short story \"The House of Three Candles\" (1938). A number of his characters seem like thinly disguised gay men, including his series detective Sidney Zoom and attorney A.B. Carr. George Harmon Coxe has much male bonding in his fiction, which might or might not have a gay subtext. Roland Phillips sometimes depicts men with strong feelings for other men, as in \"Death Lies Waiting\" (1944). Harold Q. Masur has his detective Scott Jordan display what might be a gay side in You Can't Live Forever (1951), The Big Money (1954), Tall, Dark and Deadly (1956).\n\nOther Americans. Other important early treatments of Civil Rights in American mystery fiction include:\n\nT. S. Stribling, who offered a savagely satirical look at Southern race relations in \"Bullets\" (1932). Norbert Davis took satiric aim at Mexican stereotypes in The Mouse in the Mountain (1943). William MacHarg included a non-stereotyped black character in his story \"The Right Gun\" (1939), in The Affairs of O'Malley (collected 1940).\n\nSo did Clarence Budington Kelland in The Key Man (1951).\n\nMrs. Wilson Woodrow includes sympathetic characters who are likely Jewish in \"Atchison Always Wins!\" (1930) and Pawns of Murder (1932). Ruth Sawtell Wallis shows racial integration of blacks and whites quietly taking place in Too Many Bones (1943). Frances Crane has a sympathetic Chinese-American desk clerk in The Yellow Violet (1942). Helen Wells included a sympathetic nursing student who is Chinese in Cherry Ames, Student Nurse (1943). E.C. Marshall has a sympathetic Chinese policeman hero in his short story \"The High-Powered Corpse\" (1946). Frederick Irving Anderson might show a gay subtext. Milton M. Propper displayed a gay sensibility in books like The Strange Disappearance of Mary Young (1929) and The Student Fraternity Murder (1932). A continuing supporting character, Inspector Goldman, is a respectful treatment of a Jewish policeman in books like The Great Insurance Murders (1937). Christopher Hale's Hangman's Tie (1943) suggests its heroine is lesbian. Cornell Woolrich included both sympathetic black characters and attacks on racism in his work. \"If the Shoe Fits\" (1943) and \"The Blue Ribbon\" (1949) show a gay subtext. Allan Vaughan Elston has what might be a gay detective hero in his Western-mystery \"Mutiny on the Box Cross\" (1940).\n\nCyril M. Kornbluth included sympathetic minority characters, such as the Puerto Rican scientific genius in \"Gomez\" (1954). He discussed women's issues in \"A Ghoul and His Money\" (1946). He is discussed elsewhere in this article.\n\nIsaac Asimov's science fiction work (which often has mystery elements) regularly features gay and sometimes transgender themes. He is discussed elsewhere in this article with a section on his LGBTQ subjects. Asimov looks at racial prejudice in Pebble in the Sky (1950).\n\nDorothy Gardiner's detective Sheriff Moss Magill might have a gay side. Lawrence Treat has a lesbian express pride in her relationship in his short story \"B as in Bludgeon\" (1974).\n\nThe British. Some British writers were antisemitic. But others offered positive depictions of Jews:\n\nA. Fielding's The Footsteps that Stopped (1926). Freeman Wills Crofts' The Box Office Murders (1929). Anthony Gilbert's Death at Four Corners (1929). E.C.R. Lorac's The Case of Colonel Marchand (1933). Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male (1939).\n\nSome British writers' fiction deals positively with gays:\n\nArthur Conan Doyle's archetypal detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson can be seen as a gay or romantic couple. J.S. Fletcher often has a gay subtext. Agatha Christie included gay characters, most positively in The Labors of Hercules (1939 - 1940) which suggests her detective Poirot is gay, and \"Three Blind Mice\" (1948). E.R. Punshon includes satire and comedy that might have a gay subtext.\n\nArthur C. Clarke has strong gay subtexts in science fiction mystery tales like Against the Fall of Night and \"The Wall of Darkness\". He is discussed elsewhere in this article with a section on his LGBTQ subjects.\n\nBruce Buckingham has a likely lesbian character in Boiled Alive (1957). Mary Kelly has her private eye hero express disgust with the then-common use of detectives to spy on and expose gay men in The Spoilt Kill (1961).\n\nDisabled Characters. Positive depictions of disabled characters:\n\nHugh MacNair Kahler has his hero break his arm on the job, and be fired without compensation in \"Queer Coin\" (1920). Howard McLellan looks at compensation for a policeman disabled in the line of duty in \"The Moll-Trap\" (1929). Ellery Queen's sleuth Drury Lane is deaf. He appeared in four books (1932-1933). Helen Reilly respectfully depicts a mentally disabled man, part of the \"working poor\", in Murder in Shinbone Alley (1940). Zelda Popkin has her detective hero be a Navy doctor injured in World War II who wears a leg brace in So Much Blood (1944). Earl Schenck Miers has his detective hero be a disabled polio survivor who has rebuilt his life in The Christmas Card Murders (1951).\n\nBlind Detectives. My Syllabus on Mystery Fiction has a section on Blind Detectives.\n\nComic Books. My list of Political and Social Commentary Tales in Comic Books has much about positive presentations of minorities.\n\nGay Films. My list of best fiction LGBTQ Films.\n\nTV Westerns. My list of Television Westerns on Civil Rights.\n\nNative American Detectives. Please see (external to this site) Steve Lewis' list of Native American Detectives.\n\nWoman Detectives. Please see (external to this site) Bob Schneider's list of Woman Detectives.\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois was a scholar, famous for his non-fiction writings on race relations, history and sociology. But he also wrote fiction, including some science fiction.\n\nThe Comet: a short story\n\n\"The Comet\" (1920) is an excellent post-disaster tale. It is in the tradition of Jack London's \"The Scarlet Plague\" (1912) and Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Poison Belt\" (1913).\n\nAs in \"The Poison Belt\", the disaster in \"The Comet\" is due to an astronomical phenomenon through which the Earth is temporarily passing. In both tales, people shut up in isolated rooms survive. In \"The Poison Belt\" people also need oxygen tanks survive, a feature not found in \"The Comet\".\n\n\"The Scarlet Plague\" had explored elements of class. \"The Comet\" looks at class as well. But its deepest looks are at race relations, with W. E. B. Du Bois offering a trenchant look at both racism and what might replace it.\n\nIt is reprinted in The Big Book of Science Fiction (2016) edited by Ann VanderMeer and Jeff VanderMeer.\n\nRokheya Shekhawat Hossain\n\nRokheya Shekhawat Hossain was a Bengali writer and advocate for women's education. Her named is spelled several different ways in English, including Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, and she is also known as Begum Rokeya.\n\nSultana's Dream: a short story\n\n\"Sultana's Dream\" (1905) is a brief but well done feminist Utopia. It anticipates Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland (1915).\n\nIt is reprinted in The Big Book of Science Fiction (2016) edited by Ann VanderMeer and Jeff VanderMeer. And is available free online.\n\n\"Sultana's Dream\" is a genuine Utopia, in that it shows a good society emerging purely from a change in social organization. There are no biological changes to humans.\n\n\"Sultana's Dream\" centers on one social change: allowing women to be educated and take on jobs in science and technology. It argues, quite plausibly, that such changes will improve society.\n\n\"Sultana's Dream\" is unusual among Utopian fiction in that its society does NOT:\n\nRequire uniformity of belief or action among its citizens, to succeed.\n\nRequire heroic restrictions on human behavior or selfishness, to succeed.\n\n\"Sultana's Dream\" simply suggests that female education and employment would improve society. It doesn't require that women (or men) act selflessly, abandon individuality or all march to the same drummer. This is quite different from a good deal of Utopian writing.\n\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman\n\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman, the noted feminist and economist, wrote several Utopian works.\n\nHerland\n\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman's most famous Utopian novel is Herland (1915).\n\nHerland shares some broad approaches with an earlier science fiction novel, A Crystal Age (1887) by W.H. Hudson. Both show:\n\nBiological change happening to humans, that affects reproduction. Neither is a \"pure Utopia\" focussing exclusively on new social organization.\n\nWomen running much of society.\n\nSocieties where sexual activity and desire are greatly decreased, compared with real-life human societies.\n\nEconomist Gilman is often shrewd in her critiques of present-day male / capitalist society. She backs up her depiction with statistics and a knowing look at its drawbacks and failures. She is less convincing in her bald assertions that women and socialism would do a better job. Often times, she offers no evidence at all for her assertions.\n\nEugenics has a very bad history - and seen today, the advocacy of eugenics in Herland is a major failing. The book's stance, pro-eugenics and anti-abortion, recalls that of a famous film of the era Where Are My Children? (Lois Weber, 1916).\n\nUnpunished\n\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman wrote only one detective novel, Unpunished (1929). Her story shows similarities with both Anna Katherine Green and Isabel Ostrander. Links to Ostrander:\n\nAs in Ostrander, Gilman's heroes are mainly private detectives, vigorous but non-hard-boiled New York City sleuths who enthusiastically track down criminals.\n\nThe detective heroine of Gilman goes undercover as a maid in the murder house; this is similar to the detective in Ostrander's The Tattooed Arm (1922) working undercover as a footman.\n\nThere are multiple murder methods employed in this book; these show some similarity to the double crime in Ostrander's The Crimson Blotter (1922), although Gilman's crime is far more elaborate and complex.\n\nThe basic set-up of Unpunished is not too different from Ostrander's At One-Thirty (1915). Similarities:\n\nThe master of the house murdered one night in his study, while his very unhappy and emotionally troubled extended family swirls all about him.\n\nOstrander's novel has a feminist theme of domestic abuse, which is also found in Gilman's.\n\nSPOILERS. The respectable seeming master of the house is in fact deep in criminal schemes, in both books.\n\nServants are treated as suspects in both novels, and are caught up in the criminal schemes of the master of the house.\n\nSuspects abscond clues from the murder scene in both Gilman's and Ostrander's novel, as well.\n\nAnna Katherine Green-like features of the story include:\n\nThe listening devices that allow people in the upstairs room to eavesdrop on the floor below.\n\nThe little old lady neighbor who helps the detectives by spying on the house through her window, recalls Green's Miss Amelia Butterworth in That Affair Next Door (1899).\n\nThe long flashback describing the evolution of the personal relationships that led up to the murder is also a feature common in Green, and in Gaboriau before.\n\nR. A. Lafferty\n\nR. A. Lafferty is a prolific writer of comic, surrealistic science fiction extravaganzas. His short stories are generally much better than his novels. He is perhaps most admired for the short stories he wrote 1966-1974. Lafferty's first four short story collections are especially important:\n\nNine Hundred Grandmothers Strange Doings Does Anyone Else Have Something Further to Add? Ringing Changes\n\nThere are also many good tales in the recent omnibus The Best of R. A. Lafferty.\n\n\"Enfants Terribles\": a short story\n\nHis non-science-fiction mystery short story \"Enfants Terribles\" (1971) falls within our genre. It has mystery, but no science fiction whatsoever.\n\nAll sources agree that this tale was first published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine (June 1971). But the blog Continued on Next Rock also says the writing of the tale was finished in December 1959. It then failed to get published until 1971, over a decade later.\n\nA Detective Story. \"Enfants Terribles\" is a full formal detective story. That is, it has a crime, investigation and a solution, with the case solved by detective characters. Further, \"Enfants Terribles\" is a good detective tale, with an ingenious, clever solution. And some not-bad reasoning by the sleuths. \"Enfants Terribles\" also benefits from the lively characterization, of a large cast of characters. It is thus an example of my definition of a good traditional detective story: \"a clever mystery plot wrapped in good storytelling\".\n\nSchools of Mystery Fiction. \"Enfants Terribles\" has some features of the Van Dine School:\n\nBrilliant amateur detectives working in collaboration with police who are good at standard police investigation techniques.\n\nA team of several policemen.\n\nAnd features of the intuitionists, the larger group that contains the Van Dine School:\n\nMystery puzzle plots.\n\nEccentric amateur detectives.\n\nContinuous focus on detection throughout story.\n\nCharacters. Very smart kids were a Lafferty subject: see his sf tale \"The Primary Education of the Camiroi\" (1966).\n\nRay Bradbury\n\nRay Bradbury published around a dozen tales in mystery pulp magazines in the 1940's, in between his much larger careers as a fantasy and mainstream writer. \"Yesterday I Lived!\" (1944) is a well done tale of mystery on a Hollywood film set. Not surprisingly for Bradbury, the tale is very well written. It also has a good puzzle plot. The article on Karl W. Detzer describes how many of Bradbury's contemporaries were also publishing film set mysteries. Unlike Detzer's, which shows signs of the realist school, Bradbury's is more in a puzzle plot, intuitionist mode.\n\nIsaac Asimov\n\nEven before his official entry into the mystery scene in The Caves Of Steel (1953), Isaac Asimov's science fiction books often exhibited mystery techni"
