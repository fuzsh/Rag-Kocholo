The splash panel portrait of the transformed hero in his football uniform is impressive. His uniform is red and white, like that of so many Infantino heroes, and has the number 9 all over it. The number 9 on the helmet even shows up in a later silhouette illustration; it is strongly identified with the hero throughout the story. Photo. Photo.\n\nComic book heroes often have such single digit numbers on their uniforms, usually one with a strong, straight vertical line, such as 1, 4, 7 or 9. These numbers serve as phallic symbols, and celebrate the heroes' masculinity.\n\nOther tales in the same series Strange Sports Stories have similar numbers:\n\n\"The Hot-Shot Hoopsters\" (The Brave and the Bold #46, February-March 1963) has basketball players with such numbers. Joey Bender is #19, Eddie Tryon is #9, Tommy Felton is #14. Players on the opposing team include #79 and #17. The main team are in more of Infantino's red-and-white uniforms.\n\n\"Challenge of the Headless Baseball Team\" (The Brave and the Bold #45, December 1962-January 1963) has it baseball pitcher hero Lefty as #7, a teammate as #19, and the villainous other team includes #7, #9, #11 and #17.\n\nOther players in \"Goliath of the Gridiron\" are 4, 7, 11, 17, 19. All team uniforms have numbers on them, but no names. The opposing team on the splash have flanges on their helmets: something far more common in comic book heroes than in real-life football teams. These guys are 11 and 17. The hero's number 9 is a rectilinearly styled number: it is high tech looking, perhaps linked to computers. The splash shows all the football players on the hero's team in cleated black leather uniform shoes. These return in the story (pages 5, 8, 9).\n\nHaving sports heroes wear such numbers is an ancient tradition in comics:\n\nComic strip ad \"Dexter Scores a Victory\" (1936) shows its college football player hero wearing number 7 on his jersey. Later he has an R on his sweater. (This strip, signed Paul Arthur, is reproduced in color in Ron Goulart's Encyclopedia of Comics.)\n\nEarly comic book sports hero Pep Morgan is #7 on his baseball team in \"Glass Arm\" (Action Comics #2, July 1938), and number 7 on his basketball team in \"The Intercity Basketball Tournament\" (Action Comics #10, March 1939), two stories with art by Fred Guardineer.\n\n\"Rip\" Rory, a four letter man at State College, is #11 on his basketball team (Target Comics Vol. 1 No. 3, April 1940), and #11 again on the track team in next month's issue (Target Comics Vol. 1 No. 4, May 1940). (Rip also wears a double-breasted suit and swirling long coat over it, in the manner of Alex Raymond's comic strip hero, Secret Agent X-9.)\n\nThe non-fiction sports series Queer Championships by George Papp features basketball player #9 (Champion Comics #3, January 1940). See also a phallic depiction of famous football star Red Grange (Champion Comics #7, May 1940), and of a man carrying a fish (Champion Comics #2, December 1939).\n\nA baseball player is #7 in the Johnny Quick tale \"Meet Mr. Zero, the man of a million murders, as he races Johnny Quick\" (More Fun Comics #75, January 1942). Art: Jerry Robinson.\n\nCrooks wear football uniforms #7 and #14, and racehorses are #4 and #7, in the Slam Bradley tale \"Refuge for Ruffians\" (Detective Comics #80, October 1943).\n\nKit Carter, the Cadet, is #44 on his football team (4Most Comics Vol. 5 No. 4, Fall 1946), a teammate is #1 and opposing team members are #7 and #17. Cover by Nina Albright, story art by Walter Johnson. He is #44 on his baseball team at Daunton (Target Comics Vol. 9 No. 5, July 1948), with art by Nina Albright.\n\n\"Danger: Prejudice at Work\" is a one-page public service message, attacking racism. Its hero is a baseball player, #17, who promotes integration. Writer: Jack Schiff. Art: Ruben Moreira. It appeared in numerous DC comic books, such as Showcase #10, September-October 1957, and Batman #110, September 1957.\n\nTeen-age hero Binky wears a sweater with the number 7 on his chest, in \"Binky Says 'Family Projects Can be Fun!'\" (Adventure #214, July 1955). The Binky series consisted of one-page public service messages, giving teens life-style advice. Binky was the handsome high school hero who had his act together. This is one of the best of the series; it shows us continuing character Allergy's family, all of whom look a lot like him, kind hearted and goofy.\n\nA baseball player is #4 in the Green Arrow tale \"The Amazing Arrowthon\" (Adventure Comics #204, September 1954). Art: George Papp.\n\nThe hero of \"The Human Homing Pigeon\" (Strange Adventures #69, June 1956) wears 49 on his football uniform. Members of the opposite team are 7 and 17. Art: Sid Greene.\n\nThe hero of \"Super-Athlete from Earth\" (Strange Adventures #125, February 1961) daydreams of success as a football player and basketball star. He wears #7 in both roles. He evades a tackle by player #4. Art; Gil Kane.\n\nThe football player is #77 in \"Raiders of the Waterless World\" (Mystery in Space #56, December 1959). Art: Gil Kane. In real life #77 was famous as the number of Red Grange, a major football pioneer.\n\nComic strip \"Big George!\" (January 5, 1963) by Virgil Partch shows basketball player #7.\n\nThe Silver Age tales of The Flash often featured players who were #7. Art by Carmine Infantino:\n\nThe runner in \"The Amazing Race Against Time\" (The Flash #107, July 1959) is #7 on Infantino's cover.\n\nHero Wally West (Kid Flash) is #7 on his high school basketball team in \"The Challenge of the Crimson Crows\" (The Flash #111, February-March 1960).\n\nThe winner of the state track meet is runner #7 in \"King of the Beatniks\" (The Flash #114, August 1960).\n\nAt a costume party a man is baseball player #7 (page 9) and a football player has a large T on his chest (page 12) in \"Double Danger on Earth\" (The Flash #129, June 1962).\n\nJimmy Olsen has stories with such numbers. Writer: Otto Binder, Art: Curt Swan:\n\nThe magician is contestant #9 in in \"The King of Magic\" (Jimmy Olsen #6, July-August 1955).\n\nSuperman gives a demonstration to Metropolis football player #17 in \"The Birdboy of Metropolis\" (Jimmy Olsen #26, February 1958).\n\nA baseball player is #17 in \"The Million-Dollar Mistakes\" (Jimmy Olsen #39, September 1959).\n\nA waiter is #17 in \"The Irresistible Jimmy Olsen\" (Jimmy Olsen #46, July 1960). (This tale's writer is Robert Bernstein.)\n\nJimmy goes undercover as waiter #7 in \"The Disguises of Danger\" (Jimmy Olsen #48, October 1960). (This tale's writer is not known.)\n\nDick Cole is usually number 9 in his many sports stories, courtesy of artists Bob Davis before 1942, Jim Wilcox after 1943:\n\nHis uniform has #9 shoulder patches, at the start of his first tale \"Origin of Dick Cole\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 1 No. 1, June 1940).\n\nA different uniform has #9 shoulder patches, at the start of \"The Stolen Formula\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 1 No. 3, August 1940).\n\nDick is #4 on his hockey team, and a teammate is #11 in \"Gangsters and Hockey\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 1 No. 9, February 1941).\n\nDick is #4 on his football team, and his friend Simba is #7 in \"Clear, crisp autumn days are here\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 2 No. 6, November 1941).\n\nDick is #4 on his hockey team, in \"The hockey season has descended upon Farr\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 3 No. 7, December 1942).\n\nWhen playing basketball in \"The basketball season is in full swing\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 5 No. 7, April 1945), Dick Cole is number 9, and his equally handsome rival Bark Hall is number 7.\n\nDick is #9 again playing basketball in \"With only the big Farr-Holden game remaining\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 7 No. 10, March 1947), with a teammate #7, while opponents are #1 and #7. (His cheating, unsportsman-like opponent Wesley Wimple has a less macho number we can't fully see.)\n\nDick is #9 on his lacrosse team in \"John Eaglewing, an old Indian, instructs Farr M.A.\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 8 No. 2, July 1947).\n\nWhen running in \"Dick Cole, winner of last year's cross-country race\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 8 No. 4, September 1947), Dick Cole is number 9, other runners are #4 and #7, and his opponent is #1.\n\nThe cover depicting a soccer game (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 6 No. 5, November 1945) shows Dick as number 9, while his macho opponents from another school are numbers 1, 4 and 7. The inside tale \"Our story opens in a fourth form room at Farr Military Academy\" has Dick playing goal for his soccer team, and wearing number 1; his teammate Slip'ry is #19; his teammate Simba is #11, and is attacked by an opponent in #4; teammates are 4 and 7; the opponents also include 1, 7, 9, 11 and 14. This is one of the rare soccer stories in US comics history.\n\nWhile playing basketball again in \"The opening of the huge new gymnasium is a gala event\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 8 No. 11, April 1948), in a story by artist Jack Hearne, Dick Cole is number 9, another player is #1, and we see teammates of his in the story's last page wearing 4 and 7. In these last two stories, Bark Hall has been demoted to less macho numbers, being #5 or #6.\n\nAnd when Dick Cole goes to Arizona in \"Farr Military Academy, its campus buildings totally destroyed by fire\" (Blue Bolt Comics Vol. 8 No. 8, January 1948), he is rescued by the football team of Sagebrush High; they wear #19, #11, #97 and #4.\n\nNumbers show up in romance comic books, worn by glamorous heroes:\n\nSee artist Jay Scott Pike's \"Play With Fire\" (Girls' Love Stories #178, July - August 1973), where the biker hero's uniform is number 7. Pike's is one of the sharpest uniforms in the comics.\n\nThe champion motorcycle racer of writer-artist Ric Estrada's \"Wheels of Passion\" (Young Romance #162, October - November 1969) wears the number 9 on his black leather uniform while racing. Off the course, he wears sharp business suits while interfacing with his corporate sponsor.\n\nThe seductive motorcyclist in \"Ashamed of Her Love\" (Falling in Love #96, January 1968) has license plate 712.\n\nThe romantic quarterback Dan Casey in artist Art Saaf's \"Enemies in Love\" (Falling in Love #141, June - July 1973) also wears a giant number 7 on his football uniform. He's irresistible to the heroine, even though she's a cheerleader of a rival school's team.\n\nBob Brown also drew Smallville High quarterback \"Bash\" Bradford with the number 7 on his football uniform, in \"The Strange Death of Superboy\" (Superboy #161, December 1969). As in Infantino's \"Goliath of the Gridiron\", these are red uniforms with white numbers. The football players have the extreme muscles of the 1970 era in comics, and virtually look like a group of super-beings. We first see \"Bash\" (p2), where he is triumphing over a player from the opposing team, who is dressed in a blue uniform, with the number 12 on it. In a second game (p14), we see one of Bash's teammates, who is equally good looking, and who wears the number 4. Once again, #7 and #4 are associated with heroes. In the film Starship Troopers (1997), the hero wears number 7 for his team, and he fights an opposing team member in blue wearing number 12, just as in Brown's story.\n\nSuch numbers continue to appear in later \"graphic novels\":\n\nThe heroine's brother is #79 on his football jersey in Thom Zahler's Love and Capes, Vol.1 (2008).\n\nNon-comics illustrators also use such numbers:\n\nC. Hayes Sprague's cover of the magazine The Pacific Monthly (April 1906) shows a racecar with a giant 7 on its front. Photo.\n\nAlbin Henning's cover of the magazine The American Boy (Vol 112 #11, November 1938) shows a football player who is #7.\n\nThe cover of the pulp magazine 12 Sports Aces (Vol 1 #2, December 1938) shows football player #7 making a tackle. His deep blue uniform has white lettering, trim and helmet.\n\nThe cover of the pulp magazine Complete Sports (Vol 2 #4, January 1939) shows football player #4 making a tackle. The players are leather-helmeted.\n\nThe short story \"The 99th Stitch\" (Collier's, March 4, 1939) by B.B. Fowler shows hockey players #14 and #4 (as well as #3), illustrated by Earl Cordrey.\n\nThe cover of 12 Sports Aces (Vol 2 #2, September 1939) shows baseball pitcher #9.\n\nThe cover of 12 Sports Aces (Vol 7 #2, January 1943) shows hockey player #7 in a spectacular red uniform with yellow lettering and trim. The uniform has a ring of stars around his neck, yellow circles on his legs, big yellow-ish gauntlets, and huge black lace-up hockey skates. He's yelling aggressively, and his yellow hair and yellow hockey stick echo the yellow on his uniform.\n\nThe cover of Ace Sports (Vol 16 #2, January 1948) reuses the same cover painting. Art: Norman Saunders.\n\nThe cover of Complete Sports (Vol 4 #3, November 1942) shows football player #76. His patriotic uniform echoes the US Flag: something fairly common in pulp covers. Art: Norman Saunders.\n\nThe cover of Complete Sports (Vol 5 #2, January 1947) shows football player #77. His patriotic uniform echoes the US Flag. It seems like a variation of the Complete Sports 1942 cover. It has an American Eagle on the helmet, while the earlier uniform displayed pilot's wings. #77 was the real life number of famous football star Red Grange.\n\nThe cover of Complete Sports (Vol 7 #10, November 1951) shows a baseball player uniformed as #1, leaning on his bat.\n\nThe cover of Complete Sports (Vol 8 #3, January 1953) shows football player #47. His red uniform has white lettering.\n\nA magazine ad (1941) for Seagram's 7 Crown shows a champion swimmer at a meet, in lane 7.\n\nRegionalist painter John Steuart Curry did a number of drawings and paintings of college football. An All-American (1941) has opposing team members wearing #49 and #14. #49 has a well developed rear end, like the well-built farmer in Curry's The Tornado, and the circus aerialist in The Flying Codonas.\n\nThe baseball player wears #9 in Norman Rockwell's illustration, The Peephole (1955).\n\nThe football player on the paperback cover of Come Monday Mornin' (1976) by Chris Loken wears a giant white #2 on his green jersey.\n\nThe marathon walker on the original paperback cover of The Long Walk (1979) by \"Richard Bachman\" (Stephen King) is #47.\n\nJim Matthewuse's cover art for the paperback The Nancy Drew Files Case 45: Out of Bounds (1990) shows a muscular, big-necked football player suited up as #7. His jersey is bright blue, with a giant white 7.\n\nThe anthology Fifty years of great writing: Sports Illustrated, 1954-2004 (2003) has a jacket photo of a football quarterback who is #19. The clean cut white uniforms with horseshoe helmets suggest the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nA store display for soft drinks (2012) shows two guys photographed in identically styled baby-blue football jerseys, watching a game on TV. One is pointing his arm and finger and is #4. The other is sitting receptively and is #50 on his chest and sleeves. The black numbers use a high-tech looking font, and the shiny jerseys recall the \"extreme\" football outfits that are a current craze.\n\nThe New York Times article \"Hut! Hut! Hut! What?\" (January 31, 2018) has an illustration by Chris Morris showing quarterback #14 yelling \"Hut!\"\n\nComplete Sports liked covers showing a boxer in red trunks knocking out or winning over a boxer in green or blue trunks. (Nothing to do with numbers.)\n\nContemporary artist Kurt Lundqvist paints idealized portraits of athletes. He sometimes uses such numbers:\n\nA baseball card-like painting of \"John Barnes\" has him in a shiny gray baseball jacket holding a matching gray bat. The bat is marked B9. The gray jacket has brilliant red-and-yellow patches and trim. It is uniform-like in its precise positioning of such insignia.\n\n\"Jack Afield\" shows a soccer star in shiny dark-gray shorts with a yellow #9 in athletic-style lettering. Gray is a favorite Lundqvist color, and he uses it where fashion would often suggest black. The satin-like fabric of the shorts is smooth. The star's soccer shirt has vertical yellow and gleaming red stripes. The red stripes have a rubber look.\n\n\"Footwork\". A soccer player is #7 on the side of his uniform shorts. He has a leg up and is balancing a soccer ball on his foot. His uniform shoes are highly cleated.\n\n\"It Must\". A dejected football player is #79 on the front of his jersey, in two shades of brown.\n\nA football player is red-and-yellow #78 on his light gray jersey. His red pants match the red of the number.\n\n\"The Art of Throwing a Javelin\". A javelin thrower is #17.\n\nProse fiction uses such numbers:\n\nStar football player Griff Clark is #17 in Coffin Corner (1949) (end of Chapter 1), a mystery novel by George Bagby. 17 is described as Clark's \"famous number\", and he wears it on sweat shirts when not on the field.\n\nPolice cars #7 and #19 report to the crime scene in The Case of the Grinning Gorilla (1952) (Chapters: end of 7, start of 8), a Perry Mason mystery novel by Erle Stanley Gardner.\n\nSports Numbers in Film\n\nFilms also use such numbers. In contemporary movies:\n\nPaul Newman wears #7 as the hockey player in Slap Shot (1977).\n\nMichael Keaton is #9 and David Letterman is #14 in a musical number on The Mary Tyler Moore Hour (1979).\n\nThe foot-racer is #11 in the commercial \"America's Diggin' Into Planters\" (1979).\n\nRobert Hays wears a yellow #12 football jersey with his jeans at a picnic in Take This Job and Shove It (1981), clothes he's forced into by friends.\n\nTim Matheson is #11 on his soccer team, and his friend is #7, in Listen to Your Heart (1983).\n\nRobert Redford is #9 on his baseball team in The Natural (1984).\n\nThe romantic hero Michael O'Keefe of The Slugger's Wife (1985) wears number 4 on his Atlanta Braves uniform.\n\nMichael Keaton is #9 on his hockey uniform in Touch and Go (1986).\n\nRichard Dean Anderson is #9 on his hockey uniform in the MacGyver episode Jack of Lies (1986).\n\nIn Johnny Be Good (1988), football hero Anthony Michael Hall wears number 9, both on his blue-and-gold uniform, and his Varsity Jacket.\n\nMark Harmon is #9 on his baseball team in Stealing Home (1988).\n\nEddie Driscoll is #77 on the sleeve of his varsity jacket in Forgive Me Father (1988), an episode of the TV crime drama Night Heat.\n\nCharlie Sheen is #99 as a baseball player in Major League (1989).\n\nDouglas Barr is #1 on his polo team in Terminal Connection (1991), an episode of Murder, She Wrote.\n\nTimothy Busfield is #4 on the Minnesota Twins baseball team in Little Big League (1994), while teammate Anthony Lewis Todd is #11, Scott Patterson is #19, and Jonathan Silverman is #49.\n\nMichael Lowry wears a #11 football jersey on the beach in the Diagnosis Murder episode The Last Laugh (1996).\n\nAnthony Addabbo is #7 on his hockey team in The Hockey Show (1996), an episode of The Nanny.\n\nAdam Sandler is #9 on his football team in The Waterboy (1998).\n\nDean Cain is #44 on his baseball team in The Broken Hearts Club (2000).\n\nBrett Cullen is #7 as the star quarterback in The Replacements (2000).\n\nJim Carrey wears #11 on his hockey jersey in Bruce Almighty (2003).\n\nRyan Gosling is #9 on his football team in The Slaughter Rule (2003).\n\nTom Welling, who stars as Superboy in the TV series Smallville, wears #7 as the football quarterback.\n\nMilo Ventimiglia of Heroes was photographed in a shiny maroon #11 jersey.\n\nJay Hernandez is #4 in Friday Night Lights (2004), and his football team wears a large P on their helmets and jackets.\n\nBaseball player Mike is #14 in the music video of Jay Spears' song I Like Mike (2004), directed by Matthew Herrier.\n\nOpponent Captain Knauer (William Fichtner) is #19 on his football team in The Longest Yard (2005). Brian Bosworth is #44 on the same team. The uniforms are white with black numbers outlined in white. The team logo on their helmets is a badge, signifying they are the prison guards team. On the job the guards wear uniform baseball caps with badge logos. They also have gray dress uniforms with peaked caps and big black leather Sam Browne harness belts. All the metal on the uniforms is gold: the belt and leather harness buckles, badges, buttons, nametags, metal whistles.\n\nRob Schneider is first #7, then officially #44 on his baseball team in The Benchwarmers (2006).\n\nChanning Tatum is #7 as the soccer team captain in his red Adidas uniform in She's the Man (2006).\n\nZac Efron is #14 as the basketball team captain in High School Musical (2006).\n\nShaun Sipos is #7 as the football quarterback in Comeback Season (2006).\n\nDavid Conrad wears a large silver #7 on the front and back of his black tee shirt, in the The Woman of His Dreams episode of Ghost Whisperer (2006).\n\nGeorge Clooney is #7 on his football team in Leatherheads (2008).\n\nRob Brown wears #44 as football player Ernie Davis in The Express (2008), as Davis did in real life.\n\nColin Farrell is #9 on his police football team at the start of Pride and Glory (2008).

Apa, starring as Archie in the TV series Riverdale (2017), is #9 on his football team. He also wears the giant R on his award jacket, that Archie wears in the original comic books. Teammates wear #4 and #77, the number of real-life football star Red Grange.\n\nBasketball players in Murder, She Baked: Just Desserts (2017) are #1 (James Swalm) and #9 (Matt Visser). We also glimpse player #4, prominent in the first game, #7 and #19.\n\nThe main football player in the music video Let's Hear It For the Boy (1984) is #1, while his opponent is #77 (the number of real life football star Red Grange). The video is directed by Kenny Ortega, who went on to a similar mix of sports and dancing in High School Musical.\n\nPerhaps unexpectedly, such numbers appear in works by international directors:\n\nIan Charleson is #7 and 14 in his early running triumphs; Ben Cross is 419 during the Olympics, in Chariots of Fire (1981).\n\nThe prison van bringing the mail in L'Argent (Robert Bresson, 1983) has license plate number 97409 DE.\n\nTiger (Hui-Kuo Chou) is #7 on his basketball team in A Brighter Summer Day (Edward Yang, 1991), while a teammate is #11.\n\nThe jock rival in Patrice Leconte's Intimate Strangers (2003) wears #7.\n\nThe hero of Guys and Balls (Sherry Hormann, 2004) is #1 on his soccer team, his boyfriend is #11, and his main opponent is #9.\n\nThe stolen hockey jersey is #11 in My Winnipeg (Guy Maddin, 2007).\n\nA passerby wears a #9 shirt in Cemetery of Splendour (Apichatpong Weerasethakul, 2015)\n\nOlder films also used such numbers:\n\nWallace Reid is #11 in the auto race in The Roaring Road (James Cruze, 1919). He wears the number on his racing suit, and it is also on his car. Other cars include #4, #7.\n\nIn Excuse My Dust (Sam Wood, 1920), the sequel to The Roaring Road, in the auto race Wallace Reid is #1, his sympathetic boss Theodore Roberts is #9 and the villains drive both #2 and #4. Hero Reid eventually takes over car #4. His boss is also driving #9 in an old photo.\n\nReal-life star Red Grange was #77 on both his college and professional football teams. Reportedly his 77 number became famous. A poster shows him in a #77 jersey, for his Hollywood football film One Minute to Play (Sam Wood, 1926).\n\nThe hero's macho rival on the Harvard football team (Francis X. Bushman, Jr.) is #17 in Brown of Harvard (Jack Conway, 1926). (The hero has the non-macho number 30.) And at Yale the top player is #19 (apparently young John Wayne in his first film role).

The convict lives in Cell 9.\n\nTaking a Lickin'\n\nA number of comic book stories seem influenced by the movie comedy The Freshman (1925). Like that film, they show the hero initially being the worst player on the football team, before eventually going on to win the big game. The heroes of these tales usually get defeated by much better players in the early stages, and these better football players wear the symbolic numbers. In The Freshman, the captain of the football team wears #1 during practice, while hero Harold Lloyd wears 0.\n\nThe hapless college football substitute quarterback hero (Ralph Graves) runs the wrong way down the field, losing the big game, at the start of the movie Flight (Frank Capra, 1929). The entire stadium laughs at him, including his future commander, a Marine in dress uniform. One of the opponents who tackles him is #17. The hero wears the non-macho number 32.\n\nIn the origin of the Flash (Flash Comics #1, January 1940), hero Jay Garrick is tackled by a better player wearing #7, while another football player laughs at him. He is also chewed out by his coach and his girlfriend.\n\nThe cover by Dan Zolnerowich (All Sports Comics #v1#2, December 1948-January 1949) shows the blue-uniformed football hero fumbling the ball, while being tackled by the opposing team. He also loses the game. He looks dismayed. So does a teammate watching this. One tackler is a well-built man in a #11 red jersey. The red team is better looking, better built than the losing blue team. The red team member whose face we see has his mouth closed. Two of the blue team have receptive open mouths, including the player who's losing the game. Photo.\n\nIn the movie Johnny Be Good (1988), the hero's comic sidekick (Robert Downey, Jr.) is made to wear the less macho number 3, in contrast to the hero's aggressive #9. This is a common strategy to express subordination. The hero (Anthony Michael Hall) also has 9 on the left sleeve of his varsity jacket, as well as on his sports uniform chest and shoulders. The sidekick has 3 on his jacket. These serve as a constant reminder of the duo's numbers.\n\nIn his origin story (Nova #1, September 1976), before he becomes a superhero, high school student Richard Rider loses the game for his basketball team. Rider is #4, and he's chewed out by team member #7. Art by John Buscema and Joe Sinnott.\n\nReal-life star baseball pitcher Joe Nathan of the Texas Rangers was forced to wear a Dallas Cowboys football uniform after losing a bet to teammate Mike Adams on a Giants-Cowboys game in 2012; Nathan supported the Giants, but his team lost. Nathan had to wear a complete replica uniform of Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, from helmet and shoulder pads down to cleated shoes. The uniform had Romo's name and number 9 on it. Joe Nathan was forced to wear the Cowboys uniform for a day of his team's batting practice, followed by signing autographs for a long line of fans. Joe Nathan himself included the publicly televised autograph episode in the bet. Nathan: \"I regret that I added that. It feels just like I thought it would - absolutely terrible.\" Adams: \"I'm extremely pleased. This is probably the best bet I've ever won in my entire life. This is up there\". Note: Nathan actually looks great in the Cowboys uniform. It is clearly carefully tailored and fitted to him. Reportedly Cowboys equipment manager Mike McCord helped out with the gear. Photo. The whole thing was very public. ESPN: \"A Tony Romo lookalike trotted out onto the field at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington for batting practice Tuesday to the laughs, smiles and cheers from the Texas Rangers players.\" CBS: \"Joe Nathan can do a pretty good impersonation of Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. The pitcher and New York Giants fan had no choice.\"\n\nThe real Tony Romo has dressed up as his own favorite character Superman, a number of times. He looks exceptionally happy doing so. Superman is indeed a good-guy. Photo. Photo.\n\nLetters\n\nSuch phallic symbol letters as P, R and T are also frequently worn by athletes in film and comics.\n\nFilms\n\nIn the Harold Lloyd silent comedy The Freshman (1925), the captain of the football team wears #1 during practice, and players #7 and #9 are featured prominently in the big game at the end. Everyone at school also wears a giant letter T on the center front of their sweaters: they are at Tate University, a fictitious name probably chosen for its initial letter T.\n\nThe college musical Good News appeared on Broadway in 1927. Both of its film versions (1930, 1947) are set at Tait College. In the 1947 film, its football player hero wears a giant T on the front of his school sweater, and is #1 on his football uniform.\n\nA football player going canoeing wears a huge T on the front of his sweater in Eleven Men and a Girl (William Wellman, 1930).\n\nCollege athlete James Ellison in the film Sorority Girl (1939) wears a giant T on his school sweater.\n\nThe football players wear sweaters with a giant T with an S and U down at its base in Pigskin Parade (David Butler, 1936).\n\nThe coach of the Tigers football team in Abel's Field (2012) has a T on his cap.\n\nThe baseball team in Murder, She Baked: A Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery (2015) wear T on their caps.\n\nIn the film State Fair (1945), Dick Haymes displays a giant I on his school sweater, for Iowa.\n\nGordon Macrae also wears a large I on his school sweater in On Moonlight Bay (Roy Del Ruth, 1951), for Indiana.\n\nA student astride a bike wears a sweater with a giant L in front, in Charles and Ray Eames' science documentary Eratosthenes (1961).\n\nFreddie Prinze, Jr. wears a large H on his team award jacket in She's All That (1999). The jacket is black with white sleeves and letter.\n\nSo do the basketball team in Hoosiers (1993).\n\nIn the movie musical Grease 2 (1982), the athletes at Rydell High wear giant red R's on their award jackets. And the biker members of the T-Birds have large white T's on the back of their black leather motorcycle jackets. These built on costumes for the original Grease (1978).\n\nThe college musical Sweetie (Frank Tuttle, 1929) takes place at Pelham; the men all wear matching school sweaters with a giant P on their chest.\n\nThe football players also wear P on their school sweaters in the musical Too Many Girls (1940).\n\nIn Chuck Jones' cartoon satire The Dover Boys at Pimento University (1942), the athletic hero wears a large red P on his sweater.\n\nJody McCrea wears a P on his school sweater in Beach Party (1963).\n\nThe college athlete wears a P on his school sweater in Warning: Live Blueberries (1967), an episode of the TV series Mannix. He plays for Pacific State, a fictional school. The local police wear extra-shiny black leather uniform jackets.\n\nThe football players in the film Lucas (David Seltzer, 1986) all wear a huge P on their team jackets; their team name is the Pirates.\n\nA band member wears a prominent P on his award jacket in Swing Out Sister's music video \"Twilight World\" (1987). Player #7 is prominent in one of their games.\n\nThe real life baseball team the Pirates also wear a stylized letter P on their uniforms.\n\nSteven Weber has a huge P on the back of his award jacket in Jeffrey (1995). It is somewhat oddly placed there - usually such letters are on the front.\n\nThe basketball team in Pleasantville (1998) wear P on their school sweaters.\n\nThe Padua High School football team in Ten Things I Hate About You (1999) wear P on their award jackets.\n\nAthletes walking behind the hero wear matching blue-and-white award jackets with a huge P in a \"Direct TV\" commercial (2017).\n\nThe football players in Christine (1983) wear a giant R on their red-and-white award jackets.\n\nThe romantic jock (Ethan Erickson) in Jawbreaker (1999) has a huge R on his red-with-a-touch-of-orange award jacket. The jacket has white leather sleeves, yellow collar trim, and the gray letter outlined in white and red. (The film also has a pair of cops who wear their sharp black LAPD uniforms with precision.)\n\nDevon Graye's wrestler in Legendary (2010) has a big R on his uniform.\n\nChris Hemsworth wears a large R on his varsity jacket in The Cabin in the Woods (2012). The jacket is green with dark yellow leather sleeves and trim. His character is deliberately dressed to convey an \"athlete archetype\". It is interesting that this archetype includes a giant R. There are also a phallic-looking series of badges on his jacket's left sleeve.\n\nK.J. Apa, starring as Archie in the TV series Riverdale (2017), is #9 on his football team. He wears the giant R on his award jacket, that Archie wears in the original comic books. The jackets are blue with an intense mustard yellow on the sleeves and letter R. Wearing it makes Archie look colorful and a contrast to the guys in neutral colors around him. He \"stands out\" in the shots.\n\nChristopher Rich also wears the giant R on his award jacket in Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again (1990). It has white leather sleeves.\n\nChris Evans wears a J-H combination on his varsity jacket in Not Another Teen Movie (2001).\n\nComics\n\nArtist Tom Hickey shows comic book hero Bruce Nelson with a giant letter P on the center front of his school sweater in \"Gambler's Waterloo\" (Detective Comics #23, January 1939), a tale set at fictitious Princely University, where the aristocratic Nelson was once a football star.\n\nWhen the Flash goes undercover on a baseball team, they wear a giant R on their uniforms, in \"Baseball\" (Flash Comics #17, May 1941).\n\nArchie wore a giant R in the front of his school sweater, and his football player friend Moose sported a giant 1, in the comic book Archie.\n\nWhen Archie got super-powers and became Pureheart the Powerful (1965-1967), he wore a P on the chest of his super-hero costume. Archie's red-and-blue costume is really cool.\n\nBeetle Bailey wore a sweater with a large R, on his furlough home (1954).\n\nSuper-heroes Magno and Davy display a giant letter I on their costumes, in 1940's Super-Mystery Comics.\n\nRagsy wears a T on his chest when he becomes the comic book hero Kid Tyrant in The Chameleon tale \"A City Terrorized\" (Target Comics #25, March 1942), and its sequel \"Who Is Kid Tyrant?\" in the next issue.\n\nPow-Wow Smith's friend wears a sweater with a T in front in \"Death in the Northwoods\" (Detective Comics #154, December 1949) (bottom of page 3). Art: Carmine Infantino.\n\nThe advertising character super-hero Captain Tootsie wears a giant, thick yellow T on the front of his red tunic, in Bill Schreiber's one-page advertisement, \"The Show Must Go On!\" (World's Finest Comics #46, June-July 1950).\n\nA young newsman wears a giant T on his sleeveless sweater in \"Reporter for a Day\" (Big Town #17, September-October 1952) (page 2).\n\nThe hero wears a T on his school sweater in \"My Love Will Know Me\" (Secret Hearts #83, November 1962).\n\nMurphy Anderson drew two college astronomy students with T's on their school clothing in \"Amazing Mirages of Space\" (Mystery in Space #48, December 1958). These two young men are the smartest characters in the story. One wears a giant T in the front center of his sweater; the other has a similar T on the chest of his leather windbreaker. Both of these handsome young men are also wearing white dress shirts and ties. They are both associated with the jutting telescope in the art, another strong, single vertical.\n\nIn \"The Origin of Captain Comet\" (Strange Adventures #9, June 1951) Carmine Infantino draws his hero during his college football days wearing #7 on his uniform. In the next panel, our hero is wearing a school sweater, with a large T on top, and the letter H down below it, with its vertical lines and cross bar sticking out on either side of the base of the T: a design even more symbolic than usual.\n\nBefore Captain Comet, the space explorer Chris KL-99 also appeared in Strange Adventures, written by Edmond Hamilton.\n\nXL-49 is a romantic character in \"The Bride of Futureman\" (Superman #121, June 1958).\n\nWhen Clark Kent becomes Power-Man, he wears a giant P on his chest in \"Lois Lane's Super-Dream\" (Superman #125, November 1958). Art: Kurt Schaffenberger.\n\nSuper-hero Ideal-Man wears a giant I on his chest in \"Lois Lane's Super-Gamble\" (Lois Lane #56, April 1965).

Art: Curt Swan.\n\nSports Wear\n\nApparently authentic looking football jerseys have also become popular among men in real life as street wear. A major sports wear manufacturer is now selling shiny navy blue and gold football jerseys, with the number 7 in gold on their chest, sleeves and back. These are cleverly designed to look just like a real football uniform a guy happened to have around. Navy blue is also the traditional color of male authority figures, such as policemen, pilots and business bosses. Navy blue baseball T shirts by another manufacturer bear the number 77, while a shiny white basketball jersey bears a huge red 4. Many college football jerseys sold to fans contain the number 1 on their chest.\n\nHein Gericke made a \"Pro Sports\" leather motorcycle jacket, with large number \"17\"s on the sleeves. The jacket is black, with white letters, numbers and trim.\n\nAthletes\n\nWell known athletes wear such numbers:\n\nFans love to wear replicas of the football jerseys of real life football hero Jason Hanson. These are royal blue Detroit Lions uniforms, with their huge number 4 in silver on their chest and shoulders. Hanson was also number 4 when he played in college at Washington State.\n\nJerry Rice is #19 for the Denver Broncos.\n\nHockey star Gordie Howe was first #17 then #9 for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nHockey star Steve Yzerman was #19 for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nFashion trendsetter Brian Bosworth wore #44 at college, and tried to keep wearing it in the pros, but was forced to switch to #55.\n\nJohn Havlicek was #17 for the Boston Celtics basketball team.\n\nHank Aaron was #44 on several baseball teams.\n\nJack Morris pitched for the Detroit Tigers as #47. He also wore a spectacular fur coat. It became a subject of humorous controversy, as being perhaps too flashy. \"Admit it,\" the Detroit Free Press urged readers, \"you would have worn the coat too.\"\n\nBaseball player Brady Anderson has a fan base: he wore #9 for the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nSo does Adam Vinatieri, #4 for the New England Patriots football team.\n\nJoe Mauer plays #7 on his baseball team the Minnesota Twins.\n\nFootball kicker Lawrence Tynes was #1 for the Kansas City Chiefs, and won the Super Bowl as #9 for the New York Giants.\n\nBritish soccer superstar and fashion trendsetter David Beckham is #7 for his team; his replica jerseys are also very popular.\n\nBritish leading man Colin Firth plays a soccer fan in the movie Fever Pitch (1997): he wears #7 on his red Arsenal jersey.\n\nBasketball sensation Jeremy Lin is #17 for the New York Knicks.\n\nDirk Nowitzki was #41 on the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. He was #14 for the German national basketball team.\n\nTyler Seguin was #19 with the Boston Bruins hockey team and #91 with the Dallas Stars.\n\nRyan Kesler was regularly #17 on his hockey teams. He also uses RK17 as the name and logo of his fashion line.\n\nJohn Means is #47 as baseball pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nSome football teams use such numbers systematically for quarterbacks:\n\nUSC is not playing favorites with its two starring football quarterbacks: Matt Barkley is #7 while Max Browne is #4.\n\nDrew Brees is in his #9 New Orleans Saints football uniform on the cover of his autobiography (2010).\n\nLuke McCown is #7 as backup quarterback for the New Orleans Saints football team. He starred in uniform in a TV commercial for backup computer networks (2015).\n\nDallas Cowboy quarterback Tony Romo is #9 and Dak Prescott is #4.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz is #11 and back-up quarterback Nick Foles is #9. Nick Foles previously was #4 for the Kansas City Chiefs. Wentz was also #11 for North Dakota State.\n\nDetroit Lions possible quarterbacks, in 1990: Rodney Peete is #9, Bob Gagliano is #14, Andre Ware is #11. See a very good photo of the three. Photo: John Collier. (Detroit Free Press, Section D, page 1, September 21, 1990). The photo accompanies an article \"So What's New?\".\n\nSteve Fuller was football quarterback #4 for Clemson; the number was revived by contemporary quarterback Deshaun Watson.\n\nJohn Elway was #7 as quarterback for the Denver Broncos, and had the same number at Stanford.\n\nBrett Favre was #4 on several football teams.\n\nMatt Cassel was #7 as quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nKen Anderson was #14 as quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals football team. The number was featured prominently in his coffee commercial.\n\nFootball quarterback Jim Everett was #11 for the Los Angeles Rams and San Diego Chargers, and #17 for the New Orleans Saints.\n\nQuarterback Warren Moon was #1 for four different pro football teams.\n\nQuarterback Bert Jones wore #7 for LSU and the Baltimore Colts, and #17 for the Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\"Dandy\" Don Meredith was #17 both at Southern Methodist University, and for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nPunky quarterback Jim McMahon wore #9, first for Brigham Young University, then as a pro for the Chicago Bears, along with his trademark shades.\n\nJim Harbaugh was #4 for both college and many pro teams.\n\nFuture sports broadcaster Kirk Herbstreit was #4 as quarterback of the Ohio State football team.\n\nFuture actor Josh Duhamel was #11 as quarterback for his Minot State University team.\n\nFootball star Johnny Unitas was #19 for the Baltimore Colts.\n\nJoe Burrow is #9 as quarterback for the LSU Tigers.\n\nMatthew Stafford is #9 as quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams. He was #7 in college at the University of Georgia.\n\nColin Kaepernick is #7 as quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers football team.\n\nRock Stars\n\nRock musicians, too, have long used such symbolism. Paul McCartney's band used to include a guitarist who wore an athletic top with a huge, sports style \"1\" on his chest, along with shiny black nylon pants and black leather boots.\n\nWhen actor Chris Klein appeared on MTV's show TRL for a Super Bowl XXXVI party (2001), he wore a purple football jersey with a huge white 7 on the chest, below the word TRL.\n\n98 Degrees\n\nWhen the band 98 Degrees appeared on the Rock 'N Jock Show (2001) on MTV, Nick Lachey wore a navy blue football jersey with #4 on it and Justin Jeffre wore #1 on the same team; Jeff Timmons sported a white jersey with a red #7, and Nick's kid brother Drew Lachey wore 14 on the same white team. As usual, Drew's clothes are similar to, but not as macho, as the rest of the team's - he will be in a short white jacket when everyone else is in long white coats, or in a dark cloth jacket while his teammates wear black leather, or in a tee shirt when everyone else is in firemen's uniforms.\n\nHis teammates use their numbers in other contexts. Nick Lachey also makes public appearances in a black #4 baseball jersey.\n\nHis bandmate Jeff Timmons likes to sport a shiny gold Notre Dame football jersey with a huge #7 on the chest and shoulders. It is glamorous and assertive.\n\nThere are also shots of the band wearing football jerseys, all with the number 98 on their chest, shoulders and back. Where a person's name would go on the back, above the number 98, the band's name 98 Degrees appears instead.\n\n'N SYNC\n\nJustin Timberlake wears basketball uniforms with numbers 4 and 1 during his concerts. The red custom made #1 jerseys give his team as \"N SYNC\", in curved athletic style letters.\n\nLance Bass wears football jerseys with his name, and #4.\n\nJC Chasez has been photographed weight training in green work-out pants with a big 1.\n\nA band member wears a shiny black football jersey with a giant white 19 on the chest. The sleeves awe reversed, in white with a large black 19. He wears black gym shoes with large white laces.\n\nDouble Numbers\n\nDouble numbers also create punch:\n\nBoth 'N Sync and 98 Degrees have experimented with commercial lines of clothes that use double numbers. 'N Sync have appeared in shiny metallic football jerseys with huge 00 numbers on their chests. The zeroes have a perverse quality that is exciting.\n\nA Tostitos commercial (2015) shows a man throwing a party, wearing a jersey marked 00.\n\nJC Chasez has a shiny black jersey with a large 88 on the chest. And an equally shiny black Miami Heat basketball uniform with number 22 in white and red on the front. HEAT is in red, with a phallic flame jutting out of the T.\n\n98 Degrees have cast Nick Lachey and Jeff Timmons in basketball jerseys that are #88, while kid brother Drew is in a matching baby blue color team spirit style shirt that could be worn by a male cheerleader.\n\nThe lead singer of Creed performs in a #11 football jersey.\n\nFootball star Victor Mature is #66 and best friend Sonny Tufts is #44 in Easy Living (Jacques Tourneur, 1949).\n\nRay Milland is #22 as the baseball playing professor in It Happens Every Spring (1949).\n\nBurt Reynolds wore 22 on his jet black football uniform in The Longest Yard (Robert Aldrich, 1974).\n\nTom Cruise was #33 as the football team captain in All the Right Moves (1983), while players #44 and #55 were among his teammates.\n\nSee also all the men above wearing 11, 44, 77 and 99: the most common form of double numbers.\n\nThe Wild One - Influence on Comics and Film\n\nRomance Comics\n\nThe Show Off. Comic books sometimes use such paired numbers: see \"The Show Off\" (Heart Throbs #145, September 1972). The cover shows the ultra-macho football player in full team uniform. His number is 33. Later in the tale, we see the football player in his team jacket. This is a black leather jacket. Unlike many athletic jackets, which emphasize glamour, this one looks tough. The black leather jacket looks like something a gang of motorcycle hoodlums would wear. It is covered with white writing, like the jackets of a biker gang. In front is a big letter S, which stands for State, the name of the team's school. The back of the jacket has the word STATE on it. Immediately below, in white letters, is the player's number, 33. Both STATE and 33 are in exactly the same positions and style of lettering as on the player's football uniform. The effect is of a transfer between the hero's uniform and his leather jacket. All the letters are in the block style frequently used for athletic lettering. The jacket with its number is extremely tough looking, almost like something a convict would wear. There is no name on the jacket, just the hero's team number. The effect of being part of a motorcycle gang is overwhelmingly convincing. The whole concept of such jackets is unique. I have never seen anything like them in real life. Like other biker uniforms in the comics, it shows the influence of the biker film The Wild One (1953), which also featured black leather jackets with white lettering.\n\nThe heroine must choose between her boyfriend, the college football player, or his handsome young coach. The cover (probably by Art Saaf) encapsulates her dilemma. It shows the heroine and the two men. The bulgingly muscular football player is in full uniform. The coach is a young pretty boy. He looks hardly old enough to vote. Both men are giving the heroine orders. The coach is commanding her to choose between them, while the angry, aggressive football player is pointing at her and commanding that she choose him. All of this is right in the football stadium, with a crowd filling the stands behind them.\n\nWheels of Passion. The champion motorcycle racer of writer-artist Ric Estrada's \"Wheels of Passion\" (Young Romance #162, October - November 1969) goes through a wide variety of costume changes. On the cover, he wears a fancy, very detailed leather jacket, filled with zippers, as well as helmet, gloves and goggles. In the story, first he races for the heroine's father's company. There he wears a black leather jacket, with the number 9 prominently displayed on it. Such single digit numbers are very popular in the comics. He also wears a sharp blue suit in one scene, showing he is also a corporate employee.\n\nWhen the hero branches out on his own, his team gets a special insignia, a circle with a horizontal line through it. This insignia is everywhere on his uniforms. It shows up on his chest and sleeves. It is displayed everywhere, in the style of a uniformed organization. It helps make his clothes more uniform like, giving them a special team discipline feel.\n\nPassport to Heartbreak. \"Passport to Heartbreak\" (Falling in Love #114, April 1970) has art by Ric Estrada. The life story of a spoiled girl, from childhood to grown-up. Although she has a star athlete boyfriend Randy, she fools around with leather jacketed cyclist Mike Murdock behind his back. Mike Murdock is hardly the menacing-biker though: he's drawn to look cute and non-threatening. His jacket has epaulettes, but few other jazzy features. It is not a Perfecto, unfortunately. Still, he is the only person in the tale with a full name, and the only person with any joie-de-vivre.\n\nIn Love and War. \"In Love and War\" (Supergirl #6, August 1973) has Supergirl trying to prevent a war between two youth gangs. Bob Oksner's cover shows one of the gang lords, in a leather jacket. The jacket sleeve is covered with military style patches, including a fist. The fist and the number 2 patch below combine to be conspicuously phallic. There are also insignia of rank on the jacket's sleeve, expressing a Chain of Command.\n\nThe jacket has an erect collar. It is worn without a shirt, just the gang lord's huge muscles underneath. The gang lord wears gray striped pants. Such stripes are associated with traditional authority figures, like a Western sheriff or an English aristocrat in a formal wear cutaway coat. The striped trousers have metal rivets, a cool touch. The hero wears a tight metal wrist band that matches the rivets. The bulky, heavy leather jacket is somewhere between dark gray and black, echoing the gray pants. The jacket is elaborately belted in front. There are no signs of zippers in the illustration. Photo.\n\nFlattery - Can Get You Anywhere. \"Flattery - Can Get You Anywhere\" (Heart Throbs #143, July 1972) has its young heroine flatter a hockey star on their first date. This is a light-hearted little story. Both characters are likable, and both behave decently to each other and have fun. This makes it a pleasant alternative to soap opera. The hero is pre-med. He is quite a guy: a major league hunk, a good student, a nice guy.\n\nThe hero is a muscular athlete, a little more macho than we usually see in the romance comics. First he is shown in his purple hockey uniform. Then, on the date, he wears a gray suede jacket with a stand up collar; the collar looks especially cool. The hero's red hair and big muscles make him look like a regular guy.\n\nCindy the Salesgirl. \"Cindy the Salesgirl\" (Girls' Romances #133, June 1968) shows the heroine's boyfriend Sandy in what seems to be a leather windbreaker. It has slightly \"rough\" features, such as epaulettes and a stand-up collar.\n\nThe Bad Seed. \"The Bad Seed\" (Girls' Love Stories #167, March 1972) is a young man the heroine's wealthy parents don't want her to marry. The ruggedly muscular young man wears a black leather jacket on the splash panel. Art: Jay Scott Pike.\n\nThe Wall Between Us. \"The Wall Between Us\" (Young Romance #175, October 1971) has its Hispanic hero Carlos Ramirez in a black leather motorcycle jacket. The jacket is close in its details to the one in The Wild One: something not always found in comic books. It differs by having huge buckles on its cuffs and waist. Art: Art Saaf.\n\nRomance Comics: Art by Don Heck\n\nHe's Mine. \"He's Mine\" (Girls' Love Stories #177, April - May 1973) is a romance comic book tale with art by Don Heck. A woman has two boyfriends: a handsome blond romantically aggressive one with a roving eye, and a steady nice guy who loves her, walks dogs tied to his leash and who wears black leather jackets. The blond wears suits and is dressed to the max.\n\nForsake My Love. The cover (Girls' Romances #156, April 1971) features the hero Tom in an unusual black leather jacket. The collar and lapels resemble the Perfecto motorcycle jacket seen in The Wild One. But the lower part of the jacket is unexpectedly lacking a zipper. Instead it is elegant, double-breasted and fastened by four huge black buttons. Such button regions look more like a trenchcoat. This lower part looks quite tight. He wears it with a blue tee shirt and snow white pants. Art by Don Heck. The tight clothes, black leather, and white pants show up in other art by Don Heck. Hero Tom has leading man good looks. He's angry, and is gripping a phallic tree trunk.\n\nBetrayed. The cover of Young Romance #89 (November 1971) shows the hero Allen in tight leather pants. These bell-bottoms are worn with a big black leather belt: common in romance comics of the era. The hero Allen wears a uniform-style shirt with giant patch pockets. This hero is more a stallion, than any sort of romantic beau. Art by Don Heck. The cover illustrates a reprinted story \"Betrayed\" (1964).\n\nThe hero's legs are thrust apart, like the rock singer on the cover of \"Operation Star\" (Young Love #103, March-April 1973), a posture that conveys maximum assertiveness and display. See the dressy businessmen standing this way in \"The City Suit\", GQ (May 1988) (page 254) Online and \"The Power Look\", GQ (September 1988) (page 380), both photographed by Walter Chin. See also \"Linen Nine to Five\", GQ (June 1987) (page 172), photographed by Steven Meisel.\n\nFashion\n\nPerfecto. The leather jacket in The Wild One was not invented for the movie. It was a real-life jacket: the Perfecto, made by the Schott Bros. It was available for sale for decades. Men who wanted one could and did buy one and wear it.\n\nIn the mystery novel The Voodoo Murders (1957) (Chapters 3-4) by Michael Avallone, the bar gets two patrons who dress in motorcycle jackets like Brando wore in The Wild One. The two guys look menacing, but they turn out to be perfectly harmless. The book refers to them as \"the leather-jacketed wild ones\" and the \"two Brandos\".\n\nPatrick Cassidy is one of the few Hollywood actors who likes being photographed wearing Perfecto-style motorcycle jackets. He looked even better in a spectacular full length leather coat. Photo\n\nThe Twilight Zone episode Black Leather Jackets (Joseph M. Newman, 1964) has three aliens invading Earth, masquerading as bikers. They wear matching Perfecto-style jackets. The jackets also have an identical chest insignia, making them uniforms. Everything has been done to make both the leather and metal parts of the jackets gleam. It is not clear that these are actual Perfectos. They might be a stylish imitation, made by someone else.\n\nMirage. The Perfecto leather jackets in The Wild One influenced other real-life jackets. One of these black leather jackets is \"Mirage\". The Mirage has features of the Perfecto, but they are transformed into something elegant and upscale, in the 1980's style. The collars are similar, but the leather is thicker in the Mirage. The pockets are a bit more conventional and classier. The zippered pockets in the Mirage open more yawningly and deeper than the stiffer Perfecto, and are completely lined with black leather. There are extra zippers on the forearms, too. The flapped pocket towards the base of the Perfecto is moved to the upper chest. and is bigger and much wider. On the other side of the upper chest, a metal ring is now embedded in the leather. The ring is irregularly shaped, with both straight and circular regions. This attracts the eye and holds the attention, as does the unusual flapped pocket.\n\nThe shiny black leather of the Mirage looks both soft, and strong.\n\nThe Mirage can be seen in a two-page ad in GQ (September 1988) (pages 98, 99). It is modeled by a muscular, broad-shouldered young man with well-worn jeans and a phallic guitar. He resembles model James Guidera. Or perhaps actor Rob Estes. The guitar links the upscale jacket to rock music, rather than motorcycles. Photography: Guido Flueck.\n\nDrag Specialties. Drag Specialties offered leather jackers around 1980. Their design mixed glamour and solid toughness. Some jacket sleeves have macho looking insignia, that says \"Drag Specialties\". The insignia is very in-your-face. It adds uniform features to the jacket.\n\nThe jackets were reportedly designed in Germany by the Hein Gericke company. And have been linked to Polo of West Germany. What look like nearly identical jackets have been marketed under Hein Gericke's name alone.\n\nThe \"Hurricane\" jacket looks like an avant-garde version of the Perfecto. It has a real edge. Like the Perfecto, it features silver zippers and snaps, as well as a big belt in front. Photo. See Cycle magazine (April 1980) (Volume XXXI No. 4) (pages 102, 103). Photography: Robert Stevens.\n\nA different, but equally impressive jacket: Photo. Later jackets: Photo. Photo.\n\nCalvin Klein: Three for the Road. \"Three for the Road\" (GQ, February 1992) (page 112) features a black leather motorcycle jacket from Calvin Klein. The weathered-leather jacket looks like something the wearer has owned for a long time. It's both tough and really glossy. It is clearly inspired by the Perfecto, but it has even more and bigger zippers. It also has a big patch pocket on the sleeve, like a pilot's uniform, something the Perfecto always lacked. Photography: Fabrizio Ferri.\n\nModel: Jesse Harris. Jesse Harris specialized in portraying leading man types, macho, classy and authoritative. Often he was in the dressiest of business suits. This gives his appearance in this leather uniform a special kick. Harris is photographed here with iconography associated with rock stars: uniforms, leather, an elevated position, phallic symbols. Throughout the photo shoot Harris is linked to phallic symbols like cars, poles, towers, gas pumps. A second shot (page 114) has him all in black: shirt, trousers, shiny shoes.\n\nVersace. Designer Gianni Versace created a series of related-but-different black leather tops and jeans. Photos were taken by Doug Ordway in South Beach in Florida, circa 1992. These are spectacular. The leather clothes are full of white stitching, that recalls denim jeans and jackets more than leather wear. Photo. Photo. Photo. Photo. Photo.\n\nKenneth Cole. Designer Kenneth Cole was featured in People (November 16, 1998) (page 104). Photography: George Lange. He wears what at first looks like a black leather jacket. But actually it is styled like a man's dress shirt. A heavy, oversize leather shirt. It is made of a heavy, shiny leather. The shirt is almost like one of those Pop Art works that feature a large, transformed version of a familiar object. Like a shirt, it has heavy black leather button holes, rather than zippers. The button holes look difficult to fasten or unfasten. The button holes' elaborate stylings call attention to themselves.\n\nCole wears the shirt with the elaborate, shiny black leather \"casual\" shoes popular in the 1990's.\n\nCalvin Klein: Josh Lucas. Actor Josh Lucas wore a gleaming black leather jacket, with black zippers and an erect, belted collar (2013). The all-black look is striking. Even the buckle of the collar belt looks like dark metal. So does the metal snap at the waist. Two large vertical black zippers on the upper chest, have arrow-shaped tops that make them look even more phallic. All this black metal makes the jacket seem like industrial machinery. So does the smooth, heavy leather. The Calvin Klein jacket looks heavy, dressy, and just a bit intimidating.\n\nThe jacket is designed to make the wearer look wide-shouldered, and with brawny upper arms. This is fairly common in contemporary jackets. But it still makes the wearer look imposing.\n\nLucas wore the jacket with tight jeans. And a black leather belt with an exceptionally wide metal buckle loop. Just as the jacket is a variation on the standard black leather jacket, so is the belt a variation on a standard belt. The belt buckle echoes the belted collar.\n\nJosh Lucas wore white naval uniforms as a pilot in Stealth (2005).\n\nFilm\n\nCool As Ice. Rapper Vanilla Ice wore a black leather motorcycle jacket in the film Cool As Ice (1991), courtesy costume designer Ingrid Ferrin. It is covered with white lettering, in numerous different script styles that recall athletic award jackets. It is a cross between the outlaw biker bad boy look, and athletic team uniform jackets. The jacket is full of shiny metal snaps, like an athletic jacket, rather than the zippers common in bike jackets. The words formed by the letters are insinuating, and so are the various styles of letters with which they are composed. Anti-social messages are juxtaposed with \"official\" looking styles of letters. Some of the messages are blatantly sexual. Others suggest a bad boy image, like DANGER.\n\nThe left sleeve has a design-with-letters. It is positioned on the sleeve like a uniformed organization's insignia. It gives the jacket a uniform impact. So does shoulder lettering, which recalls an epaulette.\n\nHe wore a huge matching black cap that combines features of baseball caps, with a shape that strongly evokes fatigue uniform caps. Uniquely, it has metal plate insignia where a policeman's badge might go. And a matching shiny metal plate along the visor. Both plates seem bolted to the cap, attached with conspicuous metal screws or bolts: also a unique feature.\n\nBlack leather biker jackets with white lettering, and uniform caps, recall The Wild One. The clothes derive from The Wild One tradition - but transform it in inventive ways.\n\nGabriel Garko. Italian actor Gabriel Garko wore an unusual black leather jacket. It is clearly inspired by the Perfecto. But it has been transformed, to look oddly tight and form-fitting. Also transformed: the zippered pockets are now straight vertical or horizontal, unlike the diagonal pockets on the Perfecto. The curved-in vertical lines deliberately underscore how radically form-fitting the jacket is. Photo. The jacket looks rough and street-smart, like the original Perfecto.\n\nGabriel Garko is capable of drastically varied appearances. He can wear an elegant white suit. This is for the television mini series Rodolfo Valentino - La leggenda (Rudolph Valentino - The Legend) (2013). Photo. This suit is as forming-fitting as his biker jacket, however. He can add such perverse wear as shiny glasses and leather gloves to it. Photo. He also appeared in tails. Photo.\n\nJérémie Laheurte. Jérémie Laheurte is a French actor. He is protean in appearance. This link will take you to this article's section on his French TV crime series Paris Police 1900 (2021). He wore good suits in that.\n\nEarlier the 27-year-old actor was photographed in something much more juvenile: a Perfecto-like motorcycle jacket, with a giant collar, from Maison Martin Margiela. He wore his hair cut down to the minimum, and a skimpy gray tee shirt. It's a glamorized look at a young tough. Photo. He's also worn a light-orange Perfecto-style jacket (2014). Photo. A more gentlemanly look: Photo.\n\nHutch. David Soul wore a different, simpler kind of black leather jacket on his TV series Starsky and Hutch. It emphasizes snaps rather than zippers. Its collar flap was unusual in its day. Photo (1977). Photo. Photo (1975).\n\nChris Evans. Actor Chris Evans wore a creatively styled jacket, posed on a motorcycle. The jacket has an inventive use of color. And lots of strategically placed zippers, including one on the erect leather collar. He wore it with black jeans and shiny black shoes. Photo.\n\nMichael Fassbender. Actor Michael Fassbender teams up a sleek black leather motorcycle jacket with shiny black shoes and a black gym bag. The bulging bag has a silver zipper and metal work rings. Photo. Photo.\n\nSean Poague. Actor Sean Poague was photographed in an inventive leather jacket. Photo. Different jackets: Photo. Photo.\n\nRyan Lochte. Swimmer Ryan Lochte wore a red motorcycle vest when he presented at a music festival in 2012. The vest is shaped much like a Perfecto motorcycle jacket, only sleeveless. It is a bright red. The zipper areas and snaps are black, making them even more conspicuous. Lochte wore it with a black shirt and black leather pants. The vest has a party-like feel. It looks light-weight, and designed to be worn indoors for long periods without getting too hot.\n\nAs the World Turns. The TV soap opera As the World Turns (1983) had a costume party. Everyone dressed up in \"punk\" clothes, then a craze. Character Brian McColl (actor Frank Telfer) showed up in a shiny black leather motorcycle jacket and cap. This outfit, with its leather uniform cap, tries to be as decadent as possible. And also a comic parody of decadence.\n\nMystery 101. Mystery 101 is a series of mystery films, made for the Hallmark Channel. The first episode (2019), which is the pilot for the series, is also known as Mystery 101. The series' Good Guy male character is police detective Travis Burke, played by actor Kristoffer Polaha. Burke is originally from Chicago, and has plenty of big-city sophistication. Burke is often shown in slick, fashionable black leather jackets. In the pilot Mystery 101 and the second episode Playing Dead (2019) he's in a jacket with ribbed shoulders and upper arms. The jacket is otherwise smooth and elegant, with silver zippers. Photo. Photo. Photo. In other films, he wears a simpler leather jacket. It's a more traditional motorcycle jacket. This features lots of silver zippers. Photo. Photo.\n\nIn Dead Talk (2019) he sports a tuxedo. The black tux is traditional and stylish. Photo. Photo.\n\nPhotos by Steven Klein\n\nTom Hiddleston. Actor Tom Hiddleston was photographed in a tough but really gleaming black leather motorcycle jacket, big belt, black pants and boots. The outfit is skin tight. Photo. He also appeared in an avant-garde black leather coat full of shiny metal rivets connecting the leather pieces. And a leather strap with metal buckle. A red sign on the wall says \"KEEP OUT\". Photo. Interview magazine, September 24, 2016. Photography: Steven Klein.\n\nAlexander Skarsgård. Actor Alexander Skarsgård posed for a magazine shoot (2011). He wore a shiny black shirt made out of some unusual glazed material, tucked into tough, tight black jeans, a black leather snakeskin belt, and smooth, shiny black leather boots. He's kneeling on a bed with shiny black cushions, and holding a big baseball bat, also shiny and black. The shiny shirt's big patch pockets and epaulettes give it a uniform feel. The shirt is so shiny it almost looks as if black oil has been poured over it. Interview magazine, May 23, 2011. Photography: Steven Klein. Photos. Photo. This is the opposite of the clean cut white naval uniforms Skarsgård would soon wear in the movie Battleship (2012). Or is it? The uniforms express a Chain of Command.\n\nMedieval\n\nMarlene Stewart. Marlene Stewart is a Hollywood costume designer. She did the clothes for the film Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013). Hansel, a grown man in the film, is in a complex black leather coat. It anticipate's the Angel's outfit in Paradise Lost: erect wide-spreading collar, chest buckles, nested shoulder curves, gear held by belt.\n\nMax Brown. Max Brown played an angel in Paradise Lost (2015), an episode of the supernatural TV seres Sleepy Hollow. He wore a spectacular Medieval leather jacket, filled with silver metal aspects. The jacket has chain mail sections. Its sleeves have eight leather sections, each one smaller and tighter than the one above, giving a \"collapsing telescope\" effect. The jacket has three huge buckles and straps in front, making it look tight. It has a huge stand-up leather collar. Max Brown carries a large silver circle, worn on a belt. The silver circle has a series of phallic silver spurs or prongs emerging from it, sharp and dramatic looking. Photo. Photo. Photo. Photo.\n\nIllustrations\n\nTom Miller. Tom Miller was an artist who painted the covers of numerous paperback books. His cover (January 1971) for the paperback of Joyce Carol Oates' With Shuddering Fall shows a handsome, arrogant man in a gleaming leather motorcycle jacket. The jacket is close in style to a Perfecto. It lacks the belt and epaulettes though, which oddly makes it look dressier. So does the turtleneck the man wears under the jacket. The Mod hero has the \"razor cut\" hair that was glamorous in that era. Photo.\n\nClass of 1984. The movie poster for the 1982 film Class of 1984 shows its villains decked out in punk fashions. Their leader is in a uniform leather shirt and tight leather pants. Two of his followers are also in gleaming leather pants. Photo. Photo. These outfits are quite creative. Little like them appears in the actual movie. An exception: in the film the chief villain (Timothy Van Patten) wears a cloth shirt with a metal ring at the collar. In the poster the chief villain's uniform shirt has two similar metal rings at the collar. One suspects that the poster was created after the movie was filmed.\n\nSpikes or spines are sometimes found on punk clothes. They serve as phallic symbols. They are present in the poster:\n\nThe chief villain has a formidable silver metal arc of spikes on one shoulder. This is placed where braid is often found in a standard dress uniform. The erect, jutting spikes are at jaunty angles. The other shoulder has an epaulette with chevron imsignia: a \"uniform\" feature.\n\nIn some versions of the poster, he is carrying a club with spines on its head. This version of the poster also has phallic skyscrapers in the background. Photo.\n\nA follower has a row of spines running up each boot. The smooth, shiny leather boots go up to his knees.\n\nAnother follower sports a brightly colored Mohawk hair style. He wears studded black leather wristbands and a studded belt. The fasteners on his leather gloves echo this studded gear.\n\nThe chief villain's shirt unexpectedly has Mod el"
