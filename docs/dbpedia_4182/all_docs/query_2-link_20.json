        "text": "What's up GQ?\n\nI'm Pat Bev and today [knocks] I'm going undercover\n\non the internet.\n\nHere we go. [whimsical music begins]\n\nYep, it's actually me.\n\nQuora, you ever heard of that?\n\nI've never heard of this in my life.\n\nLove that name.\n\nHey, is Patrick Beverley a good defender\n\nor does he just get away with a bunch of reaching fouls?\n\nA little bit of both, except the word good.\n\nTake that out, put great.\n\nBut that's what happens, when you're a defender\n\nyou get away with a bunch of reaching fouls,\n\njust like if you are an offensive player\n\nyou go to the free throw line a lot.\n\nI mean come on, casual fans, let's be great.\n\nAnd he only three followers, so say less.\n\nWho are the biggest trash talkers in the NBA?\n\nDraymond for sure.\n\nKD for sure.\n\nLow key, Luca Doncic.\n\nLow key as hell.\n\nI'm definitely somewhere up there.\n\nRuss.\n\nYeah, Russ up there.\n\nCool little five.\n\nTwitter.\n\nThis is gonna be interesting.\n\n[whimsical music continues]\n\nSaw Hoop Dreams for the first time,\n\nand now I'm seeing there's a sequel\n\nwith Pat Bev called Hoop Reality.\n\nThis is very true.\n\nI had a camera following me around\n\nmy entire senior year trying to get, I don't know,\n\na part two, like from Hoop Dreams.\n\nI mean as a senior in high school I thought it was lit.\n\nI was hooping, team was winning.\n\nNationally ranked team, we got a camera\n\nfollowing me and the homies around every day at school.\n\nSo no, that's true, that was a vibe.\n\nI had a ton of fun with that.\n\nWhy is Pat Bev crying like they win a ring or something?\n\nFirst off, you can't write a sentence the right way.\n\nThat's first off.\n\nBefore you get traded, you get traded to a spot\n\nwhere, you know, you get a chance to win,\n\nget a chance to win the championship.\n\nI got traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves,\n\na team who hasn't been in the playoffs,\n\nI don't know, 16, 17 years, whatever.\n\nSo before season start, I'm the guy who likes to go mirror,\n\ncheck mirror, these are my goals.\n\nThese are things I want to do.\n\nI like to manifest things.\n\nI like to speak things into existence.\n\nI wanted to make sure this team went to the playoffs.\n\nThat was my only goal.\n\nThat's the only thing I wanted to do.\n\nWe did it.\n\nWe did it against the team that traded me.\n\nI asked the team that traded me for money,\n\nthey didn't want to give it to me.\n\nMinnesota gave it to me.\n\nWe beat them, knocked them out the playoffs,\n\nwe going to the playoffs.\n\nEmotions build up.\n\nI'm happy as fuck.\n\nIs a man allowed to be happy?\n\nWhy do we always have to cry tears of pain?\n\nWe can't cry tears of joy?\n\nSo that's all it was, just me crying tears of joy.\n\nWhoever don't like it, fuck 'em.\n\nI mean, I don't know if I could say that,\n\nbut that's how I talk, so do what you need with that.\n\nHow the hell does the NBA bubble championship not count?\n\nPat Bev can't pick and choose which titles matter\n\nand which ones don't 'cause of the conditions.\n\nIt's very hard to answer this.\n\nIt counts, it does count.\n\nBut when you're playing in an environment\n\nwhere you're not going against any part of, like crowd,\n\nWe had a team down 3-1, The Denver Nuggets.\n\nGive Denver a lot of credit, they came back and won\n\nand did everything they supposed to do in a bubble.\n\nBut that looks very different\n\nif 3-1 was closeout game in LA Clippers,\n\nor closeout game in LA or, you know, stuff like that.\n\nSo for me saying the bubble ring doesn't count,\n\nI think it's the part ignorant,\n\nbut at the same time the bubble didn't give you\n\nall the normal conditions that you would have\n\non facing other teams.\n\nAnd I'll just leave that at that.\n\nYouTube.\n\n[whimsical music continues]\n\nBev and Russ becoming best friends\n\nwas something I did not see.\n\nMe neither.\n\nOn god, me neither.\n\nRuss the homie.\n\nRuss really the homie.\n\nReally, Russ the bro.\n\nWhen I first came to LA, he was the first person\n\nto kind of like, anything you need?\n\nAnd he was at my press conference throughout the season.\n\nDinners, wine, fat wines.\n\nFat wines all the time.\n\nWe had a Christmas dinner together.\n\nThink about that.\n\nMe and Russ.\n\nReally misunderstood.\n\nReally misunderstood.\n\nNBA great.\n\nLegend for sure.\n\nNext, Pat Bev, you should have came to Golden State.\n\nWould've had a chance to win a ring this season.\n\nHeard that you chose joining the Bulls over the Warriors.\n\nIs that true?\n\nThis is absolutely true.\n\nBut people understand in this game, right?\n\nYou talk to these NBA teams,\n\nyou talk to these GMs, these presidents.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors wanted me to wait.\n\nThey wanted me to wait to see\n\nhow the Gary Peyton thing played out.\n\nThey wanted to wait and see how\n\nthe Steph Curry injury played out.\n\nAnd in this business, or any business,\n\nif you have an opportunity that's waiting on you,\n\nI don't think any normal person would wait on an opportunity\n\nthat's not fully there already.\n\nSo I took what was available to me at that time.\n\nAnd what if I did wait, and the Bulls close up\n\nand Golden State Warriors said no,\n\nnow I'm left without a job.\n\nBut these are the casual things\n\nthat casual fans don't think of.\n\nThey think that, you know, you have this and this,\n\nand oh you chose.\n\nNo.\n\nIf the Warriors would've said, Pat Bev,\n\nwe want you to come to Golden State.\n\nI would've happily been with the Warriors the next day.\n\nBut that wasn't the case.\n\nThe Bulls did that and that's the decision I made.\n\nBack to Twitter.\n\n[whimsical music continues]\n\nPat Bev with the best technical foul earned in NBA history?\n\nThe man showed a camera to the ref.\n\nI don't think this should have been a technical foul.\n\nNot because the actual foul did not happen,\n\nbut the fact that it's been guys showing iPads,\n\nit's been guys showing clipboards,\n\nthere's been guys showing whatever\n\nthat didn't receive a technical foul.\n\nI guess the name on the back of the jersey,\n\nyou know, for me, if I do any little thing\n\nI get a technical foul.\n\nIt's just part of the business with me though.\n\nBut I've seen this happen play after play,\n\nand you never see a guy gets a technical foul.\n\nBut, man that was a good game.\n\nThat was a fucking good game.\n\nSkip Bayless on national television,\n\nI will give Patrick Beverley, he tweeted this?\n\n'Cause that's not how you spell my name.\n\nBut, Skip Bayless on national television,\n\n'I will give Patrick Beverley a ring\n\nand not Russell Westbrook.\n\nI just don't like him.'\n\nHow are these media shows allowed\n\nto blatantly slander a player with extreme bias?\n\nMe, you know, on my pod,\n\nwe had a real big debate about this,\n\nhow the media kind of controls the narrative players,\n\nand the control of narrative from players\n\ncan actually help or hurt a player when it comes from,\n\nI don't know, making $200 million to $150 million.\n\nYou know, if you're in that range,\n\nor from being in the NBA or not being in the NBA,\n\nI agree with this.\n\nThe blatant slander with extreme bias\n\ncan cause somebody to lose on a ton of money.\n\nSo use your words, don't use your words at people,\n\nand make sure your words are factual when you do use them,\n\nespecially if you're part of the media.\n\nSo that'd be my answer to that.\n\nDoes any NBA player think about another player\n\nas much as Pat Bev thinks about Chris Paul?\n\nI don't know how to answer that.\n\nDo you think about another player as much as Chris Paul?\n\nNo, I don't.\n\nMore Quora.\n\n[whimsical music continues]\n\nHow was Patrick Beverley able to guard Kevin Durant\n\nin the first two games of their playoff series\n\ndespite the substantial height difference?\n\nSo me and the homies, right?\n\nWe talked, before the playoff series, we talked.\n\nWe didn't know Maeve C., we started two rookies.\n\nOur legion scorer is two guys off the bench,\n\nLou Will and Trez.\n\nObviously no one in the world thought we had\n\nany slight chance of beating Golden State,\n\nprobably except us.\n\nSo me and the homies, okay, Pat, who you got?\n\nI said, man, I told coach, man, gimme K.D.\n\nThey said, all right, fuck it.\n\nHow you thinking about guarding him?\n\nSo I got homie, homie like 5'9.\n\nI had homie stand on couch, now homie kind of KD height now.\n\nSo like we at the crib, he got ball in hand,\n\nI'm putting my butt all up on the couch and shit.\n\nLike, yo, that's what I'm gonna do bro.\n\nI gotta chop off his legs bro.\n\nI can't give him power, 'cause he gonna shoot right over me.\n\nSo the key to that game was being aggressive as shit.\n\nI understood the refs wasn't gonna call a ton of fouls,\n\n'cause they wanted to see that.\n\nIt's always a build up from each series.\n\nThey wanted to see both of us on the courts.\n\nThe game says I had six fouls,\n\nbut I knew I had really nine going in,\n\nif you know what I mean.\n\nSo I was able to be really aggressive with him, foul a lot,\n\nuse my strength, use my lower body on his lower body,\n\nand kind of like, you know, kind of throw 'em off.\n\nBut yeah, that was how I was able to\n\nkind of get that job done the first couple games.\n\nWhat should NBA teams do to prevent star players\n\nfrom demanding trades?\n\nOoh, that's a good one.\n\nHold on.\n\nWhat should NBA teams do to prevent star players\n\nfrom demanding trades and exerting too much control\n\nover their futures?\n\nIt's a business, right?\n\nLike the next 30 years is gonna be somebody else\n\ncalling themselves The Claw, or The Beard,\n\nor there's gonna be a kid shooting no look threes again,\n\nI promise you it is.\n\nSo this game is a revolving door.\n\nI don't think it has to do with preventing star players,\n\nI think that everyone should have a freedom to, you know,\n\nif you're not happy in this situation,\n\nand it's your future,\n\nyou should be able to control your future.\n\nAnd if you want something better,\n\nthen I think that's up to you.\n\nObviously are the one who has to deal with\n\nthe media backlash, the opportunity of,\n\nis there another team, or relocation.\n\nThat player is going through all that.\n\nNone of the teams are.\n\nNo, I think you should be in control of your own destiny\n\nand your own future.\n\nI don't think the NBA should do anything\n\nto prevent anything like that.\n\nActually I think it makes it a better league.\n\nWho is a better defender, Tony Allen or Patrick Beverley?\n\nTwo different defenders, but I'm gonna say me for sure.\n\nBut you gotta understand, me and Tony Allen,\n\nTony Allen's like the big bro.\n\nHe's from Chicago.\n\nSo like I've learned a lot, a ton.\n\nLike I asked a ton of questions.\n\nI've learned a lot from him.\n\nBut there's two different defenders.\n\nHe's, you know, 6'5, 6'6, I'm 6, 6'1.\n\nHe played the passing lanes really well.\n\nI really don't play the passing lanes.\n\nI'm really on ball.\n\nHe guarded the post really well.\n\nI'm shorter, so it's kind of tough for me for guard post,\n\njust two different defenders.\n\nBut I'm gonna still choose me.\n\nLet's check Twitter.\n\n[whimsical music continues]\n\nCan someone tell me what is the roadmap\n\nfor Pat Bev to win defensive player of the year?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI don't know the roadmap.\n\nA lot of media people don't like me,\n\nso this is a media based vote.\n\nSo the road might be hard, it might not.\n\nWell who cares?\n\nAs long as I continue to impact\n\nand leave my legacy on the game,\n\nthat's really the most important thing for me.\n\nI think you should ask the coaches.\n\nI'm a firm believer, just ask the coaches\n\nwho blows up their ATOs, meaning after timeout plays,\n\nor ask the coaches who give their players\n\nthe hardest route during the game, or ask the coaches,\n\nlike damn, I gotta tell my big to keep screening Pat Bev\n\nbecause he's so attached to whoever that ball handler is.\n\nJust ask the coaches.\n\nBack to YouTube.\n\n[whimsical music continues]\n\nPat, what's harder,\n\ncoming back from a blowout loss in the playoffs\n\nor coming back from a really close game\n\nyou lose in crunch time?\n\nI think that the really close game you lose in crunch time.\n\nYou know, you come back from a game, it's close,\n\nand then you still lose.\n\nI think you find little things, ah,\n\nif I could've did that better, if I could've did that,\n\nI mean I should have passed it there,\n\nor I should shot it there.\n\nOh, I should have rebounded there.\n\nYou see things to kind of fix.\n\nWhen you get blown out, especially in the playoffs,\n\njust, man, scrap that game, on to the next type of vibe.\n\nYou know what I'm saying?\n\nSo yeah, I think that's harder,\n\ncoming back from a game in crunch time.\n\nPat, are you looking forward to being able to play\n\nin more arenas like Boston Garden and MSG\n\nnow that you're a sixer?\n\nSince you are someone that knows and loves the game,\n\nis that like an added bonus to play in new arenas?\n\nIt is, and I don't care what you say.\n\nLike any NBA player, basketball player tell you,\n\nlike MSG, always, always, you look forward to that.\n\nYou got the fit planned out for that.\n\nLike you locked in, you got haircut for a trip,\n\nlike you locked in on that game.\n\nAnd Boston for sure.\n\nI mean it's so much history with it,\n\nlike some of the old court is still on it.\n\nLike there's so much history with it\n\nthat you embrace these points of playing\n\nin arenas like this.\n\nSo yeah, for sure, a hundred percent.\n\nSigning off, GQ, thank you guys for everything.\n\nThe questions were great.\n\nYouTube was great.\n\nQuora was great.\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nUntil next time.\n\n[whimsical music fades]"
