        "text": "Date Event Source 2 During the first quarter of that night's Monday Night Football game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Paycor Stadium, Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and collapsed midfield after tackling Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. Hamlin received treatment (including CPR and automated external defibrillation) on-field by stadium medical personnel, who were able to restore his heartbeat, and was subsequently taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center in critical condition. (Hamlin came out of his induced coma on January 5, with his neurological functions determined to be intact; he was released from UCMC on January 9 and returned to Buffalo, where he underwent two additional days of evaluation at Buffalo General Medical Center before being released there.) After being suspended for roughly 45 minutes with 5:58 remaining in the quarter, the game—which was simulcast on ABC, in addition to its regular broadcasts on ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Deportes and ESPN+—was postponed. On January 6, the NFL announced that the game would not be completed; playoff seeding that was to be determined by the Bills–Bengals game was instead decided by winning percentage (factoring this, the Bengals would clinch the AFC North championship title), and matchups were determined through Wild Card games (involving the Miami Dolphins against the Bills, and the Baltimore Ravens against the Bengals) scheduled for January 14 and 15, respectively. The Bills and Bengals would each advance to the Divisional Playoffs, which saw the Bengals qualify for the AFC Championship, 27–10, in a January 22 rematch against the Bills. [1][2]\n\n[3][4]\n\n[5][6] 3 For The View's first episode of the year, current and former hosts (including original panelists Star Jones, Debbie Matenopoulos and Meredith Vieira, the latter appearing via phone call due to illness) reunite to honor Barbara Walters. Walters, who died on December 30, 2022, at age 93, created and produced the ABC daytime talk show, and was among its panelists from its August 1997 debut until her retirement in May 2014. [7] 5 CBS West Coast flagship KCBS-TV and independent KCAL-TV, both in Los Angeles and owned by the network, jointly rebrand their news department as KCAL News. The change takes effect with the launch of a six-hour local morning newscast on KCAL-TV, with a one-hour simulcast on KCBS-TV (which begins carrying CBS Mornings live at 4 a.m. PT along with the West Coast feed at 7 a.m. PT). Local and network management agreed to the KCAL News rebrand as a way to leverage KCAL-TV's stronger identity in the market, having been the first station to launch a three-hour primetime newscast in 1990. [8][9] 6 Dish Network removes 32 stations collectively owned by Mission Broadcasting (including WPIX/New York City, WXXA/Albany, WYOU/Scranton–Wilkes Barre, KWBQ–KASY/Albuquerque–Santa Fe, WNAC/Providence, KAMC/Lubbock, and KLRT–KASN/Little Rock) and White Knight Broadcasting (owner of WVLA/Baton Rouge and KFXK/Longview), after the satellite provider and the two Nexstar Media Group affiliate companies fail to renew a carriage agreement that expired that day. The blackout effectively leaves the affected Mission and White Knight stations without satellite distribution as both groups have been involved in separate carriage disputes with DirecTV (and co-owned DirecTV Stream and U-verse TV) that began in October 2022. [10][11]\n\n[12][13] 10 The 80th Golden Globe Awards air on NBC and stream on Peacock from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, with Jerrod Carmichael hosting. It follows a one-year absence from the network after NBC declined to air the previous year's ceremony in support of boycotts by various media companies, actors, and other creative individuals in the entertainment industry over the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's lack of action to increase the diversity of the organization's board membership. Among television awards, Abbott Elementary was the top winner with three awards each (\"Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy\", \"Best Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy\" for Quinta Brunson, and \"Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series – Musical-Comedy or Drama\" for Tyler James Williams), tying with top film winner The Banshees of Inisherin (which won for \"Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\", \"Best Screenplay\", and \"Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy\" for Colin Farrell) for the most wins overall among the ceremony's awards. [14][15]\n\n[16] 12 Nexstar Media Group ceases live streams of local programming (including newscasts) produced by its stations on their websites and mobile apps, instituting a two-hour delayed feed of each station's local programs in its place. The change is an apparent effort to obtain leverage in contractual negotiations with linear pay TV providers, amid Nexstar's carriage disputes with providers such as DirecTV, Dish Network and Verizon FiOS (see January 6 entry as an example). Three of the group's major-market stations (WGN/Chicago, KTLA/Los Angeles and KRON/San Francisco), and live breaking news and severe weather events covered by the affected stations are exempt from the change, which deviates from the now-standard practice of offering live newscasts online for the convenience of viewers who are unable to view them at home or who live outside of the station's home market. [17] 15 The 28th Critics' Choice Awards airs on The CW from the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel in Century City, with Chelsea Handler as host. Among television nominees, Better Call Saul had the most wins with three awards (\"Best Drama Series\", \"Best Actor in a Drama Series\" for Bob Odenkirk, and \"Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series\" for Giancarlo Esposito), while Abbott Elementary won two awards (\"Best Comedy Series\", and \"Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series\" for Sheryl Lee Ralph). Everything Everywhere All at Once won five awards (including \"Best Picture\", and \"Best Supporting Actor\" for Ke Huy Quan) to become the ceremony's top winner overall and among film nominees. Special honors went to Jeff Bridges (Lifetime Achievement Award) and Janelle Monáe (#SeeHer Award). [18][19]\n\n[20][21] 17 The Daily Show begins its post-Trevor Noah era, returning from a five-week hiatus with Leslie Jones beginning a week-long stint as guest host. Jones is the first in a series of guests who will anchor the Comedy Central nightly program while the network determines a permanent successor for Noah, who ended a seven-year run as host in December 2022. [22][23] 19 LIV Golf signs a multi-year deal with The CW to broadcast and stream its events beginning with the 14-tournament 2023 season (the first event being the LIV Golf Mayakoba tournament at the El Camaleón Mayakoba Golf Course in Solidaridad, Quintana Roo from February 24 to 26). The deal is the golf organization's first U.S. broadcast deal—its inaugural year in 2022 was available only through YouTube—and the CW's entry into live sports telecasts. This deal was criticized by the National Press Club as an attempt by Saudi Arabia's monarchy (which finances LIV through a sovereign wealth fund) to sportwash its unflattering reputation after their alleged involvement in the October 2018 assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As CW stations are only contractually obligated to air the network's prime time schedule, 14 affiliates (eight owned by CBS, five owned by Tegna, and Weigel-owned WCIU/Chicago) declined to air the LIV telecasts; CW majority owner Nexstar leased airtime on other stations in those markets. [24][25]\n\n[26][27]\n\n[28] 23 CBS News Detroit, a localized extension of CBS News's streaming service, formally launches in Detroit. CBS-owned WWJ-TV simulcasts the 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts, with additional newscasts debuting on both platforms in the coming weeks. This marks a return to local news on WWJ-TV since a partially-outsourced morning drive newscast was cancelled in 2012. (An 11 p.m. newscast, produced by co-owned WKBD-TV, ran from 2001 to 2002, when the entire news service was shuttered.) The launch of CBS News Detroit was delayed throughout much of 2022 due to pandemic and supply chain-related delays. WKBD-TV's 10 p.m. news, originally produced remotely from KTVT/KTXA in Dallas–Fort Worth, had already been relaunched as Detroit Now News, a hybrid national-local newscast featuring CBS News Detroit reports and content. [29][30]\n\n[31][32]\n\n[33] The Association of Pickleball Professionals signs multiplatform deals with CBS Sports and ESPN to broadcast and stream its tournaments beginning with the league's 2023 season. In addition to coverage on APP's standalone outlet, APP TV, the agreements encompass eleven of the 22 APP Tour events scheduled for the 2023 season, covering streaming coverage of eight events on ESPN+ (beginning with the Daytona Beach, Florida event held from February 8–12) and accompanying hour-long recap shows airing on ESPN2, and linear broadcasts of three additional events and recap programs on CBS Sports Network. [34][35]\n\n[36] 24 In the wake of felony charges of domestic abuse against him being made public following a court hearing on January 12, Adult Swim announces that it has severed ties with Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland. The single-count charges of domestic battery and false imprisonment, to which Roiland pled not guilty in October 2020, were related to a complaint involving an alleged incident that occurred ten months prior with an unidentified woman. Following Roiland's exit, production of the animated series will continue with co-creator Dan Harmon remaining as its lone showrunner, while the title characters, which had been voiced by Roiland, will be recast. Hulu would follow suit the next day, dropping him from Solar Opposites (the lead character of which he also voiced, in addition to handling showrunning duties) and the just-premiered Koala Man. [37][38]\n\n[39] The FCC issues a fine of $504,000 against Fox for \"willfully violating\" regulations prohibiting the sounding of Emergency Alert System tones or the simulation of an EAS alert during television programming in the absence of an emergency for a November 2021 promotional segment that aired during Fox NFL Sunday for a game telecast involving the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles that followed the pre-game show. (The Giants won that game, 13–7.) The promo mimicking an emergency broadcast, described by Fox as a \"short comedic advertisement\", began with a three-second excerpt of the 853 Hz and 960 Hz tones used to precede EAS alert transmissions, which the network admitted had been downloaded or recorded from a YouTube video. [40][41] 25 DirecTV removes Newsmax TV from the namesake satellite provider, and sister services DirecTV Stream and U-verse TV, after the company and network parent Newsmax Media fail to agree on a new contract. Although DirecTV cites aggressive carriage fee demands for the removal (while noting the wide availability of the network's content on its website and free streaming platforms), Newsmax accused the company of \"deplatforming\" it and fellow archconservative news and commentary channel One America News Network (which DirecTV removed in April 2022)—inferring an ideological motive for the decision, even though DirecTV continues to carry their main conservative rival Fox News—and dishonesty about the network's fee increase offers. A group of 41 Republican congressmen led by Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) sent a letter to the CEOs of DirecTV and shareholders AT&T and TPG Capital the week before, warning them of possible House committee hearings over the impasse should the provider drop the network. Newsmax TV, as with OAN, has challenged the 2020 presidential election, earning support from former president Donald Trump (who is a personal friend of Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy) amid his criticism of Fox News for being the first television news outlet to call Arizona for Democratic challenger Joe Biden in that election. DirecTV reached an agreement to resume carriage of Newsmax on March 22. [42][43]\n\n[44][45] As part of a multi-year agreement that also extends their carriage contract for Court TV, the E. W. Scripps Company and YouTube TV announce that the vMVPD service will add Ion and digital multicast networks Bounce TV and Scripps News to its lineup, effective on this date. Under the terms of the deal, YouTube TV has the option of adding fellow Scripps-owned multicast networks Grit, Ion Mystery and Laff at a later date. [46] 27 ABC News officially cuts ties with Amy Robach and T. J. Holmes. The two hosts of GMA3: What You Need to Know, who had respectively been with the network since 2012 and 2014, had been off the air since December 5, 2022, after a Daily Mail exposé revealed they had been in a romantic relationship (and had left their respective spouses), an affair ABC described then as \"an internal and external disruption\" but not a violation of company policy (although an internal investigation would commence). On May 11, the news division named Good Morning America weekend co-anchor Eva Pilgrim and correspondent Demarco Morgan to co-host GMA3, while transportation correspondent Gio Benitez (who was among those acting as substitute hosts on the program following Holmes and Robach's departure) will take over Pilgrim's GMA weekend anchor slot. [47][48] Deadline reports that CNBC will discontinue producing original entertainment content for its prime time block, emphasizing instead on reruns of reality and documentary shows (e.g. Shark Tank, American Greed). The business news-oriented network's prime time had been home to first-run unscripted content that focused on wealth and lifestyle, including Jay Leno's Garage (whose cancellation had been announced earlier in the week) and the Kevin O'Leary-hosted Money Court. [49] 30 Paramount Global announces plans to fully integrate its Showtime network with the premium tier of the Paramount+ streaming service, beginning on a future date yet to be announced. The combined service will be branded as Paramount+ with Showtime, replacing a bundle of the same name that launched in mid-2022. [50] FuboTV loses access to CBS stations in 160 markets after their respective owners (including Nexstar Media Group, Sinclair Broadcast Group, the E. W. Scripps Company, Hearst Television, Cox Media Group and Tegna) declined to accept the terms of a renewed master affiliate carriage agreement negotiated between network parent Paramount Global and the vMVPD. A national CBS feed, offering most of the network's base schedule (excluding some live sports events) and news content from the CBS News Streaming Network, was provided to substitute the affected affiliates. (CBS's owned-and-operated stations were not affected by the impasse as they were carried on a different carriage agreement.) Three weeks after the affiliate board approved a revised carriage deal, the affected stations began returning to Fubo on March 31. [51][52] Longtime KSAT-TV/San Antonio sports director Greg Simmons resigns after 42 years, a decision made after his being charged for DWI. Weekend sports anchor Larry Ramirez would serve as KSAT's interim sports director. [53][54] 31 YouTube TV drops MLB Network from its channel lineup after failing to reach a contract renewal agreement. Subscribers will be able to continue watching select national Major League Baseball games on Fox, ESPN and TBS. [55] Date Event Source 3 For the first time since 2015, Paul Shaffer reunites The World's Most Dangerous Band (the house band for David Letterman's Late Night and Late Show) to fill in for The Tonight Show's regular house band The Roots, who were in Los Angeles preparing for a performance at the Grammys. [56] 5 The 65th Annual Grammy Awards airs on CBS from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Trevor Noah serves as host of a ceremony that sees notable winners including Lizzo, whose \"About Damn Time\" wins Record of the Year; Harry Styles, whose Harry's House wins Album of the Year; and Beyoncé, whose four wins on the night (including Renaissance as Best Dance/Electronic Album) push her career Grammy mark to 32, making her the most-lauded artist in Grammy history. [57] 7 NFL Network removes analyst and former player Michael Irvin from its coverage of Super Bowl LVII following allegations of sexual misconduct toward a woman at a hotel he was staying at in the Phoenix area, where the game will be held. Though surveillance video showed him interacting with the woman, Irvin told Dallas–Fort Worth radio station KRLD-FM and The Dallas Morning News that he had no recollection of any incident because he had been inebriated, and denied any wrongdoing. Irvin would file a $100 million defamation suit against the anonymous accuser and the hotel on February 9. [58][59] 8 The Wall Street Journal reports Warner Bros. Discovery will continue to operate Discovery+ as a standalone streaming service, a pivot from the company's initial plans to shutter it entirely following the May 13 launch of its combination service Max, which will feature most of Discovery+'s existing content library in addition to the full HBO Max library. WBD cites concerns about Discovery+ subscribers opting out of moving to the pricier offering for the decision. (WBD has indicated that the combined service's ad-supported and ad-free tiers will be set at a higher price point than those of HBO Max and Discovery+.) [60][61] NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert is arrested on disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing complaints for allegedly disrupting a news conference by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine on the February 3, derailment of a Norfolk Southern freight train containing hazardous chemicals that prompted residential evacuations in East Palestine. The D.C.-based correspondent was conducting a live report for the Nexstar-owned cable news channel's Rush Hour program when police officers inside the gym of the village's elementary school, where the news conference was held, told him to conclude the report while DeWine was speaking, and subsequently pushed Lambert to the ground and handcuffed him after acceding to their request. DeWine later condemned the officers' actions, clarifying he did not authorize Lambert's arrest. Lambert was released from the Columbiana County Jail later that evening on an $850 bond; he is scheduled to be arraigned on February 23. [62][63] 12 The Kansas City Chiefs defeat the Philadelphia Eagles, 38–35, in Super Bowl LVII at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, which was broadcast on Fox (in English) and Fox Deportes (in Spanish), and streamed on the Fox Sports app and NFL+. It was the first Super Bowl assignment for play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and color analyst Greg Olsen, who succeeded Joe Buck and Troy Aikman as Fox's NFL broadcast team in 2020 after they were hired by ABC/ESPN to call its Monday Night Football and NFL playoff telecasts. The Fox telecast averaged 115.1 million viewers according to Nielsen data, becoming the most-watched program in American television history (just ahead of Super Bowl XLIX), with viewership reaching 118.7 million during the halftime show (headlined by Rihanna, who revealed her second pregnancy with the performance); the Fox Deportes telecast was watched by 951,000 viewers, becoming both the most-watched Super Bowl broadcast and the most watched non-soccer sports telecast in Spanish-language cable history. [64][65]\n\n[66][67]\n\n[68][69]\n\n[70][71]\n\n[72]\n\n[note 1] 15 Gray Television sells Fox affiliate KNIN in Boise, Idaho (operated by the E. W. Scripps Company) to Marquee Broadcasting in exchange for MeTV affiliate WPGA in Macon, Georgia. When completed, the deal will result in Gray owning at least one full-power station in nine of Georgia's eleven television markets. The deal was completed on May 1. [74][75] 16 Ryan Seacrest announces he will step down as co-host and executive producer of Live with Kelly and Ryan, which he has hosted alongside Kelly Ripa since 2017, to concentrate full-time on other projects (including his hosting duties on American Idol and his syndicated radio program). Ripa's husband, Mark Consuelos, who has frequently served as guest host since she became co-host of the Disney/ABC-produced syndicated morning talk show in 2001, will succeed Seacrest on April 17 as permanent co-host of the renamed Live with Kelly and Mark. Seacrest—who will return occasionally to guest co-host—will continue hosting Live through April 14, at which time he will relocate to Los Angeles to host Idol's live performance shows. [76][77]\n\n[78][79] 22 Spectrum News 13 reporter Dylan Lyons is killed, and colleague and photojournalist Jesse Walden critically injured, in a shooting incident in the Orlando suburb of Pine Hills, Florida that also claimed the life of a nine-year-old girl and critically injured her mother. Lyons and Walden were at the scene of a homicide that claimed the life of a woman earlier that day. A teenager was taken into custody as a suspect in both incidents. [80][81] 23 Ellen Pompeo makes her last appearance as a cast regular on Grey's Anatomy as her character, Meredith Grey, leaves Seattle and Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital for Boston in the episode \"I'll Follow the Sun.\" Pompeo has been with the ABC medical drama since its 2005 premiere, and remains attached as an executive producer and narrator, in addition to making occasional on-screen guest appearances, the next of which will be the current 19th season's finale in May. [82] Dish Network is hit by a cyberattack that resulted in data being extracted from its IT networks; and the company's internal servers, customer support systems and company websites being knocked offline, with service disruptions affecting its co-owned vMVPD service Sling TV and wireless provider Boost Mobile. Dish and Sling subscribers also experienced difficulties accessing streaming apps (such as its Dish Anywhere service, OTT services purchased through Dish and TV Everywhere apps of various networks carried by the Dish satellite service and Sling) using their provider logins. Some employees continued to be paid during the outage despite it preventing them from performing their jobs. Although Dish restored \"many of the systems,\" including its websites, customer service operations and self-service applications within weeks of the attack, service disruptions and technical issues lingered into March as customers continued to report call center backlogs (some lasting up to 14 hours) and problems processing payments. Several Dish investors filed a class action lawsuit over the breach on March 30, accusing the company of negligence in failing to properly secure customer data. [83][84]\n\n[85][86]\n\n[87] 24 Warner Bros. Discovery informs the teams whose games air on its AT&T SportsNet channels based in Denver, Houston, and Pittsburgh that the company will exit the regional sports network business, and that its AT&T Sports Networks unit will file for Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy unless the channels are sold or the teams take back their broadcast rights by March 31. Teams that air on Seattle-based Root Sports Northwest are not part of the proceedings as WBD only holds a minority stake in that network. [88][89] Warner Bros. Discovery files a breach of contract lawsuit with the New York Supreme Court, accusing Paramount Global of violating a 2019 agreement that gave HBO Max rights to stream the first 23 seasons of South Park as well as three subsequent seasons that had yet to air at the time on Paramount-owned Comedy Central. The suit alleges Paramount diverted most of the animated series' post-2019 episodes to Paramount+ under a separate $900-million deal between ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks (now Paramount Media Networks) and series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached in August 2021, despite WBD holding streaming exclusivity over the series under their $596.7-million (or $1.7 million per episode) deal, and only produced 14 of the 30 additional episodes promised to fill out the WBD–Paramount contract. Paramount countersued WBD on April 19, alleging the contract did not define a specified episode commitment for future seasons or required it to license made-for-streaming South Park movies to HBO Max. WBD and Paramount both claim they are owed $52 million in unpaid license fees. [90][91] 26 The 29th Screen Actors Guild Awards are presented at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Century City, California, with notable winners including the motion picture Everything Everywhere All At Once (four awards) and TV series Abbott Elementary and The White Lotus (wins for comedy and drama ensembles, respectively). The ceremony airs live on Netflix's YouTube channel, a one-year arrangement between SAG and Netflix before the streamer, once its live-streaming capabilities are worked out, carries the ceremony exclusively beginning in 2024. (The SAG Awards' former broadcast homes, TNT and TBS, announced in 2022 that they would no longer broadcast the ceremony.) [92][93]\n\n[94] Date Event Source 4 The 2023 Kids' Choice Awards airs on Nickelodeon and was simulcast on six Paramount-owned sister networks (including the Nick Jr. Channel, Nicktoons, TeenNick, TV Land and MTV2) from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, with Nate Burleson and Charli D'Amelio (who won \"Favorite Female Creator\") as hosts. Harry Styles won the most awards among all nominees with three each: for \"Favorite Male Artist\", \"Favorite Global Music Star\", and \"Favorite Song\" (for \"As It Was\"). High School Musical: The Musical: The Series (with Olivia Rodrigo and Joshua Bassett winning both \"Favorite Kids TV Star\" categories) and Wednesday (which won \"Favorite Family TV Show\" and \"Favorite Female Family TV Star\" for Jenna Ortega) were the top winners among TV nominees with two each. Other major winners include Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (\"Favorite Movie\"), SpongeBob SquarePants (\"Favorite Animated Series\"), and Adam Sandler (\"King of Comedy Award\"). Also on this day, Nickelodeon receives its first major rebrand in almost six years. [95][96]\n\n[97][98]\n\n8 Fremantle, the production company behind The Price Is Right, announces that the CBS game show will relocate from Los Angeles' Television City to Haven Studios, a Fremantle-co-owned facility in nearby Glendale, California, when its 52nd season begins taping in the summer. The game show has originated from Studio 33 at Television City (renamed in 1998 as the Bob Barker Studio, in honor of the former longtime host) since premiering in 1972; its move, and the pending relocations of several other shows from the facility (among them The Young and The Restless and Real Time with Bill Maher), comes before the start of a $1.25 billion renovation of the property, which Hackman Capital Partners bought from CBS in 2018. [99] Hulu removes 34 ABC stations operated by Sinclair Broadcast Group from its vMVPD service in 32 markets, after the streaming service reportedly declined Sinclair's offer to add Tennis Channel as part of a renewed agreement for the stations. Unlike the earlier FuboTV master agreement dispute between CBS and several of its affiliate operators (see January 30 entry), Hulu—which is majority owned by ABC parent Disney—did not substitute the affected Sinclair stations with a linear ABC national feed. (A feed was provided to the affected markets exclusively for the network's telecast of the 95th Academy Awards four days later.) The dispute lasted until April 21, when Hulu and Sinclair agreed to reinstate the affected stations through a new contract. [100][101]\n\n[102] WLBT/Jackson removes longtime morning anchor and chief meteorologist Barbie Bassett (who is white), after she quoted the Snoop Dogg-coined slang, \"Fo shizzle, my nizzle\" (\"nizzle\" referring to the Black term of endearment vernacular for \"nigger\"), when a collaboration with another WLBT reporter was jokingly raised during the Gray-owned NBC affiliate's 11:00 a.m. newscast, after a report on the introduction of a new wine to the rapper's Cali Wine Collection line. Although WLBT—which infamously had its license revoked by the FCC in 1969 from original owner Lamar Life Insurance, due to the station's advocacy of racial segregation and omission of civil rights movement coverage during NBC News broadcasts—has not formally disclosed Bassett's status, her biography was removed from its website. Bassett previously apologized for a similar incident in October 2022, in which she suggested reporter Carmen Poe (who is Black) ask her grandmother—whom Bassett referred to as \"grandmammy\"—for a pie recipe to get a scoop on a then-upcoming ESPN College Gameday telecast from Jackson State University. [103][104] 12 The 95th Academy Awards airs on ABC from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, with Jimmy Kimmel as host. Everything Everywhere All at Once was the top winner with seven awards, including Best Picture, Best Actress (Michelle Yeoh, who became the first Asian woman to win the honor), Best Supporting Actor (Ke Huy Quan), and Best Supporting Actress (Jamie Lee Curtis). Other major winners included All Quiet on the Western Front with four awards (including Best International Feature Film) and The Whale with two (including Brendan Fraser for Best Actor). The telecast was seen by an estimated 18.7 million viewers, up 12% from the previous year. [105][106]\n\n[107][108]\n\n[109][110]\n\n[111]\n\n[112] 13 As part of a multi-year agreement that also extends their existing carriage contracts for the group's 40 CBS stations and NewsNation, Nexstar Media Group and YouTube TV announce that the vMVPD service will add 59 Nexstar-operated stations serving 56 markets (consisting of 29 CW, 26 MyNetworkTV and four independent stations, including WPIX/New York City, KTLA/Los Angeles, WGN-TV/Chicago, KRON/San Francisco, WPHL/Philadelphia, and WDVM–WDCW/Washington, D.C.) to its lineup. The deal fills a major affiliate coverage gap for The CW on YouTube TV, as Nexstar was the largest group without a carriage deal for its CW stations (CBS and Sinclair Broadcast Group were the largest CW station operators to offer their affiliates on the service); it also expands local MyNetworkTV carriage on YTTV (beyond affiliates operated by Fox and Sinclair) for the first time. [113][114] 14 Diamond Sports Group files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The operator of the Bally Sports group of regional sports networks, which carry local broadcasts for nearly half of the teams in the NBA, NHL and MLB (42 teams in total across 19 channels), had been struggling to reduce around $8 billion in debt acquired through its 2019 purchase of the former Fox Sports Networks from The Walt Disney Company. Diamond's financial health, which was impacted by cord-cutting as well as carriage disputes earlier in the decade that significantly reduced Bally Sports' vMVPD distribution, became an issue after announcements that it had missed a $140 million payment to its lenders in February, and a scheduled rights payment to MLB's Arizona Diamondbacks on March 10. Diamond will separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization, and plans to continue to produce and air games. Diamond president Steve Rosenberg subsequently stepped down on March 20, succeeded by CFO David DeVoe. [115][116]\n\n[117][118]\n\n[note 2] DirecTV files a lawsuit against Nexstar Media Group, Mission Broadcasting and White Knight Broadcasting with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, accusing the groups of price fixing through an \"illegal conspiracy\" to collectively bargain in retransmission fee negotiations using \"sidecar\" arrangements between Nexstar and the latter two companies meant to skirt FCC regulations (including its local station ownership caps). The suit is in relation to a broader carriage dispute involving 23 Mission and two White Knight stations that were removed from DirecTV, DirecTV Stream and U-verse TV during separate negotiations in October 2022. District Judge P. Kevin Castel dismissed the antitrust lawsuit on standing grounds on March 20, 2024. [124][125]\n\n[12][126][13]\n\n[note 3] 15 Sports Business Journal reports that Greg Gumbel has signed a contract extension with CBS Sports that will allow the veteran sportscaster to remain studio host for its NCAA basketball coverage while stepping away from his role as play-by-play announcer for its NFL broadcasts. Outside of the period when the network did not have the NFL (1994–97), Gumbel has been with CBS since 1990 and is the first African-American to handle play-by-play for the Super Bowl. [127] 17 Tyra Banks discloses in an interview with TMZ that she will step down as co-host of Dancing with the Stars after three seasons to focus on her business and television production projects. Banks succeeded Tom Bergeron (who had hosted DWTS since its 2005 debut on ABC) and Erin Andrews as sole host of the reality competition series in 2020. On March 20, Julianne Hough—who served as a pro dancer from 2007 to 2009 and as a judge from 2014 to 2017—was named to succeed Banks, alongside returning co-host Alfonso Ribiero, who joined the series in 2022 (coinciding with its move to Disney+). [128][129]\n\n[130] NBC and the post-production editing staff of Saturday Night Live announce a tentative labor agreement that averts a strike against the variety series that was set for April 1. The staff of 12–20 editors and film managers, who edit pre-taped sketches for SNL, unionized in October 2022, sent contract proposals to NBCUniversal that December, and approved a strike authorization with the Motion Picture Editors Guild on January 23. The deal, whose ratification was announced on March 23, gives the team pay boosts, healthcare benefits, employer-paid meals, and accommodations for those who work long shifts with short turnarounds. [131][132]\n\n[133][134] 18 KCBS–KCAL/Los Angeles weekend morning meteorologist Alissa Carlson Schwartz faints on-air just prior to presenting a weather segment during the CBS-owned duopoly's Saturday morning newscast. The rest of the broadcast was preempted following the incident, with both stations (which simulcast portions of the newscast) airing pre-recorded and paid programming in its place. Carlson—who, while employed at NBC affiliate KGET/Bakersfield, was diagnosed with a heart valve leak after vomiting on-set during a weather report in 2014—was treated for a head injury, and later revealed in a March 21 interview with CBS Mornings that the fainting spell was induced by vasovagal syncope likely triggered by dehydration. [135][136]\n\n[137][138] 24 Sinclair Broadcast Group lays off 30+ news department employees and cancels certain local newscasts produced by NBC affiliates WPMI/Mobile (operated under an SSA with Deerfield Media) and WEYI/Saginaw–Flint (operated under an SSA with Howard Stirk Holdings), Fox affiliate WACH/Columbia, and Fox/ABC affiliate WGXA/Macon, and shuts down the news department of ABC affiliate KAEF/Arcata–Eureka, California. WPMI cut more than 20 members of its approximately 30-person news staff, and discontinued its weekday morning and noon newscasts as well as the lifestyle program Gulf Coast Today; WEYI cut six production staffers, and cancels its weekday morning and weekend evening newscasts; WACH cancels its four-hour morning newscast; and WGXA cut nine production staffers, reduces its hour-long weeknight 5:00 p.m. newscast to a half-hour and cancels its Sunday–Thursday 10:00 p.m. newscast. On April 3, most of the affected stations replaced some or all of the affected newscasts with Sinclair's syndicated national newscast, The National Desk (with WACH replacing the first hour of its morning newscast with a repeat of its 10:00 p.m. newscast, and WPMI replacing its local midday programs with additional runs of Family Feud), while KAEF began simulcasting newscasts from Redding parent station KRCR (retaining two Eureka-based reporters to file reports for those broadcasts). [139][140]\n\n[141][142]\n\n[note 4] 26 The United States Army pauses its recently launched advertising campaign featuring on-screen narrator Jonathan Majors, which revives its classic \"Be All You Can Be\" ad slogan, one day after the actor's arrest on misdemeanor domestic violence charges in connection to a March 24 domestic dispute, in which Majors allegedly physically assaulted a woman he was dating, resulting in her sustaining minor head and neck injuries. New ads in the campaign, which do not feature Majors, would be rolled out the following weekend. [143][144] 27 Chanel West Coast announces her departure from MTV's Ridiculousness after signing a deal to develop, produce, and star in unscripted projects for MTV parent Paramount Media Networks and its MTV Entertainment Group subsidiary. Chanel had co-presented the comedic clip show, alongside Steelo Brim and lead host Rob Dyrdek, since its launch in 2011. [145] 28 One day after The Bachelor's 27th season concludes, Mike Fleiss announces his departure from the Bachelor franchise he created and had produced since the first Bachelor season on ABC in 2002. Claire Freeland, Jason Ehrlich, and Bennett Graebner are immediately tapped to oversee the dating game show franchise, which also includes The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise. Though Fleiss, ABC, and Warner Bros. Television Studios (the franchise's producer) were tight-lipped as to the reason for his departure, a Variety report later indicated that Fleiss was the subject of an investigation, conducted by an outside party, into allegations of bullying and racially discriminatory behaviors. [146][147] Date Event Source 2 The LSU Tigers defeat the Iowa Hawkeyes to win the championship of the 2023 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. Simulcasts of the game on ABC and ESPN2 drew a combined 9.9 million viewers, the largest ever television audience for a women's college basketball game. [148] The 2023 CMT Music Awards airs on CBS from the Moody Center in Austin, Texas, with Kane Brown and Kelsea Ballerini as hosts. In addition to co-hosting, Kane Brown won the Video of the Year award for his collaboration with wife Katelyn Brown, \"Thank God\". Jelly Roll was the top winner of the night, with three awards (all for his single \"Son of a Sinner\"). [149][150] 3 The UConn Huskies top the San Diego State Aztecs in the title game of the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The CBS broadcast attracted 14.693 million viewers, a record low for the championship event. The broadcast is also Jim Nantz's last college basketball assignment for CBS; though he remains the network's lead play-by-play announcer for NFL and PGA golf events, Nantz steps back from college basketball after calling 32 consecutive tournaments for CBS and Turner Sports. Ian Eagle will succeed Nantz as CBS' lead college basketball announcer in the 2023–24 season. This also marks the first Men's Final Four to be overseen by Charlie Baker, who was appointed president of the NCAA in December 2022 to succeed Mark Emmert (who announced his retirement in April of that year). [151][152][18] [17] Frontier Communications removes three networks—Newsmax Media-owned Newsmax TV, and Fuse Media-owned Fuse and FM—from its systems, after declining to negotiate new agreements with their respective parent companies. The dispute involving Newsmax comes two weeks after DirecTV ended a two-month dispute with the conservative news and commentary channel, and 4+1⁄2 months after Frontier dropped its archconservative competitor One America News Network in a similar dispute. [153] American Idol season 21 contestant Sara Beth Liebe abruptly quits during the Hollywood Week round, citing the need to be with her children. Liebe called out Katy Perry on social media two weeks prior for a controversial \"mom-shaming\" joke that the singer made during her initial audition, in which she remarked that Liebe, after revealing she was a mother of three at age 25, had been \"laying on the table too much.\" [154] 5 Hearst Television announces it will purchase NBC affiliate WBBH/Fort Myers from Waterman Broadcasting for $220.54 million, pending FCC approval. The purchase—which includes the LMA rights to Montclair Communications-owned ABC sister WZVN—marks the family-owned Waterman's exit from broadcasting (the group, originally founded in 1956 as a radio station operator, had owned WBBH since 1978), and will give Hearst its fifth station in Florida, alongside its existing properties in Orlando (WESH/WKCF), West Palm Beach (WPBF) and Tampa (WMOR). The sale was completed on June 30. [155][156] 12 As part of a multi-year agreement that also extends their existing carriage contracts for the group's 25 CBS and 16 MyNetworkTV stations as well as Comet, Sinclair Broadcast Group and YouTube TV announce that the vMVPD service will add Tennis Channel and its companion AVOD streaming channel T2, and digital multicast networks Charge! and TBD to its lineup, effective June 1. This would later be followed on July 19 by a similar deal between Sinclair and Hulu to add the three networks as well as Comet to the service's vMVPD offering in January 2024. [157][158] PBS and many of its member stations suspend activity on Twitter after the social messaging platform labeled the service's accounts as \"government-funded media.\" The designation had earlier been given to NPR, which suspended posts the day prior amid a broader dispute that began on April 4, when Twitter first relabeled the counterpart radio service under the \"state-affiliated media\" classification previously given only to news agencies influenced or controlled by autocratic governments. PBS and NPR, which are editorially independent, consider both labels to be misleading and meant to undermine their credibility; both public broadcasters are funded primarily through donations from viewers as well as corporate and philanthropic donors, while government appropriations to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting account for >1% of their overall funding. (Other public broadcasters, including the BBC and CBC/Radio-Canada, have also criticized or paused activity on Twitter after being assigned the label.) [159][160]\n\n[161][162] 13 The studios of WWMT/Kalamazoo–Grand Rapids were evacuated around 2:30 p.m. ET, after a Greenville man with a history of mental illness threatened to kill himself with a bomb he claimed to have in his backpack. (Authorities later confirmed that they only found an iPhone charger and wiring in the backpack.) The suspect—who initially said he was submitting a news tip—forced his way through the front door of the Sinclair-owned CBS/CW affiliate's lobby when chief engineer George Markle moved to barricade the suspect between both lobby doors, and helped evacuate station staff from the building. After two hours, the suspect surrendered to police and was taken to the Kalamazoo County Jail. [163][164]\n\n[165] 16 Due to a 90-minute delay over what is later revealed to be an overlooked technical bug, Netflix aborts plans to live-stream the Season 4 reunion special of dating series Love is Blind. The special would have been the streamer's second-ever live event (after Chris Rock: Selective Outrage, which ran without error on March 4). The reunion is recorded and released on a tape delay the following day. [166][167]\n\n[168] 18 Avoiding a trial in Delaware Superior Court that already had a jury empaneled and sworn in, Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News announce a $787.5 million settlement agreement in the former company's defamation lawsuit over the latter's airing of baseless claims that Dominion's voting machines switched votes cast for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, one of several conspiracy theories spread by Trump, his supporters and many conservative media outlets to explain his defeat by Biden. Dominion had been seeking $1.6 billion in damages. Though the settlement does not require them to apologize on-air, Fox News does acknowledge in a statement that \"the Court's rulings [found] certain claims about Dominion to be false.\" [169] 19 The news-gathering helicopters of Griffin Media's two Oklahoma CBS affiliates sustain damage from a supercell thunderstorm that spawned at least nine tornadoes across the central section of the state. While covering an EF3 tornado that caused extensive damage in Cole, three-inch hailstones knocked out the windshield of a Bell 407 operated by Oklahoma City flagship KWTV; pilot Jim Gardner and photographer Rich Kriegel, who were both on board, were not injured. An EF2 tornado which struck Shawnee later that evening damaged the tail rotor and roof of a Bell 206 B3 JetRanger operated by Tulsa sister KOTV (which was being housed in a hangar for maintenance and required inspection) at the city's airport. [170][171] 20 The WNBA announces a multi-year deal with the E. W. Scripps Company that will see Ion Television air regular season doubleheaders, along with regional telecasts (airing in early- or late-evening broadcast windows) carried on selected Ion O&Os, on Friday nights starting with the 2023 season. Ion's initial slate of 44 WNBA-produced games will air over 15 weeks from May 26 to September 8. The deal gives Ion its first national sports telecasts since a three-event UFC preliminary fight deal in 2010–11, and marks the first rights deal ever signed by Scripps Sports, which was formed in December 2022 to acquire sports events for Ion and Scripps's local television stations. [172][173]\n\n[174][175] Fox News announces it has parted ways with conservative commentator Dan Bongino, who hosted the Saturday prime time show Unfiltered for the network as well as the Fox Nation program Canceled in the USA. According to Bongino, the move was due to a breakdown in contract negotiations and not related to Fox's settlement with Dominion Voting Systems. [176][177] 21 Paramount Global agrees to a $167.5 million settlement of a case stemming from the 2019 merger of CBS Corporation and Viacom filed by former CBS shareholders against some of the company's former officers and directors (including vice-chairperson Shari Redstone and acting CEO Joseph Ianniello) over alleged breaches of fiduciary duties related to the merger negotiation and approval. [178] 23 NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell departs the company following a third-party investigation into a complaint relating to an inappropriate relationship that Shell had with a female employee. Comcast president Michael J. Cavanagh will assume management responsibilities for the division until a successor is appointed. CNBC anchor and senior international correspondent Hadley Gamble—who lodged the complaint alleging sexual harassment by Shell, and allegations of bullying and discrimination by members of CNBC World's management team in March that led to investigations into both matters—would subsequently reach an agreement with NBCUniversal to depart the network on May 9. [179][180] 24 Fox News parts ways with Tucker Carlson, permanently ending Tucker Carlson Tonight with the April 21 broadcast (which ended with the expectation that it would be back the following Monday). The dismissals of Carlson and senior executive producer Justin Wells—reportedly directed by Fox Corporation executive chairman/CEO Lachlan Murdoch and Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott to Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch—are tied to a discrimination lawsuit by producer Abby Grossberg (who was fired in March, and would go on to settle the litigation for $12 million on June 30), alleging she was subjected to bullying and antisemitic comments while working on the program, and was coerced by company lawyers to provide misleading testimonial answers in the Dominion Voting Systems defamation lawsuit settled six days prior. Private text messages that Carlson sent to colleagues (expressing skepticism of election fraud claims made by former president Donald Trump's attorneys, criticizing the network for \"jeopardizing\" its credibility by amplifying the claims, and revealing that he hated Trump \"passionately\") were among the internal messages made public through the Dominion lawsuit that were widely seen as exposing Fox to greater legal liability. Carlson's former 8:00 p.m. ET slot was temporarily filled by Fox News Tonight, which was hosted by a rotation of network personalities; Jesse Watters Primetime took over the hour on July 17, as part of a broader prime time realignment that also saw timeslot changes for The Ingraham Angle and Gutfeld! (with Ingraham being moved to Watters' former 7:00 p.m. ET slot). Carlson would debut a conservative commentary video series on Twitter on June 6, prompting a cease and desist notice issued by Fox News one week later, citing a non-compete clause in his former contract that runs until early 2025. [181][182]\n\n[183][184]\n\n[185][186]\n\n[187][188]\n\n[189] CNN parts ways with anchor Don Lemon, following a series of controversies over his on-air remarks and treatment of network colleagues, and an April 5 Variety report that outlined allegations of mistreatment toward several former female colleagues—including Nancy Grace, Kyra Phillips and Soledad O'Brien—and instances of \"diva-like behavior\" during his 17-year career at CNN. Lemon was earlier criticized for remarks about Nikki Haley, which were widely perceived as sexist, on the February 16 edition of CNN This Morning, suggesting the former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina governor (who turned 51 the month prior) was not a viable presidential candidate because she \"isn't in her prime\"—referencing a comment Haley made during her declaratory speech the day prior that implied President Joe Biden and her rival for the 2024 Republican nomination, Donald Trump (then 80 and 76, respectively), were too old to hold office. [190][191]\n\n[192][193]\n\n[note 5] The Walt Disney Company conducts a second round of layoffs affecting hundreds of employees, including ABC Current Programming SVP Stacey Adams, Freeform programming development SVP Julie Jarmon, and Disney Branded Television unscripted programming VP Marc Buhaj, and 20th Television SVP and Current Programming co-chief Dana Sharpless; FiveThirtyEight founder/CEO Nate Silver will also depart at the end of his contract later this year as part of cuts to the ABC News unit. The company will also combine the current programming and development teams of Disney Television Animation, and dissolve digital content division 20th Digital Studio, Disney Media Distribution's first-run syndication unit and Disney Television Studios's marketing division (marketing responsibilities for programs produced by its studio units will be handled by the company's television and streaming properties). [194][195]\n\n[196][197] Concluding an expansion that began on April 1 (when it replaced overnight drama series and infomercials with repeats of its evening talk and analysis shows), NewsNation permanently switches to a 24-hour all-news schedule on weekdays: the Nexstar-owned network debuts a four-hour rolling afternoon news block, NewsNation Now (replacing crime dramas in that slot), and an hour-long political news show, The Hill (a broadcast extension of the co-owned publication, replacing an hour of NewsNation Rush Hour). The expansion coincides with the unveiling of a new studio at its New York bureau in the Daily News Building (where co-operated CW affiliate WPIX also christened a separate studio on that date). Syndicated scripted series acquired before the former WGN America began its gradual format shift from entertainment to news in February 2021 (such as Blue Bloods and Last Man Standing) and time-brokered programs will continue to air on weekends outside of prime time until late 2024, when NewsNation plans to switch to all-news programming full-time. [198][199]\n\n[200] 25 A man carrying an electric guitar and a handwritten sign—reading \"Free Billie Eilish\", and referencing a dark web conspiracy theory regarding the CIA's infamous MKUltra experimentation program and ex-Illuminati \"insider\" Donald Marshall—climbed onto a digital billboard on KTLA/Los Angeles's landmark auxiliary transmission tower outside its Sunset Bronson Studios facility. (The Nexstar-owned CW affiliate's promotional billboard was subsequently turned off temporarily for safety reasons.) The man descended from the tower after about three hours, as firefighters and LAPD crisis negotiators sought to get him down an adjacent ladder. He was arrested on a suspicion of trespassing complaint. [201][202] 26 Facebook Watch announces the cancellation of Red Table Talk, the streaming service's last remaining original program, with its producers seeking a new service for future episodes of the talk show. The move comes amid ongoing layoffs at Facebook Watch parent Meta Platforms (which included that of Mina Lefevre, Facebook Watch's head of development and programming) and a shift in emphasis by Meta toward content for its Horizon Worlds virtual reality service. [203] ESPN cut ties with baseball reporter Marly Rivera for calling fellow reporter Ivón Gaete a \"fucking cunt\" in a heated caught-on-tape exchange on April 18, after Rivera alleged Gaete tried to interview Aaron Judge, despite the former having had been scheduled to interview the New York Yankees outfielder. [204][205] Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt vetoes H.B. 2820, a bill that would extend authorization for the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority, the state's PBS member network, through July 1, 2026. Although Stitt later alleged the veto was over objections to LGBTQ+ content on certain PBS programs that he claims \"indoctrinat[es]\" and \"overly sexualizes\" children (harkening rhetoric of a broader ongoing culture war over LGBTQ+ rights), the bill is one of over 20 measures (some passed unanimously by the state's House and Senate) that he elected to veto in a broader impasse with Senate leaders over his education and tax proposals—which, in addition to increasing education funding and teacher salaries, would also create a voucher-like tax credit program. The veto of H.B. 2820—which, had it not received the required two-thirds support of both legislative chambers to override it, would have resulted in OETA's agency authorization expiring on July 1 and the member network ceasing operations when its existing funding appropriations lapsed in July 2024—was overridden by the legislature on May 25 (the penultimate day of its 2023 session), passing the House, 73–23, and the Senate, 38–6. [206][207]\n\n[208][209]\n\n[note 6] A red-tailed hawk fatally collided with a Bell 206 JetRanger operated by WPLG/Miami as the helicopter flew over Pembroke Pines en route to cover a story during the BH Media-owned ABC affiliate's noon newscast. Pilot Mark Lewis and photographer Joe Brennan were not injured, and the helicopter—which sustained damage to its cockpit window—landed safely. [211][212] 27 Just shy of a year after announcing his departure, James Corden hosts The Late Late Show for the 1,193rd and final time. Will Ferrell and Harry Styles are the guests on the finale, which also featured a pre-recorded farewell message from President Joe Biden and a dream sequence sketch that included appearances by fellow current and former late night hosts Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, David Letterman and Trevor Noah. The last episode of Corden's 81⁄2-year run as host—which was preceded earlier that night by the show's final prime time Carpool Karaoke special—also served as the series finale of the CBS late night talk franchise, which debuted in January 1995 with Tom Snyder as its original host. After airing reruns of The Late Late Show for the remainder of spring and summer, the timeslot was filled by reruns and unaired episodes of the comedy panel show Comics Unleashed starting in September until mid-January of the next year. [213][214]\n\n[215][216]\n\n[217] Sinclair Broadcast Group announces it will cancel full-length newscasts and lay off all news department staff at CBS affiliate KTVL/Medford, Oregon, and CBS/Fox affiliate KPTH/Sioux City, and discontinue partially outsourced newscasts on NBC affiliate WNWO/Toledo (co-produced by CBS sister WSBT/South Bend since March 2017), CBS affiliate WGFL/Gainesville, Florida (co-produced by CBS sister WPEC/West Palm Beach since October 2019), and Fox affiliate KPTM/Omaha (co-produced by Fox sister KMPH/Fresno since 2013), effective May 12. The National Desk will replace newscasts on all five stations starting May 15. The cuts, as well as reductions in news production at five other stations (see March 24 entry), are believed to be related to the recent bankruptcy of Sinclair-controlled Bally Sports parent Diamond Sports Group. [218][219]\n\n[220][221]\n\n[222][142]\n\n[note 7] 28 Phoenix's professional basketball teams, the NBA's Suns and the WNBA's Mercury, reach agreements with Gray Television to air their regionally televised games on independents KTVK and KPHE-LD, and with interactive video provider Kiswe to livestream their games on team-specific subscription streaming services. The deal—which was slated to begin with a Mercury-Minnesota Lynx preseason game on May 25 and last five years for the Suns and two for the Mercury—would see the Gray stations maintain exclusivity over certain Suns and Mercury games, feature team-related programs on KTVK and KPHE, and have the content distributed throughout Arizona across KTVK's translator network and Gray-owned KPHE repeaters in Tucson (KOLD-DT5) and Yuma–El Centro (soon-to-launch KAZS). The Suns and Mercury are the first major-league teams to end their television partnerships with Bally Sports since the March 14 bankruptcy of parent Diamond Sports Group, whose Bally Sports Arizona has carried Suns and Mercury games since 2003 and 2006, respectively. (The Suns were last on over-the-air local TV when the team ended its contract with MyNetworkTV O&O KUTP in 2011.) U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Christopher Lopez, who is overseeing Diamond's bankruptcy proceedings, would void the Gray deal on May 10, on the basis that the Suns and Mercury violated rules that froze Diamond's rights with the teams and gave them a right of first refusal to match the deal, while in bankruptcy. Diamond effectively reversed course on July 13, declining to submit an offer matching the Gray deal to retain the Suns/Mercury rights before that day's deadline. [223][224]\n\n[225][226]\n\n[227][228]\n\n[229][230]\n\n[note 8] 30 During ABC's coverage of Game 1 in the Miami Heat–New York Knicks playoff series, a bumper shown during the telecast included stock footage with the original towers of the World Trade Center in the background. After complaints from viewers, ESPN said it \"mistakenly used an old stock image and we apologize.\" [231] Date Event Source 1 Two days after the conclusion of the 2023 NFL draft, Xfinity drops NFL Network from its systems after failing to reach a contract renewal agreement prior to its expiration. The blackout ends the following day, reportedly resolved after a phone discussion between NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts conducted the previous afternoon. [232][233] As part of a multi-year agreement that also extends their existing carriage contracts for the company's 90 ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox stations and NewsNation, Nexstar Media Group and Hulu announce that the latter will begin carrying additional Nexstar-run stations serving 32 markets (consisting of 26 MyNetworkTV and four independent stations, including WGN-TV/Chicago, KRON/San Francisco, WPHL/Philadelphia, WTTA/Tampa–St. Petersburg, KAUT/Oklahoma City and WDVM/Hagerstown–Washington, D.C.) to its vMVPD service's lineup. Although some of Nexstar's 29 CW affiliates were reportedly added to Hulu beginning in February, the terms of the deal do not specify whether carriage of other CW stations operated by Nexstar were included as part of the agreement. [234][235]\n\n[236] 2 The Writers Guild of America commences a strike against television and film studios, its first labor stoppage since 2007 and the largest production stoppage for the American entertainment industry since 2020, after the union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers failed to agree on a new contract by the WGA's May 1 renewal deadline. The WGA sought increases in compensation and residuals, and greater protections for over-scale pay (citing a decline in pay despite the expansion of content with the rise of streaming services in recent years that effectively created a \"gig economy\" for unionized writers), staffing requirements for television shows to employ a certain number of writers for a specified period of time (regardless of need for specific episodes), curbs on mini-rooms (where groups of writers outline story breakdowns and write scripts), and restrictions on chatbot scriptwriting. The strike immediately halted production of late night talk and variety shows; and, just as how the Fall network schedules were impacted by the 1981 and 1988 strikes in addition to being compounded by the concurring SAG–AFTRA strike that would begin on July 14, halted or delayed development and production of scripted series for the 2023–24 network schedule (resulting in unscripted programs, and acquired foreign, cable and streaming series occupying much of the Fall schedule), along with cable and streaming programs that have uncompleted episodes. At the outset, prime time network schedules were not significantly disrupted at the strike's commencement (after production on most scripted network shows for the 2022–23 season had already concluded). As well, some shows that employed paerticipating WGA members continued production, either without pre-written material (including talk shows The View, The Kelly Clarkson Show and Gutfeld!) or using fi-core and non-union writers to continue ongoing and planned storylines (as soap operas had done during previous strikes). The WGA would declare the strike over effective at 12:01AM on September 27, three days after the Guild and AMPTP reached a tentative agreement that was approved by Guild leadership on September 26, and allowing its rank and file to return to work while they perform a ratification vote. [237][238]\n\n[239][240]\n\n[note 9] A man fires an automatic-style rifle into a glass door panel outside the front lobby of WHBQ/Memphis around 11:30 a.m. CT. The suspect—who had a history of mental illness, and was in the midst of a mental episode that family and friends reportedly intended to seek help for that day—had earlier informed an employee of the Imagicomm-owned Fox affiliate that he was carrying a gun while talking to them outside the studio's front gate. Employees were evacuated to a back parking lot for around 30 minutes as police secured the area; no one was injured. The suspect was arrested about two hours later at a nearby burger restaurant, where he was barricaded inside a bathroom and posted a Facebook Live video, in which he insisted on speaking with \"news people\" about alleged evidence into corruption in the Memphis Police Department. [241][242]\n\n[243]\n\n[note 10] 4 The NHL's Vegas Golden Knights sign a multi-year agreement with the E. W. Scripps Company's Scripps Sports division to air their regionally-televised games on Ion O&O KMCC/Laughlin–Las Vegas (which will become an independent station). The deal, effective with the 2023–24 season, replaces AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain as the Knights' television partner and expands the team's local relationship with Scripps (KMCC sister station KTNV has carried the Knights' preseason and ABC-televised regular season games since the team's inaugural 2017–18 season, concurrent with its AT&T SportsNet contract). Scripps will syndicate the Knights telecasts to stations across the team's broadcast territory, including the company's stations in Boise, Salt Lake City and Montana. The Knights are the first major-league team to cut ties with AT&T SportsNet since its parent, Warner Bros. Discovery, announced its intent to exit the RSN business. [244][245]\n\n[246] Gray Television fires South Dakota State Capitol reporter Austin Goss (who filed reports for KOTA–KEVN/Rapid City and KSFY–KDLT/Sioux Falls) following his arrest on charges of making \"threatening, harassing or misleading contacts\" tied to a January 23 prank call he made to former South Dakota State Senator and Republican Party chairman Dan Lederman by spoofing the personal cell phone number of Governor Kristi Noem, which a state investigation found that Goss may have obtained during \"personal and professional\" communications with her. [247] 5 NBC Sports California suspends veteran Oakland Athletics play-by-play announcer Glen Kuiper, after he appeared to refer to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum as the \"nigger league museum\" during the pre-game show for that night's away game against the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium. Kuiper apologized for the remarks—which he made while discussing a visit he and broadcast partner Dallas Braden made to the museum earlier that day—following a commercial break at the top of the sixth inning. The A's denounced Kuiper's remarks in a statement on Twitter, calling his use of the slur \"unacceptable.\" Kuiper was fired by NBC Sports California on May 22. [248][249]\n\n[250][251]\n\n[252][253]\n\n[254] 6 The coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla is televised on all major broadcast networks, cable news channels and BBC America. The ceremony was watched cumulatively by 10.9 million viewers according to Nielsen, with ABC's coverage leading all networks with 3.04 million viewers. [255][256] 7 The 2023 MTV Movie & TV Awards are broadcast on MTV and its sister networks, with Scream VI (Best Movie) and The Last of Us (Best Show) among the notable winners. Originally planned as a live ceremony (from the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California), the event airs instead as a prerecorded presentation in the wake of several attendees, and previously announced emcee Drew Barrymore, withdrawing in solidarity with striking WGA members, as well as plans by the Guild to picket the event. (Barrymore, who still appeared on the broadcast in pre-recorded skits, has agreed to host the ceremony in 2024.) [257][258]\n\n[259][260] 8 Nexstar Media Group announces it will acquire independent station KUSI/San Diego from McKinnon Broadcasting for $35 million. The deal would create a duopoly with Fox affiliate KSWB (the first such duopoly in the San Diego market), and marks the family-owned McKinnon's exit from broadcasting (McKinnon, which was founded in 1962, had launched KUSI in 1982 and the station was its last television property following the 2010 sale of KIII/Corpus Christi to London Broadcasting Company). Nexstar plans to turn KUSI into a CW affiliate once its contract with Tegna-owned KFMB-DT2 (which runs through September 2026) expires or is terminated early. [261][262]\n\n[263][264]\n\n[note 11] 9 Paramount Media Networks announces it will shut down MTV News as part of broader layoffs and cost-cutting at the company, affecting 25% of the company's U.S.-based staff. Launched in 1987 but affected by downsizing in its later years, MTV's news and documentary division was noted for its coverage of music, politics, lifestyle, and pop culture that was geared toward the network's younger audiences. Paramount Global also announces the consolidation of Showtime Networks and MTV Entertainment Studios into a single \"studio\" unit, and the nine separate operations teams of the Paramount Media Networks cable channels into one portfolio group. [265][266] 10 CNN's Kaitlan Collins moderated a town hall with Donald Trump at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, in front of an audience primarily made of likely Republican primary voters. The former president and 2024 Republican presidential candidate made numerous false claims (including repeating voter fraud allegations in his 2020 presidential election loss); reiterated his support of the 2021 U.S. Capitol attack; credited himself for appointing three of the six Supreme Court justices who overruled the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion ruling in the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision; and sidestepped questions about whom he supported in the Russia–Ukraine war and if he supported a national abortion ban during the event. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav and CNN Global CEO Chris Licht defended the decision to hold the town hall; however, media observers, CNN staffers, and Trump critics across the political spectrum denounced it for appearing to \"normalize\" his candidacy—despite Trump being the subject of multiple criminal and civil cases (including federal and state investigations into his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, and a New York civil trial that concluded the day prior, in which he was found liable of sexually abusing and defaming former Elle columnist E. Jean Carroll, remarks about whom Trump made during the event were amended into a separate defamation lawsuit against Trump, filed by Carroll in 2019, on May 22), and his tendency to make false claims and spread disinformation. In response to the event, legal commentator Tristan Snell said he would no longer appear on CNN under its current leadership. The town hall was watched by 3.1 million viewers according to Nielsen, lower than that of the network's July 2022 town hall with President Joe Biden (3.7 million). [267][268]\n\n[269][270]\n\n[271] 15 WideOpenWest announces it will discontinue its in-house pay television services, Ultra TV (a traditional pay-TV service relying on QAM/IP-based set-top boxes that launched in 2011) and WOW tv+ (an IPTV service using Android TV infrastructure that launched in March 2020), and migrate its remaining video customers—totaling 117,100 subscribers as of Q1 2023, a 6.2% decline from Q4 2022—to YouTube TV, under a partnership that wil see the Alphabet-owned vMVPD provider be offered as part of WOW!'s Internet bundle, beginning that Summer. [272][273]\n\n[274][275]\n\n[note 12] Country singer Reba McEntire, who earlier served as an advisor in the Knockout rounds for the 23rd season of The Voice, was announced to succeed outgoing coach Blake Shelton—the last of the NBC music competition series' four original coaches, who earlier announced his departure prior to the Season 23 premiere—for the 24th season. The semifinals, which followed a real-time voting structure without an \"Instant Save\" feature for the first time since Season 5, saw both artists coached by Shelton, Grace West and NOVIAS, advancing to the following week's final round; both artists would go on to lose to eventual winner Gina Miles, who was coached by former One Direction member and debuting coach Niall Horan, making him the series' tenth overall winning coach and the third coach to win on their first attempt. [276][277]\n\n[278][279] 17 Mission Broadcasting announces it will acquire MyNetworkTV affiliate WADL/Mount Clemens, Michigan from Adell Broadcasting Corp. for $75 million. Clinton Township-based Adell, which signed on WADL in May 1989, will retain ownership of religious broadcaster The Word Network and radio station WFDF/Farmington Hills. Upon closure, Mission intends to contract with partner company Nexstar Media Group to provide operational services for WADL, which it planned to turn into Detroit's affiliate of The CW (a network majority owned by Nexstar); the station briefly affiliated with the network on September 1 (replacing WKBD), before moving to Scripps-owned WMYD due to a dispute between Adell and Mission/Nexstar over their affiliation contract. The sale was approved eleven months later on April 23, 2024; however because of issues concerning Nexstar's management of Mission-owned WPIX/New York City (which resulted in a $1.82-million fine, and a requirement for Mission to sell the station to Nexstar or an independent third-party to comply with FCC ownership rules that the LMA's structure had purportedly violated due to attributable interests in the latter's involvement with WPIX), the approval was conditioned on Nexstar not being involved in financing Mission's purchase of the station, Mission enforcing limits to performance bonuses and ad revenues provided to Nexstar under any LMA between the two groups, the station limiting carriage of Nexstar-provided programming to no more than 15% of the station's weekly programming time (a clause normally applied to local programming provided by a station operator under LMA rules that likely constrains WADL from carrying the full CW schedule as intended, particularly as Scripps plans to drop it from WMYD in September 2024 as part of a chain-wide disaffiliation from the network), and that any SSA cannot include an option for Nexstar to purchase WADL outright. [280][281]\n\n[282][283]\n\n[284][285] 19 Citadel Communications announces that it will sell independent station WSNN-LD/Sarasota, Florida to Nexstar Media Group for $1 million. The transaction, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, will combine the station with Nexstar's existing Tampa–St. Petersburg duopoly of WFLA (NBC) and WTTA (MyNetworkTV), and marks Citadel's exit from broadcasting; the company—which acquired WSNN in 2009—had owned nine major-network stations in the Midwest and New England (including current Nexstar properties WHBF/Rock Island–Davenport, KCAU/Sioux City and WIVT/Binghamton) at various points from its founding in 1982 until 2019. The sale was finalized on July 20. [286][287]\n\n[288][289] 22 Fifteen months to the date after it was first announced, Tegna announces it has terminated its deal to be acquired by hedge fund Standard General. The $8.6-billion deal, which was originally slated to be completed in the second half of 2022, had faced regulatory hurdles (the FCC's Media Bureau had designated the deal for a hearing by an administrative law judge in February), scrutiny from lawmakers and labor unions concerned over job losses (in part because the deal did not address conflicts with stations operated by Cox Media Group—whose majority owner, Apollo Global Management, helped finance the deal—in four markets), and a deadline for Standard General to arrange financing for the deal on this date. As a result of the deal's termination, Tegna (which owns and operates 68 stations in 54 markets) announces a share repurchase plan and the collection of a $136 million termination fee from Standard General. [290][291]\n\n[292] 23 Netflix begins cracking down on unauthorized password sharing between subscribers and non-paying customers in the U.S. by introducing an $8/month \"extra member\" option to permit access to users who do not live in the account holder's household, and intending to block devices attempting to access a user's Netflix account without paying over a certain timeframe. Netflix initially tested the \"extra member\" program—which resulted in account cancellations in countries where paid-sharing has been implemented—to primary account holders in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru in 2022, and formally commenced paid-sharing in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain In February 2023. [293][294]\n\n[note 13] 24 Gray Television files a lawsuit in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals that requests to vacate a $518,283 fine issued by the FCC in July 2021 (which was upheld on appeal in a 3–1 vote by the FCC Media Bureau in October 2022), pertaining to a July 2020 non-license asset deal between Gray and Denali Media Holdings that saw the former acquire and transfer the CBS affiliation rights for Anchorage from KTVA (now a Rewind TV affiliate) to Gray-owned KYES (now KAUU). Because Gray already owned NBC affiliate KTUU, the FCC considered the transaction as equivalent to purchasing a second top-four station in violation of FCC duopoly regulations. Gray—which acquired KAUU (then a lower-rated MyNetworkTV affiliate) in 2016—contends the FCC had no authority to regulate the affiliation purchase as it did not involve a license transfer, that its regulation of a \"functional equivalent\" to the agency's Top-4 Rule via the fine exceeds the agency's regulatory authority, and that the fine violates the First Amendment by penalizing Gray's programming decisions without furthering a \"legitimate\" government interest. [295][296]\n\n[297] 29 Silver Chalice acquires majority control of Stadium from Sinclair Broadcast Group (which co-founded the broadcast/streaming sports network with the Chicago White Sox subsidiary in 2017, as a reconfiguration of Sinclair's American Sports Network syndication service). Sinclair cites that the decision to sell its controlling stake in Stadium was due to insufficient viewership to justify continued financing, refuting a report by Front Office Sports disclosing the purchase that it was tied to financial issues related to the recent bankruptcy of its Diamond Sports Group unit. Stadium will maintain its affiliation agreements with Sinclair-run stations, while Sinclair will continue to supply some programming for the network. [298][299] 30 One week after failing to make a rights payment before the end of its fee grace period, Diamond Sports Group informs the San Diego Padres that it will no longer provide financing to Bally Sports San Diego that would enable the regional sports network to continue paying fees to the team. The Padres' local television rights consequently reverted to the team and Major League Baseball following that evening's game against Miami (the first of a three-game away series), marking the first instance since Diamond's March 14 bankruptcy filing that it returned the local MLB broadcast rights to a franchise. The league took over production of the Padres' regional telecasts starting with the May 31 Padres–Marlins game, and began carrying them on alternate channels on Cox, Spectrum, U-verse, DirecTV and Fubo within the team's home market, along with, for the first time ever, a blackout-free, direct-to-consumer option via MLB.tv. Game announcers Don Orsillo, Mark Grant and Bob Scanlan will remain on the broadcasts as they are directly employed by the Padres. [300][301]\n\n[note 14] Date Event Source 4 Chuck Todd announces that he will stepping down as moderator of Meet the Press after nine years. Todd's tenure as moderator, which would end on September 10, saw the NBC program launch into other ventures (including the NBC News Now extension show Meet The Press Now, which Welker co-hosts and had originally debuted on MSNBC in 2015 as MTP Daily, weekly podcasts and a documentary film festival), and Todd himself facing criticism from some viewers and media critics for not pushing back against false statements made by guests (particularly those made by former president Donald Trump, his administration's officials, and his archconservative supporters in political leadership). Todd will be succeeded as MTP moderator on September 17 by NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker, who will move from the co-anchor chair at Saturday Today to become the political talk show's first female moderator (since co-creator Martha Rountree's 1947–53 tenure as its original host), as well as the first person of color to regularly serve as the program's moderator (Welker is of mixed Black–Caucasian heritage). [302][303]\n\n[304] 6 The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead reports that Red River Broadcasting has exercised an option to terminate the sale of Fox affiliates KQDS/Duluth–Superior and KVRR/Fargo–Moorhead to Forum Communications. The $24-million deal, first announced in November 2021, was dependent on the FCC approving a waiver of ownership rules prohibiting the combination of two full-power \"Big Four\" outlets in the same market, in order to allow a duopoly between KVRR and Forum-owned ABC affiliate WDAY. The FCC, which has only once approved such a \"Big Four\" duopoly (in 2019), had not yet considered the Fargo waiver. (Forum, which also owns The Forum and News Tribune newspapers in the respective cities, would have had no such issues in Duluth as it has no existing television properties in that market.) [305][306]\n\n[note 15] 7 Warner Bros. Discovery announces the departure of Chris Licht as CEO of its CNN Global division after just over one year. Licht had already ceded operational control of the network to WBD Chief Corporate Operating Officer David Leavy in the fallout from the Donald Trump town hall meeting, though the ouster came in the aftermath of the June 2 publication of a less-than-flattering Atlantic article documenting Licht's short but tumultuous tenure at CNN. [307][308]\n\n[309] Actor Jay Johnston is arrested by the FBI for his alleged involvement in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The comedian/actor (known for his roles in Mr. Show with Bob and David, The Sarah Silverman Program and Bob's Burgers) was charged by the U.S. Department of Justice on counts that include civil disorder, entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, and impeding passage through Capitol property. [310] 11 The 76th Tony Awards air on CBS and Paramount+ from New York's United Palace, with Ariana DeBose as host. Notable winners included Kimberly Akimbo (Best Musical), Leopoldstadt (Best Play), and the first two non-binary performers to win acting awards (J. Harrison Ghee for Some Like It Hot and Alex Newell for Shucked). The ceremony and telecast were initially postponed on May 12 after organizers for the Tonys were denied a waiver request from the Writers Guild of America to use pre-written material during the Guild's strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (both CBS and Paramount+ are AMPTP members). But by May 16, organizers agree to ceremony alterations—including refraining from using a script and placing an emphasis on live performances from Tony-nominated shows—thus allowing the event to proceed without a WGA waiver or picket line. [311][312]\n\n[313] 12 The Denver Nuggets defeat the Miami Heat, 94–89, in Game 5 of the 2023 NBA Finals to win their first championship in franchise history; the Nuggets, in their first-ever Finals appearance, defeated the Heat in four of five games in the best-of-seven series; ABC carried the NBA Finals exclusively for the 21st consecutive year. This year's NBA playoffs, which began on April 15 (and were televised on TNT, ESPN, ABC and NBA TV—with each team's regional broadcaster also televising local coverage of First Round games, except for most weekend games that ABC televised nationally), saw ESPN/ABC carry the Western Conference Finals and TNT carry the Eastern Conference Finals, per the alternating exclusivity rotation under the NBA's contracts with ESPN Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Sports. [314][315]\n\n[316]\n\n[note 16] Pat Sajak announces on social media that he will retire as host of Wheel of Fortune at the conclusion of its 41st season in mid-2024; he will remain with the program thereafter as a consultant. Sajak has hosted the Sony/CBS-distributed game show since December 1981, when he succeeded Chuck Woolery on the now-defunct network version (Sajak would leave that version in January 1989, six months prior to its move from NBC to CBS, to host his own late-night talk show for the latter network), and began hosting the syndicated version when it debuted in September 1983. On June 27, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest will succeed Sajak as host for the 2024–25 season. [317][318] 13 The Vegas Golden Knights defeat the Florida Panthers, 9–3, in Game 5 of the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals to win their first championship in franchise history; the Golden Knights, which began play in the NHL six years prior, defeated the Panthers in four of five games in the best-of-seven series. TNT, TBS and TruTV simulcasted this year's Stanley Cup Finals, per the alternating rotation under the NHL's contracts with ESPN Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Sports. It marked both the first time that the three networks carried the championship series and the first time since 1994 (when it was carried nationally by ESPN and regionally by New York City-based MSG) that the Finals aired exclusively on cable in the U.S. This year's Stanley Cup playoffs began on April 17, and was televised on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, TBS and TNT, with each franchise's regional broadcaster also televising local coverage of First Round games (except for weekend games that ABC televised nationally). [319][320]\n\n[note 17] Sports analyst/commentator Shannon Sharpe announces he will be leaving the FS1 morning sports talk show Skip and Shannon: Undisputed, which he has co-hosted since its debut in September 2016, following that day's broadcast. It was then announced that the show would take a hiatus until August 28 due to Fox Sports failing to find a new debate partner with Skip Bayless. [321][322]\n\n[323] 20 The NBA's Utah Jazz signs a multi-year agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group to broadcast their regionally televised games and other team-specific programs on the company's Salt Lake City duopoly of KUTV (CBS) and KJZZ (independent), effective with the league's 2023–24 season; the stations replace Warner Bros. Discovery-owned AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain and Root Sports Northwest as the Jazz's regional television partners. The deal also marks the team's return to KJZZ, which previously held over-the-air telecast rights to Jazz games from 1993 to 2009. Team owner Ryan Smith's holding company, Smith Entertainment Group, also starts a new in-house production division, SEG Media, to produce the telecasts, which will also be carried on a new subscription streaming service scheduled to launch in October. Game announcers Craig Bolerjack, Thurl Bailey and Holly Rowe will remain on the broadcasts as they are directly employed by the Jazz. [324][325]\n\n[note 18] 21 Television presenter Geraldo Rivera announces he has quit the Fox News talk show The Five, which he has co-hosted since January 2022. On June 29, the same day his final episode was scheduled to air, Rivera announced that he would be leaving Fox News entirely after having quit the program; he later alleged in a July 13 appearance on The View that a \"toxic [work] relationship\" with an unnamed Five co-host led to his departure. [326][327]\n\n[328] 27 Roku and CBS Sports announce a multi-year deal to become the exclusive American media partners for the Formula E electric motorsport series. The deal marks the first sports rights agreement for Roku and expands CBS's existing relationship with the promotion; Roku will stream 11 races per season on the Roku Channel and CBS will carry five races per season that will also be streamed on Paramount+, with all races carried by the two streaming services being accessible through Roku's live-streaming sports aggregation platform. [329] 28 As part of a multi-year agreement that also extends their existing carriage contract for NFL Network and expands its distribution to co-owned DirecTV Stream and U-verse, NFL Media and DirecTV announce that the latter will add NFL RedZone to the lineups of its subscription television services. The addition of RedZone will allow DirecTV subscribers to continue to view regional NFL broadcasts not carried within their home market in some capacity, after the league's December 2022 deal with Google to distribute the package to YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime Channels customers resulted in DirecTV losing residential carriage rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket out-of-market sports package following the 2022 season. [330]\n\n[note 19] 29 Nexstar Media Group fires news director Stanton Tang and assistant news director Amy Fox from NBC affiliate WOOD/Grand Rapids, following an internal investigation into a leaked memo urging reporters and producers to cover fewer stories on West Michigan-area Pride Month events because of criticism from conservative viewers over related stories aired earlier that month on its newscasts. Tang—who, in the memo, had asked reporters to only cover Pride events if considered newsworthy and to pursue viewpoints reflecting \"both sides\" of the story—had also been accused by station journalists of having his own right-leaning views influence editorial decisions (occasionally sending links to Twitter posts from conservative news outlets and commentators as story ideas in emails to reporters), and of fostering a hostile work environment within the news department (including pressuring and getting into intense arguments with journalists that caused some to take sick leave due to mental anguish, and discouraging them from voting in the 2022 Michigan gubernatorial and U.S. House primaries, only to later acknowledge he voted in that election, in possible violation of voter intimidation laws); prior complaints about Tang's workplace conduct allegedly went unaddressed when brought up to WOOD general manager Julie Brinks and to Nexstar management. News producers Luke Stier and Madeline Odle were also terminated for leaking information about the memo to local media and broadcast industry outlets. Veteran television executive Steven Ackermann was appointed as interim news director on June 30. [333][334] 30 In what the network describes as a move meant to \"identify additional cost savings,\" ESPN lays off about 20 on-air personalities. The notable names confirmed on this date to be exiting include NBA analysts Jalen Rose and Jeff Van Gundy; NFL studio analysts Matt Hasselbeck, Keyshawn Johnson, Rob Ninkovich, and Steve Young; NFL draft expert Todd McShay; boxing analyst and This Just In host Max Kellerman; college football analyst David Pollack; college basketball analyst LaPhonso Ellis; veteran reporter/host Suzy Kolber; and SportsCenter anchors Neil Everett and Ashley Brewer. It is the third round of layoffs this year at ESPN, following two waves affecting behind-the-scenes staffers earlier in the Spring. [335][336]"
