        "text": "It's been a big week for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nKamala HQ / Via x.com\n\nLast Sunday, President Joe Biden announced that he would not be seeking reelection in 2024 and put his support behind his veep. Democrats quickly rallied around Harris (and so did social media). Her campaign raised $126 million in just three days and has given Democrats a renewed sense of hope.\n\nSince many voters aren't familiar with Harris's background and achievements, here are 18 quick facts about the vice president turned presidential candidate:\n\n1.Kamala Devi Harris was born on Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a biologist whose research informed advances in hormone-positive breast cancer treatment.\n\n2.Her father, Donald J. Harris, is a professor of economics emeritus at Stanford. Donald J. Harris came to America from Jamaica in 1961.\n\n3.Kamala Harris has one sibling, a younger sister. Born in 1967, Maya Lakshmi Harris is a lawyer and writer.\n\n4.The name Kamala means lotus, and it's also another name for Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of prosperity and beauty.\n\n5. Her parents divorced when she was 7, and for the next few years, Harris lived with her mother and sister in Berkeley. She was one of a group of children of color who were bused across town to a majority-white school as part of 1960s desegregation efforts.\n\nTwitter: @KamalaHarris\n\nHarris has credited the busing program for laying the foundation for her career in politics by granting her access to a better education, like in the above tweet from 2018.\n\n6.After her mother accepted a position at McGill University in Montreal, Harris went to junior high and high school in Canada. After high school, she returned to the US to attend college at the prestigious HBCU, Howard University.\n\n7.Harris went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings College (now known as University of California College of the Law, San Francisco).\n\n8. After passing the bar, Harris worked as an assistant district attorney for the Alameda prosecutor's office. During this period, she specialized in prosecuting cases of child sexual assault.\n\nTwitter: @notcapnamerica\n\nHarris has shared that one of her close friends growing up was molested by a family member. She added, \"A big part of the reason I wanted to become a prosecutor was to protect people like her.\"\n\n9.In 1994, she dated Willie Brown, then the Speaker of the California State Assembly and a two-time mayor of San Francisco. Though right-wing attacks paint the relationship as an extramarital affair, Brown had been estranged from his wife for over a decade by the time he and Harris dated.\n\n10.In 1998, Harris went on to work as an assistant district attorney in San Francisco. She led the Career Criminal Division, where she supervised five attorneys prosecuting cases ranging from homicide and robbery to sexual assault.\n\n11.In 2001, she dated talk show host Montel Williams, pictured here with Harris on the right, and his daughter Ashley Williams, left.\n\n12.In 2003, Harris ran for district attorney in San Francisco and won, beating out her former boss Terence Hallinan. She held this role for seven years, from 2004 to 2011.\n\n13. In 2010, Harris ran for Attorney General of California and won. She served in this role from 2011 to 2017. She was the first woman, the first Black person, and the first person of South Asian descent to hold this office in California.\n\nTwitter: @patrynard\n\nDuring this time, Harris negotiated a $26-billion multi-state settlement for homeowners suffering from big banks' mishandling of the foreclosure crisis. She also created Open Justice, a public database that helped hold California law enforcement accountable.\n\nShe also spoke and acted in support of same-sex marriage, writing, \"The Supreme Court has described marriage as a fundamental right 14 times since 1888. The time has come for this right to be afforded to every citizen.\"\n\n14.In 2014, Harris married entertainment lawyer and current second gentleman Doug Emhoff. The two met in 2013 when a friend of Harris set them up on a date. Harris is stepmom to Emhoff's two kids, who affectionately call her \"Momala.\"\n\n15. In 2016, Harris won the election for senator of California. She served in this role from 2017 to 2021. She went viral during this period for questioning Jeff Sessions on Russia and for her sharp questions during the confirmation hearing of Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nTwitter: @BuzzFeedNews\n\nThese two moments highlighted her ability to ask probing questions and refusal to back down when answers were unsatisfactory.\n\n16.Harris ran for president in 2020 but ultimately dropped out of the race. In March 2020, she endorsed President Joe Biden as a candidate who could \"unify the people.\" After pledging to choose a woman of color as his running mate, Biden announced Harris as his VP in August 2020.\n\n17.When it comes to her personal style, Harris clearly feels at home in a sharp pantsuit.\n\n18.Finally, when she's not working, Harris enjoys cooking. In 2020, she shared a series of charming cooking videos on YouTube."
