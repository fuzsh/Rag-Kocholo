        "text": "Of the 266 Popes who reigned for two thousand years, close to a hundred sleep forever in the Vatican Grottoes, underneath the Basilica of St. Peter’s.\n\nThe list doesn’t include 41 anti-Popes buried in the Papal states or elsewhere in the European continent.\n\nIn the Grottoes, the most venerated place is a memorial over the tomb of Peter the Apostle, the first Pope.\n\nHoly Fathers canonized as saints, like John Paul II, John XXIII, Gregory the Great, Innocent XI and Boniface IV, repose upstairs, some of them in glass coffins with wax or metal death masks, in the basilica chapels.\n\nOthers were lost, kicked out or buried in other churches.\n\nJulius II, sworn enemy of the Borgias, dug up the tomb of his predecessor, Borgia Pope Alexander VI. The body ended up in Spain, interred with another Borgia Pope, Callixtus III.\n\nThe Vatican was a battleground for Europe’s great houses. During the Renaissance, it was the Spanish Borgias and the Florentine Medicis.\n\nThe Borgias produced three popes – Calixtus III, Alexander VI and his great-great-great-grandson Innocent X. The Medicis had four – Leo X, Clement VII, Pius IV and Leon XI.\n\nThe Borgias committed adultery, incest, simony, theft, bribery and murder by arsenic poisoning, no better than the power-hungry Medicis who employed violence to gain their ends, ala Mario Puzo’s “Godfather” series.\n\nBut both families sponsored great artists and the Popes they produced had strengths commensurate with their weaknesses.\n\nAlexander VI, who committed his first murder aged 12, slept with his daughter Lucrezia Borgia and fathered eight children by at least three women by the time he bribed his way into the papacy, was a capable administrator and astute diplomat “however questionable his means of doing so.” He also built the Borgia Apartments decorated by Pinturicchio.\n\nJulius II, famous for his long, bloody wars and “unnatural vices” conducted himself as an emperor-pope but started the 120 year construction of St. Peter’s and took two of the greatest Renaissance masters, Michelangelo and Raphael, under his wing.\n\nHis successor, 38-year old Medici prince, Leo X, the son of Lorenzo the Magnificent, was in Florence, gravely ill of venereal disease when Julius died and had to be carried to Rome in a litter.\n\nBut the Medici bribed the cardinals to elect him as pope. They did so, convinced he’d die soon. He recovered in a snap the moment he clinched the throne.\n\nWhen some cardinals conspired to kill him with poisoned bandages for his fistula, Leo ordered a hangman to get rid of one conspirator in his cell. The rest he commanded to be dragged by horses through Rome’s streets, their flesh gouged by red-hot pincers.\n\nLeo was most famous for granting indulgences – pardon for sin in exchange for donations to rebuild St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nThis fueled the Protestant Reformation. Its prime instigator, German Augustinian monk Martin Luther, condemned indulgences as “frauds against the faithful and criminal offenses against God”.\n\nNo matter, Leo X lived as a hedonist. He had dinners with peacock’s tongue dishes, nightingales flying out of pies and naked children climbing out of puddings.\n\n“God has given us the papacy. Let us enjoy it,” he quipped.\n\nTo support his lifestyle, Leo took on loans, pledging churches, the Villa Medici, Vatican silverware, tapestries, valuable manuscript collections and the very Chair of Peter, a relic on which the Apostle once sat.\n\nAdrian VI, the only Dutchman in the history of the papacy, succeeded him, but reigned just a year and 8 months.\n\nClement VII, the second Medici to become Pope, lasted 11 years, through The Sack of Rome and the English Reformation when Protestantism became a separate religion in Germany and the English church broke away from Rome over Henry VIII’s divorce.\n\nAnd there’s a string of lecherous pontiffs.\n\nIn 964, a 27 year old John XII was beaten to death by a jealous husband who caught him banging his wife. Elected pope aged 18, he raped women in the basilica, made toasts with the devil, maimed and mutilated those who opposed him.\n\nThe 15th-century Pope Paul II whose “sexual proclivities aroused a good deal of speculation” had two weaknesses — for good-looking young men and for melons — “though he enjoyed watching the former being tortured while he gorged himself on the latter.”\n\nBenedict IX was accused of rape, adultery, homosexuality and bestiality. “His life as a pope was so vile, so foul, so execrable, that I shudder to think of it,” a later pontiff, Victor III, summed up.\n\nIf it’s not sex, it’s greed, corruption and racism, among countless things.\n\nPaul IV, “the worst pope of the 16th century”, “opened the most savage campaign against the Jews”, forcing them into ghettos and destroying synagogues.\n\nHe initiated the Vatican’s Fig leaf campaign and threatened to whitewash the Sistine Chapel ceiling. He banned all books written by Protestants, together with Italian and German translations of the Latin Bible.\n\nEven before Paul IV died, rioting crowds subjected his statue to a mock trial before beheading it and dumping it in the Tiber River.\n\nAnother Pontiff, Formosus, who died in 896, was exhumed by Stephen VI. He had the corpse clad in papal vestments, seated on a throne and tried for various crimes in the Cadaver Synod.\n\nThe court found the cadaver unworthy of the pontificate, tore off his papal vestments, cut off the three fingers of his right hand, which he used in consecrations, and threw him into the Tiber.\n\nA monk fished out Formosus later and re-buried him in St. Peter’s.\n\nA number of Popes suffered horrible deaths – about 31 were martyred; ten, murdered.\n\nJohn VIII, one of the ablest pontiffs of the 9th century, was poisoned and beaten to death with a hammer.\n\nIn 99 AD, Emperor Trajan condemned Clement I for preaching the faith and ordered the pontiff tossed into the sea with an anchor around his neck.\n\nEmperor Valerian beheaded Sixtus II in 258 AD.\n\nStephen I was sitting on his throne and holding mass when the emperor’s men stormed into the room and beheaded him.\n\nCallixtus I was either “thrown down a well” or “murdered by a rioting mob”.\n\nMartin I was exiled to the Crimea in 654 and starved to death. Clement VII was poisoned. Benedict VI was imprisoned then strangled in 974 by order of Boniface VII.\n\nThe Church and the state squabbled a lot. Monarchs and nobilities meddled with the clergy. Political interests corrupted the papacy.\n\nReformer Gregory VII deposed and excommunicated German King Henry IV who seized Rome in 1084 and exiled the pontiff.\n\nA pretender, an anti-Pope of Henry’s choosing, crowned him in St. Peter’s. His son and successor, Henry V, also fought with the Pope and forced Paschal II to crown him as emperor.\n\nIn the 13th century, French King Philip IV had a spat with Boniface VIII and tried to expel His Holiness. When French Clement V became Pope, he relocated the papacy to Avignon, in accordance with Philip’s wishes.\n\nThere, by the River Rhone, John XXII, Clement’s successor, who also happened to be French, built the Palace of the Popes.\n\nThe church split between Rome and Avignon, with two Popes, at one time even three, excommunicating each other, during the 39-year Great Western Schism which almost destroyed Christendom.\n\nOnly in 1377 did Gregory XI return to Rome, on the urging of St. Catherine of Sienna. The Schism ended in the beginning of the Renaissance papacy, when a general council elected Martin V in 1417.\n\nBut there was more trouble from France.\n\nIn the late 17th century, Pius VI condemned the French Revolution. French troops captured him and he died a prisoner in France.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte captured his successor, the levitating Pius VII, and imprisoned him as well.\n\nIn 1849, Italians proclaimed a second Roman Republic and French troops helped restore Pius IX. But came 1870, Italian troops occupied the papal lands and proclaimed Rome the capital of Italy’s new kingdom.\n\nIn the next two hundred years, the power struggle between church and state raged on. It was only in 1929, in the reign of Pius XI, that the Vatican became a free city-state.\n\nHowever, Pius XI and Pius XII feared Communism and refused to make pronouncements against Mussolini, Hitler and Franco.\n\nPius XII was accused of anti-Semitism when he failed to condemn the genocide of Rome’s Jews even as Nazis hauled them off to be gassed in Auschwitz.\n\nAs Vicars of Christ, Popes wielded great power. After the fall of the Roman Empire, they functioned as statesmen and rulers in their own right just as they were patrons of the arts.\n\nLeo I protected Rome from the Huns and persuaded Atilla not to sack the city in 452. Leo IV fortified the basilica when the Saracens pillaged it in 846, transforming the Vatican to the Leonine City.\n\nThe 6th century Gregory the Great was a patron of musicians, singers, students, and teachers. He is credited with the Gregorian chant.\n\nBenedict XIV kept the peace and implemented financial as well as liturgical reforms, making Rome Europe’s religious and cultural capital. Leo XIII, the “Rosary Pope”, reconciled the Church with the masses and ushered it into the industrial age.\n\nDespite being “infallible”, Holy Fathers were human. The best leaders among them showed flaws. The scoundrels had redeeming virtues.\n\nInnocent III, the greatest medieval pope, unified the Papal States. Yet he called for the Fourth Crusade, which culminated in the sacking of Constantinople, where Christians murdered Christians.\n\nSixtus IV commissioned the Sistine Chapel. But he also peddled indulgences and church positions and began the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nUrban VIII patronized art on a grand scale. The greatest sculptor of the Baroque age, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, was his protégé. But he imprisoned Galileo and banned all his works.\n\nGregory XIII commissioned the Gregorian calendar but emptied the coffers of the Vatican.\n\nThe corrupt, the debauched, the ruthless, the mediocre and those who never lasted long enough to create a difference outnumbered the great princes of the church.\n\nSome Popes reigned only for a couple of weeks to over a month.\n\nUrban VII had the shortest reign – 13 days. He contracted malaria the day after his election and died before he could be crowned. Boniface VI reigned 16 days; Celestine IV, 17 days and Theodore II, 20 days.\n\nThe most recent was John Paul I, the Smiling Pope, who died in 1978, after 33 days in office.\n\nSadly, Romans don’t appreciate papal reformers and high achievers.\n\nSixtus V, the Iron Pope, accomplished the most in just five years. A retired monk hobbling on crutches when he came to the 1585 conclave, fellow cardinals elected him because they thought his reign would be brief.\n\nThen he flung away his crutches, declaring, “I’ve sought the key of heaven bent over and now I’ve found it.”\n\nSixtus V championed the Counter Reformation. He cleaned up Rome, executing 27,000 criminals and mob bosses within two years.\n\nA master urban planner, he built roads linking outlying areas to the heart of the metropolis, raised obelisks, brought fresh water by tunnel and aqueduct, built the Lateran Palace and finished the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nHe slept little and worked hard. Prudent with funds because he inherited a bankrupt treasury, he left five million crowns in the Vatican coffers when he died of malaria.\n\nYet mobs tore down his statue at the Capitol after his death.\n\nWhen another reformer, Adrian IV, the only English Pope, died choking on a fly in his wine, Romans rejoiced and placed garlands of flowers on the door of his bungling physician.\n\nFor such a Holy City, notoriety marks the Vatican’s every nook and cranny – orgies, murders, scandals, you name it.\n\nIronic too that despite the Catholics’ loathing for the occult, the heart of Christendom took its name from the Latin “vatis”, “tellers of the future”.\n\nFor a fee, fortunetellers delivered oracles on Vatican hill in ancient times until the place became a cemetery for famous Romans, a sacred Necropolis, a City of the Dead.\n\nAlthough the Vatican is home to the Pope, the Holy Father, Vicar of Christ, its original deity was pagan mother goddess Cybele, Magna Mater – Great Protector of Rome, invoked to keep out Hannibal of Carthage, the greatest enemy the Eternal City ever faced.\n\nYet barbarians sacked the city-state several times. Wars, fires and plagues ravaged its populace. Its landmarks still reek of blood after two thousand years.\n\nOn the way to St. Peter’s Basilica, today’s pilgrims cross the Bridge of the Holy Angels (Ponte Sant’ Angelo) over the Tiber River to the emperors’ tomb-turned-fortress, Sant’ Angelo.\n\nTheir ancient counterparts used the same bridge which Emperor Hadrian completed in 134 AD. Only in the olden days, Popes strung up carcasses of condemned men along this stretch, filling the city with their stench.\n\nIn his first year alone, Pope Sixtus V had more criminals’ heads impaled on spikes along the Ponte Sant’ Angelo than there were melons for sale in the markets of Rome.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of the story.\n\nIn the sixth century, the black plague ravaged Rome under Pope Saint Gregory I. Both the castle and the bridge took the name Sant’Angelo when St. Michael the Archangel appeared to the Pope in a vision, unsheathing his sword on the castle roof to mark the end of the pandemic.\n\nThe deaths didn’t stop though. During the 1450 jubilee, Ponte Sant’Angelo collapsed under the weight of pilgrim hordes stampeding to reach St. Peter’s. Hundreds drowned.\n\nHoly Fathers rebuilt the bridge several times.\n\nIn the 15th century, Medici prince, Clement VII, the illegitimate son of Pope Leo X, Lorenzo the Magnificent’s brother, allocated the bridge’s toll income to line its length with stucco angels.\n\nPope Clement VII took refuge in the castle of Sant’ Angelo when Spanish King Charles V (father of Philip II, for whom the Philippines was named) besieged Rome, slaughtering 66,000 people in eight days, raping and torturing nuns to death in the worst sacking of the city. Some 147 Swiss guards died to protect His Holiness.\n\nFrom the Castel, Clement “had to listen to the agonized screams of his poor flock” and watch as “the glory of Renaissance Rome was extinguished in blood.”\n\nTo reconcile with Charles V, the Pope crowned him as Holy Roman Emperor. However, the Pontiff refused to grant King Henry VIII’s divorce from the aunt of Charles V, Catherine of Aragon.\n\nIntent on marrying his mistress, Anne Boleyn, to have a son and heir to his throne, Henry VIII broke off with the Catholic Church and declared himself Supreme Head of the Church of England.\n\nStill, Clement VII was a patron of Benvenuto Cellini, the most important Mannerist artist. Before he ate a death cap mushroom, Clement finished constructing the bridge and has commissioned Michelangelo’s masterpiece, “The Last Judgment”, in the altar of the Sistine Chapel.\n\nNevertheless, Clement VII was not the first papal patron of Michelangelo Buonarroti, the greatest artist of all time.\n\nThe credit belongs to Julius II, the “Warrior Pope”, a syphilitic old soldier who led his Catholic troops to battle in full armor and fathered a handful of children as a cardinal, but as a Pontiff was a great patron of the arts.\n\nHe was the grandson of a fisherman but his father, Pope Sixtus IV, sharpened his eye for art.\n\nSixtus IV commissioned the Sistine Chapel, the official private chapel of the popes, meeting place of the Conclave whenever a new pope is elected.\n\nHowever, Sixtus also peddled indulgences and church offices “on an unparalleled scale,” appointed an 8-year-old boy as archbishop of Lisbon and began the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nHis son, Julius II, demolished the over a thousand year-old St. Peter’s Basilica, which Emperor Constantine the Great built in the 4th century, and started the 120-year construction of the St. Peter’s we know today.\n\nJulius II summoned Donato Bramante to serve as the basilica’s master architect and his kinsman, Raphael Sanzio, to fresco his new apartments- the “Stanze” or “Raphael Rooms”.\n\nJulius II refused to occupy the Borgia Apartments, quarters of his enemy and predecessor, Pope Alexander VI, another lover of the arts, though he bought the papacy, was greedy for sex and gold and sired bastards.\n\nAt the same time, the Pope commissioned Michelangelo to build his tomb after he saw the Pieta which the 23-year old Florentine sculpted.\n\nLa Pieta, depicting the Virgin Mary cradling Christ’s dead body, was the artist’s only signed piece. He carved his name on the Virgin’s sash when his work was attributed to someone else.\n\nBut when Michelangelo sculpted a marble statue of Julius II, the Pope asked, “What’s that under my arm?” “A Bible, your Holiness,” the artist replied. “What do I know of Bibles?” he roared, “I’m a warlord. Give me a sword instead.”\n\nMichelangelo, 8 years older than Raphael and 23 years younger than Leonardo da Vinci, never liked his fellow artists. It didn’t help that he himself wasn’t easy to like, with his bad temper and untidy habits.\n\nHe slept in his paint-stained work clothes and smelly boots – just as Raphael painted him as a sulking Heraclitus in the foreground of his famous Stanze mural, the “School of Athens”.\n\nInevitably, Raphael and Michelangelo became fierce rivals.\n\nRaphael and Bramante conspired to convince Julius II that Michelangelo should paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling to make him look bad. Painting is not Michelangelo’s forte. To accept the job is to risk his work appearing inferior versus Raphael. To refuse is to insult the Pope.\n\n“They wanted to ruin me and Raphael had a good reason for all he had of art, he had from me,” Michelangelo wrote bitterly.\n\nAgainst all odds, he toiled on the Sistine ceiling for four years – even after the money ran out. One time, he complained he hasn’t been paid for over a year. Yet he kept on painting.\n\nAt first, he hated it. He wielded the brush as he would a chisel. His paintings looked like sculptures. Only later did he start to enjoy his work.\n\nAnd despite never having painted before, Michelangelo created one of the world’s most magnificent frescoes.\n\nWhen he unveiled the Sistine ceiling in 1512, all of Rome turned up to see it. Now, 20,000 people a day admire his masterpiece.\n\nOver two decades after finishing the ceiling, Michelangelo, aged 60, returned to paint his “Last Judgement” on the altar. It took him five years.\n\nRemembering the sack of Rome, a dying Pope Clement VII suggested his theme. Problem was, critics found the nude figures “inappropriate” for a sacred place.\n\nThe fresco about the Redeemer’s second coming showed a naked Christ with a clean-shaven face borrowed from the sun god Apollo. His muscled body was that of Zeus’ son, Hercules, inspired by the Belvedere torso.\n\nMichelangelo mixed pagan gods with Dante’s “Divine Comedy” personas and Christian saints brandishing instruments of their martyrdom – St. Catherine with her cogwheel, St. Sebastian with his arrows and St. Lawrence with the grate where he was roasted.\n\nWeirdest of all, the artist painted himself as St. Bartholomew flayed alive, holding out his skin like a rubbery cast-off as he perched on a cloud.\n\nEarlier, he hid another ghoulish self-portrait, as the severed head of Holofernes – the Assyrian General whom Jewish heroine Judith decapitated, in a pendentive of the Sistine ceiling.\n\nOn the altar, Michelangelo rendered his own version of Hell, peopled by blue and green-skinned devils sporting bulging muscles, animal horns and ears, with Charon, the ferryman of the underworld, taking condemned souls across the River Styx.\n\nHis most vicious critic, the Pope’s master of ceremonies, Biagio da Cesena, he painted as Minos, King of Hell, with donkey’s ears, draped with a snake gobbling up his penis.\n\nCesena complained to the Pope himself, who jested he had no power over Hell. So, the fresco stayed.\n\nIn all, Michelangelo worked for nine popes in his lifetime. Number eight, Paul IV, cut off his pension and initiated the Vatican’s fig leaf campaign – chopping off the manhood of nude artworks and covering them up.\n\nEventually, the Council of Trent condemned nudity in religious art. Mannerist artist Daniele da Volterra (nicknamed “Il Braghettone”, “the breeches maker”) painted over the genitalia of the master’s Sistine frescoes.\n\nBy mid-sixteenth century, Pope Innocent X (who promoted Manila’s Colegio de Santo Tomas to the rank of university) ordered all exposed penises of Roman sculptures in the Vatican to be chiseled off and replaced with metal fig leaves.\n\nThe systematic mutilation of art for religion continued through Pope Pius IX to the late 18th century.\n\nToday, the statuary of the Vatican Museum remains full of marble honchos with foliage stuck between their legs. Guides conducting the Heretic Vatican Tour maintain thousands of chopped off penises have been stashed away in a vault in the Papal Apartments.\n\nMichelangelo was lucky not to witness the atrocities. He died in 1564, after a brief illness, a few weeks short of his 89th birthday and was buried, in accordance with his wishes, in the Basilica di Santa Croce, in Florence, his beloved birth city.\n\nHe died single – and gay, though scholars debate on his real sexuality to this very day. The great artist wrote hundreds of sonnets to pretty boys – models, servants and companions although at age 63, he fell for Vittoria, a “saintly widow” in her late 40’s whom he described as “a man in a woman”.\n\nMichelangelo had the last laugh too. He outlived the Italian Renaissance, his artistic style evolving from High Renaissance to stylized Mannerism. He even outlived his rival, Raphael, by 44 years.\n\nRaphael died on Good Friday, on his 37th birthday, contracting a fever for two weeks after a night of “excessive sex with his mistress”.\n\nHis still incomplete masterpiece, the “Transfiguration of Christ”, was placed beside his body as he lay in state and he was interred in Rome’s Pantheon, as he requested.\n\n(To be continued.)"
