        "text": "Papal elections in the Fifteenth Century\n\nThe election of Pope Alexander VI (1492) By Francis A. Burkle-Young\n\nAuthor of Passing the Keys\n\nI. Background -- The Reign of Innocent VIII.\n\nDuring the first four and a half years of his reign, Innocent VIII saw the deaths of nine cardinals, almost all of whom were the creations of Sixtus. Within three months of the election of Innocent death claimed Philibert Hugonet, on September 11; Stefano Nardini, on October 22; and Juan Moles de Margarit, on November 21. In 1485, Pietro Foscari died on August 11 and Giovanni d'Aragona on October 17. In 1486, Thomas Bourchier died on March 30 and Gabriele Rangoni on September 27. For nearly two years after this, no cardinals died, but in 1488 two cardinals died within a few days of each other, Charles de Bourbon l'Ancien on September 13 and Giovanni Arcimboldi on October 2. (1)\n\nBy this time the College was reduced to twenty-two members, the lowest number since the summer of 1467, twenty years before. In early 1489, the older cardinals were willing to consider, at last, the elevation of new members, since the election capitulation to which Innocent had subscribed limited the College to twenty-four members and, under these provisions, was now understrength.\n\nOn March 9, Innocent named eight new cardinals but published the names of only five of them. For the first time, Innocent had a cardinal-nephew, Lorenzo Cibo di Mari, the illegitimate son of the pope's brother, Maurizio. Innocent also elevated two curial officials who had faithfully served him from the earliest days of the reign; Ardicino della Porta was the papal secretary for negotiations with the ambassadors of princes and kings, and Antoniotto Pallavicini, one of the guardians of the conclave of 1484, was now the datarius of the Holy See. (2) Charles VIII was the only monarch to have his wishes in the matter of crown cardinals respected, in the persons of André d'Espinay, archbishop of Lyon and governor of Paris, and Pierre d'Aubusson, grand master of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, who had also recommended himself to Innocent by surrendering into the pope's hands the person of Prince Jem, brother of the Turkish sultan, Bayazid II. (3)\n\nThe three cardinals whose names were not published immediately were Giovanni de' Medici, Federico Sanseverino, and Maffeo Gherardo. The first of these received the red hat to fulfill a pledge made by Innocent at the time of Maddalena de' Medici's marriage to the pope's son, Franceschetto Cibo, in 1488. Medici's extreme youth caused the pope to order that he should not be admitted into the College for three years from the date of his creation. Federico Sanseverino was created a cardinal in gratitude for the services rendered to the Church by his father, Roberto Sanseverino, who had been captain-general of the Church during the last troublesome years of the reign of Sixtus IV. His name, too, was not published at once because of his youth. The name of Maffeo Gherardo, patriarch of Venice-an aged man of eighty-three at the time of his elevation-was withheld because the Venetians did not seem anxious to rush to Innocent's aid in his difficulties with Naples. Venice had good reason to stay out of the quarrel between Innocent and Ferrante-Mathias Corvinus, king of Hungary, and an avid supporter of Ferrante, had concluded a treaty with the Ottomans under the provisions of which the Turks would attack Venice if she came to the aid of the pope. (4)\n\nThese eight men were the only cardinals whom Innocent was able to create in his pontificate, although in the remaining three years of his reign three more cardinals died-Pierre de Foix le Jeune in the summer of 1490, Marco Barbo on March 11, 1491, and Jean Balue on October 5, 1491. (5)\n\nWith the dawning of the new year of 1492, the College of Cardinals, once the apostolic senate of the Roman church, had completed a transformation in which it had become a representative body for European monarchs and princes as well as one in which the popes could, and did, perpetuate the influence of their families in the affairs of the Church for decades after the close of their reigns. Of the twenty-three men who had some pretensions to the cardinalate at the time of the election of Eugenius IV in 1431 only three were cardinal-nephews of former pontiffs, two were crown cardinals, and two were representatives of the great Roman noble families. The remaining sixteen were able career churchmen. By contrast, of the twenty-seven cardinals alive in the closing months of the reign of Innocent VIII no fewer than ten were cardinal-nephews, eight were crown cardinals, while four were Roman nobles and one other had been given the cardinalate in recompense for his family's service to the Holy See-so only four members of the College belonged to those segments of Church life which had provided the great majority of its members sixty years before: three were curial officials and one was a pastor.\n\nThe great change in the constitution of the College during the course of the fifteenth century-especially under Sixtus IV and Innocent VIII-meant that the cardinals who met to elect Innocent's successor was a very different electorate, with very different experiences and priorities, than the men who had elected Eugenius IV, barely sixty years before.\n\nII. The Cardinals in Conclave 1492: Background for the election.\n\nThe election of Alexander VI in 1492 provides ideal circumstances in which to examine the \"new cardinalate\" of the fifteenth century in the fullness of its development. Since the death of Jean Balue on October 5, 1491, and at the death of Innocent VIII, the College of Cardinals numbered twenty-seven, all but four of whom were secularly-minded princes largely unconcerned with the spiritual life of either the Latin church or its members.\n\nThe conclave which met in the summer of 1492 was one of those for which the cardinals had ample time to prepare. From the outset of his reign, Innocent had never been a well man. Just a few weeks after his election, in October, 1484, he had fallen ill, and on March 12, 1485, he had been seized with a fever which kept him bedridden for three months. (6) His illness was so severe that on one occasion Obietto Fieschi, a protonotary apostolic, informed the Orsini that he was dead. The pope's recovery was transient, and by January 21, 1486, he was again rumored to have passed away. (7) By the following spring, the pontiff had once more regained relatively good health, but for the rest of the reign the necessity for holding a conclave to elect a successor in the near future was regarded as a strong probability. In 1490, Innocent's precarious hold on life began to ebb. The bout of illness which overtook him in August and September of that year was severe enough to cause the ambassador of Ferrara to dispatch word to his master, Ercole d'Este, that the pope was already dead. (8) The crisis of this illness, which may have been precipitated by a stroke, occurred on September 26; but within two days the pontiff had rallied once more. In the following weeks, Innocent left Rome in the hope that time spent resting at Porto d'Anzio and Ostia would aid his recovery. On November 30, he returned to Rome from his vacation, but any hopes for a full return to health were dashed within a few days when he suffered another attack of fever, as reported in a dispatch from the Mantuan ambassador, G. L. Cataneo, dated December 3, 1491. (9)\n\nInnocent's last months of ill health also were plagued with political troubles for the Italian peninsula. On January 22, 1492, the pope concluded a peace with Ferrante of Naples, which seemed to bring to an end the decades of disputes the papacy had had with that monarch and to usher in an era of peace in the south. Yet on the following April 8, Lorenzo de' Medici, whose diplomatic skill had been responsible for the maintenance of a balance of power among the Italian states, died. The removal of Lorenzo from the center stage of Italian affairs did not bode well, for he alone seemed to have the touch for negotiating an end to disputes among the various small states, each one of which jealously watched the fortunes of the others. During the late spring, Innocent seemed to improve somewhat, but on June 22-23 he was attacked by a series of violent abdominal pains as well as by an eruption on the leg. By June 30, he was seen to improve, but in the opening days of July he had a profound relapse, and it was then generally realized that the pope was truly dying. (10)\n\nAs was usual in medieval and Renaissance Rome during the last days of a pope, there was an immediate outbreak of popular lawlessness. The Roman baronage also became restless, eager to secure as much power and influence as possible during the coming vacancy. On July 15, 1492, Innocent confessed, and, on the following day, received communion for the last time. By the seventeenth many were sure that his last hour was at hand, (11) yet some inner strength caused the pope to survive another week. Meanwhile, the cardinals in curia began to take precautions to safeguard the material treasure of the Church from depredation during the coming conclave and, in particular, to see that a strong watch was placed over the person of Prince Jem, brother of the Sultan Bayazid II, who had been placed as a pawn in Innocent's custody by Pierre d'Aubusson, grand master of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. Prince Jem had fallen into Christian hands in 1482 while fleeing from a failed coup-d'etat against his elder brother, Sultan Bayazid II. The Knights of Saint John first kept him in custody at Rhodes and then in France. The Sultan remunerated the prince's captors with 45,000 ducats annually, a small price to pay for keeping a politically dangerous younger brother outside the borders of the Turkish state. Innocent VIII had secured the person of the prince in March, 1489, but only at the price of many concessions, including the cardinal's hat for d'Aubusson. The presence of Prince Jem in the West was considered the prime insurance against further inroads by the Turks, because the threat to release him to foment trouble once again among the Turks was not taken lightly by Bayazid. (12)\n\nThe cardinals employed one hundred crossbowmen for the patrol of the city, and hired eight hundred more soldiers to patrol the Vatican palace and the Borgo. (13) Giuliano della Rovere, now cardinal-bishop of Ostia e Velletri, who had wielded considerable influence over Innocent VIII, persuaded several of the baronial families to agree to a truce and to combine forces with the conservators of the city to preserve calm. (14) Conscious to the end, Innocent passed away at about nine o'clock in the evening of Wednesday, July 25, 1492. The time is established by a dispatch of Giovanni Andrea Boccaccio on the same day. (15)\n\nIII. Background and Cardinalate of Rodrigo de Lançol y Borgia\n\nAt that moment the most powerful of the cardinals, by reason of wealth, prestige and power, was Rodrigo de Lançol y Borgia, cardinal-bishop of Porto e Santa Ruffina and dean of the College. Now in the sixty-second year of his life and the thirty-seventh of his cardinalate, he had bided his time patiently, gaining immense political experience during the reigns of five popes. Now he was ready to make his bid for the throne.\n\nBorgia was born in Jativa, near Valencia, on New Year's Day, 1431, the son of Jofre de Lançol and Isabella de Borja, a sister of Alonso de Borja, then bishop of Valencia and the future Calixtus III. The parentage of the future Alexander VI and the future pontiff's relationship to Calixtus III is established in the Apostolic brief Vite ac morum honestas, dated July 11, 1447. (16) There is no doubt that the date of his birth was January 1, 1431; Borgia himself said that January 1, 1431 was his birthday, and, on another occasion, he also said that he was born on the first day of the week. In 1431, New Year's Day was a Monday, while in 1432 it fell on Tuesday. (17) When Rodrigo Borgia was about ten his father died and his mother, together with the rest of the family, removed to Valencia from their country estate at Jativa. As might be expected in the case of an able and intelligent nephew of a fifteenth-century bishop, Rodrigo was given a superior elementary education. When his uncle was made a cardinal-priest in 1444, Rodrigo's expectations materially improved. Early in his pontificate Nicholas V took the first papal notice of Rodrigo. In a dispensation, dated July 11, 1447, Nicholas allowed the sixteen-year-old Rodrigo to hold ecclesiastical office in spite of his minority. Over the next several years, Alonso de Borja gave his nephew several benefices and helped to procure others from Rome which assured the young man a sufficient income. (18) As he grew to maturity, Rodrigo attended the University of Bologna, from which, at the conclusion of his studies in 1455, he received the doctorate. (19) At that time, Borgia went to Rome and took his place as a member of his uncle's cardinalitial court. Had Alonso de Borja died as a cardinal we might well have expected to see his nephew become, in due course, a bishop, and perhaps, at the end of long service in the papal bureaucracy or in the pastorate, a cardinal. But on April 4, 1455, Alonso be Borja became Pope Calixtus III. From that moment forward, a flood of distinctions and benefices flowed down upon Rodrigo, as well as on his first cousin, Luis Juan del Mila y Borja, the pope's other favorite nephew. (20)\n\nOn May 10, 1455, only twenty days after the coronation of Calixtus, Rodrigo was made a protonotary apostolic, and then, on the following June 3, dean of the church of Santa Maria de Jativa. (21) Directly after receiving this last position, Rodrigo left Rome for Bologna in the company of his cousin Luis in order to settle his affairs there. In a secret consistory held at the Vatican on February 20, 1456, while Rodrigo was absent from Rome, he was created cardinal-deacon of San Niccolo in Carcere Tulliano. (22) On the same occasion, Luis Juan del Mila y Borja also was created a cardinal. The purpose of raising these two young men to the cardinalate is not difficult to surmise. Each pope in the medieval and Renaissance epochs found himself on his election surrounded by the servants and retainers of his recent predecessors. These men could not be relied upon to serve the interests of the newly elected pope in every way and, indeed, often owed a lasting loyalty to the family of the pontiff who had raised them to power. Thus a new pope felt most comfortable trusting the highest responsibilities of the reign to members of his own family who owed him every favor and whose fortunes would be lost in the event of a disastrous pontificate.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the bull which made Rodrigo and Luis cardinals bore the subscriptions of twelve of the nineteen living cardinals, Calixtus was not able to publish the names of his nephews immediately. The cardinals, as usual, were reluctant to accept the diminution of power inherent in the enlargement of their body and, in spite of the fact that the pontiff had compelled their signatures on a bull of creation, they were adamant in insisting that the publication not take place at once. (23) Therefore Calixtus accepted the reservation developed by Martin V in the cases of Domenico Ram and Domenico Capranica: if he were to die before formal publication, his nephews were to be admitted to the next conclave as cardinals in full standing, with seniority that dated from their secret creation. Rodrigo and Luis did not, however, have to wait for this eventuality. On Friday, September 17, 1456, when most of the cardinals had fled the discomfort of the Roman summer's end, Calixtus published their names, and at the same time added seven others to the College. (24) On the following October 18, Rodrigo left Bologna for Rome, arriving on November 16. The next day, Calixtus received him in a public consistory and presented him with the red hat. Ten days later his uncle performed the ceremony of the opening of the mouth, which gave Rodrigo the right to be heard as a cardinal in consistories. On the last day of December, 1456, Rodrigo was invested with the position of legate a latere and vicar general of the pope in the March of Ancona-one of the most important legations in the States of the Church, but a state of political unrest since the time of Eugenius IV. In order to enable the new cardinal-nephew to bear more adequately the burden of his new offices and duties, Calixtus made over to him several additional benefices and reservations. (25)\n\nThese new positions were not the only ones destined for Rodrigo by the aging Calixtus III. Without question, the single richest office in the Church was that of vicechancellor. Within this official's purview came every petition addressed to the pope, with accompanying fees; and every state act of the papacy was processed there before being dispatched to its recipient. The vicechancellor's post had been vacant since October 30, 1453, when Francesco Condulmer, cardinal-bishop of Porto e Santa Ruffina and cardinal-nephew of Eugenius IV, had died. On May 1, 1457, Calixtus appointed Rodrigo to the office, who was thus assured importance in Church affairs for the rest of his life, barring gross malfeasance. (26)\n\nOn November 26, 1457, Rodrigo returned to Rome from his legation. He was given very little time to settle into the office of vicechancellor, however, for on the following December 11 he was made general-in-chief of the pontifical army with authority over even the captain-general of the Church, nominally the highest military rank in the pope's forces. (27) This latter office was held by Rodrigo's brother, Pedro Luis. Rodrigo held this military commission for the remainder of his uncle's lifetime and was replaced, on March 9, 1459, by Antonio de' Piccolomini, nephew of the newly elected Pope Pius II. (28) On June 30, 1458, the vicechancellor also was made administrator of the diocese of Valencia, which had been vacant since Calixtus' election to the papal throne. Calixtus expressed the fullest formal confidence in Rodrigo by elevating him to the see he himself once had held. (29)</P>\n\nThe reason for the delay in giving a diocese to Rodrigo seems to have been that the pontiff wanted him to have Valencia, which Calixtus himself had held, but that Calixtus was prevented from appointing Rodrigo immediately after the papal election because of objections raised by Alfonso of Aragon, Naples, and Sicily. This may be true, because it is unlikely to have been coincidental that Calixtus advanced Rodrigo to the archdiocese on June 27, 1458, only three days after the king's death. (30)\n\nOld Calixtus had nothing more to give. In the closing days of July, he fell gravely ill; and on August 6, 1458, he was dead at the age of seventy-nine. The pontiff was comforted in his last hours by none of the family on whom he had showered so much, except for the vicechancellor, who braved the rage of the Roman mob to be with his uncle to the last. (31)\n\nIn the succeeding conclave, Borgia materially assisted in the election of Pius II and, in March, 1463, became archdeacon of the College on the death of Prospero Colonna. During the reign of Pius II, Rodrigo first began to attract unfavorable notice from his style of living, which included the presence of women in his household. A memorial from Pius exists admonishing Rodrigo to mend his ways, (32) but the papal chiding did not improve the vicechancellor's mode of living, and over the remaining years of his life he fathered more children than any other man who has ever occupied the papal chair. The children born to Rodrigo before his election to the throne were Pedro Luis, first duke of Gandia, who died in 1481; Juan, second duke of Gandia, born in 1475; Cesare, once cardinal-deacon of Santa Maria Nuova, and later captain-general of the Church, duke of the Romagna, and duc de Valentinois, born in 1476; Lucrezia, subsequently duchess of Ferrara, born in 1478; Gioffredo, later prince of Squillace, born in 1481; and Girolama, whose date of birth is unknown, later married to Gianandrea Cesarini. After he became pope, Borgia fathered at least two more children, Laura Orsini, daugher of Giulia Farnese Orsini, whose father was given out to be Orso Orsini; and Giovanni Borgia, the \"Infans Romanus,\" probably born in 1498. (33)\n\nBorgia participated in the conclave of 1464 and, as archdeacon, it fell to him both to announce the election of Paul II and to crown him. Paul was an old family friend who had seen to the personal safety of Rodrigo and his brother, Pedro Luis, during the disorders which followed the death of Calixtus III. (34)\n\nIn 1472, Rodrigo was a major figure in the election of Sixtus IV, and he performed for Sixtus the same ceremonies he had for Paul II. (35) From Sixtus, the vicechancellor obtained the right of promotion to the first suburbicarian diocese which should fall vacant, in spite of the normal rights of the archpriest of the College to such preferment. The death of Richard Olivier de Longueil, cardinal-bishop of Porto e Santa Ruffina, on August 19, 1471, was followed, on August 29, by the promotion of Filippo Calandrini to Porto e Santa Ruffina and the appointment of Borgia to Calandrini's former rank of cardinal-bishop of Albano. (36) Within a few days of this event, Sixtus also granted to Borgia in commendam the ancient monastery of Subiaco. (37) With elevation to a suburbicarian diocese, Borgia placed himself under obligation to receive ordination to the priesthood and consecration as bishop. No documents seem to remain to indicate just when these rites were undergone but, on October 31, 1471, Sixtus was formally addressing the new cardinal-bishop as \"Venerable Brother\" instead of \"Beloved Son,\" thus indicating the change in his status. (38)\n\nIn the following Christmastide, December 23, 1471, Borgia received the first major diplomatic charge of his career, as legate to the Spanish monarchs for the purpose of promoting preparations for a crusade. (39) From January 8, he served a brief term as chamberlain of the College, entrusted with supervision of all the revenues due to all the cardinals. As chamberlain, he was the successor of Filippo Calandrini, and was succeeded by Guillaume d'Estouteville. (40) On May 15, 1472, Borgia resigned the office of chamberlain and left Rome for the port of Ostia from which he embarked, on the following day, for Spain. He landed at Valencia on June 18. (41)\n\nRodrigo's legatine experience was uneventful. The only incident worthy of notice in slightly more than a year was the storm of October 10, 1473, which sank one of the two ships that was bringing Borgia and his suite back to Italy. Seventy-five members of the cardinal's household were lost as well as 30,000 florins worth of goods. Borgia, safe on the other ship, arrived in Rome on October 24. On the following day, he was received by Sixtus in a public consistory where he gave an account of his activities during his absence. (42)\n\nIn the summer of 1476, Sixtus, together with several of the cardinals, including Borgia, fled Rome at the outbreak of the plague. During the travels of the pontifical court, Sixtus was informed of the death of Filippo Calandrini, cardinal-bishop of Porto e Santa Ruffina. (43) On July 24, Sixtus promoted Borgia to the vacant suburbicarian diocese. (44) During the late summer and early autumn of 1477, Borgia served briefly as legate to Naples for the purpose of crowning Juana d'Aragona, the new wife of King Ferrante. (45)\n\nThroughout the reign of Sixtus IV, Borgia was loaded with many additional offices which yielded him an even vaster revenue. (46) For example, on July 8, 1482, he was made administrator of the diocese of Cartagena in Murcia, a position he would retain until his elevation to the papacy. (47) The wealth thus accumulated over the years put the cardinal-vicechancellor in a most unusual position in the opening weeks of 1479. He lent the Holy See the sum of 15,000 ducats, paid in two installments, for which he received, as security, a mortgage on the cities of Nepi and Civita Castellana, and another on the fortress of Anticoli in the Campagna. (48) When he took over the administration of his sureties, he found the castle of Nepi a total ruin and reconstructed it along the more modern lines we see today.\n\nOn January 22, 1483, the death of Guillaume d'Estouteville, cardinal-bishop of Ostia e Velletri, made Borgia dean of the College, while in the same year he became archpriest of the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore and cardinal-protector of the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem. (49) As dean of the College, Borgia participated in the conclave of 1484 which elected Innocent VIII. (50) On January 27 1485, the new pontiff made Borgia archbishop of Seville, but at the wish of Isabella, Queen of Castille, he resigned this office a few days after his appointment so that it might be regranted to Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. (51) On October 9, 1489, Borgia was named perpetual administrator of the diocese of Majorca, and took possession of this new charge by proxy in the following March. (52) These two dioceses were only the largest and most opulent of the benefices granted to him under Innocent VIII, the revenue from which augmented his already stupendous wealth, reputed to be greater than that of any other man in Christendom. (53) This wealth gave Borgia unparalleled opportunities to enjoy the acme of luxurious living obtainable in Renaissance Rome and he did not let the chance pass. He closed a cardinalitial career filled with spectacle and entertainment by offering the people of Rome their first bullfight. The occasion was the conquest of Granada in 1492. (54) Now, at the age of sixty-one, the cardinal-vicechancellor was ready to marshal all of the wealth and experience he had attained over the decades at the highest level of Church government in order to attain the papal throne.\n\nBorgia, whose cardinalate was longer than that of any other man alive in 1492, was, indeed, a good candidate. Though Spanish by birth and education, he had transcended his background in the process of becoming the foremost papal administrator of his time. True, he maintained Spanish customs in his household as well as on public occasions, as his sponsorship of Rome's first bullfight testifies, and Spanish was the language he spoke with his family and familiars. Yet he stood fast with several of the more recent popes in defending the States of the Church against the depredations of Ferrante of Naples, a cadet scion of the house of Aragon, which demonstrated that he was no slavish adherent of the ruler of his native land. He also was a wealthy pluralist whose morals had been criticized, yet his very riches testified to his skill as both administrator and diplomat. He held benefices of some sort in virtually every area of the Christian West, even during times when the secular rulers of many of those areas had policies antithetical to those espoused in Rome. This, alone, is a comment on his diplomatic abilities. Much of Borgia's success came from his determination to work towards a goal with crushing perseverance, using whatever information came his way to serve his ends, without being dismayed by momentary setbacks in the progress of his plans. He was able, for example, to obtain appanages, both Spanish and Italian, for his elder sons, Pedro Luis and Giovanni, and ecclesiastical preferment for his third, Cesare, in spite of the fact that most of his contemporaries did not look favorably on the bastards of churchmen. Pope Innocent VIII had scandalized Rome by keeping his children near him and recognizing them, yet no such public stigma seems to have been directed against the cardinal-vicechancellor for similar actions, at least during the cardinalitial years and the first stages of the papal reign. Borgia also was possessed of that pre-eminent skill always found in those who make a success of high public office. He chose men of ability and loyalty to serve him and delegated authority appropriately. This is clear from the success of those members of his cardinalitial staff whom he elevated to the College once he was pope. Altogether, intelligence and experience seemed to mark Borgia as the appropriate candidate to achieve success in the conclave of 1492.\n\nIV. The Cardinal Nephews of Pius II and Paul II.\n\nRodrigo de Lançol y Borgia was by no means the only cardinal of great seniority who could be considered papabile, in 1492, however. The only surviving creation of Pius II also belonged to that group of prelates who could hope to achieve the throne. The antecedents of Francesco di Nanni Todeschini de' Piccolomini were in many ways similar to Borgia's. He was born on May 9, 1439, the second son of Laudomia, sister of the future Pius II. (55) Upon completing his education at the University of Perugia, he entered the ecclesiastical life and was made a protonotary apostolic as an honor to his uncle, then a cardinal. After the election of Pius, favors and distinctions began to come to Francesco as they had to Rodrigo in the earlier reign. On February 6, 1460, he was made archbishop of Siena, his birthplace and the birthplace of the pontiff, and, on the following March 5, he was made a cardinal-deacon. It is probable that Francesco was not Pius II's original choice for the position of principal cardinal-nephew. Another Piccolomini, Antonio, was made ordinary of Siena when it was still of episcopal rank and became its first archbishop on April 23, 1459. Antonio, however, died November 8, 1459, and Francesco was appointed his successor. (56) Pius wasted no time in introducing his nephew into the complexities of Church diplomacy and administration, sending him as legate to Piceno in April, 1460. When the pope decided to supervise personally the preparations for a planned crusade and left Rome for Ancona in June, 1464, he left Francesco in Rome as governor and legate to the States of the Church. (57) When Pius died at Ancona, August 15, 1464, (58) the period of the greatest influence of Francesci di Nanni Todeschini de' Piccolomini came to an end. The youthful cardinal-deacon participated in the conclave of 1464 and then virtually disappeared for a time from public view. He is next heard of escorting the Emperor Frederick III to the gates of Rome on Christmas Eve, 1468. (59) Francesco, as a member of his uncle's household, had early acquired a knowledge of, and affection for, things German. In consequence, when Paul II (1464-1471) looked about him for someone to represent the papacy at the Diet of Ratisbon in 1471, he chose Francesco. (60) Because of his absence in Germany, Piccolomini did not attend the conclave of 1471 which elected Sixtus IV.\n\nAs cardinals more senior to him began to die or were promoted to higher positions in the College, Francesco began to acquire more influence and offices in the College. On August 30, 1471, Borgia was advanced to the suburbicarian diocese of Albano from the position of archdeacon of the College. Piccolomini, as the next senior cardinal-deacon, became archdeacon in turn. (61) While occupying this last office, he participated in the conclave of 1484 and both announced the election of, and crowned, Innocent VIII. His public activities during the reign of Innocent, however, were restricted to the administration of the diocese of Fermo, which he was given in 1485, and to a short legatine commission at Perugia. (62)\n\nDuring his cardinalitial years, Piccolomini received many benefices which made his income comfortable, yet he was not especially wealthy by the standards of the cardinals in his time. He had a passion for order and discipline in his personal life and led a quiet existence without attracting public attention. His retiring nature is partially accounted for by the fact that, like his uncle, Pius II, he was tormented by gout. His kindliness was proverbial, and from a distance Piccolomini seemed to possess the qualities which would rank him high among the papabili, but this was not the case. His experience, intelligence, and education were scarcely inferior to Borgia's, yet his poor health, more than anything else, militated against his election. After all, the cardinals were quite aware that the welfare of the Church had suffered during the eight years of the sickly Innocent VIII and they were not disposed to see another invalid elevated. In spite of the condition of his health, however, many religious zealots would have been delighted to see the elevation of Piccolomini in 1492, as they later would be in 1503. While in 1503 the political circumstances made the choice of a compromise pope a necessity, in 1492 the international diplomatic situation made the rise of a mild or overly conciliatory pontiff very dangerous. Astute diplomats and bureaucrats of the type of Borgia, Giuliano della Rovere, and Oliviero Caraffa, must have thought, as the name of Francesco di Nanni Todeschini de' Piccolomini occurred to them, that it was both a political and administrative liability to be too Christian.\n\nWithin the scope of Piccolomini's papabilit (ability to be elected pope), also, was the possibility that his known partiality for the Empire might place him in the position of actively welcoming German interference in the affairs of the Italian peninsula should the Neapolitan question reach unmanageable proportions. Because the Church had zealously worked through the reigns of twenty popes for the express purpose of excluding the German emperor from such a rôle, the possibility that Piccolomini would undo this accomplishment was too real to be ignored. Since his uncle, Pius II, had been the eldest of at least eighteen children, Piccolomini had a large retinue of relatives-more than a hundred cousins-who might, by this time rather legitimately, expect to receive preferential treatment at his hands if he were elected. The cardinals were acutely aware that to provide for such a substantial host would indeed prove a drain upon the Apostolic fisc. When he was elected in 1503, the brevity of his reign left no time for the patronage of his relatives. (63)\n\nSince the most difficult problem facing the papacy in the closing years of the fifteenth century was the stance to be taken vis-a-vis the claims of Charles VIII of France to the crown of Naples, the opportunities open to the cardinal who was native to that city would, at first glance, seem considerable. Oliviero Caraffa was the most senior surviving creation of Paul II, having been made a cardinal on September 18, 1467. At the time of his elevation he had already been archbishop of his native city for nine years. (64) In 1471, the newly-elected Sixtus IV appointed Caraffa legate to Ferrante of Naples as well as commander of the pontifical flotilla then fitting out to carry the war at sea to the Turks. (65) As fleet commander, Caraffa developed a reputation as a military chief which he would hold for the rest of his life. Indeed, this reputation was one of his principal assets as the negotiation for a successor to Innocent VIII began, but his closeness to Ferrante of Naples prevented his ever being seriously considered by the cardinals in 1484; and he was never advanced as a candidate. (66) Partly as a reward for his successful campaign against the Turks and partly because of his seniority in the College he was advanced to the rank of cardinal-bishop of Albano on July 24, 1476. (67) This promotion placed the Neapolitan prelate even higher in the state councils of the reign of Sixtus IV, as did his term as camerlengo of the College for the year 1477-as the successor of Giacomo Ammanati-Piccolomini; he served from January 15, 1477, to January 9, 1478; and was succeeded by Marco Barbo. (68) After his participation in the conclave of 1484, Caraffa resigned the archdiocese of Naples in favor of his brother, Alessandro, and from that time forward he had no official standing within his native realm-although, on November 16, 1491, he was made administrator of the diocese of Salamanca, which he retained until June, 1494. (69) At the time of the conclave of 1492, in spite of a recent dispute with his former Neapolitan master, Ferrante, Caraffa was a firm defender of that kingdom's interests in the selection of a new pope. Perhaps this came about because he was administrator of Salamanca and this, in turn, obligated him to Ferdinand of Aragon, Ferrante's cousin. (70)\n\nCaraffa's position as sub-dean of the College gave him considerable importance in governmental matters during the sede vacante, and the cardinals might well have considered Caraffa for the tiara but for the fact that he had obtained the cardinalate at the instigation of Ferrante in more friendly years and seemed now to be a representative of the interests of Ferdinand of Aragon. Perhaps, if Caraffa were elected, Ferrante might gain a foothold in the States of the Church during the tenure of a pope who had once been his subject. This fear alone ruled Caraffa out of any serious consideration. Moreover, Caraffa was extremely partial to his family and actively sought preferment for them at every opportunity. Were he pope, Rome would almost certainly witness an onslaught by hordes of relatives and a corresponding diminution in the influence of the current cardinals and the members of their staffs. The peers of Caraffa would not have forgotten the troubles which grew from the elevation of the last Neapolitan pontiff, Urban VI. (71)\n\nBesides Caraffa, two other cardinals created by Paul II survived, Giovanni Battista Zeno, the son of Paul's sister, Isabella, (72) and Giovanni Michiel, another nephew of the pontiff. (73) Of the two, Zeno was perhaps the more papabile. Many perhaps would have favored him except that his mild disposition did not seem appropriate in a time when the pope was expected to take a leading, if not a dominating, part in the affairs of the Italian peninsula. Also, he was a subject of the Venetian Republic, as was his cousin, Michiel, and still held the ordinariate of Vicenza, a subject city of Venice. (74) Michiel, on the other hand, was a prelate who enjoyed to the fullest the pleasures of living and, moreover, was in such good health that a long reign of parties and entertainments could be expected were he to be elevated, which hardly sorted well with the growing European diplomatic unpleasantness over Naples which demanded a pope who would devote a great deal of his reign to serious business. Beyond these considerations, however, lay the overriding fact that Venice, the native land of these two prelates, had been none too friendly toward the papacy in recent years and often took an independent stand whenever it suited her, risking ecclesiastical censure with impunity. The suave Paul II had dealt successfully with his former masters, (75) but this could be considered a fortuity, and casting the die a second time with hopes of the same number was not a chance the cardinals were prepared to take.\n\nV. Giuliano Della Rovere - Borgia's Chief Rival.\n\nBy far Borgia's most formidable opponent was Giuliano della Rovere, the nephew and senior surviving creation of Sixtus IV. Giuliano was born at Albescola (Albizzola), near Savona, on December 5, 1443, the son of Raffaele della Rovere, brother of the future Sixtus IV. The young Giuliano studied at Perugia under the care of the Franciscans and, in 1469, was made a protonotary apostolic, in deference to his uncle, who was then a cardinal. (76) After the election of Sixtus in 1471, honors quickly flowed to Giuliano, as they had in former reigns come to Rodrigo de Lançol y Borgia and to Francesco di Nanni Todeschini de' Piccolomini. Sixtus was elected on August 9, 1471, and on the following October 16 Giuliano was made bishop of Carpentras. (77) This promotion opened a lifelong connection between the north Italian prelate and the French, which, during almost all his cardinalitial years, was a most cordial one. On December 16, 1471, Giuliano was created a cardinal-priest and six days later his name was published and he was given the red hat together with the title of San Pietro in Vincoli. (78) It was about this time that Giuliano assumed the rôle of patron of the arts for which, as cardinal and later as Pope Julius II, posterity chiefly remembers him. He took up residence in a palace, adjacent to his title church, which he had decorated by Giuliano da Sangallo. (79) Early in 1472, Giuliano exchanged the see of Carpentras for that of Lausanne, though no new bishop was appointed for his first diocese, so that he seems to have enjoyed the revenues of both sees. Giuliano took possession of his new diocese on February 25, 1472. In the following January, Giuliano also was made administrator of the diocese of Catania but he resigned this charge in the following year. (80)\n\nEarly in the reign of Sixtus, Melozzo da Forli executed the famous fresco of \"Sixtus IV and His Court Appointing Platina Librarian of the Vatican.\" In this work we have a full length portrait of Giuliano, wearing a purple cape lined with ermine. His serious, almost grim, appearance contrasts sharply with the bland expressions of the other members of the della Rovere family portrayed, namely Sixtus IV, Cardinals Pietro Riario and Domenico della Rovere, and the prefect of Rome, Giovanni della Rovere. Giuliano's appearance coincides well with the description of his character given by Pastor. (81)\n\nAfter the death of the incumbent in March, 1473, Giuliano was appointed administrator of the diocese of Messina, while keeping his other ordinariates, but he resigned this charge in May of the following year in favor of an annual pension from the revenues of this see. (82) During the period in which he held Messina, he functioned as a member of the hierarchy of the kingdom of Naples when he acted as escort to Leonora d'Aragona, daughter of Ferrante, as she passed through Rome on her way to be married to Ercole d'Este of Ferrara. This was the first occasion, as far as can be ascertained, on which Giuliano came to meet a member of that royal family with which he would be in combat for many of the remaining years of his cardinalate. (83)\n\nAfter Sixtus' favorite cardinal-nephew, Pietro Riario, died in January, 1474, Giuliano acquired much of the property of the deceased cardinal and began to conduct more and more of the papal affairs in which, up to that time, Riario had been paramount. (84) From this time forward, Giuliano assumed a role in the government of the Church second only to that played by Rodrigo de Lançol y Borgia. During the remaining years of his uncle's pontificate, Giuliano's sway was well nigh absolute, and the reign of Innocent VIII saw but little diminution of his influence. During the course of his reign, Sixtus had bestowed such a plentitude of benefices on Giuliano that to list them alone would take pages. In one year alone, December, 1472-December, 1473, Giuliano received the abbey of Grottaferrata, the monastery of San Savino near Pisa, the Benedictine house of Saint Pierre de Luxeuil in the diocese of Besançon, the Benedictine monastery of Santa Sofia at Benevento, and the monastery of Saint Symphorien at Metz. (85)\n\nGiuliano's first major administrative appointment had been given to him only a few weeks before the death of his cousin Riario, on November 3, 1473, when he was made legate to the Marches. In June of the following year, acting as chief of the pontifical household, he led the pontifical army to quell an uprising in the city of Todi. After the reduction of that city, he turned his attention to Spoleto, which had revolted against Sixtus with the assistance of members of the Orsini family. Spoleto was completely overwhelmed. Città di Castello was next on the list. When its tyrant, Niccolo Vitelli, refused with scorn all offers of clemency from Sixtus, Giuliano besieged the city. In spite of aid sent by both Florence and Milan, Città di Castello eventually capitulated and Vitelli was brought to Rome in Giuliano's train. At about the time of his return, Giuliano went to live in the palace built for Cardinal Joannes Bessarion near the title church of Santi Dodici Apostoli, which he had received in commendam. (86) This expedition marks the emergence of Giuliano as a military leader of consequence and established for the cardinal a lifelong reputation for decisive military success. In consequence, Giuliano also increased his standing at his uncle's court.\n\nEarly in 1476, Giuliano was named legate to France and to Avignon. (87) Giuliano was already bishop of Avignon, having been elevated to that position on May 23, 1474, after it had been resigned by Cardinal Alain de Coëtivy, shortly before the latter's death. (88) On November 20, 1475, Sixtus raised Avignon to an archdiocese, with Giuliano as first archbishop. (89) The combined legatine commission that Sixtus gave to his nephew enabled him to transact business with Louis XI at the same time that he regulated affairs in his archdiocese. During his stay in France, Giuliano was quite successful in the tasks he undertook and won the friendship of king and court, particularly after the red hat was bestowed on Charles de Bourbon at the express wish of Louis. (90) The good relations thus established with the French were to last well into the pontificate of Alexander VI; and during the conclave of 1492, Giuliano was the official French candidate for the tiara.\n\nDuring the course of his residence in France, Giuliano received additional benefices in that country and exchanged several others with French prelates, thus strengthening his ties with the Gallic Church-on July 15, 1476, Giuliano exchanged the diocese of Lausanne for that of Coutances, and later in the same year he was made administrator of the diocese of Viviers. In the summer of 1478 Giuliano became administrator of the see of Mende and Viviers was given to another. (91)\n\nIn October, 1476, Giuliano returned to the papal court to give an account of his legation. The court, then at Foligno, attended a public consistory on the occasion of Giuliano's reception by his uncle. (92) The cardinal-nephew returned to Rome with Sixtus later that month and was soon given the office of penitentiary major, vacated by the death of Cardinal Filippo Calandrini in the preceding July. (93) In August, 1477, Giuliano was also made archpriest of Saint John Lateran. (94) The acquisition of these two offices served to increase his power in the curia. The first gave him jurisdiction over all penitential matters everywhere in western Christendom, while the latter advanced him in precedence at court.\n\nThe measure of his importance at this time is revealed by the fact that, on January 8, 1479, he was elected to an annual term as camerlengo of the College. This office placed in his hands the management of all the revenues due to all the cardinals. During his term as camerlengo, Giuliano was further advanced by his uncle by being made cardinal-bishop of Sabina in April of the same year. (95)\n\nWhen his term as chamberlain expired in April, 1480, Giuliano was once more named legate to France, to which, on this occasion, Burgundy was added. (96) His purpose on this mission was threefold. He was to try to make peace between Louis XI and the future Emperor Maximilian; to obtain the release from imprisonment of Cardinal Jean Balue; and to secure French aid for a projected crusade against the Turks. In the latter two of these efforts he was successful and, in the process, greatly increased the fondness of the French for him. His pleasure at residing in France was evident because he chose to remain at Avignon until August, 1481. (97) When he returned to Rome in the following February, he went to reside with his uncle at the Vatican, doubtless because of the increasing infirmities of Sixtus as his reign drew to a close. (98)\n\nOn January 31, 1483, Giuliano was advanced to the highest ecclesiastical office he would hold before his election to the papal chair in 1503. He was made cardinal-bishop of Ostia e Velletri, in succession to the dean of the College, Guillaume d'Estouteville, who had died on January 22. (99) In addition, on the following November 3, the cardinal's revenues and responsibilities were materially increased when he was made bishop of Bologna. (100)\n\nHis activities during the pontificate of his uncle close with his nomination by Sixtus to say the jubilee Mass for the twelfth anniversary of his uncle's coronation as pope. (101) This Mass, chanted on August 23, 1483, was the first service to be held in the newly opened Sistine Chapel and marks Giuliano's first association with that room with which he is intimately connected for the rest of his life-the connection for which posterity best recalls the memory of Julius II.\n\nAfter the death of Sixtus, Giuliano entered the conclave of 1484 with little of the power over the cardinalitial creations of his uncle that cardinal-nephews usually enjoyed. Yet his diplomatic skill enabled him to bring about the election of his candidate, Giovanni Battista Cibo, who became Innocent VIII. (102) In consequence of this effort, Giuliano retained for the whole reign an influence scarcely less than that which he had during the time of Sixtus IV. (103) For example, directly after the elevation of Innocent, Giuliano served an interim term as camerlengo of the College until a successor could be found for Cibo himself. (104)\n\nAt the end of November, 1485, Giuliano once more demonstrated his talents for managing a crisis. When the troops of Alfonso of Calabria invested Rome, he saw to the fortification of the city personally, and bolstered the courage of the inhabitants by publicly making the rounds of the gates and walls in the company of Cardinals Giovanni Colonna and Giovanni Battista Savelli on even the coldest December nights. (105) For the next year, during the war with Ferrante of Naples, it was Giuliano, rather than Innocent, who directed the papal government. This was attributable, in part, to the ill health of the pontiff and to the fact that Innocent had as yet, no cardinal-nephew into whose hands he could entrust affairs. (106) Giuliano's activities during this time show a determined administrator, military commander and diplomat functioning at the peak of his powers. In March, 1486, Giuliano went to Ostia, where he began the fortification of the citadel. He then went directly to Genoa to arm a flotilla which was nominally being readied for use in the crusade against the Turks but was, in fact, to be employed against Ferrante. (107) A year later, Giuliano was back in Rome and was named legate to the March of Ancona and Venice. (108) Under his superintendence, but with Milanese aid and without his presence, the city of Osimo, then in revolt, was subdued. (109) On July 19, 1487, Giuliano, disappointed with the progress of the siege of Osimo, requested permission to return to Rome. After a few days there, he departed once again, this time for his episcopal seat at Bologna, where he stayed only briefly. By April of the following year, he was once more at Ostia. (110) During the rest of the reign of Innocent, Giuliano led a less hectic life while negotiations for peace with the Neapolitan king continued. (111)\n\nAs Innocent's life drew to a close and preparations began to choose his successor, Giuliano emerged as the chief rival of Borgia for the throne. The two cardinals were not recent rivals; indeed their quarrel was already decades old in 1492. The origins of this feud are not known, but in any case they hated each other with intensity. (112)\n\nGiuliano went into the conclave of 1492 as the official candidate of both France and Genoa. But his time had not yet arrived. France's candidates for the papal throne had not fared well in earlier elections of the fifteenth century; and the current king, Charles VIII, was a vacillating and weak young man who did not please the Italian cardinals with his warlike posture in his claims to the kingdom of Naples. Those prelates were more concerned with the preservation of those territories and incomes gathered over years of patient diplomatic endeavor than with encouraging, through the election of Giuliano, a youthful, untried monarch who might well sweep all of their hard-earned fortunes away if given the chance. Giuliano was not yet known as the figure who would, indeed, protect and defend the States of the Church against all comers regardless of former loyalties. The future Julius II could not be discerned in the cardinal in 1492. Moreover, Giuliano and his adherents must surely have known that their prospects for success at this time were remote, for Borgia and his party would exercise themselves to the utmost to prevent his triumph. Perhaps the best result for which Giuliano could hope was to thwart the ambitions of Borgia and secure the elevation of a nonentity of the stamp of Innocent VIII, who would be content to follow the advice of the cardinal-bishop of Ostia. To this last end, Giuliano bent his whole will and skill. Yet this limited ambition, too, was something which caused many to view with suspicion any candidate he put forward. For any of those doubts which applied to Giuliano himself applied to any pontiff he might dominate. Giuliano, moreover, was not blessed with one of the age's more attractive personalities. Borgia could woo smilingly the vacillating to his side by courtesy and public regard; he had done so in the past. (113) But Giuliano rightfully was regarded everywhere as a man of strong passions who was friendly enough to those who agreed with him and were intimate in his household, but bitterly, often frighteningly, insulting and dangerous to those who opposed him. In this regard, he shared the personality of his uncle, Sixtus IV. That pontiff came to be hated by virtually all the cardinals once he had tasted the fruits of papal power. (114) If the mild Francesco d'Albescola della Rovere could abandon the demeanor of Saint Francis to assume the character of a tyrant-pope, what might happen if a cardinal of that same blood, already reputed to be willful and domineering, should also achieve the papal throne? The memories of the Pazzi conspiracy and other examples of Sistine statecraft were too fresh in the minds of the cardinals who represented the major Italian princely families-Sforza, Medici, Caraffa-to have them risk a repetition. (115)\n\nVI. The Other Creations of Sixtus IV.\n\nThe cardinal-bishop next junior to Giuliano, and the only other Iberian, besides Borgia, then in Rome to take part in the election was Giorgio da Costa. He certainly was not going to be the next pope, for his eighty-six years barred him from this high office. Yet he remained active in every way and was one of the most experienced of the political cardinals of the fifteenth century. He owed his rise to greatness to a chance encounter with the Portuguese royal family after which he was appointed to a number of important missions in the Portuguese diplomatic service. (116) His advance, both ecclesiastical and political, was steady after he proved his worth to Afonso V. (117) On December 18, 1476, he was made a cardinal; he already was archbishop of Lisbon and first minister of state. (118) Near the end of Afonso's life, da Costa began to fear that he would be stripped of his power and position once the crown prince, Joao succeeded, so he prepared to leave his homeland, and arrived in Rome in the spring of 1480. (119) There, at the age of seventy-four, he began a new career. Both Sixtus IV and Innocent VIII confided several difficult missions to the Portuguese, (120) who was advanced to the rank of cardinal-bishop on October 10, 1491, as a suitable reward. (121)\n\nAt the time of the death of Innocent, da Costa had lost none of the astuteness by which he had risen to be first minister of Portugal. Indeed, he behaved in every way like a man twenty years younger. His vigor and alertness served him until the day of his death at the age of one hundred two.(122) In spite of this obvious vigor, da Costa was never in serious consideration for the tiara. No man in the ninth decade of life had been elevated to the papal throne in centuries-the oldest pope elected in recent history, Calixtus III, had been seventy-six at the moment of his pontifical elevation. (123) Even had da Costa been twenty years younger, however, his longstanding strained relationship with King Joao II of Portugal would have made his successful candidacy extremely doubtful.\n\nThe senior cardinal-priest in Rome during the summer of 1492 was the next most senior surviving creation of Sixtus IV after Giorgio da Costa. Girolamo Basso della Rovere, another cardinal-nephew of Sixtus, was the son of the pope's sister, Luchina, and of Giovanni Guglielmo Basso. Girolamo, like his cousin, Giuliano, was born at Albescola near Savona. His age is uncertain but when he was made bishop of Albenga in 1472, he was still a minor. In 1476, Girolamo was advanced to the wealthier see of Recanati. (124) Sixtus first broached the matter of Girolamo's creation to the College on March 24, 1477. During much of the following summer, Sixtus pressed the College to consent to his elevation, and four others, to the cardinalate. This papal discussion with the cardinals is the subject of a letter of Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, dated March 24, 1477, where the Mantuan prelate informed his father, the Marchese Luigi III, that among the pope's relatives was \"lo vescovo di Recanati nepote d. S. Sta. ex sorore.\"\n\nGirolamo's formal creation finally took place on December 10, 1477. The publication of Girolamo's name together with his assignment to the title of Santa Balbina, which had just been vacated by Giovanni Battista Cibo, occurred two days later.(125)\n\nGirolamo arrived in Rome on February 21, 1478, and on the following day Sixtus received him in a public consistory and performed the ceremony of the opening of the mouth for him. After this, Girolamo took up his duties as a member of the papal household. (126) In the following years, he was content to live quietly in Rome without attempting to impress himself on pontifical government. He did, however, win the enmity of the powerful Colonna and Savelli families thanks to his role during and following the consistory of June 2, 1482. At this time representatives of the Orsini family publicly accused Cardinals Giovanni Colonna and Giovanni Battista Savelli of treason. Sixtus ordered their arrest and Giovanni Colonna was given over to the charge of Girolamo to be kept in confinement in the latter's apartments in the Vatican. Girolamo was released from this duty on the following day when both the accused cardinals were transferred to Castel Sant'Angelo, after the partisans of their families created such an uproar in the city that their presence in the Vatican became a danger to the pope's person. We can be sure, however, that the Colonna cardinal, in particular, never forgot the humiliating fact that Girolamo Basso della Rovere had once been his jailer. On the following September 23, Girolamo was made administrator of the diocese of Gubbio, which he retained until January 9, 1492. (127)\n\nGirolamo was by nature somewhat meek and was fully content to allow the care of his interests, and those of his family, to remain in the hands of his much more forceful cousin, Giuliano. Girolamo's major role during the conclave of 1492 was to act as the archpriest of the College during the absence of Cardinals Luis Juan del Mila y Borgia and Pedro Gonsalvez de Mendoza, who were both senior to him in rank. (128) No one considered that Girolamo would make a suitable pope. Any attempt to elevate him would have been seen by Borgia's partisans as a ploy to maintain the power and influence of Giuliano della Rovere; so, in consequence, the Borgian party would have spared no efforts to ensure Girolamo's defeat.\n\nAnother member of the della Rovere family who was created a cardinal on the same occasion as Girolamo Basso della Rovere was Raffaele Sansoni Riario. He was born at Savona, May 3, 1461, the son of Antonio Sansoni and Violante, sister of Cardinal Pietro Riario and daughter of Bianca della Rovere, sister of Sixtus IV. Raffaele's creation as cardinal followed the completion of his studies at the University of Pisa when he was only sixteen years old. When his name was published on December 12, 1477, he was given the rank of cardinal-deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro. (129)\n\nDuring the early months of his cardinalate, Riario continued to reside at Pisa, but fled the city in the spring of 1478, because of an outbreak of the plague. He went to Florence, where he was present when the Pazzi carried out their attempt on the lives of Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici. (130) The young cardinal was wrongly suspected of complicity in the plot, and he was arrested and imprisoned. The reasons for this suspicion are to be found in the deteriorating relationship between the papacy and the Medici at this time. Riario's greatuncle, Sixtus IV, demanded his release on May 24 in a letter conveyed into Florence by Giacomo Vannuci, bishop of Perugia. The young cardinal was not immediately set at liberty, and a week later Sixtus excommunicated Lorenzo de' Medici. As the dispute became more heated, the Florentines made the gesture of releasing Riario in the hope that this would serve to cool the situation. Raffaele arrived in Siena, June 13, 1478, \"plus mort que vif.\" (131) One week later he was in Rome and on June 22 he was received by Sixtus in a public consistory at which time the ceremony of the opening of the mouth was performed for him. Four days later he left Rome for Perugia as legate, and thus began his active ecclesiastical career. (132) In May, 1480, he became a cardinal-priest. (133) On January 24, 1483, Sixtus IV presented to his great-nephew the single most valuable office which became vacant during the course of his reign, that of camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, which had been under the care of the dean of the College, Guillaume d'Estouteville, until his death on January 22. (134)\n\nAt about the time of this appointment Riario began to display signs of considerable political talent as well as some determination to shape the course of his own life. In late spring, 1484, there occurred another outbreak of the centuries-long feud between the Colonna and Orsini families which, in this case, involved the protonotary apostolic, Lorenzo Oddone, whom Sixtus ordered arrested. This man, a protege of the Colonna, was also a good friend of Riario, who risked the considerable displeasure of Sixtus by interceding on behalf of the hapless papal courtier. All this was to no avail, however, for Oddone was beheaded on June 30. (135) But the young cardinal was willing to risk all of the preferments he had received by defending his friend before an enraged Sixtus IV. It would seem, however, that Riario did not lose any of the regard in which he was held by the pontiff as a result of his action. (136)\n\nRiario's political acumen was demonstrated for the first time in 1488. On April 14 of that year Girolamo Riario, Lord of Forli and Imola, and uncle of the cardinal, was murdered, and insurrection broke out at once. Raffaele Riario was sent to Forli as legate by Innocent VIII with a mandate to quell the popular uprising. His first efforts seemed to promise success, yet he was thwarted, in the end, largely because of Milanese intervention on behalf of Girolamo's widow, Caterina Sforza. Riario returned to Rome from this charge in October, 1488, (137) and from that time forward we do not hear of him participating in the government of the Church under Innocent VIII.\n\nThe importance of Raffaele Riario during the vacancy of the papal throne in 1492 is not mentioned anywhere, but as chamberlain of the Church he was in charge of the whole of the ecclesiastical government during the sede vacante. The fact that the transition of government from the weak Innocent VIII to the strong Alexander VI was as smooth as it was is, in part, because Riario acquitted himself of his responsibilities well. Riario conducted business largely by careful negotiation rather than by force of personal action. (138) His course of life in this regard may have been impressed on him as a result of his experience during the aftermath of the Pazzi conspiracy. He was said, indeed, to have had a pale cast to his complexion all the days of his life in consequence of the terror he experienced at that time. (139) Riario's career seems always to have been haunted by encounters with the Medici in which he was humiliated. In the end, he was implicated in the attempt, in June, 1517, to murder Leo X, and only escaped with his life and dignities by the payment of a huge indemnity. (140) Thus he was brought low by the son of the man at whose side he had walked into the cathedral of Florence that fatal Sunday nearly forty years before. A broken man, Riario died in July, 1521. As his star set, that of Giuliano de' Medici, soon to be Clement VII, was rising. Giulio was the son of that Giuliano who was cut down while Raffaele Riario crouched in fear at the foot of the high altar in Florence. (141)\n\nIn the sede vacante of 1492, the sixth cardinal, and youngest cardinal-nephew, to survive from the creations of Sixtus IV, was Domenico della Rovere. Like all the Rovereschi, Domenico was assured a comfortable future when his uncle was elected pope. He was not, however, originally destined for the cardinalate. Sixtus first elevated Domenico's elder brother, Cristoforo, to the College in 1477. (142) But Cristoforo died suddenly on February 1, 1478, after only fifty-three days as cardinal, and nine days later the pope created Domenico a cardinal-priest to replace his brother in the College. (143) For a year, 1483-1484, Domenico served as legate to Savoy, and then he participated in the conclave which elected Innocent VIII. (144) In this electoral meeting, he was one of the original members of the faction of Giuliano della Rovere which brought about the election of Innocent. Like the other members of the family, Domenico spent the years of Innocent's pontificate away from the affairs of ecclesiastical government, content to leave his interests in the hands of Giuliano, whose influence with the pontiff was nearly paramount. Today, as in his own time, Domenico has the reputation of a lavish patron of the arts, particularly architecture. Among the buildings erected under his ægis were his palace in the Piazza Scossacavalli, now the hospital of Santo Spirito near the Colonnade of Saint Peter's, a villa near Ponte Molle, and a chapel, now called the Capella Venuti, which was decorated by Pinturicchio with an Adoration of the Infant Christ and lunettes depicting scenes from the life of Saint Jerome. In this chapel, Domenico was entombed. (145)\n\nThe adjective which best describes this cardinal is colorless. Perhaps no description is a better exemplification than his portrait by Melozzo da Forli discussed above. In every way Domenico was guided by the wishes of his cousin, Giuliano, save only for his actions in the conclave of 1492, as will be seen.\n\nFour of the remaining living cardinals created by Sixtus IV, Giovanni Colonna, Giovanni Battista Savelli, Giovanni Conti, and Giovanni Battista Orsini, all belonged to old established Roman noble families, each of whom had given the Church dozens of cardinals and not merely one pontiff. Their creation was effected by Sixtus IV simply to ensure the relative peace of the Roman vicinity during his reign, and to give these great Roman princely families some voice in the conduct of papal government during his time. Of these four, the one who had the greatest effect on the public affairs his time was Giovanni Colonna.\n\nColonna was born in 1456, the son of Antonio Colonna, Prince of Salerno; a nephew of Cardinal Prospero Colonna, and a great-nephew of Martin V. Three of Giovanni's brothers, Fabrizio, Girolamo, and Prospero, all became celebrated captains of the fifteenth century.\n\nIn view of their origins, it is not surprising that at least one of these four brothers would be destined for an ecclesiastical career, and the family choice fell on Giovanni, for reasons which will almost certainly never be known. After having been made a protonotary apostolic and abbot, in commendam, of Grottaferrata, Giovanni was created a cardinal-deacon on May 15, 1480, and, a few days later, was assigned the deaconate of Santa Maria in Aquiro. On June 3, he was given the red hat in a ceremony in Saint Peter's; and six days later the rite of the opening of the mouth was performed for him. (146) Because the number of benefices he had received up to that time was not large, he was shortly afterwards appointed administrator of the diocese of Rieti. (147) Colonna's willingness to take an independent course was first indicated in the quarrel between Sixtus IV and Ferrante of Naples, in which the cardinal sided with the Neapolitan, largely because the Orsini remained devoted adherents of the papal cause. The enmity between the Colonna and the Orsini was centuries old, and the mere fact that Sixtus had elevated Giovanni to the College did not in any way lessen Giovanni's dedication to his family's part in the quarrel, even if this meant opposing the pontiff responsible for his advancement. In this atmosphere of strained relations, matters were not improved when Girolamo Colonna, the cardinal's brother, was murdered in April, 1482, at the instigation of members of the Santacroce family. (148) Though Sixtus acted against the perpetrators of the crime, the Colonna remained dissatisfied with papal conduct during the whole affair. Matters came to a climax on June 2, 1482, when members of the Orsini clan openly denounced Cardinals Giovanni Colonna and Giovanni Battista Savelli for treason in a public consistory. In consequence, Colonna was arrested. He finally was released on November 15, 1483, and took part in a consistory held that day in which five new cardinals were named, including Giovanni Battista Orsini. (149) The fierce struggle between the Colonna and the Orsini did not abate, however, and when Giovanni gave sanctuary to Lorenzo Oddone in his palace in the Piazza della Pilotta, the pope was exasperated. Oddone was seized and executed on May 30, 1484, as has been related, and Giovanni Colonna fled Rome. (150) The incidents are worth noting in detail, for they reveal that Giovanni Colonna was no friend of the Rovereschi. During the conclave of 1492, Colonna was one of the cardinals who actively supported the candidacy of Rodrigo de Lançol y Borgia for the papacy. He did so, perhaps, for the sole reason that he was thus striking back at the chief member of that family which had once injured him so much, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere.\n\nAfter the death of Sixtus IV in August, 1484, Colonna returned to Rome amidst the acclamations of its citizens, and participated in the ensuing conclave. At that time, he supported the cause of Borgia, which failed. (151) During the course of the reign of Innocent VIII, Colonna was very much out of the mainstream of papal affairs, simply because Giuliano della Rovere had so much to do with them. Giovanni Colonna played a major rôle only once, during the disorders of 1485, when he joined his old friend, Giovanni Battista Savelli, and his old enemy, Giuliano della Rovere, in attempting to maintain order in the troubled Eternal City.\n\nGiovanni Battista Savelli came of a background which differed little from that of his friend Giovanni Colonna, save that the Savelli cardinal was thirty-five years older. His early years are clouded in obscurity, except for the fact that he was a protonotary apostolic and participated in a number of legations. (152) In 1468, he was, for a time, Governor of Bologna. In May or June, 1471, he was secretly created a cardinal by Paul II, but his name was not published on the occasion of Paul's death in the following July, as the pontiff had mandated. Because of the influence of Cardinal Latino Orsini, Savelli and the other secretly created cardinals were excluded from the conclave which elected Sixtus IV. (153) After the election of Sixtus, Savelli was dispatched to Perugia as legate. On May 15, 1480, he was again named a cardinal and, afterward, the rank of cardinal-deacon of Santi Vito e Modesto was assigned to him. On the following June 3, Savelli was given the red hat in a ceremony at Saint Peter's; and six days later the ceremony of the opening of the mouth was performed. (154) Immediately afterward, Savelli resumed his diplomatic career and returned as legate to Perugia (155) until, in December, 1480, he was sent to Genoa to try to assist in establishing peace between the warring factions of Fregoso and Adorno, that is to say between the French and Milanese parties then struggling for control of the city. In Genoa, the cardinal inspected the fleet which Cardinal Paolo Fregoso was fitting out for an expedition against the Turks. Savelli returned to Rome with Fregoso and both were present on June 30, 1481, at San Paolo fuori le Mura, when Sixtus blessed the standard that was to be borne by the papal flotilla. In this same public consistory, Savelli gave a report of the results of his mission to Genoa. (156)\n\nOn May 18, 1482, having once more returned to Rome, Savelli was embroiled in the outbreak of hostilities between the Colonna and the Orsini. Like his friend, Cardinal Giovanni Colonna, Savelli was denounced for treason in the public consistory of June 2. And, like Colonna, Savelli was arrested and imprisoned on orders from Sixtus IV. He was released on November 15, 1480, in order to take part in a new creation of cardinals among whom was Giovanni Battista Orsini. (157) After the elevation of Innocent VIII, Savelli was appointed legate to Bologna and, on September 22, 1484, he was given the fief of Monticelli. (158)\n\nThe possibility that either Colonna or Savelli would achieve the throne was very remote. Savelli almost always, it would seem, subordinated his interests to those of Colonna, in part because of the long standing alliance between the families of these two prelates. Both were at odds with Giuliano della Rovere during most of their careers before the reign of Alexander VI, and Giuliano was ready to thwart any ambitions either Colonna or Savelli might have had for the papacy, even if the candidacy of one of them were put forward by partisans of Borgia as a possible compromise.\n\nOther forces were at work, as well, to, prevent the elevation of either. Both came of ancient and distinguished Roman noble families which had, in this time as in former centuries, wielded considerable power in the Eternal City. All that had kept the Colonna or the Savelli from paramountcy at various times in Roman history had been the concerted opposition of other, equally powerful, families, such as the Orsini, who were also represented in the College in 1492. The traditional enemies of the Colonna had tolerated the elevation of Martin V in 1417 only because he seemed, as a Romano dei Romani, the ideal figure to preside over the reunification of Western Christendom. But the end of the same century was a different age. Giovanni Battista Orsini and, to a lesser extent, Giovanni Conti, would have been vehement in their opposition to the candidature of either Colonna or Savelli for dynastic reasons, just as Giuliano would have opposed either for personal reasons. Finally, there were the circumstances of age. Colonna was viewed as far too young, he was only thirty-six; while Savelli, now seventy, was slightly too old for real consideration.\n\nThe antecedents of Giovanni Conti were similar to those of the two cardinals just discussed, yet he was a man of an altogether different stamp. Upon embarking upon an ecclesiastical career, Conti was made an apostolic sub-deacon and, in 1455, Nicholas V made him archbishop of Conza. (159) On November 15, 1483, after nearly three decades in a pastoral, rather than a curial, position, he was created a cardinal-priest and was assigned the title of Santi Nereo ed Achilleo. On the following November 19, he received the red hat; and on November 26 the ceremony of the opening of the mouth was performed for him. (160)\n\nConti participated in the conclave of 1484, where he was the official candidate of the Orsini party for the throne, in spite of the fact that he was then seventy years old. Following the election of Innocent VIII, Conti resigned the only see he had ever held, Conza, in favor of his nephew, Niccolo Conti. (161) The refusal on his part to countenance episcopal pluralism made him a refreshing exception among the cardinals of his age. In 1492, though he was nearly eighty, Conti would have been an ideal choice as a compromise candidate, but his age told against him as much as the brilliant accomplishments of his family in former times were in his favor. In spite of his years, his vigor was undiminished and, although he opposed the style of luxurious living adopted by Borgia, Conti would support the latter during the conclave.\n\nGiovanni Battista Orsini was a prelate in character far more like his archenemy, Giovanni Colonna, than like his friend, Giovanni Conti. A Roman, Giovanni Battista was the son of Lorenzo Orsini, Lord of Monte Rotondo, and also a nephew of Cardinal Latino Orsini. He was chosen from among his generation for the ecclesiastical state and was made, successively, Clerk of the Apostolic Chamber, Auditor of the Rota, protonotary apostolic, Canon of Saint Peter's, and holder, in commendam, of the Benedictine monastery of San Salvatore Maggiore in the diocese of Arezzo. (162) The capstone of his advance was reached on November 15, 1483, when he was created and published cardinal-deacon of Santa Maria in Dominica. (163) He participated in the conclave of 1484, and in the following September Innocent VIII made him legate to the March of Ancona. (164)\n\nOrsini, like Colonna and Savelli, was concerned during the whole course of his career with the interests of his family; to safeguard and expand those interests, the Cardinal was willing to go to any length. During the entire reign of Innocent VIII Orsini came to the fore in the affairs of the Church only once. In January, 1486, while the conflict between his family and the pope was in full force, Giovanni Battista left his residence at Monte Rotondo and went to Rome in the hope that he might be able to negotiate a reconciliation. To this end, he surrendered Monte Rotondo into the hands of papal troops. The defection of the cardinal from the political camp of Alfonso, duke of Calabria, dampened the effectiveness of the campaign the Neapolitan army was conducting in the vicinity of Rome and caused the duke to flee his forces for sanctuary at Pitigliano when he heard of the cardinal's action. (165) In spite of all this, however, the cardinal was not able to bring about any lessening of the tension between the Orsini and the Holy See and so retired once more from Rome. (166)\n\nDuring the sede vacante of 1492, Orsini played his most important rôle when he secured the admission of Maffeo Gherardo, Patriarch of Venice, to the College with full voting rights, even though the latter had not had his name published or received the red hat. Orsini himself was not a candidate for the tiara. because of the opposition it would engender among the Colonna, Conti, and Savelli. It was always difficult to secure the throne for a scion of one of the princely families of Rome because of the enmity of the other clans, which centuries never seemed to diminish. To raise an Orsini to the papal throne was looked upon by the Colonna as the worst fate which could conceivably befall them for, they were convinced, the whole reign would be devoted to a systematic reduction of their strongholds and their power. Similar feelings, needless to say, were actuated in the Orsini at the thought of a Colonna pope. The other princely families of Rome felt much the same about the various rivals to their power in areas which they had carved out for themselves, both within the city itself and in the Campagna. The remaining three junior cardinals of Sixtus IV, Fregoso, Sclafenati, and Sforza, all belonged to princely families from northern Italy whose local dominions had been responsible for their elevation to the College. The oldest of the three, and the one who had the widest administrative experience, was Paolo Fregoso. Fregoso, or Campofregoso to give the older, fuller spelling of the name, was born into a Genoese family that played a major part in the political affairs of that city throughout the fifteenth century. Paolo embarked upon an ecclesiastical career and, after a term as protonotary apostolic, he was made archbishop of Genoa early in 1453, in succession to Giacomo Imperiale, who had died late in the preceding year. (167) During the 1440's and 1450's, several members of Paolo's house served in succession as doges of Genoa, the line ending with Paolo's brother, Pietro. (168) The latter was deposed from office in 1458, when Charles VII of France and his partisans assumed control of the city. (169) Pietro died in 1459 at which time the leadership of the Fregoso clan, and of the anti-French party in the city, devolved upon the thirty-one-year-old archbishop. On July 17, 1461, Paolo Fregoso and his friends effected a coup which drove the French from the city and placed the government in the hands, successively, of two of the archbishop's relatives. With this arrangement the citizenry of Genoa were not content, however, and Fregoso obtained permission from Pius II to assume the rôle of chief magistrate of the Republic. This he did on May 14, 1462. The archbishop-doge after only twenty-five days in office retired in favor of a relative, Ludovico Fregoso. (170) In the following January, Paolo once more became doge of his native city, but his reign was cut short in April, 1464, when Genoa passed under Milanese control in the person of Galeazzo Maria Sforza. (171) Paolo Fregoso continued to serve in his archiepiscopal office, however, and, on May 15, 1480, Sixtus IV made him a cardinal-priest and, a few days later, assigned to him the title church of Santa Anastasia. (172)\n\nSixtus elevated him to the cardinalate as an attempt to ensure Genoese participation in the projected crusade against the Turks. The pope was not disappointed in his expectations, for the new cardinal arranged to outfit and dispatch twenty-four vessels to accompany the papal fleet. As an additional reward for his success in fitting out the squadron, Fregoso was made cardinal-legate and admiral of the combined Papal-Neapolitan fleet. (173) Following the conclusion of naval operations against the Turks, Fregoso returned once more to his native city to resume his pastoral duties. On November 23, 1483, however, he emerged from political retirement once more and was proclaimed doge. (174) His last term in office came to a close in August, 1487, when Milanese troops once more drove him out. (175) After some time spent wandering about northern Italy in search of backers for an attempt to regain control of Genoa, Fregoso finally came to Rome, late in 1488, and joined the court of Innocent VIII, in whose election the cardinal had not participated because of civil duties at home. On November 15-18, 1489, Fregoso accompanied Innocent on a holiday to Ostia. (176)\n\nAt the time of the death of Innocent, Paolo Fregoso was still archbishop of Genoa in spite of his exile and was scheming to return home once more. Since the Milanese, allied with France, were firmly entrenched in Genoa, Fregoso could see little else to do but join himself to Giuliano della Rovere in the hope that the cardinal-nephew of Sixtus IV would be able to work some plan in his favor. By nature, Fregoso was a man of direct action, as he had demonstrated both in 1461 and 1481. Although the Cardinal of Genoa was highly admired for his courage by both high and low alike, the possibility of his achieving the tiara was remote. No one could deny his years of experience in Italian affairs but his former successes had won for him many enemies, not the least of whom was Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti, whose brother, Ludovico il Moro, regent of Milan, had been responsible for deposing Fregoso from the dogate in 1487. Since Ascanio was Borgia's chief supporter and unlikely to consider any arrangement with Fregoso, the latter's prospects were nil.\n\nIn contrast to the flashing and vibrant Fregoso stood the wealthy and sybaritic Giangiacomo Sclafenati. A Milanese, born in September, 1451, he had the good fortune to be appointed private secretary to Sixtus IV. Soon, he became an auditor of the Rota and a canon of Saint Peter's in addition to holding the office of archpriest of the Roman church of Santi Celso e Giuliano. As papal secretary, he received several other lucrative papal appointments, including that of secretary to the College, which he received on July 3, 1480, in succession to Stefano Burelli, who had died a little before.(177) At about this same time Sclafenati was ordained a priest by the chamberlain of the College, Giovanni Battista Zeno. (178)\n\nNow ordained, he was advanced to the vacant diocese of Parma in the late summer of 1482. (179) The apogee of his meteoric rise in ecclesiastical affairs was reached on November 15, 1483, when he was made cardinal-priest of the title of Santo Stefano al Monte Celio. (180) He participated in the conclave of 1484, but during the reign of Innocent VIII he was content to employ his large fortune, accumulated through his ecclesiastical offices, in pursuit of a luxurious life, emulating some of the more senior cardinals, like Borgia and Riario.\n\nSclafenati was in no sense papabile, for he was, correctly, considered to be too wholeheartedly devoted to secular activities to address himself to the problems of the Church. Innocent VIII had displayed many of the same characteristics before his elevation, and neither the Borgian party nor that of Giuliano della Rovere wished to risk a repetition of the disasters of the reign just ended. Moreover, each of the two great rival parties thought that Sclafenati might too easily fall under the domination of some influential cardinal drawn from the ranks of the enemy. In addition, even if he had been truly able, age told against Sclafenati, for he was only forty-one. Comparative youth is never an asset during the conclaves, simply because the older cardinals rightly feel that the elevation of a younger man all but permanently bars the rest of them from any chance at the tiara.\n\nThe most junior of the surviving creations of Sixtus IV, yet perhaps the most astute, was Ascanio Maria Sforza-Visconti. Of all the new breed of political cardinals in the fifteenth century, he came from the family which had risen the highest in the shortest space of time. Ascanio was born in March, 1455, at Cremona, the son of Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan, and the grandson of Filippo Maria Visconti, also duke of Milan. Two of the cardinal's brothers, Galeazzo Maria and Ludovico, also were Milanese dukes; while his niece, Bianca, was subsequently Empress.(181)\n\nThe complex problems which Ascanio had to surmount in his rise to the cardinalate are worth some detailed examination, since they reveal to us a good deal about the nature of papal government and the use of the cardinalate as a political reward in this age. When still only a protonotary apostolic, Ascanio was first mentioned as a possible cardinal at the time of the conclave of 1471. (182) Giullaume d'Estouteville, the aging cardinal-dean, who very much wanted to secure the tiara, made a bid for the support of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Ascanio's brother. D'Estouteville promised the Milanese duke that if he were able to obtain the papal chair, Ascanio would be created a cardinal. (183) Ascanio's name next appears in connection with the cardinalitial office in a consistory held by Sixtus IV on March 24, 1477. At that time, the pope proposed his name to the cardinals, together with the names of four others, as one to whom he would like to give the red hat. (184) The negotiations between Sixtus and the College lasted all summer, and on the following December 10, all those whose names had been advanced by the pontiff were created, except Ascanio. (185) Sixtus, after having failed in his first attempt to secure the cardinalate for the Milanese prince, made Ascanio bishop of Pavia in September, 1479. (186)\n\nIn the early weeks of 1483, when Sixtus' struggle with the Venetians was mounting in intensity, Ascanio participated in the Congress of Cremona. The Congress, summoned by Sixtus to form alliances to aid the papacy in its quarrel with Venice, was attended by Alfonso d'Aragona, duke of Calabria; Lorenzo de' Medici, Ercole d'Este, Federigo Gonzaga; and Giovanni Bentivoglio, lord of Bologna. (187) They formed an alliance which included, besides the papacy, Naples, Milan, Ferrara, and Florence. The conclusion of the Congress was entirely favorable to Sixtus IV and the pope felt strong enough to begin the campaign against Venice by imposing an interdict. The entire College, with the exception of the Venetian cardinals of Paul II, approved this course of action on May 24, 1483. (188) At the request of the allies, particularly, of course, Milan, Ascanio was finally created a cardinal-deacon on March 6, 1484. His name was published on March 17, and the pope then dispatched to the Milanese the red hat together with assignment to the diaconate of Santi Vito e Modesto, which had just been vacated by the transfer of Giovanni Battista Savelli to San Niccolo in Carcere Tulliano. (189) Sixtus was able to bend the will of the College to his view by this time for two reasons. First, the political exigencies of the moment did not permit any quibbling with the desires of the allies, and, second, Sixtus had by now filled the College sufficiently with his own creations so that the opposition was now a distinct minority.\n\nIt might have been thought that, after having finally achieved the great prize, Ascanio would rush to Rome to formally assume his new dignity, but such was not the case. Ascanio did not enter Rome until August 23, 1484, eleven days after the death of Sixtus. Ascanio was never received as cardinal by Sixtus IV, and the ceremony of the opening of the mouth had not been performed at the time of the pope's death. Nevertheless Ascanio was accepted as a cardinal with full rights in the conclave of 1484. (190) Three days later the Milanese entered the conclave and, significantly, immediately adhered to the papal cause of Borgia, Ascanio was, however, persuaded to give his vote to Cibo, and aided the latter to become Innocent VIII. (191)\n\nOnce having entered the cardinalate, Ascanio threw himself with zest into the political life of both the College and Italy. He attracted considerable attention, for example, in the consistory of March 5, 1486, when the discussion turned to the matter of obtaining aid to defend Rome from the armies of Naples and the Orsini. (192) Cardinal Jean Balue proposed summoning Rene d'Anjou, titular king of Naples, to the aid of the papacy, thus posing a threat to the continued tenure of Ferrante on the Neapolitan throne. Ascanio vehemently opposed this suggestion, and the argument between the two cardinals became so violent that Innocent was forced to demand silence from both. (193) The support given by Ascanio to Ferrante came before the formal Milanese alliance with France. When Ferrante finally agreed to discuss a binding peace with Innocent VIII, he dispatched his grandson, Ferdinando, prince of Capua, to Rome. He was the eldest son of Alfonso, duke of Calabria, the heir to the Neapolitan throne. (194) Ferdinando arrived in May, 1492, and was given a sumptuous banquet and entertainment by Ascanio. Stefano Infessura states that he would not attempt to describe the banquet, for it was so magnificent that if he were to give an account no one would believe him. (195)\n\nAs the reference to this dinner shows, Ascanio was every inch a Renaissance prince who delighted in entertaining lavishly. His standard of living was a state of luxury which few monarchs of the day could enjoy and which, among the cardinals, was eclipsed only by Borgia. The Milanese cardinal was also an astute politician and statesman; few in his time could rival his command of diplomacy and statecraft. In fact, Ascanio was, with Cardinal Ardicino della Porta, one of the two prelates most discussed as a possible pope during the last days of Innocent VIII and the first hours of the vacancy, according to Giovanni Andrea Boccacio, bishop of Modena, in a letter to Eleanora d'Aragona, duchess of Ferrara. (196) Nor were the Milanese hopes without merit. Ascanio was held in high regard as a diplomat and politician; in addition, he had demonstrated that most highly valued of administrative talents in the Renaissance, the ability to acquire benefices, to retain them, and to obtain large profit from them. That was the mark of success in a Church bureaucrat.\n\nAscanio's pride did not at first allow him to see the many forces at work which would effectively bar him from the throne. First, Milan was at the front of the diplomatic disturbances which were, at this very moment, in the process of shattering forever Lorenzo de' Medici's carefully constructed balance of power in the peninsula-the Concert of Italy. To advance Ascanio would have meant committing the Church for some time to come to a foreign policy that reflected the ambitions of Ascanio's brother, the Milanese regent, Ludovico il Moro. The two brothers had always been, and would remain, very close personally and politically. (197) The Neapolitans were ready to exert themselves in every way to cleanse Ascanio of the ambition to be the pontiff to usher in the sixteenth century, since the new Milanese alliance with France, whose king claimed the Neapolitan crown, could not bode well for Ferrante. It was well recognized everywhere in Italy that few families had displayed more ambition and thirst for power than the Sforza, and their forebears, the Visconti; and few would have been willing to unleash upon the Church a scion of the house whose armorial device depicted a serpent swallowing a child.\n\nAll the remaining cardinals were created by Innocent VIII on March 9, 1489. Of the eight men named to the College on that occasion, only six were fully recognized as cardinals during the last moments of Innocent's life. Two, Maffeo Gherardo, patriarch of Venice,(198) and Federico Sanseverino, (199) were dubious cardinals, because their names had not been formally published.\n\nSanseverino, who was the junior creation in the consistory of March 9, 1489, was born at Naples into the family of the counts of Caiazzo. He was the son of the condottiere Roberto Sanseverino, who had entered papal service in 1485, after having formerly served the Venetians. The elder Sanseverino rescued the pope and the city of Rome from the siege of Alfonso of Calabria in the last days of 1485, and the creation of Federico as cardinal in 1489 was a gesture of thanks on the part of Innocent VIII.\n\nWhen these two cardinals finally were acknowledged as members of the College, part of the reason was that neither was a candidate for the throne-Gherardo was well advanced into the ninth decade of life, while Sanseverino was barely out of his teens.\n\nMaffeo Gherardo was born in Venice about 1406. He entered the Camaldolese when young and rose to the position of abbot general of his order. In 1456, he was named patriarch of Venice, and this office was confirmed to him in 1468. On July 3, 1489, Innocent VIII declared that if the Venetian's name had not been published at the time of the next conclave he was to be admitted with full voting rights. Perhaps at that time, or at the time of his creation, the diaconate of Santi Sergio e Bacco was reserved for Gherardo, but he never held that rank.\n\nVII. The Cardinals of Innocent VIII.\n\nInnocent's senior creation was his cardinal-nephew, Lorenzo Cibo di Mari, who became nominal leader of his uncle's cardinals in the conclave of 1492. He was no intellectual, no schemer, no politician, and was content to take a subordinate position. Cibo would not be chosen pope, if only because tradition forbade any pope being succeeded directly by his nephew.\n\nCibo was born in 1450 and was the illegitimate son of Innocent's brother, Maurizio. After his uncle became cardinal, Lorenzo was made a canon of Saint Peter's. Following the election of Innocent to the throne in 1484, Lorenzo Cibo di Mari began to receive a host of rich benefices, the greatest of which was the archdiocese of Benevento given to him on December 5, 1485. He was created and published a cardinal-priest on March 9, 1489, and received the red hat on the same day. On the following March 23, the pope performed the ceremony of the opening of the mouth for him and, at the same time, assigned to him the title of Santa Sussanna. In 1490, Cibo became administrator of the diocese of Vannes. In January, 1492, the cardinal-nephew was elected to an annual term as chamberlain of the College and was serving in that office all through the sede vacante of 1492.\n\nThe precedents established in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries made the eventual enthronement of Cibo a distinct possibility, but not in the conclave which followed his uncle's death. In the fifteenth century alone, Eugenius IV, nephew of Gregory XII, had become pope only after the intervening reign of Martin V; while Paul II, Eugenius' nephew, had achieved the throne only after the reigns of Nicholas V, Calixtus III, and Pius II. Within the lifetime of Lorenzo Cibo, the Church would see the cardinal-nephews of Calixtus III, Sixtus IV, and Pius II, as popes, but in no case directly after the death of the pope who had made them cardinals.

The wedding took place on January 30, 1488, in the presence of the pontiff. Part of the agreement which led to this family alliance was that Giovanni should be raised to the cardinalate in spite of his youth. On March 9, 1489, he was made a cardinal-deacon at the age of thirteen years, thirty-eight days, the youngest cardinal ever created up to that time.
