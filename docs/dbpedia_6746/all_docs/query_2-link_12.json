        "text": "Pope Alexander VI was the 214th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church. He was ruler of the Papal States and head of the Catholic church for just over 11 years from 11th August 1492 until his death in 1503.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn Roderic de Borja, Pope Alexander VI grew up in the small town of Xatavia, which is now part of Spain. When his maternal uncle became Pope Callixtus III, Roderic adopted the name, Rodrigo Borja.\n\nAfter studying law at the University of Bologna and earning a degree, he became the Cardinal Deacon of a local church. Rodrigo spent many years serving the Church in different roles and had experience working with five popes before he became pope.\n\nPapal Election\n\nLeading up to the death of Innocent VIII, the Church had more than 20 names chosen for the next pope, including 10 directly related to the pope. Rumors say that Rodrigo purchased some of the votes, but other records show that he was a popular choice. Some records show he bought votes as did other men at the time.\n\nHe was elected pope in 1492 and chose the name Alexander. Though he is officially Pope Alexander VI, he is only the fifth man to use that name due to the Catholic antipope.\n\nControversies\n\nMost of the controversies surrounding this pope relate to Inter caetera, a papal bull he issued in 1493. This bull granted King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella western and southern lands due to their support of the Church. The bull led to a massive war between France and Portugal.\n\nHe also had a role in the Italian War of 1491 – 1498 as he sided with the French during their invasion of Naples. Alexander had a son named Cesare who some historians believe helped him poison a cardinal. Those who were with him when he passed away claimed that the pope was repentant of some of the decisions he made.\n\nEvents In The Life of Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo de Borja)\n\nQuick Facts About Pope Alexander VI\n\nHe was born on January 1, 1431, in Xativa, which was in the Kingdom of Valencia and the Crown of Aragon.\n\nGiven the name Roderic de Borja at birth, he also used the name, Rodrigo Borja.\n\nHe died at the age of 72 on August 18, 1503, in Rome.\n\nAlexander VI died of an illness that caused him to take to bed on August 12. He would remain in bed over the new few days and receive the Extreme Unction right before his death. Cesare sent men to raid the pope’s belongings. The Church also displayed the pope’s body to his followers the next day.\n\nThe papacy of Alexander VI began on August 11, 1492.\n\nHis papacy ended on August 18, 1503.\n\nPope Pius II succeeded Pope Alexander VI.\n\nInteresting Facts About Pope Alexander VI\n\nAlexander VI had multiple mistresses and affairs both before and after becoming pope. He met Vannozza dei Cattanei in 1470 and began a relationship with her that lasted for many years. They had at least four children together, all of whom he legitimized after becoming pope.\n\nThe Church allowed his children to live in the Papal Palace, though they split their time between Rome and their mother’s home.\n\nThere are at least four other children likely born to Pope Alexander VI, including Isabella who is a decedent of Pope Innocent X.\n\nAlexander VI lived in the Borgias’ Apartments in the Papal Palace. The Church sealed his living quarters and kept them sealed until the 1800s. Future popes refused to live there because they believed he desecrated the space.\n\n”Assassin’s Creed: Lineage” uses Alexander VI as a character played by Manuel Tadros.\n\nAll Popes with the name “Alexander”\n\nThere has has been 7 Popes that have taken the name Alexander. Below are links to all of them. Also check out all of the other Popes the begin with the letter A."
