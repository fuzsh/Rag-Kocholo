        "text": "Do you know who the Pope is?Â\n\nGlobally, everyone is familiar with the figure of the Pope, the Bishop of Rome and the highest authority in the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, the Pope has always been a figure shrouded with mystery and who recalls a lot of intrigue. With one of the highest statuses and responsibilities to have, we wonder if the Pope follows normal, everyday routines (somewhat) like the rest of us.Â\n\nOne of the questions that may sprout in your mind about the pope is:\n\nWhat country does the Pope live in?Â\n\nThe Pontiff, in fact, lives in Vatican City, of which he is also the sovereign, a small city-state located in the heart of Rome. Formally, therefore, the Pope does not live in Italy.\n\nThis article aims to debunk some of the mysteries surrounding the figure of the Pope, including answering the question, âWhere does the Pope reside?â today and where he has lived in the past, with an in-depth look at these marvelous residences.\n\nWhere did the Pope live in the Middle Ages\n\nThroughout history, the popes have inhabited different residences. The list includes:\n\nLateran Palace, Rome:\n\nStill accessible to the public and in fact, a very important pilgrimage site, the Lateran palace is located on Piazza di San Giovanni in Rome. It was the papal residence from the time of Pope Sylvester I from the early 4th century, till Benedict XI in 1304. Within the complex, tourists can visit the basilica, the Lateran Baptistery and the Scala Sancta (Holy Stairs).\n\nPapal Palace, Viterbo:Â\n\nThis palace was home to the popes starting with Pope Alexander IV in 1257 to Martin IV in 1281. Although the palace is not open to the public, its medieval architecture can still be admired while exploring the charming, historic city of Viterbo.\n\nPapal Palace, Avignon:Â\n\nOne of the pope’s residences is a UNESCO World Heritage site! The Palais de Papes in Avignon, a commune in the southeast of France, is one of the largest medieval Gothic structures found in Europe. We can imagine that it would make an extremely popular tourist destination. Visitors can weave in and out of the chambers and chapels of this palace. It served as a residence for the popes from Clement V in 1309, till Gregory XI in 1377 during the Avignon papacy. This burdening problems of factionalism in Rome during this period caused this temporary move of the papal capital to Avignon.\n\nQuirinal Palace, Rome:Â\n\nLocated on Quirinal hill, which is one of the seven hills that make up Rome, this palace served as a home for the popes starting with Urban VIII in 1605 till Pius IX in 1870, excluding some periods in between. This palace now serves as the home of the President of the Italian Republic, making it closed to tourists. Sometimes the exterior gardens of the palace may be accessed for certain events.\n\nWhere do popes live nowadays?\n\nWhere is the Pope’s house?\n\nSince 1870, the papal residence has been transferred to the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City. This is where the popes have lived from Pius IX to Benedict XVI.\n\nWhen was the Vatican Palace built?\n\nThe building plans for the Apostolic Palace began in 1471 and were fully realised by 1605. Although most parts of the papal palace are closed to the public, there are some sections that are open to visit. This building is where the Sistine Chapel, Clementine Hall, the Borgia Apartments and the Raphael rooms are situated.\n\nTherefore, the Apostolic Palace can be visited through the same ticket that gives you entrance to the entirety of the museums!\n\nIt is important to clarify that in the past, the term Apostolic Palaces referred to various locations in the city of Rome, while today it is used exclusively to refer to the Vatican Palaces, an important example of local architecture.\n\nWhere does Pope Francis live?\n\nWell, our current Pope must live in the Apostolic Palace as well, right?Â\n\nNo.Â\n\nPope Francis has chosen not to live inside the Apostolic Palace but only to visit for official visits and Sunday ceremonies!Â\n\nThe reigning Pope, in fact, lives at Casa Santa Marta (Domus Sanctae Marthae). This is a building found adjacent to the St. Peterâs Basilica, which was built in 1996 to serve as the first official guesthouse reserved for cardinals during a conclave.Â\n\nPope Francis is the first pope in 110 years to not have lived in the Apostolic Palace. This is because he preferred simpler, smaller and less isolating accommodation than what the palace offered him!\n\nThe Papal summer residence\n\nDo Pope’s go on vacation?\n\nYes, they do!\n\nOver the centuries, popes have spent part of the summer season in a location different from the apostolic palaces.\n\nThe Pope summer residence was the Quirinal Palace, Rome, from 1583 to 1870, alternating with the Pontifical Palace. Castel Gandolfo became a stable summer choice in the twentieth century. However, Pope Francis does not prefer to journey to Castel Gandolfo for the summer either! Instead, he stays within Casa Santa Marta. This has allowed the public opening of the former summer residence, attracting a large number of tourists. The papal apartments can be toured as well as the gardens.Â\n\nWalks Inside Rome actually runs a cooking school within the residence! We offer a day trip to Castel Gandolfo complete with a delightful cooking experience that actually makes use of farm-to-table produce grown in the pope’s gardens!\n\nTo fully be present with, and make use of all the elements that are a part of Castel Gandolfo, consider booking the tour. You can get in touch with our team at [email protected] to further navigate this opportunity."
