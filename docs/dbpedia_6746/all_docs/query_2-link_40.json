        "text": "When Alexander VI fell ill in August 1503, at least he had some company. His illegitimate son, Cesare, got sick, too, along with the Cardinal who hosted the dinner party preceding their illnesses. Much speculation arose that someone poisoned his Holiness; there were several theories about why someone would do that, but two of the most popular were the fact that he had many enemies and the fact that he, the head of the church, also poisoned many people.\n\nPerhaps someone poisoned him out of retribution, or he accidentally imbibed poison he intended for someone else. But Alexander VI's symptoms aligned with ones seen in malaria too, which spread through much of Rome at the time.\n\nAlexander VI and his son, Cesare, dined with Cardinal Adrian Cornetto the night before they became ill. The Cardinal, the wealthiest member of the College of Cardinals, was rumored to be wanted dead by the Pope and his son. Alexander and Cesare allegedly spiked the wine with cantarella, a poison akin to arsenic and the go-to choice of the Borgias. The Cardinal was supposed to be the only one who drank from the poisoned bottle, after which he would experience abdominal discomfort, confusion, and weakness.\n\nWhether or not Alexander and Cesare drank the poison remains unknown but they both sported fevers shortly after the meal. Cardinal Cornetto got sick, too, which fueled rumors of a poisoning gone wrong.\n\nTrying to rid Alexander VI of his illness and re-balance his humours, the doctors let his blood. According to sources, the doctors marveled at how much blood flowed freely from the Pope's body, up to 13 ounces.\n\nThe ebbs and flows in his fever caused his doctors to diagnose him with \"tertian ague,\" or malaria, with symptoms reappearing every 48 hours. Depending on the severity of this type of malaria, the Pope could have experienced convulsions, difficulty breathing, and blackwater fever - if he suffered from malaria at all.\n\nBy the fourth day of his illness, the Pope had already tried various medicines with little improvement. He continued to vomit and excrete green substances, growing weaker and weaker. On the fifth day, August 18, Alexander VI confessed, heard mass from his bed, took the Eucharist, and then lost consciousness.\n\nBy late evening, he received his last rites and died shortly thereafter. At the time of the Pope's death, five Cardinals were present, along with bishops, grooms, and members of his papal curia.\n\nRight before the Pope died, an order was issued that declared no one could leave the Vatican. Regardless, many people managed to leave, taking valuable treasures with them, including Cesare's right-hand man, Don Michelotto. On Cesare's orders, Michelotto and his men drew daggers upon the Cardinals and forced them to open the cabinets where the papal riches lay. They seized chests of money and as much silver as they could carry.\n\nBecause they left the cabinets open, others began to take items after Michelotto and his men departed. Servants took clothes and anything they found, leaving only a few chairs, pillows, and rugs behind.\n\nAs he was dying, Alexander VI never called out for any of his children, including his son Cesare and his daughter Lucretia - sources vary on the exact reason why, but it was likely due to his sick delirium or generally selfish personality. The ill Cesare also never visited his father and there is no indication that anyone other than clergy members spent time with the sick Pope.\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Alexander VI's illness may also explain why no one was allowed to see him in his final days."
