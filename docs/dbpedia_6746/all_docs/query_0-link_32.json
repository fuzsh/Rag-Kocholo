        "text": "By Anne Leader\n\nItalian cardinal and art patron Pietro Ottoboni died on 28 February 1740 in Rome. Appointed as cardinal of San Lorenzo in Damaso and then vice-chancellor by his great-uncle Pope Alexander VIII, Ottoboni was well known in Rome as a lover of music, theater, poetry, and the visual arts. Among his commissions were a tomb for his papal great-uncle at St. Peter’s, a series of canvases depicting the seven sacraments by Giuseppe Crespi, and various works by Francesco Trevisani. He also made changes to the Palazzo della Cancelleria, including the construction of a theater by Filippo Juvarra and various interior decorations by Domenico Paradisi and Angelo de Rossi.\n\nFrancesco Trevisani, Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, c.1689, oil on canvas.
