        "text": "Alexander, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to the illustrious sovereigns, our very dear son\n\nin Christ, Ferdinand, king, and our very dear daughter in Christ, Isabella, queen of Castile, Leon,\n\nAragon, Sicily, and Granada, health and apostolic benediction. Among other works well pleasing\n\nto the Divine Majesty and cherished of our heart, this assuredly ranks highest, that in our times\n\nespecially the Catholic faith and the Christian religion be exalted and be everywhere increased\n\nand spread, that the health of souls be cared for and that barbarous nations be overthrown and\n\nbrought to the faith itself. Wherefore inas- much as by the favor of divine clemency, we, though\n\nof insufficient merits, have been called to this Holy See of Peter, recognizing that as true\n\nCatholic kings and princes, such as we have known you always to be, and as your illustrious\n\ndeeds already known to almost the whole world declare, you not only eagerly desire but with\n\nevery effort, zeal, and diligence, without regard to hardships, expenses, dangers, with the\n\nshedding even of your blood, are laboring to that end; recognizing also that you have long since\n\ndedicated to this purpose your whole soul and all your endeavors–as witnessed in these times\n\nwith so much glory to the Divine Name in your recovery of the kingdom of Granada from the\n\nyoke of the Saracens–we therefore are rightly led, and hold it as our duty, to grant you even of\n\nour own accord and in your favor those things whereby with effort each day more hearty you\n\nmay be enabled for the honor of God himself and the spread of the Christian rule to carry\n\nforward your holy and praiseworthy purpose so pleasing to immortal God. We have indeed\n\nlearned that you, who for a long time had intended to seek out and discover certain islands and\n\nmainlands remote and unknown and not hitherto discovered by others, to the end that you might\n\nbring to the worship of our Redeemer and the profession of the Catholic faith their residents and\n\ninhabitants, having been up to the present time greatly engaged in the siege and recovery of the\n\nkingdom itself of Granada were unable to accomplish this holy and praiseworthy purpose; but\n\nthe said kingdom having at length been regained, as was pleasing to the Lord, you, with the wish\n\nto fulfill your desire, chose our beloved son, Christopher Columbus, a man assuredly worthy and\n\n— page 2 —\n\nof the highest recommendations and fitted for so great an undertaking, whom you furnished with\n\nships and men equipped for like designs, not without the greatest hardships, dangers, and\n\nexpenses, to make diligent quest for these remote and unknown mainlands and islands through\n\nthe sea, where hitherto no one had sailed; and they at length, with divine aid and with the utmost\n\ndiligence sailing in the ocean sea, discovered certain very remote islands and even mainlands\n\nthat hitherto had not been discovered by others; wherein dwell very many peoples living in\n\npeace, and, as reported, going unclothed, and not eating flesh. Moreover, as your aforesaid\n\nenvoys are of opinion, these very peoples living in the said islands and countries believe in one\n\nGod, the Creator in heaven, and seem sufficiently disposed to embrace the Catholic faith and be\n\ntrained in good morals. And it is hoped that, were they instructed, the name of the Savior, our\n\nLord Jesus Christ, would easily be introduced into the said countries and islands. Also, on one of\n\nthe chief of these aforesaid islands the said Christopher has already caused to be put together and\n\nbuilt a fortress fairly equipped, wherein he has stationed as garrison certain Christians,\n\ncompanions of his, who are to make search for other remote and unknown islands and\n\nmainlands. In the islands and countries already discovered are found gold, spices, and very many\n\nother precious things of divers kinds and qualities. Wherefore, as becomes Catholic kings and\n\nprinces, after earnest consideration of all matters, especially of the rise and spread of the Catholic\n\nfaith, as was the fashion of your ancestors, kings of renowned memory, you have purposed with\n\nthe favor of divine clemency to bring under your sway the said mainlands and islands with their\n\nresidents and inhabitants and to bring them to the Catholic faith. Hence, heartily commending in\n\nthe Lord this your holy and praiseworthy purpose, and desirous that it be duly accomplished, and\n\nthat the name of our Savior be carried into those regions, we exhort you very earnestly in the\n\nLord and by your reception of holy baptism, whereby you are bound to our apostolic commands,\n\nand by the bowels of the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, enjoy strictly, that inasmuch as with\n\neager zeal for the true faith you design to equip and despatch this expedition, you purpose also,\n\nas is your duty, to lead the peoples dwelling in those islands and countries to embrace the\n\nChristian religion; nor at any time let dangers or hardships deter you therefrom, with the stout\n\nhope and trust in your hearts that Almighty God will further your undertakings. And, in order\n\nthat you may enter upon so great an undertaking with greater readiness and heartiness endowed\n\nwith benefit of our apostolic favor, we, of our own accord, not at your instance nor the request of\n\nanyone else in your regard, but out of our own sole largess and certain knowledge and out of the\n\n— page 3 —\n\nfullness of our apostolic power, by the authority of Almighty God conferred upon us in blessed\n\nPeter and of the vicarship of Jesus Christ, which we hold on earth, do by tenor of these presents,\n\nshould any of said islands have been found by your envoys and captains, give, grant, and assign\n\nto you and your heirs and successors, kings of Castile and Leon, forever, together with all their\n\ndominions, cities, camps, places, and villages, and all rights, jurisdictions, and appurtenances, all\n\nislands and mainlands found and to be found, discovered and to be discovered towards the west\n\nand south, by drawing and establishing a line from the Arctic pole, namely the north, to the\n\nAntarctic pole, namely the south, no matter whether the said mainlands and islands are found and\n\nto be found in the direction of India or towards any other quarter, the said line to be distant one\n\nhundred leagues towards the west and south from any of the islands commonly known as the\n\nAzores and Cape Verde. With this proviso however that none of the islands and mainlands,\n\nfound and to be found, discovered and to be discovered, beyond that said line towards the west\n\nand south, be in the actual possession of any Christian king or prince up to the birthday of our\n\nLord Jesus Christ just past from which the present year one thousand four hundred ninety-three\n\nbegins. And we make, appoint, and depute you and your said heirs and successors lords of them\n\nwith full and free power, authority, and jurisdiction of every kind; with this proviso however,\n\nthat by this our gift, grant, and assignment no right acquired by any Christian prince, who may be\n\nin actual possesssion of said islands and mainlands prior to the said birthday of our Lord Jesus\n\nChrist, is hereby to be understood to be withdrawn or taking away. Moreover we command you\n\nin virtue of holy obedience that, employing all due diligence in the premises, as you also\n\npromise–nor do we doubt your compliance therein in accordance with your loyalty and royal\n\ngreatness of spirit–you should appoint to the aforesaid mainlands and islands worthy, Godfearing, learned, skilled, and expeienced men, in order to instruct the aforesaid inhabitants and\n\nresidents in the Catholic faith and train them in good morals. Furthermore, under penalty of\n\nexcommunication “late sententie” to be incurred “ipso facto,” should anyone thus contravene, we\n\nstrictly forbid all persons of whatsoever rank, even imperial and royal, or of whatsoever estate,\n\ndegree, order, or condition, to dare without your special permit or that of your aforesaid heirs and\n\nsuccessors, to go for the purpose of trade or any other reason to the islands or mainlands, found\n\nand to be found, discovered and to be discovered, towards the west and south, by drawing and\n\nestablishing a line from the Arctic pole to the Antarctic pole, no matter whether the mainlands\n\nand islands, found and to be found, lie in the direction of India or toward any other quarter\n\n— page 4 —"
