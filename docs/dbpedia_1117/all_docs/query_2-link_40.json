And of course, one such cliché is the key change! Here’s a video (with good audio quality but less good video quality) from the Tony Awards, with Sutton Foster performing the song. There’s a long intro to the actual song, which doesn’t start until 1:35; after many other key changes, the main modulation is around 4:35. It is probably the most self-referential modulation ever!”"
