        "meta_description": "Setting the Scene\nThe Show Co-written by Don McKellar and Bob Martin, The Drowsy Chaperone debuted in Toronto in 1998 and opened on Broadway in 2006. The two friends had no idea that the joking spoof of 1920s musical comedy that they devised at Martin's 1997 bachelor party would morph into a hit musical of the decade. The show centers on The Man in Chair, a meek, mousy Broadway fanatic, who decides to listen to the soundtrack of his favorite fictional 1920s musical hit, The Drowsy Chaperone. As the music plays, the show comes alive in his apartment and he watches and narrates the stage cues as flappers, gangsters disguised as pastry chefs, and even a female aviatrix sing and dance across his living room. A show within a show, The Drowsy Chaperone fuses big band jazz musical numbers, flamboyant dance routines, and dynamic characters with 1920s Jazz Age culture. The Drowsy Chaperone was nominated for several Tony and Drama Desk Awards and won the Tony awards for Best Original Score, Best Book of a Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Costume Design.",
