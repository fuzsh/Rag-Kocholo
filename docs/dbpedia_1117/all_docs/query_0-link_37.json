        "text": "CLAREMONT, CA – A rare combination of unprecedented originality and blinding talent, THE DROWSY CHAPERONE boldly addresses a great unspoken desire in all of our hearts: to be entertained. If you’ve ever sat in a dark theatre and thought, “Dear Lord in heaven please let it be good,” this is the show for you! It all begins when a die-hard musical-theater fan plays his favorite cast album on his turntable, and the musical literally bursts to life in his living room, telling the rambunctious tale of a brazen Broadway starlet trying to find, and keep, her true love.\n\nThe curtain rises on a New York apartment and the time is now, today. We meet our host, “The Man in the Chair”, a mousy, agoraphobic man who is content to stay in his apartment listening to his favorite records…yes, records. The man puts on the LP to his favorite musicalThe Drowsy Chaperone. As he does, the show comes to life in his living room. The actors burst out of the walls and take us back to the 1920’s when prohibition was in full force and the champagne flowed, for the rich, at least. What makes this show so fun is that aside from the actual plot, we are also privy to the off stage lives of the actors in The Drowsy Chaperone. It’s like watching a show and being back stage at the same time. The “Man in the Chair” let’s us in on all the history and gossip pertaining to this quirky group of actors. He fondly recalls and compares the old shows of yesterday to the new of today. Times have changed and so have musicals. This show pays homage to the past while having its feet firmly in the present.\n\nIn 1998, writer and comedian Bob Martin asked his great friend Lisa Lambert to be his best man at his upcoming wedding to Janet Van de Graaf. Instead of the typical Bachelor Party festivities, Lisa created an evening of entertainment in two acts, and put it on at a club in Toronto called the Rivoli.\n\nAfter the initial presentation of the show for Bob and Janet, the groom (Mr. Martin) came on to help write the book for the show. Along with Don McKellar they created the role of The Man in Chair, a simple man who never leaves his apartment and is obsessed with a certain musical. The Drowsy Chaperone is a fictional musical of 1928. The characters are sometimes ridiculous, sometimes familiar, and always hilarious.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone debuted in Toronto, at the Toronto Fringe Festival. After much success, the show was expanded for a production at Toronto’s 160 seat Theatre Passe Muraille in 1999. Great reviews and ticket sales led to a full-scale production in 2001, this time at Toronto’s 1000 seat Winter Garden Theatre. In 2005 a Pre Broadway production was seen at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles before finally, opening on Broadway on at the Marquis Theatre on May 1st 2006. The show has also been produced in London and Japan as well as two North American Tours.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone was nominated for 13 Tony Awards and won 5, including Best Book and Best Original Score. It was nominated for 14 Drama Desk Awards and won 8. The show was even nominated for 5 Olivier Awards for the 2008 London Production!\n\nThe Candlelight Pavilion has brought on husband and wife team, and Candlelight Vets, Carlos Martin, as Director, and Kami Seymour, as Choreographer, to bring you this gem of a show. Both have been involved in many productions at the Candlelight Pavilion including 1994’sThe Will Roger’s Follies and Singin’ in the Rain, for Martin, and A Chorus a Line and 42nd Street, for Seymour. Last year this team had the pleasure of working together in the Southern California Premiere of The Drowsy Chaperone at the Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton. With the addition of their friend and mentor Douglas Austin as Musical Director, this made for the Triple Crown! Douglas has not only Musically Directed numerous shows for the Candlelight Pavilion, including this 2012’s Fiddler on the Roof, he has been musical director to both Carlos and Kami. Douglas is the current Director of the Internationally Acclaimed Citrus College Singers, and creator of the Citrus College Women’s Ensemble. According to Martin, “All three members of the production team are as passionate about this incredible show as the incredible crew that has built the set, and the wonderful professional actors who are working tirelessly to bring it to life.”\n\nThis wonderful cast includes, Chuck Ketter as Man in Chair, Shaina Zalma Ostroff as Mrs. Tottendale, Neil Dale as Underling, Wesley Alfvin as Robert Martin, Chris Duir as George, Robert Hoyt as Feldzieg, Tracy Pedretti as Kitty, Jon M. Wailin as Gangster #1, Adam Trent as Gangster #2, John LaLonde as Aldolpho, Laura Thatcher as Janet van de Graaff, Debbie Prutsman as The Drowsy Chaperone, Jessica Mason as Trix the Aviatrix, Steven Arlen as Superintendent/Ensemble, with an amazing ensemble cast, which includes, Emily Dauwalder, Janell Henry, and Tim Woods.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone opens March 2nd at the Candlelight Pavilion Dinner Theater.
