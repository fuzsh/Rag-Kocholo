        "text": "When the final chapter unfolded, the storybook musical missed out on its storybook ending.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone, the Canadian-spawned musical comedy that began as a Toronto fringe theatre production seven years ago before taking Broadway by storm this spring, took home five of the U.S. theatre world's biggest honours last night but was denied the biggest prize of all at the 60th annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nBob Martin and Don McKellar won the award for best book of a musical, the honour given to scriptwriters, while their friends and co-workers Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison won the award for best original score. The award for best musical, however, went to Jersey Boys, the rags-to-riches biographical tale about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons that also took home trophies for best actor, best featured actor, and best lighting for a musical.\n\nIn the end, the 763 Tony voters may have been swayed by a subtle nationalistic undercurrent. While the Drowsy Chaperone's creators have spoken at length about its Canadian comic sensibility, fans of Jersey Boys noted the show's spirit of pure Americana (though it was directed by Des McAnuff, a Canadian-raised transplant).\n\nThe Toronto-based foursome are the first Canadian writers to take home Tony Awards, which are administered by the American Theatre Wing and the League of American Theatres and Producers. Some previous Tony-winning shows began in Toronto under Garth Drabinsky's Livent Corporation, including Kiss of the Spider Woman, but were not created by Canadians.\n\nMr. Martin also stars in the show, a cheeky homage to the frothy Broadway musical comedies of the 1920s, as an obsessive theatre fan who invites the audience to watch along as one of those shows comes to life in his one-room apartment.\n\n\"Thank you, America,\" Mr. Martin said in accepting his award. \"This show expresses the voice of a group of writers and performers in Toronto, and we want to share this award with them -- not literally but figuratively.\"\n\nHis writing partner Mr. McKellar, well-known for his work in Canadian film ( The Red Violin, Exotica) but also a regular presence in the alternative Toronto theatre scene, thanked the show's director, Casey Nicholaw.\n\n\"Without him, we would have been deported back to Canada a long time ago,\" he said. \"Let me just thank the American musical comedy that's been around for about 100 years now, inspiring people and transporting them, and giving people like Bob and me lots of material to make fun of.\"\n\nMs. Lambert, who gave up her Toronto apartment when the show went on the road to Los Angeles last fall in a pre-Broadway tryout run, noted that she had paid her dues in various writing roles. \"For anybody who may have lived in Toronto between 1985 and 1995 who received a singing telegram set to the tune of Take Me Out to the Ballgame, you can now say it was written by a Tony Award-winning songwriter,\" she quipped.\n\nMr. Morrison thanked his parents, who watched the CBS broadcast in Kelly's Cross, Prince Edward Island. \"Thanks for buying that piano 30 years ago, for 100 bucks. Putting it in the basement, tearing the stairs out; it started all this for me,\" he said.\n\nBackstage, the foursome was giddy with their triumphs, trading quips and mutual ribbings.\n\n\"People are identifying with this character,\" said Mr. Martin of his role, to which Mr. McKellar shot back, \"It's all about you, isn't it?\" The Drowsy Chaperone grew out of a series of musical sketches presented during a bachelor party in a downtown Toronto club for Mr. Martin and his then-fiancée Janet Van De Graaff held in the summer of 1998.\n\nIt was remounted for a sold-out run the following year at the local Fringe Festival, went on to another run that fall at Theatre Passe Muraille, then was reconsidered and remounted in the spring of 2001 in a $1-million staging at the Winter Garden Theatre, produced by Mirvish Productions.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone grew out of a series of musical sketches presented during a bachelor party for Mr. Martin and his then-fiancée Janet Van De Graaff in a downtown Toronto club held in the summer of 1998.\n\nIt was remounted for a sold-out run the following year at the local Fringe Festival, went on to another run that fall at Theatre Passe Muraille, then was reconsidered and remounted in the spring of 2001 in a $1-million staging at the Winter Garden Theatre, produced by Mirvish Productions. It will likely tour, with talk of a Toronto stop on one of the Mirvish stages.\n\nThe show also picked up awards for best scenic design of a musical and best costume design of a musical. Beth Leavel won the award for best featured actress, the Broadway designation for a supporting role, for essaying the title role of the tipsy chaperone in the musical-within-a-comedy. Ms. Leavel thanked Mr. Martin and his wife \"for getting married.\"\n\nThe effervescent The Pajama Game proved a surprise winner for best revival of a musical, and its director and choreographer Kathleen Marshall won for her choreography. Best director of a musical went to John Doyle, for shepherding the critically acclaimed Sweeney Todd.\n\nRadio City Music Hall swarmed with movie stars last night as Broadway borrowed an A-list page from Hollywood to celebrate the 60th annual Tony Awards, the U.S. theatre world's highest honours. Julia Roberts, Oprah Winfrey, Jane Krakowski, Bebe Neuwirth, Cynthia Nixon, Joe Pesci, and Josh Lucas presented awards.\n\nTony nominations were made by a committee of nearly two dozen theatre professionals. Winners were chosen by 754 theatre professionals including actors, producers, writers, stagehands and theatre owners.\n\nSelected Winners\n\nPlay: The History Boys\n\nMusical: Jersey Boys\n\nBook-Musical: The Drowsy\n\nChaperone, Bob Martin and\n\nDon McKellar\n\nOriginal Score (Music and/or\n\nLyrics): The Drowsy Chaperone, Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison\n\nRevival-Play: Awake and Sing!\n\nFeatured Actor-Play: Ian\n\nMcDiarmid, Faith Healer\n\nFeatured Actress-Play: Frances de la Tour, The History Boys\n\nFeatured Actor-Musical:\n\nChristian Hoff, Jersey Boys\n\nFeatured Actress-Musical: Beth Leavel, The Drowsy Chaperone\n\nDirection-Play: Nicholas Hytner, The History Boys\n\nDirection-Musical: John Doyle, Sweeney Todd\n\nChoreography: Kathleen\n\nMarshall, The Pajama Game\n\nOrchestrations: Sarah Travis, Sweeney Todd\n\nScenic Design-Play: Bob Crowley, The History Boys\n\nScenic Design-Musical: David Gallo, The Drowsy Chaperone\n\nCostume Design-Play: Catherine Zuber, Awake and Sing!\n\nCostume Design-Musical: Gregg Barnes, The Drowsy Chaperone\n\nLighting Design-Play: Mark\n\nHenderson, The History Boys\n\nLighting Design-Musical: Howell Binkley, Jersey Boys\n\nSpecial Tony Award: Sarah Jones, Bridge and Tunnel"
