Howard)\n\nThe images represented on stage are coming from the Man in Chair's mind and are based upon his years of listening to the recording.\n\nHow closely these images come to the actual staged performance of the show we will never know...nor will we be able to dispute, since it is fictional.\n\nHowever, the above does free up both the creative team and cast to experiment which has resulted in a simply sensational production.\n\nIn actuality, \"CHAPERONE,\" the lighthearted Tony award-winning musical farce (for script and score), was written by the team of Bob Martin and Don McKellar with music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison.\n\nWithin moments, we are transported from his kitchen to the “Tottendale Estate,” or rather the estate is transported literally through spots in the Man’s kitchen, with characters making entrances and exits via his hideaway bed or through his refrigerator.\n\nThe Lyric set design for the Man’s kitchen and apartment is extremely imaginative, especially given the limited spacing allowed for such a musical staged on a larger scale.\n\nWe are introduced to musical’s famous leading lady, beautiful bride-to-be Janet Van De Graaff (Joy Clark).\n\nSimilar to Melendy as the Man in Chair, Clark is thoroughly in her element playing the vibrant and talented Janet, especially as she belts out the multi-faceted first act musical number, “Show Off.”\n\n(Photo: Joy Clark as “Janet Van De Graaff” surrounded by admiring reporters in a scene from the musical \"THE DROWSY CHAPERONE\" by Lisa Lambert, Greg Morrison, Bob Martin and Don McKellar, now playing at theLyric Stage in Boston, MA. until May 12, 2024. Photo Credit Mark S. Howard)\n\nJanet is intent on abandoning her career in order to marry oil tycoon Robert (Jared Troilo).\n\nTroilo is completely charismatic as the dashing, the occasionally goofy and, above all else, the scenery-chewing Robert.\n\nOne of the fascinating aspects of the show is in how the Man in the Chair describes not only the show’s premise but also providing us a few gossipy background notes on each of the actors who appear on the “cast recording” being played.\n\nWhile we, the audience, are focused primarily on the \"CHAPERONE\" fictitious story and characters, this ingenious dichotomy added an additional layer for the actual Lyric Stage actors with which to approach their characters.\n\nIn the high octane two-man tapper, “Cold Feet” Robert teams up with Robert’s Best Man, George (Mark Linehan) for the highly entertaining number.\n\nTroilo was equally skilled at the roller skating required in the later number “Accident Waiting to Happen.” Janet is the star attraction for \"Feldzieg's Follies\" with harried producer, Mr. Feldzieg (Damon Singletary).\n\nKristian Espiritu was hilarious as “Kitty,” the ditzy \"wanna-be-star\" girlfriend of Feldzieg.\n\nFeldzieg is threatened by two gangsters disguised as pastry chefs, played equally and fabulously comical by the team of Ilyse Robbins and Kathy St. George.\n\nThe two actors, along with Cristhian Mancinas-Garcia as lothario Aldolpho provide for some of the shows’ biggest laughs and scene stealing moments.\n\n(Photo: Paul Melendy as “Man in Chair” observing Cristhian Mancinas-Garcia as “Aldolpho” and Damon Singletary as “Feldzieg” hatching a plot in the musical \"THE DROWSY CHAPERONE\" by Lisa Lambert, Greg Morrison, Bob Martin and Don McKellar, now playing at theLyric Stage in Boston, MA. until May 12, 2024. Photo Credit Mark S. Howard)\n\nIn an intentionally upstaging role is \"THE DROWSY CHAPERONE\" herself, played by the terrific Maureen Keiller.\n\nHer rousing number “As We Stumble Along” was milked for all it was worth and the audience appreciated it in kind, as ludicrous as it was.\n\nCarolyn Saxon portrays the absentminded “Mrs. Tottendale” who both amuses and aggravates her long-suffering man servant, Underling (Todd Yard).\n\nThe above duo has great chemistry during their all-too-brief scenes together and especially during their 'lovely' duet, “Love is Always Lovely.”\n\nWith perhaps the obvious and intentional exception of the Man in Chair’s sweater, the costumes for \"CHAPERONE\" by Seth Bodie were thoroughly resplendent at times and perfectly in tune with the heightened jubilant spirit of the show.\n\n(Photo:Mark Linehan as “George” andJared Troilo as “Robert Martin” in a scene from the musical \"THE DROWSY CHAPERONE\" by Lisa Lambert, Greg Morrison, Bob Martin and Don McKellar, now playing at theLyric Stage in Boston, MA. until May 12, 2024. Photo Credit Mark S. Howard)\n\nThe entire production is wonderfully staged and choreographed by director Larry Sousa with the live orchestra and entire cast guided by music director Matthew Stern.\n\nThis is easily one of the most clever, most energetic and most enjoyable musicals presented this entire season.\n\nAs mentioned, part of the enjoyment of watching \"THE DROWSY CHAPERONE\" is seeing how the cast appears to be having just as good a time as the audience, and most of the musical numbers reflect this.\n\nAmong the musical highlights included are the absurd and hysterically funny “Bride's Lament,” \"I Do, I Do in the Sky\" and “Toledo Surprise.”\n\nWith an impressive set design, fabulous costumes, and casting perfection, \"THE DROWSY CHAPERONE\" is a musical well worth seeing...especially if you're feeling a little blue.\n\nComing up next at the Lyric Stage Company in May, 2024 will be \"YELLOW FACE\" by David Henry Hwang beginning May 31st and running through June 23rd.\n\nFor more information or tickets, contact the Lyric Stage Box Office at # 617-585-5678 or go to lyricstage.com\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\nApproximately 90 minutes with no intermission\n\nKevin T. Baldwin is a member of the American Theatre Critics Association (ATCA)\n\n@MetrmagReviews\n\n@Theatre_Critics\n\nABOUT THE SHOW\n\nA refreshing musical cocktail that’s like a bubble bath for your heart.\n\nBut with tap dancing.\n\nAnd spit takes.\n\nA comfortable chair with an old record crackling away is the perfect cure for the “blues” for a charming but lonely “Man in Chair”, our guide into the world of the show-within-a-show, \"THE DROWSY CHAPERONE.\"\n\nHis favorite cast album from the Jazz Age comes to fizzy life complete with a self-admiring showgirl, her gin-soaked chaperone, a saucy Latin lover, a bumbling best man, a clueless soon-to-be groom, and a cornucopia of characters from a befuddled producer, to a dippy hostess and gangsters posing as pastry chefs.\n\nThis bubbly love letter to musical theater sparkles with one show-stopper after another, mix-ups, mayhem, and a wedding (or two).\n\nABOUT THE LYRIC STAGE OF BOSTON\n\nFounded in 1974 and in residence at 140 Clarendon Street since 1991, THE LYRIC STAGE OF BOSTON is Boston’s oldest resident theatre company.
