        "text": "Show: The Drowsy Chaperone\n\nVenue: Institute of the Arts, Barcelona\n\nTimes: 17th, 18th & 19th November 2016 at 16:30 & 20:00\n\nPrice: 5€ Adults, 3€ Children (under 18’s)\n\nPurchase tickets at: https://iab.entradium.com\n\nThe Institute of the Arts Barcelona presents the first 3rd year Musical Theatre show, A Musical within a Comedy, The Drowsy Chaperone, Music and Lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, and Book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar. The IAB Production is directed by Luke Fredericks, musically directed by Alex Weatherhill and choreographed by Robert Foley.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe plot of the show-within-a-show centres on Miss Janet Van De Graaff, a showgirl who plans to give up her fabulous career in order to marry an oil tycoon, Mr Robert Martin. However, the Feldzieg’s Follies star Janet has a lot of money riding on her name to sell the show; and Feldzieg, her producer, is being threatened by two ‘Pastry Chef’ gangsters employed by her chief investor to put a stop to the wedding or else….\n\nIn order to save herself, Feldzieg employs Aldolpho, a bumbling Latin Lothario, in hope to seduce Janet and stop her marrying Robert. Meanwhile Janet is having major doubts about marrying Robert after tricking him into kissing her disguised as Mimi the French girl, and a massive misunderstanding emerges putting the wedding on a hold.\n\nThat’s when all starts to get a little crazy and the plot is filled with mistaken identities, dream sequences, big dance numbers, spit takes and of course the incredibly graceful yet drunk Drowsy Chaperone upstaging near about everyone on stage.\n\nWatching from the comfort of her own room the woman in chair brings the audience in and out of reality commentating on the show appearing in front of her. As the show goes on, more and more of her personal life is revealed, until, as the record ends, she is left again alone in her apartment — but still with her imagination of her long-beloved record of the show to turn to whenever she’s feeling a little blue.\n\nQuotes:\n\nAlex Weatherhill says a few words about musically directing Drowsy Chaperone:\n\n“Working with new people is always exciting and challenging and my projects with the students of IAB have been just that. The journey with them has been great fun and they consistently work hard to bring their best and beyond.”\n\nRobert Foley talks about his vision of the show as the choreographer:\n\n“I have really enjoyed working with cast investigating their characters to find authentic and original movements for them to hit the stage with. I think the choreography is fun and exciting and really brings life to this show.”\n\nCourtney Griffiths, a member of ensemble says\n\n“I honestly couldn’t be more proud of my fellow cast members and even though I won’t get the chance to perform on stage with them due to injury; I will be sat front row supporting them all the way for every show. We have all worked so incredibly hard on this show, including awesome creative team and they all deserve their time to shine. So let’s go team and show everyone who IAB is! ”\n\nFor information go to https://www.iabarcelona.com/student-shows/\n\nLisa Lambert\n\nLisa Lambert is an actress, comedy writer and Tony Award-winning composer, best known for writing the lyrics and music to The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nLambert plyed in the movies Childstar and Slings and Arrows.

Students from all over the world benefit from our top-level professional teaching staff and UK university validated education in a stunning location on the shores of the Mediterranean. Their rigorous, interdisciplinary and transformative programmes are specially designed to provide an intensive and well-rounded vocational education. They offer 1-year Foundation Certificates, 3 year BA (Hons) and 1 year MA Degrees in a variety of performing and recording arts disciplines.\n\nHome\n\nAbout the BA (Hons) Musical Theatre Degree\n\nThe BA (Hons) Programme in Musical Theatre is designed for individuals who wish to undergo a highly vocational and professional training and education for a career in musical theatre.\n\nThe programme is designed for individuals with passion, creativity, imagination and a real commitment to gaining and sustaining a lasting career as a musical theatre performer. The programme provides performers with the opportunity to develop as a creative artist able to work and thrive in multiple contexts and environments.\n\nThe Musical Theatre programme aims to create a performer capable of working across a range of acting, dance and musical theatre styles and disciplines. The programme does not dictate a particular approach to performance, but rather, it gives you the opportunity to develop as an independent minded creative practitioner with your own relationship to performance.\n\nThere are two routes through the BA Musical Theatre at the IAB, both providing a comprehensive training for musical theatre. The first has a full focus on the triple threat – Acting, Dance and Singing. This route has a substantial dance component and would be suitable for those with a strong background in dance. The second also explores the three component areas of Musical Theatre – Acting, Dance and Singing but with a greater emphasis on Singing and a lesser focus on dance. This programme would suit those with a more limited dance background (dance is still important) or those who would like a more intensive singing training."
