        "text": "Winner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, The Drowsy Chaperone is a loving send-up of the Golden Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another.\n\nWith the houselights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.\n\nHailed by New York Magazine as \"The Perfect Broadway Musical,\"The Drowsy Chaperone is a masterful meta-musical, poking fun at all the tropes that characterize the musical theatre genre. Because of its many featured roles and accessible script, The Drowsy Chaperone will fit perfectly into any company's season or school's calendar.\n\nSource: Mtishows.com\n\nðŸŒŸ Mark your calendars! ðŸ—“ We're counting down the days until our production\n\nand adjudication by @SLHSMTA â€“ a celebration of talent and creativity! Our\n\nstudents are working tirelessly to bring you an unforgettable show. Stay\n\nconnected with us for behind-the-scenes glimpses and sneak peeks! ðŸŽ¬âœ¨\n\n#SLHSMTA #MusicalTheatreExcellence #CountdownBegins\n\nWhat does being in Troupe 1109 mean?\n\nAs a troupe, we do all sorts of activities throughout the year, from community service to movie nights to bonfires. We work to spread theatre throughout the community and support fellow high schools in their theatre endeavors. We also attend the Missouri Thespian Conference each year (check our Instagram highlights for, well, the highlights!) and while you don't have to be in the troupe to go, being a member gives the student access to auditions, competitions, and other benefits. To be an active member of the troupe, the student must participate in at least two productions a year and go to troupe events. The ITS troupe is a great way to spend time with other theatre members and have fun!\n\nfollow us on Instagram, @ladue.thespians!!"
