        "text": "The cast has been announced for the upcoming production of the musical comedy “The Drowsy Chaperone,” directed by Brandon Chaloux, at the Community Little Theatre in Auburn. The cast is, standing from left, Joseph Tinianow, Hannah Hanson, Scotty Venable, Abram Dwyer, Ray Woodworth, Kristen Gilhooly, Casey Waters, Meg Walz, Jonathan Carr, Anita Charles, and Tony Roy; and, kneeling from left, Sophia Wood, Ansley Watson, Kathryn Kellogg, Karianna Merrill, and Julie Sanborn. Not pictured: Zack Balkcom, Leslie Reed, and Justin Morin.\n\nA middle-aged, musical theater fan decides to play for the audience an LP of his favorite musical, the fictional 1928 show “The Drowsy Chaperone.” As the record plays, the show – a parody of 1920s musical comedy – comes to life onstage as a loving send-up of the Jazz Age musical. Winner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, “The Drowsy Chaperone” was hailed by New York Magazine as “the perfect Broadway musical.”\n\nA volunteer, non-profit organization, CLT has produced live theatre since 1940 with the goal to provide affordable and quality entertainment in the performing arts as well as education, training, and experience in theatre for area youth.\n\nPerformances will be held at 7:30 p.m. on Oct 27 and 28 and Nov. 2 and 3; and at 2 p.m. on Oct. 29 and Nov. 4 and 5. Season subscriptions and individual tickets are now available online at laclt.com/box-office.\n\nCommunity Little Theatre is located at 30 Academy St., Auburn.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under:"
