        "text": "The Drowsy Chaperone plays its final performance on Broadway on 30 Dec 2007, the show had been selling tickets through to 15 Jun 2008. When the show closes it will have played 32 previews and 674 regular performances.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone opened at the Marquis Theatre on the 1 May 2006, following previews from the 3 Apr 2006.\n\nTo chase his blues away, a modern day musical theatre addict known simply as 'Man in Chair' (Bob Martin) drops the needle on his favorite LP ï¿½ the 1928 musical comedy The Drowsy Chaperone. From the crackle of his hi-fi, the musical magically bursts to life on stage, telling the tale of a pampered Broadway starlet who wants to give up show business to get married, her producer who sets out to sabotage the nuptials, her chaperone, the debonair groom, the dizzy chorine, the Latin lover and a pair of gangsters who double as pastry chefs.\n\nThe musical opened to mixed reviews; \"Small and ingratiating musical\" (The New York Times); \"Little, horrifyingly pastiche musical.\" (New York Post); \"The happiest surprise of the Broadway seasonï¿½ (The Hollywood Reporter); \"A disarming, delightful soufflï¿½ .\" (The Associated Press); \"I was delighted to be outside in fresh air.\" (New York Theatre Guide)\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone won five 2006 Tony Awards, seven Drama Desk Awards and four Outer Critics Circle Awards.\n\nThe show features: Danny Burstein (Adolpho), Cindy Williams (Mrs Tottendale), Mara Davi, Bob Saget (Man in Chair), Peter Bartlett (Underling), Troy Britton Johnson (Robert Martin), Patrick Wetzel (George), Garth Kravits (Gangster 2), Jason Kravits (Gangster 1), Beth Leavel (The Drowsy Chaperone), Kecia Lewis-Evans (Trix), Jennifer Smith (Kitty) and Gerry Vichi (Feldzieg).\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone features Music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison and a book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar. The production is directed and choregraphed by Casey Nicholaw.\n\nSet design is by David Gallo, with costumes by Gregg Barnes, lighting by Ken Billington and Brian Monahan and sound by Acme Sound Partners."
