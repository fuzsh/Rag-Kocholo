        "text": "“The Drowsy Chaperone” and “Spring Awakening” — two musicals that may never be mentioned in the same breath again — are on the fast-track to major productions.\n\nDespite their similar title-play on human consciousness, no two shows could be more different.\n\nThe first is a frothy homage to 1920s musicals; the other is a contempo rock adaptation of one of literature’s darkest, most controversial plays. And yet, toss them together, and they prove that after talent and money, the most important ingredient for getting a musical produced is patience.\n\nFortunately for their respective creative teams, the waiting has paid off and each show is in the midst of giant steps forward.\n\nLast week, Michael Mayer, Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater got word that their long-delayed musical version of Frank Wedekind’s classic drama of adolescent angst, “Spring Awakening,” had secured its world-preem berth, in June 2006 at the Atlantic Theater Company in New York.\n\nNext week, “Monty Python’s Spamalot” choreographer Casey Nicholaw makes his directorial debut with a private reading of “The Drowsy Chaperone,” which begins perfs Nov. 8 at L.A.’s Ahmanson Theater. If that engagement turns out to be a sleeper, commercial producers Kevin McCollum (“Rent”) and Roy Miller have their eye on Broadway in 2006.\n\nUnlike “Spring Awakening,” which had all the buzz before falling victim to 9/11 belt-tightening, “Chaperone” began quietly, seven years ago this month, at a stag party for Second City’s Bob Martin. He was getting married, and his friends Greg Morrison and Lisa Lambert had written a collection of songs, called “The Wedding Gift,” for his bachelor send-off.\n\nBeing songwriters, they immediately saw a musical in their material and brought on Martin and screenwriter Don McKellar (“The Red Violin”) to fashion a book about a contempo fan of 1920s musicals, including one about a wedding party, called “The Drowsy Chaperone.” Even the real-life bride, Janet Van de Graaff, came aboard as producer to stage the show at Toronto’s Fringe Fest. Pricetag: $2,000.\n\nFrom there, David and Ed Mirvish took interest, and a $200,000 production at the Passe Muraille blossomed into a $1 million show at their Winter Garden Theater in Toronto, in 2001.\n\n“The initial impulse was a pure love of musicals from that period,” says Martin. “It is not a parody, it is an homage.”\n\nThere isn’t much precedence for Canadian-born tuners traveling south. The ill-fated “Rockabye Hamlet,” which started on the CBC, is the most recent example of a Canuck tuner on Broadway. It lasted exactly seven perfs after opening in 1976.\n\nDespite the odds, producer Roy Miller presented a 45-minute version of “Chaperone” at the National Alliance for Musical Theater in Gotham last fall. Auds fell hard for “Drowsy,” and so did “Rent” producer Kevin McCollum, who immediately joined with Miller.\n\nWilliamstown’s then-artistic director, Michael Ritchie, had considered the show for the Massachusetts summer festival, but when the fates subsequently took him to L.A.’s Center Theater Group, “Chaperone” miraculously found itself worthy of the 2,000-seat Ahmanson Theater.\n\n“According to our surveys,” says Ritchie, “our audiences travel a lot to New York, and want to see shows prior to, not after, Broadway.” He calls “Chaperone” a test, but quickly adds, “Expect more in the future.”\n\nMeanwhile, the “Chaperone” creative team has continued to retool, but their biggest leap forward comes next week with Nicholaw’s new, first take on their material. He initially met with the creatives the day after “Spamalot” opened on Broadway.\n\n“Casey was on such a high,” Martin recalls. “We’ve never really had any dance in the show. Now we will. It’s a big step.”\n\nWhether Nicholaw can make the tuner dance all the way to Broadway depends on the Ahmanson incarnation. Regarding that next move forward, the potential Broadway producers demur. “We hold the commercial option,” says McCollum.\n\nA re-“Awakening”\n\nIf “The Drowsy Chaperone” sounds like a brand-new title to Gotham ears, “Spring Awakening” has been threatening to be the town’s hippest tuner for at least four years. Buzz-generating workshops at La Jolla Playhouse, Sundance and then the Roundabout Theater Company in 2001 led to talk of a Gotham staging, but RTC opted against such an edgy show in the wake of 9/11. (“Assassins” was another casualty that was only later resurrected.)\n\nUnlike Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman, who ultimately got their Broadway production, Sheik, Sater and Mayer had to play the long waiting game. But then, so did Wedekind, who wrote “Spring Awakening” in 1891 and didn’t see it produced until 1906, in Berlin. Even then, his drama about 14-year-old lovers who endure parental disapproval, abortion and death invoked the wrath of the German censors. “Spring Awakening” was not produced again until 1963, in Britain.\n\nFortunately, the play’s musical version was performed in its creators’ lifetime. On Feb. 2, Lincoln Center’s American Songbook series held a concert performance that sparked interest in the long-gestating project.\n\n“That performance had a huge impact,” Mayer says. “It renewed interest in the piece, and people understood that the Roundabout was no longer attached.”\n\nIn his Daily Variety review of “Spring Awakening,” David Rooney wrote, “This unsettlingly beautiful work might be the most dynamic pairing of musical theater with a contemporary rock song score since ‘Rent.’ ”\n\nSater says “Spring Awakening” has evolved since its 2001 workshops. “This show began in the wake of Columbine, and what then happened with youth,” he recalls. “Since then, 9/11 has affected us. Our feelings about the world have darkened and deepened.”"
