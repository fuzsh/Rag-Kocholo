        "text": "Hey sista, go sista, soul sista, flow sista... the doors to the Moulin Rouge are finally open. Ever since Baz Luhrmann's iconic 2001 film graced the silver screen, Broadway fans have been begging and pleading for a stage adaptation and they need neither beg nor plead any longer. Moulin Rouge! The Musical has evolved from a Broadway fanatic's fantasy to a fantastical reality. Following the much publicised pre-Broadway try-out in Boston in the summer of 2018, re-opening the grand Emerson Colonial Theatre and playing an extended, sold-out engagement from July 10 through August 19, the production set its sights on New York City. Previews began at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre on June 28, 2019, ahead of an official opening on July 25.\n\nFind out more about Moulin Rouge! The Musical on Broadway below.\n\nGet Moulin Rouge! The Musical tickets now.\n\nWhat's the story of Moulin Rouge: The Musical?\n\nMoulin Rouge! The Musical is set in the bohemian mecca of Montmartre in Paris, France during a period called La Belle Ã‰poque at the turn of the twentieth century. The story follows an aspiring American writer and composer named Christian, who has landed in Paris in search of inspiration. He finds it in the form of Satine, a beautiful courtesan, working as \"the sparkling diamond\" of the infamous nightclub, the Moulin Rouge.\n\nTheir blossoming romance is forced behind closed doors to become a secret love affair, as the club's Master of Ceremonies, Harold Zidler, promises Satine to the rich, jealous and controlling Duke of Monroth in return for saving the Moulin Rouge from financial ruin and investing in a new show, penned by Christian alongside his new friend and artist, Toulouse-Lautrec. But Satine is also harbouring another secret that threatens to cut short the pair's bohemian ideals of truth, beauty, freedom, and love.\n\nMoulin Rouge! The Musical features a book by John Logan, whose previous Broadway credits include the widely acclaimed Red and Sting's The Last Ship.\n\nWho was in the original cast of Moulin Rouge: The Musical on Broadway?\n\nAaron Tveit originated the role of Christian, handsome and vulnerable in equal measures. Broadway fans will certainly know him from his starring turns in Next to Normal and Catch Me If You Can, as well as his portrayal of Danny Zuko on Fox's hugely successful \"Grease Live!\" Tony Award winner Karen Olivo originated the role of Satine. She previously wowed Broadway fans in the likes of Lin-Manuel Miranda's In the Heights and the 2009 revival of West Side Story.\n\nSix-time Tony Award nominee Danny Burstein originated the role of Harold Zidler with a flamboyant and wickedly enticing portrayal. His Tony-nominated turns include Fiddler on the Roof, Cabaret, Golden Boy, Follies, South Pacific, and The Drowsy Chaperone. Rounding out the principal cast are Tony Award nominee Sahr Ngaujah as Toulouse-Lautrec, Tam Mutu as The Duke of Monroth, Ricky Rojas as Santiago and Robyn Hurder as Nini.\n\nWhy should I see Moulin Rouge: The Musical on Broadway?\n\nIn a five star review of Moulin Rouge! The Musical for New York Theatre Guide, \"Moulin Rouge is a show that has it all: it's not just 70 songs that are rolled into one show, but also a canvas of spectacle and emotion that isn't just a floorshow but left me floored with its sublime artistry.\"\n\nArrive early and soak up the atmosphere in the auditorium as creatures of the underworld prowl the stage to modern beats, long before the opening number. And speaking of the stage, designer Derek McLane has really outdone himself in terms of the lavish sets both inside and outside of the Moulin Rouge club, making full use of the undoubtedly, exceedingly high budget for the production. Justin Townsend's dazzling lighting effects and Catherine Zuber's exquisite costumes make this show a true feast for the senses, whilst choreographer Sonya Tayeh's ecstatic dance numbers leave the audience breathless, let alone the talented, ample-flesh-baring ensemble.\n\nMusical numbers from the 2001 film have been preserved, but theatregoers can also look forward to new mash-ups and fitting renditions of songs from the past 18 years since the movie's release. An onslaught of popular hits from the likes of Lady Gaga, P!nk, Adele, Katy Perry, Britney Spears and Sia are cleverly woven into the narrative and although some song choices may raise a tongue-in-cheek chuckle from the audience at times, those cynics are clearly won over by the end of the number, judging by the tumultuous reactions. Simply put, there has never been anything on Broadway that quite lives up to the spectacle of Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\n\nWho would we recommend Moulin Rouge: The Musical to?\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Al Hirschfeld Theatre is adult, sensual, classy and sexually-charged. Characters are all scantily clad and there are scenes of a mild sexual nature to boot. It's the perfect choice for a date night or even a honeymoon destination and if you like your theatre extravagant, loud and pulsating with seduction, then you \"can-can\" trust us, when we say Moulin Rouge! The Musical is right up your Parisian street.\n\nGet Moulin Rouge! The Musical tickets now.\n\n(Photos by Matthew Murphy)"
