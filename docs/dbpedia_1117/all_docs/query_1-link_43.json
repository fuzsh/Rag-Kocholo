        "text": "Today’s theatergoers may forget about the wonder behind a great theater production, but the First Year Player’s production of ‘The Drowsy Chaperone’ reminded Syracuse University that the stage can still act as a portal into another world.\n\nWith a wonderfully silly script, moments of spectacular stage direction and audacious stage numbers, the final result is a delightful celebration of life onstage. Directed by senior television, radio and film major Nick Deyo, the musical ran from April 12-14 in Goldstein Auditorium, marking the organization’s 20th production.\n\nThe plot focused on an old man, named the Man in the Chair, who loves musical theater and wants to share his passion with the audience. He plays a record of his favorite show, called ‘The Drowsy Chaperone,’ the tale of a Broadway star feeling doubtful about ending her career for marriage while her producer seeks to end her marriage to save his own career.\n\nThe old man’s insightful and humorous narration drives the productions as the story came to life onstage, its emotional power amplified by the show-within-a-show element. His commentary reveals many nuanced stage secrets while he also deals with real-life elements, such as ringing phones. This fascinating angle keeps the play interesting, clever and fun to watch.\n\nThe musical numbers were well organized and entertaining. Each duet had charming chemistry, and every ensemble performance showcased strong, complex choreography. The music from the live orchestra pit suited the mood of each number, but often drowned out the characters’ lines and made the play difficult to follow. And while every number was strong, none truly stood out from all the others.\n\nThe actor driving the entire show was the Man in the Chair, played by Matt Fernandes, a freshman English and textual studies major. Onstage constantly, he never broke character as an amiable, honest and occasionally quite emotional old man.\n\nPlenty of other standouts in the well-balanced cast drew laughs from the audience with their quirkiness. Nick Padula, a freshman film major,and Drew Muller, a freshman advertising major and a staff writer at The Daily Orange, played a pair of wisecracking gangsters disguised as pastry chefs who entertained with goofy accents and dessert-based puns.\n\nAnother stellar duo included Will McDonald, a freshman television, radio and film major, and Sarah Bogden, an undecided sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences. McDonald played Feldzieg, a stern producer, while Bogden took on the character of Kitty, a nave dancer hoping to be the star of his next production. Their characters contrasted in intelligence and played off each other with enthusiasm and commitment.\n\nFaking intoxication, McCauley Braun, an undecided freshman in the College of Visual and Performing Arts, played the Drowsy Chaperone, the often drunk yet cheerful older woman tasked with keeping the bride and groom apart before the wedding ceremony. Her performance was playful and lighthearted.\n\nAnother scene-stealer was Carlos Cervantes, an undecided freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences. As the villain Adolpho,a womanizing, egocentric European asked to break up the upcoming marriage, Cervantes outshined most actors onstage with his minor yet hilarious role. Whenever he introduced himself, he planted his cane on the ground and flourished his cape.\n\nThe stage, a rich widow’s mansion coupled with a small section of the old man’s apartment, was deceptively simple. Several hidden touches kept things fresh and captured the scenes’ different tones, like one capturing a character’s near-mental breakdown with mirrors and smoke. Lighting was an especially strong tool, capturing the shifts between the world of the musical and the Man in the Chair’s apartment swiftly so that the audience never lost track of the play’s brisk pace.\n\n‘The Drowsy Chaperone’ is a simple tale about the volatility of love, and it never takes itself too seriously. As the time for the wedding gets closer and each characters deals with internal struggles, they gradually have revelations about their true feelings in different ways. The play offers a goofy yet heartwarming look at the reasons why people fall in love.\n\nThis was an ambitious play from the First Year Players, but they still succeeded in putting forth a hilarious, quirky and energetic production to satisfy every viewer. The Man in the Chair certainly accomplished his goal of having people in today’s world appreciate the touch of magic of stage productions.\n\n[email protected]"
