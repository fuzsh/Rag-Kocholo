        "text": "Complete casting has been set for the pre-Broadway tryout of The Drowsy Chaperone at Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theatre. Danny Burstein, Linda Griffin, Edward Hibbert, Troy Britton Johnson, Eddie Korbich, Garth Kravits, Jason Kravits, Beth Leavel, Kecia Lewis-Evans, Bob Martin, Angela Pupello, Jennifer Smith, Joey Sorge, Patrick Wetzel and Lenny Wolpe will join previously announced stars Sutton Foster and Georgia Engel.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw Tony-nominated for his choreography of Spamalot, The Drowsy Chaperone is a love letter to the extravagant musicals of the 1920s. It offers the audience the chance to see one of those \"lost\" musicals through the eyes of one fan with an almost omniscient knowledge of the play and players. The show features a book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, music by Greg Morrison and lyrics by Lisa Lambert.\n\nBurstein's Broadway credits include The Seagull, Three Men on a Horse, The Flowering Peach, Company, Titanic and A Class Act. Griffin has appeared on the Great White Way in Purlie, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and Jesus Christ Superstar. Hibbert's Broadway credits include Alice in Wonderland, Me and My Girl, Marlene, The Green Bird and Noises Off. Johnson recently appeared in the Hairspray tour. Korbich appeared on Broadway earlier this season in After the Night and the Music. Garth Kravits appeared last month at the O'Neill Theater in Connecticut in Pure Heaven: The Music of Kay Thompson. Jason Kravitz appeared in Sly Fox on the Great White Way. Leavel is best known for her performances in 42nd Street and Lone Star Love. Lewis-Evans received a Drama Desk nomination this year for her performance in Dessa Rose. Martin co-wrote The Drowsy Chaperone and did vocal arrangements on the Broadway musical High Button Shoes. Pupello's Broadway credits include Saturday Night Fever and Grease. Smith's Broadway credits include The Secret Garden, Once Upon a Mattress, The Scarlet Pimpernel, High Society and The Producers. Sorge notably played Young Buddy in the 2001 revival of Follies. Wetzel has appeared on the Great White Way in Ain't Broadway Grand, Annie Get Your Gun and Thou Shalt Not. Wolpe's Broadway credits include Onward Victoria, Copperfield, Mayor, Into the Light and The Sound of Music."
