        "text": "The Workhouse Arts Center is now presenting “The Drowsy Chaperone,” a nostalgic musical that features new songs in 1920’s style with panache. Directed by Frank Shutts, the show is a play-within-a-play; a lone enthusiast of the American musical theatre, called simply the Man in Chair (played convincingly by Jeffrey Davis), plays a record on his hi-fi of a fictitious 1920s musical comedy, “The Drowsy Chaperone.” He has never seen the show in person, so we the audience see the musical as he imagines it, brought to life on stage by the other actors in the show. This musical seen through the Man in Chair’s mind’s eye has a humorous plot: Janet, a singer, is planning to marry a young man named Robert. A chaperone is charged with ensuring that Janet and Robert do not meet before the wedding. This chaperone, however, is “drowsy,” which turns out to be a euphemism for intoxicated.\n\nWhat is special about “The Drowsy Chaperone” is that it is an homage to the 1920s while also gently satirizing both the 1920s as well as musicals in general. The play also reminds us of how people experienced Broadway shows in earlier times; often they were unable to attend the shows in person, and home videos did not exist. The only way to experience the show would be vicariously through phonograph records, with the remainder of the details of the show imagined. While recorded audio has existed only since the late 1800s, “The Drowsy Chaperone’s” motif of a play-within-a-play is at least as old as Shakespeare.\n\nThe show is sung and danced by a cast brimming with enthusiasm. “Cold Feet” is a fun number in which would-be groom Robert (Noah Mutterperl) and best man George (Luke Martin) express their nervousness about the upcoming marriage through tap dance, an ironic combination of cold and hot feet! Both actors perform this dance number admirably. Later Mr. Mutterperl delights by rolling across the stage on skates while blindfolded as he performs the appropriately titled “Accident Waiting to Happen.” “Toledo Surprise” is also quite amusing, performed by two gangsters (excellently played by Darren Badley and Kevin Donlan) who use food metaphors to describe their dastardly plans.\n\nThe character of Aldolfo (wonderfully portrayed by Shakil Azizi) riffs off of the Latin Lover stereotype. He literally sweeps the Drowsy Chaperone (a charismatic Kristina Friedgen) off her feet in their fine song duet “Aldolfo.” She also sings “As We Stumble Along” with great showmanship. “Show Off” is another standout number. It is done in an ironically showy way by Odette Gutierrez del Arroyo as Janet Van de Graaf, who performs cartwheels and sings with an impressive vocal range even as her character claims: “I don’t want to show off no more!”\n\nTrix the Aviatrix is played by Ariel Friendly, who trots out the role of the deus ex machina for a key scene in a highly flamboyant way. Steve Cairns as Feldzieg (a parody of the real life Flo Ziegfeld) and Claire Jeffrey as Kitty have very good chemistry together as a Broadway impresario and his dizzy protégé.\n\nMusic director Francine Krasowska conducts superbly an excellent group of musicians who channel the sound of a 1920s band. The choreography by Stefan Sittig (and assistant choreographer/fight director Ariel Kraje) is similarly first-rate. Costumes complete the 1920s atmosphere, and the set device of characters emerging for their numbers through the Man in Chair’s refrigerator is clever. The cast exudes enthusiasm throughout the performance, and this enthusiasm is infectious to the audience. The show is, in short, one of the most entertaining productions of “The Drowsy Chaperone” that this reviewer has seen. This staging of “Chaperone” is being performed at the Workhouse Arts Center at 9518 Workhouse Way, Lorton, VA 22079 through June 23.
