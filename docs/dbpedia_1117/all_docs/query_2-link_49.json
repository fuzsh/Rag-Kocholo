        "text": "Back in 2006 my aunt Kate was living in New York City so you can bet I took the chance to not only see her but to visit and see as many Broadway shows as possible. One that I saw a preview for on that trip was The Drowsy Chaperone. This hilarious and sweet take on the classic musicals went on to win 5 Tony Awards and I have now seen it many times including the current production at one of my favorite theaters the Pleasant Grove Players. As is always the case with PGP this is a wonderful night of theater that I highly recommend especially for big musical theater fans.\n\nThis production is directed by Howard and Kathryn Little who are the best directors working in the state. They know how to get the best performances out of their casts and make the best use of their very small PGP stage (it’s in the Pleasant Grove Library.)\n\nThe lead for the show is called Man in Chair and is played by Jeff Thompson. His take on the character was a little more sweet and energetic than I have seen before. Some productions really lean into the cynical moments but this was a bubbly and pretty happy version of the character. I also enjoyed the entire ensemble with Ethan Kelso and Laura Jacobs doing professional calaber work as Robert Martin and Janet Van De Graff respectively.\n\nThe choreography by Brodee Ripple stood out especially in scenes where nearly the entire cast is singing and dancing on the once again small stage. I particularly liked the “Bride’s Lament” with Janet having a “complete mental breakdown” as she dances with actors in monkey costumes and bemoans her lost love. It is a very funny scene and Jacobs is up for the physical comedy. Kelso also nails the goofy sensibility of “Accident Waiting to Happen” on roller-skates.\n\nThis is the first time I have seen The Drowsy Chaperone without “Message from a Nightingale” which is a parody of The King and I. I personally find the scene funny as it is mocking the racism of musicals of the past but I have heard it falls flat for many so fair enough MTI saw to remove it.\n\nOn a similar note this production did not have a person of color playing the Aviatrix. I know it can be difficult when nobody auditions for certain roles but it would have been nice and a more biting piece of satire if that role was cast differently. In the show Man in Chair describes the musical as progressive for the time because the Aviatrix. This is ironic because she literally has one song at the end. That’s what makes it funny- what scraps were often seen as progressive.\n\nThe only other critique I’d have is they could have used the apartment more in the storytelling. I know it’s a small space but one of the fun things about the musical is the actors use the apartment to tell the story. People come out of fridges and ovens and in this version there is a bookcase instead of a door and they get the skates out of the oven. They could have done more with that.\n\nSmall quips aside what a funny, sweet, endearing night of theatre. The Drowsy Chaperone at PG Players is definitely worth your time and at only $15 for adults it’s a bargain. The space is small so get your tickets now. It plays through May 13th and tickets can be purchased here."
