        "text": "In the fall of 2015, artistic director Jon Rosen got involved with a newly emerging theater venue in San Francisco, the Great Star Theatre in Chinatown. Originally a Chinese opera house in the 1920s, it spent many years as a movie theater showing Hong Kong \"action\" genre films. After being closed for a number of years, it reopened in 2015 as a place for performances of a slightly off-beat nature.\n\nJon's involvement with the venue led to an offer to stage the first Broadway musical ever produced on that stage. And that led Landmark Musicals to its second production, the Bay area premiere of the hit Broadway musical The Boy From Oz, a story about Peter Allen, the famed songwriter, showman and one-time husband to Liza Minelli (and son-in-law to Judy Garland). The show ran at the Great Star from April 23 to May 15, 2016.\n\nSince then, we have had five more seasons with many successful productions.\n\n2017\n\n\"Stand well back we're coming through, nothing can stop us now!\"\n\nRoar of the Greasepaint, The Smell of the Crowd (original Broadway production 1966)\n\n\"Give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair, shining, steaming, gleaming flaxen waxen!\"\n\nHAiR (original Broadway production 1968)\n\n2018\n\n\"Try to remember the kind of September when life was slow and oh so mellow...\"\n\nThe Fantasticks (original off-Broadway production 1960)\n\n\"All the world seems in tune on a spring afternoon when we're poisoning pigeons in the park!\"\n\nTomfoolery (original off-Broadway production 1984)\n\n2019\n\n\"Don't cry for me, Argentina... the truth is I never left you!\"\n\nEvita (original Broadway production 1979)\n\n\"As we stumble along on life's dreary highway, never knowing left from right or right from wrong!\"\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone (original Broadway production 2006)\n\n2020\n\n(cut short by the Covid-19 pandemic)\n\n\"It's a hard, cold, tumble of a journey, bumble of a journey to Urinetown!\"\n\nUrinetown the Musical (original Broadway production 2001)\n\n2021\n\n\"Woe is me, woe is me, which is why I've gotta win this spelling bee!\"\n\n25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee (original Broadway production 2005)\n\n2022\n\n\"Happiness is finding a pencil, pizza with sausage, telling the time!\"\n\nYou're A Good Man, Charlie Brown (original off-Broadway production 1967)\n\n\"Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes, how do you measure a year in a life.
