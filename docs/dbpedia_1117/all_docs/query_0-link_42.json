        "text": "Expect to be wide awake for the Lake Worth Playhouse’s production of “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nIn the show, which opens in a preview performance Jan. 17, a musical comes to life when a die-hard, musical-theater fan plays his favorite album on his turntable, and tells the story of a brazen Broadway starlet trying to find her true love.\n\nBefore coming to the playhouse, a community theater, “The Drowsy Chaperone” had its start in 1997, when Don McKellar, Lisa Lambert, Greg Morrison and several friends created a spoof of old musicals for the stag party of Bob Martin and Janet Van De Graaff. In its first incarnation, there was no Man in Chair, the musical styles ranged from the 1920s to the 1940s and the jokes were more risqué. When the show was reshaped for the Toronto Fringe Festival, Mr. Martin became a co-writer, creating Man in Chair to serve as a narrator/ commentator for the piece.\n\nFollowing the Fringe staging, Toronto commercial theatre producer David Mirvish financed an expanded production at Toronto’s 160-seat, nonprofit Theatre Passe Muraille in 1999. Box office success and favorable notices led Mr. Mirvish in 2001 to finance further development and produce a full-scale version at Toronto’s 1,000-seat Winter Garden Theatre. During that production, New York producer Roy Miller saw potential in the show and he optioned the rights.\n\nWith Canadian actor and fund-raiser Paul Mack, Mr. Miller produced a reading for the New York’s National Alliance for Musical Theatre in October 2004 and invited Broadway producer Kevin McCollum. The reading captured Mr. McCollum’s interest and eventually resulted in Mr. Miller, Mr. McCollum and Bob Boyett, Stephanie McClelland, Barbara Freitag and Jill Furman’s commitment to producing the play. An out-of-town engagement followed at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles (2005), and after being reworked, “The Drowsy Chaperone” opened on Broadway on May 1, 2006."
