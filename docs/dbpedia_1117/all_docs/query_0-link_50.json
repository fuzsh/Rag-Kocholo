        "text": "Let's say you're a Broadway producer. You've got a show, an entirely new show that you love. You're positive that everyone else will love it too: Why else would you have committed the last year and a half of your life to getting it onstage? You've assembled a consortium of backers who have put up $10-million (U.S.) just to get it this far. You've snagged a theatre in a crowded season. You've wrapped a successful tryout in Los Angeles. As we speak, your cast of 17 and creative team are flying into New York for rehearsals, which will begin this Wednesday. The first preview is only 26 days later, and opening night follows exactly four weeks later. All systems are in place.\n\nSo here's the heart of the matter: How do you sell $1-million (U.S.) worth of tickets a week to a show that practically nobody's heard of?\n\nYou cast your eyes across the Broadway musical-theatre landscape, and this is what you see stacked up against your baby: big stars and big brands.\n\nThere's Tarzan, music by Phil Collins, money by Disney. There's Lestat, adapted from an Anne Rice novel, music by Elton John, money by Warner Bros. There's a show about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. A show about Johnny Cash. A show produced by Oprah Winfrey.\n\nHow do you position a smart, funny musical from first-time Broadway writers, with an ensemble cast and a lead from Canada?\n\nThe producers of The Drowsy Chaperone figure they need to take an unconventional and slightly ironic approach, maybe sneak up on people with stealth advertising. So when the first ad hits in tomorrow's New York Times Arts & Leisure section, a splashy full-page trumpeting the show's May 4 opening at the Marquis Theater on Broadway, this is what it will say: \"Sometimes you can tell just by looking at a title that a show is going to be amazing. This is not one of those times.\"\n\nNot everyone is unaware of The Drowsy Chaperone. Some Canadians -- or at least those in the Greater Toronto Area, where the show was mounted in four successively larger productions between 1998 and 2001 -- know all about it.\n\nThis may just be one of those examples of our country producing something extraordinary that has failed to jump the border just because of insufficient PR -- like butter tarts and the concept of a purely symbolic head of state.\n\nFor The Drowsy Chaperone, which will be the first musical created by Canadians to make it to Broadway in more than 25 years, is a charmer. It opens on an unnamed Man in Chair sitting alone in his dowdy apartment, surrounded by 78-rpm records of classic Broadway musicals and glamour shots of stars from long ago.\n\nAs he drops the phonograph needle on the album of a long-lost 1920s musical known as The Drowsy Chaperone, the show comes to life in his apartment, complete with ditsy chorines, a pair of gangsters and a host of other lovably stock characters. The Man in Chair, whose bottomless knowledge of musicals can verge on comically obnoxious, interrupts to comment on the show and, sometimes, to deliver delicious gossip about the stars we're seeing (the fictional ones, not the real ones).\n\nThe show's ironic smarts may provide a joyful evening in the theatre, but they don't make for easy marketing: If you're a producer, you can't just promise \"Singing Cats!\" or \"Dancing Hobbits!\"\n\n\"I always thought we would probably do a better job of confusing people by trying to explain, in the very limited space of an ad, what's really going on,\" agrees Roy Miller, one of the show's producers. \"We want people to know it's a musical and it's very funny, but we don't want people to think this is just a fluffy 1920s musical like any other 1920s musical.\"\n\nKevin McCollum, another producer whose credits include the Tony Award-winners Rent and Avenue Q, says , \"This show comes from a wit and sensibility that celebrates not only the form but also actually anyone who has ever gone to the theatre, and anybody who might be suspicious of the theatre -- and that's basically everybody.\"\n\nMcCollum came on to the show after seeing a workshop in New York in the fall of 2004. Miller was one of the men behind that; he'd first seen a production at the Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto in the summer of 2001. But its roots go back much further. Indeed, the origin myth of Drowsy Chaperone has been repeated so often it has acquired an almost Biblical sheen.\n\nIn July, 1998, friends of the actors Bob Martin and Janet Van De Graaff, who were engaged to be married the following month, presented an evening of standup comedy and song in the backroom of Toronto's Rivoli bar on Queen Street West to toast the couple. Everyone had such a good time, they decided to remount the musical portion of the evening the following year at the Toronto Fringe Festival, adding a framing device of a man who would comment on the action.\n\nThere were 13 actors and a pit band of four, and in a highly unusual move, the company created a royalty pool for everyone who had contributed material, promising a small share of whatever future revenues the show might generate.\n\nFor more revenues were on their way. The fringe show was such a hit that it moved to Theatre Passe Muraille in November, 1999, where it sold out a three-week run. By then, the show was officially credited to the same four people who are on their way to Broadway for rehearsals: Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, who wrote the music and lyrics, and Bob Martin and Don McKellar, who collaborated on the book. (Martin, who also plays Man in Chair, is the only cast member remaining from any of the Canadian productions.) Mirvish Productions placed an expanded version of Chaperone in its subscription season in June, 2001, which ran for seven weeks at the Winter Garden, earning back its $2-million investment. It still wasn't quite the show envisioned by its writers, but no one in Canada had either the money or drive to develop it further.\n\nFor three years, the property was shopped around to prospective directors and backers in the U.S., with no bites. Then, in October, 2004, the New York workshop attracted the attention of some deep-pocketed producers, and Chaperone was suddenly on a fast track to a major production.\n\n(It would thus become the first musical on Broadway created by Canadian talent since the two-man Billy Bishop Goes to War played 12 regular performances in the spring of 1980 at the Morosco Theatre, which was demolished in 1982 to make way for the Marquis: Chaperone's new home. The previous Canadian entrant was the rock 'n' roll musical Rockabye Hamlet, which started at the Charlottetown Festival before moving to Broadway in 1976 and closing after only seven regular performances.) Casey Nicholaw, who won acclaim for choreographing Spamalot, agreed to make Chaperone his Broadway directorial debut. (He also choreographs.) Some major performing talent signed on, including the Tony-winning actress Sutton Foster ( Thoroughly Modern Millie), Georgia Engel (TV's The Mary Tyler Moore Show), and Edward Hibbert (TV's Frasier). They opened at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in early November to strong reviews, including a rave for Martin in the showbiz bible Variety.\n\n\"That's when we could actually do the musical we were always sort of just evoking,\" says McKellar. A long-time denizen of Toronto's alternative theatre scene, McKellar overcame his natural aversion to musicals over the years of writing and re-writing Chaperone, and ended up falling in love with the notion of creating a big, splashy, heartfelt song-and-dance show. \"We've never really had dancing before,\" he adds. \"There's a certain primal pleasure of musicals that we're now able to exploit. When people are tap dancing their hearts out onstage, there's a pleasure that's undeniable.\"\n\nMartin agrees. \"The production in L.A. was the best we've had. It was the most complete, the most fully realized, and the most successful in terms of audience reaction.\"\n\nAnd as the show became more polished, it achieved its greatest level of irony, too. \"Doing a musical comedy is so American,\" says McKellar. \"And the whole Canadian thing is brought up constantly. I do feel this device we have, with the man observing, is a Canadian device: making wry commentaries, enjoying the excesses of the American musical, but also standing outside of it.\"\n\nAnd, occasionally, being swept up in the surreal American swirl. Every night in L.A., celebrities popped by backstage after the show to offer praise. \"We were all excited to meet Henry Winkler on opening night,\" says McKellar. Eric Idle, Tracey Ullman, Elliott Gould, Jo Anne Worley came by. Mel Brooks shocked everyone when he burst in during a post-show Q&A Bob Martin was doing, to say how much he enjoyed the show.\n\nFor the moment, the lives of the Chaperone foursome are a lot more mundane than that. They're finishing up their taxes, finding house-sitters, trying to locate people who will take care of their cats for -- well, who knows how long they'll be gone?\n\nOn Wednesday night, about 100 of their friends and relatives gathered at Rancho Relaxo in Toronto to wish Lambert, McKellar, Martin and Morrison farewell. It was a reunion of sorts, with some members of the original Fringe company seeing each other for the first time in years. All night long, until the bar closed down and people trickled out onto College Street and went their separate ways, they laughed and reminisced and talked excitedly of New York, as if still trying to convince each other that Broadway was not just a dream in their heads. This is what the evening's invitation promised: Music. Appetizers. Shared Disbelief."
