        "text": "What's next for the comic show about a maven of musicals who sits down in a chair and tells the audience the hilarious tale of his favorite 1920s musical?\n\nFollowing the Nov. 10-Dec. 24 run at the Ahmanson, during which director-choreographer Casey Nicholaw made some tweaks to the show, producers are working on plans to bring it Broadway — but it's not clear how soon that can happen. All Broadway theatres (the ones appropriate for the show, anyway) are spoken for at the moment.\n\nThe show's commercial producers are Roy Miller, Kevin McCollum and Bob Boyett.\n\nA daffy, spoofy comic musical would add unique zest to a 2005-06 Broadway season that has so far brought the new musicals The Woman in White (Andrew Lloyd Webber's latest gothic musical), Jersey Boys (a pop bio show that audiences are wild for), The Color Purple (the musical social tapestry drawn from Alice Walker's novel), Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life (the bio revue starring the Broadway legend). The season still promises Elton John and Bernie Taupin's Lestat (the Anne Rice vampire romance now in a tryout run in San Francisco), Ring of Fire (the new musical featuring songs of Johnny Cash), Tarzan (the Disney musical), and The Wedding Singer (the musical comedy based on the film of the same name). Translation: With its flappers, salty commentary about musical fans, backstage intrigue and broad jokes, there is nothing in the current season quite like The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\n* The word \"original\" is a rare thing in the world of musical theatre, but on Nov. 18 Ahmanson Theatre opened the U.S. premiere of a musical comedy that's not based on a play, book or film — The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nNot drawn from source material, but the result of pure imagination, the show's seeds are in a public performance of what was a wedding gift to Toronto Second City actor Bob Martin: In 1998, Martin's friends Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison wrote songs and scenes for an original show called The Wedding Gift, which served as a kind of bachelor party for Martin, his friends — and even strangers.\n\nMartin, Lambert and Morrison thought the lark was too special to let fly away, so they developed the piece into The Drowsy Chaperone, a delicious and wildly comic spoof of musical comedies and their desperately loyal fans.\n\nNow being directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw following separate, cult-hit developmental productions in Toronto, the show stars Bob Martin himself as Man in Chair, the host and guide for The Drowsy Chaperone. Previews began at the Ahmanson on Nov. 10.\n\nMan in Chair sits in an armchair and plays his favorite obscure cast album — the disc of the forgotten 1928 Gable & Stein show, The Drowsy Chaperone. The old work comes to life around him on stage, performed by a cast that includes Sutton Foster, Georgia Engel, Beth Leavel and more.\n\nWith music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison and book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, the musical begins with the introduction of a rabid musical theatre fan (Man in Chair) who tells backstage stories and the on-stage plot of the title musical. The daffy '20s show centers on a grand wedding.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone company includes (in alphabetical order) Danny Burstein (as the Latin lover), Georgia Engel (as the dowager), Sutton Foster (as the bride), Linda Griffin (ensemble), Edward Hibbert (as the butler), Troy Britton Johnson, Eddie Korbich (as the best man), brothers Garth Kravits and Jason Kravits (as actor-brothers who play gangsters), Beth Leavel (as the drowsy chaperone), Kecia Lewis-Evans (as the aviatrix), Bob Martin (as the narrator, known as Man in Chair), Angela Pupello (ensemble), Jennifer Smith (as the ditzy chorine), Joey Sorge (ensemble), Patrick Wetzel (ensemble) and Lenny Wolpe (the producer).\n\nThe scenic design is by David Gallo, costume design by Gregg Barnes, lighting design by Ken Billington and Brian Monahan and sound design by Acme Sound Partners. Casting is by Bernard Telsey Casting and Amy Lieberman, C.S.A., hair design is by Josh Marquette, orchestrations by Larry Blank, dance and incidental music arrangements by Glen Kelly (The Producers), music director/vocal arrangements by Phil Reno, technical supervision by Brian Lynch and Karen Moore is the production stage manager.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is billed as \"a deliciously funny and affectionate love letter to the great musicals of the 1920s. A present-day musical theatre addict, the ultimate Everyfan, is eager to share his favorite Broadway musical, the fabled 1928 Gable and Stein musical The Drowsy Chaperone. As he places the rare cast recording on his hi-fi, The Drowsy Chaperone blooms to life on stage, telling the tale of a pampered Broadway starlet who wants to give up show business to marry, her producer who sets out to sabotage the nuptials and the chaperone, the debonair groom, the dizzy chorine, the Latin lover and a couple of gangsters.\"\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone was the sleeper hit of the 1999 Toronto Fringe Theatre Festival. After a sold-out run, a full production was presented at Toronto's Winter Garden Theatre, where it was lauded by critics and cheered by audiences.\n\nSutton Foster (a Tony Award winner for Thoroughly Modern Millie, and a nominee for Little Women) broke her wrist in rehearsal, but went on nevertheless — she's in a cast, literally.\n\n*"
