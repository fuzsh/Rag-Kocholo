        "text": "Description\n\nA musical within a comedy! When a die-hard theatre fan plays his favorite cast album, the characters come to life in this hilarious musical farce. Winner of five Tony Awards, The Drowsy Chaperone features one show-stopping song and dance number after another. With the houselights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life in his living room and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on and provides witty commentary. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight. Hailed by New York Magazine as “The Perfect Broadway Musical.”\n\nDirected by Julie Bonifay. Music Direction by Dana Cardon, Choreography by Rebecca Boberg. Presented through arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI)."
