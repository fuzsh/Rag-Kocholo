        "text": "In 1955, a new musical featuring an up-and-coming composer/lyricist’s Broadway debut was set to open when the lead producer suddenly died and the show was scrapped. That show was SATURDAY NIGHT, and the composer/lyricist—Stephen Sondheim—has become one of the most important figures in musical theatre history. The show was finally produced in 1997, and we are pleased to be presenting its Bay Area professional premiere. A lighthearted story of lovers and friends in 1929 Brooklyn, Saturday Night’s score features some lovely songs and many flashes of the genius that Mr. Sondheim was soon to become.\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, including one intermission.\n\nMEET THE CAST\n\n*Member of Actors’ Equity Association\n\nEXPERIENCE A FULLER MOON\n\nOpening Night Receptions\n\nJoin the cast and crew as we celebrate the opening of each new production. Savor champagne, wine, and delectable delights from our Opening Night sponsor. The best part? It’s on us!\n\nOpening Night date for SATURDAY NIGHT: Saturday, March 31, 6:00 PM\n\nDiscussion Sundays\n\nGet all your burning questions answered about the show you’ve just seen during our fun and informative post-performance discussions with the audience, cast, and crew. Hosted by Executive Directors Daren A.C. Carollo and Daniel Thomas, who will share the history of the original production as well as our current incarnation! Learn more about the composers, lyricists, and book writers, as well as your favorite Moonie cast members. Discussion Sundays happen on the first and second Sunday of each show in our regular season offerings.\n\nDiscussion Sunday dates for SATURDAY NIGHT: April 1 & 8, 3:00 PM\n\nFamily & Student Matinees\n\nThe best deal in town for kids, parents, and students of all ages. Young people under 18 and college students with a valid student ID can see the show for just $10! Younger students receive a family activity guide, get to participate in an intermission contest (with prizes!), and can join in on a post-show discussion and visit with the actors that includes autographs and pictures. This is a great way to introduce the next generation to the heritage of American musical theatre. This is also a great idea for a kid’s birthday party. Please contact Education Director Dyan McBride for further details or if you have a large group wishing to attend.\n\n42nd Street Moon created the Family Matinee to make musical theatre affordable and accessible for young people along with their parents and to provide families the opportunity to experience classic Broadway. Relevant, fun activities and fascinating discussion guides enable families to rediscover how theatre has served an important function in our nation’s cultural landscape and been a way for families to come together. We have expanded the matinee to be a Family and Student Matinee, so that college-aged students can also take advantage of the generous discount.\n\nFamily and Student Matinee date for SATURDAY NIGHT: Saturday, April 7, 1:00 PM"
