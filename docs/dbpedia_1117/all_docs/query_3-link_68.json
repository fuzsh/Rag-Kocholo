You’re happy for 5 seconds, then something starts ringing.”\n\nWinner of five Tony Awards, including Best Book and Best Original Score, The Drowsy Chaperone is a loving send-up of the Golden Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another.\n\nWith the houselights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.\n\nHailed by New York Magazine as “The Perfect Broadway Musical,” The Drowsy Chaperone is a masterful show, poking fun at all the “types” that characterize the musical theatre genre.\n\nDirector Lisa Pratt\n\nMusic Director Sarah Troxler\n\nChoreographer Tara Morrison\n\nAbout\n\nWhen a die-hard theatre fan plays his favorite cast album, the characters come to life in this hilarious Tony Award-winning musical farce.\n\nCast List\n\nMan In Chair – Danny Bolton*\n\nMrs. Tottendale – Erin Friday\n\nUnderling – David Friday\n\nRobert Martin – Tony Light\n\nGeorge – Shawn Verrier\n\nFeldzieg – Brendan Smith\n\nKitty – Madison Pratt\n\nGangster #1 – Halle Pratt\n\nGangster #2 – Greg Cimmino\n\nAldolpho – Ian White\n\nJanet Van De Graaf – Christina Maggio\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone – Maryann Zschau\n\nTrix – Caitlin Conrad\n\nSuperintendent – Noel Connolly\n\nStaff/Reporters – Al Buckley, Noel Connolly, Caitlin Conrad, Angela Malony\n\n* The actor appears through the courtesy of Actors’ Equity Association, the Union of Professional Actors and Stage Managers in the United States.\n\nTickets"
