        "text": "Workhouse Arts Center Announces New Musical, The Drowsy Chaperone\n\nTony Award-Winning Production is a Loving Send-up of the Golden Age Musical\n\nLorton, VA – (May 8, 2024) Workhouse Arts Center Performing Arts, a multiple Helen Hayes Awards nominee, announces its newest production, The Drowsy Chaperone, a delightful musical comedy about characters coming to life in a fictitious 1928 song-and-dance-infused performance. The production opens May 18 and runs through June 23. Showtimes are Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets are on sale now and range from $25 to $40. For more information, visit the website (www.workhousearts.org).\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone, (Book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar; music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison) is a loving send-up of the Golden Age musical. A winner of five Tony Awards and hailed by New York Magazine as \"The Perfect Broadway Musical,\" The Drowsy Chaperone is a masterful meta-musical, poking fun at all the tropes that characterize the musical theatre genre.\n\nWith the houselights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life and The Drowsy Chaperone begins as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan, and an intoxicated chaperone, and you have the ingredients for an evening of madcap delight.\n\nDirector Frank Shutts leads the Workhouse Performing Arts production of The Drowsy Chaperone. Workhouse Arts Center’s Director of Performing Arts, Joseph Wallen, and Manager of Performing Arts, Liz Colandene serve as the show’s producers.\n\nAbout Workhouse Arts Center\n\nThe Workhouse Arts Center, a project of the Workhouse Arts Foundation, helps to grow and support a vibrant arts center that offers engaging opportunities in visual and performing arts, education classes, historical perspective, community engagement and personal enrichment. The Workhouse is located on a unique historical property—a 55-acre portion of the former DC Correctional Complex in Lorton, Virginia that dates back to 1910. After the complex’s closure in 2001, Fairfax County leadership and an adaptive reuse task force transformed the site into a community arts center. Opened in 2008, the Workhouse now curates and presents dozens of art exhibitions from local, regional, and national artists and is home to more than 60 local artists who create in their on-campus open studios. The Workhouse presents nearly 200 performing arts and community events and offers over 300 education art classes, engaging nearly 100,000 people annually.\n\n# # #"
