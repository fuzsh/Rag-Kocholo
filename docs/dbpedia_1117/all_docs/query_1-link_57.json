        "text": "East Lake Drama students presented The Drowsy Chaperone from April 29 - May 1. Following a year where much of the world came to a halt, and Broadway shuddered it's doors, our East Lake students presented their spring production of \"The Drowsy Chaperone\". The 1997 Tony Award winning show is a parody of American Musical Comedy set in 1928. See several photos below, and view the Eagle Bill program from the show.\n\nELHS Drowsy Chaperone Playbill"
