        "text": "Cast & Creative\n\nPURPLE MOUNTAIN PRODUCTIONS (Producer). Founded in 2001 by Kate Atkinson, Purple Mountain Productions is a boutique production company based in Los Angeles, specializing in independent film and live stage productions. On the film side, PMP has produced almost a dozen movies, from quirky, dark and romantic comedies to dramas and thrillers. PMP’s first film – the documentary Extra: In the Background of a Dream – found worldwide distribution, and its soundtrack has been regularly featured on NPR’s “This American Life.” Most recently, the company’s projects have been in the live performance/musical theatre space. After PMP acquired the exclusive rights to singer-songwriter Dan Fogelberg's catalog of music, Atkinson, with partner Karen Harris under their K-Squared Entertainment banner, penned the book and lead-produced Part of the Plan. The original musical opened Tennessee Performing Arts Center's 2017-18 Broadway season to rave reviews and 15 regional Broadway World Awards, including Best New Work and Best New Musical. That same year, PMP negotiated rights to Pope John Paul II’s poetry from the Vatican and produced La Sorgente, a concert of neoclassical arias performed by six opera singers and a 45-piece orchestra at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre. Other projects include LA’s smash hit musical Boomermania and A Very Brady Musical, on which PMP has partnered with booking agents and co-lead producers Broadway & Beyond Theatricals and is thrilled to work with the Ogunquit Playhouse!\n\nBROADWAY & BEYOND THEATRICALS (Producer), founded by Victoria Lang, Ryan Bogner and Tracey McFarland, is dedicated to the creation and distribution of quality branded theatrical content for the live stage and into other media.

He authored and/or directed a wide range of shows… everything from The Great Adventure, a play about Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson (which has been taped for the Los Angeles City Schools) and the musical The Phantom Of The Opry to Classic Couples Counseling (a play about Shakespearean couples in therapy) and Gilligan’s Island: The Musical.

As a reluctant icon, as well as having an innate interest in science and technology, Christopher was drawn into a new career in the computer industry in 1988. He would spend 20 successful years as an executive in numerous high-tech companies in Silicon Valley. His career in technology did not constitute a full retirement from show business; he took part in an abundance of Brady shows, television movies, series, discussions and retrospectives. These part-time gigs would pull Christopher back toward his roots in entertainment where he would host “Trivial Pursuit America Plays.” Completing over two hundred episodes of “Trivial Pursuit AP” provided him a new career as a game show host. He went on to host “Make Me Rich,” the world’s richest game show, giving away up to 2.5 million dollars per episode. He discovered a real love of being a game show host and has developed “Christopher Knight’s Big Cash Game Show,” a live game show which travels around America when time allows.\n\nHe has continued to work as an actor, originating the role of Eddie in the world premiere stage production of Lloyd Schwartz’s Dinner at Five; making cameo appearances in television and movies, such as Sharknado 6, the franchise’s final installment; and starring in Investigation Discovery’s crime drama “Heartbreakers.” Most recently, Christopher enjoyed participating in HGTV’s Emmy-nominated and record-setting “A Very Brady Renovation.” Working alongside all his Brady siblings and a who’s who of HGTV Hosts, he helped turn the home the world knew as the Brady House into the Brady Home. Now the 2nd most photographed house in America is a meticulous recreation of the Brady Bunch set Christopher worked in and the world knew from the iconic series.\n\nSeeking to reinvent himself once again, Christopher wanted to converge his interests and success in business with his life as an actor and celebrity. In November of 2012 this purposeful effort took shape as Christopher Knight Home, his introduction to the world of his online furniture brand. Over the past eight years, Christopher Knight Home has grown into a leader in online sales of indoor and outdoor home furnishing. In 2018 Christopher extended his namesake brands, with the introduction of the lifestyle brand, the Christopher Knight Collection of curated, fashion-forward products dedicated to making aspirational style affordable. In addition to its online presence, the Christopher Knight bedding line recently launched on HSN.\n\nContinuing the convergence of entertainment and business, Christopher has now expanded his entertainment industry reach to extend behind the camera as he joined his friend and long-time associate, two-time Emmy-nominated producer Phil Viardo to form Former Prodigy Media, a new production company that will focus on non-fiction, documentary and scripted projects in the coming years.\n\nBARRY WILLIAMS, now living in Branson, MO where he hosted the 70s Music Celebration!
