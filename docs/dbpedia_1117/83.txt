“The Drowsy Chaperone” has been described as a love letter to the extravagant musicals of the 1920s.

For The Record:

“The Drowsy Chaperone” premiered at the 1999 Toronto Fringe Theatre Festival, was then produced at Toronto’s Winter Garden Theatre in 2001 and then appeared as part of the National Alliance’s 2004 Festival of New Musicals.
