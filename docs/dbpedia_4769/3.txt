Algol - Definition, Etymology, and Usage in Computer Science

Definition

Algol (n) - Originally an acronym for “Algorithmic Language”, Algol refers to a family of high-level computer programming languages known for influencing many later languages like Pascal, Ada, and C. ALGOL languages were developed in the 1950s and 1960s, emphasizing structured programming and laid the foundation for many modern programming concepts.

Etymology

The term Algol originated from the blending of the words “algorithm” and “language.” Introduced around 1958, it captures the essence of the programming languages aimed at algorithmic description and process.

Additionally, “Algol” is also the name of a star in the constellation Perseus, known as the “Demon Star.” This name derives from the Arabic “al-ghūl” (the ghoul).

Usage Notes

Algol has several derivatives including ALGOL 58, ALGOL 60, and ALGOL 68. These versions offered enhancements in syntax and functionality, influencing the evolution of other programming languages. ALGOL 60, in particular, is famous for introducing code blocks and scope, while ALGOL 68 pushed the boundaries of language design with its orthogonal design principles.

Synonyms and Related Terms

Algorithmic Language: The full term describing the purpose of Algol.

Structured Programming: A programming paradigm popularized by languages like Algol.

Pascal: A language inspired by Algol.

Ada: Another ALGOL-influenced language used primarily by the Department of Defense.

C: Modern programming language influenced by Algol.

Antonyms

Unstructured Programming: The inverse of the structured approach Algol emphasizes.

Related Terms with Definitions

Pascal (n.): A computer programming language named after Blaise Pascal. It built upon the concepts of Algol to support structured programming.

Ada (n.): A statically typed, high-level programming language, extended from Pascal and influenced by Algol.

Structured Programming (n.): A programming paradigm that facilitates clear, understandable, and maintainable code through control structures like loops, conditionals, and subroutines.

Blocks (n.): Segments of code enclosed in specific delimiters denoting the local scope of variables, a concept introduced by ALGOL 60.

Exciting Facts

ALGOL was the first language to be described by the Backus-Naur Form (BNF), a notation used to define the syntax of programming languages.

It was paramount in formalizing algorithms and contributed extensively to the development of computer science as a discipline.

Quotations

“The first principle of ALGOL was that its fundamental ideas should reveal themselves so nakedly that any programmer could rediscover them from scratch whenever the connection with the past was severed.”

— Tony Hoare, British computer scientist

Usage Paragraph

ALGOL’s influence on the development of computer programming cannot be overstated. The language provided important paradigms such as structured programming, which became integral in software engineering best practices. Its syntax and functional conventions set a precedent for various languages that followed, making it easier for programmers to adopt new languages while adhering to legible and systematic coding methodologies.
