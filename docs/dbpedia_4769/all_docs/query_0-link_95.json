        "text": "Last Updated : 11 Jul, 2022\n\nImprove\n\nProgramming Language is indeed the fundamental unit of today’s tech world. It is considered as the set of commands and instructions that we give to the machines to perform a particular task. For example, if you give some set of instructions to add two numbers then the machine will do it for you and tell you the correct answer accordingly. But do you know that Programming Languages are having a long and rich history of their evolution? And with a similar concern, here in this article, we’ll take a look at the evolution of Programming Languages over the period.\n\nIn the computer world, we have about 500+ programming languages with having their own syntax and features. And if you type who’s the father of the computer, then the search engine will show you the result as to Charles Babbage but the father of the computer didn’t write the first code. It was Ada Lovelace who has written the first-ever computer programming language and the year was 1883.\n\n1883: The Journey starts from here…!!\n\nIn the early days, Charles Babbage had made the device, but he was confused about how to give instructions to the machine, and then Ada Lovelace wrote the instructions for the analytical engine.\n\nThe device was made by Charles Babbage and the code was written by Ada Lovelace for computing Bernoulli’s number.\n\nFirst time in history that the capability of computer devices was judged.\n\n1949: Assembly Language\n\nIt is a type of low-level language.\n\nIt mainly consists of instructions (kind of symbols) that only machines could understand.\n\nIn today’s time also assembly language is used in real-time programs such as simulation flight navigation systems and medical equipment eg – Fly-by-wire (FBW) systems.\n\nIt is also used to create computer viruses.\n\n1952: Autocode\n\nDeveloped by Alick Glennie.\n\nThe first compiled computer programming language.\n\nCOBOL and FORTRAN are the languages referred to as Autocode.\n\n1957: FORTRAN\n\nDevelopers are John Backus and IBM.\n\nIt was designed for numeric computation and scientific computing.\n\nSoftware for NASA probes voyager-1 (space probe) and voyager-2 (space probe) was originally written in FORTRAN 5.\n\n1958: ALGOL\n\nALGOL stands for ALGOrithmic Language.\n\nThe initial phase of the most popular programming languages of C, C++, and JAVA.\n\nIt was also the first language implementing the nested function and has a simple syntax than FORTRAN.\n\nThe first programming language to have a code block like “begin” that indicates that your program has started and “end” means you have ended your code.\n\n1959: COBOL\n\nIt stands for COmmon Business-Oriented Language.\n\nIn 1997, 80% of the world’s business ran on Cobol.\n\nThe US internal revenue service scrambled its path to COBOL-based IMF (individual master file) in order to pay the tens of millions of payments mandated by the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security.\n\n1964: BASIC\n\nIt stands for beginners All-purpose symbolic instruction code.\n\nIn 1991 Microsoft released Visual Basic, an updated version of Basic\n\nThe first microcomputer version of Basic was co-written by Bill Gates, Paul Allen, and Monte Davidoff for their newly-formed company, Microsoft.\n\n1972: C\n\nIt is a general-purpose, procedural programming language and the most popular programming language till now.\n\nAll the code that was previously written in assembly language gets replaced by the C language like operating system, kernel, and many other applications.\n\nIt can be used in implementing an operating system, embedded system, and also on the website using the Common Gateway Interface (CGI).\n\nC is the mother of almost all higher-level programming languages like C#, D, Go, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, Perl, PHP, Python, and Unix’s C shell.\n\nSome other programming languages that are popular among programmers are listed below.\n\nPlease Login to comment..."
