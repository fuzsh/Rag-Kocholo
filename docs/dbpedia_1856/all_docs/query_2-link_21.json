REJOINDER OFTHEUNITED STATESOF AMERICA\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.01 In its Judgment of 12December1996,the Court found that it hasjurisdiction, onthe\n\nbasis of ArticleXXI, paragraph 2, ofthe 1955Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and\n\nConsular Rights between the United Statesand Iran (hereinafter\"1955Treaty\") to entertainthe\n\nclaims madeby the Islamic Republicof Iranunder Article X,paragraph 1,of that Treaty. On 23\n\nJune 1997,the United States filed its Counter-Memorialand Counter-Claim (hereinafter\n\n\"Counter-Memorial\"). In its Orderof 10March 1998,the Court foundthat the counter-claim\"is\n\nadmissible as such and forms a part ofthe currentproceedings\". Iran filed its Replyand Defence\n\nto Counter-Claim (hereinafter \"Reply\") on 10March 1999. This Rejoinder responds to Iran's\n\nReply .\n\n1.02 TheUnited States will argue inthis Rejoinder that there remain four independent\n\ngrounds uponwhich Iran's claim shouldbe rejected in its entirety. First, the Courtshould deny\n\nrelief to Iranbecause of Iran's own repeatedillegal conduct. Second,the Court shoulddetermine\n\nthat the actionsofthe United Statesdid notviolate Article X,paragraph 1,ofthe 1955Treaty,\n\nbecause these actions did not impedethe freedomof commercebetween the territoryof Iran and\n\nthe territory of the United Stateswithinthe meaning ofthat provision. Third, the Court should\n\nfind that the actions of the United Stateswere necessaryto protectthe essential securityinterests\n\nof the United States, and accordinglywere excludedfromthe reach of the 1955Treatyby Article\n\nXX,paragraph l(d). Finally, the Courtshouldfind that the actions of the United Stateswere not\n\nwrongful becausethese actions weretaken in lawful self-defensein response to illegal armed\n\nattacks by Iran. The United Stateswill not repeatin this Rejoinder each assertionthatt hasmade previously in these proceedings;unless otherwiseindicated in this Rejoinder, it\n\nincorporates such assertions intothis pleading by meansofthis reference.\n\n1.03 The final Part of this Rejoinder addressesthe issuesraised by Iran with respectto\n\nthe counter-claim of the United States. NotwithstandingIran's resortto arguments in its Reply\n\nwhich areplainly inconsistent with the positions ithas taken with respect to its own claim,the\n\nUnited Stateswill demonstrate in this Part that Iran's illegalconduct was dangerousand\n\ndetrimentalto maritime commerceand impeded the freedomsof commerceand navigation\n\nbetween Iran and the United Stateswithinthe meaningofthe 1955Treaty. It will demonstrate\n\nfurther that the defenses put forwardby Iran for itsillegalconduct are withoutmerit.\n\n1.04 As will become clear inthe course of a reviewofthis Rejoinder,Iran seeks in this\n\nproceedingto invoke the legalresponsibilityof theUnited Stateswith respectto circumstances\n\nand conduct for which Iran itself was plainly and ultimatelyresponsible. Iran seeks to disguise\n\nits responsibility, in some cases,by false representationsto this Court, and in others, by\n\nincompleteand misleading representations. Iran'srepresentationsare beliedby the protests\n\nsubmitted to Iran by numerous countries, the statements ofits own officiais,reports in\n\nauthoritativesources, the statementsand actions ofthe international shippingcomrnunity,\n\naccounts of eyewitnesses, photographic evidence, physicalevidence and interna1Iranian\n\ngovenunent documents. TheUnited States urgesthe Courtto review carefullyIran's conduct in\n\nthismatter, and to attribute responsibility inthis proceedingto that State which should\n\nappropriatelybear it. PART1\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.O1 Although the Parties to this case have submitted detailed and voluminous evidence\n\nto the Court, the basic facts of the caseare simple: Iran launched illegald attacks on U.S.\n\nships and cargoas part of its carnpaignof attackingneutral shippingduring the Iran-IraqWar,\n\nand these attacks compelled the United Statesto take legitimate and necessary actionsboth in\n\nself-defense andto protect essentialU.S. securityinterests.\n\n1.O2 Between 1984and 1988Iran systematicallyand deliberately attacked ships\n\ntraveling in the Gulf from the United Statesand from other countriesthat were neutral in Iran's\n\nwar with Iraq. Over 200 ships from 31neutral countries were victimsof Iran's attacks'. At least\n\n63 people died as a result of these attacks; 99morewere wounded2. U.S. ships which Iran\n\nattacked included Bridgeton,Sungari, Sea Isle City,Lucy,EssoFreeport, Diane, Esso Demetia,\n\nand USSSamuelB. Roberts.\n\n1.O3 In response to Iran's unprovokedand ongoing attackson U.S. shipping, the United\n\nStates took limited self-defense actions againstthree offshoreIranian oil platform complex-s\n\n'See U.S.Counter-Mernorial 23 June 1997(hereinafter\"Counter-Memorial\")p,ara.1.04.\n\nIbid.Staternentof Capt. Christian FeyerPuntewold, 15January1997,and attachments,Exhibit 11.\n\nExhibits1-179werefiledwiththe Counter-Mernoria alndExhibits180-261are attached to this Rejoinder.Rostam, Sassan,and Sirri - that Iran had used in its attackson U.S. and otherneutral shipping in\n\nthe Gulf.\n\n1.O4 Iran bears sole responsibilityfor its illegal armedattacks on U.S. shipping and it\n\ncannot complainof the U.S. actionsin self-defensethatresulted from them.\n\n1.O5The evidence ofIran's illegal actionsisclear. It was well-establishedwithin the\n\ninternationalshipping comrnunitythat Iran was attackingU.S.and other neutralshipping, and\n\nthat Iran usedits oil platforms inthese attacks. Eyewitness accounts of Iran's illegal actions\n\nmake these facts undeniable. Shippingcompaniestookcostly steps to avoidIran's attacks.\n\nNations fromaround the worldprotested Iran's attacks andsent military shipsto the Gulf to\n\nprotect neutralshipping fromthose attacks. The UnitedNations Security Council,the Arab\n\nLeague, andthe Gulf CooperationCouncil condemnedIran's attacks.\n\n1.O6Iran asks this Courtnot to believe this internationalconsensus and the substantial\n\nevidence demonstrating Iran's wrongdoing. Instead,Iran offersthis Courta series of\n\nunsupported conjectures, manyof which are demonstrablyfalse, in an effortto cast doubt on its\n\nresponsibilityfor its attacks onneutral shipping. As thisRejoinder will demonstrate,Iran's\n\nefforts to escapethe consequencesof its illegal actionsare simply not credible. But Iran has\n\ncompounded its credibility problemby making assertionsabout factual matters atissue in this\n\ncase that failto withstand evencasual scrutiny. Indeed,someof Iran's statementsraise questions\n\nas to whetherany serious effortswere made to ascertaintheir truthfùlness. A few particularly\n\nglaring examples,discussed inmore detail below, illustratethe point: Iran categorically denied the existenceof Iranian-controlled missile launching siteson\n\nthe Faw peninsula3,only to be forcedto abandonthis denial when confionted with\n\nphotographic evidence showing an activecruisemissile staging facility in Iranian\n\ncontrolled territory in the Faw area4.\n\nIran has assertedthe existence ofan Iraqicontrolled missile siteat a location on the\n\nFaw peninsula5,when photographic evidenceclearly indicatesthat nosuch site\n\nexisted atthat location at that time6.\n\nIran has deniedthat it laidmines in internationalwatersinthe Gulf7,when\n\nphotographic evidence and eyewitnessaccounts document the Iran Ajr in the act of\n\nlaying mines in international waters at the timeit was capturedby U.S. forces8.\n\nIran's Memorial, 8June 1993(hereinafter \"Memorial\"),para. 4.74 (\"There was, in fact, no Iranian\n\nrnissile-site inthe Fao peninsul...\")In a numberof instances Iranhas adopted different spellings of\n\ncertain propernouns than those used by the United States in its Counter-Mernorial. In this Rejoinder,the\n\nUnited States will continue to use the spellingsadopted inthe Counter-Mernorial.\n\nReply and Defenceto Counter-Claim, 10March 1999(hereinafter \"Reply\"),para. 4.19.\n\nIbid., para. 4.29.\n\nInj?a, para. 1.55.\n\n7Reply, paras. 5.20-5.21.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 1.40-1.47. 1.O7 Disregardingthis Court's prior decisions9, Iran has pleaded with the Court to ignore\n\nvarious statements made by its officiaisadmitting Iran's illegal actions, arguing that the Court\n\nshould not deem such statements to be reliable because they were made in time of war\n\n\"necessarily withpolitical and other considerations in mind\".\" In fact, the false, misleading, and\n\nincredible nature of many of the assertions in Iran's pleadings suggests that the Court should\n\nview Iran's other representations in this case as being of a similar character.\n\n1.O8Iran also attempts to use these proceedings to assign blame for thewhole of the\n\nIran-Iraq War. Iran seemsto suggest that fault for itsdeliberate decision to target neutral\n\nshipping properly rests, inter dia, with Iraq (for being Iran's enemy in the war and attacking\n\nSee Military and ParamiIitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaraguav. UnitedStates)\n\n(hereinafter \"Nicaraguar~M , erits, Judgment,1C.J.

They maythen be construed as a form of\n\nadmission.\"); Keith Highet, \"Evidence,the Court, and the Nicaragua Case,\" 8 1 AmericanJournal of\n\nInternational Law p. 37 (1987) (\"This method was applied to statements made by President Reagan and\n\nby Secretary of State Shultz, for the UnitedStates; and by President Ortega, for Nicaragua.

However,many of them contain public and well-knownfacts which, as\n\nsuch do not require proof; others are of evidentiary value, as has been recognized in international\n\njurisprudence ... insofar as they textuallyreproduce public statements,especially those of high-ranking\n\nmembers of the Armed Forces, of the Government, or evenof the Supreme Court of Honduras . ..\").\n\n10Reply, para.2.43.Iranianshipping); Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and theUnitedStates (for beingsympathetic with Iraq\n\nduringthe war); andthe international cornmunityas a whole (for failing to condernn andstop\n\nvarious Iraqi actions against Iran)\".\n\n1.O9 These assertionsraise issues that areoutsidethis Court'sjurisdiction and have no\n\nrelevancetothis case. Iran never declared that theUnitedStates was a belligerent in its war with\n\nIraq. Rather,this case is about Iran's illegal armed attackson neutral U.S.shipping and the\n\nUnited Stateslawful actions in responseto those attacks. Iran's efforts to vindicateits accountof\n\nthe Iran-IraqWar are beyondthe scopeof these proceedings,andthis Court should ignore them.\n\n1.10 Ultimately, this Court must setasideIran'svarious diversionarytactics and false\n\nassertions and focus on the central facts on which this caseturns. Iran systematically attacked\n\nU.S. and other neutral shipping andit used its oil platformsin these attacks. Iran bears sole\n\nresponsibilityfor these actions, andcannot complainaboutthe limited actionstaken by the\n\nUnited States both in self-defenseand to protect essentialU.S. security interests.\n\n\" Iran observes in its Reply that Kuwaithas apologizedto Iran for its supportfor Iraq during the Iran-Iraq\n\nWar. See Reply, para. 2.26. U.S. Secretaryof State MadeleineAlbright said that \"aspects of U.S. policy\n\ntowards Iraq, during its conflict with Iran appear now to have beenregrettably shortsighted, especially in\n\nlightof our subsequent experienceswith Saddam Hussein.\" MadeleineK.

While suchstatementsmay be of diplornatic or historical\n\ninterest,they shed no light on thespecific facts or legal issues raisedby this case.

Generallyspeaking, presumptionsaffect\n\nthe burden of proof insofar as they createprima facie evidence or proof in favourof the party that 1.13 Indeed, during the war, Iran acknowledgedthat it maintained an illegalcampaign of\n\nattacks against neutral shipping. For example, in February 1988,Nonvay's Ambassador to Iran\n\nprotested Iranianattacks on Nonvegian shippingtoHosseinSheikholeslam, Iran's Deputy\n\nForeign Minister. The Norwegian Ambassadornotedthat the Norwegian shipshadbeen\n\nengaged \"inlegal traffic between neutral harbors\" at the time Iran attackedthem39\n\n1.14 In response to this protest, Deputy ForeignMinister Sheikholeslamacknowledged\n\nboth Iran's responsibility forthe attacks in questionandthat Iran maintained an illegalpolicy of\n\nattacking neutralshipping in the Gulf. According to the Nonvegian Ambassador'sreporting\n\ncable on his conversation with Deputy Foreign Minister Sheikholeslam:\n\n\"Sheikholeslam did notdeny that Iran indeedwasresponsible for the attackson Happy\n\nKari,Berge Big, IglooEspoo,and PetrobulkRuler. He said he regrettedthat Nonvegian\n\nships had been targeted in such attacks, andaddedthat Iran's purposewas not to hm\n\nNorwegian shipping.

When 1\n\narguedthat these are flagrant violations of internationallaw, he somewhatarrogantly\n\nrespondedthat he was fully aware of that. Sheikholeslammentioned thatthe Iranian\n\nNavy had been instructedto seek to avoid lossofhuman lives duringthe attack40.\"\n\n1.15 Iran's practice of attacking neutralshipping,and Iran's specifictargetingof U.S.\n\nshipping, wasfurther confirmedin April 1988by CommodoreMohammad Hoseyn\n\nbenefitsfrornthem.Thisresults inthe shiftingoftheburdenofevidencefrornonepartytotheother\").\n\n39NorwayCable,Exhibit 198.\n\n40Ibid.Malekzadegan, Commander ofthe IranianNavy, who acknowledgedthe existenceof \"a\n\nwholehearted task by the Navy overthe past year, comprisingindirectblows inparticular to the\n\nUS.fleet, affecting both its warshipsand its merchant vessels, withmines or missiles4'. ...\"\n\n1.16 Againstthis background,there can be no doubt of Iran's responsibilityfor attacks\n\non U.S. and other neutral shipping.\n\nSection 2. Iran Used itsOilPlatforms inits Attacks on U.S.andOtherNeutra1Shipping\n\n1.17 The evidenceis also clear that Iran used its oil platformsin its attacks on U.S. and\n\nother neutral shipping. Indeed,the plans and communications of Iran's Navy,as well as\n\nnumerous eyewitness reports,make it impossiblefor Iran crediblytodenyits military useofthe\n\nplatforrns. Iran's only responseto this evidence isto suggestto the Courtthat there were limits\n\nto the military role thatthe oil platforms played. Iran's responsein no way refutes the substantial\n\nbody of direct evidence demonstrating Iran's useof the platforms in its attacks on U.S. and other\n\nneutral shipping.\n\n41\"Radio Phone-InProgram WithDefense Officials,\" Foreign BroadcastInformationService, 14April\n\n1988, p. 53, Exhibit 13(emphasis added).

THEIRANIAE NXCLUSIO ZNONE ANDTHECHANNE LORNEUTRAS LHIPPING\n\n1.18 As a matter of context,it is importantto understandthat, during the Iran-Iraq War,\n\nneutral shippingwas required to travel alonga route that passed close to the Rostarn, Sassan, and\n\nSirri platform complexes. This necessity arose from Iran's declarationof an exclusion zone\n\nalong its coast in the Gulf which renderedoff limits the routesto the north of the platforms that\n\ncommercial shippinghad followedprior tothe war. Routesto the extreme south of the platforms\n\nwere not viable because shallowerwaterthere created risksthat fully loadedtankers wrund\n\nagr~und~~.As a result of Iran's exclusionzone, the routeU.S.tankers took through the Gulf\n\ncarried them fewerthan 15nautical milesfrom the Sirriand Rostam platforms, and fewer than\n\n30 nautical miles from Sa~san~~. he evidence is clearthat Iranseizedon this circumstanceto\n\nincorporatethe platforms into its militarycommand structureand to use the platforms in its\n\nattacks on U.S. and other neutral shippingin the Gulf.\n\n1.19 Documents issuedby the IranianNavy establishconclusivelythat Iranused its oil\n\nplatforms aspart of its military apparatus,by means ofwhich it attacked neutral shipping. This\n\n42See Statement of Colin Eglington, 10,Exhibit 1.\n\n43SeeCounter-Memorial Map 1.2.evidence includesa document entitled \"Joint SeaCoast 1Combat Group(Operations)Sea Coast\n\n1OperationsPlan Ghadir\"(hereinafter\"Operations Plan\")44.U.S. forcestook possession of the\n\nOperationsPlan when they boardedthe Iran Ajrafterwitnessing its crew layingmines in the\n\nGulf.

Four ships ofthe\n\nKuwait Oil Tanker Company (hereinafter\"KOTC\")wereflagged under United Kingdom registry\n\nand elevenKOTC ships wereflaggedunder U.S. registry.

Iran's Pattern of Missile Launchesfromthe Faw Area is Consistent with its\n\nAcknowledged Policyof TargetingKuwait's OilTrade\n\n1.47 The missile that hit Sea Isle Citywas one of a series of missiles launched by Iran\n\nfrom the Fawarea during 1987'0°.Each ofthesemissilelaunches was inthe direction of\n\nKuwait's oil loading terminalat Al-Ahmadi SeaIsland. Theday before Iran attacked Sea Isle\n\nCi@, it launched a missile fromthe Faw areathat hit theU.S. owned tankerSungari, which was\n\nanchored south of Al-Ahmadi and near the locationwhereSea Isle Citywas hit. In September\n\n1987,Iran launched three missiles in the samegeneraldirection: one on September2 that landed\n\ninthe water northeast of Faylakah Island; oneon September4 that landedsouth of Mina\n\nAbdullah; and one on September 5that landedin KuwaitBay. Iran also launchedtwo missiles\n\nfrom the Fawarea in January 1987,bothof which landednear Faylakah Island.\n\n1.48 These missile launches are consistentwith Iran's acknowledged policyof attacking\n\nships carryingKuwaiti cargo1O'.By firingmissilesinthe direction of the Al-Ahmadi Sea Island\n\n99SeeUSS Klackring,Deck Log, commencing 0431, 10October 1987and ending 2400, 14 October 1987,\n\nExhibit 206.\n\n'OSee Counter-Memorial, paras. 1.54-1.62.\n\n'OSee Nonvay Cable, Exhibit 198;Statement of Thomas Flamminio, Aerospace Engineer,U.S.\n\nDepartment of Defense, Exhibit 207.Terminal, Iran could hope to preventshipsfrom traveling to and fromthe terminal, and thereby\n\ndisrupt Kuwait'soil trade. In light of Iran's desire to disruptthis trade, Iranhad a clear incentive\n\nto launch missileattacks directedtowardAl-Ahmadi.\n\nSection4. Iran's Efforts to Deny its ResponsibilityareInconsistentand Incredible\n\n1.49 In its desperation to deny its responsibility for theSea Isle City attack in spite of\n\nthis substantial body of evidence,Iranhas offered this Courtan ever-shiftingset of assertions,\n\napparently unconstrainedby anyconcern fortheir veracity. None of Iran'svarious accounts of\n\nthe attack is credible.\n\n1.50 Iran began by assertingthat it could not havebeenresponsible forthe Sea Isle City\n\nattack because it did not maintain missile sites on the Faw Peninsula. Iran's assertionwas\n\ncategorical and without reservation:\n\n\"Thetrue explanation is that the missile was neverfiredby Iran! Therewas, infact, no\n\nIranian missile-site in theFaopeninsula which theUnited States could have attacked.\n\nIran's own conclusion isthat themissile was firedby Iraq, frommotives no more devious\n\nthan the Iraqi attack on the U.S.S. Stark,or the hundredsof attackson vessels, including\n\nKuwaitivessels, by Iraqi aircraftand Iraqi Silkwonn missiles during the previous five\n\nyears'02.\"\n\n'O2Memorial, para. 4.74 (emphasis added). 1.51 Without any explanation,Iran hasnow abandoned this untruthfulposition\n\ncompletely. Confronted with satellite imagery demonstratingIraniancontrol of an active cruise\n\nmissile staging facility inthe Faw area'03,Irannow acknowledgesthat it capturedthree missile\n\nsites in the Faw area in early 1986. Iran's Reply states,in direct contradictionto its earlier\n\nrepresentationto this Court, that\n\n\".. .it is true that Iran captured three Iraqi missile siteson the Faopeninsula as part of its\n\ncounter-offensiveduring the course of 1986. These sites contained concrete shelters and\n\nfixed launching pads for Iraqirnis~iles'~~.\"\n\nIranadds, however, thatbecause \"al1accessroads to the missile sites were totally destroyed\",\n\nthese sites \"became useless and remained inoperativeduring al1the time that Faw was under\n\nIraniancontr01.\"'~~This assertion is also completely false;U.S. satellite imagerytaken on 16\n\nOctober 1987 -the day of the attack onSeaIsleCit y shows vehicles operatingon the roads\n\nleadingto oneof the Iranian missile sitesonthe Faw peninsula and in the vicinityof the site\n\nitselfIo6.Iran's missile sites were intact, accessible,and capable of firingmissiles like the one\n\nthat hitSeaIsleCity.\n\n1.52 Iran also suggests that the imagery ofIranianmissile stagingareas that the United\n\n'OSee U.S. reconnaissancesatelliphotographs,Exhibit94.\n\n'O4Reply,para.4.19.See alsoStatementofMohammadYoussefi,Reply Vol. VIp ,ara.14.\n\n'O5SeeStatementof Mohammad Youssefi,Reply Vol. VIp,ara15.\n\n'O6SeeU.S. overheadimageryoftheFawarea(hereinafter\"Imagery\")E ,xhibit208,image 5.States submitted with its Counter-Memorial is insufficientto demonstrate that Iran maintained\n\nmissile launching sites inthe Faw area1O( 7although, as notedabove,Iran now acknowledgesthat\n\nit did maintain such sites). To removeany doubt on this point,the United States is submitting\n\nwith this Rejoinder additional imagery showing the existence of fourHY-2missile sites on\n\nIranian-controlled territory in the Fawarealos. Duringoral proceedingson the merits, theUnited\n\nStates will present expert testimony toexplain and confirmto the Court the substanceof this\n\nevidence and the other overhead imagery thatthe UnitedStateshas introduced in thiscase.\n\n1.53 Faced withthe loss of its chief defensewith respecttothe Sea Isle Ciiy attack, Iran\n\nhas invented a newone in its Reply. Iran now assertsthat, in additionto the Iranian-controlled\n\nmissile sites inthe Faw area (the existenceof which Iranhad previously denied), Iraq retained\n\ncontrol over an additional siteinthe vicinity. Iran assertsthatIraq could have used this site to\n\nlaunch the attack on Sea Isle Ci@. As was the case with Iran's last assertion, U.S. satellite\n\nimagery demonstrates that this assertionis completely false;no such Iraqi site existed atthe time\n\nof the attack onSea Isle Ciiy.\n\n'O7See Reply,paras.4.21-4.24;Statementof ColonelMahmoodFarshadfarI,ranReply VolVI.,para.3.\n\n'O8Imagery,Exhibit208, images 2-11. 1.54 Iran has providedthe Court an undatedphotograph montage whichit asserts was\n\ntaken \"beforethe capture of theFaw Peninsula\" showingthe existence of an additional missile\n\nsitein the Faw area apart fromthose controlled by IranIo9.The Statement ofMohammad\n\nYoussefiStatesthat this additionalmissile sitewas locatedat coordinates 300012N-481705E on\n\nthe front part of the Faw Peninsu1a''O.\n\n1.55 U.S. satellite imagerytaken between 5May 1987and 13November 1987\n\ndemonstratesthat no missile site existed at that time anywhere inthe vicinity ofthe location\n\nspecifiedby Iran1\". Overheadimagery confirmsthat a missilesite was constructed nearthat\n\nlocation, at coordinates 295806N-0481955Earound April1989,but no such sitewas there in\n\nOctober 1987Il2.\n\n1.56 Like Iran's previous assertions, Iran's assertionthat an Iraqi-controlledmissile site\n\ninthe Faw areacould havebeenthe source ofthe attackon Sea Isle Cityis clearly and\n\ndemonstrably false. OnlyIranpossessed missilelaunchingsites in the Faw area at the time of\n\nthe attack on Sea Isle City,andthus only Iran couldhave launched an attack fromthe Faw.\n\n'O9Statement of Mohammed Youssefi, Reply Vol. VI, para. 8.\n\n\"O See ibid.para.9.\n\n\"' Imagery, Exliibi208, images 9-12.\n\n\"' Imagery, Exhibit208, image 13. Overhead imageryfirstdisclosedthe constructionof amissile site atthis\n\nlocation in April1989;the imageofthis site contained in image13 was taken in October 1994. 1.57 Iran attempts to create doubtsas to its responsibilityfortheSea Isle Ci@attackby\n\noffering this Courtthe unsustainable theory thatIraqattacked Sea Isle Cityusing a missile that\n\ntraveled alonga circuitous route (rather than in a straight line). Iranarguesthat such a missile\n\nwould concealthe location fromwhichit had beenfired,making a missile firedfrom Iraqi-\n\ncontrolled territory appear as if it had been fired fromIranian-controlledterritory. Accordingto\n\nIran's Reply, \". .. it was entirely possible for a missile targeting Kuwait's harbour tobe launched\n\nfrom the remaining Iraqi site in the vicinityof Fao andto be programmedso as to fly over both\n\nBubiyan and Faylakah Islands en route toits destination'l3.\"Onceagain,Iran's theory is clearly\n\nand demonstrablywrong.\n\n1.58 First, Iran's theory is based on an Iraqi missile beingfired\"fromthe remaining Iraqi\n\nsite in the vicinityof the Fao\". Asthe United Stateshas conclusively demonstrated, no such\n\nIraqi site existedat the time of the attackon Sea Isle Cio. Thus, Iraq wasnot in a positionto fire\n\nthe missile thathit Sea Isle Ci@even if the missile wereable to travelin a circuitous route.\n\n1.59 Second,the missile that hitSea Isle Citywas not equippedwith a guidance system\n\ncapable of guidingthe missile along a circuitous route. Iran's expert,JeanFrancois Briand,\n\nasserts that Iraqcould have fired an HY-2missile fromthe alleged \"fourthsite\" and prograrnmed\n\nit to execute atum near the tip of Faylakah Island that would haveallowedthe missile to assume\n\n- --\n\n113Reply, para. 4.51.a course consistent with thatofthe missile that hitSea IsleCity114. Mr. Briand's statement is\n\nincorrect.\n\n1.60 As explained in the Statement of Mark Pitt, the guidance systemof the HY-2directs\n\nthe missile in a straight lineuntil a timer activates the missile's seekerandthe seeker begins to\n\nsearch fortargets. The seekersearchesfor targetsby using a radarbeamto scanan area 12\n\ndegreesto the right and left ofthe seeker'scenter. The seekerthen locks ont0 the first object of\n\nsuitablesize it finds within this area and within the 17km range of the seeker's radar,and guides\n\nthe missileon a course to hit that target'15.\n\n1.61 This system doesnot allow the missileto beprogrammedto turn at a particular time\n\nas assertedby Mr. Briand. Hadthe missile begunto execute aturn near the tip of Faylakah\n\nIsland, as Mr. Briand asserts, it would have onlydone so because its seekerhad already been\n\nactivated and had lockedont0 atarget toward which the seeker was directingthe missile. Such a\n\ntarget wouldneed to be within 17km of the tip of Faylakah Island,becausethis is the maximum\n\nrange of the missile's seeker. The locationwherethe SeaIsle City was hit was about 60 km from\n\nthe tip of Faylakah Island,making it impossible for the missileat that locationto selectSea Isle\n\nCity as a target'I6.\n\nIl4SeeRapport de M.JeanFrancoisBriand at para ..09andaccompanying map,Reply, Vol. VI.\n\nStatementofMarkPitt,SeniorMissileAnalyst,AustraliaD nefenceIntelligenceOrganisation, paras.-5,\n\nExhibit209.\n\nIl6See ibidpara. 11. 1.62 As illustrated inExhibit21O\"',Iran'smissile sites inthe Faw area were orientedto\n\naim missiles directly towardKuwaitHarbor, whereSea Isle Citywas anchoredwhen it was hit.\n\nAs demonstrated above, the HY-2missile that hitSeaIsle Citywas capableof following onlya\n\ndirect path toward its target. OnlyIran was in a position tolaunchthis missile.\n\nD. THEMISSILE THAT HITSm ISLE CITYWASNOTLAUNCHEF DROM THEAIRORSEA\n\n1.63 In a fùrther effortto divertthe Court's attention fromthe evidence establishing its\n\nresponsibility forthe attack on Sea IsleCity,Iran invitesthe Courtto speculatethat the missile\n\nthat hit Sea Isle Citycould have beenlaunchedby Iraq from the air or sea. Beyond observing\n\nthat Iraq operatedboth an airforceand a navyat the time of the attack onSea Isle City,Iranhas\n\noffered the Courtno evidenceto supportan air or seanch theory. Asthe United States\n\ndemonstrated in its Counter-Memorial,the physical evidence collected fromthe series of missile\n\nattacks from the Faw area in 1987is inconsistent with Iran's speculationthatthe missile that hit\n\nSea Isle Citycouldhave beenlaunchedfrom the air or sea'l8. Onthe contrary,that evidence\n\nserves toconfirmthat the missilewas launchedby Iran from land in theFaw area.\n\n1.64 In sum, Iran'sresponsetothe evidence demonstrating its responsibility for the\n\nattack onSea Isle Cityamountsto little more than a series of unsupportedand frivolous attempts\n\n\"'SeeReferenceMap,Exhibit 210.\n\n\"*SeeCounter-Mernorial, para1.71-1.73.to escape responsibilityby blaming Iraq. As the evidencepresented bythe United Stateshas\n\ndemonstrated, Iran'svarious conjecturesabout Iraqi responsibilitysimplyare not credible.\n\nIndeed,Iran's abandonmentof its previous representations,andthe United States'systematic\n\ndisproving of Iran'snew assertionsandtheories, showthat Iran's pleadings have providedthe\n\nCourt nothingon these points on whichthe Court may rely.\n\n1.65 In the period followingIran's attack onSeaIsleCity,Iran continuedto attack U.S.\n\nand other neutral shipping in the Gulf. According to Lloyd's Maritime Information Service, Iran\n\nwas responsible for attacks onno fewer than 57 neutralvesselsin the Gulf between 16October\n\n1987(the date ofIran's attack onSeaIsle City)and 14April 1988(the date ofIran's attackon\n\nthe USSSamuelB.Roberts)' 19.Theseattacks included the 15November 1987attack on the U.S.\n\nowned tankerLucy,the 16November 1987attack on the U.S.owned tankerEssoFreeport, and\n\nthe 7 February 1988attack onthe U.S. owned tankerDiane'20.There was thus no break in Iran's\n\nattacks inthe period following the attack onSea Isle City;ratherthese attacks continued\n\nunabated.\n\nIl9See \"VesselsReported toHaveBeenAttackedandDamagedDuetoActsof HostilityBy theIraqisand\n\nIraniansintheGulfAreaSinceMay1981 ,\"Lloyd SMaritime InformationService, Exhibit9.\n\n''OSee infi.a,PartVI.
