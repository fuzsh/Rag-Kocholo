It is these values that you cannot see, that determine rope perform- ance. Such a hidden value is protection — the safeguard alike of cargo and crew. To bring you this protection, quality of fibre and manufacturing skill must combine to make a rope that is stronger, longer wear- ing, more dependable. Protection is only one of the many hidden plus values you receive when you specify Tubbs and Portland Marine Rope. It is another of the extras that have made these famous ropes the choice of Marine buyers of the Pacific for generations.

Such purification re- duces engine wear, improves engine reliability, lowers engine repair and maintenance cost, makes available more engine operating hours per year and, finally, lowers lubricating cost. Any occasional treatment of oil cannot accomplish all these results. For nearly a quarter century De Laval Oil Purifiers have achieved -,,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^—- these results by the effective utiliza- Hi ^'^PPV^^^^^^HJ^^B \"^ centrifugal force, removing HI 9^^\\^g00^^^^^'''^^^ harmful impurities but not the \"ad- ^1 ^^^\"\"^ ditives\" which perform an impor- ^■,^L tant function in some Diesel lubri- cating oils. In the case of the Diesel engine particularly, De Laval machines have been an important factor in securing better and more economical operation. In recent years the purifying efficiency of De Laval Purifiers has been still further improved. In addition, they are now available as complete, compact, fully enclosed plants such as the ''I ni-Matic\"' which includes pumps, beaters where required, gauges, sampling cocks and other conveniences for purifying the oil. Units are direct motor driven, self- lubricated and ball bearing equipped. Bowls or purifying members in large sizes are of ^elf-draining type for easy cleaning and all are scientifically rated as to efficiency and capacity.

This is the beginning of our 37th year of service to the Pacific American merchant marine. During these almost four decades, both the merchant marine and ourselves have grown to a stature that would hardly have been predictable from that small one-room office on a Seattle waterfront pier in 1904, A certain great poet-philos- opher once said, \"I looked be- hind to find my past, and lo! it had gone before.\" Taking this quotation as a basis for our prospective thinking in this first month of 1940, we of the Pacific Coast may well take courage and go on to greater achievements in the decades ahead. There have been many oc- casions during the past forty years when men of experience in merchant marine affairs looked with despair on the fu- ture of the Pacific American merchant marine; when labor troubles, foreign competition and natural catastro- phes have had us down and almost out. Yet here we are at the beginning of 1940, stronger, more virile and more eagerly looking forward than at any other period during this century. As we look over the world todav, we are ini- Piiriiii,' recent months yun have eii- fiaijed ill a hiii(/ series of acts of brav- ery.

E. S. LAND, Chairman Viiited .S'tates .Maritime Commission pressed with the fact that the United States is the only nation possessing a large merchant fleet that is entirely free to develop new commercial connec- tions in international trade. This is a great oppor- tiuiity, and many of our ship operators are already taking advantage thereof. There is also an opportunity just now to sell old and laid-up tonnage advantageously. Every nation at war needs ships for many purposes, and is willing to pay far more than scrap value for old hulls. This op- portunity also is being em- braced by many shipowners. Shipbuilding on the Pacific Coast has now a good start, with contracts for twenty- three fine cargo vessels. All indications point to a ten- to fifteen-year period of great ac- tivity in American shipbuild- ing. Actual commercial con- struction and contracts in American yards on January 1 is well over a million gross tons. This is the greatest total we have ever had, except in the war - construction period under the United States Shipping Board. That this total annual con- struction will probably remain at ap[)roximately this level for several years ahead, and then taper off very gradually, if at all, sboidd be a most happy New Year prospect for the Pacific Coast shipbuilder. ADMIRAL EMORY S. LAND Chairman, LJ. S. Maritime Commission All I'etleral liureau>, and jiarticu- iarly those dealing directly with Amer- ican industries, are suhject to sectional pressure and to accusation of sectional favoritism. In this the Maritime Com- mission has heen no cxce])tion. L'nlike its j)redecessor, tlic L'. S. Sliippin;^ r>oard, there was no |)ro\\ision made- for sectional rei)re;entation in the cre- ating ret, nor at the time of this act was there existing an\\' international emergency requiring great hate in ship construction. The I'resiflent took jdenty of lime JAMES I liA IKS Dir., Tech. Div., U.

When a definite program of replacement had been decided, the Connnission proceeded cautiously td M)und out the possible operators of tliese ships with tentative standard de- signs for several types of cargo and ]iassenger-cargo vessels. Then bids were called from shipyards, and con- tracts let with great care. The Com- missifm was feeling its way into the program, and soon the shipyards ot the .\\tlantic Coast began to bum with acti\\ ily. .\"^-teps by which this actual construc- tion was approached are interesting, as developed in the following sketchy account of the history of the Commis- sion and of its Technical Division.

Wiley, chair- man, Admiral Montgomery Taylor, and George Landick, Jr. This Com- mission organized the Martime Com- mission and took over the work of the former United States Ship])ing Board I^.ureau, in accordance with the pro- visions of the Act. Iv'irl\\- in 1937 the |)resident ap- |iointed the members of the permanent Maritime Commission, consisting of five men, as provided for in the Act. Joseph r.

Max O'Rell Truitt, who had been general counsel of the Commission, was selected by the President as com- missioner, to fill the vacancy caused by Mr. Kennedy's resignation. Shipping Survey The first major act of the Commis- sion was to determine, by a survey of the shipping situation, the types and kinds of ships required to replace the existing tonnage. As a result, the Com- mission established a definite program to build 500 ships within a period of ten years. Admiral Land, late in 1937, follow- ing his appointment as chairman, se- lected Commander Howard L. Vick- ery (CC), U. S. N., at that time on duty as head of the War Plans Unit in the Bureau of Construction and Re- pair, Navy Department, to come to the Commission as his senior assistant for the purpose of organizing a techni- cal division. Upon his arrival at the Commission, Commander Vickery found that the technical work was being performed by W. G. Esmond, naval architect, and J. E. Schmeltzer, marine engineer, with only three assistants. Under Commander Vickery's direc- tion a Technical Division was set up, with James L. Bates (formerly in charge of Preliminary Design, Bureau of Construction and Repair, Navy De- partment) as director, and J. E. .Schmeltzer as assistant director and chief engineer. Various sections were formed, as follows : Hull Plan Approval & Scientific Section — Headed by W. G. Esmond. Engineering Plan Approval Section — Headed by A. C. Rohn. Engineering, Scientific, Preliminary Design & Specifications .Section — Headed by C. W. Flesher. Hull Final Design Section — Headed by P. B. Brill. Construction Section — Headed by L. R. Sanford. Performance Section — Headed by W. E. Thau. Materials Section — Headed by E. L. Easier. Hull Preliminary Design Branch — Headed by L J. Wanless. Clerical Section — Headed by B. F. Carter. The first important act of the Com- mission afifecting the Technical Divi- sion was the signing of a contract with the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. of Newport News, Vir- ginia, for the building of the S.S. America. Immediately following this was the contract with the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey for twelve twin-screw naval defense tankers. The Technical Division in the mean- time was preparing designs for its C-2 type cargo vessels, on which the first bids were received February 1, 1938. Tremendous Work Done .Since the Technical Division was or- ganized, contracts have been awarded covering a total of 141 vessels, of which 111 have been to the Commis- sion's own designs and 30 to designs prepared by private naval architects. The designs of jirivate naval archi- tects are examined and apjiroved by the Technical Division before con- COMDR. H. L. VICKERY (CC.) Senior Asst. to Chairman, U. S. Maritime Com. tracts for construction of the vessels can be started. All of the working plans of the Commission's C-1, C-2, and Q-Z type vessels are examined and approved before any construction work is done. The Construction Sec- tion of the Technical Division has in- sjiectors at the various shipyards for the purpose of inspecting and check- ing on the construction work being done there for the Commission. Materials entering into the shiji construction are prescribed and tested by the Materials Section of the Divi- sion. I. E. SCHMELTZER Asst. Dir., Tech. Div., U. S. Maritime Com.

Chief, Hull Plan App. & Scientific Sec., USMC Chief, Hull Final Design Section, USMC The Clerical Section handles all the plans and correspondence of the Tech- nical Division, and some idea of the volume of the work of this section may be gathered from the fact that the Technical Division acts on over 2,000 working detail plans per month. The Performance Section is charged with the responsibility of seeing that the ship and its machiner}' functions as the Technical Division intended it should, and to gather professional data for the improvement of future designs. Work performed by the Technical Division is tremendous. During the two years of its existence, the experts connected with this department have developed preliminary and final plans for : nine types of cargo carriers ; two types of cargo-passenger vessels ; and one type of large transpacific passen- ger liner. In addition to this develop- ment work, the Division has : checked carefully many proposed design plans for private owners ; tested all mate- rials going into construction of some 141 ships ; held performance trials on some 21 vessels; and checked working detail drawings on all of these vessels. When we consider the volume and the character of this work, and realize that it has been done so carefully that every ship so far tested has exceeded the calculated speed on normal shaft horsepower, and that one type has pro- duced a world record on fuel economy, we must salute the Technical Division of the U. S. Maritime Commission for its splendid achievement. Pacific Coast Program Much criticism has been directed at the Maritime Commission and its Technical Division for alleged failure to recognize the existence of the ship- building industry on the Pacific Coast. Much political pressure has been ap- plied and publicity exerted to force some of the shipbuilding effort to the Western seaboard. The Technical Di- vision has never, so far as we are Artist - conception of ( -.iiinicr, four of which are now building at Moore Dry Dock Co. PACIFIC M .\\ R I N E REVIEW ^. S. MoAdtUfi^ Q(unmiM44Ut — ARTHUR C. ROHN Chief, Eng. Plan Approval Sec., USMC C. W. FLESHER Chief, Eng. Scientific & Spec. Section, USMC L. R. SANFORD Chief, Construction Section, USMC aware, taken any troulile to answer these criticisms. Since Pacific Marine Review has somewhat participated as a critic, we are now going to appeal to the record, which shows that the Com- mission has been quite impartial in the matter of contracts. First of the series of 141 ships that comprise the fleet constructed, under construction, or under contract to date, is the U. S. Lines' steamer America, authorized by contract dated October 21. 1937. Next bit of work appearing on the record is the 12 national-defense fea- ture tankers ordered through Stan- dard Oil Company of New Jersey. These bear the date Januarj' 3, 1938. Then comes a group of C-2 type cargo vessels contracted in May and June, 1938, followed by a group of C-3 type in November and December, 1938,' and in January, 1939. The Jan- uary, 1939, contract was for two C-3 cargo carriers to be built by the Moore Dry Dock Company of Oakland. The first of these vessels at Moore's yard is Hull Number 51 on the Maritime Commission books. Since no shipyard on the F'acific Coast was ready to undertake the America or the twelve tankers, and since six of the re.st of the fifty-one hulls were built for private ship oper- ating firms who sat in on awards, it is apparent that there were thirty ves- sels awarded to Atlantic Coast yards before the first Pacific Coast award. As we look hack now on the great deluge of oratory and publicity on this matter, it seems as if there must have been hundreds of contracts given to Eastern yards, and that these yards must have been busy for years before we of the West Coast were even thought of by the Commission. Yet there is the record in cold figures ; thirty vessels contracted for and a nine-months' period of time from the first Atlantic Coast job to the first Pacific Coast contract. The first contract, at the end of a little more than a year after the Tech- nical Division began to function, put Pacific Coast yards in the position of having 6 per cent of the work author- ized by the Commission which Pacific Coast yards could have handled. Accelerating Contract Rate -Since January, 1939, the rate of con- tracting has accelerated considerably. Then numbering 51 total, they now number 141. Contracts for 50 vessels were let during 1938 ; contracts for 90 vessels were let during 1939. Of these 90 contracts, the shipbuilding yards of the Pacific Coast received contracts for 21 vessels, or approximately 23 per cent of the total. This is a very en- couraging increase in the proportion of shijjs allotted to our West Coast yards, and it encourages us to believe that we shall have more of this program in the future. The satisfactory progress now lieing made f)n |)resent contracts is giving the Maritime Commission a healthv re- spect for the ability of Pacific Coast shipbuilders, and will undoubtedly lead to larger commitments in the future. Pacific Coast Contracts Summing up the Commission's ship- building contracts at present in force in Pacific Coast yards, we have: (1) The Moore Dry Dock Com- pany, Oakland, California. This firm leads the list in tonnage value and prior date of first contract with four C-3 type cargo vessels allotted to the American President Lines' round-the- world service. These vessels have a total loaded displacement tonnage of 70,400, and a total contract value of $11,221,520. (2) Bethlehem Steel Company, Shipbuilding Division, Union Plant, San Francisco, California. This oldest of Pacific Coast steel shipbuilding plants (the old L^nion Iron Works) has five C-1 type, steam turbine drive, full scantling ships not yet allotted to' any ship operator. The five vessels total 64,375 tons loaded displacement and $10,010,000 contract cost. (3) Consolidated Steel Corpora- tion, Los Angeles, Calif., a well-known and experienced steel fabrication firm, has four C-1 type, turbine drive, full scantling ships. The four ships will total 51,.5(X) tons loaded dis])lacement and $7,560,000 contract cost. (4) Seattle - Tacoma Shipbuildinti Corporation, Seattle, Washington, is combining the Todd Shipyard at Ta- coma with the outfitting docks and JANUARY, 1940 7«4e ^eoUnicxd 2>l<dilan o^ tUe n m . ^ E.

This firm has five C-1 type, diesel drive, full scantling cargo ves- sels, with a total displacement tonnage of 64,375 and a total contract cost of $10,635,000. (5) IVestern Pipe and Steel Com- pany, San Francisco, Calif., operates a large fabricating plant at South San Francisco adjacent to a large basin having four side-launching ways. Here many barges and dredge hulls have been built in recent years and many seagoing ships during the former war shipbuilding program. This firm has five C-1 type, diesel drive, full scant- ling cargo carriers, with a total dis- placement of 64,375 tons and a total contract cost of $10,635,000. Widespread Benefits The 23 vessels of this program will aggregate 315,025 displacement ton- nage and a value of $50,061,520. They will use : appro.ximately 60,000 tons of ship steel ; 14,4<X) tons of propulsion machinery and engine room auxiliar- ies; and 18,250 tons of equipment rig- ging, deck machinery, wiring, piping and other items. The total weight of the material and equipment worked into these vessels will be 95,920 tons. This material and equipment will come from all parts of the United -States. Much of it will be produced and manufactured on the Pacific Coast, but in the total, nearly every state in the Union will be represented, and in its transportation nearly every American freight transporting method and firm will have had a share. Additional Plans The Commission has under way the plans and specifications for several new designs, including passenger and cargo ships and tankers. One design which is exciting a great amount of in- terest at present is the new liner for the transpacific trade of the American President Lines, on which the Com- mission expects to ask for bids on Jan- uary 15, 1940. This vessel will be the largest and speediest merchant ves- sel ever designed and built in the United States, and will contain many novel features of design. The Technical Division has grown i:.

Chief, Construction Section, USMC considerably since Commander Vick- ery organized it in 1937. In compar- ison to five employees then, it now has some 12i}> employees on its rolls outside of the field force, but at that is very much undermanned, consid- ering the amount of work it has in prospect and in project. Its personnel, however, is young and enthusiastic, and applies itself in a manner that has resulted in meeting all schedules on the appointed time. The Commission has not hesitated to pioneer in many directions, and has attempted in its designs to take ad- vantage of all the progressive steps in modern engineering. At present its designs call for steamships having steam characteristics of 450 lb. gage pressure and 750° F. total tempera- ture; 1200 lb. gage pressure and 950° F. total temperature; and 1200 lb. gage pressure and 750° F. total tem- perature (regenerative reheat cycle). In addition, there are direct-drive die.sels, two-engine-geared diesels, and four-engine-geared diesels, with horse- powers ranging from 4,CXX) S.H.P. to 80,000 S.H.P. The designs of the Commission's ships, up to the present, have resulted in ships whose performance in every way has been most gratifying. The results obtained are due to good design generally, both in hull form and ma- chinery. We salute the Technical Division of the United States Maritime Commis- sion, and congratulate them on their great accomplishment. \" r (••••5 ^ <!..' S. S.

Yard to Build Five C-Is The Union Plant of Bethlehem is the pioneer steel shipbuilding plant of the Pacific Coast. As the Union Iron Works, its history in the design and building of heavy machinery runs back to the good old days of '49. It began to be a steel shipbuilding plant at its present site in 1881, and for nearly twenty years was the only steel shipbuilding yard on the Pacific Coast of North America. We doubt if there is another plant in the United States today that has a continuous history of 59 years building steel vessels. During these ten decades, this plant built and equipped some 336 hulls. First of these, the Arago, was a small coastwise freighter, delivered in 1884. The list since includes many fine cargo vessels, passenger liners, tankers, de- stroyers, coast defense vessels, cruisers, submarines, gunboats and battleships. .\\t the peak of the Shipping Board war-time effort the Union Plant was working 35,000 men. During its first two decades, this plant was the great training .school of the Pacific Coast for shipyard and .shop workers, marine en- gineers and naval architects. In those days practically everything that went Bird's-eye view of the San Francisco Yard of the Union Plant of the Ship- building Division of the Bethlehem Steel Com- pany, Inc. Center fore- ground shows plate shop, welding racks and ship erection ways. into the ship was designed and built at this plant. Practically every ship that was delivered took out graduate ap- prentices as oilers, wipers or firemen, and these boys soon began to : pass their exams; get their tickets; and be- come marine operating engineers. Many a veteran American merchant marine chief, many a world-famous naval architect and many a professor of engineering got his initial inspira- tion at the old Union Iron Works. Today, as the illustrations show, this plant has been thoroughly modernized to adapt it to the new technique in hull fabrication and assembly. A complete description of this reconditioning was published in Pacific Marine Review for October, 1938. The Union Plant includes not only the Potrero Works (old Union Iron Works) but also the Hunter's Point graving dock, the Alameda Works and the repair yard and docks at East -San Pedro, Los Angeles harbor. It is thus the most extensive and complete ship- building and ship repair plant on the West Coast. A. S. Gunn, general manager of the Union Plant, joined the Union Iron Works as a shipfitter's helper in 1893. When the Kisdon Iron Works, an- other pioneer San Francisco firm, de- cided to enter shipbuilding in 1901, Mr. Gunn went to this new yard as foreman shipfitter. In 1911, when the new yard was absorbed by Bethlehem, he came back with it and was .soon promoted assistant general manager under the late great Joseph Tynan. When Mr. Tynan retired in 1933, A. S. Gunn became general manager of the Union Plant. Here, again, we have a unique situa- ation among American shipyards. \\'ery few Awards can boast a chief ex- ecutive who has come right up from the bottom in the plant of which he is manager. Mr. Gunn knows intimately every pha.se of shipbuilding. From practical experience he knows the problems confronting every one of his key executives, and is thus in a posi- tion to intelligently direct the policy and a]jpraise the effect in any given situation. The Shipyard All structures, crane ways and in- dustrial trackage in the shipyard are so located that the material in process of fabrication moves through the vari- ai T^H^iOH, Plant ojj lietlU^U^4ft Above, the plate yard and crane, the plate shop and mold loft across the in- shore end of shipbuilding ways. At left, large plate bending rolls; and be- low, new large press brake; both in plate shop. These two tools are said to be the largest of their type on the Pacific Coast. Below, two views in the machine shop, featuring large special planers, boring mills, drill presses and lathes. This shop is notable for the lavish provision of overhead traveling cranes of large capacity. <jiis shops in natural secjuence and in as close to a straight line movement as possible. This is true of the line from steel plate and shape storage racks through the plate shop, and sub-assembly spaces to the building ways. It is also true of movement of material and equipment through either the machine shop, the forge shop, the niill-pattern- joiner shop, or the pipe and copper shop to either the building ways or the outfitting docks. Material Handling .Ml railroad track curves are care- fully lined up and the curvatures re- duced to a minimum inside radius of 120 feet. All dock and yard surfaces are graded level and surfaced with a bituminous macadam pavement. For surface movement of materials, a fleet of gasoline drive tractors is used with special trailers built to Bethlehem design and specifications. The axles of these trailers run in roller bearings and the wheels are fitted with punc- ture proof pneumatic tires. Each trailer is designed for a load of 4,000 pounds, will take 5,000 pounds safely, and so loaded can easily be pushed along a level pavement by one man. Each of the three shipbuilding ways is .served by two 15-ton capacity over- head cranes traveling on elevated run- ways. By an ingenious use of 3 equal- izer girders four cranes can be hitched together and will handle -10 tons to any part of the 3 ways. The elevated runways carrying the cranes have a length of 420 feet and a width of 86 feet between centers of runways. Ves- sels 500 feet overall length and 65 foot beam could be built here. For heavier weights there is a 100-ton sheer legs at the outfitting basin. Power Distribution In order to make this yard inde- pendent a complete steam power plant has been installed in a separate power house. Two water tube boilers are used, each having a rated capacity of 350 horsepower and each being capable of continuous operation under a load of 7()() horsepower. These boilers are equipped with Bethlehem-Dahl com- bination gas and oil burners fitted with automatic firing control. Normally the burners use natural gas. If for any reason natural gas supplv fails, the burners can \\>e changed over to oil fuel in a few minutes. Three air compressors with a com- bined capacity of 1700 cubic feet of free air per minute are installed in this new power house. In order to facilitate connection, in- .spection, maintenance, and repairs, a pipe trench of reinforced concrete was inst.illed in a loop encircling the en- lire yard. The various pipe lines, in- cluding fresh and salt water, hydraulic service, pneumatic service, natural gas and fuel oil services, are carried on hangers on each side of this trench. Electric power is distributed through panels of the large 440-volt sizes, with several features of special design for this installation. Artificial lighting for the entire plant is by lighting fixtures of the Holophane Prismatic Reflector type. These fixtures are installed in suffi- cient quantity to give practical day- light illumination over every part of the floors in all shops, with elimina- tion of all objectionable shadows. Ample overhead crane capacity is installed and in each shop the storage of raw materials is adjacent to the shop and arranged so that materials may be handled into the shop and to each tool by the system of overhead cranes. Notable in this respect is the large new forge shop. Here the overhead cranes run right out over the bloom storage yards and deliver the blooms direct to the furnaces. Recognition of the trend toward welding in ship hull assembly is evi- dent in the rearrangement of the Union Plant. Regulations now require that all welders employed on either naval or merchant marine construc- tion shall be certified b}' the Navy De- jiartment or the Department of Com- merce. In order to create a supply of such qualified welders a welding school was started at the Potrero Works sev- eral jears ago. The large welding slab of heavy steel channel construction is located on the west side of the building ways with ample rf)om for sub-assembly and is served liy the elevated crane ways alongside the ways. There are nine 1,000-ampere, 65- volt, multiple operator welding gen- erator .sets installed. The entire ship- building way superstructure is wired for cf)nveniently-located outlets, where portable resistor reactor houses ma\\- be plugged in to serve welders on the job. Seventy-five of these portable re- sistor reactor houses are kept in good working condition. Each generator set will supply power to 15 welders. At the Union Plant, the plate shop follows the usual practice as to loca- tion and arrangement, lying across the in.shore end of the building slips and lieing of two-story construction, with the mold loft and scrive board on the upper floor. In the trend toward welded in place of riveted joints in ships' hulls, punch- ing machines are becoming less impor- tant and the plate planers more impor- tant as plate shop tools. Hydraulic power is used consider- ably in this shop, and the hydraulic pumps and accumulator are therefore located in the shop .so as to have the advantage of .short high-pressure lines. All furnaces in this shop use natural gas firing. Notable among the tools recently in- stalled is the huge press brake. This tool, with a die length of 18'-8\" and a die stroke of 4 inches, has a pres- sure rating of 900 tons maximum. On actual tests it has bent ^\" mild steel 14 feet long to an inside radius of 1 inch on a pres.sure of 450 tons. Another new and very useful tool is the Travograph with attachments. This machine is for flame cutting automatically to template. Notable among the new tools in the new forge and blacksmith shop are the new bar shear and the two new pneumatic, electric motor drive, self- contained hammers. Two new box type heat treating furnaces in this shop are interesting. The large an- nealing furnace has capacity to take the largest and longest line or tail shaft sections. Its length may be divided in 3 by two portable partitions and the gas firing arrangement and control is such that any one of the sections may be used without heating the others or all may be used simul- taneously with differing temperature ranges under perfect control. The.se furnaces were built by Bethlehem. Thus it wall be seen that the San Francisco Yard of the Union Plant of the Shipbuilding Division of Bethlehem Steel Company, Inc., is ready to build and equip ships of the C-1 type, and to take care of machinerjr installation on ships of larger sizes, the hulls of which could be erected at the Alameda ^'ard. .1 A N L A R ■^ D.

Roach, vice president in charge of Shipbuilding Division PACIFIC MARINE REVIEW CORPORATION LTD. FOUR C-I CARGO VESSELS Main gateway at Consolidated plant, Los Angeles Consolidated Steel Corporation, Ltd., of Los Angeles, California, have contracted to build four C-1 cargo ves- sels for the United States Maritime Commission, and are well advanced on the ])rosecuting of engineering and construction work preparatory to the actual fabrication and assembly of the vessels. The hull and engineering drawings are being prepared by George .Shar]), consulting ship designer, of New York City, under the direct supervision of W. E. SpolTord, retained by Consol- idated as naval architect, and Captain Harrv B. Hird, retained as chief en- gineer. I'^ahrication of the steel for the ships will be i)erformed at the Los Angeles fabricating plant, and the fabricated steel will be hauled 1)\\ truck and r;iil \\ ^ff^ twelve miles to the Craig yard at Long Beach for assembly. Prior to bidding, arrangements were made with the Craig Shipbuilding Company to lease their ways, sufficient property and out- fitting dock for assembling, launching and outfitting the ships. Similar to other recent shipbuilding operations, as much prefabrication as is possible will be done at the fabricating plant and at the ways prior to assembly. At present, the ways at the Craig yards are being rehabilitated to accommo- date construction of the vessels under contract. These ways are side launch- ing ways, which, during the last Euro- pean conflict, were used for the con- struction of submarines for the United States Navy and 8,000-ton cargo boats for the United States Shipping Board. .\"^^Mice then the yard has launched Lloyd Earl, vice president, in charge o( production many fine yachts, ferries and coast- wise freight and passenger steamers. The ways at present are serviced by a ten-ton express gantry crane com- pletely spanning the ways. In addition to this crane, there is being installed a new forty-five-ton American Hoist Revolving Gantry Crane to handle the heavy welded prefabricated assemblies. A mold loft building 70 by 280 ft. has been constructed at Consolidated's fabrication plant in Los Angeles. Shipbuilding Division Formed The executive management of the shipbuilding division is being handled by the present executives of the com- pany. Many of the operations in con- nection with the shipbuilding ])roject are so closely related^ to the present activities of the company that it has always been the intention of the man- agement to absorb this new venture into the rest of the operations as in- timately as possible. Accordingly, no subsidiary company was formed ; merely a new division was set up in a manner similar to other divisions of the company, such as structural, ])late, mechanical, reinforcing steel and light shop divisions. However, the ship- building division has been strongly augmented by a number of men out- standing in the field of shipbuilding. The following are the executi\\e officers of Consolidated Steel Cor- poration, Ltd.: D. G. Henderson, president ; Alden G. Roach, execu- tive vice president ; Lloyd R. Earl, vice president.

Machinery and Equipment The propulsion machinery will in- clude two Babcock and Wilcox marine type water tube boilers, burning oil under forced draft and delivering steam at 450 pound gage pressure anrl 750° F. temperature to a Westing- house cross compound, double reduc- tion gear marine turbine which, on normal rating, will deliver 4,CX50 shaft horsepower at 90 r.p.m. of the single screw pro])eller shaft. The turbines are to be capable of continuous operation at 10 per cent overload and two hours' operation at 25 per cent overload. Two Westinghouse steam turbine generat- ing sets each of 250 K.W. capacity will furnish electric power for the auxiliaries. It is expected that the fuel consumption at 14 knots sea speed will approximate 166 barrels per 24 hours. Complete fire detection and extin- guishing system will cover all cargo spaces. All furniture, partitions and joiner work in passenger and crew ac- commodations is to be of incombustible material.

Moore, president, and Harry Fawke, superinendent of hull construction, Moore Dry Dock Company Sea Star as she will appear when finished. Moore Dry Dock Company On Maritime Commission C-js On December 22 the Moore Dry Dock Company of Oakland launched their second C-3 cargo carrier for the Maritime Commission. This vessel was christened Sea Star. Her sister, Sea Arrow, was launched from the same ways on September 15, and the keel of Sea Star was laid September 19. Sixty-three working days thereafter. Sea Star was ready for launching. This type of record shows very fine coordination and cooperation between management, materials and men on the job. To do this job of work in this space of time means that every diffi- culty has been ironed out by a master of diplomacy and tact who knows ship construction from the keel up. It means also that the flow of materials and the disposition of the personnel have been coordinated with great skill and splendid patience. The answer to the question, \"What makes things click at Moore's yard?\" lies chiefly in two personalities, Joseph A. Moore, president of the firm, and Harry Fawke, its superintendent of hull construction. For thirty-three years these two men have worked to- gether as shipbuilders. Their mutual respect and cooperative skill have grown continuously during those three decades. This compatability is well illustrated by the story of the final selection of the launching date for Sea Star. The date had been set for December 29 after a consultation between the heads of the firm. A few days later, Harry Fawke, meeting Mr. Moore in the yard, said to him, \"Joe, I don't like your launching date.\" \"Why not?\" said Mr. Moore. \"Well,\" said Mr. Fawke, \"I've got to go down and have Christmas with my family in Arizona, and I just don't think I could do it comfortably unless that ship is in the water before I go.\" \"Can you have her ready a week earlier?\" asked Mr. Moore. \"Sure!\" opined Harry; \"very easily.\" \"All right,\" agreed Mr. Moore ; \"we'll make it the 22nd.\" And that's the way they have been getting along for thirty-three years. The shi])building record of those three decades is an impressive one. Sea Star is Hull Number 196. In- cluded in this number series are fer- ries, dredge hulls, barges, bridge cais- sons, cargo carriers, tankers. The list includes the largest cargo carriers and the finest ferries ever built on the Pa- cific Coast, and the largest bridge caisson ever built by a shipyard. As the Moore Shipbuilding Com- pany, this firm built many large cargo carriers for the U. S. Shipping Board, and during that shipbuilding boom period this firm was operating eight shipbuilding ways. Three of these ways were 600 feet in length, and the company was ready to bid on any ves- .sel then under contemplation by the U. S. .Shipping Board or by the U. S. Navy. At the peak, the Moore -Shipbuilding Company had over 13, OCX) men on the pay roll.' On December 20, 1919, this yard staged a world's record in ship launchings by putting overboard six large vessels in 52 minutes. These comprised three tankers, each of 10,- (XX) tons deadweight capacity, and three cargo vessels, each of 9,400 tons deadweight capacit)'. During the twelve calendar months of 1919 the Moore Shipbuilding Com- pany delivered to the U. .S. .Shi])ping Board 13 vessels, with an aggregated deadweight tonnage capacity of 122,- <S(X) tons. JANUARY, 1940 In ihe five years from 1917 to 1921, inclusive, this yard expanded from a one way, one dockyard, to a plant with eight building ways, three floating docks, two marine railways and ade- quate shops, and during this expansion period delivered sixty-two hulls, ag- gregating 563,755 tons of deadweight capacity. So much for their past historj', to show that records for ship steel fabri- cation and erection are not new to the Moore shipyard, but are naturally in- herent to the organization which oper- ates that plant. Of course, there are many other key men in the Moore organization to whom great credit is due for the fine work being done in that yard. How- ever, the.se men are all in the key spots because they cooperate 100 per cent with the big cooperators, Joe and Harry, and so the work all flows swiftly and smoothly to its appointed end, and the job is turned out in rec- ord time. Even this whole-hearted coopera- tion would be of little avail in produc- ing records in modern shipbuilding were it not for the skill with which the layout of the Moore shipbuilding facil- ities was planned and the great care given to supply adequate equipment for all the necessary operations. After Moore executives had care- fully surveyed the modern technique of ship erection by large welded as- semblies as practiced in Atlantic Coast shipyards, they were impressed with the value to this method of large open space close to the erecting ways for welding operations. Consequently, the new building way was designed with portal gantry trackage on both sides and located in the center of a large open space. This layout allows simul- taneous welding of several large as- semblies, and continuous and efficient u.se of several large gantry cranes. We have already described in these columns the Unionmelt welding pro- cess as used in this yard. The welding racks on each side of the erecting ways are supplied with numerous out- lets for welding sets to supply the proi)er current to these automatic welding machines. On these racks both flame cutting and welding operations are carried out with machine pre- cision, and the crane service is such that welded complete bulkhead or in- ner bottom assemblies weighing from 25 to 45 tons are spotted with pre- cision and tack welded to the erected hull in less time than it takes to tell about it. Prior to taking the contract for these vessels, Moore Dry Dock Com- pany had built and equipped the finest steel fabrication shop on the Pacific Coast. The automatic duplication mul- tiple punches installed in this shop have been very advantageously used in duplicate work on ships' plates and shapes. The tools in the already well- ef|uipped machine shop have been sup- plemented by the installation of mod- ern heavy boring mills, lalhes and planers. The plate shop, the mold loft, the bending slabs and their furnaces, the blacksmith shop, the pipe shop, the coppersmith shop, the pattern and joiner shop and the brass foundry are all well equipped and efficiently func- tioning factors in this record-breaking establishment. There are many noted iron found- ries in the .San Francisco Bay area, and the Columbia Steel division of the U. S. Steel Corporation is tops in pro- ducing large steel castings, such as the stem and stern frames of these large cargo carriers. So the Moore Dry Dock Company, equipped and organized, is again mak- ing Pacific Coast shipbuilding history. The good ship Sea Arrow is con- siderably ahead of her schedule, and is now waiting for machinery deliv- eries. Above, stem view of Sea Star ready for launching. Note the beautifully-molded run aft. Apparently her oil burners need adjust- ment. Below, a view in the structural steel shop at Moore's showing the big automatic spacing punch busy on bottom shell plating for the Sea Star. J A N U A R -i , 19 4 0 Seattle - Tacoma Great Shipyard R. J. LAMONT PneAident, and WALTER L. GREEN Vice Pne4^ide*d and QeneAol Manacf£^ Seattle-Tdcomd Shipbuilding Corp. 0^ Pi4Xfei S0444iJl Shipbuilding Corporation's To Be Completed February 1st By CHARLES F. A. MANN U. S. scout cruiser Omaha, built by Todd's Tacoma yard in 1921, was speed champion in her class. With less than ten weeks elapsed lime between the pouring of footing blocks and leveling operations on the outer end of the historic site of the former huge Todd shipyard at Ta- coma, to finished shipyard, somewhat of a record in construction projects has been made at the new plant of the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp. Since the completion of the South- ern I'acific steamer Bienville in 1924, the World War Todd plant at Tacoma has become a huge industrial district. Two large California oil companies and a great electrochemical plant oc- cu[)y one rim of the tract. The vast mold loft building used for war-time shi]) layouts became a factor}' located just west of the world's largest door factory. However, the prize section of the whole Todd tract, lying at the ex- treme outer end of the land, between Hylebos and -Sitkuni waterway, com- prising about 70 acres of dry land and about the same acreage of hard tide- land, has been permanently reserved for the new Todd-sponsored shipyard. Water 300 feet deep just a .ship's length from the end of the new 500- ft. building ways, with V/i miles of open sound beyond, provide an ideal site for a great steel shi])yaril. The new Seattle-Tacoma yard is headed by R. J. Lamont, able i)resi- dt-nt of the Todd-Seattle Drydocks, Inc., a unit of Todd .Shipvard C\"<)ri). J. A. MacEachern, of General Con- struction Co., is vice-president. Gen- eral Construction tindertook to build the entire shipyard at Tacoma in less than 90 days, and at the time of writ- ing this (January 5) there are over 450 men at work rushing the plant to completion well inside the time limit. The entire tract has been fenced; every piece of water, compressed air and steam pijjing, and all A. C. and D. C. electric wiring and telephone conduit have been placed underground, with convenient surface outlets. A mile of broad roadway within the plant is being paved with heavy asphaltic con- crete laid on a thick crushed rock mat. These preparations are of great inter- est, as indicating a permanent set-up that does not bode early closing. Construction of the buildings has been done entirely with heavy Douglas iir timbers, using the latest types of timber trusses, developed to increase the unsupported spans. Use of wood is natural at Tacoma, because of the heavy clears that are selected from 14 lumber mills b_v a centralized purchas- ing agency and delivered as needed for each j)hase of the job. I-'irst building to be completed was the mold loft-shop-storeroom building. This is 130 x 260 feet in overall size, two stories high. A curved Summer- I'ell trussed roof, entirely of wood, gi\\es a ck-ar width in the mold loft of 130 feet and the full length of 260 feet, with extremely shallow roof trusses. The entire building is pro- tected with .sprinkler system, and is lighted by floodlights every 15 feet. A heavy tongue and grooved floor laid on a 45-degree angle gives a smooth lay- out surface for the patterns, both hard and verv light-colored. The lower floor of this building is given over to store- rooms, general .shops for the pipe fit- ters, electricians, riggers and machin- ists, and large locker space for em- ployees. Dunham hot water units with electric fan circulation are used to heat the entire structure. The building has an easy ramp leading to the second floor, and is painted a green-gray color that will not turn chalky. The Parker Painting Company, contractors for painting Tacoma Narrows Bridge, has the contract for painting the buildings in the yard. .\\ small building to the North of the main grou]) houses the oil-fired auto- matic hot water heating plant. .\\ large 2-story office building has been moved from ,'^eattle via barge and set up on new concrete foundations. This office structure was finished Jan- uary 5, and the staft' moved in from .\"Seattle and New York Januar}' 8. .Across the main entrance roadway to the West is the steel fabrication build- ing layout. One s])ace is 50 x 2(X) feet, and there are four fabricating bays JANUARY, 1940 Three views showing remarkable ■ progress made by the General Construction Co., who undertook to complete this entire shipyard in 90 days. Upper, a general view, showing huge mold loft and shop building at left, skele- ton of plate shop at right, crane track foundation center fore- ground, and inshore comer of No. 1 way at lower right comer. Left, a close-up of mold loft. Bottom, general view of water- front, showing inshore end of two ways, unfinished crane piers, and, in foreground, welding fab- rication platform. K| ■ ' -■''iv each 50 x 150 feet. An indoor assem- bly platform 80 x 360 ft. is provided with overhead cranes throughout. All machinery for handling steel plates rests on concrete overlaying deep- driven piling. Directly in front of the steel shed are the first two shipways, two ways each nearly 500 feet long with a crane- way between. The ways are entirely open, due to favorable climatic condition prevailing throughout the year, and between the upper end of the ways and the steel fabrication building is an outdoor as- sembly platform 80 x 360 ft. Three Clyde 40-ton Whirley cranes operate on the tracks between the shipways. While only two ways are to be used to start off construction of the first 5 C-1 full scantling ships, provision for ten more ways can be arranged later if necessary. The original reinforced concrete power substation, built in 1917, alone remains as the survivor of 1930 wreck- ing operations. This heavy building is 34 X 42 feet, and will have two 300- KV'A motor generator .sets for direct current {)Ower for the Whirley cranes and cranes in the steel shed. Capacity for 2,500 KVA is provided. Electric power is provided by Ta- coma's municipal system at 3,000 volts A. C. Electric power will be important in this yard, as the majority of the joints in these ships will be electrically welded. To begin with, thirty 300-amp. portable welding sets and six Union- melt automatic welders of the latest design have been ordered. Provision has been made to handle steel via rail or water. The plant is equipped to turn out finished hulls at a high rate of pro- duction, being ideally located and com- I)actly arranged. The first five ships will be launched and towed to Seattle for installation of machinery at the Todd Seattle plant. Steel for the new ships will begin arriving about January 20, and the first keel laying is expected about Feb- ruary 20. Each ship will he twin screw, with two Hooven - Owens - Rentschler 2- cycle, 6-cylinder diesels, each develop- ing 2,100 h. p. at 233 r. p. m. and geared to one propeller shaft through Westinghouse electro dynamic coup- lings and reduction gearing. They will drive the propeller at 90 r. p. m. for a ship .speed of 14 knots. The Seattle plant of the Todd Seattle Dry Docks, Incorporated, is an important cog in the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation building plans. Hulls erected in the great shipyard at Tacotna will be towed across to this plant on the Seattle waterfront for machinery and equipment installation. The San Vincente, a Todd-built ship, is here shown on a Todd Seattle drydock for overhaul. Orders were placed in October for ten Washington diesels with the Wash- ington Iron Works at Seattle. Two of these engines will be installed in each ship for auxiliary electric power. The engines are the well known, reliable, 4-cycle, trunk piston type, developing 400 horsepower, and having 6 cylin- ders. Walter L. Green will be vice-presi- dent and general manager, and O. A. Tucker will be assistant to Mr. La- ment. Big Propellers For Seattle Firm Four of the largest propellers ever made on the Pacific Coast will be built by the Doran Company of Seattle, fa- mous Coast projjeller builders, for the Moore Dry Dock Co. of Oakland, Calif., to be installed on the C-3 ships now building there. Each wheel will be 21 feet, 8 inches in diameter, and will weigh about 23 tons. They are four- bladed bronze proi)ellers, and the molds in which they will be cast are made from jxitterns built entirely of Western red cedar. The big wheels are shipped on the deck of coastwise steamers and unloaded directly at the shipyard. Columbia River Tug Keith Finished The world's first diesel \"open river\" tug has been finished at Portland by the Commercial Iron Works for oper- ation between the upper end of The Dalles-Cellilo Canal to Umatilla in the open, wild Columbia River, a distance of about 100 miles. The new tug is of welded steel, and is 92.6 x 25.6 x 6.6 feet and is of shallow draft, with twin tunnels for the propellers. The power is twin diesel engines deliver- ing maximum i>ower at 500 r. p. m., of the new Enterprise light-weight de- sign mounted on Korfund Vibro Mats. Later the.se engines will be supercharged with P>uchi turbo blow- ers, deriving power from the exhaust ga.ses. L'nder supercharging, the total power from both engines will be 2500 S. H. P. This tug is designed to suc- cessfully handle large tows in river currents up to 9 knots. She has pneu- matic rudders with three comi)lete sets of pUot h(nise engine controls and rud- der controls. She is named after the son of Capt. A. Lepiialuto, general manager of the comi)any and skipper of tlic tug. J A N LI A R Y H. G. TALLERDAY Western Pipe & Steel Company PACIFIC MARINE REVIEW At South San Francisco Western Pipe &: Steel Company Recreate Their Former Schaw-Batcher Side-Launching Shipyard There were many shipyards on San Francisco Bay in the hectic \"Bridge- of-Ships\" days of the U. S. Shipping Board war-time program. AH of these yards built good steel vessels, and sev- eral of them made national records for speed in turning out finished ships. However, among these yards there was one that attracted special atten- tion for several reasons : First, this yard was located on a basin at the edge of a tidal tlat far removed from deep water, and con- nected thereto by a long channel ; Second, this yard was the only yard in the Bay region to launch its vessels sidewise ; and Third, the vessels built in this yard seem to have been selected by the U. S. Shipping Board for experimen- tation in the art of camouHage. With many of these steamers in their war paint, it was hard to tell whether they were coming or going, right side up or upside down. This was the Western Pipe & Steel Co.'s plant at South San Francisco, which was operated under the name of the Schaw-Batcher Shipyard. After the war shipbuilding was completed, this firm enlarged the main sho]) building into one of the largest steel pipe fabricating plants on the West Coast and equipped this plant especially for fabrication by welding. Some of the largest pipe contracts of recent years have come to this plant for fabrication. Here, too, an occa- sional steel barge or dredge hull was fabricated, which kept the plant in some touch with floating equipment. When the U. S. Maritime Commis- sion called for bids on the C-1 type cargo ves.sels, Western I'ipe and Steel Company made a tender. The result was a contract to build five C-1 type full scantling motorships. Preparing the Yard To meet the terms of this contract, Western Pipe & Steel Company of California have rebuilt two side launching ways on the West side of the basin, which will enable them to build two C-ls simultaneously. The contract calls for delivery of the first ship in 15 months from Nov. 15, 1939, effective date of contract, and one ship each 60 days thereafter. The two ways will be sufficient to meet these dates. Should more contracts develop, the two ways on the East side of the basin will be rebuilt. Two new Colby full revolving ship cranes are being installed to handle large welded assemblies and heavy machinery installation. A mold loft and bending slabs have been prepared, and a large opening welding rack ar- ranged adjacent to the shore end of building ways. Steel for the first ship is en route, and it is expected that the first keel will be laid in February. Western Pipe & Steel Company is a well-organized, smoothly-func- tioning firm. They have handled suc- cessfully some of the largest contracts for steel fabrication and erection in Western America. They should have no difficulty in finishing these vessels and in producing trial trip results sat- isfactory to the Maritime Commission. The Ships to be Built The ships are specifically classed by the Commission as C-1 B. D., i. e., Commission-designed steel cargo ves- sels of the C-1 size and the full scant- ling type driven by diesel engines. Each of these vessels will recjuire: Fabrication and erection of 2,365 tons of ship steel in the hull ; The preparation anrl installation of 768 tons of equipment, outfit and rig- ging; and The manufacture and installation of 600 tons of machinery. Specified Equipment Specifications call for such items as: Twelve standard five-ton cargo booms and one 50-ton cargo boom, served by 12 electric cargo winches; A forced system of ventilation for all cargo spaces; A complete smoke detection and CO2 fire extinguishing system ; Full radio equipment of the most modern type ; All furniture and all joiner work to be of incombustible materials ; A modern, sanitary, stainless steel trimmed galley fitted with all electric cooking devices ; and A power plant giving 4,000 shaft horsepower at 90 r.p.m. of the pro- peller shaft and producing a main- tained sea speed of 14 knots or better. Propulsion Machinery The diesel power plant of each of the five ships building at the yard of Western Pipe and Steel Company will consist of two six-cylinder directly re- versible 2100 shaft horsepower Busch Sulzer diesel engines, each connected through a hydraulic ship coupling to one of the pinions of a single reduc- tion gear. The slow speed gear of this reduction set is connected directly to the propeller line shafting. These engines must be able to oper- ate continu(nisly at 10 per cent over- load and for two hours at 25 per cent overload. Fresh water will be circulated for cylinder cooling purposes, and will it- self be cooled bv salt water in a heat JANUARY, 1940 Side launching at South San Francisco in the U. S.

Prac- tically all auxiliaries will be operated by General Electric motors, and elec- tric power will be distributed and con- trolled through and by General Elec- tric equipment. In the pumping equipment, Warren, Worthington, Nash and Quinby are all represented. Refrigeration machinery is by Car- rier. The Markey Machinery Company of Seattle are manufacturing the wind- lass and the capstans for each vessel. American Hoist and Derrick Com- pany will build the cargo winches. The steering gear will be made by Lidgerwood. The Doran Company of .Seattle will cast the big bronze propellers. Among the navigation equipment will be found : Sperry gj'ro compass, gyro pilot, rudder indicators, and searchlights ; Submarine Signal Com- pany fathometers ; Radio Marine Cor- poration transmitting and receiving sets. This list shows the manner in which the liuilding of these vessels will bene- fit many manufacturing plants thou- sands of miles removed from the ship- yard, and how widespread is the re- ceipt of wages due to a shipbuilding contract. Sydney Office, United Air Lines Because of the increased air travel from the Orient and the Antipodes, United Air Lines is establishing a branch office in Sydney, Australia, it was announced recently by S. A. Stimpson, regional traffic manager. Heading the office will be Edward H. Forrest, formerly with the Mat- son Navigation Company, and for the past three years manager of L^nited's foreign travel department, with headquarters in San Francisco. Accompanying him on the trip will be Huck Longfellow, veteran Dol- lar Steamship executive, who has been LInited's European travel man- ager, with headquarters in London, until a short time ago, when the war curtailed his activities. Forrest flew to Los Angeles on December 1 to embark on the Mat- sonia for Honolulu, where he met Longfellow, who left San Francisco on the Pan American clipper on December 5. Together, the two sailed on the S.S. Mariposa for Syd- ney, Australia, and a year's exten- sive tour of Australia, New Zealand, the Dutch East Indies, China, Japan and Manila. At the end of that time Longfellow will return to London, should war conditions permit, and Forrest will be left in charge of the Australian office. Improved Red Lead Linseed Oil Paint A substantial speed-up in drying re- sults through the modification of red lead-linseed oil paints by the replace- ment of approximately 3 pounds of red lead with Leafed Metallic Lead Paste per gallon of paint. The Metalead Products Corpora- tion, .San Francisco, manufacturers of the Leafed Metallic Lead Paste, fur- ther state that the incorporation of this paste will totally eliminate top coat crawl, even when using a following coat of high surface tension. Especially noticeable is the absence of pigment separation over rivet heads and awa\\- from sharp corners and edges of structural steel. Another fea- ture is improved adhesion to the metal. If the paint is applied by spray, greater ease of application will be ob- tained because of better coverage and the absence of running or sagging. In brush applications the painter will find greater ease of brushing and spreading less tiresome. Whether applied by spray or brush, a flat, uniform finish is obtained. This paste may be added to ready- mixed red lead-linseed oil paint ; or the modified red lead-metallic lead-linseed oil paint, ready-mi.xed, may be secured through nearl\\- all suppliers of red lead linseed oil paints. tuNKENHElMER Change of Masters -Stmr.

A (; I F I C M A R 1 N K REVIEW & jb^ ^ocJz Qa. Maintains Engineering Plant in San Francisco And Complete Shipyard On Oakland Estuary The equipment and facilities main- tained at San Francisco and on the Oakland Estuary- by the General Engi- neering & Dry Dock Co., and the ex- perience and initiative of the execu- tives of this firm, have combined to produce an organization that has be- come a verj- potent factor in the fields of marine repairs and shipbuilding. On the San Francisco side, this firm has a compact group of very well- equipped shops capable of handling all marine and machinery repairs and overhaul. These shops are located a .short block from the famous Embar- cadero of .^an Francisco's waterfront. F. H. Fox, chief engineer. and have excellent spur track connec- tions to all transcontinental railways and to all piers through the waterfront belt line. Buildings include : machine shop, fully equipped with the most modern precision tools for producing perfect finish to exact dimensions; carpenter shop, equipi)ed to produce the finest of ship joiner work ; pipe shop, tooled for cutting, threading, welding and bending all sizes of marine pipes and tubes; plate and boiler shop, fitted with every device necessary to bend, shear, punch, plane, rivet or weld ship and boiler plating; forge shop, capable of jjroducing the best in ship forgings; anfi pattern shop, in which patterns for the most intricate castings can be pro- duced economically by experienced craftsmen. On the Oakland Estuarj% General Engineering & Dry Dock Co. maintain and ojjcrate a fully-equipped shipyard on the Alameda shore of Oakland's inner harbor. Here the firm owns twentx' acres, with a fine frontage on deep water. This vard is well equipi)ed with two tloating docks, three shipbuilding ways, and ample shops, fitted with efficient t()ol> and machinery. Here have been built many good hulls, including such t\\pes as Coast Guard cutters, small coasting steamers, large auto and pas- senger ferries, dredges and barges. The site has been operated as a ship- yard for many vears, and here, in the George A. Annes, president. nineties, were built many fine wooden hulls for lumber schooners, South Sea traders, whalers and coastw'ise cargo ships. The General Engineering organiza- tion has attracted to itself many ac- tive and enterprising younger men in marine engineering and ship construc- tion work. Its president, George A. Amies, has had longer experience as the chief executive of shipbuilding and ship repair plants than any other Pa- cific Coast shipbuilder. With an excellent plant, and with an efficient, experienced organization to operate that plant. General Engi- neering is entering 1940 with confi- dence, and is looking forward to many good repair jobs and to very fine ])ros- pects for new construction contracts. The ways at their Alameda yard are of sufficient capacity to take C-1 cargo vessels, and could easily be enlarged for bigger hulls.

The Marine Engineer And His Books There have been so many letters like the following that we feel it desirable to interrupt our series on boiler feed water to cover the general question of books, particularly as selected for preparation for the new examinations. Sir: In looking through your magazine of late issue I find just what I am in- terested in, and that is, third engineer's license and all 1940 new questions and requirements, and notice you carry a line of books pertaining to these new requirements. If possible, could you send me a good book to study, payable on this end, or tell me the name and price so I can forward an order? Also, while I'm at it, I would like to subscribe to Pacific Marine Review for one year. Yours truly, F. B. Education from Books The books listed in the October is- sue are, as stated in the text, only a list of the books in the library of the Examination Section of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. They are not necessarily recommended by the Bureau or by \"The Chief.\" Each marine engineer is an individ- ual, each having different educational experiences and ability to learn. Each should have a special selection of books. Thus it is very difficult to rec- ommend to the profession in general. \"The Chief\" has had many years of experience in educational work with engineers, and recommends the books listed at the end of this article, which is repeating to a large extent what he has covered in this section from time to time in the past. Do not be misled to believe that hav- ing a lot of books, however good, will give you the education to pass the ex- amination. It is you who must put together the education. This requires a continuous effort, to set aside a reg- ular time, to study, work problems, create questions and dig to find the answers. Ship the Best Teacher The best educational inlluence you have is your ship. When on watch be curious about every part, every unit. Tell yourself all about it; or, better, explain it to someone junior to you. No one learns quite so much as the teacher. Do not let a question slip by. If necessary, make a note of it and dig out the answer in your own or in borrowed books. Read every technical article you can put your hands on. Develop a critical attitude toward your reading. Write to the magazine and debate a point you don't understand. Education is a process of fitting to- gether all of the many little bits of information you get into a common or whole fabric. It is like a jig-saw puz- zle. When completed, it forms a won- derful and beautiful picture. Many pieces will be found not to fit with what you already have. Perhaps they are not right — the information dis- torted. It must be straightened out. Think, puzzle, ponder, read, and think some more. With that attitude towards your work you will soon edu- cate yourself. A man who thinks and reasons will handle an indicator with more intelligent results, though never having seen or heard of one before, than a man who cannot or does not habitually think, but has watched its use and tried it many times. Auxiliary Books Do not think that you must read only marine engineering books. Ninety per cent of the information about ashore steam plants applies to marine plants. The differences are obvious. If you know the shore plant thoroughly, you know mo.st of the marine plant. Also, there are many important con- siderations about your job as a marine engineer that are not treated in tech- nical books. .Some of these are rules and regulations, duties, safely precau- tions of all kinds, character, bearing and demeanor of a merchant marine officer, and handling men. I'ACIFIC MAKINK RKVIEW Therefore, while any books on team engineering are a vahiable addi- tion to your hbrary, there should be added special publications by the Bu- reau, the Navy Department, manufac- turing and engineering firms. Also recommended are non-fiction books nther than engineering, such as biog- raphies of great men, travels and ex- ploration. Unless your education includes the equivalent of a college course, select books which are profusely illustrated with sketches and diagrams, first, be- cause .sketches are of great educational value; second, because that type of book will be written in less technical language and will be understandable. If you have a book not listed in this tabulation, use it; or if you have a chance to get one or a set, do so with- out regard to this list. For instance, books published by the large corre- spondence schools are excellent, but are not li.sted here because not ordi- narily obtainable. There are many worthwhile books not listed. The books listed have been selected not because they are necessarily recent or modern, but for their educational value. As a matter of fact, the modern high-pressure steam turbine marine plant has not yet been well covered in books. Modern engineering is recorded in magazines, pamphlets and advertise- ments for several years before it gets nto books. Ry all means read advertisements in the technical magazines. There is a tremendous educational value in them. Be curious about them; write to the firms and get their pamphlets and de- tails. Unlisted Books The books listed here are not all strictly marine. They are listed in no particular order, and are numbered. The various items are recommended by number in the tabulation. Not all books listed are referred to in the tab- ulation. The tabulation is an attempt to show what we feel the engineers hould have available. If properly read and studied, these books will add to your education and will constitute a valuable reference library. Literature not listed, but that every marine engineer should have, it Rules and Rc(iulations, Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. Obtain from nearest local examiner.

The cone and frustum being similar, and right (vertical) their base angles and hence slope of sides are equal. Re- ferring to the annexed diagram, let X = the full height of the cone of which the frustum is part. Then. by geometry, the height and diame- ter will be in direct proportion, and the solution is developed in equation (2) herewith. Diagram I. The next problem is interesting, and \"The Skipper\" admits he had to look up the text book to refresh his memory before solving it. 3. (Dynamics). Two bodies, nearly in the same vertical line, are dropped, the higher six seconds be- fore the lower. The height from which the higher is dropped is twice the height from which the lower is dropped. Find the heights if tht-y reach the ground together. For the benefit of such as may have forgotten, a body dropped ac- celerates at the rate of 32.2 feet per second, due to the force of gravity.

Letting g = gravity, t — time and h = height, the final velocity is then g X t or V = gt at the end of t sec- onds. Its average velocitv through- 0 + gt out the fall is or J/2 gt, and height is obviously velocity multi- plied by time or h = J4gt X t or 3-4 gt^ As J^g is constant, it is evi- dent that the height varies as the square of the time. Put into alge- braic form the solution is worked out as in equation (3) herewith. Xow, you up and coming mari- ners, get busy and brush up on your mathematics and physics! Solution From Correspondent After the foregoing notes were writ- ten and just on the eve of going to press, \"The Skipper\" received a wel- come letter from C. H. of San Fran- cisco, and wishes to acknowledge it in this issue. Commenting on his remarks about problem No. 2, in which he stated the principle involved most ac- curately, but admitted he was \".stymied\" by the lack of an upptr diameter for the frustum, he will be interested to see \"The Skipper's\" maneuver to obtain it.

Our illustrations show two shop views of the De Laval main propulsion turbines for the C-3 type cargo liners now building at the Moore Dry Dock Company to be allotted to the round- the-world services of the American President Lines. The main propulsion unit on these vessels comprises a high and a low- pressure turbine cross compounded, and each connected through double re- duction mechanical gearing to a single propeller shaft. This unit is designed to deliver 8500 horsepower at 85 r.p.m. of the propeller, when sui)])lied at high pressure turbine inlet with steam at 440 pound gage pressure and 740° F. temperature, and when exhausting into a condenser maintaining 28.5\" of vacuum. On test the unit must be able to generate 10 per cent overload con- tinuously, and 25 per cent overload for two hours. The high pressure turbine of this unit has 1 1 stages, and operates nor- mally at 5012 revolutions per minute. The low ])ressure unit has .seven stages and three astern stages, and op- erates at 3459 revolutions per minute. In connection with these turbines, De Laval .Steam Turbine Company supplies also the double reduction gear sets. The low speed gear on these sets is among the largest ever installed on a cargo vessel. It has a pitch diameter of 153.75 inches, and is entirely of welded steel construction. Nine identical units of this descrip- tion are now in process of manufac- ture at the Trenton, New Jersey, shops of the De Laval .Steam Turljine C(jm- ]:;!n\\-. Fi\\e of these units are for hulls building at the Federal Shiy)buil(ling and Dry DocU Company, Kearny, New Jersey, and four for hulls build- ing at the Moore Dry Dock' Company, Oakland. Calif. Upper, welded steel low-speed gear wheel for C-3s: 153.75\" pitch diameter. Center, high-pressure turbine with cover removed. Lower, low-pressure turbine with cover removed. Ca^ ol Qg^u^ cd Sea ^ On New Export Cargo Liners The annual meeting of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine En- gineers at Xew York, December 1, 1938, introduced to the maritime world a masterly paper on the subject \"Care of Cargo at Sea.\" This paper re- viewed : the literature of the subject ; recent experiments in control of ven- tilation, tem]>eratures and humidity : and the practical applications leading to develo]jment of a new system and equipment known as the \"Colby-Colvin Cargocaire.\" This system was devel- oped during the past four years by the Cargocaire Division of the Research Department of the Colby Steel and Engineering Company, Seattle, Wash- ington. A full abstract of the jjaper \"Care of Cargo at Sea\" appeared in Pacific Marine Review beginning in the l-)ecember, 1938, issue and running serially to the issue for June, 19.V>. The i»ublicity given to this jiaper at- tracted so much attention and such a volume of inquiry that a sepanite or- ganization was set up to handle manu- facture and installation of the new sys- tem. This organization operates under the name Cargocaire I-\".ngineering Cor- poration, and has established an office and a technical staff in Xew York City. The U. .S. Maritime Commission is very much interestcfl in this devehjp- ment and has committed itself to the extent of advising all shipowners to make a careful investigation of its merits in connection with building new or rebuilding old tonnage. To the American Exjjort Lines of Xew York goes credit for the first in- stallation of this system on new over- seas cargo carriers. This firm has ordered Cargocaire installation on each of the eight new fast freighters now under construction at the Fore River Plant of the Shipbuilding Divi- sion of the Bethlehem Steel Conipanx'. After a careful study of the sul)ject in connection with the peculiar needs of their trade routes, the technical staff of the American Export Lines selected a somewhat simplified ar- rangement of the \"Cargocaire\" Sys- tem. Design and installation details were worked out with the engineering staffs of"
