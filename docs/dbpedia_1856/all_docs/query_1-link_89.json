Ross Environmental Research Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada DATE: 2003\n\nFor: U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, Alaska Outer Continental Shelf Region\n\nDESCRIPTION: This project was carried out and reported by Bercha International Inc. (Bercha), on subcontract to S.L. Ross Environmental Research Limited (SLR) the prime contractor to MMS for the project Persistence of Crude Oil Spills on Open Water. The objective of the project is to study the relationships between spill persistence and spill size, and to refine the spill persistence and size relationship in terms of other variables while providing possible predictive relationships such as cumulative distribution functions.\n\nEssentially, the approach utilized by Bercha following receipt of the spill data from SLR, was to inspect the data for possible approaches, identify a series of statistical and numerical methods which could be used to study the relationships among the principal data variables, apply these methods, select the most statistically significant approaches, and further utilize these approaches to generate certain predictive algorithms and results. P2203 RISK AND COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF UTILITY CROSSINGS OF ROADS\n\nCLIENT: Alberta Transportation DATE: 2002\n\nDESCRIPTION: As part of the decision making process on the possible requirement of casings on municipal utility pipes crossing roadways, a risk and cost benefit analysis input has been identified as a desirable input by Alberta Transportation. Generally, such a risk and cost benefit analysis will take into consideration the costs of initial installation and replacement, durability (lifetime), and unscheduled failures during the lifecycle and associated costs of repairs. All costs will include estimates of associated disruption costs. In relation to unscheduled failures, cost of consequences will include the repair of the utility, repair of possible damage to the roadbed and surface, and the costs of any traffic disruption including temporary traffic management and possible road closure.\n\nThe general approach to the work was to construct a risk-economic model which gives cost expectations in current dollars at their time of occurrence, and discounts them utilizing a net (of inflation) discount rate to present value.

Finally, levels of ISR for the proposed ATCO SEEP project were compared to other risks to which individuals are commonly exposed. P2103 CONCEPT SAFETY EVALUATION FOR THE ALMA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nCLIENT: Sable Offshore Energy Inc. (SOEI), Halifax, NS DATE: 2001\n\nDESCRIPTION: A Concept Safety Evaluation (CSE) of the conceptual design of the Alma development project was carried out. The work included data assimilation, general hazard identification, qualitative and quantitative risk assessment (QRA), review of safety and EER systems, and the generation of conclusions and recommendations. A range of hazards was considered in the risk assessment. This Concept Safety Evaluation for a development offshore Nova Scotia is regulated by the Nova Scotia Petroleum Directorate, and, as such, is one of the requirements the Directorate sets out as a condition for permits to proceed with such a development.\n\nThe risks to personnel were the primary focus of the risk evaluation, and both individual and collective risks were evaluated. Individual risks (IR), the actual risks to which individuals with different jobs are exposed, were quantified and compared to Target Levels of Safety (TLS) established for the project. Collective risks (CR) were quantified in terms of Potential Loss of Life (PLL), and assessed within the context of the as low as reasonably practicable (ALARP) principle. The IR TLSs were as follows: IR below 10-6 is negligible, IR between 10-6 and 10-3 is ALARP, and IR above 10-3 is intolerable.\n\nFigure 1: Rendering of Alma platform\n\nFigure 2: The study included a review of safety and EER systems.

P2011 STUDY OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PLACEMENT IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT\n\nCLIENT: Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) DATE: 2000-2001\n\nDESCRIPTION: The placement and location of hydrocarbon pipelines with respect to road geometries and cross sections can have an effect on the safety of the highway system and its users and adjacent residents, as well as operational and economic impacts on highway maintenance, construction, and modification activities. To assess these risks and impacts, the Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) commissioned Bercha Engineering Limited (Bercha) to conduct an in-depth, comprehensive study directed at generating a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the implications of locating pressurized natural gas pipelines in various locations within rural road right-of-ways. The study covered four primary representative road types together with their variations in ADDT, vehicle speed, and cross section, as well as three representative pipeline sizes and pressure categories for three different pipeline locations. The three pipeline locations consisted of one in the shoulder, one below the ditch, one just inside the edge of the right-of-way, and a fourth control location where the pipeline is away from the effects of the roadway. The method for systematically quantifying the risks to the public, considering the effects of the pipeline-roadway synergy, including effects on the pipeline failure rate as well as consequences of possible failure including ignition by vehicles, was developed and applied to each of the 108 generic cases. Both individual and collective risks and their variations for each of the different combinations were evaluated, and discussed. Similarly, economic impacts, including increases in the unit cost of common maintenance, construction, and reconstruction activities for the road operators were also identified. A series of conclusions and recommendations was generated, including definition of compatible and incompatible combinations of pipeline and location installations in terms of safety, cost, and constructibility; various risk and impact mitigation measures to enhance safety and reduce costs; and long-term approaches to optimize the situation. Although previous studies have been done on the use of common utility and transportation corridors, no comprehensive quantitative assessment of risks and economic impacts for representative combinations of road and pipeline characteristics has appeared previously, resulting in a significant volume of new observations and information available from the work reported herein. The report can be purchased online at the TAC bookstore. P2010\n\nALTERNATIVE OIL SPILL OCCURRENCE ESTIMATORS FOR THE BEAUFORT AND CHUKCHI SEAS\n\nCLIENT: Minerals Management Service, United States Department of the Interior DATE: 2000-2001\n\nDESCRIPTION: The project goals are to develop and apply alternative methodologies for the assessment of oil spill rates associated with exploration and production facilities and operations in deeper waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. The prediction of the reliability (or failure) of systems without history can be approached through a variety of mathematical techniques, the most preferable and accepted being fault trees, and their possible combination with secondary methods such as Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian statistics. Bercha International Inc. identified an optimal methodology for the prediction of oil spill rates for systems such as those operational or contemplated for the deeper waters of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in the Alaskan OCS, and is applying these together with an estimate of their statistical robustness to these systems in order to generate predictions of oil spill rates. The procedure will be applied for each of the principal facility and operation types for exploration and production operations in the study area.\n\nClick on the thumbnails to view enlarged images.\n\nFigure 1: General Study Area\n\nFigure 2: Work Flow Schematic\n\nP9709 SAFETY CASE FOR THE SABLE OFFSHORE ENERGY PROJECT\n\nCLIENT: Sable Offshore Energy Project DATE: 1997 - 2001\n\nDESCRIPTION: The Bercha Group was the prime contractor for the Concept Safety Evaluation and subsequent safety case of the Sable Offshore Energy Project, providing overall project management, conducting the CSE for all onshore facilities, as well as selected segments of the offshore facilities including the Straits of Canso crossing and ship/collision probability assessments associated with the offshore platforms.

Preliminary pipe stress analyses had suggested that these tees were over-stressed under certain conditions, but the margin was sufficiently narrow to warrant more detailed analysis of the tees. Finite element models of the pipe tees were developed using the commercial finite element package, Ansys. Models were developed using two forms of three-dimensional solid iso-parametric elements, and iso-parametric shell elements. Analyses were carried out for the previous operating conditions, and the proposed new operating conditions. The non-linear behaviour used was for material non-linearity only, using a von Mises yield criterion for the steel in the pipes. The results were input into a fatigue calculation using some estimated load cycles for the extreme load conditions. It was found that, on a single load cycle, some non-linearity did occur in the crotch of the tee, but that it was of very limited extent, Strain hardening was sufficient to limit stresses in subsequent cycles to the elastic range. It was concluded that the overall reliability of the pipe Tees was not compromised by the revised operating conditions.\n\nP9426\n\nNON-LINEAR FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF ICE RIDGE KEEL BEHAVIOUR\n\nCLIENT: Public Works Canada DATE: 1994-95\n\nDESCRIPTION: Non-linear finite element analyses of the interaction between the rubble in an ice ridge keel and a cylindrical\n\nstructure were undertaken. Analyses were carried out in both two- and three-dimensions. The rubble was modelled as a Mohr- Coulomb material with and without dilatancy. The structure was modelled as a rigid body, and the interface as either having, or not having, friction. The analysis was carried out assuming that there existed a continuous solid ice layer on the surface. Two forms of analysis were carried out: one in which the ice layer was made to fail against a sloping structure, and the other, in three dimensions, in which the ice layer was assumed to remain intact, but in which the ice rubble could slide along the underside of the ice layer. The rubble's natural buoyancy was modelled by appropriate mass density and accelerations. Each analysis was carried out by stepping the far-field of the ridge towards the structure in preset displacement steps, which the program automatically reduced as required to achieve equilibrium and convergence of the solution. Considerable difficulties were encountered with the curved interface between the rubble and the cylindrical structure, and particularly where the rubble left the structure at the back. Very large strains caused the interface nodes to oscillate between target elements, causing convergence problems. For extreme ridges (20 meters deep) maximum loads of the order of 17 MN were obtained.\n\nP9408\n\nP9418\n\nDYNAMIC ANALYSIS AND MODIFICATION OF PUMP MOTOR BASE\n\nCLIENT: Federated Pipelines Limited DATE: 1994\n\nDESCRIPTION: A pump used in an oil pipeline, was experiencing unacceptable vibrations at speeds within its normal operating speed range. Field analysis of the pump and pump base had concluded that the steel base which supported the pump motor may have been causing the vibrations. A detailed dynamic finite element analysis of the pump base was undertaken to establish the frequencies and mode shapes of the fundamental vibration mode of the base. Although there were modes which would have caused the forms of deformation being observed in the rotor, the frequencies of these nodes were higher than the observed frequencies by an order of magnitude. Structural reinforcement of the base was designed to limit the amplitudes of these vibrations. It was finally concluded that the vibrations were being caused by the rotor itself.\n\nP9406\n\nP9315\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND STRAIT CROSSING ICE ENGINEERING\n\nCLIENT: Public Works Canada DATE: 1993-1996\n\nDESCRIPTION: A multi-year standing order for the provision of specialist ice engineering services in support of the design, construction, and operation of the Northumberland Strait Crossing. This crossing is the longest bridge in the world traversing a body of water which is ice covered for a significant portion of each year. It will be approximately 13 kilometres long, connecting the island province of Prince Edward Island to the Canadian main land. Northumberland Strait is ice covered from early January until the third week in April, although the date of last ice can vary over a period of two months. Ice is a significant design parameter of the bridge and its operation, both in terms of ice effects on the bridge and effects of the bridge on the ice climatology. Bercha was first retained as a consultant to Public Works Canada in 1986, and since that time has been evaluating all aspects of the ice-bridge interaction including ice forces on the bridge, effect of ice jams, environmental effect of changes in ice climatology, including microclimactic effects and effects on local fisheries. Under the present standing order, the work underway emphasized ice engineering aspects, particularly the effect of the bridge on ice jams and the adequacy and reliability of the ice design parameters, including pressures and global loads, used in the final bridge design.

Concerns about the pipeline location included the following risk impacts:\n\na) pipeline construction and operations impact on highway facilities and vehicle traffic,\n\nb) vehicle accidents impact on pipeline operations,\n\nc) highway maintenance activities impact on pipeline operations,\n\nd) potential highway widening activities impact on pipeline operations, and\n\ne) other hazards such as falling rocks impact on pipeline operations.\n\nThe risk analysis included identification of potential hazards, quantification of pipeline leak frequencies, calculation of leak consequences, evaluation of risk mitigation measures, estimation of public risk exposure, and comparison with existing traffic accident risks.\n\nP9324\n\nSPECIFICATION OF STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MOBILE ARCTIC CAISSON, MOLIKPAQ\n\nCLIENT: B. Wright and Associates DATE: 1993-94\n\nDESCRIPTION: A 1/30 scale model of the Molikpaq was to be developed at the National Research Council of Canada ice tank in Ottawa. In order to construct the model and to provide the appropriate instrumentation to permit comparisons between the ice tank results, and the full scale data acquired during the structure's deployments in the Beaufort Sea, NRCC contracted to have the necessary structural characteristics provided. As Bercha had a long history of developing analytical models of the Molikpaq, they were asked to provide this information. The information included the overall stiffness of the structural system as it was deployed at Amauligak I-65, the relative stiffnesses of the individual structural components, and the primary load paths, the mass distribution for the same deployment, and the dynamic characteristics of the system. The specification of the dynamic characteristics included the natural frequencies of the complete system, and major components, and the level of damping of the various components. This latter parameter included the estimation of damping with and without the presence of ice.\n\nP9321\n\nFINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF REINFORCED CONCRETE STACK\n\nCLIENT: Monenco DATE: 1993\n\nDESCRIPTION: TransAlta Utilities, the owner and operator of the Wabamun electrical generating plant, and the Alberta\n\nDepartment of the Environment, wished to create additional access holes in the largest of reinforced concrete stacks in order to permit sampling of exhaust gases. Prior to the creation of the holes, they wished confirmation that the holes would not critically alter the integrity of the stacks. To do this, a non-linear finite element analysis of a portion of the concrete stack was carried out under the effects of extreme operating conditions, and the design wind pressures. Analyses were carried out both for the current arrangement of holes and with the proposed additional holes. The analysis was carried out with a special purpose non-linear finite element program which accounted for the tension-weak characteristics of concrete, the presence of reinforcing steel, and the time dependent behavior of concrete. The results indicated that the proposed additional holes did not compromise the reliability of the stack.\n\nP9310\n\n.01\n\nICE LOAD SENSITIVITY FOR EAST COAST STRUCTURES\n\nCLIENT: National Energy Board DATE: 1993\n\nDESCRIPTION: Sensitivity of specified environmental ice design loads in accordance with CSA S471. Carried out simulations of ice forces from impacts by: icebergs, bergy-bits, and sea ice with fixed and floating production structures in the Hibernia area of the Grand Banks. The analyses incorporated energy decay algorithms for the impact analysis with appropriate energy sinks depending on the particular interaction. For fixed structures these included crushing of ice as well as elastic structure response, and iceberg rotation and translation. For floating structures, local elastic and permanent deformation of the structure was included. Data on iceberg frequencies, dimensions, shape, and velocities were obtained from various sources to provide the most reliable distributions. For bergy-bits, recent reported data by Crocker was used for the size distribution. Sensitivities were carried out on ice strength, iceberg velocity, and iceberg arrival rate. Of these, the first was found to have the most effect on the specified design forces, while the second, velocity, was found to have the least effect.\n\nP9303\n\n.01\n\nRISK BASED SITING AND PERMITTING OF HAZARDOUS ENERGY RELATED FACILITIES\n\nCLIENT: County of Santa Barbara, California Utilities Commission DATE: 1993-1994\n\nDESCRIPTION: The objective of this study was to develop the basis for a policy on application of risk analysis in the siting and permitting of hazardous energy related facilities in the County of Santa Barbara. General classes of facilities considered explicitly were oil and gas, automotive fuel, and electrical facilities. Only acute or immediate risks as opposed to chronic or long term risks were included in the scope of work.\n\nFundamentals of risk analysis were reviewed to establish a basis and terminology for the balance of the work. The general procedures for implementing risk considerations in the planning process were then described.\n\nResults from a review of the general types of hazardous energy related facilities which exist or may exist in the near future in the County of Santa Barbara included:\n\na) classification of the facilities into oil and gas, automotive fuel, and electrical categories and sub-categories such\n\nas gasoline, compressed natural gas, methanol, and ethanol stations in the automotive fuel category.\n\nb) a brief description of the relative hazardousness of the principal substances handled by the facilities.\n\nc) a general description and summary of the hazards associated with each type of facility.\n\nd) a review of both US and worldwide guidelines and regulations designed to manage acute risks to the public.\n\ne) a discussion of the role of risk analysis in the context of the planning processes for the County of Santa Barbara.\n\nf) specific recommendations for the implementation of the results from this work.\n\nP9302\n\n.01\n\nPUBLIC SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ANALYSIS TRAINING PROGRAM\n\nCLIENT: Latin American Association of Oil Companies (ARPELL) DATE: 1993\n\nDESCRIPTION: A formal two day seminar was delivered by two Bercha principals to forty professional and management level trainees from nine South American and Central American countries including Costa Rica, Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador, Trinidad, Tobago, Argentina and Peru. The objective was to provide practical insights for the application of risk analysis to safety and environmental concerns within the petroleum industry. This introductory seminar involved preparation and distribution of a bi-lingual (Spanish and English) 180 page training work book, presentation of lectures in Spanish and English (with simultaneous translation), and leading specialized workshops involving the analysis of practical problems from each participant's workplace. Certificates of participation were issued to each trainee.\n\nP9302\n\n.02\n\nRISK ANALYSIS APPLICATIONS FOR THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY\n\nCLIENT: Latin American Association of Oil Companies (ARPELL) DATE: 1993\n\nDESCRIPTION: A three day seminar on risk analysis applications within the context of the oil and gas industry was conducted. The seminar was given by two senior Bercha risk experts and consisted of a meld of lectures and workshops. The presentation was accompanied by simultaneous translation for the attendees who numbered in excess of 40. All phases of the risk analysis process from initiating risk or hazard to detailed consequence analysis were reviewed and each trainee participated in the formulation and conduct of a risk analysis project in an area of professional interest. Certification and performance evaluation was conducted at the conclusion of the seminar.\n\nP9301 DEVELOPMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR THE ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION, AND OPERATION OF HIGH PRESSURE SOUR GAS LINE\n\nCLIENT: Shell Canada Limited DATE: 1993\n\nDESCRIPTION: A risk management program was developed for the operation of a high-pressure sour gas pipeline from a gathering system to a sour gas treatment plant. All potential pipeline system failure scenarios such as thermal stress, differential settlement, third party effects, and other scenarios identified in previous studies by the Bercha Group were considered in this program. These scenarios were prioritized through the assignment of risk indices, considering probability and consequence severity, and a series of mitigative measures were developed and evaluated quantitatively. A specific risk management plan detailing the mitigative measures, technical responsibilities, and implementation procedures was then developed to address each principal risk scenario. Bercha risk analysts and engineers advised the Shell project and operating personnel in conjunction with the Shell engineering partner responsible for design and construction.

Model performance was evaluated through comparison to a series of real time ice observations obtained from airborne radar and satellite data. P9231.01 INVESTIGATION OF ICE GROWTH AND DECAY SCHEMES FOR REGIONAL ICE\n\nCLIENT: Ice Centre - Environment Canada DATE: 1992-3\n\nDESCRIPTION: Scientific assessment of existing ice growth and decay models for possible incorporation in the Multi-Category Regional Ice Model (MCRIM). A team of experts was assembled to review possible approaches and recommend models which could be included in MCRIM without altering the basic dynamic formulation and which would permit MCRIM to execute in an operational mode. The experts recommended a two-part approach: the Semtner zero-layer model for basic ice cover and a wave-driven model for edge effects. Algorithms were developed and coded into MCRIM as new subroutines which could be executed as options. All of the new coding was fully documented. A comprehensive series of sensitivity analyses were carried out to illustrate the effect of the new modelling on ice growth and decay at the top and bottom surfaces of the ice/snow slab. The necessary additional data to permit MCRIM to run with the new algorithms was obtained. Further, new data for the verification periods (see PA 9114) was also obtained. The verification procedures for the two periods for the east coast were run in a series of analyses to illustrate the effect of the new algorithms on ice edge movement and ice concentrations. P9228 COMMISSIONING AND START UP OF OPERATIONS READINESS REVIEW FOR A WORLD SCALE SOUR GAS PRODUCTION SYSTEM AND TREATMENT PLANT\n\nCLIENT: Shell Canada Limited DATE: 1992\n\nDESCRIPTION: An operational readiness review was carried out on a world scale sour gas production and treatment facility at Caroline to identify any critical deficiencies or concerns in the commissioning and start up plans. The review team included risk consultants in addition to independent operating personnel with instrumentation, operations, and maintenance experience. A broad cross section of the facilities operating team, including contractors, was interviewed to identify significant concerns, which may delay or endanger a smooth start up. The review was restricted to commissioning and start up and did not address steady state operations nor did it involve a detailed inspection of equipment. The review did provide an assessment of the management systems and implementation program performance.\n\nResults from the operational readiness review included identification of the principal concerns among the following categories: (a) Organization, (b) Safety Procedures, (c) Equipment Readiness, (d) Training, and (e) Emergency Response. Following the identification of concerns, conclusions were presented which prioritized the concerns so they could be effectively addressed. In addition, any exceptional aspects of the commissioning and start up plans as presently being implemented were highlighted. P9227 PUBLIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ANALYSIS OF A REFINED OIL PRODUCTS PIPELINE\n\nCLIENT: Interprovincial Pipe Line Inc. DATE: 1993\n\nDESCRIPTION: The risk analysis methods employed in this project included a systems failure modes, risk and criticality analysis and an example worksheet from this task is attached. P9219 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF FINITE ELEMENT SOFTWARE\n\nCLIENT: National Research Council of Canada DATE: 1992\n\nDESCRIPTION: A series of Finite Element Software programs which were originally developed as research tools were modified and augmented to allow their execution on IBM PC compatible computers. These improvements included, in some cases, whole-scale modifications to the original code to eliminate dated Fortran usage and introduce memory management processes prevalent in desktop PC's. Other improvements included the introduction of pre- and post-processors which simplified the preparation of data input, and the interpretation of output results. These were set up to run under a Windows environment. Finally, the ability to output results graphically was also added to the programs. This latter improvement required the creation of complex data management routines to permit user control of the results being output, and the orientation and scale of the plot. P9215 SYSTEMS FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS OF OIL PRODUCTION AND PIPELINE FACILITIES\n\nCLIENT: Husky Oil DATE: 1992\n\nDESCRIPTION: A systems failure mode analysis (SMFA) was carried out on two major oil pipeline terminals in order to identify potential significant failure modes associated with both the equipment and its operation, and to rank the associated risks. Following reviews of the engineering documentation and interviews with site personnel, each terminal facility was subdivided into individual systems and associated subsystems for the SFMA. The objective of the system breakdown used was to provide the framework for identifying significant failure modes, which would impact throughput, cost, safety, or the environment. A systems approach was taken in order to screen high priority risks with an optimum level of manpower resources. P9213 LEAK HAZARD ANALYSIS OF A HIGHER PRESSURE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE\n\nCLIENT: Westcoast Energy Inc. DATE: 1992\n\nDESCRIPTION: During construction of the new natural gas pipeline from the mainland to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, there was concern regarding potential hazards from an industrial facility located near the pipeline right of way. A study was therefore carried out to estimate the hazards resulting from any leak from the pipeline. Safety and property hazard zones, as defined by delayed or immediate ignition of potential leaks, were estimated using consequence models. Plume dispersion calculations were performed using the GASCON 2 model, while the effects on people from a fire were estimated based on the approach developed by Considine and Grint and using the probit equation of Eisenberg. The effects of thermal radiation on surrounding property were also evaluated using empirical data. P9212 PROBABILISTIC ANALYSIS OF RESIDENTIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS FROM A REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM\n\nCLIENT: Northwestern Utilities Limited DATE: 1992\n\nDESCRIPTION: The client contracts for natural gas supply from a variety of producers, then provides an integrated delivery system of natural gas to many communities in the north central region of the province of Alberta. The majority of natural gas is supplied on an as and when required basis, however a number of large industrial users contract to specific delivery amounts. In order to design the gas delivery system including capacity requirements for underground storage, the client must estimate the maximum total gas demand, which consists of both temperature dependent and temperature independent components. Current designs were developed from worst case scenarios and the objective of the present study was to convert such criteria to a probabilistic basis more representative of the factors affecting the delivery system. An in-depth probabilistic analysis was therefore carried out on the extensive environmental data bases and gas consumption records for the client delivery system. The detailed design criteria for both the temperature dependent and temperature independent components of the gas load were evaluated and compared to the total gas load on the system. P9208\n\nSIMULATION AND MODELING SERVICES FOR NORTHUMBERLAND STRAIT PROJECT\n\nCLIENT: Delcan/Stone and Webster Joint Venture DATE: 1992-3\n\nDESCRIPTION: Continued work on the Jamming and Break-Up modelling for the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project as part of the Ice Committee's mandate to determine the impact of any bridge on the ice regime. Subsequently examined the winning design (SCI) and sensitivities of the jamming and break-up models to winter severity. Consulted with SCI, C-Core, and independent engineer on the ice forces on the piers, providing expert advice on the ice conditions in the Strait as well as executing independent calculations of ice forces for Public Works Canada. Initial calculations were on the original 8m cylindrical design and subsequent calculations on various forms of conical design. Work involved refinement of three-dimensional conical failure mechanisms for ice sheets with rubble and ridge keels. Provided advice to Public Works Canada on the reports from C-Core to SCI and the reports by the independent engineer, Buckland and Taylor.\n\nP9206 COMPARISON OF RISKS BETWEEN ALTERNATIVE RAIL AND TRUCK MODES FOR TRANSPORTING LPGs\n\nCLIENT: Shell Canada Limited DATE: 1992\n\nDESCRIPTION: An investigation was carried out on the risk impacts from changing the mode of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) transportation in Eastern Canada from a rail operation to a truck operation. Of particular interest was the potential relative change in risk exposure corresponding to a change in transportation mode. The work was commissioned in phases, beginning with a top level analysis for management and continuing with a more detailed analysis providing a site and operation specific comparison. The preliminary risk analysis provided a management overview of historical rail and truck accident and release frequencies, in addition to the distribution of consequence hazard zones associated with an LPG release. Frequency analyses for both modes of transportation were based on analyses of published generic data for the transportation industry in Canada and North America. The consequence analysis involved both a statistical analysis of historical accident consequences and modeling of potential spill consequences in order to determine the associated hazard distances. The second phase of work continued with a more detailed analysis of site specific accident data and public exposure data. P9205\n\nFINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS OF REINFORCED CONCRETE STACK\n\nCLIENT: Monenco DATE: 1992\n\nDESCRIPTION: TransAlta Utilities, the owner and operator of the Wabamun electrical generating plant, and the Alberta Department of the Environment, wished to create additional access holes in the two of reinforced concrete stacks in order to permit sampling of exhaust gases. Prior to the creation of the holes, they wished confirmation that the holes would not critically alter the integrity of the stacks. To do this, a non-linear finite element analysis of a portion of the concrete stack was carried out under the effects of extreme operating conditions, and the design wind pressures. Analyses were carried out both for the current arrangement of holes and with the proposed additional holes. The analysis was carried out with a special purpose non-linear finite element program which accounted for the tension-weak characteristics of concrete, the presence of reinforcing steel, and the time dependent behaviour of concrete. The results indicated that the proposed additional holes did not compromise the reliability of the stacks.\n\nP9203 PUBLIC RISK FROM SINKHOLES ON ARCTIC HIGHWAYS\n\nCLIENT: Government of Northwest Territories, Department of Transportation DATE: 1992\n\nDESCRIPTION: Due to a concern about the potential for vehicular accidents resulting from the occurrence of sudden sinkholes in the driving lanes of the Dempster Highway, a risk analysis was carried out and the results were quantitatively compared with those normally occurring risks associated with highway travel.\n\nResults included an assessment of culvert and sinkhole data based on highway surveys and an evaluation of traffic and accident data based on additional highway surveys. Risk estimates were presented in the form of annual frequencies for an accident, an injury, or a fatality occurring as a result of an interaction with a sinkhole in one of three portions of the Dempster Highway and in one of four months of the year in which sinkholes occur. Quantified risk estimates were then compared with other risks from common experience and a sensitivity analysis of the risk estimates was presented. P9202 EVALUATION OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TWO GAS PLANT AND PIPELINE RISK ANALYSES\n\nCLIENT: County of Santa Barbara, California Gas Commission DATE: 1992\n\nDESCRIPTION: The County of Santa Barbara is involved in the approval process of industry applications for the development and operation o"
