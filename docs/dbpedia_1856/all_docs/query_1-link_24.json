Wilder and Sallie were the grandparents of the\n\nlate James Richard Moore, whose mother, Lucile Wilder Moore, died in the flu epidemic of 1918. He was\n\nreared by his beloved Myrtle \"Maw\" and husband, C. C. \"Con\" Davis, in the Wilder home. The house was\n\nlocated in Naples at the site ofthe present Morris County National Bank property. The photo was furnished\n\nby Martha Moore, a former resident of Naples. O&Y photo\n\nby Bartee Haile\n\nTexas tanker vanishes in Bermuda Triangle\n\nOn May 27, 1963, a Coast Guard board of inquiry wrapped up a six-\n\nweek investigation into the mysterious disappearance of a Texas\n\ntanker in the Bermuda Triangle.\n\nThe \"SS Marine Sulphur Queen\" began life in 1944 as the \"New\n\nHaven,\" an oil transport owned and operated by Esso, the foreign face\n\nof what Americans know today as Exxon-Mobil. For the next decade\n\nand a half, the 504-foot, 7,240-ton colossus crisscrossed the oceans\n\nof the world.\n\nThen in 1960 the Marine Transport Company of New York bought\n\nthe \"New Haven\" and had her refitted for a revolutionary new cargo -\n\nliquid sulphur at a piping hot 255 degrees. The first tanker of its kind\n\nwas renamed \"SS Marine Sulphur Queen\" and leased out to Texas\n\nGulf Sulphur, which ran a plant near Beaumont that extracted sulphur\n\nfrom the salt dome at Spindletop.\n\nCertified for service in January 1961, the \"Sulphur Queen\" stayed\n\nbusy making no fewer than 63 round-trips to ports up and down the\n\nAtlantic coast from its home base in Beaumont. It was not, however,\n\nsmooth sailing for the tanker which was plagued by problems that\n\nincluded accidental spills ofthe hazardous cargo and frequent fires in\n\nsulphur-soaked insulation.\n\nThe \"Sulphur Queen\" set out for Norfolk, Virginia on the evening of\n\nFeb. 2, 1963 with a full load ofthe molten yellow liquid and a full crew\n\nof 39. The routine voyage was supposed to take five days, unloading\n\nanother two and the return trip five more putting the tanker back in\n\nBeaumont on Valentine's Day.\n\nAt 1:25 a.m. on Feb. 4 and approximately 200 miles off Key West,\n\na seaman used the ship-to-shore radio to place an order with his\n\nstockbroker in Florida. That was the last time anyone heard from the\n\n\"Sulphur Queen.\"\n\nWhen the Texas tanker was a no-show at Norfolk on the night of\n\nFeb. 7, the Coast Guard initiated its search with an \"All Ships Urgent\n\nBroadcast.\" This request for any information from other vessels that\n\nmay have seen the \"Sulphur Queen\" or had been in radio contact with\n\nher turned up nothing.\n\nUnder the direction of the Coast Guard, planes from the Navy,\n\nMarines and Air Force took to the sky on Feb. 8 to scour the sea from\n\nBeaumont to Norfolk for signs of the missing ship. But a meticulous\n\nsurvey of 350,000 square miles of water over a five-day period proved\n\nfrustratingly fruitless.\n\nOn Feb. 14, the families ofthe three dozen crewmen received the\n\ntelegram they all had been dreading. The chairman of Maritime\n\nTransport Company informed them the Coast Guard had suspended\n\nthe search and that \"present indications indicate probable loss\" of all\n\nhands.\n\nA naval torpedo retriever came upon a floating flea market of debris\n\n12 miles southwest of Key West on Feb. 19. A number of life jackets\n\nand rings pulled from the drink bore the label \"Sulphur Queen.\"\n\nA second and more focused air-sea search was immediately\n\nlaunched, but the seven ships and 48 aircraft had no better luck than\n\ntheir predecessors. The hunt for the \"Sulphur Queen\" was officially\n\ncalled off on Mar. 14.\n\nBy that time, the Coast Guard investigation was already in its third\n\nweek with three more weeks to go. The exhaustive hearings featured\n\na long list of expert witnesses, who testified about everything from the\n\nvolatile nature of sulphur in liquid form to teeth marks on a life\n\npreserver that suggested an attack by \"predatory fish,\" a scientific\n\neuphemism for sharks.\n\nSpeculation centered on the possibility the \"Sulphur Queen\" broke\n\nin half in rough seas as had three tankers ofthe same vintage over the\n\npast 11 years. But even that catastrophic theory could not explain why\n\nthere had been no SOS since the other vessels had stayed afloat long\n\nenough for most ofthe crews to safely abandon ship.\n\nOther causes considered were a freak wave that capsized the\n\ntanker, an explosion resulting from a leak in one ofthe sulphur\n\ncompartments and a \"stray mine.\"\n\nWhen it was all said and done, the board of inquiry basically punted,\n\nto use a football analogy. Speaking for his fellow officers, an admiral\n\nadmitted they could not say with any certainty what really happened\n\nto the \"Sulphur Queen\" much less when or where.\n\nRelatives ofthe missing and presumed dead crewmen filed a\n\nwrongful-death lawsuit claiming reckless overloading was the cause\n\nofthe unspecified disaster at sea. After almost a decade, a federal\n\nappeals court ruled in their favor and awarded the grieving plaintiffs\n\nmillions of dollars in damages.\n\nIn 1974 author Charles Berlitz immortalized the \"Sulphur Queen\" in\n\nhis international best-seller \"The Bermuda Triangle.\" The book, which\n\nsold 20 million copies in 30 different languages, fired the public\n\nimagination but came no closer to solving the mystery ofthe missing\n\nTexas tanker than the Coast Guard.\n\n===== bhntm =====\n\nDo you have your copy of \"Tornadoes, Hurricanes & Other\n\nDisasters,\" the latest \"Best of This Week in Texas History\" column\n\ncollection?
