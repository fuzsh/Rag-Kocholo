        "text": "Tracking an Oil Tanker Collision and Spilled Oils in the East China Sea Using Multisensor Day and Night Satellite Imagery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, Shaojie; Lu, Yingcheng; Liu, Yongxue; Wang, Mengqiu; Hu, Chuanmin\n\n2018-04-01\n\nSatellite remote sensing is well known to play a critical role in monitoring marine accidents such as oil spills, yet the recent SANCHI oil tanker collision event in January 2018 in the East China Sea indicates that traditional techniques using synthetic aperture radar or daytime optical imagery could not provide timely and adequate coverage. In this study, we show the unprecedented value of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product and Day/Night Band data in tracking the oil tanker's drifting pathway and locations when all other means are not as effective for the same purpose. Such pathway and locations can also be reproduced with a numerical model, with root-mean-square error of <15 km. While high-resolution optical imagery after 4 days of the tanker's sinking reveals much larger oil spill area (>350 km2) than previous reports, the impact of the spilled condensate oil on the marine environment requires further research.\n\nIn-depth analysis of accidental oil spills from tankers in the context of global spill trends from all sources.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurgherr, Peter\n\n2007-02-09\n\nThis study gives a global overview of accidental oil spills from all sources (> or =700t) for the period 1970-2004, followed by a detailed examination of trends in accidental tanker spills. The present analysis of the number and volume of tanker spills includes temporal and spatial spill trends, aspects of spill size distribution as well as trends of key factors (i.e., flag state, hull type, tanker age, accident cause and sensitivity of location). Results show that the total number and volume of tanker spills have significantly decreased since the 1970s, which is in contrast to increases in maritime transport of oil and to popular perceptions following recent catastrophic events. However, many spills still occur in ecologically sensitive locations because the major maritime transport routes often cross the boundaries of the Large Marine Ecosystems, but the substantially lower total spill volume is an important contribution to potentially reduce overall ecosystem impacts. In summary, the improvements achieved in the past decades have been the result of a set of initiatives and regulations implemented by governments, international organizations and the shipping industry.\n\nA system of containment to prevent oil spills from sunken tankers.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-Olivares, Antonio; AgÃ¼ero, Almudena; Haupt, Bernd J; Marcos, MarÃ­a J; Villar, MarÃ­a V; de Pablos, JosÃ© L\n\n2017-09-01\n\nWorldwide tank spills represent 10% of the average annual input of oil in the sea. When such spills arise from wrecks at depth, neutralisation of environmental impacts is difficult to achieve. Extracting oil from sunken tankers is expensive, and, unfortunately, all of the oil cannot be extracted, as the Prestige case demonstrates. We propose an environmentally appropriate, cost-effective and proactive method to stop the long-term problem of leaks from sunken tankers similar to the Prestige. This method confines the wreck with a \"sediment\" capping of sepiolite mineral that emulates a natural sediment. A set of experiments and simulations shows that sepiolite has the characteristics necessary to accomplish the confinement of any current or future sunken tanker with minimal environmental perturbation.

US ships have 50% as many spills per port call as Liberian tankers and 20-33% as many as foreign tankers as a whole. There is mounting evidence that ships are prone to have a rather constant number of spills per year irrespective of variations in port call exposure. When spill incidence is measured per ship time, the US tanker margin over foreign fleets is only 2-3 instead of 3-6. For 1973-1975, 76% of all US tanker spills weremoreÂ Â» <100 gal, compared with 65% of all flag of convenience spills. The probability of no tanker losses in a one-year period in US waters is only 0.22. One-half the losses can be expected to occur in conditions favorable to a spill in coastal waters. In any given year, the US tanker fleet of 235 vessels >1000 gross registered tonnage can be expected to have about 100 spills in US waters, while foreign flag ships contribute another 250 spills. The largest US tanker spill in a one-year period is <5000 gal; the median value for the largest spill from foreign tankers is closer to 50,000-100,000 gal.Â«Â less\n\nTanker spills Norwegian crude oil off Shetlands\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNot Available\n\n1993-01-11\n\nThis paper reports that crude oil was spilling last week from the U.S. owned Braer tanker after the 89,000 dwt vessel ran aground on the south end of Scotland's Shetland Islands. Workers were trying to assess the extent of damage to the tanker, shoreline, and wildlife after the January 5 accident. Braer's cargo amounted to 607,000 bbl of Norwegian oil bound for Canada. Braer loaded its cargo and sailed January 3 from Den norske stats oljeselskap AS's Mongstad, Norway, terminal with crude from Gullfaks field in the Norwegian North Sea.

Concepts considered include modifications to the shipborne LNG containers so that in the event of a container rupture less of the contents would spill and/or the contents would spill at a reduced rate. Changes in the cargo itself, including making the LNG into a gel, solidifying it, converting it to methanol, and adding flame suppressants are also evaluated. The relative effectiveness and the costs of implementing these methods in terms of increased cost of gas at the receivingmoreÂ Â» terminal, are explained. The vulnerability of an LNG tanker and its crew to the thermal effects of a large pool fire caused by a collision spill is estimated and methods of protecting the crew are considered. It is shown that the protection of ship and crew so that further deterioration of a damaged ship might be ameliorated, would require the design and installation of extraordinary insulation systems and life support assistance for the crew. Methods of salvaging or disposing of cargo from a damaged and disabled ship are evaluated, and it is concluded that if the cargo cannot be transferred to another (empty) LNG tanker because of lack of availability, then the burning of the cargo at a location somewhat distant from the disabled tanker appears to be a promising approach. Finally, the likelihood of the vapors from a spill being ignited due to the frictional impact of the colliding ships was examined. It is found that the heating of metal sufficient to ignite flammable vapors would occur during a collision, but it is questionable whether flammable vapor and air will, in fact, come in contact with the hot metal surfaces.Â«Â less\n\nTransporting US oil imports: The impact of oil spill legislation on the tanker market\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRowland, P.J.\n\n1992-05-01\n\nThe Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ( OPA'') and an even more problematic array of State pollution laws have raised the cost, and risk, of carrying oil into and out of the US. This report, prepared under contract to the US Department of energy's Office of Domestic and International Policy, examines the impact of Federal and State oil spill legislation on the tanker market. It reviews the role of marine transportation in US oil supply, explores the OPA and State oil spill laws, studies reactions to OPA in the tanker and tank barge industries and in related industries such asmoreÂ Â» insurance and ship finance, and finally, discusses the likely developments in the years ahead. US waterborne oil imports amounted to 6.5 million B/D in 1991, three-quarters of which was crude oil. Imports will rise by almost 3 million B/D by 2000 according to US Department of energy forecasts, with most of the crude oil growth after 1995. Tanker demand will grow even faster: most of the US imports and the increased traffic to other world consuming regions will be on long-haul trades. Both the number of US port calls by tankers and the volume of offshore lightering will grow. Every aspect of the tanker industry's behavior is affected by OPA and a variety of State pollution laws.Â«Â less\n\nTransporting US oil imports: The impact of oil spill legislation on the tanker market.

The objective of the present study is to investigate the ultimate strength of double hull oil tanker under vertical bending moments due to grounding and collision. The damages are modelled by removing the elements consist of stiffened and unstiffened plates from the damages part. One-frame space of the double hull oil tanker is taken to be analysed. Two damages cases are considered in the analyses those are grounding and collision. The transversal damage extent for grounding are 10%, 25%, 40% and 55%. The groundings are placed at symmetric position on the outer bottom part. For the case of collision, the vertical damage extent are taken as 10%, 20%, 40% and 60%. The transversal damages extent is taken to be B/16 and it is constant for all collision damages. The investigation of the ultimate strength is performed by the Non-Linear Finite Element Analysis method under moment control. The boundary condition is applied with fully constrained on all nodes at the aft-end, while the rigid linked on all nodes is attached at the fore-end with respect to the reference point on the neutral axis. The initial imperfection, welding residual stress and crack are not considered in the analyses. The results obtained by Non-Linear Finite Element Analyses for the ultimate strength are compared with the in-house program using Smithâs method implemented in HULLST. The stress distribution and deformation for every case of damages including intact are also discussed in the present study.\n\nIxtoc oil spill assessment\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBoehm, P.\n\nThe blowout of the Ixtoc I oil well in the Bay of Campeche resulted in the largest documented spill in history. Approximately half a million metric tons of oil were released from June 3, 1979 to March 23, 1980. Of that amount, an estimated 11 thousand metric tons impacted south Texas beaches. As a result of the movement of oil from the Ixtoc I well blowout into the South Texas Outer Continental Shelf (STOCS) environment, a study was undertaken to establish the magnitude and areal extent of perturbation of the benthic community caused by chemical residues of Ixtoc oil. ThemoreÂ Â» study focused on the inner shelf region to the 60-metre isobath and examined both the biology and hydrocarbon geochemistry of 12 sites coincident with those of four previously studied (1975-1977) baseline transects. Additionally, 26 sites within the region sampled during 1979 (mid-spill) for chemical parameters and again in 1980 (post-spill) for chemical and biological parameters, and 39 other sites sampled in 1979 for chemical parameters, were studied. The Burmah Agate oil tanker collided with the freighter Mimosa in November, 1979 5 miles off of Galveston, Texas and spilled part of its cargo of light crude oil. Approximately 21 thousand metric tons of the spilled oil burned in an ensuing fire. As the potentially complicating impact of the Burmah Agate tanker collision was of importance in the region, a set of six sites in the Galveston region were sampled to gain knowledge of the presence and nature of introduced chemical residues from this event. This study established a chemical and biological framework for carrying out spill assessment studies of this nature. It utilized a significant environmental data base for post-impact studies for the first time, and identified several sampling methodology deficiencies which, if corrected, may help to fine-tune such assessments.Â«Â less\n\nA Model for Risk Analysis of Oil Tankers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMontewka, Jakub; Krata, PrzemysÅaw; Goerland, Floris; Kujala, Pentti\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe paper presents a model for risk analysis regarding marine traffic, with the emphasis on two types of the most common marine accidents which are: collision and grounding. The focus is on oil tankers as these pose the highest environmental risk. A case study in selected areas of Gulf of Finland in ice free conditions is presented. The model utilizes a well-founded formula for risk calculation, which combines the probability of an unwanted event with its consequences. Thus the model is regarded a block type model, consisting of blocks for the probability of collision and grounding estimation respectively as well as blocks for consequences of an accident modelling. Probability of vessel colliding is assessed by means of a Minimum Distance To Collision (MDTC) based model. The model defines in a novel way the collision zone, using mathematical ship motion model and recognizes traffic flow as a non homogeneous process. The presented calculations address waterways crossing between Helsinki and Tallinn, where dense cross traffic during certain hours is observed. For assessment of a grounding probability, a new approach is proposed, which utilizes a newly developed model, where spatial interactions between objects in different locations are recognized. A ship at a seaway and navigational obstructions may be perceived as interacting objects and their repulsion may be modelled by a sort of deterministic formulation. Risk due to tankers running aground addresses an approach fairway to an oil terminal in SkÃ¶ldvik, near Helsinki. The consequences of an accident are expressed in monetary terms, and concern costs of an oil spill, based on statistics of compensations claimed from the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC Funds) by parties involved.\n\nEnvironmental implications of oil spills from shipping accidents.\n\nPubMed\n\nRogowska, Justyna; NamieÅnik, Jacek\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSince ancient times, ships have sunk during storms, either as a result of collisions with other vessels or running onto rocks. However, the ever-increasing importance of crude oil in the twentieth century and the corresponding growth in the world's tanker fleet have drawn attention to the negative implications of sea transport. Disasters involving tankers like the Torrey Canyon or the Amoco Cadiz have shown how dramatic the consequences of such an accident may be. The effects of oil spills at sea depend on numerous factors, such as the physicochemical parameters of the oil, the characteristics of the environment affected, and the physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring there, such as evaporation, dissolution, dispersion, emulsification, photo-oxidation, biodegradation, and sedimentation. The combination of these processes reduces the concentrations of hydrocarbons in sediments and water and alters the chemical composition of spilled oils. In every case, oil spills pose a danger to fauna and flora and cause damage to sea and shores ecosystems. Many of the petroleum-related chemicals that are spilled are toxic, otherwise carcinogenic or can be bioaccumulated in the tissues of marine organisms. Such chemicals may then be biomagnified up the marine food chain from phytoplankton to fish, then to seals and other carnivorous sea mammals. Moreover, oil products can be accumulated and immobilized in bottom deposits for long periods of time. Oil spills are particularly dangerous when they occur in small inland seas that have intense sea traffic, e.g., the Baltic Sea.\n\nExxon Valdez Spill Profile\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nIn 1989, the oil tanker struck Bligh Reef and spilled over 11 million gallons of crude oil. The spill was the largest in U.S. history and tested the abilities of local, national, and industrial organizations to prepare for and respond to such a disaster.\n\nRational application of chemicals in response to oil spills may reduce environmental damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nTamis, Jacqueline E; Jongbloed, Ruud H; Karman, Chris C; Koops, Wierd; Murk, Albertinka J\n\n2012-04-01\n\nOil spills, for example those due to tanker collisions and groundings or platform accidents, can have huge adverse impacts on marine systems. The impact of an oil spill at sea depends on a number of factors, such as spill volume, type of oil spilled, weather conditions, and proximity to environmentally, economically, or socially sensitive areas. Oil spilled at sea threatens marine organisms, whole ecosystems, and economic resources in the immediate vicinity, such as fisheries, aquaculture, recreation, and tourism. Adequate response to any oil spill to minimize damage is therefore of great importance. The common response to an oil spill is to remove all visible oil from the water surface, either mechanically or by using chemicals to disperse the oil into the water column to biodegrade. This is not always the most suitable response to an oil spill, as the chemical application itself may also have adverse effects, or no response may be needed. In this article we discuss advantages and disadvantages of using chemical treatments to reduce the impact of an oil spill in relation to the conditions of the spill. The main characteristics of chemical treatment agents are discussed and presented within the context of a basic decision support scheme.

This study considers the hypothetical outflow of oil in the case of side damage and bottom damage to single-hull designs. The results will be considered by the Coast Guard in drafting regulations pertaining to the requirement for tanker vessels to carry oil pollution response equipment (i.e., in response to the oil Pollution Act of 1990). PNL's approach to this investigation included: assessingmoreÂ Â» time-dependent oil outflow in the cases of collision and grounding of both tankers and barges; identifying environmental constraints on self-help countermeasure operation; identifying human factor issues, such as crew performance, safety, and training requirements for the self-help countermeasures considered; and assessing each self-help countermeasure with respect to its potential for minimizing oil loss to the environment. Results from the time-dependent oil outflow, environmental limitations, and human factors requirements were input into a simulation model.Â«Â less\n\nA probabilistic model for accidental cargo oil outflow from product tankers in a ship-ship collision.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoerlandt, Floris; Montewka, Jakub\n\n2014-02-15\n\nIn risk assessment of maritime transportation, estimation of accidental oil outflow from tankers is important for assessing environmental impacts. However, there typically is limited data concerning the specific structural design and tank arrangement of ships operating in a given area. Moreover, there is uncertainty about the accident scenarios potentially emerging from ship encounters. This paper proposes a Bayesian network (BN) model for reasoning under uncertainty for the assessment of accidental cargo oil outflow in a ship-ship collision where a product tanker is struck. The BN combines a model linking impact scenarios to damage extent with a model for estimating the tank layouts based on limited information regarding the ship. The methodology for constructing the model is presented and output for two accident scenarios is shown. The discussion elaborates on the issue of model validation, both in terms of the BN and in light of the adopted uncertainty/bias-based risk perspective. Copyright Â© 2013 The Authors.

This information could allow the evolution of residues dumped at sea to be tracked. The validity of this process is demonstrated using several experiment acquired over several regions (Dalian and Tianjin coasts in China), in which a tanker accident has occurred and as a consequence oil spillage has taken place. Thus, this purpose of paper is developed for the active surveillance and rapid response to marine oil spills tracking buoys with wirelesscharging equipmentis important and essential to environment protection. It may appears of leak places for the Wire Charging Equipment for marine oil spills tracking buoys monitoring needs, and achieved instant alarm technology and equipment, guarantees leak occurred timely obtained alarm information. In order toproviding oil spill accidents emergency quickly reaction time and prepared.

Reports from the Texas Railroad Commission (1999 to 2015) and the Colorado Oil and Gas Commission (2009 to 2015) were used to examine spill rates from oil and gas well pads. Pollution incident records for England and road transport incident data for the UK were examined as an analogue for potential offsite spills associated with transport for a developing shale industry. The Texas and Colorado spill data shows that the spill rate on the well pads has increased over the recorded time period. The most common spill cause was equipment failure. Within Colorado 33% of the spills recorded were found during well pad remediation and random site inspections. Based on data from the Texas Railroad Commission, a UK shale industry developing well pads with 10 lateral wells would likely experience a spill for every 16 well pads developed. The same well pad development scenario is estimated to require at least 2856 tanker movements over two years per well pad. Considering this tanker movement estimate with incident and spill frequency data from UK milk tankers, a UK shale industry would likely experience an incident on the road for every 12 well pads developed and a road spill for every 19 well pads developed. Consequently, should a UK shale industry be developed it is important that appropriate mitigation strategies are in place to minimise the risk of spills associated with well pad activities and fluid transportation movements.

T.; Indra Permana S., S. T.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nTime reduction of tanker ship spent in the sea should be applied for solving problems occured in oil and gas distribution, such as the unpunctuality of the distribution and oil spilling. The aerodynamic design for some parts that considered as drag generators is presumed to be one of the solution, utilizing our demand of the increasing speed. This paper suggests two examples of the more-aerodynamic design of a part in the tanker that is considered a drag generator, and reports the value of drag generated from the basic and the suggested aerodynamic designs. The new designs are made by adding the NACA airfoil to the cross section of the drag generator. The scenario is assumed with a 39 km/hour speed of tanker, neglecting the hydrodynamic effects occured in the tanker by cutting it at the waterline which separated the drag between air and water. The results of produced drag in each design are calculated by Computational Fluid Dynamic method.\n\nLessons from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill: A biological perspective\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBallachey, Brenda E.; Bodkin, James L.; Esler, Daniel N.; Rice, Stanley D.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOn March 24, 1989, the tanker vessel Exxon Valdez altered its course to avoid floating ice, and ran aground on Bligh Reef in northeastern Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska (Figure 1). The tanker was carrying about 53 million gallons of Prudhoe Bay crude, a heavy oil, and an estimated 11 million gallons spilled (264,000 barrels or about 42 million liters) in what was, prior to the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) spill of 2010, the largest accidental release of oil into U.S. waters (Morris and Loughlin 1994; Spies et al. 1996; Shigenaka 2014). Following the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS), a broad range of studies was implemented and 25 years later, monitoring and research efforts to understand the long-term impacts of the spill continue, although now at a lesser intensity. The Exxon Valdez and DWH spills differed in many ways (Plater 2010; Atlas and Hazen 2011; Sylves and Comfort 2012), but there are also similarities, and lessons from the EVOS experience may offer valuable insights as research efforts proceed in the wake of the DWH spill. Here we provide an overview of the EVOS, summarize key findings from several long-term biological research programs, and conclude with some considerations of lessons learned after two and a half decades of study.\n\nAssessment of Damages to Commercial Fisheries and Marine Environment of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, Resulting from the Seki Oil Spill of March 1994: A Case Study\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPearson, Walter H.; Al-Ghais, Saif M.; Neff, Jerry M.\n\n1998-12-01\n\nHistorically, about half the oil transported through the global marine environment has come through the Arabian Gulf and the annual input of oil to the gulf's marine environment is skewed toward sources connected with marine transport. As a case study, we assess the damages from an oil spill caused by a collision between the crude oil tankers Baynuna and the Seki on 30 March 1994. The collision released approximately 16,000 metric tons (MT) of light Iranian crude oil into the coastal waters of the Emirate of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates. Under the sponsorship of the government of Fujairah, we analyzemoreÂ Â» the effects on commercial fisheries and marine environment of Fujairah resulting from the spill. This analysis was the first comprehensive natural resource damage assessment conducted in this area. The major difficulty was to establish the economic damages associated with the environmental contamination and fisheries declines. We adapt an established compensation schedule to the UA E situation. Information on the amount and type of oil spilled, the amount of oil recovered, the season, the habitats oiled, the resources exposed, and the sensitivity of the resources is then used to establish the conic value of losses associated with environmental contamination and fisheries decline.Â«Â less\n\nPhysical, chemical and biological observations and modeling of oil spills in the Mediterranean Sea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRibotti, A.; De Dominicis, M.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nsuch actions. Illegal discharges of oil from ships are often limited in size and scattered but, surprisingly, their sum is higher than that from oil spills, and they may create a chronic impact of oil in certain areas. For instance littoral sediments affected by low or moderated but continuous oil spills, like the coasts of the Bay of Algeciras (near the Strait of Gibraltar), are more polluted than those affected by accidental oil spills such as during the Prestige accident (2002) (Morales-Caselles et al., 2007). Oil discharges may be also accidental. According to the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Ltd (ITOPF) a lot of pollutions are due to a combination of factors that lead to groundings, collisions, structural failures, fires and explosions.\n\nAnalysis on tank truck accidents involved in road hazardous materials transportation in china.\n\nPubMed\n\nShen, Xiaoyan; Yan, Ying; Li, Xiaonan; Xie, Chenjiang; Wang, Lihua\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDue to the sheer size and capacity of the tanker and the properties of cargo transported in the tank, hazmat tanker accidents are more disastrous than other types of vehicle accidents. The aim of this study was to provide a current survey on the situation of accidents involving tankers transporting hazardous materials in China. Detailed descriptions of 708 tanker accidents associated with hazmat transportation in China from 2004 to 2011 were analyzed to identify causes, location, types, time of occurrence, hazard class for materials involved, consequences, and the corresponding probability. Hazmat tanker accidents mainly occurred in eastern (38.1%) and southwest China (12.3%). The most frequent hazmat tanker accidents involved classes 2, 3, and 8. The predominant accident types were rollover (29.10%), run-off-the-road (16.67%), and rear-end collisions (13.28%), with a high likelihood of a large spill occurring. About 55.93% of the accidents occurred on freeways and class 1 roads, with the spill percentage reaching 75.00% and the proportion of spills that occurred in the total accidents amounting to 77.82%, of which 61.72% are considered large spills. The month with the highest accident probability was July (12.29%), and most crashes occurred during the early morning (4:00-6:00 a.m.) and midday (10:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.) hours, 19.63% versus 16.10%. Human-related errors (73.8%) and vehicle-related defects (19.6%) were the primary reasons for hazmat tanker crashes. The most common outcomes of a hazmat tanker accident was a spill without further events (55.51%), followed by a release with fire (7.77%), and release with an explosion (2.54%).

In Western Canada, proposals that would increase the volume of petroleum transported by pipelines and by tankers through the coastal waters of British Columbia have engaged the province in debate. To ease public concern on the risk of a coastal oil spill, there are additional commitments that involved parties could make. There is evidence to show that the practice of registering vessels under foreign flags of states that have exhibited failure in compliance with international obligations is more common amongst petroleum tankers that have been involved in large-scale oil spills. To prove that they are committed to reducing the risk of oil spills, businesses need to stop registering their vessels under flags of foreign, non-compliant states. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

L.; Coviello, I.; Lacava, T.; Pergola, N.; Tramutoli, V.\n\n2012-04-01\n\nOil spills is one of the main sea pollution sources causing remarkable ecological impact on maritime and coastal environments. Oil spills can derive both from natural phenomena (hurricanes, landslides, earthquakes) and \"human errors\" (tankers collisions, shipwrecks, platform accidents), even if the main contribution to this kind of technological hazard comes from operational discharge from tankers (i.e. oil dumped during cleaning operations) representing 45% of total hydrocarbons marine pollution. Mainly for this reason, the developing of systems able to provide a high frequent sampling and observation of sea surface is fundamental. Satellite remote sensing, thanks to global coverage and continuity of observations, might effectively contribute to mitigate oil spill environmental impact, provided that reliable and effective detection techniques are developed and that relevant information and products are timely delivered and made available. In particular, satellite remote sensing by passive optical sensors on board meteorological satellites, thanks to their high temporal resolution (from a few hours to 15 minutes, depending on the characteristics of the platform/sensor), can give a significant opportunity in this field. Unfortunately, up to now, optical satellite data found a poor application in oil spill alert system mainly for the lack of data analysis techniques suitable for an automatic oil spill detection. The few methods up to now proposed are only able to manually and interactively localize the presence of an already known oil spill, mainly for \"a posteriori\" mapping purpose, often requiring the intervention of an expert operator. In particular, techniques based on Thermal Infrared (TIR) records exploit oil and water different thermal inertia in order to map spill sea pollution. Oil thermal inertia, in fact, is lower than sea water one, so that oil polluted areas usually show Brightness Temperature (BT) higher than sea water in TIR images collected in daytime\n\nContamination and Human Health Risk Assessment of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Oysters After the Wu Yi San Oil Spill in Korea.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoh, Andrew; Yim, Un Hyuk; Ha, Sung Yong; An, Joon Geon; Kim, Moonkoo\n\n2017-07-01\n\nAfter the collision of the Singapore-registered oil tanker M/V Wu Yi San into the oil terminal of Yeosu, Korea on January 31, 2014, approximately 900Â m 3 of oil and oil mixture were released from the ruptured pipelines. The oil affected more than 10Â km of coastline along Gwangyang Bay. Emergency oil spill responses recovered bulk oil at sea and cleaned up the stranded oil on shore. As part of an emergency environmental impact assessment, region-wide monitoring of oil contamination in oyster had been conducted for 2Â months. Highly elevated concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected at most of the spill affected sites. Four days after the spill, the levels of PAHs in oysters increased dramatically to 627-81,000Â ng/g, the average of which was 20 times higher than those found before the spill (321-4040Â ng/g). The level of PAHs in these oysters increased until 10Â days after the spill and then decreased. Due to the strong tidal current and easterly winter winds, the eastern part of the Bay-the Namhae region-was heavily contaminated compared with other regions. The accumulation and depuration of spilled oil in oyster corresponded with the duration and intensity of the cleanup activities, which is the first field observation in oil spill cases. Human health risk assessments showed that benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentrations exceeded levels of concern in the highly contaminated sites, even 60Â days after the spill.\n\nApplication of oil spill model to marine pollution and risk control problems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAseev, Nikita; Agoshkov, Valery; Sheloput, Tatyana\n\n2017-04-01\n\nOil transportation by sea induces challenging problems of environmental control. Millions of tonnes of oil are yearly released during routine ship operations, not to mention vast spills due to different accidents (e.g. tanker collisions, grounding, etc.). Oil pollution is dangerous to marine organisms such as plants, fish and mammals, leading to widespread damage to our planet. In turn, fishery and travel agencies can lose money and clients, and ship operators are obliged to pay huge penalties for environmental pollution. In this work we present the method of accessing oil pollution of marine environment using recently developed oil spill model. The model describes basic processes of the oil slick evolution: oil transport due to currents, drift under the action of wind, spreading on the surface, evaporation, emulsification and dispersion. Such parameters as slick location, mass, density of oil, water content, viscosity and density of \"water-in-oil\" emulsion can be calculated. We demonstrate how to apply the model to damage calculation problems using a concept of average damage to particular marine area. We also formulate the problem of oil spill risk control, when some accident parameters are not known, but their probability distribution is given. We propose a new algorithm to solve such problems and show results of our model simulations. The work can be interesting to broad environmental, physics and mathematics community. The work is supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research grant 16-31-00510.\n\nStudies on marine oil spills and their ecological damage\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMei, Hong; Yin, Yanjie\n\n2009-09-01\n\nThe sources of marine oil spills are mainly from accidents of marine oil tankers or freighters, marine oil-drilling platforms, marine oil pipelines, marine oilfields, terrestrial pollution, oil-bearing atmosphere, and offshore oil production equipment. It is concluded upon analysis that there are two main reasons for marine oil spills: (I) The motive for huge economic benefits of oil industry owners and oil shipping agents far surpasses their sense of ecological risks. (II) Marine ecological safety has not become the main concern of national security. Oil spills are disasters because humans spare no efforts to get economic benefits from oil. The present paper draws another conclusion that marine ecological damage caused by oil spills can be roughly divided into two categories: damage to marine resource value (direct value) and damage to marine ecosystem service value (indirect value). Marine oil spills cause damage to marine biological, fishery, seawater, tourism and mineral resources to various extents, which contributes to the lower quality and value of marine resources.\n\nZipf's Law Application To Oil Spill Detection In The Ocean\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPlatonov, A.; Redondo, J. M.\n\nOne of the results of the CLEAN SEAS European Union project using SAR imaging of European Coastal Waters was the statistical analysis and detection of thousands of oil spills and slicks in the three compared sections, Baltic Sea, North Sea and N.W. Mediterranean. The results of another European Project, OIL WATCH together with the past 30 years of recorded mayor tanker accidental oil spills have been used in a predictive scheme that subject to spatial and temporal normalization of these two different scale processes clearly shows that the annual probability of the occurence of an oil spill follows Zipf's law. Local deviations from the law may be also explained in terms of multifractal analysis.\n\nLong-Term Monitoring of PAH Contamination in Sediment and Recovery After the Hebei Spirit Oil Spill.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Moonkoo; Jung, Jee-Hyun; Ha, Sung Yong; An, Joon Geon; Shim, Won Joon; Yim, Un Hyuk\n\n2017-07-01\n\nApproximately 10,900Â t of crude oil was released 10Â km off the west coast of Korea after the collision between the oil tanker Hebei Spirit and a barge carrying a crane in December 2007. To assess the areal extent and temporal trends of PAH contamination, 428 sediment samples were collected from December 2007 through May 2015 for PAH analysis. Sedimentary PAH concentrations measured immediately after the spill ranged from 3.2 to 71,200Â ngÂ g -1 , with a mean of 3800Â ngÂ g -1 . Increases in PAH concentrations were observed at stations 7-23, which were heavily oiled due to tidal currents and northwesterly wind that transported the spilled oil to these locations. Mean and maximum PAH concentrations decreased drastically from 3800 to 88.5 and 71,200 to 1700Â ngÂ g -1 , respectively, 4Â months after the spill. PAH concentrations highly fluctuated until September 2008 and then decreased slowly to background levels. Reduction rate was much faster at the sandy beaches (kÂ =Â 0.016) than in the muddy sites (kÂ =Â 0.001). In muddy sediments, low attenuation due to low flushing rate in the mostly anaerobic sediment possibly contributed the persistence of PAHs. By May 2015 (~7.5Â years after the spill), mean and maximum PAH concentrations decreased by 54 and 481 times, respectively, compared with the peak concentrations. The sedimentary PAH concentrations in the monitoring area have returned to regional background levels.\n\nArab tankers move downstream\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOppenheim, V.H.\n\nA second oil embargo is expected to be even more effective than the one of 1973 because heavy Arab investment in tankers gives them greater control over the transportation as well as the supply and price of crude oil. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) nations, having used their surplus capital to buy a tanker fleet, can route oil onto their own ships rather than those of competing companies. Faced with increasing vertical integration of the OPEC nations, the International Energy Authority (IEA) finds its emergency plans for oil sharing threatened. Actual size of the Arab tanker fleet ismoreÂ Â» unknown because of joint ventures and the practice of sailing under flags of convenience, but Saudi Arabia is estimated to have enough ships to carry 50 percent of her oil and Arab control to be about 10 percent of the world tanker capacity. Military action in the event of another embargo is more likely if Arab tankers are present in world sea lanes. Involvement of the major international companies with OPEC allocations divides company loyalties between their suppliers and customers. Joint ventures between Arab oil companies and financial lending institutions are increasing, but could be somewhat balanced if legislation were passed requiring that oil for U.S. markets be transported by secure carriers. The use of surplus tankers as mobile storage units has been proposed as a means of stock-piling oil supplies against a future cutback.

In fact, for millions of years crude oil has been seeping up to the Earth`s surface, and for all that time Mother Nature has been on the job with microbes, or bacteria, to harmlessly convert the oil to water and carbon dioxide gas. Not all bacteria are bad. True, some can make us sick, however, the good ones help us bake bread, brew beer, and even clean up oil spills by a process known as biodegradation. Oil and bacteria don`t easily get together because oil and water don`t mix and bacteria prefer to stay inmoreÂ Â» water. After some oil tankers spills in the English Channel 25 years ago, major oil companies (Arco, BP, Exxon, and others) developed oil dispersant products-specialized chemicals that make oils and sea water mix. The simplest examples of similar wetting agents are soaps and detergents. Now, thanks to dispersants, the natural bacteria at sea can easily get to the oil and the normally slow biodegradation process goes rather quickly.Â«Â less\n\nThe Tasman Spirit oil spill: implications for regulatory change in Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nMian, Saima; Bennett, Suzan\n\n2009-07-01\n\nAn oil spill in July 2003 from the tanker Tasman Spirit attracted considerable public and media attention in Pakistan. This paper focuses on the experience of a developing country such as Pakistan in dealing with a major oil spill and its impact on bringing about change in the national regulatory framework. A major outcome has been the ratification of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992, which came into force in March 2006 in Pakistan. The convention provides a compensation mechanism for victims incurring oil pollution damages from maritime casualties involving oil laden ships. Several additional changes are still required to improve the country's ability to cope with marine oil spills. These include the development of a comprehensive domestic regulatory framework, implementation of an effective contingency plan, and capacity building of all relevant agencies.\n\nRisk of large oil spills: a statistical analysis in the aftermath of Deepwater Horizon.\n\nPubMed\n\nEckle, Petrissa; Burgherr, Peter; Michaux, Edouard\n\n2012-12-04\n\nThe oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that followed the explosion of the exploration platform Deepwater Horizon on 20 April 2010 was the largest accidental oil spill so far. In this paper we evaluate the risk of such very severe oil spills based on global historical data from our Energy-Related Severe Accident Database (ENSAD) and investigate if an accident of this size could have been \"expected\". We also compare the risk of oil spills from such accidents in exploration and production to accidental spills from other activities in the oil chain (tanker ship transport, pipelines, storage/refinery) and analyze the two components of risk, frequency and severity (quantity of oil spilled) separately. This detailed analysis reveals the differences in the structure of the risk between different spill sources, differences in trends over time and it allows in particular assessing the risk of very severe events such as the Deepwater Horizon spill. Such top down risk assessment can serve as an important input to decision making by complementing bottom up engineering risk assessment and can be combined with impact assessment in environmental risk analysis.\n\nObservations and analysis of oil spills using polarized imagery\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nIsrael, S. A.; Duncan, M. E.; Johnson, W. R.; Whitehead, V. S.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nOn Saturday, July 28, 1990, a train of barges collided with the Greek tanker Shinoussa in Galveston Bay off Red Fish Island near Texas City, Texas. The first barge sank and the second began to leak while the third barge in the chain and the Shinoussa both escaped without damage. The NASA Flight Science Support Office sponsored a graduate student from SUNY - College of Environmental Science and Forestry and a student from Texas, to survey the damage. The purpose of these surveys was to correlate aircraft base data with orbital data obtained during the Space Shuttle Polarization Experiment and existing laboratory data to evaluate the potential for an application such as oil spill monitoring and mapping. NASA has no charter with the local response agencies to support oil spill monitoring and cleanup.\n\nMIT/marine industry collegium opportunity brief No. 9. oil spills: Problems and opportunities\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNot Available\n\n1977-07-20\n\nThe events occurring during the grounding and break up of the Liberian tanker, Argo Merchant, in December 1976, are used to illustrate the types and magnitudes of problems involved in responding to accidental oil spills. The Argo Merchant incident provides a framework for understanding what is needed for dealing with such events in the future. A chronology of the important events between the grounding and the break up are presented. The need for instrumentation and research to answer the question of 'how much oil has been spilled and where is it likely to go' is dealt with. The equipment andmoreÂ Â» vehicles needed for containment of a spill on the high seas are discussed and then the logistical requirements of getting people and equipment to the spill, containing and collecting oil and removing it are discussed and finally the general characteristics required for two boats and barges are summarized.Â«Â less\n\nIntelligent ship traffic monitoring for oil spill prevention: risk based decision support building on AIS.\n\nPubMed\n\nEide, Magnus S; Endresen, Oyvind; Brett, Per Olaf; Ervik, Jon Leon; RÃ¸ang, Kjell\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThe paper describes a model, which estimates the risk levels of individual crude oil tankers. The intended use of the model, which is ready for trial implementation at The Norwegian Coastal Administrations new VardÃ¸ VTS (Vessel Traffic Service) centre, is to facilitate the comparison of ships and to support a risk based decision on which ships to focus attention on. For a VTS operator, tasked with monitoring hundreds of ships, this is a valuable decision support tool. The model answers the question, \"Which ships are likely to produce an oil spill accident, and how much is it likely to spill?\".\n\nThe threats from oil spills: now, then, and in the future.\n\nPubMed\n\nJernelÃ¶v, Arne\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe ongoing oil spill from the blown-out well by the name of Macondo, drilled by the ill-fated rig Deepwater Horizon, has many features in common with another blowout in the Mexican Gulf that happened three decades ago. Then the oil gushed out from the Ixtoc I well drilled by the Sedco 135-F semi-submersible rig. In the years between these catastrophes, the source and nature of oil spills have undergone large changes. Huge spills from tankers that ran aground or collided used to be what caught the headlines and caused large ecological damage. The number and size of such accidental spills have decreased significantly. Instead, spills from ageing, ill-maintained or sabotaged pipelines have increased, and places like Arctic Russia, the Niger Delta, and the northwestern Amazon have become sites of reoccurring oil pollution. As for blowouts, there is no clear trend with regard to the number of incidences or amounts of spilled oil, but deepwater blowouts are much harder to cap and thus tend to go on longer and result in the release of larger quantities of oil. Also, oil exploration and extraction is moving into ever-deeper water and into stormier and icier seas, increasing potential risks. The risk for reoccurring spills like the two huge Mexican Gulf ones is eminent and must be reduced.\n\nTanker avionics and aircrew complement evaluation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoss, R W; Barbato, G J\n\n1982-11-01\n\nThis paper describes an effort to determine control and display criteria for operating SAC's KC-135 tanker with a reduced crew complement. The Tanker Avionics and Aircrew Complement Evaluation (TAACE) Program was a four-phase effort addressing the control and display design issues associated with operating the tanker without the navigator position. Discussed are: the mission analysis phase, during which the tanker's operational responsibilities were defined and documented; the design phase, during which alternative crew station design concepts were developed; the mockup evaluation phase, which accomplished initial SAC crew member assessment of cockpit designs; and the simulation phase, which validated the useability of the crew system redesign.

The cruise (Aug. 6 - Sept. 7 2009) took place in the Sicily Strait, an area affected by large oil tanker traffic. The cruise plan was organized in order to have the ship within the selected SAR image frames at acquisition time so that the ship could move toward the oil slick and verify it via visual and instrumental inspection. During the cruise, several oil spills, presumably being the result of illegal tank washing, were detected by the PRIMI system and were verified in situ. Preliminary results indicate that SAR and optical satellites are able to detect heavy and thin film oil spills, the maturity of oil spill forecasting models and that further work combining satellite, model and in situ data is necessary to assess the spill severity from the signature in satellite imagery.\n\nDesign of a control configured tanker aircraft\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWalker, S. A.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThe benefits that accrue from using control configured vehicle (CCV) concepts were examined along with the techniques for applying these concepts to an advanced tanker aircraft design. Reduced static stability (RSS) and flutter mode control (FMC) were the two primary CCV concepts used in the design. The CCV tanker was designed to the same mission requirements specified for a conventional tanker design. A seven degree of freedom mathematical model of the flexible aircraft was derived and used to synthesize a lateral stability augmentation system (SAS), a longitudinal control augmentation system (CAS), and a FMC system. Fatigue life and cost analyses followed the control system synthesis, after which a comparative evaluation of the CCV and conventional tankers was made. This comparison indicated that the CCV weight and cost were lower but that, for this design iteration, the CCV fatigue life was shorter. Also, the CCV crew station acceleration was lower, but the acceleration at the boom operator station was higher relative to the corresponding conventional tanker. Comparison of the design processes used in the CCV and conventional design studies revealed that they were basically the same.\n\nThe potential for spills and leaks of hydraulic fracturing related fluids on well sites and from road incidents.\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nClancy, Sarah; Worrall, Fred; Davies, Richard; Gluyas, Jon\n\n2017-04-01\n\nrecovered. The most common cause of leakage each year is equipment failure; these results highlight the need for good regulation and maintenance onsite. The UK's Institute of Directors suggests several shale gas production scenarios for the UK and how this would influence truck movement. One of their scenarios suggests the development of well pads with 10-wells and 40 laterals (one well pad with 10 well each with 4 laterals). This type of well pad would be projected to use 544,000 m3 of water, which would generate between 11155-31288 truck movements over 20 years, or 6.1-17.1 per day if averaged over 5 years. Dairy farmers in the UK produce 11 million m3 of milk a year, which if the tanker has a capacity of 30 m3, equates to approximately 366667 milk tanker journeys a year. This study assesses the number of road incidents and milk tanker spills and predicts the likelihood of such events for fluids involved in hydraulic fracturing.\n\nWetting a rail tanker behind a noise shield.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosmuller, Nils\n\n2009-05-30\n\nIn the Netherlands, the Betuweline is a dedicated freight railway. It will, among other things, be used for transportation of all kinds of hazardous materials from the Port of Rotterdam to the German Hinterland and vice versa. The line is approximately 150 km long. Alongside the line, over more than 100 km noise shields are apparent. The question is to what extent this noise shield hinders the cooling of a rail tanker, carrying flammable liquid such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)? To answer this question, a full scale test was conducted on an already constructed part of the Betuweline [N. Rosmuller, D.W.G. Arentsen, (2005). Praktijkproeven Betuweroute: Instantane uitstroming en koeling 24 juni 2005, Nibra, Arnhem, The Netherlands]. Two railcars and a rail tanker were placed behind a 3m high noise shield. First, it was tested as to whether firemen or water canons should be used to deliver the water. Water canons were best next, four positions of the water canons to wet the rail tanker were tested. Three camera's and three observers recorded the locations and the extent of water that hit the rail tanker. The results indicate that the noise shield, to a large extent, prevents the water from hitting, and therefore cooling, the rail tanker. The upper parts of the rail tanker were minimally struck by the water canons and the small amount of water flowing down the rail tanker did not reach the lower parts of it because of the armatures at the rail tanker. Also, the amount of water in the ditches to be used for wetting was too small. The ditch nearby ran empty. These insights are both relevant to emergency responders for disaster abatement purposes and to water management organizations. The Ministry of Transport is examining the possible strategies to deal with these findings. The results are based upon one single full scale test near a 3m high noise shield. In addition, it would be valuable to determine what the influence would be of other heights of the noise shields.\n\nImpact of the Sea Empress oil spill on lysosomal stability in mussel blood cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nFernley, P W; Moore, M N; Lowe, D M; Donkin, P; Evans, S\n\n2000-01-01\n\nCoastal zones are among the most productive and vulnerable areas on the planet. An example of impact on these fragile environments was shown in the case of the \"Sea Empress\" oil tanker, which ran aground in the Bristol Channel in 1996, spilling 72,000 tons of \"Forties\" crude oil. The objective was to investigate the sub-lethal cellular pathology and tissue hydrocarbon contamination in marine mussel populations, 4 months after the initial spill, using the neutral red retention (NRR) assay for lysosomal stability in blood cells. NRR was reduced in mussels, and indicative of cell injury, from the two sites closest to the spill in comparison with more distant and reference sites. Lysosomal stability was inversely correlated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in mussel tissues. Reduced lysosomal stability has previously been shown to contribute to impaired immunocompetence and to autophagic loss of body tissues. The use of this type of technique is discussed in the context of cost-effective, ecotoxicological tools for Integrated Coastal Zone Management.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKasschau, M.R.; Howard, C.L.\n\nA number of laboratory studies on marine invertebrates have shown changes in free amino acid (FAA) pools in response to various pollutants. During a nineteen-month field study to determine the effects of natural environmental parameters on the FAA pools to the Gulf Coast sea anemone, Bunodosoma cavernata, an oil tanker collision occurred about 8 miles off Galveston Island. The initial spill from the tanker Burma Agate occurred on November 1, 1979 with large leakages continuing for several weeks. There was no visible sign of oil on the first collection date 13 days after the spill, but 11 days later themoreÂ Â» anemones were covered with an oil sheen. As a result of this natural exposure to the oil, the authors decided to monitor the sea anemones for changes in the FAA pool during the oil exposure and recovery period.Â«Â less\n\nOil spills, 1971-75, Gulf of Mexico outer continental shelf\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nDanenberger, Elmer P.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nthe platforms having production spills had only one spill during the period.

Their consequence has a devastating effects on the marine and coastal environment. In order to reduce the environmental impact of such kind of hazard, giving to local authorities necessary information of pollution entity and evolution, timely detection and continuously updated information are fundamental. Satellite remote sensing can give a significant contribution in such a direction. Nowadays, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology has been recognized as the most efficient for oil spill detection and description, thanks to the high spatial resolution and all-time/weather capability of the present operational sensors. Anyway, the actual SARs revisiting time does not allow a rapid detection and near real-time monitoring of these phenomena at global scale. The COSMO-Skymed Italian dual-mission (expected in the 2010) will overcome this limitation improving the temporal resolution until 12 hours by a SAR constellation of four satellites, but several open questions regarding costs and global delivery policy of such data, might prevent their use in an operational context. Passive optical sensors, on board meteorological satellites, thanks to their high temporal resolution (from a few hours to 15 minutes, depending on the characteristics of the platform/sensor), may represent, at this moment, a suitable SAR alternative/complement for oil spill detection and monitoring. Up to now, some techniques have been proposed for mapping known oil spill discharges monitoring using optical satellite data, on the other hand, reliable satellite methods for an automatic and timely detection of oil spill are still currently missing. Existing methods, in fact, can localize the presence of an oil spill only after an alert and\n\nImpact of oil spill from ship on air quality around coastal regions of Korea\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShon, Zang-Ho; Song, Sang-Keun\n\n2010-05-01\n\nRegional air quality around coastal regions, where regular maritime traffic emissions from cargo, other commercial, fishing and military vessels are significantly active, can be affected by their direct emission of primary air pollutants (NOx, SO2, particulate matter (PM), etc.). For instance, harbor traffic exerted an important impact on NO2, SO2, O3, and PM levels. In addition, regional air quality around coastal regions is also affected by oil spill caused by ship accident in the coast. On 7 Dec., 2007, a barge carrying a crane hit the oil tanker MT Hebei Sprit off the west coast of the Republic of Korea, Yellow Sea (approximately 10 km off the coast), at 0700 local time, causing the spill of total estimated 12,547 tons of Iranian heavy (IH) and Kuwait Export (KE) crude oils. Since then, oil began coming on shore late in the night on 7 Dec. More than 150 km of coastline had been identified as being impacted by 17 Dec. Much of the affected area is part of the Taean-gun National Park and the nearest coastal city to spilled area is Taean. On 8 Dec., the flow of oil from the tanker was stopped when the holes were patched. The accident is the worst oil spill in Korea and the spill area is about one-third of the size of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The short- and long-term effects of oil spill on marine environment have been numerously studied, not on atmospheric environment. In this study, the air quality impact near spilled area by the evaporation of hydrocarbons from the oil spill is studied in detail. The evaporation rates of the volatile fractions of the crude oils released by oil spill were estimated based on their mole fractions of crude oils and mass transfer coefficients. Based on a molecular diffusion process, the flux of spilled oil component (Fivap, mol m-2 s-1) can be expressed as follows: Fivap = Kivap(Civap - Câvap) (1) where Civap is concentration (mol m-3) of a component i of crude oil vapor in the air at the oil-air interface; Câvap is the\n\n33 CFR 164.39 - Steering gear: Foreign tankers.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 33 Navigation and Navigable Waters 2 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Steering gear: Foreign tankers. 164.39 Section 164.39 Navigation and Navigable Waters COAST GUARD, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (CONTINUED) PORTS AND WATERWAYS SAFETY NAVIGATION SAFETY REGULATIONS Â§ 164.39 Steering gear: Foreign tankers...\n\nGeochemical changes in crude oil spilled from the Exxon Valdez supertanker into Prince William Sound, Alaska\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHostettler, Frances D.; Kvenvolden, Keith A.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nNorth Slope crude oil spilled from the T/VÂ Exxon ValdezÂ in March 1989 and contaminated about 500 km of Prince William Sound shoreline. Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in oil samples collected in August 1990 and June 1992 from beaches on six islands impacted by the spill have been compared with the hydrocarbons from North Slope crude oil taken from the stricken tanker. Degradation processes have changed the physical appearance of this residual spilled oil; the beached oil as collected ranged from a light brown color, to a heavy black viscous oil, to a black, powder-like residue. In these physically different samples, terpane, sterane, and aromatic sterane distributions, as well as carbon isotope values, are similar and correlate with the originalÂ Exxon ValdezÂ oil. On the other hand,Â n-alkanes, isoprenoids, and many of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are present in the original crude oil are dramatically altered in the oil samples collected from the beaches.\n\nAir-cushion tankers for Alaskan North Slope oil\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAnderson, J. L.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nA concept is described for transporting oil from the Arctic to southern markets in 10,000-ton, chemically fueled air-cushion vehicles (ACV's) configured as tankers. Based on preliminary cost estimates the conceptual ACV tanker system as tailored to the transportation of Alaskan North Slope oil could deliver the oil for about the same price per barrel as the proposed trans-Alaska pipeline with only one-third of the capital investment. The report includes the description of the conceptual system and its operation; preliminary cost estimates; an appraisal of ACV tanker development; and a comparison of system costs, versatility, vulnerability, and ecological effect with those of the trans-Alaska pipeline.\n\nMortality among seamen with special reference to work on tankers.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoen, B E; Riise, T; Helseth, A\n\n1994-08-01\n\nSeveral studies demonstrate a high mortality among seamen but this has not been related to different types of work on board. This study examined a possible relationship between work on tankers and mortality. Tankers differ from other ships by carrying different types of oil, oil products and other chemicals. Mortality was studied in 1687 men who were captains and mates during the period 1970-1987, and were registered by a Norwegian census in 1970. The data were linked to the Norwegian Register of Death Certificates. In all 181 deaths were found. Each case was age-matched at time of death to three individuals from the rest of the population alive at this date. Information about the seamen's work on different ships was obtained for cases and controls. The data were analysed using multivariate conditional logistic regression. Seamen working on tankers had a higher mortality rate ratio (RR = 2.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.65-3.60) than seamen who had not been working on tankers. The increased risk was especially related to death from cancer and from accidents, while no significantly increased mortality due to cardiovascular diseases was found. Employment as a mate on tankers showed the highest all-causes risk of death (RR = 3.14, 95% CI: 2.04-4.82) as well as for cancer (RR = 4.24, 95% CI: 2.02-8.88) and accidents (RR = 5.85, 95% CI: 1.66-20.60). Employment as a captain on tankers showed no significantly increased mortality. Exposure to chemicals on tankers may be related to the increased mortality, as this is the major difference between tankers and other ships and mates are exposed to chemical agents, while captains are not.\n\nStudy of VLCC tanker ship damage stability during off-shore operation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHanzu-Pazara, R.; Arsenie, P.; Duse, A.; Varsami, C.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nToday, for the carriage of crude oil on sea are used larger tanker ships, especially from VLCC class. The operation of this type of ships requires in many cases special conditions, mainly related to water depth in the terminal area and enough maneuvering space for entrance and departure. Because, many ports from all over the world don't have capacity to operate this type of ships inside, in designed oil terminal, have chosen for development of outside terminals, off-shore oil terminals. In case of this type of terminals, the problems of water depth and manoeuvring space are fixed, but other kind of situations appears, regarding the safety in operation and environment factors impact on ship during mooring at oil transfer buoy. In the present paper we intend to show a study made using simulation techniques about VLCC class tanker ship in case of a damage condition resulted after a possible collision with another ship during loading operation at an off-shore terminal. From the beginning, we take in consideration that the ship intact stability, during all loading possible situations, has to be high enough, so that in case of some damage with flooding of different compartments due to hypothetical dimension water hole, the ship stability in the final stage of flooding to correspond to the requirements for damage stability and, also, to complementary requirements for damage ship stability.\n\nTemporal estimates of genetic diversity in some Mytilus galloprovincialis populations impacted by the Prestige oil-spill\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLado-Insua, Tanya; PÃ©rez, Montse; Diz, Angel P.; Presa, Pablo\n\n2011-04-01\n\nThe sinking of the tanker Prestige in November 2002 off the coast of Galicia resulted in the release of about 60,000 tons of heavy oil. The oil-spill provoked a serious environmental impact in Spanish and French coasts, which biological consequences are still being assessed. In this study we address the temporal dynamics of genetic diversity in some mussel populations impacted by the oil-spill. Changes in genetic diversity can be measured in natural populations provided that serial samples are available from before (year 2000) and after (years 2003, 2005) the oil-spill. Analyses of seven microsatellites indicate a weak but significant increase of genetic variation after the spill. This phenomenon is interpreted herein in terms of a balance between a enhanced genome mutability on microsatellite variation and a low genetic drift due to toxicants and asphyxia although other stochastic phenomena cannot be ruled out. Per locus annotation showed that in spite of the allelic changes observed in the period 2000-2005, the final size of most allelic series remained quite alike to those of year 2000. Present genetic data suggest that the genotoxic impact of the Prestige spill did not compromise the genetic diversity of studied mussel populations, at least regarding the genetic markers analysed.\n\nAssessment of the fitness of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis two years after the Hebei Spirit oil spill.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonaghy, Ludovic; Hong, Hyun-Ki; Kim, Moonkoo; Park, Heung-Sik; Choi, Kwang-Sik\n\n2016-12-15\n\nIn December 2007, >150km of the West coast of Korea were heavily polluted by crude oil leaked from the oil tanker Hebei Spirit, leading to mass mortality of bivalve mollusks on the intertidal areas. Two years after, mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis were collected from two impacted sites to investigate sub-lethal effects of the oil spill. Tissue content in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hemocyte parameters, reproductive status and energetic reserves were analyzed. PAHs in tissues of mussels as well as hemocyte parameters were not different between impacted and control sites. Energetic reserves were altered in mussels from the impacted sites. Glycogen content remained low at polluted sites, whatever the season. Two years after the Hebei Spirit oil spill, mussels then presented altered energetic metabolism. Further investigations are thus warranted to monitor the sustainability of mussel populations on the oil spilled West coast of Korea. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Actually, what is really changed is the satellite image availability. From the late 1990's, in the age of \"no data\" we have moved forward 15 years to the age of \"Sentinels\" with an abundance of data. Either large accident related to offshore oil exploration and production activity or illegal discharges from tankers, oil on the sea surface is or can be now regularly monitored, over European Waters. National and transnational organizations (i.e. European Maritime Safety Agency's 'CleanSeaNet' Service) are routinely using SAR imagery to detect oil due to it's all weather, day and night imaging capability. However, all these years the scientific methodology on the detection remains relatively constant. From manual analysis to fully automatic detection methodologies, no significant contribution has been published in the last years and certainly none has dramatically changed the rules of the detection. On the contrary, although the overall accuracy of the methodology is questioned, the four main classification steps (dark area detection, features extraction, statistic database creation, and classification) are continuously improving. In recent years, researchers came up with the use of polarimetric SAR data for oil spill detection and characterizations, although utilization of Pol-SAR data for this purpose still remains questionable due to lack of verified dataset and low spatial coverage of Pol-SAR data. The present paper is trying to point out the drawbacks of the oil spill detection in the last years and focus on the bottlenecks of the oil spill detection methodologies. Also, solutions on the basis of data availability, management and analysis are proposed. Moreover, an ideal detection system is discussed regarding satellite image and in situ observations using different scales and sensors.\n\nChemical demulsification of tanker crude emulsions. Memorandum report\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLittle, R.C.\n\n1980-02-13\n\nThe chemical demulsification of tanker crude emulsions was studied as a function of oil type (light vs. heavy crude), demulsifier concentrations, and temperature. Aerosol OT shows promise as a chemical demulsifier of tanker crude emulsions provided that ambient temperatures are not too cold and that an appropriate concentration range is used for specific oil. The evaporation rates and viscosities of the six crudes studied are also reported in the text.\n\nHard aground: the story of the Argo Merchant oil spill\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWinslow, R.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nOn December 15, 1976, the Argo Merchant, an aging Liberian tanker, went aground on a sandy shoal southeast of Nantucket Island with 7.6 million gallons of industrial heating oil aboard. So begins the story of the largest coastal oil spill in the U.S. history. This book focuses on the effort to save the crew and cargo of the Argo Merchant from the fifty-knot winds and towering seas of a North Atlantic gale. At the center of the story is the U.S. Coast Guard Atlantic Strike Team. Specially trained to fight oil spills, the team was lowered by helicopter to themoreÂ Â» pitching deck of the dead vessel. After six tense days, they had to admit defeat. The Argo Merchant could not be refloated, and the violent seas prevented off-loading the oil onto another vessel. Under the pounding of the waves, the Argo Merchant had begun to break up. This men-against-the-sea tale and documentary show how vulnerable the nation's coastline is to oil spills. In this case, the entire cargo drifted out to sea, but next time we may not be so lucky. Every day, the United States imports the equivalent of more than forty Argo Merchants full of oil, much of it in outdated, marginally operated ships like the Argo Merchant itself.Â«Â less\n\nAllocation model for air tanker initial attack in firefighting\n\nTreesearch\n\nFrancis E.

The $150 million tanker, which was due for completion in 1979, would have been the largest tanker ever built for independent ownership under the U.S. flag, according to Zapata. Most of the materials had been bought, but little shipyard labor had been expended. According to W. H. Flynn (Zapata Corp.), when the ship was ordered in June 1974, the world tanker market was expected to improve by 1979, but instead the slump has continued; the loss owing to themoreÂ Â» cancellation is less than one year's trading losses under the market conditions now projected for 1979-80.Â«Â less\n\nChanges in the marine pollution management system in response to the Amorgos oil spill in Taiwan.\n\nPubMed\n\nChiau, Wen-Yen\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe Marine Pollution Control Act (MPCA) of Taiwan was promulgated on November 1, 2000, with the specific aim of controlling marine pollution, safeguarding public health, and promoting the sustainable use of marine resources. In addition to land-based pollution, oil spills are one of the most significant threats to the local marine environment largely on account of the some 30,000 tankers which pass through Taiwan's coastal waters each year. In January 2001, two months after the enactment of this newly-introduced law, a Greek merchant vessel, the Amorgos ran aground in the vicinity of a national park on the southern tip of Taiwan, causing a serious oil spill and leading to considerable changes with regard to the marine pollution management system. The incident brought to the forefront many serious problems, such as a lack of experience, expertise as well as equipment required to respond to such disasters, as well as the ambiguous, unclear jurisdiction among related agencies. Thus, this paper reviews the incident of the Amorgos spill, identifies the major issues and lessons learned, and proposes several recommendations in an effort for Taiwan to further improve its marine pollution management system.\n\nSuperfluid Helium Tanker (SFHT) study\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEberhardt, Ralph N.; Dominick, Sam M.; Anderson, John E.; Gille, John P.; Martin, Tim A.; Marino, John S.; Paynter, Howard L.; Traill, R. Eric; Herzl, Alfred; Gotlib, Sam\n\n1988-01-01\n\nReplenishment of superfluid helium (SFHe) offers the potential of extending the on-orbit life of observatories, satellite instruments, sensors and laboratories which operate in the 2 K temperature regime. A reference set of resupply customers was identified as representing realistic helium servicing requirements and interfaces for the first 10 years of superfluid helium tanker (SFHT) operations. These included the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), the Particle Astrophysics Magnet Facility (Astromag), and the Microgravity and Materials Processing Sciences Facility (MMPS)/Critical Point Phenomena Facility (CPPF). A mixed-fleet approach to SFHT utilization was considered. The tanker permits servicing from the Shuttle cargo bay, in situ when attached to the OMV and carried to the user spacecraft, and as a depot at the Space Station. A SFHT Dewar ground servicing concept was developed which uses a dedicated ground cooling heat exchanger to convert all the liquid, after initial fill as normal fluid, to superfluid for launch. This concept permits the tanker to be filled to a near full condition, and then cooled without any loss of fluid. The final load condition can be saturated superfluid with any desired ullage volume, or the tank can be totally filed and pressurized. The SFHT Dewar and helium plumbing system design has sufficient component redundancy to meet fail-operational, fail-safe requirements, and is designed structurally to meet a 50 mission life usage requirement. Technology development recommendations were made for the selected SFHT concept, and a Program Plan and cost estimate prepared for a phase C/D program spanning 72 months from initiation through first launch in 1997.\n\nManned mission to Mars with periodic refueling from electrically propelled tankers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGogan, Laura; Melko, Joseph; Wang, Fritz; Lourme, Daniel; Moha, Sophie Ben; Lardon, Christele; Richard, Muriel\n\n1992-01-01\n\nIn a joint study by students from the Ecole Polytechnique Feminine, France, and the University of California, Los Angeles, a mission concept that had the objective of evaluating the feasibility of a non-nuclear, yet fast, manned mission to Mars was considered. Ion-engine propelled tankers are postulated that would provide mid-coarse refueling of LOX and LH2 to the manned ship. The scenario is therefore one of a 'split mission', yet with the added feature that the cargo ships include tankers for mid-course refueling. The present study is a continuation of one first conducted last year. Emphasis this year was on the design of the tanker fleet.\n\nChallenges to oil spill assessment for seabirds in the deep ocean\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHaney, J. Christopher; Jodice, Patrick G. R.; Montevecchi, William; Evers, David C.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe synthesize impediments for evaluating effects to seabirds from open ocean hydrocarbon releases. Effects on seabirds from ship discharges, spills, and well blowouts often are poorly detected and monitored far from land. Regulatory regimes for ocean spills can result in monitoring efforts that are not entirely transparent. We illustrate how interdisciplinary technologies address deficits that hamper individual or population level assessments for seabirds, and we demonstrate where emerging technologies might be engaged to bridge gaps in oil spill monitoring. Although acute mortality from direct oil exposure poses the greatest risk to seabirds, other hazards from light-attraction, flaring, collisions, chronic pollution, and hydrocarbon inhalation around oil infrastructure also may induce bird mortality in the deep ocean.\n\nTanker Argus: Re-supply for a LEO Cryogenic Propellant Depot\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSt. Germain, B.; Olds, J.; Kokan, T.; Marcus, L.; Miller, J.\n\nThe Argus reusable launch vehicle (RLV) concept is a single-stage-to-orbit conical, winged bodied vehicle powered by two liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen supercharged ejector ramjets. The 3rd generation Argus launch vehicle utilizes advanced vehicle technologies along with a Maglev launch assist track. A tanker version of the Argus RLV is envisioned to provide an economical means of providing liquid fuel and oxidizer to an orbiting low-Earth orbit (LEO) propellant depot. This depot could then provide propellant to various spacecraft, including reusable orbital transfer vehicles used to ferry space solar power satellites to geo-stationary orbit. Two different tanker Argus configurations were analyzed. The first simply places additional propellant tanks inside the payload bay of an existing Argus reusable launch vehicle. The second concept is a modified Argus RLV in which the payload bay is removed and the vehicle propellant tanks are stretched to hold extra propellant. An iterative conceptual design process was used to design both Argus vehicles. This process involves various disciplines including aerodynamics, trajectory analysis, weights &structures, propulsion, operations, safety, and cost/economics. The payload bay version of tanker Argus, which has a gross mass of 256.3MT, is designed to deliver a 9.07MT payload to LEO. This payload includes propellant and the tank structure required to secure this propellant in the payload bay. The modified, pure tanker version of Argus has a gross mass of 218.6MT and is sized to deliver a full 9.07MT of propellant to LEO. The economic analysis performed for this study involved the calculation of many factors including the design/development and recurring costs of each vehicle. These results were used along with other economic assumptions to determine the \"per kilogram\" cost of delivering propellant to orbit. The results show that for a given flight rate the \"per kilogram\" cost is cheaper for the pure tanker version of Argus\n\n78 FR 50335 - Double Hull Tanker Escorts on the Waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-08-19\n\n...-AB96 Double Hull Tanker Escorts on the Waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska AGENCY: Coast Guard, DHS... mandates two tug escorts for double hull tankers over 5,000 gross tons transporting oil in bulk in PWS.

To minimize the ecological damage and optimize rapid response, emergency managers need to be informed with how fast and where oil will spread as soon as possible after a spill. The state-of-the-art operational oil spill forecast modeling system improves the oil spill response into a new stage. However uncertainty due to predicted data inputs often elicits compromise on the reliability of the forecast result, leading to misdirection in contingency planning. Thus understanding the forecast uncertainty and reliability become significant. In this paper, Monte Carlo simulation is implemented to provide parameters to generate forecast probability maps. The oil spill forecast uncertainty is thus quantified by comparing the forecast probability map and the associated hindcast simulation. A HyosPy-based simple statistic model is developed to assess the reliability of an oil spill forecast in term of belief degree. The technologies developed in this study create a prototype for uncertainty and reliability analysis in numerical oil spill forecast modeling system, providing emergency managers to improve the capability of real time operational oil spill response and impact assessment.

The capacity of the autochthonous bacterial communities to respond to the oil spill was assessed indirectly by determining the hydrocarbon profiles of weathered oil samples collected along the shore, as well as through isotope ratios of seawater-dissolved CO2, and directly by analyses of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints and 16S rRNA gene libraries. Overall, the results evidenced biodegradation of crude oil components mediated by natural bacterial communities, with a bias towards lighter and less substituted compounds. The changes observed in the Proteobacteria, the most abundant phylum in marine sediments, were related to the metabolic profiles of the sediment. The presence of crude oil in the supratidal and intertidal zones increased the abundance of Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, dominated by the groups Sphingomonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Chromatiales, whilst Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria were more relevant in subtidal zones. The phylum Actinobacteria, and particularly the genus Rhodococcus, was a key player in the microbial response to the spill, especially in the degradation of the alkane fraction. The addition of inorganic fertilizers enhanced total biodegradation rates, suggesting that, in these environments, nutrients were insufficient to support significant growth after the huge increase in carbon sources, as evidenced in other spills. The presence of bacterial communities able to respond to a massive oil input in this area was consistent with the important history of pollution of the region by crude oil.\n\nFlume tank studies to elucidate the fate and behavior of diluted bitumen spilled at sea.\n\nPubMed\n\nKing, Thomas L; Robinson, Brian; Boufadel, Michel; Lee, Kenneth\n\n2014-06-15\n\nAn economical alternative to conventional crudes, Canadian bitumen, harvested as a semi-liquid, is diluted with condensate to make it viable to transport by pipeline to coastal areas where it would be shipped by tankers to global markets. Not much is known about the fate of diluted bitumen (dilbit) when spilled at sea. For this purpose, we conducted dilbit (Access Western Blend; AWB and Cold Lake Blend; CLB) weathering studies for 13 days in a flume tank containing seawater. After six days of weathering, droplets detached from the AWB slick and were dense enough to sink in seawater. The density of CLB also increased, but at a slower rate compared to AWB, which was attributed to the high concentration of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in it, which are more resistant to weathering. An empirical, Monod-type model was introduced and was found to closely simulate the increase in oil density with time. Such a model could be used within oil spill models.
