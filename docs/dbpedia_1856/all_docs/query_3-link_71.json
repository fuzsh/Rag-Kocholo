        "text": "my heart and prayers go to those that lost their family in the landslide in Pupua New Guinea on last Friday. Let‚Äôs not lose hope as the search and rescue team continue their work and let‚Äôs pray for miracles for more survivors.\n\nGreat to be back in this beautiful country of Papua New Guinea to commission the expansion of our fuels terminal in Port Moresby, positioning Mobil to be the reliable, trusted supplier of quality fuels that is essential to the economic development of this country. #papuanewguinea #reliability #fuels\n\nWe are so excited to collaborate with dnata to provide Esso Renewable Diesel R20 in support of dnata's and Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore‚Äôs sustainability goals. Renewable diesel is an engine-ready GHG emission-reduction solution that leverages our existing supply capabilities to customers. The partnership reflects our ability to offer lower-GHG emission solutions for the transportation sector, in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nWe are so excited to collaborate with dnata to provide Esso Renewable Diesel R20 in support of dnata's and Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore‚Äôs sustainability goals.

The topic ‚ÄúA Renewed Sustainability Agenda for AP‚Äù is certainly one that is close to my heart. Glad to have the opportunity to share what ExxonMobil has been doing in this space including Carbon Capture and Storage and Lower Emission Fuels #hongkong #apec #sustainabilty #ExxonMobil #CarbonCapture #Emission\n\nBecoming an engineer has always been my childhood dream. Didn‚Äôt make it after all, but glad to have many chance to wear PPE and visit sites under construction pretending to be one üòú #exxonmobil #chemical #petrochemical #dayawan #engineer"
