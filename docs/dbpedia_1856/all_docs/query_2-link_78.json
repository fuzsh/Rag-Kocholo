        "text": "Port Overview\n\nPuerto Quetzal, UN/LOCODE GTPRQ, also known as PTO QUETZAL,QUETZAL is located on the southwestern Pacific Ocean coast of Guatemala about 55 kilometres northwest of the border with El Salvador. It is Guatemala’s biggest Pacific Ocean port, important for both cargo and as a stop-over for cruise passengers, located about five kilometres east of Guatemala’s Port of San Jose; 98 kilometres from Guatemala City, about 80 minutes on the highway to Puerto Quetzal.\n\nIt is the gateway for solid bulk and containers from Guatemala, and for fuels for the western part of the country. Likewise, it is the door through which sugar and its derivatives such as molasses and alcohols are exported. It has an annual container throughput capacity of 450,000 TEU’s (2022) and is currently the largest facility between the port of Lázaro Cardenas in México, and the Panama Canal, on the west coast of Central America. It is the only terminal in Guatemala capable of handling 10,000 TEU vessels due to its 14.5 m max. draft.\n\nPuerto Quetzal has a privileged geographical position in the Central America Region as it is situated in an equidistant point to the Panama Canal and the big Mexican ports in the Pacific.\n\nThe Empresa Portuaria Quetzal is the institution responsible for the management and administration of Puerto Quetzal; they foresee that in 2023 Puerto Quetzal will be an intelligent port, the first of its kind in all of Central America, the third or fourth in Latin America excluding Panama.\n\nAPM Container Terminal, https://www.apmterminals.com/en/puerto-quetzal , is the main terminal operator, according to its master plan [1mn TEU’s / year] it should have carried out its second phase of invetsments, which is another berth, equipment and yards, in 2019. Due to a current legal situation with the Guatemalan government, it has not been done, so the capacity of the port has already reached its limit above 60%, and that the international demand is very high, so it is required that the expansion phase continue that it had in its port conception plan when it began operations. If more investments are not made, there will be more and more congestion with delays in container export cargo.\n\nAt the closure of the present LCA edition 2022, the Guatemalan government is currently negotiating with APM the purchase of the container terminal.\n\nAPM Institutional video Puerto Quetzal: https://youtu.be/yow5OBs2NQM\n\nPort website:www.puertoquetzal.gob\n\nKey port information may also be found at:http://www.maritime-database.com\n\nPort Picture\n\nPuerto Quetzal facilities can accommodate Panamax-size vessels and can serve carriers of solid and liquid bulk cargoes, containers, roll-on/roll-off cargoes, cruise fleets, fishing boats, sailboats, frigates, and recreational vessels. The port authority or the Empresa Portuaria Quetzal operates and administers the port functions. The harbour of this port is sheltered by breakwaters. The main dock is near the eastern side of the harbour and is 1,140 meters long.\n\nThe port contains 437 thousand square meters of storage space, 5.6 thousand square meters of warehouse, 8 thousand square meters of sheds, and an open storage area of 21.3 thousand square meters. An additional 2.1 thousand square meters is available for handling roll-on/roll-off cargoes, and 16.4 thousand square meters is available for vehicles. Its facilities are home to the largest storage facilities for grain, fuel, molasses, sugar and other solid and liquid cargo that moves in the port.\n\nList of the areas identified in the Port Picture: http://www.puertoquetzal.gob.gt/muelle/\n\nIndex\n\nhttp://www.puerto-quetzal.com/wp-content/themes/total-child-theme/files/_1589480470_9028_directorio2020-FINAL_2020(1).pdf\n\nFor more information on port contacts, please see the following link: 4.4 Port and Waterways Companies Contact List.\n\nPort Performance\n\nIt is the only terminal in Guatemala capable of handling 10,000 TEU vessels due to its 14.5 m max. draft.\n\nThe port can handle huge vessels and is operational all year.

The depth is 11m BHZ.\n\nPort Handling Equipment\n\nIs the port equipment managed by the government or privately? Privately\n\nCurrently operating at around 60% capacity, the terminal is equipped with three Super Post Panamax Ship-to-Shore cranes (20 container outreach) on a 350m quay. With 610 reefer plugs, the terminal handles fruits and vegetables, coffee, grains, fertilizer, fish, cotton, textiles and tobacco.\n\nContainer Facilities\n\nTerminal A for full containers: 10,680 m² / 768 TEU’s\n\nTerminal B for full containers and reefers: 16,418 m² / 1,104 TEU’s Terminal C for full containers: 16,400 m² / 1,174 TEU’s\n\nContainer yard APM: 130,000 m2\n\nContainer yard (Private company Cobigua): 14,128 m² / 1,125 TEU’s\n\nContainer yard (Private company Almasilos): 4,000 m² / 200 TEU’s\n\nContainer yard (Private company Maersk Sealand): 16,400 m² / 1,176 TEU’s\n\nContainer yard (Private company Servicios Portuarios): 42,230 m² / 4,450 TEU’s\n\nCustoms Guidance\n\nThere are no unique customs formalities for Port of Quetzal. Inside Port Quetzal the SAT office is the busiest customs office from Guatemala, followed by Santo Tomas and Guatemalan central customs office.When all necessary documentation is presented to the customs authorities and OIRSA, https://www.oirsa.org/ the cargo release process will take an estimate of 5 or 6 days from the time the vessel arrives until cargo is release. The Government of Guatemala has launched since May 2021 a new project with the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation that will simplify, standardise, and digitise documentation and procedures at its major ports, with benefits that can ripple across its economy. Shipping companies, terminal operators, and captains will spend less time meeting administrative demands when ships arrive, dock at, or leave Guatemalan ports. For the public sector, the switch to automated processes will ease the controls performed by customs, health, agriculture, and immigration authorities and permit more effective coordination. The time saved by improving authorisation and inspection processes can allow ports to receive more ships and save operators as much as USD 3,000 in operational costs per hour for each vessel. Delays in port arrivals and departures stemming from incorrect paperwork and discoordination among several actors can cost ships their place at port berths and lead to late fees and time lost in loading or unloading cargo.\n\nPuerto Quetzal Customs\n\nKilometer 111 of the Central American Highway number CA-9 South, Puerto Quetzal.

Most operations are carried out at the Airport International La Aurora -AILA-, serving around 300 daily operations between aviation commercial, military aviation and general aviation; commercial airline flights include direct routes with same-day arrival to more than ten countries, including the US, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. In Guatemala there are aviation and aerial work companies that offer flight services charter, regular passenger transport, aerial photography, aerial advertising, fumigation, mail, securities and cargo, as well as aircraft rental for personalized trips, among which are Guatemalan Air Transport –TAG–, Aero Ruta Maya, Tropic Air, Helicopters of Guatemala, among others.\n\nThe National Airport Network –RAN– is made up of by three international category airports and national or domestic category aerodromes.\n\nThe general aviation activity is private and is offered to through small private aircraft. Nevertheless general aviation is oriented to serve those areas of agro-industrial production, which by operating requirements or accessibility problems, uses small aircraft with a average load of ten quintals. At the national level, general aviation mainly provides services in the Pacific Coast in the Departments of Jutiapa, Santa Rosa, San Marcos, Retalhuleu, Quetzaltenango, Suchitepéquez and Escuintla.\n\nThe Ministry of Communication, Infrastructures and Housing, through the Civil Aeronautic General Direction (DGAC) is the civil aviation authority of Guatemala. DCAG is responsible for all traffic air control, airport administration, functioning and acquisition of all aircrafts in the country. Its headquarters is on the property of La Aurora International Airport in zone 13 of Guatemala City.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA), according to figures from their economic area, as of May 2022, passenger traffic in the Americas showed a clear recovery. Both North America and Latin America and the Caribbean lead the recovery of the sector worldwide, with 90% and 84% of the volumes of 2019, respectively.\n\nThe Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil de Guatemala (DGAC) is aware that the country's aviation has been able to recover faster than previously believed, as the load and start-up of infrastructure in the interior increased, but acknowledges there are still some problems at i. e. La Aurora airport. This international airport serving Guatemala City, before the Covid pandemic, registered 44 flights a day; in September 2020 it restarted with 5 daily services and currently in 2022 between 35 and 55 services is operated per day.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA), Central America, Cuba Ecuador and Venezuela representative stated on a recent analysis that the significant challenges for the growth of air transport in Guatemala are: the delay in infrastructure investments; the lack of a national civil aviation plan; the lack of clarity in the roles and responsibilities of airport authorities; and the updating of digital processes that facilitate the import and export of goods. IATA also recommends the separation of roles of regulator in matters of civil aviation and the airport operator. These two functions are currently performed by the General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics,\n\nOn the other side, the current Guatemalan government is firmly focused in the construction of a Cargo Airport, in the operative Escuintla Air Base San José, Escuintla. The plans are to create an industrial and commercial area on the south coast, which includes the airport as part of cargo logistics. In the short term, the Government will look for this to become the alternate airport of La Aurora, because when there is bad weather or some situation such as volcanic eruptions, operations have had to be closed and the planes have had to fly to other alternate airports such as El Salvador, Cancun, Mexico or San José, Costa Rica representing high expenses for airlines and all air operators.\n\nRunway conditions\n\nThe DGAC stated that on 2022 the Guatemala Government has carried out the maintenance of all country's airports and airfields. Maintenance and marking was completed on all the tracks in the country, including the last ones in Cobán, Alta Verapaz; already in optimal conditions. In some cases the runway has been re asphalted, such as the one in Esquipulas, Chiquimula, which is already being used by domestic flights. Similar work was also done with the San Marcos runway.\n\nThe DGAC administrates two international airports and other national airports.\n\nInternational Airports\n\nAeropuerto Internacional La Aurora, Ciudad de Guatemala\n\nAeropuerto Internacional Mundo Maya, Santa Elena, Peten\n\nNational Airports (*)\n\nAeropuerto de Quetzaltenango, Quetzaltenango\n\nAeropuerto de Puerto San Jose, Puerto San Jose\n\nAeropuerto de Puerto Barrios, Puerto Barrios\n\nAeropuerto de Sn Marcos, San Marcos\n\nAeropuerto de Retalhuleu, Retalhuleu\n\nAeropuerto de Coatepeque, Coatepeque\n\nAeropuerto de Huehuetenango, Huehuetenango\n\n(*) non limited list\n\nFor more information on government agency and airport company contact information, please see the following links: 4.1 Government Contact List and 4.5 Airport Companies Contact List .\n\nProcedures for Foreign Registered Aircraft\n\nInternational flight from and to Guatemala are subject to the Annex 9 of the convention on International Civil Aviation.

The country Road Network has a growth ratio of 216 kilometres per year. https://caminos.gob.gt/mapas-de-la-red-vial.html\n\nPrimary highways are double-lined and paved. Most are in rather poor conditions with the exception of the highway to Puerto Quetzal which is a double-lined new highway with one toll booth. Secondary roads in the coastal areas are paved/dirt highways in relatively good condition. Heavy trailer (sugar cane transport) can be expected in the sugar cane harvesting seasons anywhere between October and March, which causes traffic and leaves highways littered with debris. The rest of the secondary roads connecting small villages and towns to larger centres are not paved and their conditions vary depending on the season. Between May and November, heavy rains can make most dirt roads restricted to 4 wheel drive vehicles. Large trucks have very little access during this time.\n\nIn the highlands of Guatemala, roads are terraced and unpaved through the mountain areas. Rains and fog can make these routes difficult to access. The highway which extends into the Peten is a flat and paved highway. Heavy tractor trailer traffic can be expected on the Atlantic highway through to Puerto Barrios making the route dangerous, particularly in the mountain areas closer to Guatemala City.\n\nRoad transport is the dominant mode in the domestic and intra-regional trade (approximately 82% in imports by weight and 76% in exports), as well as for the internal segments of extra-regional trade. This sector has profound weaknesses: overloading is a recurring problem and there is no efficient control, which in turn time affects the poor condition of the roads already mentioned. There is few or no control at origin, the 14 fixed scales that exist in Puerto Quetzal are not certified by the authorities of traffic control (there are scales but they are private) and the calibration is not consistent inside and outside the port.\n\nSince there is practice of overloading containers, leaving the port it is necessary to control them, but up to now there were only 2 operational mobile scales (within port premises); 20 scales along the main axes are in planning.\n\nThe vehicle fleet (heavy transport truck units) has an average age of 18 years. Vehicles used for transport to the domestic market are in poor condition and there is a lack of refrigerated units. Informality is also high.\n\nHowever it is important to outline the expansion of the CA-9 North road network in Guatemala. This corridor crosses the country from the Pacific to the Atlantic and is particularly relevant for the transport of textiles –which reported exports for 1,030 million USD in 2020–; fruits (850 million USD); mineral fuels and oils ($508 million); paper and cardboard (330 million USD); plastics and rubbers (326 million USD); allowing the exit of products to Asia and the West Coast of the United States through Puerto Quetzal and to Europe and the East Coast of the United States through Puerto Barrios and Puerto Santo Tomás de Castilla.\n\nThe CA-9 serves as a connector for the productive nodes of Guatemala with its ports; with the Pacific Corridor and for products coming from El Salvador or destined for the ports of Honduras.\n\nConceptually the Logistics Corridors (Corredores Logísticos Consolidados) are not only road axes; they are axes that integrate the main logistics nodes of the country providing cargo services and ensuring the traceability of merchandise and vehicles in order to support the customs monitoring of merchandise in transit (fiscal corridors),the logistics organization, the security of the goods, among others.\n\nAccording to the PENLOG 2015-2025, in terms of road design, these corridors must have road standards adapted to cargo movements (specifications adapted to the weight and dimensions of large vehicles, area rest and parking, truck centers, weigh stations, speed control), with a level of endowment and sophistication appropriate to the volumes, loads, users, etc.\n\nFor more information on government contact details, please see the following link: 4.1 Government Contact List.\n\nDistance Matrix\n\nOfficial government maps web page : https://caminos.gob.gt/mapas-de-la-red-vial.html\n\nDistances from Capital City to Major Towns (km) *\n\nCapital\n\nCobán, A.V.\n\nChimal-tenango\n\nPuerto Barrios\n\nPto Sn Jose\n\nQuetzal-tenango\n\nRetal-huleu\n\nZacapa\n\nCapital\n\n213\n\n50.1\n\n293\n\n109\n\n198\n\n191\n\n149\n\nCobán, A.V.\n\n213\n\n265\n\n336\n\n323\n\n223\n\n405\n\n192\n\nChimal-tenango\n\n50.1\n\n265\n\n343\n\n99.9\n\n148\n\n182\n\n199\n\nPuerto Barrios\n\n293\n\n336\n\n343\n\n403\n\n492\n\n485\n\n169\n\nPto Sn Jose\n\n109\n\n323\n\n99.9\n\n403\n\n195\n\n167\n\n258\n\nQuetzal-tenango\n\n198\n\n223\n\n148\n\n492\n\n195\n\n51.8\n\n347\n\nRetal-huleu\n\n191\n\n405\n\n182\n\n485\n\n167\n\n51.8\n\n341\n\nZacapa\n\n149\n\n192\n\n199\n\n169\n\n258\n\n347\n\n341\n\n(*) https://caminos.gob.gt/kilometrajes.html\n\nTravel Time from Capital City to Major Towns (hours) *\n\nCapital\n\nCobán, A.V.\n\nChimal-tenango\n\nPuerto Barrios\n\nPtoSn Jose\n\nQuetzal-tenango\n\nRetal-huleu\n\nZacapa\n\nCapital\n\n4:12\n\n1:19\n\n5:03\n\n1:58\n\n3:45\n\n3:39\n\n2:58\n\nCobán, A.V.\n\n4:12\n\n5:38\n\n5:29\n\n6:07\n\n6:36\n\n8:01\n\n3:22\n\nChimal-tenango\n\n1:19\n\n5:38\n\n6:20\n\n1:46\n\n2:23\n\n3:28\n\n4:06\n\nPuerto Barrios\n\n5:03\n\n5:29\n\n6:20\n\n7:19\n\n9:06\n\n9:02\n\n2:41\n\nPto Sn Jose\n\n1:58\n\n6:07\n\n1:46\n\n7:19\n\n3.49\n\n2:53\n\n5:14\n\nQuetzal-tenango\n\n3:45\n\n6:36\n\n2:23\n\n9:06\n\n3:49\n\n1:24\n\n6:46\n\nRetal-huleu\n\n3:3\n\n8:01\n\n3:28\n\n9:02\n\n2:53\n\n1:24\n\n6:53\n\nZacapa\n\n2:58\n\n3:22\n\n4:06\n\n2:41\n\n5:14\n\n6:46\n\n6:53\n\n*Data extracted from Google Maps on November 28, 2016 at 12:00 hours.\n\nRoad Security\n\nDriving in Guatemala requires one's full attention, and safe drivers must drive defensively to avoid dangerous situations. Traffic rules are not always observed; many drivers do not use their turn signals to alert other drivers, speed limits, lane markings and stop signs are often ignored. Passing blindly on winding and/or steep mountain roads, poorly designed surfaces, and unmarked hazards, including frequent landslides and precarious temporary highway repairs, present additional risks to motorists.\n\nSecondary and tertiary roads built on steep mountains (sometimes without adequate technical support) are totally insecure and prone to landslides, because its talus has not been protected or there is lack of drainages.\n\nPublic transportation is unreliable and often unsafe. The “Transmetro” is the most secure public transport in the city. It has adequate terminals and security.\n\nModern inter-city buses with modern terminals offer some security from highway violence, but armed attacks are increasing, showing that all buses are vulnerable. Although city streets are adequately illuminated, secondary and rural roads have little or no illumination. Driving outside of urban areas at night is dangerous and not recommended. The Inter-American Highway (CA-1) and the road from Guatemala City to the Caribbean coast (CA-9) are especially dangerous due to heavy traffic, including large trucks and trailers.\n\nSecurity is a sensible issue and UNDSS should be consulted for the latest security updates.\n\nThere are no roadside assistance clubs, however a roadside assistance force (PROVIAL) https://provial.gob.gt/ patrols most of the major highways in the country. PROVIAL vehicles are equipped with basic tools and first aid supplies, and their services are free. Police patrol the major roadways and may assist travellers, but the patrols are sporadic and may be suspended due to budget restraints. For roadside assistance, travellers may call the police by dialling 120 or the fire department by dialling directly to 122 (Volunteers) or 123 (Municipal) and they will react as soon as possible. Cellular telephone service covers most areas frequented by tourists.\n\nWeighbridges and Axle Load Limits\n\nOfficial government weighbridges inventory map https://caminos.gob.gt/ubicacion-puentes.html\n\nThe road network has an estimated 200 weighbridges around the country, some are made of concrete and some others made of steel. Some bridges have been re-build and some others are in repair due to the natural vulnerability of the country.\n\nGuatemala is party to the United Nations convention on the road traffic (Geneva, 1949) and the Central American Agreement on Road Traffic (1958).\n\nThe axle load limits in Guatemala are listed in below table. The vehicle nomenclature is as follows:\n\nC = Truck / Number of axles // T = Trailer Tractor // S = Semi Trailer // R = Trailer (Example: vehicle type: T3S2R4)\n\nAxle Load Limits\n\nGUATEMALA\n\nTruck with 2 Axles\n\n15,500 Kg\n\nTruck with 3 Axles\n\n22,000 Kg\n\nTruck with 4 Axles\n\n25,000 Kg\n\nSemi-trailer with 3 Axles\n\n23,000 Kg\n\nSemi-trailer with 4 Axles\n\n30,000 Kg\n\nSemi-trailer with 5 Axles\n\n37,000 Kg\n\nSemi-trailer with 6 Axles\n\n41,000 Kg\n\nTruck & Drawbar Trailer with 4 Axles\n\nInformation not available\n\nTruck & Drawbar Trailer with 5 Axles\n\n32,000 to 38,000 Kg\n\nTruck & Drawbar Trailer with 6 Axles\n\n40,000 to 45,000 Kg\n\nTruck & Drawbar Trailer with 7 Axles\n\n47,000 to 52,000 Kg\n\nRoad Class and Surface Conditions\n\nFor official detailed department map please see: https://caminos.gob.gt/mapas-de-la-red-vial.html\n\nDespite the existence of a railway network, no passenger or freight train currently runs in Guatemala. The body in charge of the railway management (Concession Ferrovías Guatemala - FVG) suspended traffic operations in 2007 after months of dispute with the government of Guatemala and subsequent decline of shipments and increase of operational difficulties. As of 2011, most of the bridges have been dismantled and sold for scrap by thieves, making a potential revival of railways in Guatemala, difficult, as it would cost millions of dollars to rebuild. Ferrovias was re-nationalized in December, 2012.\n\nA contract in between Ferrovías de Guatemala S.A. https://ferrovias.com.gt/# and the Mexican company Remed, S.A. https://www.stellaholdings.com.mx/remed was approved by the Extraordinary Assembly of Ferrovías Shareholders on January 12 of 2021 and signed two days later. With this, the right to rehabilitate, use and operate a first stage, Pacific Division, consisting of 235 kilometres of railway, in standard gauge (it consists in the rehabilitation and construction of the railway line in standard gauge: 1,435 mm**) to provide cargo, passenger and tourism transport services from the Tecún Umán, San Marcos border with Puerto Quetzal , Escuintla. To this is added a 30-kilometre section from Retalhuleu to Puerto Champerico, in accordance with the bidding rules FV-LS-02-2021.\n\nThe State of Guatemala owns more than 80% of the shares of Ferrovías, S.A. Remed is committed to invest US$700 million for the development and execution of the project, for a period of 26 years.\n\nOpportunity\n\nThrough this project, the aim is to develop corridors that will enhance the economic zones, facilitating the transfer of goods between populated centers to the borders and ports of the country and the growth of trade in Central America.\n\nThe commercial purpose of the railway operation is focused on cargo, passenger and tourism transport, land terminal services for consolidation/deconsolidation of merchandise, storage, national and international cargo transit, transport agent service for the processing of objective cargo documentation of national and international trade. It will have a connection to Mexico. Operational tests were carried out on August 2022 between Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas, Mexico, and the facilities of the Tecún Umán Railway Station, in the municipality of Ayutla, department of San Marcos. The passage of a freight train with 4 wagons was tested. Although infrastructure such as procedures and permits for the creation of a customs office that allows commercial exchange remains pending.\n\nConstraints\n\nOne of the social constraints is that for the operation, thousands of families living along various sections of the railway will have to be evicted and Fegua* https://fegua.gob.gt/ will have to bear the costs of these transfers.\n\nAt the national congress level some representatives have recently stated: The \"Bicentennial Train\" project must be analysed from political, legal and economic perspectives. The objection is that the project should have been called as an international tender and after being awarded, contracted as a public service concession and not as a lease. Legislators affirm that it is a business managed with discretion to favor a Mexican company.\n\nThere is uncertainty among some congressmen regarding the royalties to be obtained, real estate that has registration problems and legal barriers, as well as the technical, operational and financial capacity of the Mexican contracted company.\n\nThe track that Fegua has along its route is a narrow track 91.4 centimeters (36 inches)\n\n(*) Fegua and Ferrovías de Guatemala have a 50-year usufruct contract that expires in 2047, known as Contract 402. The Remed S.A. contract will have a duration of 26 years, which is the precise time to complete contract 402 -the original contract between Ferrovías and Ferrocarriles de Guatemala (Fegua) for 50 years- but it is established that Ferrovías can request an extension to Fegua. Fegua’s main objective is to restore, revitalize and revalue the railway heritage, and implement and execute a maintenance plan for the railway.\n\n(**)A standard-gauge railway is a railway with a track gauge of 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in). It is the most widely used track gauge around the world, with approximately 55% of the lines in the world using. The distance between the inside edges of the rails is defined to be 1435 mm except in the United States and on some heritage British lines, where it is defined in U.S. customary/Imperial units as exactly \"four feet eight and one half inches\" which is equivalent to 1435.1 mm.\n\nFor more information on government contact details, please see the following link: 4.1 Government Contact List.\n\nDisasters, Conflicts and Migration\n\nPer the 2020 World Risk Report, Guatemala ranks 10th in the world in terms of exposure to disasters and 28th in vulnerability according to INFORM's 2021 Risk Index, https://www.informs.org/. The last 20 years, Guatemala ranks 16th on the 2021 Global Climate Risk Index.\n\nGuatemala has the fourth highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world and the highest in Latin America and Caribbean, with Indigenous and rural populations disproportionately affected. Chronic childhood malnutrition (and stunting) affects 47 percent of all children under the age of five, 58 percent of indigenous children, and 66 percent of children in the lowest income quintile.\n\nType\n\nOccurs\n\nComments / Details\n\nDrought\n\nYes\n\nIn the called “dry corridor” (Alta Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Quiché, El Progreso, Chiquimula, Jalapa, Zacapa, Jutiapa, Totonicapán). Drought is recurring, especially in northern departments of Zacapa, Jutiapa and Jalapa, where water resources are scarce and soil quality is poor. In July 2014 a long “Canícula” ( almost 30 days) caused strong reduction of maize and beans production , affecting 300,000 poor families from 16 departments of them, located along the Dry Corridor (Jutiapa, Chiquimula, Santa Rosa, Quiche, El Progreso, Huehuetenango ,Baja Verapaz and Zacapa. In 2012 a severe drought struck El Progreso, Zacapa, Guatemala, Sololá, Huehuetenango, Quiche, Baja Verapaz, Totonicapán, Jalapa, Santa Rosa, Chimaltenango, Alta Verapaz and Escuintla affecting 53,200 families ( WFP-EFSA 2012). Severe drought’s history includes: 2012 (266,485 affected people) , 2009 (2,500,000 affected people), 2005 (2,500,000 people affected); 2001, (113,596 affected) and 1987 (73,000 affected)\n\nEarthquakes\n\nYes\n\nOn July 2014 an earthquake of 5.3 on the Richter scale affected the Western part of the country. During November 2012, an earthquake of 7.2 on the Richter scale struck 5 departments (San Marcos, Quetzaltenango, Sololá, Totonicapán). 9,225 houses, corresponding to approx. 46,125 persons were severely damaged. Last major earthquake were in 1991 (23,890 affected), in 1976 (23,000 deaths / 4,993,000 people were affected). Other large earthquakes happened in 1917 (2,650 deaths) and 1902 (2,000 deaths).\n\nEpidemics\n\nYes\n\nSeasonal epidemic of dengue, malaria and H1N1.\n\nCovid cases 1.11 M (+127) Deaths 19,567 (+15) Note: As of early 2022, just 29 percent of Guatemalan population was fully vaccinated. The slow progress of vaccination efforts increases the country’s susceptibility to further COVID-19 outbreaks as of data on September 2022\n\nExtreme Temperatures\n\nYes\n\nFrost (heladas) in the highland of the Sierra Madre and Sierra de los Cuchumatanes.\n\nFlooding\n\nYes\n\nIn November 2020 hurricanes Eta and Iota caused floods and destruction across Guatemala and other countries in Central America, affecting 3.5 million children, in the middle of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nYearly events - Hurricane prone country both on Atlantic and Pacific side. Large flood’s history includes; 2011 (528,753 affected people) 2010 (6,075 affected people, 2009 (10,800 people affected), 2008 (180,000 affected people); 2005 (1,513 deaths), 2002, (23,890 affected), 1949 (40,000 deaths); 1982 (348 deaths).\n\nInsect Infestation\n\nNo\n\nMudslides\n\nYes\n\nIn 2020, Guatemala witnessed a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season, with extreme rainfall, catastrophic winds and deadly landslides devastating the country.\n\nAlong with floods, mudslides and cave-in are recurrent events during the rainy season (ex. Zacapa / Huehuetenango, 12 deaths in June 2008, / Alta Verapaz, 38 deaths in Jan. 2009, Chimaltenango 60 death in May 2010). During the 2010 rainy season at least 50,696 people were affected at different levels. It is estimated that since 1900, a total of 300 people died due to the slides (land/mudslides/rock-falls) and 6,270 persons were affected.\n\nHigh Waves / Surges\n\nNo\n\nWildfires\n\nYes\n\nFrequent from January to May. Most fires are linked to bad agricultural practices usually called “quemas”.\n\nHigh Winds\n\nYes\n\nIn the North of the country (Peten).\n\nIn 2020, Guatemala witnessed a record-breaking Atlantic hurricane season, with extreme rainfall, catastrophic winds and deadly landslides devastating the country.\n\nBetween 3 and 17 November 2020, tropical storms Eta and Iota pummelled most of the Guatemalan territory with heavy rains that caused flooding and dozens of catastrophic landslides and mudflows. According to the National Disaster Reduction Coordination (CONRED), 16 of the country's 22 departments were affected by both storms, mostly Alta Verapaz, Izabal, Quiché, Huehuetenango, Petén, Zacapa and Chiquimula. These departments are home to some five million people.\n\nOther Comments\n\nGuatemala's vulnerability to natural- and climate-related disasters coupled with high poverty and gaps in the access to basic services poses a host of challenges that COVID-19 and hurricanes Eta and Iota have worsened since 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic ended three decades of economic growth in Guatemala. Still, the country experienced one of the smallest GDP contractions in 2020 in LAC (-1.5 percent compared to a regional average of -6.7 percent). The Government’s fiscal stimulus to respond to the pandemic (equivalent to 3.3 percent of GDP) was swift in 2020 and focused on protecting the poor and vulnerable.\n\nMan-Made Issues\n\nCivil Strife\n\nYes\n\nThe Guatemalan Civil War, the longest civil war in Continental American history, ran from 1960 to 1996. It had a profound impact on Guatemala. 40,000 to 50,000 people disappeared during the war, approximately 200,000 were killed and 1 million displaced.\n\nCivil strife is a potential threat increased by a widening gap between the rich and poor. Over the previous years there have been strikes, particularly in the agricultural and health sector which often led to tensions with government authorities.\n\nInternational Conflict\n\nNo\n\nInternally Displaced Persons\n\nNo\n\nTotal number of IDPs as of 31 December 2021 243,000 This figure refers to people internally displaced by the 36-year-long civil war in Guatemala, which ended in 1996, as well as to IDPs displaced in 2021. The first caseload is based on data from a 2000 report by the Central American Development Foundation (FUNCEDE), Fundación Arias para la Paz y el Progreso Humano, and UN HABITAT. The report disaggregates the 1997 figures from the UN Population Fund on the number of people displaced when the conflict in Guatemala finished. This figure is based on the assessments conducted after the signing of the Accord for a Firm and Lasting Peace in 1996. The second caseload is based on data from the NGO Cristosal, on the number of IDPs of 2021 who received the organisation's assistance. However This figure is considered an underestimate, given the lack of systematic monitoring of violence displacements in the country, as well as the sensitivity of displacement associated with violence, which may discourage those displaced by violence to disclose their situation. In addition it has not been updated since 1997. It is unclear whether these IDPs are still displaced today 16,000. This figure refers mostly to internal displacements triggered by floods, but also to displacements due to storms, landslides, earthquakes and extreme temperatures. It is based on data provided by the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction (CONRED), on the number of people evacuated or the number of homes severely damaged due to disasters.\n\nRefugees Present\n\nNO\n\nGuatemala is characterized as a country of transit, asylum, return and origin of refugees, in a complex context of mixed migratory flows, in which displacement takes multiple forms, including human trafficking and smuggling. Since 2014, in order to make visible the dramatic protection crisis in the North of Central America, The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR has progressively increased its presence in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, acquiring a greater and deeper understanding of the complex particular context of Guatemala.\n\nLandmines / UXO Present\n\nNO\n\nEstimates vary as to the extent of both the antipersonnel landmines and unexploded ordnance that still threaten Guatemala. Before the war ended in 1996, the Guatemalan military claimed that the URNG guerrillas had deployed 35,000 landmines.\n\nDemining operations began in 1998, as a result of a collaborative effort between the Guatemalan government and the OAS, with the participation of the country’s army, volunteer firefighters corps and former members of the National Revolutionary Army of Guatemala (URNG). During its seven years of operation, the program benefited 1,800 communities and educated half a million people about the lethal effects of these weapons, which were scattered throughout the country.\n\nThe Guatemalan National Commission for Peace and Demining has overall responsibility for the national project. Operations in Guatemala are somewhat unusual within the Organization of American States OAS program, as the primary threat comes from the approximately 8,000 unexploded devices, including mortar and artillery shells, aerial bombs and hand grenades, which are scattered throughout Guatemalan territory.\n\nOn December 15 of 2005 the Organization of American States (OAS) and the government of Guatemala marked the end of the program. The program located and destroyed 4,127 unexploded artifacts.\n\nOther Comments\n\nGuatemala has yet to make any comprehensive effort to treat war wounded. Though the number of casualties from landmines and other war-related artefacts are far lower in Guatemala than, for example, in neighbouring El Salvador, the total number of wounded from Guatemala’s civil war remains unknown. It appears that little or no treatment is currently available in Guatemala for prosthetics fitting, rehabilitation and workplace reincorporation. Partly because the overall need for such programs is considered to be far less in Guatemala than in other Central American nations, the Pan-American Health Organization is not undertaking such efforts in Guatemala.\n\nFor a more detailed database on disasters by country, please see the Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters Country Profile.\n\nSeasonal Effects on Logistics Capacities\n\nDuring the months November until May, is when Guatemala increases the export activity (coffee and perishables) therefore transport becomes more difficult to find and prices might go higher. During this period, there will be a pick during in March and April (close to the Holly Week), when transport is hard to find. Shipping lines should be contacted in advance (10-15 days).\n\nDuring the rainy season, commodities transportation, mainly grains and flour in trucks can be delays due to rainfall. Nevertheless, during emergencies commodities should be transported through covered truck, to avoid damages of cargo.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nCONRED (Coordinadora Nacional Para la Reduccion de Desastres) is the government Civil Protection Organization and is the key coordination institution for government emergency preparedness and response activities. CONRED is member of CEPREDENAC (Centro de Coordinación para la Prevención de Desastres Naturales en America Central), the regional inter-governmental organization for civil protection.\n\nA National Response Plan, available on the CONRED website[1], establishes the role and responsibilities of government and non-governmental entities in the emergency response. The plan is, based on a three level response concept: national, municipality and regional locations, detailing 19 support functions. Some of these are: search and rescue, firefighting, water and sanitation, shelter management, temporary morgues management, psycho-social support, transport, communication, energy, etc. The plan also includes all support functions, responsible organizations, objectives and responsibilities.\n\nThe National Institute for Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology (INSIVUMEH) monitors the country seismic activities and hydrometeorology situation through monitoring stations placed in the country. The Ministry of Agriculture/ Vice Ministry of Food Security and Nutrition (MAGA / VISAN) provides information through its network of Departmental coordinators who maintain a registry of harvest losses, and monitors the food availability. The Secretary of Food Security and Nutrition (SESAN) provides information through the information systems for monitoring and evaluation of the food security and nutrition situation. The Ministry of Health’s epidemiological vigilance unit monitors the country’s hygiene and health situation.\n\nBased on the monitoring reports and depending on the intensity of the disaster, CONRED, in consultation with other government actors declares the level of institutional and public alert and, when applicable, submits for approval the State of Calamity Decree to the President of the Republic which triggers the response according to the National Plan.\n\nUpon the activation of a Red level emergency, the Emergency Operation Centre (COE) is activated in CONRED. The COE is the coordination center where all relevant government institutions are represented.\n\nCONRED is based the Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City premises. It has three 600 m² warehouses and a 30 m² cold room used to store emergency aid during emergencies. CONRED handling equipment includes eight 2.5 MT Forklifts, approx. 25 hand pallet trucks, and eight 20 MT capacity trucks. It fuel reserves consist of two gasoline tanks (22,500 L), three diesel tanks (22,500 L) and one fresh water tank (40,000 L) to cover a 30 day supply for the base. The emergency store includes equipment such as Search and Rescue equipment, blankets, tents, mattress and 20,000 ready to eat rations. Also there are standing agreements with private companies for the supply of additional food parcels in case of emergencies.\n\nAt field level, CONRED has 42 “reaction centers” with first response equipment ready to be used. Equipment includes: blankets, family tents and food.\n\nUpon emergency and activation of the National Plan, all actors involved support the operation through the operational center (COE) and will augment CONRED’s response capacity. As an example, CONRED will benefits from the support from the Ministry of Communication for communication equipment and earth removal equipment such as tractors, excavator and staff for road security. For air transport support, CONRED will receive in the first days the support of the SAR (former Circulo Aereo) which is part of the Aeroclub of Guatemala Civil Aviation which has 20 helicopters and more than 150 small aircrafts which can be useful to mobilize rescue teams or medicines. The military air force has limited number of air response to specific requirements for helicopters and aircrafts, but they are able to coordinate alone with CONRED to get more units from other institutions.\n\nCurrently the military is supporting the food distribution drought affected population; in this case everything is organized by governors and vice presidency. In other situations, governors, majors can approach the military commander of the specific area for transport requirements (truck, security, fuel and Daily Support Allowance). The number of trucks depends on the availability and special requirements. US Air force, based in Honduras, through the Fuerza Bravo has been mobilized in various instances and provided helicopters support in times of emergencies.\n\nIn the recent years, the Office of the First Lady has been taking an increasing role in the emergency response by defining priorities, attributing the responsibilities to government institutions, hence, becoming an important factor in the response.\n\nFor more information on government contact details, please see the following link: 4.1 Government Contact List.\n\nHUMANITARIAN COMMUNITY\n\nGuatemala due to its geographical, geological and tectonic position is classified as one of the countries worldwide with a high potential for multiple natural hazards being these hydro-meteorological, geological, vulcanological, earthquake, drought, forest fires, among others, and their social situation (inequality), economic (extreme poverty), environmental degradation by over-exploitation and under development, generates high vulnerability conditions, on a large percentage of the population. Infrastructure and services are exposed to different risks, which may be triggered disasters, which are becoming increasingly recurrent.\n\nIn Guatemala, initially when a big disaster hit the Country, is the government that makes the first actions, declaring different types of alerts and mobilizing financial, human and institutional resources through Civil Protection CONRED (National Commission for Disaster Reduction) and civil authorities (governors), Line Ministries and Army.\n\nHowever, if the government believes that even mobilizing all its resources, is unable to meet the growing need for supporting affected population, then a public calamity declaration is prepared and issued by the highest authority of the Executive and ratified by the Congress. An international flash appeal (through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) is given to the humanitarian organizations such as : USAID; WFP, UNICEF, PAHO, FAO and NGOs and different mechanisms such as the Country Team United Nations, the UNETTE and different Clusters “Logistics, Nutrition, Food Aid, Communication and others \" are activated. Leadership by “expertise\" is applied by the international humanitarian community, which works closely with NGOs, civil protection institutions, and local authorities.\n\nThe support of the international community begins immediately and lately is directed to early recovery and / or reconstruction. This creates the need for a mechanism to channel humanitarian aid activities.\n\nInternationally there is a legal framework that governs the relationship between countries in terms of aid and humanitarian assistance highlighting the Geneva Convention-Common, Resolution 2816 of the UN Assembly Attendance in cases of natural disasters and other disaster situations - Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Paris Declaration, the International law of Human Rights and Customary law.\n\nFor more information on humanitarian agency contact details, please see the following link: 4.2 Humanitarian Agency Contact List\n\nFuel Overview\n\nGuatemala is a net importer of oil-derived fuels, most of which come from the United States. Among the ten main imported products to Guatemala, Gasoline occupies position number 4. At national level, the main fuel consumed is diesel, and it has a high impact on the cost of transporting goods and passengers.\n\nThe import of fuel is mainly done through two corridors: From the Atlantic side, through Puerto Barrios and Santo Tomas de Castilla. In Puerto Barrios, the import is done by Chevron, and in Santo Tomas, Unopetrol and Puma Energy. The imports consist of gasoline, diesel, kerosene, bunker and aircraft fuel. On the pacific side, though San Jose port and Puerto Quetzal, the import is done by Unopetrol, Chevron, Puma Energy, Blue Oil and Pacific Oil. Those companies import mainly gasoline, diesel, kerosene dual use and bunker.\n\nFuel Supply & Storage\n\nMaximum hydrocarbons storage capacity (source: M.E.M.)\n\nLocation\n\nTotal Barrels\n\nTotal Gallons\n\nOil terminals on the Pacific coast\n\n4,197,650\n\n176,301,313\n\nOil terminals on the Atlantic coast\n\n193,744\n\n58,579,256\n\nGLP (in country)\n\n16,332\n\n685,957\n\nInternational Airport\n\n9,857\n\n414,000\n\nOther\n\n114,630\n\n4,814,460\n\nPetrol\n\n666,500\n\n27,993,000\n\nGuatemala Infrastructure of Service Stations\n\nThe registry of companies of the General Directorate of Hydrocarbons indicates that there are 1,534 operating licenses for service stations in force in the country. The largest concentration of service stations is in the department of Guatemala, where the largest percentage of the vehicle fleet in the country, followed by the departments of Quetzaltenango, Petén and San Marcos.\n\nGuatemala Fuel Monthly Consumption 2022, volume expressed in barrels (55 US gl = 250 lt)\n\nAccording to figures from the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), between January and May 2021, the national consumption of gasoline and diesel was 13 million 170 thousand 761.54 barrels (of 42 gallons), while in the first five months of In 2022, consumption was 12 million 847 thousand 507.09 barrels, a drop of 2.45%.\n\nThe prices of liquefied petroleum gas in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama include subsidies; even so, Guatemala maintains the highest pricing, according to the Fuel Price Report of the Ministry of Energy and Mines.\n\nUse of Gas LPG\n\nIn 2020, the final energy consumption in Guatemala determined that Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) represents 3.6% of the energy matrix. That is, 3,410.52 kBEP (kilo barrel of oil equivalent).\n\nIn domestic use, it is the second main source of energy for cooking. A total of 1,432,144 homes (43.7%) use propane gas, although the main source of energy for most of the homes in the country continues to be firewood, which is used by 1,782,861 homes (54.4%).\n\nLPG is used in households with a wide range of incomes, including those below the poverty line. Households are quite resilient to price volatility in both directions (increase/decrease). The desire for the cylinder to last as long as possible contributes to continued reliance on firewood, especially when a large quantity of food must be cooked. Moreover, firewood continues to pay a role as an emergency source of energy when LPG is unavailable for technical or economic reasons. In other words, firewood contributes to a sense of energy security of the household.\n\nUse of Ethanol\n\nThe actual Guatemalan government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mines would be promoting the use of ethanol to alleviate, in the long term, the effects of the fuel market. They are currently hosting a series of workshops with the ethanol-producing industry in Guatemala, with vehicle and fuel importers. There are 3 sugar mills and 5 ethanol distillers whose production is exported and consumed in California (USA).\n\nFor more information on government and fuel provider contact details, please see the following links: 4.1 Government Contact List and 4.7 Fuel Providers Contact List.\n\nInformation may also be foundat: http://www.mytravelcost.com/petrol-prices/ which is updated monthly.\n\nFuel Pricing\n\nUntil the end of May 2022, Guatemala is the nation that recorded the highest fuel prices in Central America. For example, if one considers that there was already an upward trend before the European conflict, from January 2021 to May 2022, the price of superior gasoline in Guatemala rose more than 180%, going from 3.09 dollars per US gallon (24.34 quetzals) in January 2021, at 5.59 dollars per US gallon (44 quetzales as of May 2022).\n\nExchange rate: 1 GTQ = 0.13 USD / 1 USD = 7.85 GTQ , effective October 2022\n\n01 US liquid gallon = 3.79 Litres / 1 litre = 0.26 US liquid gallon\n\nDespite the fact that Guatemala approved in mid-May a subsidy of five quetzals (0.64 usd) for a gallon of superior and regular gasoline, and seven quetzals (0.89 usd) for diesel, it continues to have high prices.\n\n(*)Kerosene is a specific type of paraffin. Paraffin tends to be a more refined and distilled version of kerosene. This makes it more suitable for use within the home. Paraffin is more refined, which ensures that it will produce a lot less soot when it's burnt. Kerosene is often referred to as kerosene so, while there is an overlap between the terms paraffin and kerosene, paraffin has a broader meaning and a wider range of applications.\n\nSeasonal Variations\n\nSeasonal Variations\n\nAre there national priorities in the availability of fuel? (i.e. are there restrictions or priorities for the provision of fuel such as to the military?)\n\nNo\n\nIs there a rationing system?\n\nNo\n\nIs fuel to lower income / vulnerable groups subsidized?\n\nNo\n\nCan the local industry expand fuel supply to meet humanitarian needs?\n\nYes\n\nIs it possible for a humanitarian organization to directly contract a reputable supplier / distributor to provide its fuel needs?\n\nYes\n\nFuel Transportation\n\nThe Internal transport is done though tanker truck. The transport of petroleum products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, AV-Jet, AV-gas, bunker C, oily mixtures y liquefied gas), at national level is done through road tanker and, for liquefied gas, with gas tanker. https://www.mem.gob.gt/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4._RTCA_Transporte_de_liquidos.pdf.

A Guatemala rank 125th out of 160 in the logistics performance index and that is a clear challenge for the sector.\n\nFor example, the issue of transporters-highways is too sensitive. According to data from the National Traffic Safety Observatory of the National Civil Police, 39 percent of accidents occur on the highway, and half of all these events occur on the western route, which proves that western routes they are dangerous, in addition, a real registry of the buses and heavy transport that circulates in the portfolios of Guatemala must be carried out, because there is an under-registration of buses that circulate without permits.\n\nIn addition to current fuel costs increase, the cost of ground transportation is perceived as high, compared to neighbour countries in Central America. This contributes to road insecurity since the cargo, in particularly the export inland freight (not limited to) must travel in convoy and with armed escort provided by dedicated private security companies and its additional costs. Inefficiency in border management is also key cause of this situation\n\nThe heavy cargo transporters are represented by different unions, depending on the type market. The main unions of cargo carriers are classified into two groups:\n\na) Carriers engaged in the transport of international cargo containers (local transport or International), represented by the Association of International Carriers (ATI), and the Chamber of Central American Carriers (CATRANSCA), affiliated at the Central American level in the Federation Central American Freight Carriers (FECATRANS) and in the Transport Coordinator Central American (CTC), and,\n\nb) Carriers specialized by product, affiliated with specific chambers. (Guild of Specialized Fuel Carriers; Union of Cement Transporters, etc.)\n\nIt should be noted that in addition to these unions, there is a significant number of carriers that are not affiliated with any organization, as well as private carriers operating fleets on their own. (Essentially regional cast, teams special services for fast food transportation, mail, groceries, home delivery of purchases to pantries, utilities, etc.)\n\nCámara Guatemalteca de Transporte de Carga\n\nThe CGT has been recently created on April 28 of this year 2022 with 12 companies that bring together 1,600 tractor units and generate 4,800 direct jobs and around 900 indirect jobs. Data from the Bank of Guatemala indicate that transportation and storage grew 11.2 percent in the first quarter of 2022, influenced by cargo and passenger transportation activities by land. Its main purpose is strengthening its associates through pilot training to promote innovation, dealing with issues related to the movement of goods and safety and quality of its services, channel of communication with the government and ministries, etc. The Chamber does not intend to be a division among other existing organizations. The Chamber was born with 12 associates and 20 more in the process of integration between large and medium-sized companies, although more than 200 firms dedicated to this service operate in the formal economy.\n\nCoordinadora Nacional de Transporte, CNT\n\nThe National Departmental Urban Transport Coordinator of Guatemala \"CNTUDEG\" is a private, non-political, non-religious, non-profit entity, with its own legal registration; Its main purpose is the promotion and comprehensive development of urban and rural carriers in the different departments of the Republic of Guatemala. The Coordinator maintains bilateral communication channels with the Vice Presidency of the Republic, with the Guatemalan Chamber of Commerce and other entities and unions.\n\nSindicato Gremial de Pilotos de Transporte Pesado de Guatemala \"SIGPITRANSPEGUA\"\n\nIs a very powerful union, which gathers and represents the vast majority of truck drivers and truck owner in Guatemala. The “SIGPITRANSPEGUA” better known as “La Gremial de Transporte Pesado” has also no few controversies among its members and the union presidency* when facing the common transport issues e.g. regional transit restrictions. The Guatemala City municipality, approximately 5 years ago, prohibited the transit of heavy transport through the city in between 04:00 to 09:00 hrs. and 16:00 to 21:00 hrs. to alleviate bottlenecks and general city traffic. The Union protested this regulation. On the other side, due to the city expansion the peripheral highway is today in the middle of the city and drastic traffic regulations are needed. Another issue is the new law of vehicle accident insurance against third parties which is perceived by the union members as an extra cost. Same dynamics have been noted regarding the norm for implementing in-cabin speed limit regulators, etc. The union is very well organized in terms of call for road blockade and strikes as act of force, looking to negotiate with the Guatemalan government.\n\n(*) Current President of the Union is Mr. Rony Mendoza, +502 4509 9333 · remendoza81@hotmail.com\n\nThe General Directorate of Transport, Dirección General de Transporte\n\nDGT is the dependency of the Ministry of Communications, Infrastructure and Housing, in charge of the control and regulation of extra-urban passenger transport by road, exclusive special service for tourism, agriculture and industry and the registration of the equipment transport service, road freight, nationwide\n\nThe Chamber of Central American Carriers CATRANSCA\n\nThe Chamber of Central American Carriers, better known by its acronym CATRANSCA, is a private, non-profit entity with its own legal status, which is made up of formal road transport companies. Guatemala is an active member.\n\nOverview\n\nGuatemala has one of the lowest fixed-line teledensities in the region; in many rural regions of the country there is no fixed-line access available, and so mobile services are adopted by necessity; private investment has been supported by government and regulatory efforts, resulting in a steady growth in the number of fixed lines which has supported growth in the fixed broadband segment.\n\nThe total number of inhabitants of Guatemala is 18.42 million, of which 52.7% reside in urbanized areas. Likewise, there are 20.26 million cellular mobile connections, which in comparison with the population represents 110%.\n\nOn the other hand, Internet users are 11.97 million, which represents 65% of the total population of the country, this means that just over half of the population has Internet access.\n\nThere are 9.55 million active users on social networks, thus being 51.9% of the population who are active on these platforms.\n\nTwo new submarine cables are due for completion by 2022; improved international connectivity should drive further uptake of both fixed and mobile broadband services; intense competition among the networks has helped to improve services and lower prices for end-users; given the commercial impetus of networks, insufficient government financial investment has resulted in many regional areas remaining with poor or non-existent services; the country benefits from one of the most open regulatory frameworks, with all telecom sectors having been open to competition since 1996.\n\nThe two leading operators in the mobile telephony market in Guatemala have total hegemony in the sector, being the only ones to have their own infrastructure network to offer coverage throughout the national territory. Regarding the most used operator in Guatemala, Tigo is the leading company in the sector and the one with the largest number of users in the country. Despite this, the difference in market dominance with respect to Claro is not so marked, where in fact, each year the margin of difference becomes smaller.\n\nTelecomunicaciones de Guatemala (TELGUA), belongs to the international operator América Móvil based in Mexico; currently being the largest fixed telecommunications operator in the country with 78.66% corresponding to more than 1,500,000 customers.1\n\nCommunications Cellular, better known under its brand of mobile services TIGO, is the second operator in fixed telephony users, exceeding 325,000 active clients corresponding to 16.80%.1\n\nClaro Guatemala, is a national operator that also belongs to América Móvil and that covers 2.35% of the market with 45,644 clients in 2022. It previously belonged to the international operator Telefónica based in Spain; and managed to be the second largest fixed telecommunications operator in the country with just over 200,000 customers.\n\nCablenet is the fourth largest fixed telephony operator in the country, exceeding 42,000 active clients, equivalent to 2.18% of the market.\n\nFor more information on telecoms contacts, please see the following link: 4.11 Additional Services Contact List.\n\nTelephone Services\n\nIs there an existing landline telephone network?\n\nYes\n\nDoes it allow international calls?\n\nYes\n\nNumber and Length of Downtime Periods (on average)\n\nNot significant\n\nMobile Phone Providers\n\nApproximate Percentage of National Coverage\n\nIn Guatemala there are more than 64,000 public telephones in operation.\n\nGuatemala has fixed telephony services in most of its land area. In this sense, after the opening of the telecommunications market in the country, different private companies arrived in the country and acquired tenders to operate within the country.\n\nThere are currently at least 4 large fixed line operators in Guatemala, with TELGUA (Guatemala Telecommunications, owned by América Móvil) being the leading company in this market. The most important landline telephone companies in the country are: TELGUA, Comunicaciones Celulares (TIGO), Cablenet, Unitel Guatemala\n\nTelecommunications Regulations\n\nhe Superintendence of Telecommunications is an eminently technical body of the Ministry of Communications, Infrastructure and Housing, whose main functions are the following: Manage and supervise the exploitation of the radio spectrum.\n\nGeneral Telecommunications Law\n\nThe Ley General de Telecomunicaciones establishes a new regulatory framework, creates the Telecommunications Superintendence as an eminently technical entity, and creates a fund destined to subsidize, through market mechanisms, telephone services in low-income rural and urban areas.\n\nfile:///C:/Users/Utente/Downloads/LEY%20GENERAL%20DE%20TELECOMUNICACIONES.pdf\n\nGeneral overview of Guatemalan regulations\n\nFor distributor, seller\n\nDistributors and sellers of mobile terminal equipment must keep a control or file of the people to whom they sell or supply a mobile, which they must keep for a period of 3 years. In the case of mobile importers, they must keep a detailed database of each mobile that they will keep for a period of 5 years from importation.\n\nThey must release the mobile to be used in the network of any national telephone operator, at the user's choice. Only Operators that offer contract plans among their services that benefit the user are excepted, which may not be longer than 24 months. At the end of this period, the mobile must be released by the Operator at no additional cost to the user.\n\nFor buyer, user\n\nSIM card vendors must ask the buyer for the respective identification document stating that they are of legal age, which can be DPI or passport if they are foreigners. They must verify that the document corresponds to the person presenting it, and they will receive a physical or electronic copy of it, where they will write down the telephone number that the user is acquiring. They may also fill out a form, which may be electronic, with the aforementioned data, and in any case they must keep the documents and information for three years\n\nTheft, Loss of Cellular devices\n\nComplaints about theft of cellular devices (must be managed by those affected, reporting the theft of your cell phone to the company that provides the service for blocking it. At the same time, make the complaint in the Public Minister Prosecutor Offices.\n\nGeneral Considerations\n\nThey (distributors, seller, buyers and users) may not market, store, transfer, distribute, supply, sell, sell, export, repair, exhibit or carry out any other activity carried out with one or more mobile terminal equipment or any of its components that are included in the Negative Database -BDN- , or that present evidence of having been reprogrammed, altered, replaced or duplicated with the IMEI of the device. Mobile phones with generic or duplicate IMEI cannot be imported or sold.\n\nThey cannot market mobile terminal equipment whose IMEI is altered or included in the Negative Database -BDN-, or they will automatically lose their registration certificate.\n\nNote: HF radio systems will be no longer in use.\n\nExisting Humanitarian Telecoms Systems\n\nUnited Nations System\n\nThe UN system in Guatemala for communications, according to its Emergency Communications Systems established that standard means of communication, under normal condition and emergency situation is:\n\n1) Personal cellular phone, (as part of the personal tool kit)\n\n2) VHF radio\n\n3) Satellite means of communication.\n\nNote: HF radio equipment is being progressively withdrawn from service\n\nSatellite phones, sat modem (Iridium, Began)\n\nRegulations and norms apply for users. Please refer to:\n\nhttps://sit.gob.gt/gerencia-de-frecuencias/sistemas/sistema-satelital/\n\nDue to Guatemala country coordinates and geophysical characteristics Iridium and Began systems operate correctly.\n\nRadio communications Law\n\nThe domain of the State over usable frequencies and channels in the country's radio communications is inalienable and imprescriptible, and it may exploit them by itself or assign the use to individuals in accordance with the prescriptions of this law...\n\nfile:///C:/Users/Utente/Downloads/Ley%20de%20Radiocomunicaciones.pdf\n\nLaw Regulating the Use and Collection of Satellite Signals and their Distribution by Cable\n\nThe purpose of this law is to regulate the use and operation of earth stations that are capable of capturing signals that come from satellites and their distribution through cable, or any other known means, and their use or operation by individuals or legal entities.

The total percentage of Internet users in relation to the total population of the country is 65%. The year-over-year change in the number of internet users has increased by 1.8% compared to previous figures. Thus gaining 217 thousand new users. The total percentage of users of social networks who access them through mobile devices is 99.2%. In the same way, 95.7% of the population have access to electricity, and 94% have access to potable water suitable for drinking, in this way the most of the country has basic water and electricity services. However, only 67.9% of the population enjoys access to basic health services, thus a little more than half of the country has this basic service. Finally, only 24.4% of the population earn less than US$3.20 per day.\n\nInternet sites in Guatemala are cataloged by domains: .com.gt, .net.gt, .org.gt, .edu.gt, .mil.gt, .gob.gt and .ind.gt The country code top level domain (ccTLD) for Guatemala is .gt.\n\nInternet Service Providers\n\nAre there ISPs available?\n\nYes, https://isp.today/es/list-of-all-services/GUATEMALA\n\nIf yes, are they privately or government owned?\n\nPrivate\n\nDial-up only?\n\nn/a\n\nApproximate Rates (local currency and USD - $)\n\nDial-up n/a\n\nBroadband https://isp.today/es/list-of-all-services/GUATEMALA\n\nBroadband\n\nhttps://isp.today/es/list-of-all-services/GUATEMALA\n\nMax Leasable ‘Dedicated’ Bandwidth\n\nn/a\n\nFixed Bandwidth\n\nBroadband internet speed is considerably slower than the rest of the region, generating few incentives to hire it, as well as being more expensive than in many Latin American countries. This generates an access problem in which the offer is insufficient and the demand does not have the incentives to contract the broadband service. This endogenous problem could be exacerbated by the difficulty of installing antennas in the interior of the country. Speed is also one of the lowest in Latin America. Putting together the low speed of internet, as well as the high price for broadband, a problem of low supply and therefore high prices can be observed.\n\nThere are 14,640 base stations installed throughout the Guatemalan territory. According to a 2021 Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, BID report, only 64% of the Guatemalan population has mobile broadband coverage.\n\nMobile Network Operators (MNOs)\n\nSince 2020, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production; progress toward 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure; consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth; the crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident (Covid-19 pandemic), and the spike in this area has seen growth in development of new tools and increased services.\n\nAlthough the level of service is higher and more convenient rates in Claro, Tigo is positioned as the most popular phone company in Guatemala. This is thanks to its significantly higher number of loyal customers, growth rate, engagement rate and interaction per post.\n\nThe two leading operators in the mobile telephony market in Guatemala have total hegemony in the sector, being the only ones to have their own infrastructure network to offer coverage throughout the national territory. Regarding the most used operator in Guatemala, Tigo is the leading company in the sector and the one with the largest number of users in the country. Despite this, the difference in market dominance with respect to Claro is not so marked, where in fact, each year the margin of difference becomes smaller.\n\nCellphone national coverage network\n\nhttps://www.nperf.com/es/map/GT/-/-/signal/?ll=15.79026861482683&lg=-90.23&zoom=7\n\nNote: Select the cell phone operator to visualize country coverage.\n\nNational Coordinator for Disaster Reduction CONRED\n\nRadio base network\n\nThe local markets in Guatemala are plentiful and currently meet the local population demands in regards to food and non-food items. If there was a requirement to scale up due to an emergency response items would be able to be sourced from the Central America region.\n\nMain Food Suppliers\n\nThere is no shortage of food supplies available in Guatemala via local markets as well as supermarkets. Food supplies are either produced locally (fresh vegetables and fruit) or are imported from other provinces within Guatemala.\n\nThe main food suppliers’ long list can be summarized as follows:\n\nMaize is the main source of calories and protein in the Guatemalan diet. White maize is more heavily consumed than yellow maize, but the latter is preferred in some regions and used as poultry feed.\n\nEvery Guatemalan household consumes black beans: as a source of protein which is particularly valuable complement to cereals in regions where households have limited access to animal products.\n\nConsumption habits are strongly linked to tradition and culture. Rice is mainly consumed in urban and peri-urban, but some rural households consume it as well. Guatemala is highly dependent on imported rice. The market in Guatemala City is the largest in the country and feeds the highest concentration of the population.\n\nGuatemala Food Security Outlook\n\nCrisis Results to persist in targeted areas despite seasonal improvements. November 2022\n\nThe stability in the exports of commercial crops and the better sales prices will allow the demand for temporary labour for the harvest to be in normal ranges. However, the purchasing power of households will be pressured by the high prices of food, transportation, and gasoline, particularly diesel, which is no longer subsidized.\n\nIn most of the country, basic grain crops developed adequately and the rains favoured plant growth; since the end of September the fresh grain began to flow in the markets. At the national level, harvests have been reported in ranges close to the average, especially for surplus and commercial farmers.\n\nSource: https://fews.net/central-america-and-caribbean/guatemala/food-security-outlook/october-2022\n\nThe Famine Early Warning Systems Network is a leading provider of early warning and analysis on food insecurity. Created by USAID in 1985 to help decision-makers plan for humanitarian crises, FEWS NET provides evidence-based analysis on approximately 30 countries. Implementing team members include NASA, NOAA, USDA, USGS, and CHC-UCSB, along with Chemonics International Inc. and Kimetrica.\n\nAside from lower production costs, other advantages that domestic companies like these enjoy over their multinational rivals include strong distribution networks (which cover both major cities and provincial areas, as well as modern and more traditional retail channels) and superior knowledge of the traditional tastes and preferences of Guatemalan consumers.\n\nThe entry into the market of recent corn and bean crops, which usually drives the seasonal decline in prices, has been barely perceptible this year as prices have remained well above average. The price reduction between August and September 2021 was 11 percent, while between August and September of this year only a 1 percent decrease is reported. In September, wholesale prices for corn and beans were 62 and 41 percent above the five-year average, respectively. Other causes, in addition to the influence of international factors on prices, pushed prices above normal, such as the high price of fuel, particularly diesel, and the poor state of the roads. After the storm Julia, the damages caused by the heavy rains have increased the cost of freight transportation. The localized losses of basic grains due to rains and speculation have also contributed to this situation.\n\nTropical Storm Julia-22, impact. 2022\n\nThe passage of storm Julia at the beginning of October particularly affected the region of the Northern Transversal Strip and the Polochic area. In these areas, the soils were already saturated, so the rains quickly caused damage and loss of basic grain crops. It was the farmers in these areas who suffered the most, since the maize crops were already drying on the land (in doubles) or already harvested in the drying process in their homes where they do not have appropriate spaces for post-harvest handling. Damages and losses were also reported in land recently planted with beans from the Postrera cycle; as well as the deterioration of highways, roads and bridges that affected the movement of people and merchandise for several days and left some places cut off. On October 11, 2022, the government decreed a State of Calamity to respond to the effects caused by Tropical Storm Julia, but its actions have not yet been carried out until the end of October.\n\nFor official pricing information please see: https://precios.maga.gob.gt/\n\nDisclaimer: Inclusion of company information in the LCA does not imply any business relationship between the supplier and WFP / Logistics Cluster, and is used solely as a determinant of services, and capacities.\n\nPlease note: WFP / Logistics Cluster maintain complete impartiality and are not in a position to endorse, comment on any company's suitability as a reputable service provider.\n\nOverview\n\nOn average, each Guatemalan generates 0.519 kilograms of waste and solid residues daily. Of this amount, 53% corresponds to organic matter, 9% to sanitary waste, 9% to plastic and 6% to paper and cardboard.\n\nThe collection system in Guatemala City is carried out as follows: the municipality of Guatemala collects 13.7%, 71.3% by private companies, and 15% is deposited in illegal dumps or is burned in the open.\n\nOnly in Guatemala City, the residual waters, both domestic and industrial (65% of the companies in the country's industrial sector are located there which generates downloads of wastewater) in several cases do not pass through treatment plants and are discharged into the watercourses of the ravines.
