He is a Fellow of the Institution of Engineers Australia, is a past member of CIGRE Australian Panel AP B2 and a current Member of Standards Australia Committees EL43 (AS2067) and EL52 (AS7000 and HB331).\n\nHe holds an Electrical Engineering Degree, a Physics Degree and a Master of Engineering Science from the University of New South Wales. He was nominated for Professional Engineer of the Year (2012) by UGL and was one of three finalists in the 2015 SafeWork NSW Awards for Best Individual Contribution to Workplace Health and Safety (non WHS representative).\n\nGlyn Jones\n\nGlyn joined the Country Roads Board of Victoria in 1959 as a newly qualified engineer at Warrnambool. For the next 30 years Glyn wore many hats in Victoria working for Vic Roads, including Regional Bridge Engineer. This involved bridge inspection, managing the maintenance and construction works, developing proposals for new structures, assisting municipalities with their structural problems and managing a precast concrete yard.\n\nGlyn was one of the first to be called in any bridging emergency and this was highlighted in the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983 when his area in South West Victoria lost about 10 major structures. In 1989 Glyn was seconded to an Australian Aid project in Indonesia for 3½ years. There, he wrote the manuals for both bridge inspection and bridge maintenance. Once these were written, Glyn travelled into the provinces teaching and implementing the manual material.\n\nGlyn worked for 8 years as the Regional Bridge Engineer with the RTA in Western NSW. This was the home of many old large timber truss and girder structures. Many of the old traditional crafts were retained thereby employees who were highly skilled. A video was made for posterity on these skills and won a prestigious award at the National Heritage Day in Sydney in 2002.\n\nIn 2014 Glyn had an active part to play in the auditing for Queensland Rail in their far west areas in regards to their inspection, maintenance and manpower needs.\n\nIn 2015, Glyn assisted the WA Main Roads to assess their Emergency Bridging capabilities. He guided them through their refurbishing their Bailey Bridge components, designed the storage facilities for the Bailey and conducted training for the Bridge Crews.\n\nFor the last 16 years, Glyn has run his own consulting company and has specialised in bridge inspection, surveillance, determining maintenance treatments with estimates and mentoring young engineers. In this period Glyn has written a few manuals for Vic-Roads and the RTA.\n\nEric Maynard\n\nEric joined Jenike & Johanson in 1996 and is now a Vice President and Director of Education. He has published over 50 articles on the storage, flow, and pneumatic transport of bulk solids. He is the principal instructor for the “Flow of solids in bins, hoppers, chutes, and feeders” and “Pneumatic conveying of bulk solids” courses.\n\nEric has presented bulk material and pneumatic conveying technology at over 300 training events world-wide. He has designed more than 750 bulk material handling and conveying systems for various powders and bulk solids, with a special focus on the cement, power, and mining industries. Eric is responsible for internal training of engineers at Jenike & Johanson. Eric has particular interest in crushing technologies for minerals, as well as in the safety aspects of dust explosions and powder electrostatics. He has received certified training on dust hazards analysis (DHA; per NFPA 652 chapter 7 requirements) and can perform inspections on the unique hazards with combustible dusts such as foods, plastics, metal powders, and agricultural materials/wood. He is a member of ASME, AIChE, and the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). Eric received his Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Villanova University and a Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute\n\nCorin Holmes\n\nCorin is the Operations Manager for Jenike & Johanson Pty Ltd in Perth, Australia, and is passionate about applying the science of bulk solids handling to help people and organisations succeed, especially those in the resources sector. He received his Master’s degree from The University of Greenwich and is a member of AusIMM.\n\nThe flow behaviour of bulk solids is deceptively complex and often treated with contempt during the design stage hence there are plenty of “opportunities for improvement”, in almost every industry. As a bulk solids handling engineer with 15 years’ experience, he has designed many bulk material handling and systems with a special focus in the mining industry. As such, he gets plenty of opportunity to indulge his passion, which he enjoys sharing with others! This deep practical experience combined with his accomplished and entertaining presentation style ensures that you won’t be disappointed!"
