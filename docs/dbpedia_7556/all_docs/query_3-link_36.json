Injuries received during the fighting for Moscow eventually forced his return to Warsaw, where he worked on the reconstruction of the Polish forces intended to fight in Germany. Covering the retreat of the French army after Napoleon lost the \"Battle of the Nations\" at Leipzig (1813), Poniatowski was repeatedly wounded and drowned in the Elster river.\n\nHorse needs to be ordered separately.
