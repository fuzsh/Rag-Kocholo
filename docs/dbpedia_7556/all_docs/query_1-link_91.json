        "text": "On 19-20 October, Dr. Jan StanisÅaw Ciechanowski, the Head of the Office dor War Veterans and Victims of Oppression, participated in ceremonies commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Battle of the Nations in Leipzig. Commemorative ceremonies, organised by the Polish Cultural Institute (IPK) in Leipzig (a branch of the IKP in Berlin), were held on 19 October, at the monument commemorating the death of Prince Józef Poniatowski in the River Elster, the commander of the Polish forces and the only foreigner promoted to the rank of marshal of France by Napoleon (in the course of the battle of Leipzig). Participants in this event included among others: former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic Karl Schwarzenberg, the Minister of Arts and Sciences of Saxony Prof. Sabine von Schorlemer, Deputy Ambassador of the Polish Republic to the German Federal Republic Andrzej Szynka, Deputy Mayor of Leipzig Torsten Bonew, the Polish Honorary Consul in Leipzig Markus Kopp, the Chairman of the Kraków City Council BogusÅaw KoÅmider, the Deputy Director of the Leipzig branch of the Polish Cultural Institute based in Berlin Ambassador Wojciech WiÄckowski and the President of the Polish-Saxon Society Maria Diersch.\n\nIn his speech, Dr. Ciechanowski drew attention to the fact that Prince Józef Poniatowski symbolised the struggle for an independent Poland. His heroic death, due to his refusal to surrender, signalled the end of hopes of regaining independence. But that struggle was to continue and Prince Józef found his niche in the pantheon of national heroes. Dr. Ciechanowski thanked his Saxon hosts for their remembrance of Józef Poniatowski in the shape of a square named after him and the monument. He also mentioned the traditions linking Poland and Saxony.\n\nDuring his stay in Leipzig, Dr. Ciechanowski also met the Mayor of Leipzig Burkhard Jung, and took part in the ceremony held at Leipzig’s Old Trade Exchange of awarding the first Ring of Prince Józef Poniatowski for services in developing Polish-German cooperation, which was awarded by the Polish-Saxon Society to Prof. Georg Milbradt, the prime minister of Saxony in the period 2002-2008. Dr. Ciechanowski also laid flowers at the Monument to Polish Victims of World War II at the Eastern Cemetery in Leipzig, visited the imposing Battle of the Nations Monument built in 1913, and the panorama of the battle “Leipzig in the throes of battle” by Yadegar Asisi, installed in the Panometer Leipzig, and also St. John’s Cemetery where Prince Józef Poniatowski was buried after the battle and where there is a commemorative plaque dedicated to his memory.\n\nOn 20 October, Dr. Ciechanowski took part in the reconstruction of the battle in with the help of over 6000 participants from 28 countries with 180 ‘historical reenactors’ from Poland, mostly from the of Polish Regiments of 1717-1831 “ArsenaÅ” and the OstroÅÄcka History Association “Czwartacy”. The Office for War Veterans and Victims of Oppression co-financed the participation of the Polish “reconstructionists” in this event. Before the reconstruction of the battle began, Dr. Ciechanowski participated in a field mass in Dölitz, in which the Polish ‘reenactors’ took place. Next, in the Torhaus Historical Museum in Dölitz, under the plaque commemorating Prince Józef Poniatowski and the 8000 Polish soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Nations, Dr. Ciechanowski decorated Bogdan Apathy and Krzysztof Franaszczuk, two of the founder members of the Napoleonic reenactment movement in Poland in 1993, members of the ÅlÄÅ¼aÅsk Society. They contributed to the fact that the Leipzig city authorities named the square on which stands the monument dedicated to Józef Poniatowski after the Prince, and also to unveil the above-mentioned plaque.\n\nThe defeat of the Napoleonic armies in Leipzig was the beginning of the end of Polish hopes for regaining their independence at the side of the French emperor. It was the biggest battle of the Napoleonic campaigns and his greatest set back. During the battle, the losses of Napoleon and his allies totalled 55 000 in dead, wounded and those taken prisoner. Apart from Poniatowski, the generals Sykstus Estko and Walenty KwaÅniewski also died. The Polish soldiers who fought at Leipzig are commemorated by inscription on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier."
