        "meta_description": "Broadly speaking, Napoleon's campaigns succeeded when he had the right senior leaders in the right place at the right time for the right reason. And, conversely, they failed when he did not. This paper leverages current talent management principles as a cognitive framework for understanding how Napoleon selected, motivated, employed, and retained his twenty-six senior-most officers: his marshals. This paper presents multiple case studies of Napoleon's leadership and management of his marshals and reframes three of his most disastrous campaigns (the Peninsular War, the Leipzig Campaign, and the Waterloo Campaign) as failures of talent management rather than purely failures of tactical decision-making. Therefore, the conclusion this paper reaches is that Napoleon's shortcomings as a talent manager decisively undermined his genius as a tactical commander. This paper concludes by tying these themes to current problem sets and urges commanders to prioritize talent management in order to develop and employ subordinates who can serve as force multipliers.",
