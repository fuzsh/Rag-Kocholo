        "text": "Some progress, some research...\n\nAccording to the box art, the gorget on the ammunition belt (the lion's head and the shield with the letter \"N\" connected by chains) is the color of old gold, but the reenactor from my club suggested that the ornaments were silver.\n\nThree medals adorn the prince's chest.\n\n1. The War Order of Virtuti Militari (VM, Latin for military bravery - (virtue) of military valor) - the highest Polish war decoration, awarded for outstanding military merits. It is one of the oldest war orders in the world. Established by King Stanisław August Poniatowski on June 22, 1792 to celebrate the victory in the Battle of Zieleniec after the start of the Polish-Russian war against the intervention of the Russian Empire and the Targowica Confederation, and in defense of the Constitution on May 3.\n\nThe motto of the order is: Honor and Fatherland.\n\nThe order was awarded during the period of the Duchy of Warsaw. After creating the so-called The Order of the Congress Kingdom of Poland, while retaining its statute, received the name of the Polish Military Order.\n\nIt was to be divided into five classes, of which the first three had an order form, and the other two had a medal form:\n\n1st class - Grand Cross with a Star,\n\n2nd class - Commander's Cross,\n\n3rd class - Knight's Cross,\n\n4th class - Gold Medal,\n\n5th class - Silver Medal\n\nAfter regaining independence in 1918, the Legislative Sejm, under the Act of August 1, 1919, revived the order, giving it the name of the Military Order of Virtuti Militari. Currently, the order may be awarded during the war or 5 years after its end by the President of the Republic of Poland at the request of the Chapter of the Virtuti Militari War Order.\n\nThe total number of those awarded is over 26,000. Prince Poniatowski was the first person awarded with this medal.\n\n2. Commander of the Legion of Honor - granted on July 22, 1807\n\nThe Legion of Honour is the highest French order of merit, both military and civil. Established in 1802 by Napoleon Bonaparte, it has been retained by all later French governments and régimes.\n\nThe order's motto is Honneur et Patrie (\"Honour and Fatherland\"), and its seat is the Palais de la Légion d'Honneur next to the Musée d'Orsay, on the left bank of the Seine in Paris.\n\nThe order is divided into five degrees of increasing distinction: Chevalier (Knight), Officier (Officer), Commandeur (Commander), Grand officier (Grand Officer), and Grand-croix (Grand Cross).\n\n3. Star of the Order of the Legion of Honor\n\nWhite VGC - primer:\n\nM."
