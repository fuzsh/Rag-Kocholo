        "text": "The Napoleonic Wars are still reflected by works of art and products of arts and crafts, or any imprints of human creativity called Napoleonic memorabilia (or Napoleonics). Regarding the rich iconography of these objects we can create an idea of the events and personalities that at the turn of the 18th century and the 19th century were stirring the fate of Europe. It is a specific category of cultural heritage which functions as a mediator of historical memory with a clear reference to the contradictory character of Napoleon Bonaparte. His dizzying life story, which surprised and shocked the society at the same time, has been presented in numerous collections of castles and other manor residences for many centuries. Among the major historical events that influenced the collecting of these artefacts in the historical lands of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, besides military successes of Coalition in the Battle of Aspern and other battles in recent years of the Napoleonic wars, was also the marriage of the Emperor Napoleon I with the Austrian Archduchess Marie Louise, the factual alliance of the Austrian and French Imperial Houses. These events, their main actors and other participants, whether standing alongside or against France, provided artists with a variety of themes for their artistic interpretation. The birth of the successor of the French throne, the legitimate descendant of the Habsburg and Bonaparte dynasty, with the newly established title of the Roman King, meant one of the decisive inspirational impulses for the world of art and period iconography. Renowned events attended by the members of both Imperial Houses and the Czech nobility are still commemorated in iconography on a number of objects in château collections currently managed by the National Heritage Institute in the Czech Republic. These collections also preserved items from Napoleon's inheritance which were perceived by their former owners and noble collectors as relics or curiosities and, at the same time, a trace of great history, reminded in their ancestral memory.\n\n312 pages, 60 maps, 54 tables, 41 OOBs This book contains 28 maps by Archibald Frank Becke (1871-1947) that have come from these papers and his three books (1907, 1914 and 1936) dealing with the Waterloo Campaign that have been described as “A must for the specialist, but equally of value for the general reader seeking reputable military history.” These have been supplemented by 31 maps from Ferraris (1777) that were used by both sides, W. B. Craan (1816), Cotton (1846), Prussian Maps of Rothenburg (1848), Woer (1857), Siborne (Hooper (1862), Major-General C. W. Robinson (1906), W. Hyde Kelly (1906), James (1908), and Fortescue (1910). In addition, David Wright gave his permission to reproduce his map from his fine article in (2012) Waterloo Artillery: British French and Prussian, Smoothbore Ordnance Journal SOJ-5 on the use of the Royal Horse Artillery as a tactical reserve. Chapter 2 outlines the situation from Napoleon’s return to France. Chapter 3 is Becke’s translation of Napoleon’s lucid reasoning dictated on St Helana of the situation that faced him in 1815 from the chapter entitled “Plan de Campaign de 1815” given in his (1867) Commentaires. The importance and topography of the Low Countries of Belgium and the Netherlands (Chapters 4 and 5). In order to enhance the theme of logistics, the editor has written chapters on the supplying of the armies greatly influenced how they were deployed, the complex story of supply to the British Army, the Board of Ordnance, water, rations, British camp equipment and infantry loads in Chapter 6. The Tricks of the Trade (Chapter 22) explains the time and space required for troops, visibility and what could be seen at sunrise and sunset times during the Waterloo Campaign. Archibald Becke gives an appreciation of the situation from the point of view of a French staff officer before the campaign started on 1 June 1815 (Chapter 7). The organisations and the initial orders for the Armée du Nord (Chapter 8), the Anglo-Dutch Army of Wellington and the Prussian Army of Blücher (Chapter 9) are described. Becke’s notes upon the re-equipping of the Royal Horse Artillery with 9-pdrs and their final positions at 7pm on 18 June 1815 is incorporated in Chapter 10. Becke demonstrated his eye for the battlefields in Quatre Bras and Ligny (Chapter 11), the application of the strategic advanced guard for the 14-17 June (Chapter 12) and then the Prussian Movements on 17 June 1815 the movements in the night of 18 June 1815 (Chapter 13) and Prussian Plans for 18 June 1815 (Chapter 14). Becke expertly examines in Chapter 15, the battlefield of Waterloo, the reason for Wellington’s Detachment at Hal and Tubize, claimants for the first shot from Wellington’s Position, Wellington’s Position, opening fire of the Grande Batterie and Napoleon’s position. Chapter 16 on the Battle of Waterloo is succinctly explained from the initial dispositions, and the Prussian attacks upon Plancenoit. Chapters 17-20 follows the fortunes of Marshal Grouchy to and from Wavre. Chapter 21 is a Becke’s masterful summary of the incidents, features and causes of Napoleon’s ultimate defeat."
