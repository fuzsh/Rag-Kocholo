        "text": "Napoleon thought he was pursuing an Austrian Army that was trying to evade him and regain secure lines of supply, either by passing north of Po and marching east or by marching south to Genoa where the Royal Navy could ensure its supply by sea.\n\nBy the 13th he was facing, if not completely in contact, with the main Austrian army at Alessandria, between them lay the plain between the river Scrivia and the Bromida river, and most importantly the Bromida river itself.\n\nAt this point he chose to detach two divisions one north and one south to keep the Austrians from getting away. In the process he reduced his strength to almost half of that of the main Austrian army and certainly no more than two thirds of it.\n\nAs a consequence when the Austrians attacked on the morning of the 14th the French situation rapidly became serious.\n\nDespite the restriction posed by the bridges over the Bromida and general Austrian ponderousness by eleven in the morning the French were being forced back along their entire line and were in danger of breaking.\n\nAt this point Napoleon finally realizing his danger sent messages off to recall the divisions he'd sent north and south earlier in the day. He also ordered his reserves, the Guard and Monnier's division forward. Conveniently for the French the Austrians chose to take an hour at midday to pause and re-group.\n\nBy 1300 their attack had resumed, and by 1400 Victor's position in Marengo was desperate, and an Austrian Force under General Ott was threatening to turn the French right and cut the line of retreat for the French center. The bulk of the French army faced annilhilation.\n\nRather than reinforcing his crumbling center Napoleon deployed his reserves to face Ott on the right. This prevented an envelopment but between 1400 and 1500 the French were again being forced back all along their line. Their withdrawal remained orderly, partly because the Austrian cavalry had been completely committed, but they'd clearly been defeated. At about 1500 the Austrian Commander in Chief Melas, old and battered from a hard day's fight, chose to turn the pursuit over to his subordinate Zach and leave the field.\n\nAt about this point Desaix with Boudet's division which had been sent south close behind him arrived on the field of battle. He is famously suppossed to have told Napoleon that although one battle had been lost there was still time to win another.\n\nThat the Austrians under Zach took until 1630 to organize their pursuit gave the retreating French troops time to rally, and Desaix time to deploy Boudet's fresh division south of the road along which the Austrian pursuit would come.\n\nThe Austrian pursuit column in the center essentially walked into a gigantic unexpected ambush.\n\nIt broke, and routed, fled. The flanking Austrian forces were left hanging in the air.\n\nThe French defeat had become a victory, but a very expensive one. The price included the life of Desaix who'd been killed leading the counter-attack.\n\nThe French casualties were about 7,000 men.\n\nThe Austrians had roughly 6,000 men killed, lost 40 guns and had 8,000 men taken prisoner.\n\nAs First Consul, Napoleon's political position was still fragile. He had needed victory and and he took pains to re-write the record to make Marengo appear more of one than it was.\n\nHe had planned on annihilating Melas army and was forced to allow it retire more or less intact; his own army being considerably battered. He was forced to wait most of the year for Moreau in Germany to achieve a sufficiently great victory at Hohenlinden that the Austrians were compelled to make peace.\n\nA less than ideal outcome from the First Consul's point of view, first the war weary French were forced to wait for peace and then it came as the result of the success of a rival general.\n\nStill an outright defeat at Marengo might have ended his career.\n\nNapoleon's army had already been in winter quarters for most of a month when, during late January, the Russians launched an unseasonal and unexpected offensive through East Prussian and towards Danzig.\n\nContrary to Napoleon's claims at the time and to that of some later historians this was not likely in response to aggressive foraging by Ney's Corps but rather a deliberate plan by the Russians that had been arrived at some weeks earlier.\n\nIn the event both the Russian offensive and Napoleon's countering attempt to trap them failed to come off successfully. The Russians were retreating when Bennigsen decided to turn his army and face the pursuing French at Eylau.\n\nThe initial part of the battle seems to have begun by accident on the evening of 7th. Napoleon's original plan having been to draw up his army on the heights to the west of Eylau itself and there await the attack of the Russians until Ney turned up on their north flank and Davout on their southern one.\n\nApparently the French train (including Napoleon's own personal staff) got lost and attempting to set up in Eylau became involved in an action with Russian outposts that rapidly escalated out of control as both sides fed troops into the battle.\n\nThe struggle ended with the Frenchmen of Soult's, Murat's, and Augereau's Corps in control of the village, perhaps at least some of them enjoyed a somewhat more sheltered night because of this, but losses on both sides had been heavy.\n\nThe 8th opened with snowstorms, and an immense artillery duel, soon followed by Soult's Corps attacking in the center with the intent of pinning the Russians until Ney's and Davout's flanking Corps could arrive.\n\nThe Russians obliged with a counter-attack that resulted in Napoleon committing Augereau in the south center in hopes of taking the pressure off of Soult. Unfortunately for the French Augereau's Corps got lost in the blowing snow and stumbled into the artillery duel between the grand batteries of both sides and was mauled past usability by a combination of heavy fire from the Russian guns and their own artillerymen firing blind.\n\nNapoleon had to commit his last reserve, the cavalry under Murat, to restore his center and save the remenants of Augereau's men. Murat succeeded in this; breaking the Russian center and taking a battery of 70 Russian guns, but at the cost of 1,500 troops out of 10,000.\n\nWhen a stray Russian column threatened Napoleon's HQ in Eylau the Guard infantry itself had to be used to restore the situation.\n\nSo after a desperate morning for the French center, Davout was finally fully in position on the southern Russian left flank, and Napoleon ordered his attack for 1300. By 1530 the Russian line had been pushed back into a great right angle and was about to break when reinforcements in the form of Lestocq's 9000 Prussians arrived from the north and marching across the rear of the Russian forces formed on their far left.\n\nDavout was outflanked on his right by these new forces and the battle seemed to be favoring the Allies when Ney in his turn arrived, by 2000 (8:00pm) he was successfully attacking the Russian left flank in the north. The Allied counter-offensive on the opposite flank ground to a halt around 2200 (10:00pm).\n\nDark and exhaustion closed the battle without any decisive result despite bitter losses for both sides.\n\nBennigsen withdrew his forces during the night.\n\nThe French losses were about 4,000 men on the 7th, and a further 10,000 on the 8th.\n\nThe Russians lost about 4,000 men on the 7th and maybe about 25,000 on the 8th.\n\nAs the French held the field afterwards they could claim a victory. The general consensus since is that Eylau was a horrible and costly draw and the first major exception to Napoleon's long record of victories.\n\nDupont had been charged with taking Andalusia. The French, Napoleon in particular, having been grossly over-optimistic he'd been given wholly inadquate forces both in number and quality for the task.\n\nForced back to the upper Guadalquiver River valley and then reinforced with Vedel's division to almost double his previous numbers Dupont waited, not wanting to retreat over the mountain passes to the north and abandon Andalusia, but uncertain of his ability to maintain himself there safely let alone to go on the attack.\n\nThe Spanish did not wait. Combining regular forces from both Andalusia (Castanos) and Grenada (Reding) as well as various bands of popular irregulars they attacked.\n\nDupont was deployed along the northern bank of the Guadalquiver from Andujar east, his own main force being in Andujar itself, Vedel's division to the east both holding the river line and the line of communications that ran north-east back through the towns of Baylen and La Carolina to the passes through the Sierra Morena. The Spanish plan was that Castanos would pin Dupont at Andujar while Reding flanked him upstream crossing the river and descending on his left rear.\n\nIt can't be said that the Spanish plan worked out as intended, but in a sense through a combination of their own errors and confusions and much worse ones on the part of the French matters worked out better than they could have realistically planned for.\n\nReding was able to occupy Baylen without a fight because Vedel had marched away to meet an illusory threat at La Carolina. At the same time with no idea what had happened Dupont evacuated Andujar and marched for Baylen with only a weak advance guard, his wounded and loot in the center of his column, and a strong rear guard intended to hold off the attacks from Castanos that were his main fear.\n\nIt was dawn on the 19th when Dupont's advance guard discovered Redings troops in Baylen.\n\nReding had time to deploy properly across the road into town as well to leave a detachment to delay Vedel should he arrive. Dupont in contrast worried about being attacked in the rear threw his tired and not very good troops into a series of piecemeal attacks. The last of these came close to success but failed. With that failure the morale of the French troops broke completely and they refused to make further efforts. Dupont was trapped between two Spanish armies with no way out, he had to make terms. Worse for the French once Vedel had awoken to the situation and marched on Baylen, Duponts cornered soldiers were used as hostages, Dupont was pressured into ordering Vedel to surrender his undefeated troops and Vedel felt compelled to follow those orders.\n\nThe equivalent of an entire French Corps had been totally defeated.\n\nThe French losses were about 20,000 men, about 18,000 having surrendered. 1,200 Swiss deserted to the enemy, the rest were dead either in battle or from the rigors of campaigning.\n\nThe Spanish lost about 1,000 men.\n\nBaylen not only shook the French hold on Spain forcing them to retreat to north of the Elbro, it shook the French hold on Europe. French armies had earned a ruputation for invincibility at Marango, Austerlitz, Jena and Friedland, Baylen gave that reputation the lie.\n\nHaving been pursued across most of Castile and Galacia Sir John Moore's army, representing most of Britain's effective land forces, finally reached the sea and a rendezvous with an evacuation fleet at Corunna.\n\nHowever, needing time to embark his forces Moore elected to offer battle a few miles down the main road south from Corunna. The position he chose was on a hill called \"Monte Mero\", his line ran east to west from a point north of the village of Piedralonga to a point north of the village of Elvina. The east of the line was held by Hope's strong three brigade division and the west by Biard's strong division also of three brigades.\n\nThis position was strong to its front but had some weaknesses being lower than the Heights of Penasquedo a long cannon shot to its south, and having a weak open right flank on the east around Elvina.\n\nThere was not a lot Moore could do about the first problem, but to address the second he positioned two weak divisions behind his right flank, Paget's to his immediate right rear and Fraser's further to the east and north almost as far back as Corunna's outer fortifications. These units were out of French sight.\n\nSoult drew his forces up south of the British on the Heights of Penasquedo. The eastern part of the line was held by Delaborde's division with Lorge's cavalry on its flank, next in line to the west was Merle's division, Mermet's division on Soult's left formed the western most part of his main line. Further west were the cavalry divisions of La Houssaye and Franceschi.\n\nSoult's plan was that while the presence of the divisions of Delaborde and Merle held the British in place, that Mermet's men would attack and turn the British right flank under Biard. His artillery would render direct assistance, and the cavalry under La Houssaye and Franceschi indirect assistance. La Houssaye would swing wide around the British right flank, Franceschi wider.\n\nIn the event after bitter fighting in and around Elvina, and losing both Baird and Moore himself to the supporting French artillery, the British right managed to hold.\n\nPaget's forces saw off both the leftmost units of Mermet's division and La Houssaye's cavalry.\n\nFraser's brigade prevented Franceschi from succeeding in his flanking effort.\n\nTactically the British had won. Operationally they were able to get their army off during the night, somewhat more tattered, but still intact.\n\nThe French losses were about 1,500 men.\n\nThe British lost about 900 men.\n\nThe exact impact of the retreat to Corunna and the subsequent battle there are still debated.\n\nThere's no doubt the British were chased out of Spain and badly battered in the process, but they did escape, despite being heavily outnumbered by the best soldiers in Europe under experienced leadership.\n\nMoreover, a good argument can be made that Moore's campaign distracted Napoleon's forces in Spain at a critical time, preventing his overrunning the entire country in a timely manner, and allowing breathing room for the Spanish revolt to gather strength.\n\nThe total French forces in the peninsula overwhelmingly outnumbered the British and Portuguese, but as well as facing numerous Spanish regulars, they were dispersed holding down hostile populations. The various French Corps were also largely out of communication with each other and therefore unable to provide mutual support. Soult's Corps was the only one actually occupying Portuguese territory so it was Soult that Wellesley picked to attack.\n\nSoult himself was headquartered in Oporto with about half of his Corps, the rest being dispersed trying to keep the countryside down and his lines of communication (and potential retreat) open.\n\nWellesley tried to keep his attack a surprise, but in the event Soult received at least a days warning. This was long enough for him to begin preparing his withdrawal, to pull his forces north of the Douro river, to destroy the bridge across it at Oporto, and to either sink all the boats on the river or at least move them to its north side. Soult's main concern seems to have a British attack from the sea or across the Douro's wide estuary and he deployed his forces in Oporto and to the west to watch against this possibility, leaving the river to east poorly watched. He, not unreasonably, seemed to expect it would take the British at least a few day's to organize a river crossing.\n\nHe failed to allow for Wellesley's intiative or the considerable help he received from the supportive local population. A local barber pointed out some unsunk and unguarded barges just a little upstream from Oporto and helped in sneaking them across to the river's north side.\n\nThe location was perfect, high ground on the south bank kept that part of the river out of sight from downstream and formed a location where artillery could be placed to dominate the north bank. Furthermore on the north bank was a large and eminently defensible seminary.\n\nWellesley assigned Paget the command of the troops that would attempt to cross and hold the seminary. He placed a division under Sherbrooke to hold the river bank facing the city, and finally he sent several battalions under Murray to cross the river a few miles upstream and create a diversion.\n\nThe troops starting slipping across the river to the seminary at 10:00am on the 12th, by the time the French noticed at 10:30 several hundred had got across and established themselves. Aided by heavy fire from their guns on the south bank the British beat off all the French counter attacks. Paget was wounded and command went to Hill, but overall the losses were disporportionately French.\n\nWhen Soult pulled his troops out of the city to meet the British threat some of the population rioted, but others boarded their boats and started helping Sherbrooke's troops across the river.\n\nMid-afternoon saw the French in full retreat to the north east.\n\nMurray's force watched this retreat but did not try to intervene, and Murray has been critized as having thrown away the chance to actually cut off and destroy Soult's forces, but given the disparity in numbers and the rough handling some dragoons who did attack the retreating French received, this might not be entirely fair.\n\nThe French losses were about 600 men and 6 guns in battle, plus another 1,500 sick wounded in Oporto hospitals and 52 originally Portuguese seige guns .\n\nThe British lost 123 men.\n\nSoult's forces were harried into Galacia losing their baggage and guns on the way. Portugal was free of French invaders for a while at least. Wellesley might have been somewhat disappointed not to have actually cut-off and destroyed Soult, but given the rough equivalence between the regular forces involved he could not have been too surprised at the outcome.\n\nHaving chased Soult out of Northern Portugal Wellesley next moved to central Portugal with the aim of meting out the same treatment (in conjunction with Cuesta's Spanish army of Estremadura) to the French 1st Corps under Marshal Victor.\n\nIf Victor had remained in place in the frontier province of Estremadura facing Cuesta, Wellington would have fallen on his rear or flank and the outnumbered French would have doubtless taken a severe drubbing leaving the road to Madrid open.\n\nIn the event Victor fell back to Madrid well before hearing of Wellesley's advance because his soldiers had been starving. They'd stripped Estremadura, a poor province in the first place, of all sustenance.\n\nGiven his own problems with supply and co-ordination with the Spanish Wellesley's efforts to take Victor at a disadvantage failed. The 27th of July saw the Allies at Talavera de la Reyna several marchs west of Madrid facing not just Victor's 1st Corps, but the French reserves from Madrid under King Joseph (with Jourdan advising) and the 4th Corps of Sebastiani. The plan had been that Spanish Army of La Mancha under Venegas would keep Sebastiani busy, it hadn't worked.\n\nTalavera lies on the river Tagus, in 1809 there were still several miles of open plain between it and the hills to the north. The Spanish defended the town and part of the plain to it's north, the British defended most of the open plain and the first major hill, the Cerro de Medellin, to its north. A small valley to the north of that before the Sierra de Sequirilla was watched by cavalry.\n\nThe British had four divisions, three of them in line, Campbell in the south, Sherbrooke in the center and Hill in the north holding the Cerro de Medellin, with Mackenzie in reserve behind Sherbrooke.\n\nThe French deployed their forces almost entirely against the northern British held part of the Allied line. Some of the northernmost Spanish battalions faced French infantry but most of the Spanish Army was screened with cavalry. The northern right part of the French line was made of of Victor's 1st Corps, from north to south the divisions of Ruffin, Villatte, and Lapisse. To their south the line was composed of Sebastiani's 4th Corps, He directly commanded his northernmost 1st division of Frenchmen, Laval's 2nd division of Germans formed the far left of the French infantry line.\n\nThe evening of the the 27th saw some accidental skirmishs embarrassing to the British but without serious results, and one serious night attack ordered by Victor and carried out by Ruffin's division against Hill's division holding the Cerro de Medellin. Victor had indentified it as the key to the Allied position.\n\nTwo of the three columns committed became lost, and although the third column succeeded in surprising the ill prepared British division and both sides lost heavily in the sharp and confused action that resulted, the night ended with the British still holding the position.\n\nAt five in the morning, dawn saw a better organized repeat of the effort, this time the better prepared British sent Ruffin's troops reeling back with heavy losses amounting to a quarter of their entire force all lost in less than an hour.\n\nTheir initial efforts stymied the French paused for several hours before trying again. This time their intent was to hold the British by a broad front attack especially against the British right and and center in the plains, and to send Ruffin's and Villettes on a flanking movement to the north. Cerro de Medellin they decided to let be until success elsewhere.\n\nSeeing the French re-deploying for their flanking movement Wellesley asked for and received Spanish help, Bassecourt's infantry division, a heavy artillery battery, and Albuquerque's cavalry division. Wellesley also redeployed his own cavalry and what he coould of Hill's artillery on Cerro de Medellin.\n\nAt around two in the afternoon the French guns opened up, completely overpowering the Allied artillery, they took a terrible toll especially on the exposed troops in the British center.\n\nThe first infantry attack was made by Laval's Germans around 2:30 (1430). It was driven back with heavy losses by Campbell's division which made a limited counter attack and then re-formed its lines. Some part of this attack also engaged the northern Spanish battalions which, giving a good account of themselves, held.\n\nThree in the afternoon (1500) saw Laprisse and Sebastiani's divisions attacking Sherbrooke's lines in the British center. Once more British volley's decimated the front ranks of their attackers and a counter attack sent them fleeing. Unlike Campbell's division, however, Sherbrooke's men did not rally and return to their defensive lines, rather they continued their counter attack until they ran into the second line of the French forces and were countered attack and forced to flee in return.\n\nThis disaster was redeemed by the committment of Mackenzies brigade strength division and a strong battalion (the 1/48th) Wellesley detached from Hill's division. The survivors of Sherbrooke's ill fated counterattack rallied behind these fresh troops.\n\nWhile this drama unfolded in the center, Campbell's division beat off a second attack by Laval at around four in the afternoon.\n\nThe losses had been terrible on both sides, including both generals Mackenzie and Laprisse, many more junior officers, and between a quarter and a half of the men involved. This was the battle's crisis and it had come and gone. The British had won although at a terrible cost.\n\nThe situation to the north saw the flanking manouver of Ruffin and Villate fail, forced into squares by the presence of Allied cavalry and then enfilated by Allied artillery fire, facing the infantry of Bassecourt to the north and Hill's to the south, and with the central attack having failed, they gave up their movement as a lost cause despite their troops being relatively fresh and undefeated.\n\nSurveying the situation, Jourdan and Joseph, despite strong presentations by Victor declined to commit their reserves in a final effort.\n\nThe French losses were about 7,268 men and 20 guns.\n\nThe British lost about 5,365 men, the Spanish about 1,200 men.\n\nTalavera saw an Allied army face the French in open battle and hold while inflicting heavy losses. It gained Wellesley a peerage, he became Lord Wellington. It did not make it easier to sustain his Army in Spain, shatter the French forces, or improve co-operation with the Spanish forces.\n\nNevertheless for a few days Wellesley comtemplated operations designed to liberate Madrid. That was before learning Soult was moving from the north against his communications with a force at least equal to his own.\n\nThe Allies had thought Soult's Corps a shattered remenant without equipment or artillery, that Mortier's Corps was spread throughout Leon, Castile and the Asturias holding them down, and that Ney's Corps was similarly occupied in Galacia. In fact, the French had evacuated both the Asturias and Galacia and concentrated Ney's and Mortier's Corps under Soult's command, and Joseph had sent Soult an artillery train to replace that he'd lost and ordered him south against the Allied rear. Soult had three Corps and about 50,000 men, more then the equal of both Allied armies together.\n\nBy the time Wellesley and Cuesta realized this they barely had time to escape to south across the Tagus river into a country naturally harsh and already denuded, their armies suffered terribly in the process. Many of the British wounded were left behind to be captured at Talavera.\n\nThe frontier fortresses having fallen \"The Army of Portugal\" over 60,000 strong under the justly famous Marshal Messena marched into Portugal without any serious opposition from the Allied army of Wellington.\n\nWellington was not eager to meet French veterans with mostly untried troops in the open field. Moreover, the French had the advantage in both artillery and cavalry.\n\nThe rough line of the French advance was parallel to the Valley of the river Mondego to the city of Coimbra, and from there south parallel to the coast to Lisbon.\n\nWellington expected they'd take the good road that ran south of the Mondego and planned to meet them around Ponte Murcella along the line of the river Alva close to Coimbra.\n\nTo his pleasant surprise Messena without good maps, or good guides, and,perhaps, aware of the Wellington's preparations to meet him along the southern road instead moved his Corps along a very bad northern road through Viseu north of the Mondego. At Viseu he could have struck for the coast directly but instead he moved towards Coimbra and the long ridge of Bussaco that lies north and east of it.\n\nIt was at Bussaco that Wellington prepared to meet the French. The ridge's slopes forced a stiff climb on any infantry attacking and rendered Messena's cavalry and artillery largely useless.\n\nWellington placed Cole's 4th division northmost on his far left flank, south of Cole across the main road he placed Spencer's 1st division, Picton's 3rd division held the center, Leith's 5th division the right center, and Hill's 2nd division the far right.\n\nIn front of Cole's right and of Spencer, covering the main road, he placed from north to south Campbell's independant Portuguese brigade, then Crauford's Light Division, and then the independant Portuguese brigades of Coleman and Pack\n\nThe French 2nd Corps under Reynier arrived first and moved off south to face the Allied center, Ney's 6th Corps remained in the vicinity of the main road facing the Allied left, and Junot's 8th Corp remained to the rear.\n\nIt's hard to be certain but the French seem to have believed that they only faced a rearguard and furthermore one with it's right flank opposite Reynier's location. They had not yet learned of Wellington's proclivity for deploying troops out of sight, and were unaware both of Hill's and Leigh's divisions on the reverse slopes of the southern portion of the Bussaco ridge and of the many troops in the forward line below the ridge's crest in the vicinity of the main road.\n\nAt any rate Messena's plan was that Reyniers 2nd Corps should attack first, and upon gaining the ridge's crest re-form and attack northwards, Ney was to launch a frontal attack along the line of the main road when he saw Reynier had reached the crest. The Allied troops would find themselves faced with a simultaneous attacks from the front and their right rear.\n\nJunot was to be the French reserve.\n\nOn the morning of the 27th Reynier launched his attack as soon as it was light enough. Heudelet's division attacked on the left (south) and reached the Allied line first. The packed French columns were driven back by concentrated volley fire from units of Picton's division.\n\nMerle's division on Reynier's right (to the north) actually set off before Heudelet, but had the tougher climb, and took longer to get to the top of the ridge. They found it unoccupied and had a moment of triumph but not time to deploy before Picton brought reinforcements to bear on both thier flanks, which pouring volley's into the disorganized French masses forced them back off the ridge.\n\nThere was one more French attack to come in this sector. The brigade under General Foy which belonged to Heudelet's division had through some misunderstanding failed to attack with the rest of the division. Reynier discovering this sent them forward. Like Merle's men they penetrated to a part of the ridge uncovered by Allied troops, and like Merle's troops were forced back before they could establish themselves by reinforcements. This time those reinforcements were units from General Leigh's division and were commanded by him.\n\nWith Foy defeated Reynier was left without fresh troops, his attack had failed.\n\nUnfortunately for the French Ney saw Reynier's troops reach the ridge's crest without realizing they would be forced back and subsequently launched his own attacks further north. His northernmost column consisted of Loison's division, mercilessly harassed by skirmishers and artillery, it advanced until it reached Crauford's hidden main line which rose and blew away the column's head with close range volley fire.\n\nOne battalion of Loison's drifted off its correct line of advance to receive similar treatment from Coleman's Portuguese.\n\nNey's southern division under Marchand had a slightly less difficult approach, but the attack ended in front of Pack's brigade the same as had all the others, stopped by close range volley fire.\n\nIt was only eight in the morning but the French had had enough.\n\nMessena called off any further attacks and sent out scouts to find a route around Bussaco. They found a mountain road to the north. Noon on the 28th saw the French army on the move again.\n\nThe French losses were about 4,500 men.\n\nThe Allies lost 1,252 men.\n\nWellington didn't stop the French at Bussaco, but he'd taught them to be more cautious in the future, and given his men, especially the untried Portuguese units cause for confidence.\n\nWhen Massena came into sight of the Lines of Torres Valles both sides knew he had no chance of forcing them. Basically unable to take Lisbon by assualt and unable to starve it out, it was in fact the French Army in danger of starving, all Messena could do was wait and hope for something to happen. Hope the British government would overreact and evacuate, or that Wellington would offer battle in the open, or that one of the other French armies in the Peninsula would come to his assistance and open a proper supply line in the process. Hope is not a strategy, however, and none of these things happened.\n\nAfter weeks of privation the much diminished French Army had to retrace its tracks. The third and last French invasion of Portugal had failed.\n\nMaterially it did not take Messena long to put the French Army of Portugal back into fighting trim.\n\nMorale and relations among the senior commanders, however, remained poor.\n\nStill facing Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese Army in the open on the Spanish-Portuguese border between the fortresses of Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo, Massena had every right to expect the more numerous French could beat the Allies. With superior cavalry he could hope that any such victory would be decisive. So although we have no actual record of Massena's intent, it seems likely his main goal when he attacked in May 1811 was the not the relief of Almeida, but rather the destruction of Wellington's army.\n\nBy May 3rd Massena had driven Wellington's screening forces back upon the main Allied position.\n\nThe French immediately attacked the key village of Fuentes de Onoro, in fact, taking it from its garrison of picked British troops and wounding the garrison commander Colonel Williams in the process. Wellington ordered a three regiment counterattack that re-took most of the village including the key high ground. The British lost 259 men to the French 652.\n\nThe 4th of May was spent by the French on reconnaisance and manouvering. Massena having learned Wellington's right flank was largely open past Fuentes de Onaro settled on a plan to outflank him there. An assault by picked troops would take the village unhinging the Allied flank just as it was being turned.\n\nDuring the night of May 4th Wellington, anticipating a possible French flanking move, but not its size, moved his 7th Division into the village of Pozo Bello on his far right. He covered the gap between Pozo Bello and Fuentes de Onoro with cavalry. Wellington also moved troops , most notably the Light Division, from his left and center to the north to reserve positions on the plateau behind Fuente de Onoro.\n\nMassena's cavalry attacked at dawn. The Spanish cavalry to the south on Wellington's farthest right was driven off. The 7th division was in danger of being cut-off. It was forced out of Pozo Bello by two French infantry divisions (supported by third). A courageous and disciplined covering action by the greatly outnumbered British cavalry and horse artillery kept it from being overwhelmed long enough that Wellington was able to send the elite Light Division to cover its further withdrawal to the far right of a new line. This new line formed by the the 1st and 3rd divisions met the old Allied line at right angles at the key village of Fuente de Onoro.\n\nIt was at Fuente de Onoro that Massena launched the second, and as it developed, bloodier, prong of his attack. This attack was led by picked grenadiers and strongly supported by the available French artillery. If successful it would unhinge Wellington's entire position by flanking both his wings, while Massena's own strong left wing to the south lay poised to contest the Allies' main line of retreat.\n\nIn the event the British Highlanders and Irish proved a match for the best the French could throw at them. The village was mostly lost at one point but retaken in a counter-attack. Unusually, thanks to its losses in the invasion of Portugal, the French artillery was weaker than the British and unable to blast a way open for the infantry.\n\nBy mid-afternoon it was clear to Massena that both his attempt to disorder and destroy part of the Allied right wing, and his attempt to unhinge the Allied position by taking Fuentes de Onoro, had failed. There was no point in wasting more lives and he called his attack off.\n\nThe French losses were about 2,192 men.\n\nThe Allies lost 1,542 men.\n\nFuentes de Onoro was an attempt to severely defeat, likely even destroy, the Anglo-Portuguese army. It was the first battle that army fought against the French in the open. Massena had every right to expect success. He knew he was one of the best generals in Europe, his infantry the equal of any, and his cavalry and artillery had proven themselves superior to every foe previously encountered.\n\nIn the event, Wellington proved himself Massena's match, and furthermore so did his infantry of all nationalities, his much maligned cavalry (for once its discipline was superb), and his artillery.\n\nIf the Wellington's Army had been badly defeated it would have ended the last major threat to French from regular formed troops in the Peninsula. The French would have been free to disperse their troops to suppress the guerillas and properly occupy most of Spain.\n\nFuentes de Onoro was the watershed of the Peninsular War. From that point on it was all downhill for the French, they never had enough troops to face both Wellington and the Spanish. Substantial reinforcements, the presence of Napoleon himself to co-ordinate operations properly, or a later decisive defeat of Wellington might have changed the situation, but none of those happened.\n\nWhile Wellington dealt with Massena's Army of Portugal on the northern route into the country, Beresford was left on the southern one beseiging the key fortress of Badajoz.\n\nMarshal Soult, commanding in Andalusia, on hearing of the threat to Badajoz concentrated his scattered garrisons and marched to its relief.\n\nBeresford lifted his siege and gathered his troops to meet Soult south of Badajoz on the main road from Andalusia around the village of Albuera. He expected an attack straight up the road, through the village and the center of his position. It was therefore on a line centered on Albuera that he positioned his Anglo-Portuguese divisions during May 15th. When the Spanish army under Blake arrived that night he positioned them on his southern flank. Following Wellington's example he kept his main line, both British and Spanish, out of sight behind the crest of the high ground his dispositions followed.\n\nBecause of this, and the late arrival of Blake's troops, when Soult came up he failed to realize that Blake had already joined Beresford. Individually Soult out numbered both Beresford and Blake, against them together he was significantly outnumbered. It was therefore a primary goal of his strategy to prevent their joining and in order to achieve this he planned a massive outflanking attack around what he thought was Beresford's southern flank in order to split him from Blake.\n\nIn fact, when Soult launched this flanking attack with three-quarters of his infantry early on the 16th, he was attacking the southern flank of Blake's already arrived Spainards.\n\nBeresford and Blake were both caught off guard. A single brigade of Zaya's division was left to take the brunt of the French attack while Beresford marched his 2nd division to its support. Fortunately for the Allies Zaya's was one of the best divisions in the Spanish army and these troops held steadfast for a prolonged period time despite being outnumbered several times to one.\n\nTheir ordeal did not end with the arrival of the first British troops. Colburne's brigade, the first of Stewart's 2nd division to arrive, counter-attacked wheeling in line to pour fire into the flanks of the French columns attacking the Spanish, only to be flanked and attacked by French lancers who all but destroyed the Brigade. Seventy percent losses were inflicted in few minutes.\n\nZaya's troops, however, continued to hold. The other two brigades of the 2nd division arrived in time to meet a renewed assault by the second wave of French columns. The casualities in the head on collision were horrendous on both sides.\n\nThe situation was critical when General Cole commanding the 4th division, which Beresford was holding in reserve, decided on his own to attack, This despite the presence of considerable French cavalry.\n\nSoult by this time had realized that Beresford and Blake were united, that he was outnumbered and his flanking attack had failed. Still faced with Cole's attack he had to send in his reserves under Werle in order save his already committed and battered infantry.\n\nWerle's brigade slightly outnumbered Cole's entire division having nine battalions to Cole's six and a bit. Moreover, Cole had to deploy Harvey's Portuguese brigade to fend off the strong French cavalry. Werle, however, was under the handicap of attacking British troops in line with columns. The slaughter on both sides was again extreme, British musketry decimated the French columns but the British follow-on charge was blown away by supporting French artillery.\n\nThe action between Cole and Werle was the last major action of the day. The French infantry had been beaten and was in full retreat, but the Allied infantry had taken horrendous casualities and were in poor shape themselves. The French cavalry and artillery were intact and deployed to resist any Allied pursuit. Beresford allowed Soult to retreat largely unhindered.\n\nThe French losses were about 7,000 men.\n\nThe Allies lost about 6,000 men (roughly 4,000 British, 1,400 Spanish, 400 Portuguese).\n\nTactically Albuera was a disaster for both sides. As Soult retreated without relieving Badajoz it can be considered an Allied Phyrric victory. In conjunction with Fuentes de Onoro it meant French commanders would be very circumspect about meeting an Anglo-Allied army on anything resembling even odds in the future.\n\nWellington was on the strategic offensive. His target was the French \"Army of Portugal\" under the command of Marshal Marmont. The \"Army of Portugal\" was, in fact, dispersed through out north-west Spain in Leon and Old Castile due to problems of supply. If Wellington could beat this force then the French communications to Madrid and Andalusia would be threatened. He could hope to force an French evacuation of most of Spain south of the Ebro.\n\nBut although he was on offensive strategically, tactically Wellington hoped to fight a defensive battle.\n\nMarmont didn't oblige. Many long weeks of manouver passed. Marmont gathered reinforcements until his army was the equal of Wellington's in everything but cavalry. Wellington missed his chances to attack at an advantage, but neither did he fall into any of the traps Marmont set him. Finally Wellington learned (but Marmont didn't) that King Joseph was marching from Madrid with all the troops he could spare. Marmont was about to be reinforced to the point he'd enjoy a definite superiority. Wellington prepared to retreat.\n\nIt was the 22nd of July and both the armies had been in close contact for days. They were now deployed just south of Salamanca around the village of Los Arapiles. The village was named for two significant hills, the \"Lesser\" Arapile to the north and the \"Greater\" to the South. Both armies were laid out in a fallen-over \"L\" shape, with long legs running east-west and shorter ones north-south. The British lines lay to the north-west of and within the French ones, between the French and Salamanca. The corner of the British lines was anchored on the \"Lesser\" Arapile, that of the French on the \"Greater\" Arapile.\n\nWellington knew this, but Marmont was only able to see some of the Allied forces as Wellington had hide many of them in the dead ground behind the \"Lesser\" Arapile and its associated high ground.\n\nThe first part of the day passed as days before had with skirmishing and manouvering, Marmont extended his left west and Wellington matched him extending his right west also. Neither commander proved willing to bring on a general engagment. Wellington is believed to have been on the verge of attacking when he uncharacteristically allowed Beresford to talk him out of it. Both commanders had late lunches. Wellington in a famous (but variously recorded) incident was still in the middle of his sometime around three in the afternoon , when Marmonts leftmost divisions began to extend themselves excessively to the west, marching separated with their flanks exposed to the British.\n\nMarmont later denied it in his battlefield report, but the most plausible explaination for this is that Marmont seeing the dust from Wellington's withdrawing trains thought it was in fact the better part of the Allied army retreating, and furthermore, thought that Wellington was a hopelessly defensive minded general who Marmont could take liberties with and that therefore the French Marshall directed his leftmost divisions to manouver to cut off the retreat of what he supposed was only the Allied rearguard.\n\nWhatever the case it was the opportunity Wellington had been waiting for. He threw his lunch away and galloped to his 3rd Division. The 3rd Division was positioned in reserve behind Wellington's right flank. He ordered it and the accompanying cavalry to immediately attack the leading French division. This division was Thomiere's.\n\nThat done Wellington dispatched the 5th Division next in line to attack the French division following Thomiere's, that being Maucune's. Again he followed up the infantry attack by that of a brigade of cavalry.\n\nDue to the rolling terrain the French divisions of Thomiere and Maucune failed to see the British attacks coming until the last moment and were caught in the flank while almost completely unprepared. They were routed by the infantry and kept from rallying by pursuing cavalry. A third French division, Brennier's, following the first two was caught up in the attack and crippled. It's leading battalions also routed but others managed to stay in formation and fight back.\n\nThe French having had three of their eight divisions mauled, and their left flank compromised were well on their way to losing the battle. It was for the time being though not Marmont's problem, both he and his second in command, Bonet, had been badly wounded by a British shell. It fell to General Clausel commanding one of the center French divisions to take overall command more than an hour after the action had begun and try to save the day.\n\nClausel's division and the next one in line, Bonnet's, managed to defeat the third phase of Wellington's assault that being the attacks of the 4th Division and Pack's brigade in the British center. Clausel then chose to counter-attack and after severely punishing the 4th Division ran into the British 6th Division which had followed up behind the 4th. Repulsed to its front the French center was also flanked on its left by the 5th Division and the 7th Division following on behind the 5th.\n\nAt some cost the Allies had now shattered five of the eight French divisions. Of the remaining three, Foy's facing the Allied Light Division was so far away on the French right to the north and east as to be out of the fight and Sarret's on the left was fighting a stubborn retreat covering the routing remenants of the divisions shattered there. Only Ferrey's division in reserve behind the French center was fresh and available. Clausel ordered it to fight a rearguard action and cover the French retreat at all costs. Time had to bought so that the rest of the army could get away.\n\nAnd buy time Ferrey did. Eventually his division was forced back and then routed, but not before inflicting crippling losses on the opposing 6th Division, and having bought enough time for dark to fall and bring an end to the battle.\n\nThe immediate Allied pursuit of the defeated French was not vigorous and remains a matter of controversy. Wellington thought a Spanish garrison was occupying Alba de Tormes blocking one main route of retreat, and he ordered the reliatively fresh 1st Division to cut off retreat along the other. The Spanish garrison wasn't there as expected and the 1st Division failed to do much. The same was true of the battered 6th division which was ordered in direct pursuit of the fleeing French. Why the cavalry or the mostly unscathed 7th division weren't used in the direct pursuit is a question the historian Oman asked a hundred years ago, and others asked a hundred years before at the time. The answer is likely some combination of fatigue after a day of battle and days before that of hard marching, maybe of some lack of personal initiative by some generals, and without doubt just the plain fog of war.\n\nThe French losses were about 14,000 men and 20 cannon.\n\nThe Allies lost 5,214 men .\n\nNapoleon was pre-occupied marching his Grande Armee into Russia at the time of Salamanca and his having withdrawn troops from Spain to aid in his Russian campaign was doubtless a contributing factor to making the Allied victory at Salamanca possible. His losses in Russian and Eastern Europe during the next couple of years would dwarf those in the Peninsula.\n\nNevertheless Salamanca was a decisive battle. It unhinged the entire French position in the Peninsula and invalidated Napoleon's strategy there. The French could not both occupy all of Spain and contain Wellington's army, not with the resources they could realistically afford given their problems elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThe immediate results of Salamanca were that French evacuated both Madrid and Andalusia concentrating the Army of the Center and the Army of the South in Valencia. Thus concentrated they were able to counter-attack and push Wellington back into Portugal, but the political damage both in Spain and the rest of Europe had been done, and it was considerable.\n\nIn the longer run Wellington and the Allies had proved they could attack and defeat a French force of equivalent size, and Napoleon was deprived of hundreds of thousands of veteran French soldiers he dearly needed elsewhere.\n\nThe spring of 1813 saw the French strength in Spain depleted by the withdrawal of troops to make up the losses Napoleon had suffered in Russia the year before. What strength they had was concentrated in northern Spain to defend their supply lines to France. Being concentrated in a country never rich and further improverished by years of war, and fighting a guerilla war amidst a hostile population they were very dependant upon those supply lines.\n\nOn the other hand they knew Wellington was also very dependant on his own supply lines which stretched back to Lisbon and would only grow longer as he advanced. What they didn't know was that Wellington had prepared a switch of his supply base to Santander a port on the north coast of Spain, and that Spainish guides had provided him a route that would allow him to completely outflank the planned French lines of resistance.\n\nIn the space of four weeks from late May on Wellington forced the French back, taking Salamanca, Valladolid, and Burgos, and crossing both the Douro and Ebro without fighting a major battle.\n\nWellington finally caught up with the retreating French, and a hugh convoy of loot and civilians, at Vitoria.\n\nVitoria lay in a valley followed by the great road to Bayonne, the main line of communication to France.\n\nThe French were deployed in a series of lines across this valley. Unfortunately for them Wellington did not send his most of divisions straight up the road along the valley bottom.\n\nRather while the Light Division and the 4th Division entertained the French directly Wellington sent most of his forces on three great outflanking manouvers. Hill commanded a force three divisions strong charged with taking the long hill to the south of the valley. Picton and Dalhousie with their divisions were to outflank the French from the northern hills. Graham also led a strong force of four divisions around the north of the French. Wellington's objective for Graham was not to just outflank the French, but to actually get into their rear and block their retreat.\n\nThe battle began with Hill's troops around eight morning pushing both up the valley directly and against the heights to the south of it. Much hard to and fro fighting for the duration of the morning resulted in a stalemate in the valley but the Allies gained the heights of La Puebla to the south and began to push the French there east thereby outflanking the forces the in valley.\n\nGraham had made contact with the Army of Portugal defending the French communications by noon, but the north central forces under Dalhousie failed to come into action as Dalhousie waited for some tardy brigades to come up. Picton commanding the \"Fighting\" 3rd Division took it upon himself to attack without orders.\n\nAttacked on their northern flank, and front, and outflanked to the south the French fell back in increasing disorder. By mid-afternoon the allies had won and the fleeing French, their main line of retreat blocked by Graham, were forced to abandon their guns and baggage and make their way over a secondary route towards Pamplona.\n\nAgain the aftermath of Wellington's victory was controversial. His troops stopped to loot the incrediable wealth of the French convoy rather pursuing the beaten French and fully capitalizing on their success.\n\nThe French losses were about 5,000 men and 151 cannon.\n\nThe Allies lost about 5,000 men .\n\nVitoria ended French power in the Peninsula. Moreover, it had a profound effect on wider European opinion likely destroying any chance Napoleon had of keeping Austria from joining the Allies, or of negotiating a peace that left him in power.\n\nDue to some confusion of orders Davout's III Corps was deployed in and south of Ratisbon in a position that left it isolated and in danger of being cut off.\n\nDavout knew this. By the 18th of April Charles had figured it out too.\n\nWhat Charles didn't know was exactly where Davout was or where he planned to move. Davout intended to join with Lefebrve's VI Corps of Bavarians near Abensburg by marching along the south bank of the Danube.\n\nBoth armies started moving on the morning of the 19th, but Davout moved sooner and faster. His III Corps was also mostly concentrated into four large columns his vulnerable trains on the good river road, while the infantry and cavalry moved on poorer forest roads inland. Charles was slower off the mark and spread his Corps out in a wide net moving on Ratisbon from the south. He had not figured out where Davout was. Just the same he almost caught him. His westernmost Corps, the Austrian III under Hohenzollern encountered Davout's rear flank between the villages of Teugn and Hausen as the French made their way through the narrow defile between Abbach and Saale on the Danube.\n\nThe French division of St.Hiliare, but also that of Friant and Montbrun's cavalry put up a ferocious fight. Hohenzollern committed what forces he had piecemeal and was outfought by the expert French skirmishers in the largely wooded terrain.\n\nCharles failed to support, apparently because with fighting breaking out along a considerable length of his front (Montbrun's and Friant's work) he failed to discern where the main weight of Davout's Corps was. Not seeing his chance he missed it and Davout managed to get his trains and the unengaged bulk of the French III Corps back in communication with the VI Corps and the rest of the French Army.\n\nThe Austrians lost about 3,800 men.\n\nThe French casualties were about 4,500 men.\n\nIf Charles had been quicker and reached the road along the Danube before Davout, or if he had recognized that the action at Teugn-Hausen represented the flank of Davout's entire escaping Corps he could trapped Davout and with a numerical advantage of close to two to one, against a foe whose supply lines had been cut, he could have expected to at least have administered a severe drubbing. Davout had proven he could fight and win against the odds at Auerstadt, but still the odds would have been against him. Charles missed his best chance of beating the French at Teugn-Hausen.\n\nBoth Napoleon and the Archduke Charles spent the 21st of April badly mistaken about their enemy's positions.\n\nNapoleon thought it was the Austrian main army that he'd defeated at Abensburg and then driven through Landshut. He didn't realize he'd once again left Davout's III Corps to face the major portion of an enemy's strength.\n\nThe Archduke Charles on the other hand thought that Davout's force in the area south of Abbach on the Danube was the main French army. He planned to attack it and decisively defeat it on the 22nd, but given the long distance some of his troops had marched delayed the planned time of attack until early afternoon. If Napoleon had given Charles the time even the formidable Davout would have been in serious trouble.\n\nUnfortunately for the Austrians an emissary from Davout managed to reach Napoleon in the early hours of the 22nd and convince him of the danger Davout's force was in. Napoleon immediately arranged reinforcements for Davout and began to plan a switch of direction for his main army. He would attack north from Landshut with the objective of destroying the Austrian main force under Charles.\n\nThe Austrian forces were deployed in a line that ran roughly north-south. Their south flank lay in the area of Eckmuhl. The northern part of their force was the strongest as Charles hoped to flank the French there. It was the weak southern flank that Napoleon intended to fall upon while Davout kept the Austrians pinned in place to their front.\n\nA strong provisional corps under Lannes was dispatched to lead the attack. Napoleon followed with Massena's corps.\n\nThe Austrians received their first warning around seven or eight in the morning when the first cavarlry clashes occurred. Rosenburg commanding the Austrian IV Corps that constituted most of their south flank heard about these around mid-morning. By mid-day it was clear to him he was facing a major attack from the south. He took precautions and sent word to Charles.\n\nCharles received the notice sometime between one and two in the afternoon just as his offensive against Davout was getting started. He'd been caught badly off guard. His decided that the best he could realistically achieve was a successful withdrawal on Ratisbon. He sent word to most of his forces to begin that retreat. Rosenburg he sent word that he would was on his own and would have to act as rear-guard for the whole army.\n\nRosenburg with his own IVth Corps and that part of the III Corps that hadn't followed Hillier to Landshut had about 18,000 men in all to hold off the the 90,000 men that Napoleon would eventually bring to bear.\n\nBy three in the afternoon the main French attack was underway. By four Eckmuhl was taken and the French were advancing on a wide front. However, despite scarificial last stands by some units and others being cut off and taken prisoner the Austrians mostly managed to withdraw in good order, fighting hard where they needed to.\n\nA huge cavalry clash at Alteglofsheim in the last hours before dark, was another defeat for the Austrians. A defeat that kept the French cavalry from interfering with the rest of Austrian army's retreat.\n\nThe day ended with Charle's Austrians camped immediately south of Ratisbon. They were defeated, mauled, dispirited and disorganized, but not routed. The Austrian Army was still largely intact. During the wee hours of the morning Charles successfully marched it over the Danube using both the Ratisbon bridge and a pontoon bridge he'd had built to the east.\n\nThe French and Allied casualties were about 6,000 men.\n\nThe Austrians lost about 12,000 men.\n\nNapoleon had planned to destroy the main part of the Austrian Army. He had failed to do that. He had defeated the Austrian invasion of Bavaria. He split the Austrian forces into two parts, neither of them in any shape to face his main force which held the central position. The Austrian Armies in Germany, however, were still intact and would fight, and fight hard, in the days to come.\n\nBy mid-May of 1809 Napoleon had taken Vienna on the Danube's south bank and was wondering when and how to cross to the great river's north bank. Somewhere to the north of the Danube lay the main Austrian Army commanded by the Archduke Charles. Napoleon's intention was to bring the Archduke, and the Army he commanded, to battle, to defeat them, and to end the campaign.\n\nAll the normal crossing places were being closely watched by the Austrians. Napoleon looked for other ones.\n\nHe settled on a place a little to the east of Vienna, where the Danube was wider but slower, and where a large wooded island, called Lobau, lay close to the river's north bank. Lobau would serve as a safe staging ground. A French Advance Guard established itself there on May 19th.\n\nBy mid-day on the 20th a bridge to Lobau was complete. Massena's IV Corps began to cross.\n\nThe river's north bank opposite Lobau was dominated by the villages of Aspern and Essling. Both were composed of stone houses surrounded by stone walls and ditches. Both had buildings that would serve as strongpoints. Aspern to the west was the larger village and had a church and a walled cemetary on its west side. Essling had a large granary with thick walls on its north side. A road and ditch lay along the line joining the villages.\n\nThe French bridge over the Danube broke during the night of the 20th and 21st. Still by the morning of the 21st Massena had managed to get three of his four infantry divisions across. Molitor's division was holding Aspern with Legrand's in support. Boudet's division was holding Essling. Marshal Lannes took command of Essling's defense so that Massena could concentrate on Aspern. The area between the villages was held by cavalry. Lasalle's Light Cavalry Division had crossed the day before. Marulaz's Light Cavalry Brigade and d'Espagne's Heavy Cavalry Division had crossed first thing in the morning over the newly repaired bridge. Napoleon was planning on the pursuit of a retreating enemy.\n\nThe Austrians, in fact, had been marching most of the night in order to be in place to attack. They intended to launch a massive four Corps, five columns converging atttack on the French bridgehead.\n\nIn the event it wasn't until early afternoon that the French first saw the attacking Austrian columns, and it was almost three before the first serious attacks were made. By 4:30pm the Austrian's had taken the church and cemetary at Aspern and most of the rest of the village. Molitar had lost about half his men in the process. French reinforcements from Legrand's division forced the Austrian's back and for the next couple of hours control of the village passed back and forth in a vicious see-saw. Finally the arrival of Massena's fourth division under St.Cyr managed to stabilize the situation with the French controlling part of Aspern and the Austrians the rest.\n\nThe Austrian attacks on Essling were ill-coordinated and much later the last one not going until 9:00pm and fighting continued until around 11:00pm. As at Aspern they had only partial success after heavy fighting that cost both sides heavily.\n\nThe French had only had limited reinforcements during the day because of breaks to their bridge, during the night of the 21st/22nd they got the Guard and the the three infantry divisions of the II Corps across more than doubling their infantry strength. Napoleon prepared to cross over III Corps as soon room had been made to deploy it.\n\nThe fighting, as intense and vicious as before, started up again around 4:00am, by 7:00am the French held both villages. The three divisions of Lanne's II Corps, their flanks secured, attacked in the center. The Austrians, however, supported by their superior artillery held, by 9:00am Lannes attack had stalled. The bridge failed again removing any chance of reinforcements and by mid-day the French had been forced back to line between Aspern and Essling. By 1:00pm the Austrians held Aspern again despite part of the Young Guard having been committed there. By 3:00pm the Austrians had managed to retake Essling only to be pushed again by a counter-attack of the Guard.\n\nBoth the Austrian's and the French decided they'd had enough. Napoleon began to organize a retreat to Lobau and Charles settled for harassing the French with a massive artillery bombardment.\n\nThe French and Allied casualties were about 23,000 men.\n\nThe Austrians also lost about 23,000 men.\n\nTruth is the first casualty of war. Both sides lied about Aspern-Essling, the French claiming a minor setback caused by the flooding of the Danube and only admitting to at most a fifth of their true losses, and the Austrians claiming they'd destroyed the entire French army under Napoleon.\n\nIn fact it'd been a severe blood letting for both sides. The Austrians had caught a portion of the French Army across river and mauled it severely, and then repulsed a major attack by some of the best soldiers the French had. A number of French divisions lost half to a third of their strength and officier losses, including Marshal Lannes and several division commanders, were high. On the other hand this had cost the Austrians dearly despite their numerical superiority and they had not managed to out right destroy any portion of the French army let alone all of it.\n\nPolitically Aspern-Essling was a major set-back for Napoleon. It was clear he'd met some sort of repulse, in person, and with heavy losses. The air of invincibility he'd once worn had been diminished.\n\nIn his second attempt to cross the Danube Napoleon again chose to use the island of Lobau. His preparations were this time more careful. He built multiple bridges of improved design and ensured they were properly protected from floating missiles. He greatly increased his artillery using many pieces looted from Austrian stores. He gathered together his full strength calling in significant reinforcements that included Eugene's Army of Italy, Davout's III Corps, and Bernadotte's IX Corps of Saxons.\n\nAlso this time except for a feint by Legrand's division of Massena's Corps, Napoleon attacked from the South-West corner of Lobau not the North-West one.\n\nThe attack began on the night of the 4th July at 11:00pm amidst icy rain, and the thunder of both storm and artillery. It took only five minutes for the French to swing a pre-prepared pontoon bridge over the last stretch of water and for Massena's troops to begin crossing.\n\nBy nine in the morning on July 5th Massena's troops had forced elements of Nordmann's Advance Guard out of Gross Enzersdorf north of the main crossing. By ten the three leading French Corps of Massena, Oudinot and Davout, were deployed on line between Gross Enzersdorf and Wittau covering the crossing of the remainder of the army.\n\nAround two in the afternoon the French began to roll North and West. Massena atacked west, taking Essling by 2:30pm and wresting Aspern from Klenau's VI Corps by 4:30pm. Oudinot and Davout marched north to a line on the Russbach between Wagram and Markgrafneusiedl.\n\nThese movements opened a gap between Massena and Oudinot which was filled by Bernadotte's IX Corps and Eugene's Army of Italy.\n\nBy 6:00pm the entire French army had successfully deployed in a great arc that ran on a line from Aspern north to a point just south of Wagram and then east to Markgrafneusidl.\n\nIt was late but, to the Austrian surprise, Napoleon decided to attack. Despite heavy see-saw fighting near Wagram these late attacks on the 5th failed.\n\nOn the next day, July the 6th, Archduke Charles seized the initative with an attack around 4:00 am in the morning by Rosenberg's Austrian IVth Corps against Davout's French III Corps on the French right near Markgrafneusidl. Rosenburg enjoyed some initial success, but other Austrian attacks that were supposed to be occurring at the same time against the French left, were delayed and Napoleon was able to deploy his reserves to bolster Davout and finally push Rosenburg back.\n\nMeanwhile the delayed Austrian attack on the French left flank was getting underway. It was Charles main effort and he committed four Corps to it, from north to south these were Bellegardes I Corps, Lichtenstein's Reserve Corps, Kollowrat's III Corps, and Klenau's VI Corps. Bellegarde got sucked into a bitter fight for Aderklaa with Bernadotte's and Massena's Corps. Initially he had considerable success routing Bernadotte's Saxons, but Napoleon was able to redeploy his reserves and re-gain the village. Concerned with their flanks Lichtenstein and Kollowrat did not push their Corps beyond a line with Bellegarde's. Klenau VI Corps which faced only Boudet's divison of Massena's Corps enjoyed greater success and had reached Essling by around 09:00 am. The Austrian's were in the French rear but Lobau was no soft target, in fact, the artillery massed there inflicted considerable damage on Klenau.\n\nBack on the French right flank Davout launched a carefully prepared attack on the Austrians near Markgrafneusiedl around 10:00am .\n\nAt about the same time Napoleon sent Massena's Corps, covered by cavalry and Grand Artillery battery, on a march south across face of the Austrian III Corps and Grenadier Reserves to counter-attack Klenau.\n\nWith Massena having pushed back Klenau and Davout making progress on French right the battle the climax of the battle had been reached. Napoleon prepared to crack the Austrian center south of Wagram. He chose MacDonalds Corps of the Army of Italy to make the attack. MacDonald's troops pushed forward in a great hollow oblong, with heavy support from the Guard artillery, they managed to split the Austria army. The cost was very heavy, only 1,500 men of an original 8,000 were left standing.\n\nLearning reinforcements under his brother the Archduke John would not arrive in time, Charles realized he'd lost the battle and began a phased retreat around 2:30pm\n\nThe French and Allied casualties were about 32,000 men killed and wounded, and an additional 7,000 men as prisoners. They lost about 40 guns.\n\nThe Austrians lost about 23,000 men killed and wounded, 7,000 prisoners, and 10,000 men missing many of whom later returned to their units. They lost about 20 guns\n\nWagram was a French victory. After a vigourous French pursuit and further fighting at Znaim the Austrians sued for peace\n\nIt wasn't a victory in the old style though. It wasn't gained by rapid manouver against superior numbers and didn't result in the disintegration of the opposing forces. Napoleon assembled superior numbers of men and guns at Wagram, and he used them in costly, bloody frontal attacks. Despite heavy losses the Austrian army remained intact and retreated in good order.\n\nAlthough it was a French victory, after Wagram the leadership of Europe could envision a day when properly organized forces, superior in numbers, might beat the French in the field.\n\nAdmiral Chichagov had unexpectedly marched from the south and severed Napoleon's supply line by taking Minsk. The Admiral attempted to deny Napoleon the route to the next French depot at Vilna by deploying forces along the Beresina river, the main obstacle lying in the French path. At the same time Wittgenstein's Forces were closing on Napoleon from the north. Kutusov with the main Russian Army trailed Napoleon at a distance. All the Russian generals at this time mistook the large number of French stragglers for effective troops and thus underestimated the numerical advantage they enjoyed. They also retained a healthy respect for French military ability. Napoleon's in particular.\n\nThe Russians held the main crossing of the Beresina at Borisov securely, but Napoleon learned of a possible crossing at the village of Studienka to the north of Borisov and decided to attempt it.\n\nA fient by Oudinot's II Corps succeeded in drawing away the Russian force that had been guarding it and by early afternoon on the 26th two bridges, one for vehicles, had been built and Oudinot was across the river and had secured a bridgehead with his 11,000 men. Oudinot spent the 27th defending that bridgehead.\n\nOn the other side of the river Victor's IX Corps held off Wittgenstein's attacking forces allowing Eugene's IV Corps and Davout's I Corp to cross. By the evening of the 27th non-combatants were being allowed across. By the morning of the 28th Wittgenstein's Russians were within artillery range of the bridges. They broke the larger bridge and worked havoc among the stragglers and non-combatants. A stampede clogged the bridges. Still most of the rear-guard got across on the night of 28th and 29th. At the nine on the morning of the 29th the French burnt their bridges.\n\nThe French losses, especially among the stragglers and non-combatants, had been severe but a signficant portion of Napoleon's Army escaped the Russian trap.\n\nThe French lost about 25,000 effectives, 25 guns, and maybe 30,000 stragglers and refugees.\n\nThe Russians lost about 20,000 men.\n\nSome call the Beresina Crossings an outstanding victory for Napoleon in that he managed to save a significant portion of his army from certain surrender or annilhation, but under any other circumstances the losses the French took at the Beresina would have been considered a horrible disaster.\n\nIn the event many of the rank and file saved died on the bitterly cold road back to Germany and Poland, but Napoleon did manage to preserve a substantial core cadre of officiers and NCO's around which he built new armies. If neither he nor that cadre had made it out of Russia it's hard to see how the Napoleonic Wars could have lasted another three years.\n\nIt was spring and Napoleon had raised a new Army.\n\nIt was the beginning of May to be precise and Napoleon was marching that new army back into Germany, in an attempt to restore the situation there. His Corps were strung out in long columns along the road to Leipzig in central Saxony.\n\nLauriston's V Corps was in the lead approaching Leipzig, MacDonald's XI Corps was next, the Guard was near Lutzen as were three divisions of Ney's five division III Corps. Mormont's VI Corps was marching towards Lutzen on the road from Weissenfels. A few miles south-west of Mormont Bertrand and his IV Corps were marching north-east to right rear of the main army and parallel to its route.\n\nTwo of Ney's divisions, Girand's in Starsiedel south-east of Lutzen and Souham's around Gross-Gorschen south of Lutzen, formed the army's right flank guard.\n\nThe Allies, with Wittgenstein at least nominally in command, had decided to counter attack. They massed south west of Leipzig and then marched north west against the French right flank, towards roughly the middle of the long strung out column the French Army formed. The Allies intended to defeat what they believed to be a weak flank guard south of Lutzen, split the main French army around Lutzen itself, and then in succession engage the French Corps to the east, rolling them up against the Elster river. The defeated French would be trapped by that river.\n\nWittgenstein had planned to launch his attack at 7:00am, but it was almost noon before the initial attack under Blucher went in. Blucher hit Souham in the Gross-Gorschen area and the surprise was mutual. The French surprised at being attacked at all, the Prussians at encountering a whole division. They'd only expected a couple of thousand men.\n\nNapoleon was a few miles away at Markranstadt, roughly half way between Lutzen and Leipzig. He heard the cannon fire from Blucher and Souham's fight and quickly realized what was happening. His reaction and orders were immediate. Ney was to hold, Mormont would form on his left, MacDonald on his right. Bertrand was to flank the Allies on their left, the best part of Lauriston's Corps would flank the Allies on their right.\n\nAround Gross-Gorschen the fighting was vicious, each side feeding in troops for counter-attacks as they arrived. Ney led his divisions that been around Lutzen in the first set of French counter-attacks, then Girard freed by Marmont's arrival at Starsidel was fed in. Still by the time Napoleon arrived, around 2:30pm, Ney's troops were faltering and the situation was critical for the French. By personal intervention and with the help of the Guard, Napoleon managed to stabilize the situation.\n\nThe battle continued to ebb and flow as each side fed in new troops, but by 6:00pm Napoleon was ready to launch his decisive counter-attack. He began by massing a battery of 70 guns, moving it to within canister range of the Allies, and blowing their center out. He committed the Guard as well as the III Corps against the resulting hole. The attack became general as the French attacked all along the line.\n\nDespite being greatly outnumbered and attacked on both flanks the Allies, very much superior in cavalry, managed to withdraw intact.\n\nThe French lost about 20,000 men.\n\nThe Allies lost at least 11,500 men, maybe as many as 20,000.\n\nLutzen was tactically a French victory and showed neither Napoleon nor his new army were to be trifled with. It was not, however, decisive as Napoleon had neither the cavalry nor the hardened hard marching veterans to launch one of the decisive pursuits that used to be his trademark.\n\nBy the 15th of May the advance guard of Napoleon's main army had reached the river Spree near the town of Bautzen, some 60km east of Dresden. The Allies under Wittgenstein had decided to concentrate there.\n\nNey, effectively in command of a second French army of about half the strength of the main one, was concentrating to the north around Luckau about half way to Berlin.\n\nNeither side was clear about what the other was doing, or about their own plans.\n\nIn the event the Allies decided to remain together and to give battle behind the Spree at Bautzen. Napoleon discerning this planned to attack frontally with his main army to pin them, and to bring Ney down from the north to attack the Allied right flank and communications.\n\nUnfortunately for the French Napoleon settled on this plan only after sending Ney orders that meant he wouldn't be able to concentrate his full forces for the projected flank attack and without fully informing Ney of the situation at Bautzen. So Ney thought the Allies were further west on the left bank of the Spree and Napoleon was expecting Ney's full army. Both in error. This confusion was to cost the French dearly.\n\nNey having informed Napoleon that he would arrive in force on the Spree by the 21st, Napoleon duly launched his main attack at noon on the 20th concentrating on the Allied left. Oudinot's attack there with his XII Corps made good progress exacerbating Allied fears for that flank. Later attacks by MacDonald's XI Corps and Mormont's VI Corps to the north also succeeded in pushing the Allies back and gaining footholds on the east bank of the Spree.\n\nThe 20th ended with the main French army, at some cost, having fixed the Allies attention and in good position to continue it's attacks the next day.\n\nThe 21st started early with Allied counter-attacks against Oudinot. This suited Napoleon's plan and he denied the hard-pressed Oudinot the reinforcements he requested.\n\nDespite Oudinot's problems in the south mid-morning (10:00am) saw the French center marking time and Ney with a substantial force and more coming up established on and behind the Allied left flank.\n\nThe Allies were in danger of being flanked and cut-off.\n\nThe question was what would Ney now try to do. He had three basic options. One, attack the rear flank of the Allied forces on the left. Two, move to cut the line of communications (and retreat) for the entire Allied army. Three, attempt to split the difference and his forces and try to do both. Ney chose the third option.\n\nNey has been harshly critized for this ever since. He failed to cut the Allied communications and they managed to escape.\n\nNey certainly seems to have misinterpreted the spirit of the orders he recieved the morning of the 21st, but they were unclear and only the latest of a series of unclear and confused orders he had received from Napoleon's headquarters. In the event seeing the Allied forces still apparently unengaged and defeated it was not unreasonable he should attack them.\n\nNey's attacks and those by the main French army forced an Allied retreat, but the Prussians in the north and the Russians in the south both managed to do so in good order. Ney was not in place, not in time, to stop them.\n\nWithout adequate cavalry or the hard marching veterans of previous years, and without forces astride the Allied line of retreat, Napoleon could not stop them or turn their retreat into a rout.\n\nBautzen was French victory, but a costly and indecisive one.\n\nThe French lost about 20,000 men.\n\nThe Allies lost about 20,000 men.\n\nBautzen was a disappointment for both sides. Napoleon had failed to get the decisive battle of annihilation he believed he needed. Also the battle had revealed significant weaknesses in French fighting power and organization. Napoleon's men were undertrained and exhausted. The Allies had escaped annihilation by a hair's breadth and taken terrible losses of their own. The Russians in particular believed they needed time to rest and reorganize after the strains of the winter of 1812 and the spring of 1813, they wished to fall back towards Poland. The Prussians wanted to defend both Silesia and Berlin. Contemporaries report that the Allied leadership laughed with joy when Napoleon agreed to an armistice on the 2nd of June. Napoleon later admitted it was one of his worst mistakes.\n\nNapoleon had ordered Oudinot to take Berlin. He gave him three infantry corps and a cavalry corps for the task.\n\nBoth of the French commanders underestimated the task they faced. The Prussians were raw, the Swedes unblooded in battle, and Bernadotte was known for his caution, but the French troops were themselves very green, and furthermore most of them not French at all but Italians, Wurttemburgers (2 of the 3 divisions in Bertrand's IV Corps), Saxons (2 of the 3 divisions in Reynier's VII Corps), Bavarians, and Westphalians (2 of the divisions in Oudinots own XII Corps), and, therefore, of doubtful loyalty. Moreover the Russians bolstered their allies with veteran artillery and light cavalry units. So quality wise there was little to chose and the Allies also had rough equivalence in numbers.\n\nThe French had the burden of taking the offensive. Additionally the terrain was difficult being heavily wooded and divided by swamps and water courses, which would prevent easy support between forces taking different roads.\n\nThe record is skimpy, and far from free of bias, but Oudinot does not seem to have done much to address these problems.\n\nHis own attitude was definitely far from optimistic and there is no record of his having taken measures to improve the morale of his units or the coordination between them.\n\nIt is certain that his advance was ill-coordinated each of the Corps advancing by a separate road and out of each other's supporting range. Bertrands IV Corps took the easternmost road on the French right, Reynier's VII Corps took the Center road, and Oudinot's XII Corps took the westernmost road on the French left (as did the cavalry and Oudinot himself).\n\nBertrand's Corps was the first to engage. He spent the most of the morning and early afternoon of the 23rd failing to push the outnumbered Tauenzien (13,000 men and 32 guns) out of Blankenfelde.\n\nReynier in the center managed to take Gross-Beeren against weak resistance in the early afternoon. It was raining heavily and his troops were making supper when Bulow counter-attacked with his full Corps. After initially fighting hard the Saxons holding the town broke and ran taking a division coming up to their aid with them. Reynier covered his retreat with his remaining division. Aid in the form of some cavalry from Oudinot's force arrived too late and the battle petered out with a cavalry skirmish.\n\nImpressed by the numbers and fighting spirit of the Prussians, and doubtful of the reliablity of their Saxon troops, Reynier and Oudinot threw in the towel and retreated back to Wittenburg on the Elbe.\n\nThe French lost about 3,000 men and 13 guns.\n\nThe Allies lost about 1,000 men.\n\nThe immediate consequence of Gross-Beeren was, of course, the collapse of Oudinot's attack on Berlin. It also left the other French forces advancing in Northern Germany out on a limb. Davout managed to get back to Hamburg safely, but the reinforced division under Girard that had been advancing from Magdeberg received a thorough mauling. Gross-Beeren was a major boost to the morale of the still mostly green Prussian soldiers. More broadly the loss of Berlin would have been a servere political set back to the Prussians, and the chances of the Alliance holding together. It would have also been a signficant practical set-back to the Prussian ability to recruit and support armies.\n\nOudinot's troubles, along with those of MacDonald in Silesia, also distracted Napoleon at time when he should have managing the pursuit of the Army of Bohemia after his victory at Dresden. It is likely Gross-Beeren contributed to the disaster that occurred at Kulm.\n\nDresden was the last major depot in Napoleon's line of communications and full of supplies. St.Cyr and his XIV Corps were charged with its defence while Napoleon pursued Blucher's Army of Silesia.\n\nThis was not what the Allies had expected. They had launched the huge Army of Bohemia through the mountains north towards Leipzig thinking that Napoleon would fall first on the Allied Army of the North, defending Berlin under the command of Bernadotte. They hoped to arrive in Napoleon's rear as he was doing so.\n\nWhen they learned that Napoleon was instead marching into Silesia they decided to convert the Army of Bohemia's attack into a short hook north eastward to Dresden.\n\nThe change of plan resulted in considerable disorganization. The Army of Bohemia had crossed into Saxony on the 22nd; its first elements reached Dresden on the 25th, but much of the allied force remained behind, tangled in forests and on mountain roads far to the rear.\n\nShort of their planned strength, facing an active defence from St. Cyr, and being unaware of how heavily they outnumbered him, the Allied leadership hesitated and argued.\n\nThinking Napoleon was still days away Schwartzenberg made the decision to delay his attack until the next day, the 26th.\n\nNapoleon arrived with his Guard close behind early on the 26th.\n\nWhile the Allied leadership argued more, their pre-planned attack went ahead. Napoleon doled out just enough support to St.Cyr's hard pressed troops to stop the Allied attack, inflicting disproportionate casualities on them in the process. That done he counter-attacked with his carefully husbanded reserves. It was a bad day for the Allies.\n\nDuring the night Napoleon received the corps of Victor and Marmont as reinforcements. Both sides planned attacks for the 27th, the Allies in the center, the French on both flanks.\n\nIn the event it was the French who prevailed. They crushed the Austrians on the Allied left, they pushed back the Russians and Prussians on the right, only in the center was Napoleon frustrated. He expected another days fighting on the 28th would be necessary to reach his goals there.\n\nUnbeknownst to him he had killed his former rival Moreau with a cannonball there, only narrowly missing the Czar in the process. This may have taken a lot of the heart out of the the Allied resolve. The Allies broke contact and began to withdraw during the night.\n\nThe French lost about 10,000 men.\n\nThe Allies lost about 38,000 men and 26 guns.\n\nDresden was a severe blow to the main Allied army and the morale of the Allied leadership. Properly followed up it might had led to the Army of Bohemia's destruction. It showed that the French under Napoleon even outnumbered were still a force to be feared.\n\nAfter Oudinot's failure Ney was appointed to command the Army of Berlin, mainly consisting as before of Oudinot's XII Corps, Reynier's VII Corps and Bertrand's IVth Corps.\n\nNapoleon ordered Ney to attack Berlin and promised to be there in person with an additional Corps, in the event Napoleon had to put out fires to the south, and Ney had to attack on his own with what he had.\n\nAmazingly the French again underestimated their opponents, moved widely separated, and failed to support each other. This time they came up against Prussian resistance in the area of Dennewitz some 65 kilometers south-west of Berlin in an open sandy area. They blamed heavy wind and blowing sand and dust for their being unable to see what was happening on the whole battlefield.\n\nIt was Bertrand's IVth Corps and Tauentzien's Prussian Corps that clashed first near Dennewitz. Bertrand attacked around 11:00am. Initially the French got the better of it, pushing the Prussians back north west to the area around Nieder Gorsdorf, but then Bulow's Corps arrived.\n\nBulow arrived around 12:30 on Bertrand's left (southern) flank and by 2:00pm had all but beaten Bertrand when Reynier turned up with most of his Corps on Bulow's southern flank\n\nAt the cost of exhausting his own troops Reynier in his turn had almost beaten Bulow by between three and four in the afternoon. Oudinot was arriving in his rear and Reynier requested his aid in finishing Bulow. Oudinot refused. This was because of his having received an order from Ney to reinforce Bertrand on the northern flank. Ney was unaware of the situation on the southern end of the battlefield, but Oudinot, nevertheless, obeyed and marched, rather slowly, north.\n\nMost commentators believe this obediance was malicious motivated by Oudinot's resentment at having been replaced by Ney, and that he knew his action would cost the battle. If Oudinot had been a British admiral rather than a French general he would have been shot.\n\nShortly after Oudinot had marched off an Allied attack broke Reynier's troops, neither did Oudinot reach Bertrand in time to save him from defeat. Oudinot's uncommitted troops were then carried away by the retreating soldiers of the other two Corps. Pursued by newly arrived and therefore fresh Swedes and Russians the French Army of Berlin dissolved into rout sometime between five and six in the evening.\n\nThe French lost about 10,000 men.\n\nThe Allies lost about 7,000 men.\n\nThe loss at Dennewitz put paid to Napoleon's hope of taking Berlin and defeating the Allied Army of the North, a smaller army than the Army of Bohemia, a less aggressively commanded one than the Army of Silesia, and the Allied Army the least able to retreat because of the political imperative of holding Berlin. It also put paid to his hope of relieving his garrisons to the east. The disproportionate losses further increased his disadvantage in resources, and of course, Allied morale improved while French morale suffered. So many green soldiers on both sides meant morale was of critical importance as it often had to substitute for discipline and training.\n\nOn October 14th Napoleon ordered his forces to concentrate on Leipzig.\n\nThere were some exceptions, the main one being the two Corps, St.Cyr's XIVth and Lobau's Ist, he left to defend Dresden. This seems to have been a serious mistake; he could have used those Corps at Leipzig. The Allies just masked Dresden with second rate troops and therefore did not lack in proportion.\n\nThe French position, both militarily and politically, had been getting steadily worse. The French soldiers were wasting away from fatigue and illness, they were mostly young and unaccustomed to long marches in bad weather on poor rations. Napoleon's German Allies were deserting him and he was in danger of being cut off from France. He needed a decisive victory. He had to catch one of the Allied armies and beat it throughly.\n\nNapoleon had spent August and September based on Dresden trying to catch either Schwartzenberg's Army of Bohemia or Blucher's Army of Silesia. Both had eluded him. Dresden had almost been the victory needed, but the defeats at Gross-Beeren and Katzbach had distracted him, and Kulm had saved the Allies.\n\nThe first half of October saw him turning north and trying to catch Blucher or Bernadotte, but they had, just barely, eluded him too, ignoring his threat to cut them off from Berlin.\n\nLeipzig was Napoleon's last chance. His plan was for Ney to hold Leipzig and an area north and east of it, while he turned south with the balance of his forces and defeated the Army of Bohemia. He would pin the Allies in their center around Wachau, flank them on their right, and then once the Allied reserves were committed defending their flank, commit his own reserves to break through in the center. He expected to be able to draw troops from Ney's force for both the flank attack and the final center attack.\n\nNapoleon was convinced that Bernadotte would not move at all and that Blucher was to the west of the city and could not threaten it from the north until the 17th. He intended to win his decisive victory on the 16th. Ney ought to have troops to spare.\n\nThe Allied planning process was a little more complicated than that of the French. Schwartzenburg was in nominal command. His original plan was that Gyulai's Austrian Corps, and Blucher's Prussians would launch a diversionary attack on Lindenau, the western exit from Leipzig. Most of the Austrian forces and the Allied reserves would attack between the rivers Elster and Pleisse due south of Leipzig and Kliest's, Eugen's and Klenau's Corps would attack from a line east of the Pliesse centered on Wachau. This plan would have probably ended with Napoleon annihilating the eastern forces under Kliest, Eugen and Klenau. The rest of the Austrians would likely have retreated in the face of such a disaster leaving Napoleon free to mop up Blucher and Bernadotte.\n\nLeipzig might have gone down in history as the later day counterpart to Austerlitz, where an overstretched Napoleon baited his foe into a trap, and then inflicted a decisive defeat. Of course, neither the French nor the Allies were the same as they'd been eight years earlier so perhaps the result would have been different. In any case, we'll never know because Czar Alexander intervened and insisted that the forces east of the Pleisse be reinforced. In particular, he positioned his reserves to be able to help there. Additionally Blucher got leave to attack Leipzig from the north rather than the west where he would have been easily contained.\n\nThe Allies attacked first, around 0800 on the 16th with Kliest's Prussians storming Markkleeberg on the left of their line, and Eugen's Russians Wachau in the center. Gortschakoff's Russians on the center right were held up waiting for Klenau's large Corps of Austrians to get into place on the Allied far right. An Austrian attack under Meerveldt across the Pleisse against the refused French right wing under Powiatowski took heavy losses for little gain.\n\nDespite their initial success by 0930 Kliest and Eugen were stalled and taking heavy losses as Napoleon moved the corps of Mortier, Oudinot and Augereau forward to bolster his line. He massed his artillery and pummeled the Allies, Eugen's troops in particular, without mercy. If he'd had the spare troops Napoleon could have launched a counter attack at this point, but MacDonald's and Sebastiani's flanking force was slow arriving. He'd ordered Marmont's excellent corps to his aid, but it counter marched in the north at Ney's orders to meet an attack by Yorck's Corps of Blucher's army at Mockern. This was the attack Napoleon had believed wouldn't happen until the next day. Ney sent Bertrand's Corps instead, but it was diverted to Lindenau to help in holding off Guylai. Finally Souham commanding Ney's old III Corps was ordered south, but even Souham didn't arrive in time to affect the battle around Wachau.\n\nBy mid-morning Eugen had lost Wauchau and Gortschakoff's Corps had been driven off. Alexander ordered his reserves up to support his flagging forces.\n\nBy 1100 Klenau had finally got into the act, but so had MacDonald and Sebastiani and it was the French who gained ground. Napoleon counterattacked all along the line.\n\nThe French pushed the Allies back, but the arrival of Allied reserves and the determination of the Allied infantry, especially Eugen's Russians who took two thirds losses but kept fighting, prevented their victory from being decisive.\n\nIf Alexander hadn't positioned the Allied reserves to be available and then committed them when needed, or if one of Marmont's, Bertrand's, or Souham's Corps had been available when needed, or if either of the two Corps at Dresden had been available, then maybe the French might have had the decisive victory they needed. But none of those things were so, and strategically Napoleon had failed. All that remained was to see what he could salvage.\n\nThe 17th was a day of mostly inaction. The 18th saw great drama and savage fighting as the Allies now including the armies of Bernadotte and Bennigsen closed in concentrically on the French. The 18th ended with Saxon's having deserted and the French pushed back, but with Bertrand's IVth Corps having opened a line of retreat west from Lindenau to Weissenfels. Napoleon was already moving his trains and forces he could spare out of Leipzig through Lindenau.\n\nDuring the night, a couple of hours into the 19th, the main French fighting formations started withdrawing. Napoleon almost succeeded in extracting his army intact, but around 0700 a single bridge on the causeway to Lindenau was blown prematurely.\n\nIts single line of retreat broken his rearguard was trapped. In excess of two entire Corps, including many senior officers, were taken prisoner.\n\nThe French lost about 73,000 men about 30,000 prisoners on last day, plus about 300 guns and most of their supply train.\n\nThe Allies lost about 54,000 men.\n\nLeipzig marked the destruction of the second great French army in as many years. It sealed the loss of Germany, and left little for the defense of France itself. A less self confident leader than Napoleon would have negotiated for the best peace he could get at this point."
