        "text": "Uniforms of French infantry.\n\nUniforms worn during the Napoleonic Wars can be considered as works of art\n\non their own right. They represent the most elaborate display of pomp in the\n\nwhole history of military dress.\n\nOf course even the most dressed-up regiment might look somewhat sloppy today.\n\nIt had no dry cleaning, steam pressing, or detergents to keep it spotless,\n\ncreased, and sharp enough for a modern sergeant's approval.\n\n.\n\nAccording to wikipedia \"Uniform dress became the norm with the adoption of regimental systems, initially by the French army in the mid 17th century.\" Military fashion has a long history. The regalia of an army says a lot about its nation, its history and its approach to war. Military headgear has evolved dramatically through the years, varying from decade to decade. During the Napoleonic Wars the French infantry wore beatiful outfits and the contemporary observers regarded their uniforms with unreserved astonishment.\n\nThe jacket, undercoat\n\nand leather belts.\n\nThe distinction between various armies normally lay in colours of their coats. (Note: within each army diffent regiments were usually distinguished by \"facings\" - linings, turnbacks, and braiding on coats in colours that were distinctive to one or several regiments.)\n\nThe French napoleonic infantry wore dark blue jackets with red collars and cuffs piped white (yellow collars for voltigeurs). The light infantry also wore dark blue jackets with red collars (yellow for voltigeurs). Their cuffs however were not red but dark blue.\n\nThe undercoat of line infantry was white linen. For the light infantry the undercoat was white linen in summer and blue wool in winter. The white woolen undercoat was treated with chalk, which was said to have \"burned\" (br√ªl√©) the cloth. If battle was fought on a very hot day, some soldiers wore only the undercoat, without the jacket.\n\nAnother item of infantryman's outfit were the white leather crossbelts. Actually the natural color of the leather belts was buff, but they were whitened with pipeclay. One white leather belt went over the left shoulder to support the cartridge box on the right hip. Other white leather belt supported the infantry saber. If the sabers were not issued to some troops, like for example the fusilier companies, or the chasseur companies after 1812, they wore only one belt. Officers wore no crossbelts.\n\nIn 1806 as a result of the British naval blockade there was a shortage of indigo used for dyeing cloth. Napoleon ordered the introduction of a white uniform for his line infantry. According to Decree of April 25th 1806 the following regiments of line infantry were assigned white coats: 3rd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 21st, 22nd, 24th, 25th, 27th, 28th, 32nd, 33rd, 34th and 36th Line. (Journal Militaire Vol I 1806, pp 176-178)\n\nThe next decree mentioned all line regiments. Napoleon expressed his disapproval and only 18 of the 112 regiments were issued with these. This is said that it happened after he saw bloodstained white uniforms at Eylau. But to me this reason sounds a little bit strange. The battle at Eylau was fought on a snowy, winter day, and soldier wore the warm and long greatcoat. Thus the blood stains would be visible on the greatcoat, and not on the white coat worn underneath. Secondly, white uniforms didn't bother the Austrians, they wore them all the time. It didn't bother the Saxons neither. I guess the white uniforms reminded Napoleon the old regime of previous century and therefore he disapproved it. In 1807 the importing of indigo resumed and the dark blue coats were reinstated.\n\nIn January 1812 was introduced so-called habit-veste, a coat with even shorter tail (officers' tails were slightly longer). Its white turnbacks bore a blue crowned \"N\" for fusiliers, red grenade for grenadiers and yellow horn for voltigeurs. This coat - in my opinion - is the most beautiful, the most elegant of all infantry uniforms of Napoleonic era. The white (dark blue for light infantry) \"plastron\" - style lapels were piped red (white for light infantry). The cuffs were red piped white. Major Bardin was responsible for the design of this coat and for this reason this is known under \"Bardin uniform\" in western literature.\n\nBicorns.\n\nThe bicorn hats (see picture -->) were worn throughout the Revolutionary Wars and during the early Empire. The bicorns were lightweight and comfortable to wear. The soldiers liked them. The French infantry wore them during the famous Austerlitz Campaign in 1805, and the Jena Campaign in 1806. The fusiliers distinguished themselves with blue or green pompon attached to the hat, while the red pompon was for the grenadiers.\n\nBearskins.\n\nThe bearskins (some were made of goatskin) were re-introduced in 1789. They were worn only by some grenadiers (and carabiniers in light infantry). The soldiers liked the bearskin because it was a comfortable wear. It gave better protection against saber blow than the bicorn hat. The bearskin was more difficult to cut through than shako and had better padding than the helmet. But it was rather expensive. One of the innovations introduced in 1792 was the replacement of bearskin by the bicorn hat during campaign, march etc. while the bearskin was carried in a black waxed cloth. The bearskin suppose to last for 6 years.\n\nThe bearskin was quite tall fur cap. According to the Decree of 1801:\n\n- bearskin of grenadier (line infantry) was 37.9 cm tall as measured in front\n\n- bearskin of foot carabinier (light infantry) was 29.8 cm tall\n\n- bearsksin of horse grenadier of the Guard was 31,8 cm tall\n\nAccording to Bardin Regulations issued in 1812 the\n\nbearskin of Guard foot chasseur was 35 cm tall\n\nTo the bearskin were attached red plume and white cords. The white cords were officially replaced with red but the white were more usual. The grenadier bearskin had a brass plate embossed with a flaming grenade. On some plates was regimental number. The carabinier bearskin was plateless. (see picture -->). There were also grenadier bearskins without plates, even in the Old Guard in 1815. The official specification however called for the brass plate for the grenadiers.\n\nAccording to L Rousselot, in 1804 the bearskins were sometimes given as reward to distinguished line regiments but also to those who simply required them. In July 1805 the carabiniers of light infantry regiments were ordered to return their bearskins to regimental depots in preparation \"for the coming campaign\" and adopt shakos instead.\n\nAt Friedland in 1807 \"A shell caused a huge explosion when it hit one of Oudinot's artillery caissons, wiping out a file of Coehorn's grenadiers. The ever practical Oudinot ordered his servant to collect all the bearskins.\" (Arnold - \"Napoleon's Triumph\")\n\nBusbies/colpacks.\n\nThe shorter fur caps called busbies, or colpacks, became popular in light infantry. For example in 1806-07 some foot carabiniers wore them. By 1809 many voltigeurs adopted them, for example voltigeurs of 10th Light Regiment and voltigeurs in Oudinot's elite division. During the 1806 and 1807 campaigns some of the carabiniers wore bearskins with red cords and plumes. In 1811 several light regiments retained the bearskins for their carabiniers, while other regiments had their carabiniers in busbies or shakos.\n\nThe official end of bearskins and colpacks.\n\nThe Bardin Regulations issued in February 1812 introduced many changes. For example the bearskins and the busbies/colpacks were officially discontinued due to shortage of bear furs. The grenadiers of line infantry and carabiniers of light infantry were ordered to adopt shakos with red shevrons and red upper/lower bands. Few infantry regiments, however, incl. the 46th Line Infantry, kept their grenadiers in bearskins until 1814. These were without cords and plumes and many were without front plates. Few light outfits also kept their bearskins.\n\nShakos.\n\nIn early 1800s was introduced a tall, cylindrical cap called shako. The shako was heavier and not so comfortable to wear as was the bicorn. However it was taller and looked more elegant. The word \"shako\" originated from the Hungarian name cs√°k√≥, which was a part of the uniform of Hungarian hussars. Soon the shako became the standard military headress of most regiments in nearly all European armies. It retained this dominant position until the mid 19th century.\n\nOfficially the shako for the French infantry was authorized in February 1806 and replaced the bicorn by 1807. (In 1804 a shako with red cords was prescribed for the line grenadiers.) \"Present generations who regard the runty vestige of a shako now worn by the West Point cadets as an instrument of torture might be shocked to realize that this new headgear was considered an excellent innovation. Made of heavy felt and leather or entirely of boiled leather, it protected the soldier's skull from saber cuts, gun butts, and dropped chamber pots. Its visor shaded his eyes ....\" (Colonel John Elting - \"Swords Around a Throne\" p 445)\n\nThe French shako was black, had a felt or board body and was widening slightly towards the top. On the front was borned a tricolor cockade above a lozenge shaped brass plate. The top of the shako was waterproofed and had a black leather peak and laces around the top and bottom. Each side of the shako was strengthened by a black leather shevron. Inside of the shako was space for pompon, cloth cover for shako, spoon, tobacco etc.\n\nDuring campaign, and often in combat, the shako was protected waxed linen, oilskin, leather, or, for example, a thin callico waxed with animal fat wax which made them see through black in appearance when on shako.\n\nShako pompons and plumes\n\nOn top of the shako was either a small pompon, or tall plume.\n\nThe tall plumes were liked by Napoleon, in some early fight, he discovered that they magnified his soldiers' appearance and caused the enemy to fire too soon and too high. The soldiers like the plumes during parades. In combat, however, they thought that they attracted too much attention from enemy's artillery and skirmishers. It was also impossible to hide in tall crops and surprise the enemy with a sudden attack. The enemy saw your tall color plumes before you saw him.\n\nThe pompon and plume were in various colors.\n\n- red for the Grenadier Company (Carabinier Company in light infantry)\n\n- dark green for the 1st Fusilier Company (1st Chasseur Company in light infantry)\n\n- sky blue for the 2nd Fusilier Company (2nd Chasseur Company in light infantry)\n\n- orange or pink for the 3rd Fusilier Company (3rd Chasseur Company in light infantry)\n\n- violet for the 4th Fusilier Company (4th Chasseur Company in light infantry)\n\n- yellow for the Voltigeur Company (Voltigeur Company in light infantry)\n\nIn the French infantry there were no battalion identifications on pompons although unoficially solid colored pompon was for all the companies of 1st battalion and pompon with white center was for all the companies of 2nd battalion. In some regiments there was a number in the white center indicating the battalion. Thus red pompon was for grenadiers of 1st battalion, red pompon with white center and number 2 was for grenadiers of 2nd battalion, etc.\n\nIn November 1810 the tall plumes were abolished although still continued to be worn as the clothing departments kept selling them until December 1812. In 1811 it was allowed to wear the plumes only for senior officers. Unofficially the plumes were worn in some regiments by grenadiers and voltigeurs. In few regiments even the fusiliers had their plumes, for example in 3rd Line Infantry it was a blue plume with a red top. More popular than tall plume was the small pompon. In 1812 the plumes were reintroduced for grenadiers and voltigeurs.\n\nShako cords\n\nFor parade and review the braided cords were attached to the shako. If shako was worn in combat the cords were removed. (The cords were worn unofficially in few battles.) The cords were in various colors:\n\n- red for the Grenadier Company (Carabinier Company in light infantry)\n\n- white for the Fusilier Companies (Chasseur Companies in light infantry)\n\n- yellow for the Voltigeur Company (Voltigeur Company in light infantry)\n\nIn November 1810 the braided cords were abolished although still continued to be worn as the clothing departments kept selling them until December 1812. In 1812 another order abolished the cords.\n\nBrass chinscales\n\nIn November 1810 was introduced a slightly taller shako and brass chinscales.\n\nFor parade the brass chinscales were tied over the front of the shako and its pompon.\n\nIn battle the chinscales were tied up under the chin to keep the shako in place during a run or jump.\n\nNew shako of 1812\n\nIn 1812 was introduced a new shako with new plate comprising a crowned eagle atop a semi-circular plate into which the regimental number was cut. The tricolor cocade was partly covered by the eagle's head. Color shevrons (on side of shako) and laces (around the top and bottom of shako) were introduced for the elite companies: red for grenadiers and yellow (or green in few regiments) for voltigeurs. In some regiments however were still used the old shakos without color shevrons for grenadiers and voltigeurs. Such situation was for example in the 8th Line Infantry. Plumes were reintroduced for grenadiers and voltigeurs.\n\nThe shako cords were abolished.\n\nBelow: shakos, pompons, plumes, cords and epaulettes\n\nfor fusilier, voltigeur and grenadier companies\n\n.\n\nBreeches, stockings, and gaiters.\n\nGaiters were necessary to keep peebles and dirt out of the loose and nor very well made shoes. The gaiters of line infantry were above the knee, but many soldiers cut them shorter. The gaiters of the light infantry were below the knee, with tassels swinging from their top centers. The tassels in carabinier company were red. (See picture -->)\n\nThere were three types of the long gaiters for the line: white and black for parade, and grey for long marches. In 1805 General Hulin of the Guard Grenadiers issued the following: \"The Commandant has noticed several soldiers wearing black gaiters on the march and reminds them of the regulations expressly ordering them to wear grey ...\" The black gaiters were for parade. But there were many regiments where the white gaiters were worn for parade in summer, while the black gaiters in winter. The long white gaiters were mentioned only in Clothing Regulation of 1786 and for some time became the standard summer wear. (In following clothing regulations they were never again mentioned and became unofficial, although popular wear. Only the Guard was officially allowed to wear white gaiters.)\n\nIn January 1812 were introduced short, under the knee, black gaiters for all infantry. The new gaiters were worn by the line and light infantry, for parade and in combat. The tassels on the gaitres of light infantry were discontinued.\n\nIn 1812 the line and light infantrymen were also issued short grey gaiters for long marches.\n\nThere were no white gaiters, except for the Old Guard.\n\nThe line infantry breeches were made of white and stretchy woolen cloth. The breeches of light infantry were dark blue (see picture above). The breeches supposed to be long enough to be worn underneath the gaiters but many line infantrymen cut them short, just under the knee and inside the gaiters. The breeches and stockings were given free to soldiers but were worn rarely, usually for parade, review etc. Many soldiers however disliked them. They threw the stockings and breeches away at the first bivauoc or conveniently \"lost\" them during campaign. French officer explains: \"... For this dress a man should be well built, well made ... A man of twenty is not yet formed - nay, we were joined by conscripts who were under nineteen. This accountrement gave them an absolutely silly look\". Especially the men with 'bird-legs' hated the two items.\n\nThere was also another reason. The breeches and stockings (and extra pair of gaiters) were carried in haversack and occupied quite a space. The newly found space in haversack was used for loot and junk collected by soldiers. Lack of gaiters was experienced not only by the French troops, for example in 1796 the Austrian army lacked 49.000 pairs of gaiters !\n\n.\n\nTrousers.\n\nThe army paid for stockings, gaiters and breeches, while the men\n\nhad to pay only for the cheaper (but comfortable) trousers.\n\nThe linen trousers were for campaign in summer, and the woolen ones for winter. They could be worn over the gaiters and breeches. There were also trousers made of canvas (a closely woven and coarse cloth of cotton or linen) or calico. Usually the trousers were undyed, grey, light grey, off-white, beige or blue. Linen could be bleached so that it was really white. The white woolen trousers were in fact yellowish and treated with chalk (which was said to have 'burned' the cloth).\n\nThe French also wore captured trousers or used local supplies to make them. \"The entire village [of Probstheida near Leipzig] was awash with wet, white feathers: the French soldiers' trousers were in such a worn-out state that they had ripped up all the eiderdowns and matresses that they could find in order to use their ticking to make replacements.\" (Digby-Smith \"1813: Leipzig\" p 61)\n\n.\n\nKnapsack.\n\nThe knapsack was made of cow (or goat) skin with the hair on the outside. It contained a lot of personal items from which the soldier had no desire to be separated. The Extrait des reglament provisoure pour le service des troupes en campagne stated that soldiers were not to take off their knapsack when preparing for combat. Sir Charles Oman however reports that the light companies of Darmagnac's infantry division in Peninsula were ordered to remove and stack their knapsacks: \"[D¬íErlon] collected the eight light companies of Darmagnac¬ís division, ordered them to take off and stack their knapsacks, and launched them as a swarm of tirailleurs at the position of the British on the Aretesque knoll.\"\n\n.\n\nGreatcoat.\n\nThe main protection against rain and snow was one's greatcoat. It was popular and comfortable wear and could be worn with or without the jacket underneath. On warm days the jacket was rolled over the packs; but in foul weather, or on night marches, the French soldiers wore both, jackets and greatcoats.\n\nIn the Revolutionary Wars there was little standarization. Many troops wore civilian overcoats, capes and cloaks. Some greatcoats (overcoats) were purchased by individual soldiers, NCOs and officers. There were also quite a few captured greatcoats and greatcoats made from requisitioned cloth in occupied countries. One of the innovations introduced in 1792 was sky-blue greatcoat for officers.\n\nIt was not until 1805 that the were greatcoats issued to the troops. They were purchased from regimental funds. In April 1806 all war battalions (but not the depot, reserve and garrison battalions) received beige, grey, blue and brown greatcoats. The most common was dull beige and it was the official color. (According to Ordannance du 25 Avril 1806: \"La capote ou redingote en drap beige.\")\n\nOnly in 1812, several months before the Invasion of Russia, was made the first real attempt to standarize the greatcoats. According to Article 21 of the Bardin regulations issued in 1812 all greatcoats for the line and light infantry were made of \"beige serge wool.\" There were no distinctions between line and light infantry, and even more, there were no distincions between infantry and artillery. All of them were beige greatcoats.\n\nCarl Vernet in his book about Bardin Regulations gave grey greatcoats for privates and NCOs of the infantry and artillery, and dark blue for officers. According to Knotel during the 1813-14 campaigns many greatcoats of the French line and light infantry bore red patches on collars.\n\nThe second most popular color of the greatcoat was grey.\n\nPs.\n\nThe infantry of Old Guard wore dark blue and the infantry of Young Guard dark-grey greatcoats (some say it was blue-grey, with more grey than blue). In 1815 majority of the Young Guard left on campaign wearing dark grey greatcoats.\n\n.\n\nThe Bardin Uniform, 1812.\n\n\"It is necessary that the military dress don't follow\n\nthe liberties and whims of civilian fashion. Military\n\nstyles are not the same with women fashion.\"\n\nSome colonels were getting too extravagant in their efforts to give their regiments distinctive uniforms, sometimes dipping into their unit mess and fuel funds to meet the extra cost. The Emperor was unhappy with this situation and cut the uniform allowances for 1811. The colonels vigorously protested to the Minister of War who soon pointed out to the Empreror that the army had no complete uniform regulations.\n\nNapoleon promptly set up a committee consisting of Marshal Berthier (Chief-of-Staff of the Army), Marshal Bessieres (Commander of the Imperial Guard), and Generals Walther (Guard Cavalry) and Curial (Guard Infantry) to study and determine the proper uniforms for the French troops.\n\nAnother committee headed by General Bourcier, and consisting of several officers of the Guard, dealt with the necessary details such changes would involve. Colonel Bardin wrote \"It is necessary that the military dress don't follow the liberties and whims of civilian fashion. Military styles are not the same with women fashion.\" The committee's conclusions, embodied in regulations issued in 1812, were generally sensible, emphasizing comfort, economy, simplicity, and uniformity.\n\nThe existing coat was to be replaced by a new coat called habit-veste, which covered the upper part of the body and had tails just long enough to protect the man's rump. Shako plates were to go back to the simple diamond pattern. The fur caps (bearskins and colpacks) were to be replaced with taller shakos with red (yellow for voltigeurs) shevrons and bands. Meanwhile the uniforms on hand had to be used up. The regiments however stretched out that \"wear-out\" period.\n\nThe new uniform regulations were issued in 1812 are commonly referred to as the Bardin Regulations. (Colonel Bardin's 'Regulations in the Fitting out of Soldiers of the French Army', 1812.) The Old and Middle Guard were not affected by the Bardin Regulations as they had their own uniform regulations separate from the army troops.\n\nThe new uniform included several major changes :\n\n- shorter black gaiters, just under the knee, were introduced for the line and light infantry. The breeches were white for line and dark blue for light infantry.\n\n- the elite companies of line and light infantry battalions (grenadiers and carabiniers) were ordered to adopt shakos with red shevrons and red upper and lower bands. No cords.\n\n- the new dark blue coat had shorter coattail, its lapels were extended to the waist, covering the previously exposed waistcoat. The color of the lapel was unchanged, white for line and dark blue for light infantry. The collar and cuffs of infantry were also unchanged and were red, and for voltigeurs yellow.\n\nThe new uniforms were probably issued in 1812 only to Davout's I Army Corps before the invasion of Russia. Koen de Smet wrote: \"The Bardin uniform was introduced in 1812, and some units (or parts of units) will certainly have received it before the Russian campaign. The majority however will still have started the Russian campaign in their old uniforms.\" But this is not certain at all, rather they were not issued in any larger quantity until Spring 1813 and only on the primary theater of war (great battles in Germany: Leipzig, Hanau etc.) French troops on secondary theaters of war, in Italy and Spain, wore the old uniforms.\n\nDifferences between the old and new (1812-15) uniforms.\n\n.\n\nWhat did they wear in combat ?\n\nAccording to Bardin Regulations there were several uniforms for the infantry.\n\nOne was for drill and exercise, one for service, one for march, and one for parade.\n\nTenue d'exercise - white waistcoat, cloth caps called bonnet de police and pokalem\n\ncartridge box, cotton drill trousers, short gaiters, water bottle, etc.\n\nTenue de service - dark blue coat, shako, cartridge box, trousers, short gaiters,\n\nknapsack, water bottle etc.\n\nTenue de route - beige greatcoat worn over the waistcoat, while the dark blue coat\n\nbeing rolled-up and carried on top of the knapsack, shako and cartridge box\n\ncovered in protective cloth, trousers, gaiters, water bottle, haversack etc.\n\nGrande tenue - drak blue coat, beige greatcoat rolled up and on top of knapsack,\n\nshako, cartridge box, wool tricot overalls reaching the ankle worn inside the gaiters,\n\nshort gaiters, water bottle, haversack etc.\n\nSo, what did they wear in combat ?\n\nLong before Napoleon commanders realized the value of the appeareance of their troops. The appearance was intended to impress and intimidate the enemy. For example very often the enemy realized that the Roman legionares got serious because they wore their finest equipmet. (On battlefield the troops were recognized already at 1500 m, the cavalry was distinguished from infantry at 1200 m, and the bigger details of uniforms were distinguished at 600 m. At 225 m officers can be recognized and uniforms seen clearly.)\n\nIn the Napoleonic battles the French soldiers wore the tone-down version of parade uniform. (For a small combat or skirmish it was not worth the hassle). The Emperor wanted to give the soldiers \"the sense of participation in important and a festive occasion.\" According to Fezensac in 1812 at Borodino all the regiments \"had been given orders to put on their parade uniforms.\"\n\nOf course more important than the appearance of the troops was their bravery, discipline and training. In 1809 at Sacile the men of 8th Horse Chasseurs were full of swagger and had bragged about their exploits. They wore in that battle their full dress uniform so as to stand out during the battle. Unfortunately they were routed by Austrian hussars and fled toward the river. It amused the poorly dressed infantry.\n\nDuring campaign, and often in combat, the shako was protected waxed linen, oilskin, leather, or, for example, a thin callico waxed with animal fat wax which made them see through black in appearance when on shako.\n\nEagles, flags, and fanions.\n\n\"When Bonaparte saw passing in front of him the\n\nflags of the 30th, 43rd, and 96th Demi-Brigades,\n\nas these flags did not present any more than a stick\n\nsurmounted with some rags pierced by grapeshot\n\nand blackened by powder, he took off his hat\n\nbowed himself as a sign of respect.\"- St.Hilaire\n\n.\n\nIn the chaos of battle, not least due to the amount of dust and smoke on a battlefield, soldiers needed to be able to determine where their regiment was. The medieval standards developed into the Colours of the infantry and cavalry. Such became the significance in this context that, for a regiment to lose its colours was a disgrace, with the capture of an enemy's colours being seen as a great honour. This is why that, whenever the colours are paraded, they are always escorted by armed guards and paid the highest compliments by all soldiers and officers.\n\n\"A month after being proclaimed Emperor in May 1804, Napoleon decided on the emblem of Empire. He considered the cock and the lion but rejected both in favour of an eagle with wings spread. It became the design of the Great Seal of State and the emblem of the army and navy. In the army the Eagle would be carried on top of a pole with a standard underneath. The Eagle was the supreme importance. When writing on the subject to Marechal Berthier he stressed that it was the priceless symbol of France and the Empire, while the standard below it was of lesser importance and could be replaced if necessary.\" (Adkin - \"The Waterloo Companion\" p 200)\n\nThe Eagle was carried with the 2nd Fusilier Company of I Battalion in every line and light infantry regiment. (One would expect that the elite grenadiers, or voltigeurs, and not the lowly fusiliers, carried the eagle. It was not however the best idea. The grenadiers were the ones who got the most frequently into the most dangerous situations. Thus the Grenadier Company was not a safe place for the eagle. The voltigeurs often fought in skirmish formation, and in the woods and villages. The long and thin skirmish line is the worst place for the eagle with flag.)\n\n.\n\nFlag (drapeau) and eagle in 1804-11\n\nBattles: Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, Auerstadt,\n\nEylau, Heilsberg, Friedland, Wagram\n\nWith the establishment of the Empire in 1804, the regiments were presented with a new flag (drapeau) for every battalion. The flag was lavishly braided, bearing the regimental number within a laurel wreath, the diamond inscribed in gold lettering. Theoretically during campaign the flag was removed.\n\nIn September 1806 it was ordered that regiments of light infantry should hand in all their Eagles at the beginning of a campaign. It should be kept in depots. But some regiments carried their Eagles until 1814 and even one regiment lost its Eagle in battle in that year.\n\nIn 1808 was issued order that only one Eagle was to be carried by the regiment (newly formed regiments were given only one Eagle). The Eagles and flags of other battalions and squadrons were to be returned to regimental depots. It took several years before the order was implemented. In 1811 some 2nd and 3rd battalions still had their colors in the field.\n\nIn 1808-15 the Eagle-bearer (Porte-Aigle) was accompanied by 2 escorts (2nd me & 3eme Porte-Aigle) in the rank of NCOs and carried halberds. Triangular pennons (61cm x 20cm) were attached to the halberds, red for that to the right and white to the left of the Eagle-bearer.\n\nIn 1811 the rank of Eagle-bearer (Porte-Aigle) was oficially introduced. He was an officer of proven valour and at least 10 years service or 4 campaigns of Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena and Friedland. The guards, 2nd and 3rd Eagle-bearers, were sergeants who were paid as sergeant majors - this was a way of rewarding brave and seasoned NCOs who could not aspire to the rank of officer (or simply saying they were too stupid). The 2nd and 3rd Eagle-bearer were not the jalonneurs of the battalion. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Eagle-bearer were armed with a short saber and pistols. There were also 6 fourriers (drawn from companies).\n\n.\n\n1812-14\n\nSmolensk, Borodino, Berezina,\n\nDresden, Leipzig, Paris.\n\nIn April 1812 was ordered that each regiment of light and line infantry will receive a new tricolor pattern flag, which bore on the reverse the battle honors of the regiment. The battle honors were restricted to battles at which Napoleon had commanded in person. The flag looked really impressive. The Old Guard regiments, however, kept its old 1804 pattern standards until 1813.\n\nIn 1812 the infantry regiment had only one Eagle and one tri-color flag.\n\nThe battalions carried fanions.\n\nFanion was a small flag; the equivalent of an American guidon. The napoleonic fanions were usually decorated with a hunting horns (see picture left), bursting grenades, Ns, and whatever else. They were useful for rallying troops in combat and to guide them during parades. In 1812 some, not all, infantry regiments left their Eagles in depots and went to Russia with fanions only. The colors of the fanions were red, royal blue, green, yellow, and white.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion carried the white fanion\n\nfor the 3rd - was red fanion\n\nfor the 4th - royal blue\n\nfor the 5th - green\n\nfor the 6th - yellow\n\nfor the 7th - violet\n\nfor the 8th - sky blue\n\nThere were also so-called company fanions, or markers. The marker was smaller than the battalion fanions and was mounted on a piece of wood that would fit into a musket barrel. (See picture -->) It supposed to be plain. However the grenadiers used a bursting grenade on theirs and the voltigeurs used a hunting horn. Only the fusiliers kept theirs simple, or relatively simple. The company markers were also used to mark the place of the company in camp.\n\n.\n\n1815\n\nLigny, Waterloo.\n\nThe flag of 1815 was also a tri-color pattern but it lacked almost all the magnificent embroidery of 1804 and 1812 patterns. \"All regiments received new eagles, a number of them after Waterloo. However, there seem to have been no new battalion fanions; some officers felt they would have been very useful as rallying points.\" (Elting - \"Swords Around a Throne\" p 651)\n\nPs.\n\nAfter Waterloo the Bourbons did their best to see that all the napoleonic standards and eagles were destroyed. In some regiments the officers burned the standards before mixing the ashes with wine and drinking them down. The officers of the 2nd Swiss Regiment tore their standard into strips with each officer keeping a piece.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLost eagles.\n\nThe Napoleonic regiments lost\n\nastonishingly small amount of\n\neagles and flags\n\nHaving almost 200 infantry regiments and more than 500 battalions, and being involved in countless battles and combats from Moscow to Madrid, and from Amsterdam to Rome, the French lost astonishingly small amount of eagles and flags. Several examples below.\n\nPicture:\n\nRussian infantry capturing French Eagle and tri-color flag at Eylau in 1807. (See in the bottom right corner.)\n\nAt Mohrungen in January 1807, two battalions of the Russian Yekaterinoslav Grenadiers and two weak battalions of the 5th Jagers engaged two battalions of the famous 9th Light Infantry, the Incomparable, in a bayonet fight. The melee occurred in the village of Pfarrersfeldchen. The Russians killed three eagle bearers, one after another. Russian Adjutant Borodkine grappled with Carabinier Fouquet and tore the flag from his grasp. Among the casualties were a commander of Russian grenadier battalion, and commander of the second battalion of the 9th Light Infantry.\n\nAt Heilsberg in 1807 the 55th Line was attacked by Prussian cavalry and Russian infantry and was overthrown. They also lost their eagle, colonel, and number of officers. The eagle was captured by NCO Anton Antonov of Pernov Musketeers.\n\nPrussian historians claimed that the Prittwitz Hussars captured the Eagle. German artist Knotel even painted a picture showing this moment. There is however no data, no names of Prussian soldiers who captured the Eagle, no nothing to back up this claim.\n\nAt Pultusk in 1806 \"Major-General Kozhin led his (Russian) cuirassiers and two squadrons of the Kargopol Dragoons against the front and left flank of Vedel's columns. ... Kozhin's troopers struck at a time when a snow squall reduced visibility. Consequently, the first the French knew about it was when saber-wielding horsemen appeared in their midst.\n\nCaught out of square, the French suffered terribly. ... The Russians hacked the first battalion of the 88th Ligne to pieces, mortally wounding the unit's commander, and apparently captured its eagle. Lieutenant Voisin valiantly tried to rally the battalion but only some 70 to 80 men responded. The rest had either fallen in combat or fled. ... The 88th Ligne would fight in numerous battles during the Napoleonic Wars. Never again would it suffer such losses.\" (Arnold - \"Crisis in the Snows\" p 159)\n\nThe battle of Eylau was a glory day for the Russian cavalry. The Russian Military Order Cuirassiers (with no armor) captured the eagle of 24th Line Infantry Regiment. James Arnold writes: ¬ìCaptain N.L. Sergueienko led his cuirassier squadron against the 24th Ligne. The 24th Ligne had already suffered severely, but the regiment had a proud reputation and a devoted group of grenadiers refused to yield.\n\nThey formed around the eagle of the regiment¬ís third battalion and tried to defend themselves with their bayonets. The cuirassiers methodically hacked them down. A cuirassier trooper drove his horse toward the eagle bearer and cut him down just before his wounded horse collapsed. The dismounted trooper valiantly continued to contest and seized the trophy. He handed the eagle to Captain Sergueienko, who by now was also wounded. Sergueienko preserved the eagle while the cuirassiers slaughtered the fleeing French soldiers.¬î (Arnold ¬ñ ¬ìCrisis in the snows¬î p. 295)\n\nNear Eylau in 1807, the French 46th Line Infantry marched in snow while being fired upon by the Russian artillery and skirmishers. It didn¬ít stop them from crossing their bayonets with the Russian infantry and the famous 18th Line (nicknamed \"The Brave\") hurried to support their comrades. Meanwhile the S.Petersburg Dragoons moved around own infantry and began deploying into charge. The 18th Line suddenly saw a dark mass of cavalry coming at them and leaving no time for forming the square. The French infantry wavered and fired. The dragoons attacked from the front and from the rear and the infantry lost any order. A desperate struggle was around the French standard.\n\nTrooper Podvorotny drove the French standard-bearer to the ground and seized the Eagle. Trooper Deriagin and others cut down the escort of the standard, Adjutant Fomine, dragoon Erofeiev and trumpeter Logvinov were also involved in this bloody struggle.\n\nMarshal Soult¬ís Journal of the IV Corps: ¬ìThe 18th Regiment was near to arriving at the summit, when a large body of enemy cavalry surrounded it, charged it, repulsed it.¬î Colonel Langlois wrote that General Lavasseur, all the senior officers, as well as large number of officers and soldiers of this regiment were seriously wounded and, the worst of all, the Eagle was lost. The damage was indeed enormous: 44 officers killed, wounded and captured as prisoners - including Lavasseur, Ravier and Pelleport. The 18e also lost more than 500 other ranks, including several hundred prisoners. The situation could develop into a slaughter if not the charge by the 13e Chasseurs who saved the 18e Ligne. This regiment was so shaken that it was kept in reserve when the Battle of Eylau was fought. The losses of the dragoons were only 20 men killed and 18 wounded. The French army Bulletin dated 9 Feb. 1807 tried to downplay the loss of the regiment¬ís Eagle and the Emperor ordered that the 18th Ligne be given replacement eagle.\n\nAt Eylau ¬ìThe 44th Ligne and 16th Legere frantically tried to form square. Three sides managed to form but it was too late. The Russians poured through the open, fourth side and began the slaughter. The next day, neatly arrayed bodies two and three ranks deep would clearly delineate where the French had tried to complete their squares. Caught out of formation, unable to use their weapons to defend themselves, the survivors broke and fled. Russian hussars and dragoons plunged their swords into the exposed backs of the fleeing French.\n\nA cannon ball broke the staff of one of the 44th Ligne¬ís eagles. Before the eagle bearer could pick up the eagle, a canister round struck him in the chest. As he staggered, a Russian dragoon slashed him across the head causing him to lose consciousness. The St. Petersburg Dragoons added to the luster they had earned the previous day by capturing the eagle.¬î ( Arnold ¬ñ ¬ìCrisis in the snows¬î p. 292)\n\nIn 1815 at Waterloo (battle of Belle Alliance for the Prussians, and Mont St Jean for the French), two of the French regimental eagles were captured by British heavy cavalry The Royal Dragoons captured the Eagle of the 105th Line and the Scots Greys captured the Eagle of the 45th Line.\n\nFor more information on this matter read an interesting article \"The Royal Scots Greys at Waterloo : Did it really happen this way ?\" from Napoleonic Historical Society >> (ext. link)\n\nBelow is a description of fighting for the eagle at Friedland in 1807. \"The Eight Division infantry waited impassively as the French movement continued. Then, without firing, Major-General grigory Engelhardt's Brigade made a spirited bayonet charge. Engelhardt had suffered a leg wound at Eylau. Here he was struck by canister in left thigh, stomach, and left hand. Undaunted, his Schlusselburg Musketeers hit the French hard.\n\nDokhturov supported Engelhardt with his own Seventh Division, which included the vaunted Ekaterinoslav Grenadiers. Russian grenadiers, short swords in their hand, muskets slung on their shoulders, charged the 15th Ligne. A ferocious hand-to-hand combat ensued with both sides taking frightful losses. Colonel Hilaire Reynaud was hit in the leg.\n\nThirty- nine other officers were killed or wounded. After two eagle bearers were struck down, Adjutant-major Aran picked up the staff only to fall dead when a cannonball hit him.\n\nThe Russian attack broke the 15th Ligne.\n\nAs the regiment's second battalion routed, the standard-bearer rallied his comrades by shaming them with the words, 'Don't go faster than your regimental color !' The 15th Ligne endured more casualties than any other French regiment this day, losing 213 killed and 739 wounded. Compounding the regiment's misery was the loss of an eagle to the soldiers of the Schlusselburg Musketeers.\"\n\nDokhturov's attack staggered Dupas's Division. In an effort to recover, intrepid individuals risked all to inspire their units. Fusilier Lallebingue, a soldier in the Paris Regiment, urged his comrades on by repeatedly shouting 'Charge !' His unit was at such close quarters with the enemy that a Russian grenadier shouted, 'If you are so brave, come on, don't fire, we will resolve this with the bayonet.' Lallebingue accepted the challenge and killed his foe in a bayonet duel.\" (Arnold - \"Napoleon's Triumph\" pp 214)\n\nAt Austerlitz the Russian Guard cavalry captured flag of 4th Line Infantry Regiment.\n\n(This infuriated Napoleon, because his brother Joseph, was the chef of this regiment.)\n\nIn 1813 at Plagwitz, the Russian 28th Jager Regiment captured Color of the 146th Line Regiment.\n\nIn August 1813 at Lowenburg the 28th Jagers captured Color of 148th Line Regiment.\n\nIn 1812 at Krasne, the Russian Poltava Infantry Regiment captured Color of 35th Line Regiment.\n\nThe Russian Pernau Infantry Regiment captured French (battalion ?) color in 1807 at Heilsberg.\n\nAt Eylau they captured another trophy, battalion color of French 55th Line Infantry Regiment.\n\nIn 1807 at Friedland the Pernau Infantry Regiment captured battalion Color of the 69th Line.\n\nIn 1805 at Durenstein the Moscow Infantry Regiment defeated the French 100th Line Infantry.\n\nThe French lost 100 men, 1 Color and 1 Eagle. In the same year they also captured the color of 103rd.\n\nIn 1812 at Krasne, the 18th Line again lost its eagle and was ¬ìvirtually destroyed¬î by the Russian Lifeguard Uhlans.\n\nThere were of course more French colors and eagles captured by the Prussian and Austrian troops, and by the British during the Peninsular Campaign. We gave only several examples.\n\nPS.\n\nThe French however were not push-overs. During the Jena Campaign in 1806 the French captured some 340 Prussian colours. At Austerlitz in 1806 alone they took 50 Colors from the Allies ! At Eylau 16 Colors. etc. Even in the last campaign, in 1815, at Quatre Bras and Waterloo, the French captured several enemy's colors. John Elting writes, \"Amazingly, at Waterloo the French had lost only 2 eagles, and those early in the battle to English cavalry.\" By contrast, they had taken either 4 or 6 colors - the number naturally is much disputed - from Wellington's army.\"\n\n.\n\nBurning the flags during the retreat from Russia in fall and winter of 1812.\n\nPicture by Wojciech Kossak.\n\n\"The French infantry was indisputably the finest in Europe in 1805,\n\nand perhaps even the finest infantry fielded throughout the wars\n\nof 1792-1815.\" (Goetz - \"1805: Austerlitz\" p 45)\n\n.\n\nThe infantry Napoleon commanded in 1790s was different from the infantry of the Grande Armee of the 1800s. There was no uniformity and stability. The infantry of the Revolutionary Army had been formed from a hodgepodge of different units, and as such did not have a uniform appearance. Some wore white uniforms and tarleton helmets of the old Royal Army while others served in their blue jackets, or dressed in civilian clothes with only the red phrygian cap and the tricolour cockade to identify them as soldiers. Furthermore, many men lacked weapons and ammunition.\n\nIn the core of their tactics was the use of skirmishers. The large swarm of skirmishers would hide from enemies if possible, and pepper their formations with fire. Unable to retaliate on them, the morale of the better trained and equipped enemy armies was gradually worn down. The harassing fire usually resulted in a section of the enemy line wavering, and then the 'regular' formations would be sent into the attack.\n\nIn the beginning of the French Revolution, the newly raised French infantry, composed of demoralized regulars and poorly trained volunteers, refused to face the disciplined Austrian troops (see picture left) and were more dangerous to their own officers than to the enemy.\n\nThe victory at Valmy in September 1792 stimulated the French morale, then the Jacobin fanatics infused the French soldiers with something of their own demonic energy. Untrained but enthusistic volunteers filled the ranks. In the spirit of liberty and equality, the volunteers elected their officers, and discipline all but disappeared. Then came the young General Napoleon Bonaparte. He got the command of troops in Italy and imnediately stiffened discipline. He won battle after battle and the troops loved him. (Of the French Republic's 13 field armies, the army in Italy was the most neglected. It was in horrible condition when Bonaparte arrived. The infantrymen were chronically unpaid and short of everything: uniforms, shoes, greatcoats, bayonets, ammunition etc.)\n\nAt Montenotte (12 April 1796) the infantry fought hard. At a critical moment when the French troops were wavering under the attack from the Croats, Colonel Antoine-Guillaume Rampon (on picture -->) rallied them by making them swear to \"conquer or die\".\n\nOn the next day in the morning Napoleon Bonaparte's infantry led by Generals Massena na Laharpe crushed the Austrians. By 9:30 AM the battle was over. Bonaparte lost 880 killed, wounded, and missing, while the enemy suffered up to 2.500 casualties.\n\nThe infantry performed great at Lodi. The battle was raging for several hours when out of the smoke, straight across the very long bridge, roared 3,000 infantrymen. They got to the center of the bridge before the Austrians opened musket fire and smashed the front ranks into a tangle of killed and wounded. Red-bearded Major Dupas shouted the men on, while General Berthier seized a flag and went forward. The infantrymen rushed forward with outstretched bayonets.\n\nThey advanced with their hats down over their eyes, just as if advancing against a hailstorm. The Austrians' counter-attack was magnificent. The whitecoats pushed the French all the way back toward the river. French cavalry regiment then swam below Lodi and hit the Austrians left. Mass√©na's and Augereau's infantry poured through Lodi and joined the fight. The Austrians had enough and retired. Bonaparte lost 1,000-2,000 killed and wounded, while the suffered 2,000 casualties. Bonaparte would say that \"it was Lodi that made him certain he could be a man of high destiny.\"\n\nThe Battle of Arcole (15¬ñ17 November 1796) saw a bold manoeuvre by Bonaparte to outflank the Austrian army and cut its line of retreat. During the battle Bonaparte with his infantry made several attacks on the bridge but was repulsed each time, and at one moment he almost drowned while leading yet another attack with tricolor in hand.\n\nThe battle of Arcole have become a part of Napoleonic legend. The infantry in general performed very well. But it was a tough day for some regiments, including the 51st Line. The historian of the regiment wrote \"Taken aback by the greatness of the danger, and influenced by the disastrous example of the other demi-brigades, the rest of the battalions suddenly fell back onto the slope of the causeway, and were soon mixed up with the rest of the division. Some enemy sharpshooters overlooked this slope and killed many of our men.\n\nWe stayed there without taking a step forward or backwards, getting ourselves killed to no purpose. Nothing was capable of making the troops make a new attempt and advance on the enemy again ...\"\n\nFor more information on the 51st Line and other units at Arcola click here.\n\nThe first day of battle of Arcola Bridge.\n\nThe battle of Rivoli (14¬ñ15 January 1797) was the most comprehensive of Bonaparte's victories in Italy during his campaign of 1796-97. In two days of fighting the Austrians had lost 14,000 men while inflicting only 5,000 casualties on the French.\n\nThe infantry carried the brunt of the fighting at Rivoli. During the first phase of the battle the Austrians enjoyed moderate success in the center. They failed however on both flanks.\n\nThe hardest fighting was centered on the Trambasore Heights defended by Massena's and Joubert's infantry. (Joubert had been marked out as a future great captain by Napoleon himself.)\n\nThe Austrian attacks in that sector of the battlefield were at first unsuccessful, but after several attempts they made a breach in the French line by routing Joubert¬ís left-flank infantry brigade. Bonaparte counterattacked and quickly restored the line. There were several twists and turns in this battle before the French finally won it. The Austrian army suffered very losses and was broken beyond repair. The Rue de Rivoli, a street in central Paris, is named after the battle.\n\nNapoleon's infantrymen had seen more years of campaigning and became battle-hardened veterans. They fought in Egypt, Syria, Italy (Piedmont, Papal State, Parma), Low Countries (Holand and Belgium today), Germany (Wurttemberg, Westphalia, Baden, Bavaria, Hanover etc.) and Switzerland. Many volunteers and levies knew no other life than soldiering. They grew up very quickly under fire, facing the armies of Prussia, Austria, Britain, and Russia. These hard men formed the core of Napoleon's infantry in the 1800s. Some of them ended up in the famous Imperial Guard. Others became NCOs and officers.\n\n.\n\n~\n\n.\n\nThere is no prouder chapter in the history of the French infantry than the records of their Army that tell of the heroic exploits of foot soldiers in 1805-15, exploits that rank with the most glorious examples of individual courage and devotion to duty in all history. The names of the regiments and individual soldiers who, through their personal bravery and daring, won the coveted Legion of Honor, will live forever in the annals of the nation.\n\nIn 1805-06 France had one of the best infantries which had ever existed in the World up until that time. Many of the Grande Armee's victories from 1805 to 1807 were both easy and decisive. \"The French infantry was indisputably the finest in Europe in 1805, and perhaps even the finest infantry fielded throughout the wars of 1792-1815.\" (Goetz - \"1805: Austerlitz\" p 45)\n\nIn November 1805 at Mariazell 4 French battalions routed 8 Austrian battalions. The French took large numbers of prisoners. General Friant wrote that at Austerlitz \"No sooner had the 15th Light and 33th Line arrived and deployed than they marched on the enemy, nothing could resist their attack, the 15th was directed at the bridge and chased a corps 10 times more numerous than they, penetrated Sokolnitz, intermingled with the Russians, slaughtering with the bayonet all that dared oppose them.\"\n\nThe Napoleonic foot soldiers were known for agility, stubborn attacks, and the speed of their marches. After all maneuverability and speed were the characterictics of Napoleon's lightning campaigns. Joseph Chlapowski's first impression of French infantrymen was, \"They were not like the Prussian infantry ...\"\n\nHe wrote, \"The arrival of the first French infantry division [to Poland], belonging to Davout's Corps, made a strange impression on me. A dozen or so of us rode out to meet it, and about a mile outside the city we saw fields completely covered with individual soldiers, in greatcoats of every color, carrying their muskets with the butts in the air and picking dry paths through the fields to avoid the knee-deep mud on the road. Right outside the city [Posen, Poznan today], by the windmills, there was a beating of drums, and they all came running to form ranks and in the blinking of an eye they had taken off their greatcoats, straightened their bicornes on their heads and become the most regular armies.\n\nThey then marched at a lively pace into the city with bands playing. They halted in the market square, stacked their weapons and took out little brushes to wipe the mud from their shoes and began fooling around as if they had only been marching for a mile, not the 150 miles they had just completed. I stared in amazement at these boisterous infantrymen, so far undefeated. They might as well have been going to a dance.\n\nThey were not like the Prussian infantry ... Those had seemed a full head taller, with broader shoulders and far stronger, but, at the same time stiff and wooden, and after a half-mile march, when their column had halted for some reason, they had straight away broken ranks to rest.\" (Chlapowski/Simmons - \"Memoirs of a Polish Lancer\" p 10)\n\nJohn Mills of British Coldstream Guards (ext.link) was impressed with the rapidity of their marches. He wrote, \"Their movements compared with ours are as mail coaches to dung carts. In all weathers and at all times they are accustomed to march, when our men would fall sick by hundreds ... Another peculiar excellence of the French infantry is their steadiness in manoeuvering under fire.\"\n\nAustrian General Stutterheim recalled: \"The French infantry manoeuvered with coolness and precision, fought with courage, and executed its bold movements with admirable concert.\"\n\nGeneral Thiebault described how the French infantry manoeuvered at Austerlitz (on the Goldbach Heights): \"The two corps [of Lannes and Soult] executed their rearward movement in squares, chequer-wise... For my own part I was no less struck by the novelty than by the magnificence of the spectacle. Nothing could be finer or more imposing than the 30 moving masses, which after two hours' march extended over a distance of five miles, while their arms sparkled in the sun.\"\n\nThe Russians and Austrians noted that the French regiments\n\nmaneuvered calmly and with precision as if on parade ground.\n\nEven in 1814 the young infantry recruits outmarched virtually every opponent.\n\nBlucher's Russians and Prussians covered 190 miles in 25 days (7.5 miles/day).\n\nThe Austrians and Bavarians marched 125 miles in 28 days (4.5 m/day)\n\nAllies' marches were not too impressive due to snow, ice, and sieges.\n\nThe poorly clothed and hungry French troops managed to march 8 miles/day .\n\nThe Old Guard covered 200 miles in 15 days (13.5 miles/day !)\n\nThe French enjoyed great reputation as skirmishers and rightly so. George Nafziger wrote that only the French can lay claim to the universal employment of their line infantry as skirmishers. General Duhesme proposed to rely only on skirmishers and small columns, claiming that the French are suited for this type of combat.\n\nA Prussian officer described the French skirmishers in combat (1806): \"However, from a great distance, the bullets of French skirmishers already reached us; they were placed formidably in the front of us laying in the field and bushes; we were unacquainted with such tactics; the bullets appeared to come from the air. To be under such fire without seeing the enemy made a bad impression of our soldiers. Then, because of the unfamiliarity with this sort of fighting, they lost confidence in their muskets and immediately felt the superiority of the adversary. They therefore suffered, already being in a critical position, very quickly in bravery, endurance and calmness and could not wait for the time to fire themselves which soon proved to be to our disadvantage.\"\n\nAt Mohrungen in January 1807 the French skirmishers shot Russian General-Lieutenant Anrepp, inflicting a mortal wound. \"He was the highest ranking officer on either side to perish during the campaign.\" (Arnold - \"Crisis in the Snows\" p 214)\n\n\"British participants in the battle [of Albuera 1811] noticed French sharpshooters lying on the ground and using their shakos as rests to steady their muskets for more accurate fire.\" ( Dempsey - \"Albuera 1811\" p 158)\n\nAt Waterloo, after the capture of La Haye Sainte by the French light regiment, their skirmishers continued their advance beyond the farm. Their sudden appearance provoked panic and consternation among the KGL and British squares. Wellington rode up to this point and watched the French for a while.\n\nOne of French skirmishers fired a shot at Wellington and the duke immediately rode away. Another shot mortally wounded horse under Lieutenant Cathcart. The officer left the horse to die and run on foot. According to Barbero \"a great number of Wellington's generals and aides were killed or wounded in this particular phase of battle, particularly in the area behind La Haye Sainte.\"\n\nUnder the fire of French skirmishers posted on the roofs of the farm, the 95th Rifles was forced to take quick refuge in the sunken lane. Other skirmishers went down on one knee and kept up an uninterrupted musket fire. They even captured the knoll above the sandpit, and \"whilst laying down, appeared to shoot their objects with great precission\" as wrote one of British officers. When years after the battle Captain Siborne started building his huge diorama of the battle, British generals insisted that the knoll where French skirmishers were stationed and fired at the British and German troops had to be represented.\n\nBritish officer Sir F. Ponsonby was an involuntary witness to French skirmishing at Waterloo. He found himself wounded and immobilized in a sector of battlefield occupied by French skirmishers. One of these threatened to kill him and demanded his money; Ponsonby let himself be searched .... A second skirmisher with the same intentions arrived but left disappointed after an even more meticulous search of colonel's person. Stll later, another skirmisher came by and decided to use the immobile Ponsonby as a screen ! He stayed for a long time, reloading and firing over Ponsonby's body again and again, and conversing with great gaiety all the while.\n\nIn 1809 at Ebelsberg, the men of the 26th Light, covered themselves with glory. Arnold writes, ¬ìThen the 26th Light set out across the Traun bridge to begin one of the celebrated assaults in French Napoleonic history. Austrian battery, sited on a rise behind the village [Ebelsberg] had acquired the range during prior French crossings and now dominated the scene. Musket fire flailed the bridge¬ís exit. Pouget ordered his men to open their ranks and sprint across the bridge, thereby reducing the time spent in the lethal beaten zone of flying metal. Gaining the far side, the 26th Legere reformed under the shelter of buildings General Coehorn rode up to Pouget, gestured toward a narrow village street, and said: ¬ëYou are going to follow this street to a chateau occupied by the enemy. You will attack it.¬í By now it was apparent that whoever held the chateau controlled the village below. the colonel dismounted, placed his sappers to the fore, and marched his men up the winding, cobbled street.\n\nSo narrow was the passage that in places his column had to shrink to a 6-rank frontage. After a stiff climb, Pouget sighted his objective 40 paces away. As his leading company of carabiniers reached the small square outside the chateau, muskets suddenly appeared from window and turret and the resultant discharge of noise, smoke, and lead arrived before the French could react. The disciplined defenders of the [Austrian] Jordis Infantry Regiment, supported by sharpshooting Grenzers, had waited until enough French soldiers massed at the top of the alleyway before firing Ignoring the casualties, when the smoke cleared, Pouget studied the chateau¬ís entrance.\n\nHe had his best marksmen, the carabiniers, engage the defenders in a musketry duel. In the first ten minutes, 3 carabinier officers and 53 men fell here. The combat proved harder still on the light companies jammed motionless in the alleyway at the rear. As the sappers charged forward to axe their way through the wooden door, other French soldiers found an unprotected cellar entrance and began to clear the chateau room by room. When the sappers burst through the front door, the garrison laid down their weapons and surrendered.¬î (Arnold - ¬ìNapoleon Conquers Austria¬î)\n\nIn 1809 at Aspern-Essling the 24th Light's in brilliant bayonet charge overran Austrian battery. The French took 700 prisoners and recaptured the church. Soon however the Austrian Beniovski Infantry Regiment counterattacked and retook the church.\n\nIn 1806 at Jena, the 111th Line captured Prussian battery despite 6 volleys of canister !\n\nIn 1809 at Aspern-Essling the Austrian cuirassiers executed a bold charge. \"Instead of losing momentum by ordering a square, he [Saint-Hilaire] commanded the trusty 105th Line to face to the flank, told the drummers to beat the pas de charge, and advanced against the enemy horsemen. Infantry charging cavalry was thing rarely attempted. It demanded great resolution. ... The 105th met the challenge and drove off the startled Austrian heavy horse.\" (Arnold - \"Napoleon Conquers Austria\", page 70)\n\nIn 1800 at Marengo, the French battle-hardened 72th Demi-Brigade was attacked by Austrian cavalry from the front and rear. There was no time to form square and the 3rd rank faced about and warned off the cavalry in the rear, while the 1st and 2nd rank repulsed those in the front !\n\nIn 1813 near Katzbach, the French IV/34th Line \"found a force of Prussian uhlans had charged into and captured the park of the French XI Corps. When only about one-sixth of their muskets would fire because of the day long rain the IV/34th Line charged, in a battalion mass, against the cavalry, drove it away, and recaptured the XI Corps park. They do not appear to have suffered any appreciable losses.\" (Nafziger - \"Imperial Bayonets\" p 42)\n\nIn March 1814, the French-Italian troops arrived at the walled city of Parma. One battalion of 9th Line Infantry marched down the length of the ramparts with a picket of Italian 1st Chasseur Regiment. The French voltigeurs arrived at San Francesco Gate, with Second-Lieutenant Hutinet at their head, they boldly scaled the wall and chased off the militia troops guarding it. They opened the gate and allowed the entry of the battalion. The Austrians and the British began to withdraw. On learning this, the French brought forward another battalion of the 9th Regiment. The allies were hastily scurrying along Parma's narrow streets and bridges to evacuate the city.\n\nThe bloodbath at Borodino (1812) was a glory day for the line infantry. Captain Francois of 30th Line of Morand's division described attack on the Death Redoubt (also called Great redoubt and Raievski Redoubt): \"Nothing could stop us... We hopped over the roundshots as it bounded through the grass. Whole files and half-platoons fell, leaving great gaps. General Bonamy ... made us halt in a hail of canister shot in order to rally us, and we then went forward at the pas de charge.\" A line of Russian troops tried to halt us, but we delivered a regimental volley at 30 paces and walked over them.\n\nWe then hurled ourselves at the redoubt and climbed in by the embrasureds; I myself got in through an embrasure just after its cannon had fired. The Russian gunners tried to beat us back with ramrods and levering spikes. We fought hand-to-hand with them, and they were formidable adversaries.\"\n\nCaptain Bonnet recalled how the Russian skirmishers arrived in good order a little to the left \"... and a dense column to our right. I deploy my battalion and, without firing, march straight at the column. It recoils. When carrying out this movement we were so exposed to grapeshot from the guns in the village that I saw my battalion falling and being breached like a crenellated wall. But still we went on.\"\n\nOnly strong Russian reinforcements and flank attacks were able to stop Morand's infantry. Morand's troops rapidly fell back. Morand was wounded in the chin by canister. The 30th Line Regiment had lost 2/3 (!) of its strength and General Bonnamy was captured after receiving 13 wounds ! Gerard's division came to the rescue of Morand's hard-pressed infantry. The Death Redoubt was covered in smoke and looked surreal as it was illuminated by the \"reddish aurora-borealis glow\" of its firing cannons.\n\nAt Austerlitz in 1805 General Vandamme's infantry attacked Kollowrath's Austrians and Miloradovich's Russians on the Pratzen Heights. According to Robert Goetz \"for at least an hour, intense fighting raged across the entire length of the Pratzen Heights\" Vandamme's divisional battery took active part in it firing canister at the whitecoats. The Austrians wavered and when few squadrons of French dragoons charged from the flank, they broke and fled. The dargoons captured hundreds of prisoners and sabered Austrian and Russian gunners. Once Kollowrath's northern flank was falling back, his center began crumbling. Around 11 AM Kollowrath ordered all his forces to withdraw.\n\nVandamme's infantry rushed forward with a cheer. Once Vandamme's men crossed over the crest Napoleon lost sight of them. They were now advancing against the second line under the command of Miloradovich. They opened a heavy musket fire killing and wounding many Russians and some Austrians. Both sides held their ground and paused - for a while - to put order in their weary battalions. Vandamme renewed his attack after 11:15 AM and broke the Russians. They fled toward Zbishow.\n\nAccording to Robert Goetz the fighting on the Pratzen Heights had marked the climax of the Battle of Austerlitz. The superb performance of the French made the Austrians' brave attempts futile.\n\nAt Pultusk in December 1806, Marshal Lannes, the \"French Ajax\", and General Suchet, led infantry assault on the Russian positions. \"Around 1 p.m. as Suchet's wing marched toward Barclay's position, Marshal Lannes rode up to help supervise the advance. After the French infantry passed through a woodlot they became the prime target for the Russian artillery. Inspired by Lannes' presence, the French infantry ignored their losses, climbed the slope in front of the Russian position, and charged. Russian sources paid tribute to their conduct: 'The attack of the French at this place was the most fierce and dashing.'\n\nThe 34th Ligne's charge stove in the first line of defence. Barclay's horse guns were facing west to check an advance along the road to Golymin. The retreat of the Russian infantry exposed the battery's left flank and Suchet's surging French infantry overran the battery. The Russian jagers fell back on their reserve: two battalions of Tengin Musketeers stationed parallel to the road. Here they rallied while the reserve launched a counterattacked. A furious melees ensued. Russian soldiers grappled with Captain Templier to possess the eagle of the 34th Ligne. The Russians tore the eagle from its perch leaving Templier clutching the less valuable battalion color. The Russian counterattack drove back the 34th Ligne and recaptured the 6 horse guns. In response, the second battalion of the 88th Ligne passed through the 34th and charged to stabilize the position. ... Then began a close range musketry duel.\" (Arnold - \"Crisis in the Snows\" p 164)\n\nNot all battles were easy and decisive victories, some were very bloody affairs and a great number of troops perished. Eylau, Wagram, Valutina Gora, and Borodino were slaughterhouses.\n\nAfter the battle of Valutina Gora \"Gudin's division were drawn up on top of their companions' and Russian corpses, amidst half-broken trees, on ground ripped up by roundshot ... Gudin's battalions were no longer more than platoons. All around was the smell of powder. The Emperor couldn't pass along their front without having to avoid corpses, step over them or push them aside. He was lavish with rewards. The 12th, 21st and 127th Line and the 7th Light received 87 decorations and promotions.\" (Britten-Austin - \"1812 The March on Moscow\" p 214)\n\nFor the capture of Shevardino Redoubt the French infantry paid dearly. Three times the redoubt changed hands and one battalion of 61st's Line was annihilated inside the redoubt !\n\nDe Segur writes: \"Next day when the emperor reviewed that regiment, he inquired where was its III Battalion ? 'In the redoubt' replied the colonel...\"\n\nThere were many dead and wounded Russians and French all around the place. The blood was literally flowing like a river. The fighting finally ceased for a while from confusion and exhaustion on both sides. The battle however was won by the French and the Russians have suffered even heavier casulaties (6.000) than the French (4.500). The infantry of Compans' division (Davout's corps) covered themselves with glory.\n\nThere was a lot of hand-to-hand fighting at Ostrolenka in 1807. \"Without waiting to deploy, the 21st Leger attacked. The Russians were strung out on a narrow road between two woods. However, the cossacks bought enough time for the infantry to deploy partially in a clearing overlooking a stream. The 21st Leger's leading battalion crossed a bridge over the stream, deployed, and made a bayonet charge against the Russian infantry who had not completed their formation change.\n\nTheir impetous charge struck the Ukraine Musketeers and a hand-to-hand struggle ensued. Some sense of the fight's ferocity comes from the fact that French musket fire broke the staffs of several flags belonging to the musketeers. Two gallant Russian junior officers tried to tear the banners from the staffs to prevent them from falling into enemy hands but a surging crowd of French soldiers forced them to drop the banners and use both hands to defend themselves.\" (Arnold - \"Napoleon's Triumph\" p 5)\n\nOn another occassion the French used artillery support. The Russian infantry columns advanced without pausing to fire. The French also held their fire until the enemy entered close range. At the last minute, Ruffin's infantrymen unmasked three guns. The guns then sent canister scything through a column of Russian grenadiers.\n\nAt Borodino the French infantry have suffered even more. Sergeant Bertrand of 7th Light Regiment writes: \"A roundshot took my captain's head off, killing or mortally wounding four men in the first rank. The lieutenant takes the captain's place; scarcely is he at his post than he's himself stricken by a piece of grape which shatters his thigh. In the same instant the sous-lieutenant's foot is shattered by another shell fragment. The officers hors de combat, the sergeant-major absent, I, as senior sergeant, take command of the company.\" The 57th Line Regiment (nicknamed The Terrible for their bravery) advanced steadily and without firing a shot despite mounting casualties. The Russians gunners fell back. Prince Bagration was greatly impressed with the French assault, he clapped his hands and yelled 'Bravo, bravo !'\n\nIn Italy and Spain many infantry units performed gallantly. John Burgoyne wrote in \"Life and correspondence of Burgoyne\": \"The French regiment came up the hill with a brisk and regular step, and their drums beating pas de charge: our men fired wildly and at random among them; the French never returned a shot, but continued their steady advance. The English fired again but still without return ... and when the French were close upon them, they wavered and gave way.\"\n\nAt Salamanca in 1812 the 25th Light and 27th Line attacked while the British line hesitated and stood firm for a moment. The British then broke and fled. An English officer described a fight between the elite British Fusiliers and the French: \"The French regiment formed close column with the grenadiers in front and closed the battalions ... They then advanced up the hill in the most beautiful order without firing a shot ... when about 30 paces distant our men began to waver, being still firing ... The ensigns advanced 2 paces in front and planted the colors on the edge of the hill and officers steped out to encourage the men to meet them. They stopt with an apparent determination to stand firm, the enemy continued to advance at a steady pace and when quite close the Fusiliers gave way: - the French followed down the hill on our side.\"\n\nColonel Waller of British 2nd Division witnessed a French infantry attack against Picton's \"Fighting Division\" in 1810 at Bussaco: \"At this moment were seen the heads of the several columns, three I think, in number and deploying into line with the most beautiful precision, celerity and gallantry.\n\nAs they formed on the plateau, they were cannonaded from our position and the regiment of Portuguese... threw in some volleys of musketry into the enemy's columns in a flank direction, but the (Portugese) regiment was quickly driven into the position ... the (French) columns advanced in despite of a tremendous fire of grape and musketry from our troops in position in the rocks, and overcoming all opposition although repeatedly charged by Lightburne's Brigade, or rather the whole of Picton's Division, they advanced and fairly drove the British right wing from the rocky part of this position.\"\n\nAt Corunna in January 1809 the French infantry had little surprise for the redcoats. Colonel M¬íKenzie of the 5th Foot decided to take some companies of his regiment through the village of Piedralonga and make a charge on the guns, which, so far as he could see, were unsupported. He led his men through the village of Piedralonga and then opened them up in line for the charge up the slope beyond it. They ran few yards only. Suddenly, from behind a curving, low stone wall beneath guns, a line of French infantry rose up and fired a volley of devastating effect. Colonel M¬íKenzie and several of his men dropped dead. The rest turned and fled down the slope.\n\nThe battle of Eylau was fought on 7 and 8 February 1807. It was the second bloodiest battle after Borodino. The Russians suffered 15-25.000 killed, wounded and prisoners and the French 10-15.000 killed and wounded. (British historian David Chandler suggests as many as 25.000 French casualties.) Riding over the battlefield the following morning, Marshal Ney said, Quel massacre! Et sans r√©sultat (\"What a massacre! And without result\").\n\nThe heaviest casualties on the French suffered Augereau's VII Corps. Its attack turned into a disaster. As soon as the infantry marched off a blizzard descended, causing all direction to be lost. Augereau's advance came under the point-blank fire of the massive 70-gun Russian centre battery. Augereau's infantry was thrown into great confusion with huge losses.\n\nOne regiment, the 14th Line was unable to retreat and fought very hard refusing to surrender. Its position would be marked by a square of corpses. Thirty six officers and 590 men from the regiment were buried on the battlefield. The cries of Vive la Paix ! instead of Vive I'Empereur ! were heard from the ranks of the army after the battle.\n\nAt Dresden in 1813 thousands of footsore young soldiers entered the city, wore their battle dress and marched into battle singing \"Victory is Ours\". Marshal Davout wrote, \"in spite of their youth ... I cannot recall having found more ardor in our old troops.\" Amongst these troops the bursting shells produced only a feeling of exhilaration and eagerness.\n\nAster tells a curious story of a battery which received orders to be ready to move into the fighting line. The men were dust-stained and untidy after their long march. The moment they heard the order, each man began to get out of his haversack his parade uniform, which it was thought suitable to don on such an occassion. Comical scenes ensued, as men, in the act of changing their trousers, had to skip off as they might to avoid a shell about to burst. All were laughing and cheery, as if about to go to some fete. Such was the spirit of Napoleon's soldiers.\" (Petre - \"Napoleon at War\" p 226, publ.1984)\n\nThe year of 1813 was a difficult time for the young French infantry. They often stood heavy artillery fire and repulsed repeated cavalry charges. Headley writes, ¬ìThe next moment the plain (near Hassenhausen) fairly rocked and trembled under the headlong charge of the Prussian cavalry as they came pouring on the French infantry. The shock was terrific; but that splendid body of horse recoiled from the blow as if it had fallen against the face of a rock instead of living men. The French threw themselves into squares, and the front rank, kneeling, fringed with their glittering bayonets the entire formations, while the ranks behind poured an incessant volley on the charging squadrons. These would recoil, turn, and charge again, with unparalleled but vain bravery. Prince William [of Prussia], who led them on, disdaining to abandon the contest, again and again hurried them forward with an impetuosity and strength that threatened to bear down everything before them.¬î (J T Headley - \"Napoleon and his Marshals\", Volume I, c. 1850)\n\nIn 1814 the French infantry found itself in heavily reduced size. A handful of heroes faced all of Europe to whom they themselves had taught the art of fighting over the past decade. The young recruits of French infantry under General Pacthod fought like lions at Fere Champenoise. Large squares formed by them withstood several charges made by cuirassiers, lancers, dragoons, and the Guards. They held their ground even after being decimated by musket fire at close range, followed by more cavalry attacks on every side.\n\nAt Ligny in 1815, the village itself was attacked by two infantry divisions of Gerard's IV Army Corps. (See map below.) Many of Gerard's regiments were recruited on areas very loyal to Napoleon. In terms of moral strength (and not numbers) it was probably the best corps in the French army during the Waterloo Campaign in 1815. This fact alone assured Napoleon that Ligny will fall rather sooner than later.\n\nIn the fight were involved almost 9.000 Prussian infantrymen (12 battalions x 600-800 men each, plus Schutzen or riflemen) and 9.000 Frenchmen (18 battalions x 400-600 men each). The Prussians however were protected by walls and hedges, while Gerard's men were in the open. After few hours of fighting Henckel's brigade (6 battalions) was withdrawn from the village and replaced with 6 fresh battalions of Krafft's 6th Brigade. Krafft's men were joined by Bose's fresh 8th Brigade. Gerard's infantry received no reinforcements.\n\nFrench columns - some were carrying the tricolor-flags - climbed up into gardens and over the fences. The hidden Prussians fired at close range, shattering the attackers. The churchyard in Ligny was besieged. \"Bayonets broke against the church flagstones, one of them pinning a sergeant to the church door.\" (- Henri Lachoque)\n\nThe French sappers attempted to smash down the gate of chateau. When it did not work they brougth cannons. The guns fired shells and some buildings went up in flames. The Prussians jumped out of the first floor windows and over the high walls. Gerard's men fired at them, it was as if fun of duck hunting but without the ducks.\n\nThe village was packed with French and Prussian troops. Many companies and battalions were so mixed up with others that it took time to extricate them.\n\nWilliam Siborne writes, \"The battle, on this part of the field, now presented an awfully grand and animating spectacle, and the hopes of both parties were raised to the highest state of excitement. Intermingled with the quick but irregular discharge of small arms throughout the whole extent of the village [Ligny], came forth alternately the cheering En avant! and exulting Vive I'Empereur ! as also the emphatic Vorwdrts ! and the wild Hourrah ! whilst the batteries along the heights, continuing their terrific roar, plunged destruction into the masses seen descending on either side to join in the desperate struggle in the valley, out of which there now arose, from the old Castle of Ligny, volumes of dark thick smoke, succeeded by brilliant flames, imparting additional sublimity to the scene.\"\n\nGerard's infantry showed vigor and aggressivennes that had once been the hallmark of the Napoleonic infantry during the Glory Years (1805-07).\n\nOn picture: \"the French arrived [at Tordesillas], 60 ... headed by Captain Guingret, a daring man, formed a small raft to hold their arms and clothes, and plunged into the water, holding their swords with their teeth, swimming and pushing their raft before them. Under protection of a cannonande they crossed this great river, though it was in full and strong water, and the weather very cold, and having reached the other side, naked as they were, stormed the tower: the Brunswick regiment then abandoned the wood, and the gallant Frenchmen remained masters of the bridge.\" (Napier - \"History of the War ...\" Vol IV, p 138)"
