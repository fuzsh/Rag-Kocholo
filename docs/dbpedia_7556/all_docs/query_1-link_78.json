        "text": "Paper presents an overview of the position of Polish World-War-One veterans in interwar period, framing theirs’ situation within a broader European context. I underline the dichotomy between ex-servicemen from former Austro-Hungarian, German or Russian armies (vast majority of veterans in the Second Republic of Poland) and the ‘independence fighters’ (i.e. soldiers from the voluntary Polish formations like Legiony Polskie) in terms of their legal and symbolic position in the state. State ideology often referred to the idea of the ‘independence deed’ and offered various privileges to the group of former Piłsudski’s Legionnaires and other ‘independence fighters’ Majority of ‘ordinary’ veterans was offered only ‘a pity’ and, unlike in Germany or France, they did not form any important mass movement, nor a ground for it. Dominating role of relatively small group of ‘Polish soldiers’ over masses of ‘soldiers-Poles’ could be therefore treated as rather specific feature of states like interwar Poland or Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe article describes the contribution of the \" Radosław \" Group's soldiers in the so-called second conspiration after the fall of the Warsaw Uprising in September 1945 and also the efforts of Jan Mazurkiewicz \" Radosław \" and his soldiers in returning to civilian life after the end of World War II. The analysis of the subject was based on available literature and archival records. For many of the Radosław Group soldiers, the struggle for independence of Poland didn't end with the fall of the Warsaw Uprising. They took part in recreating the Directorate for Diversion and later served in the Organization \" Nie \" and the Armed Forces Delegation for Poland until the dismantling of the Home Army. Due to the political situation in Poland and shortage of supply, their actions were limited (especially the combat activity). After the amnesty in 1945 and subsequent actions, former Radosław Group soldiers turned to social and veteran activities focused around self-help and maintaining the tradition of the Home Army. This later become a reason for the Communist authorities to accuse, repress, and imprison after 1949.\n\n\"My time is near. When they will be leading me out of my cell to die, my last words to my friends will be: I am happy that I will be murdered as a Catholic for my faith, as a Pole for my country, and as a human being [I will die] for justice and truth […] My last farewell will be only to you [my wife]. I believe that the Holy Mother will take my soul […] and I will continue to serve Her and report to Her about the tragedy of the Polish Nation-murdered by one [nation] and abandoned by the others\". (Final words of Lieutenant Colonel Lukasz Cieplinski, one of seven \"cursed soldiers\" and a WiN officer in a letter smuggled out of prison to his wife, Jadwiga.) The stories of Jozef Batory and Jozef Bryk seemed destined to be buried and forgotten behind the Iron Curtain. They were only recently brought to light after 1990 when the country gained its freedom. Until that time, it wasn't considered safe to circulate information and stories of soldiers from the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) and WiN (Poland's anti-communist Freedom and Independence Organization.) Batory and Bryk's backgrounds and responsibilities during World War II were very different, but their tragic deaths united them. Both men sacrificed their lives in the fight for Poland's freedom during and after the Second World War. Jozef Batory Jozef Batory was born on February 20, 1914, in Werynia, Poland. Like many of his peers, he joined the Polish resistance forces at the beginning of WWII during the Polish September campaign in 1939. In the early 1940s, Jozef became commandant of the Kolbuszowa district of the AK Home Army. During the Nazi occupation, Jozef and many other officers in the AK covertly received a high level of military training in the underground schools throughout Poland. Instruction at the high school and university level was banned, but these secret schools taught the officers history, geography, and economics. The underground schools were a phenomenon seen only in Poland. There were more than three hundred lecturers and 3,500 students at the Warsaw University alone. Lectures,\n\nThe article summarizes and compares the two biographical texts by writers who are difficult to compare in terms of aesthetics and political-ideological dimension − fragments of journals by Karol Irzykowski devoted to illness, death and remembrance of his daughter Basia and biographical memory of the dead of tuberculosis son Adam by Stefan Żeromski. The comparative perspective of both narratives of loss is present in their reflection on Polishness, increased in the circumstances of World War I. The analysis and interpretation shows that bearing witness to such a difficult personal existential experience paradoxically involves the necessity of re-positioning in and to Polishness. The memory of Adam Żeromski is subordinated to the social perspective, frame of collective memory, which makes it understandable why in Żeromski’s story he is the ‘little Pole’, and Basia is the subject to psychological and individual memory, collected memory, so she can be called the great Poland. In this sense, both texts are the media of culture of remembrance, which inherently clarifies and determines the experience of the Great War that seems to confirm the researchers’ diagnosis of a breakthrough significance of the period 1914-1918, also in the perspective of Polish identity."
