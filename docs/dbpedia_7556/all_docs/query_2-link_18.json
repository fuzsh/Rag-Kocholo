        "text": "Josef Anton Poniatowski (1763-1813), was a soldier without a country. Poland was partitioned three times over the course of the 19th century. By 1795, there was no Poland on the European maps at all. That didn’t keep this prince from a lifetime of service. His personal motto was “God, Honor, Fatherland.”\n\nPoniatowski first served in the Austrian army. In 1787, he distinguished himself by volunteering to lead an assault against the Turks at the fortress of Sabatch.\n\nPoniatowski fought in the uprising of 1794 as a common soldier. Later, during the Napoleonic wars he served as the Minister of War for the newly created (by the French) Grand Duchy of Warsaw.\n\nThen Poniatowski made military history as a daring, skilled, and courageous military commander fighting for the French (hoping that a triumphant Napoleon would one day restore the general’s beloved Poland).\n\nIn 1809, Poniatowski led a brilliant campaign against the Austrians seizing Lublin. Napoleon was impressed. He awarded Poniatowski a saber of honor. The general also received the Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honor and the Grand Cord of the Military Order.\n\nIn 1812, Poniatowski participated in Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. Though the campaign was a disaster, he personally performed brilliantly.\n\nAt the Battle of Leipzig, (1813) Poniatowski commanded Napoleon’s right wing. Napoleon honored him by making him a Marshall of France on the spot. Sadly, Poniatowski died in battles only days later.\n\nStill, lots of generals have done lots of great feats of arms. Why does Poniatowski rank as our pick as the best general ever?\n\nLet’s take a closer look at this great captain of military history.\n\nWas he Brave? At the Battle of Leipzig, Poniatowski was shot three times. Despite his grievous wounds, he refused to leave the field. Cut-off, with the bridge across the Elster River destroyed, he led his men in a desperate charge against the enemy across the raging waters. He was swept from his horse and drowned. Talk about going down fighting.\n\nOf course, other notable military commanders have died in battle. Custer, for instance, was killed along with his command at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. To be fair, the latest forensic evidence shows Custer died ingloriously during the first moments of the battle and not at “Custer’s Last Stand,” as is so often depicted.\n\nWas he skilled? Poniatowski was so good that during the 1812 campaign Napoleon had him lead both the advanced guard in the invasion of Russia and command the rear guard in the snowbound tragic and brutal retreat from Moscow. These missions are among the most difficult and important tasks of an armed force at campaign and only the the most competent and trusted commanders are assigned these duties.\n\nA good example is General John Buford who commanded the cavalry at the Battle of Gettysburg (1863). Buford’s actions secured the ground that eventually led to the Union winning the battle. Nicely portrayed by the actor Sam Elliott in the movie Gettysburg (1993).\n\nWas he dedicated? Poniatowski was a complete professional, unafraid to share the privations of his men, and as committed to his soldiers as the missions he was assigned.\n\nIn the U.S., we consider such dedication the acme of military leadership, reflected in generals like General Robert “Ike” Eichelberger who commanded troopsin some of the most grueling battles the Pacific during World War II.\n\nSo it is fair to say that many of great generals shared many of the attributes of Poniatowski. But, there is no denying that Prince Josef Anton Poniatowski, Marshall of France was the complete package. So this great captain without a country gets our vote.\n\nPoniatowski is buried in St. Leonard’s Crypt under the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, Poland. His memory has a home.\n\nAuthor:\n\nThe article was first published on 3rd November 2022 here.\n\nCover photo: Marshall Józef Antoni Poniatowski (Portrait by Josef Grassi). the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Wikimedia common, public domain\n\nBez kategorii History"
