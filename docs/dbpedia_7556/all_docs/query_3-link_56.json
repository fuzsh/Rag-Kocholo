        "text": "HD photographs of Jozef Poniatowski statue on Aile de Rohan-Rivoli at Musee du Louvre - Page 1191\n\nWe were at the Musee du Louvre in the 1st Arrondissement of Paris when we took these high definition photos showing a statue depicting Jozef Poniatowski, which was sculpted by Philippe Besnard.\n\nParis Statues\n\n- << Previous 1191 1192 1193 1194 Next\n\nWhen you look at the exterior of the Louvre along the Rue de Rivoli, you will see that there are numerous statues of military leaders, generals and Marshals of France depicted within the niches on the Aile de Rohan-Rivoli.\n\nThis first HD photo depicts Jozef Poniatowski, who was born in Vienna, Austria in 1763 with a full name and title of Prince Jozef Antoni Poniatowski.\n\nJozef Poniatowski was a nephew of King Stanislaw II Augustus, so hence his title, and initially his military career began in the Austrian army, where he rose through the ranks, then joined the Polish army leading forces fighting a victorious battle at the Battle of Zielence.\n\nYet resigning due to conflicts of interest, Prince Jozef Antoni Poniatowski participated in an uprising defending Warsaw, becoming a commander during the Austro-Polish War, with the Polish being victorious, and being a close aid to Napoleon Bonaparte he voluntarily took part in the French invasion of Russia, but had to resign from his command due to injuries and returned to Warsaw.\n\nSo in these photos you can see Prince Jozef in his military uniform, and it was after he went back to service, while enjoying breakfast with Joachim Murat they were surprised by the enemy.\n\nHaving got on his horse and broke through the army to come back with a cavalry charge, Prince Jozef Antoni Pniatowski was rewarded by being awarded a title of Marshal of the Empire by Napoleon Bonaparte. From this he was entrusted with aiding the retreat of the French army from Leipzig, but unfortunately was badly wounded and drowned in a river on 19th October 1813."
