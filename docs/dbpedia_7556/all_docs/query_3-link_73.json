        "text": "Introduction: A Brief Military History of Poland.\n\n\"... there were plenty of young men determined\n\nto prove their prowess on the battlefield.\"\n\n- Norman Davies\n\n\"Darling war, what a lady you must be\n\nfor all the most handsome boys\n\nto follow you like this\"\n\n(- from popular Polish song)\n\n.\n\nDuring the American expansion in 19th century there was a saying in Mexico: \"What bad luck for us. We are so far from God and so close to the USA.\" In 1840s Mexico lost more than 55% of its national territory to the much bigger neighbour. The Poles had not just one such neighbour but two. They were sandwiched between the militaristic Germany and the mighty Russian Empire. Furthermore, from the south and south-east came the Mongol (Tatar) hordes and the vast armies of Ottoman Empire. From the political and military point of view it was one of the worst locations on Earth.\n\nFor this reason Poland has in the course of history had little acquaintance with peace, but has again and again been forced to take up arms in the defence of the country. Neal Ascherson, Scottish journalist, writes, \"Russia and Prussia, especially, tried to suppress both Polish culture and language and the Catholic faith. In response, the Poles developed one of the most intense and self-sacrificing versions of Romantic nationalism ever seen in Europe.\"\n\nThe Poles have been compelled to fight almost continously. Norman Davies writes, \"Few nations in the last 200 years have seen more military action than the Poles. ... Private armies abounded. ... Vast numbers of indigent petty noblemen filled the ranks of a military caste of proportions unequelled in Europe. But their contempt for state service, their preoccupation with private wars and vendettas, ... their obsession with cavalry to the detriment of all other branches of warfare (infantry, artillery and engineers), and their opposition to the idea of raising an 'ignoble army' of peasant conscripts, put them at a marked disadvantage in relation to all their neighbours. ... From 1765 to 1831, constant attempts were made to develop Polish military potential to a level commensurate with that of the neighbouring countries. ... The revival began in 1765 with the founding of the Cadet Corps, a military college designed to raise a new generation of officers in the spirit of patriotism and enlightement. ... The Napoleonic episode initiated three decades of strong French influence.\" (Davies - \"God's Playground. A History of Poland.\" Vol II, p 268)\n\nThe Polish land forces has developed along parallel lines to those of the evolution of western european armies, although local conditions, produced certain deviations and left their own mark on tactics, uniform and weapons. The best part of Polish army was the cavalry. There was a saying that if the sky fell their lances would support it.\n\nLong list of wars involving Poland (ext.link)\n\nincluding victories, defeats and wars\n\nwith indecisive or unclear outcome\n\nBattle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) 1410: Second Phase.\n\nPolish knights vs Teutonic knights and guest crusaders\n\nfrom western Europe\n\nReenactment of the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) 1410.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBattle of Klushino 1610\n\n6.500 Poles routed 35.000 Russians and mercenaries\n\nfrom western Europe. The battle was decided by unstoppable\n\ncharge of Polish cavalry. Casualties: 400 Poles and 5.000\n\nRussians and mercenaries. After the battle, the tsar was\n\nousted by the boyars. The small Polish army entered Moscow\n\nand occupied Kremlin.\n\nBattle of Kircholm 1605\n\nApprox. 4,000 Poles defeated 12,000 Swedes.\n\nThe battle was decided in 20 min. by the devastating\n\ncharge of Polish cavalry. The Swedish king fled.\n\nCasualties: 300 killed and wounded Poles and Allies\n\n5.000-9.000 killed, wounded and captured Swedes\n\n11 artillery pieces and 60 banners.\n\nSiege of a Polish fortress of Kamieniec Podolski\n\nby a massive Turkish army. From the movie\n\n\"Colonel Wolodyjowski.\"\n\nIn 1672 Ottoman army (80,000 men) invaded Ukraine and\n\ncaptured the fortress at Kamieniec Podolski. Small Polish\n\narmy then dealt several defeats to the Ottomans; of which\n\nthe battle of Chocim was the largest.\n\nThe Ottoman army at Chocim (or Khotyn) consisted of 35.000\n\nmen and 50-120 guns. The Turks held the entrenched camp.\n\nThe Polish army of 30.000 men and 65 guns under Jan Sobieski\n\nattacked on arrival. The victory was decisive. The Polish losses\n\nwere very light. The Turks suffered 30.000 killed, wounded and\n\ncaptured. They also lost all artillery. From then on they called\n\nJan Sobieski \"The Lion of the North.\"\n\nUnable to break into Europe through Poland, the Turkish army\n\ninvaded Austria and Hungary. The most important battle of the\n\n1683 campaign was the battle of Vienna. It was the turning point\n\nin the 300-year long struggle between christian Europe and the\n\nOttoman Empire.\n\nThe Christian coalition of 70,000 German, Polish and French\n\ntroops under Polish King Jan Sobieski defeated 120,000 Turks.\n\nFour cavalry groups totalling 20,000 men, one of them Austro-\n\n-German, and the other three Polish, charged down the hills.\n\nThe enemy was crushed and fled in panic. It was one of the\n\nlargest cavalry charges in history.\n\nPope Innocentius XI regarded the defence of Vienna as his major\n\nachievement. European dignitaries hailed Sobieski as the \"Savior\n\nof Vienna and Western European civilization.\" In a letter to his\n\nwife Sobieski wrote that the freed Austrians \"kissed my hands,\n\nmy feet, my clothes...\"\n\nPs. On 26 September 1660 at Kutyszcze, 140 Polish winged hussars defeated 1,600-3,500 Russians and Cossacks. (Ratio of 1 to 11 !) The enemy was under Vasyl Sheremetev and consisted of fine regiment of reiter cavalry (armored, mounted on strong horses) and regiment of Cossack infantry. The Russians delivered several salvos. It however made no impression on the Poles. The winged hussars charged and oberthrew everything on their way.\n\nThe Fall of Poland.\n\nThe XVIII century is considered the most tragic period in Polish history. Poland's neighbours, Russia and Prussia were absolute states and their political systems stood in contradiction to the Polish tradition of self-government, low taxes, and civil freedoms of the gentry. Low taxes also meant numerically weak army.\n\nAdditionally it became increasingly common for Polish parliament's sessions to be broken up by liberum veto. It was every nobleman's representative's right to block any legislation, just by uttering his veto. It was tantamount to an extreme expression of political liberty and conceived as a safeguard against tyranny. Poland deteriorated from a European power into a state of anarchy. (Although for two centuries Poland was an European power, it never was a world power, like France, Britain, Spain and Russia.)\n\nIn 1791 the Poles attempted to reform their political system. The Polish Constitution of May was Europe's first modern codified national constitution and the world's second after the USA constitution. The changes in Poland were received with hostility by Russia and Prussia, while the situation in Europe was not encouraging for the Poles.\n\nThe internal problems of France, the preoccupation of Britain with the American Revolution, gave the opportunity for Russia, Prussia and Austria to proceed with reference to Poland. Between 1772 and 1795 the entire territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was divided between Prussia, Austria and Russia. The first partition of Poland took place in 1772, the second in 1793 and the third in 1795. The partitions ended the political existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The King was forced to abdicate and was taken to Russia.\n\nMany captured Poles were sent to Siberia but thousands more escaped to France, Germany and Italy. For next decades Prussia, Russia and Austria had much of their land forces tied up in Poland and could not field enough troops to suppress the French Revolution, which added to its success.\n\nThe Partition of Poland did not for a moment break the resistance of the Poles, who - whenever opportunity offered - rose in arms to fight not only for their own country, but also for the idea which they inscribed on their standards - \"Free men are brothers.\"\n\nTerritorial evolution of Poland (ext. link)\n\nPoland in 1018 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Poland in 1500s (\"Golden-Age of Poland\")\n\nPartitions of Poland (1772,1793,1795) . . . Poland in 1809-15 (Napoleonic wars)\n\nby Russia (green), Austria (yellow) and Prussia (black)\n\nPolish Legions in 1797-1808.\n\n\"The fact France's enemies happened to be Poland's oppressors was\n\nan obvious attraction, and many Polish soldiers volunteered for\n\nservice in the French army.\" (Summerville - \"Napoleon's Polish Gamble\" p 15)\n\n.\n\nThe Polish Legions in the Napoleonic period, were several units that served with the French Army, from 1797 to 1803. \"During the Partitions, the Poles came to see France as their truest friend in the outside world. There was some background to this: the French and Polish royal families had intermarried, French had become the polite language of the great Polish aristocrats, and Poland had drawn many ideas from the Enlightenment and the Revolution of 1789 before its fall. Afterwards, Napoleon supported the Polish cause (for his own ends), and for most of the 19th century French governments not only welcomed Polish exiles but loudly endorsed their calls for the restoration of independence.\" (- Neal Ascherson)\n\nThere is hardly a more touching chapter in the world's history than the story of the Polish Legions. The Poles hoped that by fighting on the French side against Austria, Russia and Prussia, the contries that had partitioned Poland they could free their country.\n\nIn 1797, about two years after the last dismemberment of Poland, Polish troops were formed in northern Italy, in Polish uniforms, under Polish commander General Dabrowski, decorated with French cockades and wearing on the eppaulets the inscription: \"Gli uomini liberi sono fratelli.\" (Free men are brethren.) In the beginning iIts quartermaster was an Italian, Lodovico Gazzari. The Legion was bolstered by the arrival of many new recruits who had deserted from the Austrian army.\n\nGeneral Jan Henryk Dabrowski was a bear of a man, good natured and rather phlegmatic. He was also known as Jean Henri Dombrowski (french), or Johann Heinrich Dombrowski (german). Dabrowski was an excellent organizer, a well-educated and very capable officer, a brave soldier and caring leader of men. Military historians sometimes blame him for abandoning the bridge at Borisov (1812), not remembering that he put up a stubborn resistance, losing 1,800 (!) of his 2,400 men. Contemporaries also criticized him for his too lenient attitude toward captured German officers.\n\nDabrowski was a humane man and a great patriot. He is a Polish national hero. Only Prince Poniatowski is more popular general of Duchy of Warsaw.\n\nThe Polish Legion (7 officers and 1.110 other raks) under Dabrowski became part of French division under General Kilmaine, and was classified as light infantry. In April the Legion consisted of three infantry battalions, two cavalry squadrons and few guns:\n\nI (Grenadier) Battalion - under Strzalkowski\n\nII (Chasseur) Batalion - under Kosinski\n\nIII (Fusilier) Batalion - Dembowski\n\nArtillery: 4 cannons and 2 howitzers\n\nLight Cavalry: two squadrons\n\nDepot in Milan - under Konopka\n\nIn July 1797 Joseph Wybicki wrote a song titled \"Dabrowski's Mazurka\" to boost the morale of Dabrowski's soldiers. It was about two years after the Third Partition of Poland erased the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth from the map. The song expressing the idea that Poland, despite lack of independence, had not disappeared as long as the Polish people were still alive and fighting in its name, soon became one of the most popular patriotic songs in Poland. It was officially adopted as the national anthem of Poland in 1926. Napoleon is the only non-Polish person mentioned by name in the anthem. Actually Poland is the only country in the world to invoke Napoleon Bonaparte in its national anthem.\n\nPoland has not yet died,\n\nSo long as we still live.\n\nWhat the alien power has seized from us,\n\nWe shall recapture with a sabre.\n\n- - - March, march, Dabrowski,\n\n- - - To Poland from the Italian land.\n\n- - - Under your command\n\n- - - We shall rejoin the nation.\n\nLike Czarniecki to Poznan\n\nReturned across the sea\n\nTo save his homeland\n\nAfter the Swedish partition.\n\n- - - March, march...\n\nWe'll cross the Vistula and the Warta,\n\nWe shall be Polish.\n\nBonaparte has given us the example\n\nOf how we should prevail.\n\nBy the end of April the ranks of the Legion had swelled to 5,000 men. In May 1797 the Legion was reorganized into two legions. Each legion had 3,750 infantrymen and some artillery. The infantrymen were organized into 3 battalions of 10 companies (8 fusilier, 1 grenadier, 1 chasseur). There was also formed battalion of artillery under Aksamitowski. It consisted of three companies.\n\nOrganization of Polish Legions in mid-1797:\n\nCommander - General Jan Henryk Dabrowski\n\nQuartermaster - Luigi Gazzari (Italian)\n\nADCs - Tremo, Zawadzki\n\n- - - - - 1st Legion\n\n- - - - - Commander - General Wielhorski until October 1797, then General Kniaziewicz\n\n- - - - - Second-in-command - Strzalkowski\n\n- - - - - Quartermaster - Antonio Caccianiga (Italian)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - I Battalion - under Strzalkowski until August 1797, then by Bialowiejski\n\n- - - - - - - - - - II Battalion - under Kosinski until August 1797, then by Forestier\n\n- - - - - - - - - - III Battalion - under Zablocki until August, then by Grabinski\n\n- - - - - 2nd Legion\n\n- - - - - Commander - General Rymkiewicz\n\n- - - - - - - - - - I Battalion - under Dembowski\n\n- - - - - - - - - - II Battalion - under Chamand (Frenchman) until August 1797, then by Lipczynski\n\n- - - - - - - - - - III Battalion - under Niemojewski until September 1797, then by Zagorski\n\nBy the end of 1798 the Legions were 10.000 men strong and had infantry, artillery and light cavalry.\n\nThe Legions fought in March 1797 at Brescia, in April took part in quelling the uprising in Verona, in July suppressed insurrection in Reggio Emilia, in May 1798 helped the French to secure the Papal States, putting down some peasant revolts, and garrisoned Rome. In December 1798 the Legions were fighting against the anti-French forces from the Kingdom of Naples, defeating them at Civita Castellana. At Civita Castellana General Macdonald with 7.000 French and 3.000 Polish troops trashed Mack's 30.000-40.000 Neapolitan troops. The Poles led by Kniaziewicz routed enemy's left wing. The Legions then fought at Magliano, Falari, Calvi and Capua before Naples capitulated on 23 January.\n\nIn mid-1799 the First Legion fought at Trebbia and Novi, and on 26 September at the Second Battle of Zurich.\n\nAt Novi (picture -->) General Suvorov (50.000 Austrians and Russians) defeated French Generals Joubert and Moreau (37.500 French and Polish troops). The French suffered extremely heavy casualties. There were 16.000 killed, wounded and captured. General Joubert was killed. He had been marked out as a future great captain by Napoleon himself. After the battle, his remains were brought to France. Alexander Suvorov suffered only 6.000 killed and wounded.\n\nThe Second Legion fought on the Adige (26 March  5 April) and at the Battle of Magnano. The legion suffered extremaly heavy losses in the two engagements. The remainder of the Second Legion became part of the garrison at Mantua, which was soon placed under siege by the Austrians. At the end of the siege, the French commander de Foissac-Latour decided to release Polish soldiers  into Austrian custody as the Austrians claimed them to be deserters. This marked the end of the Second Legion.\n\nWhen Napoleon became the First Consul, the Polish Legions were reorganized in France into the Italian Legion, that would become part of the Army of Italy. The Italian Legion fought at Peschiera and Mantua.\n\nThird Legion (Danube Legion,\n\nRhine Legion, Légion du Rhine)\n\nIn 1799 General Kniaziewicz formed the Third Polish Legion (also called the Danube Legion, Rhine Legion, Légion du Rhine, or Legia Naddunajska) to fight against the Austrians in Bavaria. The men were Polish volunteers, mostly French prisoners of war from the Austrian Army. The Third Legion fought as part of the French Army of the Rhine at Berg, Bernheim and Offenburg. The Poles also fought at Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800.\n\nIn December 1801, or in 1802, the three Polish Legions were reorganized by the French government into three demi-brigades.\n\nThe size of the Legions decreased after the Treaty of Luneville (February 1801), which to the disappointment of the legionnaires made no mention of Poland. Many legionnaires, including General Kniaziewicz, felt that they had been used by the French and resigned. General Dabrowski remained in command, and reorganized both Legions into two 6,000-strong units in March 1801.\n\nIn 1793 British troops invaded Haiti (San Domingo island on Caribbean Sea) to suppress a slave rebellion but were forced to withdraw.\n\nIn 1802, France sent two demi-brigades to Haiti (San Domingo) to put down the Haitian Revolution. Napoleon wanted to regain this colony. The French troops burned alive, hanged, drowned, and tortured black prisoners, reviving such practices as burying blacks in piles of insects and boiling them in cauldrons of molasses. After one battle, the French buried 500 prisoners alive. The enemy responded by hanging 500 French prisoners. Combat casualties and tropical diseases, including the yellow fever, reduced the 5,000-strong Polish contingent to a few hundred survivors in the space of less than two years. The Haitian experience cast further doubts among Poles about France's and Napoleon's good intentions toward Poland.\n\nBy the way, not all Poles supported Napoleon. General Tadeusz Kosciuszko, said about the Emperor: \"He only thinks of himself, not about nationalist ideas, and so he could not care less about any dreams of independence [of Poland]. He is a despot, whose sole ambition is to satisfy his personal ambition. He will create nothing of any permanence, of that I am sure.\" Kosciuszko is Polish national hero, general and a leader of 1794 uprising (which bears his name) against the Russian Empire. He and Lafayette fought in the American Revolutionary War on the side of Washington.\n\nLegion of the North\n\n(Légion du Nord)\n\nLegion of the North (or Legion du Nord, Legia Polnocna) was formed in 1806 from Polish deserters from Prussian army. On 23 September 1806 Napoleon formed 2nd Legion of the North. Both Legions had the same strength (theoretically 5.000 men each) and organisation. The legion consisted of staff and four battalions. Each battalion was composed of nine companies (1 Carabinier, 1 Voltigeur and 7 Chasseur).\n\nThe legions were under the command of Polish General Zajaczek. In January 1807 the 1st Legion left Magdeburg in Prussia. Many soldiers lacked uniforms and weapons. In March 1807 the 2nd Legion was disbanded and the officers and soldiers were incorporated into the first Legion.\n\nOn paper the legion numbered 10.000 men but desertions were a big problem. The soldiers lacked almost everything. Levebvre warned Marshal Berthier, the chief of staff of the French army, that if the men get no shoes, trousers, shakos and jackets, all will desert. The legion became part of French infantry division under General Menard. It fought in several engagements of the campaign in Eastern Prussia and Poland. The legionnaires fought well at Disarchau (today Tczew on Vistula River) and Danzig (today Gdansk).\n\nIn September 1807 Napoleon decided that the legion (down to 2.500 men) will be transferred from French to Saxon army. The few French officers left the legion and joined the French army. Because the Duchy of Warsaw was under Saxon King, it was directed to Poland and in 1808 became part of Polish 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments.\n\nVistula Legion 1806-1814.\n\nNapoleon stated that the infantry [of the Vistula Legion]\n\nwere to be treated on a par with French line regiments.\n\n- George Nafziger\n\n.\n\nBy 1806 what was left of Dabowski's Polish Legions in Italy and Kniaziewicz's Danube Legion was one infantry regiment and one cavalry regiment. \"In February 1807 these remnants became part of the French army and were sent to Silesia. These Polish veterans became the core of a new Polish Legion ... and were initially called the Polish-Italian Legion (Italian since they had fought in Italy, not because the unit had Italians in it).\n\nNapoleon's decree of 1807 stated this Legion should consist of three infantry regiments and one cavalry regiment. ... In June, the formation took part in the siege of Klodzko. From Silesia the Legion moved to service in Westphalia in October 1807 ... On 21 February 1808, Napoleon ordered the Legion to Poitiers in France, where it was formally inducted into the French army.\n\nIn a letter to Davout dated 31 March 1808, Napoleon renamed the Polish-Italian Legion (Polacco-Italienne) the \"Vistula Legion.\" He also stated that the infantry were to be treated on a par with French line regiments ... The depot for the Legion appears to have been Sedan. ... It should also be noted that French nationals were not permitted to serve in the Legion, except as the company clerks (fourriers), battalion adjutant non-commissioned officers, and as paymasters. ...\n\nAfter the battle of Wagram (1809), Napoleon found that he was once again in possession of a large number of ethnic Poles amongst his Austrian prisoners of war. The Decree of 8 July, 1809, directed that these men were to form a 2nd Vistula Legion. ... The 2nd Vistula Legion never was able to form completely, so it was disbanded by the Decrees of 12/15 February, 1810. It was incorporated into the 1st Vistula Legion as a 4th Regiment. The Vistula Legion was sent to Spain where it fought in the sieges of Saragossa and Segunto.\n\nIn fact, the Vistula Legion seemed particularly destined to participate in sieges, and it fought in all of the major sieges in eastern Spain during the early years of the Peninsular War. ... In preparation for the invasion of Russia the Vistula Legion was withdrawn from Spain in early 1812. ...\n\nOn 2 April, 1812, Napoleon decided to include the Poles in the Young Guard corps under Marshal Mortier rather than designating them as Guard. The third battalions were formed, but on 31 May, after reviewing them in Posen, Napoleon directed that they not form elite companies, feeling their soldiers were too young. However, they would follow the main army as far as Smolensk and Gjatsk, joining the main body only during the retreat in the beginning of November. ... The 4th Regiment was still in Spain while the other regiments went to Russia. ... These men had fought bravely at Smolensk, Borodino, Tarutino, Krasnoe and at the Berezina Crossing. \" (Nafziger - \"Poles and Saxons of the Napoleonic Wars\")\n\nGeneral Joseph Chlopicki (born March 14, 1771  died September 30, 1854) commanded the infantry of Vistula Legion between June 1808 and 1812. (Earlier it was under General Grabinski.) He was one of the toughest Polish infantry generals of Napoleonic wars. Chlopicki was awarded by the French with Legion of Honour for the battle of Epila and the storming of Saragossa. In 1809 he was promoted to the rank of general de brigade. During the invasion of Russia in 1812, Chlopicki was wounded at Smolensk. In 1813 he was made a general de division. He held aloof at first from the November Uprising of 1830-31 (war with Russia), but at the general request of his countrymen accepted the post of commander in chief of Polish army.\n\n1st Infantry Regiment of Vistula Legion\n\n28 Battles and combats: 1806 - St.Euphemie, Mangona, and Codron, 1807 - Salzbrunn, 1808 - Mallen, Allagon, Saragosse, Tudela, and Tavenca, 1809 - Saragosse, Alcanitz, Maria, Belchite, and Stella, 1810 - Villet-Checa, 1811 - Tarragona, Murviedra, Gratalope and Fairet, 1812 - Valence, Smolensk, Chirikovo, Borodino, Krimskoie, Voronowo, Beresina, Krasnoie, and Wilna\n\nColonels: 1808 - Chlopicki, 1809 - Kosinowski, 1811 - Fondzielski, 1812 - Kosinowski\n\n2nd Infantry Regiment of Vistula Legion\n\n28 Battles and combats: 1808 - Saragossa and Tudela, 1809 - Perdiguera, Santa Fe, Belchite, Aquila, El Fresna, Calatayud, Retascon, Daroca, Ojos Negros and Tremedal, 1810 - Torre la Carcel, Teruel, Villastar, Villel, Lancosa, Tortosa and Fuente Santa, 1811 - Azuara, 1812 - Valence, Smolensk, Woronowo, Beresina, Tarutino, Wilna and Kowno, 1813 - Wittenberg\n\nColonels: 1808 - Bialowieyski, 1808 - Kosinowski, 1809 - Michalowski ?, 1812 - Chlusowicz, 1812 - Malczewski\n\n3rd Infantry Regiment of Vistula Legion\n\n10 Battles and combats: 1808 - Saragosse, 1809 - Saragosse, 1812 - Smolensk, Chirikovo, Borodino, Krimskoie, Voronowo, Beresina, Krasnoie, and Wilna\n\nColonels: 1807 - Swiderski, 1809 - Estko, 1812 - Kosinski, 1812 - Szott (Fondzielski ?)\n\n4th Infantry Regiment of Vistula Legion\n\n13 Battles and combats: 1810 - Puebla de Senabria, Benevente, Santa Martha, 1811 - Puebla, Aldea-del-Ponte, Tabara, Salinas and Penaranda, 1812 - Tudela, Ontario and Penaranda, 1813 - Rogozno and Parkowo\n\nColonels: 1812 - Bronikowski and Estko\n\nThe infantry of Vistula Legion was part of Napoleon's Grande Armee during the invasion of Russia. They formed infantry division under Generals Claparede (Frenchman) and Chlopicki. The division was attached to the Imperial Guard.\n\nThe Vistula Legion consisted of several regiments of infantry (described above) and a single cavalry regiment. In 1811 was formed a second regiment. They were light cavalry and were armed with lances. The regiments had four squadrons each.\n\nThe Vistula Uhlans routed the Austrians at Hohenlinden in 1800, the Prussian infantry and cavalry at Struga (Strigau) in 1807, the British infantry and cavalry at Albuera in 1811, and the Spanish at Ocana and Tudela. The Spaniards called them \"Picadors of the Hell\". Some of the best privates and officers of this regiment were admitted into the Old Guard Lancer Regiment. They also served as instructors for the newly formed French lancer regiments.\n\nFor more information about the Vistula Uhlans click here.\n\n(Uniforms, commanders, and battle record)\n\nArmy of Duchy of Warsaw.\n\nThe war in 1807 was called by Napoleon the \"First Polish War\"\n\nand resulted in the formation of the Polish state, Duchy of Warsaw.\n\nIn 1812 Napoleon, in an attempt to gain increased support from\n\nPoles termed the war against the Russia the \"Second Polish War.\"\n\n.\n\nIn 1806, after crushing the fearsome Prussian army at Jena and Auerstadt, the French troops arrived in Poland. Marshal Murat entered Warsaw to a rapturous welcome. He was feted by the Poles igniting hopes of future kingship.\n\nThe Polish populace considered Napoleon's troops as friends. This is confirmed by French officers Parquin writes: \"After our passage of the [Vistula] river ... the enemy [Russians] gave way and we occupied the Polish villages, where we were received like brothers by the people, miserably poor though they were.\" (Parquin - \"Napoleon's Victories\" p 63)\n\nThe Emperor however was hesitant about reenacting the Kingdom of Poland. In spite of the ovations given him by the Poles, he wrote: \"Only God can arbitrate this vast political problem ... It would mean blood, more blood, and srtill more blood ...\" But it was not long before the Duchy of Warsaw became a bastion of France in central and Eastern Europe, and Polish troops stood ready to fight for Napoleon and independence. For nowhere else had Napoleon a more loyal and devoted ally than the Poles who stood by him through thick and thin.\n\nThe Duchy of Warsaw was officially created by Napoleon as part of the Treaty of Tilsit signed with Russia and Prussia in 1807. It was formally an independent duchy, allied to France, and in a personal union with the Kingdom of Saxony. The progressive Napoleonic Code (ext. link) became the law of the duchy. The Poles joked that the army is Polish, the king is Saxon, the money is Prussian, and the code is French.\n\nThe area of the duchy covered roughly the areas of the 2nd and 3rd Prussian partitions, with the exception of Danzig (Gdansk), which became the Free City of Danzig under joint French and Saxon \"protection\", and of the district around Bialystok, which became part of Russia. The population was 2,600,000. Following the annexation in 1809 of Austrian Galicia and Krakow, the duchy's population substantially increased, to 4,300,000.\n\nAlready in November 1806 Napoleon directed General Dabrowski to form Polish troops. Dabrowski issued a decree ordering the population to provide 1 infantry recruit from every 10 households, 1 cavalry recruit from every 45 households and 1 chasseur (light infantry) recruit from every estate. In January 1807 the Polish army consisted of 20.500 recruits and 3.000 volunteers. The army was organized into three legions (divisions).\n\nThe constitution established the Polish army at 30,000 men. Prince Poniatowski became its Minister of War. The Poles joked about the Duchy having \"a Saxon king, French laws, Polish army, and Prussian currency.\" (Nafziger-\"Poles and Saxons\" p 3)\n\nPopulation of Duchy of Warsaw and other countries\n\n(incl.

Several battalions were sent to Prussia. Due to such wide distribution of Polish troops the divisional organization had become obsolete.\n\nAfter the victorious war against Austria and annexation of Galicia the Poles raised new regiments: 6 infantry and 10 cavalry (1 cuirassiers, 2 hussars and 7 uhlans).

Napoleon approved Poniatowski's suggestion to add 2 light cannons to every Polish infantry regiment.\n\nThe strength of companies in infantry and cavalry regiments was increased. Before the campaign against Russia the army of Grand Duchy consisted of more than 75.000 men and 165 guns. There were 22 infantry and 20 cavalry regiments. There were also the Vistula Legion and the Guard Lighthorse-Lancers. Most of the regiments participated in the Invasion of Russia. See below.\n\n.\n\nOrder of battle of Polish troops in August 1812 for the Invasion of Russia.\n\n(GdD = General de Division, GdB = General de Brigade, Col.= Colonel)\n\nOrder of battle of Polish troops in October 1813 in Saxony.\n\nBelow are only VIII Army Corps and IV Cavalry Corps.\n\nThere were also Polish troops in the Imperial Guard\n\nand in fortresses, like Zamosc, Glogau, Modlin etc.\n\n(GdD = General de Division, GdB = General de Brigade, Col.= Colonel)\n\nPS.\n\nThe very heavy drain on its resources by massive military recruitment, combined with a drop in exports of grain, caused problems for the Duchy's economy. Furthermore, in 1808 the French government imposed on the duchy an agreement at Bayonne to buy from France the debts owed to it by Prussia. (The territory of the Duchy covered roughly the areas of the 2nd and 3rd Prussian partitions.) The debt, amounting to more than 43 million francs in gold, was bought at a very discounted rate of 21 million francs. However, although the duchy made its payments to France over a 4-year period, Prussia failed to pay it, causing the Polish economy to suffer heavily. Indeed, to this day the phrase \"Bayonne sums\" is a synonym in Polish for a huge amount of money.\n\n1808-12 War in Spain .\n\n(Peninsular Campaign).\n\n.\n\nSome Polish regiments served in Spain under French and Polish generals. The 4th, 7th and 9th Infantry Regiment, company of artillery, and company of sappers, formed an infantry division under French General Valence (in 1809 under Werle). Initially the Poles feared being send out of Europe. In 1802 Napoleon sent Polish troops to Haiti.\n\nThe division was called Polish Division, and then the name was changed to Division of Duchy of Warsaw. In 1808 it became part of French IV Corps under Lefebvre (in 1809 under Sebastiani).\n\nThe 1st, 2nd and 3rd Infantry Regiment of Vistula Legion were under General de Brigade Jospeh Chlopicki. (In 1808 colonel of the 1st Regiment of VL). The Guard Lighthorse Regiment was with Napoleon's Imperial Guard. The Vistula Uhlan Regiment under Colonel Jan Konopka was part of French cavalry corps.\n\nThe Poles distinguished themselves during the epic siege of Saragossa, and in several battles like Ocana, Tarragona, Maria, Mallen, Tudela, Albuera, and Fuengirola. The commander of Vistula Legion, Chlopicki, was awarded with Legion of Honour and promoted to the rank of general de brigade.\n\nThe brilliant charge of Polish light cavalry at Somosierra Pass opened the road to Madrid. The Spanish troops were decimated, and their guns captured. William F.P. Napier wrote that the charge of \"these gallant warriors ... can hardly be paralleled in the annals of war... The charge itself, viewed as a simple military operation, was extravagantly rash ...\"\n\nThe infantry regiments of Vistula Legion distinguished themselves at Maria, Belchite, Lerida and during the two sieges of Saragossa. By the final fall of the city in February 1809 the Poles had lost 1,390 killed and wounded. The Spaniards rarely surrendered a city without a siege, and usually fought fiercely even after the city walls were breached !\n\nDuring the first siege of Saragossa a French corps (5,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry and 16 guns) under General Lefebvre-Desnouettes and subsequently commanded by General Verdier besieged, repeatedly stormed, and was repulsed from the city in the summer of 1808. The Spanish General Palafox raised a force of 7,500 troops. Palafox's resistance made him a national hero.\n\nSaragossa would endure a second, longer, more famous siege starting in late December. Marshal Moncey had 38,000 infantry, 3,500 cavalry, 3,000 engineers, and 60 siege guns. Moncey split his forces: one division under Gazan was assigned to the north, Mortier's corps was posted to the west, and Moncey's corps went to the south. On 29 December 1808 Moncey was reassigned to Madrid and was replaced in command of his corps by Junot. In January 1809 Junot was replaced with Marshall Lannes who had been recovering from an earlier injury. The second siege was particularly noted for its brutality. When it finally fell to the French in 1809, Saragossa had become a city of corpses and smoking rubble: 12,000 people would remain of a prewar population of over 100,000 ! The siege of Saragossa became known in whole Europe.\n\nApprox. 150 Polish infantrymen and 11 French dragoons repulsed a strong British-Spanish force at Fuengirola. The Poles captured British battery. The 82nd Foot attempted to retake the guns. The Poles fired a volley and charged with bayonets. The 82nd broke and fled, joining the 89th Foot in their flight to the boats. The Poles then loaded the captured cannons with British ammunition and bombarded the enemy on the beach. William Napier writes, \"He (Lord Blayney) was immediately made prisoner; his troops again fled to the beach ...\"\n\nAlthough the Vistula Uhlans distinguished themselves in many battles and combats, the most known in English-speaking world is their charge at Albuera. Albuera was the bloodiest battle of the Peninsular War (1807-1814). It ended as something of a draw with awesome casaulties on both sides. Sir Beresford was severely criticised for his leadership during the battle. The charge of the Polish Vistula Uhlans and French cavalry was \"one of the most successful cavalry charges of the entire Napoleonic era\" (- Guy Dempsey) Six British colors were captured (5 by the Poles and 1 by the French) Four Colors were complete and two reduced to the flagstaff.\n\nDespite the great performance in many engagements the Poles were unhappy with their deployment in Spain. It was far away from their homeland and had nothing to do with their own fight for independence.\n\nVast majority of the Poles was withdrawn from Spain when Napoleon began his preparations for the invasion of Russia in 1812. The infantry of Vistula Legion under General Chlopicki was strengthened with one regiment (4th of VL) and formed infantry division commanded by French General Claparede. The division was attached to the Imperial Guard. The Division of Duchy of Warsaw (4th, 7th and 9th Infantry Regiment) became 28th Infantry Division under French General Girard, in Marshal Victor's IX Army Corps.\n\nPs.\n\nMeanwhile the 5th Infantry Regiment formed the garrisons of Czestochowa in Poland and Kostrin in Prussia. The 11th and 12th Infantry Regiment were part of French garrison of Danzig (Gdansk).\n\n1812 - Invasion of Russia. \"The Second Polish War.\"\n\nThe Poles formed the largest of the contingents\n\nprovided by any of the states allied with France.\n\n.\n\nOne of the two or three major causes of the war with Russia in 1812 was the existence of the Duchy of Warsaw. Napoleon called the campaign, the \"second Polish war.\" (The Tzar demanded that the word \"Poles\" be not used in public documents, that Polish orders be abolished and that the Polish army be considered as a part of that of Saxony.)\n\nIn June of 1812, Poniatowski together with 100,000 of his fellow Poles were part of Napoleon's expedition. They formed the largest of the contingents provided by any of the states allied with France. The dispersion, however, of the Polish regiments among the various French corps was strongly resented.\n\nMultinationality of Napoleon's Grand Army\n\nduring the invasion of Russia in 1812:\n\n- 250,000 Frenchmen\n\n100,000 Poles (+ 8,000 Poles in Austrian corps included below)\n\n- 15,000 Dutch\n\n- 10,000 Belgians\n\n- 21,000 Italians from Kingdom of Italy\n\n- 7,000 Italians from annexed Piedmont, Liguria, Tuscany, Genoa, Parma and Rome\n\n- 7,000 Italians from Naples\n\n- 35,000 Austrians *\n\n- 4,000 from Illiria and Dalmatia\n\n- 4,000 Spaniards\n\n- 3,000 Croats (+ 2,500 Croats in Austrian corps included below)\n\n- 2,000 Portuguese\n\n- 30,000 Bavarians\n\n- 25,000 Prussians\n\n- 22,000 Saxons\n\n- 22,000 Westphalians\n\n- 12,000 Wuerttembergers\n\n- 5,000 Germans from annexed North Germany and left bank of the Rhine River\n\n- 5,000 Baden\n\n- 3,000 Berg\n\n- 3,000 Hessians\n\n- 2,000 Mecklenburg\n\n- 4,000 from various small members of Rhine Confederation\n\n- 9,000 Swiss\n\n* - the Austrian corps consited of several nationalities:\n\n8,000 Poles, 2,500 Czechs, 2,500 Croats, 10,000 German Austrians\n\nand 12,000 Hungarians, Slovaks, Serbs and Romanians. In 1812 the Polish troops carried the fame of Polish heroism along the same roads which two and three centuries before, in the times of King Stefan Batory and King Wladyslav IV saw the Polish banners of the White Eagle in a triumphant march to Moscow. The memories of Hetman Zolkiewski and Gosiewski came back.\n\nAt Czerepowo General Rozniecki \"orders the Polish troops to halt, forms up in square and reminds us that we're standing at the limit of the Jagellons' and Batory's one-time empire. After painting for us the heroic aspects of our nation's glorious past he invites all present to dismount and pick up a little dust so as to be able to remind our descendants of this glorious event which has brought us back to Poland's former linits.\" (Britten-Austin - \"1812 The March on Moscow\" p 234)\n\nThe Poles foght with a great zeal at Smolensk, Borodino, Beresina Crossing, Polotzk, Krasne, Viazma and Borisov. Britten-Austin writes, \"Some units, perhaps many, are mortified to find their exploits have escaped official notice. To his left had seen the 7th Hussars make a brilliant charge against Russian ainfantry and cavalry, and only lose a few men in so doing. 'A short way away to our left,' writes Dupuy 'the 9th Polish Lancers [Uhlans ?] pierced a square of Muscovite chasseurs and wiped it out.' To Thirion it had seemed 'these men [Poles] had become fighting mad. How many didn't I see who, with arm or leg bandaged, returned to the scrum at a flat-out gallop, forcefully eluding those of their comrades who tried to hold them back.\" (Britten-Austin - \"1812 The March on Moscow\" p 136)\n\nThe initial period of the offensive however was wasted. Poniatowski was placed under the direction of Napoleon's incompetent brother Jerome, who criticized by Napoleon eventually left, but for Poniatowski, then put in charge of Grande Armee's right wing, it was too late to make up for the lost opportunities. Later on St. Helena, the dethroned emperor reflected back on the 1812 war with Russia and expressed his belief, that if he had given Poniatowski Jerome's right wing command from the beginning, Bagration's army would have been destroyed early, and the campaign would have followed a different course.\n\nNapoleon won at Smolensk and Borodino. The battle of Borodino was the bloodiest battle of Napoleonic Wars. Few weeks later Napoleon entered Moscow. The Tzar however refused to sue for peace.\n\nDuring the winter retreat from Russia Napoleon's army ceased to exist. Of the 680,500 men that Napoleon had organized for his invasion of Russia, barely 93,000 remained !\n\nPolish forces consisted of less than 10.000 men. The splendid Vistula Legion had only 500 survivors. William Napier writes, \"Napoleon, unconquered of man, had been vanquished by the elements. The fires and the snows of Moscow combined had shattered his strength, and in confessed madness nations and rulers rejoiced that an enterprise, at once the grandest and most provident, the most beneficial ever attempted by a warrior-statement, had been foiled - they rejoiced that Napoleon had failed to reestablish unhappy Poland as a barrier against the most formidable and brutal, the most swinish tyranny that has ever menaced and disgraced European civilization.\" (Napier - Vol IV, p 167)\n\nNot only the troops suffered during the campaign, the Polish populace fared not better. \"Against the promised reconstruction of their state, most Poles went to extraordinary lengths to accommodate the Grand Army passing through their territories. ... the march into and out of Russia cleaned the house, only the fittest survived. Thus, the decimated remnants [of the Grand Army], particularly those of the Polish cavalry, who were familiar with the country, climate, and language, became the safe-conduct of what was left of the main army group. They served with distinction at Smolensk and Borodino and played a major role in making the crossing of the Beresina possible.\" (Riehn - \"1812: Napoleon's Russian Campaign\" pp 70-71)\n\nColor map of the Battle of Smolensk, 1812.\n\n1813 - Leipzig Campaign\n\nThough the ranks of Poniatowski's troops were thinned,\n\ntheir determination was strong.\n\n.\n\nThe Russian armies crossed the Vistula River at several points. Warsaw and other Polish cities fell to them. Poniatowski began withdrawing across Poland \"as Schwarzenberg's perfidious maneuvers exposed him to the approaching Russians. His 8.000 army was joined by about 6.000 light cavalry...\" (Nafziger and Wesolowski - \"Poles and Saxons of the Napoleonic Wars\" p 22)\n\nPoniatowski's V Army Corps, or rather what was left from this splendid formation, moved to Krakow. The Prince reorganized his troops and raised them to the strength of 12,000 men.\n\nMeanwhile \"The Tzar presented himself as a liberator to the people and his representation made great progress in Germany. However, the spirit of the Poles remained unsettled. Tzar Alexander sought to neutralize the ill perception the Polish people had of him and, while Poniatoiwski and the supreme Polish government found itself in Krakow, Alexander called Prince Antoni Radziwill, on the pretext of family affairs, to move to Krakow and attempt to subvert the fidelity of the Poles. He was to propose that the Duchy of Warsaw assume a neutral stance for the duration of the war and that Poniatowski unite all the Polish troops in Zamosc fortress to await events. Radziwill's mission was a thorny affair. He feared the surveillance of the Minister of France, Bignon, who watched his movements. Poniatowski's faithfulness was well known. Radziwill made no attempt to approach the Prince directly. However, he sounded the attitudes of several members of the Polish government, emboldened them bit by bit, communicated his propositions to people that he thought the least likely to be repelled by his proposals to abandon their alliance with France and had decided to approach Poniatowski about accepting proposals that would allow Poland an independent political existence.\n\nThe Prince was torn between his military duty and the apparent interests of his country, which seemed to exist in a new alliance. However, he then realized that Poland could not await the regeneration of the same powers that had divided it and then become their tributary. He put his entire confidence in the fortunes of Napoleon and remained unshakable.\" (- Roman Soltyk)\n\n\"The last act of independent will was carried out in the Duchy's behalf by Jozef Poniatowski. Refusing offers of clemency from the Russians, he determined to fight to the last at Napoleon's side. He gathered the reserves of his army together and retreated into Germany.\" (- Davies, Vol II, p 304) The Tzar and the King of Prussia met at Kalisz and concluded an alliance against Napoleon. The Russian and Prussian armies crossed the Odra River, while the French evacuated Berlin.\n\nNapoleon had occupied himself with great activity in the reorganization of a new army, which he then led into Germany. Napoleon had ordered Poniatowski to move into Saxony via Moravia and Bohemia. Poniatowski's force consisted of 12,000 men organized in 6 infantry and 8 cavalry regiments. The Polish cavalry was well mounted and very useful to the French army, which was, overall, lacking in this arm.\n\nIn July Polish infantry and artillery had allowance for exercises in life fire training and shooting competitions. According to Mariusz Lukasiewicz's \"Armia Ksiecia Jozefa\" (p 215) the best shooters were awarded with 20 francs each. Near Zittau in Saxony Prince Poniatowski ordered intensive and large scale \"war games\" for his troops. The quarters were excellent and the food was pretty good. Many soldiers received new uniforms, shoes, shirts, and headwears.\n\nMorale of the troops was very high despite of lack of weapons. According to General Sokolnicki only 20 % of men in IV Cavalry Corps had carbines. The average cavalryman was armed with lance, saber and one pistol.\n\nIn May 1813 Napoleon formed so-called Grenadier Corps, which became part of the French Guard. It consisted of three battalions; the 1st Battalion of Poles, 2nd of Saxons and 3rd of Westphalians. It was Napoleon's attempt to establish closer ties to the Poles and Germans.\n\nThe 8th Lancers (ex Vistula Uhlans) led one of the grand cavalry charges at Dresden, the second largest battle of Napoleonic Wars.\n\nOn 18 June, 1813, a Vistula Infantry Regiment was organized from the remnants of the Vistula Legion. It consisted of only two battalions. On 15 September the Legion fought the Russians in a bloody engagement at Neustadt (near Dresden).\n\nThe Poles distinguished themselves at Dennewitz and Lepzig, the largest battle of Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon's fate was sealed during the three-day battle for Leipzig, although the sheer bravery of his troops allowed the French army to extricate itself from complete destruction. Majority of Polish soldiers were either killed, wounded or taken prisoner, others wandered back to Poland. Only few followed the French.\n\nPrince Poniatowski, the commander-in-chief of Polish army, was killed while covering Napoleon's retreat and the \"... Poles constituted the last formed body of French troops\" (Digby-Smith - \"1813: Leipzig\")\n\nThe battle of Leipzig was Poles' last chance, last hope,\n\nand they fought very, very hard. Casualties :\n\n- Polish casualties were 7.500 or 62 % (!) of their forces\n\n- Prussian losses were 15.500 or 20 % of their forces\n\n- Russian losses were 20.000 or 13 % of their forces\n\n- Austrian losses 7.500 or 7 % of their forces\n\n- Swedish casualties 400 men or 2 % of their forces\n\nDeath of Poniatowski at Leipzig.\n\nContesting every step with the overwhelming forces of his pursuers,\n\nPoniatowski refused to surrender, and covered with wounds plunged\n\ninto the Elster River. There he died.\n\n1814 - Campaign in France.\n\nWhen informed of the French surrender\n\nthe Vistula Regiment nearly mutined.\n\n.\n\nIn December 1813 Napoleon formed so-called Polish Corps,\n\nit consisted of the following troops (strength on 1st January 1814):\n\n- Krakus Regiment\n\n- 1st Uhlan Regiment (530 men + 399 horses)\n\n- 2nd Uhlan Regiment (530 men + 336 horses)\n\n- Vistula Infantry Regiment (854 men in 2 battalions)\n\n- four companies of foot artillery (520 men)\n\n- company of horse artillery (125 men + 47 horses)\n\n- sapper company (68 men)\n\nThere were also other Polish troops in France:\n\n- 4th, 8th and 16th Uhlan Regiment\n\n- 1st Horse Chasseur Regiment\n\n- 13th Hussar Regiment\n\n- 3rd Guard Eclaireur Regiment\n\n- 1st Old Guard Lancer Regiment\n\nThe Polish troops distinguished themselves at Soissons, St.Dizier, Arcis-sur-Aube and Paris. The Polish troops in Paris consisted of small part of the superb Old Guard Lancers, three field batteries (18 guns) and the 3rd Guard Eclaireurs.\n\nAt Arcis sur Aube in 1814 Napoleon took refuge in square formed by the Vistula Infantry. \"Colbert's (cavalry) division, which was received by the fire of the light batteries ranged along the front of Frimont's squadrons, and at the same time Kaizarow's Cossacks, supported by e regiment of Austrian hussars, charged home against the right flank of the light cavalry of the Imperial Guard. The cry sauve qui peut was raised in the ranks, and Colbert's horsemen fled in panic on to the front of Exelmans' division, which was in second line. The lancers and dragoons gave way under the shock, and in a confused mass the two divisions fled at full gallop towards Arcis, with the Cossacks in hot pursuit.\n\nNapoleon was at Torcy when he heard the sound of the guns; he set off for Arcis at a gallop, followed only by a few officers and a small escort. As he reached the town he was met by the mixed mass of French and allied cavalry; he drew his sword and managed to take refuge in the square of the (Polish) Vistula Legion battalion. The bayonets of the Poles stopped the hussars and the Cossacks, and their fire drove them back.\" (Houssaye - \"Napoleon and the campaign of 1814\" pp 249-250, publ. in London 1914)\n\nThe fortress of Soissons was defended by a very weak garrison: 792 men of Vistula infantry, 80 eclaireurs, 20 French guns and 300 French municipal guardsmen. The overall command was in the hands of GdB Moreau. Napoleon ordered him to hold his position at all costs. On 1st March numerous Prussian and Russian troops arrived before Soissons. The next day they bombarded the town and stormed the ramparts. It was a bloody day. Approx. 300 men of Vistula Regiment \"attacked them with such impetus that they were pushed out of the suburb, far into the surrounding fields.\" (Nafziger - \"Poles and Saxons of the Napoleonic Wars\" p 129)\n\nIn the evening an emissary arrived with a call to surrender. During a war council Moreau and the commander of Vistula Regiment voted categorically against capitulation. Soon another emissary arrived with stronger worded ultimatum threatening to put the garrison to the sword and sack the town. Moreau agreed to capitulate.\n\nWhen informed of this the Vistula Regiment nearly mutined. The Allies were in such a hurry that at 3 pm two battalions entered the town and found themselves facing the angry Vistula Regiment. The commander of the Poles told the allies general to leave for another hour or he would start shooting ! The Allies general quickly agreed. At 4 pm the garrison departed Soissons with its weapons, receiving military honors. Allies generals asked Moreau why he didn't order his division to march after the vanguard, Moreau replied that this was his entire force. The Vistula Regiment was awarded by Napoleon with 23 crosses of Legion d'Honneur for its actions at Soissons. The Legion then went on to fight at the battle at St. Dizier.\n\nAfter the fall Paris Napoleon gave up fighting and decided to abdicate. \"General Krasinski who commanded the Polish Guard lancers ... came forward with his officers. As he took his leave of the Emperor he uttered these words, which do the greatest credit to his nation: Sire, if you had mounted the throne of Poland, you would have been killed upon it; but the Poles would have died at your feet to a man.\" (- Charles Parquin, French officer).\n\nFew Poles stayed in France, some even went with the Emperor on Elba Island, while the majority returned to Poland.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1815.\n\n.\n\nThere were few Polish units in French service during the Waterloo Campaign. The Elba Squadron under Jerzmanowski became the I squadron of Red Lancers. They probably formed Napoleon's escort and fought at Quatre Bras and at Waterloo. The 7th Lancer Regiment under Adam Huppe numbered 8 officers and 252 other ranks but lacked horses. On 2 July the lancers fought on foot in the defense of the bridges in Sevres earning Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's praise. Infantry regiment was organized. On 23 April it numbered only 15 officers and 310 other ranks. It was enough for one battalion.\n\nOn 29 June, near Rambouillet, the Poles (7th Lancers) met Napoleon for the last time."
