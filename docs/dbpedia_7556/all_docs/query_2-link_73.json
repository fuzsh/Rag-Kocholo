        "text": "Jan Chełmiński, also known as Jan van Chelminski, born Jan Władysław Chełmiński, was a Polish painter.\n\nChełmiński entered the Munich Academy of Fine Arts on 14 April 1875 (Register: 3144) and worked throughout Europe. From 1895 he lived in New York, though in 1893 he had taken out British citizenship.\n\nHe married twice. After divorcing his first wife, Marie Henschel (1858–?), he married Leonie Knoedler, sister of Roland Knoedler, of the famous New York art dealership, Knoedler.\n\nChełmiński was best known in his lifetime for his historical works, especially those dealing with military history and the Napoleonic Wars."
