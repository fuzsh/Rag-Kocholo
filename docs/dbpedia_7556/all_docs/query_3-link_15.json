        "text": "Jozef Antoni Poniatowski was born in Vienna on 7th of May 1763. He was the son of Andrzej Poniatowski and Countess Maria Theresia Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettaunephew, who was a lady at the court of Maria Theresa.\n\nPoniatowski was thus a nephew of King Stanislaus Augustus of Poland, who became his official guardian when his father (a field marshal in the Austrian army) died when he was ten. Despite these Polish connections, the young Poniatowski spent the majority of his first 25 years in Vienna, where he learned to speak French, German, Polish and Russian. He was a passionate musician and would later take a portable keyboard with him on military campaign.\n\nHaving decided on a military career, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Austrian Imperial Army at the age of 17. Within six years, he had reached the rank of colonel and in 1788 he became an aide-de-camp to the Emperor Joseph II. He fought during the war with the Ottoman Empire and distinguished himself at the Battle of Šabac.\n\nPoniatowski had a very close relationship with his uncle Stanislaus Augustus. He had represented the Polish king at Maria Theresa’s funeral, and had accompanied his uncle to Russia to meet Catherine the Great. The ultimate result of this closeness was Poniatowski chose to count himself a Polish citizen and transferred to the Polish army in 1789. He became a major-general and was given command of a division in Ukraine. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the reforms of Constitution of the 3rd of May.\n\nPoniatowski became a lieutenant-general in 1792 and was tasked with defending Ukraine against imminent Russian attack. The Polish forces were massively outnumbered and forced to retreat but Poniatowski fought doggedly with every step. Falling back on Warsaw and preparing for a major fight, he was aghast to hear that his Uncle had acceded to the pro-Russian Targowica Confederation, soon followed by the Second Partition of Poland. In protest, he and a number of other Polish generals resigned their commissions.\n\nPrince Jozef was an outspoken Polish patriot, implacably opposed to Russian occupation, and he remained immensely popular with the army. Consequently, the Russians wanted him as far away from the country as possible. The king pressured his nephew to comply. He first went to his mother in Vienna and then journeyed further west. In letters, he castigated his uncle for his weakness; telling him that he should have risen up and led the country against its oppressors.\n\nHe returned in 1794 to take part in the Kościuszko Insurrection, but when this failed his Polish lands were confiscated. He was ordered to accept a position in the Russian army and demonstrate his loyalty. Once more he refused to accept Russian authority and once more he was ordered out of Poland; returning to Vienna again.\n\nWhen his uncle died in Russia in 1798, Poniatowski travelled to St Petersburg to see to his uncle’s legal affairs. His stay there established an amicable relationship with Tsar Paul and so he was able to return to his estates in Poland. For the next few years he had no active military duties and lived a private life of occasionally-scandalous partying. Among his guests were the future Louis XVIII.\n\nNapoleon’s victory at Jena meant that the Prussians had to evacuate Poland and towards the end of the year Marshal Murat rode trimphantly into Warsaw. Murat and Poniatowski were at once taken with each other and established a firm friendship, with Murat declaring Poniatowski to be chief of the Polish military forces, bypassing several more senior candidates. In January 1807 he was made the Polish Minister of War by Napoleon, despite scepticism from Davout.\n\nSeeing in Napoleon the future for Polish independance, Poniatowski loyally served the French emperor over the next few years. He successful fought off the invasion from Austria in 1809, stationing himself in Kraków at the end of the year to make it clear to Austrian forces that the city would not be returning to their hands.\n\nIn 1811, Poniatowski attended the baptism of Napoleon II in Paris and, while there, was involved with drawing up plans for the Russian invasion. He tried to advise Napoleon to take the warmer, more southern route through Ukraine but Napoleon ultimately rejected his suggestions.\n\nDuring the Russian Campaign, Poniatowski commanded V Corps in the Grande Armee. He was initially under Jerome Bonaparte’s command, but when Napoleon’s younger brother left, the Pole became commander of the army’s right wing. He distinguished himself in numerous battles, include Smolensk, Borodino and Vinkovo; where he saved Murat’s forces. He was badly injured during the retreat and was forced to give up his command.\n\nPoniatowksi devoted himself to rebuilding Polish forces after the retreat, once more refusing peace overtures from the Russians. In May 1813 his forces mobilised once again and became VIII Corps. They won several initial victories, but then came Leipzig. It would be Poniatowski’s last battle.\n\nAs a reward for his services during the opening day of the battle, Napoleon rewarded Poniatowski with his marshal’s baton. He was tasked with covering the retreat and sustained numerous serious wounds in the action, as well as losing half his men.\n\nPoniatowski’s remaining forces fell back on the river. The French had prematurely blown the bridge and left them stranded (alongside Marshal Macdonald and his men) between the powerful river and the rapidly-approaching enemy forces. Despite being so badly wounded that he could no longer hold his sword, surrender was unthinkable to Poniatowski. He rode his horse into the river hoping, like Macdonald, to make it to the other side.\n\nThe current was very strong and while Marshal Macdonald was able to swim to safety, Poniatowski was not so lucky. He was swept away and, too weak to fight the strength of the river, eventually drowned. There are differing accounts of his last words, but they all agree on one thing: his last thoughts were for Poland.\n\nHe had been a Marshal of the Empire for only three days.\n\nHis body was recovered and in 1817 his remains were transported to Poland and buried in the cathedral on Kraków’s Wawel Hill. A romantic cult began, painting Poniatowski as a ‘Polish Bayard’ and making him Poland’s equivalent of Napoleon. He became the focus of a vast amount of poetry, sculpture and art, showcased as a “eternally young commander in chief” (he was 50 when he died) and characterised by chivalry and daring.\n\nHe became the inspiration for numerous Polish freedom fighter thereafter, including 1830. A Polish bomber squad was named in his honour during WW2.\n\nAlthough he never married, Poniatowski did have two illegitimate children and has descendants still alive today. Mexican journalist Elena Poniatowska is one of these."
