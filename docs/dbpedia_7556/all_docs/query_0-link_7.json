        "text": "Many in Western New York are remembering the bi-centennial of the War of 1812 and the 150th anniversary of the American Civil War but few may realize that 200 years ago the Wars of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte were drawing to a close. And so was an effort by Prince Josef Poniatowski and the Polish people to restore their homeland to its rightful place among independent nations.\n\nJosef Anton Poniatowski was born in Vienna, Austria on May 7, 1763, the son of Andrzej Poniatowski, a field marshal in the service of Austria and Theresa von Kinsky, a lady in the court of Maria Theresa. His father died when Josef was 10 and Stanislaw August then became his guardian. Josef spent some time with his mother in Prague but later moved to Warsaw living with his uncle Stanislaw August Poniatowski, the last King of Poland.\n\nBrought up in \"high society,\" Josef was tutored in French, Polish and German and learned how to play keyboard instruments, such as the piano. As expected he was trained for a military career, but it was because of Stanislaw August's influence that Poniatowski chose to consider himself a Polish citizen. Josef joined the Austrian army in 1780 commissioned as a lieutenant and in 1786 he was promoted to colonel. In 1788, he was promoted again and became an aide-de-camp to Emperor Joseph II. Poniatowski fought in the wars with the Ottoman Empire and distinguished himself at the storming of Sabac on April 25, 1788, where he was seriously wounded.\n\nSummoned by his uncle, King Stanislaw August Poniatowski, Prince Josef immigrated to Poland to reorganize its army. In October 1789, together with Tadeusz Kosciuszko (a colonel in the American Continental Army and architect of the fortifications at West Point, New York) and three others, Poniatowski received the rank of major general. From 1789 to 1795 Prince Poniatowski and the Polish armies fought valiantly to keep Russia from conquering their country only to be undermined by the surrender of Poland by its own government. This period of struggle, insurrection and revolt led to the final Partition of Poland in 1795 among Russia, Prussia and Austria.\n\nFor the next 10 years Josef led an idle private life of aristocracy spending time in Poland, Austria, Russia, and France. All of this changed when Napoleon and the Grande Armee pushed the Prussians out of Poland. Instead of reviving the ancient kingdom, Napoleon, not wanting to offend Russia, established the Grand Duchy of Warsaw in 1806. This however, did not keep the people of Poland or Prince Josef Anton Poniatowski from trying to regain Polandâs independence.\n\nOn Jan. 2, 1807 Poniatowski was appointed commander of the 1st Polish Legion in French service. Emperor Napoleon appointed the Warsaw Governing Commission and by March of 1809 Prince Josef Poniatowski became commander and Chief of the Army. He was devoted to the creation and development of this new, ostentatiously Polish army. His army existed under difficult circumstances and its success depended largely on the military and political skills of its commander. For the defense of the Polish homeland Prince Josef had a rather small force at his disposal but skillfully led his countrymen in battle during the War of 1809 and ultimately occupied Krakow.\n\nThe ensuing military campaigns of Napoleon demonstrated the military skills of Prince Poniatowski and the fighting spirit of the Polish army. Fighting, with distinction at the Battles of Raszyn, near Warsaw, Wagram near Vienna and the Battle of Borodino near Moscow, Prince Poniatowski and the Polish army hoped this dedication would persuade Napoleon to reinstate Polandâs independence.\n\nIn 1812, Poniatowski was given command of the V Corps (Polish) of the Grande Armee during the Moscow Campaign and fought with distinction at the battle of Borodino, he was wounded at Berezina in November of that year. In 1813, Josef was now to command the VIII Corp (Polish) of the Grande Armee fighting at Lobau, Altenburg, Chemnitz, Penig, and Leipzig.\n\nJosef Poniatowskiâs skills and bravery did not go unnoticed and on October 16, 1813, Emperor Napoleon made Poniatowski a Marshal of France, the highest military honor a commanding officer could achieve. During the Battle of Nations, Leipzig, Marshal Poniatowski was responsible for covering the retreat of the French Army from Leipzig. The Polish soldiers heroically defended the French retreat, losing half their corps in the attempt. Marshal Poniatowski and the VIII Corps backed slowly through the city to a bridge over the River Elster.\n\nIn the confusion of battle, the French prematurely blew up the bridge before Poniatowski and his Polish troops could reach it. Stuck on the wrong side of the river Prince Josef and his men refused to surrender and tried to escape. Despite four wounds, Prince Josef Poniatowski plunged into the river hoping to cross; he drowned on Oct. 19, 1813.\n\nAfter his death, a cult-like following developed around the legend of Prince Poniatowski. In 1817, Poniatowskiâs remains were eventually transported back to Poland and buried in the cathedral at Krakowâs Wawel Hill, where he lies beside Thaddeus Kosciuszko, an American hero. In 1829, a monument to Prince Poniatowski was placed in Warsaw but was destroyed during World War II. A more recent copy now stands before the presidential palace in Warsaw. Though he never married Josef did have two sons. One of his living relatives is Elena Poniatowska, a famous Mexican journalist.\n\nWith the death of Prince Poniatowski, the loss of thousands of Polish soldiers and Napoleonâs abdication of his throne, Polandâs\n\nhopes of independence and self-rule would have to wait another 100 years until 1918. This being the 200th anniversary of his death, Prince Josef Anton Poniatowski a Polish leader, politician and army chief who became a Marshal of the French Empire deserves to be remembered by all. This hero embellishes the sprit, dedication; hard work and patriotism of the Polish people, so let us not forget him!"
