Sodagreen inspired by capital visits

Taiwan folk-pop band Sodagreen will give concerts on every weekend in September. While performing earlier hits, the band will also bring new songs from its latest album, Autumn: Beijing Story, which was inspired by trips to the capital during the past few years. Formed in 2001, Sodagreen is composed of vocalist Greeny Wu Qing-feng, acoustic guitarist A-Fu Ho Ching-yang, electric guitarist Kay Liu Chia-kai, bassist Claire Hsieh Hsing-i, percussionist Wei Shih Chun-wei, and Zephyr Kung Yu-chi on keyboard and viola. Since then the band has built up a devout following in Asia and twice won the Taiwan Golden Melody Awards for Best Band.
