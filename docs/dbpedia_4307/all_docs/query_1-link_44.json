        "text": "I’m not a coffee drinker but since it was a cool day I decided to get myself a big cup of cappuccino. 9 hours later, I still feel pretty much awake so I decided to write something to kill time. You already know that I’m a drama addict and my imaginings are filled with it. So here I am on my bed thinking about my favorite drama team ups. Who does that? Weird…I know! I wonder if you object with my choices or agree with them…\n\nSo without further ado here they are in random order.\n\n1.Chen Qiao En and Mingdao (Prince Turns Into a Frog 2005)\n\nMy MingEn couple! He was the suave hotel CEO Shan Jun Hao while she was the money worshiping lower class girl Ye Tian Yu. Their first encounter was unpleasant but an accident caused SJH to have amnesia and not knowing who he is, he ended up staying with TY’s family. The arrogant guy eventually turned into a hardworking and kind man whom TY fell in love with. It was their first team up and the drama went on to become the highest rated idol drama in Taiwan’s history.They just click like that! They collaborated in many projects since then including Ying Yi 3+1, Let’s Dance, Beauties of the Emperor. Theirs is a beautiful professional partnership. The amazing chemistry they have on screen however, never translated into real life.\n\n2.Ariel Lin and Joseph Cheng (It Started With A Kiss 2005)\n\nWho could ever forget that kiss in the rain? Or the stolen kiss Jiang Zhi Shu gave a sleeping Yuan Xiang Qin? Or that agonizing and embarrassing moment when she mustered enough courage to give him “the” love letter. Their personalities can’t be anymore diffirent yet they were perfect for each other. The drama became so popular that They Kissed Again (get it?).They worked together in another drama Love or Bread(2008) and proved that the tandem is solid.They haven’t collaborated since then and I desperately want to see them together in a drama once again.\n\n3.Yoon Eun Hye and Joo Ji Hoon (Goong 2006)\n\nThe mythical Crown Prince of imperial South Korea Lee Shin fell in love with an ordinary high school girl,Shin Chae Kyung, whom he was betrothed to. He was cool, famous and smart. She was messy,unrefined and stupid. But her cuteness and good heart won him over.Their’s was a cute dog-cat sort of relationship that eventually turned into love. It was the first foray into acting of then newbie Baby VOX member Yoon Eun Hye and first team-up with Joo Ji Hoon. Many fans protested about their casting but were proven wrong by their irresistible tandem.\n\n4.Tang Yan and Wallace Huo (Chinese Paladin 3 2009)\n\nUntil now I still can’t get over their parting in Chinese Paladin 3 and… that song! The mere thought makes my heart heavy. I guess I just have a thing for undying love. Theirs was a doomed relationship from the very beginning which took them 3 lifetimes to finally accept. Even the gods were against them! She was a descendant of the goddess Nuwa (Zi Xuan) while he is a monk who is destined for immortality (Xu Chang Qing/Gu Liu Fang/Lin Ye Ping) but she was “the” distraction that’s keeping him from attaining it. Doomed and all, I was still rooting for them till the very end. They are indeed a Perfect Couple (2014).\n\n5.Ady An and Vanness Wu (Autumn’s Concerto 2010)\n\nIt was the biggest drama that year and for good reason. Despite the cliche and predictability of it’s story, Ady and Vanness‘ chemistry was so good it was crazy! This is a good example of mediocre story but incredible OTP. I think it was that which carried the entire show through it’s ratings glory. Seeing the two of them together plus their adorable kid Xiao Xiao Bin on screen gave me a warm feeling. They felt like an authentic family.\n\n6.Inoue Mao and Jun Matsumoto (Hana Yori Dango 2005)\n\nHe’s the quintessential rich, handsome, popular, spoiled kid with a temper to boot! She’s the hardworking, good-hearted, strong and plain looking outsider. Two wonderful characters from a classic manga series. They are the Japanese version Tsukasa Domyoji and Makino Tsukushi who’s love story was like Cinderella and Prince Charming who beat the odds together despite their wide status gap. He sacrificed so much just to be with her and she fought just to have him back. Matsu Jun and Inoue Mao have amassed solid shippers who support them till this very day.\n\n7.Baifern Pimchanok and Mario Maurer (Crazy Little Thing Called Love 2010)\n\nNot a from a drama but a movie. I just had to include this. It totally caught me off guard. I wasn’t ready to fall in love with it but I did! How could I not? When I could pretty much relate to the story of an unpopular high-school nobody (P’Nam) who carries a torch for the handsome “it” guy on campus (P’Shon) all the way from 7th grade to 9th grade. And talk about chemistry! Theirs was off the charts! Watching it was like a trip down memory lane with a bonus. Mario Maurer is one heck of a looker!\n\n8.Lee Yo Won and Kim Nam Gil (Queen Seon Deok 2009)\n\nBet you didn’t expect this choice! Didn’t you? Nobody thought that Bi Dam will steal the thunder from General Yoo Shin with his insubordinate ways along with Queen Seon Deok‘s heart. It was a love line that (almost) came out of nowhere but so damn effective I was on board when it started sailing. I mean, that final scene when Bi Dam died calling Seon Deok by name and she was trying so hard not to run to him. I cried a river and cursed the writers for killing him off like that. But I know it has to be that way.\n\n9.Liu Shi shi and Nicky Wu (Bu Bu King Xin 2011)\n\nChemistry.These two knocked it out of the ball park! I bet nobody expected that Nicky Wu who played 4th prince Yin Zhen and Liu Shi shi as Martai Ruo Xi would have this magic between them thus making the series into a phenomenon and propelling their individual careers up. They even got best couple award left and right not just in the mainland but other parts of the world. If that is not reason enough for their super hot chemistry, I don’t know that is. But such sad fate. But maybe there’ll be a happily-ever-after in its (supposed) sequel Bu Bu Jing Qing.\n\nIf you are a wuxia series lover (like me) you would definitely know that another one of Jin Yong’s well-loved novels is getting a reboot next year. I said another one, meaning two of them are in the works. There is the much talked about ROTCH with Chen Xiao which is a part of a trilogy which are Legend of the Condor Heroes, Return of the Condor Heroes and Dragon Saber and Heavenly Sword, all of which have been adapted and retold a few times over. My personal favorite though is Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils 天龙八部. A bad-ass, expansive, emotionally gripping series, it’ll take you on a roller coaster ride. I have seen the 2003 version with Hu Jun, Jimmy Lin, Gao Hu and Liu Yi Fei which became partly responsible for my wuxia love affair. So I was jumping up and down when I heard news of its remake early this year. I was even more happy that the amazing Wallace Chung will be headlining it. I think he’s perfect for the role of Beggar Sect leader Qiao Feng. The other two pivotal characters are Shaolin Monk Xu Zhu who will be played by Han Dong and Dali Prince Duan Yu will be played by Korean actor Kim Kibum. My initial reaction to the latter’s casting was unpleasant, however Lemon Zhang Meng who’s playing Wang Yu Yan is a pint size cutie, so I thought they would be a good match.\n\nIn the 2003 version, Duan Yu‘s 3 sisters fell in love with him because they didn’t know that they were siblings at first and he ended up with Wang Yu Yan. Even Shaolin Monk Xu Zhu got his happy ending but Qiao Feng did not. His first love A Zhu (Liu Tao) died helping him while younger sister A Zi (Chen Hao) who’s in love with him, died for him. Remember that part when they jumped off the cliff? Well, technically he jumped with her in his arms. Sigh. This new version however is based on the third revision of the novel so we will definitely see a few changes here and there. I’m not a spoilsport so I won’t spoil the fun.\n\nRegarding the trailer. One thought. Spectacular. The special effects are tastefully made and not overly done like those RPG ones that are coming out next year. Gotta hand it to the production team.\n\nYou know what’s funny? When you try to reason with yourself to chAnge what you have already decided not to do but in reality you’re itching to do and winning over yourself in the end. Does that make sense? Let me explain. You see, I promised myself not to write a recap of Marry Him If You Dare. Why? Because I just want to savor it as a viewer and not let the critic in me come out. However, I have reached a consensus amongst myselves (I just sounded bonkers there!) to write a mini-recap slash review.\n\nEpisode 1 Young Mi Rae VS Old Mi Rae\n\nThe Good.\n\nIt was amazingly fast! Like one minute old Mi Rae pops up then warns young Mi Rae to avoid an accident and then the next thing you know their on a plane to Jeju and then back again to Seoul with young MiRae colliding with future husband Kim Shin.But, I like it! Mi Rae’s character was established although the other 3 of the square not. We only got a glimpse of them which I think is right because the story is supposed to come undone slowly through Mi Rae’s own choices. I also love Yoon Eun Hye‘s energy. She’s like a bundle of sunshine. I actually thought that she was acting younger than her real age because her persona seems a lot younger and damn she looks fresh!\n\nThe Bad.\n\nThey could have chosen a better time-travel mode instead of a ridiculously big ticking clock and a vintage elevator but heck I have seen worse! Also it wasn’t clear exactly how it all works. Probably the writers saved it up for later episodes. And my, old Mi Rae’s boots must go to charity and young Mi Rae’s swimsuit straight to the shredder! But nothing beats Kim Shin’s hair. Man, do news anchors in Korea really use that much hair gel? I want to tell the hairstylist to go easy on the hair gel. The animated pop-ups are kinda cute but too cartoonish for my taste. I mean, this is not a high school drama so let’s leave the cutesy-gooey stuff to that other drama over at SBS.\n\nThe Aww Inducing\n\nWhich literally translates to the engineered romantic captures which we drama addicts live for.\n\nThis one’s all Team Se Joo. Voyeurism much! Mi Rae decided to go au naturel at the beach glowing like a sea mermaid while Se Joo is recording the action. Oh but he didn’t intend to! Our guy’s fallen at first sight.\n\nEpisode 2 Kim Shin VS Park Se Joo\n\nOr what I’d like to call the hot-headed prick versus the humble pretender.\n\nThe Good.\n\nAhjummas are beating the younger gens to the pulp! Choi Myoung Gil has a commanding on-screen presence as older Mi Rae and Go Du Shim is crazy funny as YBS president and Se Joo’s grandmother, Lee Mi Ran. Lee Dong Gun, you arrogant a***ol! He’s a prick all right. But he’s so good at it that he’s perfect. Oh I hate his foul-mouthed, unbending persona but I know that’s what the role calls for. We are also getting to see the picture more clearly as to what happened in the future prompting old Mi Rae to come back and change it. The reunion between her and Kim Shin was not good as if there’s bad blood between them. A mystery is always a good thing because as a viewer it makes me want to see more to know what the answer is.\n\nThe (not so) Bad.\n\nDon’t hate me for this Jung Yong Hwa worshipers. I just thought that he needs a little more push in the acting part. I just thought his facial expressions were almost the same. He’s supposed to be pretending to be a normal guy yet I can’t distinguish any difference between the two or maybe it’s because the chaebol persona has not been given enough time to come out thus dissecting his performance is futile. I mean let’s face it, LDG is a veteran compared to him. Han Chae Ah was also short leased here. I didn’t feel her presence in episode 1 nor in this. Perhaps it’s because there wasn’t much for her to work on to begin with.\n\nThe Aww Inducing.\n\nRound 2 for Se Joo again. He got to see the girl on the beach again right under his desk! and now they even get to work with each other. He covers for her when her oppa comes looking and then helps her with the preview editing. After a while the two of them listens to the musical score together sharing one headset sitting on the floor.He even charmed old Mi Rae who obviously thought she was seeing angels.\n\nI actually enjoyed the second episode more than the first so I don’t understand the drop in ratings.Let’s hope next week to see more reveals and better ratings. And can I just say how young looking Yoon Eun Hye is! She looks about the same age as Jung Yong Hwa is some frames.\n\nI remember watching the first film adaptation of Wen Ruian‘s novel series The Four Great Constables 四大名捕 last year which was aptly called The Four. It starred Deng Chao (Cold Blood), Liu Yi Fei (Emotionless), Ronald Cheng (Life snatcher) and Collin Chou (Iron Hands) as the titular characters. I watched it just out of curiosity and afterwards I remember feeling like I got the short end of the stick. It held a lot of promise in the beginning but sort of dwindled somewhere in the middle and gave itself a final shove towards the end. It didn’t help that you can practically compare it to Marvel’s X-men complete with a mind reading, wheelchair wheeling mutant. It’s not all snoozefest though. I like the action sequences and the infusion of wuxia and fantasy but I thought that the movie lacked that which propels a movie towards a satisfying end.\n\nAnyhow, I wasn’t expecting a sequel to come out this soon. The first movie was released just last year and it did okay in the box office both in Hongkong and in the mainland. The Four 2 is in 3D so I expect better special effects. If the people behind this movie paid attention to what Di Renjie: Rise of the Sea Dragon has done, they would know that it relied heavily on 3D special effects and look where it’s at. It’s currently the highest-grossing film this year. and breaking records to boot!\n\nThe Four 2 (which should not be confused with the TV adaptation) still has most of the characters from the first movie including Divine Constabulary’s head Anthony Wong with some notably female additional cast members. Gordon Chan once again directs. According to press release, this version is more tangled, the chase more complicated and the suspense more intense and I suppose this story will also focus not only on the cases and characters’ past demons but on the love angle which was missing in the first movie. It hits theaters on November 22.\n\nCheck out the gorgeous and fashionable photos of some of the cast in an emotion-themed style posters. Can I just say that I love them! If these posters are any indication of how good the movie is, then I’d say sign me up quick."
