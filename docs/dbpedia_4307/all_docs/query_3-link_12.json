        "text": "Seventh season of Chinese television series Singer\n\nSeason of television series\n\nSingerSeason 7Hosted byWu Qing-feng (main show)\n\nHong Tao (Pre-challenge Face-off)\n\nHe Jiong (Grand Finals)Judges500 public audiencesWinnerLiu HuanRunner-upWu Qing-fengFinals venueHunan Broadcasting SystemReleaseOriginal networkHunan TelevisionOriginal releaseJanuary 11 ( ) –\n\nApril 12, 2019 (2019-04-12)Season chronology\n\n← Previous\n\nSeason 6\n\nNext →\n\nSeason 8\n\nThe seventh season of the Chinese television series Singer (Chinese: 歌手; previously titled I Am a Singer) was broadcast on Hunan Television between January and April 2019. Singer 2019 was produced by Hong Tao, and its music director was Hong Kong senior musician Kubert Leung. The first episode was recorded on January 4, 2019, and first premiered in Mango TV on January 11, 2019. YouTube also broadcast the episodes with the results replaced by commercial snippets.[1]\n\nThe season ended on April 12, 2019, and Chinese singer Liu Huan named as the winner. Liu was the first mainland Chinese singer to win since Han Hong in season three, as well as the first male winner since Han Lei in season two. Taiwanese Sodagreen lead singer Wu Qing-feng and Chinese four-member band Super-Vocal (Frank Ju, Ayanga, Cai Chengyu, and ex-member Zheng Yunlong) finished runner-up and third place, respectively. For the first time, the top four singers were all male.[2] This is also the first season since the inaugural season the season ended without the biennial concert held after the final.\n\nLike the previous seasons of I Am a Singer and Singer, Singer 2019 was divided into four rounds of three stages, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The electronic voting feature, first appeared as a pre-voting twist in the previous season, were introduced; the electronic voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. Similar to the previous seasons, the accumulated votes from both Qualifiers and Knockouts determined which singer would be eliminated from the competition. The Challenge round, first introduced in season three, also returned. It featured a rule for contestants to beat at least four out of the seven remaining singers to stay in the competition.\n\nThe announcement of results was also changed: fourteen envelopes displaying the contestants' placements for the current round were placed on the table, among which seven envelopes were named envelopes that had the names of the contestants, and the other seven were numbered envelopes containing placement numbers. One by one, singers were tasked to select one envelope from each category and could view the result alone without the other singers. Singers were given the ability to disclose the results they had viewed—either by bluffing or revealing the actual results—to other contestants as they see fit. While the top four performers were able to receive their information on the placements for the round, the bottom three instead received blank envelopes, similar to season six where the placements were not announced until the Knockouts. The managers also had the option to reveal the electronic voting results.[3][4]\n\nIn terms of song selections, each contestant could only pick their own songs for their first appearance. After each round, if a contestant finished first, the singer may select their own song for next week's show. Additionally, managers or contestants may also survey other performers under isolation, without influencing or impeding other potential contestants.\n\nBeginning from the second round, singers, usually those with higher placements, were given WeChat messages to usher their way to the stage to check envelopes for the bottom three placements. Afterwards, Hong Tao would notify these singers about the safe results for the performance (and in the case of Knockouts, the singers' overall placements) and would sometimes discuss which singer would be eliminated. The remaining singers who did not receive messages would enter the room later, after which Hong Tao would announce the placements for the remaining placements (and in case of overall or challenge placement, the eliminated singer). The electronic voting results, which were also revealed at the end of the show, were announced privately to each singer's respective manager after each performance ended under isolation to other managers with the audio muted.\n\nOrganised by Sina Weibo, an online spin-off called National's Recommended Singer (踢馆赛全民举荐歌手) premiered on December 27, 2018. Similar to I Am a Singer- Who Will Challenge, singers and online viewers can recommend a potential singer. The requirements are to produce one musical composition, be at least 18 years of age, and be available at the scheduled time arranged by producers. During certain periods—usually a week between the recording and airing dates of the Qualifier Round, viewers are polled online to choose their top eligible singer, and the singer with the most votes is chosen as the National's Recommended Singer, who will then join the panel in the Knockouts where they will separately face a challenge against a Professional Challenger (专业踢馆歌手) in a Pre-Challenge Face-off (踢馆预选赛).[5]\n\nHosted by Hong Tao, the face-off was streamed exclusively online concurrently with the current Knockout Round; it was not broadcast on television. The votes cast for the face-off were separate from those of the Knockout round, and the outcome (which would not be revealed until the Challenge round) depended on which singer received the majority of the votes. The winner of the face-off was given the Challenger status (and his or her manager) and the right to participate in the competition. However, a loss will result in his or her elimination and ineligibility to participate in the Breakouts, although the singer was still allowed to perform Return performances during the recording of the Challenge round (which was broadcast after the episode's end); due to the change, this is the first season not all previously eliminated singers (outside withdrawn singers) were eligible.\n\nThe first round's eligible contestants were Zheng Yiming, Bii, Eric Chou, and Liu Yuning. Voting ended on January 5, 2019, and Liu was voted the first National's Recommended Singer with 1,467,482 votes cast.[6] On January 28, 2019, Jefferson Qian was chosen as the second National's Recommended Singer and faced Super-Vocal finalists for the second Pre-challenge face-off.[7][8] On the third and final round, Angela Hui was chosen as the third and final National's Recommended Singer and faced Bii.\n\nAlthough he did not participate in the Pre-Challenge Face-off, Chen Chusheng was also chosen by professionals and immediately became a challenger during the Ultimate Knockout or Challenge Round, due to one singer who did not perform that week because of an injury (see below).\n\nThe following Singer 2019 contestants are listed in alphabetical order. Singers without a placement for the final are listed as finalists and singers who withdrew are listed as withdrawn.\n\nKey:\n\n– Winner\n\n– Runner-up\n\n– Third place\n\n– Other finalist\n\n– Eliminated/Non-contestant (not eligible for Breakouts)\n\n– National's Recommended Singer\n\nContestant Country Music Partner Status Week Entered Week Exited Result ANU China Li Haofei Challenger Week 2 (Pre-Challenge Face-off) Week 5 (Knockout round 2)\n\nWeek 12 (Breakout round) Eliminated Bii Taiwan — Challenger Week 8 (Pre-Challenge Face-off) Week 9 (Challenge round 3) Eliminated/Non-contestant Chen Chusheng China Eliza Liang Challenger Week 11 (Knockout/Challenge round 4)[a] Week 12 (Breakout round)[b] Eliminated Chyi Yu Taiwan Jeffery G Initial singer Week 1 (Qualifier round 1) Week 14 (Finals) Finalist (Fifth-seventh place) Escape Plan China Low Xinran Initial singer Week 1 (Qualifier round 1) Week 2 (Knockout round 1)\n\nWeek 12 (Breakout round) Eliminated Polina Gagarina Russia David Substitute singer Week 4 (Qualifier round 2) Week 14 (Finals) Finalist (Fifth-seventh place) Gong Linna China Sun Pu Substitute singer Week 10 (Qualifier round 4) Week 14 (Finals) Finalist (Fifth-seventh place) Angela Hui Hong Kong Peng Qing Challenger Week 8 (Pre-Challenge Face-off) Week 9 (Challenge round 3)\n\nWeek 12 (Breakout round) Eliminated Kristian Kostov Russia/Bulgaria Leo Li Initial singer Week 1 (Qualifier round 1) Week 6 (Challenge round 2)\n\nWeek 12 (Breakout round) Eliminated Liu Huan China Li Rui Initial singer Week 1 (Qualifier round 1) Week 14 (Finals) Winner Liu Yuning China — Challenger Week 2 (Pre-Challenge Face-off) Week 3 (Challenge round 1) Eliminated/Non-contestant Jefferson Qian China — Challenger Week 5 (Pre-Challenge Face-off) Week 6 (Challenge round 2) Eliminated/Non-contestant Super-vocal Finalists China Neil Gao Challenger Week 5 (Pre-Challenge Face-off) Week 14 (Finals) Third place Wu Qing-feng Taiwan Guo Tao Initial singer Week 1 (Qualifier round 1) Week 14 (Finals) Runner-up Yang Kun China Li Weijia Initial singer Week 1 (Qualifier round 1) Week 14 (Finals) Fourth place Faith Yang Taiwan/Australia Since Seah Substitute singer Week 7 (Qualifier round 3) Week 8 (Knockout round 3)\n\nWeek 12 (Breakout round) Eliminated Melanie Zhang China Wang Qiao Initial singer Week 1 (Qualifier round 1) Week 3 (Challenge round 1)\n\nWeek 12 (Breakout round) Eliminated\n\nCai Chengyu of Super-Vocal returned in season eight to serve as a temporary music partner for Charlie Zhou in episode five due to his original music partner being unavailable.

The other three singers would participate along with the ousted singers (including Polina Gagarina, but not the three losing singers from the Pre-Challenge Face-off, namely Liu Yuning, Jefferson Qian and Bii) for a chance to enter the finals. The order for this round was determined through each contestant's status quo and their duration on the stage. Three singers have their performances fixed (Chen Chusheng and Super-Vocal respectively chose 9th and 10th as their choice, while Angela Hui was defaulted to perform 1st as a result of her unsuccessful Challenge); after each performance the singer randomly chose one envelope from a particular group of five singers and the singer that was chosen will perform after.\n\nSimilar to the last season's breakout, there were eliminations midway during the performance. Ten singers were grouped into two groups of five, with the first five singers grouped in group one, and the other five in group two. Electronic voting was conducted after each group's performance, and the lowest ranked singer from each group was immediately eliminated with their paper votes rendered void (Breakout failure). Angela Hui and Melanie Zhang were ranked lowest in the electronic voting for their respective groups.\n\nThe singers sang one song, and three of the remaining eight singers who had the most paper votes qualified for the finals. The Super-Vocal Finalists, Polina Gagarina, and Gong Linna placed in the top three and qualified for the Finals (Breakout success).\n\nSinger 2019 Breakout March 29, 2019 Host: Wu Qing-feng\n\nOrder Singer Music Partner Song Title Original Singer Lyricist Composer Arranger Ranking 1 Angela Hui Peng Qing \"我恨我痴心\" Andy Lau Lo Wing-Keung Joan Jett\n\nDesmond Child Goro Wong — \"I Hate Myself for Loving You\" Joan, Jett & The Blackhearts Joan Jett\n\nDesmond Child 2 Escape Plan Low Xinran \"Gravity\" John Mayer Escape Plan\n\nJohn Mayer 6 \"給自己的歌\" Jonathan Lee 3 Faith Yang Since Seah \"證據\" Faith Yang Will Lin Cheer Chen Zheng Nan 4 4 Gong Linna Aaron Sun Pu \"青藏高原\" Li Na Zhang Qianyi Robert Zollitsch 3 5 ANU Li Haofei \"觀心閣\" Tifa Chen Ming Rui Q.luv Xu Lin 8 6 Kristian Kostov Leo Li \"Get It\" Kristian Kostov Kristian Kostov\n\nDaniel Kostov\n\nMaria Erke\n\nSasha Xuman Sasha Xuman\n\nDaniel Kostov\n\nBorislav Milanov 7 \"Rift\" 7 Melanie Zhang Wang Qiao \"回家\" Shunza Shunza\n\nJeff C Shunza Nick Pyo — 8 Polina Gagarina David \"Cтороною дождь\" Russian Folk Song Unknown 2 \"Колыбельная\" Polina Gagarina 9 Chen Chusheng Eliza Liang \"魚\" Cheer Chen Jason Bi 5 10 Super-Vocal Finalists Neil Gao \"總有一天\" Sha Baoliang San Kwan San Bao Nick Pyo 1\n\nThe results are announced in a traditional format similar to the past seasons; during the results, Hong revealed that Chen, Kostov, Gagarina and Super-Vocal were the singers receiving a preliminary higher vote from Escape Plan, ANU, Yang and Gong respectively.\n\nSinger 2019 Breakout Total percentages of votes\n\nRanking Singer Percentage of Paper votes 1 Super-Vocal Finalists 23.23% 2 Polina Gagarina 21.93% 3 Gong Linna 16.81% 4 Faith Yang 10.89% 5 Chen Chusheng 8.51% 6 Escape Plan 7.65% 7 Kristian Kostov 6.28% 8 ANU 4.20%\n\nRecording Date: March 29, 2019\n\nAiring date: April 5, 2019\n\nThe round before the finals was dubbed as \"Santine Finals Rush Hour\" (金典歌王冲刺夜). Its performance was a guest singer's duet. For this week, there is no voting and thus no results after the performance; for the first time in the show's history, public viewers instead cast their votes to decide the outcome for the round. These performances were recorded and shortly uploaded onto Mango TV; the voting period remained opened for seven days until the airing date on April 5. The top three singers who received the most votes from both the 500-member audience and public viewers were entitled to an advantage—a bonus 10, 20, and 30 votes for 3rd, 2nd, and 1st place singers, respectively—in the first round of the grand finals. The results, however, were not publicly revealed until the start of the finals.\n\nThe performance order for this round was first decided by the singer who received the most votes in a prior online fan voting- Super-Vocal finalists won the most votes and was fixed to perform last and decide the next performing singer to perform second-to-last and vice versa (i.e. the 6th performer selects the 5th performing singer, then the 5th singer decides the 4th singer, and so on). The exception was Chen Chusheng, despite being unsuccessful in the breakout round, was temporarily brought back as a guest singer by-virtue of never being eliminated in the competition and being added on impromptu; it was later revealed to have performed 7th in-between Liu and Super-Vocal finalists. Polina Gagarina performance was pre-recorded as she was on Russia due to a scheduling conflict with her concert performance at the time of filming; her music partner David served as a representative.\n\nThe episode generated controversy after one of the public audience members, Sakura Zou (邹小樱), made a post on Weibo accusing Super-Vocal Finalists for allegedly using unauthorized music after the show was aired. However, Souya Music replied on the day after the show that licenses to the program group were never issued and that no copyright violations occurred.[10]\n\nSinger 2019 Finals Rush Hour April 5, 2019 Host: Wu Qing-feng\n\nOrder Singer Music Partner Guest Singer Song Title Original Singer Lyricist Composer Arranger 1 Wu Qing-feng Guo Tao Chen Li \"望穿\" Chen Li Xu Ling Chen Li Ari Calangi\n\nArai Soichiro\n\nDerrick Sepnio\n\nLiu Huyi\n\nYang Yingbiao 2 Gong Linna Aaron Sun Pu Zeng Yiming \"一千個傷心的理由\" Jacky Cheung\n\nSharon Wong Jo Heng Lee Shih Shiong Robert Zollitsch 3 Yang Kun Li Weijia A-Lin \"畫心\" Jane Zhang Keith Chan Siu-kei Ikurō Fujiwara Song Tao 4 Polina Gagarina David Geng Sihan \"Shallow\" Bradley Cooper\n\nLady Gaga Lady Gaga\n\nAndrew Wyatt\n\nAnthony Rossomando\n\nMark Ronson Nick Pyo 5 Chyi Yu Jeffery G Mao Buyi \"因為愛情\" Eason Chan\n\nFaye Wong Xiao Ke Kubert Leung\n\nDa Ridan 6 Liu Huan Li Rui Tia Ray \"City of Stars\" Ryan Gosling\n\nEmma Stone Benj Pasek\n\nJustin Paul Justin Hurwitz Chen Di 7 Chen Chusheng Eliza Liang Dylan Wang \"旅途\" Pu Shu Guo Yifan\n\nJason Bi 8 Super-Vocal Finalists Neil Gao Dimash Kudaibergen \"Forever Queen\" Medley Nick Pyo \"Love of My Life\" Queen Freddie Mercury \"We Will Rock You\" Brian May \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" Freddie Mercury \"We Are the Champions\"\n\nThe finals were divided into two rounds, with the first song in the semi-finals being a duet with a guest singer and the second song in the grand finals being a solo encore performance. Similar to the previous season, votes cast were the sole determinant of the season's winner.\n\nAiring date: April 12, 2019\n\nThe first round of the finals was a guest singer's duet. The grouping was decided by the singers starting with the most wins prior to the Breakouts (if there is a tie in terms of wins, a prior online vote serves as a tiebreak); each group can consist of either two or three members, meaning that two groups will be head-to-head and one being a three-way. After the groups are decided, one member drew lots to decide the order of performance for this round. The result of the grouping are reflected in the table below.\n\nThe singer with the most votes on each group directly advanced to Round 2, leaving the other four singers eligible for a \"save\" or second chance through a re-vote; the singer who received the most votes cast would be saved and would also advance to the second round.\n\nLegend Group 1 Group 2 Group 3\n\nSinger 2019 Finals Round 1 April 12, 2019 Host: He Jiong\n\nOrder Singer Music Partner Guest Singer Song Title Original Singer Lyricist Composer Arranger Result 1 Gong Linna Aaron Sun Pu Shi Yijie\n\nWang Peiyu \"武魂\" Gong Linna Xiang Yu\n\nHe Zhu Robert Zollitsch Eliminated 2 Polina Gagarina David Ai Re\n\nDarren Espanto\n\nDaneliya Tuleshova \"We Are the World\" USA for Africa Michael Jackson\n\nLionel Richie Nick Pyo Eliminated 3 Super-Vocal finalists Neil Gao Wang Leehom \"You Raise Me Up\" Secret Garden Brendan Graham Rolf Løvland Advanced 4 Yang Kun Li Weijia Jason Zhang \"直到世界盡頭\" Jason Zhang Chen Xiang Tetsurō Oda Song Rui\n\nQu Shicong\n\nSong Tao Saved 5 Wu Qing-feng Guo Tao Jolin Tsai \"怪美的\" Jolin Tsai Wu Qing-feng Rhys Fletcher\n\nStan Dubb\n\nRichard Craker\n\nJolin Tsai\n\nStarr Chen Liu Huyi\n\nYang Yingbiao Advanced 6 Chyi Yu Jeffery G Hu Xia \"知否知否\" Yisa Yu\n\nHu Xia Li Qingzhao\n\nMary Zhang Liew Xun Dou Kubert Leung\n\nDa Ridan Eliminated 7 Liu Huan Li Rui Sitar Tan \"我要去哪裏\" Mavis Fan Barbie Hsu Mavis Fan Gu Su Advanced\n\nHad Chyi Yu, Gong Linna and Polina Gagarina advanced to the next round, they would have performed, \"掌声响起\", \"走西口\", and \"Those Were the Days\" as their encore songs, respectively.\n\nThe second round of the finals featured an encore song, and the singer who received the most votes (separate from the previous round's votes) was crowned the winner. The order for this round was determined by each singer's previous performance order from the first round, except for Yang Kun, who was defaulted to perform first after being the last contestant to advance. During the performance, Liu performed a medley of Empress Xiaoshengxian dedicated in memory of Yao Beina, a singer from The Voice of China (another show Liu was part of, as a coach), who died on January 16, 2015.\n\nSinger 2019 Finals Round 2 April 12, 2019 Host: He Jiong\n\nOrder Singer Music Partner Song Title Original Singer Lyricist Composer Arranger Result 1 Yang Kun Li Weijia \"Rivers of Babylon\" Boney M\n\nThe Melodians Qu Shicong Trevor McNaughton\n\nBrent Dowe Song Tao\n\nSong Rui 4 2 Super-Vocal finalists Neil Gao \"就在這瞬間\" Liam Low Zhou Xiaowei Frank Wildhorn Nick Pyo 3 3 Wu Qing-feng Guo Tao \"歌頌者\" Wu Qing-feng Liu Huyi\n\nYang Yingbiao 2 4 Liu Huan Li Rui Zhen Huan medley Chen Di 1 \"金縷衣\" Yao Beina Unknown Liu Huan \"菩薩蠻\" Wen Tingyun \"鳳凰于飛\" Liu Huan\n\nLiu Huan was declared the winner of Singer 2019 with 62.22% of the votes cast, leading by a 37.37% margin ahead of runner-up Wu Qing-feng. 62.22% was the highest vote percentage attained in the history of the show.\n\nSinger 2019 Results of Winner of Battle\n\nRanking Singer Total percentages of votes 1 Liu Huan 62.22% 2 Wu Qing-feng 24.85% 3 Super-vocal Finalists 16.95% 4 Yang Kun 11.30%\n\nPre-show segments, such as Singer Gathering and Singer Announcement, and broadcast ratings from China Central Television are excluded from the rating and tally.\n\nBold text in red and blue indicate the highest and lowest-rated episodes of the season, respectively.[11][12][13]\n\nChina Hunan Television premiere ratings Episode Date CSM55 CSM national network Remarks Rating Share Ranking Rating Share Ranking 1 January 11, 2019 0.806 4.66 2 0.55 4.07 1 Aired with season finale of Zhejiang Television's Sound of My Dream (season 3) 2 January 18, 2019 0.799 5.44 1 0.51 4.1 1 3 January 25, 2019 0.836 5.72 2 0.59 4.86 1 Aired with season premiere of Zhejiang Television's Nice To Meet You 4 February 1, 2019 0.756 4.94 3 0.51 3.82 1 5 February 8, 2019 0.823 5.03 3 0.62 4.13 1 Aired with season finale of Jiangsu Television's Best Time 6 February 15, 2019 0.740 4.64 4 0.43 3.01 2 Aired with season premiere of Jiangsu Television's The Brain (season 6) 7 February 22, 2019 0.743 4.77 5 0.46 3.49 3 Aired with Jiangsu Television's Trump Card (season 4) after timeslot moved to Friday 21:10; Nice To Meet You timeslot moved to Saturday 22:00 8 March 1, 2019 0.750 4.98 6 0.43 3.37 3 9 March 8, 2019 0.636 4.57 8 0.37 3.36 3 10 March 15, 2019 0.646 4.41 6 0.39 3.19 3 11 March 22, 2019 0.692 4.38 7 0.4 3.12 3 12 March 29, 2019 0.587 4.55 7 0.42 3.99 3 13 April 5, 2019 0.659 5.00 6 0.45 3.97 3 14 April 12, 2019 0.833 3.63 6 0.68 3.12 2 Grand Finals episode (Live broadcast; episode broadcast starts at 20:10)"
