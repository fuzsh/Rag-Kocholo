        "text": "Formed in 2001, Taiwanese indie group sodagreen (comprising Wu Tsing-Fong, Shie Shin-Yi, Liou Jia-Kai, Shih Jyun-Wei, Ho Jing-Yang and Gong Yu-Chi) gained attention by winning the Golden Melody Cup two years in a row. Mixing rock and pop influences, they released their self-titled debut album in 2005, featuring the hit single “oh oh oh oh…” which reached number 15 on Hong Kong’s 903 radio chart. This album earned them several nominations at the Golden Melody Awards, with their follow-up album Little Universe earning Best Band and Best Melody award (for album track \"Little Love Song\") Their third album, Incomparable Beauty, came out in 2007, seeing them become the first alternative act to perform at the Taipei Arena. In 2009, they launched four-album Vivaldi Project beginning with Daylight of Spring, and Summer/Fever but it was put on hold when Kung Yu-Chi was conscripted into the military. After releasing live album Once in a Lifetime, the band resumed with What is Troubling You? in 2011, completing the Vivaldi Project with Autumn: Stories (2013) and Winter Endless (2015). After taking a break in 2017, they reunited in 2020 under the name Oaeen, debuting their first album Strange Pool, the following year. In 2022, they unveiled a re-recording of their 2005 debut album, under the title Oaeean (魚丁糸不同名專輯). This album contained all of the original tracks along with four new cover songs, most notably \"That I Would Be Good\" by Alanis Morissette. Additionally, on October 1, 2022, the trademark for the name sodagreen was acquired by the band for a period of 10 years and the band announced a return to their original name during a concert in February 2023. In January, 2024, sodagreen released new recordings of albums Once in a Lifetime and What is Troubling You? which included popular singles “Control Freak” and \"You Are Written In My Song\" (你被寫在我的歌裡), (featuring Ella Chen), with the latter climbing to number 6 on the Hong Kong charts.\n\n©Copyright Music Story Erica Wheadon 2024"
