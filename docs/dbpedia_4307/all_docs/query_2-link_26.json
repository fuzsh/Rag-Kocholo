        "text": "Genesis Alkali is a leading global producer of natural soda ash with an annual capacity of 4.8 million short tons (4.3 million metric tons). We own and operate two world-class trona ore mining and soda ash production facilities near Green River, Wyoming, that have been mining and processing trona, a naturally occurring sodium sesquicarbonate, for over 70 years.\n\nThis business produces products that have no practical substitutes and are essential to everyday life, global economic activity, and the energy transition. Many of the products we take for granted — such as windows, iPhones, glass containers, solar panels, lithium batteries for electric vehicles, detergents, pharmaceutical products, and countless others — all require soda ash in some way. We do not compete with a substitute product, but rather we compete with synthetically produced soda ash, which is more than twice as expensive to produce and has a significantly worse environmental footprint relative to natural production. We also utilize ~500k tons of our soda ash production each year to produce a slate of derivative specialty products that are sold to animal nutrition and other downstream markets."
