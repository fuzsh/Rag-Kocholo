        "text": "Church & Dwight was founded by Dr. Austin Church, and his brother-in-law, John Dwight. Together, they went into the production and marketing of Baking Soda, a trade name for bicarbonate of soda.\n\nJames A. Church joined his father as a member of Church & Co. and adapted the famous ARM & HAMMER™ trademark – the arm of Vulcan, Roman mythological god of fire, with hammer in hand. Since then, this trademark has become one of the world’s most recognized logos – a symbol of the company’s tradition of integrity and quality.\n\nThe descendants of the founders consolidated their interests under the name of Church & Dwight Co., Inc.\n\nDuring the company’s first 80 years, sodium bicarbonate was used and marketed almost exclusively as a household product with numerous uses.\n\nIn April, 1970, Church & Dwight was honored to be the sole corporate sponsor for the first Earth Day.\n\nThe six-story manufacturing plant in Old Fort, OH is built to help meet future growth by using new processing technology built by the Church & Dwight engineers.\n\nFor its 100th anniversary on July 4th, the Statue of Liberty's inner copper walls are cleaned with sodium bicarbonate, which removes 99 years of coal tar without damage to the copper.\n\nArmand Products was formed in 1986 through a Joint Venture agreement between Church & Dwight Co., Inc. and Occidental Chemical Corporation, two of the chemical industry’s largest brands.\n\nArmaKleen is a Joint Venture between Church & Dwight Co., Inc. and Safety-Kleen, two of the leading commercial and industrial parts cleaning companies.\n\nChurch & Dwight’s journey has been a long and successful one. For the past 178 years, our commitment to quality, purity, integrity and performance has distinguished our culture and products and will continue well into the future!"
