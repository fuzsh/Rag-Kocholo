        "text": "Hi, I recently posted a thread about soaping in a heatwave and before that \"cocoa butter bloom\" in soap. In both threads we got talking about soda ash and whether that was the strange thing that was happening to my soap. I said I would try making without deionised water, as that was the only think I could identify as being different to other, ash free batches. Well I did and this is the result and I am as baffled as ever.\n\nThe first pic are the worst, these are tea tree and mint, and lemongrass and poppy seed, and lavender and silk - though the latter aren't nearly as bad. The second pic are sandalwood and clay, with slight nibbles and issues on the white part of the soap but not the brown, and cinnamon, honey and oatmeal, and orange and patchouli, which are both absolutely fine. The other two soaps I made, my coffee, pumice and sea salt and rosemary and sea salt are also fine. All of these soaps have been made within days of each other, using the same technique and largely the same ingredients, apart from obviously different colourants and essential oils. They were all refrdgerated after pouring, I don't gel. I have always made my soap this way. They've been curing for about 3-4 weeks. They are made using a cellular silicone mould. I usually unmould within 24 hours, but this time waited for at least 48 hours before unmoulding. I also mixed at a slightly higher temperature than normal (about 120 degrees f instead of about 110 degrees f) in case that was a cause. They all came out of the mould looking perfect but developed the whitish look within a day or two of unmoulding. All of the problems are on the underside of the soaps not the tops. The tops of nearly all of them, even the worst ones, are fine. If it is soda ash, why is it only affecting the underside only? It isn't a surface issue, it penetrates into the soap. It literally looks like the corners and edges of the soap have been bleached. There is also some slight crumbliness in the whitish areas. For the past three batches (including this one) only the yellow, green and to a lesser extent, the pink soap and the white area of the sandalwood and clay soap have been affected, the latter not as badly this time. This is the side that is on the bottom of the cellular mould. In all cases the yellow and green soaps have been the worst. I use natural colourants - green tea wax mixed in the oils for the mint and tea tree, calendula petals mixed with the lye and left in for the lemongrass and poppy seed and madder root infused in the lye and sieved out for the lavender and silk. So all different colourants and made in different ways. All the ingredients are from reputable suppliers in the UK.\n\nWHAT is going on!!!???!!! Help! It definitely doesn't seem to be anything to do with the water and I honestly can't think of anything else that I am doing differently from the test batches which were all fine. Except of course that now I want to sell them which I didn't when I was making the test batches. Do you think they know and don't want me too!?\n\nThe main source of ash is sodium carbonate that forms when excess NaOH reacts with carbon dioxide in the air. I don't know that anyone has the definitive answer on how to prevent this ash from forming, because I've never seen any solution that absolutely stops ash for all people all (or even most) of the time. If you absolutely can't stand any ash, it's time to develop techniques for removing it when it happens. Steaming and washing with water are two common methods of removing ash, as is planing thin shavings off the affected areas.\n\nA couple of tidbits come to mind that might be useful to you --\n\nFreshly made CP soap can be slightly more alkaline toward the bottom compared with the top. Since water (and lye solution) are denser than fat, the emulsion of lye solution and fat can vary slightly from the top of the mold to the bottom, even in a properly made soap. That's why you might see more ash on the bottom of a bar vs. the top.\n\nAlso, where the water evaporation out of the soap is highest, there is more likely to be ash, because the movement of water to the surface of the soap will also carry dissolved chemicals to the surface as well, including NaOH. And that's why you might see more ash at the edges and top of a bar. (And the edges also are where soap sometimes doesn't gel, even if it fully gels in the center, so Carolyn (cmzaha) may have a point there.)\n\nI’ve had this happen in cavity molds and I am not sure it’s soda ash which you can wash off. This stuff you can’t wash off. It’s hard and it’s inside the soap. It doesn’t really matter. I think it’s something to do with the batter cooling too quickly. The method I use also solves garden variety soda ash.\n\nThe way I solved it was to soap warm 115-120* F, spray the tops with isopropyl alcohol, have the mold in a cardboard or polystypere box so it can be covered. I actually put the mold in the box and pour the batter while it is in there so it doesn’t spill. Then I put a heated wheat bag in if it’s the polystyrene box or if it’s the cardboard box I wrap it in towels and put the heated wheat bag beside the box. Then I cover the lot (both methods) with a doubled over doona. I don’t touch it for 24-48 hours.\n\nIf you take them out of individual cavity molds too early the white stuff can develop later.\n\nIt is winter here now but I do the same in summer. In summer I don’t use wheatbags with my log molds but I do wrap them in the towels and doona. I only wait 18-24 hrs to cut log molds and they don’t get this white stuff.\n\nMy soaps are close to perfect now that I soap hotter and quicker (so the batter stays warm) and keep them warm until the salinity. Even my log Mold soaps. No spots or swirls or ash or hard bits. Thinking back I have had this with Castile in a log mold that I soaped cool. This confirms the theory I think.\n\nI have also experienced this- I call it \"inside ash.\" I always thought it might be stearic spots? Or something to do with trace? I made this horrific batch recently....Poured at really light trace and CPOP'd it.\n\nI think that is a form of stearic spots. But I guess it could be this hard ash. I found soaping hotter will prevent it.\n\nI always get full gel. But when using different additives sometimes things get a bit too hot. I don't need any more insulation that's for sure. I stack my molds on top of each other too so that helps with heat. I never spray again after peeking. I just lift the lid a bit. I have wooden lids so they maintain heat well.\n\nThank you. That's the difference between us/our recipes. I don't get overheating with any of my recipes. I always get full gel but I have to insulate and cover to achieve it. I am still at the stage of making one batch at a time so I don't stack molds.\n\nI've been very impressed with silicone lined wooden molds and lids. So easy. I am going to make a wooden box for my cavity molds.\n\nHi, back again. I decide to stop being obstinate and try cpoping or at least raising my soaping temperature. I made half a batch (four and a bit soaps) and sort of cpoped two and sort of insulated two and a bit. I read a bit on the internet first luckliy, and found an article by a nice lady called Aunty Clara, which warned me about silicon rash, which are pits on the soap surface if you cpop in silicon moulds. So I took ker advice and left the soap to harden for a couple of hours before putting it the oven which I heated to 80 degrees c before switching off and putting the soap in. I covered it with a sheet of baking parchment and left it for several hours before taking it out and leaving it on the work surface. The other two and a bit soaps I left on the side but after a while I dumped some tea towels and a fleece blanket on top. I left both for 48 hours before unmoulding. Now, several days later, neither show signs of ash. I'm actually not sure whether they gelled either, they look the same as my non gelled ones but whether they did or not the slight extra bit of heat meant I got no ash. I made another soap too which I just left on the side with no insulation which also didn't either partial gel or ash. So I wonder if all I actually need to do is just not refridgerate. I now recall that all my partial gel issues were with goats milk soap which is why I have always refridgerated. I have never tried not refridgerating non goats milk soap before. However it still doesn't explain why only some of the varieties got ash.\n\nHowever, now feeling much happier and that I am getting on top this issue and that working out a fool proof, ash proof technique is within reach. Thank you for you patient help and advice (which I have finally taken)."
