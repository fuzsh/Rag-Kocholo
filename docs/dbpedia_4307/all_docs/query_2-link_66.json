        "text": "The Jones Soda Co. announced this week that it is expanding the company’s Mary Jones line of cannabis beverages with the California introduction of new marijuana-infused drinks in 16-ounce cans. The launch of the new super-sized cannabis beverages infused with 100 milligrams of THC, the most common psychoactive compound found in marijuana, follows the debut of the Mary Jones brand’s 12-ounce weed drinks earlier this year.\n\n“Our strong Mary Jones launch validates the strategic decision we made to enter the cannabis industry in order to leverage our brand equity, diversify our portfolio, and move into a profitable high-growth category to drive the company’s future,” Mark Murray, president and CEO of Jones Soda Company, said in a statement. “Building on our initial success, this new higher potency 100mg product unlocks a valuable category with a higher value product aimed at a more mature cannabis consumer. With our ambitious product roadmap and new partnerships enabling us to expand to other states, I’m confident that our Cannabis Division will be instrumental in our growth in 2023 and beyond.”\n\nMary Jones sodas are cannabis-infused versions of the company’s popular beverages including Jones’ Root Beer, Berry Lemonade, Green Apple and Orange & Cream, which have been among the brand’s top sellers for 25 years. Each flavor tastes exactly like its corresponding Jones Soda counterpart, the company maintains, “thanks to award-winning Jones flavor scientists who have customized Jones’ signature craft soda recipes to accommodate the addition of THC emulsions.”\n\nThe Mary Jones offering, at 100 milligrams of THC each, strays from many popular cannabis beverages, which tend to offer 10 milligrams of THC or even less. Bohb Blair, Mary Jones’ chief marketing officer, says that the company’s new “tall boy” cans are intended for cannabis consumers seeking a more potent libation or those looking for refreshments to share.\n\n“Mary Jones is purposefully designing products for the highest momentum growth segments in cannabis,” Blair writes in an email, adding that “100mg multi-serving beverages are one of the fastest-growing formats in mature cannabis markets, like California and Washington. The target market for these beverages is an experienced cannabis user who is seeking more control over their dosing, more potency for value, and in some cases, a bigger buzz. Our 10mg sodas, in a 4-pack, are perfect for a party. These 100mg sodas are attractive to a more frequent dispensary shopper who is widening their personal portfolio of products beyond leaf.”\n\nMary Jones Brand Launched In June\n\nThe new 100mg product introduction follows the successful California launch of the Mary Jones brand with sodas infused with 10 milligrams of THC in June. The line has surpassed market forecasts with rapid placement in more than 150 dispensaries, including at MedMen locations slated to begin carrying Mary Jones 10mg and 100mg products this month.\n\nBrooks Jorgensen, the president of Kiva Sales and Service (KSS), the Mary Jones distributor in California, welcomed the launch of the new 16-ounce offering. “The launch of Mary Jones 10mg bottles was one of the most successful brand launches we’ve seen at KSS, with deliveries to more than 120 retailers in the first 60 days,” Jorgensen writes in an email. “We’re excited to build on this success with the upcoming launch of Mary Jones 100mg cans, which will meet the demand from consumers looking for higher-dose sodas that taste great.”\n\nSeattle-based Jones Soda Co. is a leading craft soda manufacturer with a subsidiary dedicated to cannabis products. The company markets a variety of cannabis products under the Mary Jones brand and distributes traditional premium craft sodas under the Jones Soda and Lemoncocco brands. Jones’ original soda line is sold across North America in glass bottles, cans and on fountain drinks through popular beverage outlets, restaurants and other retailers."
