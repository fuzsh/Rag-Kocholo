        "text": "Probiotic and prebiotic sodas, which claim to be made with ingredients to support gut health, are gaining popularity.\n\nExperts say probiotic and prebiotic sodas may help you hit your recommended daily fiber allowance, improve digestion, and support immune function.\n\nHowever, some have a high sugar content and may cause digestive issues like bloating and gas.\n\nResearch on the health benefits of probiotics and prebiotics is limited.\n\nIf you’re looking for a healthy swap to regular soda, chances are you’ve already heard of probiotic soda.\n\nRecently, prebiotic and probiotic sodas have been gaining popularity, thanks in part to reviews on TikTok.\n\nSearch “probiotic soda” on the social media platform, and you’ll get 119m results, with many users reviewing popular gut-health sodas from brands like Poppi, Olipop, and Culture Pop.\n\nThese fizzy and sweet drinks are said to have less sugar than conventional sodas and are made with ingredients believed to support a healthier gut.\n\nTo put it simply, probiotics are live microorganisms, usually bacteria, that live in our gut and keep it balanced and healthy.\n\nPrebiotics are a type of fiber that we can’t digest. They serve as food for the probiotics, helping them grow and flourish in our gut.\n\nProbiotics and prebiotics work together to keep our digestive system healthy and balanced, so are there any benefits to consuming them in a soda?\n\nMarilia Chamon, registered nutritional therapist, gut health expert, and founder of Gutfulness Nutrition, isn’t surprised that prebiotic and probiotic sodas are taking off. She said their newfound popularity is the result of several factors.\n\nFirstly, people are becoming more aware of the importance of gut health.\n\n“Increasing awareness of gut health and the role of the gut microbiome in overall well-being has driven interest in products that claim to support gut health,” Chamon surmised.\n\nSecondly, she said the appeal of prebiotic and probiotic sodas is rooted in convenience.\n\n“As a beverage, they provide a tasty way to incorporate beneficial microbes and dietary fibers into one’s routine, making them an attractive option for consumers who want to improve their gut health without making significant dietary changes,” she explained.\n\nWhile a growing number of people are reaching for these drinks as a healthier alternative to traditional sodas, are they actually beneficial for your gut and overall health?\n\nChamon said she isn’t entirely convinced.\n\n“I personally can’t see much benefit to it, apart from increased fiber intake,” she said.\n\n“If you eat a Western diet, based mostly on refined sugars and carbohydrates, and a high intake of animal proteins and saturated fat with little consumption of whole foods, prebiotic sodas can contribute to your daily recommended fiber intake,” she explained.\n\n“However, I would rather people focus on improving their dietary patterns instead of relying on prebiotic sodas to support their health goals,” she added.\n\nWhile Chamon said these sodas can be a convenient and enjoyable way to incorporate dietary fiber into one’s daily routine, she believes they should not replace a diet rich in whole foods; one that includes:\n\nfruits\n\nvegetables\n\nwhole grains\n\nlegumes\n\nnuts and seeds\n\nChamon said the main question to ask is, “What are you taking probiotics for?”\n\n“Probiotics are strain-dependent and different strains offer different health benefits. Ideally, you should be looking for a strain that has been studied and proven to help with the specific symptom you are looking to address,” she explained.\n\nKaren Reyes, a board-certified nutritionist, said there are both health benefits and potential health risks to consuming these beverages.\n\nOn the one hand, she said they may improve digestion and support immune function by promoting the production of antibodies.\n\n“Some studies even suggest that they may have beneficial effects on mood and mental health by promoting the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin,” she adds.\n\nShe also cites a 2016 review published in the Nutrition Bulletin, that suggests consumption of probiotics may be beneficial for various health conditions, such as gastrointestinal infections and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\nOn the other hand, Reyes said prebiotic and probiotic sodas may cause digestive issues, such as:\n\nbloating\n\ngas\n\ndiarrhea\n\nChamon shared similar concerns.\n\n“Introducing probiotics can cause gas and bloating, especially for those with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO),” she notes.\n\n“The prebiotic fiber used in these types of sodas is usually inulin, which is a common trigger for bloating and gas, particularly for those with a sensitive digestive system, or people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some brands claim their soda can relieve bloating but it can be quite the opposite,” she surmises.\n\nIn addition, some of these sodas have a high sugar content, which can contribute to heart disease, some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and being overweight.\n\nReyes believes it’s important to note that research on probiotics and prebiotics is still developing, and more studies are needed to fully understand their potential health benefits.\n\nIn the meantime, if you are choosing to drink a probiotic or prebiotic soda, she advises choosing brands with natural ingredients and no added sugars.\n\nAs for whether or not you should consume them every day, Reyes said there is no clear answer as it depends on a variety of factors, including your overall diet, lifestyle, and health goals.\n\nHowever, both experts agree that in moderation they are generally safe for most people.\n\nGiven that it’s not entirely clear how beneficial probiotic and prebiotic sodas are, you might be thinking twice about consuming them.\n\nHowever, there are other ways health experts say you can improve your gut health.\n\nA diet that is high in fiber and low in processed high-sugar, and high fat foods is key. Meanwhile, research suggests that eating fermented foods like kefir, yogurt, and sauerkraut may improve the gut microbiome.\n\n“Scientific research continuously demonstrates that eating a varied and well-balanced diet is the best way to support your gut and overall health,” said Chamon.\n\n“The Mediterranean diet, which is centered around fruits, vegetables, olive oil, nuts, legumes, and whole grains, has been linked to a large number of health benefits, including the prevention of many diseases. Therefore you can support your overall health by following such dietary pattern.”"
