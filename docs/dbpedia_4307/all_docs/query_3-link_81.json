        "text": "On the evening of September 24th, soda green posted a post on social networking sites to announce that it is about to return.\n\ntweeted: \"Hello friends from all over the universe, we are Soda Green!\"\n\nOnce the news was released, Soda Green fans were excited.\n\nOn January 1, 2017, Sodagreen held the final concert of the group's break in Taipei. After singing the song \"When We Walk Together\", Wu Qingfeng said:\n\n\"All pain and all Thank you for walking with Soda Green, and when we come back, thank you.\"\n\nWhen the final night of \" singer 2019 \" had not yet announced the singing guest, many people thought that Wu Qingfeng was going to be in Changsha, Hunan. The Soda Green members gathered together and announced their return on the same stage.\n\nAs a result, Wu Qingfeng himself announced the name of the guest \" Jolin Tsai \". The \"peak blowing machine\" that can hold the queen can naturally stabilize the media and fans. He took the initiative to tell the outside world: We are very defensive. As promised, three years is three years, and it's almost time!\n\nyeah.\n\nSince January 2, 2017, when the group announced a three-year break, Sodagreen, a musical group that once called for wind and rain, has really faded out of the public eye for more than a thousand days.\n\nThese days, the six Sodagreen people are like \"those flowers\" scattered all over the world, and finally have time to do their own business.\n\nSome people continue their studies, some people get married with children.\n\nOnly the lead singer Wu Qingfeng chose to run out by himself, terminated the contract with his former manager, set up a company by himself, continued to sing as a singer, and enjoyed his solo.\n\nThis splendid ensemble contains so many good memories.\n\nIn middle school, many people played sodagreen songs in their headphones.\n\nYou know that even if the heavy rain turns the city upside down, I will hug you and I can't stand seeing your back and come to write down my grievances that are hard to endure every second\n\nincluded in the album \"Small Universe\" \"Little Love Song\" may be many people's first impression of soda green.\n\nSince then, their fresh and artistic feeling has been lingering in my mind, and those simple melodies can always gently flow into the hearts of listeners.\n\nIn 2006, Sodagreen released the album \"Small Universe\", and this lively band really entered the public.\n\nThen in 2007, they won the 19th Golden Melody Award Best Orchestra and the 8th Chinese Music Media Award Best Band and many other awards.\n\nIn the following years, Sodagreen has released a number of albums, all of which have achieved good results.\n\nAmong them, they spanned six years, and they completed four albums with the theme of \"spring, summer, autumn and winter\", which were liked by both sides of the strait.\n\ndozens of songs,Warm as sunlight, enthusiasm as fanaticism, sadness as a story, solemn as never before.\n\nAmong them, there are naturally many popular classics.\n\n\" he has summer in the summer\" \"after saying goodbye\" \" I miss you so much\" \" he raised his right hand to call \"...\n\nEvery youth-related In the days, there are always soda green songs to walk with us.\n\nAt each awards ceremony, they always take away one honor after another.\n\nIn 2016, they won the \" 27th Taiwan Golden Melody Awards \" Best Lyricist Award for their song \"He Raised His Right Hand for Calling\", and won the Best Orchestra Award and Best Arrangement with Soda Green Song Artist Award and many other awards.\n\nThis year, they really became popular in the entire music scene, and it has been 12 years since their debut.\n\nAs they sang in \"A Moment in Ten Years\":\n\nmay be busy and busy, may be hurt and hurt\n\nmay have countless tears sang and sang at night\n\nbut in exchange for growth, in exchange for hope\n\nNow I'm standing on the stage and they tell you\n\nTen years of work have become a brilliant one minute dream\n\nAbout the name of the band, The strange name does not have any deep meaning,Purely because the members felt that \"soda\" was a good way to describe their music.\n\nAfter the drummer Serena proposed a three-character name, it would become popular. The lead singer Qingfeng said that it is better to add his favorite green, and the name \"Soda Green\" was decided on this.\n\nParticipated in the Ocean Music Festival in 2003, originally intended as the band's last performance before disbanding.\n\nBut by coincidence, the music producer Lin Weizhe who was watching the audience took a glance and signed the band decisively, and then they became the best partners in music, as close as family members.\n\nIn the case of not being favored by friends in the circle, Lin Weizhe not only sold the house to release the album for Soda Green, but also did not make any changes to their music, completely respecting and retaining their original style.\n\n△Lin Weizhe on the left, Wu Qingfeng on the right\n\nSlowly, they were recognized by more and more people.\n\nOnce, at the concert, Wu Qingfeng burst into tears and sighed with emotion:\n\nBefore, many people disliked us, many people said that our teacher Wei Zhe was crazy, but today we finally stand here, proving that teacher Wei Zhe did not Crazy.\n\nWu Qingfeng once said: \"Music and singing are enough in my life.\"\n\n, Everyone thought that he was really going to quit Soda Green. This question was answered again in this year's \"Singer 2019\" interview: I chose to sing just to make myself stronger.\n\nFaye Wong once said that her biggest trouble is being too red,Wu Qingfeng also said something similar: \"I'm being chased by inspiration, it's so annoying.\"\n\nIn the music world, Wu Qingfeng is one of the top creative talents.\n\nThe well-informed diva Zhang Huimei is amazed at his creative ability.\n\nWhether it was the soda green period or the personal period now, he has created too many excellent works by himself.\n\nMoreover, he also wrote songs for Rene Liu , Eason Chan , Angela Chang and many other singers.\n\nIt is said that Lin Youjia once invited Wu Qingfeng to sing, and the song was sent. Just three hours later, Lin Youjia got the lyrics full of praise.\n\n's creative ability has always been a major aspect of Wu Qingfeng's praise. In the face of various reputations, Wu Qingfeng said:\n\n\"There is no genius, just work in peacetime.\n\nWhen\n\nwas an artist, no matter how busy he was, he never stopped reading.\n\nWhen reading a book, he would come up with some understandings of his own, and he would annotate and annotate these understandings in the book, and wait until his spare time In a little taste.\n\nIt is said that when he was very young, his grandfather trained him to calligraphy, and he already knew a lot of characters at a young age.\n\nAt that time, he still liked He listens to classical music and likes to listen to all kinds of CDs.\n\nMoreover, he not only listens, but also goes to the library to find the commentary of the corresponding song,To understand what the music is saying.\n\n△ When Wu Qingfeng was a child\n\nAfter middle school, he has been engaged in editing work intermittently.\n\nHigh school, he used to be the editor of the school magazine.\n\nDuring college vacations, he also edited Travel Weekly.\n\nFrom childhood to adulthood, he has been dealing with words. After repeated studies, he gradually became sensitive to words. When writing songs, he was able to do it at his fingertips.\n\nHe wrote 9 songs in 2000 when he first started college, more than 40 in 2002 and 30 in 2003...\n\nEvery time he writes a song, he will brew all the emotions, Turn songs into poems.\n\nWu Qingfeng's efforts are not only for himself.\n\nIn the past fifteen years, Sodagreen has brought infinite power to fans all the time, so the members of Sodagreen have also gained more energy from each other than ever before.\n\nAs Wu Qingfeng said: The relationship between the six of us is that when you know that one person is working hard, everyone else will work hard together.\n\nWhen Wu Qingfeng went to the United States to see members Liu Jiakai took a class and watched him from the very beginning of music theory.\n\nWu Qingfeng sighed with emotion: That majestic guitarist back then actually filled the paper with bean sprouts (notes)!\n\nWu Qingfeng was not only moved, but also awakened himself: hey, I should study too, I want to become stronger, because the end of the three-year hiatus is coming.\n\nFriendship is so precious,So enviable again.\n\nSometimes the unavoidable depression and heavy feeling of powerlessness will make people stray into the foggy forest, the cold wind and the unknown ahead make people doubt everything.\n\nand grasping every moment of the present is the best way to improve yourself.\n\n."
