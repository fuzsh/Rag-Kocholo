        "text": "Including the pictures from the previous entertainment update ðŸ™‚ Enjoy the pretty ladies ðŸ™‚ This is not the most popular red carpet of the year, but the guests make up for it!\n\nContinue reading â†’\n\nI have a Weibo End of Year 2015 Recap article to publish soon for you guys, but I guess red carpets are more important, right? ^^â€¦ Enjoy many more pictures of the first big event of 2016 (or last of 2015? .-.)!!\n\nContinue reading â†’\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR!! Celebrities are joining in for the end of the year shows, which mostly includes musical performances from celebrities /actors /singers. We wonâ€™t do a recap of the whole night (thatâ€™s too crazy), but here are the key momentsâ€¦ (in our opinion) Wow, that was one crazy end of the year, but we did it! Hope C-ent world can slow down a bit and let us breathâ€¦ v_v Continue reading â†’\n\nReady for one of the most anticipated holiday movie of this year? Devil or Angel held a red carpet and it is adorable to see how many guests on Run Brother came to support Deng Chao! It will be released today, so stay tuned everyone!!\n\nContinue reading â†’\n\nA lot of projects to talk about! There are a lot of projects that started filming or started their promotional phase, which means one thing: it is picture spamming time (as always :P). Continue reading â†’\n\nLeâ€™ts talk about this yearâ€™s Domestic TV Series Ceremony å›½å‰§ç››å…¸ 2015 hosted by Dongfang Dragon TV Channel/Anhui Channel. Haha. What a stupid idea to film the ceremony on December 18th 2015 and only air it on January 1st, 2016. So stupid I could get mad. This means we donâ€™t see the funny moments during the ceremony, the interviews, the shows and even the awards given moments in advance. The pictures for the red carpet are out though and I really wanted to share them before next year :3 (as always, BTS at the end of the post)\n\nEdit 2015/12/20 : Lifewithdramas made a really good list of winners so you can go check it out here. ðŸ˜› Continue reading â†’\n\nTodayâ€™s entertainment update is a little bit boring as really, nothing exciting happened for the last five days. We tried to gather as many interesting news as possible for you guys, but it was hard! xD There are stills released here and there thoughâ€¦ Continue reading â†’\n\nWhile Hong Kong hosted a messy kpop award ceremony (yes, I am refering to this yearâ€™s YG-con, aka MAMA), in China, things are done right. See your faves on this poster? That is just a limited number of the huge amount of guests who came to IQIYIâ€™s ALL STAR CARNIVAL! Haha, are you ready for some fun fun pictures that will make your heart flutter to no end? Thatâ€™s how I felt while I was gathering pictures for this post. One thing is for sure, 2015 was so fun!!! Read the whole article, because I left the best at the end!\n\nOrder of the article: Red Carpet, Award winners, Performances and BTS (best part + update).\n\n2015/12/06: Last update I promise! >_< Continue reading â†’\n\nAnother entertainment update! Jimmy Lin is now the proud father of three little boys (I refuse to believe Kimi is growning up ><), Esquire held a Fashion event with many of our favorite actors and actresses while many projects continue to release more stills!\n\nContinue reading â†’"
