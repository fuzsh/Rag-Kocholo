This is only our 2nd kbox session tgt! :O\n\nWe are the C.A.T.! x) 自己想的！I tot of it sometime / months later while thinking of blogging, ok but I drag till now then really write n publish! Why CAT? That’s e combination of the initials of our surnames. ;x ok, random.\n\nAftnn package~ I 4gt e time we arranged to meet (maybe 1pm or 1.30pm). JY woke up late, so I knew we’ll be late (of coz we 2 will meet 1st) n sms HM, who said she wld be late too. In e end, JY and I reached there earlier. At that time, we “played” with my newly bought mp3, or I shld say let JY see. There’s sth abt Jay Chou, I was wondering y always his songs, oh, yuan lai, JY ons his folder. -_- HM arrived, saying, wow JY’s tall! Coz U see, coz it’s been long since we 3 met tgt, esp btwn JY and HM. Then we talked about height liao. Sth abt me – seem to cant grow abv 160cm… ok, stop!\n\nJY bought sth, I think lozenges, from e stall below the MRT station before we made our way to e kbox. Ok, I know e way alrdy, coz been here jus 6 days ago, kbox with CY. Heh! Went to e washroom 1st, since it hadn’t reached 2pm, actually it doesn’t really matter, does it?\n\nOf coz I dun rmb our k room by now~ ok, once inside… Auto song playing 林宥嘉’s 伯乐, almost ending, HM n I sang a little. Next auto is 南拳妈妈’s 再见小时候. I said I like this song! JY duno… so HM n I sang. xD Hmm, it’s in my song list actually, but I wouldn’t really search for this song to sing.\n\nTime to pick songs~ What did we first pick? Cant rmb. Perhaps FLH new songs. That time, I still love them. N I think HM’s a bit crazy over their new songs? 越来越爱、寂寞暴走、恒星、默默、留下来~ I saw 孤单摩天轮, but daren’t choose it, coz I find it too low. “A lot while later”, HM said we could try… but IN THE END didn’t sing. We sang恒星 only half, coz kinda sian, think it’s me who suggested. When singing越来越爱 or留下来 (I can’t rmb), I said, “哇， 唱飞轮海的歌也可以这么HIGH啊？我还以为五月天而已~”\n\nOk, mayday’s song list. I only picked 夜访吸血鬼 & 如烟~ 100% surprised to see夜访吸血鬼! Couldn’t find it 6 days ago, with CY, grrrs. They duno it, so I sang alone, aww so fast! Not able to sing every word. JY asked me to send her this song, she lik this type, haha. 如烟… I told HM, oh pls hope u know how to sing this song. She said know a lil bah, Kass got sing b4. Hmm but think still I sang mostly bahs. Ok, next, I’ll just comment on individual songs according to e order u see abv.\n\n• Get High – JY went washroom, so HM n I sang. Hah, so difficult! Fast …\n\n• 独唱情歌 – HM sang 1st, Tank’s part. I immediately softened, saying “what! Female?!” n passed e mic to JY! Opps, Lol.\n\n• 小酒窝 – hah, I duno y I said, “ohoh, 大家要抢咯！ “ oh well, I sang with JY 1st, e 1st verse, passing to HM aft that… (if I rmb correctly)\n\n• 不懂 – when HM said, “eh?” duno y I know what she’ll be saying b4 she continued speaking, serious. Yeah, same as A-Mei’s 记得~ hahaha.\n\n• PK – I said, eh, how come my singing’s getting worse?! JY said, coz I kept choosing difficult songs. Oh lol~\n\n• 很想说 – know that we know e song de, but 4gt how to sing. When saw starting lyrics, “oh this song!”\n\n• 走音 – 4gt how to sing, 乱编… surprisingly still ok :D\n\n• 缺席 – weird… 6 days ago still can sing de, now lik 4gt a little…\n\n• 一个人 – HM n I went to washroom. B4 stepping out, I/HM joked with JY… 你一个人慢慢唱一个人… Lol. Saw that next song is 一句话… I said, wait for me ah!\n\n• 招牌动作 – I chose de! In e end, I couldn’t sing, hahaha, not familiar la.. xP\n\n• 在你怀里的微笑 – another song! I know de, in kbox sdnly duno how to sing it well. Sad… passed to JY.\n\n• 手心 – I said I duno how to sing this song, then passed to HM n JY. But when it started, both got stuck somehow n it was me who sang! LOLS. Both wanted to pass e mics to me, but I retreated, hahaha.\n\n• 爱的城堡 – e time was not really enuf, so I asked if wan to sing halfway. Opps, lol. It’s me who sang, n JY didn’t sing, but I asked her ;x in e end continued singing bahs.\n\n• 永远在身边 – did we rly pick this song? Probably 1 of e auto songs in front. V diffi to sing too…\n\n• 太阳 & 最幸福的事 – hmm, I sound weird.\n\nOk, end of individual songs comments… We kept pulling some songs up e list n pushing songs down… Main reason y cant sing e other songs we chose was bcoz of time constraint bah. For one of e songs, 远远, JY n I told HM that e MV was v boring. Then HM asked but then is e song nice? N we said yes~~ We sang without e original voice for most songs. I got reminded, 6 days ago with CY, there’s one song (光良’s), coz it didn’t have e original voice, so we skipped it. JY said stupid… lol. ;x\n\nYea, n the stop order was of coz received. But we still stayed inside e room~ muhahah. 我们清唱！JY recording on her mp3. HM n I sang飞轮海’s 默默… lol, I sang the starting, n was immediately stopped by HM. She said she only knows from e chorus. Oh ok lor. Ok, I can’t control! I laughed while singing. Most probably coz I couldn’t rmb e lyrics well. Lol lol lol ;x\n\nThen, HM n JY sang 黑Girl’s 女生~ HM started 1st – e “女生 我是女生” part. Haha, of coz their duet was marvelous, hehe. Not lik me with any other person, problem of coz lies in me, my singing’s bad. Ok, then I think … we were “chased out” of e room! Hahahas~ We then went out reluctantly, heh.\n\nOtw back to mrt… I then said sth which scared e other 2! Guess what? Our previous kbox session was 1 YEAR 2 MONTHS 8 DAYS ago! Funny, hahas, I had alrdy prepared to say this lo. I then told them I did record down la, not from memory. XD\n\noh well, n then what I rmbed of our 1st kbox session that time. HM led us, coz JY n I had never been to kbox. :D We went to JEEC de. As for singing details, I rmbed…\n\n1) when we sang 光良’s 不会分离, at e ending, HM told us “你们两个继续慢慢不会分离”. LOL!! Coz e ending kept repeating 不会分离, haha.\n\n2) during 卓文萱’s 甜甜圈, I said, wah, this e only song I dun need to change from 真音和假音…\n\n3) 光良’s 烟火 – they said so far, I sang this song e best. Haha. Think JY then said, coz I v like this song bah…\n\nOk, think that’s abt it. At that time, I think, when will our next kbox session be. Hahas. SCARE THEM ABT E DATE NEXT TIME!
