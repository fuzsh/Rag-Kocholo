        "text": "Golden Coin Rush is the 35th story event[1] in Goddess of Victory: Nikke.\n\nThe event centers around Soda and Alice's (mis)adventures during a special event at Coin Rush.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nWith the Maid Cafe's finances running in the red, Soda makes a desperate gambit to keep the establishment afloat. That being to participate in the Tetra Golden Chip competition, where the winner gets any wish of theirs granted by Mustang himself...\n\nStory[]\n\nSet after the events of Bunny X 777\n\nPrologue - Tetra Golden Chip Showdown[]\n\nThis is a story that begins one year ago, during Coin Rush's Golden Chip Showdown. Tetra Line CEO Mustang drank in the crowd's energy as he declared 777 the winners of that year's competition. Blanc was called up to the stage, where she thanked everyone for making the contest as lively as it was. Mustang then handed Blanc the grand prize for this competition; the eponymous Golden Chip. A one-of-a-kind item that allows the squad bearing it to make any request to Mustang. Said CEO declared the Showdown over, promising to do this again in one year's time, and wondering if there was anyone out able to surpass 777's unbelievable winning streak. The ceremony closed with one final collective shout of \"Eeeeeentertainment!\"\n\nOff to the side, Maid For You (particularly Soda) commented on how exciting everything was. Ade considered having them participate in next year's competition, but Cocoa rejected the idea, believing that professional maids like themselves would one-sidedly win the whole thing. Moreover, they had little incentive to compete in the first place, as they bore no major difficulties, financial or otherwise. The three agreed to come back next year to watch the Showdown again...\n\nCut to a year later, as Mustang announces a new Golden Chip Showdown. Despite some visible nerves, Soda (now dressed like a bunny girl for some reason) assures the protagonist that she's going to win this for Maid For You...\n\nPart I - Golden Coin Rush[]\n\nMaid Cafe Crisis[]\n\nApproximately two weeks before the Golden Chip Showdown. Soda cheerfully steps into the Maid Cafe, only to be greeted by Cocoa and Ade's sullen faces. The two reveal that Maid For You is in dire financial straits. Despite all the events held to drum up interest, the Cafe's customer count has barely budged. Extra expenses without extra sales means falling profits, and between everyone's savings, they only have the money to stay open for one more month. Ade is keeping her options open, even considering getting a loan, but it seems increasingly unavoidable...that the cafe will have to shut down...\n\nAs the squad mulls over their predicament, their phones all buzz at the same time. At first they think it was their squad's group chat, but it turns out to have been the Tetra Line group chat. The message is a notification of the upcoming Tetra Golden Chip event, something they remember spectating last year due to being too busy to compete. A light bulb goes off in Soda' brain at that moment. This is Maid For You's big chance to turn their fortunes around. The prize for the Golden Chip is basically a free wish from Mustang, a CEO with money and power in spades. If they win, then they can ask him for financial support. Despite the daunting task of breaking 777's unbroken win streak, the maids decide to at least give it a try and see if they could pull off a miracle.\n\nWith that in mind, Maid For You looks over the rules for the Golden Chip. It will be a team contest, with teams made of one leader and two members. The teams (particularly the leaders) can only consist of Nikkes from Tetra Line, so grabbing someone from another manufacturer is not allowed. While teams do not have to all be from the same squad, in the event that a multi-squad team wins, only the leader will get the Golden Chip and its privileges. As part of that rule, only one member of any squad can be the leader of a team. Ade clarifies to Soda that this means only one Nikke can represent each squad, to ensure every participating squad gets a fair shot at the Golden Chip. The allowance of multi-squad teams is to accommodate for those who lack three members from the get-go. It also means that different squads can work together to try and win...or send moles to trip up everyone else...\n\nSoda is relieved to hear the rule composition, since Maid For You can just form a team and compete. Except for one little problem. The rules state that the participants must remain within Coin Rush during the competition, which will take place over several days. Even with, no, especially because of their ongoing crisis, Maid For You can't just shutter the cafe while they all go participate, meaning at least one person has to remain and keep the lights on. Cocoa and Ade elect to stay, since expecting one person to handle the work of three is ludicrous. That leaves Soda to represent Maid For You by herself. The other maids assure her that if she thinks it too daunting, she can always back down. Getting the Golden Chip sounds like a far-fetched gamble anyway...\n\nForlorn, Soda's gaze drifts to the cafe interior. She recalls the warm memories that suffuse the premises, both from the staff and the customers. If a miracle is what it takes to protect that, then a miracle she'll make. Spurred on by the others' encouragement, Soda steps outside, confidently declaring she'll win the Golden Chip for her squad...before stopping on the street and wondering what she's supposed to do now...\n\nLater that same night, the protagonist hears a knock on the door as he prepares to go to bed. Inviting a haggard-looking Soda into his room, the maid relays her plight to him amidst sighs and sobs...\n\nWrapping up the explanation, Soda bemoans how everyone else is either already in a team or uninterested in participating, so she's ended up with zero prospects on teammates. To that end, she asks the protagonist if he's interested in joining her team, pointing out a rule hidden in the fine print that states the team leader can nominate any one person to join their team outside of the standard restrictions. The protagonist isn't confident he can compete with the physical and mental capabilities of Nikkes, let alone the obscene luck of 777. But upon hearing Soda tearfully explain the Maid Cafe's imminent shutdown, he resolves to join Soda's team and help Maid For You win the Golden Chip.\n\nAfter receiving Soda's profuse gratitude, the protagonist wonders who they're going to pick for a third member. Soda invites him to join her in heading to Coin Rush in the morning. With Golden Chip registration beginning tomorrow, she figured she'd be able to scrounge up recruits from curious passersby, which was her backup plan in case the protagonist declined. The two agree to meet up tomorrow morning, and call it a night...right after Soda cleans the protagonist's room top-to-bottom as quietly as she can...\n\nSigning Up[]\n\nThe next day, Soda and the protagonist meet up at Coin Rush. As expected, the casino is even more packed than usual thanks to people looking to sign up and curious pedestrians seeing what the fuss is about. The crowding has gotten so bad that those who came to actually play games can't from the sheer deluge of people on the floor. Taken aback by the hustle and bustle, the two nevertheless venture inside, hoping to find their third member...\n\nNudging his way through the crowd, the protagonist quite literally bumps into Rouge, 777's gamemaster. The latter is surprised to see him here after so long, and even more so to hear that he's participating in the Golden Chip event. Seeing Soda beside him, Rouge muses that Maid For You must've read the fine print, and that the bunny twins are going to be inconsolably envious...\n\nThe conversation then turns to Soda's intent on finding a third member so she can compete. Rouge states that may be difficult, given how everyone else has made clear their intent or lack thereof in participating. She laments that the whole point of allowing mixed teams and a single free nomination was to break up the squads that normally close ranks and expand the winner pool beyond the usual suspects, but it seems that rule has fallen flat. She also comments that Soda's best bet is to find someone who wasn't planning to compete at first, though that may be a herculean task with this kind of crowd. All of a sudden, a voice cries \"Rabbity!\" and the protagonist is tackled from behind. There's only one person who would call him that, and sure enough, it's Alice.\n\nThe bunny of Unlimited is elated to see Rabbity here, though Rouge is surprised to see Alice is still on the premises. The gamemaster previously noticed Alice getting jostled as she nosed around, and pulled her out of the fray. Alice's talk of \"a white [rabbit] and a black [rabbit]\" led Rouge to conclude she was here to see Blanc and Noir, but unfortunately the two are unlikely to show up when things are this rowdy. As for why Alice is here in the Ark and not up north, the bunny explains that she accompanied her Queen while the latter came here for business. Just as Alice is about to leave, the protagonist stops her, asking if she still wants to see Blanc and Noir. Soda has a look of shock on her face as she comes to the same conclusion as him...\n\nAlice is part of Tetra, is driven to accomplish something, yet has no major stake in claiming the Golden Chip for herself. That makes her the perfect member for the team, so the protagonist invites her to join him and Soda to play games before they see Blanc and Noir. Alice practically has stars in her eyes as she hears him out. Being able to see the black and white rabbits, spend time with Rabbity, and play games? It's like a dream come true! Though...she still has to get back to her Queen. The protagonist sends a quick text to Ludmilla and easily gets permission to keep Alice at Coin Rush for a few days. With Alice eager to play with Rabbity and Soda (whom she calls \"Twinkling Bunny\" for how she apparently sparkles), Rouge guides the newly-formed team to the registration desk...\n\nWith the registration complete, Rouge reminds the trio that they need to keep a close grip on their bunny-shaped badges, as those will be their only identifiers as contestants and thus key to their entry on the big day. Alice asks what kind of games they'll play, though Rouge sadly cannot comment. The protagonist is only slightly grumbly about how getting information is tougher than last time. Rouge remembers how that whole affair went, remarking that since 777 is actually competing this time around, they can't slip any insider info to the protagonist, though his time spent with the squad should clue him in on their biggest card; luck. With a final comment that a close game would ensue if the trio can somehow turn luck to their side, Rouge departs...\n\nSoda and Alice are ready to head back, but the protagonist is deep in thought. Just as Rouge implied, 777 has luck on their side, and he knows from experience that Blanc and Noir's reputation as lucky charms isn't just for show. With that in mind, he takes Soda and Alice out to town, claiming he has a plan to ensure Lady Luck will smile their way...\n\nSaid plan being to...do anything and everything that (claims to) bring good fortune. Buying whatever clothes and accessories that store clerks claim is lucky regardless of price. Telling Alice to forward spam mail just because it claims to be a lucky letter. Getting in line for a rare exhibition even if the queue is barely moving. Despite Soda's skepticism, she follows along with everything, guided along by the protagonist's confidence and Alice's infallible cheer. By the time the trio finish everything, night has already fallen. The protagonist decides that one last stop is in order, that being...the cosplay store?\n\nAt the store, the protagonist confidently answers Soda's questions despite his own internal reservations. There's no guarantee that aping Blanc and Noir's style while chasing after every \"lucky\" thing will actually turn their fortunes around, but the twins have always been somewhat inexplicable in their good luck anyway. His musings are soon broken as Alice and Soda pop out from the changing rooms, revealing the bunny outfits they're attired in. The protagonist cheers over how adorable Alice looks in her new bunny outfit, while Soda's is...attention-grabbing in a different way, given how the outfit struggles to properly contain her...assets.\n\nWith the preparations all set, even with Soda's nerves getting to her again, the three get fired up to win the Golden Chip, and with it, Maid For You's salvation...\n\nFirst Game[]\n\nThe big day finally arrives, and the crowds at Coin Rush are no smaller than the ones at registration. If anything, they've gotten bigger now that the festivities are about to commence. Rouge beckons the trio over to the contestant's entrance, and lets them in after confirming their badges.\n\nThe event venue is thankfully more open, as the protagonist sees few others in the room beyond the various Tetra Nikkes participating in the competition. Soda and Alice's eyes are instead drawn to a display case on the center stage. Ensconced within is a chip with Mustang's open-mouthed grin emblazoned on its face. The contest's namesake, the golden chip that's Soda's best shot at saving her squad and their Maid Cafe from financial ruin...\n\nMeanwhile, Alice is busy trying to find Blanc and Noir somewhere in the area, though they're nowhere to be seen. Noticing Soda's nervous energy becoming less energy and more nerves, the protagonist is about ready to offer some encouragement, when all of a sudden the lights cut out. In a burst of lights and music, the host of this grand affair, CEO Mustang, makes his fabulous entrance...\n\nMustang thanks all the participants and spectators for the energy they bring to this event before getting to brass tacks. Over the days that the Golden Chip Showdown will occur, each team will have their own room to reside in as they drink in the fun, food, and festivities of Coin Rush. The first game is slated for tonight, so the contestants will have the rest of the day to munch, mingle, and meander about. With one last \"Eeeeeentertainment!!!\", Mustang vanishes in a blinding flash of light...\n\nWith the opening ceremony over, the trio ponders over what to do until the first round, assuring Alice that she just needs to wait until she can see the rabbits. The protagonist can see Talentum and Prima Donna here on the ground floor, while Protocol and Cafe Sweety have migrated to the second floor. Musing that checking out the area and their fellow contestants might be a good idea, he decides to explore...\n\nThe first floor[]\n\nThe protagonist suggests they first get a feel of the first floor, especially with how easy it is to get lost amidst all the bright lights. He notices that there are plenty of squads here, and too little time to talk to all of them. Talentum is closest, so he figures they'll make a good start...\n\nYan is drilling Rupee on the plan to win, only for the latter to notice the protagonist and eagerly beckon \"Sweetie\" over. Alice is elated to see a \"golden bunny\" while Rupee shocked to see the protagonist on the participant floor, given how he's neither a Nikke nor a Tetra affiliate. Dolla easily pegs him as one of the contestants, given how she bothered to read the fine print beforehand. Rupee laments that she has to butt heads with the protagonist like this, but her teammates seem less reluctant. Even knowing that he's running under Maid For You's banner and the latter's monetary woes, Talentum is dead-set on winning the golden chip. With the kind of financial backing a Big Three CEO can flourish, there's no limits to the kinds of business ventures and gains they can realize. Though they readily admit they'll likely squabble amongst themselves for who gets the prize at the end...\n\nThe protagonist notices that Rupee is once again in her bunny outfit like the last time he'd seen her at Coin Rush. Turns out this is a special costume she dons for every stream she does at the casino, and the Lupins can't get enough of it. As Yan and Dolla warn off any attempts to stream their likenesses, the protagonist thinks over Talentum's abilities. Despite the...strong personalities each businesswoman presents, there's no denying that when they smell money, these three can show some serious cooperation. With a final overture of friendly rivalry, Talentum and Soda's team part ways as the protagonist guides the latter to Prima Donna...\n\nIn somewhat expected fashion, Volume is butting heads with Aria and Noise. While they agreed to designate Volume as the representative for their squad, it would seem the rapper's fiery ego is already starting to get on her teammates' nerves. Volume is initially pleased to see the protagonist, shocked to hear he's participating as a competitor, and then turns back to her confident smirk as she sees his lineup. Sure, the protagonist is a rare specimen among commanders, but one human, a rabbit like Alice, and the klutzy Soda? The rapper's dismissal of her team as a threat deflates Soda's spirits...\n\nThe conversation turns to Prima Donna's motivations to entering the Golden Chip. As ever, they're driven by their pursuit of performing excellence. Though perfectly capable of putting on a show with what they have, the three musicians agree that the kind of material backing Mustang could give would let them create a performance to remember. As another of Volume's comments twinges at her teammates, the protagonist evaluates the singers in his mind. Prima Donna has friction in spades, but each of them individually is a powerhouse. With another exchange of friendly rivalries, Soda's team takes their leave of Prima Donna...\n\nThe second floor[]\n\nThe second floor of Coin Rush is host to the Game Zone and Drink Zone among others, but with little time to spare, the protagonist decides to first check the Game Zone...\n\nThe Game Zone is loaded with all kinds of gaming consoles and accessories. The protagonist looks in the corner where some intense gaming sounds can be heard, and sure enough, Exia is busy wiling away the hours in a game. Novel suddenly jumps up and ponders the protagonist's presence, the self-proclaimed detective's master(?) deductions concluding that \"Watson\" broke into the venue. Upon hearing there was a rule allowing one teammate to not be a Nikke or from Tetra, Novel (at Exia's suggestion) instead tries to deduce who the leader of his team is. After she mistakenly guesses Alice, the conversation then turns to Protocol's last teammate, given how their squad lacks a third member. Though Novel tries to play coy, Exia easily discloses some info, stating that their plus one is down on the first floor after being overwhelmed by the heat of the game machines. As for motivations, Protocol is as single-minded as ever; Novel expects there to be some big mystery that happens, and Exia's just here to play games. Hearing that neither of them are the leader, the protagonist posits that their leader is from another squad, one who apparently has a much bigger stake on the golden chip than these two. At Alice's gesturing and taking note of the time, the protagonist guides the team to the Drink Zone, bidding Protocol farewell...\n\nThe Drink Zone offers a variety of beverages plus some seating to relax in. After sampling a welcome drink that's a little too sour for Alice, the team notices another group at the seats. As expected of any place providing liquid refreshments, Cafe Sweety is already there. In usual fashion, the three fixers are bickering over everything, from who the leader for their team is to what they'll use the golden chip on. Milk wants a sparring ring in the cafe, Sugar wants new parts for Black Typhoon, and Frima wants a king-sized bed.\n\nSoda and Alice redirect the conversation to a topic that's simultaneously the best and worst one; Cafe Sweety's drinks. With each member talking up their respective coffees, Soda takes a cup of cream coffee while Alice goes for milk, leaving the protagonist to take the sugar coffee. Said sugar coffee is, typical of Sugar, absolutely loaded with sweetness. Good for a Nikke's palate...not so much for a human's...\n\nAs the two sides banter a little more, the protagonist goes over his mental evaluation. Cafe Sweety is as disjointed a bunch as ever, but when the chips are down and it's do-or-die, there's no one who can work together quite like them. Plus, Soda seems dispirited for some reason, so they'll need to take a moment to prop up her morale. The two teams part ways, with Sugar's kissing fixation acting up and Frima falling asleep again...\n\nWith little time left, the team regroups on the first floor. Soda seems deflated for a moment before she perks up, while Alice is still bemoaning the absence of the rabbits she wanted to see. Then Soda notices a set of bunny ears near the stage, and the trio eagerly rush there, coming face to face with the twin bunnies...Folkwang and Mary?\n\nThe appearance of the two (in bunny outfits of their own no less) is quite the surprise, though Mary reveals she's here as part of the medical staff. Folkwang is participating, but Epinel and Rumani weren't interested, so she had to team up with Protocol instead. While passing time with conversation, Alice asks the two how \"Slippery Bunny\" and \"Doctor Bunny\" got their bunny outfits. Folkwang explains that she started overheating as soon as she stepped in, so the staff gave her this outfit in lieu of turning up the A/C. It's similar to the ones Blanc and Noir wear as they dance, so it's made to keep the wearer cool, though Folkwang still can't stop sweating. As for Mary...she's just wearing it as part of the atmosphere and fun of Coin Rush, reminding everyone that safety is the biggest priority even as they push through to win. With the competition about to begin, everyone's attention turns towards the stage, where Mustang somehow managed to appear without anyone noticing...\n\nThe Tetra CEO announces the end of free time, and beckons all contestants to gather before the stage. After introducing 777 as the winners of last year's Showdown, Mustang gets down to the rules of the contest. A series of games will be played by everyone except 777 in an elimination format. The last team standing earns the right to challenge 777, and with it, a chance to win the golden chip. Or rather, the key to the display case containing the golden chip. In the spirit of fairness, not even 777 knows what the final game will be until it comes up.\n\nWith Soda set on winning the golden chip, and Alice set on winning so she can get Blanc and Noir's autographs, Mustang declares the commencement of the Golden Chip Showdown's first game...\n\nSoda the Runner[]\n\nGame No. 1 of the Golden Chip Showdown is...an obstacle course, which garners various reactions, particularly despair from Exia and an easygoing scoff from Milk. Mustang explains that this course will be a baton relay, where each team's members must make a full lap around the main hall before passing the baton to their next teammate. Slowest teams will be disqualified, with matchups decided by tournament bracket. Seeing Sugar attempt to ask a question, the CEO preempts and explicitly tells the fixer no, she cannot use her motorcycle, much to her disappointment. As for Folkwang asking where the obstacles are, Mustang raises a hand, snaps his fingers, and hurdles drop from the ceiling. While Soda and Alice marvel over such technology and showmanship, Mustang continues by explaining that tripping over or bumping into a hurdle is immediate disqualification. With that, the CEO gives everyone five minutes to check the brackets and decide running order.\n\nSoda's team looks over the brackets alongside some others. Milk is annoyed to see Cafe Sweety getting a bye, but Sugar doesn't mind since she lost interest after Black Typhoon was banned. Seeing that Talentum is their competition this round, the protagonist checks on everyone's confidence in their speed. Given Alice's enthusiasm, she'll be first to go. Soda, despite her uncertainty, is still a Nikke and thus outstrips a human's ability, so she'll go second. That'll leave the protagonist to bring up the last stretch. Having a squishy, fatigue-prone human like himself already puts their team at a disadvantage, so the goal here is to avoid elimination as long as possible. With any luck, the other teams will make a mistake first and get prematurely disqualified. Despite some unease, Alice is picked as the first runner, even as they have to remind her about the rules and the baton...\n\nDuring the pre-race warmup, the trio are approached by Talentum. Rupee laments that she won't race Alice since she's going last, though her excitement ratchets up when she hears she'll be going head-to-head with the protagonist. Mustang declares five minutes are up, and calls the first teams up to race...\n\nAfter some time, it's finally Team Soda and Talentum's turn. Alice and Dolla line up at the start, and Mustang gives the signal...\n\nThanks to Alice's initial burst of speed, the team has a decent headway. The protagonist reaches out to grab the baton from Soda, even as the sound of her labored breathing is...incredibly distracting to him. All of a sudden, Soda fumbles and nearly drops the baton. The protagonist moves to catch it, but in the process his arm catches on something, Rupee's yelp accompanying him as everyone takes a tumble to the floor...\n\nWith a whistle, Mustang declares the game over. Soda frantically checks over the protagonist's condition, but fortunately he isn't injured. Rupee is similarly fine, though it turns out she was streaming while running, and the protagonist caught onto her selfie stick while trying to catch the baton. With Soda picking the protagonist up and Yan bemoaning Rupee's tomfoolery, the two teams turn to Mustang to confirm the results. Both of them fell, so who won this round?\n\nMustang comments on the unexpected occurrence, and hands the floor over to Rouge. The gamemaster explains that cameras are set to record the contestants for some of Coin Rush's other games with all liability and waivers being covered in the application. The instant replay allows for a play-by-play breakdown; Soda fumbled the baton (much to her dismay), and the protagonist turned to catch it. In the process, his arm caught on Rupee's selfie stick, causing her to trip over a hurdle. Mustang's final verdict is that Rupee's selfie stick was first to hit the hurdles, thus Talentum loses. Alice cheers over their victory, though Soda seems unsteady. Rupee on other hand is mirthlessly chuckling about her mess-up...\n\nAs the main hall is cleared of hurdles, Mustang declares the first game to be over. Disqualified teams can either stay and watch or depart from Coin Rush. Until round two begins tomorrow, contestants are free to do as they please. The obstacle course will be recreated in the Game Zone to be freely replayed. With that, Mustang bids farewell, vanishing amidst smoke and music. It was a close call, but Team Soda has scraped by round one...\n\nUnexpected Injury[]\n\nRupee is profusely apologizing to the protagonist for whacking him with her selfie stick, even amid a small argument with Talentum about her streaming fixation costing them the match. Mary breaks it up to escort the protagonist to the medical tent for a check-up, with the man himself asking to go alone despite Soda and Alice's wishes to accompany him...\n\nEnd of the First Day[]\n\nIn the medical tent, Mary asks the protagonist to take off his shirt. Even like this, she can tell that his fall is probably causing him some pain, as shown by how he reacts when she pokes him in the shoulder. Thus he agrees to disrobe so she can examine him...\n\nAfter a brief while of poking and prodding, Mary makes her diagnosis. While the protagonist's left shoulder shouldn't affect his daily life overly much, she still recommends he avoid strenuous activity with it for some time. With that in mind, her professional suggestion would be to withdraw his entry from the Showdown so he can recover. He quite obviously refuses, so Mary settles for giving him a pressure bandage to alleviate any symptoms and making him pinky-promise not to overdo it. She promises to at least make the bandage subtle so that Soda and Alice don't worry too much over his condition.\n\nThe protagonist then asks Mary if any of the future games are going to be this risky, given how she'd advised him to be careful. The doctor simply makes an ominous remark about the establishment calling for a medical professional when (most of) the participants are tough-as-nails Nikkes...\n\nAs Mary leans in to wrap the bandage, the protagonist desperately peers around for something to look at or talk about. Anything that would bring his attention off of Mary's proximity and her...degree of exposure. He blurts out the first thing he can think of, which ends with him asking Mary's thoughts on the clothes she's wearing. The doctor takes the question in stride, noting that between the freedom of movement and how a child like Alice seemed enamored with it, she's considering wearing it at the hospital. She's joking of course or is she? and finishes wrapping up the bandage. With a final advisory to avoid strain and to come back immediately if he feels anything off, the protagonist exits the medical tent...\n\nStepping outside, the protagonist brushes off Soda and Alice's concern, plus the sudden inclusion of Rupee. The latter bunny is feeling remorseful about the selfie stick incident, so she came here to apologize again after Yan and Dolla chewed her out over it. As part of that apology, Rupee declares her intent to remain here and cheer on the team. Not because she wants to stream the competition, but rather she feels like it'd be better to stay and provide support. Of course, now that they've got themselves a cheerleader, Rupee asserts that they have to win the whole thing. The trio feel a sense of invigoration at the appearance of someone in their corner...\n\nAfter dinner, the trio head over to their assigned room. It's certainly spacious, especially the size of the bed. The...singular...bed...in the room. There's a moment of flusterment as Soda and the protagonist try to find an alternative sleeping space, but it would seem that for all the luxuries provided by Coin Rush, a second bed, couch, futon, or sleeping bag is not on the list. In the face of Alice's carefree innocence and her aversion to sleeping alone, the other two agree to all sleep in the same bed together. Alice declares her intent to sleep between the others, so after showering and other necessary routines, the protagonist goes to sleep with Alice and Soda, thankful that the sleeping arrangements mean he won't be right next to Soda. His left shoulder still smarts from the earlier incident, leaving him hoping the next game won't be as physical.\n\nAs the protagonist slowly drifts off to sleep, Soda looks at him with a downcast expression...\n\nSecond Game[]\n\nThe next morning, the protagonist awakens to warm sunlight, soft sheets, and...silky hair in his face? His mind wakes up right away as he realizes that Alice's face is uncomfortably close to his own. Soda greets the waking duo, having gotten up earlier to tidy up the room. Sharing Soda's resolution to not make any more missteps in the contest, the team gets ready for another day...\n\nThe team gathers in the main hall, where the rest of the contestants have already assembled. They notice Rouge talking with someone to the side, and Alice bounds over hoping to get a glimpse of Blanc and Noir...\n\nSadly, it's not even bunnies, let alone the ones Alice is looking for. Rouge is instead talking with Milk and Sugar, who seem to be at a loss. The protagonist asks about the situation, leading to Milk explaining that Frima just randomly dropped out. Apparently, the Cafe Sweety leader noticed a number of good napping spots around Coin Rush, and decided catching some shuteye was a more productive(?) use of her time than actually competing. So the other fixers were trying to hash out an alternative, since Frima's sudden bout of laziness is the only thing preventing them from continuing on.\n\nRouge cites that the rules allow for a substitution in the event that a teammate is injured or withdraws, but with the second game imminent and no other people available, it doesn't look good for Milk and Sugar. Then Alice suddenly gets a flash of insight. There is someone in this area who isn't a contestant; \"Doctor Bunny\" a.k.a. Mary. Rouge mulls it over and decides that would suffice, but only if Mary herself is actually willing. Fortunately, said doctor decides that taking part would be better than just twiddling her thumbs in the medical tent waiting for an incident. And if something does happen during the next game, she'll be in prime position to respond. Despite her proclaimed inferior athleticism, Milk and Sugar are happy to remain in the tournament by any means.\n\nMustang thanks Rouge for handling the situation, having popped onstage without anyone noticing. With everything settled, Mustang declares Round Two of the Golden Chip Showdown to the roaring crowd...\n\nSmash, Soda![]\n\nGame No. 2 of the Golden Chip Showdown is...Nikke whack-a-mole? As a large box is lowered from the ceiling, Alice notices the holes are big enough for people to fit in. Mustang explains that the competitors will alternate between attack and defense. The attacker leader is given a hammer, and must whack the heads of the defenders popping out of the holes. They earn points for hitting defenders, and lose points for hitting anything else. The team with the lowest score at the end of the round will be eliminated. Defenders that linger on the same hole for too long, take too long to retract after getting hit, or do not pop up for too long will have their points penalized at the end. Soda whines with dread as she realizes that team leaders are given the hammer, meaning she will be the one her team is counting on to win, especially with her reluctance to potentially hurt someone with the hammer. Unfortunately for her, the rules expressly prohibit allowing anyone else to hammer away.\n\nMustang declares the first match to be Team Soda vs. Team Milk, with Soda first on attack. With a lot of reservations about hitting people, even with a toy hammer, Soda takes to the front of the box as Mustang gives the starting signal...\n\nAs expected, the slow-handed and comparatively violence-averse Soda struggles to properly land a hit. As Mustang warns of dwindling time, something unexpected happens. When Mary tries to retract from her hole...she gets her buxom bosom stuck on the edges. Despite urging cheers from the protagonist and Alice, plus Mary's own assurances, Soda is still reluctant to take a swing. In the end, the maid-turned-bunny only manages a singular light tap before Mustang blows the final whistle. Milk isn't too bothered by Mary's mishap, though she and Sugar grouse that they'll likely lose a few points due to the penalty. Milk grabs the hammer as Team Soda steps into the box...\n\nTry as they might, Team Soda can't quite dodge Milk's lightning-fast swings. By the time Mustang blows the whistle, Team Soda (mostly just Soda) is in low spirits. Soda's morale only worsens as Mustang reveals the loser did so by a single point, already making doomsday prophecies about her inadequacy costing them the match. After a few more moments of suspense, Mustang declares that the loser of Game Two is...Team Milk, as Mary's mishap cost them quite literally one too many points. Mary apologizes to the team for her game-losing blunder, but Milk simply looks on in silence as Mustang calls for the next teams...\n\nAfter Game Two ends, Mustang does a similar spiel as last time; disqualified teams can stay or go, everyone's free to do whatever until the third game starts tomorrow, \"Eeeeeentertainment!\", and departs. Though Alice is elated to keep on winning, Soda seems less enthused about their victory, and the protagonist can see why. Both this game and the last, they'd only narrowly scraped by. It's clear both to him and Soda that one roll of the dice that doesn't turn out in their favor is all it takes to knock them out of the running...\n\nSoda's Competition[]\n\nStill lost in her head, Soda strides over to Team Milk, where the fixers are still calmly accepting Mary's apologies. As the doctor invites the two to get dinner later, the mood soon sours as Soda steps into the conversation. Her attempts to commend the team on a good competition only serve to rile up Milk. The confrontational fixer is quick to anger, though Sugar is equally quick to cool things down. With a lingering twinge of frustration, Milk bluntly asks Soda about her motivations to compete. The maid's unsteady explanation of Maid For You's circumstances evokes a scoff from Milk.\n\nTo Milk, Soda is half-assing this entire contest. She's bet her entire squad's future on winning the golden chip, but when it's time to step up, she whines, complains, and bumbles in every game. Everyone could see Soda's milquetoast handling of the hammer during the whack-a-mole, even knowing full well it's a prop deliberately designed to cause as little pain and damage as possible. Milk isn't sore over losing in the second round. This is a contest after all, winning and losing is part and parcel, and everyone gave it their all even with a sudden substitution. But losing to Soda's team, when the leader is this much of a lily-livered whiner who can't muster up the effort? Someone who spews flowery motivations like securing her squad's future, but can't spare a lick of regard for her teammates who became sweaty and exhausted from the stuffiness of the box? Soda's performance was nothing less than a disgrace to this competition and everyone competing in it. That is what makes losing really sting to Milk.\n\nHer piece said, Milk storms off in a huff. Sugar stays behind and apologizes for her leader's out-of-line comments, but concedes she has a point. Like it or not, Soda doesn't seem to share everyone's else commitment, and advises her to think about whether she really wants to be here and give it her all. With that nugget of advice, Sugar also takes her leave...\n\nSoda reunites with Alice and the protagonist, but chooses to go straight to bed rather than eat dinner with them. Alice is worried about Twinkling Bunny's mood, but the protagonist simply advises her to let it be, believing Soda just needs some space...\n\nAfter dinner, the two head back to their team room. The protagonist worries that Soda may be crying or laying in a depressed slump, but Alice barrels in without a moment's hesitation. Soda welcomes them with a radiant smile, having tidied up the room again while she was here. The conversation seems amicable enough, but the protagonist notices Alice is calling Soda \"Green Bunny\" instead of \"Twinkling Bunny\" like she used to. When asked, Alice simply states that Soda isn't as radiant as she was before, so calling her \"Twinkling Bunny\" isn't really accurate anymore...\n\nWith some degree of shock, the protagonist double-takes. A look at Soda's face says it all; the smile on her lips might have passed a cursory glance, but a closer look at her eyes...they're blank and lifeless...\n\nPart II - Bunny's Coin Rush[]\n\nThird Game[]\n\nAs Day 3 of the Golden Chip Showdown dawns, the protagonist wakes up to warm sunlight, soft sheets, and...clanging glass? Despite the distinct sound of breaking glass, Alice is still sound asleep. The protagonist peers around and finds Soda hunched over the remains of a glass, having dropped it during an attempt to clean the room. The bunny-maid assures that the glass didn't cut her or anything, and he can leave her to handle the mess.\n\nSoon after, Alice also wakes up, regaling her teammates with the dream she had about them taking first place in the contest. The team collectively gets fired up to make that dream a reality...right up until Soda fumbles her cleaning and makes another mess. Alice moves to help her out as the protagonist muses on the somewhat rocky start they're having...\n\nAfter breakfast, the team checks the brackets to see who'll be their opponent for Round 3 and find it's an odd one; Team Folkwang, consisting of the perpetually-sweaty bunny-athlete and her Protocol tagalongs. Alice is excited to see \"Slippery Bunny\" again, when Rupee suddenly drops in...\n\nRupee asks the team if they've properly prepared for Game 3. Despite the protagonist's comment that no one knows the contents of each round ahead of time, Rupee notes that it's likely to be another physical activity, given the pattern with the past two games. She then turns to Alice and Soda, asking what kind of game they'd like to play for the next round. Alice is up for anything, though she hopes it's another running one, given how much she loved the obstacle course. Soda, on the other hand, seems lost in thought, and her ambivalence towards the game type seems less...enthusiastic.\n\nMoving on, Rupee reiterates that she'll be cheering from the sidelines with her Lupins, so now Team Soda has to win. At the protagonist's questioning, Rupee admits that her support is...not entirely out of the goodness of her heart, even though that is part of it. Turns out Rupee made a wager with her fellow Talentums on whether Team Soda or 777 would come out on top. The talk is cut short as Mustang calls all contestants to gather around for the third game, causing Alice and Soda to dash hand in hand towards the stage...\n\nSeeing the two bunnies go, Rupee notes a sort of gloom pervading Soda, having caught wind of the latter's tiff with Milk yesterday. The bunny-maid is definitely not in a good state of mind right now, but the protagonist is at a loss on how to handle it. Rupee suggests getting in touch with Ade and Cocoa to lift Soda's spirits, but the protagonist doesn't think that's a good idea. In all likelihood, the maids would give Soda an out to try and spare her any further pain, and he wants her to overcome this on her own.\n\nRupee is still a little worried, but accepts the protagonist's choice. She nudges him to get to the stage with the others as she fires up her stream to watch the games...\n\nCoin-Catching Soda[]\n\nGame No. 3 of the Golden Chip Showdown is...Raining Coins. As Team Soda cranes their necks to the ceiling, Mustang explains that each team's members will catch coins falling from above using their baskets. However, eggs will also fall down, and teams that catch an egg will be eliminated, with score based on gathered coins at the moment of elimination. Interfering with the other team in any fashion is immediate disqualification. Explanation over, Mustang calls the teams to pick up their baskets...\n\nAlong the way, Team Soda bumps into Folkwang and Protocol, who both seem to be a bit crestfallen. Novel is chafing from how contrary to her senses as a master(?) detective, absolutely no incidents or case-worthy mysteries have cropped up here. She admits that Mustang runs a tight ship on Coin Rush, but still wants something to happen so she can show her stuff as a self-proclaimed detective. Folkwang is moping from being unable to take her supplements...even though she tells Novel that she just took some supplements. In typical fashion, Folkwang is doping up going overboard with supplements, complaining that she only(?) took 19 doses instead of 20. As Folkwang's lost supplement stimulates the mystery-starved Novel, Exia pulls Soda aside to...ask her to do what she did yesterday?\n\nThe hacker admits that despite the energetic nature of her cohorts, frankly she's not too enthused to be here working up a sweat with everyone else, barely even putting any effort into the whack-a-mole. Going by her observations, she deemed Soda to be of the same mind. Soda herself weakly tries to deny the assumption, but it's clear to anyone that she's not in the mindset to really rebut. The protagonist tries to step in and help, but Mustang declares the commencement of Round 3, so the teams have to go to their respective positions. Soda stumbles away from a confuzzled Exia...\n\nThe games proceed apace, with Prima Donna snatching a win against their opponents. It's finally time for Team Soda and Team Folkwang to square off, and while Folkwang, Alice, and the protagonist are raring to go, Soda remains silent...\n\nWith only a few minutes left in the game, Team Soda does their best to catch coins and dodge eggs. Folkwang and Novel are doing much the same on their end, though Exia has completely clocked out in favor of looking for a secluded place to lie down. The sight of Exia just...giving up like that seems to trigger something in Soda, who's so dumbstruck that she doesn't notice the egg careening towards her head...\n\nSoda's thoughts go a mile a minute, even as her legs refuse to budge. The protagonist manages to pull her aside in time, but in the process spills her basket and its coins all over the floor. The protagonist urges Soda to focus and give it her all. Winning is ideal, but losing after taking their best shot isn't something to be ashamed of. Just then, a scream echoes from Team Folkwang's side...\n\nA glance reveals that an egg has cracked right on Folkwang's noggin, leaving her a kneeled sticky mess on the floor. Mustang blows the whistle as he calls it a game for Team Folkwang. While Alice and the protagonist scramble to grab coins and make up for Soda's lost basket, the maid-bunny herself is rushing towards the downed athlete...\n\nWhile Folkwang assures Soda that she isn't hurt, Novel is busy making a spectacle of her deductions. Based on previous events, she surmises that Folkwang tripped over the coins dropped from Soda's basket and ended up in the trajectory of an egg, leading to this incident. Soda is mortified at the idea that she caused another injurious mishap, but Folkwang claims otherwise. With her unique constitution and how much she's been moving around, it stands to reason that Folkwang has been sweating like there's no tomorrow, causing her shoes to become slick with the stuff and making her footing unsteady. If anything, Folkwang is more concerned that Soda has left her team out to dry, given how the game is still going. Soda jolts as she realizes the timer hasn't rung yet, and rushes back...\n\nAs the whistle blows for the time limit, an excited Alice and exhausted protagonist greet the sullen Soda. Mustang mulls over the pickle that has developed, as the match between Team Soda and Team Folkwang...is a tie. In accordance with the rules of the Showdown, both teams will have 30 minutes to take a breather before they must compete again...\n\nHead in the Game[]\n\nBoth Alice and the protagonist are a little annoyed that the game ended in a tie, but they had fun and are eager to win it for real next time. Meanwhile, Soda still seems downcast, especially as she asks the others...if she seems halfhearted to them...\n\nDespite her best attempts to step up, everyone around has been deriding Soda for not giving her all in this competition. When compared to everyone else, who've got sweat dribbling from their brows and fire in their eyes, it certainly seems like she alone isn't inclined to exert effort. That disparity is bad enough that Soda is considering dropping out of the Showdown. Not because she doesn't want the prize, but because she feels she lacks what it takes to surpass her rivals and win it.\n\nSoda explains she was never the competitive sort. Games to her were all about everyone having fun, not about winners or losers or getting exhausted and injured like what's going on here. Even getting this far is something she chalks up to the efforts of her teammates. It's a reasonable assumption to make after what's happened these past few games. She knows the protagonist got injured during the obstacle course, having noticed a bulkiness to his clothes and his subconscious attempts to avoid using his shoulder. She readily admits her hang-ups during the whack-a-mole were a major setback for the team. Even now, with the coin catcher, she cost her team a lot of points. Both from the basket she spilled when she couldn't dodge the egg, and from wasting time checking Folkwang when she could've spent it catching coins. She talks a big game as the leader of their team, but in reality, she's dragging everyone else down. If she's going to put her teammates through any more grief, then it'd be better for her stop here...\n\nDespite that, the protagonist asserts that Soda is misunderstanding this. They're not replaying Game 3 because she screwed up. They're doing it because they want to win something, and are putting every ounce of effort to do it. For Alice, that's getting a photo with Blanc and Noir. For the protagonist, it's keeping the Maid Cafe open, given how he's a frequent visitor. Soda tries to state that she wants the same thing, but the protagonist keeps pressing her. If she gives up here and the Maid Cafe has to shut down, what will become of it and her squad? Do Ade and Cocoa matter less to Soda than the feelings and wishes of the other teams here?\n\nSoda vehemently denies such. Even with how much of a bumbler she is, the others in Maid For You always gave her warmth and support. They're irreplaceable friends to her, and nothing will change that. The protagonist tells Soda he heard from Rupee that the rest of Maid For You is spectating this event (which is a lie), causing Soda's mind to go back to before all this occurred. Cocoa assured Soda that she wouldn't be alone with her teammates beside her, and Ade assured that if she thought it too difficult, she didn't need to push herself to win...\n\nSeeing the internal conflict on Soda's face, Alice wonders if they're pushing \"Green Bunny\" a little too hard...before Soda's expression sharpens. Her friends have come all the way here, after she promised them she'd give it a try. The least she can do is put her best foot forward, even if by the end of this things don't turn out the way she wanted. With renewed vigor, Team Soda readies up for a redo of Round 3...\n\nMustang declares the start of Team Soda and Team Folkwang's rematch, the whistle signaling the rain of coins and eggs from above. Team Soda divides their play area, leaving each member to catch coins in certain parts. As time ticks down, the eggs start falling with greater quantity and speed, Soda's warning giving the protagonist just enough time to dodge one falling behind him...\n\nMeanwhile, Folkwang is watching Soda and co. put their all into this match, with their leader seeming more composed compared to last time. Even as the athlete slips over her sweaty footing again, Soda remains on her side and focused on the game. Folkwang and Novel decide to kick things up a notch, while Exia continues to scurry about without participating...\n\nAfter the last five seconds elapse, Mustang signals the end of the game. Team Soda breathes a sigh of relief as they take a much-needed rest. Despite seeing their competitors pick up a lot of coins, there isn't as much tension as last time. Win or lose, they gave it all they had. In fact, Soda probably did the most work this round, keeping an eye out for eggs and her teammates. Especially with warning the protagonist earlier about an egg, and keeping Alice from getting overexuberant and spilling her coins. The praise and gratitude from her teammates lights a spark in Soda's heart. Hearing them talk about how much she helped them...is making her think they might just have a shot at winning this whole contest...\n\nAlice notes that Soda seems to be sparkling in her eyes once more, but the conversation is cut short by Mustang's announcement. After a few dramatic silences, the CEO declares the winner of this round to be...Team Soda. As the protagonist and the bunnies bask in their victory, Mustang makes his usual closing announcements.\n\nA sweaty yet triumphant Team Soda greets Folkwang, who finds herself less frustrated with her loss seeing how much her opponents pushed themselves to win. Soda feels remorseful over ignoring Folkwang's earlier slip, but the athlete rolls with it as another part of the game. She and Novel gave it their best, and it wasn't enough. That's just how it is sometimes. Seeing Folkwang hold out her hand for a handshake, Soda pauses for a moment before taking it. After another moment of awkwardness courtesy of Folkwang's sweating tendencies, Soda asks one last question; did it not bother them that Exia seemed to drop out of the game?\n\nNovel actually rejects the notion, revealing the hacker's hiding away was part of a plan. It's no secret that Exia is...not the most gifted...or inclined...when it comes to physical activity. So they actually agreed to have her wait out the storm in a safe area, rather than have her stumble about and risk getting egged for a few more coins. The hacker boasts with a smug grin that she contributed to the team in her own unique way. While Soda parses this new information, Folkwang and co. go their separate ways, leaving Team Soda to awkwardly stand around until the protagonist suggests getting some drinks...\n\nHow to Win[]\n\nAlice downs another drink before bounding off to order more, leaving Soda and the protagonist to sit and think. At the protagonist's prompting, Soda reveals her thoughts on how everyone she's competed against these past few games has handled the competition. Rupee streamed the race and everything else so she could share the excitement with her viewers. Milk just gave it her all and let her competitive spirit burn. Exia remained aware of her shortcomings and did what she could to not be a burden to her team. The coin catching-contest was the first time Soda actually made an effort to compete, which while commendable, says to her that their previous wins were all a matter of luck. If Rupee hadn't fumbled with her selfie stick, or if Mary didn't get stuck in her hole, then Team Soda's run and their shot at saving the Maid Cafe would've ended then and there. Even Exia gave her team a hand by making sure her faults wouldn't jeopardize their chances of winning. Compared to that, Soda feels as though she doesn't put in the effort. She'd made excuses about how she was in it to win it, but when it came time to actually clash with others, her aversion to conflict and violence kicked in.\n\nWith all that said, Soda is done with running away. She assures the protagonist that his earlier words didn't fall on deaf ears. Saving the Maid Cafe and her friends is the most important thing to her right now, more than sparing the feelings of her rivals or not letting anyone get hurt. So if she has to get a little rough and aggressive to achieve her goals...then that's what she'll do. Plus, with the protagonist and Alice backing her up, she has the confidence in making it all the way. The protagonist assures Soda that they'll stick together to the end, causing the maid-bunny to tear up...\n\nSoda admits that her earlier words about wanting to quit were a lie. She wanted to give her all and win the golden chip. Maid For You's future is riding on it, so giving anything less than 100% would be an insult to her friends and the cafe they made fond memories with. But this is her first time competing in something like the Golden Chip Showdown, and even knowing the stakes doesn't mean she won't feel bad seeing others get hurt or sad. Soda apologizes for having bottled her reservations up and simply complaining all the time. As the protagonist tries to stop Soda's tears, a pair of arms wrap around the maid...\n\nHaving come back from the bartender, Alice hugs Soda and pats her head, encouraging her to cry it out. Just like what the Queen tells her, sometimes letting your tears vent is the best way to handle it. Like this, Alice comments that the previous victory was the first time she's seen Soda look truly happy and radiant. That tells her this team is doing something right, and they should keep doing it until they reach their goal. She still wants to keep playing with everyone after all. As Soda promises to do her best through her tears and sobs, Alice and the protagonist wrap her in a hug until her crying stops...\n\nThe next day, the protagonist wakes up to warm sunlight, soft sheets, and...silence? A look around reveals that Alice and Soda are sound asleep. Alice is one thing, but Soda always woke up before anyone else to start cleaning the room. Seeing the maid-bunny in peaceful slumber brings a smile to his face...\n\nThe protagonist's shuffling ends up waking up Alice, who asks what's going on before the protagonist shushes her. The two notice Soda sleeping soundly, and Alice smiles at how peaceful \"Twinkling Bunny\" looks. She likely tired herself out from their late-night talk and her catharsis. The two agree to keep quiet as they get ready for the day, so that Soda can get as much sleep as she needs...\n\nLater in the morning, Soda profusely apologizes for sleeping in and being unable to clean the room. Alice assures that they understand why she would do so, and that getting more sleep was probably better for her anyway. Soda admits she does feel a little more light on her feet after waking up, though as she hops around to demonstrate, she ends up bumping into Volume...\n\nSoda apologizes, bracing for a scalding remark from the rapper. But rather than be angry, Volume and Prima Donna are more...intrigued. Truth be told, they didn't expect a ragtag bunch like Team Soda to make it all the way to the semifinals, so seeing them here without a shred of nervousness is interesting. The protagonist is hit with a sudden tension as he fully parses the situation; if Team Soda wins here, they'll face off against 777 in the finals, and with it...a shot at the golden chip. Meanwhile, Alice is confidently asserting that they'll win for sure. Prima Donna initially tenses up as Volume thinks they cheated and got some insider info, but Soda's determined response garners an understanding quip from Aria. Volume tries to get some clarification, but Noise points out Mustang's presence as Game 4 is about to begin. Both Prima Donna and Team Soda head to the stage to hear the announcements...\n\nAlong the way, Volume continues to pester her teammates about the reasoning behind Soda and Alice's confidence, so Aria spells it out for her. Team Soda has set themselves to give this their best shot, come what may. She warns that those who do not fear failure tend to be the biggest threats in these kinds of contests. Noise throws in her two cents, mentioning that she'd heard rumors of Team Soda's internal strife and even the possibility of them retiring, though judging by the earlier display, that's a load of hogwash. Volume concedes that Team Soda didn't get this far on luck alone, though Prima Donna as a whole is still confident they'll come out on top...\n\nStack Up, Soda![]\n\nBefore Game 4 begins, Mustang calls up the semifinalist team leaders to give a few words. Proud as ever, Volume makes it clear she has no doubts about her team's victory, getting a cheer from the crowd as she tosses the mic up and catches it. Alice and the protagonist usher Soda afterwards, who manages to power through her introduction and even slip in a promo for the Maid Cafe. Seeing Team Soda so cheery and composed, Prima Donna seems to get juuust a little unsettled.\n\nAs a set of wires lowers from the ceiling, Mustang announces Game 4 of the Golden Chip Showdown to be a stacking game. Players will be hoisted up into the air using wires and harnesses to stack up bars of gold, similar to the one Mustang is brandishing right now. The CEO assures that the bars are lighter than they look, as well as warning against stealing the bars as they are not real gold. While there is no set time limit, every member of each team must put on the harness at least once. Once every team member has gone at least once, the piles will be compared to see which team stacked taller. Players are not allowed to drop their bar until they are lifted to a designated height. Everyone has their own thoughts on this particular game, and the protagonist worries that his shoulder is going to undergo a lot of punishment on this one...\n\nSome time later, the first contestants get ready to stack. Alice steps up first, but finds the harness system tighter and more unwieldy than she expected. As a result, she ends up with a lower score than Team Soda would prefer. The protagonist tries to go next, but his shoulder flares in pain as he straps on the harness. The up-and-down motions of the wires will definitely make his injury act up. Soda notices this development and asks to go instead. The protagonist is uncertain about this given how this would mean he earns no points for the team, but Soda is set on this course of action. She may have dragged everyone into this to save the Maid Cafe, but Alice and the protagonist are just as important to her. She doesn't want them to overdo it or get hurt because of her own selfishness. The protagonist weighs his options; either foist the burden of this entire game to Soda, or risk making his shoulder injury even worse. After deliberating it, the protagonist apologizes and passes the buck to Soda, making her promise not to overdo it either. With a few final words to Alice, Soda straps in and lifts into the air...\n\nSoda stacks bar after bar, going so high that she sometimes nearly bumps into the ceiling. Alice marvels over Twinkling Bunny's persistence, given how much pain she felt as the harness dug into her body. Soda's exhaustion is noticeable as the rate at which she stacks slows down, until the final bar is placed and the harness lowers her down...\n\nA whistle signals the end of Team Soda's stacking, while Volume and co. are still working on theirs. Soda finally returns to ground level, where she flops in a heap as soon as her harness is released. The protagonist and Alice rush over to their leader, asking if she's okay. Given her labored breaths and the sweat pooling on her body, it's clear to see the maid-bunny pushed herself stacking as many bars as she did. Soda is more focused on whether or not they've a chance at winning, causing the protagonist to look over at Volume's team. Though their tower isn't high enough to cement a loss in his eyes, it's still enough to make victory an uncertain prospect...\n\nAs Mustang declares that Team Volume is done stacking, the members of Prima Donna are left huffing and puffing. Sure, the wires were tightly bound to ensure maximal safety even with a Nikke's weight, but the amount of digging and torsion from the system was sheer torture. Knowing that, Aria is impressed that Soda held on for as long as she did. Volume cares little for that, simply noting that they're at an advantage thanks to the protagonist not stacking a single bar. Noise isn't so sure, watching Team Soda catch their breaths until Mustang comes back with the results...\n\nTo the Finals[]\n\nIt's unsurprising, but still disappointing when Mustang announces Team Volume stacked more bars. The protagonist regrets not even trying to add to the tower, but Soda isn't hearing any of it. They tried their best, it wasn't enough, and she's made peace with that. Her reassurances are cut short as Mustang announces Team Volume made a mistake, much to the confusion of the performers. Mustang cites one of the rules he listed at the beginning of the game; Players may not stack bars until their wire system comes to a full stop. But the moment the wires began moving, Volume was already stacking. As Prima Donna bickers over the rapper's failure to listen to the rules, Mustang declares that the four bars Volume stacked from the beginning will be invalidated. The end result (much to Prima Donna's disbelief) is that Team Soda narrowly wins by two bars. Noise and Aria take the loss as best they can, though Volume storms off in a huff. Mustang caps off his ending announcements advising both Team Soda and 777 to bring their A-game tomorrow...\n\nThe Pain of Victory[]\n\nTeam Soda relishes in their comeback victory, Alice and Soda musing that even with how few days they've spent here, they still want to go back to their friends (Ludmilla and Maid For You respectively). Their talk is interrupted by Mary asking the protagonist and Soda to come in for a checkup, as the former's previous injury may have been worsened from this event, and she noticed the latter's body acting strangely. With Alice tagging along, the entire team is dragged to the infirmary...\n\nTo the protagonist's relief, Mary reports that his shoulder injury has not gotten overly worse. Had he actually tried to get in the wires and stack bars, it's likely he'd have completely busted his shoulder for some time. Soda's intervention prevented that from happening, though Mary notes that the maid-bunny's arms have suffered a 16% decrease in output after the stunt she pulled. The doctor hands the two some vitamins and muscle remedies to keep healthy, plus a threat word of advice against overdoing it in the finals. Team Soda thanks Mary and promises to take care as they step out...\n\n...right into Volume, who's been waiting for them in the main hall of Coin Rush...\n\nFinal Match[]\n\nSoda's apologies initially twinge at Volume before the Twinkling Bunny clarifies; she saw that Volume was stacking the bars prematurely, but kept mum due to her desire to win. Rather than be annoyed, Volume is confused at why Soda is sorry about it. This is a competition with what's effectively a blank check from a Big Three CEO at stake. Of course she'd let her opponents make a mistake if she thought it'd improve her chances. Prima Donna certainly wouldn't pipe up if it were Team Soda goofing up. The protagonist is surprised that Volume is taking the loss as well as she is, given her poor reaction shortly after Mustang announced the winner...\n\nVolume admits she was mad at losing, but it was more anger towards herself than anything. She'd gotten cocky because the protagonist didn't stack a single bar, and thought the game was already in the bag, even after seeing Soda soldier on like she did. She also failed to comprehend the rules or listen to her teammates, and that came back to bite her. With that, she's here to state her intent to cheer on Team Soda, hoping they'll make it past 777 and win it all. She gives one final fist bump to Soda and her well wishes before heading elsewhere...\n\nAlice cheers over the number of people cheering them on, while Soda parses the revelation she's had. This whole thing wasn't about beating your opponents or hating them. The Showdown fosters spirited competition and amicable rivalry. Knowing that, her reluctance to compete seems so silly in hindsight. The protagonist posits that Soda was afraid of receiving the resentment of others, a notion Soda admits along with her fear of people hurting her. That said, she's fully understood what this contest is about now, and can go into the finals with a clear mind. The team realizes that with the finals coming tomorrow, this is the last day they'll fully spend at Coin Rush. Thinking it a shame to leave without seeing everything there is, they decide to explore the second floor a little...\n\nTeam Soda stops by the Drink Zone, with Alice getting strawberry milk and the protagonist getting some water. Soda waffles over her order for a bit, only for Milk to suddenly pop up and order milk coffee for both of them. The gruff fixer pulls up a chair and sits right next to everyone. An awkwardness ensues as Soda apologizes to Milk...\n\nMilk takes the apology in stride. If anything, she's more miffed at the idea that Soda could give her all against an opponent, but treated her with kid gloves during Game 2. Soda admits she kind of did, as she was reluctant at the time to really clash with anyone even during a game. That's changed now, and she's going to win this, even if it means getting a little...rougher in her behavior.\n\nRight as Soda finishes talking, the milk coffees arrive. Soda and Milk each take a sip, and the former finds the beverage delightful. Milk's face beams as the atmosphere lightens up, believing anyone who likes milk coffee can't be all that bad. The fixer admits she rankled a bit at the loss she suffered to Soda, but came around after seeing how hard she tried during Games 3 and 4. It became clear to her that Soda is able and willing to clutch victory. That's why she wants a full-fledged showdown when all this is over. For now, Milk tells Soda to keep her eyes on the prize and get past the bunnies of 777. Soda feels her heart warm from the coffee and Milk's encouragement, though the protagonist can't help but notice the latter didn't pay her tab...\n\nWith their drinks finished, the team decides to head over to the Game Zone, where they can apparently replay the games they've competed in throughout the Showdown...\n\nThe Game Zone sees the team bumping into Exia, Rupee, and Folkwang, who're trying their hands at various games. The three are surprised to see Team Soda here, but it's a pleasant surprise. Rupee's eyes light up as she talks about Soda's efforts. It seemed to her that the maid-bunny had what it took to win, but had some trouble bringing it up to the surface until Game 4. Everyone is excited to see that same energy come into play against 777 and Rupee is excited to win her bet with the others in Talentum.\n\nExia challenges the gathered Nikkes to beat her records in the games, with Alice and Soda getting dragged into the fold. The protagonist watches on and muses on how far Soda has gotten. Just a few weeks ago, she was crying to him about how she had no one to team up with her in the Showdown. Now she's enjoying herself, surrounded by friends and teammates who keep ushering her on. Win or lose, this will be one of Soda's brightest memories. Coin Rush is filled with laughter and cheer as friends revel into the night...\n\nThe next day sees the protagonist wake up to warm sunlight, soft sheets, and...Soda coaching Alice on how to clean the room? Though the Twinkling Bunny has some lingering jitters from the impending final bout, this cleaning session has helped steady her nerves. Plus, she's got two teammates who unequivocally trust her. With a sense of determination, Team Soda gets ready for their final showdown...\n\nSoda the Climber[]\n\nMustang announces the beginning of the final day of the Golden Chip Showdown, and starts by introducing the teams that will be this year's finalists. Soda is surprised to hear the audience chant her name, but for her teammates, that just comes naturally with her getting this far. As 777 steps up to the crowd cheering for Blanc and Noir, Alice is overcome with excitement. The black and white bunnies she'd come all the way to see are right here. It further inflames her desire to win and get a photo taken with them. Soda is of a similar bent, set on winning the golden chip and financial support for the Maid Cafe...\n\nAs the protagonist hopes that Game 5 won't be too physically-demanding, Mustang snaps his fingers, causing three ropes to dangle from the ceiling. The CEO explains that the key to the golden chip is at the top of these ropes. First person to grab the key wins. To make things more interesting, the ropes have been randomly basted with slippery lubricants, meaning a careless climber may slip up and fall. At Blanc's question, Mustang clarifies that each team will nominate a member to climb up the ropes. Switching midgame will not be allowed, so they need to pick carefully...\n\nSoda smiles at how this is her turn to step up again. The protagonist is still recuperating from his injury, and Alice is clearly uneasy with climbing from how high the ropes go. Thus it's only logical that she go. Alice and the protagonist are concerned that Soda may be overdoing it, especially after how much she did during the stacking game. With only a small amount of concern, the team agrees to have Soda as their climber...\n\nSoda and Blanc stand before Mustang as the designated climbers for their teams. At his signal, the two Nikkes each grab the ropes and start scrambling upwards...\n\nIn the end, both Soda and Blanc reach the top at the same time, caught in a tense standoff before the key. The two bunnies trade banter over their motivations before lunging for the key. In the ensuing struggle, the key slips out of their grasps and tumbles off the platform. Blanc wonders what they're supposed to do now, before noticing Soda trying to do something and pleading for her to stop...\n\nMeanwhile, the teams await the result back at ground level. Team Soda and 777 only have a moment to register the key careening to the floor before they notice Soda rappelling down the ropes at dangerous speed. Blanc is sliding down as well, trying to warn off Soda from risking her life. Her pleas fall on deaf ears as Soda keeps reaching for the key, the lubricants on the rope making her slide faster and faster. Noir shouts for Blanc to tangle herself up in ropes and slow down her descent so she can catch the two as they fall. Blanc does so, and the result is...\n\nA trio of bunnies are all piled up on the floor, a little rattled from the impact but otherwise unharmed. Soda unclenches her fist to find it empty, and starts peering around for the key. Blanc points out that they're still entangled, so 777 and Team Soda spend some time getting their leaders out of the rope...\n\nMustang blows the whistle to signal the end of Game 5. After a few comments, he moves on to the results...\n\nDetermination, Effort, and Desperation[]\n\nMustang calls the team leaders forward to decide what happens from here. Due to the key falling off the platform, neither climber was able to obtain it. Normally, it would be a simple matter of a redo, however Mustang disapproves of Soda's life-risking attempt to slide down and grab the key. The fact that the maid-bunny is remorseful over her desperation getting to her doesn't change what she did. As a result, the CEO declares Team Soda disqualified due to their leader's recklessness endangering herself, Blanc, and Noir. Despite that, he commends Soda on the spirit she showed throughout the competition, and encourages her to keep her chin up.\n\nWith that said, Mustang declares 777 as the winners of this year's Golden Chip Showdown. Blanc is asked for a few words, to which the white bunny admits she found this to be too close a scrape. Were it not for the unforeseen circumstance of the key dropping off the platform, it's likely she would've been outpaced by Soda, who was determined to grab the key at all costs. Blanc holds out her hand to Soda, hoping to get a fair and square rematch in the future. After a few seconds in shocked silence, Soda takes the hand as the audience cheers both of their names.\n\nJust as Mustang is about to declare the Showdown over, Soda stops him to whisper something in his ear. The CEO decides that he can do this small favor for her, as it would a wondrous way to cap off this competition. He announces that all the bunny girls of Coin Rush will come onstage for a quick photo op, much to the crowd's delight. Alice is dumbstruck to find out her wish is being granted like this, but bounds on up at the protagonist's encouragement...\n\nThe bunnies all gather up on stage for a group photo. Even Folkwang and Mary get in on the action, though the former is already overheating from being being around so many other people. Alice is still delighted that her wish to take a photo with the bunnies is being granted, even if it was in a way she didn't expect. At Blanc's cue, the final moments of this year's Golden Chip Showdown are commemorated with a group shot of its gathered bunnies...\n\nThe protagonist ponders over how things turned out. In the end, they'd failed to quash 777's winning streak, and even got disqualified in the process. Despite that, one look at Alice giggling over her copy of the photos and most of the bitter feelings fade away. One could even say she looks happier than the victorious 777. Milk and Rupee throw their two cents in by assuring that Team Soda gave it their best shot. Folkwang and Volume even invite Soda to some of their events. When she's free at least, as Mary comes up from behind and makes it clear that Soda is slated for a trip to the hospital, especially since that stunt she pulled with the ropes has undoubtedly messed up her arms...\n\nAs even Blanc and Noir wedge themselves into the conversation, the protagonist looks at Soda's smiling face. There's no denying that everyone has grown at least a little from this experience, and Soda's social circle has expanded dramatically. Despite the unfortunate loss at the last stretch, he's confident that the intangible things they gained from competing will give them the vigor to walk out with a smile...\n\nHaving said her goodbyes to everyone, Soda is about ready to head back to the Maid Cafe. The protagonist notices she's unusually eager to leave, even so far as to try and avoid making eye contact with him and Alice. The protagonist stops her, notices the tears welling up in her eyes, and goes in for hug. Despite Soda's watery-sounding protests, her teammates shower her in gratitude for the time they've spent together. Unable to restrain herself any longer, Soda breaks out in a massive ugly-cry...\n\nSoda vents her frustrations and regrets, bawling about their loss and how it came about. She blames herself for overextending in her desire to win, costing them the match. Moreover, this loss has also cost her Maid For You's best shot at avoiding bankruptcy, leaving the fate of her beloved cafe uncertain. The protagonist and Alice assure her they'll figure out a way to save the Maid Cafe, with the former keeping Soda in his embrace. By the time the maid-bunny's tears stop, it's long gone dark outside...\n\nHaving finished her cathartic moment, Soda thanks her teammates for their support. Even if they didn't win, the Showdown was a blast to her, and she'd like to think they came out with a prize beyond the golden chip. Alice ends up mentioning Soda's friends, and how the protagonist said they were in the audience. If they're rabbits just like \"Twinkling Bunny\" is, then she'd like to get their pictures too. The protagonist stiffens as he realizes this may the moment his white lie is blown open. Soda simply remarks that they're not actually here, rather they offered their support in spirit. She knew the protagonist was telling a fib, but at the time, his words helped her focus on what really mattered to her.\n\nAfter a final exchange of gratitude, Team Soda departs back to where they each belong. Despite one final slip courtesy of Soda's klutziness, the three walk out of Coin Rush, hand-in-hand and smiling all the way...\n\nHard Mode Epilogue - The Maid Cafe is Back in Business[]\n\nIn the Nikke dorms, Soda frets over how to break her loss to Maid For You. She talked a big game as she went out to Coin Rush, but in the end, she came back empty-handed. Eventually she decides to just take the plunge and go see her squad. If they really have to close down the Maid Cafe and start over from square one...then so be it...\n\nArriving at the Maid Cafe shortly before opening time, Soda is shocked to find...a crowd gathered in front of the establishment? Why would so many people be here when the cafe isn't even open? Becoming flustered as people apparently recognize her from the Golden Chip Showdown, Soda pushes through the crowd to step inside. Off to the side, Alice points out Soda to Ludmilla, who is grateful to the maid for having shown her charge a good time. Ludmilla tells Alice to order whatever she wishes once the cafe opens. It's the least she can do for someone who took care of Alice...\n\nInside the cafe, Soda comes face to face with her fellow maids, who wonder just what she did during the Showdown to spur some weird events happening around the place. After some muddled attempts to explain on Soda's part, Cocoa clarifies that whether she won or lost doesn't matter. The problem now is that the Maid Cafe...has too many customers?\n\nAde explains that during the Golden Chip Showdown, the cafe's clientele suddenly saw a twentyfold increase and their ingredient stocks are struggling to keep up. Cocoa complains about how even her fastest service fails to stem the tide of customers, and everyone keeps asking when Soda will come in. Whatever the clumsy maid did during the competition apparently made an impression and more than a few fans...\n\nThat's not to say this increase in customers is a bad thing. Things are hectic, but sales are climbing to match. Even just a few more weeks of this should be enough to pull Maid For You out of the red. The other maids thank Soda for bringing them enough customers to save their cafe, prompting her to start tearing up. She'd resolved herself to at least give her best to save the Maid Cafe, so she could hold her head high even if they had to shut down. But for her wish to come true in such an unexpected fashion...\n\nAde remembers how the protagonist regaled them with tales of Soda's spirit, and his offer to provide financial assistance should it prove necessary. The maids encourage Soda to stop crying so she can greet their guests with a radiant smile. Settling down, Soda straightens up, and as the door bell rings open, she beams and greets the Maid Cafe's first customers of the day...\n\nGameplay[]\n\nTickets (Tetra Golden Chip Participation Badges) are spent to play stages and earn currency (Tetra Golden Keys) which can be traded in the shop for rewards.
