        "text": "Hi guys, I'm new to the forum and pool caring.\n\nHave the pool for a couple months and was taking care of it with dichlor only. And it was crystal clear.\n\nBut my pH was around 7 - 7.2 and last week I added sodium carbonate to raise the pH. The same night I shocked the pool.\n\nThe next day the water got cloudy, and remained like that for the next days. Now it is becoming greenish and cloudy and I don't know what to do. Chlorinating doesn't seems to be doing the job.\n\nThough about shocking it again, use a FLOC, brush the pool and drain the bottom.\n\nMy pool is vinyl and my filter is a glass filtering element or something like that.\n\nIf someone could help me out here, cause I don't want to fill my pool with unneeded chemicals that the stores try to push us.\n\nThanks in advance for the help!!\n\nAttachments\n\nIMG-20231128-WA0007.jpg\n\nIMG-20231128-WA0008.jpg\n\nWelcome to TFP! The best resource for many of your pool questions is our Pool Care Basics page. Great articles. But to some of your points:\n\n- Along with increasing the CYA too quickly, the dichlor may have been pulling your pH down. Stick to liquid chlorine if available.\n\n- Baking soda can influence TA quicker that pH, but it will cause changes. As long as the pH is anywhere between 7.2-7.8 you are fine.\n\n- Do not use floc. You'll cause more problems later.\n\n- To kill and remove algae, you must follow the SLAM Process completely. That page will do the trick.\n\n- The perform a SLAM Process, you must have a proper test kit. Either a TF-Series test kit or a Taylor K-2006C.\n\nI would encourage y ou to post a full set of water test results for us first and confirm how you are testing. Then we can get more specific to assist you. Enjoy the forum.\n\nWelcome to TFP! The best resource for many of your pool questions is our Pool Care Basics page. Great articles.

Then we can get more specific to assist you. Enjoy the forum.\n\nI'm from Brazil and don't have such test kits, unfortunately.\n\nI have been having some trouble, getting different reading by different test kits, drops and strips.\n\nTomorrow I will try and evaluate the parameters and will post it later here.\n\nAlso will post the parameters of my pool. Thank you!\n\nGreen is either caused by algae or iron, so I would think step 1 would be identifying why your pool is green.\n\nFor algae, we typically would recommend you do an OCLT to test and see how much chlorine you are losing overnight. That will be tricky without a test kit, but do you know your chlorine reading currently and when the last time you added chlorine?\n\nIn the US, iron staining is typically limited to water that comes from a well. Are you on well water or know if your water source contains iron? Many times if you have iron in your water you will see iron staining in bath tubs, sinks, toilets, etc. as well. Do you see any of that?\n\nGreen is either caused by algae or iron, so I would think step 1 would be identifying why your pool is green.\n\nFor algae, we typically would recommend you do an OCLT to test and see how much chlorine you are losing overnight.
