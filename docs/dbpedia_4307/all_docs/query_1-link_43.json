        "text": "Really, there is not much I could say about this drama anymore. :3 You know it, I know it, we all know it! I am just excited to watch it this summer (although I am not sure I will be able to follow the drama as it airs since summer = travel). It will start airing from June 9th and is starring Zhao Liying and Wallace Huo as leads!\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nYes! Another Update on the dramas/movies/TV shows so soon! While, it is because C-entertainment doesn‚Äôt sleep! üòõ So, what happened during the second half of May 2015? More stills came out, more projects were announced! So, let‚Äôs get to it:\n\nFirst, the drama God of War Zhao Yun is finishing up filming and is starting to advertise itself outside! Here are some pictures of YoonA in these.\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nThis will be the second collaboration between the two actors as they already worked together in very popular 2014 C-drama Boss&Me where Zhao Liying played the guffy and adorable Shan Shan and Zhang Han plays the perfect boss/boyfriend. In this new project, miss Zhao will play a strong woman with a boyish personality while Mr. Zhang will be an intellectual. The posters recently came out and sadly, I was not able to see the similarity between the cartoon version of the characters and the actors themselves‚Ä¶ LOL\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nOk, for all the C-enternainment maniac, you have to know these words because they are used so often in the Chinese Entertainment! Here we go: Continue reading ‚Üí\n\nOk, this comes as a shocker for me and there is NO proof that it is really happening. So yeah, let‚Äôs try to not jump to conclusion and try to focus on whatever little facts that are available. Also, don‚Äôt forget that whenever a star is filming a project, the leads of the say drama will often be rumored as an item. So, this may very well be speculations from the Chinese Media. Continue reading ‚Üí\n\nHere we go! There are a few stills and promotions for movies and dramas that came up during the past few days and I wanted to cover them without dedicating a huge post for each of them. It is mostly for you to know what is up in the C-entertainment and also because these stills are quiet pretty :3 First is the movie BuBuJingXin Êñ∞Ê≠•Ê≠•ÊÉäÂøÉ or also called Time To Love. It will star TW-actress Ivy Chen with her male leads: Tony Yang and Shawn Dou. As for now, only stills of Ivy Chen has been released so I am still waiting for male lead posters to see if the movie will be worth it or not. Continue reading ‚Üí\n\nZhao Liying must be the It girl of the moment, I mean she must be!! Both her big budget projects Hua Qian Gu and Legeng of Zu Mountain are getting a lot of media attention and a loyal fanbase waiting patiently (or not too patiently in my case) for the release of her dramas! Not only that, but right now, she is also filming new C-movie The Rise of a Tomboy with Zhang Han. Yes, you go girl! With the confirmation of Hua Qian Gu to be released this June (maybe June 9th based on the annoucement), I thought it would be 100% appropriate to put all my pictures of stalking her on weibo. :3\n\nBe prepared, there are a lot of pictures!!!! xD\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nForbes released this weekend (May 11st, 2015) the 2015 Forbes Chinese Celebrity List. Haha, Archidisign will be happy to know that more than 9 Â∞èÈ≤úËÇâ got on the list. Like the last three years, Fan Bingbing took the first list. Her drama Legend of Wu Zhi Tian helped a lot. Jay Chou, who got married this year, also received great quantity of media attention. At the third place of the podium is Nicholas Tse, who hosted a much loved cooking show at the end of 2014.\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí"
