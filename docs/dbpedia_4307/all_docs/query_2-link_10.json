        "text": "Right after receiving 5 awards at Saturday’s Golden Melody Awards ceremony, Sodagreen announced that they are going to take a three-year break to review their past and contemplate their future path.\n\nSodagreen, with its album “Winter Endless”, was the biggest winner at the ceremony in the categories of best Mandarin album, best band, best lyricist, best album producer and best musical arranger.\n\nThe album, a collaboration between Sodagreen and GermanPops Orchestra, is the band’s 10th studio album.\n\nThe project began in 2009 and was inspired by composer Antonio Vivaldi’s violin concerti “The Four Seasons.” The four albums were recorded and produced in Taiwan’s Taitung, London, Beijing and Berlin.\n\nThe band’s producer Lin Wei-zhe said they had planned to finish the album in two years. Instead it took them 6 years.\n\nLin said after those exhausting years, all six members agreed that a break is necessary.\n\nHe said they will do it when the “In Summmer” tour, which is scheduled from August 5th to October 9th in Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung is complete.\n\nSodagreen is no stranger to awards.\n\nFormed in 2001, the band was nominated for 7 awards in 2007 with the album “Little Universe” and won Best Band and Best Composer of Songs.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that except for its keyboard player Gong Yu-qi, who graduated from the Music Department of Taipei National University of the Arts, all other five band members are graduates from National Chengchi University.\n\nphotos source: 蘇打綠 Sodagreen Facebook"
