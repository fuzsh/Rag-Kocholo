However, clinicians are often unaware of patients’ symptoms (Bruera, Sweeney, Calder, Palmer, & Benisch-Tolley, 2001; Butow, Brown, Cogar, Tattersall, & Dunn, 2002; Chang, Hwang, Feueurman, & Kasimis, 2000; Newell, Sanson-Fisher, Girgis, & Bonaventura, 1998) and fail to recognize 50%–80% of these symptoms (Epstein & Street, 2007; Farrell, Beaver, Heaven, & Maguire, 2001; Ryan et al., 2005).",

        "text": "Problem Identification: Clinicians are unaware of most of their patients’ symptoms. Symptoms may be poorly documented and their impact underestimated. Undertreatment of symptoms may lead to increased symptom distress and decreased quality of life. Improving the communication of symptoms to nurses is vital in symptom management and quality-of-life improvement. Electronic patient self-report of symptoms may be beneficial.\n\nLiterature Search: An integrative review of the literature was conducted to describe the use of electronic methods for symptom self-report by patients with cancer and to inform best practices.\n\nData Evaluation: The final sample for this integrative review consisted of 36 studies (32 quantitative and 4 qualitative).\n\nSynthesis: Data analysis was used to summarize the findings of the 36 studies. Patients with cancer found electronic self-report of symptoms to be feasible and the devices usable. Electronic symptom reporting may improve patient–clinician communication, leading to improved physical and psychosocial outcomes."
