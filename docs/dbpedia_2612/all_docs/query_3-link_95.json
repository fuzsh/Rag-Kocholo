How Relationship Status and Cognitive Rigidity Affect Waits for Service Delivery\n\nSupervisors\n\nProfessor Dominique Alexi Greer (Associate Supervisor)\n\nAssociate Professor Frank Mathmann (Principal Supervisor)\n\nCitation\n\nWaits for service are an inevitable part of the service delivery process. Across three decades of research, the field has typically assumed that consumers will have similar reactions to waiting. Instead, this thesis uses four studies to show that reactions to waiting are impacted by a consumer's relationship status. Specifically, people who are single are shown to be more likely to cancel a request for service if they must wait, when compared with people in romantic relationships. This occurs because partnered consumers have higher sensitivity towards sunk costs in consumption, whereas single consumers have lower sensitivity towards sunk costs.\n\nKHAN, Maria Hameed\n\nThesis Title\n\nWorking in the Gig Economy: A Relational Perspective of Decent Work\n\nSupervisors\n\nProfessor Robyn Petra Mayes (Associate Supervisor)\n\nDr Jannine Catherine Williams (Principal Supervisor)\n\nAssociate Professor Penelope Joy Williams (Associate Supervisor)\n\nCitation\n\nThis thesis focused on advancing an understanding of the decent work of the gig economy from a relational perspective by interrogating three critical perspectives representing the triangular relationship underpinning platform-mediated care work. The insights from this thesis illustrate how relationality manifests in the complex social dynamics and interactions in work arrangements, ultimately contributing key relational dimensions to consider in examinations and interpretations of decent work in the gig economy and other work contexts.\n\nROJANAKIT, Patcharapar\n\nThesis Title\n\nSharing Economy in Emerging Economies\n\nSupervisors\n\nProfessor Uwe Dulleck (Mentoring Supervisor)\n\nAssociate Professor Rui Torres de Oliveira (Principal Supervisor)\n\nCitation\n\nThis thesis presents a study on the development of sharing economy organizations in emerging economies. The study identified and investigated major and minor impacts sharing economy firms receive from external business environment, including an examination on their internal strategies in containing the external forces. The study primarily uncovers five major external forces encompassing sociocultural, legal and political, economic, technological, and a novel semi-formal institutions determinant, while internal forces discussed were related to firms’ strategic resources and capabilities. Significant implications were provided in this research in relation to the advancement of the sharing economy pertain to theoretical, managerial, and policy practices.\n\nZHANG, Senlin\n\nThesis Title\n\nRule-Breaking and Entrepreneurs\n\nSupervisors\n\nAssociate Professor Elliroma Baltazar Gardiner (Associate Supervisor)\n\nProfessor Peter Joseph O'Connor (Principal Supervisor)\n\nCitation\n\nThis thesis focuses on entrepreneurial rule-breaking, a purposeful and discrete behaviour that entrepreneurs utilise to alleviate the regulating power of rules and institutions, which assists them to survive and thrive in the demanding entrepreneurial game. Challenging the popular belief that entrepreneurs are rule breakers and that their rule-breaking is rooted in deviance, a new construct - constructive rule beliefs - was conceptualised as a potential driver of rule-breaking and a theoretical model was proposed to explain how rule-breaking behaviour is embedded in social and commercial contexts. This research has important practical implications for entrepreneurs, policymakers, and society."
