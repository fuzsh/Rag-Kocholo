        "text": "Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist has dedicated his career to solving problems. An engineer by training, he uses thoughtful innovation, progressive reform, and efficient modernization of policies and programs to make the work better for hardworking families. From spearheading campaigns for equality and justice to harnessing technology to solve real problems, his focus has consistently remained on serving the public and getting things done.\n\nHe brings a lifetime of experience to the task, receiving his first computer at age five and setting up a computer lab in a Detroit community recreation center using computers that he built himself at age 16. Lt. Governor Gilchrist studied computer engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, graduating with honors, and later had a successful career as a software engineer at Microsoft, helping to build SharePoint into the fastest growing product in the company’s history.\n\nLt. Governor Gilchrist spent the next several years of his career as a social entrepreneur and community organizer who helped people in communities across America realize their full economic and political potential. Upon returning home to Detroit, Lt. Governor Gilchrist worked in local government to build systems that made the government more responsive, transparent, and accountable to city residents. This experience prepared him for a key priority: to bring Michigan’s state government fully into the 21st century on every level.\n\nAs part of the Whitmer Administration, Lt. Governor Gilchrist has sought to address injustice and inequity across our state at every level. From co-chairing the Michigan Joint Task Force on Jail and Pretrial Incarceration to helming the Coronavirus Task Force on Racial Disparities, these task forces have taken actions that saved lives and protected our most vulnerable populations. Lt. Governor Gilchrist’s approach to addressing these disparities is deeply rooted in fact-based practices, science, and connecting with individuals across Michigan.\n\nLt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist and his wife, Ellen, reside in Detroit where they are raising their twins, Emily and Garlin III, and daughter, Ruby.\n\nThe proud son of immigrant parents, Mayor Abdullah Hammoud has been an unwavering advocate for his hometown of Dearborn for more than a decade. As Mayor, he is committed to reinventing government to deliver results for working families and residents in every corner of the city.\n\nThroughout his career, Mayor Hammoud has provided bold leadership for Michigan and Dearborn with a thoughtful, pragmatic approach to government that puts people first. As the city’s seventh mayor, that will include investing in infrastructure, improving public health and safety, and delivering quality services while lowering the tax burden on residents.\n\nIn three terms representing Dearborn in the Michigan House of Representatives, Mayor Hammoud has pushed for resources and shaped policy to improve quality of life and create a more resilient city. That work secured nearly $100 million in direct investment in transformational infrastructure projects such as the Miller-Rotunda Bridge. He remains committed to addressing Dearborn’s aging infrastructure while pursuing innovative solutions to mitigate chronic flooding and upgrade technology to improve the city’s operations.\n\nHis deep roots in environmental advocacy date back to his election as the youngest member for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters in 2014 where he fought to protect Michigan’s land, air, and water, and develop environmentally conscious policy. As State Representative, he rallied the community to hold polluters accountable and provided the blueprint for the current policy passed by City Council to improve Dearborn’s air quality.\n\nBlending his background in epidemiology and finance, Mayor Hammoud has also served as a state and national health expert advising major health care systems where he developed strategies to maximize revenue streams, create cost-saving strategies, and identify gaps in health care coverage. This included helping manage the $45 billion UAW Retiree Medical BenefitsTrust Fund while at the Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation, as well as serving as the Vice Chair of Michigan’s $30 billion Health and Human Services Budget in the Michigan House of Representatives. As mayor, he will use this experience to help properly fund Dearborn’s pension system and maximize city revenue while creating cost-savings that provide tax relief.\n\nA product of Dearborn Public Schools and three-time graduate of the University of Michigan, Mayor Hammoud believes in the transformative power of education. He has master’s degrees in business administration and public health, and a bachelor’s degree in science.\n\nHe and his wife, Dr. Fatima Beydoun, are excited to raise their family in Dearborn and advocate for children and families across the city.\n\nKristine Donahue, R.N., B.S.N., M.B.A. is president of Corewell Health’s Beaumont Hospitals in Taylor, Trenton, and Wayne. She has operational oversight of the three community-based hospitals with a total of 472 beds.\n\nShe directly leads and engages site leadership to design and implement regional and site-based strategic plans, business strategies, and policies and procedures that are aligned with comprehensive goals for performance and growth.\n\nDonahue became administrative co-lead for the Trauma Clinical Care program for Beaumont Health this year. She plays a vital role in assessing coding and billing, developing a system trauma dashboard, creating standards of care for the geriatric population, and assessing the impact of no-fault auto law legislation changes and patient access to appropriate care.\n\nShe has served on the Community Advisory Board for Taylor, Trenton, and Wayne, and the Community Development Board since 2018.\n\nPrior to her appointment to this role, Donahue served as COO for Taylor, Trenton, and Wayne hospitals from 2019 to 2022.\n\nShe served as CNO at the Taylor hospital from 2013 to 2021 and the Wayne hospital from 2018 to 2020, with oversight for overall inpatient nursing productivity and delivery of patient care.\n\nShe joined Beaumont in 2010, working at the Dearborn hospital. Since then, her roles and responsibilities have consistently increased.\n\nShe earned a Bachelor of Science in nursing from Oakland University and a Master of Business Administration from Central Michigan University. She is a CNO Academy Graduate and an Oakland University Nightingale awardee. She has a Six Sigma Green Belt."
