        "text": "A life science industry in Odense? The life science industry in Odense is thriving 💹 In 2023, the industry employs over 3,000 people alone in Odense, and there is a noticeable growth in the companies' revenues. Companies in Odense collaborate closely with the Syddansk Universitet - University of Southern Denmark and Odense University Hospital to ensure the industry's growth and have thus joined forces in the Life Science Fyn association. Read the exciting article from MedWatch here: https://lnkd.in/e_uiw8cZ If you want to learn more about the industry, feel free to contact Investment Manager Lone Knudsen Krogsbøll Read more about the industry in Odense here: https://lnkd.in/epnnyQHi #biotech #lifescience #lifesciencefyn #cityofodense\n\nHOW TO ADDRESS 5.0 TRANSITION: the European CoDEMO innovation approach CoDEMO Webinar #1 Organizer: CoDEMO Consortium Date/Time: Feburary 27, 2024; 13:30 - 14:15 CET The European project CoDEMO fosters the development of 5.0 innovation capabilities in 3 main activity sectors: 👉 Industry, 👉 Healthcare, 👉 Agritechnology. The webinar will cover key questions for any innovative organization: 👉 Which developement opportunities with 5.0 innovation? 👉 How to support 5.0 job transformations, with skills and competence development ? 👉 Which socio-economic collaborations and networks can help companies or organizations to manage the 5.0 transition? The first objectives of #CoDEMO #EU #project are 👉 To boost socio-economic collaborations on 5.0 innovations by creating 6 national networks and physical/virtual infrastructures for 5.0 value co-creation projects and the production of 24 case studies and 👉 To create a unique European Open Badge Certification for ‘Decision-Makers for 5.0 Organizations’ (Delivery curricula in 6 countries) A long-term, open & active international community on 5.0 value co-creation has been launched, supported by an innovative e-platform including #knowledge sharing as well as skills and competence #recognition. ℹ Event page: https://lnkd.in/eMxEFXZr 🔎 Follow the project: https://lnkd.in/eKP9eFSu\n\nBecoming one of the partners of BioWin - The Health Cluster of Wallonia was an important step, because it allowed us to further empower our involvement in the Life Sciences industry! In 2024, we are shifting in a higher gear! We supported BioWin - The Health Cluster of Wallonia in creating a key white paper outlining the 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐲 𝐌𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐬 (𝐀𝐓𝐌𝐏) landscape in Wallonia, along with the development of an ATMP infographic. We're incredibly proud of our Akkodis Belgium Medical Communication Team! Thanks to their expertise, BioWin - The Health Cluster of Wallonia can disseminate important data and information on advanced therapies in a much more approachable and effective way. Looking ahead, we're excited to continue this partnership and assist more companies in creating white papers, executive summaries, and infographics. 👉 𝐖𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐓𝐌𝐏 𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐖𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐚?

Our event aimed to address these concerns and engage local politicians in finding solutions that can elevate Fyn and Sønderjylland to the same level as Copenhagen and Aarhus. At the core of this effort is the creation of local jobs in the Life Science industry. In this aspect, the news about Novo Nordisk planning to build a new production plant in Odense marks a significant step forward for our region in the Life Science sector. However, as we celebrate this major milestone, it's crucial to remember that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain the backbone of our local Life Science ecosystem. Supporting them is essential to ensure the sustained growth and innovation of the industry. The goal is to bolster the entire Danish Life Science industry, where the conditions for development, innovation, and growth are ripe. This is particularly true on Fyn, where we must adjust the framework to accommodate the needs of small businesses and provide opportunities for SDU graduates to remain in the local area after completing their education. Life Science may not be everyone's field, but Fyn and Sønderjylland are our shared concerns. We hope that the politicians' attendance and active participation in this meeting will contribute to a brighter future for our local Life Science industry. Thank you to everyone who joined us! 💪🔬 #LifeScienceFyn #LocalIndustry #CommunityImpact In attendance were: 👥 Jesper Petersen (S) 👥 Niels Flemming Hansen (KF) 👥 Katrine Daugaard (LA) 👥 Ulf Bech Christensen, CEO Pentabase 👥 Leif Hindsted, CEO, Positio ApS 👥 Anders Bojesen, AB Genetik 👥 Diana Arsovic Nielsen, CEO Danish Life Science Cluster 👥 Hans Atli Dahl, CEO Amplexa Genetics Photo: Jacob Fredegaard\n\n🎉 Today we celebrate the birth anniversary of Friedrich August Kekulé, born on 7 September in Darmstadt. In 1858, Kekulé demonstrated the tetravalence of carbon and its ability to form long chains by bonding its atoms together. However, his greatest contribution to science was undoubtedly the discovery of the cyclic structure of #benzene, a compound widely used today in the chemical industry for the production of plastics, resins, and more. 🧪 However, are you aware of the captivating anecdotes that shroud the discovery of benzene's structure? Take a look at the article \"Chemistry's visual origins\" to find out: https://lnkd.in/dUe2JgjP 🔎 To explore the chemical products available at the Fisher Scientific channel, we invite you to visit our website.

Yesterday, I had the honour of hosting a panel at this years CIC organized by CLIB - Cluster Industrielle Biotechnologie. The discussion was dealing with biomanufacturing. The big question the experts were discussing: how can we extend biomanufacturing Europe-wide? Ute Schick from Evonik, Mary McCarthy from Soffinova, Mariagiovanna Vetere from NatureWorks, Max Kroymann from BMWK and Juergen Eck (Ph.D.) from bio.IMPACT concluded: 1) we should go for public-private partnerships for funding the new plants. 2) We should be more self confident in Europe. Why? Because we are great in what we do! 3) let us harmonize regulations globally. 4) increase public acceptance, also with more innovative education. 5) finally we said: impact comes with scale! Was a great event! Thanks for organizing!\n\nIn our Easter egg, as the largest value-driven science park dedicated to life science in Scandinavia, we bring an ambition to play a key role in shaping discussions on the life science industry’s needs, together with stakeholders like elected representatives at local, regional, and national levels. For the life science industry to thrive, it’s crucial that we act together towards creating favorable conditions for research, innovation, and growth in Sweden. We promise to keep doing our part, as a progressive member of the life science innovation cluster in Lund, Skåne, Sweden, and Medicon Valley.
