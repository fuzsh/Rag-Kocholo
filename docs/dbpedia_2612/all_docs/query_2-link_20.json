Another \"first\" to our cre dit was our \"Fresh­ man Follies.\" Encour aged by tha t success, we presented a unique (and fortunately, pri­ va te) inte rpre tationof THE MIKADO. Rut our production of the first annual Christmas Pageant enti tled \"Christmas inMany Lands\" was just as fort unately public, ifwe may judge from audience response. Our caroling was also begun tha t year, but on a small scale; already conscious of the Sacred Heart \"fam­ ily\" tradition ,we carolled the community by cand lelight one evening and next morning began the tradition of a surprise cap and gown Mass by way of saying \"thank you\" to our beloved faculty.\n\nKa rol ee Ku ban,pres ide nt,Ma rga retFa hls trom,Mar ie Mat he w\n\nStu dent Bod y, Se pt em be r, 195 2 From to p of stai rs: Rosem aryCastil lo ,Arl ine Ray ­ mon d, Ann Li sta , Fai th Br ow n, Le annMah on ey , Ka th lee nBrop hy ,Barb ara Ca nn on,Ma rga ret Fahl- str om , Rob bi e Hu tto n,Ast rid Vel as qu ez , Judy Mon a- ha n, Bar bar aBa ret ta,Mara Le e Cip ro,Ev el ynKra d Ma ry Bi ng gc li, Jacqu eli ne Ke arn s, Caro l R id de ll, Paula Sabin , Jane t Conte nt ,Ter ryTru it tHa na fin , Ka th lee n Mc Go nig le, El ayne La ng enieu x,Ma rie Mat he w ,Elsa Qui ro z,R.N. , Lil lian Jimen ez ,Ma ry Eby , Car olRe ill y,Don na Bo yd .\n\nJanuary 30, 1953 marked a \"One-Year- Old Par ty\" for the college, and shortly after that we elected our first studen t-body officers.

But, with the help of our counselor, Mother Frances Danz, we managed to amuse the upper-classmen with the portraits we painted of their future antics in our FRESHMEN FOLLIES.' Class officers that year were Valmere Dessert, Lidia Fon– cerrada, and Carol Farrell. Our sophomore year, under the guidance of Mother Susan Campbell and officers - Virginia Rodee, Carol Farrell, and Joan Young - was filled with memorable activities from dinner aboard Admiral Rodee's U.S.S. Prince– ton to the unforgettable thrill of the BAL DES FLEURS in May. We were saddened by the loss of Rosa Maria Molina that summer, but Colombian shores beckoned her. Charming to the end, she bid us all good-bye at a farewell tea at the La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club. Joan Young, Joann Wigchert, Lidia Foncer– rada, Joan Beretich, Gail Henderson, Eliza– beth Vopateck, Dale Tallman, and Noelle Onorato left us to be married, but they have kept their promise to keep in touch by corre– spondence.

The Har– vest Dance gave us our first opportunity to prove that we were seaworthy, and we passed with flying colors. Midterms, Christmas par– ties, and finals flew by with unbelievable speed.

Following the election of permanen t offi­ cers in December, 1954, freshman-class life began at the San Diego College for Women. Guided by their counselor, Mothe r Sally Furay, and officers—VirginiaRauseh, Patricia\n\nGonzales, Ann Dyer, and Adrienne Kuhe — class members made plans for daily advance­ ment in spiri tual, intel lectual, and social endeavors. Aswimming and supper party, given Janu­ ary 9 by Arlene Glenn at her home in National City, united the class of '58 in its first off- campus activity. Feb ruary found freshmen roasting weiners at Presidio Park, and making plans for their first dance, \"The Play's the Thing ,\" February 19. El Monte was the scene of the March picnic for freshmen and their date s. Georgia King e nte rtai ned the class at a buffet luncheon in the garden of her La Jolla home during April. Concludingthe excitement of final examin­ ations , the spring prom, and commencement exercises, the class of '58 gathered at Hotel del Charro in La Jolla for its class brunch, May 29. With its initiation ofa summe r news­ let ter , the class began a new tradition for freshmen at S.D.C.W. Retu rning to college as sophomores in Sep­ tember , 1955,class members devoted all their leisure time to helping \"Littl eSisters.\" First on the calenda r of e vent s was a \"Swim with the Sophomores\" par ty at the Town and Count ry Clubin Mission Valley.

Class officers — Virginia Rausch, Ann Dyer, Jean Fea therstone, and Mary Lee Wible — with class counselor, Mothe r Susan Campbell, began planning anothe r full year for the class of '58. An e vening picnic, heldOctober 15 at Pepper Grove in Balboa Park, provided an opportunity for sophomores and thei r dates to demonst rate outdoor cooking skill. With the approach of the holiday season , the class once more gathered at Arlene Glenn's home for a buffet supper following the tradi tion Chri st­\n\nmas pageant. The New Year brou ght resolutions for big­ ger andbetter class reunions. Patricia McNair was the first to make these dreams come true. The weekend following the annua l retreat, she invited all her classmates for two days of snow-filled fun at Crestline in the San Bernar­ dino Mountains. All atten tion and talents were then focused on Sophomore Serenades and the BAL DES FLEURS, the annual events which the Sophomores sponsor as a final tribute to the graduatingclass.\n\nCaro l T ru xa w, Cec ile Ra inier, Ann e Ag ge ler , MaryBo rba ,Rose Mar ie Ghio\n\nDevona Crise, Hilary Broad, Mary Reh; seated: Barbara Carlisle, Anita Velazquez, Patricia Brown\n\nBeverle Bell, Patricia Wohlgemuth, Sandra Jelinek; seated: Georgia King, Patricia McNair, Gael Lauff\n\nn I\n\nBarbara Rogers, Beverly O'Connor, Nancy Adams, Jane Lauerman; seated: Adoracion Remo, Betty Francis, Patricia Welch\n\n,\n\nClaire Ehlers, Gloria Ravettino\n\n-\n\nFreshmanClass History As we stood there at the bottom of the ladder , it looked like a long climb.

December brought our firstChris tmas Ball, wh ile many of us par ticipated actively in the pageant, \"American Christmas, \" the following week. On January eighth, the day student s enter­ tained the residence student s at a post-Christ­ mas buffet supper at Irma Serrano's home.

The originalmembers were Lillian Jimenez, Jacqueline Kearns, Margaret Fahlstro m, Elayne Langenieux, Paula Sabin, Diane Sinclair , Mary Louise Turne r. At thei r first meet ing, Elayne was elect ed pres ident; Pau la, vice p resident; and Margare t, secretary . Main taining their posi­ tions for two years, these officerswere of great help to thei r moderator, Mother Parks, in establishing as college tradit ions all the special Sacred Heart devot ions, processions, and practices.\n\nThe Lily Procession was i nstituted in 1952 and the May Crowning in 1953, while the above members were still aspirants. Then, as Children ofMary, their first corporate act was to establish in 1954 a Gu ard ofHonor for the Sacred Heart on First Fridays. The following year, a parallel Guard ofHonor was instituted for Our Lady. On St. Madeleine Sophie's Feast, 1955, Joan Fennell, Ruth Jimenez, Constance Sal­ erno, and Mary Scott were received into the congregation; and on Oct ober 20, 1955, Beth Ann Smith, Mary AnnDa ly, Rosemary Cas­ tillo, Kathleen Wollstein, Virginia Rodee, Carol Reilly, and Mary Jimenez. The most\n\nrecent reception on February 3,1956 included Rosanne Biane, Carol Farr ell, and Patricia Keane. Unde r the patronage of Blessed Philippine and the instruction of Mother Furary , many freshmen are acquainted with the ideals of the ChildrenofMary. They are invitedto join the Aspirants ofSt. Madeleine Sophie unde r the direction of Mother Campbe ll in their sophomore year. All — pre-aspi rant s, aspir­ ants , and members — strive daily \"to make interior life of the soul of (t he ir )daily life,\" bu t special honors go to Mary Turne r, who has been elected three years in succe ssion to crown Our Lady at the end of the scholas tic year in May.\n\nReligious Affairs\n\nTh e Pres ident, Vice-President, and Secre­ tary of the Chi ldren of Mary and two repre­ sent atives from each class are the members of this commi ttee,established under the Consti­ tution of S eptembe r, 1954.

In the spring semester the Speakers' Bureau plans and solicits th e cooperation of the stu­ den t body for the Public Relations program of sending speakers to the private and public high schoolsof the area. The present officers: Marilynn Mayer, Chairman first semester; Mary Jimenez, His­ torian; Paula Sabin, Chairman , second sem­ ester.\n\nThe Speaker'sBureau was initia ted March 29,1954. It is aChrist opher movement center­ ing on the Apostleship of Speech. Its purpose is to provide its members with the opportunity to express themselves, to exchange ideas, to deve lop poise in speech, andto practice lead­ ersh ip on and off campus .

In November, 1954, Mary Scott was elec ted chairman andRuth Jimenezsecretary. In the fall it has organized Student Con­\n\nTh e Stud ent Council\n\nBased on \"the princip le that all authority is derived from God and rests with His repre­ senta tives and with those to whom any share of His governing power is dele gated, \" acon­ stitut ion was drawn up, in the summer of 1954, providing for a cooperative form of government to be administered by faculty and students working toge ther . Prior to this timethe studentbody hadbeen governed by Kathleen McGonigle as presi­ den t (1952-1953 and 1953-1954), Mary Bing- geli as vice-president (1952-1953and 1953- 1954 ), Constance Jimenez as social chairman and Joan Hall as secretary . In Sept ember 1954, Kathleen Brophy was elected social chairman and Janet Contant as secre tary. According to the new const itution the elections of 1954-1955 called for student-body officers who would also head standing com­\n\nmittees in the college. These officers, class pres idents, and special delegates from the classes compose the student council . Student- Body officers for 1954-1955 wer e: Jacqueline Kearns, Ka thl een Br ophy ,Ma ry Tu rner , Leann Mahoney, and Lillian Jimenez. The funct ion of the Studen tCouncil is to foste r understanding and cooperation be­ tween Faculty and Studen t Body by repre­ senting the views of t he Studen t Body to the Administration. This representation is made to the Presid ent of t he College,Mothe r Cath­ erine Parks, Mode rator of t he Council. Th e aim of the Studen t Council is to up­ hold the college motto \"THAT ALL MAY BE ONE,\" and in so doin g foster the \"family\" trad ition, whichis the her itage of all colleges of the Sacred Heart.\n\nSand y Schw arz ma n, Pre sident, Fre shm an Cla ss; Vir gini a Rau sch , Pre side nt, So ph om oreCla ss; Ka roleeKuh an, Pr esi dent, Sen ior Clas s; Jane Petty , Cha irman Re sid en ceCo mm itt ee ;El ay ne La ng en ieu x,Pre side nt of the Ch ildr en of Mary; Ch airma n, Re lig iou s Affair s; Mary Turne r, Vic e-Pres ident;Cha irman, Soc ial Affair s; Ja cq ue lin eKearns, Pr esi dent of Stu dentBod y; Cha irma n, Welf are Com ­ mitt ee ; Vi rg inia Ro de e, Re cor ding Sec reta ry; Cha irman, Publi cit y; Leann Mah on ey ,Co rre spondin g Sec reta ry; Cha irman, Ho ste ss Comm itte e;Arl ine Ray­ mond ,Pr esi de ntof W.A.A .; CarolFar rell, Pre side nt,Junior Cla ss; Ann Dy er , Vice - Pr esi dent, Sophom or eCla ss; An gel Kraemer, Vic e-P res ident, Fre shman Cla ss mi ssi ng .\n\nHostess Committee Inaugura ted for gracious greetings, the Hostess Committeeaims at enter tainingvisi­ tors at the college in order tha t their stay may be enjoyed and remembered.
