During the year, 787 properties were sold, comprising 106,000 rooms worth EUR 16.9 billion. This remains significantly below 2019 levels but is only 4% short of the 2022 total. In the last quarter, volumes reached ‚Ç¨5.4 billion, a 13% increase relative to Q4 2022 (‚Ç¨4.8 billion). Several major individual deals drove these volumes, including the sale of the Westin Paris Vendome, the Center Parcs Allg√§u in Germany, the Six Senses Hotel Rome, the Mandarin Oriental and Hotel Sofia in Barcelona, and Haymarket House in London (office to hotel conversion).

ST Clair developed it originally as a hotel and I got to tour the property with him . It didn‚Äôt get to open as a hotel, yet under Marriott and Las Brisas it should be a success. It‚Äôs a great location just two minutes walk to the isla verde beach. It‚Äôs close to hotels üè® and restaurants . They will probably need more parking but There‚Äôs alternatives close by. üü°There are other hotels üè® for sale and buildings that are prime for conversion to hotels, apartments or short term rentals. There are local tax credits of 30-40% of the investment that it could qualify for. If you‚Äôre interested in investing in such properties DM me for information. #investinginrealestate #hotelinvestment #shorttermrentals #puertoricorealestate\n\nWhere‚Äôs the New York City Hotel Market? Apparently showing ongoing signs of recovery‚Ä¶ 1 Hotel Central Park sold yesterday for just above $1 million per key. According to New York City sales records from 2023 and 2024, upper-end hotels (Mondrian, The William Vale, and 1 Hotel Central Park) are trading between $800K and $1 million per room. Mid-market properties (like Hampton Inn, Hilton Garden Inn, and Doubletree) ranged from $400K to $600K per room. Distressed sales (the Roger Smith, Row NYC) were around $200K per key. Is the landscape shifting? What are your thoughts? #NewYork #Hotel #Hospitality #RealEstate #PrivateEquity"
