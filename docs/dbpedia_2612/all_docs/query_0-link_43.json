I figure the way the current was moving had something to do with it. but if that was the case, how did the second Nembrotha know when to stick its own organ out just when its mate was getting near - but not yet near enough to touch.\n\nLocality: Samal island, Davao gulf, 40-50ft, Philippines, pacific, 23 December 2006, wall, reef face.

I found it at 8 m on a divesite known as \"Neptune's Garden\". It was crawling among green ascidians, but I didn't observe it feeding.\n\nCrawling length: 42mm November 13, 1996.\n\nRegards,\n\nMary Jane\n\nmjadams@earthlink.net\n\nAdams, M.J., 2000 (Aug 9) Nembrotha lineolata from Papua New Guinea.

Unfortunately I have no details as to the exact nature of the surface on which they were found but they were also part of those found in the Tukang Besi Islands in SE Sulawesi last October. Looking forward to your comments on these. The opisthobranch species count for this area is now 70 and growing.\n\nMany thanks for your help.\n\nAll the best\n\nLindsay Warren\n\n100014.2112@compuserve.com\n\nWarren, L., 1998 (Apr 22) Nembrotha from SE Sulawesi.

[Message in] Sea Slug Forum. Australian Museum, Sydney. Available from http://www.seaslugforum.net/find/85\n\nThis is a species of Nembrotha, but there is still no clear understanding about whether there is one species with a variable colour pattern or a number of species with a pattern of brown lines. Names in the group include Nembrotha purpureolineata O'Donoghue, 1924, Nembrotha rutilans Pruvot-Fol, 1931 and Nembrotha lineolata Bergh, 1905. ...Bill Rudman\n\nRudman, W.B., 1998 (Jan 9).
