A lot of patients sustaining hip fractures are frail with multiple comorbidities and death might not be preventable. It is increasingly recognised that hip fracture patients have predominantly medical needs and therefore should have senior medical input from admission. It is now widely accepted that prompt effective, multidisciplinary management with a fully integrated orthogeriatrician is the best model of care.[2]\n\nKey elements of good care include:\n\n- Prompt admission to orthopaedic care\n\n- Rapid comprehensive assessment: medical, surgical, and anaesthetic\n\n- Minimal delay to surgery\n\n- Accurate and well-performed surgery\n\n- Prompt mobilisation\n\n- Early multidisciplinary rehabilitation\n\n- Early supported discharge and ongoing community rehabilitation\n\n- Secondary prevention, combining bone protection and falls assessment.\n\nAdvantages of such collaborative care include:\n\n- Overall improvement in standards of medical care\n\n- Minimal delay to surgery caused by medical problems\n\n- Improved management of perioperative medical complications\n\n- Better coordination of multidisciplinary team work\n\n- Improved communication with patients and relatives\n\n- Reduction in adverse events, including preventable deaths.\n\nThere are various models of care for hip fracture patients. These are grouped into four main categories[3]:\n\nOrthopaedic ward and geriatric consultants service at request\n\nOrthopaedic ward and daily consultative service\n\nGeriatric and rehabilitation ward and orthopaedic consultant service\n\nOrthopaedic ward and integrated care with geriatrician.\n\nWorldwide, different countries have adopted different approaches to managing these patients. In Australia, “The Orthogeriatric Model of Care” [4] emphasises the need for care of these patients by an orthogeriatrician in an integrated service, and also early surgery within 24 hours if the patient is medically stable.[5] Similarly, in the USA, a geriatric fracture centre where hip fracture patients are co-managed by geriatricians and orthopaedic surgeons led to better outcomes in terms of shorter times to surgery, fewer post operative infections, but showed no difference in in-hospital mortality.[6] In Spain, early multidisciplinary daily geriatric care reduces in-hospital mortality and medical complications in elderly patients with hip fracture, but there is not a significant effect on length of hospital stay or long-term functional recovery[7] Historically, this group of patients are cared for in our trust by the orthopaedic team with little or no input from the medical team. There is generally poor prioritisation and coordination of care with little appreciation of the frail nature of these patients.\n\nThe orthopaedic ward and integrated care with geriatrician showed a trend in favour of showing the lowest in-hospital mortality, lowest length of stay, and lowest mean time to surgery.[3] This vision of orthogeriatric care is now being promoted by the Fragility Fracture Network (FFN), globally focusing on the optimal multidisciplinary management of the patients with a fragility fracture.\n\nBackground\n\nA hip fracture is one of the most serious consequences of falls in the elderly, with a mortality of 10% at one month and 30% at one year.[8] There is also significant morbidity associated with hip fractures, with only 50% returning to their previous level of mobility and 10 to 20% of patients being discharged to a residential or nursing care placement.[9] The current UK incidence of hip fractures is between 70,000 to 75,000, and the annual cost of medical and social care for these patients is estimated to be over £2 billion.[9] 75% of those suffering such fractures are female and the average age of sufferers is over 80 years old.[1] Due to an ever-increasing ageing population, it is projected that the incidence will increase to 91,500 by 2015 and to 101,000 by 2020.[2] With hip fracture incidence rapidly rising, it is pivotal that optimal therapy is delivered to ensure the best possible outcomes. Elderly patients with hip fractures have complex medical, surgical, and rehabilitation needs so a well-coordinated multidisciplinary team approach is essential for the best outcome.\n\nThree major initiatives in the UK recently had led to improved care of this group of frail elderly patients:\n\nThe publication of the BOA/BGS jointly sponsored Blue Book, providing guidelines to the care of patients with fragility fractures in 2005\n\nThe National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD): a web based audit tool launched in 2007 which allows trusts to monitor the quality and outcome of care provided to the individual patient\n\nThe best practice tariff for hip fractures: introduced in April 2010, this incentivises individual trusts financially for providing gold-standard care, defined by the following criteria:\n\na. Time to theatre within 36 hours\n\nb. Geriatrician review within 72 hours\n\nc. Admitted under joint care and assessed using a joint protocol agreed by geriatricians, orthopaedic surgeons, and anaesthetists\n\nd. Geriatrician led multiprofessional rehabilitation\n\ne. Falls and bone health assessment.\n\nAs a result, the mortality from hip fracture is improving. The overall 30 day mortality rate nationally for hip fractures is around 8.2% (case mix adjusted analysis).[1] However, there is still a wide variation in 30 day mortality between different trusts.\n\nExcess mortality associated with hip fractures is well documented, with older adults having a five to eight fold increased risk in all-cause mortality during the first three months after a hip fracture.[10] Patients who sustain a hip fracture are more likely to be elderly, institutionalised, and frail, with multiple co-morbidities. The functional reserve for these patients is poor and they are less likely to tolerate physiological stresses associated with a hip fracture and its surgical fixation.[11] Designing a system which caters for frailty, including early geriatric input[12], has been a significant factor in reducing mortality in hip fracture patients.\n\nUp to 20% of patients with hip fractures will develop a postoperative complication, with chest infections (9%) and heart failure (5%) being the most common.[13] Developing heart failure following a hip fracture has a very poor prognosis, with a one year mortality of 92% and a 30 day mortality of 65%. For chest infections, the one year mortality is 71% and 43% within 30 days.[13] Preventing the development of these complications should be a priority in units looking to improve mortality from hip fractures.\n\nThe effect of timing of surgical intervention on mortality remains a controversial topic. Various studies have demonstrated an improvement in mortality following early surgical intervention [14,15] but other studies did not.[16,17,18] However, there is widespread evidence that early operative intervention does improve outcomes, including morbidity (especially infections), pressure sores, pain, and length of stay.[19] This concensus is reflected in the current guidelines on the management of hip fractures; the British Orthopaedic Association guidelines “The Blue Book” recommends that surgery should not be delayed beyond 48 hours unless there are clearly reversible medical conditions.[2] The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) advocates surgery as soon as possible for the medically fit within safe operating hours, after the patient presents to hospital.[20] Currently, one of the requirements for attainment of the best practice tariff is surgery within 36 hours.\n\nDesign\n\nAvoiding delays to theatre\n\nPrior to 2010, hip fracture patients at St Peter’s Hospital were cared for exclusively by the orthopaedic team with input from the medical team, often only in the context of managing a deteriorating patient. In 2010, two geriatricians were integrated into the multidisciplinary team.\n\nAt the outset, the new department set out the ambitious aim of being one of the best orthogeriatric units in the country by focusing on achieving the six core care standards outlined in the Blue Book for each individual patient. Providing gold standard care routinely should reduce perioperative complications, and hence mortality. We use 30 day mortality as an overall “barometer” of care that we provide to our patients, along with measuring other key performance indicators such as time to surgery, falls, bone health assessment, and attainment of the best practice tariff.\n\nThe project required a redesign of the whole system pathway and in September of 2010, we organised a LEAN improvement programme (EQuIP – efficiency, quality, innovation, and productivity programme). The aim of the event was to understand the current pathway for patients with hip fractures and to target key areas for improvement. The project team, which included all stakeholders involved in hip fracture care, was tasked with mapping out the current pathway of a typical patient. This allowed us to analyse the waste issues throughout the pathway in greater detail. The major issues identified included:\n\nPoor prioritisation of hip fracture patients\n\nLack of theatre time over the weekend\n\nPoor access to senior medical input for preoperative optimisation\n\nPoor access to physiotherapy over the weekend\n\nDifficulty getting the patients to the ward and availability of pressure relieving equipment.\n\nThe team developed a range of solutions to be implemented across the entire pathway:\n\nThe Saturday theatre list was split to two half-day lists over the weekend to improve access to theatre.\n\nHistorically, these frail patients were given poor priority, often being operated on at the end of the day. This is partly cultural, whereby hip fracture patients are seen as high risk patients with a poor prognosis and therefore not seen as “attractive” surgical candidates. The frail nature of these patients meant that any delay to theatre is likely to result in a negative outcome. In order to achieve timely surgical intervention, a cultural shift was required to prioritise these patients before more robust children and younger adults. Our EQuiP programme allowed us to agree a \"priority theatre pyramid\" to ensure that patients with hip fractures are prioritised accordingly. These patients are now prioritised ahead of acute paediatrics and only second to life or limb trauma.\n\nA new hip fracture clerking proforma which included falls and bone health assessments. The majority of clinical delays to theatre resulted from inadequate optimisation of the patient. It is essential that the process of optimisation of the patients occurs as soon as they are admitted. The admitting doctor is usually a junior doctor with limited medical experience. We therefore introduced an A-Z guide to management of common preoperative issues to help junior doctors optimise patients at presentation to prevent delays to theatre. Five day routine access to consultant geriatrician input ensured continuing medical education for the junior doctors and appropriate senior back up for more complex issues:\n\nThe use of a fast bleep to reduce delays to ward\n\nExtra pressure mattress to be kept on the ward\n\nSeven day provision of physiotherapy\n\nSurgery done/supervised by experienced surgeon.\n\nPreventing post operative complications\n\nTo sustain improvement, a monthly multidisciplinary governance meeting was set up. The aims of the meeting include:\n\nCharting progress using a performance dashboard\n\nIdentify key areas for improvement\n\nRoot cause analysis of delays to theatre\n\nMorbidity and mortality review.\n\nIn 2011 to 2012, there was a slight increase in our mortality rates. Our mortality reviews confirmed that chest infections and cardiac failure were the main causes of mortality. Further audits revealed that mortality was associated with a raised preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) [21] and a low haemoglobin.[22]\n\nIt has been postulated that the high incidence of chest infections in hip fracture patients is a result of the patient being in pain (reducing their ability to cough) and being immobile.[8] Early surgical fixation and better pain management with routine involvement of the acute pain team should reduce pain and allow early mobilisation. Greater emphasis was placed on provision of seven day physiotherapy and nursing patients at 30 degrees to prevent aspiration of gastric contents. Some patients may already have subclinical infections prior to their fracture [23]; antibiotics are given to patients with a high preoperative CRP and lowering the threshold for initiating antibiotics in the post operative period.\n\nUp to a quarter of patients with hip fractures have pre-existing cardiovascular disease.[13] The physiological stress associated with a hip fracture can induce myocardial ischaemia and precipitate cardiac failure. Moreover, delays to surgery can result in the vulnerable patient receiving unnecessary intravenous fluids, increasing the risk of cardiac decompensation. Pre or post operative anaemia can also increase cardiac workload. Early intervention with surgery will result in better pain management and lower the physiological stress. Cessation of intravenous fluids within 24 hours post operatively is now routine, unless clinically indicated. We introduced a point of care haemoglobin estimation system (Hemocue) to identify patients with anaemia intraoperatively to reduce delays to transfusion. Patients returning from theatre will now have their haemoglobin checked on arrival back to the ward, especially in patients with extracapsular fractures, which often results in greater blood loss. We are also advocating the use of early ionotropes in a high dependency setting (HDU) for these susceptible patients so we can limit the amount of fluid given to them.\n\nWeekend effect\n\nThe so called “weekend effect” for surgical patients has now been well publicised and debated in the public forum. We set out to investigate whether this effect applied to our patients. We audited over 1000 patients from April 2009 to September 2011 to compare mortality in our unit between weekday and weekends. There was no significant difference between our weekday and weekend mortality, although it was surprising that patients admitted on a Wednesday had the highest mortality at 9.2%. Patients admitted on a Wednesday to our trust are normally operated on a Thursday. The patients are not routinely reviewed by the junior doctors post operatively due to teaching. These patients may decompensate over the weekend since they are not seen by the physiotherapists or doctors; historically we prioritise those patients who are day one post-op for review over the weekend.\n\nWe implemented a quality improvement programme from 2012 to 2013 with the following interventions [24]:\n\nPhysiotherapist to review our day two post-op (patient admitted on Wednesday) patients at weekends\n\nNurses to sit up these patients at weekends\n\nEmail trail highlighting these patients\n\nJunior doctors to return to ward from teaching to review same day post-op, and we also implemented a change in our proforma to allow same day post op review for all our patients\n\nPoster chart to remind the juniors"
