        "meta_description": "Introduction Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) inform healthcare decisions. It is now apparent that some published RCTs contain false data and some appear to have been entirely fabricated. Systematic reviews are performed to identify and synthesise all RCTs that have been conducted on a given topic. While it is usual to assess methodological features of the RCTs in the process of undertaking a systematic review, it is not usual to consider whether the RCTs contain false data. Studies containing false data therefore go unnoticed and contribute to systematic review conclusions. The INveStigating ProblEmatic Clinical Trials in Systematic Reviews (INSPECT-SR) project will develop a tool to assess the trustworthiness of RCTs in systematic reviews of healthcare-related interventions.\n\nMethods and analysis The INSPECT-SR tool will be developed using expert consensus in combination with empirical evidence, over five stages: (1) a survey of experts to assemble a comprehensive list of checks for detecting problematic RCTs, (2) an evaluation of the feasibility and impact of applying the checks to systematic reviews, (3) a Delphi survey to determine which of the checks are supported by expert consensus, culminating in, (4) a consensus meeting to select checks to be included in a draft tool and to determine its format and (5) prospective testing of the draft tool in the production of new health systematic reviews, to allow refinement based on user feedback. We anticipate that the INSPECT-SR tool will help researchers to identify problematic studies and will help patients by protecting them from the influence of false data on their healthcare.\n\nEthics and dissemination The University of Manchester ethics decision tool was used, and this returned the result that ethical approval was not required for this project (30 September 2022), which incorporates secondary research and surveys of professionals about subjects relating to their expertise. Informed consent will be obtained from all survey participants. All results will be published as open-access articles. The final tool will be made freely available.",

        "text": "Overall design\n\nThe stage 1 survey of experts has been completed at the time of writing, and a short protocol for the survey has been posted online (https://osf.io/6pmx5/). We describe the methods briefly here. The aim of stage 1 was to create an extensive list of checks for identifying problematic research studies, which could be taken forward for evaluation in stages 2 and 3. In stage 1, we did not restrict our focus to checks applicable to or designed for RCTs specifically. Instead, we sought to identify checks applicable to any research design, so that these could be subsequently evaluated for their applicability to RCTs.\n\nWe assembled an initial list of 102 checks that could be used to assess potentially problematic studies. The initial list included checks identified in a recent scoping review,16 a recent qualitative study of experts17 and additional methods known to the research team (eg, JW undertakes integrity investigations for scientific journals and publishers and added checks known to him as a result of this work). The list was grouped into several preliminary domains, as shown in table 1 (adapted from https://osf.io/6pmx5/).\n\nWe incorporated the list in an online survey in Qualtrics (available at https://osf.io/6pmx5/) to identify checks which had not already been included on the list and to allow respondents to comment on the checks which were on the list.\n\nThe survey asked participants about their experience in assessing potentially problematic studies and to state the country in which they primarily work, before presenting them with the initial list of 102 checks. Each item was presented alongside a free-text box, and participants were advised to comment on any aspect if they wished to do so. At the end of the list, participants were asked whether they were aware of any other checks that had not featured on the list and were presented with a free-text box to describe these.\n\nAnalysis and next steps\n\nDescriptive analysis of the survey participants (country of work, experience with assessing potentially problematic studies) and responses will be performed. Additional items suggested by respondents, and comments made on existing items, will be summarised. Based on the survey responses, further items will be added to the list, and the wording of existing items will be amended, subject to review by the steering group and expert advisory panel members. The updated list will be taken forward to stages 2 and 3.\n\nChecks categorised in domain 5 (inspecting individual participant data, see table 1) may only be performed when the underlying dataset for an RCT can be obtained. An extension to the INSPECT-SR tool containing domain 5 checks is in development (working name INSPECT-IPD). The development of INSPECT-IPD requires a different approach to the main INSPECT-SR tool (application of checks to a large sample of individual participant datasets and a distinct Delphi panel). The remainder of this protocol describes the development of the INSPECT-SR tool, which will include checks in domains 1–4 only.\n\nReview selection\n\nWe will use a sample of 50 Cochrane Reviews. This sample size has been selected on a pragmatic basis, to allow a sufficient number of applications of the checks to evaluate feasibility and to characterise the impact on results, while remaining achievable. Stage 2 will be undertaken as a large collaborative enterprise, with steering group members, expert advisory panel members and additional collaborators who have expressed an interest in participating, each applying the full list of checks to the RCTs in a small number of Cochrane Reviews.\n\nWe will endeavour to match assessors to topic areas with which they have familiarity, as this reflects how the final INSPECT-SR tool would be used. We will ask each assessor to state a broad topic area relating to their expertise. We will then identify the most recent Cochrane Review relating to this topic and meeting the eligibility requirements. Where an assessor does not have a particular topic of interest, we will select a topic in order to achieve broad coverage of subjects, and we will identify the most recently published Cochrane Review meeting the eligibility requirements. To be eligible, a review cannot be authored or coauthored by the assessor, out of concern that this could introduce an incentive to overlook problematic features of included studies. Similarly, the review should not contain RCTs authored or coauthored by the assessor. The review must also contain at least one meta-analysis containing between one and five RCTs as a feasibility constraint. We also require that the review has not already undergone an assessment to identify potentially problematic studies, as this may have resulted in the removal of problematic trials from the meta-analyses. We acknowledge, however, that this final criterion may frequently be unclear.\n\nData capture\n\nA bespoke data capture form has been produced. Assessors will extract data for each RCT contained in the first meta-analysis in the Cochrane Review which includes between one and five RCTs. Assessors will initially record their level of familiarity with the topic of the review (little or no familiarity, some familiarity, high familiarity) and basic information about each RCT, including a study ID based on the names of the first authors of the review and of the trial, years of publication of both and the year of publication of the RCT. Assessors will then extract data for that RCT from the meta-analysis, including sample size per treatment arm and outcome data per treatment arm (eg, mean and SD for each treatment arm for continuous outcomes and frequency of events for binary outcomes). The risk-of-bias assessments for that RCT from the review will be extracted for each domain, as will the corresponding GRADE assessment for the meta-analysis (if there is one).\n\nAssessors will then attempt to apply items from the list of checks from stage 1 to the RCT. Assessors will be given the opportunity to apply each check, with the exception of checks which require authors of the RCT to be contacted. For each check, assessors will select a response from the options ‘not feasible’, ‘passed’, ‘possibly fail’ or ‘fail’. A free-text box will be available for each check so that the assessor may record the reason for their assessment. Finally, having worked through the list of checks, the assessor will record whether they have concerns about the authenticity of the RCT (with options ‘no’, ‘some concerns’, ‘serious concerns’ or ‘don’t know’), whether they performed any additional checks not included in the list (and if so, what these checks were and what the outcomes were), as well as being given the opportunity to make any additional comments and to estimate how long it took to perform the assessment.\n\nTo assist with applying the checks, each assessor will be provided with a guidance document briefly explaining the rationale for each check and instructions on how to apply them. An Excel workbook will be supplied, which can be used to perform some of the statistical checks.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nWe will calculate the frequency of each response option for each check (how often each was considered infeasible, how often each one was failed, possibly failed or passed). We will summarise the overall RCT-level assessments of the assessors after applying the checks (whether or not they had concerns about authenticity). We will evaluate the impact of removing trials flagged by each item, by comparing the data included in the primary meta-analysis before and after the application of the method (eg, numbers of trials, numbers of events, sample size) as well as the results (changes in pooled estimate, CI width, heterogeneity). We will visualise the clustering of checks, by plotting trial-level assessments for each check in an array. We will consider the relationship between the assessments and the risk of bias (for each domain) in the reviews to understand the relationship between indicators of problems on one hand and assessments of evidence quality on the other. This will be undertaken using multinomial regression to assess the association between assessment and risk-of-bias ratings for each risk-of-bias domain. GRADE assessments refer to collections of trials rather than individual trials, and so we will use ordinal regression to assess the association between the number of trials in the meta-analysis flagged and the GRADE rating.\n\nParticipants and recruitment\n\nDelphi participants will be identified through professional networks of the steering group and expert advisory panel. We will also invite eligible individuals identified and involved in previous stages of the project. We will recruit individuals representing key stakeholder groups, including individuals with experience or expertise in assessing problematic studies, journal editors, research integrity specialists, systematic reviewers, clinical trialists and methodologists. We will categorise participants into two larger groups: (1) individuals with expertise or experience in assessing potentially problematic studies and (2) potential users of a tool for assessing potentially problematic studies, noting that participants may be included in both categories. Individuals will be invited via personalised email describing the Delphi survey in the context of the wider INSPECT-SR development project. We will monitor recruitment across stakeholder groups and geographical location and will attempt to improve recruitment for groups in which recruitment numbers are low by targeting potential participants in these groups. We consider at least 30 expert participants in each of the two participant groups (experts and potential users) to represent the minimum for a credible Delphi. However, ideally, we will aim for a minimum of 100 participants overall.\n\nRound 1\n\nWe will send participants a personalised email outlining the project, together with a link to the survey, which will be implemented online using suitable software. The survey will include the list of checks. In round 1, respondents will be asked for basic demographic information, to allow categorisation based on domain(s) of expertise. Respondents will be asked to score each check 1 (lowest score) to 9 (highest score) in two dimensions: usefulness and feasibility. Usefulness will relate to the potential effectiveness of the check for detecting a problematic study. Feasibility will relate to the perceived ease of implementation of each check. Participants will also be given the option to indicate that they do not know whether a check is useful or feasible (because, eg, they are unfamiliar with the approach or lack the expertise to comment on a particular check). A free-text box will be provided with each check, so that participants may leave any general comments (such as, an explanation for their assessment or suggestions to modify the wording). Round 1 participants will be invited to suggest additional checks.\n\nRound 2\n\nIn round 2, we will add any suggested additional checks to the list (subject to review by the steering group and expert advisory panel), and for each item, respondents will be presented with both their own scores (1–9) and the distribution of scores from the previous round. Participants who were invited to participate in round 1 but who did not respond will be invited to the round 2 survey and will be presented with the distribution of scores from the previous round only. Participants will be asked to provide a new score in light of this information. The round 2 survey will include a free-text box for each check so that participants may elaborate on their responses.\n\nOverall design\n\nIn collaboration with systematic reviewers, we will prospectively evaluate the draft tool by using it in the production of a cohort of new systematic reviews and systematic review updates. The impact of the draft tool’s impact on review conclusions will be assessed in the same way as in stage 2. We will assess feasibility and usability by implementing surveys regarding experiences of use. Separate surveys will be designed for review authors and, for Cochrane Reviews, editors. These will explore ease of implementation, barriers to use and suggestions for improvement. In addition to user-level data, we will capture data relating to the individual reviews in which the tool was implemented, as each one represents a potentially informative case study. We will undertake additional qualitative interviews with users during this testing phase to capture additional feedback.\n\nWe will aim to include a variety of topic areas in this testing phase. Stage 5 will culminate in a user workshop, including review editors and review authors involved in testing the tool.\n\nUser workshop\n\nFindings from the surveys will be fed back to participants as part of a user workshop. The workshop might be virtual, in-person or a combination of both. Participants will share their experiences of using the tool and make recommendations for refinement. The discursive format of the meeting is intended to reveal additional information about the experience of users that could not be easily captured via the surveys. We will invite both authors and editors involved in the testing phase to participate. The findings of the testing phase will be used to make final modifications to the tool for usability. We will use the results to produce guidance relating to use of the tool in practice. Alongside stage 5, as we gather user data, we will produce training materials (to be delivered as workshops and as an online training module) to familiarise systematic review authors and editors with the tool. These will be finalised in light of the findings from the user workshop."
