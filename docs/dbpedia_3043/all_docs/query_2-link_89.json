        "text": "On this Memorial Day, I could not think of a more appropriate post than to list the names of Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, soldiers who gave their lives during the American Civil War. It is quite a lenghty post, with well over six hundred names, but it is instructive. Too often when discussing the Civil War, we simply state casualty numbers without seriously thinking about just how many lives were lost and how many were shattered. The names below, which are listed alphabetically, were those of men from just one small county in east-central Pennsylvania. And do keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive list. We all know how spotty Civil War records can be, and this list does not include the names of those men, scores perhaps hundreds, whose lives were cut far too short by war-related sickness and injury and passed away after the guns fell silent. Because this blog focuses on the 48th Pennsylvania, I have bolded their names in the list below.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\n· Abraham Acker: Co. C 48th Pennsylvania; Killed in Action at Petersburg, June 23, 1864\n\n· John A. Ailer: Co. E 96th Pennsylvania; Died of Wounds Received in Action, May 22, 1864\n\n· William Ainsworth: Co. M 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry; Killed in Action May 1864, Marietta, Georgia\n\n· George Airgood: Co.

I regret to say that I don't know that much about him. He was a first generation American, was a good baseball player and dancer, and served in World War II. Like many in Schuylkill County, he found work in the coal mines. On May 27, 1957, he headed off to work as he would have any other day but shortly after entering the mines that morning, an explosion collapsed the walls and my grandfather, with a few others, was trapped. He was only 29 years old. With my 29th birthday coming up in September, it's hard to believe that my grandfather was so young when he died. He left behind a widow, my grandmother Baba, and five children, including my mom, who was six years old when her dad was killed. Of course, I never did get a chance to meet him but still I have missed him. I suppose we would be planning his 80th Birthday Party this year if he were still around.\n\nCoal Miner's Statue, Minersville, Pennsylvania\n\nJames Kellerson Helms, the son of Peter & Lucy Helms, was born on June 11, 1841, in Myerstown, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. The family moved to Philadelphia, where James was educated at the public schools. Then, in 1857, the family settled in Schuylkill Haven, in southern Schuylkill County. Here James found work as a teacher. He was two months shy of his twentieth birthday when the American Civil War began in April 1861. Like many of the young men from Schuylkill Haven, Helms volunteered his services, and shortly after the commencement of hostilities, he was mustered in as a private in the 6th Pennsylvania Volunteers. The 6th PA was a three-month unit that spent its time in the Shenandoah Valley, under the command of General Robert Patterson. After Helms's three-month enlistment expired in late July, he signed up to serve in Company D, 48th Pennsylvania. Mustered in as a sergeant, Helms proved to be a very good soldier. He stood 5'7\" in height, had a fair complexion, dark eyes, and light hair. Helms fought bravely at 2nd Bull, South Mountain, and Antietam in the late summer of 1862. During the latter battle, Helms was informed that his younger brother, Jeremiah Helms, the drummer for Company C, 50th PA, had fallen seriously wounded. James made his way to the Sherrick House where his brother was being cared for. There was nothing to be done, however, and young Jeremiah passed away on September 24, 1862, at the age of 16, one of the youngest casualties at Antietam. Jeremiah enlisted against his parents' wishes, and despite being mustered in as the company drummer, he was known to set his drum down, pick up a musket, and march along with the advanced ranks. James's father, Peter Helms, traveled to the Antietam battlefield to retrieve the body of his son, Jeremiah.\n\nPeter Helms\n\nFather of Capt. James K. Helms, 48th PA & Pvt. Jeremiah Helms, 50th PA\n\nThe Miners' Journal, Schuylkill County's leading newspaper, recounted the sad events in its October 12, 1862, issue:\n\nOn last Tuesday a week, Jeremiah Helms, the youngest son of Mr. Peter Helms of Schuylkill Haven, and a member of Company C, 50th regiment, P.V. was interred at Myerstown, Lebanon County, his former residence, in the presence of a large concourse of mourners and friends. . . .His father brought the Corpse home from the late battlefield of Antietam, where he was mortally wounded on the 17th ult. while nobly battling with the enemy in defense of those dear rights which every freeman should enjoy. He was shot through the head with a Minie ball in line of the eyes. He was perfectly sensible for the first seven days of his suffering, and able to walk about. Thus he lingered, with out a murmur, bearing his pain like a true soldier, with Christian fortitude, until the morning of the 27th, only the day previous to his father's arrival, when he breathed his last and became another victim of this cursed Rebellion and sacrifices at the star of his country's choicest blessing, liberty & freedom. He fell a noble hero martyr to the cause he so much loved to defend. His comrades bear testimony of his soldierly conduct, always cheerful and prompt in performance of his duty. He fought well at the battles of Pocataligo, S.C., Bull Run, Chantilly, Va., and South Mountain and Antietam, Md. He prevailed for some time upon his parents to go to war: they could not at first consent to his going on account of his youth, but seeing that he was fired a zeal of patriotism that was pure and noble, permission was given. . . .He is the youngest of three brothers, all of whom have enlisted in defense of the Union, at the respective ages of 16, 18, and 20 years. After the battle of Bull Run he was heard in earnest prayer, upon bended knees in his tent. In his last letter, which was after the battle of South Mountain, he wrote his parents not to feel uneasy about him, that he was fighting for the Lord, as well as for the protection of the Star and Stripes. . . .His brother James, who is a member of the 48th P.V. visited him during his suffering, when he told him that [James] should return to his regiment and do valiant service, that he was beyond recovery. He also told his nurse the same, Morgan Pugh of Minersville, and that by his kind and unceasing attentions towards him he (Pugh) only prolonged his suffering, as he could not recover. He seems to have been resigned to his fate, and satisfied to die as a proud defender of his insulted country.\n\nAfter the death of his brother, James did indeed return to his regiment. He fought at Fredericksburg, and throughout the 1863 campaigns in Kentucky and Tennessee. Throughout his time in the 48th, Helms advanced through the ranks, being promoted to 2nd lieutenant, and the to 1st lieutenant. Surviving the slaughter at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, James Helms was seriously wounded in the leg in June 1864 at Petersburg. He was sent home to recover. It would prove to be a long convalescence and the wound would never completely heal. He was discharged on a surgeon's certificate on October 19, 1864. On July 22, 1864, during his recovery, Helms was promoted to the rank Captain, in recognition of his gallantry and good service.\n\nJames Helms spent the remaining years of his life in Schuylkill Haven. He married Amanda Kantner and soon began a family. A photograph of three of Helms's children follows:\n\nHe was elected as a Justice of the Peace, and held this position until his death. He served on the borough council and was a member of the local school board. Helms also remained active in veteran's affairs, and on February 8, 1867, founded the Jere K. Helms Post 26 of the Grand Army of the Republic, in honor of his younger brother, who was mortally wounded five years earlier at Antietam. He also served as the National and State President of the Patriotic Orders Sons of America.\n\nJames K. Helms died on July 23, 1893, at just fifty-two years of age. He was buried in Schuylkill Haven's Union Cemetery.\n\nSeveral years ago, The Patriotic Order, Sons of America, published Captain James Helms's Civil War Diaries. Copies can be obtained by contacting the P.O.S. of America, Research & Service Center, Valley Forge, PA 19481.\n\n{The Miners' Journal article on the death and burial ofJeremiah Helms is found in Stu Richards's great book on Company C, 50th Pennsylvania Infantry}\n\nThe 48th Pennsylvania Record Banner\n\nOne year after the end of the American Civil War, on Independence Day, 1866, the battle flags of Pennsylvania's regiments were returned to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in an elaborate ceremony that concluded with a memorable parade of the regiments' survivors through the streets of Philadelphia.\n\nSince this day 141 years ago, the flags of Pennsylvania's Civil War regiments have been stored in a state arsenal building, then displayed in a specially-built flag room in the capitol. After this they were transferred to the state's Executive Library and Museum, and then--finally--back to the capitol rotunda. It used to be that you had to travel to Harrisburg, or make a special appointment to view these flags, but not anymore. . .now, it's as simple as a few clicks\n\nGreat measures have been taken of late to preserve what remains of these battle flags. You can read all about these steps, and search for the flags of any Pennsylvania regiment by using this website:\n\nThe Flags of the 48th Pennsylvania. . .as they appear in 2007. . .are photographed below. Please note that these photographs are copyrighted, PA CPC (Capital Preservation Committee)\n\nThis is all that remains of the regiment's 1861 \"Pottsville\" Flag. . .presented to the 48th in October 1861 by Mr. John T. Werner. It was upon the canton of this flag that was inscribed: \"In the Cause of the Union, We Know No Such Word As Fail.\"\n\nThe 48th's first State Flag, presented to the regiment by Gov.

Upon his discharge in late July 1861, Krebs re-enlisted to serve a three-year, 'or the war,' term as a corporal in Company G, 48th Pennsylvania. His twenty years' of age was betrayed a little by his \"grey\" complexion, grey eyes, and dark hair, and at 6'1\" in height, he was among the tallest soldiers in the entire regiment. The one-time farmer proved to be a good soldier, and an efficient officer. In September 1862, he was made the regiment's Quartermaster Sergeant, a position he held until September 1864 when he was discharged from the 48th Pennsylvania to accept a first lieutenant's commission in the 35th Regiment of United States Colored Troops (U.S.C.T.). Joining his command near Jacksonville, Florida, Krebs saw action at the battle of Honey Hill, South Carolina, where he received a severe wound. Following his recovery, Krebs next became an Aide-de-Camp to Brevet Major General Charles Devens, commanding the District of Charleston, South Carolina. He remained in the army until his discharge on June 1, 1866. He then headed west, settling in San Francisco, California. An Annual Survivor's Roster of the 48th Pennsylavania published in 1901 still listed Krebs's residence in the Golden Gate City, but I have yet been unable to determine the date of his death.\n\nA many, many years' long mystery was solved this past week.\n\nIt all began simply enough. About a decade ago, I was searching the 1850 Census Records in an effort to learn more about the family of James Nagle. I found his household: James Nagle, Age 28, Painter; his wife Elizabeth, and their three children, Emma, George, and James W. Then, at the bottom of the list was Emerguildo Marquis: Age 11, Born in Mexico. My curiosity was picqued. Who was this kid? My immediate thought was this: since James served in the Mexican-American War, he \"adopted\" this child, and brought him back to Pottsville where he and his family raised him. But I wanted to find out for sure. Never did I think that this quest would span ten years!\n\nI searched through all the records, but found little. I discovered that Emerguildo signed up to serve in the 6th Pennsylvania, a three-month regiment organized in April 1861, and commanded by Colonel James Nagle. I then contacted the National Archives and requested his service records. Weeks later, a copy of Emerguildo's file arrived at my door. It confirmed the fact that he did, indeed, serve in the 6th Pennsylvania, and it also disclosed that he reenlisted as a bugler in the 3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry, to serve a three-year enlistment. Also contained in the file was a letter written by James Nagle, now a Brigadier General, dated December 22, 1862. \"I have the honor to make application to have Emerguildo Marquis, Bugler in Captain White's Company 3rd PA Cavalry, detailed as bugler and orderly, for these Hd. Qrs.,\" the letter began. \"He is a Mexican Boy that I brought along from Mexico. He was with me in the three months service, after that he enlisted in the Cavalry, and he is now desirous of joining me in some capacity, and I only have three mounted orderlies, and need a bugler at Head Quarters to sound the General Calls.\" Nagle's request was granted and Emerguildo became a member of General Nagle's staff. I was struck by the fact that Emerguildo was a bugler. The Nagle family was very musically-inclined, with James's brothers Levi and Abraham serving as musicians in the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry. From here, however, the trail once again went cold.\n\nSome time later I read through the cemetery records of the Pottsville Presbyterian Cemetery, the one for which I am currently developing a walking tour. I immediately headed up there to search for the grave. Perhaps it included a date a death, then I could look up his obituary in the Miners' Journal, but, alas, I couldn't find it. I talked to many people, and they told me he was, indeed, buried in the cemetery, but where? Once again the trail went cold.\n\nLast summer, I thought I would at long last solve the mystery when I happened upon Nagle's diary from the Mexican-American War, held at Brown University and available online. I searched through all 174 pages, but once again found nothing. I couldn't believe it. Perhaps my original assumption was wrong.\n\nBy the start of 2007, I still hadn't solved the mystery that was Emerguildo Marquis. Then it all came together. This past week, a descendant of General Nagle visited the Antietam Battlefield. He and I had been in contact for years, but this was the first time we met. He brought along a number of old documents, letters, diaries, et cetera, related to James Nagle and I was simply blown away. In his collection was Emerguildo's discharge certificate. He was discharged on August 24, 1864, with his three-year term of enlistment coming to an end. The document also stated that Emerguildo was born in Mexico, was twenty-six years of age, stood 5'1\" in height, had a dark complexion, black eyes, and black hair. His occupation: painter. Painter, just like General James Nagle.\n\nIn addition to this was a short description of James Nagle's service in Mexico, written by his daughter Kate. \"It was a long sad time for folks at home,\" wrote Kate, \"but great rejoicing when word came that the war was over and the Army was waiting for orders to move; and greater was the joy when a telegram came saying Come to Philadelphia with the children to meet us.\" \"A number of the wives of the Soldiers went to Philadelphia to meet their husbands. When they met them, they saw three persons who were not Soldiers, but little Mexican boys about 9 or 10 years of age. They were very small, dark skin, no shoes. . . .They learned to love the Soldiers, and when they broke Camp the little boys followed them (stole their way, so to speak). When they were discovered the Army was miles out of the City of Mexico. They would not go back. They were little orphans, and the Officers took charge of them and landed them at home in Pottsville. Captain [James] Nagle, Lieut. Simon Nagle, and Lieut. Frank B. Kaercher, each took a little Mexican boy to their homes. The one Captain Nagle cared for was, by name, Emerigildo Marquis, known as 'Marium.' He was treated as one of the family. He was sent to school, sent to learn a trade, Jeweler. He was away from home to work, but never forgot the family; he came home very often over the week ends. He lived to be about 45, grew up with the family. He loved Father & Mother Nagle, and the Children all loved him. He died at the Nagle home, about the year 1877.\"\n\nI could not believe what I was reading. . .Finally, after all these years, the mystery of Emerguildo Marquis was finally solved. And what a great story he was. I am still smiling from this discovery, but even more so after another discovery yesterday.\n\nYesterday was my 'Saturday,' so I took to trip to Schuylkill County to visit with my family and to get some more photographs of the Presbyterian Cemetery for my walking tour. I came across the grave site of Daniel & Mary Nagle, James's parents, plus his two sisters, Eleanor and Elizabeth. Two of these four stones were knocked over, and a third was severely leaning. (See photo below). I went home, waited for my dad to come home from work, and my sister from Lehigh University, and then, with my mom as well, we grabbed some pry bars and shovels and headed up to the cemetery to do some repair and restoration. We reset the stone that was leaning, lifted up and reset the two that had fallen down.\n\nAt the foot of one of Nagle's sister's grave was a stone that was sunken deep into the ground. My sister started to remove the dirt and grass that was covering the stone, and soon it struck us all. There, underneath years of dirt and grass was: \"Emerguildo Marquis.\"\n\nIn one week, in a just a few days, rather, his mystery was solved AND I finally found his grave site. It's funny how some things work out this way.\n\nEmerguildo, who died in 1880, was buried along with the rest of the Nagle family, another testimonial to the fact that he was, indeed, considered a part of the family. The pictures below show me and my family restoring the graves of the Nagle family in the Presbyterian Cemetery.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nThe \"Before\" Picture. . .\n\nThis is what the Nagle family grave site looked like prior to our restoration.\n\n(See the one at bottom right, buried in the ground?)\n\nThe Stone of Emerguildo Marquis\n\n(Buried deep into the ground)\n\nMystery Solved\n\nResetting the Stone\n\nA Good Days' Work\n\nThe \"After\" Picture\n\nThe Nagle Family's Grave Site Restored\n\n(The tall stone in the background is the final resting place of General James Nagle)"
