        "text": "Battle of Sharpsburg (Antietam)\n\nThe regiment was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel David Zable.\n\nTwo War Department markers on the Antieram battlefield report the brigade’s actions:\n\n(September 16-17, 1862.)\n\nHays’ Brigade encamped on the night of the 16th in the woods northwest of the Dunkard Church. Soon after daylight on the 17th, it advanced and, near this point, crossed the Hagerstown Pike to fill an interval between the Brigades of Lawton and Trimble. Afer a short halt in the open fields south of the Cornfield, it was ordered to the support of Lawton’s Brigade. It advanced into the Cornfield about 150 yards beyond Lawton, where, having lost more than half its numbers, it was relieved by Wofford’s Brigade of Hood’s Division and withdrawn to the fields southwest of the Dunkard Church.\n\n(September 17, 1862.)\n\nOn the night of September 16, Hays’ Brigade bivouacked in the woods northwest of the Dunkard Church. Soon after daylight on the 17th, with about 550 men, it moved through the woods, crossed the Hagerstown Pike 120 yards north of the Church and advanced eastward to fill a gap between the Brigades of Lawton and Trimble, but was halted and, after a short wait in the open field northeast of the Church was ordered to the support of Lawton’s Brigade, then fiercely engaged about 150 yards south of this point. It advanced beyond Lawton’s line, penetrated the Cornfield, and came under an enfilading fire from several Union Batteries, and from Infantry in front and on the left, west of the Pike, by which its force was reduced by more than half. It was obliged to fall back out of the Cornfield to the high ground about 70 yards south of this, where it was relieved by Wofford’s Brigade, of Hood’s Division and thence withdrawn to the fields southwest of the Dunkard Church. Of the 550 engaged, 323 were killed or wounded.\n\nBattle of Gettysburg\n\nThe regiment was commanded by Lt. Colonel David Zable and brought 281 men to the field. It lost 15 men killed, 50 wounded and an unknown number of missing or captured in attacks on Culp’s Hill.\n\nFrom the War Department marker for Nicholl’s Brigade at Gettysburg on Culp’s Hill:\n\nJuly 1. Arrived near nightfall and took position east of Rock Creek north of Hanover road and on the right of the Division.\n\nJuly 2. About 6 P. M. changing to left of Jones’s Brigade crossed the creek attacked Union forces on Culp’s Hill drove in their outposts and reached and held a line about 100 yards from their breastworks against which a steady fire was maintained for hours and some vigorous but unsuccessful assaults made.\n\nJuly 3. At dawn the Brigade reopened fire and continued it for many hours then retired to line near the creek whence about midnight it moved with Division and Corps to Seminary Ridge.\n\nJuly 4. Occupied Seminary Ridge. About 10 P. M. began the march to Hagerstown."
