        "text": "Cedar Creek • Tour the Battlefield • Battle Maps • Battle Facts • The Armies\n\nBoth armies at Cedar Creek had been through a long and very hard year of campaigning. For many the fighting had started at the beginning of May with the Battle of the Wilderness and had continued without pause through the bloodbaths of Spotsylvania Court House and Cold Harbor.\n\nThe Confederate Army of the Valley\n\nThe heart of Jubal Early’s Army of The Valley were the solid veterans of his Second Corps from the Army of Northern Virginia. Most of these men from Gordon’s, Pegram’s and Ramseur’s Divisions had fought under ‘Stonewall’ Jackson at Second Manassas, Sharpsburg and Chancellorsville. Many called the Valley their home. But their numbers were sadly reduced from the ranks that Jackson had commanded in 1862.\n\nThe Second Corps in particular had suffered in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House in May. Several brigades, including the legendary Stonewall Brigade, had been shattered into fragments with their survivors grouped together into consolidated brigades.\n\nThe Second Corps joined with former Vice President John Breckenridge’s tiny Army of the Valley. Breckenridge’s men had beaten Union General David Hunter’s army at the Battle of New Market in the spring and had briefly joined Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia at Cold Harbor. Now under the command of Gabriel Wharton after Breckenridge was called away to command in western Virginia, they were a very small division with less experience than their comrades from Lee’s main army.\n\nThey were joined at Cedar Creek by the veterans of Kershaw’s Division of the First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia. Lee was desperately short of infantry facing Grant in the trenches of Richmond and Petersburg, but he believed enough in the potential of what Jubal Early was accomplishing in the Shenandoah Valley to send one of his best remaining infantry divisions.\n\nKershaw’s men had joined the Army of the Valley in September but had begun to return to Lee at Richmond when it seemed that they would not be needed in the Valley. They had turned around and rejoined Early after his serious defeats in the Third Battle of Winchester and Fisher’s Hill. Both of these battles ended with Early’s army – even Jackson’s veterans – in headlong flight from Union victors. The return of Kershaw’s veterans helped replace some of the losses and restore morale to Early’s shaken men.\n\nEarly also had two divisions of cavalry. Fitzhugh Lee’s Cavalry Division had joined from Lee’s army in August, and were now under Thomas Rosser since Lee had been wounded at Third Winchester. Lunsford Lomax commaded the second of the cavalry divisions, who had mostly served in western Virginia throughout the war.\n\nLomax’s troopers had an uneven reputation, and Early had a low opinion of all of his cavalry. This only got worse after the Battle of Tom’s Brook on October 9, when Union cavalry routed Early’s troopers. It came to be known as the “Woodstock Races” for the speed of the Confederate retreat. The truth was that Early never used his cavalry properly. Cedar Creek would be no different; Early sent Lomax’s Division off on a mission of doubtful value when their presence on the battlefield might have been vital in keeping the Confederate drive moving.\n\nOrganization of the Confederate Army of the Valley\n\nCommanded by Lieutenant General Jubal A.

Shoemaker Thomson’s Virginia Battery\n\nThe Federal Army of the Shenandoah\n\nThe Army of the Shenandoah under Philip Sheridan was also a mixture of commands brought in from an even more widespread area.\n\nThe heart of the army was the Sixth Corps from the Army of the Potomac. They had not suffered the near extinction of some of their Confederate counterparts, but they were badly thinned. All but three of the army’s infantry brigades were under the command of senior colonels or even lieutenant colonels, and an alarming number of regiments were commanded by captains. Many veteran regiments had consolidated their depleted ranks into fewer companies and been downsized to battalions. But they were solid, capable veterans that could be depended on.\n\nGeorge Crook’s 8th Corps, also known as the Army of West Virginia, were no newcomers to the Shenandoah Valley. Under Hunter they had fought at New Market, and under Crook they had fought at Second Kernstown. Both battles had been defeats, but they had also fought well in the victory at Third Winchester and had led the decisive Union flanking attack at Fisher’s Hill. The capable Crook had been Sheridan’s West Point roomate and was – at least at this time – a trusted friend.\n\nWilliam Emory’s 19th Corps had come the farthest to fight in the Valley. Sent to Louisiana in the early part of the war, they had taken part in the siege and capture of Port Hudson, and had just finished with Nathaniel Banks’ failed Red River campaign. Grant had ordered them shipped back east to join the Siege of Petersburg, but instead he sent them to the Shenandoah – an example of Early’s success at drawing Union forces away from the main theater.\n\nTwo veteran cavalry divisions from the Army of the Potomac were also sent from the fighting around Richmond. Although Union cavalry in the early days of the war had been somewhat of a joke, those days were long past. The veteran Union troopers, firing repeaters and well-supplied with equipment and remounts, were more than a match for threadbare Confederate troopers on their starving horses. The Union cavalry’s decisive charge at Third Winchester showed that they could be deadly to infantry as well, and the pursuit after that battle and Fisher’s Hill had helped turn Confederate retreat into a route.\n\nAll considered, the well fed, capable, and much more numerous Federal troops were a serious challenge for Early’s men. The fact that the Confederates almost won speaks volumes about the tattered, hungry men in grey.\n\nOrganization of the Federal Army of the Shenandoah\n\nCommanded by Major General Horatio Wright\n\nMajor General Philip Sheridan"
