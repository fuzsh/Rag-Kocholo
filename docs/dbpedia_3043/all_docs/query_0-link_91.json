        "text": "Gouverneur Kemble Warren Papers, 1848-1882\n\nSC10668\n\nView catalog record\n\nBiographical Note:\n\nGouverneur Kemble Warren was born January 8, 1830 in Cold Spring, New York. He entered the United States Military Academy at West Point at the age of sixteen, graduated second in his class in 1850, and was assigned to the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers.\n\nFrom 1850 to 1853 Warren served on several important survey expeditions, including surveys of the lower Mississippi delta in 1850-1851 to explore methods of flood prevention, and of the upper Mississippi rapids in 1853 to facilitate navigation of this vital trade route. From 1853 to 1855 he assisted in a government study to determine the best possible transcontinental railroad route, examining reports of all explorations west of the Mississippi back to Lewis and Clark. As part of this analysis, Warren began work on the first comprehensive map of the trans-Mississippi United States.\n\nIn 1855 Lt. Warren served as chief topographical officer in General William S. Harney's expedition against the Sioux in southern Nebraska Territory (present-day Nebraska and South Dakota). His topographical report of the region won him much acclaim in Congress and led to greater responsibility in future explorations. In 1856 Warren commanded a successful survey mission in northern Nebraska Territory along the Missouri River and sixty miles up the Yellowstone (in present-day North Dakota and eastern Montana). This was followed in 1857 with a dangerous survey of the Niobrara River and the Sioux-occupied Black Hills. These three expeditions were integral both to the Pacific Railroad report and to the building of military roads into the Nebraska Territory.\n\nWarren spent the following year in Washington compiling his findings into official reports and completing his map of the United States from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean, which accompanied Secretary of War Jefferson Davis's final report to Congress on the results of the transcontinental railroad route investigation. From 1859 to 1861 he served as an assistant mathematics professor at the United States Military Academy at West Point.\n\nIn May 1861 Warren was given a leave of absences from the academy to accept the offer of a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 5th New York Volunteer Regiment. By the end of the month Warren and his regiment were stationed outside Fortress Monroe, Virginia, seeing their first action at Big Bethel Church on June 9. Warren spent the remainder of the year drilling his regiment and utilizing his engineering skills in the construction of the Baltimore and Washington defenses. In October he was promoted to colonel of volunteers and given full command of his regiment.\n\nIn General George B. McClellan's 1862 Peninsula campaign Warren led his regiment at the siege of Yorktown before being given command of a brigade. He was slightly wounded at Gaine's Mill on June 27. At Malvern Hill on June 29 his command repulsed a Confederate division and was engaged the next day at Harrison's Landing. On August 30 Warren fought at the second battle of Bull Run, earning praise for a strategic holding maneuver in which he lost over fifty percent of his command. Understrength, his brigade was held in reserve at Antietam in September and Fredericksburg in December. On September 26 Warren was promoted to brigadier-general of volunteers.\n\nGeneral Warren was appointed Chief Topographical Engineer, Army of the Potomac, on February 3, 1863, and served mainly as an advisor to General George Hooker at Chancellorsville in early May. On May 12 he was named chief engineer.\n\nIn the midst of a Confederate attack on the Union left at Gettysburg on July 2, 1863, Warren realized that Little Round Top, a low mountain which commanded the entire Union left flank, was left unoccupied. Acting quickly, he virtually commandeered a regiment of troops from Syke's corps and rushed them to the top just in time to repulse a Confederate charge, thus saving the Union flank and most likely the battle. Warren was wounded again in the subsequent defense of Little Round Top. In August he was promoted major-general of volunteers and given temporary command of the wounded General W.S. Hancock's II Corps.\n\nWarren repulsed a heavy Confederate attack at Bristoe Station in mid-October. However, his last-minute cancellation of an assault at Mine Run on November 30 began to raise doubts about his willingness to act offensively, doubts which would linger, and eventually resulted in his removal from command.\n\nWarren was given permanent command of V Corps on March 23, 1864, in time for General Grant's long Wilderness Campaign. Warren and his new corps were engaged at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor in May and June, losing over 12,000 of the 28,000 troops in the command within a 43- day period. On June 18 they were involved in the unsuccessful initial assaults on Petersburg, then took part in the long siege which followed. On July 30 Warren's corps was one of those scheduled to participate in the assault which was to follow the explosion of a huge mine placed in a 75- foot tunnel under the Petersburg defenders. Although personal enemies tried to implicate him in the failure of his plan, Warren showed conclusively that he could not make his assault because IX Corps remained between his corps and the breach until after the Confederates had recovered from the explosion. In August and December, Warren earned distinction with his independent commands against the Weldon Railroad, a vital supply line to Petersburg.\n\nThe February 1865 engagement at Dabney's Mill served as prelude to the controversial battle at Five Forks from March 29 to April 1, in which General Philip H. Sheridan, under Grant's authority, removed Warren from command of V Corps. Grant and Sheridan both felt that Warren was overcautious in committing his troops offensively, and when Warren was delayed by conflicting orders in reinforcing Sheridan at Five Forks, Sheridan took the opportunity to remove him.\n\nThe friction between Grant and Warren lay in their conflicting ideas on the handling of troops. Grant, aware of his great numerical superiority over the Confederate army, constantly took the offensive without regard for casualties because he knew that he could afford to take losses much more easily than the Confederates could. Warren, on the other hand, was unwilling to attack unless he could be reasonably sure of victory without the loss of a large number of his men.\n\nAfter his removal from command, General Warren was given command first of Petersburg and the Southside Railroad and then of the Department of Mississippi, before resigning his volunteer commission on May 19, 1865. He remained in the regular army, however, as a major.\n\nIn addition to preparing official maps and reports of his Civil War campaigns, Major Warren spent 1866-1867 conducting surveys of the Mississippi River system. In 1869 he planned and built the Rock Island Bridge over the Mississippi. Throughout the 1870s he engaged in extensive bridge-building and harbor-improvement projects on the Mississippi, along the Atlantic Coast, and in the Great Lakes. On March 4, 1879 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel of engineers.\n\nThroughout the post-war period, Warren never ceased in his efforts to obtain an investigation into his removal from command at Five Forks. Finally, in December 1879, President Hayes ordered a court of inquiry. The court convened in January 1880 and closed in July 1881 to consider a verdict. The verdict reached in November 1882 exonerated Warren of all major accusations related to the Five Forks affair. However, Warren would never know his name had finally been cleared: he died on August 8, 1882 of \"acute liver failure\" related to diabetes.\n\nWarren left his wife, Emily Chase Warren, whom he had married on June 17, 1863, a son, Sydney, and a daughter, Emily.\n\nScope and Content Note:\n\nThe papers of Gouverneur Kemble Warren are of great value to scholars because he meticulously recorded and saved an extensive volume of material that presents much insight into his impressive thirty-two year military career. The papers are arranged generally chronologically in six series:\n\n1) Correspondence,\n\n2) Official Reports and Military Papers,\n\n3) Printed and Bound Materials,\n\n4) Letterbooks,\n\n5) Newspaper Clippings, Scrapbooks, and Photographs, and\n\n6) Maps.\n\nThe papers are of particular interest for their in-depth information into three areas.\n\nThe first is nineteenth-century Western exploration and surveying by the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, as documented in the journals, official reports, and maps of Warren, his superiors, and assistants. Of particular interest are a study of the various possible transcontinental railroad routes, which involved Warren's creation of the first comprehensive map of the United States west of the Mississippi in 1857; survey expeditions of the lower Mississippi's flood plains and rapids, and extensive explorations of the vast Nebraska Territory (which covered what is today Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, much of Montana, and part of Wyoming).\n\nThe second covers General Warren's Civil War years, during which he rose from lieutenant colonel of the Fifth New York Volunteer Regiment to major-general in command of the Fifth Corps, Army of the Potomac. He saw action at Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Cold Harbor, and Petersburg, among many other battles. His carefully preserved files of all these include exhaustive research into Five Forks, the last major battle of the war, after which Warren was relieved of his command.\n\nThe third covers the inner workings of a late-nineteenth-century military court of inquiry, recorded here in correspondence, notes, newspaper clippings, official reports, and testimony from Warren's inquiry into his removal at Five Forks.\n\nFor these and other areas, the Warren papers are an important source for historical research into many aspects of the United States military in the years surrounding and including the Civil War.\n\nThe Warren Papers also include personal correspondence of his wife, Emily Chase Warren and their daughter Emily Warren.Â Many of these letters offer insights into his personal life as husband and father as well as recollections about his military career.\n\nIn addition, this collection includes 615 stereographs. Subjects depicted include Native Americans of the Colorado River Valley, railroad building on the Central Pacific and Pennsylvania railroads, and scenery and natural features of many areas of the U.S., especially the Rocky Mountains and Minnesota.\n\nBox and Folder List\n\nPapers | Stereographs | Maps\n\nPapers\n\nStereographs\n\nMaps originally were on rolls; original roll number is in parentheses below folder number.\n\nMeasurements are in inches; for example, 36 x 34 = 36\" x 34\".\n\nCartographic Collection\n\nCivil War Maps in Bound Letterbooks (Boxes 20-23)\n\nThis table is a guide to maps in the letterbooks for the Civil War years.\n\nDates in brackets [ ] will help locate maps in each letterbook.\n\nMeasurements are in inches; for example, 6 x 6 = 6\" x 6\".\n\nCivil War Maps in Bound Letterbooks"
