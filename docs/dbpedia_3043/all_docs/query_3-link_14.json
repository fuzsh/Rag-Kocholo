        "text": "SOLD\n\nFine Gold Presentation 2nd Corps Badge Presented to Col. John H. Stover, 184th Pa. Infantry, Twice WIA – This finely crafted, enameled, gold** 2nd Corps badge, was presented to Col. John Huble Stover by the officers of his regiment. Engraved on the leaves of the trifoliate badge is the following:\n\n“PRESENTED TO\n\nCOL. JOHN H. STOVER COMD’G 184 P.V.I.\n\nBy the OFFICERS of HIS COMMAND”\n\nIn center of the badge, a gold, enameled shield bears the gold inlay numbers “184”; the surrounding blue and off white field, around the regimental number, indicates that Stover’s regiment was part of the 3rd Division. The interior surface of each of the exterior side of the leaves of the badge, is stippled and enameled brown, as is the stem. On the reverse side of the badge is engraved a series of significant battle honors:\n\n“Yorktown\n\nRichmond\n\nGarnetts Farm\n\nPeach Orchard\n\nSavage Station\n\nGlendale 1-2 Malvern Hills\n\nChantilly. Antietam.\n\nFredericksburg. Chancellorsville.\n\nGettysburg. Mine Run\n\nHatchers Run. Petersburg”\n\nThis exquisite corps badge retains its original, gold chain, perhaps indicating that the badge was to be used as a watch fob. This most impressive badge remains in superior condition and measures approximately as follows: Width – 1.5”; Height – 1.75”. Col. Stover enlisted at the onset of the war, in 1861, and would serve through to the end, in 1865, sustaining two wounds during the Siege of Petersburg, as well as being engaged in actions that included Savage Station, Malvern Hill, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Hatchers Run and the Siege of Petersburg.\n\n**We have had this corps badge analyzed and assayed by Kambourian Jewelers of Richmond, Va. – the gold is 13K; please see the image of the % analysis.\n\nJohn H.

The 106th, many of whose members had served in the militia and the 22nd infantry, was organized at Philadelphia from Aug. 14 to Oct. 31, 1861, and mustered into the U. S. service for a three years, term. Co. K was added on Feb. 28, 1862, from the 67th Pa. It was ordered to Poolesville, Md., and assigned to Col. Baker’s brigade, Gen. Stone’s division, but was unable, through lack of transportation facilities, to participate in the battle of Ball’s Bluff in which Col. Baker and his regiment were engaged. It took part in the siege of Yorktown in the spring of 1862; was held in reserve during the battle of Williamsburg, was active at Fair Oaks, Savage Station, Glendale and Malvern hill, after which a short respite followed. It arrived at Bull Run after the severest fighting was over, but at Antietam its losses were very heavy. At Fredericksburg it made a gallant charge and held the ground gained under heavy fire. Camp was broken for the Chancellorsville campaign in the spring of 1863, and the most important service rendered by the regiment was the reinforcement of the 6th corps at Salem Church. At Gettysburg it was closely engaged and captured many prisoners. After the battle it moved southward with the army; was engaged at Robertson’s tavern and shared in the Mine Run Campaign. Winter quarters were established at Stoneboro, where a number of the regiment reenlisted. The 106th was in action at the Wilderness, was for a number of days in the front ranks at Spottsylvania, joining in the successful charge on May 12; was also active at the North Anna river and Cold Harbor; moved to Petersburg about the middle of June and joined in the siege operations. On July 27, the veterans and recruits were formed into a battalion of three companies and united with the 69th Pa. for field service. The original members not reenlisted were mustered out at Philadelphia on Sept. 10, 1864, and the veteran battalion was mustered out on June 30, 1865, at Munson’s Hill, Va. The loss by death from wounds, accident and disease in the regiment was 191.\n\n106th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment\n\n106th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Active August 1862 to July 27, 1864 Country United States of America Allegiance Union Branch Infantry Engagements Battle of Ball’s Bluff\n\nBattle of Savage’s Station\n\nCharles City Cross Roads\n\nBattle of Malvern Hill\n\nBattle of South Mountain\n\nBattle of Antietam\n\nBattle of Gettysburg\n\nOverland Campaign\n\nFirst Battle of Deep Bottom\n\nThe 106th Pennsylvania (originally raised as the 5th California) was a volunteer infantry regiment which served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. It was part of the famous Philadelphia Brigade, which helped defend against Pickett’s Charge in the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nHistory\n\nThe regiment was recruited from Philadelphia between August and October 1861, with the exception of company K, which was transferred from the 27th Pennsylvania Infantry. Turner G. Morehead was selected colonel of the unit, with William L. Curry as lieutenant colonel and John H. Stover as major. It moved to Poolesville, Maryland, where it became part of Edward D. Baker‘s “California Brigade.” The 106th saw its first action at the Battle of Ball’s Bluff, on October 21, 1861.\n\nIt was next transferred to the II Corps of the Army of the Potomac. With the rest of George B. McClellan‘s army, it fought in the Peninsula Campaign. On June 10, Lieutenant Colonel Curry was captured while visiting the picket line. During the Seven Days Battles, the regiment fought at the battles of Savage’s Station, Charles City Cross Roads, and Malvern Hill.\n\nAlong with the Army of the Potomac, the 106th was transferred to Washington, D.C., too late to participate in the Second Battle of Bull Run. It did fight at the Battle of Antietam, where it was rushed with the rest of the 2nd Division to the aid of Joseph Hooker‘s corps in the West Woods. However, division commander John Sedgwick hastened into the fight without taking time to make an adequate reconnaissance. As a result, the division was attacked from three sides and forced to withdraw. The 106th lost one-third of its strength in this battle.\n\nOn July 3, 1863, the third day of fighting at Gettysburg, Companies A and B were sent as skirmishers to the Bliss Farm in front of Cemetery Ridge.\n\nThe 106th continued to serve through the Overland Campaign. On July 27, 1864, those eligible for discharge were sent to Washington, D.C., where they performed guard duty until September 10, when they were sent home. The rest of the regiment was consolidated into a battalion of three companies—F, H, and K. This battalion fought through the Appomattox Campaign and was discharged on June 30, 1865.\n\nCasualties during the war\n\n· Killed and mortally wounded: 9 officers, 90 enlisted men\n\n· Wounded: 1 officer, 94 enlisted men\n\n· Died of disease: 24 officers, 373 enlisted men\n\n· Captured or missing: 5 officers, 152 men\n\n· Total casualties: 39 officers, 709 enlisted men\n\n184th PA Infantry\n\n( 3-years )\n\nOrganized: Camp Curtin, Harrisburg, PA on 5/10/64\n\nMustered Out: 7/14/65 at Washington, DCOfficers Killed or Mortally Wounded: 3\n\nOfficers Died of Disease, Accidents, etc.: 0\n\nEnlisted Men Killed or Mortally Wounded: 110\n\nEnlisted Men Died of Disease, Accidents, etc.: 122\n\n(Source: Fox, Regimental Losses)\n\nFrom To Brigade Division Corps Army Comment Jun ’64 Jul ’65 1 2 2 Army of Potomac New Organization, Mustered Out\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nONE HUNDRED and EIGHTY-FOURTH INFANTRY\n\n(Three Years; One Year)\n\nOne Hundred and Eighty-fourth Infantry. – Col., John H. Stover; Lieut.-Col., Charles Kleckner; Majs., Charles Kleckner, George L. Ritman. This regiment was recruited from the state at large and rendezvoused at Camp Curtin, Harrisburg. During May, 1864, seven companies were mustered into the U. S. service for a three years’ term, the remaining three companies being mustered in during Sept. 1864, for a one year term, and joined the regiment before Petersburg early in Oct., 1864. Col. Sto- ver did not assume command of the regiment until Jan. 1, 1865. He had previously served as captain in the 10th, and major in the 106th. On May 14 1864, the seven companies then organized, left the state for the front under the command of Maj. Kleck- ner, and joined the army of the Potomac as it was crossing the Pamunkey river. It was at once assigned to the 2nd brigade, 2nd division, 2nd corps; took part in the fighting at Cold Har- bor, leading its brigade in two deadly assaults. Its loss here was 16 killed and 94 wounded, and it won the warm commendation of its brigade commander, Gen. Pierce. In the first assaults on Petersburg, it again lost severely, having 52 killed and wounded and 115 taken prisoners. During its 25 days of active service at the front, the command lost 350 out of its 500 mem- bers, including 12 officers killed, wounded, or captured. Seven of the prisoners died at Andersonville and several more at Salisbury and Florence, while many of the wounded prisoners died at Petersburg. The fragment of the regiment which was left was engaged at Deep Bottom and Strawberry Plains in July, losing 27 killed and wounded out of 97 engaged. It was active at Reams’ station, where Lieut.-Col. Kleckner was severely wounded while cheering on his men. It then served in the trenches before Petersburg until the close of October, being joined meanwhile by the three new companies. Late in October it fought at Hatcher’s run, losing 15 killed and wounded, and then resumed its place in the trenches, being stationed between Forts Haskell and Stedman, where it was much exposed to the en- emy’s sharpshooters. In Feb., 1865, it was actively engaged at Dabney’s mill and remained encamped on the field until the. opening of the final campaign at the close of March. In the assault on Petersburg, April 2, it escaped with small loss and then moved with its corps in the final pursuit of the enemy, which ended with Lee’s surrender at Appomattox. Returning to Washington it participated in the grand review May 23. The one year companies, H, I and K, were mustered out of service on June 2, 1865, at Munson’s hill, Va., and the original seven companies, A to G, were mustered out near Washington, July 14, 1865.\n\n184th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment\n\nThe 184th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment lost 3 officers and 110 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded and 122 enlisted men to disease during the Civil War.\n\n1864 May, 1864 Organized at Harrisburg under Colonel John H.

A successful lawyer and newspaper publisher in Pennsylvania before the Civil War, when the conflict started he was mustered in as Captain and commander of Company B, 10th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry on April 24, 1861. Serving until he was honorably mustered out on July 31, 1861, he accepted a commission of Major, 106th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry on November 5, 1861. He served with his unit, which was part of the famed “Philadelphia Brigade” of the Army of the Potomac, over the next two and a half years, and was present at the July 1863 Battle of Gettysburg where the regiment helped to stop Pickett’s Charge on the 3rd day of the battle. On April 4, 1864 he was commissioned Colonel and commander of the 184th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, but was not officially mustered into that rank and duty until December 30, 1864, due to severely critical remarks of the mustering officer of his military character. It took personal intervention of President Abraham Lincoln to countermand those charges. He would lead his new regiment through the end of the war, and was honorably mustered out on July 14, 1865. Soon after he moved to Missouri, where he served as District Attorney for Morgan County before being elected as a Republican to represent Missouri’s 5th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives in 1868, filling the vacancy caused by the by the resignation of Congressman Joseph W. McClurg. He served from December 7, 1868 to March 3, 1869, and did not seek re-election. He resided in Missouri working as a lawyer and real estate agent until his passing in 1889."
