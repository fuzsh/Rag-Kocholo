        "text": "To the formation of this regiment the counties of Potter, Tioga, Lycoming, Clearfield, Clarion, Lebanon, Allegheny, Luzerne, Mifflin, and Huntington contributed men. The successes achieved and the gallant services rendered by the original famous \"Bucktails\" induced the war department to organize and equip other similar regiments, and in pursuance of the authority invested in him by the secretary of war, Roy Stone, who ranked as major in the original Bucktail regiment, and who commanded one of its battalions through many a hot battle with McClellan's army on the Peninsula, was directed to proceed at once to Pennsylvania and rise a Bucktail Brigade. This was in July, 1862. In less than twenty days the One Hundred and Forty-ninth and the One Hundred and Fiftieth regiments were formed and ready to receive their equipments for the field. These two were suddenly called to the defense of the nation's capitol, as the hosts of the Confederacy had invaded Maryland and seriously threatened the whole region around Washington.\n\nClearfield County was represented in the One Hundred and Forty-ninth either in whole or in part, in the formation of Companies B and E. Upon the complete organization of the regiment the following were the field officers: Roy Stone, colonel; Walton Dwight, lieutenant-colonel; George W. Speer, major. For the remaining part of the year 1862, and until the middle of February of the succeeding year, the regiment remained on duty in the vicinity of Washington, after which they were ordered to the front, and proceeded to Belle Plain, Va., where with the One Hundred and Forty-third Pennsylvania they formed the Second Brigade of the First Army Corps, and Colonel Stone was placed in command.\n\nThey were first under fire from the enemy on the Rappahannock, a short distance form Pollock's Mills, and held firmly to their position. Early the next morning, May 2, it marched to join the main Army in the fierce battle at Chancellorsville and arrived there before daylight on the morning of the 3rd and at once began the construction of rifle pits. For several days and nights following the regiments were engaged, reconnoitering and skirmishing here and there, attacking the enemy's pickets and capturing several prisoners, and generally rendering commendable service bravely facing danger with the fearlessness of veterans.\n\nFollowing closely upon the heels of Chancellorsville came the Gettysburg campaign, General Lee, commanding the Confederate forces, having moved northward early in June. During the first and second days the regiment was actively engaged, occupying prominent and important positions, and exposed to an almost constant fire from the enemy's battery or sharpshooters. During the third day it was held in reserve and was marching to meet Pickett's division when the Confederate forces withdrew. In this long and bloody fight the regiment certainly established the fact that the name by which they were known, \"Bucktails,\" was worthily applied; but the command fared badly at Gettysburg. Colonel Stone, the gallant commander, was severely wounded, as was Lieutenant-Colonel Dwight, Captain John Irvin, of Company B, and Lieutenant Mitchell, of Company E. In his official report of the Gettysburg fight General Doubleday says: \"I relied greatly on Stone's brigade to hold the post assigned it (between the brigades of Cutler and Meredith), as I soon saw that I should be obliged to change front with a portion of my line, to face the northwest, and his brigade held the pivot of the movement. My confidence in this noble body of men was not misplaced. They repulsed the repeated attacks of vastly superior numbers, and maintained their position until the final retreat of the whole line.\" After the battle the regiment lay encamped for a day or two on the field, and started with the army in pursuit of Lee and his retreating forces. The events that followed during the fall campaign were unimportant, and early in December, they were into winter quarters near Culpepper.\n\nEarly in May of the year 1864, the brigade was prepared for the spring campaign and moved for their winter camp to a point near the old Wilderness Tavern, but remaining there but a single night, again moved forward out on the Log road, where a line of battle was formed, then pushing forward met the enemy in a fierce and almost hand to hand conflict, but having an inferior position for successful battle, was slowly force back to the Lacy House, where they re-formed and were held in reserve for the rest of the day. In this encounter the regiment suffered severely at the hands of the rebels, being taken at a great disadvantage and somewhat by surprise. Early in the evening, however, the regiment retrieved its loss, having been moved to the right of the Second Corps, led the charge and drove the enemy from his position, and with but slight loss to its own force. On the morning of the 6th the battle was renewed with all its vigor, with success at first, but later the whole line was compelled to fall back leaving the brave commander, Wadsworth, dying on the field. In the afternoon the brigade was ordered to a charge against Longstreet's forces in the hope of recovering a lost position, and nobly was the order executed, after which the regiment was relieved and retired to the rear for rest and recuperation. In this two days' contest the regiment lost in killed, fifteen; in wounded, ninety-nine; and in prisoners taken, ninety-two--about one-fourth of its entire number.\n\nOn the morning of the 18th, after an all night march, the regiment reached Laurel Hill, and immediately went on to the relief of the cavalry. Although very much fatigued from its long march, and being in an exposed position, it held firmly to its ground during the day, and at evening threw up breastworks. After a day in reserve it again went to the front attacking the enemy and driving them into their works. On the 12th they again charged, but were repulsed with some loss. The men then went to support the Sixth Corps, and took a position at the front where they were exposed to the merciless fire of the rebel sharpshooters. They then moved again, and during the night of the 13th to a position one mile east of Spotsylvania Court-house. With the First Division the regiment moved on to Petersburg, and both in the siege and assault upon the enemy's works it was actively engaged. It was then under command of Colonel John Irvin, he having been promoted to that rank April 22, 1864. From the time of the opening of the campaign in May, until the close of the month of July, the One Hundred and Forty-ninth Regiment, according to the report of Colonel Irvin, lost two commissioned officers, and thirty-two men killed, six commissioned officers, and two hundred and forty-three men wounded, and one hundred and twenty-one missing, an aggregate of four hundred and four.\n\nOn the 18th of August, 1864, the regiment joined in the first assault on the Weldon Railroad. Although at close quarters, and in a severe struggle, on account of an admirable position, its loss was very light, while that of the beaten enemy was quite severe. On the 11th of September, they were relieved from duty at the front and went into reserve, and so continued until the 7th of December when it joined in the grand raid upon the Weldon Railroad, and on the return therefrom acted as rear guard, in which position they were continually harassed by the Confederate cavalry.\n\nIn the early part of February, 1865, it joined the movement to Dabney Mills, and participated in the engagement at that point, the last conflict of arms in which the gallant regiment took an active part. It was then detached from the Army of the Potomac and sent to Elmira, N.Y., where, with the One Hundred and Fiftieth, it was on guard duty at the camp for rebel prisoners. Here it remained until the close of its term of service, and was mustered out on the 24 of June, and proceeding to Harrisburg was paid and disbanded.\n\nField and Staff Officers\n\nColonels:\n\nRoy Stone, August 30, 1862; wounded at Gettysburg July 1, 1863; brevetted brigadier-general September 7, 1864; discharged by special order January 27, 1865.\n\nJohn Irvin, August 26, 1862; promoted from captain company B to major February 10, 1864; to lieutenant-colonel April 22, 1864; to colonel February 21, 1865; discharged by special order August 4, 1865.\n\nLieutenant-Colonels:\n\nWalton Dwight, August 27, 1862; promoted from captain company K, August 29, 1862; wounded at Gettysburg, Pa., July 1, 1863; discharged by special order March 31, 1864.\n\nJames Glenn, August 23, 1862; promoted from captain company D to major April 22, 1864; to lieutenant-colonel February 21, 1865; discharged by special order August 4, 1865.\n\nMajors:\n\nGeorge W.
