        "text": "High Quality Civil War Id’d Officer’s Traveling Mess Utensils in Original Case – This fine quality, officer grade mess utensils’ kit – folding, knife, fork and spoon – each with ivory-like handles, with each actual utensil constructed of Sheffield, England, hallmarked silver (see below information dating and explaining the hallmarks). The utensils are housed in their original, light wood, carrying case, with a custom designed, interior compartment for each utensil. The interior of the carrying case is lined with an off-purple colored velvet. The exterior of the light wood case is covered with a fine grade of thin leather, comparable to a period image case, with a small, flat, iron, hook closing device. The underside of the case is covered with original, period, marbled paper. Contained in the interior of the carrying case is an old file card with following label, written in pencil:\n\n“Capt. Calvin Dewitt\n\nMedical Corps\n\n49th P.V.\n\noutside Bedford, Pa.”\n\nDewitt served in the Army of the Potomac during the Civil War, as a Captain, in the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, from October 1861 to January 1863; after 1863, Dewitt saw additional service, during the war, as a surgeon, in the army medical corps. It appears that based upon the date that accrues the hallmarks, Dewitt obtained this kit sometime in late 1864 or early 1865. After the war, he was appointed First Lieutenant, Assistant Surgeon, United States Army, May 14, 1867, and advanced through the grades to Colonel, Assistant Surgeon General, United States Army, May 7, 1901; he would be promoted to the rank of Brigadier General, August 9, 1903 and retire from active service on August 10, 1903. Immediately following the Civil War, Dewitt served as a medical officer in several campaigns against Indians and in Cuba. He was an instructor in military hygiene, at the General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and professor of military medicine and later president of the Army Medical School, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe style and construction of the carrying case and three, silver utensils are indicative of late Civil War period use. Captain Dewitt, upon his death, in recognition of his lengthy and significant Army career, was interred in Arlington Cemetery. This is a finely crafted case, that remains in excellent condition.\n\nCase measures: L – 4.5”; W – 3.5”\n\nHallmark on the back of each utensil: WH & S B Ltd\n\nThe hallmarks on the back of each utensil are indicative of manufacture by William Hutton & Sons, manufacturing silversmiths founded in 1800, in Birmingham, England, transferring to Sheffield in 1832. William Hutton established the firm, and, with the move to Sheffield, they also became platers, having licensed an electroplating technique.\n\nWilliam Hutton & Sons Ltd was not always classed as a limited company, pre-1893 the silverware company that became William Hutton & Sons Ltd started life as simply William Hutton in 1800. It was in 1800 when William Hutton established his silverware firm in Birmingham, which later moved to Sheffield, in 1832, when it became clear that the firm was well and truly active in the silversmith industry. After William’s death, in 1864, the business was continued in the same style by his son William Carr Hutton, the name was subsequently changed to William Hutton & Son, after William Carr Hutton’s death, in 1865.\n\nCalvin DeWitt\n\n49th PA Infantry\n\n( 3-years )\n\nOrganized: Camp Curtin, Harrisburg, PA on 10/1/61\n\nMustered Out: 7/15/65 at Hall’s Hill, VA\n\nOfficers Killed or Mortally Wounded: 9\n\nOfficers Died of Disease, Accidents, etc.: 0\n\nEnlisted Men Killed or Mortally Wounded: 184\n\nEnlisted Men Died of Disease, Accidents, etc.: 168\n\n(Source: Fox, Regimental Losses)\n\nFrom To Brigade Division Corps Army Comment Oct ’61 Mar ’62 3 Smith’s Army of Potomac New Organization Mar ’62 May ’62 1 2 4 Army of Potomac May ’62 Jan ’63 1 2 6 Army of Potomac Feb ’63 Jul ’64 3 1 6 Army of Potomac Aug ’64 Sep ’64 Harper’s Ferry: East SH Reserve Department of West Virginia Sep ’64 Dec ’64 3 1 6 Army of the Shenandoah Dec ’64 Jul ’65 3 1 6 Army of Potomac Mustered Out\n\n49th Regiment\n\nPennsylvania Volunteers\n\nCompany I\n\nRecruited in Juniata County\n\nCalvin De Witt Captain September 14, 1861 Resigned January 18, 1863\n\nPennsylvania\n\n49TH INFANTRY\n\n(3 years)\n\n49th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment\n\n49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Active September 14, 1861 – July 15, 1865 Country United States of America Allegiance Union Branch Infantry Engagements Siege of Yorktown\n\nBattle of Williamsburg\n\nSeven Days Battles\n\nBattle of Garnett’s & Golding’s Farm\n\nBattle of Savage’s Station\n\nBattle of White Oak Swamp\n\nBattle of Malvern Hill\n\nBattle of South Mountain\n\nBattle of Antietam\n\nBattle of Fredericksburg\n\nBattle of Chancellorsville\n\nBattle of Gettysburg\n\nBristoe Campaign\n\nSecond Battle of Rappahannock Station\n\nMine Run Campaign\n\nBattle of Germanna Ford\n\nBattle of the Wilderness\n\nBattle of Spotsylvania Court House\n\nBattle of North Anna\n\nBattle of Cold Harbor\n\nSiege of Petersburg\n\nBattle of Fort Stevens\n\nThird Battle of Winchester\n\nBattle of Hatcher’s Run\n\nAppomattox Campaign\n\nThird Battle of Petersburg\n\nBattle of Sailor’s Creek\n\nThe 49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.\n\nService\n\nThe 49th Pennsylvania Infantry was organized in Lewistown and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and mustered in September 14, 1861 at Camp Curtin for a three-year enlistment under the command of Colonel William H.
