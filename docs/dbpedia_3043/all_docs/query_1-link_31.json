        "text": "The Pennsylvania State Archives holds many records relating to the American Civil War, 1861-1865. These materials document the commonwealth's activities during the war.\n\nResources with Detailed Information about Civil War Records\n\nGuides\n\nTeachers should refer to A Guide for Classroom Teachers Researching the Civil War at the Pennsylvania State Archives (PDF).\n\nGuide to Civil War Records (PDF) by Douglas L. Royer. This guide presents its information according to topic - regiments, pensions, border damage claims, hospitals, maps, photographs, prisons, monuments, etc.\n\nPennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission Guide to Civil War Holdings (PDF) by Dr. James P. Weekes and Linda A. Ries. This guide presents its information collection by collection rather than by topic. It covers a wider variety of collections, though, including those of the State Museum of Pennsylvania, the Bureau for Historic Preservation and various historic sites in addition to the State Archives holdings.\n\nBooks\n\nHistory of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-1865 is a five-volume series by Samuel P. Bates. These books contain a wealth of information about Pennsylvania Civil War soldiers and units, including short regimental histories and lists of soldiers' names. The volumes are arranged by military unit, and are name-indexed by the PA State Archives' Civil War Veterans' Card File,1861-1866.\n\nRegister of Civil War Volunteers, 1861-1865 is another index of basic information about each soldier, arranged by regiment and company.\n\nPlease note: the information in the Bates series is incomplete, having been taken from our muster-out rolls but not necessarily the muster-in rolls or other related documents. If you do not find a soldier's name here, you should continue your research in other secondary sources, as well as the original records held by the State Archives.\n\nWebsites\n\nPennsylvania Volunteers of the Civil War: collection of helpful links for genealogical research of Civil War soldiers.\n\nCivil War Soldiers and Sailors System: a database of information compiled by the National Park Service.\n\nPennsylvanians in the Civil War: search for individual soldiers serving in Pennsylvania units, by unit designation and other categories on this Penn State University sponsored site.\n\nVeterans from Other States\n\nGenerally, only Pennsylvania veterans are referenced in the original Civil War records held by the Pennsylvania State Archives. Even though the momentous battle of Gettysburg was fought on Pennsylvania soil, the State Archives does not have the records of non-Pennsylvanians who saw action in that battle. The State Archives does not compile individual service files or unit histories.\n\nCivil War Pension files for soldiers from all states, including Pennsylvania, are located at the National Archives.\n\nSearching for an Individual Pennsylvania Veteran\n\nWhat you should know first\n\nVeteran's full name\n\nVeteran's exact or approximate birthdate\n\nVeteran's county or residence or enlistment\n\n(Optional) Veteran's unit of service\n\nRecords to Search for Individual Veterans\n\nCivil War Veteran's Card File, 1861-1866 (Record Group 19, digitized rolls 3176-3251)\n\nView scanned images of these cards can be viewed at Civil War Veterans' Card File, 1861-1866 Indexes\n\nCivil War Pension File, 1861-1864 (part of Civil War Service and Pension Accounts, 1861-1873. {#2.47}\n\nRegister of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-1864. {#19.65}\n\nList of Sick and Wounded Soldiers, Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-1864 (Record Group 19)\n\nCivil War Muster Rolls (Record Group 19)\n\nMilitary Claims File (Record Group 2, digitized rolls 63-130)\n\nRecords of the Pennsylvania Soldiers' and Sailors' Home, 1864-1893 (Record Group 19) (digitized rolls 492, 6143-6151, 6153-6154)\n\nAlphabetical List of Names on Pennsylvania Monuments (Record Group 19) 3870\n\nConscientious Objector Depositions, 1862 (see also digitized roll 4187 for 1862 Register of C.O.s at the National Archives) (Record Group 19) (digitized rolls 505-507)\n\nRegister of Aliens and Persons Having Conscientious Scruples Against Bearing Arms (National Archives) (digitized roll 4187)\n\nLists of Deserters and Substitutes, 1861-1866 (Record Group 19) (digitized roll 493)\n\nList of Sick and Wounded Soldiers, Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-1864 (Record Group 19) (digitized rolls 493-494)\n\nMiscellaneous Discharge Certificates, 1861-66 (Record Group 19) (digitized roll 493)\n\nNegroes in Military Service in the United States (National Archives) (digitized roll 2040)\n\nRecord Books of Claims for Arrears of Pay and Bounty, 1864-1869 (Record Group 19) (digitized rolls 494-495)\n\nRecords of Drafted Men and Substitutes, 1862, 1864-1865 (Record Group 19) (digitized rolls 498-501)\n\nRegister of Sick and Wounded Soldiers, Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-65 (Record Group 19) (digitized rolls 493-494)\n\nRegisters of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 1861-1865 (Record Group 19) (digitized rolls 508-522)\n\nSubstitutes' Depositions, 1862 (Record Group 19) (digitized rolls 502-504)\n\nSearching the Records of a Civil War Unit\n\nThe State Archives holds Civil War regimental records only for Pennsylvania units, including those regiments of U.S. Colored Troops formed in the Commonwealth.
