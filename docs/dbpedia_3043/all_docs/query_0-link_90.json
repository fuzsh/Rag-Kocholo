        "text": "#557\n\n23 Aug 15Next week I should finish ordering the compiled service records for the men who are listed in the index but about whom I have no other information. Once I have those recorded, I'll start re-examining the more complete statistics. But I may exclude people who didn't begin and end in the 91st. So far I know of 167 who transferred to the 91st from another regiment, 6 temporarily assigned to the 91st, 1 who was transferred to another regiment, and 9 mistakenly assigned to the 91st. Excluding those 183 men will mean, for example, not having to worry about what to do with men who died or were discharged before they were transferred on paper to the regiment (James Appel, William O'Conner, and William Lindsay). Unfortunately, this won't take care of all the problem cases; see for example Charles Hannigan, Charles Blazo, and David Wood. #556\n\n16 Aug 15Two brothers of William Burkett also served in the Civil War, and both died. In 1913, he was described as a loyal citizen, an ardent supporter of progress, 'a broad-minded man and a warm-hearted friend', and as having had an exemplary life and career. And the fifty (or more) barns he had built were all splendidly constructed! #555\n\n9 Aug 15I've recently run across two odd inconsistencies in dates.\n\nFirst, Solomon Parker enlisted on 16 February 1864, but is on muster and descriptive roll dated 9 February 1864.\n\nSecond, John Callahan (I) was transferred to the Invalid Corps on 13 August 1863--but was also transferred to company E on 19 August 1862, returned to duty on 27 September 1863, reenlisted as a veteran volunteer on 24 December 1863, and was wounded on 1 June 1864. I have no idea how to reconcile the inconsistent records.\n\n#554\n\n2 Aug 15John Lackey's compiled service record provides more information about bounty payments. The bounty of $300 was paid in instalments; when the regiment mustered out, he had received the first two instalments, totalling $100, and was due $200. One roll lists the first installment as $60, and several list the third installment as $40. (The records aren't completely consistent; other muster rolls claim he had been paid $110, and one muster roll claims the first three installments totalled $160.) (And just to add another inconsistency: the company descriptive book claims he was 5 feet 5 inches tall, and had a dark complexion, dark eyes, and dark hair--but the compiled service record cards claim he was 5 feet 4-1/2 inches tall, and had a light complexion, blue eyes, and dark hair.) #553\n\n26 Jul 15When the 118th Pennsylvania Infantry was mustered out, 113 of its men were transferred to the 91st. Of those 113 men, 34 (30%) were not recorded in the 91st's company descriptive books. None of the thirty men transferred to company F were recorded. The other four were two of the commissioned officers (John Bell (A) and James Donnelly (H)), Jacob Hause (perhaps because he wasn't assigned to a company, having been wounded in May 1865), and Daniel Yingling (B). #552\n\n19 Jul 15I'm starting to get a bunch of muster (and other) roll entries recorded, from the compiled service records. (Unfortunately, the National Archives won't copy the actual muster rolls, because they're too fragile. And given the cost of the compiled military service records, I'm not likely ever to collect all of them!) I've noticed two small points.\n\nThe men who volunteered in 1862 received a bounty of $25, and a premium of $4. The last premium I've recorded so far was in October 1862, and the bounties seem to have been delayed by 1863. No doubt the delay was to increase the probability the men would actually show up; I don't know why the premium ended. (Eventually, I hope to be able to test whether it succeeded!)\n\nSecond, the special muster roll of 18 August 1862 was undoubtedly intended to determine how many men the regiment would actually send into the field, since on 21 August 1862, the regiment was relieved of duty in Alexandria Virginia by the 94th New York. The other special muster, on 10 April 1863, was a special muster of the entire Army, \"to find out how many men is [sic] required to fill up all the regiments to the required standard[,] that is[,] one thousand men' (letter). Of course, they never came close to doing that. (The highest number of enlisted men present for duty occurred on 26 April 1865, but even then the regiment had only 887 men total in it, and only 620 enlisted men present for duty.\n\n#551\n\n12 Jul 15I've been relying on the Pennsylvania veterans burial cards (available on Ancestry) for information about soldiers' deaths. I now suspect that they misidentify the Thomas Thomas who served in the 91st. (See the note on that page for more details.) Perhaps whoever reported the burial simply looked up Thomas Thomas in Bates, and picked someone plausible. That's discouraging, since it means I should really reevaluate all the deaths I've reported based on those cards. #550\n\n5 Jul 15Owen Murry enlisted on 6 November 1862, at Philadelphia. Acting Assistant Surgeon J K Mason noted that Murry had had rheumatism 3 years earlier, and was in the habit of drinking, but certified he was able to perform the duties of a soldier. However, Murry is not listed on any of the regiment's company muster rolls, presumably because he never reached the regiment. And he was discharged on 18 March 1863, because of chronic rheumatism and general debility, which the surgeon stressed existed before Murry enlisted. This data would be hard to collect, but it would be interesting to see whether inspecting surgeons differed in the percentage of men they approved who were discharged because of pre-existing disability. (See fact of the week #545 for a similar case.) #549\n\n28 Jun 15John A Mootheart (B) deserted on 1 March 1864. (He had deserted once before, but returned when Lincoln proclaimed an amnesty for deserters who voluntarily returned.) Is he the John Moothart who was convicted of counterfeiting in August 1866? That John Moothart had a brother Charles, who was also tried but acquitted. And a Charles Moothart was a notorious horse thief, along with his brother William. Note that John claimed to be a chairmaker when he enlisted in the 91st, and in the 1863 Philadelphia directory, Charles, George, and William were chairmakers, and John was a chaircaner, with all of them living at 872 Darien Street. #548\n\n21 Jun 15Many family members served in the 91st, including at least ten father-son pairs. For example, George Black (H) served with his father (also named George Black, and first lieutenant of company H), although he was only twelve years old when he enlisted. He was determined to go wherever his father went, even in the charge up Marye's Heights in Fredericksburg, and in the battle of Chancellorsville. His father was mortally wounded there, and according to William Reiff, 'thereafter the spirited boy was filled with sorrow'. (See Reiff's 'A boy hero: a young drummer made of the right kind of stuff'.) #547\n\n14 Jun 15On 4 July 1899, a monument was dedicated to men who served in the Civil War from Crescentville. At least one member of the 91st was included, Archibald Nimmo. #546\n\n7 Jun 15When someone enlisted, they had to sign a \"Declaration of Recruit\", with a witness to their signature. Sometimes, the only witness is the enlisting officer. But in some cases, multiple people witnessed the signature. For example, Patrick Halligan and Joseph Mantz both enlisted on 2 September 1862, and their declarations were witnessed by JA Gregory, Joseph H Sinex, and George M Gibson. I wonder whether the additional witnesses were sent to escort volunteers to the regiment. Once I've finished getting compiled service records for the men who are in the index to the compiled service records but not in the company descriptive books, I'll try calculating percentages of volunteers who arrived, by the month they enlisted. For now, here's are the enlisting officers and witnesses I have for men who enlisted in September 1862:\n\ndatesoldierenlisting officerwitness(es)2 SepPatrick HalliganJA GregoryJA Gregory, Joseph H Sinex, George M Gibson2 SepJoseph MantzJA GregoryJA Gregory, Joseph H Sinex, George M Gibson4 SepJoseph H CrossJA GregoryE J Maguigan5 SepCharles HartJA GregoryE J Maguigan, George M Gibson, W H H Hopkins6 SepAndrew HarteJA GregoryJA Gregory, George M Gibson, W H H Hopkins10 SepJoseph HynesJA GregoryJA Gregory10 SepSamuel MahanJA GregoryJA Gregory11 SepJohn HortonJA GregoryJA Gregory, Robert H Sinex 12 SepThomas BrooksJA GregoryJA Gregory16 SepOtto BrandekerF Winter (75 PA)F Winter (75th PA)18 SepJames DysonJA GregoryJA Gregory18 SepJohn DayB B EyreB B Eyre19 SepWilliam J MahardJA GregoryJA Gregory\n\n#545\n\n31 May 15When John R Lynch enlisted, on 30 August 1862, the surgeon (J K Mason) reported he had a \"Small Varicocele\", and was fit for service. He was admitted to hospital in November, and discharged on 30 January 1863. The surgeon who examined him then reported him incapable of service 'because of Secondary Syphilis of long standing, and varicocele of both cords'. Which surgeon was right is, unfortunately, impossible to judge. However, he also apparently served in the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry, from 8 March 1865, perhaps through 7 August 1865. #544\n\n24 May 15Marcia Westphal was the third wife of Andrew Strong, who was assigned temporarily in company I of the 91st. She died in 1962--the latest death of a spouse I have so far found. #543\n\n17 May 15Patrick Halligan (B) deserves praise for honesty. The (very primitive) medical examination form asks whether the soldier is in the habit of drinking, and whether he has ever had the \"horrors\". Soldiers usually answered \"no\" to both. But Halligan admitted that he was in the habit of drinking, and had experienced the \"horrors\" about three years earlier. (He also deserves censure; he is not on any of the company muster rolls, which suggests he deserted on the way to the regiment.) #542\n\n10 May 15I have finished transcribing the 3313 cards from the index to the compiled military service records listed in Fold3 as being about people who served in the 91st PA. These cards led me to combine fifteen men (and may lead to combining others), and included 72 people I did not have information about. I plan to get the rest of the compiled service records for those 72 people (to confirm that they served in the 91st PA), and for some other men whom I have questions about, and hope by the end of this year to have a good idea of how many people served in the 91st. #541\n\n3 May 15Peter Van Buren's widow Sarah filed an application for a pension on 30 January 1864, which was accepted on 19 September 1864. The only oddity about her application is that the Pension Bureau's summary reports Van Buren as having served in the 91st New York, although the Adjutant General's summary clearly reports him as having served in the 91st Pennsylvania. Strikingly, when Sarah applied for an increase in pension because of their underage children (under the Act of 25 July 1866), she reported him as having served in the 91st New York. Perhaps the confusion is related to the fact that Peter and Sarah lived in Albany, New York. (Unfortunately, the pension certificate file doesn't even hint at why he came to Philadelphia and enlisted in the 91st Pennsylvania, instead of enlisting in a New York regiment.) #540\n\n26 Apr 15If I've reconstructed Adam Guthrie's story correctly, he seems to have been unduly eager to join the army. He enlisted in the 91st on 24 November 1862, and was discharged on 16 March 1863, without being taken up on any of the 91st's muster rolls, because of organic heart disease contracted since enlistment. (I admit I'm a bit dubious. Did the examining board want to protect the examining surgeon from accusations of having missed the organic heart disease?) He had been unfit for duty for sixty days in the previous two months, and was rated two-thirds disabled. Nevertheless, just four months later, on 15 July 1863, he enlisted in the 26th Pennsylvania (from which he was transferred to the 99th Pennsylvania). (How did he pass the physical? And did he admit that he had been discharged on disability? Perhaps not, and that may be why he didn't mention his service in the 91st when he applied for a pension.) He served as 'a good and efficient soldier' until 8 March 1865, when he was 'taken with a fit', after developing a severe cold from exposure while on picket, which led to paralysis on his right side. He died of apoplexy, about a year later, on 21 May 1866. #539\n\n19 Apr 15Kersey J Cook died in Augur General Hospital on 16 July 1865, after the regiment was mustered out, but while he was still in the army. He was simply reported \"absent, sick\" in Bates. I do not know whether other men died while in service, but after the regiment was mustered out. #538\n\n12 Apr 15After E Banker withdrew from her position as matron ofthe 91st's hospital on 28 February 1862, the 91st seems to have had one other matron. Mary B Roberts was attached to the hospital on 8 May 1862. She seems not to have stayed long; the May-June 1862 muster roll is the only muster roll listing her. #537\n\n5 Apr 15Elisha Skipper was another person transferred or temporarily assigned to the 91st, while they were assigned to duty in the defenses of Washington and he was in hospital. The records of the 2nd Maryland report that he was 'Retained [or Detained] in 91st Penna Regt (cause unknown)'. Eventually, the 2nd Maryland apparently gave up, and reported him deserted, months after he had actually been discharged. Surprisingly, although he (and later his widow) received a pension, and he died in 1903, it was only on 6 March 1909 that the Adjutant General's Office officially determined that the desertion charge was erroneous. #536\n\n29 Mar 15Isaachar Morgan (G) applied for a pension on 21 February 1909, without success. Under the Act of 27 June 1890, anyone who (a) served ninety days or more, (b) was honorably discharged, and (c) couldn't make a living from manual labor, was eligible for a pension. Since Morgan was 81 years old, he probably met condition (c), and the regimental records I've seen do not suggest his discharge was in any way dishonorable. That suggests he failed condition (a). He enlisted and was mustered in on 2 March 1865, and was discharged on 30 May 1865. If the first and last days are included, that's 90 days. Perhaps dates were calculated as intervals, so that he served only 89 days. #535\n\n22 Mar 15Twenty people died in the first 90 days of their service in the regiment. The earliest death was Louis Bender, who committed suicide just ten days after volunteering. The earliest death in battle was by Henry Bennett, who died at Hatcher's Run just twenty days after enlisting.

Bates' History of Pennsylvania volunteers says only that he was '[n]ot accounted for' when the 70th Pennsylvania mustered out. #532\n\n1 Mar 15John McNally (C) was discharged about three months after enlisting, 'because of lack of physical development' and because he weighed only 95 pounds. (The surgeon who approved his enlistment obviously wasn't very observant!) His certificate of discharge reported the value of the clothing he had received as this:\n\nOver coat$8.50Dress Coat 8.75Blouse 3.25Trowsers 3.102 Socks 72 ____ $24.32\n\n#531\n\n22 Feb 15Isaiah Collins's widow Barbara applied for a pension on 18 August 1869, and her application was approved on 6 June 1870. On 27 December 1869, someone wrote a letter to the pension office under the name 'P.M.', which alleged that someone named 'Smith' was reportedly drawing a pension fraudulently. This letter claimed that Barbara did not deserve a pension, because her husband's death was caused by an illness that started after his return from the army (and was therefore not caused by his service). I don't know what happened to Smith, but the Pension Office didn't do anything about the allegation about Collins until 1875, when Special Agent W H Corkhill investigated the claim, and the Pension Office discontinued her pension. On 14 March 1880, she applied for readmission, and Special Agent M E Jenks was sent to investigate. He noted a family feud between Collins' family and Barbara and her family ('the result of a law suit in the settlement of an estate'), and said that he suspected (but couldn't prove) that people weren't telling him the complete truth. (Perhaps people simply didn't want to take sides in a dispute they saw as motivated by that feud.) Despite Jenks' skepticism, Barbara Collins' pension was reinstated on 22 November 1880. #530\n\n15 Feb 15Catharine Kenney, guardian of the minor dependents of John S Haines (E), used Bigelow Wynkoop and Co. as her attorney. The good aspect of that choice is that she wasn't caught up in the fraudulent execution of documents practiced by other attorneys. The bad news is that they did very little. She initially applied on 29 February 1864, and on 20 May 1864, the Pension Office noted that she needed to provide more evidence. The next entry in the pension certificate file is 3 years later, 25 May 1867, when the Pension Office sent a letter to her attorney repeating that. Three years after that, on 23 April 1870, the Pension Office sent her a letter asking for evidence, which was provided, and her application was accepted on 7 September 1870. She was not the only person to have problems with Bigelow, Wynkoop, and Co. Catharine Vanarsdall, widow of Aaron Vanarsdall, applied for a pension on 23 August 1864, using Bigelow, Wynkoop, + Peters as her attorney. On 12 September 1867, she revoked her power of attorney to Bigelow, Wynkoop, + Co., 'as she has lost all confidence in them and doubts their ability to prosecute her claim to a successful issue'. #529\n\n8 Feb 15Surgeon Isaac D Knight experienced 'typhoid fever' in December 1862. On 23 and 25 March 1863, two brigade surgeons reported that the results of that fever indicated that Knight should be transferred out of active field service. It took only a year: he resigned effective 15 April 1864, and was appointed Assistant Surgeon of Volunteers effective 16 April 1864. (But the appointment was dated 19 January 1864; I don't know whether he knew about the appointment before then, or why he delayed accepting it if he did. Perhaps he wanted to stay with the 91st until the campaign began?) #528\n\n1 Feb 15In a slightly snippy letter dated 18 April 1864, Andrew Brown (C) explained how he spent his money:\n\nyou say I might not have been so short about the money. its [sic] not verry [sic] often I ask for money. but when I do ask for it. I want it especially when its [sic] my own[.] every time I get my clothes washed it costs me 30 cents. paper. envelopes. ink. and stamps. about 1 dollar a month and I suppose you know it cost [sic] me some thing for victuals when I was sick. and as I dont [sic] intend to starrve [sic] yet awhile it costs me some thing yet. And you know as well as I do how far two dollars would go.\n\nIn a letter dated 28 April 1864, he claimed, 'you mistake in thinking me mad about the money'. If so, the mistake was understandable.\n\n#527\n\n25 Jan 15In a letter to his mother dated 20 April 1862, Henry Mathers assured her they were having a very happy Easter Sunday, with plenty of eggnog, boiled eggs, and salt pork. #526\n\n18 Jan 15In a letter to his mother dated 28 January 1862, Henry G Mathers joked,\n\nwe have got so much drilling that it took all the laziness out of Jos. Budd\n\n#525\n\n11 Jan 15Abraham Lincoln saw Richard T McCarter (D) in the Armory Square Hospital. McCarter had refused to identify himself, thinking he would see his family soon, surprising them. However, the physician told Lincoln McCarter would die soon, and Lincoln had someone get the information from McCarter, and contact his father, who arrived the next morning. His father requested permission to take McCarter home, which the physician initially refused, believing that the trip would kill him. But his father eventually contacted Lincoln, who gave McCarter a 30-day furlough, and had McCarter released. He survived the trip (with the help of whiskey!), and was able to return to Washington at the end of the furlough--claiming that cold water had saved him (but only applied externally!). (It seems more likely that running a silver probe through the wound helped, since silver has antibacterial properties.) #524\n\n4 Jan 15Henry Mathers (E) served in the 90th Pennsylvania after being discharged from the 91st. On 26 February 1864, he wrote his mother:\n\nI do not like this Regiment as much as I did the other one. The officers seem to be down on us because we are enlisted [?]. [B]ut for my part I do not care a snap of my finger for any of them. I think that I can take care of myself without ... any of their help.\n\n(Not everyone felt as positively about the 91st; compare what William H Johnson (K) wrote his parents on 4 January 1864, while he was temporarily assigned to the 155th Pennsylvania.) #523\n\n28 Dec 14In a letter to his mother dated 20 April 1862, Henry Mathers described the shooting of Jesse Wharton and the night exercise that preceded it: This makes clear that the soldiers themselves did not realize that exercise was a drill.\n\nwe had quite a surprise last night. word came that the Rebels were marching on to Washington, when the National Guards. and two cavalry and one Artillery Regiment were ordered out[.] Our Regiment also received the same orders and off we started on a double quick for the Long Bridge expecting a fight for sure. but when we arrived there we found it was a false report. and we were greatly disappointed. but I think our boys will have a shot at the Rebels yet: One of the Rebel prisoners at the prison was shot by One of our Regiment yesterday: for not keeping his head in the window and cursing the Guard. the Ball went clean through him and lodged in the cealing [sic]: every one of them ought to be served in the same manner:\n\n#522\n\n21 Dec 14After being discharged from the 91st on disability (on 30 March 1863, Henry Mathers served in company A of the 90th Pennsylvania, and died of wounds received in battle on 18 June 1864. I mention this because his pension certificate file (now digitized on Fold3) mentions his service in the 90th, but not his service in the 91st, even though it ncludes letters from him when he was serving in the 91st. Just to make the confusion more complete, Bates' History of Pennsylania Volunteers doesn't include him in the roster of the 90th Pennsylvania. I wonder how many other pension applications from people who served in the 91st don't mention their service .... And how hard it will be to determine whether there are any. #521\n\n14 Dec 14The pension certificate file for Leopold Smith, father of Charles Smith (B), contains two interesting details. First, Charles Smith was absent without leave from 1 February 1864 through 10 March 1864. The March-April 1864 muster roll reports that he owed the US $60 for being arrested as a deserter in Philadelphia. But according to the muster-out roll, '[the] Charge of desertion [was] removed and he will be considered as Absent without leave from Feb 1\" 64 to Mar. 10\" 64 (date of arrest) and will forfeit pay + allowances for that period only'. I assume he was one of the many veterans who took an informal leave when the 91st was held in camp after returning from veterans' furlough. Second, Leopold's pension was originally approved retroactive to the date he completed his application (19 April 1870), but one year later was extended back to the date of Charles's death (1 September 1864), based on a 'late ruling'. (Leopold was also one of many people affected by his attorney's having improperly executed documents; his pension was suspended from 7 December 185 to 24 January 1876.) #520\n\n30 Nov 14One pension certificate file (recently digitized) preserves a little evidence about how bodies of men buried on the battlefield were returned to their families. William B Lambright swore 'that he went to Hatcher's Run Virginia in the month of November A.D. 1864 and disintered the body of Francis B. Corle and brought his body back to Bedford County, Pennsylvania to his wife and relatives, and that his body was buried in Union Township, Bedford County near the home of his wife immediately after his return, and that he had the body in charge from the time it was disintered in Virginia until it was buried in Bedford county, Penna'. (In the 1870 census, Lambright was not an undertaker--he worked in a grist mill.) #519\n\n23 Nov 14I find it amusing that the recruiting officer, and not the physician, was the person who swore the recruit was sober and old enough to enlist. (See for example, the volunteer enlistment form for John Brown.) #518\n\n7 Sep 14Andrew Brown (C) wrote a letter from near Cloud Mills, Virginia, on 26 August 1862, shortly after the regiment left Alexandria (on 20 August) to join the Army of the Potomac. Almost all the division had arrived, and some had already left; he expected to leave for Warrenton later that day. He wasn't able to carry everything he had accumulated in Alexandria; he sent a box by Adams Express with his old clothes and other things he couldn't carry. They did escort a wagon train on the 28th, and moved around for several weeks, eventually joining a new division on 12 September, which was sent to the Army, arriving the day after the Battle of Antietam. #517\n\n31 Aug 14Andrew Brown (C) wrote a letter from Alexandria on 16 June 1862. Alexandria was a southern town, and sympathized deeply with the Confederates, as two incidents Brown mentions show. First, people were bringing 'fries[,] cakes[,] coffee' and other things to Confederate prisoners; when they 'began to get sassy and talk for Jeff Davis', the regiment arrested two, but released them when they promised not to continue. Second, he notes that Colonel Gregory took possession of an Episcopal church when the minister refused to pray for the president and the success of the Federal army. (See 'A day in Alexandria' for a similar event involving a Baptist church.) Colonel Gregory took the church during a service. Brown adds that Company C's flag was flying from the second story of the Church, which was to be used as a hospital. #516\n\n31 Aug 14Of the 19 letters from Andrew Brown (C) in his father's pension certificate file, four complain about not getting letters. On 29 March 1862, he complains that he has written a letter every week (presumably since arriving in DC), and received only two letters from his father and sister. On 26 August 1862, he complains that he wrote the day before they left Alexandria, and hadn't received an answer. On 3 April [1863], he asks how Thomas is, saying, 'I suppose he expects me to write to him[--]if so[,] he should have answered the last letter I sent to him'. And on 7 June 1864, he writes that he has written five or six letters and received only one, adding: '[T]his is the last I intend to write till I get an answer with writing paper, envelopes, + stamps'. Fortunately, the last letter from him, dated 17 June 1864, just two days before he died, doesn't include any complaints. #515\n\n24 Aug 14For an illustration of Civil War era record keeping, consider William H Knouse (F). First, he was discharged from Auger General Hospital, in accordance with general orders 77. But the discharge notice somehow was addressed to (or at least received by) company B instead of company F. On their muster-out rolls, company B reported him discharged (despite having no other record of him), and company F reported him absent sick, in hospital. Because of this, the published roster (in Bates History of Pennsylvania volunteers) adds a William H Knous serving in company B. (The Adjutant General's Office apparently fixed the mistake, in 1883, perhaps because Knouse had applied for a pension.) Second, the company F muster-out roll, followed by Bates, reports him as enlisted on 24 February 1865--but the enlistment paperwork clearly reports him enlisted and mustered in on 24 March 1865. Third, the company B muster-out roll, presumably based on the discharge, reports him as drafted, but the rest of the records call him a substitute. I will continue to try clearing up these mistakes. #514\n\n17 Aug 14Andrew Brown (C) wrote a letter dated 14 April 1862, from Washington DC, in which he notes they were encamped on Carroll Hill (owned by a granddaughter of Charles Carroll, who signed the Declaration of Independence). (I had information that companies A, B, and F were stationed in the Carroll [Hill] Barracks.) Two other interesting bits of information: sending $45 by Adams Express cost 25 cents, and the regiment (or at least his company?) was paid on 13 April. #513\n\n10 Aug 14On 14 February 1863, Andrew Brown wrote a letter to his father and sister, from the regiment's camp, near Falmouth, Virginia (where the regiment had camped since the end of Burnside's Mud March, at the end of January 1863). The food was good; they had fresh bread four times a week, onions and potatoes twice a week, and good coffee, but hadn't had tea since they left Warrenton, Virginia. (Is he referring to the regiment's brief stay at Warrenton on their way to Falmouth, on 30 October 1862?) They had 'a fine log house built with a large fire place in it', which was comfortable and warm. The other news is that he had heard a rumor that Colonel Gregory had been appointed military governor of Alexandria, which was (we know now) false. #512\n\n3 Aug 14Wharton's resignation was forced by a report by the 7th Infantry Adjutant, which led the commander to offer him a choice between resignation or facing a third court martial:\n\n'I have the honor to state that 2nd Lt. Jesse B. Wharton 7th inf (now under suspension) has from all accounts, since his release from arrest, kept himself in a filthy condition, associating with enlisted men in the town of Fairfield, and drinking in public bars with soldiers, when permitted by them to do so. that he has frequently attempted to drink with non-commissioned officers, and that they as well as soldiers have publicly refused to drink with him. that he has after all this appeared publicly in front of the Regiment, while on parade, and that he is now lying in a set of Quarters built for the use of officers on duty with the Regiment, in a state of beastly intoxication. that it is reported that lately he has been begging his meals in Fairfield, and has even come to the Company Kitchen of Company K 7 infantry, and begged for victuals. that he made his bed in Fairfield, wherever chance would place it, and slept for the most part on benches, and in the alleys and corners about town.\n\n'His conduct, disgraceful as it is, fails to awaken in him the blush of shame, and he returns now to again attempt association with those, whom as a class he has dishonored, by appearing in public with the uniform of an honorable profession.'\n\n#511\n\n27 Jul 14In his memoirs, the father-in-law of Jesse Wharton describes him as irresponsible, inconsiderate (e.g. never writing to his wife), unable to resist temptation, and uninterested in and incapable of reflection, even when sober. Perhaps his being unreflective helps explain his unwillingness to obey the prison rules, and his daring the guard to shoot him (after the guard had been ordered to shoot him if he again broke the rules). #510\n\n20 Jul 14On 3 May 1863, Andrew Brown was wounded in action. In a letter dated 31 May 1863, written at the Fifth Corps Hospital, he mentions having 'poor attendance and very little to eat except what we have to buy'. They were fed pork potatoes and sour bread; two men had visited him the day he wrote, bringin him jellies and other delicacies. He was hoping for a furlough (and someone from the Sanitary Commission had promised to try getting him one), but hadn't received it yet. But he apparently did receive it; on the May-June 1863 muster roll, he was reported a paroled prisoner, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. #509\n\n13 Jul 14In a letter dated 4 August 1862, Andrew Brown wrote that the 91st was 'one of the best drilled regiments in the service', and that General Wadsworth (commanding the military defenses of Washington) 'says we give more satisfaction than any regiment he has had yet'. He concludes that they probably wouldn't leave Alexandria 'for some time if at all'. In fact, they left Alexandria on 20 August 1862. I don't know whether that's because Wadsworth was less impressed with them than Brown believed, or because Wadsworth's superiors were also impressed with them!b(They were initially assigned to the Second Division of the Fifth Corps, Army of the Potomac, but then apparently were transferred to the Third Division on 12 September 1862; see A A Humphrey's statement about the division's formation and arrival at Antietam.) #508\n\n6 Jul 14In a letter dated 5 May 1862, Andrew Brown warned his father and sister that a former quartermaster sergeant from the regiment was fraudulently collecting money and goods from families in Philadelphia, promising to send it to the men, but not delivering it. He even asked for money from the family of a man who died in Alexandria, to pay for sending his body back to Philadelphia, and disappeared with the money they gave him. I have not been able to identify this quartermaster sergeant. #507\n\n29 June 14In a letter dated 29 March 1862, Andrew Brown (C) said they had all 'received a new pair of light blue pants', and were 'going to get new Belgian rifles'. A week and a half later, their Enfield rifles were pronounced 'unserviceable and unsafe' at an inspection. General Wadsworth requested new arms for them a week after that, and they finally received new weapons almost a month after Brown's letter, on 24 April 1862. (But they were issued US Rifles, made at the Springfield armory.) Does Brown's letter suggest that the inspection was part of a plan to get them new weapons? Or was his report based on a rumor or statement that was only coincidentally true? #506\n\n22 June 14The index to the compiled service records has four entries beginning 'Jh'. Four of the six are from company F of the 91st, all for the family name 'Jhonson'. (The other two are from the 179th Pennsylvania, and seem to involve misreading 'Shay' as 'Jhay'.) Perhaps someone in company F was dyslexic. #505\n\n15 June 14On 12 September 1862, Lieutenant Justus A Gregory, who was the 91st's Recruiting Officer in Philadelphia, enlisted Thomas Brooks. Because Brooks was less then twenty one, regulations required permission of a guardian. So, Gregory was appointed Brooks's guardian by the Philadelphia Orphans Court, and gave permission. #504\n\n8 June 14Thomas B Scott (F&S) worked as a clerk in a dry good store before the war. His employer later testified that he received $1.50 per day ('or whatever the regular wages were at that time'). His wages were the major family income after his father's death in 1857; the rent for their small house was $12 per month. His sister testified that he had been unemployed for a little while before enlisting. (After his death in 1866, his mother received a pension of $8 per month.) #503\n\n1 June 14Benjamin Shriner (A) wrote a letter to his wife on 7 May 1865. He was in Campbell Hospital, Washington DC, because of diarrhea. He said he was getting better--but he also said hardly felt able to write. He asked her to write to him (or to have others write) four times in this very brief letter. He died on 5 June, of meningitis. The Chaplain claimed Shriner's worrying about his discharge 'worked so upon his mind that he became sick night before last', went into convulsions, and never recovered. The official cause of death seems more plausible: meningitis. (He was officially discharged on 2 June, but the discharge is crossed out in the company descriptive roll, and may never have taken effect.) #502\n\n25 May 14E Banker was matron of the 91st's hospital from 28 December 1861 through 28 February 1862, when she 'Withdrew with consent' from being matron. As matron, she may have supervised the nurses. #501\n\n11 May 14William W Burns first enlisted in the 91st on 2 February 1864, as a veteran volunteer. He was entitled to enlist as a veteran because of his prior service in the Navy; see general orders, number 216, 14 July 1863, Washington DC, Adjutant General's Office. This order apparently changed section II of general orders, number 191, by requiring that the men have been honorably discharged, by making explicit that the men could enlist in any regiment they chose and that they were entitled to all the benefits provided by general order 191, and by requiring that a unit would be called 'veteran' only if at least one-half its members were veteran volunteers when the unit was mustered in. #500\n\n4 May 14William W Burns's pension file includes notes from the surgeon. On 18 June 1864, a Minié ball struck his right arm, severely affecting his hand. Several fingers were amputated in the field, but when he arrived at the Satterlee USA General Hospital a month later, the wound was sloughing, and appeared unhealthy. On 1 August the surgeon amputated the lower third of his forearm; he was under aether and chloroform. The stump continued to be swollen and painful for several months. Eventually, they amputated a bit more, just above the elbow. (What struck me most about the notes was how minimal they were. I hope they were selected, and not the complete notes, but even so they were very scanty.) #499\n\n20 Apr 14James Banni (B) is an example of a difficulty in deciding who served in the regiment. According to his compiled service record, he enlisted on 3 May 1862, and deserted on 8 May 1862. The record also claims: 'This name should not have appeared on this Roll' (sc. the May-June 1862 muster roll). Why? Perhaps because there was '[n]o evidence of muster in'. I've added him to my statistics, because he is on one of the muster rolls--but whether he should be included isn't at all obvious. #498\n\n13 Apr 14Of the forty (40) men I currently know were not willing to reenlist in the regiment, four (4) died before being discharged, all from wounds received in battle:\n\nMichael Kane (K), on 8 May 1864\n\nMichael Drew (C), on 23 May 1864\n\nWilliam H Johnson (K), on 18 June 1864\n\nWilliam T Hooven (C), on 19 June 1864\n\n(45 of the 271 veterans (17%) died while in service.) #497\n\n6 Apr 14According to Bates, James Dyson deserted at Sharpburg, Virginia. Bates' report was based on the muster-out roll. However, his compiled service record makes clear that starting with the September-October 1862 muster roll, he was '[a]bsent with leave of Surgeon', which is striking since he enlisted on 18 September 1862, and that he was discharged from the Army because of phthisis pulmonalis on 15 December 1863. (I haven't finished adding the information from the compiled service record.) This makes me worry that the published information in Bates is even less reliable than I thought it was; getting the compiled service records for all men who served in the 91st is unrealistic, but perhaps I need to purchase more than I had intended to. #496\n\n30 Mar 14In 1862, ten of the 91st's commissioned officers left the regiment. Three were discharged because of disability (Edward J Phillips on 4 March 1862--the first officer to leave; Ansel Hamburg, and Albert Fetter, and apparently Peter D Keyser, and James E Sulger). Charles S Brown resigned (the day after Edward J Phillips was discharged, on 5 March 1862). Alpheus H Bowman was dismissed (but was reappointed in December). Charles Houghton was promoted to surgeon of a different regiment. And two (George W Murphy, and George W Todd) died because of wounds received at the Battle of Fredericksburg. #495\n\n23 Mar 14The index to the compiled service records is providing more information than I had expected. For example, Patrick Condon apparently was transferred from the 118th Pennsylvania. And I have combined William and James James Carpenter (B), and also Thomas and Joseph Allison (E) based on the cards. And I already have thirteen (!) new names, who may be additional people who served in the 91st. I will keep sending for more compiled service records, and hope to have a much more accurate idea of the number of men who served in the regiment by the end of this year. #494\n\n16 Mar 14William C Reiff (H) wrote a brief note to the National Tribune about George Black, which adds one striking fact about Black, which makes more vivid Black's youth: 'Black and his drum were nearly of equal size'. #493\n\n9 Mar 14 Samuel C Austin was a brass turner when he enlisted, and continued working with brass until he died. He served in company A of the 91st, whose first death occurred on 13 April 1862, when Gustavus1 Bernstein died of typhoid fever. The company and hospital were apparently not completely clear about how to handle the death, since Bernstein's death certificate is signed by 'Corporal Saml C Austin' (followed by 'M.D.', as printed on the form). Perhaps the Philadelphia Health Office wasn't sure either; in any event, they accepted the death certificate. #492\n\n2 Mar 14Several of the \"problem\" men have become clearer. At least two men reported in some records as having served in the 91st and transferred to another regiment were actually only temporarily assigned to duty with the 91st: Andrew G George (I), and Edward J Doolittle (B). Doolittle's compiled service record (which I'm currently transcribing) refers to an order of General Wadsworth's, dated 15 April 1862, temporarily attaching Doolittle to the 91st; I am trying to get a copy of that order, hoping for some explanation of the temporary transfer. Amusingly, Bates' list of men who served in the 91st includes George (but under the name 'George Andrews') but not Doolittle, and the pension index cards mention Doolittle's service in the 91st but not George's <sigh>. Perhaps working through the 3,313 cards in the index to the compiled service records will give us more accurate information about who served in the 91st. #491\n\n23 Feb 14Here's another small piece of information about the 91st's Survivors' association. At their 1886 meeting, they re-elected A. D. W. Caldwell as secretary, and Matthew Hall as treasurer. Eli Sellers was elected president, and Joseph H. Sinex vice-president (as in 1884; I don't know whether that was true in 1885). #490\n\n16 Feb 14A letter dated 1 March 1862, from James Todd to his mother, makes vivid how close Confederate forces were to Washington DC (where the 91st was stationed). He was 'out all week'--presumably on picket duty, though he doesn't say that. But he was ten miles away from DC, on Alliton [sc. Arlington?] Heights, and 'could see Bulls Run from the hill--thirty thousand rebels [were] there'. He said the talk was that the war would last two years, and that he could hear cannon from a nearby battle, as he was writing. (The Second Battle of Bull Run was fought on 28-30 August 1862.)\n\n(By the way, if anyone has suggestions to improve my attempts to make sense of Todd's letters, please let me know!)\n\n#489\n\n9 Feb 14In a letter to his mother from Fairfax Court House, James Todd expresses regret that he didn't see any fighting when he was at Richmond, because, he thought, the 91st wasn't going to be involved in any fighting, and explains that by saying that 'through inspection we lost 4 hundred men that weren[']t fit for duty'. The two bits of relatively early data I have don't seem to fit here:\n\nThe 91st's weapons were initially deficient, but they received good rifle muskets on 24 April 1862. (See Problems with the Justice arms ... for more details.)\n\nIn the only inspection report I have seen from the 91st's service in the Defenses of Washington, from 19 April 1862, the 91st had 560 men assemble at the Long Bridge, armed with muskets (before they received the rifled muskets), and sufficient ammunition--compared to the 10th New Jersey, with 180 men and no ammunition, and the 2nd DC, with 600 men and 35 rounds of ammunition. Why only 560 men? The best guess I have is that 810 (to 889) men were still officially in the regiment then, though some were undoubtedly ill or detailed on special duty away from the regiment. And undoubtedly some had to be left on guard at prisons (including the Old capitol prison and the Central guard house) or elsewhere.\n\nMy best guess is that Todd is referring to a later inspection, to which I haven't seen any other references. #488\n\n2 Feb 14On 1 March 1862, James Allen Todd wrote his mother a letter, in which he talks about food. He was able to get strawberries, cherries, grain, and anything he wanted. But the crackers were so hard that they had to soak them in water for a week, pound them with a sledge hammer, and then boil them! #487\n\n26 Jan 14On 19 December 1862, James Allen Todd wrote a letter to his mother. He missed the Battle of Fredricksburg (on 13 December 1862) because he was ill--with 'the heart Disease [and] yellow Jaunders [sc. jaundice]', and was so weak he couldn't move. But he noted that the regiment list 111 men, that his company (I) had six men killed and more wounded, and that he 'lost' both his tentmates. (The six men killed in company I were W H Baumgardner, Newton Collins, Elias Leaver, John McGilley, George W Murphy, and Richard Rogers.) #486\n\n19 Jan 14Mary Largay's pension application (as widow of Henry P Largay (I)) has two interesting features. First, they were married on 14 October 1864, after he returned from the army. The Pension Bureau accepted the testimony of Mary and two others that they had lived as man and wife for many years (at least as long as their children had been alive). The application doesn't allege that they had contracted a valid common law marriage, and I'm not confident from the testimony that they had--Mary didn't say anything about expressing in words of the present tense a present intention to be married, and although the neighbors testified that Mary and Henry had 'lived and cohabited together as husband and wife and said children were known as their offspring', they didn't testify that they were generally recognized as married. Second, Lieutenants John S Donnell and Adam H Murphy both testified that Henry insisted on continuing on active duty even though he should have been in a hospital and was obvious unfit for duty. Donnell assigned him the lightest possible duty, but they let him stay with the regiment until his term expired. Again, the Pension Bureau accepted their testimony, and did not hold the absence of medical records during his service against the application. #485\n\n12 Jan 14On 4 June 1862, William H Johnson wrote a letter to his parents describing an exciting night. He was on guard at the slave pen, in Alexandria. An engineer came with 'something from from Colonel Geary', which Johnson set a guard over. (Alas, he doesn't mention what it was.) And Colonel Gregory heard that the Confederates were attacking General Banks--perhaps this was the First Battle of Winchester on 25 May 1862. Gregory had railroad cars prepared for reinforcements, and Johnson sent guards to protect the railroad for three miles. But the reinforcements didn't arrive until the next day. (Perhaps his describing this in detail makes clear how boring guard duty could be!) #484\n\n5 Jan 14William H Johnson wrote a letter to his parents on 11 February 1862, from Camp Stanton, near Washington DC. He complained about the weather (daily rain or snow, with mud deeper than his shoes), but did note that he had finished a home improvement project, taking boards from a deserted house and flooring his tent, giving them 'about as comfortable a tent as is on the Camp grounds'. The point he found most noteworthy about their upcoming provost duty in DC was that 'each man is to be furnished with two pair of white gloves and any man found drunk with his cloths [sic] dirty will be put in the guard house'. #483\n\n29 Dec 13William H Johnson did not reenlist, and was therefore transferred to the 155th Pennsylvania while the men who did reenlist were on furlough. He wrote a letter to his parents on 4 January 1864, which mentions that Colonel Gregory told them he was going to try to get them back. He did; perhaps that wasn't part of the original plan. He also says that he was happy not to be part of the 91st; although he doesn't explain why, he does say that 'we have good officers now and the men [are] all willing to do what is right as long as they are treated right'. #482\n\n22 Dec 13William Cloud wrote a letter describing William Henry Johnson's death on 18 June 1864 in this way:\n\nIt was on the morning of June the 18th about 11 o'clock that we were ordered to charge the Rebel lines around the City of Petersburg. we succeeded in getting posession [sic] of the Norfolk + Petersburg Rail Road on the bank of which we came to a halt about three hundred yards from the Rebel line of fortifications. this was a very poor position. As we were exposed to a very destructive flank fire from the enemy. After we had been in this position about an hour. we were once more ordered to move forward. and fast as we raised ourselves your son William who was right beside me. was struck with a Minnie [sic] Rifle Bullet in the right Temple. he lived about five minutes but he was insensible from the time that he was struck.\n\nHe then apologizes for their not having been able to bury him immediately, or to find and mark his grave later. #481\n\n15 Dec 13George Borlan (D) died of inflammation of the liver on 2 April 1864. His widow applied for a pension. Although she made the declaration on 4 May 1864, her attorney, W N Ashman, did not file it until 10 October 1864, after their child was born on 3 September 1864. Almost five years after she made the declaration, she switched attorneys, and two-and-a-half months later her application was accepted. This is not the first time I have seen Ashman's clients have problems; in particular, Alexander Earnest's widow attributed an error to 'the carelessness and loose way of doing business at the office of the Sanitary Commission'. #480\n\n8 Dec 13William Bibby enrolled in the 91st under the alias 'James Clark'. The evidence points strongly to his having served earlier in the 6th New Jersey infantry (under his legal name), from which he apparently deserted in 1863. Although he didn't mention this prior service in his pension applications, the 1890 census veterans schedules list him as having served in the 6th New Jersey. The Act of 1 July 1902 makes explicit that honorable discharge from the last service was enough (under certain conditions--see section 2). But the fact that Congress passed that law then suggests that prior to 1902 his having deserted from the 6th New Jersey might have cause problems for his pension claim. Perhaps that is why he did not mention it. His having omitted his prior service was apparently never caught. I've read that the Pension Bureau largely ignored the 1890 veterans schedules; perhaps Bibby was fortunate they did. #479\n\n1 Dec 13Another small bit of evidence about post-war connections between men who served in the 91st: Lieutenant-Colonel Eli G Sellers had a son born about 1865/1866, whom he named Howard Shipley Sellers, obviously after First Lieutenant Howard Shipley. #478\n\n24 Nov 13Several members of the 91st were involved in a controversy in 1892 in the E D Baker Post 8 of the Grand Army of the Republic. The combination of a controversial election and 'court martial charges preferred against certain prominent comrades' led some men to withdraw from the post, including Eli Sellers. Thomas F Walters claimed, however, that the Post was in excellent shape at the beginning of 1893. In June 1893 they apparently had 670 members, down from a high of 800. (See 'Indignant G.A.R. men', 'Baker Post's affairs', and 'Baker Post services'.) #477\n\n17 Nov 13Charles Bournonville was born to a wealthy physician, and grew up with multiple servants in the household. He was 18 when he joined the 91st PA in August 1861, and was discharged in February 1863 because of hemorrhoids. He spent the rest of his life in the western US, living in Wyoming Territory, Dakota Territory, and Montana. He supposedly received a bequest when his relative, the Marquis Leonard Charles de Bournonville, died in 1892, but his obituary suggests it 'was soon dissipated and it was probably only a small sum'. He worked as a cook after losing a cigar factory. His pension application was not approved--the reference in his obituary to dissipation may suggest that he would have had problems proving his disability was not due to his 'own vicious habits' (which even the Act of 27 June 1890 required, in section 2). His poverty, and perhaps dissolution, stands in marked contrast to his sibling's lives; they owned tens of thousands of dollars of property, and had multiple servants. Perhaps he is another, unrecognized, casualty of the war. #476\n\n10 Nov 13Charles T Cotton evaluated many pension applications by members of the 91st Pennsylvania and their families. He was born in Mississippi, traveled as far as Havana and New Hampshire, lived in St Paul, and eventually moved to Washington DC, where he worked as a clerk in the Pension Bureau from 1863 through his death in 1877. #475\n\n3 Nov 13Charles W Houghton served as Assistant Surgeon of the 91st from 21 October 1861 through 11 September 1862, and then as Surgeon of several regiments, until 21 March 1866. Charles Hebding (A) seems to have trusted him, since Houghton was apparently the physician for his daughter Anna (and signed her death certificate on 7 October 1871). #474\n\n27 Oct 13The Veterans' administration pension payment cards 1907-1933 (now available at FamilySearch) give us more detail about the men's pensions. For example, here is the history of John Blum (K)'s pension. His initial pension was based on the original pension act, which required some disability. But through 1921 he received the minimum pension based on his age and service; starting 27 December 1921 he was apparently 'by reason of age and physical or mental disabilities, helpless or blind, or so nearly helpless or blind as to require the regular personal aid and attendance of another person'.\n\napplication dateAct of ... certificate issuedrateeffective date apparent basis5 May 1884 14 Jul 1862 (?) ? ? ? 1 Mar 1907 6 Feb 1907 2 Oct 1907 $15 1 Mar 1907 age 70-74? $20 4 Dec 1909 age at least 75? 11 May 1912 20 Feb 1913 $30 31 May 1912 age at least 75 and served at least 2 years? $40 10 Jun 1918 ?? 1 May 1920 $50 1 May 1920 served 90 days? $72 27 Dec 1921 helpless or blind (or nearly)\n\n#473\n\n20 Oct 13At least three men who served in the 91st have pages on Wikipedia:\n\nJoseph T Jones (H) (Wikipedia)\n\nPeter D Keyser (C) (Wikipedia)\n\nWilliam J Kirkpatrick (F&S) (Wikipedia)\n\nSurprisingly, Edgar M Gregory does not have a page (as far as I can tell), despite his arguably being historically more important than the others, as the Assistant Commissioner of the Freedman's Bureau for Texas (1865-6), fired at President Johnson's orders, and of Maryland (1866-8). #472\n\n13 Oct 13Patrick Cahill's dependent's pension certificate file provides more evidence about the 1860's economy. His family's landlord testified that before enlisting Patrick 'worked at light laboring work and earned from five to six dollars per week', paying him rent of $2 per month. #471\n\n6 Oct 13Bates' summary of William Carson's service says only that he was wounded on 18 June 1864, and was absent, in hospital, when the regiment mustered out, on 10 July 1865. This brief, anodyne, statement conceals what was probably an immense amount of pain and suffering. If I've identified the right William Carson, he died on 30 January 1888, of a 'heart clot following amputation'. Since he successfully applied for a pension in 1865 (and his mother successfully applied after his death), he must have been injured in the war. He, then, seems to have been a long-term casualty of the war, probably having had a limb amputated after being injured on that terrible day that saw almost a third of the members of the 91st killed or wounded, and dying of that wound several decades later. (See Walter's and an anonymous account of that day.) (The pension certificate file presumably would confirm or disconfirm this interpretation of the evidence.) #470\n\n29 Sep 13In 1863, Benjamin Eyre and John Edgar Jr registered for the draft (along, no doubt, with many other men who had served in the 91st). The registration record mentions his service in the 91st. As far as I can see, the original draft act, the act of 3 March 1863, does not excuse people because they had served (though section 6 of the act of 24 February 1864 does require the boards of enrolment to enroll 'all persons discharged from the military or naval service of the United States who have not been in such service two years during the present war'). So I don't know why the Provost Marshall was tracking prior service in July 1863. (Edgar was actually still serving, though was discharged on surgeon's certificate of disability in February 1863. The draft registration record does not differentiate their service, however.) #469\n\n22 Sep 13The known causes of death after the war include many cardiovascular diseases, infections, cancers, etc., but also debility after debauch, accidental injuries (e.g., 'frac base of skull due to acdl fall on pavement', 'run down by automobile', 'injuries recd by a fall down stairs'), and my favorite: 'no doctor in charge'. The most commonly listed was phthisis pulmonalis, that is, tuberculosis of the lungs (though other conditions might rank higher if different names for the same cause were grouped together). While looking at these causes of death, I found an explanation of George B Kenworthy's: he was caught between the bumpers of two train cars while trying to pass between them. It was in the evening. Perhaps he was impatient to return home, and instead of waiting for the train to pass, tried to pass through the train. A sad end for someone who had passed through a war. #468\n\n8 Sep 13Members of the Humane Hose Company were invited to the funerals of at least three men who served in the 91st: Captain James Sulger, William Carpenter, and William McNally. Interestingly, all three served in company C. #467\n\n1 Sep 13After the war, Captain Charles Henry (H) described John Brown (H) in this way: 'he was a good soldier[,] a quiet man[,] always correct and prompt in the performance of his duties and a man in whom perfect confidence could be placed'. #466\n\n25 Aug 13According to his mother's pension certificate file, before he enlisted, Michael Drew (C) earned about $15 per week, and sent some to his mother for support. If this is true, it wasn't enough; as far as I can tell, Michael's parents were in the Alms House in 1860. (The other glassblower whose pre-war wages I have evidence of, Robert Simpson (A), earned $20 to $25 per week; I don't know why Michael earned so much less.) #465\n\n18 Aug 13One more note about John N Hawks (D). His divorced ex-wife, Susan Wilson, claimed that their daughter Annie was disabled 'by reason of an accident or injury inflicted by her father John N Hawks when she was an infant'. But Enos E Palmer, a physician, swore that she had Pott's disease of the 5th and 6th dorsal vertebrae (also affecting her breast), that she had been in Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago for a year, and that the curvature was constantly increasing. I wonder whether Susan knew that, and whether knowing it would have made any difference to their divorce. #464\n\n11 Aug 13Since John Hawks' children weren't eligible for a pension, even though his widow was, I wondered when the widow's right would descend to the children. The evidence is clear: with very few exceptions, the pension acts (at least those I have so far transcribed) do not allow anyone to receive a pension if a living widow is ineligible. The three exceptions I have found involve these cases:\n\nwidows who participated in the rebellion (Act of 14 July 1862 §4)\n\nremarried widows (e.g., Act of 3 March 1865 §4; Act of 25 July 1866 §4)\n\nwidows who abandoned the care of the children, or were 'unsuitable ... by reason of immoral conduct to have the custody' of the children (Act of 6 June 1866 §11; Act of 25 July 1866 §2; Act of 27 July 1868 §8)\n\nInteresting, even the Act of 9 May 1900 (amending the act of 27 June 1890) makes no provisions for ineligible widows. Perhaps this happened rarely enough that special acts of Congress were a reasonable way of dealing with the problem. #463\n\n4 Aug 13Samuel Hawks and his brother, John N Hawks, both served in company D, but John used the alias 'James Clark'. Charles Beaver (D) later recalled: 'I often wondered how one was named Clark and the other Hawks[;] someone said that they were step brothers'. John enlisted on 24 December 1861, and Samuel enlisted several weeks later, on 9 January 1862. I wonder if John regretted enlisting under an alias after Samuel enlisted! (And how he reacted when he learned that Samuel was going to enlist or had enlisted.) #462\n\n28 Jul 13The pension certificate file for John N Hawks (from which I have not yet finished abstracting data, unfortunately) reveals a sad story. Hawks married Susan Currie on 29 December 1881, and they had three children, two of whom survived. They were divorced in 1891, and both remarried later that year, with Susan retaining custody of their children. When Hawks died in 1894, both his widow Fanny and his ex-wife Susan (as guardian of his children) applied for a pension. Unfortunately for Fanny, she was not eligible under the Act of 27 June 1890, which did not require the death to be caused by military service, because they were not married when the act passed (see section 3). And since the death was (apparently) not caused by Hawks's service, she was not eligible under the Act of 14 July 1862. Unfortunately for his children, although they were entitled to a supplemental pension under the Act of 27 June 1890, their claim was rejected because there was no widow's pension to which it could be attached. So, although if Hawks had died without a widow, the children would have been entitled to a full pension, and if he had died with an eligible widow, they would have been eligible for a supplemental pension, their pension claim was rejected. As far as I have been able to determine, Congress never considered passing a special act to give them a pension. #461\n\n21 Jul 13I realized that last week's Fact of the Week might have been misleading, since the pension data included failed applications. Revised data is slightly different. In particular, 54 of the 1112 (5%) successful applications were filed in or after 1900--slightly lower than the 69 of 1227 (6%) total applications. Still, that suggests that if no pension application was ever filed based on someone's service (assuming he served at least ninety days and was discharged honorably), there may be a 5% chance that he was still alive in 1900--higher than I would have guessed. #460\n\n14 Jul 13The first year someone applied for a pension based on the soldiers' service includes several interesting bits of data. First, 1890 and 1891 are two of the top three years (286 applications), as expected, since the Act of 27 June 1890 greatly expanded pension eligibility. Second, the other three of the top five years are 1863-1865 (225 applications), presumably because proving that the injury or death was service related was easiest if the disability or death occurred immediately. Third, many people assume that anyone who hadn't applied for a pension by shortly after 1890, and had served at least ninety days and been discharged honorably, probably died by shortly after 1890. That may be a bit less safe than I had assumed--69 of the first pension applications were filed in or after 1900 (6% of the 1227 applications). The last was filed on 16 April 1931, by the widow of William H Laporte (A)--unsuccessfully, since he ended as a deserter. But the next-to-last was successful, and was filed on 9 December 1926, by the widow of Alpheus H Bowman (B). #459\n\n7 Jul 13Of the 433 people I have located in the 1850 census, 179 (41%) were reported as having attended school in the last year. Of the 554 people I have located in the 1860 census, 85 (15%) were reported as having attended school in the last year. I suspect the percentages are this low because often identifying soldiers is easier when they are older (for example, because I know their spouse's name or their occupation). (See School attendance, in 1850 and 1860.) #458\n\n30 Jun 13Mary M Conrad, mother of William Conrad (F), applied for a pension on 19 October 1865, but it was not approved until 1 December 1868. The Pension Office repeatedly sent circulars 2 and 9 to her attorney, apparently because they were not willing to accept the evidence she provided that he died of a wound received in battle. Why isn't completely clear to me--the company muster roll for January to February 1865 reports him killed, and two soldiers in company F swore (in June 1867) that he died of a wound received in battle. (She reported that she could not get a commissioned officer's certificate, and asked that their affidavits be accepted, but they apparently were not, though the pension certificate file does not report why.) Eventually, in September 1868, Lieutenant Edwin Hause (F) swore that he died of a gunshot wound received in battle in the line of duty, and her pension application was approved shortly thereafter. The certificate file does not record that the Pension Office asked the Adjutant General to confirm that Edwin Hause was with the regiment then (as they did in other cases); apparently the mere existence of a statement was enough to satisfy the examining clerk. Perhaps the clerk, L Holtzlander, was more bureauocratic than the other clerk (Charles T Cotton)--or perhaps the pension office procedures changed over time. #457\n\n23 Jun 13Amazingly, Meriners Bancker (C) also volunteered for the Spanish-American War! He served in company I of the 71st New York Infantry; he enlisted on 9 May 1898, and was discharged on 15 November 1898. #456\n\n16 Jun 13Jesse Wharton and the South's \"culture of honor\". When I started writing these summaries of Wharton, I thought I would easily find evidence that Wharton was part of the \"culture of honor\". I still think he may well have been, but the evidence isn't as clear as I would have liked. He clearly did not obey orders when he was in the Army and when he was ordered to stay away from the window in Old Capitol Prison. Whether that disobedience was due to the culture he grew up in, or to some other reason, is unfortunately less clear. #455\n\n9 Jun 13Jesse Wharton and the South's \"culture of honor\". In the end Wharton was arrested as a spy, and held in Washington's Old Capital Prison. The evidence I've seen doesn't prove he was a spy, though he certainly was acting suspiciously. But, unsurprisingly, he seems to have chafed under the prison's rules. In particular, one rule forbade prisoners standing near windows (or at least forbade them putting their head out of the window), to prevent their communicating with passers by. The guard warned Wharton to stop violating that rule, and the corporal of the guard ordered him to shoot Wharton if he violated it again. He apparently didn't believe the threat, and was unwilling to obey the rule. Exactly what happened isn't clear from the inconsistent evidence available, but he did violate the rule again, and was shot fatally. (summary next week) #454\n\n2 Jun 13Jesse Wharton and the South's \"culture of honor\". Wharton was tried in October 1858, found guilty, and sentenced to be cashiered (dishonorably discharged). But the Secretary of War mitigated the sentence to suspension from rank and pay for twelve months. During that year, Wharton was involved in an altercation, for which he was tried in July 1859. His response is striking: he objected to the trial, claiming that since he was suspended by order of the President, and was not living in Camp, he was not under the orders of the Post Commander, and could only be tried by order of the President. (He also said that he 'had been for some time looking out for an opportunity to leave the Territory', and objected not because he was afraid of the trial, but because of the delay it would cause in his departure.) Unsurprisingly, the Court rejected that claim. But they were more sympathetic in the end, finding him not guilty of all charges and specifications. From the transcripts of his trial and the trial of the other person involved, it's not obvious that Wharton was responsible for the altercation. But his denial that he was obligated to obey orders is striking.(More coming.) #453\n\n26 May 13Jesse Wharton may have characteristically had problems obeying orders. At least, his first trial (by court martial) was (in part) for disobeying orders. Major Whiting ordered him to supervise the lead detachment of his company, because the men had not cut a path properly the day before. Wharton apparently rode ahead of the company to see where the road should cross a hill. Wharton then apparently became drunk, and Major Whiting arrested him. (If I've identified the people properly, Wharton later married Whiting's daughter Susan Whiting.) On further reflection, I wonder whether Wharton thought he was displaying initiative--perhaps this incident reflects poor judgment rather than a disinclination to obey orders. #452\n\n19 May 13Jesse Wharton was the prisoner killed by the 91st in Old Capitol Prison. I think understanding him as part of the South's \"culture of honor\" (accessed 18 May 2013) helps make sense of his actions. Start with the one incident I've found reported while he was at St Timothy's Academy. All the students were punished after a few killed some chickens, allowed them to spoil, and paraded them around the school. The students rebelled at the injustice, camping in a nearby wood, having taken guns from the school armory. Wharton's father (among others) spoke with the boys, and Jessie Wharton replied to him. Unfortunately, I don't know anything further about the incident, but it seems to fit with a culture where violent response to perceived violations of rights was the norm. (More over the next several weeks.) #451\n\n12 May 13George Black was 12 years old when he enlisted as a drummer. Despite his youth, he charged up Mary's Heights in Fredericksburg with the regiment, and (according to William Reiff) prevented the Union forces from stampeding 'by placing his horse midway of the road and firing shot after shot into the head of the retreating column'. Reiff's descendant Susan Stickles recently sent a picture of George Black, which makes very vivid just how young he was. #450\n\n5 May 13A letter from Joseph T Jones (H) to William C Reiff (H) on 2 July 1910 makes clear Jones's opinion of Roosevelt:\n\nI have no use for Roosevelt or any other demagogue like him and I believe he is the greatest newspaper agent that ever occupied the Presidential chair. He brought on a panic and has injured thousands of men. He is now back in this country and I am afraid of his influence. The first thing he has recommended in politics was the change of the laws for primaries in this state and he and Governor Hughes, Taft and Root all recommended the change and they all have been defeated and I am glad of it. I am as good a Republican as I ever was but I do not like demagogues and men preaching to the galleries and thoughtless masses and bringing panics on the country. We all want a chance to live and be prosperous and take good care of our families. I am afraid that this fall the Republican party will be defeated. Some of the head officers in the party ought to retire and Roosevelt is one of them. I think Mr. Taft is an honest man but weak and vaccilating with too many schemes which are impracticable and I fear it will cause the defeat of the Republican party.\n\n#449\n\n28 Apr 13Some pension applications mentioned pre-war wages as part of the evidence establishing dependence on the deceased soldier. I'm not sure how much we can learn from this, because we don't know how many hours the soldier worked, or (I suspect) what his status was (e.g., whether he was an apprentice). Some of the wages make sense; for example, the highest-paid man of the fourteen I so far have evidence about was a glassblower, who (reportedly) earned $20 to $25 per week. The most surprising to me was that the two machinists (reportedly) earned $2.50 to $3.00 and $6.00 per week respectively. Perhaps this suggests that machinists were less skilled than I had assumed. #448\n\n21 Apr 13Catharine McNulty, mother of Bernard (\"Barney\") McNulty, received her pension extraordinarily quickly. McNulty died on 18 June 1864, she applied for a pension on 11 August 1864, and her application was accepted on 28 December 1864. #447\n\n14 Apr 13The standard way of writing 'p' used to involve a large riser, so that the vertical line at the beginning was as high as the vertical line in (for example) a 'k'. This misleads people today, and more surprisingly, apparently also misled people in the 19th century. Adam Cooker's surname is sometimes reported as 'Cooper'. On 21 June 1863, the Adjutant General's Office reported that that they had no evidence Adam Cooker was enrolled or mustered in the 91st (though he was discharged for disability on 11 March 1862). But on 12 March 1865, they reported that Adam Cooper [sic] was enrolled on 30 September 1861. #446\n\n7 Apr 13After the war, Charles Henry claimed that Camp Chase, where the regiment trained when it was first formed in 1861, was 'a sort of Hollow[,] a low ground[,] which unfortunately had been selected for the Camp', and claimed that 'the weather during the time [the regiment camped there] was Excessively bad'. #445\n\n31 Mar 13On 13 June 1871, John Walton's remarried widow, Elizabeth Kahmer, asked the Pension Office to return John Walton's discharge, care of her attorney (J E Devitt + Company). They sent it on 28 June 1871, but Devitt + Company returned it with a note claiming that it had been sent to them by mistake. On 12 October 1871, she again requested it, and they sent it to her on 12 October 1871. (She also requested her marriage certificate, but they claimed it could not be returned, without explanation.) On 6 March 1875, she asked where his discharge and her marriage certificate were. On 15 May 1875, the Pension Office summarized what had happened, and said they had no information. A memorandum in his file claims: 'There has been wretched bungling on the part of this Office in the correspondence about this lost Discharge, or else a great loss of papers from this case. ...' The pension certificate file now includes it (page 26 on Fold3). #444\n\n24 Mar 13William Hooven (C) died on 27 May 1867. Dr E B Shapleigh signed his death certificate, claiming that the cause of death was However, when Hooven's widow applied for a pension, Shapleigh testified that he died of chornic diarrhoea and hemorrhage of the bowels. He presumably changed the cause of death to match the illness because of which he was discharged, to make it easier for the Pension Department to conclude that he died from a disease contracted in the service. #443\n\n17 Mar 13Having spent facts 433 through 442 on evidence about Edgar Gregory's administrative ability, I should briefly mention some other facts about Gregory. He was an abolitionist (see e.g. 'Letter from a radical on the Freedmen's Bureau') and temperance advocate (e.g. Ohio State temperance convention), and was one of unfortunately few whites to think that the end of slavery meant that the freedmen had the same rights as whites, and that the freedmen could handle the responsibilities of citizens (see especially his letter to Benjamin Harris). He was amazingly industrious, undertaking four trips through Texas on horseback from 10 November 1865 through May 1866. He was unfailingly brave (see e.g. Oliver Otis Howard's Autobiography volume 2, page 218). I will close with one final commendation, written about Gregory when he was Assistant Commissioner of the Freedman's Bureau for Texas: 'Through Cana, in Fort Bend and Horton counties, the poor freedmen have heard of Gen. Gregory, and they whisper his name among themselves, and pray that they may see him and lay before him their numerous grievances for redress' ('A rich letter'). #442\n\n10 Mar 13In summary, while various bits of evidence hint that Edgar Gregory may not have been the best administrator, none are clear; all require further research. Even the strongest evidence, provided by his failed businesses, is unclear because of the high rate of business failures in those unregulated years, and because the evidence I have does not make clear whether Gregory (rather than his partners) was primarily responsible for the failures. (See fact 433 and subsequent facts for the background.) #441\n\n3 Mar 13One more bit of questionable evidence about the administrative ability of Edgar Gregory (see fact 433 and subsequent facts for the background). He was the US Marshall for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania during the 1870 census. As Marshal, he was responsible for the 1870 census, which had to be retaken in Philadelphia (along with several other cities) because the first enumeration missed many people. In his obituary, the Philadelphia Inquirer claimed that the \"general inefficiency of our census system\" was mainly at fault, and not Gregory himself\". And the fact that the census was also redone elsewhere does seem to support that claim. #440\n\n24 Feb 13Here is a third bit of positive evidence about the administrative ability of Edgar Gregory (see fact 433 and subsequent facts for the background). He was the US Marshall for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania during the 1870 election. On 11 October 1870, he intervened to prevent a riot and to force the police to all colored men to vote. When the mayor complained, Gregory claimed that the Marines were needed because Fox's police were preventing colored voters from voting, and had even arrested the deputies Gregory sent. Clearly, in this case, he had prepared appropriately. #439\n\n17 Feb 13Here is a second, albeit indirect, bit of positive evidence about the administrative ability of Edgar Gregory. After the war, on 15 November 1866, Ulysses S Grant wrote to Secretary of War Stanton recommending either Chas. T. Campbelle or Edgar Gregory for appointment as Lieutenant Colonel in the 37th Infantry, but on 19 November he wrote recommending Galusha Pennypacker instead, enclosing a letter from Governor Curtin (which isn't reprinted in his papers). Presumably, Grant would not have proposed Gregory if he thought him a poor administrator. #438\n\n10 Feb 13Let me switch now to positive evidence about the administrative ability of Edgar Gregory. (See fact 433 and subsequent facts.) Gregory was appointed Provost Martial and Acting Military Governor of Alexandria, Virginia on 27 April 1862. He replaced Henry K Viele, who apparently failed badly. While I haven't found much information about his service there, he apparently restored order in the town, and certainly was not criticized for his administration. #437\n\n3 Feb 13The fourth bit of evidence I've found about Edgar Gregory's administrative ability is related to his having been assigned to command the Chester Rendezvous when the regiment returned from veterans' furlough. While the regiment was waiting for orders, many men went absent without leave. For a few days, about 54% of the enlisted men in the regiment were absent without leave! The War Department apparently asked Lieutenant Colonel Sinex to explain why so few men were present for duty; he began his response by saying this:\n\nI have the honor herewith most respectfully to report in Compliance with Instructions from your Hd Qrs of this date that the Regiment under Command of Col. E. M Gregory left Phila on the 16th day of February for Chester Barracks Pa and that the command was verbaly [sic] given up to me on the 20th day of February but that I never really had Command until the day the Regiment left the Barracks. that Col. Gregory made all the details without my knowledge up to March 1st 64.\n\nHere again the evidence is hard to interpret; Sinex was obviously trying to deflect blame from himself, and I have not found any explanation by Gregory of his actions. #436\n\n27 Jan 13The third bit of evidence about Gregory's administrative ability is about another, more amorphous, conflict within the regiment. According to a late report, 'there was considerable friction' in the 91st Pennsylvania between religious men (associated with Gregory) and others (eventually associated with Eli Sellers). This report claims that Sellers admitted retaliating against the religious men: \"It was just this, they were Gregory's pets, and when I got the chance I downed them, and when I became lieutenant-colonel I did get it\". (This may explain the odd facts leading to the court martial of Joseph Gilbert.) Now, the source is late (1903), and second hand; whether we should believe it isn't clear. And if it is true, Sellers clearly comes off worse than Gregory (though I should point out that Sellers was not still holding a grudge in 1903, and was happy to support Thomas Walter's pension claim). But allowing divisions like that, and favoring people to the degree that they would be regarded as his \"pets\", would (if true) not speak well for his personnel handling. #435\n\n20 Jan 13The second bit of evidence I have about Edgar Gregory's administrative ability relates to a conflict within the regiment. Company B's original captain (Alpheus Bowman) and first lieutenant (Morris Kayser) hated each other, and managed to get each other court-martialed. Bowman was discharged dishonorably twice, before being permitted to resign for disability and absence without leave; Kayser was found guilty and could have been executed, but instead received a sentence that the Corps Assistant Adjutant General found 'entirely inadequate', and resigned months later. Now, the quarrel between them was undoubtedly severe (see, e.g., the letter from Sinex to the War Department on 14 September 1863). But could Gregory have done anything about it? My understanding is that at the beginning of the war, volunteer regiments followed the old tradition of allowing men to elect their own officers. If the 91st did that (and I have found no evidence about that), Gregory may not have been able to reassign Bowman or Kayser. On the other hand, if he had the authority, and did not use it, defending his personnel management would be very difficult. #434\n\n14 Jan 13The first evidence I have about Edgar Gregory's administrative ability is that he was declared bankrupt in 1869. He had been in three failed businesses before the war, four in Cincinnati, and the last in Philadelphia. He claimed the firm in Philadelphia failed because it was unprofitable, and could have continued if he hadn't joined the Army. The other firms failed because of 'general commercial distress', at least largely because of bad accomodation paper. (That is, they endorsed loans for other parties, which were not able to repay them.) This record is obviously not admirable, but I do not know whether Gregory is at fault. (In particular, to what degree was he responsible for the accomodation papers? How unusual was this record of failed businesses?) Many cases were filed in court to recover money from these businesses; in particular, the claim of his partner William Burnet that Gregory owed him $150,000 was extensively litigated in Cincinnati, for eleven years. Perhaps the court files would provide more information. #433\n\n6 Jan 13Whether Edgar Gregory's lack of success as Assistant Commissioner of the Freedman's Bureau for Texas was due primarily to structural problems or to his lack of ability is controversial. Crouch, for example, claims:\n\nHis deficiences had nothing to do with his mental capabilities or perception of the Texas dilemma. These can be directly tied to finances, separate commands for the Bureau and the army, deciding which sections of the state to concentrate upon, general white opposition, aand how much support the army could provide. (Barry A Crouch, The Freedmen's Bureau and Black Texans [Austin: University of Texas Press, 1992], p.21)\n\nRichter, on the other hand, after praising Gregory's decency, sympathy, and courage, and recognizing the severe structural problems Gregory faced, claims:\n\nBut the truth seemed to be that Gregory could not run an operation so large as the Texas bureau. He never divided the state into subdistricts with defined zones of control for his subassistant commissioners. He failed to attract the type of staff officer who could assist him in his bureaucratic functions ... Moreover, had Burnet not attacked Gregory it is likely that Gregory's inept administration would have reached a crisis shortly, anyhow. Burnet merely kicked in an already rotten door. Indeed a cogent argument could be made that Burnet could have done the bureau more harm if he had left Gregory undisturbed in his bumbling ways. (William L Richter, Overreached on all sides: the Freedmen's Bureau Administrators in Texas, 1865-1868 [College Station: Texas A & M University Press, 1991], p.289, footnote omitted)\n\nI will try over the next few weeks to sketch evidence from before and after the war that might be relevant.\n\n#432\n\n8 Dec 12David Irvine (D) spent time somewhere in the south before the war, returning to Philadelphia only in April 1861, and immediately joining a three-months regiment. (He may have been living in Kent, Maryland, in 1860.) According to his sister Catharine, he frequently complained that he had left all his savings in the south, was only too glad to arrive home alive, and had no money. #431\n\n2 Dec 12Mary Irvine, mother of David Irvine (D), received a pension based on his (brief) service. But after her death, Special Examiner W E Jenks investigated whether she was really entitled to a pension. Her daughter Catharine Keys testified that before the war Thomas Irvin (who died in Spring 1861) supported her, and David actually contributed nothing. Further, some evidence suggested that he may have died of a familial problem, which wasn't contracted while he was in the Army. Jenks concluded: 'The claim was undoubtedly a fraud[.] The Pensioner was not dependent on her son, and it does not appear that the soldier died of disease contracted in the Army.' #430\n\n18 Nov 12Francis Cole and others apparently reenlisted in company A instead of their actual companies (see Fact of the Week 102). This delayed approval of Cole's widow's pension application; apparently the company C commander wasn't familiar with the circumstances of his final illness. The Pension Office initially rejected Maria Cole's application, because the company C commander (Ed J Maguigan), who initially certified facts about Cole's death, certified that Cole became ill while on furlough. The Pension Office accepted her application only after the company A commander (F H Gregory) and others certified he was ill before beginning the furlough. #429\n\n11 Nov 12Martin Blake (E) and William H Jeffries (E) were both captured on 3 May 1863, at Chancellorsville, Virginia. They were paroled one week later. Jeffries later claimed Blake (and presumably Jeffries also) 'received severe and harsh treatment from the enemy during the short period he was a prisoner[;] at the time of his capture he was hurried away by the rebels in a severe rainstorm[,] one of the heaviest ever known to deponent [sc. Jeffries]'. #428\n\n4 Nov 12Francis C Cole died while on the furlough he and others had earned by reenlisted as veteran volunteers. His widow's pension certificate file reports that the regiment travelled from Warrenton, Virginia, to Alexandria by railroad, through a severe snowstorm, with at least one company on open platform cars. The regiment arrived in Philadelphia on 8 January 1864, but the furloughs were not distributed until 15 January 1864. Cole, at least, went home on the 8th, at least in part because of the illness that led to his death. I do not know how many men stayed with the regiment until they received their official furlough. #427\n\n28 Oct 12Apparently, some attorneys in Philadelphia swore claimants and their witnesses in the attorney's office, and then had the documents executed in Court. The Pension Office was not pleased when they learned about this problem, and suspended the attorneys and payment of the pensions. At least three pensions received by widows of soldiers who had served in the 91st were suspended because of this problem. Margaret Taylor (remarried widow of James Hood), and Ellen Langebartel (widow of John Langebartel) both used Joseph E Devitt & Company; Mary Hurst (widow of Jerret Hurst) used George W Ford. Langebartle's declaration was executed, properly, at the Orphans' Court, but Taylor's and Hurst's statements were executed in their attorney's office. However, all were eligible for the pensions they had received, and the pensions were resumed (though Taylor and Hurst had to file a new declaration). #426\n\n21 Oct 12William B Miller married Eliza Jones on 11 January 1864, while on leave after reenlisting as a veteran volunteer. He died on 18 (or 20?) June 1864, and she received a pension. However, in 1879, a Pension Office Special Examiner found evidence she had remarried, and her pension was stopped (but she was apparently not prosecuted for fraud). She had lived with John Cogan from about 1867 until he died in 1873, and had children with him; some at least of the people who knew them assumed they were married. Some evidence, however, indicates that they did not see themselves as having been married. But she did receive compensation as Cogan's widow from Woods Brothers, the company for whom he was working when he was killed by an accident.\n\nAs I understand the law, a common-law marriage requires that the parties express in words of the present tense a present intention to be married; being generally regarded as married counts as evidence for that intention, but does not constitute a valid common-law marriage. (See, for example, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision in Staudenmayer v. Staudenmayer, 714 A. 2d 1016, 23 July 1998.) Perhaps the Pension Office regarded constant cohabitation and being generally regarded as married, even with evidence that the parties did not intend to be married, as constituting a common-law marriage (at least in Pennsylvania). (For more information, see e.g. Beverly Schwartzberg, '\"Lots of them did that\": desertion, bigamy, and marital fluidity in late-nineteenth-century America', Journal of Social History 37 (2004) 573-600.)\n\n#425\n\n14 Oct 12Wilfred Bywater joined the regular Cavalry after the war (on 14 November 1865). He learned the hard way that desertion was taken more seriously than it had been during the Civil War among volunteers. He deserted on 17 August 1871, in Oregon. After he turned himself in, on 5 August 1876, he was sentenced not only to dishonorable discharge and loss of pay and allowances, but also to two years at hard labor, which he served (mostly) at Alcatraz Island. He was released early (apparently on 1 April 1878), 'for good conduct while undergoing sentence'. #424\n\n7 Oct 12Elizabeth Clark, widow of James Clark, experienced an unusual delay in receiving her pension: the Alderman who married them wrote the wrong name on the marriage certificate (Amos Clark instead of James Clark)! One witness suggested he 'mistook the name of James Clark for Amos, on account of the peculiar pronunciation of the said James Clark, he being a Southerner'. But another witness said that when they were married, the Alderman, John Binns, 'who was a very prominent political and literary character of the time was enjoying himself at a social gathering'; perhaps his misunderstanding was aided by drinking. #423\n\n30 Sep 12James Sulger died of typhoid fever less than a month after his discharge. The physician who treated him described his illness in this way:\n\nI was called to see him on the 31st ulto + found him ill with fever of a typhoid type, with great determination to the head. He was soon seized with convulsions which continued to recur at intervals until his death on the 7th inst. While conscious he informed me that he was taken ill at the camp near Sharpsburg, that he was removed in an unconscious state to a private house in that town where he was ill for several weeks + that the surgeon pronounced his case to be typhoid fever, that his condition having somewhat improved he determined to get his discharge + come home.\n\n#422\n\n23 Sep 12Samuel Steel died on 3 May 1863, in the Battle of Chancellorsville, but his body was never identified. It took more than a year and a half for his widow, Ann Steel, to convince the government he was dead, though in the end they accepted her word and the word of two friends that he would have contacted them if he was alive. Interestingly, Bates (presumably relying on the muster-out roll) records him as having died on 13 December 1862, in the Battle of Fredericksburg. #421\n\n16 Sep 12Mahala Crise, widow of Henry Crise, lived in at least six states after his death--Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. #420\n\n9 Sep 12When Ellen, widow of Joseph Johnson, applied for a pension, her husband had been missing for more than five months after the Battle of Chancellorsville, but had not been declared dead. Her application wasn't accepted until more than a year later, after John Hamill certified that men from the 91st had seen Johnson in hospital, wounded and a prisoner. #419\n\n26 Aug 12Patrick O'Malley died a little more than one month after he was discharged for disability. He applied for a pension two weeks after he was discharged, and his application was accepted exceptionally quickly--but not until after he died. Nevertheless, his widow's pension application was not issued until almost a year after she applied. #418\n\n19 Aug 12As Brigade Commander, Edgar Gregory often led religious services, and even sparked a religious revival in the 155th Pennsylvania Infantry. The 155th's regimental history claims that the 91st was 'recruited in the famous Moyamensing district of Philadelphia', and 'afforded a fine field for Christian missionary work for Colonel Gregory', since the men 'although being splendid fighters, were far from being angels, or piously inclined'. (See Under the Maltese Cross, Antietam to Appomattox, p.120.) #417\n\n12 Aug 12I have now added tables listing how long people of different ages served in the regiment (specific ages and age classes). Perhaps surprisingly, 52% of men 40 or older at enlistment served less than 400 days, barely higher than the 49% of men in the regiment overall who served less than 400 days. Of the men who served at least 1,200 days, 30% were less than 20 when they enlisted, while only 20% of the regiment was less than 20 at enlistment. #416\n\n5 Aug 12According to the 1860 census, William Wispert (H) was 62 years old. When he enlisted, one year later, he claimed to be 44. (According to the Army Regulations, paragraph 929, anyone (otherwise qualified) under 35 may be enlisted.) The difference of 19 years between the birthdates estimated from the 1860 census and from the regimental records is the largest I have yet found. Unsurprisingly, he was discharged on 6 April 1862 because of disability. #415\n\n29 Jul 12Stephen Kelly (E) may not have been the only person to have been reported dead wrongly. If I've correctly identified John R Lynch (and he did serve in the regiment), he was reported dead in 1906, because his card was found on the body of a man killed by a train. #414\n\n22 Jul 12One problem Ellen Haughey faced in getting a pension was proving that her husband was dead. Although Charles Haughey died on 12 May 1864, as late as 21 November 1864, Captain Hope could only certify that he was assumed dead. His letter Ellen Haughey, presumably written then, says that 'it is the general belief that he is dead', but they 'have not received any official information concerning him'. #413\n\n15 Jul 12Here's an example of one difficulty in determining how many men served in the regiment. According to the National Cemetery interment records, Rolin Rowe served in the 91st Pennsylvania. I have not found a record of his service with the 91st. A Rollin Rowe did serve in company G of the 2nd regiment Distict of Columbia Infantry. So, is Rowe someone missing from the extant regimental records I've seen (as is apparently true of George Surrick, for example)? Or is the reference to his service in the 91st a mistake for his reference to his service in the 2nd DC (which would be an odd error!)? Or did he serve in the 91st under an alias? (I've send for a compiled military service record for him.) #412\n\n8 Jul 12In 1903, the Pension Bureau sent a special investigator to study the finances of Maria J Brown, widow of John Hamilton. She owned 47 acres outright, had a half-interest in another 69 acres, and a life interest in 53 acres (all in Butler County, Pennsylvania), but claimed an annual income of less than two hundred and fifty dollars. The special investigator concluded that the property really was worth very little, with assessed values unreasonably high (because there was no demand for property in that area). The Pension Bureau must have agreed, since they issued a pension certificate under the Act of 3 March 1901, her second husband having died on 3 April 1890. In addition to the real estate, she owned one cow, eighteen sheep, and about thirty chickens. #411\n\n1 Jul 12Michael King (I) is now the last-known member of the 91st Pennsylvania to die (assuming I have correctly identified him). He died in 1940, after George Kulp (E) (the previous last known death). Kulp, however, is still tied for the oldest member of the 91st Pennsylvania at death; he and David Stiefel (H) were both 96 at death. #410\n\n24 Jun 12According to William Reiff, Hugh McLaughlin was able not only to get into the White House to see Lincoln, but also convinced Lincoln to order the paymaster to pay him, despite his absence without leave, due to what Reiff gently calls '[a]n acquired desire to spree at time[, which] caused Mac ... to leave the different hospitals and have what he considered a 'good time' of it before going to the front'. (See 'Lincoln's kindness', and for other (alleged) interactions between Lincoln and members of the 91st see Abraham Lincoln.) #409\n\n17 Jun 12In "
