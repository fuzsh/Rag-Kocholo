        "text": "Author Brendan J. Lyons, the Boy Scouts of America, and Charles “Charley” Edwin King\n\nAs a young man, Charley author Brendan J. Lyons of West Chester, Pennsylvania was a Boy Scout. He’d earned the rank of Life and began working on earning the Eagle rank, the highest and most prestigious rank in Scouting. The Eagle rank requires the Scout to complete a community service project and Lyons needed to find just such a project. These projects are not always easy to find. Lyon’s interest in history helped him to find his community service project.\n\nLyons learned from his scout leader, who was a member of the Sons of Union Veterans, about Charley King, he was a twelve-year-old drummer boy from West Chester who went off to fight and die in the Civil War.\n\nCharley King’s story intrigued Lyons, especially the part about how no one knew for sure where the young Civil War drummer boy was buried. For his Eagle Scout community service project, Lyons decided he would raise money (along with help from the Sons of Union Veterans and others who had an interest in history) for a monument to honor Charley King that would be placed in the Green Mount Cemetery, where members of the King family are buried.\n\nBrendan J. Lyons completed his Eagle Scout community service project and earned the rank of Eagle. But for many years afterward, Lyons now an adult, felt like his work with Charley King was incomplete.\n\nLyons wanted to tell the story of the Civil War drummer boy. The trouble was, there was that not much known of Charley’s actual history. After all, Charley died when he was only thirteen years old, he did not have the chance to make much life history. What is known is the factual history of Company F of the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteers, the company in which Charley King served. Brendan J. Lyons began researching and writing.\n\nCharley is a novel that combines historical fact and creative fiction to tell a story as accurately as possible about Charley King. It’s a convincing effort. Lyons’ Eagle Scout community service project became one of his life’s works with his book: Charley – The True Story of the Youngest Soldier to Die in the American Civil War.\n\nCharley King’s Early Life Before the Civil War\n\nI have chosen some excerpts from Charley to introduce you to Lyons’ story about Charley King and how the young lad became a drummer in the Civil War. Included too, I have added some explanatory comments of my own. Note that April 3, 1861, was a Wednesday.\n\nMy Comments:\n\nCharles “Charley” Edwin King was born on April 3, 1849.\n\nCharley died on September 20, 1862.\n\nCharley’s father was Pennell, he was a tailor.\n\nHis mother’s name was Adaline.\n\nHis brother Lewis, was two years younger than Charley.\n\n“On this Wednesday in April, one month after the inauguration of President Abraham Lincoln, the nation stood on the brink of conflict.”\n\n“On this Wednesday in April, as the country was coming apart at the seams because of the growing tide of secession, unprecedented animosity divided the nation that first brought the concepts of free and equal representation to the world.”\n\n“On this Wednesday in April 1861, Charley King was turning twelve years old.”\n\n“At this time, when America faced its greatest test since the very revolution that created it, Charley had reached the age that – by his judgment – qualified him to stand and fight for his nation. Whether his father would agree remained to be seen, but in Charley’s mind, he could lift a rifle as well as anyone and his home needed stout defenders.”\n\nYoung Charley King Is a Drummer\n\n“Charley could see himself quite easily, decked in Union blue and marching beside his countrymen. He was already accomplished at keeping time, by virtue of his skill on the drum. His father often claimed Charley had been drumming perfect military cadence since before he could walk. Whether or not that was true, Charley couldn’t say, but he certainly loved to play his drum.”\n\n“Apparently, he loved to play it a tad too much and had just recently drummed right through the head of his snare. It happened two weeks earlier and since then, he’d had to make do with whatever he could get away with drumming on.”\n\n“With the drum beat in his mind, however, he was able to mark time perfectly around his room and, as he did. Envision a future where his deeds brought glory to his family and his nation. One day–and Charley felt that day would come soon–he would find himself marching into Richmond alongside his fellow Union soldiers as streams of confetti and other colorful paper rained down on them. They would be celebrated as liberators from the wicked grasp of traitors and the people would love them for it.”\n\n“The celebration would be even greater when he returned home a hero. His parents would hug him tight and say how proud they were of him. All of West Chester would come out to celebrate. Perhaps all of Chester County!”\n\n“Now boy, I must say–eleven, twelve, or even fifteen, I think it not wise for you to wish to go to war. Truthfully, I will not allow it. Your passion is commendable, but it would be far too dangerous. You are much too young, and besides quite slight for your age. I think you are perhaps the smallest boy in your class. Charley you cannot go to war.”\n\nMy Comments:\n\nCharley was caught up in enthusiasm about going off to war and to “See the Elephant,” which means to experience battle. However, his wise father was against young Charley going off to war.\n\nCharley Gets a New and Special Drum On His Birthday\n\n“By the time the day’s ends came, Charley could barely keep his feet from tapping. He was prepared to leap out of his chair and sprint home to see what news may have come while lessons were being taught, but he was stopped by a group of friends before he could.\n\n“‘Where are you headed Charley?’ one of them asked.\n\n“‘Oh, just going home. I thought I’d stop by the telegraph office and see if there was any war news on the way.’\n\n“‘Are you marching down?’ asked another.\n\n“‘I… guess I can…’ Charley wasn’t sure where this line of questions was going. The other kids were his friends, but they rarely showed interest in his marching about anymore. It was odd that they would ask him now.\n\n“‘Why don’t you lead us?’ The first classmate asked. ‘We figured if the war is gonna happen maybe we ought to get the top shape, right?’\n\n“Charley frowned.\n\n“‘I guess only I can’t really lead you guys. My drum is broken.’\n\n“‘Well, I guess you’ll need a new drum!’ A voice behind him made Charley jump.\n\n“Charley whirled around to see his parents standing there side by side, huge smiles on their faces. His father held out a large cylindrical package.\n\n“‘Happy birthday, Charley,’ he said.\n\n“‘We hope you like it,’ his mother added.\n\n“Without hesitating, Charley took the package and tore off the paper. Inside, was a large blue snare drum with red trim on the top and bottom. Around the middle, it was emblazoned with a soaring bald eagle on opposite sides of the drum.\n\n“‘This is amazing,’ Charley gasped. ‘It’s perfect… the eagle, is this…?’\n\n“‘The very drum that the musicians in the Army of the Potomac play,’ Pennell confirmed.\n\n“‘Your father had the Sweney boy send one in,’ Adeline said. ‘He made such a show about having all that extra work so you wouldn’t think anything odd if you saw him rushing about. I told him you wouldn’t notice, but he does so like to play games.’\n\nMy Comments:\n\nNow on his birthday, young Charley King has an actual drum used by the military. It’s a dream come true for the now twelve-year-old musician. The “Sweney boy” was no longer a boy, he was a neighbor and friend of the King family who would have a great influence on Charley’s future.\n\nCharley Wants To Be A Drummer In The Civil War\n\n“The family said Grace and they began to dish out dinner, starting with the youngest children.\n\n“‘So you like the drum.’ Pennell said, as he distributed chunks of cornbread.\n\n“‘I love it,’ Charley answered. ‘I led practically the whole school around town, and they all marched in line. well sort of a line…’\n\n“‘Oh, we heard,’ Adeline said.\n\n“‘People were talking about it?’ Charley asked.\n\n“‘No, your mother means we actually heard it,’ Pennell clarified. ‘That is quite the loud drum. Necessarily so, of course, as it must be heard over the sounds of battle.’\n\n“‘Hey yeah.’ Charley said, a thought forming in his mind. He looked over at his drum and thought about what a thrill it had been to lead his peers. And he was a good drummer – everyone said so.\n\n“‘What if I was a Drummer Boy?’ he blurted out.\n\n“‘I would say you already are.’ his mother replied.\n\n“‘No, I mean, when the war starts. The army needs drummers don’t they, to help with a March and all sorts of things? But drummers don’t carry guns.‘\n\n“Charley watched as his father drew a long breath, lying down his silverware beside his plate.\n\n“‘Son, we already talked about this. You’re too young. Whether you’re carrying a gun or not, you would still be in danger.’\n\n“‘But they wouldn’t fire on a drummer boy, would they?’\n\n“‘The drummer marches in line with the rest of his company, Charley. Side-by-side. When one line fires on another, they are rarely discerning when it comes to their target. You are only 12 years old.’”\n\nMy Comments:\n\nA fire is lit in Charley’s mind to become a drummer in the Civil War. Pennell and Adaline now have a challenge to discourage Charley from having such a dream.\n\nCaptain Sweney Needs a Drummer For Company F of the 49th Pennsylvania\n\nMy Comments:\n\nAs Charley is marching about West Chester and playing his new drum, practicing as if he is a drummer in the Civil War. He encounters a man in a blue uniform with the insignia of a captain riding on a horse. Charley’s drumming had spooked the horse. The uniform caused Charley to not immediately recognize the man, but he looked familiar. But then Charley knew who the man on the horse was.\n\nHe is Benjamin Sweney, the next-door neighbor of the King family, now to be the captain of Company F of the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteers. At Charley’s father’s request, it was Sweney who had arranged for Charley to have a new drum as a birthday present. This chance meeting on a West Chester, Pennsylvania street would change Charley’s life.\n\n“‘So, tell me, Charley, how long have you been drumming?’\n\n“‘Forever, I guess,’ Charley shrugged. ‘I don’t really remember a time when I wasn’t playing in some way. I just like keeping time, I suppose.’\n\n“‘Well you are skilled at it. I have a deep love of music and I greatly appreciate a kindred spirit..’\n\n“Charley forced a smile.\n\n“‘Thank you… sir, would you mind if I asked you a question?’\n\n“‘Go ahead.’\n\n“‘Well, if you’re a captain in the army, what are you doing in West Chester? Shouldn’t you be with your regiment?’\n\n“‘Well,‘ Captain Sweney said. ‘I suppose I should, but at the moment I don’t have one. I’m here because Mr. Lincoln is looking for 300,000 men for three years of service. I’m to be captain of Company F in the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteers, but as of now, the 49th doesn’t exist. it will soon, though.’\n\nMy comments:\n\nCaptain Sweney and Charley begin to discuss about men volunteering to join the army. In particular Charley’s father and Charley himself.\n\n“‘Oh, he sees it that way when it comes to his own duty, should his country need him,’ Charley explained, ‘just not when it comes to me. I love this country too, but I cannot go fight. I cannot even carry a drum.’\n\n“Captain Sweney frowned.\n\n“‘It sounds as if he wants to keep you safe. I don’t believe there is anything wrong with a father thinking that way.’\n\n“‘Of course,’ Charley replied. ‘I understand that. I just… sorry, sir. I don’t mean to be rude.’\n\n“‘Not at all. listen, your father wants you to be safe, and I understand that. My father wants me and my brother to be safe too, no matter how old we’ve gotten.’\n\n“‘But I also understand your deep desire to come to the aid of your country. So… well, I can make no promises, Charley, but I will be head of a company… and a company needs a drummer. Perhaps I can speak with your father.’\n\n“Charley tried to contain his excitement. He knew his father was serious about keeping him safe and he had no chance of changing his mind on his own. But maybe with the help of a captain in the army, Pennell might just see things differently.\n\n“‘You would you do that for me?’ Charley said. ‘What if he doesn’t change his mind?’\n\n“‘It cannot hurt to try,’ Captain Sweney replied. ’I’ll come by tomorrow morning and speak to him.’\n\n“They did not have to wait long at all before Captain Sweney appeared on the block, making his way toward the King’s home. He was still in his uniform, riding his horse toward them. He stopped and tied the beast to the porch before walking to the door and knocking. Charley moved to answer it but his father gestured for him to sit back down and wait. A moment later, Captain Sweney was inside.\n\n“‘I’ve not seen you for some time, Benjamin,’ his father said. ‘You’ve done quite well for yourself, I see.’\n\n“‘As you as have you.’ Captain Sweney replied. ‘You have a fine home. It almost makes a man jealous to see such a fine picture of domestic life. A military tent is a little comfort.’\n\n“‘Indeed, Pennell said. You, of course, know my son Charley. The other children are still upstairs, and my wife Adeline is in the kitchen. Would you like to come sit down and have breakfast?’\n\n“‘That is very kind of you Pennell, I accept. Do you have any coffee?’\n\n“‘I am certain we can brew some up for you,’ Pennell replied.\n\n“‘So,’ his father said, ‘I understand you’ve spoken to my boy about being a drummer for your company.’\n\n“‘Yes, Mr. King. I apologize if I overstep my boundaries. The boy nearly crashed into me while I was riding through town, and I happened to notice his considerable skill with the instrument.’\n\n“‘I understand your company is to be part of the 49th Pennsylvania, organizing in September. Is that correct?’\n\n“‘It is,’ Captain Sweney said. ‘Before you give me your thoughts on the matter of Charley’s joining, I do want to say that I am very understanding of your feelings on the matter. This is no small thing to be undertaken lightly. War is a dangerous proposition, for all involved. That said, precision is paramount when moving and positioning troops, and I have heard your son play. I venture to say he understands the importance of precision.’\n\n“‘In music, certainly,” Pennell allowed, ‘but the streets of West Chester are not the fields of Virginia, Ben. And cannonballs do not discriminate between musket and drum.’\n\n“‘That is true, but your boy will not be in the thick of it. When battle commences, he would be behind the company. I will make sure of that, he will stay safe.’\n\n“‘How can you promise that?’ Charley heard his mother ask. ‘You have no control over what the other side will do. The Rebels will fire upon anyone in blue. They have no regard for age.’\n\n“‘I will see to it myself,’ Captain Sweney replied. ‘As long as I stand – as long as I hold my command – I promise to ensure your son’s safety. He will not be hurt under my watch.’\n\n“‘You’ll make it part of your duty to protect him?’ his father asked. ‘You give me your word?’\n\n“‘On my honor,’ Captain Sweney said, ‘he will not come to harm.’\n\n“Charley let out a long breath. They rose to their feet and walked out of the kitchen to where Charley was waiting. Behind them, he could see his mother standing with a hand over her mouth. The look on her face pained him deeply, but nothing could turn him back now.\n\n“‘Well,’ the captain said, ” ‘I suppose you could hear all that from here. Enjoy the rest of your summer, Charley. come September, we muster.’”\n\nMy Comments:\n\nCaptain Sweney has made an unreasonable promise to Charley’s father and mother that he will keep Charley safe in battle. Perhaps Captain Sweney is naive. With this, twelve-year-old Charley King’s life takes a dramatic turn. He will be going off to fight in Mr. Lincoln’s Army as a drummer in Company F in the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteers. His drummer dream is to come true. Charley will train to become a soldier and he will participate in many Civil War battles.

Charley goes to war and “Sees the Elephant.”\n\nFactual History of Company F of the 49th Pennsylvania\n\nMy comments:\n\nFrom September 14, 1861 and on, the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Unit was very active in the Civil War. The unit would suffer casualties as it fought in many battles, 361 men would be lost. Company F fought battles in the Eastern Theatre and Charley King served as a drummer in many significant battles.\n\nCasualties of the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Unit\n\nNine officers were killed or mortally wounded.\n\nSignificantly, Colonel Thomas M. Hulings died in action at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House.\n\n184 enlisted men were killed or mortally wounded.\n\nDisease always took a heavy toll in the Civil War. It killed 168 men of the 49th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Unit.\n\nCharley King would become the youngest-documented soldier of either North or South to be killed in the Civil War. He suffered a mortal wound at the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862.

Lyon’s novel Charley is a book that combines historical facts and creative fiction to tell a story as accurately as possible about Charley King. It’s a convincing effort. In Charley, Lyons blends factual history with believable and imaginative storytelling. Lyons is not unlike Michael and Jeff Shaara in this talent.\n\nAs I read Charley, I began to think that Lyons had discovered a diary of Charley’s, a diary where Charley kept a detailed record of his short life and times. He gets the history right and fills in the unknown story about Charley King with his own imagination. The result is an intriguing, entertaining, and informative book.\n\nI found Charley to be a page-turner and I’m sure you will too. I wholeheartedly recommend Brendan J. Lyons’ book, Charley – The True Story of the Youngest Soldier to Die in the American Civil War to you.\n\nCharley will help you to Learn Civil War History.\n\nBook Information From Amazon:\n\nProduct details\n\nPublisher ‏ : ‎ Brookline Books (July 15, 2023)\n\nLanguage ‏ : ‎ English\n\nPaperback ‏ : ‎ 160 pages\n\nISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 1955041067\n\nISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-1955041065\n\nReading age ‏ : ‎ 12 – 18 years\n\nGrade level ‏ : ‎ 7 – 9\n\nItem Weight ‏ : ‎ 3.2 ounces\n\nDimensions ‏ : ‎ 5.8 x 0.6 x 8.9 inches\n\nBest Sellers Rank: #763,430 in Books (See Top 100 in Books)\n\n#19 in Teen & Young Adult United States Civil War Period History\n\n#151 in Teen & Young Adult Historical Biographies\n\n#4,477 in Military Leader Biographies\n\nCustomer Reviews: 5.0 5.0 out of 5 stars 7 ratings\n\nJohn Singleton Mosby – The Gray Ghost Of The Confederacy\n\nVirginian and Confederate Colonel John Singleton Mosby was from just south of Charlottesville. He led his famous partisan ranger unit called Mosby’s Rangers, but it was officially the 43rd Battalion of the Virginia Cavalry. Mosby took his cavalry on raids known for their quickness. After a raid, Mosby and his men would escape from pursuing Yankees by blending in with the local people in their towns and farms. They hid in plain sight. Mosby was so effective with his raids that an area of Virginia he dominated became known as Mosby’s Confederacy. Because of his ability to disappear after a raid, Mosby was called the “Gray Ghost.”\n\nA Kick In The Face\n\nMosby had a reputation for being cantankerous and ornery. He was a tough fighter and scrapper. Mosby wouldn’t give an inch. A story circulating after the Civil War told about how a horse kicked Mosby hard in the face while he was visiting Charlottesville. He was seriously injured by the horse hoof’s blow to his head. Mosby was knocked out cold and it was feared he might be dead. Mosby was rushed over to the University of Virginia’s infirmary for treatment. A young intern there leaned over the now semi-conscious former Confederate raider, the “Gray Ghost,” and asked him, “What’s your name?” The prickly Mosby was now in a semi-conscious state. He remained true to his character and replied to the young intern, “None of your damn business.” A nearby surgeon who was preparing to possibly operate on the Gray Ghost heard what Mosby said. The surgeon was familiar with Mosby’s reputation and he exclaimed, “He’s conscious all right.”\n\nYoung Mosby Goes To Jail – Becomes A Lawyer\n\nWhen he was a young lad, it seemed unlikely that John Singleton Mosby would ever become a soldier. He was often sick, picked on, and bullied by other boys at school. But John had an inner strength and he learned to fight back against challengers. While studying Classical Studies at the University of Virginia, he got into a fight with a fellow student. Mosby drew a pistol and shot his adversary in the neck. He was arrested, sent to jail for a year, fined $500, and kicked out of the university. In jail, Mosby’s health declined and because of his bad health, he received a pardon from Virginia’s governor. Oddly, Mosby became friends with the prosecuting attorney who helped send him to jail. In jail, and after being released, this attorney gave Mosby use of his law library. Mosby earnestly studied the attorney’s law books and in 1854 he was admitted to the bar.\n\nMosby’s Family Life – A Combination of Joy and Loss\n\nJohn Singleton Mosby married Pauline Clarke and began a law practice in Howardsville, Virginia in 1857. John and Pauline began their family. Daughters May and Beverly were born before the Civil War and John Singleton Mosby Jr., was born in 1863 while the Civil War was raging. Son Lincoln was born in 1865 and Victoria was born in 1866. Isn’t it curious that the Gray Ghost of the Confederacy would name his son Lincoln? Daughter Pauline was born in 1869 and Ada came in 1871. Two Mosby sons perished at very young ages. Son George was born in 1873 and he died in 1874. Son Alfred was born and died in 1876 as did his wife Pauline.\n\nThe Civil War Comes, Mosby Joins the Confederate Army, Is Captured\n\nBefore the Civil War, the man who became known as the “Gray Ghost” of the Confederacy at first opposed secession. However, he joined the Confederate army and was a member of the “Confederate Volunteers.” In this company, he fought as a private at the Battle of First Manassas/Bull Run. Mosby demonstrated great skill and capability at gaining intelligence about Yankee operations. In light of this, J. E. B. Stuart made Mosby a First Lieutenant in early 1862. Mosby became a part of Stuart’s cavalry scouts. Mosby was captured in 1862, He spent ten days in the Old Capital Prison in Washington, D.C. before being paroled in a prisoner exchange. He paid attention while in prison. During a temporary time at Fort Monroe, he observed an increase of ships in Hampton Roads. Ships were arriving with thousands of Union soldiers. These men were on their way to reinforce John Pope in his Northern Virginia Campaign. After his ten days in prison, Mosby went to Richmond and conveyed this crucial information to General Robert E. Lee.\n\nMosby’s Rangers\n\nThe Confederate Congress passed the Partisan Ranger Act in April 1862. This act, “provides that such partisan rangers, after being regularly received into service, shall be entitled to the same pay, rations, and quarters, during their term of service, and be subject to the same regulations, as other soldiers.”\n\nJ. E. B. Stuart was Mosby’s commanding officer and after the December 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg, they together made raids into Union lines. These raids went into Prince William, Fairfax, and Loudoun counties in Virginia. Their goal was to mess up and muddle Union communication, material, and replenishments between Fredericksburg and Washington, D. C., while also providing for themselves. It was later that year when Mosby and his raiders joined up in Loudoun County with a mishmash of other cavalrymen.\n\nBy January 1863, Mosby was a Major and he had command of the 43rd Virginia Cavalry, a partisan unit that became known as “Mosby’s Rangers.” The 43rd Virginia Cavalry was a unit of the Army of Northern Virginia and followed the commands of Robert E. Lee and J. E. B. Stuart. There were approximately 1,900 men who served from January 1863 to April 1865 in the 43rd Virginia Cavalry. Special rules were given to this cavalry unit of partisan rangers. They were allowed to share the spoils of war they gathered on their raids and they had no camp duties to worry about.\n\nMosby’s Rangers made quick raids on Union supply lines and bedeviled Union couriers. He was very successful and the 43rd Virginia Cavalry was highly regarded for their effectiveness. It seemed that Mosby’s Rangers were able to disappear and escape without a trace after a raid as if they were ghosts. They would spread themselves into the local civilian populations, mixing in, dispersing, and disappearing as if normal civilians and not combatants. This is how Mosby gained the nickname “Gray Ghost.”\n\nFairfax Court House Raid and General Stoughton Capture\n\nMosby is perhaps best remembered for his inside Union lines on March 9, 1863, gutsy raid on Fairfax Court House, Virginia. Mosby and his Rangers made a nighttime raid on the small town. Union Brigadier General Edwin H. Stoughton was captured along with three more officers and other Yankee soldiers. Mosby claimed a deserter of the 5th New York Cavalry who had joined up with his Rangers, provided information that aided in the raid.\n\nMosby wrote in his memoirs that he came upon General Stoughton while he was asleep in bed, apparently after an evening of revelry and drinking. Mosby slapped Stoughton on his backside, “on his bare back,” to wake him. Stoughton then asked what was this all about. The Gray Ghost then asked Stoughton, “Do you know Mosby, general?” Stoughton answered, “Yes! Have you got the rascal?” Mosby responded, “I am Mosby.” Then he told Stoughton, “Stuart’s cavalry has possession of the Court House; be quick and dress.”\n\nMosby’s raid on Fairfax Court House was very successful. He and his twenty-nine men had captured General Stoughton, two captains, thirty enlisted men, and fifty-eight horses. Not even a single shot was fired during the raid. When President Abraham Lincoln learned of the Gray Ghost’s raid he said, “I can make more generals, but horses cost money.”\n\nMosby’s Rangers Raids in May and June of 1863\n\nOn May 3, Mosby’s Rangers successfully surprised a Union Cavalry Regiment near Warrenton Junction, Virginia. This is known as the Warrenton Junction Raid. The Union 1st (West) Virginia Cavalry was protecting a supply depot. The Union casualties killed or wounded were six officers and fourteen men, plus supplies. Mosby’s casualties were one killed and no fewer than thirty either wounded or captured. Note: West Virginia soon became a state on June 20, 1863.\n\nOn June 10, Mosby’s Rangers crossed the Potomac River and made a raid on Seneca, Maryland where Yankee cavalry was camped. They were successful at defeating the Sixth Michigan Cavalry and burned their camp. J. E. B. Stuart was pleased with Mosby’s Seneca raid.\n\nNext, J. E. B. Stuart again had Mosby’s Rangers cross the Potomac River at Rowser’s Ford. Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia were on their way north into Union land. It was June 27 and the Battle of Gettysburg was ominously looming, soon to occur on July 1 – 3. At night on June 27, with Mosby already crossing the Potomac at Rowser’s Ford, J. E. B. Stuart’s Cavalry also crossed the Ford. J. E. B. Stuart and his cavalry were now separated from Robert E. Lee and unable to give him scouting information. J. E. B. Stuart would not arrive at the Battle of Gettysburg until the afternoon of July 2. Stuart received a harsh rebuke from Lee regarding his late arrival. Lee said to him, “Well, General Stuart, you are here at last.” For Lee, those were harsh words of admonishment to Stuart.\n\nSome Civil War historians say that a possible reason for Lee having a delay of important cavalry information at Gettysburg was because of Mosby’s success at Rowser’s Ford. Following that, J. E. B. Stuart also crossed at Rowser’s Ford. Thus putting his cavalry, the eyes and ears of important intelligence gathering, out of communication with Lee as he marched the Army of Northern Virginia northward, ultimately to Gettysburg. This continues to be popular a topic of Civil War debate and speculation.\n\nExecutions\n\nThe Gray Ghost and his Rangers did not go unnoticed by General Ulysses S. Grant. Grant wanted the disruption, and loss of men, horses, and materials to end. Mosby was a definite drag on the Union’s war effort. Grant told Major General Philip Sheridan to proceed with this drastic action:\n\n“The families of most of Mosby’s men are know[n] and can be collected. I think they should be taken and kept at Fort McHenry or some secure place as hostages for good conduct of Mosby and his men. When any of them are caught with nothing to designate what they are hang them without trial.”\n\nThis resulted in the execution of six of Mosby’s rangers on September 22, 1864, when they were captured out of uniform, that is as spies, at Front Royal, Virginia. One of those executed, William Thomas Overby, was offered to have his life spared if only he would tell of Mosby’s location. Overby refused the offer. His last words were, “My last moments are sweetened by the reflection that for every man you murder this day Mosby will take a tenfold vengeance.” After the executions, one Yankee spitefully pinned a note to one of the bodies. The note read, “This shall be the fate of all Mosby’s men.”\n\nMosby responded in a like way to the execution of his cavalrymen. The Gray Ghost notified General Robert E. Lee and James Seddon, the Confederate Secretary of War, that he would execute Union prisoners.\n\nSeven Yankee prisoners were chosen in a “death lottery” to be executed at Rectortown, Virginia on November 6, 1864. One of those chosen for execution was only a young drummer boy. With a showing of mercy, his life was spared. In a second “death lottery” another man was selected to take the drummer boy’s place on the gallows.\n\nBy circumstance, not all of the seven Yankees selected for death were executed. Three of them were hanged, two of them managed to escape, and two were left for dead after being shot in the head. Incredibly, the two shot in the head survived.\n\nExecutions End\n\nApparently, the Gray Ghost had had enough of the brutal and mutual prisoner executions. Mosby wrote to Philip Sheridan, the commander of the Shenandoah Valley Union troops, on November 11, 1864. Mosby asked Sheridan if they both could refrain from executing more men. Mosby wrote that they ought to begin acting with humanity toward prisoners of war. Sheridan agreed with Mosby and the executions ended.\n\nMosby Was Wounded Three Times\n\nThe Gray Ghost was first wounded on August 12, 1863, at Annandale, Virginia. He was struck by a bullet in his thigh and side. He recovered quickly and returned to his command a month later.\n\nMosby’s second wounding was on September 14, 1864. This wound was more serious than the first one. He was challenging and taunting a Union regiment by riding back and forth in front of it, boldly tempting fate and death. A Yankee bullet hit Mosby’s revolver’s handle before entering his groin. Mosby was able to escape, but only barely kept on his horse. He was on crutches during a three-week recovery and then returned to his command. Fate was kind to the Gray Ghost.\n\nMosby’s third wound occurred on December 21, 1864. He was having food with a family near Rector’s Crossroads, Virginia when a Yankee ball came through a window and struck him two inches below his bellybutton. Mosby staggered into a bedroom. Quickly and clearly thinking he hid his jacket, which had his identifying rank insignia on it. A Union officer came into the home and inspected Mosby’s wound. He did not know the wounded man was John Singleton Mosby, the Gray Ghost. The officer determined the abdomen wound to be mortal. Mosby was left for dead. It took him two months to recover, and then once again he returned to the field.\n\nMosby’s Surrender\n\nGeneral Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The Civil War was effectively over although some dwindling skirmishes followed. The Gray Ghost and his Rangers standing after Lee’s surrender was tenuous. “Marauding bands” were not given parole by the surrender terms. These marauding bands, which Mosby’s Rangers were, were to be destroyed.\n\nOn April 12, Mosby received a letter from General C. H. Morgan, who was a member of General Winfield S. Hancock’s staff. This letter notified Mosby that if he and his Rangers were to surrender, then they would have the same surrender terms as Lee received at Appomattox Court House. The Gray Ghost disbanded his cavalry unit on April 21 and soon many of his former Rangers went to Winchester, Virginia to surrender. There they received their paroles and the Civil War was over for them. They went home, but some of Mosby’s Rangers remained with him. Their war was not yet over.\n\nMosby himself was not anxious to surrender and refused to do so, he and his remaining Rangers continued on and made a raid near Lynchburg, Virginia in May. Mosby knew there was a $5,000 bounty on his head. Mosby was now a colonel but was in hiding at Lynchburg because of the high bounty. He disbanded his remaining men and they left on their way home. Mosby was still in hiding when General Ulysses S. Grant intervened and the Gray Ghost was given parole. Colonel John Singleton Mosby surrendered on June 17, 1865, he was one of the last officers of the Confederacy to surrender.\n\nMosby was born on December 6, 1833, and he died on May 30, 1916.\n\nGray Ghost Quotes\n\n“The military value of a partisan’s work is not measured by the amount of property destroyed, or the number of men killed or captured, but by the number he keeps watching.”\n\n– John S. Mosby.\n\n“War loses a great deal of its romance after a soldier has seen his first battle. I have a more vivid recollection of the first that the last one I was in. It is a classical maxim that it is sweet and becoming to die for one’s country; but whoever has seen the horrors of a battlefield feels that it is far sweeter to live for it.”\n\n– John S. Mosby.\n\n“Only three men in the Confederate army knew what I was doing or intended to do; they were Lee and Stuart and myself.”\n\n– John S. Mosby."
