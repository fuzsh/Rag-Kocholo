The Sixty-first Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers began its brilliant career in August, 1861, and ended it June 28, 1865. The men, coming from four different sections of the state, widely separated, had little opportunity to perpetuate their ac quaintance, and, having no regimental association they gradually merged into the communities whence they came. Now, after the lapse of nearly half a century, stimu lated by a generous law of the state, the survivors are presenting this history. Fortunately, the regiment, in all its experience, served with troops in the region where the most tremendous operations were conducted of which ample official records exist; besides, innumerable accounts have been published, many written by the men conspicuous in the services described. From these reliable sources of information, supplemented by recollection, by diaries kept during the war, and by various newspaper accounts and other publications, it has been comparatively easy to write a history of the regiment as an organization composing a part of certain brigades, divisions, corps and armies. Such a history is of vast importance to the people of the state and of priceless value to the survivors of the regiment, and would richly deserve publication in a convenient and accessible form if it went no further. But the regiment, from the first to last, had 1987 men, whose heroic deeds gave it the fame of which the state is so justly proud. The individual record, the roster as it is called, of these men is of great interest and importance to them and their descendants. And if the general, regimental and line officers had kept books and records, had made reports and statements as required by military regulations, there would be no diffi culty in giving a complete account of the services of each man. But the officers generally high and low, upon whom the responsibility rested, paid little attention to what they called red tape, and the Government itself shared the indifference, ignoring statutes as well as regulations. In fact, the struggle was so great and the number so vast that only current, obvious and absolute essentials received official attention. The Sixty-first suffered in common with other organizations, leaving the service at the end of the war with an imperfect record. Under these conditions, the Govern ment itself not having made a correct record, it is not reasonable to expect the sur vivors to do so after the lapse of over forty years, especially when, for historic purposes, the nation is compelled to deny access to its own meager records as improved and supplemented since the war closed. Working under the difficulties incident to such a situation, the rosters have been prepared and are presented herewith, practically com plete as to field and staff and companies A and D, but defective in greater or less degree as to the other companies. In preparing the narrative in this volume the historian has reread all the good works on the subject with which he is familiar, such as the memoirs of Generals Grant and Sheridan. The books of Generals McClellan, Doubleday, Humphreys, Webb, Keifer and Horace Porter. The excellent histories by Dr. George T. Stevens, George E- Pond, F. W. Palfrey, John C. Ropes, the Count of Paris, and others on the Union side; on the Confederate, the works of Generals Longstreet, Johnston and Gordon. Besides, much aid has been derived from the material prepared and left by Col. Robert L. Orr. The valuable diary of James M. Walker of Company A has been constantly used and found reliable in every particular. Major Parsons, Capt. Glenn, Secretary Blair, and other members of the regiment, have furnished valuable assistance. Bates' History of Pennsylvania Volunteers has been freely used for the roster data and has been drawn upon for facts appearing nowhere else. Many references are made to these works and frequent quotations therefrom have been made by permission of the publishers. But 4 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT • above all, the historian has found the most valuable help in the \"Rebellion Records,' a stupendous work published by the United States, containing official orders, reports and correspondence of the Confederate as well as the vast Union Army. The pictures of Colonels Rippey, Spear and Orr, and of Lieutenant-Colonel Crosby are all taken from small war-time photographs, faded and dimmed by the flight of time. But the record of these brave officers as shown in the rosters is still vivid, and will remain unclouded so long as the deeds of heroic patriots are cherished among men This history, with many imperfections of which the author is conscious and doubt less many more of which he is not aware, is now submitted in the hope that it will furnish in permanent shape a reliable record for the State of Pennsylvania of the regi mental organization and service; and bring to the members of the Sixty-first regiment, and their families, a welcome chronicle of valiant service in a great cause through a period of depression and triumph, of defeat and victory, to a fame as durable as the mountains of the Keystone State.

PREPARATION. \"Whenever my country calls upon me, I am ready to take my musket on my shoulder.\" 1774. George Washington. The Sixty-first regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers originated July 24th, 1861, when Andrew G. Curtin, the War Governor of the State, com missioned Oliver H. Rippey, of Pittsburgh, its first Colonel, and Frank P. Robinson, of Allegheny City, its first Lieutenant-Colonel. The former had been lieutenant - colonel of the Seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers in the three months' service, going to the front April 23rd. 1861, and re turning from Gen. Patterson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign the 23rd of July, the day preceding the date of their new commissions for service in the three years' regiment, whose number, then written for the first time, was destined to appear on every page of important history in the Army of the Potomac, until the war was triumphantly ended. Col. Rippey had served in the Mexican War, going out in December, 1846 as a private in Col. Francis M. Wynkoop's First Pennsylvania In fantry, participating in the siege of Vera Cruz, and taking part in General Scott's hard fights and signal victories at Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Cheu- rubusco, Molina Del Rey, Chapultepec and Mexico City, returning in December, 1848. With experience in the field equal to any one of his age in 1861, Colonel Rippey had all the elements of a good soldier, joined to patriotic zeal as a citizen. A trained jurist, he was also a brilliant orator with a sympathetic temperament and a strong sense of justice and fair play. He answered the timid apprehensions and irresolute demands for peace, because of the Bull Run defeat, by promptly re-enlisting for three years before the weary victims of that disaster had time to return to their former positions around the National Capital. His regiment was for immediate service in the field, and the recruiting offices, opened in Pittsburgh and Allegheny, were soon thronged with enthusiastic volunteers. 12 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT The quota for Pennsylvania in the three months service was 12,500 men, but before enlistments could be stopped, the State had rushed in 20,175, far surpassing any other state and furnishing more than one-fifth of all the three months volunteers. Of the 500,000 men called by the Pre sident for three years and authorized by Congress in July and August, 1861, the number asked of the Keystone State was 82,525; the generous response gave the Nation 85,160, including the 61st regiment. Under date of August 1st, 1861, the new colonel enrolled about 500 men, subsequently composing Companies B, C, E, F and K. In the meantime, Jacob Creps and John Pollock recruited over one hundred men in Indiana County, who were assigned to the 61st, as Company A, with Jacob Creps as captian and John Pollock as first lieutenant. At this point, when 600 men had enlisted, the regiment was ordered to the front to meet the imperative demand for troops, and immediately prepared to obey the command, although the organization was incomplete as to field staff and line officers, and the men had neither uniforms, arms or camp equipment. The regiment left Pittsburgh, September 1st, 1861, going over the Pennsylvania Railroad to Harrisburg, where a stop of two days occurred, some of the men being supplied with uniforms. The command then pro ceeded to the National Capital, passing through Baltimore in the night, yelling defiance at that unfortunate city, still suffering from the hostility created by the attack April 19th, 1861, on the 6th Massachusetts, while that famous regiment was hurrying to the seat of government, then in great peril. On arriving in Washington, the 61st camped on Capitol Hill, where the Congressional Library now stands. Here the men were armed with old smooth-bore muskets, used in the Mexican War, changed for percussion caps, the cartridge consisting of one round ball the diameter of the bore, three small buckshot, securely wrapped with the powder in tough Manila paper, the whole charge making a roll an inch and a half long, with the paper neatly folded over the powder end and pressed down along the side, ready to be torn off when loading. These guns were carried fifteen months and then exchanged for muzzle-loading Springfield rifles. While in camp on Capitol Hill, discipline was not strict and the new soldiers of the 61st swarmed into the galleries of the Senate and House to see and hear the congressional celebrities, gazed in breathless admira tion on the historic paintings in the rotunda, and scanned with respect ful curiosity, such members of the Supreme Court as made their appear ance. Some of the 61st seeing General Scott in a carriage, showed their profound respect by removing their hats, wondering if they really beheld the hero of Lundy's Lane, the fearless and picturesque Indian fighter, the companion in arms of Zachary Taylor, William Henry Harrison and Andrew Jackson, the masterly conqueror of Mexico, the man who for thirteen years was contemporary of Washington and probably saw the Father of His Country many times. The fresh volunteers of the 61st PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 13 also invaded the various departments, roaming through the White House, hoping for a glimse of Father Abraham. This pleasure, however, was soon ended, and the regiment prepared for its first march with all the equipment of real soldiers; each man with a gun, a cartridge and a cap-box, a canteen, a haversack and a knapsack. The start was made from Capitol E[illf the route through the city to Long Bridge, across the Potomac and down on the Virginia side to Alex andria. The September day was hot, the roads dusty, the distance in terminable, the new shoes intolerable, except in a few instances where they happened to fit. The first Virginia camp was near Fairfax cemetery, an ancient burying ground, whose interments were soon outnumbered by Union soldiers, who, unable to stand the change of climate, with the rigors of camp life, answered the last roll call before meeting the armed enemy. In a couple of days the regiment moved below Alexandria, taking position on the high ridge near the road leading to Mount Vernon, overlooking the Potomac about a mile south of the point where Fort Lyon was subsequently built. This location was called Camp Advance, being further to the front than any other position held by Union troops in that region. The place was well watered, the land undulating and the natural woods nearby, afforded a bountiful supply of fuel for the autumn and winter, while timber was sufficient for necessary regimental structures and for huts which the soldiers soon learned to build with the A camp tent for a roof. Here the regiment remained from early October, 1861, until February 19th, 1862, a period of five months, in which the command received the discipline so necessary to make real soldiers effective in the presence of the enemy and able to endure the hardships of campaigning without losing health or martial spirit. Before describing this period of strenuous preparation, wherein the true American soldier was evolved from the citizen, it is necessary to have a closer view of the regiment as it then existed. The active field officers then in service were: Colonel, Oliver H. Rippey; Lieutenant Colonel, Frank P. Robinson; Adjutant, W. Gibson Miller; Quarter-Master, Ben jamin W. Baldwin; Surgeon, Robert M. Tindel; Assistant Surgeon, Ambrose I. Hew. According to a published order under date of October 15th, 1861, five Pennsylvania regiments, the 32nd, 45th, 61st, 63rd and 105th, were to constitute the 3rd brigade of Heintzelman's division, but the 45th was detained elsewhere, and the 32nd was detailed for garrison duty, so that the brigade was actually composed of the other three regiments and was commanded by Brigadier General Charles D. Jamison, an ideal soldier, who soon gained the confidence of his men. The regimental commanders were Col. O. H. Rippey, 61st; Col. Alexander Hays, 63d; and Col. A. A. McKnight, 105th. The work of seasoning the raw material began at once in real earnest. In the forenoon details worked on Fort Lyon, 14 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT gaining a knowledge of fortifications, while those remaining in camp were engaged in squad and company drill, including exercise in the manual of arms. In the afternoon batallion and regimental drills alternated with brigade evolutions, including a great variety of field manoeuvers, in which the several regiments moved to the front in line of battle and in mass, marched by the flank, made charges, formed squares, deployed, rallied, advanced, retreated, wheeled, obliqued, encountering obstacles, sweeping over fields, crossing ravines, rushing through woods, returning to camp in the evening tired and hungry. In the meantime the field, staff and line officers were schooled in their respective duties, and the non-commissioned officers were carefully taught how to do their work. The surgeons and hospital stewards were also systematically instructed in their service and the men were thoroughly educated in the preparation of food, the care of their clothing, and the principles of hygiene. Five months of this experience produced three regiments of unsur passed efficiency in campaigning, and in battles their intrepidity was displayed on every important field in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsyl vania, all three organizations standing high on the official roll of honor, published in 1889. Only 13 regiments out of the whole 2,000 composing the Union army stand higher in the per cent of killed in action than the 63rd, and only 8 regiments had more killed in action than the 105th, while the 61st surpassed all other regiments in the number of its officers killed in action, and has other special honors of which more will be said later. Official figures show these three regiments had 668 men killed in battle, saying nothing in this connection about the wounded or those dying of disease. It appears of record that hard fighting regiments had the smallest proportion of losses from sickness, which is confirmed by the history of these three Pennsylvania regiments. Three reasons exist for this com parative exemption from fatal disease. First: They were drilled in the best methods of taking care of them selves and warding off disease. Second: The good discipline of the men extended to quarter masters and commissaries, who, in spite of all perils managed to furnish the soldiers even on the fighting line, with coffee, bacon and hard tack. Third: The qualities which made them famous as fighters, enabled them to resist attacks of disease, instead of tamely giving up and lying down to die. The month of May seemed a fatal one for these three regiments. Col. O. H. Rippey of the 61st was killed May 31st, 1862, at Fair Oaks. Col. McKnight of the 105th was killed May, 1863, at Chancellors ville, and Col. Hays of the 63rd, having reached the rank of brigadier-general, was killed in the Wilderness in May, 1864. While the 105th was losing its colonel in a charge May 3rd, 1863 at Chancellorsville, the 61st lost Spear, PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 15 its second colonel the same day in a charge on Marye's Heights, at Freder- icksburg. These stalwart regiments were separated in the spring of 1862, the 63rd and 105th serving thereafter in the famous 3rd Corps, until it was consolidated early in 1864 with the still more famous 2nd Corps, and then, with that renowned command, under Hancock and others, until the war ended; while the 61st went with the 4th Corps to the Peninsula and, from the organization of the army under Gen'l. McClellan, for over two years composed a part of the \"Old 6th, \"as it was affectionately called. Still the friendship of the three regiments continued throughout the war and each had a warm affection for, and pride in the other, rejoicing in its glory and grieving over its losses with all the devotion and tenderness of first lovers. About December 1st, 1861, a new flag was sent to the 61st from Harrisburg and presented by Congressman Wright of Philadelphia. The regiment was formed in a hollow square and faced inward. Mr. Wright made a patriotic address and then handed the flag to Col. Rippey, who accepted it in a burst of thrilling eloquence, still remembered by the hearers. Drawing the silk emblem close to him and fondly looking at its red and white stripes, its blue field and bright stars, and talking to it, he made vows of eternal fidelity, and at the close, with his eyes lifted heaven ward, he exclaimed, \"If I forget thee, let my right hand forget her cunning; if I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,\" and then with deep solemnity he declared, \"And this pledge is for every soldier of the 61st regiment.\" This promise was sacredly kept, as that particular flag, torn and riddled with bullets, its staff shattered to splinters, was returned to Harrisburg, where it still exists. The same is true of the three other flags entrusted to the 61st. One incident of Camp Advance should be mentioned. Late in the autumn of 1861, the 61st started early in the morning, marched to Mount Vernon, the home of Washington, returning the same day, a distance for the round trip, of 16 miles. It was a most impressive experience for new soldiers to see the home of the man who was \"first in war, first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\" The premises were decaying for want of attention, but the old mansion was yet dignified anl stately, commanding a grand view of the peaceful Potomac, and in the northeasterly direction the dome of the Capitol rose in majesty and stood out, basking in the soft autumnal air. Referring to Mt. Vernon and its illustrious owner, the Count of Paris makes this interesting observation: \"By a strange coincidence the resi dence of the great citizen whose name both parties were invoking, and whose memory each was anxious to appropriate, was situated between the two lines of out-posts, as if he had hesitated between them, and was still endeavoring to reconcile them.\" One of the last events of Camp Advance to make an indelible im pression, occurred at dress parade on the evening of February 17th, 1862, 16 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT when Adjutant Miller, in his mangnificent style, read a general order, announcing the capture of Forts Henry and Donelson with over 15,000 prisoners and 172 guns, by the troops under \"Brig. Gen. U. S. Grant.\" It was our introduction to the Galena tanner with the suggestive initials which stood for \"unconditional surrender,\" for \"Uncle Sam\" and for \"United States.\" We liked him, but never supposed he would be in Virginia in two years, hurling us against Lee in the Wilderness and at Spottsylvania, and proposing to \"fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\" Under date of February 6th, 1862, the Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac made a report of the number and physical condition of all regiments in which he gave the \"mean strength\" of the 61st at 579, its \"total sick\" at 26, the \"percentage\" being 4.49, the lowest rate in the brigade and only a little over half the average. On February 19, 1862, the 61st was detached from Jamison's brigade and marched to Washington across Long Bridge, camping on Queens Farm near Bladensburg, under command, temporarily, of General Don Carlos Buell. The 61st was greatly disturbed at this time because of an order that all regiments having less than 800 men should be disbanded and distributed to other organizations, but this humiliation for the 61st was avoided by an arrangement which proved fortunate for the Service and satisfactory to the men. The 23rd Pennsylvania, Col. D. B. Birney, had fifteen companies, and a plan was negotiated by which four of these companies were transferred to the 61st, raising its strength to the legal requirement and leaving the 23rd all the men it could lawfully muster for pay. The consolidation was highly gratifying to the 61st, and the trans ferred companies, after getting acquainted, were entirely satisfied. Rippey retained his rank as Colonel; Major George C. Spear of the 23rd, became Lieutenant-colonel of the 61st, Robinson having resigned, and Captain George F. Smith Major of the 61st. The other .field officers of the 61st remained as before. In the consolidated regiment, the original 61st men still composed Companies A, B, C, E, F and K, while the men from the 23rd formed Companies D, G, H and I, no changes being made in the company organizations. Company D was recruited in Luzerne County, the other three companies coming from Philadelphia. The regiment thus formed represented the Keystone State, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, the two leading cities of the east and the west, contributing eight companies ; Luzerne County, the anthracite coal region, furnished Company D; while Indiana County, the lumber and bituminous coal section, gave Company A. The companies from the 23rd had been well drilled in all military requirements and the officers and men were good soldiers, fully worthy of their comrades from the western slope of the Allegheny Mountains. On March 8th, 1862, President Lincoln issued \"War Order No. 2,\" directing that the troops around Washington be divided into five corps of three divisions each, and naming the corps commanders, In com- PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 17 pliance with this instruction, Gen. George B. McClellan commanding the Army of the Potomac, on March 13th, 1862, issued an order, forming the five corps as follows : First, McDowell ; second, Sumner ; third, Heintzel- man; fourth, Keyes; fifth, Banks. The fourth corps was composed of the divisions of Couch, W. F. Smith, and Casey; the 61st being assigned to Graham's Brigade of Couch's division. This brigade consisted of the following regiments, 65th and 67th New York, 23rd, 31st and 61st Penn sylvania. Couch's division had four batteries of artillery of four guns each. It had fourteen regiments of infantry; two brigades, having five regiments each, and the other four. The Army of the Potomac is now to begin its three year period of unfaltering struggle, of ceaseless carnage, of fadeless glory. Its marches, sieges, battles in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, are to repel inva sion, destroy the armed enemy and save the Union. To this greatest National army the loyal north looks with confidence and stands ready to aid it with more men and money. The soldiers are prepared and wait impatiently the order to advance, being weary of daily reports in the morning papers, \"All quiet on the Potomac,\" and such items as, \"General McClellan rode out to Fairfax Court House and back to-day,\" and \"An intelligent contraband reports rebel activity on the Rappahannock,\" Two important events now stirred the people north and south, in and out of the armies. The rebel forces had successfully retired across the Rappahannock on March 8th, 1862. The next day, March 9th, the famous naval battle was fought at Hampton Roads, between the Monitor and the Merrimac, the Union ships Congress, Cumberland, and Minnesota being destroyed. The day following, March 10th, the Army of the Potomac advanced, Gen. McClellan moving his headquarters to Fairfax Court House. On that day the 61st broke camp near Bladensburg in the morning and marched through Georgetown, over the Chain Bridge and along the Leesburg and Georgetown turnpike to Prospect Hill, a distance of sixteen miles. Here, and in camp nearby, the regiment re mained for five days in a severe rain storm, in which the new equipment was severely tested, and the soldiers found out how sticky was Virginia clay when tramped into mortar, and how perverse camp fires were in damp weather, always managing, regardless of wind, to send the smoke into the men's faces. On this occasion a ration of whiskey was issued, rarely, if ever, to be repeated in the army. Many of the men then tasted liquor for the first time. Whiskey became quite common in the army because of its extensive use in the hospitals. The 61st returned to its old camp near Bladensburg on March 17th, after an absence of a week, in which, toward the end, rations ran short, and hungry soldiers were ready to pay excessive prices for mince pies, without inquiry as to age or lineage. While the 61st was at Prospect Hill, Gen. McClellan, at Fairfax Court House, on March 13, aided by a council of war, decided to move his army to Fortress Monroe and then up the Peninsula to Richmond, with the 18 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT York River on his right, as base for supplies. The President approved the plan, and 400 vessels of all kinds soon appeared at Alexandria, to transport the army to its new field of operations. As the Peninsula campaign is to be memorable in the annals of the 61st, a brief description of the country is necessary. Fortress Monroe, the base of the new movement, is 240 miles from Washington and 92 miles by way of York town from Richmond. The lower end of the Peninsula is bounded southerly by Hampton Roads, and the James River estuary, and southeasterly by Chesapeake Bay and the York River estuary, the two lower points of land, about three miles apart, being Newport News at the mouth of the James, and Old Point Comfort, near Fortress Monroe. The Virginia Peninsula is the land between the James and the York Rivers, both rivers being real arms of the sea the James to City Point, and the York to West Point, the tide and salt water extending to those points. York River begins at West Point, where it is formed by the union of the Mattapony from the north and the Pamunkey from the northwest. The Peninsula proper, ends with a line drawn across from City Point to West Point, although the country above, between the James and the Pamunky Rivers, including Richmond, is called the Upper Peninsula, while below the line, the region is called the Lower Peninsula. This part is flat, and both sandy and marshy, intersected by countless bays, thickly wooded and thinly peopled, while the upper is richer soil, heavier timber, the land more undulating, and the population denser. The width of the Penin sula is from six miles at Yorktown to twenty miles at West Point, and about sixteen miles at Richmond. The Chickahominy River, made famous by the adventures of Capt. John Smith and the Indian maid Pocahontas, divides the upper Peninsula longitudinally. This river, at ordinary stages, is unimportant, flowing sluggishly through wooded swamps, impenetrable thickets, alternating with groves of tall white oaks. After rain storms, the river overflows its banks, forming a sheet of water half a mile wide at many points. The York and Pamunky Rivers are navigable up to White House Landing, a plantation formerly owned by Mrs. Wash ington, and in war times by General Lee. Gloucester Point, opposite Yorktown, was fortified by the rebels so as to obstruct navigation on the York River. There was only one railroad on the Peninsula, which ran from Richmond by way of White House to West Point. Warwick Creek, a swampy stream, taking its rise two miles above Yorktown, runs across the Peninsula to the James, entering the latter river perpendicular to its course. Yorktown, where Lord Cornwallis surrendered to General Washington, is twenty miles from Fortress Monroe and eleven from Williamsburg, a former capital of the Virginia Colony, and the seat of William and Mary College, the oldest university in America, except Harvard, founded during the reign of William and Mary in 1693. The original buildings were designed by Sir Christopher Wren. Thomas Jeffer son, James Monroe, John Marshall, John Tyler and Gen. Winneld Scott PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 19 were graduates of this old university, of which Gen. Washington was chancellor from 1788 to 1799. The red brick college buildings in war times looked ancient to young soldiers. The first structures, however, had nearly all been destroyed by fire and rebuilt. They were seriously damaged during the war of the Rebellion but Congress appropriated money to repair the buildings during the administration of Benjamin Harrison, whose great grandfather lived in Virginia and was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. The institution, after getting the Federal support, continued its honorable career. CHAPTER II. FAIR OAKS. \"The 61st Pennsylvania mourn the loss of all their field officers, the colonel killed, lieutenant- colonel and major wounded and missing. No field officer of that regiment being left to make out its report, I simply attach a statement of casualties at Seven Pines and Fair Oaks, May 31st and June 1st, 1862.\" John J. Abercrombie. Brig. General, commanding brigade in his official report dated Camp near Fair Oaks Station, Va., June 5th, 1862. On March 26, 1862, the 61st moved again, embarking on the leaky steamer \"Wilson Small\" bound for Fortress Monroe. The vessel was overloaded and her officers expecting trouble, distributed the soldiers so as to trim the boat properly, and stationed watchmen to see that the passengers kept still. Fortunately, the weather was good and the trip ended in twenty-four hours, the regiment landing at Hampton Roads, March 27th, the boat going to the bottom the next day. On the morning of March 28th, the scene from Hampton was impres sive. Most of the ancient town had recently been burned and the clouds of ascending smoke indicated that the fires were not yet extinguished. Half a mile from shore out in the harbor, the wreck of the Cumberland, sunk by the Merrimac, was visible, the masts and tangled rigging, above the waves, presenting melancholy evidence of the waning glory of the old wooden navy. To the left toward Fortress Monroe and out a little further, a strange craft appeared. On a flat surface about 200 feet long, sharpened at each end, stood a circular structure which seemed to be 20 feet high and 30 feet in diameter. It resembled an oil tank and was afterwards appropriately called a cheese box. On it stood a man with a telescope, pointing across the Roads toward Norfolk, whence had come the Merri mac on March 8th and 9th, and on the latter day, after a four hours fight, with the strange craft called the Monitor, the terrible confederate ram, retired to appear no more as a fighter. The Army of the Potomac now present for duty at Hampton numbered 102,896. Of this number, 32,924 belonged to the 4th corps; the 61st, as before stated, being in Graham's brigade, Couch's division of that corps. This corps, soon after landing moved over to a point back of Newport News. On April 4, 1862, the army advanced on Yorktown, Couch's PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 21 and Smith's divisions on the left, marching ten miles and camping for the night at Young's Mills near the James River. The 61st was in fine con dition and could have marched ten miles further. The natural scenery along the route was enchanting, as the leaves were half out and the blossoms were bursting forth with all the brilliant hues and tints in that climate of marshy regions, bordering the fresh and salt water. The next morning, April 5th, the troops were on the move by six o'clock, although the rain came down in torrents, continuing all day. The destination that day was Warwick Court House, five miles ahead, where the 61st remained that night, except a detachment sent down the Warwick river on picket, along with other details from the brigade. This old Court House, being the first one, is distinctly remem bered. The building was brick, about twenty-five feet wide and thirty- five feet long, one story high. Inside were some old benches, a desk for the judge, and a witness box, both elevated about two feet. Near the Court House was a brick jail about twelve feet square, with iron bars across the door and the one window. No residences were near, and the whole county seat seemed to consist of this Court House and jail. Where the records of deeds and of judicial and other proceedings incident to local government were kept, we did not learn. This old Warwick seat of justice may be taken as an example of Virginia Court Houses, so often seen by the Union armies during the war, frequently, as at Spottsylvania, furnishing the name for great battles. On April 6th, the 61st, with other troops, moved near Warwick River, toward Lees Mill, where rebel fortifications were encountered and active resistance began. At this time the 61st was short of rations for a few days, owing to the bad roads back to Hampton, but the men made little complaint, believing such experiences unavoidable. The whole army was now stopped by the rebel fortifications, which began at York- town and extended along the Warwick River to the James, a distance of twelve miles. The rebel Gen. J. B. Magruder, an Ex. U. S. officer was in command. Warwick River, so-called, was a small creek, starting two miles above Yorktown and flowing across the Peninsula to the James. Toward the mouth, the stream was broad and deep, having no perceptible current except as affected by the tide. At Lees Mill there was a dam, and another at Winns Mill farther up. The rebels put in three other dams, making the Warwick a slack water stream about fifty feet wide for nearly its entire length, and batteries were placed to protect the dams and pre vent the Union army from crossing. Facing these obstructions for ten days, the 61st, with other regiments aided in building roads and in keeping a close watch along the front, expecting daily to move foward. Mean time batteries were placed in position to bear on the rebel works. On April 16th, the Union guns from Yorktown to Lees Mill were opened as preliminary to a reconnaissance across the Warwick at dam No. 1 in front of Smith's division, 4th Corps, half way between Lees and Winns 22 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT Mills, and half a mile to the right of the position held by the 61st. The movement was made by 200 men from the 3rd Vermont and was successful, the men rushing through the water waist deep and capturing a rebel fort. Not being promptly supported, they fell back, losing half their number. In this movement the Vermonters established a reputation for gallantry, which was to be confirmed on many a bloody field. General Smith, the division commander and veteran of the Mexican War referring to the conduct of the Vermonters, said they showed \"more individual acts of heroism\" than he had ever before seen or read of. Following this affair, the army settled down to a regular siege by means of ditches and parallels, a hundred heavy Parrott guns, mortars and howitzers being established opposite Yorktown and along the War wick River. The 4th Corps, Gen. Keyes, was on the left, Sumner's second corps in the center, and Heintzelman's third corps on the right, extending to the York River. During this period the 61st was in front, doing picket duty, much of the time along the Warwick. On one occasion a detail was out several days, holding an advanced position near the river, but screened by dense foliage. The orders were to make no fires, and for a day or two the direction was observed. But about the third day, no rebels being in sight the desire for hot coffee obscured the danger and weakened the force of military orders. A fire was kindled under a large elm tree with spreading branches, the limbs drooping near the ground, so as to form a cozy bower with a screen excluding all rebel gaze, even with the aid of field glasses. The coffee reached the boiling point, its grateful fragrance suggesting how foolish it was to impose such a long fast when there was no danger. But the smoke had ascended through the foliage informing the rebels that Yankees were under that tree, and the natural consequence ensued. Suddenly a rebel battery, across the narrow stream, opened and sent its missiles crashing through the tree, one shell before long bursting in the branches, sending down a shower of brush and debris into the boiling coffee. The fires were extinguished and a good lesson was learned as to the necessity of obeying orders, even when they seem un necessary. This was the first experience under artillery fire and satis fied the soldiers that such an entertainment should always be declined. The shells, bursting into ragged fragments, differing in size and shape, made a hideous noise as they flew through the air, and the ease with which limbs were cut off, told plainly what would occur if human bodies were struck. Gen. Sherman has truly said that before going under artillery fire, one should have his accounts settled with heaven and earth. The siege went on without special incident to the 61st until the morning of May 4th, when it was discovered the enemy had retreated. The 61st, with other troops of the 4th corps, crossed at Lees Mills and general pursuit was made at once, which resulted in a heavy skirmish that evening at Williamsburg. On the next day, at that place, May 5th, a battle was fought, in which the Union loss was 2,228, and the rebel PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 23 1,560, the enemy retiring in the night toward Richmond. The 61st moved on the 5th to the front line, but was not seriously engaged. The rebels were fortified and merely fought for time to effect removal of their stores further up the Peninsula, while the pursuers hoped to gain decisive advantage by crushing the enemy and capturing guns and material. General McClellan was not present until the fighting ended, when he galloped along the lines, being received with great cheers by the tired soldiers. One feature of this battle, in the light of history is worth men tioning. The real fighters of the army were discovered; Hooker, Han cock and Kearney, the latter to lose his life at Chantilly in the following September. On the rebel side; Gen. Longstreet was the hero, while the two Hills and R. H. Anderson were prominent. This battle was the first ordeal for most of the troops engaged on both sides. It showed great improvement over Bull Run and was actually the beginning of the long struggle between the Army of the Potomac and that of Northern Virginia, in which the latter, after unparalleled sacrifices, was annihilated. The town of Williamsburg was full of rebel wounded. The spacious halls of the College, temporarily converted into a hospital, presented painful sights for uninitiated soldiers, and the dead, swollen and distorted, were gazed upon with horror. The union army was elated, believing a great victory had been won. This battle of Williamsburg was fought within five miles of the historic site of Jamestown, where the first permanent English settlement in the United States had been made in 1607, and the first cargo of slaves landed in 1619. On May 8th, 1862, Keyes' corps advanced up the Penin sula, leading the land forces, about half the army going up the York River in transports to West Point. The 61st marched on the old mail route through Barhamsville, going by Ropers Church and New Kent Court House to Bottom's Bridge. By May 20th, the right of the Union army at New Bridge was within seven miles of Richmond, and its left below Bottom's Bridge on the Chickahominy River was only twelve miles from the rebel capital. The 61st was among the first troops -to reach the Chickahominy, and Companies A and H, Captains Creps and Orr, were the first troops across that river, the enemy retiring before them. By May 24th, Keyes' corps was over the Chickahominy and on the 25th took a position at Seven Pines, on the main turnpike leading to Richmond, and nine miles from that city. The 3rd Corps, Heintzelman's, also crossed; Hooker's division going southward to guard White Oak Swamp, while Kearny's remained in front of Savage's Station. These two corps were on the right bank of the river, the other three corps of Sumner's, Franklin's and Porter's were on the left bank at Gaines Mill. The con solidated returns of the army show an aggregate of 126,089 officers and men present with 280 pieces of field artillery. The two corps in advance, over the river, consisted of four divisions of 6,000 to 8,000 each, with 60 pieces of artillery. The rebels under Gen. J. E. Johnston were very 24 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT active, and skirmishing was going on constantly in front. The place called Seven Pines is at the junction of the Williamsburg and Richmond road with the Nine Mile road, the former road here inclining to the left, going toward the James River, while the latter goes to the right, crossing the Richmond and York River Railroad at Fair Oaks Station, one and a half miles from Seven Pines. Three stations of this railroad were fre quently mentioned. Dispatch, near the Chickahominy bridge, next, Savage, farther on, and then Fair Oaks, nearest to Richmond. The country was marshy and soft after rains. About half the land was cleared and the other half covered with timber and thick underbrush. Obscure country roads leading from one farm to another constituted an inex tricable labyrinth for those not familiar with the locality. Casey's division of the 4th Corps started some fortifications in front of Seven Pines, meantime, on May 30th, Couch's division advanced to Fair Oaks Station, the 61st camping at the little depot building, and that evening Companies G and H, Captains Crosby and Orr, were sent to the front on picket. During the night May 30th-31st, in profound darkness, heavy rains fell, rendering the roads nearly impassable and the fields so soft that artillery wagons sunk to the axles. The rain converted the sluggish Chickahominy into a broad and swift current, overflowing the banks, cutting off approach to the bridges and forming a perilous barrier between the two wings of the Union army. This was the situation May 31, 1862, when the battle of Fair Oaks began. General Johnston's plan was to capture or destroy the four advanced Union divisions of twenty-five thousand men before re-inforcements could reach them from the left bank of the swollen river. The rebels, advancing. along the Williamsburg road, first assailed Casey's division in overwhelming force, driving it back, capturing the new earthworks with some guns. Shortly after noon the hard fighting extended along the entire line to the right, as well as the left of Fair Oaks Station. The 61st stood in line awaiting orders. About noon, an aid of Gen. Couch, the division commander, came to the regiment on horseback. By direc tion of Gen. Couch, the 61st now moved forward toward the left at double quick, taking the road toward Richmond and after going some distance was turned back, passing the 1st Long Island Regiment, entering the woods to its right. As the Regiment entered the woods, Gen. Couch met it and said to Col. Rippey, \"This is a forlorn hope. Hold the enemy back at all hazards.\" The Colonel saluting, said, \"I have the men in my Regiment for such work.\" Gen. Couch was perfectly cool. The coolness of Gen. Couch and the confidence he seemed to have in the 61st, had a good effect on the men, now to engage in their first and bloodiest battle. As the regiment advanced to the front, marching by the flank in fours, the rebels could be seen on the left, driving back Casey's division, through the open fields. Before proceeding far from Fair Oaks Station, the starting point, while the 61st was moving through the woods, a rebel PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 25 column approached from the opposite direction, also moving by the flank. When the heads of these columns were about fifty yards apart, Gen. Couch directed Col. Rippey to file right, move the length of the regiment, then face to the front and attack the advancing rebels, and the General then rode off toward the left. The Colonel, promptly obey ing the order, turned the head of the column to the right, and at the same time the rebel commander, in a clear, strong voice, gave the command \"left by file into line\" and his troops immediately began the movement. When the 61st had moved its length to the right, it halted and faced to the front, and the rebels continuing their movement formed a line parallel to the 61st, facing it about twenty yards distant therefrom. Between the two lines there was some underbrush, but not enough to afford any protection to either side. The rebel column consisted of more than one regiment, as its line of battle, when formed, extended far beyond the right of the 61st. In this position, in obedience to orders from the Colonel, the 61st opened fire on the rebels, which they immediately returned and a terrific struggle began. Early in the fight Col. Rippey was killed; Lieut-Col. Spear was wounded and Major Smith was captured. Ad jutant Miller, having been sent for Companies G and H, was not present, leaving the regiment without any field officers, and most of the line officers, were either killed or wounded. Still the men, with incredible bravery, kept up the fight, disregarding repeated requests to retire of Col. Neill of the 23rd Pennsylvania, whose regiment, to the left of the 61st, had moved back to avoid being flanked. After the retirement of that regiment on the left, the rebels marched by advancing toward Seven Pines. In the meantime, the rebel line, extending to the right of the 61st, outflanked and enveloped that wing of the regiment, sending a column along the rear, demanding that the 61st surrender. Finally, when the regiment had exhausted its ammunition, an order went along the line to fall back, and most of the uninjured started toward the rear, only to run into the rebel line. Instantly a fierce hand-to-hand fight ensued, officers using their swords and revolvers and the men their empty guns as clubs. The con test was necessarily short, as the rebel line in front came rushing over the abandoned position, yelling like fiends and ordering men of the 61st to throw down their arms and surrender. But this demand was unheeded, the rebels in the rear were brushed out of the way, except thirty-five of them, who were swept into the Union line as prisoners. A few of the 61st men were captured because they did not hear the order to retire. Sergeant Oliver A. Parsons of Company D, afterwards Major of the regiment, was one of these. He, with some others, hearing no orders, kept up the fight until they were completely hemmed in on all sides, and their companions no longer in sight. They were disarmed and marched off as prisoners to Richmond. The men who cut their way out, after getting a fresh supply of ammunition, were in line again near Gen. Keyes' head quarters, joining Companies G and H, under Captains Creps and Orr, 26 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT and aided the re-inforcements under Gen. Sumner in repelling the rebel attack on the Union left and staying the enemy's progress for the day. As the 61st moved back, a deadly struggle took place over the flag. Three color bearers had been shot, the last one falling with the flag while the line was moving back, pressed hard toward the right by the oncoming rebels. Private David H. Ford of Company K, seeing the flag go down, ran and picked it up and bore it to the rear, surrounded by about fifty determined men of the regiment, each ready to take the colors if necessary to prevent capture. When Ford grabbed the flag he saw it had been riddled by rebel bullets, the staff also being shattered; still he held the colors up defiantly as he proceeded, the enemy's bullets knocking splinters off the staff and making further rents in the flag, which as a silent witness of a bloody struggle was sent back to Pittsburgh with the body of Col. Rippey. Ford was promoted to color sergeant and received a disabling wound while carrying the flag at Marye's Heights charge, May 3rd, 1863. The severely wounded of the 61st were left on the battlefield for two days with the dead, the other wounded still on the field who could be moved without stretchers, were taken to the rebel field hospitals and enrolled as prisoners. Among the wounded officers of the 61st, taken by the rebels, were Lieut. Col. George C. Spear and Maj. George F. Smith. The helpless wounded remaining on the field were in a most perilous situa tion. The Union troops soon turned on their pursuers and sent a shower of minie balls singing through the woods, endangering and actually hitting many of the wounded, and in not a few instances, putting an end to their suffering. Shells and solid shot also crashed through the timber, one cannon ball cutting a tall pine tree half off about fifty feet from the ground, and after the debris had cleared away, it was observed that the top of the tree leaned over toward the wounded, liable to fall on them at any time. The Union troops that offered this strong resistance in the new line, included those that had been fighting over four hours, sustaining losses so heavy that many of the organizations were broken into frag ments, but the men were game to the end, both infantry and artillery. Gen. Webb in his \"The Peninsula,\" page 107, referring to these soldiers says: \"The line was formed of companies, regiments and parts of regiments, fragments of divisions and brigades, which had lost their integrity in the fierce fight of the afternoon. Casey, Couch, Kearney, Birney were all represented, and the men stood firm, shoulder to shoulder in the fading light.\" This ended the first day at Fair Oaks, a battle fought by two-fifths of the army, with Gen. McClellan, the commander-in-chief, back at Gaines Mill on the north side of the Chickahominy, with the other three-fifths, except one division under Gen. Sumner. On June 1st, the rebels were PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 27 driven back and the Union troops took substantially the position they held before the fight began. The 61st had little part in the fight on the second day, but resumed a position near Fair Oaks Station, not far from that occupied by it in the morning of May 31st. The losses of the 61st, as officially reported by Gen. E. D. Keyes, the Corps commander, under date of June 13, 1862, were as follows: Officers killed, 5; wounded, 9; missing, 4. Men killed, 65; wounded, 143; missing, 39; total 263. Three of the officers and 21 of the men were mortally wounded and soon died. The actual loss therefore, was, killed 92, wounded 132 , of whom four were captured; missing 39, total 263. The officers killed were, Col. Oliver H. Rippey, Capt. Joseph Gerard, Company K; First Lieutenants John Pollock, Company A; William Scott, Company B; and Alfred Moylan, Company I. In \"Regimental Losses in the American Civil War\" by Col. Wm. F. Fox, published in 1889, the author furnishes statistics of vast importance concerning casualties in individual regiments of infantry, artillery and cavalry. This work has always been regarded as semi-official, for the author had access to all government records and other sources of authentic information. On page 37 Col. Fox says; the 61st took into the battle of Fair Oaks 574 men and the loss was 55.4 per cent. On page 274 he says, the total loss was 263, and that the killed numbered 92. These figures indicate some error, as 55.4 per cent of 574 would show a loss of 317 instead of 263, a discrepancy of 54. This may be accounted for to some extent by the fact that only eight companies of the regiment were in the fight where the Colonel was killed; the other two companies, G and H, having been on picket the night before, were detained for ser vice on other parts of the field, especially at the new line mentioned by Gen. Webb. Apparently the loss of the regiment, as given by Gen. Keyes, of 263, did not include losses if any, sustained by Companies G and H. In Vol. II Bates History, Pennsylvania Volunteers, 408, the author says, the 61st loss at Fair Oaks was \"11 officers and 269 men,\" total 280, whereas the actual loss in officers was 16, counting killed, wounded and missing. Obviously, these figures are irreconcilable; even the official statistics when thoroughly sifted, may leave doubt as to the losses of the 61st at Fair Oaks. How many of the 39 missing were wounded and died of their injuries, and how many came back as exchanged prisoners, does not appear in any available publication. James M. Walker of Company A, kept a diary during the three years of his services and a synopsis of his notes was published in 1880 in a book called \"History of Indiana County, Pa.\" This history, and the diary Mr. Walker has kindly turned over to the historian. The information is valuable in the highest degree, and the facts are accurately and clearly stated, as shown where verification has been practicable. Mr. Walker says the 61st lost at Fair Oaks all its field officers and all the line officers except twelve were killed, wounded, or prisoners. 28 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT The loss of the 61st at Fair Oaks was greater than any other regiment in that battle and only ten other regiments in the whole war had greater losses in single battles. The total losses at Fair Oaks were, killed, 790; wounded, 3,594; missing, 647; total 5,031. More than 11 per cent, of the killed were in the 61st. It is interesting to note that in the entire battle, for every one killed, more than four were wounded, about the usual proportion; while in the 61st, the killed numbered 92 and the wounded only 132, a startling mortality, which is accounted for in part by the short range, the absence of all protection between the lines, the fact that wounded were killed by fire from the new Union position in the rear, but the high death rate is due chiefly to the sturdy determination of the 61st to stay and fight it out to the last man. If the killed and wounded in the 61st had been on the usual basis, as above indicated, the figures would be, killed 92, wounded, 368; missing, 39; total, 499; being over 80 per cent, of the men engaged. In a book entitled, \"Numbers and Losses in the Civil War\" pub lished by Houghton, Mifflin & Company in 1900, interesting statistics are given and suggestive comparisons are made. On pages 81 and 140, it is said the Union force actually engaged at Fair Oaks, numbered 41,797, and the rebel force numbered 41,816, that the Union killed and wounded numbered 4,384 and the rebel 5,729, that out of every 1000 in the Union army, 105 were hit, and out of every 1000 in the rebel army, 137 were hit. It is not necessary to pursue further the subject of losses of the 61st at Fair Oaks, but it is proper to state the reasons why a single regiment was placed in such an exposed position and there apparently abandoned by the officers in command and allowed to be cut to pieces by superior forces of the enemy in front, on both flanks and later in the rear. Though hard on the regiment, the movement was undoubtedly justified by the exigencies of the battle and was good generalship on the part of the dis tinguished division commander, General Couch, for whom every member of the 61st always cherished the warmest affection. On the left, Casey's division, after hard fighting, had retired, and the heroic Kearney with his division was in peril from the oncoming victorious rebels, threatening to push the whole Union left into the Chickahominy. On the Union right a heavy force of rebels were advancing and no troops in sight to offer any resistance. In the meantime, the brave old Sumner, was forc ing his first division under Sedgwick, over the unstable bridge and through the deep mud toward the sound of battle. If Sumner could get on to the field and the second Union line could be formed, the rebels might be stopped and the army saved. But time was necessary and it must be exacted of the enemy at any cost. A crisis existed requiring prompt decision and instant action. The Union leaders were equal to the demand. Instead of going back, they advanced with the 61st and other troops into the woods to meet the foe, and when the PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 29 struggle was on, no officers or orderlies could get near the scene of con flict with fresh orders. There was only one course possible, and that was to let the soldiers fight it out while the officers arranged strong opposition in the rear through a new position and re-inforcements. This was good tactics, and the brave officers did not leave the field, but gallantly faced the enemy in the second line. Keyes, Heintzelman, Casey, Couch, Kerney, Birney, Abercrombie, the brigade commander, and others, swords in hand, encouraged the men to hold the new position whether they had ammunition or not. Fragments of the 61st as before stated, joined this line after their terrific struggle, and saw the dashing rebels sullenly retire out of range, as darkness put an end to the furious conflict. Official reports of the Corps, division and brigade commanders, speak in high terms of the 61st. Gen, Keyes in his report, referring to the 23rd P. V. and the 61st, said, \"These two regiments assailed a vastly superior force of the enemy and fought with extraordinary bravery.\" The casualties in the 61st amounted to 263 and are heavier than in any other regiment in Couch's division. Gen. Abercrombie commanding the brigade, referring to the fight near Fair Oaks Station, said in his report dated June 5th, 1862, \"The dead of the enemy on the portion of the battle-field occupied by the 1st Long Island, 23rd and 61st Pennsylvania, are the proofs I have of the gallantry displayed by those regiments.\" A discussion of the rebel losses at Fair Oaks would be interesting, but the reader is referred to general histories for that, except a quotation from \"Reminiscences of the Civil War\" by Gen. John B. Gordon, who attacked the Union lines on May 31st, and tells on page 58 how roughly he was handled: \"The losses were appalling, all the field officers, except myself, had been killed, of 44 officers of the line, but 13 were left for duty. Nearly two- thirds of the entire command were killed or wounded. My young brother, who had been shot through the lungs, was carried back with the wounded. My horse and all others in the regiment were killed.\" Referring to the termination of the battle of Fair Oaks, Gen. Webb in his book, already referred to, says on page 116: \"The attempt of the rebels to drive the left wing into the Chickahominy, and cut McClellan's line of supply from White House, which opened with every prospect of success, was turned first into failure and then into disaster, which sent them back to Richmond in a panic on the night of June 1st.\" The authentic acts of heroism and other thrilling personal incidents of this great struggle, which established a high record for the 61st, would fill a volume, but then, perhaps the most interesting would go unmen- tioned for lack of definite information. The following particulars are to be taken as representative of hundreds of others quite as important, of which the historian is not informed. Sergeant Major W. J. Glenn, after- 30 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT wards one of the five different captains of Company E, later Colonel in the Spanish-American War, was near Col. Rippey when that brave officer gave his last command, starting the bloody battle, as follows: \"Ready, aim, fire.\" It was not long until the colonel was shot and fell to the ground. His body was not recovered until Monday, June 2nd, when he was sent home with the colors. The regiment seemed to melt away and the fire slackened, as men were killed and disabled. Col. Rippey's last command was a peculiarly fitting termination for the career of the brave officer. Glenn, himself, was soon shot through the right leg, but did not leave the field until the regiment retired. He then hobbled back through the enclosing rebel line, growing weaker from loss of blood. His gait was accelerated, after reaching the open, by seeing a strong column of rebels marching down the Nine Mile road, their guns at \"right shoulder shift, route step,\" as if the Yankees had all vanished. Before proceeding far, he saw a heavy Union line of battle which after firing one shot, charged the rebel troops with a great cheer and drove them back. These were Gen. Sumner's soldiers who had bravely crossed the Chickahominy on a floating bridge that afternoon and hastened through mud and swamps to the support of the hard pressed fighters of the 3rd and 4th Corps. Sergeant-Major Glenn, stopped in an old barn to have his wound dressed, one of his fellow sufferers being Gen. O. O. Howard, who had lost an arm. Praise of the 61st regiment, for its part in the battle of Fair Oaks would be quite superfluous. One might as well commend the \"embattled farmers\" who stood at Concord and \"fired the shot heard around the world.\" If the history of the 61st regiment ended with June 2, 1862, it would stand high on the roll of honor, and its fame would be cherished by the Nation and the State as a precious heritage, affording distinction for all time to the descendants of the men who fought in the swamp and valiantly held back a triumphant foe until assistance arrived. Yet the battle of Fair Oaks was only the beginning of a career to end at Appo- mattox when an iron band was drawn tight around the rebellion, exting uishing its life. After the battle of Fair Oaks, by order of Gen. Abercrombie, Lieut- Col. Frank Vallee was assigned temporarily to the command of the 61st, which then had no field officers present for duty. By direction of this new regimental commander, Companies C and I were distributed to other companies for the reason that these two companies were left without any commissioned officers and had suffered severely in the loss of non-com missioned officers and privates. CHAPTER III. « MALVERN HILL— ANTIETAM \"The sun of September 18th, 1862, at Antietam rose to light up one of those scenes of suffering and anguish which humbled the pride of man by the exhibition of his weakness and cruelty. Twenty thousand men killed or wounded the day before were lying on that narrow battlefield. Their com rades were exhausted by the struggle, by fatigue and by the want of both sleep and food.\" Comte De Paris. Many of the soldiers wounded at Fair Oaks were sent north in hospital steamers from the White House on the Pamunkey River; to this point they were transported from the battlefield in box cars at the rate of about a thousand each day. On the afternoon of June 6th some of the 61st wounded with many others, were put on board the hospital steamer Louisiana at White House Landing, bound for Philadelphia. The steamer, with its precious load of sufferers, started the next day but made slow progress, getting out of the narrow stream into the York River and then by Old Point up around through the Chesapeake Bay, ascending the Delaware River to the City of Brotherly Love, where it arrived on June 12th. Such a vast number of wounded as this steamer contained had never before landed in the city at one time, and being advised in advance of the progress of the vessel, the people made ample, even lavish preparation to receive the wounded soldiers. Having but few ambulances, a notice was published in the papers asking owners of vehicles to be on hand and help move the disabled men to the various hospitals. As the steamer came in sight, down the river, bells rang all over the city giving the prearranged signal, and thereupon ambulances, carriages, express wagons, moving vans and even drays and carts hastened to the dock and stood ready for any required service. These people filled up all the space along the dock and extended up into the lower end of the streets, the drivers quietly gazing at the steamer as she slowly swung into place. Thousands of anxious people crowded around as near as they could approach the steamer, removing their hats as the wounded were carried by. Many of the people were looking for friends and scanned with deep solicitude each soldier as he was borne along. One member of the 61st in a perfectly helpless condition was carried to an express wagon whose bed proved to be too short. A longer and more suitable wagon was 32 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT obtained, to which he was removed, with apologies for not getting a proper conveyance at once. Two men besides the driver went along to South and 24th Street Hospital, one of the men on the way obtaining information for a beautiful and sympathetic letter to the soldier's mother, which is still treasured as a memento. Arriving at the hospital, this member of the 61st received every possible attention from the doctors and nurses. After his clothes were changed and nourishing food provided, including strawberries and cream, a lady came around with a portfolio and writing materials to take messages for home. This woman, bright and cheery, intelligent and versatile, was none other than Mrs. Henry Gary Baird, whose husband was then a most distinguished citizen with a national reputation as an author and publisher. The kindness shown this member of the 61st was extended to thousands of others from all parts of the country and it was kept up until the war ended. The people also showed their patriotism by raising vast sums for the Sanitary and Christian Commissions, by subscribing for millions of government bonds in the darkest days of the Rebellion and establishing the first national bank in the United States. Phila delphia deserves the measureless gratitude of every Union soldier during the war and of every American citizen from that day on to the end of time. After the battle of Fair Oaks the Union Army occupied the field and fortified a position extending from Goldings on the right, near Duane's Bridge, to White Oak Swamp on the left, a distance as the line ran of about five miles. Franklin's corps held the right, Sumner's the center and Heintzelman's the left, Keyes' corps being in reserve near Savage Station; Porter's corps with McCall's division remained on the left bank of the Chickahominy, covering the region from Mechanicsville to a point below Gaines Mill. The base of supplies was still at White House on the Pamun- key River, the Richmond and York River Railroad connecting that point with the front. The weather until about June 20th was extremely unfavorable for military operations, the Chickahominy overflowed its banks to an un paralleled extent, sweeping away all the bridges but the railroad, whose frail scaffolding trembled over the turbulent flood. The ground, com posed of alternate layers of clay and quicksand, was really a vast swamp. Vehicles, especially artillery, could be moved with the greatest difficulty, the wheels sinking deep in the mire and soon stalling any number of will ing horses. In the morning the sun came out hot, filling the air with poisonous exhalations from the dead bodies of men and animals. The heat became suffocating. While the army was thus condemned to inactivity in movements, the men were not idle. Each day details worked on the fortifications, made roads, repaired bridges, while strong, aggressive picket lines ex tended from right to left of the entire line, keeping up a ceaseless and PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 33 resounding fusillade. Three weeks of this life made sad havoc among the men, who in vast numbers were taken with swamp and typhoid fever, many dying, while others required hospital treatment. However, the expectation of taking Richmond and ending the war kept the men hope ful and ever ready for any service. The 61st camped near Savage Station under command of Lieut. Col. Vallee assigned to this command from the 82nd Pa. Vol. of the same brigade, doing its share of picket and other duty, but suffering a great deal from sickness owing in part to the close proximity of the great White Oak Swamp, whose northerly borders were near its camp. The regiment was still in the same brigade, commanded by Gen. Abercrombie, Gen. Couch having the division and Gen. Keyes the 4th corps, Gen. Peck succeeding to the command of Casey's division. The vSeven Days' Battle, so called, began June 25th, 1862, with a reconnaissance along the Williamsburg Road in front of Seven Pines to Oak Grove, four miles from Richmond. The next day, the 26th, the fight was at Mechanicsville on the extreme right; then followed on the 27th the great Battle of Gaines Mill; the 28th had little beyond heavy skir mishing; the 29th saw two engagements, one at Savage Station and the other at Allen's Farm, otherwise known as Peach Orchard. In these engagements on the 29th the rebel general Magruder used a heavy long- range noisy cannon, mounted on a flat car. This contrivance the rebels called the Land Merrimac, and strange to relate, like the great water prototype, after appearing twice it retired to that peaceful bourne whence no traveller returns by land or water. The 30th there was heavy fighting on Frazier's Farm, at White Oak Swamp, the battle including bloody struggles at Glendale and the various cross-roads at that place and extending clear over to Turkey Bend on the James River. The last battle was at Malvern Hill July 1st, after which the army moved down the James seven miles to Harrison's Landing, where it remained until the middle of August. When the seven days' fight began, the army numbered 92,500 of all arms. This general state ment is made that the services of the 61st may be better understood in the operations referred to. In these movements, which carried the army from the Chickahominy, seven miles from Richmond, to Harrison's Landing on the James River, twenty miles from the rebel capital, and changed the base of operations from the White House to Harrison's Landing, Keyes' corps took an important and perilous part, in protecting the movement through White Oak Swamp. The entire army, with 4,000 wagons, 500 ambulances, 350 pieces of artillery and 2,500 head of cattle, moved southerly through this swamp on the way to the James River. The great marsh known as White Oak Swamp, on the left of the Union army, was over five miles wide, extending as before stated, from the Chickahominy toward Richmond to a point in advance of Seven Pines. It was covered with tangled under brush and had no paths up and down. One road crossed it from the 34 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT Williamsburg turnpike, starting near Bottom's Bridge, and Gen. Keyes discovered another old and obscure pathway leading across from Savage Station on the railroad. Both of these roads ended in the clearings called Frazier's Farm, after crossing a bridge spanning the stream which drained the marsh emptying into the Chickahominy at Turner's Bridge. This stream is itself called White Oak Swamp. About two miles toward the James from Frazier's Farm is Charles City Crossroads, where many highways join; one coming from White Oak Swamp is continued as the Quaker Road to Malvern Hill. The Charles City, the Central and New market roads come in from Richmond, the latter two uniting three miles away. Numerous other roads are here leading toward the Chickahominy and the James. Toward Richmond from the Charles City Crossroads is a vast open section consisting of several cultivated farms, called Glendale, where the main battle was fought June 30th. Near the James River at Turkey Bend, two miles away, is Malvern Hill, made memorable by the engagement of July 1st. During the night of June 27th, after the Union defeat at Gaines Mill, Keyes was ordered to move his corps through White Oak Swamp toward the James, protecting the right flank of the army from rebel attack. On the same day, while the fight was in progress at Gaines Mill, Companies A and H of the 61st were sent forward in advance and to the left of Seven Pines in consequence of rebel activity at that point. The companies were deployed as skirmishers and before proceeding far met a rebel line of battle which forced them back, one man in Company A being wounded. The colonel of the 55th N. Y., assuming the skirmish line had retreated too easily, advanced with his whole regiment, receiving a bloody repulse, when a whole brigade was found necessary to stop the bold rebel attack. The movement of Keyes' corps began at once and by the morning of June 29th the 61st, in a dense bank of fog, was at Frazier's Farm across the White Oak Swamp, and the corps, after driving away some rebel cavalry at Charles City Crossroads, camped near there at Nelson's farm for the night. Pickets and scouts were kept well out toward Richmond on all the roads. Meanwhile the trains of the entire army moved through the swamp on the main road nearest the Chickahominy, while most of the troops marched along the old and more exposed road starting near Savage vStation, which road was cleared of fallen trees and other obstructions by Keyes' men as they advanced. The weather was stifling and for most of the way the column moved through a cloud of dust. The roar of battle was constantly heard in the rear, with occasionally explosions of large quantities of ammunition, which could not be moved from Savage Station. The trains were in motion all night, and when some teams stopped to feed, others were pressed forward, going two to three abreast when space permitted. During the night of the 29th, Keyes' corps, on. being relieved at Glen- PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 35 dale by Porter's, moved toward the James River at Haxall's Landing, arriving on the 30th, in the morning. The sight of this majestic river to the weary dust-covered soldiers, emerging from a dreary hot swamp, was enchanting; many rushed into the sparkling water to refresh themselves and make sure they were not the victims of a delusive mirage. In a short time, on the arrival of other troops, Keyes' corps moved out toward Malvern Hill and occupied the space between the James River at Turkey Bend on the left and Malvern Hill on the right. This was the left of the Union line at the battle of Glendale, the right being at Frazier's Farm at the crossing of the White Oak Swamp. The line was a large arc of a circle, with the convexity toward Richmond. The rebel general Jackson had followed the Union army through White Oak Swamp, but his attack on Gen. Franklin's corps at that point was easily repulsed. Meantime Longstreet and Hill came down the Charles City, the Central and the Newmarket roads, and attacked at Glendale and farther over to ward the James. The struggle was fierce, lasting until after dark, but the rebels were repulsed at all points and by four o'clock in the afternoon the last wagons of the long train had reached Malvern Hill. That night the Union army moved back to Malvern Hill and got ready for the closing encounter of the Seven Days' battles. This bloody conflict of June 30th 1862, has many names because of the different places on the field where combats occurred, as Frazier's Farm, White Oak Swamp, Charles City Crossroads, Nelson's Farm and Glendale, the latter being the more com prehensive and appropriate designation for the engagement. Before daybreak on July 1st, the Union army was concentrated around the approaches to Malvern Hill in a defensive position, admirably adapted for the use of artillery. This hill was two miles long and a mile wide. The army was formed as follows: at the extreme left Porter's corps guarded the direct approaches from Richmond to Haxall's Land ing; Couch's division, including the 61st, came next, having been detached from the 4th Corps. This division was deployed midway between the summit of Malvern Hill and the woods bordering its base, the right resting upon a deep wooded ravine separating the Union left from the center. Over the ravine, farther to the right, was Heintzelman's corps, which extended across the Quaker Road; then farther toward the right was Sumner's corps, with Franklin on its right, and Keyes with the other two divisions held the extreme right. More than sixty pieces of artillery were placed on the line held by Porter and Couch, with ten siege guns at the Crewe House commanding a large portion of the battlefield, other guns being in good positions on the line. The artillery was commanded by Col. Henry J. Hunt, an officer of great merit, as subsequently demon strated on many a battlefield. The Army of the Potomac, fully con centrated, was to fight its first battle with all the corps present. Its line, in a half circle, stretched from Turkey Bridge over Western Run on the left above Malvern Hill, around to Haxall's Landing below, each flank 36 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT covering the approaches to the James River. The navy was represented in the river behind the battle line, and the gunboat Galena was used by Gen. McClellan for a reconnaissance during part of the day. The vessels took position so as to support the field artillery, and several took part by throwing hundred-pound shells into the rebel position, causing conster nation by the terrific explosions. The rebel army was also concentrated and Jefferson Davis came down from Richmond to see the Union army crushed, remaining through out the conflict. At break of day Jackson crossed the White Oak Swamp bridge, the scene of his unsuccessful battle of the day before, passed over the battlefield of Glendale and reached Malvern Hill on the Turkey road. Magruder and Huger proceeded against the Union left, while Hill and Longstreet were in easy supporting distance. Little fighting, except with artillery, occurred until the afternoon, when the rebels attacked the right of Couch's division, seeking to break the Union line at the wooded ravine. This attack was repulsed with heavy loss to the rebels, and Couch advanced part of his line nearly half a mile. The 61st, near the Crewe House, supporting Griffin's batteries, was under heavy artillery fire in the forenoon, a shell killing one man and wounding two. Later the regiment took position in the rear of the Union batteries, in a road, slightly sunken, which afforded some pro tection. Still later in the afternoon the regiment, with other troops, advanced down the ravine on its right, waded through a marshy bog and crept into position on the flank of the rebels as they came forward against the Union batteries. The rebels, taken by surprise, were thrown into confusion and suffered fearful carnage before they could get back out of range. The 61st then went back near the Crewe House in advance of the Union batteries, to keep down rebel sharpshooters. The men lay flat on the ground while the artillery fired over them at the rebels beyond. At times the batteries ceased and the regiment rose and fired, frequently advancing to dislodge bold rebels seeking to pick off the Union gunners. It was at this point, according to a rebel account, that their men were most reluctant to advance on the Union position. A rebel colonel, urging his men forward toward evening, after several bloody repulses, shouted, \"Come on, come on, my men! Do you want to live forever?\" In this position the 61st remained until the field was cleared of the enemy and the regiment was out of ammunition, having fired sixty rounds. Bearing in mind that the 61st was in Abercrombie's brigade, Couch's division defending the main position held by Griffin's batteries near the Crewe House, with a magnificent view for three-quarters of a mile in front, one can understand the part taken by the men from Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Indiana and Luzerne counties in the closing four hours of this great battle. Gen. Couch, in his official report of the battle says: The enemy were now massing large columns on our front. At 4:30 P. M., after an incessant cannonade, they boldly pushed forward a PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEERS 37 large column from their right in the open field to carry Griffin's position. The fire of the three batteries was concentrated upon them. Kingsbury's battery having been withdrawn for ammunition, was relieved by three guns of Battery C Rhode Island artillery, and two guns, Allen's 5th Massachusetts, under Capt. Weeden. The attacking column kept on, continually reinforced, until within range of Griffin's rifles, when it stopped and formed line. From this time until 8 P. M., there was enacted one of the sublimest sights ever presented in war, resulting in a glorious victory to our arms. \"But the action now being general, I assumed command of the whole line for the time, ordered up the reserves on the left, placed in position regiments falling back, and halted those bravely moving forward, many of the regiments having already masked the fire of our artillery. Upon seeing the rebels advance on the left, Abercrombie and Palmer pushed forward their brigades in front of the artillery, in order to drive back the foe. The enemy continually reinforced their column of attack, besides advancing heavy reserves in support. Abercrombie and Palmer became engaged to the left and right. Gen. Colwell, of Richardson's division, having been sent to my support by Gen. Sumner, now went into action, joining my brave division fiercely engaged. The enemy were making desperate efforts to drive in my right. Gen. Heintzelman sent me Seeley's battery, which, under De Russy, chief of his artillery, and with the advice of Gen. Howe, was established on the ground held by this latter officer. It did its duty well. \"Gen. Porter came upon the ground about 6 P. M. ; later Gen. Sickles, of Hooker's division, reported to me with three regiments, leading his men directly into action, relieving some of my division whose ammunition was exhausted. At about 7 P. M., Gen. Meagher, with his brigade, re ported to me from Sumner, and was pushed to the left of Griffin's battery. Night closed upon us still fighting, the opposing forces only known by their lines of fire, that of the rebels gradually slackening until 8:30 P. M., after which an occasional cannon shot from our batteries only broke the stillness that pervaded this bloody field. Thus ended the Battle of Mal- vern Hill, which caused great carnage and demoralization among the best divisions of the enemy, with comparatively small loss on our side. General, Abercrombie and Palmer formed a line with their brigades that not a private retreated from.\" Gen. Abercrombie, referring to his brigade at Malvern Hill and mentioning the 61st, says, \" All acquitted themselves in a highly com mendable manner.\" He says his brigade was \"under fire from early morning until dark.\" The burden of this battle fell on Porter's corps and Couch's division on the Union left. The rebels assailed this position three different times advancing with great resolution and persisting until cut to pieces by our artillery and infantry fire. Finally, after dark, the 38 SIXTY-FIRST REGIMENT battle ceased along the entire line, the rebels having failed at every point to break through the Union lines. From the position of the 61st, in advance of the batteries, the rebels could be seen plainly as they came forward, facing the smashing dis charges of the Union guns, urged on by the officers until the Union infantry began to fire, when the lines wavered and broke. The Count of Paris, in describing the latter part of this battle, in which the1 61st took part, says: \"More than once the Federal lines have seemed on the point of being charged and broken, so great is the impetuosity of the assailants, but .at the last moment the latter are always checked and compelled to rede- scend those fatal slopes already covered with the dead bodies of their comrades. The last rays of the setting sun, gilding the tree- tops and the smoking heights of Malvern, light up this bloody scene. In the center D. H. Hill has given up the contest, but Magruder, loath to resign himself to this cruel reverse, persists in continuing the fight. It is only toward nine o'clock that the booming of cannon gradually dies away along the entire line,"
