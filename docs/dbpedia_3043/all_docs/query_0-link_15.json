        "text": "01063v.jpg\n\nThis is not the Martin Shealer barn Confederate field hospital. No photo was available. However, this is a photograph of a field hospital after the battle of June 27 in Savage Station, Va., in 1862. (Library of Congress)\n\nA few weeks ago we asked about your connections to Gettysburg.\n\nWe asked you to share stories of your relatives or descendants who fought in the great battle or stories that connected you to the town itself while the battle was taking place.\n\nWe had several submissions and will be publishing them over the next week.\n\nToday, Dennis Shealer writes about his great great grandfather enlisting at 41 years old. He never fought in Gettysburg but when he returned to his home near Gettysburg, he found it being utilized as a Confederate field hospital.\n\nBy Dennis G. Shealer, Philipsburg, Pa.\n\nMy great great grandfather Martin Shealer was born near Dillsburg, Pa. in 1821 but he f\n\nwas raised in Straban Township, outside of Gettysburg. Martin was the illegitimate son of an Esther Bash and David Schuler or Sheeler or Shealer. He was believed to be raised by a Stephen Wible and his wife Julianne. Martin kept the last name Shealer/Sheeler.\n\nIn 1843 Martin married Amanda Goulden/Golden and after buying a farm near where he grew up Martin and Amanda started their own family. They eventually they had ten children that lived to be adults -- five other children died between infancy and the age of four.\n\nAfter the start of the Civil War Martin Shealer, at age 41, enlisted in the 165th Regiment of the Pa. Volunteers Militia. It was October 1862. His tour of duty was in the Suffolk, Va. area as well as defense of the Capitol, Washington, D.C. His unit remained in the Washington, D.C. area and did not participate in the Battle of Gettysburg. Martin was discharged July 28, 1863 and returned to Gettysburg.\n\nHowever, during the Battle of Gettysburg the family farm and barn were used as a Confederate Field Hospital -- this has been documented in the following books:\n\nWhen Martin Shealer returned home he not only found wounded Confederate soldiers still being attended to in the barn but also that about 50 Confederate dead soldiers were buried in a meadow near the barn. Martin and Amanda continued to assist the wounded until they were removed to other facilities or prisons. The Confederate dead remained buried until the 1870s-1880s when they were disinterred and taken to the Confederate Cemetery named Hollywood, which was located in Richmond, Va.\n\nDuring the Civil War, men with military experience were often paid to take another \"drafted\" man's place in the service. In Sept. 1864 Martin, now 4, and having seven children was offered $100 to $200 and \"re-enlisted\" in the Pa. 184th Regiment Infantry. His service campaign consisted of the following areas or battles in Virginia: Petersburg, Hatcher's Run and eventually Lee's surrender at Appomattox.\n\nThe 184th eventually marched back to Washington, D.C. and participated in the Grand Review in May 1865. Martin Shealer was honorably discharged in July 1865, now 44 years of age. He suffered no wounds but like many Civil War soldiers he contracted various diseases that eventually affected his liver and kidneys. He also had typhoid fever that permanently blinded him in one eye.\n\nIn 1889 Martin started the process for applying for an \"Invalid\" pension which he finally received in July 1891. He was awarded a pension of $12 per month until his death on June 27, 1903.\n\nI would like to thank the following people who have worked hard compiling much of this info: Lissy Weirich from Carlisle, Pa., and Erin McCleaf Bolling from Yorktown, Va."
