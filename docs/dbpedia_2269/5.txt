Message: To my dear family,

Regardless of what I say, it will never be enough to describe the love and appreciation that I have for this man. He is the reason my baptism request was fulfilled 11 years ago, and I'll never forget him.

Prayers of comfort and strength during this difficult time.

Rest in heaven, Sir, until we meet again.

Love always,

Message: This pillar in the earth is not here amongst the earth any longer. From my earliest memories I recall going down for our families to come together for fellowship, work, chores or just to play. I affectionately called him daddy. This man lived the life that others could follow. He kept a standard that mentored and counseled many. He has received his heavenly rest and for that we can give thanks.
