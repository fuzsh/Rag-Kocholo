        "text": "As a 17-year, four-time, stage IV lung cancer survivor, Christy has dedicated countless hours and traveled extensively to tell her story and represent the Lung Association bringing each audience to tears, laughter, and standing ovation.\n\nChristy’s work with the Lung Association started in 2016 when she joined the Local Leadership Board to help launch the Fight for Air Climb and the LUNG FORCE Gala. Seven years later the Local Leadership Board in Kansas City is flourishing, and Christy is at the heart of that success.\n\nThe Board has grown to twenty members and earned a “Gold” recognition through our Gold Standard Program in 2023. The Fight for air Climb and LUNG FORCE Gala have become high-profile events, and the market revenue is on track to exceed this year’s revenue goal.\n\nChristy’s most recent endeavors for the Lung Association combine her professional expertise, personal network, and mission to raise dollars and awareness. Christy leverages her personal network of executive leaders to engage in letter writing fundraising campaigns of support for the LUNG FORCE Gala, join event committees, and host lunch & learns to national audiences during Lung Cancer Awareness Month. Christy’s relationship with AMC’s Board Chair opened the door to launch a nationwide PSA on Vaping with AMC Theater, which aired at 380 theaters in 2019 and again in 2023 resulting in $4 million in-kind donation. Christy also quickly closed two cause campaigns that will launch this year with a fast casual restaurant and a 25-location grocery chain.\n\nChristy’s story is one that resonates and prompts action and commitment to the fight against lung cancer. Christy often says that she was chosen to have lung cancer for a reason, and that she knows she is meant to tell her story, raise research dollars, and create awareness. No one would ever know that she is currently undergoing treatment for her fourth recurrence of lung cancer! In 2006, Christy was given a 2% chance of living the next four months. She didn’t hear a 98% of dying, but rather a 2% chance of LIVING…and look at her now! Christy – 4 : Lung cancer – 0!!\n\nWe are incredibly blessed that Christy has chosen the Lung Association to dedicate her time, talent, and treasures.\n\nKevin Stewart began his long and valued career at a small affiliate office in Lancaster, PA in 1987. For 37 years, Kevin has maintained a steadfast dedication to the mission of the American Lung Association. His leadership efforts include championing initiatives to inform the public about air pollution, its health effects, its sources and means of control.\n\nKevin has an engineering background and an incisive technical mind. One of his most valuable contributions has been his ability to digest complex scientific information, analyze data, identify errors or misleading arguments and clearly and thoroughly communicate his findings to others. He has regularly represented the Lung Association through prepared comments and testimony before federal, state, regional and local agencies engaged in public policy on clean indoor and outdoor air and climate change. His expertise on a broad range of topics have given him the credibility to advocate on issues as varied as outdoor wood boilers, anti-idling measures and school indoor air in Pennsylvania to national energy policy and improving the public’s right to know about environmental and public health threats.\n\nBeyond disseminating knowledge, Kevin actively serves the broad mission, engaging with the board, colleagues, volunteers, and the public. He stays abreast of current trends and topics relating to our air quality efforts, ensuring that our strategies remain relevant and effective. His leadership on reducing the public health threat from radioactive radon gas has been especially impactful.\n\nThrough teamwork, he ensures that everyone understands the rationale behind our decisions and initiatives. He listens attentively to input from all stakeholders, regardless of their title or affiliation. Kevin’s dedication to thoroughly evaluating sentiments, conducting rigorous research, and providing actionable solutions underscores his commitment to serving the interests of all involved.\n\nHe is an exemplar of the concept of servant leadership, in which the most effective leaders strive to serve others, rather than accrue power or take control. His dedication to providing the highest level of service infuses everything he does for the Lung Association, our partners and our constituents. That commitment makes him stand out as a leader, even though he would never describe his role that way.\n\nKevin has dedicated his career to the mission of the American Lung Association, and he very much takes to heart the idea that the mission will not be achieved unless all people in the U.S. have equal access to healthy air and healthy lungs.\n\nChrissy Cohen has led the Ft. Lauderdale office to become one of the highest revenue producing offices in the country. Under Chrissy’s leadership, the Ft. Lauderdale market has increased net revenue by an impressive 61%. Chrissy serves as a peer mentor to colleagues in sponsorships with her exceptional skillset in not only securing but maintaining sponsors. Chrissy has a very impressive retention rate of her sponsors through her ability to adapt her proposals outside of standard benefits to meet the needs of the partner and further advance our mission. In her five years on staff, out of the 41 field development markets nationwide, Ft. Lauderdale has moved from 16th highest producing market to the 2nd highest producing in net revenue.\n\nChrissy has an unparalleled approach to serving others and relationship-building with volunteers and donors alike. She not only aims to execute with the utmost professionalism but also takes into account the most nuanced aspects of a donor’s experiences with the American Lung Association. Whether it’s an experience at a special event, or their participation in a meeting, Chrissy goes out of her way to anticipate their needs and find opportunities to treat them with white glove service.\n\nChrissy’s excellence is also extended to staff. From observing milestones, to anniversaries, birthdays and professional achievements, recognition is always personalized and intentional with Chrissy and every staff member feels valued. She is exceptional at creating a safe space with a perpetually open-door policy. Chrissy helps her team to overcome obstacles and concerns in ways that create an open and honest dialogue. She infuses humanity and humility into the ways she interacts with her team, which allows everyone she works with to feel comfortable and heard.\n\nThe spirit of collaboration is very much embraced by Chrissy, and it is one that encourages each staff member to support one another while seeing their own important role in the greater picture. This has been evidenced by the tremendous growth that we have seen in our gross market revenue in the 5 years since Chrissy became Executive Director.\n\nChrissy is admired by leadership, peers, her staff and her volunteers and is a wealth of knowledge for all who interact with Chrissy.\n\nCongratulations, Chrissy, for showcasing excellence!\n\nTogether, Lexi and Hannah worked with community partners to develop and implement New York State’s first ever vape disposal program. The program addressed a significant gap in the community’s waste management infrastructure in that prior to the program, there was a notable absence of designated disposal methods specifically tailored to vaping devices and e-cigarettes. This gap posed several risks and challenges to both public health and the environment. Improper disposal of vaping products, which often contain hazardous materials such as lithium-ion batteries and plastic components, could lead to environmental contamination and potential harm to wildlife if these items ended up in landfills or waterways. Moreover, the lack of proper disposal options could encourage individuals to simply discard vaping devices in regular trash bins, exacerbating the problem of electronic waste accumulation.\n\nAugust 2023 marked one year of this vape disposal policy and program. Within that year, more than 5,500 devices had been collected equating to more than 340 pounds of devices taken to a Clean Harbors facility for safe disposal. Two-thirds of the vapes collected during the past year\n\nhave come from school districts and one-third of the vapes were dropped off by the community. The program also created media attention locally to address the dangers of e-cigarette youth usage, nicotine addiction and the environmental impacts of these products.\n\nThe vape disposal program is designed to be adapted and implemented in various community settings or organizational contexts. The program’s modular structure and flexible components allow for customization to suit the unique needs and resources of different communities or organizational departments. The initiative maximizes resource efficiency by leveraging existing infrastructure, partnerships, and resources wherever possible, which includes mobilizing a diverse group of individuals to contribute their time, skills, and resources towards the program’s goals. In addition, the initiative documents key learnings, best practices, and challenges encountered to aid others interested in replicating the program.\n\nThe program has become a leading program in the entire country for the creation, implementation and evaluation of county-wide vape disposal programs to properly dispose of e-cigarette and vape devices.\n\nCongratulations Lexi and Hannah on a job well done!"
