        "text": "Discussion\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to systematically evaluate the incidence of AKD in hospitalized children with AKI using the KDIGO definition of AKD. We have demonstrated that AKD is common in hospitalized AKI survivors, identified risk factors for AKD after AKI, and that AKD increases risk of CKD progression. Our study is unique in that we also demonstrate a trend towards increased ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, and mortality in children with AKD after AKI.\n\nIn recent years there has been increasing interest in understanding the progression of AKI to CKD with a focus on better understanding AKD. The incidence of AKD was 56% and a new diagnosis of CKD occurred in 19% of children with AKI at our tertiary care pediatric center using strict application of the KDIGO definitions. Other studies have shown variable incidences of AKD. The heterogeneity in AKD definitions utilized likely contributes to the variable incidence reported in studies. A study of children admitted to a single center in China also demonstrated a high incidence of AKD of 42.3% [16]. This study, along with the study by LoBasso et al, utilized the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) definition of AKD which only uses serum creatinine to classify AKD rather than the newer KDIGO classification of AKD which more broadly includes serum creatinine and eGFR based definitions [14, 16]. In the study by Namazzi et al. evaluating AKD in children with severe malarial infections serum creatinine was assessed at day 1, 2 and 1 month after admission. The incidence of AKD was 15.6% and was diagnosed if serum creatinine was elevated at 1 month which differs with the most recent KDIGO guidelines [15]. Daraskevicius et al. reported an incidence of AKD of 35.3% retrospective study of children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant [17]. This study used the pRIFLE criteria for AKI and the ADQI definition of AKD. Lastly, he higher incidence of AKD in our study may also be due to a higher proportion of subjects who were critically ill or had stage 2 or 3 AKI. Nearly 53% of the cohort in the study by Deng et al. had stage 1 AKI compared to only 20% in our study which likely contributed to the significantly higher incidence of AKD seen in our study [16]. Overall, these differences in AKD incidences among the different pediatric studies highlight the need for applying a standard definition of AKD to future studies assessing AKD incidence.\n\nIn the current study we have begun to identify risk factors for progression of AKI to AKD and CKD. We have shown that these factors increase the risk of AKD independent of the AKI stage itself demonstrating that factors aside from AKI stage must be considered in order to fully understand a child’s risk of kidney disease progression. These factors include a history of prematurity, malignancy, bone marrow transplant, and previous AKI as being high risk for AKD development. Children who were admitted to the PCICU or NICU were at increased risk of AKD likely related to their critical illness and prematurity. Surprisingly, though PCICU admission was a risk factor for AKD, congenital heart disease was not. This is likely because all forms of congenital heart disease including non-hemodynamically significant disease were included in the cohort. A history of CKD was also not a risk factor for AKD; we speculate that a known diagnosis of kidney disease may cause providers to be more cognizant of factors that cause and worsen kidney disease.\n\nBy understanding which patients are at higher risk of developing AKD and CKD after AKI, providers may modify the care they provide to be more kidney protective, consult nephrologists earlier, and monitor post-discharge kidney function more diligently. This presents an opportunity for more widespread study and application of known AKI risk prediction tools such as the Renal Angina Index (RAI) [25]. The RAI has been shown to predict severe AKI after admission to critical care units and is now being studied in other populations. Sooner application of such a risk prediction tool, even before admission to an ICU, may help in even preventing severe AKI and its progression to AKD and CKD [25–27]. Furthermore, such models may be developed to identify those the highest risk for AKD and CKD to guide follow-up.\n\nOur study also identified actionable risk factors associated with progression of AKI to AKD. Similar to the study done by Deng et al, we also showed that AKI severity increased risk of AKD in a graded manner with stage 2 AKI increasing risk 2-fold and stage 3 AKI increasing risk 3.5-fold when compared to stage 1 AKI [16]. This suggests that strategies to prevent severe AKI, including avoidance of nephrotoxic medications, contrast agents, early and sustained reversal of hypovolemia, may be beneficial in mitigating risk of AKD development. Early recognition of children with stage 1 AKI and prevention of AKI progression by utilizing early alert systems may also be beneficial in long term prevention of AKD and subsequent CKD. Such alert systems provide care teams with knowledge of their patient’s AKI as well as resources for optimizing their care [28]. More studies are needed to demonstrate the impact of such clinical decision support tools on the prevention of AKD and CKD in children with AKI. We demonstrated that longer duration of AKI increased risk of AKD suggesting those who have early reversal of AKI may have lower risk of progression of kidney disease. Studies in adults with AKI have also shown increased risk of AKD with nephrotoxin exposure warranting further investigation into this risk factor. Nephrotoxin exposure has long been known to be a risk factor for AKI and studies have shown that threshold values for exposures do increase risk of AKI [29]. Recent work has shown that children with nephrotoxin induced AKI are at increased risk of longer term abnormal kidney function [19]. Further study is warranted to better understand the incidence of AKD in children exposed to nephrotoxins and how these exposures affect their risk of CKD. Children with urinary obstruction as an etiology of AKI were found to be at lower risk of AKD after AKI. We suspect this is due to rapid recognition and relief of obstructive processes. Use of vasopressors at the time of AKI was a protective factor against development of AKD, but the mechanism for this remains unclear. This may in part be due to improved kidney perfusion in the setting of critical illness but further studies including closer blood pressure assessment are needed to understand this.\n\nThe limitations of our study include incomplete data inherent to retrospective studies. Selection bias was likely introduced by the initial method of cohort selection, exclusion of children with insufficient creatinine values to assess for AKD and CKD status, and exclusion of children who were deceased at < 3 months after AKI. AKD and CKD status were assessed only by serum creatinine and creatinine derived eGFR, an insensitive marker of kidney function. Most of our study population was admitted to an intensive care setting (71%) and was completed at a single, tertiary care children’s hospital in the United States potentially limiting the generalizability to children with AKI admitted to the general wards. In our analysis we treated age as a continuous variable. Age and prematurity may have some association with hospital location at admission, particularly with NICU admission. By treating these covariates as separate variables from hospital location we hoped to assess their roles as independent risk factors for AKI to AKD transition in neonates admitted to the NICU and outside of the NICU. Lastly, we were unable to complete sensitivity analysis comparing the excluded patients to the included patients due to missing data. Prospective study with standardized follow up protocols will better allow for unbiased assessment of AKD incidence after AKI and risk factors for AKI-AKD-CKD progression. Given the variable incidence of AKD and CKD after AKI we would suggest first starting with a rigorous follow up protocol for all children with AKI. Once incidence and risk factors are better understood we may categorize patients by risk level for kidney disease progression and better tailor follow up protocols.\n\nIn this retrospective cohort study of pediatric AKI survivors, we have shown that AKD is very common with greater than 50% of our cohort developing AKD. We have also identified patient level risk factors associated with AKD after AKI that will inform prospective studies. There were also many identifiable, possibly intervenable risk factors associated with AKD development. Children in our cohort who progressed from AKI to AKD were at higher risk of developing CKD. Larger prospective cohort or database studies would confirm the risk factors we have identified and in conjunction with our study would set the stage for future intervention studies."
