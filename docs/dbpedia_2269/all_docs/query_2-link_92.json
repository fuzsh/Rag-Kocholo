He is the son of Coni (Lemke), a photographer, and Joseph Momoa, a painter. His father is of Native Hawaiian and Samoan descent; and his mother, who is from Iowa, is of German, Irish, and Native American ancestry. Jason was raised in Norwalk, Iowa, by his mother. After high school, he moved to Hawaii, where he landed a lead role, beating out of thousands of hopefuls in the TV series Baywatch - Die Rettungsschwimmer von Malibu (1989) (known as \"Baywatch Hawaii\" in its 10th season). When the show ended, he spent the next couple of years traveling around the world. In 2001, he moved to Los Angeles, where he continued to pursue an acting career. In 2004, after the short-lived TV series North Shore (2004), he was cast as the popular character \"Ronon Dex\" in the TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004), which achieved a cult-like following. In 2010, he appeared in the Emmy-nominated HBO series Game of Thrones: Das Lied von Eis und Feuer (2011), playing the Dothraki king, Khal Drogo. To illustrate to the producers that he was Khal Drogo, he performed the Haka, a traditional war dance of the Maori of New Zealand. The audition was with the same casting director who was casting the titular role in the reboot of Conan (2011). Four weeks after being cast as the popular Robert E. Howard character, Momoa began shooting in Bulgaria. His approach, like that of the filmmakers, was to pull from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Jason has a production company, Pride of Gypsies, in which he is expanding his career from actor to filmmaker. He has directed a couple of short films and is working on his feature film debut Vendetta Rider - Weg der Rache (2014), which is pulled from a series of stories that he's been developing over the years, which he calls the Brown Bag Diaries: Ridin' the Blinds in B Minor (2010).

He was educated at Madras College, St. Andrews and Glasgow University, from where he graduated with an M.A (Hons.) in English Literature and Drama in 1979. After a year working as a navvy, he joined the 7.84 theatre company for John Burrough's \"One Big Blow\", in which the cast mimicked a traditional, colliery band by singing in six part harmony. The success of the play led to the formation of the acapella band \"The Flying Pickets\", who had a Christmas number one in 1983. Donachie's decision not to stay with the band and thereby missing out on their success has been described by him as \"one of my more brilliant career decisions.\"\n\nThroughout the 1980s, he was a prolific theatre performer all across the United Kingdom, working in Britain's now largely vanished repertory system. This afforded him the opportunity to act in many classical plays which are now rarely performed due to budget constraints and closed theatres. During this period, he appeared in over twenty plays at the Glasgow Citizens' Theatre under its famous triumvirate of Giles Havergal, Robert David Macdonald and Phillip Prowse. Like many performers with similar experience, he considers this the happiest, most fruitful and most influential phase of his career.\n\nIn the 1990s, he became a regular performer on British television, and did not appear on stage again until unexpectedly asked to join the National Theatre company for \"Scenes From the Big Picture\" in 2003. This ended a gap in live performance of thirteen years. Since then, he has tried to return to the variety of his earlier years with regular live performances interspersing his television and film work. Married on St. Patrick's Day 1989 to Fiona Biggar, the couple have two children: Naomi Porter, a student of Russian, German and French, and Daniel Porter, who now performs in his own right under the name of Daniel Portman.
