Herbert Griffies Williams, of a daughter.\n\nMarriage\n\nThe Carmarthen Journal – Friday, 10th September 1830\n\nOn Thursday last, at Llanwennog church, Cardiganshire, by the Rev. Erasmus S. Williams, the Rev. D. H. T. Griffies Williams, youngest son of Sir G. G. Williams, Bart, to Ann Gertrude Frances, eldest daughter of the late W. S. Davies, Esq. of Penylan, Carmarthenshire, and grand-daughter of Lord Robert Seymour.\n\nDeaths\n\nSouth Wales Daily News – 10th April 1877\n\nDEATH OF THE ViCAR Of LLANEDFElSANT, -The Reverend D. H. T. G. Williams, vicar of Llandyfeisant, who since the latter part of January has been suffering fron inflammation of the lungs, yeaterday afternoon succumbed to that disease.\n\nThe church of Llandyfeisaut is well known to visitors to Llandilo, being situated in a romantic spot in Dynevor Park, and is under the control of Lord Dynevor, at whose expense it was recently renovated.\n\nThe living is a perpetual curacy in the diocese of St David’s. The church is a very ancient one. It is said to have been built on the site of a Roman temple.\n\nHe has officiated here for over 40 years, and that alone will testify to his popularity as a clergyman. He was also vicar of Llanfihangel, a church noted for its connection with the Cawdor family, and situated on their estate.\n\nMr Willians was a justice of the peace for Carmarthenshire, and was one of the most regular in attendance at the Llandilo petty-sessions. He has only officiated at Llandyfeisant three times this year, and since January has been confined to his house.\n\nHe was greatly respected at Llandilo and the surrounding neighbourhoiod and his loss will, no doubt, be greatly missed. He resided at Llwynhelig, some little distance from Llandilo.\n\nSouth Wales Daily News – Thursday, 19th April 1877\n\nTHE LATE VICAR Of LLANDYFEISANT\n\nThe late Rev, D. H. T. Griffies Williams of Llandyfeisant, whose death was announced a few day ago, was buried on Tuesday last in Llandefeisant churchyard. The funeral was a public one and it was estimated that the cortege numbered about 500 persons. All were on foot, the route being through the home farm of Dynevor and the park, in one part of which the church is situated. A few of the gentry sent their carriages. There was scarcely a family that was not personally represented. So many county families have scarcely been known to attend a funeral in this neighbourhood before. The service was conducted by the Rev Dr. Griffiths, vicar of Llandilo. The church was suitably draped.\n\nSouth Wales Daily News – 8th January 1879\n\nTHE LATE MRS. WILLIAMS, OF LLWYNHELIG. On Tuesday the remains of Mrs Williams, of Llwvnhelig, were interred at Llandyfeisant church- yard. The deceased lady was advanced in years, and had been bed-ridden for many years.\n\nShe was very highly connected, being a sister to Lady Charles Russell and to Mr Evans, of High Mead, Cardiganshire, and was grand-daughter of the late Lord Robert Seymour. Her husband, the Rev. D. H. T. G. Williams, late vicar of Llandefeisant, died in April, 1877.\n\nThe funeral was strictly private, and the respect in which the deceased lady and her family were held might be inferred ‘from the fact that there were present at the funeral the members for the county, Viscount Emlyn and Mr John Jones, also Mr D. Pugh, Capt. Lewis, Capel. Isa Mr Ellis, Llangadock Capt. Plullips, Head- constable of Carmarthenshire Dr Davis, Llan- dilo, &c. The undertaker was Mr 0, James, draper, Llandilo.\n\nProbate\n\nWeekly Mail – 29th October 1910\n\nMISS CAROLINE WILLIAMS, LLANDEFEISANT. Miss Caroline Mary Anne Griffies Williams. of Llwynhelig. Llandefeisant. Carmarthen, who died on July 6. 1907. left estate of the gross value of £ 2.816.\n\nBy her will she named her sister Miss “Clarissa Delme Griffies Williams as sole executrix and residuary legatee thereof, but she predeceased the testatrix, while her sister Mrs. Elizabeth Isabella Bowen Thomas survived the testatrix, but died without administering her estate.\n\nAdministration of her estate has now been granted to Mrs. Julia Eleanor Dorothea Rodd, of Trebartha Hall, North Hill, Cornwall, the executrix of the will of the said Mrs. Thomas.\n\n** Mrs. Julia Eleanor Dorothea Rodd was the daughter of Caroline’s cousin and grand daughter to Caroline’s sister Elizabeth."
