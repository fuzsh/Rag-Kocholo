        "text": "Stephen Bezruchka\n\nAssociate Teaching Professor Emeritus\n\n206-932-4928\n\nsabez@uw.edu\n\nResearch Interests: Effective methods of disseminating determinants of population health to the general population so they work to change societal structures to improve America’s health; theories of global health asking the question why do countries order by health outcomes such as life expectancy in the Health Olympics?; medical harm and the lack of interest in the USA for responding to this marked health risk; medical tourism and its affect on host populations\n\nBill Daniell\n\n206-685-3160\n\nbdaniell@uw.edu\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nBill’s major active research efforts focus on environmental and occupational health problems in Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia, including projects related to pesticide exposures and cholinesterase monitoring, arsenic in ground water, and others. Other ongoing or recent research interests include: workplace noise exposure and noise-induced hearing loss; work-related carpal tunnel syndrome, particularly treatment outcomes and disability; and the use of workers’ compensation data for guiding occupational health interventions. Bill enjoys serving as faculty mentor for student-initiated epidemiologic research projects, focusing on environmental or occupational health topics, not necessarily limited to his primary research interest areas. Other past research interests include: solvent and pesticide health effects, neuropsychological sequelae of chemical exposures, and multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome.\n\nBryant Thomas Karras\n\nClinical Instructor\n\n206-221-6676\n\nbkarras@uw.edu\n\nResearch Interests: – Informatics methods to improve public health\n\n– PH preparedness, prevention, health promotion, disease surveillance and non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. WA notify)\n\n– Syndromic surveillance for bioterrorism and epidemic detection\n\n– PH linkage to clinical information systems via Health Information Exchange for use in monitoring hospital capacity and chronic disease population analysis\n\n– Using portable computers and the web for health survey data collection and health guideline implementation\n\n– Person empowerment to portably carry their personal and family medical records on smart phones and QR-codes (e.g. WA verify)\n\nDaniel Peplow\n\nClinical Professor\n\n509-930-7247\n\ndpeplow@uw.edu\n\nResearch Interests: Prof. Peplow has interacted directly with the UN, the Organization of American States, IADB, World Bank, the G20, communities, and other diverse international partners to develop a methodology global health practitioners could use to further address international health crises where international policies contribute to compromised health conditions that pose a regional threat to security. A key question asked in response to his request for a joined-up effort to address specific global health issues has been: “Where are the bodies”. To answer that question, Prof. Peplow is now developing a cloud-based “app” that victims, their families, and communities in the Guiana Shield region can use to self-report health issues traceable to the assimilation process. Comments, questions, and suggestions are currently being solicited from all sectors that will be used to prepare a final design model and make the app an effective tool for addressing non-communicable NTD’s and for increasing stability in the region.\n\nGerry Pollet\n\nClinical Instructor\n\n206-729-3242\n\ngpollet@uw.edu\n\nResearch Interests: Gerry has over 30 years of experience working on risk assessment and standards for environmental contamination, including exposure scenarios and public input. He has worked extensively with Tribes to incorporate Native American and Tribal exposure scenarios in cleanup and hazardous waste related decisions. He has served on numerous agency advisory boards relating to hazardous substance cleanup. Gerry has lectured and presented in numerous forums on risk assessment and public input to exposure scenarios in hazardous waste site cleanup planning; and is frequently cited in national and regional news media. Gerry continues to work with students interested in research and evidence-based policies on e-cigarettes / vaping, preventing lead exposure, funding foundational public health and other public health topics."
