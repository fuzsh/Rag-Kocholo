Our program draws on concepts developed by scholars advocating the importance of literature and narrative in healthcare education and practice.\n\nCome across a book you think would be beneficial for others to read?\n\nHeard about a book you'd like to read?\n\nRead a book you'd like to discuss?\n\nLet us know and we'll add it to our review list for the next year's picks!\n\nDETAILS & SCHEDULES BY YEAR*\n\n*make sure to check each tab for details\n\nGENERAL INFO\n\n1.5 hours of CME credit | 2nd Wednesday of the month | 6-7:30pm | via Zoom*\n\n*To protect the privacy of all who attend and the tempo of the discussion:\n\n1) meetings will start in the Waiting Room\n\n2) participants need to email the Center to receive a passcode\n\nOur program draws on concepts developed by scholars advocating the importance of literature and narrative in healthcare education and practice. Each month, discussions of relevant books are led by members of the Center and other U of U faculty and staff. The spirit of our program is captured by Rita Charon, MD, PhD, in the abstract from her JAMA article (2001;286:1897-1902): Narrative Medicine: A Model for Empathy, Reflection, Profession, and Trust:\n\nThe effective practice of medicine requires narrative competence, that is, the ability to acknowledge, absorb, interpret, and act on the stories and plights of others. Medicine practiced with narrative competence, called narrative medicine, is proposed as a model for humane and effective medical practice. Adopting methods such as close reading of literature and reflective writing allows narrative medicine to examine and illuminate 4 of medicine's central narrative situations: physician and patient, physician and self, physician and colleagues, and physicians and society. With narrative competence, physicians can reach and join their patients in illness, recognize their own personal journeys through medicine, acknowledge kinship with and duties toward other health care professionals, and inaugurate consequential discourse with the public about health care. By bridging the divides that separate physicians from patients, themselves, colleagues, and society, narrative medicine offers fresh opportunities for respectful, empathic, and nourishing medical care.\n\nBOOKS FOR DISCUSSIONS\n\nA 10% discount is available for our book discussion friends\n\nat the following locations:\n\nU of U Health Sciences Bookstore\n\n26 2000 E, SLC, UT\n\n801-581-8049\n\ncall | directions | website\n\npickup: sign marked parking space in Lot 70\n\nThe King's English Bookshop\n\n1511 S 1500 E, SLC, UT\n\n801-484-9100\n\ncall | directions | website\n\n2024 SCHEDULE & NOTES\n\n1.5 hours of CME credit | 2nd Wednesday of the month | 6-7:30pm | via Zoom*\n\n*TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF ALL WHO ATTEND AND INTEGRITY OF THE DISCUSSIONS\n\nWE WILL BE UTILIZING PASSCODES FOR ALL ZOOM MEETINGS\n\n>>>>>PRIOR TO START OF DISCUSSION<<<<<\n\nYou will need to email the Center for a Zoom passcode to join the discussions\n\nJANUARY 10\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, PhD, MFA\n\nBook: A Life in Light: Meditations on Impermanence\n\nby Mary Pipher (2022)\n\nFrom our Facilitator Susan Sample, PhD, MFA: In her newest book, a memoir in essays, Mary Pipher draws on her many years’ experience as a psychologist helping people create “empowering life stories” to reflect upon her own life. During the pandemic, Pipher felt keenly isolated from family and friends, which was intensified as she turned seventy: “I needed to look inside myself for the love I cannot find in the world.” Her guiding metaphor was the Japanese word komorebi, which describes not only the play of sun through leaves but also the impermanence of light and shadow, joy and loss. Pipher, author of the bestselling Reviving Ophelia, shares stories of hardship: growing up in rural Nebraska where her mother, a physician, was often absent; dealing with her father’s post-traumatic stress syndrome from the Korean Was; struggling as a single mother to finish her graduate degree. Always, though, Pipher finds the light of new meaning through honesty, wonder, and compassion for others and herself. “My story,” she writes, “is really everyone’s story.” As you read, look for chapters that resonate with you on the themes of coping, resilience, beauty, and transcendence.\n\nCME Code: 10056\n\nFEBRUARY 7*\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nBook: Libertie: A Novel\n\nby Kaitlyn Greenidge (2021)\n\nFrom our Facilitator Rachel Borup, PhD: Kaitlyn Greenidge’s second novel, Libertie, is inspired by the life of Susan Smith McKinney Steward, the first Black female doctor in New York State. Like Steward, Greenidge’s character founded a medical clinic in a Black community and was revered for her contributions to this community. The novel focuses on Steward’s daughter, Libertie, who grows up watching her mother competently tend to her patients’ needs and is initially inspired to follow in her mother’s footsteps. The novel is a coming-of-age story that follows Libertie’s individuation and progress into adulthood, and poignantly depicts the tensions that eventually arise between the light-skinned mother and dark-skinned daughter and the harm created by colorism within the Black community.\n\nCME Code: 45056\n\nMARCH 13\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, DPhil\n\nBook: What My Bones Know: A Memoir of Healing from Complex Trauma\n\nby Stephanie Foo (2023)\n\nFrom our Facilitator Mark Matheson, DPhil: In March we’ll be discussing a new book by the journalist Stephanie Foo, What My Bones Know: A Memoir of Healing from Complex Trauma. In this work Foo explores her own experience with “Complex PTSD,” which is identiﬁed as the result not of a single catastrophic event but of continual trauma over many years. Foo was abused and then abandoned by her parents as a teenager, and in early adulthood she had engaged with her condition and sought healing through various therapies. The book thus takes its place in a series of works on PTSD that our group has studied, perhaps most recently Bessel van der Kolk’s The Body Keeps the Score. It will be a further opportunity for us to assess the eﬃcacy of recently developed therapies for PTSD, and Foo’s work is also being understood in additional ways, including as a record of Asian-American experience. I look forward to getting your responses to this challenging book.\n\nCME Code: 73056\n\n↑\n\n*FEBRUARY'S DISCUSSION:\n\nwill be the 1st week due to the Valentine’s Day conflict on the 2nd week\n\nAPRIL 10\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD, MA\n\nBook: Black Health: The Social, Political, and Cultural Determinants of Black People's Health\n\nby Keisha Ray* (2023)\n\nFrom our Facilitator Gretchen Case, PhD, MA: Medical humanities and bioethics scholar Keisha Ray wrote Black Health: The Social, Political, and Cultural Determinants of Black People’s Health to address the complex and confounding ways that race is attributed to health outcomes for Black people. She explores compelling stories of individual and community experiences to counterbalance stark statistics and prevailing narratives of Black bodies as somehow difficult or especially susceptible to poor health. Instead, she emphasizes why it is important to look at environmental and other factors beyond any one person. Dr. Ray’s book is written to be accessible to a wide range of readers, avoiding medical or academic jargon, and raises issues regarding health and healthcare that matter to everyone.\n\nAs part of her visit to the U for the Cowan-Mayden Lectureship, Dr. Ray will join us for the discussion.\n\nHYBRID EVENT!!!

These sobering numbers signify exponential permutations of movements—between places, circles of kinship, traditions, and culture—within diverse individual stories. Such dauntingly unique unfoldings of the refugee experience are at the heart of the textual explorations in Tsering Yangzom Lama’s novel, We Measure the Earth with Our Bodies. This story follows a Tibetan family as they are displaced by China’s invasion in 1959 due to the surviving members’ eventual immigration to and life in Canada. In this journey and the stories it precipitates, Lama explores dislocations of identity that occur through the psychological and physical traumas of the loss of a homeland—while also providing insight into the necessities of individual and communal repair.\n\nCME Code: 73056\n\nJUNE 12\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD, MA\n\nMovie: Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution\n\nby Nicole Newnham, James LeBrecht, & David Radcliff (2020)\n\nFrom our facilitator Gretchen Case, PhD, MA: The documentary film “Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution” (Netflix 2020) premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award for its portrayal of 1970s Camp Jened in New York, created for teens with disabilities. Through archival footage and interviews with former campers, the film shows that attending Camp Jened meant far more than simply a summer camp experience, creating friendships and networks that fed into large-scale disability activism and nationwide change toward improved disability rights. “Crip Camp” offers not only valuable documentation of the history of disability in the United States but also celebrates the people who found community at Camp Jened and beyond.\n\nYou are encouraged to watch the film ahead of time, as we will watch some clips but not the entire film during this session. The full feature “Crip Camp” is available through Netflix or through Netflix’s YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRrIs22plz0&t=4s\n\nCME Code: 164056\n\n↑ *Dr. Ray is the 2023-24 Cowan-Mayden Lecturer and will be joining us for the discussion\n\nINFORMAL & IN-PERSON\n\nTHE COVENANT OF WATER\n\nby Abraham Verghese (2023)\n\nFacilitators: Susan Sample, PhD, MA\n\n& Sadie Hoagland, PhD, MFA\n\nMAY 29\n\n*5-6:30pm\n\n@Oasis Cafe (151 S 500 E, SLC)\n\n*not our typical meeting time\n\nJULY 10\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nBook: Sometimes People Die\n\nby Simon Stephenson (2022)\n\nFrom our facilitator Rachel Borup, PhD: Sometimes People Die is a medical thriller by Scottish physician/author Simon Stephenson. The phrase is also the guilt-deflecting mantra that gets repeated one too many times in the underfunded, understaffed St. Luke’s Hospital in London where mysterious patient deaths start piling up. The narrator is a doctor who is grateful just to have the job at St Luke’s after a bout of opioid addiction. The rest of the cast is a motley crew who each have their own quirky reasons for putting up with the working conditions at the hospital. The mystery of who is causing these deaths is suspenseful and compelling, while the insider’s view of what it’s like to work in such a hospital is entertaining and darkly funny.\n\nCME Code: 192056\n\nAUGUST 14\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, DPhil\n\nBook: Mrs. Dalloway\n\nby Virginia Woolf (1925)\n\nFrom our facilitator Mark Matheson, DPhil: I look forward very much to our August discussion of Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs. Dalloway (1925). It will be interesting to consider Woolf's treatment of trauma in this work, which she wrote precisely one hundred years ago. The novel is set on a single day in London in the summer of 1923. The debacle of the Great War is in the immediate background, and it deeply influences the society of the novel and the lives of its individual characters. Most notable in this respect is Septimus Warren Smith, an English soldier who is profoundly shell-shocked by the War and who five years later is struggling to survive. Clarissa Dalloway is the wife of a Conservative Member of Parliament, and she spends the day reflecting on her past and preparing for the society party she gives that evening. She does not meet Septimus Warren Smith, but their lives are parallel in certain respects, and the news of his fate reaches her party near the end of the novel. The book offers significant criticism of the medical establishment in England during the 1920s, and this is clearly based on Woolf's personal experience as she sought help for her own mental illnesses, which were debilitating throughout her life. Sir William Bradshaw is the suave Harley Street doctor who sees Septimus Warren Smith midway through the novel, and there is great intensity in Woolf's writing and characterization in this passage. We've recently read a number of up-to-date books about trauma—by Bessel van der Kolk, Stephanie Foo, and others—and it will be valuable to compare Woolf's exploration of this phenomenon in her classic novel. It's a beautifully written work, and in addition to appreciating its strong medical interest, I hope you enjoy the aesthetic experience that reading Mrs. Dalloway offers.\n\nCME Code: 227056\n\nSEPTEMBER 11\n\nFacilitator: Sadie Hoagland, PhD, MA & Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nEssays: The Aquarium & People Like That are the Only People Here\n\nby Aleksander Hemon (2011) & Lorrie Moore (1997)\n\nFrom our facilitators Sadie Hoagland, PhD, MA & Rachel Borup, PhD:\n\nDr. Hoagland: Aleksander Hemon's The New Yorker essay, \"The Aquarium,\" is a heart-wrenching and honest depiction of his infant daughter's diagnosis of, and decline from, brain cancer. Hemon frankly describes the effects of the grief and stress on his wife and himself, how isolated such a tragedy rendered them despite well-wisher's best intentions, and how their older child coped with the situation. While emotionally difficult to read, this essay is beautifully written and offers honesty and openness invaluable to understanding this tragic experience from the patient's family's perspective.\n\nDr. Borup: \"People Like That Are the Only People Here,” by Lorrie Moore, is a semi-autobiographical short story told from the point of view of a mother whose baby is diagnosed with renal cancer. The characters are not given names but are identified by their roles—the Mother, the Baby, and the Radiologist—which makes the story feel experimental but also archetypal and universal; these characters might be any of us. The mother’s terror and rage at this unthinkable situation propel the story, and, because the author is Lorrie Moore, it is also told with her unique brand of dark humor and sharp observations about love, art, and human nature.\n\nCME Code: 255056\n\nOCTOBER 9\n\nFacilitator: Sadie Hoagland, PhD, MA\n\nBook: The Answers: A Novel\n\nby Catherine Lacey (2018)\n\nFrom our facilitator Sadie Hoagland, PhD, MA: In Catherine Lacey's \"The Answers,\" protagonist Mary Parsons is deep in medical debt from a mysterious illness when she finds relief through a homeopathic procedure that, while it works, only exacerbates her financial stress. It's from this desperate position that she takes on a second job as an \"emotional girlfriend,\" for a wealthy actor who has hired a team of biotech researchers to refine his relationships for him (he also has a \"maternal girlfriend,\" and an \"anger girlfriend\"). The New York Times writes of the book: \"This is a novel of intellect and amplitude that deepens as it moves forward, until you feel prickling awe at how much mental territory unfolds...Lacey's special gift is for capturing the realistic flickering of individual consciousness.\" It should make for an interesting discussion, to say the least!\n\nCME Code: 283056\n\nNOVEMBER 13\n\nFacilitator: Hailey Haffey, Phd\n\nBook: The People’s Hospital: Hope and Peril in American Medicine\n\nby Ricardo Nuila, MD (2023)\n\nFrom our Facilitator Hailey Haffey, PhD: The People’s Hospital: Hope and Peril in American Medicine is physician Ricardo Nuila’s recounting of his work at Ben Taub, a safety-net hospital in Houston, Texas–and the city’s “largest hospital for the poor.” Nuila’s story in The People’s Hospital illustrates personal and systemic transformations in health care–and of perspectives about care–that characterize Ben Taub, which provides services for uninsured and insured patients alike. Thus, Nuila reveals this public hospital’s dynamics of resilience and innovation through a lens that centers five unique patients and their health stories within the context of core dilemmas that persist in medicine today–including costs, coverage, quality, bias, excess, and access.\n\nIn Nuila’s account, readers are gifted with a clinician who illuminates systemic struggles and community-oriented remedies through the human experiences of his patients. Nuila also depicts these patients navigating complex health situations in a fragmented national medical backdrop of unavailable and insufficient health insurance options paired with problematic organizational priorities. Central to this text is that, while humanizing systemic challenges, Nuila also shows that high-quality, attentive patient care can be provided at a reasonable cost–with Ben Taub’s esteemed hospital and health system spending significantly less than the national average per patient. Such care is the result of teams united through shared values about what it means to practice medicine–believing that “the illnesses you see and deal with at Ben Taub make you a better doctor,” and that the most vulnerable and under-resourced patients deserve high-quality care. Accordingly, Nuila reflects, “I entered medical school with the ambition to care for sports stars. But these stories, these people—this, to me, is medicine.”\n\nPlease join us as we reflect on lessons from the people and practices in The People’s Hospital, and as well as for a discussion of the form and functions of Nuila’s storytelling style.\n\nCME Code: 318056\n\nDECEMBER 11\n\nFacilitator: Maureen Mathison, PhD\n\nBook: Taking Care: The Story of Nursing and Its Power to Change the World\n\nby Sarah DiGregorio (2023)\n\nFrom our facilitator Maureen Mathison, PhD, MA: Taking Care: The Story of Nursing and Its Power to Change our World by Sarah DiGregorio is an insightful read about the history and social contexts of nursing. As primary caretakers in a variety of settings today, nurses have been instrumental since Neolithic times, well before there was a name for the care they provided. DiGregorio provides a glimpse of the medical and interpersonal work nurses have been doing through the ages and gives them the recognition they deserve.\n\nCME Code: 346056\n\n2023 SCHEDULE & NOTES\n\n1.5 hours of CME credit | 2nd Wednesday of the month | 6-7:30pm | via Zoom*\n\n*To protect the privacy of all who attend and the tempo of the discussion:\n\n1) meetings will start in the Waiting Room\n\n2) participants need to email the Center to receive a passcode\n\nJANUARY 11\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, DPhil\n\nBook: Together: The Healing Power of Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World\n\nby Vivek H.

Growing up the twins are inseparable, yet unique. They have each internalized the early trauma of their lives but experience it differently in their search for self in a racialized world. Bennett beautifully addresses issues of race, family, and identity in her novel. Issues she raises are especially pertinent today as society continues to struggle with race and its legacy in our history.\n\nWed, Nov 10 via zoom\n\nBook: A Chorus of Stones: The Private Life of War by Susan Griffin\n\nFacilitator: Jenny Cochrane, MA\n\nSusan Griffin's A Chorus of Stones is, all at once, a historical narrative and memoir. Her prose weaves the story of global history into the lives of those who lived it--famous and inconspicuous alike--including the lives of her and her family. Much as stones carry the scars of the events of their environment, Griffin explores the idea that the trauma we carry is not ours alone but is a tapestry of pain past and present that we will, in turn, pass on to the future. She examines the toll that personal and global traumas take on our individual psyches--how they blur the lines of traditional gender roles, sex, health, safety, well-being, and sanity. Paragraph by paragraph, Griffin pulls the macrocosm of myriad historical events into the microcosm of identity and proves that we truly are products of all that is and all that has gone before.\n\nWed, Oct 6\n\nPLEASE NOTE DATE CHANGE TO FIRST WEDNESDAY OF OCTOBER!\n\nvia zoom\n\nBook: The Electric Woman: A Memoir in Death-Defying Acts by Tessa Fontaine\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nTessa Fontaine’s relationship with her mother was difficult to begin with. Then her mother’s devastating hemorrhagic stroke put Tessa in the complicated position of caring for a mother who had done a less-than-perfect job of caring for her. To escape the stress and ongoing emotional trauma of her mother’s health crisis, Tessa learned to eat fire and joined the travelling World of Wonders sideshow, where she performed as Electra, the Electric Woman. Her memoir alternates between scenes at her mother’s bedside, flashbacks to her difficult childhood, and scenes of adventure with her adopted carnie family. Tessa is an amazingly gifted writer who studied in the University of Utah’s creative writing program. Her memoir is sure to spark discussion about the ways in which atypical bodies have been exoticized and vilified by sideshows, the therapeutic benefits of performance art, how outsiders often form alternative communities, difficult mother-daughter relationships, caregiving, and complicated grief.\n\nWed, Sept 8 via zoom\n\nBook: The Plague by Albert Camus\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, DPhil\n\nIn his novel The Plague (1947), Albert Camus offers a compelling fictional account of an epidemic in a North African city. The central character is a physician, Dr. Bernard Rieux, who is very active in the town of Oran before the plague and who becomes a leading figure in dealing with its catastrophic effects. The novel offers a perceptively sequenced presentation of the outbreak, progress, and abatement of the plague. Living as we still are with the COVID pandemic, we can appreciate Camus’s insight into the consequences of the plague for individuals and institutions. In both the novel and our current reality, mass infection reveals a great deal about the character of human beings, as it does about organizations—medical, civic, ecclesiastical, and commercial. One of the real interests for us in reading the novel will be comparing the responses to plague in Camus’s fictional city with those in 21st-century America. One initial observation: while the narrator is aware that the plague raises political issues in Oran, there is an absence of the politicization of the epidemic along ideological lines that we’ve witnessed in the U.S. since March 2020. There is also the question of how a physician—and how the medical establishment—deals with this kind of disaster. Dr. Rieux is persistently stoic, but he faces exhaustion, numbness, and existential philosophical and spiritual quandaries. The effects of the epidemic on Dr. Rieux—of human suffering on a scale he has never experienced, and about which he can do almost nothing—will be a rich topic of discussion when we gather in September.\n\nWed, Aug 11\n\nvia zoom\n\nBook: Hidden Valley Road: Inside the Mind of An American Family by Robert Kolker\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD, MA\n\nHidden Valley Road is frequently described as a “medical mystery” or “medical detective story,” but it is not fiction. Robert Kolker wrote this book about the very real Galvin family and their lives in 20th century Colorado. Of the twelve children in the Galvin family, ten were boys, and six of those boys were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Their situation was so compelling and unusual that the family was studied by the National Institute of Mental Health. This is a book about the unknowns of mental illness, about a family coping with trauma and hoping for better, and all the ways that medicine is still trying to fully understand the human condition.\n\nWed, July 14 via zoom\n\nBook: The Slumbering Masses: Sleep, Medicine, and Modern Life by Matthew J. Wolfe-Meyer\n\nFacilitator: Maureen Mathison, PhD\n\nSleep is often a topic of conversation—mostly when we haven’t slept enough. Many often think of sleep as a luxury. While eight hours of sleep is desired, it is primarily aspirational for many Americans. The pace of modern life has overwhelmed our days to the point where something has to go, usually restful slumber. Others, suffering from various ailments, rarely have satisfying sleep patterns. The past year especially has highlighted our sleep habits as they have shifted with our lifestyles during the time of COVID. Sleep today embodies cultural, medical and economic issues that saturate our society.\n\nIn The Slumbering Masses, Matthew Wolf-Meyer undertakes American sleep, an unusual topic, from an anthropological perspective. As an outsider looking in, he critically examines American views about sleep habits, and challenges us to think about them within the context of history and culture, including that of medicine. His book provides insights into sleep disorders and how they are treated based on three years of fieldwork in a sleep clinic.\n\nWed, June 9 via zoom\n\nBook: What Are You Going Through: A Novel by Sigrid Nunez\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, PhD, MFA\n\nAfter visiting her friend who is hospitalized with cancer, the narrator in Sigrid Nunez’s novel, What Are You Going Through, reflects on her friend’s troubled relationship with her adult daughter and thinks: “This is the saddest story I have ever heard.” The narrator, like her wry friend, is an unnamed middle-aged woman, yet she is quick to name a movie, a musical, another story “the saddest” of all time. So, it is surprising that the novel, which revolves around her friend’s plan to end her own life and the narrator’s acquiescence to help, is not itself sad. Rather, it is an insightful, compassionate, and often humorous story about relationships, the meaning of life, love, and the limits of language. It is, as the narrator says of a movie, “a beautifully told story [that] lifts you up.”\n\nWed, May 12 via zoom\n\nBook: Learning from the Wounded: The Civil War and the Rise of American Medical Science by Shauna Devine\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, DPhil\n\nNext month we’ll discuss Shauna Devine’s Learning from the Wounded: The Civil War and the Rise of American Medical Science (2014). Devine understands that we typically wince at the subject of the wounded in the Civil War and the medical treatment they received. But she also makes the case that American medicine advanced enormously during the conflict. This progress took many forms: a more pervasive knowledge of anatomy, the use of experimental methods to treat injury and disease, and the development of medical research and specialization. Devine’s study provides a fascinating historical perspective on 19th-Century medicine in this country, including the rise of medical education. I’m confident the book will be of genuine interest to our group of engaged medical readers.\n\nIn considering Devine’s book, I’ve thought often about the poet Walt Whitman’s service in Civil War hospitals. In addition to discussing Devine’s work when we get together, I hope to talk just a bit about Whitman’s accounts of his experience. When the War was over, Whitman wrote a prose work called Democratic Vistas, a passionate vision of the transformative future he believed American Democracy could achieve. He notes that it was his experience in the hospitals of the Union Army that led him to write the book: “I know not whether I shall be understood, but I realize that it is finally from what I learn’d personally mixing in such scenes that I am now penning these pages.” He goes on: “One night in the gloomiest period of the war, in the Patent office hospital in Washington city, as I stood by the bedside of a Pennsylvania soldier, who lay, conscious of quick approaching death, yet perfectly calm, and with noble, spiritual manner, the veteran surgeon, turning aside, said to me, that though he had witness’d many, many deaths of soldiers, and had been a worker at Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, &c., he had not seen yet the first case of a man or boy that met the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms or terror. My own observation fully bears out the remark.”\n\n“Let no tongue ever speak in disparagement” of the American people, Whitman declares at the end of this passage, “to one who has been through the war in the great army hospitals.”\n\nWed, April 14 via zoom\n\nBook: Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston\n\nFacilitator: Hailey Haffey, PhD\n\nZora Neale Hurston’s novel Their Eyes Were Watching God is a Harlem Renaissance classic rich with insight for present-day analysis of the interplay between gender, class, race, religion, psychology, and bodies. Key for our conversation will be Hurston’s use of storytelling as it relates to the health and wellness of the self and the community. Published in 1937, Their Eyes Were Watching God follows the life story of Janie Crawford, an African American woman who recounts coming of age in rural Florida. Through both first-person and third-person narration, Hurston reveals Janie’s histories of trauma involving illness, death, racism, and gendered violence. In Janie’s relationships with men, with her community, and in the development of her own voice as a narrator, we see the necessity of storytelling as a device of reflection, self-knowledge, and healing in the face of suffering. Further, our discussion will also be framed by a conversation about the ways Hurston’s fiction employs ritual to make meaning through an introduction to her work as a pioneering anthropologist who personally documented the symbolism and folk medicine of Voodoo culture in the Southern United States, Haiti, and Jamaica.\n\nWed,\n\nMarch 10\n\nvia\n\nzoom\n\nBook: A Cross-Genre Selection of Writings about COVID-19\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nFor March’s selection, Rachel Borup has put together a \"COVID Reader.\" The pandemic has dominated every aspect of our lives for about a year now and will probably be the greatest health crisis of our generation.

Jacobson combines aspects of poetry and prose in a series of essays on illness and wellness, concepts which take on new meaning when her memoir is read during the pandemic, a time of uncertain health for all of us. Her writing is lyrical and rich in both meaning and metaphors; her attention to detail, keen and resonant, transporting readers into the emotional core of the story. Dr. Joanne Jacobson will join us as a special guest and begin our discussion with a short reading from Every Last Breath.\n\nWed, January 13 via\n\nzoom\n\nBook: Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sampe, PhD, MFA\n\nMartin Arrowsmith has for generations inspired readers. His tumultuous journey as a medical student, clinical practitioner, public health officer, and researcher captures conflicts many physicians experience: medicine vs. science, altruism vs. commerce, medical ethics vs. scientific fraud. Like many classics, however, Sinclair Lewis’1925 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, Arrowsmith, can be read from multiple perspectives. Recently, critical attention has been drawn to the depiction of public health. As one physician-reviewer noted, “rather than seeming dated, public health aspects of the story can be viewed in the context of modern deadly viral infections and antibiotic resistant bacterial diseases.” With COVID-19, Arrowsmith takes on new meaning. We’ll begin our discussion with chapter 31 in which the protagonist, now working for a private research institute, is sent to a Caribbean island to study the effects of a serum he developed on the bubonic plague. The parallels are fascinating as well as uncanny.\n\n2020 SCHEDULE & NOTES\n\nWed, Dec 9 via zoom\n\nBook: Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas by Adam Kay\n\nFacilitator: Jenny Cochrane, MA\n\nChristmas Eve is a joyous, festive time spent relishing family, friends, or even alone time as everyone awaits the bells of Santa’s sleigh. Unless you’re one of millions of healthcare workers across the world for whom Christmas Eve is a shift unlike any other. In ‘Twas the Night Shift Before Christmas, Adam Kay deep dives into his journals to give us a sense of what it’s like being on the front lines of healthcare on one of the most emotional nights of the year—Christmas Eve. He recounts the joy of babies born, the heartbreak of lives lost—made somehow more painful amid cardstock stockings and rubber glove tree décor, and the insane shenanigans of the drunk and disorderly who find their way to the hospital with turkey bones stuck up their noses or baubles stuck up their backsides. Prepare to laugh and cry through a night shift you won’t soon forget!\n\nWed, Nov 11 via zoom\n\nBook: The Broken Ladder: How Inequality Affects the Way We Think, Live and Die by Keith Payne\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, DPhil\n\nWe look forward to our discussion of Keith Payne’s The Broken Ladder: How Inequality Affects the Way We Think, Live, and Die. Payne is a psychologist, and he’s interested in both the material facts of inequality and its psychological consequences for people both up and down the social “ladder.” In addition to considering the effects of actual poverty and wealth, he argues that “status”—our perception of our relative position in the social whole—is an important determinant of wellbeing. The sections of the book exploring health and medical care in the context of social inequality will be of interest to our group, and Payne also has much to say about politics, business, and race. This well-received book from 2018 should provide an abundance of provocative topics for conversation, and it’s unquestionably relevant in the context of material inequality in the United States, which is both already precipitous and increasing. (A recent study revealed that the 55 richest Americans have as much wealth as the poorest 168 million.) We are excited to explore this fundamental problem in our collective life.\n\nWed, Oct 14 via zoom\n\nBook: Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War by Mary Roach\n\nFacilitator: Jenny Cochrane, MA\n\nEverything in the military is engineered to win wars, including the people. With her characteristic wit and humor, Grunt: The Curious Science of Humans at War” Mary Roach examines the mental, emotional, and physical toll a human soldier in a warzone endures and how everything from a soldier’s haircut, uniform, and even cleaning regimen is designed to ensure victory in battle. Grunt covers everything from how the zippers on a soldier’s uniform can be a problem for snipers; how war—both simulated and real—affects hearing and, by association, balance and gait; how amputee actors help military medics prepare for the gore and horror of war wounds; and how the food a soldier consumes can mean the difference between staying alert and alive or being lethargic and dead. “Take a tour of duty with Roach, and you’ll never see our nation’s defenders the same way again!”\n\nWed, Sept 9 via zoom\n\nBook: The Farewell (film) directed by Lulu Wang\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nThe Farewell premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. It tells the story of a Chinese family’s decision to hide their grandmother’s terminal cancer diagnosis from her, and, instead, stage a wedding as a way to gather all the family members together against for a final “farewell.” The film is written and directed by Lulu Wang and is based on her own experiences, which she originally presented on the radio program, This American Life. The film raises interesting questions about different cultural attitudes toward death, and also manages to be surprisingly funny and touching.\n\nWed, Aug 12\n\nvia zoom\n\nBook: In Pain: A Bioethicist's Personal Struggle with Opioids by Travis Rieder\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD, MA\n\nTravis Rieder begins In Pain with the motorcycle accident that severely damaged his foot, but the story does not follow a typical recovery narrative. Instead Rieder shares the extraordinary—and yet so increasingly common—path he took to manage his terrible pain with prescribed opioids and then to manage his withdrawal from those same medications. Rieder, a bioethicist, brings keen insight to the historical and structural problems that underlie the problem of opioid use and addiction. He paints a tragically clear picture of what it is like to be a person in pain, who wants to stop using opioids, confronting a medical system that is not prepared to help.\n\nWed, July 8 via zoom\n\nBook: The Tangled Tree: A Radical New History of Life by David Quammen\n\nFacilitator: Maureen Mathison, PhD\n\nFirst used by Charles Darwin, the metaphor Tree of Life has been used to study how species are related (the trunk), evolved, and differentiated (as seen in the branching) to persist. For Darwin and others early thinking was that species evolved vertically, that is, traits were passed down to offspring; mutations were in response to environment so that through natural selection the fittest could survive. With vertical thinking much of the focus in research was on inheritance and change through genetic mutation. Genetic research opened up the study of evolution and led biologists to examine how evolution occurred through gene loss, gene creation and gene duplication. And more.\n\nDavid Quammen’s book, The Tangled Tree: A Radical New History of Life, takes up Darwin’s metaphor augmenting a unique perspective to explanations of evolution that impact human nature and health. The book traces various scientists and their contributions to thinking about evolution, from Charles Darwin to Tsutomu Watanabe (who identified horizontal gene transfer, which accounts for drug resistant bacteria), and to Carl Woese, who redefined evolutionary processes with his discovery of a third “domain of life.”\n\nIn a lively volume, Quammen relays the history of evolution through the history of key scientists and their contribution to its study. With the knowledge that early life may have been less competitive than thought, and that mutations occur between species, the idea that we are of the same origen and that traits are only passed on through offspring has become uprooted and the metaphor of the tree has been made circumspect, and thus tangled.\n\nWed, June 10 via zoom\n\nBook: That Good Night: Life and Medicine in the Eleventh Hour by Sunita Puri\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, PhD, MFA\n\nPalliative medicine, a relatively new medical specialty, often is mistaken for hospice or dismissed as “giving up” on seriously ill patients. In her eloquent memoir, Sunita Puri, M.D., director of palliative medicine at the University of Southern California Keck Hospital and cancer center, invites readers into patient rooms where she share their intimate stories of suffering but also trust, honesty, dignity, and compassion. Physicians help patients live; equally important, she says, doctors can help patients live well, even at the end of their lives. Puri, the daughter of Indian immigrants, follows her mother, an anesthesiologist, into medicine but finds herself curiously drawn to the limits of medical care where uncertainty, not the possibility of yet more procedures, reigns. In prose candid yet reassuring, Puri gently encourages physicians and the public alike to accept our mortality. Her memoir and the questions it raises seem especially pertinent during the coronavirus pandemic, which will be a good place to begin our discussion.\n\nWed, May 13 via zoom\n\nBook: Inheritance: A Memoir of Genealogy, Paternity and Love by Dani Shapiro\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nOn a whim, the writer Dani Shapiro and her husband decided to take DNA tests. Shapiro received the shock of her life when her results revealed that the man she'd always known as her father, a pillar in the tight-knit orthodox Jewish community in which she grew up, was not her biological father. This realization turns upside down her sense of self, her cultural identity, and her confidence in the world as she knew it. Inheritance is the true story of her quest to find her biological father and come to terms with the new facts of her life.\n\nWed, April 8 via zoom\n\nBook: Man’s 4th Best Hospital by Samuel Shem\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, PhD, MFA\n\nFast forward forty years: Roy Basch, M.D., and colleagues who suffered through their internship years in the 1970s at the hospital known as House of God are recruited to work at a new “Future of Medicine Clinic: Care, Compassion, and Cancer.” It is part of a fictional academic medical center known as Man’s Best Hospital--until it dropped to number four in national rankings. The reasons? Electronic medical records, hospital mergers, corporate medicine, and insurance companies: villains Basch and his friends battle in this comic sequel to Shem’s The House of God. The 1978 novel, a cynical view of medical training that “scandalized prominent reviewers within the health care community,” continues to be a favorite. Shem—a psychiatrist whose real name is Stephen Bergman—said he wrote his new novel “to resist injustice, and the danger of isolation, and the healing power of good connection.” One of the questions we will discuss is whether the book or novels in general can fulfill that intention. Please note: you do not have to read Shem’s original novel; the sequel should stand on its own merit.\n\nWed,\n\nMarch 11\n\nUU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: RX: A Graphic Novel by Rachel Lindsay\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD, MA\n\nRx: A Graphic Memoir is cartoonist Rachel Lindsay’s first book, telling her compelling personal story of how working on marketing campaigns for antidepressant medication, in order to have health insurance coverage for her own bipolar disorder, contributed to her declining health and hospitalization.

She would lose not only the pregnancy and most of her blood volume; she would suffer septic shock, a stroke, liver tumors, miscarriage, and multiple surgeries over the ensuing months. As she transformed from physician to patient, Dr. Awdish also experienced indifference and disregard from her doctors, which she attributes to medical education: “I knew we valued the cure, the goal, the win. We were far less comfortable in the gray, shadowed area of suffering.” Too often, doctors are bound to the disease, rather than the patient; they emotionally detach from patients. To do otherwise is to risk losing control, and, as she notes, “risk carries with it an inherent degree of vulnerability.” Yet, it is precisely through exploring vulnerability--“a dark hole at the center of a flurry of what was otherwise highly proficient, astounding skillful care”—that physicians will connect to patients and colleagues. As Awdish notes, “I didn’t understand that open channels would replenish my supply of self. That there was reciprocity in empathy.”\n\nAs you read Awdish’s memoir, note her comments on word choice as she repeatedly draws attention to the necessity of a shared language between doctors and patients. Do you agree? Note also how she tells her story, frequently foreshadowing what will happen. This technique eases some of the medical suspense, but does it heighten other aspects of her message? From a patient’s point of view, do you find her suggestions for improving medical training insightful or not?\n\nWed, January 8 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Also Human: The Inner Lives of Doctors by Caroline Elton\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, D. Phil\n\nCaroline Elton is a vocational psychologist who has worked with doctors, mostly in England, for the past twenty years. In her book Also Human: The Inner Lives of Doctors (2018), she offers brief case histories of many of the doctors who have sought her professional help. Elton acknowledges the longstanding image of the doctor as an embodiment of stoic strength, and she notes how sensitive it is to talk about doctors as being subject to disease and disability, especially of a psychiatric kind. She takes the reader through many issues that can arise in a doctor’s life, including the emotional difficulties experienced during medical training, the pressures of choosing a specialization, finding oneself sexually attracted to a patient, and the inclination to leave medicine altogether because of a bad patient outcome. Elton discusses responses within medicine to address the problems of stress and anxiety doctors experience, including greater institutional awareness of these issues, Schwartz Rounds, and the lesser-known Balint groups. The substance of the book is Elton’s reporting of case histories and the findings of broader medical surveys, and the reader also gets a rather extensive account (incidentally) of how medical institutions function in the U.K. Some might wish for a more engaged analysis of a number of issues raised in the text, including the alleged “conspiracy of silence” among doctors on mental health issues in the profession, but the stories Elton relates are thought-provoking, and they will certainly provide valuable material for discussion and reflection when our group meets in January.\n\n2019 SCHEDULE & NOTES\n\nWed, Dec 11 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: The Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nThe 1980s AIDS crisis in Chicago is the setting for Rebecca Makkai’s award-winning novel, The Great Believers. The narrative is split between the extended social circle of Yale Tishman, a young gay man living in Chicago in 1985, and the survivors of that social circle in the year 2015. Makkai’s research and interviews with people who lived through the early AIDS crisis give the story a strong quality of authenticity and realism. The novel beautifully evokes not just the fear and frustration that abounded at that time, but the massive sense of loss we are still left with.\n\nWed, Nov 13 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Why We Revolt : A patient revolution for careful and kind care by Victor Montori\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, DPhil\n\nVictor Montori is an endocrinologist who grew up and trained in Peru and who now practices at the Mayo Clinic. In November we’ll discuss his book Why We Revolt: A Patient Revolution for Careful and Kind Care (2017). The title is somewhat misleading about the book’s content and tone. Montori offers a meditative analysis of what he describes as the current “healthcare industry” and of how its functioning degrades the clinician-patient relationship. And he makes the point that this system damages not only patients but also doctors and other healthcare providers. Genuine care is “co-created” by the patient and the clinician through a process of listening, imparting, and shared decision-making that Montori likens to a creative dance. But this kind of dancing is increasingly rare in the factory-like conditions of present-day healthcare. Montori’s diagnosis of systemic problems in modern medicine will be familiar, but he makes some thoughtful points about possible remedies, including a new emphasis not just on efficiency but on the “elegance” of care, as well as on building a culture of “solidarity” between patient and doctor. He believes that real change is both desirable and possible, though he acknowledges that it will take time, just as building a cathedral is the work of many generations. We look forward to hearing your responses to Montori’s specific claims and to his overall vision for healthcare—and you’ll even find a reference to Hubert Humphrey!\n\nWed, Oct 9 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Teeth: The Story of Beauty, Inequality, and the Struggle for Oral Health in America by Mary Otto\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD, MA\n\nIn Teeth, author and veteran health journalist Mary Otto exposes the silent oral health crisis that pervades America. Otto reveals important connections, sometimes hidden, sometimes overlooked or ignored, between oral disease and inequalities in our society. Millions of people with chronic oral health problems, disproportionately the elderly and people of color, suffer poor job prospects, low education, stunted social mobility, and a problematic public health system. Otto describes how historically, despite evidence that oral health and general bodily health are closely related, dental health became separated from mainstream medicine. This book sparks a reflective conversation we invite you to join about why our teeth matter, unsettling truths in our unequal society and the extent and meaning of this oral health crisis.\n\nWed, Sept 11 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Educated: A Memoir by Tara Westover\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nEducated, the best-selling debut memoir by Tara Westover, tells the story of Westover’s upbringing in a family dominated by her violent survivalist father. Westover grows up in a rural community near the Utah/Idaho border. Her family’s roots are in Mormonism, but her father distorts their faith to justify his personal paranoias about medicine, education, government and “the illuminati.” Because of their geographic and social isolation, Westover grows up knowing of the larger world only what her despotic father will allow. Despite the physical and emotional abuse she endures as a young person, Westover senses there is a larger world beyond her family’s compound and is determined to discover it. Her quest for education takes her first to Brigham Young University and ultimately to a PhD in history at Cambridge. Her astounding and inspiring story of survival has been praised by people as diverse as Barack Obama and Bill Gates.

As the title suggests, Sweet addresses the fast pace of modern medicine and how it might not be as efficient or effective as a more thorough—albeit slower—approach to working with patients and colleagues. She calls us to attention through carefully crafted stories of her own family and of the patients she has encountered as a physician. She asks us to consider the consequences of hurrying, intensifying, and commodifying medical treatment. Perhaps controversially, she considers the place of prayers and perceived miracles in her approach and proposes “no” as an appropriate form of slow medicine when a patient or family asks that “everything” be done.\n\nWed, July 10 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Natural Causes: An Epidemic of Wellness, the Certainty of Dying, and Killing Ourselves to Live Longer by Barbara Ehrenreich\n\nFacilitator: Maureen Mathison, PhD\n\nNot one to accept the status quo on issues, Susan Ehrenreich has taken on our fear of youthfulness and mortality. With a PhD in cellular immunology, she has an ongoing interest in wellness and health. To a certain point. Rather than falling prey to our culture’s preoccupation with ageless longevity, she settles into the comfortable position of accepting aging as a natural process. What precipitated her questioning of our obsession with health and wellness was an article in Scientific American that “reported that the immune system actually abets the growth of tumors, which is like saying that the fire department is indeed staffed by arsonists.” Given that the body has its own mechanisms, why do we think we can control it through our regimen of rigid diets and hours at the gym, efforts that attempt to stave off aging, ill-health, and dying? Natural Causes provides much to think about in terms of quality of life and living joyously, knowing that ultimately we all meet the same fate.\n\nWed, June 12 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Through a Long Absence: Words from My Father’s Wars by Joy Passanante\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, PhD, MFA\n\nWinner of the 2017 INDIES Book of the Year Silver Award for Biography, Through a Long Absence: Words from My Father’s Wars is the captivating account of Bart Passanante, a young Army surgeon deployed with the 91st Evacuation Hospital during World War II. We read of harrowing surgical scenes but also pastoral landscapes from North Africa to Italy, England to France, Holland to Germany. Drawing on his four-volume diary, hundreds of letters to his wife, his paintings and photographs, Joy Passanante uses her father’s words to reconstruct the time he was absent, the years he and her mother never talked about. In this way, Through a Long Absence is also the story of Bart and Bertie, first-generation Americans growing up in St. Louis. Bart is the Italian foster child of a small-time gangster, graduating from medical school; Bertie, a seventeen-year-old Jewish girl, graduating from high school and forbidden to date a Gentile. In chapters alternating between Europe and St. Louis, we learn of Bart’s other “wars,” including conflicts in his unusual childhood--time torn from piano practice to bootleg—and the impact of his absence on his young marriage. In this way, Through a Long Absence is also a memoir of a daughter discovering herself through the writing of her father’s life, especially after he lost the ability to speak.\n\nFor our discussion, we’ll be honored to have as our guest and co-facilitator Joy Passanante. The author of a novel, short story collection, and poetry chapbook, Passanante is former associate director of the Creative Writing at the University of Idaho. She has described her father as “a Renaissance man, a doctor, pianist and artist,” which suggests a good starting point for our discussion.

J. Marion Sims was a renowned surgeon who practiced in the early 19th century in Alabama and New York. He invented the speculum and pioneered surgical treatment for fistulas, a condition resulting from lengthy births that leaves women incontinent. What has been called into question is whether Sims, lauded as the “father of gynecology,” obtained consent from and provided anesthesia to his patients, enslaved black women. The issue continues to be debated in professional journals ranging from Female Pelvic Medical Reconstructive Surgery to the Journal of Medical Ethics to Ethnic Health as well as in the popular press, including The Atlantic and The Washington Post last year. Mend adds a unique voice, literally. The book is a collection of poems written in the voices of the only three black women whose names are known: Anarcha, Betsey, and Lucy. Interspersed with their harrowing yet tender narratives are excerpts from Sims’ autobiography and references to the author’s own medical experiences. The juxtaposition not only humanizes abstract ethical issues; it challenges us as readers to reconsider history and the role poetry can play in fully imagining the past.\n\nWed,\n\nMarch 13\n\nUU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: From Here to Eternity by Caitlin Doughty\n\nFacilitator: Jenny Cochrane, MA\n\nSir Bentley Purchase, Coroner of London from 1930-1958, was once described as a man who found every aspect of death incredibly amusing; in her book From Here to Eternity, mortician Caitlin Doughty follows in his shoes. Full of gallows humor and perceptive, humane, and intriguing insights into humankind’s customs surrounding death, Doughty takes us on a journey throughout the United States and around the world on a cultural quest to find “the good death.” She explores the idea of what it means to treat the dead with dignity and how the way we tend to our dead impacts on individual feelings about death, mortality, and the way we expect our own body to exit this life. Warning: reading this book may cause you to rethink your own funeral plans and perhaps opt to be mummified and kept in your family home, or possibly become a grant-wishing human skull in Bolivia.\n\nWed, February 13\n\nUU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: The Two Kinds of Decay: A Memoir\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, PhD, MFA\n\nSarah Manguso begins with an unusual disclaimer for a memoir: “The disease has been in remission seven years. Now I can try to remember what happened. Not understand. Just remember.” In short, spare chapters, she recounts vivid memories from hernine-year experience with chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, a very rare condition “something like a chronic form of Guillain-Barre syndrome but not exactly…there isn’t a proper name for it yet.” What emerges is an exploration of language--how physicians use it; how she as a patient uses it—to describe and cope with illness. Manguso’s writing is precise, concise, and emotionally honest, so that by the book’s conclusion, we do come to an understanding of empathy.\n\nWed, January 9 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Stay with Me by Ayobami Adebayo\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD\n\nStay With Me tells the story of a young couple in Nigeria who navigate marriage, infertility, and illness amidst familial and cultural expectations that mix ancient ideas and modern sensibilities. Yejide, the narrator, searches for a miracle that will bring the child that she and her husband Akin so badly desire, while her husband’s family seeks the same ending by bringing Akin a second wife. Stay With Me is Nigerian author Ayobami Adebayo’s first novel, and was on the shortlist for the 2018 Welcome Book Prize, which called it “the heart-breaking tale of what wanting a child can do to a person, a marriage and a family; a powerful and vivid story of what it means to love not wisely but too well.”\n\n2018 SCHEDULE & NOTES\n\n2017 SCHEDULE & NOTES\n\n2016 SCHEDULE & NOTES\n\nWed, Dec 14 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter by Kate Clifford Larson\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, D.Phil.\n\nIn Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter (2015), Kate Clifford Larson tells the story of a special-needs child in a famous American family. The third child and first daughter of Joseph and Rose Kennedy, Rosemary experienced serious developmental and intellectual delays, and this set her apart among her high-achieving siblings. Larson sketches the cultural milieu that influenced how the Kennedy parents attempted to deal with Rosemary’s needs. These include the Catholic Church, Irish Boston politics, and various early twentieth-century efforts to understand and address the problems faced by children with disabilities. Larson explores the complicated dynamics of the Kennedy family, including the marriage of Joe and Rose and the very high parental expectations they imposed on their children. The book is a portrait of an American family of great consequence, and Larson offers a thought-provoking exploration of the evolving medical and educational responses to special-needs children during the twentieth century.\n\nWed, Nov 9 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: We are All Completely Beside Ourselves: A Novel by Karen Joy Fowler\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nRosemary Cooke and her twin sister Fern had a happy childhood until they were five years old and Fern was mysteriously sent away from the family, a loss that devastated young Rosemary. What readers of Karen Joy Fowler’s novel, We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves soon learn is that, while Rosemary is human, her “sister” is a chimpanzee and their unusual living arrangement has been orchestrated as a scientific experiment by her father, an animal behavior researcher. Inspired by similar experiments in the 1970s, Fowler’s novel explores ethical dilemmas in scientific research and the complex relationship between humans and other animals. By turns outrageously comic and deeply sad, the novel reveals the surprising impact of Fern on Rosemary and the way grief can act on a family.\n\nWed, Oct 12 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Your Face in Mine: A Novel by Jess Row\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, MFA\n\nPlastic surgery has \"a racial or ethnic component,\" according to Jess Row, whose provocative and acclaimed novel, Your Face in Mine, could be read as a support for his claim. The book begins when Kelly Thorndike, a scholar who returns to his hometown of Baltimore after the death of his Chinese wife and their daughter in a car accident, happens to encounter a man who looks eerily familiar. Only when the man addresses him does Kelly realize that the stranger was one of his closest friends: Martin Lipkin, then a white Jewish teen who played in their punk trio. Now he is Martin Wilkinson, a community leader and businessman, and he is black. After suffering psychologically most of life from \"racial dysphoria,\" Martin underwent racial reassignment surgery in Bangkok; even his wife, a black attorney, is unaware of his past. Martin's revelation launches the novel into a fascinating exploration of identity, race, and culture. It focuses less on \"passing\" than on the impact others' identity has on our own personal history and sense of self. Additionally, the novel raises ethical questions surrounding medicine, including the ends of plastic surgery. As the author is quoted, \"I wanted people to ask, 'If I could have the surgery, would I?'\"\n\nWed, Sept 14 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: On the Move: A Life by Oliver Sacks\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nOliver Sacks has been called “the poet laureate of medicine” and “the bard of brain disorders.” Not an uncontroversial figure, he is one of the pioneers in narrative medicine, or the idea that listening to patients’ unique stories is a key part of diagnosing and treating their diseases. In his 2015 memoir, On the Move: A Life, the neurologist who famously found his patients’ compulsions so fascinating turns his analytic gaze on himself, examining, among other things, his early obsession with motorcycles and weight lifting, his experimentation and addiction to drugs, and his struggle to come to terms with his homosexuality and find intimate companionship. Sacks died in 2015 and many call this last book his most revealing.\n\nWed, Aug 10\n\nUU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: The Center Cannot Hold by Elyn Saks\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD\n\nIn The Center Cannot Hold, Elyn Saks eloquently describes schizophrenia from the perspective of someone who has actually lived with its varying manifestations. Saks brings impressive scholarship in the areas of law and psychoanalysis to bear on her own life experiences, elevating this book from simply a well-written memoir to a compelling study of what it means to be mentally ill, and how institutions and laws created to help people just as often limit and stigmatize them. Saks’ writing urges the reader to reconsider many assumptions about schizophrenia and its treatment and to think deeply about ingrained concepts like normal, successful, or stable.\n\nWed, July 13 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Paula: A Memoir by Isabel Allende\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD\n\nAllende is best known for writing fiction, and particularly for the magical realism of her novels. But Paula is not fiction; rather, it is Allende’s searingly personal account of her daughter’s slow death from porphyria, a rare blood disease. This memoir is written to Paula, in a coma in the months leading up to her death, but draws on family stories from times past.\n\nWed, June 8 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: The Professor and the President by Stephen Hess\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, D.Phil.\n\nThe Professor and the President (2015), by Stephen Hess, offers a brief but focused account of the relationship between President Richard Nixon and Daniel Patrick Moynihan. They were certainly an odd pair: a career conservative politician and a liberal Sociology professor from Harvard. On being elected President in 1968, Nixon invited Moynihan to join the White House as his chief advisor for urban affairs. Moynihan accepted, and he served Nixon for the two-year period covered in this book. Hess provides a lucid account of the policy-making process that ensued, which was informed by Moynihan’s wit and vibrant intellectual life, and the book as a whole evokes quite powerfully the tumultuous years 1969 and 1970, an era of race riots in the inner cities, the Vietnam War, and campus protests. It also returns us to a time when the two major political parties were capable of working together productively, as exemplified by the Nixon-Moynihan alliance, in a manner that seems impossible today. Stephen Hess was Moynihan’s deputy at the time, and over the decades he served many Presidents as a moderate Republican. Of course this quaint political identity makes him a rara avis in the current environment, and therein lies much of the book’s interest. We are fortunate to have in our group a stray individual of this species, Dr. David Sundwall, who is no stranger to the work of crafting social policies that advance the health and well being of whole populations. I look forward to getting responses from Dr. Sundwall and from all of you to Hess’s provocative presentation of the politics of another time.\n\nWed, May 11 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Black Man in a White Coat: A Doctor’s Reflection on Race and Medicine by Damon Tweedy\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD\n\nBlack Man in A White Coat: A Doctor’s Reflection on Race and Medicine. Physician Damon Tweedy’s memoir about his training and practice includes stories from top medical centers and remote rural clinics. All of his stories are infused with his perspective as an African-American man in a field that has a troubled history with black patients and black providers. He offers first-person experiences as the subject of bias and discrimination, but also lets readers see his own assumptions and prejudices. This book opens an important discussion on how and why race matters to medicine in the United States.\n\nWed, April 13 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Lasting: Poems on Aging, Edited by Meg Files\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, MFA\n\nThis unique anthology encompasses work by more than 100 respected poets who describe in language vivid and poignant, profound and downright funny, different facets of the aging, a topic that has been requested by discussion group participants. The authors keenly observe the bodies of parents and recollect grandparents' storied lives. They translate complaints of old friends into warnings and wisdom; they imagine the lives of strangers with empathy and hope. The writers also turn inward, reflecting on their own identities as they move into and out of their 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. What emerges is a prism of the aging process that shows the inevitability of death but more exquisitely, refracts time into myriad small, rich moments of lived experience that endure. This is an anthology about the lasting quality of life.\n\nEven if poetry is not your favorite genre, I encourage you to read through this collection with impunity. If you don't like a particular poem, turn the page; find a different writer giving voice to a different perspective. I think you'll find these poems accessible and provocative, providing topics for discussion that all may join in. For example, the anticipation of loss and the relationship between words, memory, and loss are addressed respectively in \"A Brief History of Fathers\" and \"Living Room.\" Other poems in the book's first section I'd suggest reading include: \"Zahkia,\" \"The Elders\" and \"Elegy, Kahuku.\" In the second section, which centers on first-hand experience of aging, we'll discuss: \"Silent Heart Attack,\" \"That's Not Me,\" \"The Lost Garden,\" \"The Art of French Cooking,\" \"From Hafiz on Aging…,\" \"The Bookshelf,\" \"Old Man,\" \"A Woman Like Yourself,\" and \"Fana Al-Fana.\" In the last section on mortality and the finality of aging, we'll consider: \"Burial Rites,\" \"Station,\" \"Hawksbane,\" and \"Out Here.\"\n\nWed,\n\nMarch 9\n\nUU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s novel Americanah tells the story of a young Nigerian couple, Ifemelu and Obinze, who leave their home country and painfully part ways to pursue their separate academic and professional dreams in the U.S. and England. Adichie, a Nigerian-born Princeton-educated writer who continues to split her time between the U.S. and Nigeria, has a keen eye for the difficult and even ridiculous ways in which immigrants and people of color must navigate the complex issue of race. Ifemelu never felt “black” until she came to America; her blog posts, which form part of the novel, offer her frank and sometimes funny observations on the way race comes up in everyday interactions in the U.S. The story comes full circle when Ifemelu and Obinze return to Nigeria and try to reconcile who they once were with all that they’ve become.\n\nWed, February 10\n\nUU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery by Henry Marsh\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, MFA, PhD\n\nHenry Marsh is recognized as one of Britain's leading neurosurgeons and his memoir is ranked among the top 100 books for 2015 by the New York Times. It is a \"frank and absorbing account [that] combines biography, descriptions of operations and considerations of policy.\" Each chapter begins with a definition of the medical term that serves as the title. Many are commonly known—\"Aneurysm\" and \"Glioblastoma\"; others--\"Angor anima\"--not so much. The stories that follow, however, are unique, as the 65-year-old surgeon describes not only technical difficulties of operations in intimate detail but the emotional predicaments. \"The surgeon is now a villain and perpetrator, or at best, incompetent, no longer heroic and all-powerful,\" he writes after visiting a patient he \"damaged.\" What sets Marsh's memoir apart is the candor of his reflections. As he notes in \"Hubris,\" \"this was the time when I became a little sadder but, I would like to think, much wiser.\" Whether physicians, other health-care professionals, or the public, readers certainly benefit from Marsh's honesty and insight. For our discussion, I suggest we focus on the chapters: \"Melodrama,\" \"Tic douloureux,\" \"Hubris,\" Photopsia,\" and \"Tyrosine kinase.\"\n\nWed, January 6 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of talk in the Digital Age by Sherry Turkle\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, D. Phil\n\nSherry Turkle’s Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in the Digital Age (2015) asks us to evaluate the effects of technology on our fundamental human interactions. Her thesis is that digital technology is undermining our capacity for conversation, and with it the opportunity for developing our capacities for self-reflection and empathy. The book takes its place, for our group, in quite a long history of reading about human conversation, including Montaigne’s celebration of the creativity of talk from the 16th century and the recent Difficult Conversations. We’ve also had many discussions over the years about speaking and listening in the context of health care relationships. Turkle’s book raises an important cultural question for our time, and I look forward to hearing and discussing our responses. Clearly the Medicine and Literature Discussion Group is one antidote to the problem diagnosed in Turkle’s work!\n\n2015 SCHEDULE & NOTES\n\nWed, Dec 2 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: The Children Act by Ian McEwan\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nIn Ian McEwan’s novel, The Children Act, well-respected British High Court Judge, Fiona Maye, has made a career of bringing “reasonableness to hopeless situations.” In her toughest case yet, she must decide whether Adam Henry, a Jehovah’s Witness with leukemia, will be compelled to forsake his religion and undergo lifesaving blood transfusions. Making the decision more difficult is the fact that Adam is almost 18, the age at which he would be able to make his own decision under English law. In considering her decision, Fiona confronts several conflicting ideals: the protection of children, the sanctity of life, parental authority, patient autonomy, and religious freedom. Not a writer of simple polemics, McEwan further complicates matters by putting Fiona’s marriage in jeopardy and infusing her own personal vulnerabilities into the story.\n\nWed, Nov 4 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion\n\nFacilitator: Aden Ross, PhD\n\nThe Rosie Project, by Graeme Simsion, is a lighthearted novel about a serious subject. Don Tillman, a genetics professor, leads a life of tightly structured routine and excessive regimentation, dividing his endeavors into “Problems” and “Projects,” including cooking, sleeping and eating. His rigid constraints serve him well enough until he decides that he needs a wife—the Wife Problem, which we recognize is a subdivision of the People Problem. To solve the wife issue, he characteristically develops a questionnaire to filter out unsuitable candidates. Enter Rosie Jarman, the most unsuitable candidate imaginable—irrational, vegetarian and late.\n\nBecause of Don’s literal-mindedness, insensitivity to social cues and revulsion at being touched, his behavior certainly falls within the spectrum of autism disorders; but it also makes him a lovable and unwittingly comic narrator. Whether or not Don has Asperger’s Syndrome is less relevant than recognizing in him traits we all recognize in our family members, our friends and, possibly, in ourselves.\n\nThis is a discussion about the power of emotion, the possibility of change and the importance of eccentricity. The Rosie Project a quick and charming read, but a substantive one.\n\nWed, Oct 7 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: The Anatomy Lesson: A Novel by Nina Siegal\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, MFA\n\nThis historical novel artistically fleshes out one of medicine’s most well-known paintings, Rembrandt’s The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, on multiple levels. Nina Siegal draws upon six years of research in Amsterdam to vividly reimagine the city in 1632, a significant time for the evolving science of medicine. Tulp, newly appointed city anatomist, commissioned the artwork to memorialize himself as well as instruct apprentice surgeons; attendees paid to view the dissection, in contrast to the prior raucous public executions and dissections of the criminals’ corpses.\n\nThe novel creatively conveys this historical shift through characters’ alternating points of view in what might be termed a literary dissection. Siegal infuses life into the painting’s corpse by giving voice to various body parts. Chapters entitled “The Hands” provide a personal portrait of Tulp; “The Eyes” describe Rembrandt as a young artist; and “The Mind” tells of Renee Descartes whom the author imaginatively places at the dissection. Straddling history and fiction are “The Body” chapters, based on historical details about Aris Kindt, a petty thief whose body is the famed corpse. Siegal poignantly imagines not only Kindt’s early life but also Flora, a young woman who reveals yet another perspective on life in “The Heart.”\n\nLike the painting, the novel raises provocative questions concerning dissection and anatomy, science and art, religion and epistemology. How does the scientific truth Tulp presents relate to the artistic truth Rembrandt strives for in his novel group portrait? How does Descartes’ presence influence the anatomy lesson? As you read, consider whether the novel influences the ways in which you look at the individuals in the painting, particularly Tulp and Kindt. What is the relationship between what we see and what we know?\n\nWed, Sept 2 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Can't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?: A Memoir by Roz Chast\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD\n\nRoz Chast’s book Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant? is subtitled A Memoir, and it is a memoir, but not of just one person. This is a memoir of a family. The book centers on the relationship between Chast, a nationally celebrated cartoonist, and her parents as they age and pass away. Chast’s words and images work together in this book to tell a complicated story of love, frustration, fear, and peace. The story is not a simple one and not told in an entirely linear fashion, but will resonate with anyone who has participated in the aging and dying process with elders. Although the subject matter is sometimes grim, Chast’s wit and sharp attention to detail leads to many humorous moments and a satisfying conclusion.\n\nWed, Aug 12\n\n(NOTE DATE CHANGE!)\n\nLDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr\n\nFacilitator: Aden Ross, PhD\n\n“All the Light We Cannot See,” by Anthony Doerr, is one of the most compelling and best written novels in years, justifiably earning the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Set in the final months of World War II, the novel follows the lives of Marie-Laure, a blind French girl, and Werner, a German orphan conscripted by the Hitler Youth. When the Nazis occupy Paris, Marie-Laure and her beloved father flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo by the sea, taking with them one of France’s most valuable jewels from the Museum of Natural History.\n\nJumping back and forward in time, Doerr slowly interweaves the lives of both characters, paralleling Werner’s growing expertise with electricity and radios and Marie-Laure’s exquisitely rendered exploration of the natural and emotional worlds through her father’s eyes. The plot, suspenseful enough to keep you up at night, culminates in a scene where Marie-Laure is trapped in her hiding place as the town burns under Allied bombardment and a Nazi officer tracks her to steal the jewel. Apart from complex characters and an appropriately labyrinthine structure, Doerr’s style mixes vivid scientific details with gorgeous poetic metaphors, a true symbiosis of science and art. More than that, he explores vital issues. How can anyone remain good in the face of the violence and destruction of war? How is science simultaneously an instrument of wonder—and death? What comprises a person’s conscience—or an apparent lack thereof? How can one distinguish “good” and “evil” in war?\n\nAt one point, Doerr reminds us that all light is mathematically invisible and that the brain can create light in darkness. Between Marie-Laure’s blindness and Werner’s entrapment in radio waves, this novel ultimately asks each of us, what is all the light we cannot see?”\n\nWed, July 1 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Falling Into the Fire: A Psychiatrist's Encounters with the Mind in Crisis by Christine Montross\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD\n\nMontross, with an MD and an MFA in poetry, is ideally positioned as a physician-writer to show us into her world of inpatient psychiatry. She offers insight into the treatment of people in crisis due to mental illness, offering stories of some of her most challenging encounters as a psychiatrist. With “asylums\" long gone, replaced by improved but uneven systems for promoting and preserving mental health, Montross asks hard questions about how to help.\n\nWed, June 3 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Destiny of the Republic by Candace Millard\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, D.Phil.\n\nCandice Millard’s The Destiny of the Republic (2011) explores a little known moment in U.S. history: the nomination and brief Presidency of James A. Garfield, who was elected in 1880. Some famous nineteenth-century figures enter the story, including Joseph Lister and Alexander Graham Bell. A young and vigorous President, Garfield was shot early in his first term. He lingered for over two months, in great suffering, before his death in September 1881. Millard’s book becomes a striking medical drama as she recounts the political and theoretical dimensions of the President’s treatment. This is arguably the best part of the book, and it will be of genuine interest to our group. Lister’s theory and practice of antisepsis had been in place in England for fifteen years, but his ideas were still not accepted by the American medical establishment, and Garfield’s death was the result of massive infection. The development of workable X-ray technology was more than a decade in the future, and Bell, who had already invented the telephone, tried to locate the bullet in Garfield’s body through the use of a primitive metal detector. A role was also played by John Wesley Powell, a good friend of Garfield’s who had passed famously down Utah’s Green and Colorado Rivers a decade before. Working with the Department of the Navy, Powell constructed an air-conditioning system to keep Garfield comfortable as he lay dying in the sweltering White House. Millard’s book provides a compelling account of American medicine in the late 1800s—at the defining moment when it is called upon to save a President--and the broader culture of the time emerges in the historical tapestry of her narrative.\n\nWed, May 6 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook:The Empathy Exams by Leslie Jamison\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nLeslie Jamison’s collection of essays, The Empathy Exams, covers many topics, from paid medical actors to reality TV to incarceration to sentimentality in literature to practices of self-harm, all of which lead back to her central question--how can we understand the pain of others? Jamison has been compared to Joan Didion for her emotional sensitivity and intellectual rigor. The book won the Graywolf Nonfiction Award in 2014.\n\nWed, April 1 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Body & Soul: Narratives of Healing From Ars Medica, edited by Allison Crawford et al.\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, MFA\n\nSharing stories as a means of knowing others continues to be a guiding principle for the editors who compiled Body & Soul: Narratives of Healing from Ars Medica. The anthology of stories, essays, poems, photographs, and drawings originally published in Ars Medica: A Journal of Medicine, the Arts, and Humanities is intended to help especially patients and medical practitioners better understand each other’s perspective on what it means to be ill. “Illness,” writes one of the authors, “is a test of relationship, of values, and of faith…a test that, once passed, continues nonetheless.” With that in mind, the editors have included stories by family members and friends, as well as by patients and practitioners, which are categorized into seven areas of health care. Each story expresses with intelligence, insight, and eloquence a unique aspect of illness; together, the many voices and genres convey the rich complexity of life; the suffering as well as the compassion that illness reveals.\n\nOur discussion will begin with “On Pathography.” Since there are many stories to choose from, I suggest that, in addition to your favorites, we focus on: “Hands: A Suite of Stories”; “My Little Heart Attack”; “On the Loss and Reconstruction of the Self”; “The Cure of Metaphor”; “I, Michael”; “Unpacking My Daughter’s Library”; “Something Happened”; “The Right Thing to Say”; “The Wong-Baker Scale”; “Denial”; “Refugees in Southeast Asia”; “Mid-winter Night / Summer Party”; and “Making Images.”\n\nWed,\n\nMarch 4\n\nLDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by Atul Gawande\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nAtul Gawande, MD, MPH, is a distinguished surgeon, writer, and medical ethicist.

In his new book, Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, Gawande, provoked by the death of his father from cancer, turns his attention to individual priorities at the end of life and medicine’s proper role in supporting these priorities.

Johnson writes in a vivid style that allows readers to see the mystery unraveling for the physicians, government officials, and general public at that time. Somewhat controversially, Johnson frames the stories of the people living through that terrible epidemic in terms of how lessons learned more than 150 years ago apply to today’s health and environmental crises.\n\nWed, January 7 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: My Beloved World by Sonia Sotomayor\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, D. Phil\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor is the third woman and the first Hispanic to serve on the United States Supreme Court. She began her tenure as a Justice in 2009 and published her memoir, My Beloved World, in 2013. Her book is a remarkably candid account of her years growing up in a Puerto Rican community in the Bronx; her education at Princeton and Yale; and her career as an attorney up to the time of her appointment as a Federal District Judge in 1992. Early in her childhood, Justice Sotomayor was diagnosed with diabetes, and dealing with this chronic disease is an important part of the personal story she relates in the text. There are some fascinating glimpses into the medical world of New York in the 1960s, and she discusses how coping with the disease has contributed to her independence and self-discipline. She also writes about a volunteer program she started at the Trenton Psychiatric Hospital during her Princeton years, her first experience in direct community service. She was moved to do this by the poverty and isolation of the patients and the shortage of Spanish speakers on the staff. While telling her story Justice Sotomayor engages with a rich variety of issues, from childhood to the workings of the criminal justice system, and as a person she emerges as both highly analytical and alert to the power of poetry.\n\n2014 SCHEDULE & NOTES\n\nWed, Dec 17\n\nBook: Billy Lyn's Long Halftime Walk by Ben Fountain (same book as below, different location for discussion)\n\nTHIS SESSION HAS BEEN CANCELED--PLEASE CONSIDER ATTENDING DECEMBER 3RD MEETING ABOUT THE SAME BOOK\n\nWed, Dec 3 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: Billy Lyn's Long Halftime Walk by Ben Fountain (same book as above, different location for discussion)\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nThe novel, Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk, takes place on Thanksgiving Day when decorated Iraq war veterans from Bravo Squad are scheduled to appear alongside Destiny’s Child as part of the overblown spectacle at a Dallas Cowboys football game. With a satirical pen, Ben Fountain skewers Americans’ pieties about the war, our infatuation with football, our facile patriotism, and the all-too-common lack of real empathy for veterans. He also creates a winning, reluctant protagonist in Private Billy Lynn. This darkly funny novel has been called the Catch-22 of the Iraq war and was a finalist for the National Book Award in 2012.\n\nWed, Nov 5 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: The Leopard by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa\n\nFacilitator: Mark Matheson, D. Phil\n\nGiuseppe di Lampedusa’s The Leopard was his only novel, and he died in 1957 while trying to get it published. The book first appeared in 1958, and it soon became the basis for a feature film by Luchino Visconti, which was released in 1963 with Burt Lancaster in the title role. (Please try to watch this film before our discussion.) The Leopard is a historical novel set in Sicily from 1860 to 1910, and it represents the transition from an older European aristocratic society to nationalism, capitalism, and modern representative government. The central character is Prince Don Fabrizio Salina, the Leopard, whom Lampedusa based on his own great-grandfather. The Prince takes seriously his obligations to longstanding traditions and the old social order, of which the Catholic Church is a bulwark. But he moves pragmatically to try to hold onto his high position as social and ideological changes break across the generally inert world of Sicilian life. His nephew Tancredi is his hope for the future—he regards him as far more spirited and noble than his own children—and he seeks to marry him to Angelica, the beautiful daughter of a local mayor who has become unexpectedly rich in the new commercial economy. The novel offers a subtle exploration of the Prince’s inner life and his responses to the decline of the privileged social class to which he belongs. It contrasts the emerging world of modernity, in which money will become the ruling force, with an older aristocratic society based on monarchy, a caste system, and traditional prejudices. Lampedusa’s evocation of this historical process and its consequences for individual characters is both ideologically deft and richly sensuous. Our reading of the novel will be a chance for us to consider issues of social class, inner lives, and historical change in our own country and time—and also the costs and benefits of the complicated process that produced modern society.\n\nWed, Oct 1 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: Yellow Birds by Kevin Powers\n\nFacilitator: Rachel Borup, PhD\n\nKevin Powers' 2012 novel, The Yellow Birds, was awarded Finalist for The National Book Award for its moving depiction of a soldier's desperate experiences in the Iraq War 2003-2009. Powers, a veteran of this war with an MFA in poetry from the University of Texas at Austin, writes poetically about the psychological traumas that have devastated this generation of soldiers. This session in October is the first in a two-part series on the theme of the war in Iraq; the second session in December will consider Ben Fountain's novel, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, also a National Book Award Finalist. Participants are invited to join us for either or both sessions.\n\nWed, Sept 17 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: What Doctors Feel by Danielle Ofri\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, MFA\n\nIn her fifth book, Danielle Ofri investigates what she calls medicine’s elephant-in-the-room: physicians’ emotions. The internist at New York’s Bellevue Hospital wrote How Doctors Feel in response to the “emotional conundrum” she and other physicians experienced when they were faced with telling a patient they had cared for, and cared deeply about, that she would die. Chapters rich with description about Ofri’s relationship with this patient, Julia who has congestive heart failure, alternate with longer chapters that explore emotions, ranging from fear of misdiagnosis to grief over a patient’s death to empathy as “clinical curiosity” to disillusionment with the practice of medicine. Ofri draws upon extended interviews with other physicians and research articles, in addition to her own experiences as a medical student, resident, and attending physician, to consider how positive and negative emotions influence patient care. Ofri masterfully tells stories to illustrate her points, although she never claims to know the answers, which makes the book, as one reviewer says, “an invaluable guide for doctors and patients on how to ‘recognize and navigate the emotional subtexts’ of the doctor-patient relationship.” We will begin our discussion with the chapters “Drowning,” “Scared Witless,” and “Burning with Shame.”\n\nWed, Sept 3 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: Season of the Body: Essays by Brenda Miller\n\nFacilitator: Susan Sample, MFA\n\nHow our bodies give shape to our most intimate relationships is explored by Brenda Miller in Seasons of the Body. Although she shares memories from her childhood, the twenty essays in the collection focus on the years often designated as a woman’s “fertile” period, her twenties and thirties. For Miller, these decades are notable for the losses she bears. She suffers two miscarriages and, at age twenty, is told she will never have children; her mother took DES during her pregnancy. She ends a long-term relationship with a man who wants children and another with a man who has two children. Yet she also volunteers to hold preemies in an NBICU and develops a close relationship with her godson. Through these experiences, Miller re-envisions the “emptiness” of her body in prose that touches and teaches all bodies. Her writing combines an exquisite sensitivity she learned and practiced as a massage therapist, with intelligence and eloquence honed during her graduate study in creative writing at the University of Utah. For our discussion, we will focus on the chapters: “Needlepoint,” “Names,” “A Thousand Buddhas,” “Artifacts,” “Infant Ward,” “Time with Children,” and “Seasons of the Body.”\n\nWed, Aug 6 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: Being Dead by Jim Crace\n\nFacilitator: Aden Ross, PhD\n\nLike the title of this book, Jim Crace anatomizes the phenomenon not of dying but of being dead. Readers of Quarantine, his fictional study of Christ wandering the desert with other religious zealots, might expect some consolations of an afterlife. Not so. Being Dead begins unforgettably with an almost medical description of two bodies slowly decomposing on a sand dune, a middle-aged married couple inexplicably and brutally murdered. Never one to follow his readers’ expectations, Crace moves outward from that mesmerizing scene, winding together four narrative strands. While one strand tracks the dead couple’s decomposition, another traces the day of their death and backtracks to their initial meeting thirty years earlier. A fourth narrative strand follows their semi-estranged daughter’s increasingly urgent search for their bodies.\n\nThe result, a kind of reverse entropy, parallels the macrocosmic world of human life with the microcosm of maggots and flies, all with a style mixing scientific precision and unexpected beauty. Our discussion will probably encompass contemporary definitions of death as well as the extraordinary measures medicine takes to keep patients “alive.” But ultimately, like a memento mori, this novel challenges us to contemplate our own human life within the natural order, to reflect on our own growth and decay, to value the ephemerality of love.\n\nWed, July 2 LDSH Pugh Boardroom\n\nBook: Post Mortem by Phillip Mackowiak\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD\n\nPost Mortem: Solving History’s Great Medical Mysteries doesn’t solve every medical mystery, but does address the conditions of twelve important historical figures, from Akhenaten to Joan of Arc to Booker T. Washington. Author Philip Mackowiak is both a physician and historian of medicine, and draws on these dual specialties to give a detective’s attention to the lives and deaths of these famous people.\n\nWed, June 18 UU Hosp Large Conf Rm W1220\n\nBook: Five Days at Memorial by Sheri Fink (same book as below, different location for discussion)\n\nFacilitator: Gretchen Case, PhD\n\nFive Days at Memorial is a careful, in-depth look at "
