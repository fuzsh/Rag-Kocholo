        "text": "Executive summary: Cesarean delivery, or section (CS), is the single most common surgical procedure performed. Estimates indicate that in low resource settings, CS comprises up to 50% of more of the total volume of operations performed. The World Health Organization recommends national CS rates of between 10-15% to save lives and improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Population-based work indicates that CS rates of up to 19% are demonstrably related to improved maternal and neonatal survival. However, complications are common, and gynecological and obstetric surgical interventions are associated with high rates of morbidity. In low resource settings, complication rates are particularly high. The intervention being tested is based on a previously developed program called Clean Cut. Clean Cut is an adaptive, multimodal surgical infection prevention program that integrates perioperative process improvement and patient outcomes measurement using process mapping, training and improved management practices, and compliance with critical standards of surgical antisepsis. It was successfully piloted in five surgical departments in Ethiopia, and reduced the relative risk of infection by 35%. This has been adapted specifically for obstetric and gynecological operations and will be evaluated in a cluster randomized stepped wedge trial design in ten maternity hospitals/departments in Ethiopia in order to reduce infections and other complications for women undergoing cesarean delivery and other obstetric and gynecologic operations.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial. For more information, please contact Thomas Weiser, xxx-xxxx.\n\nView full details\n\nAbstract\n\nSurgical infections are a major cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in low-resource settings. Clean Cut, a 6-month quality improvement program developed by the global nonprofit organization Lifebox, has demonstrated improvements in postoperative infectious complications. However, the pilot program required intense external programmatic and resource support.To examine the improvement in adherence to infection prevention and control standards and rates of postoperative infections in hospitals in the Clean Cut program after implementation strategies were updated and program execution was refined.This cohort study evaluated and refined the Clean Cut implementation strategy to enhance scalability based on a qualitative study of its pilot phase, including formalizing programmatic and educational materials, building an automated data entry and analysis platform, and reorganizing hospital-based team composition. Clean Cut was introduced from January 1, 2019, to February 28, 2022, in 7 Ethiopian hospitals that had not previously participated in the program. Prospective data initiated on arrival in the operating room were collected, and patients were followed up through hospital discharge and with 30-day follow-up telephone calls.Implementation of the refined Clean Cut program.The primary outcome was surgical site infection (SSI); secondary outcomes were adherence to 6 infection prevention standards, mortality, hospital length of stay, and other infectious complications.A total of 3364 patients (mean [SD] age, 26.5 [38.0] years; 2196 [65.3%] female) from 7 Ethiopian hospitals were studied (1575 at baseline and 1789 after intervention). After controlling for confounders, the relative risk of SSIs was reduced by 34.0% after program implementation (relative risk, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54-0.81; P < .001). Appropriate Surgical Safety Checklist use increased from 16.3% to 43.0% (P < .001), surgeon hand and patient skin antisepsis improved from 46.0% to 66.0% (P < .001), and timely antibiotic administration improved from 17.8% to 39.0% (P < .001). Surgical instrument (38.7% vs 10.2%), linen sterility (35.5% vs 12.8%), and gauze counting (89.2% vs 82.5%; P < .001 for all comparisons) also improved significantly.A modified implementation strategy for the Clean Cut program focusing on reduced external resource and programmatic input from Lifebox, structured education and training materials, and wider hospital engagement resulted in outcomes that matched our pilot study, with improved adherence to recognized infection prevention standards resulting in a reduction in SSIs. The demonstration of scalability reinforces the value of this SSI prevention program.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamasurg.2023.6033\n\nView details for PubMedID 38019510\n\nAbstract\n\nFirearm injury-related hospitalizations in the United States cost $900 million annually. Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), government insurance programs covered 41% of costs. This study describes the effect of ACA Medicaid expansion and state level firearm legislation on coverage and costs for firearm injuries.This cross-sectional study included 35,854,586 hospitalizations from 27 states in 2013 and 2016. Data analyses were performed in 2022. Firearm injuries were classified by mechanism: assault, unintentional, self-harm, or undetermined. Impact of ACA expansion was determined using difference-in-differences analysis. Differences in per capita costs between states with stronger and weak firearm legislation were compared using univariable and multivariable analyses.The authors identified 31,451 initial firearm injury-related hospitalizations. In states with weak firearm legislation, hospitalization costs per 100,000 residents were higher from unintentional ($25,834; p=0.04) and self-inflicted injuries ($11,550; p=0.02); there were no state-level differences in assault or total per capita firearm-related hospitalization costs. ACA expansion increased government coverage of costs by 15 percentage points (95% CI 3-29) and decreased costs to uninsured/self-pay by 14 percentage points (95% CI 6-21). In 2016, states with weak firearm legislation and no ACA expansion had the highest proportion of hospitalization costs attributed to uninsured/self-pay patients (24%, 95% CI 15-34).ACA expansion increased government coverage of hospitalizations for firearm injuries. Unintentional and self-harm costs were significantly higher for states with weak firearm legislation. States with weak firearm legislation that did not expand Medicaid had highest proportion of uninsured/self-pay patients.Economic & Value Based Evaluations, Level III.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2023.08.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 37582417\n\nAbstract\n\n80% of individuals with cancer will require a surgical procedure, yet little comparative data exist on early outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We compared postoperative outcomes in breast, colorectal, and gastric cancer surgery in hospitals worldwide, focusing on the effect of disease stage and complications on postoperative mortality.This was a multicentre, international prospective cohort study of consecutive adult patients undergoing surgery for primary breast, colorectal, or gastric cancer requiring a skin incision done under general or neuraxial anaesthesia. The primary outcome was death or major complication within 30 days of surgery. Multilevel logistic regression determined relationships within three-level nested models of patients within hospitals and countries. Hospital-level infrastructure effects were explored with three-way mediation analyses. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03471494.Between April 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2019, we enrolled 15 958 patients from 428 hospitals in 82 countries (high income 9106 patients, 31 countries; upper-middle income 2721 patients, 23 countries; or lower-middle income 4131 patients, 28 countries). Patients in LMICs presented with more advanced disease compared with patients in high-income countries. 30-day mortality was higher for gastric cancer in low-income or lower-middle-income countries (adjusted odds ratio 3·72, 95% CI 1·70-8·16) and for colorectal cancer in low-income or lower-middle-income countries (4·59, 2·39-8·80) and upper-middle-income countries (2·06, 1·11-3·83). No difference in 30-day mortality was seen in breast cancer. The proportion of patients who died after a major complication was greatest in low-income or lower-middle-income countries (6·15, 3·26-11·59) and upper-middle-income countries (3·89, 2·08-7·29). Postoperative death after complications was partly explained by patient factors (60%) and partly by hospital or country (40%). The absence of consistently available postoperative care facilities was associated with seven to 10 more deaths per 100 major complications in LMICs. Cancer stage alone explained little of the early variation in mortality or postoperative complications.Higher levels of mortality after cancer surgery in LMICs was not fully explained by later presentation of disease. The capacity to rescue patients from surgical complications is a tangible opportunity for meaningful intervention. Early death after cancer surgery might be reduced by policies focusing on strengthening perioperative care systems to detect and intervene in common complications.National Institute for Health Research Global Health Research Unit.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00001-5\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000614227700026\n\nView details for PubMedID 33485461\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7846817\n\nAbstract\n\nSurgery is an essential part of health care, but resources to ensure the availability of surgical services are often inadequate. We estimated the global distribution of operating theatres and quantified the availability of pulse oximetry, which is an essential monitoring device during surgery and a potential measure of operating theatre resources.We calculated ratios of the number of operating theatres to hospital beds in seven geographical regions worldwide on the basis of profiles from 769 hospitals in 92 countries that participated in WHO's safe surgery saves lives initiative. We used hospital bed figures from 190 WHO member states to estimate the number of operating theatres per 100,000 people in 21 subregions throughout the world. To estimate availability of pulse oximetry, we sent surveys to anaesthesia providers in 72 countries selected to ensure a geographically and demographically diverse sample. A predictive regression model was used to estimate the pulse oximetry need for countries that did not provide data.The estimated number of operating theatres ranged from 1·0 (95% CI 0·9-1·2) per 100,000 people in west sub-Saharan Africa to 25·1 (20·9-30·1) per 100,000 in eastern Europe. High-income subregions all averaged more than 14 per 100,000 people, whereas all low-income subregions, representing 2·2 billion people, had fewer than two theatres per 100,000. Pulse oximetry data from 54 countries suggested that around 77,700 (63,195-95,533) theatres worldwide (19·2% [15·2-23·9]) were not equipped with pulse oximeters.Improvements in public-health strategies and monitoring are needed to reduce disparities for more than 2 billion people without adequate access to surgical care.WHO.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60392-3\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000282411600032\n\nView details for PubMedID 20598365\n\nAbstract\n\nPublic health surveillance relies on standardised metrics to evaluate disease burden and health system performance. Such metrics have not been developed for surgical services despite increasing volume, substantial cost, and high rates of death and disability associated with surgery. The Safe Surgery Saves Lives initiative of WHO's Patient Safety Programme has developed standardised public health metrics for surgical care that are applicable worldwide. We assembled an international panel of experts to develop and define metrics for measuring the magnitude and effect of surgical care in a population, while taking into account economic feasibility and practicability. This panel recommended six measures for assessing surgical services at a national level: number of operating rooms, number of operations, number of accredited surgeons, number of accredited anaesthesia professionals, day-of-surgery death ratio, and postoperative in-hospital death ratio. We assessed the feasibility of gathering such statistics at eight diverse hospitals in eight countries and incorporated them into the WHO Guidelines for Safe Surgery, in which methods for data collection, analysis, and reporting are outlined.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000270370900034\n\nView details for PubMedID 19782877\n\nAbstract\n\nSurgery has become an integral part of global health care, with an estimated 234 million operations performed yearly. Surgical complications are common and often preventable. We hypothesized that a program to implement a 19-item surgical safety checklist designed to improve team communication and consistency of care would reduce complications and deaths associated with surgery.Between October 2007 and September 2008, eight hospitals in eight cities (Toronto, Canada; New Delhi, India; Amman, Jordan; Auckland, New Zealand; Manila, Philippines; Ifakara, Tanzania; London, England; and Seattle, WA) representing a variety of economic circumstances and diverse populations of patients participated in the World Health Organization's Safe Surgery Saves Lives program. We prospectively collected data on clinical processes and outcomes from 3733 consecutively enrolled patients 16 years of age or older who were undergoing noncardiac surgery. We subsequently collected data on 3955 consecutively enrolled patients after the introduction of the Surgical Safety Checklist. The primary end point was the rate of complications, including death, during hospitalization within the first 30 days after the operation.The rate of death was 1.5% before the checklist was introduced and declined to 0.8% afterward (P=0.003). Inpatient complications occurred in 11.0% of patients at baseline and in 7.0% after introduction of the checklist (P<0.001).Implementation of the checklist was associated with concomitant reductions in the rates of death and complications among patients at least 16 years of age who were undergoing noncardiac surgery in a diverse group of hospitals.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000262812400008\n\nView details for PubMedID 19144931\n\nAbstract\n\nLittle is known about the amount and availability of surgical care globally. We estimated the number of major operations undertaken worldwide, described their distribution, and assessed the importance of surgical care in global public-health policy.We gathered demographic, health, and economic data for 192 member states of WHO. Data for the rate of surgery were sought from several sources including governmental agencies, statistical and epidemiological organisations, published studies, and individuals involved in surgical policy initiatives. We also obtained per-head total expenditure on health from analyses done in 2004. Major surgery was defined as any intervention occurring in a hospital operating theatre involving the incision, excision, manipulation, or suturing of tissue, usually requiring regional or general anaesthesia or sedation. We created a model to estimate rates of major surgery for countries for which such data were unavailable, then used demographic information to calculate the total worldwide volume of surgery.We obtained surgical data for 56 (29%) of 192 WHO member states. We estimated that 234.2 (95% CI 187.2-281.2) million major surgical procedures are undertaken every year worldwide. Countries spending US$100 or less per head on health care have an estimated mean rate of major surgery of 295 (SE 53) procedures per 100 000 population per year, whereas those spending more than $1000 have a mean rate of 11 110 (SE 1300; p<0.0001). Middle-expenditure ($401-1000) and high-expenditure (>$1000) countries, accounting for 30.2% of the world's population, provided 73.6% (172.3 million) of operations worldwide in 2004, whereas poor-expenditure (=$100) countries account for 34.8% of the global population yet undertook only 3.5% (8.1 million) of all surgical procedures in 2004.Worldwide volume of surgery is large. In view of the high death and complication rates of major surgical procedures, surgical safety should now be a substantial global public-health concern. The disproportionate scarcity of surgical access in low-income settings suggests a large unaddressed disease burden worldwide. Public-health efforts and surveillance in surgery should be established.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000257552400028\n\nView details for PubMedID 18582931\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction: Although postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis has not been shown to prevent surgical site infections, prolonged antibiotic administration is common in low- and middle-income countries. We developed a quality improvement program to reduce unnecessary postoperative antibiotics through hospital-specific guideline development and the use of a brief, multidisciplinary discussion of antibiotic indication, choice, and duration during clinical rounds. We assessed reduction in the number of patients receiving ≥24 h of antibiotic prophylaxis after clean and clean-contaminated surgery. Methods: We piloted the program at a referral hospital in Ethiopia from February to September 2023. After a 6-week baseline assessment, multidisciplinary teams adapted international guidelines for surgical prophylaxis to local disease burden, medication availability, and cost restrictions; stakeholders from surgical departments provided feedback. Surgical teams implemented a \"timeout\" during rounds to apply these guidelines to patient care; compliance with the timeout and antibiotic administration was assessed throughout the study period. Results: We collected data from 636 patients; 159 (25%) in the baseline period and 477 (75%) in the intervention period. The percentage of patients receiving ≥24 h of antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery decreased from 50.9% in the baseline period to 40.9% in the intervention period (p = 0.027) and was associated with a 0.5 day reduction in postoperative length of stay (p = 0.047). Discussion: This antibiotic stewardship pilot program reduced postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in a resource-constrained setting in Sub-Saharan Africa and was associated with shorter length of stay. This program has the potential to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in this population.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1089/sur.2024.059\n\nView details for PubMedID 38990697\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Trauma contributes to the greatest loss of disability-adjusted life-years for adolescents and young adults worldwide. In the context of global abdominal trauma, the trauma laparotomy is the most commonly performed operation. Variation likely exists in how these patients are managed and their subsequent outcomes, yet very little global data on the topic currently exists. The objective of the GOAL-Trauma study is to evaluate both patient and injury factors for those undergoing trauma laparotomy, their clinical management and postoperative outcomes.METHODS: We describe a planned prospective multicentre observational cohort study of patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. We will include patients of all ages who present to hospital with a blunt or penetrating injury and undergo a trauma laparotomy within 5days of presentation to the treating centre. The study will collect system, patient, process and outcome data, following patients up until 30 days postoperatively (or until discharge or death, whichever is first). Our sample size calculation suggests we will need to recruit 552 patients from approximately 150 recruiting centres.DISCUSSION: The GOAL-Trauma study will provide a global snapshot of the current management and outcomes for patients undergoing a trauma laparotomy. It will also provide insight into the variation seen in the time delays for receiving care, the disease and patient factors present, and patient outcomes. For current standards of trauma care to be improved worldwide, a greater understanding of the current state of trauma laparotomy care is paramount if appropriate interventions and targets are to be identified and implemented.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/bmjopen-2023-083135\n\nView details for PubMedID 38580358\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Worldwide, approximately one in six inpatient antibiotic prescriptions are for surgical-infection prophylaxis, including postoperative prophylaxis. The WHO recommends against prolonged postoperative antibiotics to prevent surgical-site infection. However, in many low- and middle-income countries, postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is common due to perceptions that it protects against surgical-site infection and data informing recommendations against antibiotic administration are largely derived from high-income countries. The aim of this study was to describe postoperative antibiotic-prescribing patterns and related surgical-site infection rates in hospitals in low- and middle-income countries.METHODS: Patients from 19 hospitals in Ethiopia, Madagascar, India, and Bolivia with wound class I and II operations were included. Data on antibiotic administration, indication, surgical-site infection, length of hospital stay, and adherence to perioperative infection-prevention standards were collected by trained personnel. The association between postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis for greater than or equal to 24 h and surgical-site infection was analysed via modified robust Poisson regression, controlling for patient and procedural factors and degree of adherence to perioperative infection-prevention practices.RESULTS: Of 8714 patients, 92.9% received antibiotics for prophylaxis after surgery and 27.7% received antibiotics for greater than or equal to 24 h. Patients receiving postoperative prophylaxis for greater than or equal to 24 h did not have lower surgical-site infection rates (Relative risk 1.09 (95% c.i. 0.89 to 1.33); P = 0.399), but the length of hospital stay was 1.4 days longer (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Prolonged postoperative antibiotics did not reduce surgical-site infection, but pervasive use was associated with a longer length of hospital stay, in resource-limited healthcare systems. With the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, surgical initiatives to implement antimicrobial stewardship programmes in low- and middle-income countries are critical.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/bjs/znad438\n\nView details for PubMedID 38198157\n\nAbstract\n\nTraumatic thoracolumbar spine injuries are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Targeted for non-spine specialist trauma surgeons, this systematic scoping review aimed to examine literature for up-to-date evidence on presentation, management, and outcomes of thoracolumbar spine injuries in adult trauma patients.This review was reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. We searched four bibliographic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Eligible studies included experimental, observational, and evidence-synthesis articles evaluating patients with thoracic, lumbar, or thoracolumbar spine injury, published in English between January 1, 2010 and January 31, 2021. Studies which focused on animals, cadavers, cohorts with N <30, and pediatric cohorts (age <18 years old), as well as case studies, abstracts, and commentaries were excluded.A total of 2501 studies were screened, of which 326 unique studies were fully text reviewed and twelve aspects of injury management were identified and discussed: injury patterns, determination of injury status and imaging options, considerations in management, and patient quality of life. We found: (1) imaging is a necessary diagnostic tool, (2) no consensus exists for preferred injury characterization scoring systems, (3) operative management should be considered for unstable fractures, decompression, and deformity, and (4) certain patients experience significant burden following injury.In this systematic scoping review, we present the most up-to-date information regarding the management of traumatic thoracolumbar spine injuries. This allows non-specialist trauma surgeons to become more familiar with thoracolumbar spine injuries in trauma patients and provides a framework for their management.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/00031348231216479\n\nView details for PubMedID 37983195\n\nAbstract\n\nEnhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols have largely been incorporated into practice in high-income settings due to proven improvement in perioperative outcomes. We aimed to review the implementation of ERAS protocols and other perioperative optimisation strategies in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and their impact on length of hospital stay (LOS).We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Global Health (CABI), WHO Global Index Medicus, Index Medicus, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) for studies incorporating ERAS or other prehabilitation approaches in LMICs. We conducted a pooled analysis of LOS using a random-effects model to evaluate the impact of such programs. This systematic review was pre-registered on PROSPERO.We screened 1205 studies and included 70 for a full-text review; six were eligible for inclusion and five for quantitative analysis, two of which were randomised controlled trials. ERAS was compared to routine practice in all included studies, while none implemented prehabilitation or other preoperative optimisation strategies. Pooled analysis of 290 patients showed reduced LOS in the ERAS group with a standardised mean difference of -2.18 (95% confidence interval (CI) = -4.13, -.0.05, P < 0.01). The prediction interval was wide (95% CI = -7.85, 3.48) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 94%).Perioperative optimisation is feasible in LMICs and appears to reduce LOS, despite high levels of between-study heterogeneity. There is a need for high-quality data on perioperative practice in LMICs and supplementary qualitative analysis to further understand barriers to perioperative optimisation implementation.PROSPERO: CRD42021279053.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7189/jogh.13.04114\n\nView details for PubMedID 37787105\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10546475\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Pulse oximetry has been used in medical care for decades. Its use quickly became standard of care in high resource settings, with delayed widespread availability and use in lower resource settings. Pulse oximetry training initiatives have been ongoing for years, but a map of the literature describing such initiatives among health care workers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has not previously been conducted. Additionally, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic further highlighted the inequitable distribution of pulse oximetry use and training. We aimed to characterise the landscape of pulse oximetry training for health care workers in LMICs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as described in the literature.Methods: We systematically searched six databases to identify studies reporting pulse oximetry training among health care workers, broadly defined, in LMICs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts and relevant full texts for eligibility. Data were charted by one author and reviewed for accuracy by a second. We synthesised the results using a narrative synthesis.Results: A total of 7423 studies were identified and 182 screened in full. A total of 55 training initiatives in 42 countries met inclusion criteria, as described in 66 studies since some included studies reported on different aspects of the same training initiative. Five overarching reasons for conducting pulse oximetry training were identified: 1) anaesthesia and perioperative care, 2) respiratory support programme expansion, 3) perinatal assessment and monitoring, 4) assessment and monitoring of children and 5) assessment and monitoring of adults. Educational programmes varied in their purpose with respect to the types of patients being targeted, the health care workers being instructed, and the depth of pulse oximetry specific training.Conclusions: Pulse oximetry training initiatives have been ongoing for decades for a variety of purposes, utilising a multitude of approaches to equip health care workers with tools to improve patient care. It is important that these initiatives continue as pulse oximetry availability and knowledge gaps remain. Neither pulse oximetry provision nor training alone is enough to bolster patient care, but sustainable solutions for both must be considered to meet the needs of both health care workers and patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7189/jogh.13.04074\n\nView details for PubMedID 37736848\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist reduces morbidity and mortality after surgery, but uptake remains challenging. In particular, low-income countries have been found to have lower rates of checklist use compared with high-income countries. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of educational workshops on Surgical Safety Checklist use implemented as part of a quality improvement initiative in five hospitals in Ethiopia that had variable experience with the Surgical Safety Checklist.METHODS: From April 2019 to September 2020, each hospital implemented a 6-month surgical quality improvement programme, which included a Surgical Safety Checklist workshop. Statistical process control methodology was used to understand the variation in Surgical Safety Checklist compliance before and after workshops and a time-series analysis was performed using population-averaged generalized estimating equation Poisson regression. Checklist compliance was defined as correctly completing a sign in, timeout, and sign out. Incidence rate ratios of correct checklist use pre- and post-intervention were calculated and the change in mean weekly compliance was predicted.RESULTS: Checklist compliance data were obtained from 2767 operations (1940 (70 per cent) pre-intervention and 827 (30 per cent) post-intervention). Mean weekly checklist compliance improved from 27.3 to 41.2 per cent (mean difference 13.9 per cent, P = 0.001; incidence rate ratio 1.51, P = 0.001). Hospitals with higher checklist compliance at baseline had the greatest overall improvements in compliance, more than 50 per cent over pre-intervention, while low-performing hospitals showed no improvement.CONCLUSION: Surgical Safety Checklist workshops improved checklist compliance in hospitals with some experience with its use. Workshops had little effect in hospitals unfamiliar with the Surgical Safety Checklist, emphasizing the importance of multifactorial interventions and culture-change approaches. In receptive facilities, short workshops can accelerate behaviour change.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/bjs/znad234\n\nView details for PubMedID 37551706\n\nAbstract\n\nAcademic global surgery is a rapidly growing field that aims to improve access to safe surgical care worldwide. However, no universally accepted competencies exist to inform this developing field. A consensus-based approach, with input from a diverse group of experts, is needed to identify essential competencies that will lead to standardization in this field. A task force was set up using snowball sampling to recruit a broad group of content and context experts in global surgical and perioperative care. A draft set of competencies was revised through the modified Delphi process with two rounds of anonymous input. A threshold of 80% consensus was used to determine whether a competency or sub-competency learning objective was relevant to the skillset needed within academic global surgery and perioperative care. A diverse task force recruited experts from 22 countries to participate in both rounds of the Delphi process. Of the n = 59 respondents completing both rounds of iterative polling, 63% were from low- or middle-income countries. After two rounds of anonymous feedback, participants reached consensus on nine core competencies and 31 sub-competency objectives. The greatest consensus pertained to competency in ethics and professionalism in global surgery (100%) with emphasis on justice, equity, and decolonization across multiple competencies. This Delphi process, with input from experts worldwide, identified nine competencies which can be used to develop standardized academic global surgery and perioperative care curricula worldwide. Further work needs to be done to validate these competencies and establish assessments to ensure that they are taught effectively.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pgph.0002102\n\nView details for PubMedID 37450426\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10348592\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: High-quality surgical lighting is often lacking in low-resource settings. Commercial surgical headlights are unavailable due to high cost and supply and maintenance challenges. We aimed to understand user needs of a surgical headlight for low-resource settings by evaluating a preselected robust but relatively inexpensive headlight and lighting conditions.METHODS: We observed headlight use by ten surgeons in Ethiopia and six in Liberia. All surgeons completed surveys about their lighting environment and experience using headlight, and were subsequently interviewed. Twelve surgeons completed logbooks on headlight use. We distributed headlights to 48 additional surgeons, and all surgeons were surveyed for feedback.RESULTS: In Ethiopia, five surgeons ranked operating room light quality as poor or very poor; seven delayed or cancelled operations within the last year and five described intraoperative complications due to poor lighting. In Liberia, lighting was rated as \"good\", however fieldnotes, and interviews noted generator fuel-rationing, and poor lighting conditions. In both countries, the headlight was considered extremely useful. Surgeons recommended nine improvements, including comfort, durability, affordability and availability of multiple rechargeable batteries. Thematic analysis identified factors influencing headlight use, specifications and feedback, and infrastructure challenges.CONCLUSION: Lighting in surveyed operating rooms was poor. Although conditions and need for the headlights differed between Ethiopia and Liberia, headlights were considered highly useful. However, discomfort was a major limiting factor for ongoing use, and the hardest to objectively characterise for specification and engineering purposes. Specific needs for surgical headlights include comfort and durability. Refinement of a fit-for-purpose surgical headlight is ongoing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00268-023-06952-3\n\nView details for PubMedID 36864223\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough international guidelines exist for the prevention of surgical site infections, their implementation in diverse clinical contexts, especially in low and middle-income countries, is challenging due to the lack of available resources and organizational structure of facilities. The goal of this project was to develop a series of video training aids to highlight best practices in surgical infection prevention in hospitals with limited resources and to provide practical solutions to common challenges faced in these settings. Using the validated Clean Cut education framework for infection prevention developed by Lifebox, a charity devoted to improving surgical and anesthetic safety, we partnered with clinicians in one Ethiopian hospital to create six educational videos giving practical guidelines for infection prevention under resource variable conditions. These include: 1) proper use of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist, 2) hand and skin antisepsis, 3) confirming instrument sterility, 4) maintaining the sterile field, 5) antibiotic prophylaxis, and 6) gauze counting. Gaps in available online educational materials were identified in each of the six areas. Videos were created providing setting-specific education and addressing gaps in existing materials for each of the infection prevention topics. These videos are now integrated into infection prevention curricula through Lifebox in Ethiopia and ongoing data collection to evaluate acceptability and efficacy is ongoing. Surgical education videos on infection prevention topics addressing location-specific resources and workarounds can be useful to hospitals operating in resource-limited settings for training staff and supporting quality and safety efforts in surgery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.sopen.2022.10.005\n\nView details for PubMedID 36466047\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9709099\n\nAbstract\n\nAccurate surveillance of population access to essential surgery is key for strategic healthcare planning. This study aimed to estimate population access to surgical facilities meeting standards for safe surgery equipment, specialized surgical personnel, and bellwether capability, cesarean delivery, emergency laparotomy, and long-bone fracture fixation and to evaluate the validity of using these standards to describe the full breadth of essential surgical care needs in Liberia.An observational study of surgical facilities was conducted in Liberia between 20 September and 8 November 2018. Facility data were combined with geospatial data and analysed in an online visualization platform.Data were collected from 51 of 52 surgical facilities. Nationally, 52.9 per cent of the population (2 392 000 of 4 525 000 people) had 2-h access to their closest surgical facility, whereas 41.1 per cent (1 858 000 people) and 48.6 per cent (2 199 000 people) had 2-h access to a facility meeting the personnel and equipment standards respectively. Six facilities performed all bellwether procedures; 38.7 per cent of the population (1 751 000 people) had 2-h access to one of these facilities. Bellwether-capable facilities were more likely to perform other essential surgical procedures (OR 3.13, 95 per cent c.i. 1.28 to 7.65; P = 0.012). These facilities delivered a median of 13.0 (i.q.r. 11.3-16.5) additional essential procedures.Population access to essential surgery is limited in Liberia; strategies to reduce travel times ought to be part of healthcare policy. Policymakers should also be aware that bellwether capability might not be a valid proxy for the full breadth of essential surgical care in low-income settings.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/bjs/znac377\n\nView details for PubMedID 36469530\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Pulse oximetry monitoring is included in the WHO Safe Surgery Checklist and recognized as an essential perioperative safety monitoring device. However, many low resource countries do not have adequate numbers of pulse oximeters available or healthcare workers trained in their use. Lifebox, a nonprofit organization focused on improving anesthetic and surgical safety, has procured and distributed pulse oximeters and relevant educational training in over 100 countries. We aimed to understand qualitatively how pulse oximetry provision and training affected a group of Zambian non-physician anesthetists' perioperative care and what, if any, capacity gaps remain.METHODS: We identified and approached non-physician anesthetists (NPAPs) in Zambia who attended a 2019 Lifebox pulse oximetry training course to participate in a semi-structured interview. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Codes were iteratively derived; the codebook was tested for inter-rater reliability (pooled kappa>0.70). Team-based thematic analysis identified emergent themes on pulse oximetry training and perioperative patient care.RESULTS: Ten of the 35 attendees were interviewed. Two themes emerged concerning pulse oximetry provision and training in discussion with non-physician anesthetists about their experience after training: (1) Impact on Non-Physician Anesthetists and the Healthcare Team and (2) Impact on Perioperative Patient Monitoring. These broad themes were further explored through subthemes. Increased knowledge brought confidence in monitoring and facilitated quick interventions. NPAPs reported improved preoperative assessments and reaffirmed the necessity of having pulse oximetry intraoperatively. However, lack of device availability led to case delays or cancellations. A portable device travelling with the patient to the recovery ward was noted as a major improvement in postoperative care. Pulse oximeters also improved communication between nurses and NPAPs, giving NPAPs confidence in the recovery process. However, this was not always possible, as lack of pulse oximeters and ward staff unfamiliarity with oximetry was commonly reported. NPAPs expressed that wider pulse oximetry availability and training would be beneficial.CONCLUSION: Among a cohort of non-physician anesthetists in Zambia, the provision of pulse oximeters and training was perceived to improve patient care throughout the perioperative timeline. However, capacity and resource gaps remain in their practice settings, especially during transfers of care. NPAPs identified a number of areas where patient care and safety could be improved, including expanding access to pulse oximetry training and provision to ward and nursing staff to ensure the entire healthcare team is aware of the benefits and importance of its use.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12913-022-08698-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 36419106\n\nAbstract\n\nTiming of tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 has attracted substantial attention. Initial guidelines recommended delaying or avoiding tracheostomy due to the potential for particle aerosolization and theoretical risk to providers. However, early tracheostomy could improve patient outcomes and alleviate resource shortages. This study compares outcomes in a diverse population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy either \"early\" (within 14 d of intubation) or \"late\" (more than 14 d after intubation).International multi-institute retrospective cohort study.Thirteen hospitals in Bolivia, Brazil, Spain, and the United States.Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 undergoing early or late tracheostomy between March 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021.Not applicable.A total of 549 patients from 13 hospitals in four countries were included in the final analysis. Multivariable regression analysis showed that early tracheostomy was associated with a 12-day decrease in time on mechanical ventilation (95% CI, -16 to -8; p < 0.001). Further, ICU and hospital lengths of stay in patients undergoing early tracheostomy were 15 days (95% CI, -23 to -9 d; p < 0.001) and 22 days (95% CI, -31 to -12 d) shorter, respectively. In contrast, early tracheostomy patients experienced lower risk-adjusted survival at 30-day post-admission (hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8-5.2). Differences in 90-day post-admission survival were not identified.COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy within 14 days of intubation have reduced ventilator dependence as well as reduced lengths of stay. However, early tracheostomy patients experienced lower 30-day survival. Future efforts should identify patients most likely to benefit from early tracheostomy while accounting for location-specific capacity.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/CCE.0000000000000796\n\nView details for PubMedID 36440062\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9681622\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: We previously developed and pilot tested Clean Cut, a program to prevent postoperative infections by improving compliance with the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) and strengthening adherence to infection control practices. This protocol describes the CheckList Expansion for Antisepsis and iNfection Control in Cesarean Section (CLEAN-CS) trial evaluating our program's ability to reduce infections following CS and other obstetric and gynecological operations in Ethiopia.METHODS/DESIGN: CLEAN-CS is a cluster-randomized stepped wedge interventional trial with five clusters (two hospitals per cluster). It aims to assess the impact of Clean Cut on six critical perioperative infection prevention standards including antiseptic practices, antibiotic administration, and routine SCC use. The trial involves baseline data collection followed by Clean Cut training and implementation in each cluster in randomized order. The intervention consists of (1) modifying and implementing the SSC to fit local practices, (2) process mapping each standard, (3) coupling data and processes with site-specific action plans for improvement, and (4) targeted training focused on process gaps. The primary outcome is 30-day CS infection rates; secondary outcomes include other patient-level complications and compliance with standards. Assuming baseline SSI incidence of 12%, an effect size of 25% absolute reduction, and the ability to recruit 80-90 patients per cluster per month, we require a sample of 8100 patients for significance. We will report our study according to CONSORT.DISCUSSION: A cluster-randomized stepped wedge design is well-suited for evaluating this type of surgical safety program. The targeted standards are not in doubt, yet compliance is frequently difficult. Solutions are available and may be recognized by individuals, but teams dedicated to improvement are often lacking. Clean Cut was successfully piloted but requires a more rigorous methodological assessment. We seek to understand the qualities, characteristics, and resources needed to implement the program, the magnitude of effect on processes and outcomes, and to what degree it can enhance compliance with care standards. Challenges include a fraught social and political environment, pandemic travel restrictions, and a limited budget.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04812522 (registered on March 23, 2021); Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry PACTR202108717887402 (registered on August 24, 2021).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13063-022-06500-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 35986400\n\nAbstract\n\nMalnutrition is an independent predictor for postoperative complications in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We systematically reviewed evidence on the impact of preoperative oral nutrition supplementation (ONS) on patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery in LMICs. We searched EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, WHO Global Index Medicus, SciELO, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) databases from inception to March 21, 2022 for randomised controlled trials evaluating preoperative ONS in gastrointestinal cancer within LMICs. We evaluated the impact of ONS on all postoperative outcomes using random-effects meta-analysis. Seven studies reported on 891 patients (446 ONS group, 445 control group) undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal cancer. Preoperative ONS reduced all cause postoperative surgical complications (risk ratio (RR) 0.53, 95% CI 0.46-0.60, P<0.001, I2=0%, n=891), infection (0.52, 0.40-0.67, P=0.008, I2=0%, n=570) and all-cause mortality (0.35, 0.26-0.47, P=0.014, I2=0%, n=588). Despite heterogeneous populations and baseline rates, absolute risk ratio (ARR) was reduced for all cause (pooled effect -0.14, -0.22 to -0.06, P=0.006; number needed to treat (NNT) 7) and infectious complications (-0.13, -0.22 to -0.06, P<0.001; NNT 8). Preoperative nutrition in patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery in LMICs demonstrated consistently strong and robust treatment effects across measured outcomes. However additional higher quality research, with particular focus within African populations, are urgently required.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1038/s41598-022-16460-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 35864290\n\nAbstract\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has strained surgical systems worldwide and placed healthcare providers at risk in their workplace. To protect surgical care providers caring for patients with COVID-19, in May 2020 we developed a COVID-19 Surgical Patient Checklist (C19 SPC), including online training materials, to accompany the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist. In October 2020, an online survey was conducted via partner and social media networks to understand perioperative clinicians' intraoperative practice and perceptions of safety while caring for COVID-19 positive patients and gain feedback on the utility of C19 SPC. Descriptive statistics were used to characterise responses by World Bank income classification. Qualitative analysis was performed to describe respondents' perceptions of C19 SPC and recommended modifications. Respondents included 539 perioperative clinicians from 63 countries. One-third of respondents reported feeling unsafe in their workplace due to COVID-19 with significantly higher proportions in low (39.8%) and lower-middle (33.9%) than higher income countries (15.6%). The most cited concern was the risk of COVID-19 transmission to self, colleagues and family. A large proportion of respondents (65.3%) reported that they had not used C19 SPC, yet 83.8% of these respondents felt it would be useful. Of those who reported that they had used C19 SPC, 62.0% stated feeling safer in the workplace because of its use. Based on survey results, modifications were incorporated into a subsequent version. Our survey findings suggest that perioperative clinicians report feeling unsafe at work during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, adjunct tools such as the C19 SPC can help to improve perceived safety.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/0310057X221092455\n\nView details for PubMedID 35765829\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Estimates of the total economic cost of firearm violence are important in drawing attention to this public health issue; however, studies that consider violence more broadly are needed to further the understanding of the extent to which such costs can be avoided.Objectives: To estimate the association of firearm assaults with US hospital costs and deaths compared with other assault types.Design, Setting, and Participants: The 2016-2018 US Nationwide Emergency Department Sample and National Inpatient Sample, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project were used in this cross-sectional study of emergency department (ED) and inpatient admissions for assaults involving a firearm, sharp object, blunt object, or bodily force identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Differences in ED and inpatient costs (2020 US dollars) across mechanisms were estimated using ordinary least-squares regression with and without adjustments for year and hospital, patient, and injury characteristics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention underlying cause of death data were used to estimate national death rates and hospital case-fatality rates across mechanisms. Cost analysis used a weighted sample. National death rates and hospital case-fatality rates used US resident death certificates, covering 976 million person-years. Hospital case-fatality rates also used nationally weighted ED records covering 2.7 million admissions. Data analysis was conducted from March 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022.Exposure: The primary exposure was the mechanism used in the assault.Main Outcomes and Measures: Emergency department and inpatient costs per record. National death rates and hospital case-fatality rates.Results: Overall, 2.4 million ED visits and 184 040 inpatient admissions for assault were included. Across all mechanisms, the mean age of the population was 32.7 (95% CI, 32.6-32.9) years in the ED and 36.4 (95% CI, 36.2-36.7) years in the inpatient setting; 41.9% (95% CI, 41.2%-42.5%) were female in the ED, and 19.1% (95% CI, 18.6%-19.6%) of inpatients were female. Most assaults recorded in the ED involved publicly insured or uninsured patients and hospitals in the Southern US. Emergency department costs were $678 (95% CI, $657-$699) for bodily force, $861 (95% CI, $813-$910) for blunt object, $996 (95% CI, $925-$1067) for sharp object, and $1388 (95% CI, $1254-$1522) for firearm assaults. Corresponding inpatient costs were $14 702 (95% CI, $14 178-$15 227) for bodily force, $17 906 (95% CI, $16 888-$18 923) for blunt object, $19 265 (95% CI, $18 475-$20 055) for sharp object, and $34 949 (95% CI, $33 654-$36 244) for firearm assaults. National death rates per 100 000 were 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03-0.04) for bodily force, 0.03 (95% CI, 0.03-0.03) for blunt object, 0.54 (95% CI, 0.52-0.55) for sharp object, and 4.40 (95% CI, 4.36-4.44) for firearm assaults. Hospital case fatality rates were 0.01% (95% CI, 0.009%-0.012%) for bodily force, 0.05% (95% CI, 0.04%-0.06%) for blunt object, 1.05% (95% CI, 1.00%-1.09%) for sharp object, and 15.26% (95% CI, 15.04%-15.49%) for firearm assaults. In regression analysis, ED costs for firearm assaults were 59% to 99% higher than costs for nonfirearm assaults, and inpatient costs were 67% to 118% higher.Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that it may be useful for policies aimed at reducing the costs of firearm violence to consider violence more broadly to understand the extent to which costs can be avoided.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.18496\n\nView details for PubMedID 35749116\n\nAbstract\n\nFirearm injuries are a costly, national public health emergency, and government-sponsored programs frequently pay these hospital costs. Understanding regional differences in firearm injury burden may be useful for crafting appropriate policies, especially with widely varying state gun laws.To estimate the volume of, and hospital costs for, fatal and non-fatal firearm injuries from 2005 to 2015 for each region of the United States and analyze the proportionate cost by payer status.We used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify patients admitted for firearm-related injuries from 2005 to 2015. We converted hospitalization charges to costs, which were inflation-adjusted to 2015 dollars. We used survey weights to create regional estimates. We used the Brady Gun Law to determine significance between firearm restrictiveness and firearm hospitalizations by region.There were a total of 317 479 firearm related admissions over the study period: 52 829 (16.66%), 66 671 (21.0%), 134 008 (42.2%), and 63 972 (20.2%) for the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West respectively, demonstrating high regional variability. In the Northeast, hospital costs were $1.98 billion (13.9% of total), of which 56.0% was covered by government payers; for the Midwest, costs were $153 billion (19.7% of total), 40.4% of which was covered by government payers; in the South costs were highest at $3.2 billion (41.4% of total), but government payers only covered 34.3%; and costs for the West were $1.94 billion (25.0% of total), with government programs covering 41.6% of the cost burden.Hospital admissions and costs for firearm injuries demonstrated wide variation by region, suggesting opportunities for financial savings. As government insurance programs cover 41.5% of costs, tax dollars heavily subsidize the financial burden of firearm injuries and cost recovery options for treating residents injured by firearms should be considered. Injury control strategies have not been well applied to this national public health crisis.Level II, Economic and Value Based Evaluation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/tsaco-2021-000854\n\nView details for PubMedID 35497324\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8995943\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article summarizes the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, on an international project to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The research leadership and process, the access to data, and stakeholders were deeply disrupted by the national and international response to the pandemic, including the interruption of healthcare delivery, lockdowns, and quarantines. The key principles to deliver the research through the pandemic were mainly the high degree of interdisciplinary engagement with integrated teams, and equitable partnership across sites with capacity building and leadership training. The level of preexisting collaboration and partnership were also keys to sustaining connections and involvements throughout the pandemic. The pandemic offered opportunities for realigning research priorities. Flexibility in funding timelines and projects inputs are required to accommodate variance introduced by external factors. The current models for research collaboration and funding need to be critically evaluated and redesigned to retain the innovation that was shown to be successful through this pandemic.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ijid.2022.02.013\n\nView details for PubMedID 35150912\n\nAbstract\n\nPreoperative undernutrition is a prognostic indicator for postoperative mortality and morbidity. Evidence suggests that treating undernutrition can improve surgical outcomes. This study explored the provision of nutritional screening, assessment and support on surgical cancer wards in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This was a qualitative study and participants took part in one focus group or one individual interview. Data were analysed thematically. There were 34 participants from Ghana, India, the Philippines and Zambia: 24 healthcare professionals (HCPs) and 10 patients. Results showed that knowledge levels and enthusiasm were high in HCPs. Barriers to adequate nutritional support were a lack of provision of ward and kitchen equipment, food and sustainable nutritional supplements. There was variation across countries towards nutritional screening and assessment which seemed to be driven by resources. Many hospitals where resources were scarce focused on the care of individual patients in favour of an integrated systems approach to identify and manage undernutrition. In conclusion, there is scope to improve the efficiency of nutritional management of surgical cancer patients in LMICs through the integration of nutrition assessment and support into routine hospital policies and procedures, moving from case management undertaken by interested personnel to a system-based approach including the whole multidisciplinary team.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/nu14040863\n\nView details for PubMedID 35215513\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Proper sterilization of surgical instruments is essential for safe surgery, yet re-processing methods in low-resource settings can fall short of standards. Training of Trainers (TOT) workshops in Ethiopia and El Salvador instructed participants in sterile processing concepts and prepared participants to teach others. This study examines participants' knowledge and confidence post-TOT workshop, and moreover discusses subsequent non-TOT workshops and observed sterile processing practices. Methods: Five TOT workshops were conducted between 2018 and 2020 in Ethiopia and Central America. Participant trainers then led nine non-TOT workshops in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Interactive sessions covered instrument cleaning, packaging, disinfection, sterilization, and transportation. Participants completed pre- and post-tests, demonstrated skill competencies, and shared feedback. Peri-operative sterile processing metrics were also observed in Ethiopian hospitals pre- and post-workshops. Results: Ninety-five trainees participated in TOT workshops, whereas 169 participated in non-TOT workshops. Knowledge on a 10-point scale increased substantially after all training sessions (+2.3±2.8, +2.9±1.7, and 2.7±2.5 after Ethiopian, Central American, and non-TOT workshops, respectively; all p<0.05). Scores on tests of sterile processing theory also increased (Ethiopian TOT, +68%±92%; Central American TOT, +26%±20%; p<0.01). Most respondents felt \"very confident\" about teaching (Ethiopian TOT, 72%; Central American TOT, 83%; non-TOT, 70%), whereas fewer participants felt \"very confident\" enacting change (Ethiopian TOT, 36%; Central American TOT, 58%; non-TOT, 38%). Reasons included resource scarcity and inadequate support. Nonetheless, observed instrument compliance improved after Ethiopian TOT workshops (odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-1.78; p<0.01). Conclusions: Sterile processing workshops can improve knowledge, confidence, and sterility compliance in selected low- and middle-income countries. Training of Trainers models empower participants to adapt programs locally, enhancing sterile processing knowledge in different communities. However, national guidelines, physical and administrative resources, and long-term follow-up must improve to ensure effective sterile processing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1089/sur.2021.187\n\nView details for PubMedID 35076317\n\nAbstract\n\nThe operating room (OR) is one of the most expensive areas of a hospital, requiring large capital and recurring investments, and necessitating efficient throughput to reduce costs per patient encounter. On top of increasing costs, inefficient utilization of operating rooms results in prolonged waiting lists, high rate of cancellation, frustration of OR personnel as well as increased anxiety that negatively impacts the health of patients. This problem is magnified in developing countries, where there is a high unmet surgical need. However, no system currently exists to assess operating room utilization in Ethiopia.A prospective study was conducted over a period of 3 months (May 1 to July 31, 2019) in a tertiary hospital. Surgical case start time, end time, room turnover time, cancellations and reason for cancellation were observed to evaluate the efficiency of eight operating rooms.A total of 933 elective procedures were observed during the study period. Of these, 246 were cancelled, yielding a cancellation rate of 35.8%. The most common reasons for cancellation were related to lack of OR time and patient preparation (8.7% and 7.7% respectively). Shortage of facilities (instrument, blood, ICU bed) were causes of cancelation in 7.7%. Start time was delayed in 93.4% (mean 8:56 am ± 52 min) of cases. Last case completion time was early in 47.9% and delayed in 20.6% (mean 2:54 pm ± 156 min). Turnover time was prolonged in 34.5% (mean 25 min ± 49 min). Total operating room utilization ranged from 10.5% to 174%. Operating rooms were underutilized in 42.7% while overutilization was found in 14.6%.We found a high cancellation rate, most attributable to late start times leading to delays for the remainder of cases, and lack of preoperative patient preparation. In a setting with a high unmet burden of surgical disease, OR efficiency must be maximized with improved patient evaluation workflows, adequate OR staffing and commitment to punctual start times. We recommend future quality improvement projects focusing on these areas to increase OR efficiency.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s13037-021-00314-5\n\nView details for PubMedID 34996487\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: While primary data on the unmet need for surgery in low- and middle-income countries is lacking, household surveys could provide an entry point to collect such data. We describe the first development and inclusion of questions on surgery in a nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Zambia.METHOD: Questions regarding surgical conditions were developed through an iterative consultative process and integrated into the rollout of the DHS survey in Zambia in 2018 and administered to a nationwide sample survey of eligible women aged 15-49 years and men aged 15-59 years.RESULTS: In total, 7 questions covering 4 themes of service delivery, diagnosed burden of surgical disease, access to care, and quality of care were added. The questions were administered across 12,831 households (13,683 women aged 15-49 years and 12,132 men aged 15-59 years). Results showed that approximately 5% of women and 2% of men had undergone an operation in the past 5 years. Among women, cesarean delivery was the most common surgery; circumcision was the most common procedure among men. In the past 5 years, an estimated 0.61% of the population had been told by a health care worker that they might need surgery, and of this group, 35% had undergone the relevant procedure.CONCLUSION: For the first time, questions on surgery have been included in a nationwide DHS. We have shown that it is feasible to integrate these questions into a large-scale survey to provide insight into surgical needs at a national level. Based on the DHS design and implementation mechanisms, a country interested in including a set of questions like the one included in Zambia, could replicate this data collection in other settings, which provides an opportunity for systematic collection of comparable surgical data, a vital role in surgical health care system strengthening.\n\nView details for DOI 10.9745/GHSP-D-20-00619\n\nView details for PubMedID 34933985\n\nAbstract\n\nAny health care system that strives to deliver good health and well-being to its population relies on a trained workforce. The aim of this study was to enumerate surgical provider density, describe operative productivity and assess the association between key surgical system characteristics and surgical provider productivity in Liberia.A nationwide survey of operation theatre logbooks, available human resources and facility infrastructure was conducted in 2018. Surgical providers were counted, and their productivity was calculated based on operative numbers and full-time equivalent positions.A total of 286 surgical providers were counted, of whom 67 were accredited specialists. This translated into a national density of 1.6 specialist providers per 100,000 population. Non-specialist physicians performed 58.3 percent (3607 of 6188) of all operations. Overall, surgical providers performed a median of 1.0 (IQR 0.5-2.7) operation per week, and there were large disparities in operative productivity within the workforce. Most operations (5483 of 6188) were categorized as essential, and each surgical provider performed a median of 2.0 (IQR 1.0-5.0) different types of essential procedures. Surgical providers who performed 7-14 different types of essential procedures were more than eight times as productive as providers who performed 0-1 essential procedure (operative productivity ratio = 8.66, 95% CI 6.27-11.97, P < 0.001).The Liberian health care system struggles with an alarming combination of few surgical providers and low provider productivity. Disaggregated data can provide a high-resolution picture of local challenges that can lead to local solutions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00268-021-06379-8\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000722959500001\n\nView details for PubMedID 34839375\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC8803679\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: We aimed to search the literature for global surgical curricula, assess if published resources align with existing competency frameworks in global health and surgical education, and determine if there is consensus around a fundamental set of competencies for the developing field of academic global surgery.METHODS: We reviewed SciVerse SCOPUS, PubMed, African Medicus Index, African Journals Online (AJOL), SciELO, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and Bioline for manuscripts on global surgery curricula and evaluated the results using existing competency frameworks in global health and surgical education from Consortium of the Universities for Global Health (CUGH) and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) professional competencies.RESULTS: Our search generated 250 publications, of which 18 were eligible: (1) a total of 10 reported existing competency-based curricula that were concurrent with international experiences, (2) two reported existing pre-departure competency-based curricula, (3) six proposed theoretical competency-based curricula for future global surgery education. All, but one, were based in high-income countries (HICs) and focused on the needs of HIC trainees. None met all 17 competencies, none cited the CUGH competency on \"Health Equity and Social Justice\" and only one mentioned \"Social and Environmental Determinants of Health.\" Only 22% (n=4) were available as open-access.CONCLUSION: Currently, there is no universally accepted set of competencies on the fundamentals of academic global surgery. Existing literature are predominantly by and for HIC institutions and trainees. Current frameworks are inadequate for this emerging academic field. The field needs competencies with explicit input from LMIC experts to ensure creation of educational resources that are accessible and relevant to trainees from around the world.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2021.03.061\n\nView details for PubMedID 34905823\n\nAbstract\n\nWe aimed to define a globally applicable list of surgical procedures, or \"basket,\" which could represent a health system's capacity to provide surgical care and standardize global surgical measurement.Six indicators have been proposed to assess access to safe, affordable, timely surgical and anesthesia care, with a focus on laparotomy, cesarean section, and treatment of open fracture. However, comparability, particularly for these procedures, has been limited by a lack of definitional clarity and their overly broad scope.We conducted a 3 round international expert Delphi exercise between April and June 2019 using REDCap to identify a set of procedures representative of surgical capacity. To be included, procedures had to be important for treating common conditions, well-defined, and impactful (ie, well-recognized clinical or functional benefit). Procedures were eliminated or prioritized in each round, and those noted as \"extremely\" or \"very important\" by ≥50% of respondents in round 3 were included in the final \"basket.\"Altogether 331 respondents from 78 countries participated in the Delphi process. A final basket of 32 procedures representing disease categories in trauma, cancer, congenital anomalies, maternal/reproductive health, aging, and infection were identified for inclusion to assess surgical capacity.This surgical basket facilitates a more standardized assessment of a country's surgical system. Further testing and refinement will likely be needed, but this basket can be used immediately to guide ongoing monitoring and evaluation of global surgery capacities to improve and strengthen surgery and anesthesia care.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/SLA.0000000000004611\n\nView details for PubMedID 33214454\n\nAbstract\n\nIndicators to evaluate progress towards timely access to safe surgical, anaesthesia, and obstetric (SAO) care were proposed in 2015 by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery. These aimed to capture access to surgery, surgical workforce, surgical volume, perioperative mortality rate, and catastrophic and impoverishing financial consequences of surgery. Despite being rapidly taken up by practitioners, data points from which to derive the indicators were not defined, limiting comparability across time or settings. We convened global experts to evaluate and explicitly define-for the first time-the indicators to improve comparability and support achievement of 2030 goals to improve access to safe affordable surgical and anaesthesia care globally.The Utstein process for developing and reporting guidelines through a consensus building process was followed. In-person discussions at a 2-day meeting were followed by an iterative process conducted by email and virtual group meetings until consensus was reached. The meeting was held between June 16 to 18, 2019; discussions continued until August 2020. Participants consisted of experts in surgery, anaesthesia, and obstetric care, data science, and health indicators from high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Considering each of the 6 indicators in turn, we refined overarching descriptions and agreed upon data points needed for construction of each indicator at current time (basic data points), and as each evolves over 2 to 5 (intermediate) and >5 year (full) time frames. We removed one of the original 6 indicators (one of 2 financial risk protection indicators was eliminated) and refined descriptions and defined data points required to construct the 5 remaining indicators: geospatial access, workforce, surgical volume, perioperative mortality, and catastrophic expenditure. A strength of the process was the number of people from global institutes and multilateral agencies involved in the collection and reporting of global health metrics; a limitation was the limited number of participants from low- or middle-income countries-who only made up 21% of the total attendees.To track global progress towards timely access to quality SAO care, these indicators-at the basic level-should be implemented universally as soon as possible. Intermediate and full indicator sets should be achieved by all countries over time. Meanwhile, these evolutions can assist in the short term in developing national surgical plans and collecting more detailed data for research studies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003749\n\nView details for PubMedID 34415914\n\nAbstract\n\nAs surgical systems are forced to adapt and respond to new challenges, so should the patient safety tools within those systems. We sought to determine how the WHO SSC might best be adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic.18 Panelists from five continents and multiple clinical specialties participated in a three-round modified Delphi technique to identify potential recommendations, assess agreement with proposed recommendations and address items not meeting consensus.From an initial 29 recommendations identified in the first round, 12 were identified for inclusion in the second round. After discussion of recommendations without consensus for inclusion or exclusion, four additional recommendations were added for an eventual 16 recommendations. Nine of these recommendations were related to checklist content, while seven recommendations were related to implementation.This multinational panel has identified 16 recommendations for sites looking to use the surgical safety checklist during the COVID-19 pandemic. These recommendations provide an example of how the SSC can adapt to meet urgent and emerging needs of surgical systems by targeting important processes and encouraging critical discussions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00268-021-06000-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 33638023\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients hospitalized with COVID-19 are at risk of developing hypoxic respiratory failure and often require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Indication and timing to perform tracheostomy is controversial in patients with COVID-19.This was a single-institution retrospective review of tracheostomies performed on patients admitted for COVID-19 between April 8, 2020 and August 1, 2020 using a modified percutaneous tracheostomy technique to minimize hypoxia and aerosolization.Twelve tracheostomies were performed for COVID-related respiratory failure. Median patient age was 54 years (range: 36-76) and 9 (75%) were male. Median time to tracheostomy was 17 days (range: 10-27), and 5 (42%) patients had failed attempts at extubation prior to tracheostomy. There were no intraprocedural complications, including hypoxia. Post-tracheostomy bleeding was noted in two patients. Eight (67%) patients have been discharged at the time of this study, and there were four patient deaths unrelated to tracheostomy placement. No healthcare worker transmissions resulted from participating in the tracheostomy procedure.A modified percutaneous tracheostomy is feasible and can be safely performed in patients infected with COVID-19.Level V, case series.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/tsaco-2020-000625\n\nView details for PubMedID 34192161\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7736959\n\nAbstract\n\nPoor surgical lighting represents a major patient safety issue in low-income countries. This study evaluated device performance and undertook field assessment of high-quality headlights in Ethiopia to identify critical attributes that might improve safety and encourage local use.Following an open call for submissions (December 2018 to January 2019), medical and technical (non-medical) headlights were identified for controlled specification testing on 14 prespecified parameters related to light quality/intensity, mounting and battery performance, including standardized illuminance measurements over time. The five highest-performing devices (differential illumination, colour rendering, spot size, mounting and battery duration) were distributed to eight Ethiopian surgeons working in resource-constrained facilities. Surgeons evaluated the devices in operating rooms, and in a comparative session rated each headlight in terms of performance and willingness to purchase.Of 25 submissions, eight headlights (6 surgical and 2 technical) met the criteria for full specification testing. Scores ranged from 8 to 12 (of 14), with differential performance in lighting, mounting and battery domains. Only two headlights met the illuminance parameters of more than 35 000 lux during initial testing, and no headlight satisfied all minimum specifications. Of the five headlights evaluated in Ethiopia, daily operation logbooks noted variability in surgeons' opinions of lighting quality (6-92 per cent) and spot size (0-92 per cent). Qualitative interviews also yielded important feedback, including preference for easy transport. Surgeons sought high quality with price sensitivity (using out-of-pocket funds) and identified the least expensive but high-functioning device as their first choice.No device satisfied all the predetermined specifications, and large price discrepancies were critical factors leading surgeons' choices. The favoured device is undergoing modification by the manufacturer based on design feedback so an affordable, high-quality surgical headlight crafted specifically for the needs of resource-constrained settings can be used to improve surgical safety.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/bjs.11756\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7938832\n\nAbstract\n\nClean Cut is an adaptive, multimodal programme to identify improvement opportunities and safety changes in surgery by enhancing outcomes surveillance, closing gaps in surgical infection prevention standards, and strengthening underlying processes of care. Surgical-site infections (SSIs) are common in low-income countries, so this study assessed a simple intervention to improve perioperative infection prevention practices in one.Clean Cut was implemented in five hospitals in Ethiopia from August 2016 to October 2018. Compliance data were collected from the operating room focused on six key perioperative infection prevention standards. Process-mapping exercises were employed to understand barriers to compliance and identify locally driven improvement opportunities. Thirty-day outcomes were recorded on patients for whom intraoperative compliance information had been collected.Compliance data were collected from 2213 operations (374 at baseline and 1839 following process improvements) in 2202 patients. Follow-up was completed in 2159 patients (98·0 per cent). At baseline, perioperative teams complied with a mean of only 2·9 of the six critical perioperative infection prevention standards; following process improvement changes, compliance rose to a mean of 4·5 (P < 0·001). The relative risk of surgical infections after Clean Cut implementation was 0·65 (95 per cent c.i. 0·43 to 0·99; P = 0·043). Improved compliance with standards reduced the risk of postoperative infection by 46 per cent (relative risk 0·54, 95 per cent c.i. 0·30 to 0·97, for adherence score 3-6 versus 0-2; P = 0·038).The Clean Cut programme improved infection prevention standards to reduce SSI without infrastructure expenses or resource investments.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/bjs.11997\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000571340200001\n\nView details for PubMedID 34157086\n\nAbstract\n\nEssential surgical procedures rank among the most cost-effective of all healthcare interventions. The aim of this study was to enumerate surgical volumes in Liberia, quantify surgical infrastructure, personnel and availability of essential surgical procedures, describe surgical facilities, and assess the influence of human resources and infrastructure on surgical volumes.An observational countrywide survey was done in Liberia between 20 September and 8 November 2018. All healthcare facilities performing surgical procedures requiring general, regional or local anaesthesia in an operating theatre between September 2017 and August 2018 were eligible for inclusion. Information on facility infrastructure and human resources was collected by interviewing key personnel. Data on surgical volumes were extracted from operating theatre log books.Of 70 healthcare facilities initially identified as possible surgical facilities, 52 confirmed operative capacity and were eligible for inclusion; all but one shared surgical data. A national surgical volume of 462 operations per 100 000 population was estimated. The median hospital offered nine of 26 essential surgical procedures. Unequal distributions of surgical infrastructure, personnel, and essential surgical procedures were identified between facilities. In multivariable regression analysis, surgical human resources (β = 0·60, 95 per cent c.i. 0·34 to 0·87; P < 0·001) and infrastructure (β = 0·03, 0·02 to 0·04; P < 0·001) were found to be strongly associated with operative volumes.The availability of essential surgical procedures in Liberia is extremely low. Descriptive tools can quantify inequalities, guide resource allocation, and highlight rational investment areas.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/bjs5.50349\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000572340400001\n\nView details for PubMedID 32949120\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7709357\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) has been shown to reduce perioperative complications across global health systems. We sought to assess perceptions of the SSC and suggestions for its improvement among medical students, trainees, and early career providers.METHODS: From July to September 2019, a survey assessing perceptions of the SSC was disseminated through InciSioN, the International Student Surgical Network comprising medical students, trainees, and early career providers pursuing surgery. Individuals with ≥2years of independent practice after training were excluded. Respondents were categorized according to any clinical versus solely non-clinical SSC exposure. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between clinical/non-clinical exposure and promoting future use of the SSC, adjusting for potential confounders/mediators: training level, human development index, and first perceptions of the SSC. Thematic analysis was conducted on suggestions for SSC improvement.RESULTS: Respondent participation rate was 24%. Three hundred and eighteen respondents were included in final analyses; 215 (67%) reported clinical exposure and 190 (60%) were promoters of future SSC use. Clinical exposure was associated with greater odds of promoting future SSC use (aOR 1.81 95% CI [1.03-3.19], p=0.039). A greater proportion of promoters reported \"Improved Operating Room Communication\" as a goal of the SSC (0.21 95% CI [0.15-0.27]-vs.-0.12 [0.06-0.17], p=0.031), while non-promoters reported the SSC goals were \"Not Well Understood\" (0.08 95% CI [0.03-0.12]-vs.-0.03 [0.01-0.05], p=0.032). Suggestions for SSC improvement emphasized context-specific adaptability and earlier formal training.CONCLUSIONS: Clinical exposure to the SSC was associated with promoting its future use. Earlier formal clinical training may improve perceptions and future use among medical students, trainees, and early career providers.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s00268-020-05518-x\n\nView details for PubMedID 32307554\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Surgical site infections (SSIs) represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia. Lack of post-discharge follow-up, including identification of SSIs, is a barrier to continued patient care, often because of financial and travel constraints. As part of a surgical quality improvement initiative, we aimed to assess patient outcomes at 30 days post-operative with a telephone call. Patients and Methods: We conducted mobile telephone follow-up as part of Lifebox's ongoing Clean Cut program, which aims to improve compliance with intra-operative infection prevention standards. One urban tertiary referral hospital and one rural district general hospital in Ethiopia were included in this phase of the study; hospital nursing staff called patients at 30 days post-operative inquiring about signs of SSIs, health-care-seeking behavior, and treatments provided if patients had any healthcare encounters since discharge. Results: A total of 701 patients were included; overall 77% of patients were reached by telephone call after discharge. The rural study site reached 362 patients (87%) by telephone; the urban site reached 176 patients (62%) (p<0.001). Of the 39 SSIs identified, 19 (49%) were captured as outpatient during the telephone follow-up (p<0.001); 22 (34%) of all complications were captured following discharge (p<0.001). Telephone follow-up improved from 65%-78% in the first half of project implementation to 77%-89% in the second half of project implementation. Conclusion: Telephone follow-up after surgery in Ethiopia is feasible and valuable, and identified nearly half of all SSIs and one-third of total complications in our cohort. Follow-up improved over the course of the program, likely indicating a learning curve that, once overcome, is a more accurate marker of its practicability. Given the increasing use of mobile telephones in Ethiopia and ease of implementation, this model could be practical in other low-resource surgical settings.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1089/sur.2020.054\n\nView details for PubMedID 32301651\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Health Insurance Marketplaces (\"Marketplaces\") and financial protection for patients undergoing surgery.BACKGROUND: The ACA established Marketplaces through which individuals could purchase subsidized insurance coverage. However, the effect of these Marketplaces on surgical patients' healthcare spending remains largely unknown.METHODS: We analyzed a nationally representative sample of adults aged 19-64 who underwent surgery in 2010-2017, using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Low-income patients eligible for cost-sharing and premium subsidies in the Marketplaces [income 139%-250% federal poverty level (FPL)] and middle-income patients eligible only for premium subsidies (251%-400% FPL) were compared to high-income controls ineligible for subsidies (>400% FPL) using a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences approach. We evaluated 3 main outcomes: (1) out-of-pocket spending, (2) premium contributions, and (3) likelihood of experiencing catastrophic expenditures, defined as out-of-pocket plus premium spending exceeding 19.5% of family income.RESULTS: Our sample included 5450 patients undergoing surgery, representing approximately 69 million US adults. Among low-income patients, Marketplace implementation was associated with $601 lower [95% confidence interval (CI): -$1169 to -$33; P = 0.04) out-of-pocket spending; $968 lower (95% CI: -$1652 to -$285; P = 0.006) premium spending; and 34.6% lower probability (absolute change: -8.3 percentage points; 95% CI: -14.9 to -1.7; P = 0.01) of catastrophic expenditures. We found no evidence that health expenditures changed for middle-income surgical patients.CONCLUSIONS: The ACA's insurance Marketplaces were associated with improved financial protection among low-income surgical patients eligible for both cost-sharing and premium subsidies, but not in middle-income patients eligible for only premium subsidies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/SLA.0000000000003823\n\nView details for PubMedID 32221119\n\nAbstract\n\nOur objective was to assess the safety of foregoing surgery in patients without abdominopelvic surgery history presenting with small bowel obstruction (SBO). Classic dogma has counseled early surgical intervention for small bowel obstruction (SBO) in the virgin abdomen - patients without abdominopelvic surgery history - given their presumed higher risk of malignant or potentially catastrophic etiologies compared to those who underwent prior abdominal operations. The term virgin abdomen was coined before widespread use of computed tomography, which now elucidates many SBO etiologies. Despite recent efforts to re-evaluate clinical management standards, the prevalence of SBO etiologies in the virgin abdomen and the current management landscape (non-operative vs operative) in these patients remain unclear. Our random-effects meta-analysis of six studies including 442 patients found the prevalence of malignant etiologies in patients without abdominopelvic surgery history presenting with SBO varied from 7.7% [95% CI:3.0-14.1] to 13.4% [95% CI:7.6-20.3] on sensitivity analysis. Most malignant etiologies were not suspected prior to surgery. De novo adhesions (54%) were the most common etiology. Over half of patients underwent a trial of non-operative management, which often failed. Subgroups of patients likely have variable risk profiles for underlying malignant etiologies, yet no study had consistent follow-up data and we did not find convincing evidence that foregoing operative management altogether in this population can be generally recommended.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.06.010\n\nView details for PubMedID 32574687\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) is a patient safety tool shown to reduce mortality and to improve teamwork and adherence with perioperative safety practices. The results of the original pilot work were published 10 years ago. This study aimed to determine the contemporary prevalence and predictors of SSC use globally.Pooled data from the GlobalSurg and Surgical Outcomes studies were analysed to describe SSC use in 2014-2016. The primary exposure was the Human Development Index (HDI) of the reporting country, and the primary outcome was reported SSC use. A generalized estimating equation, clustering by facility, was used to determine differences in SSC use by patient, facility and national characteristics.A total of 85 957 patients from 1464 facilities in 94 countries were included. On average, facilities used the SSC in 75·4 per cent of operations. Compared with very high HDI, SSC use was less in low HDI countries (odds ratio (OR) 0·08, 95 per cent c.i. 0·05 to 0·12). The SSC was used less in urgent compared with elective operations in low HDI countries (OR 0·68, 0·53 to 0·86), but used equally for urgent and elective operations in very high HDI countries (OR 0·96, 0·87 to 1·06). SSC use was lower for obstetrics and gynaecology versus abdominal surgery (OR 0·91, 0·85 to 0·98) and where the common or official language was not one of the WHO official languages (OR 0·30, 0·23 to 0·39).Worldwide, SSC use is generally high, but significant variability exists. Implementation and dissemination strategies must be developed to address this variability.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/bjs.11321\n\nView details for PubMedID 31903586\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: As the number of patients surviving traumatic injuries has grown, understanding the factors that shape the recovery process has become increasingly important. However, the psychosocial factors affecting recovery from trauma have received limited attention. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study to better understand how patients view recovery after traumatic injury.Methods: This qualitative, descriptive study was conducted at a Level One university trauma center. Participants 1-3years postinjury were purposefully sampled to include common blunt-force mechanisms of injuries and a range of ages, socioeconomic backgrounds and injury severities. Semi-structured interviews explored participants' perceptions of self and the recovery process after traumatic injury. Interviews were transcribed verbatim; the data were inductively coded and thematically analyzed.Results: We conducted 15 interviews, 13 of which were with male participants (87%); average hospital length of stay was 8.9 days and mean injury severity score was 18.3. An essential aspect of the patient experience centered around the recovery of both the body and the 'self', a composite of one's roles, values, identities and beliefs. The process of regaining a sound sense of self was essential to achieving favorable subjective outcomes. Participants expressed varying levels of engagement in their recovery process, with those on the high end of the engagement spectrum tending to speak more positively about their outcomes. Participants described their own subjective interpretations of their recovery as most important, which was primarily influenced by their engagement in the recovery process and ability to recover their sense of self.Discussion: Patients who are able to maintain or regain a cohesive sense of self after injury and who are highly engaged in the recovery process have more positive assessments of their outcomes. Our findings offer a novel framework for healthcare providers and researchers to use as they approach the issue of recovery after injury with patients.Level of evidence: III-descriptive, exploratory study.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/tsaco-2019-000427\n\nView details for PubMedID 32154383\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance programs are strongly recommended as a core component of effective national infection prevention and control (IPC) programs. Participation in national SSI surveillance (nSSIS) programs has been shown to decrease reported SSIs among high-income countries (HICs), and it is expected that the same is possible among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We sought to determine what, if any nSSIS programs exist among LMICs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was performed to evaluate existence of nSSIS of World Bank-defined LMICs. A digital survey assessment for presence of national IPC and nSSIS programs was delivered to persons capable of identifying the presence of such a program. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this study. Results: Of the 137 countries identified, 55 (40%) were upper middle income (UMI), 47 (34%) were lower middle income (LMI), and 34 (25%) were low income. Representatives from 39 (28%) LMICs completed the survey. Of these respondent countries, 13 (33%) reported the presence of a national IPC program. There was no difference between countries with IPC programs and those without with respect to country income designation, population size, World Health Organization region, or conflict status. Only five (13% of all respondents) reported presence of a nSSIS program. Conclusions: National surgical site infection surveillance programs are an integral component of a country's ability to provide safe surgical procedures. Presence of nSSIS was reported infrequently in LMICs. International governing bodies should be encouraged to guide LMIC leadership in establishing a nSSIS infrastructure that will help enable safe surgical procedures.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1089/sur.2020.053\n\nView details for PubMedID 32397833\n\nAbstract\n\nTrauma is an expensive and unpredictable source of out-of-pocket spending for American families. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) sought to improve financial protection by expanding health insurance coverage, but its association with health care spending for patients with traumatic injury remains largely unknown.To evaluate the association of ACA implementation with out-of-pocket spending, premiums, and catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) among adult patients with traumatic injury.Data from a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 19 to 64 years who had a hospital stay or emergency department visit for a traumatic injury from January 2010 to December 2017 were analyzed using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Multivariable generalized linear models were used to evaluate changes in spending after ACA implementation. Additionally, 4 income subgroups were evaluated based on ACA thresholds for program eligibility: lowest-income patients (earning 138% or less of the federal poverty level [FPL]), low-income patients (earning 139% to 250% of the FPL), middle-income patients (earning 251% to 400% of the FPL), and high-income patients (earning more than 400% of the FPL). Data were analyzed from February to December 2019.Implementation of the ACA, beginning January 1, 2014.Out-of-pocket spending, premium spending, out-of-pocket plus premium spending, and likelihood of experiencing CHE, defined as out-of-pocket plus premium spending exceeding 19.5% of family income.Of the 6288 included patients, 2995 (weighted percentage, 51.3%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 41.4 (12.8) years. Implementation of the ACA was associated with 31% lower odds of CHE (adjusted odds ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.87; P = .002). Changes were greatest in lowest-income patients, who experienced 30% lower out-of-pocket spending (adjusted percentage change, -30.4%; 95% CI, -46.6% to -9.4%; P = .01), 26% lower out-of-pocket plus premium spending (adjusted percentage change, -26.3%; 95% CI, -41.0% to -8.1%; P = .01), and 39% lower odds of CHE (adjusted odds ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.84; P = .002). Low-income patients experienced decreased out-of-pocket spending and out-of-pocket plus premium spending but no changes in CHE, while middle-income and high-income patients experienced no significant changes in any spending outcome. In the post-ACA period, 1 in 11 of all patients with traumatic injury and 1 in 5 with the lowest incomes continued to experience CHE each year.Implementation of the ACA was associated with improved financial protection for US adults with traumatic injury, especially lowest-income individuals targeted by the law's Medicaid expansions. Despite these gains, injured patients remain at risk of financial strain.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.0157\n\nView details for PubMedID 32108892\n\nAbstract\n\nAssess whether facial trauma wound care and antibiotic use recommendations are guided by evidence-based practice (EBP) or practice patterns, and investigate strategies to improve EBP adoption among surgical trainees.We conducted a survey of all trainees who manage facial trauma (general surgery, emergency medicine, plastic surgery, otolaryngology) to assess clinical knowledge and sources of treatment recommendations. Clinical questions were based on Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Level 1 or 2 evidence. We measured internal validity of questions using Cronbach's α. Results were weight-adjusted for nonresponse and then analyzed using Welch t test and descriptive statistics.Stanford Hospital and Clinics, a Level I trauma center.Response rate was 50.3% overall (78/155). For recommendations on facial trauma wound and antibiotic use, nonspecialty junior residents most frequently relied on their own senior or specialty residents (79.1%); nonspecialty senior residents relied on specialty residents (67.9%). Specialty junior residents most often relied on their own senior residents (51.0%), the majority of whom made recommendations based on their own knowledge (73.2%). Questions assessing EBP knowledge had Cronbach's α of 0.98; response accuracy was similar between specialty and nonspecialty residents (54.6% vs 55.5%, p = 0.96). When provided recommendations that conflict with EBP, both nonspecialty and specialty residents more frequently followed recommendations rather than EBP; junior residents reported doing so to avoid conflict with superiors. Total 92.6% of surveyed residents felt cross-departmental EBP guidelines would improve patient care.Fa"
