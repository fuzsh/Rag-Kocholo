She was the third of five children born to Sherman and Ruby Lee Holmes, Jr. Dean would often speak fondly of growing up in Brandon, Mississippi and would relish opportunities to take family and friends on tours of local landmarks and places that were so important to the fabric of her childhood.\n\nAfter High School, Dean went on to attend Alcorn University before transferring to Jackson State University where she received her Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. After obtaining her Bachelor’s degree, she joined the National Guard and later enlisted in the United States Army Reserves.\n\nDean relocated to Los Angeles, California in the 1970’s, where she worked for the United States Postal Service for a number of years. During this time, she operated a catering business alongside her good friend Shirley Webb. Shortly thereafter, Dean accepted a job working at Blue Cross of California (now Wellpoint) where she retired after 20 years. Dean also retired from the Army Reserves after 30+ years of service. Dean truly believed in dedication, commitment and hard work.\n\nLos Angeles is where she found a very important pillar in her life, her church home of Greater Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church (GEMBC). As a member of GEMBC, she was active for many years as part of various auxiliaries including: Women’s Chorus, Sunday School, Baptist Training Union and Phoebe’s Circle. Additionally, she worked with the Saturday Morning Youth ministry. It was also at GEMBC where she would meet her future husband Deacon William Frank Jennings and after this union became a faithfully serving member of the Deaconess ministry.\n\nDean never met a stranger. She would always find something to talk to someone about. Dean would often joke that she could track down and find anything and anyone, who knew Dean well knew this to be true. Family, co-workers, friends and church family would be on the hunt for some niche or obscure antique or particular piece of clothing, and once Dean got wind of what the person was looking for, she would make several calls and trips to various stores to locate and secure the item. She found joy in these “treasure hunts” and would ask for nothing in return from the person that was seeking it. Very often, she would give ‘just because’ gifts to people in her life when something caught her eye and reminded her of them. Dean was truly a selfless giver who loved God, her family and others.\n\nDean was preceded in death by her parents; her husband, William Frank Jennings; two brothers, John Harold and Connie (Hannah).\n\nShe leaves to cherish her memory, her children: BPorshe (Charles), Justin, Robert (Pamela), William Jr. and Glynis (Otis); grandchildren: Tiara, Zemirah, Natassia (Courtney), Charles, Jr. (India), Jennelle and Maya.; great-grandchildren: Peyton, Casey, Cameron, Carter, Sophia, Lana and Molly; siblings, Karon and Donnie Joe; nieces and nephews: John, Jr., Timothy, Tomeka, Toriano ‘Rollow’, Andre, Ingrid, Johnathan (Adrienne) and Yolanda; and a host of family, friends, neighbors and church members to cherish her memories.\n\nPublic viewing will be from 12:00 PM until 6:00 PM, Thursday, August 10, 2023 at Clark S.

Internment in Gardens of Memory.\n\nJoseph Franklin Ervin was born May 13, 1928 in Forsyth County, North Carolina to the late George Butler and Rosabelle Dalton Ervin. Joseph was called to his eternal home at the age of 95, on June 13, 2023.\n\nHe attended Carver School and left at an early age to be of assistance to his parents at home. Joseph later joined the United States Navy where he served as a steward. The rest of his working career was spent as an employee of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company,\n\nThroughout his life Joseph always exhibited a strong work ethic. Joseph always arrived at work or to an event on time, or in most cases ahead of time. He expected punctuality from his family, doctors and everyone else. In his later years, he was more forgiving of others when they were running late.\n\nWhen given a task to complete, Joseph could be depended upon to get the job done from start to finish with a spirit of excellence. Whether training employees on the job at Reynolds, shopping for groceries, doing the laundry or chauffeuring his beloved wife, he took pride in completing his tasks efficiently and with a joyful spirit.\n\nJoseph and his wife Anna were married for 68 years. They were role models to their children and grandchildren by showing them how to remain united in spite of differing opinions. When faced with challenging situations, Joseph and Anna prayed, listened to each other’s point of view and then worked together to come up with solutions that they both could agree upon.\n\nJoseph was a servant leader in his home, church and community. He led by example with integrity, zeal and excellence. In his home he provided structure, security and stability for his family. On Sunday morning, the children knew that there would be stacks of coins for each one of them. They were not for a weekly allowance, but to put into the offering plate at church.\n\nJoseph was an active member of Bethania A.M.E. Zion Church and remained active in the church until experiencing health challenges. Joseph and Anna together exemplified a lifestyle where church and school activities were prioritized. He and the entire family participated together in worship, Sunday school and other church activities. All of his children were expected to know the 10 Commandments and Psalm 23 at an early age.\n\nSunday was an important day to Joseph and the Ervin household. After the Sunday church service, dinner that had been prepared (mostly on Saturday) by both parents was ready. Fried chicken and grape Kool--Aid or fresh lemonade were Sunday dinner staples. Joseph was the beverage maker for the meal, and he always called on one of the family members to sample. It was an honor to be the one to give the final stamp of approval before his concoction was served. Sunday dinner often included extended family members and friends. In the earlier years, the preacher and his family also frequented the Sunday dinners. Joseph and his wife Anna used these occasions as opportunities to teach their children that there are times that they were expected to put others before themselves. They might not get their favorite piece of chicken as guests and elders were served first. Joseph and his wife were very much involved in modeling and teaching family values and manners to their children. After dinner, the children usually went off to participate in their own activities, while the adults interacted with each other. As Joseph and Anna's children became adults, married and became parents, after dinner interaction became multigenerational. It became important for the grandchildren and great grandchildren to learn from and have their own memories of their elders. Joseph enjoyed playing board games, horseshoe pitching, family cookouts and making homemade ice cream with family participation.\n\nEducation was also important to Joseph and the family participated in school activities such as PTA and school programs. After retirement, he volunteered in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County school system as a lunch monitor and reading buddy. Joseph never missed an opportunity to vote in local, state, or federal elections.\n\nJoseph loved to sing with his siblings at the Ervin family reunions each summer and was also a member of: Senior Choir, Gospel Choir and Men’s Choir. As a servant leader, Joseph served on the Steward Board, was Chaplain of the Conference Lay Council, and President of the Winston Salem District Lay Council for more than 10 years.\n\nIn his latter months of life, he was literally a walking miracle inspired by the scripture Isaiah 40:31. He was told that he would not be able to stay at home without a lift, but on his second night home, he said that he felt like getting up. So, he miraculously sat up on his own, was able to stand with his walker, and had dinner at the table in his wheelchair.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents Butler and Rosabelle Dalton Ervin; his wife Anna Shouse Ervin; two sons Raymond Littlejohn Jr. and Wayne Littlejohn; sisters, Mary Abbott, Elizabeth Valentine, and Marie Mitchell; brothers, Jimmy Valentine, Wilson Ervin, and Jakay Ervin.\n\nHe leaves to celebrate his life and legacy his children, two devoted daughters, Renda (Floyd) Perry of Charlotte, NC and Pamela Nolan of Winston-Salem, NC; a faithful son, Philip Littlejohn (Peggy); two daughters-in-law; Barbara Littlejohn of Gardena, CA and Nettie Littlejohn of Winston-Salem, NC; eight grandchildren Justin (Lee) Perry, Jeanelle Perry and Joseph Perry of Charlotte, NC; Candrice (Khalif) Oliver of Wake Forest, NC, Bryan (Casondra) Littlejohn of Durham, NC, Raymond Littlejohn III of Gardena, CA, Pia Hardy and Ashley Nolan of Winston-Salem, NC. ; 10 great grandchildren: Justin “Gray” Perry Jr.; Stella Anna Perry; Skyler Nolan; Jacob Oliver; Micah Oliver; Gavin and Grayson Hardy; Camryn Littlejohn; and Bryson and Carlyn Littlejohn.

Bernice would impart counsel, knowledge and an overabundance of insight on everything from individual issues, religion, relationships to politics. It did not matter how sad, worried or confused you were when you arrived to Bernice’s home once you took your seat at the Round Table she had you seeing the issue in a different light.

Considered the glue among his family and friends, he was known for his humility and wise perspective that made people change the way they think. Born on August 9, 1970, to the late Edward Debnam and Mrs. Barbara Debnam, Step grew up in Winston-Salem, NC where he graduated from Carver High School and attended Winston-Salem State University and ECPI. During this time, he fostered close lifelong friendships, one of the most special being with his brother, Derick.\n\nOn September 6, 1997, he married Sherri A. Fields; they were blessed to have recently celebrated 25 years of marriage. Step was a supportive and encouraging husband, always believing in her ability to learn new things and accomplish her goals. Together, they raised two sons, Jamari and Justin, creating a close-knit family who enjoyed living life together. They not only found joy in simple, everyday living but in travel as well; they quickly found that the secret ingredient to an enriched life was being together. Their devotion remained solid through joyous times and the challenges of life.\n\nStep was a dedicated father who poured into his sons, constantly providing sound advice, spending quality time with them cooking and grilling, taking day trips to explore new restaurants, or watching Panthers games together (which they never missed). One of his final words to them was, “play chess, not checkers” and “be sure to think two steps ahead.”\n\nStep was a problem solver, technology whiz, creative genius, and serial entrepreneur. He could learn to fix and do anything, believing in the power of research to make it happen. This coupled with his creativity for branding and development, fueled their family business “Popcorn Fanatic”, a Winston-Salem favorite along with other e-commerce businesses.\n\nStep's humility, solid character, and perseverance have left a permanent imprint in the hearts of many; an imprint that will forever be remembered and will never be erased by his transition. He was preceded in death by his father, Edward Debnam, and niece, Destiny Debnam. Those who will lead carrying forth his memory and advice include his committed and loving wife, Sherri Debnam; proud sons, Jamari and Justin (Significant Other Uriah Cummings); his mother, Barbara Debnam; brother, Derick (Sharon) Debnam; father and mother-in-law, Herrell Sr. and Velma Fields; step-mother-in-law Paulette Smith; sisters-in-law LaShonda “Dee” Fields Hairston, Shanelle (Chris) Sellers; brothers-in-law Herrell Fields, Jr., Terrell Smith, and Chris (Monica) McMillian; and nieces and nephews, Derek Debnam, Jr, Nadiya Debnam, Zion Hairston, Zulay Hairston, Brookelyn Sellers, Zonntta’ Manns, Faith Hatton, and Zoé Fields.\n\nFor those who wish to honor Step's life, a Public Viewing will be held on Monday, November 28, 2022, at Clark S.
