        "text": "Introduction\n\nCKD affects 10%–15% of adults worldwide.1 CKD is associated with cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, premature mortality,2,3 and substantial burden on health care systems. Currently, CKD is defined by GFR, typically eGFR, or albuminuria by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR).4 The thresholds used to define CKD include GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or UACR >30 mg/g. Persons defined as having CKD have poorer prognosis; however, significant individual heterogeneity exists in CKD progression within these groups, underscoring the need for individual risk assessment. Quantifying an individual's absolute risk may allow for prioritization of therapies to the highest-risk individuals and avoiding medication over-prescription and costs for lower-risk individuals.\n\nCurrent CKD screening guidelines in the general population are conflicting, and no consensus exists on albuminuria screening among patients with hypertension.5–9 At present, only those with diabetes are required to be screened and monitored for albuminuria on the basis of Merit-based Incentive Payment System Clinical Quality Measures performance metrics.10\n\nThe kidney failure risk equation (KFRE), published in 2011, allowed for the estimation of an individual's absolute risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation.11 It was derived and validated using two Canadian cohorts11 and later validated using 31 multinational cohorts by the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC).12 Recently, CKD-PC developed and validated a risk metric to determine an individual's absolute 3-year risk of eGFR decline by ≥40% or kidney failure (3-year risk). This was developed in 707,931 and validated in 913,888 individuals, with 88% having eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2.13 The 3-year risk differs from the KFRE in three ways. Its composite end point is CKD progression or kidney failure as opposed to kidney failure alone. It incorporates ten other well-established risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) in addition to UACR and eGFR. Finally, it has been validated in those with preserved (eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and reduced (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) eGFR, thus making it applicable for any patient regardless of the presence or absence of a CKD diagnosis.11,13 We sought to understand the distribution of the individual-level risk of CKD progression in the US population, with and without CKD as currently defined, and evaluated how current CKD screening guidelines affect those with the highest absolute risk of CKD progression.\n\nMethods\n\nStudy Population\n\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a cross-sectional, multistage, stratified probability sampling of noninstitutionalized population in the United States, with the sampling methods published elsewhere.14 We used publicly available data from continuous NHANES from 1999 to 2020 where there was an oversampling of older adults; low-income persons; and Asian, Black, and Hispanic American individuals. We included 51,699 participants 18 years and older who had serum creatinine and UACR measured, were not on dialysis or had not received dialysis in the past 12 months, and had complete data on covariates of interest (Supplemental Figure 1). NHANES protocols were approved by the National Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\nSerum Creatinine and GFR Estimation\n\nSerum creatinine was assayed using the Jaffe rate method before 2017 and the enzymatic method from 2017 onward. Values before 2017 were adjusted to compare with values from 2017 onward using published equations (Supplemental Table 1).15 eGFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2021 creatinine equation.16\n\nAlbuminuria\n\nUrine albumin was measured using a solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay. Urine creatinine was assayed using the Jaffe reaction before 2007 and the enzymatic method from 2007 onward.17 Measurements before 2007 were adjusted to compare with values from 2007 onward using published equations (Supplemental Table 1).15 We quantified albuminuria using UACR.\n\nStaging and Eligibility for CKD Screening Using Albuminuria Testing\n\nCKD was defined as eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or UACR ≥30 mg/g on the basis of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 definitions.18 eGFR categories were based on KDIGO 2012 staging: G1 for GFR ≥90 ml/min per 1.73 m2, G2 60 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2, G3a 45 to <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, G3b 30 to <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2, G4 15 to <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and G5 <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2. We combined stages G3b, G4, and G5 because of fewer participants in these groups. Albuminuria categories included A1 for UACR <30 mg/g, A2 30–300 mg/g, and A3 >300 mg/g. We defined CKD with preserved eGFR as eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with UACR ≥30 mg/g, and CKD with reduced eGFR as eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 regardless of UACR. Adults with diabetes were considered eligible for albuminuria screening on the basis of the Merit-based Incentive Payment System Clinical Quality Measures performance metric.10\n\n3-Year Risk of ≥40% Decline in eGFR or Kidney Failure\n\nWe used prediction models developed by CKD-PC to calculate the 3-year risk of CKD progression, defined as ≥40% eGFR decline or kidney failure (need for dialysis or kidney transplantation).13 Variables of interest included age, sex, eGFR, UACR, systolic BP, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, body mass index, and smoking history. Use of diabetes drugs and glycated hemoglobin were included for those with diabetes (Supplemental Table 2). We categorized the 3-year risk as <1%, 1% to <5%, 5% to <10%, and ≥10% and defined ≥5% as being high risk.\n\nStudy Definitions\n\nDetailed NHANES procedures have been previously described.19 In brief, individual data were collected from interviews, questionnaires, physical examinations, and laboratory assays (Supplemental Table 3). Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl, glycated hemoglobin ≥6.5%, participant report of being diagnosed with diabetes, or taking oral hypoglycemics or insulin. The mean of three brachial systolic BP and diastolic BP measurements was obtained. When <3 readings were available, a single value or the mean of the two were used. Hypertension was defined as systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg, participant report of being diagnosed with hypertension, or taking antihypertensives. History of heart failure, coronary heart disease, and smoking was obtained from questionnaire data. Smoking status was classified as former, current, or never. History of atrial fibrillation is not available in NHANES.\n\nStatistical Analyses\n\nAll analyses used sampling weights to account for the complex NHANES survey design. We summarized descriptive statistics using frequency for categorical and mean±SD and median (interquartile range) for continuous variables. Baseline characteristics were described across 3-year risk categories. We calculated the 3-year risk with atrial fibrillation considered absent for all participants and performed a sensitivity analysis using irregular pulse as a surrogate for atrial fibrillation in 45,241 participants with pulse rhythm data. Cross-classification tables were used to compare the distributions of 3-year risk across stages of eGFR and UACR. We stratified our analyses by the following subgroups: no CKD on the basis of KDIGO criteria (eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR <30 mg/g), CKD with preserved eGFR (eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR ≥30 mg/g), and CKD with reduced eGFR (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2). We paid particular attention to those with CKD G3-A1 because a significant proportion of them may have reduced eGFR likely as a function of age rather than intrinsic kidney disease.20 We chose 5% as the cutoff for high risk because kidney event rates in the placebo arm of the recent sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitor and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist trials ranged from 7% to >20%.21–23 Kidney failure risks of 3% and 5% are also used as nephrology referral thresholds in Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively.24,25 All statistical analyses were performed using Stata SE, version 17 (StataCorp LP).\n\nResults\n\nBaseline Participant Characteristics\n\nTable 1 presents the baseline population characteristics across the 3-year risk categories. Participants with higher risk tended to be older, with a higher proportion of men and non-Hispanic Black persons, and had a higher prevalence of factors included in the risk equation. Mean eGFR of the entire study population was 96±17 ml/min per 1.73 m2, while mean eGFRs were 69±22 and 57±27 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in those with 5% to <10% and ≥10% risk, respectively.\n\nTable 1 - Baseline characteristics of adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2020\n\nCharacteristics Overall 3-Year Risk <1% 1% to <5% 5% to <10% ≥10% No. of participants, n (%) 51,699 33,610 (65) 14,756 (29) 2029 (4) 1304 (3) Weighted, n in millions (%) 199.81 143.15 (72) 48.24 (24) 5.37 (3) 3.05 (2) Age, yr, mean (SD) 46 (15) 39 (11) 63 (11) 70 (11) 69 (14) <65, n (%) 166.07 (83) 139.02 (97) 24.63 (51) 1.48 (28) 0.94 (31) ≥65, n (%) 33.74 (17) 4.13 (3) 23.61 (49) 3.89 (72) 2.11 (69) Female, n in millions (%) 102.39 (51) 69.96 (49) 27.82 (58) 3.06 (57) 1.55 (51) Race/ethnicity, n in millions (%)a Hispanic 28.14 (14) 22.37 (16) 4.95 (10) 0.48 (9) 0.33 (11) Non-Hispanic Asian 4.88 (2) 3.65 (3) 1.10 (2) 0.08 (1) 0.06 (2) Non-Hispanic Black 21.07 (11) 14.68 (10) 5.11 (11) 0.73 (14) 0.56 (18) Non-Hispanic White 136.84 (68) 95.80 (67) 35.25 (73) 3.87 (72) 1.92 (63) Other 8.87 (4) 6.65 (5) 1.83 (4) 0.22 (4) 0.18 (6) Body mass index, kg/m 2 , mean (SD) 29 (6) 28 (5) 30 (7) 30 (7) 32 (9) Obese, n in millions (%)b 70.22 (35) 44.13 (31) 22.11 (46) 2.34 (44) 1.63 (54) Systolic BP, mm Hg, mean (SD) 122 (15) 116 (10) 134 (17) 144 (25) 150 (29) Diastolic BP, mm Hg, mean (SD) 71 (10) 71 (8) 72 (12) 71 (16) 71 (17) Hypertension, n in millions (%) 77.35 (39) 30.49 (21) 38.74 (80) 5.15 (96) 2.97 (97) Receiving antihypertensives, n in millions (%) 56.97 (29) 17.44 (12) 32.08 (66) 4.67 (87) 2.78 (91) Diabetes, n in millions (%) 25.88 (13) 5.66 (4) 15.65 (32) 2.59 (48) 1.99 (65) Receiving diabetes medications, n in millions (%) 13.67 (7) 2.06 (1) 8.98 (19) 1.50 (28) 1.14 (37) Insulin use, n in millions (%) 4.56 (2) 0.47 (<1) 2.38 (5) 0.75 (14) 0.96 (31) Coronary heart disease, n in millions (%) 6.59 (3) 0.65 (<1) 3.86 (8) 1.23 (23) 0.85 (28) Heart failure, n in millions (%) 4.24 (2) 0.10 (<1)c 1.82 (4) 1.20 (22) 1.11 (36) Irregular pulse, n in millions (%) 4.52 (3) 1.60 (1) 2.22 (6) 0.44 (10) 0.27 (10) Smoking status, n in millions (%) Former 48.42 (24) 27.85 (19) 17.01 (35) 2.22 (41) 1.33 (44) Current 41.01 (21) 30.04 (21) 9.50 (20) 0.96 (18) 0.51 (17) Never 110.38 (55) 85.26 (60) 21.73 (45) 2.19 (41) 1.21 (40) HbA1c (%), median (IQR) 5.4 (5.1–5.7) 5.3 (5.1–5.5) 5.7 (5.4–6.2) 5.9 (5.5–6.9) 6.4 (5.7–7.8) HbA1c ≥6.5%, n in millions (%) 14.77 (7) 1.95 (1) 9.42 (20) 1.88 (35) 1.52 (50) Serum creatinine, mg/dl, mean (SD) 0.9 (0.2) 0.9 (0.1) 0.9 (0.2) 1.1 (0.4) 1.4 (0.9) eGFR, ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , mean (SD) 96 (17) 102 (14) 83 (17) 69 (22) 57 (27) eGFR categories, n in millions (%) ≥120 23.88 (12) 23.26 (16) 0.59 (1) 0.02 (0) 0.02 (0) 90–119 102.94 (52) 82.36 (58) 19.14 (40) 1.07 (20)c 0.36 (12)c 60–89 62.63 (31) 37.41 (26) 21.92 (45) 2.29 (43) 1.01 (33) 45–59 7.37 (4) 0.12 (<1) 5.54 (11) 1.16 (22) 0.56 (18) 30–44 2.33 (1) 0 (0)c 0.99 (2) 0.72 (13) 0.62 (20) <30 0.65 (<1) 0 (0)c 0.06 (<1) 0.11 (2) 0.48 (16) UACR (mg/g), median (IQR) 6.5 (4.3–11.6) 5.4 (3.9–8.3) 11.0 (6.8–21.3) 48.9 (23.7–108.4) 311.8 (88.6–858.3) UACR categories, n in millions (%) <30 181.20 (91) 139.26 (97) 40.00 (83) 1.77 (33) 0.17 (6) 30–300 16.08 (8) 3.84 (3) 7.78 (16) 3.13 (58) 1.33 (44) >300 2.53 (1) 0.05 (0)c 0.47 (1) 0.47 (9) 1.55 (51)\n\nData are presented as mean (SD), median (interquartile range), or number (N) and row percent (%).

Among the 102,320 persons without CKD and 3-year risk ≥10%, 97% had hypertension, 38% had diabetes, and 98% had heart failure (Supplemental Table 5).\n\nTable 2 - CKD progression risk across eGFR and albuminuria categories in the US population\n\neGFR Categories (ml/min per 1.73 m2) CKD Category 3-Year CKD Progression Risk Total <5% ≥5% Albuminuria <30 mg/g (A1) ≥120 No CKD 22.31 million (100.0%) 0 (0%)a 22.31 million 90‒119 No CKD 94.86 million (99.7%) 0.24 million (0.3%) 95.10 million 60‒89 No CKD 55.73 million (98.6%) 0.80 million (1.4%) 56.54 million 45‒59 G3a 5.33 million (94.1%) 0.33 million (5.9%) 5.66 million <45 G3b/G4/G5 1.02 million (64.5%) 0.56 million (35.5%) 1.59 million Albuminuria ≥30 mg/g (A2 and A3) ≥120 CKD with preserved eGFR (G1) 1.54 million (97.8%) 0.03 million (2.2%)a 1.57 million 90‒119 CKD with preserved eGFR (G1) 6.64 million (84.7%) 1.20 million (15.3%) 7.84 million 60‒89 CKD with preserved eGFR (G2) 3.60 million (59.0%) 2.50 million (41.0%) 6.10 million 45‒59 G3a 0.33 million (19.3%) 1.38 million (80.7%) 1.71 million <45 G3b/G4/G5 0.03 million (2.1%)a 1.36 million (97.9%) 1.39 million\n\nReported data account for the complex survey design used by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate nationally representative results. Percentages were expressed as row %. CKD is defined on the basis of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2012 guidelines. No CKD is defined as eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR <30 mg/g. CKD with preserved eGFR is defined as eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (CKD stages G1 and G2) and UACR ≥30 mg/g. eGFR categories were based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 2012 staging: G3a 45 to <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, G3b 30 to <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2, G4 15 to <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and G5 <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Individuals with stages G4 and G5 were combined because of fewer participants in these groups. Albuminuria categories included no albuminuria (<30 mg/g) and with albuminuria (A2 30–300 mg/g and A3 >300 mg/g). UACR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (mg/g).\n\naIndicates <30 survey participants for the category.\n\n3-Year Risk among Adults with Albuminuria and Preserved eGFR\n\nFor the majority (15.51 million, 60%) of adults with CKD (n=25.86 million), CKD was defined by the presence of albuminuria alone (UACR ≥30 mg/g and eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2). A total of 3.73 million adults in this group (24%) had a 3-year risk ≥5% (Figure 1A, Table 2, and Supplemental Table 4). Among them, only 2.22 million (59%) had diabetes (Supplemental Table 6). Thus, for 1.51 million (41%) persons in this group with high 3-year risk, quality metrics would not require albuminuria testing.\n\n3-Year Risk among Adults with Reduced eGFR\n\nOverall, 10.35 million adults with CKD had eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Of these, 6.71 million (65%) had a 3-year risk of <5%, 1.99 million (19%) had a 3-year risk of 5% to <10%, while 1.66 million persons (16%) had a 3-year risk ≥10% (Table 2 and Supplemental Table 4). 5.66 million adults (55%) with reduced eGFR belonged to CKD G3a-A1 (UACR<30 mg/g). In this group, 5.33 million (94%) had a 3-year risk of <5%, 330,635 (6%) had a risk of 5% to <10%, and only 2891 (0.1%) had ≥10% risk of CKD progression. Among the 1.40 million adults who were CKD G3b-A1, 435,962 (31%) had a 3-year risk of ≥5% (Supplemental Table 4). Adults with CKD G3a-A1 and G3b-A1 comprised 9% and 12% of those with high 3-year risk and reduced eGFR, respectively.\n\nSensitivity Analyses\n\nSupplemental Table 7 presents the distribution of 3-year risk in the US population using irregular pulse as a surrogate for atrial fibrillation. Overall, the results are similar to our primary analyses as described in the three key groups.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study with results generalizable to the US adult population, we had several key findings. First, 1.04 million US adults who do not meet laboratory-based criteria for CKD have a high risk (risk ≥5%) of CKD progression, and this risk is driven by factors other than eGFR or albuminuria. Second, 60% of US adults with CKD are classified as CKD on the basis of albuminuria alone (eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2). In this group, over 3.73 million (24%) have a high risk of CKD progression. Importantly, 1.51 million (41%) of them do not have diabetes and would not qualify for UACR testing according to current Merit-based Incentive Payment System Clinical Quality Measures quality metrics.10 Third, 55% of US adults with CKD belong to stage G3a-A1, and 94% of them have a low risk of CKD progression (risk <5%). Even among the 1.40 million adults with stage G3b-A1, 69% had 3-year risk <5%. These findings highlight the importance of considering the individual-level risk of progression in the definition and management of CKD, similar to how the risk of cardiovascular disease is considered in the treatment of hypertension.\n\nAt present, most patients with CKD are diagnosed and staged using guideline-recommended cutoffs of laboratory values, namely UACR and creatinine-derived eGFR, on the basis of expert consensus. An eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 is the threshold for diagnosing CKD unless albuminuria or structural disease is present, irrespective of eGFR.18 Prognostication of CKD relies heavily on eGFR and albuminuria stages. However, the risks of CKD progression and kidney failure attributed per CKD stage in the KDIGO heatmap4 are relative to those with eGFR >60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and no albuminuria.2 A 65-year-old patient with an eGFR of 50 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR of 15 mg/g is classified as stage G3a-A1 and deemed to have a four-fold higher risk of CKD progression and 22-fold higher risk of kidney failure compared with someone without CKD.18 For an individual categorized as stage 3a-A1, however, their range of possible CKD progression risk, 0.5%–12% in our study, is widely contingent on the presence of other risk factors, with different clinical management implications.\n\nThe KFRE published in 2011 allowed for the calculation of an individual's absolute risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplantation. The equation is publicly available and uses demographic and laboratory values, including eGFR and UACR.11,12 The KFRE is only valid for individuals with an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and does not provide an estimate of the risk of CKD progression, a key consideration when prescribing kidney function–preserving therapies. The KFRE does not include other risk factors of CKD progression, such as diabetes or hypertension. In recent years, several risk equations were developed to address these limitations. Klinrisk, developed and validated using Canadian cohorts, quantified individual-level CKD progression risk (40% decline in eGFR or kidney failure) using eGFR, UACR, and 18 other laboratory results.26 The Klinrisk algorithm and variable list are proprietary and not publicly available. KidneyIntelX was developed and validated using BioMe Biobank cohorts from both Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and University of Pennsylvania Health System. It is valid for individuals with type 2 diabetes and any CKD stage. KidneyIntelX uses seven clinical variables and three biomarkers (kidney injury molecule-1, TNF receptors 1 and 2) to calculate the risk of composite kidney outcomes (eGFR decline of ≥5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or ≥40% sustained decline in eGFR or kidney failure).27 The algorithm is proprietary, and the assay is currently priced at $950.28 By contrast, the CKD-PC 3-year risk equation was developed and validated using a multinational cohort of 707,931 and 913,888 individuals, respectively. It provides an individual's 3-year risk of CKD progression (40% decline in eGFR or kidney failure) and is valid for all individuals with or without diabetes or CKD.13 The equation is publicly available and uses readily available electronic health records data, which can allow electronic health record programming and availability at the point of care.\n\nOur study has important implications for public policy for CKD screening and is relevant to the US Preventive Services Task Force's ongoing revision of CKD and albuminuria screening guidelines.29 We found that 3.73 million adults with albuminuria but preserved eGFR (≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) had a high 3-year risk of CKD progression (risk ≥5%). These individuals can only be identified and adequately risk stratified if albuminuria testing is routine for high-risk populations. While both the National Kidney Foundation and the American Diabetes Association now recommend routine albuminuria testing for patients with CKD and diabetes,30,31 the American College of Physicians 2013 Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended against albuminuria testing in those with or without diabetes when already on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors.6 Guidelines for albuminuria screening in hypertension are also inconsistent.6,8,9 In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended against routine CKD screening for asymptomatic adults, while the American College of Physicians 2013 guidelines deemed no significant benefit of albuminuria testing among asymptomatic adults with CKD risk factors.5,6 Not surprisingly, a CKD-PC meta-analysis using the research and real-world cohorts found median albuminuria screening rates were only 35% in diabetes and 4% in hypertension.32 Our study suggests that routine albuminuria testing in individuals with eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 can identify 3.73 million US adults (2.22 million with diabetes and 1.51 million without diabetes) with a high risk of CKD progression. Almost 1 million of these US adults are Black or Hispanic individuals, racial/ethnic groups with a well-known high risk of CKD progression. Screening for albuminuria can be cost-effective in the long term,33 and without universal testing, these high-risk individuals would not be identified, potentially missing the opportunity of receiving new kidney-preserving therapies (sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitor, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists) and mitigating racial disparities in CKD progression.\n\nOur study has important clinical implications for population health and individualized patient care (precision medicine). From the population health perspective, the KFRE is being used in value-based care models to identify patients with CKD stage 4 and 5 at the highest risk of kidney failure and optimize their transition to kidney replacement treatments, a quality metric for the Kidney Care Choices model.34,35 The use of CKD progression risk models can similarly help focus resources toward preventing CKD progression and, ultimately, kidney failure. Our data in Supplemental Table 4 indicate that among 25.86 million US adults with CKD, the 3-year risk of CKD progression is ≥10% risk in 2.94 million (1% of the US population and 11% of those with CKD) and 5% to <10% risk in 4.43 million adults (2% of the US population and 17% of those with CKD). Of these high-risk individuals, 5.45 million have an eGFR ≥45 ml/min per 1.73 m2, a group that is currently not the focus of value-based care efforts. By contrast, we found a low 3-year risk (risk <5%) of CKD progression among 94% of persons with CKD G3a-A1 and 69% of those with CKD G3b-A1. These findings suggest that the 3-year risk of CKD progression can be used to prioritize CKD care and guide nephrology referral for high-risk patients. From an individualized patient care perspective, the absolute risk of CKD progression can help guide treatment decisions similar to using the 10-year Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk score for cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment decisions for stage 1 hypertension.36 Quantifying the 3-year risk for individual patients can guide treatment intensification using new kidney-preserving therapies21,23,37 in those at higher risk while avoiding overprescribing and potential side effects in those with lower risk, particularly many older individuals classified as CKD 3a-A1. The absolute risk of CKD progression in the CKD G3a-A1 category ranged from 0.5% to 12% in our study, suggesting opportunities for optimizing individual care. Overall, our findings align with the KDIGO 2024 guidelines that recommend the use of risk calculation models to quantify an individual's CKD progression risk.38\n\nIn treating patients, as opposed to population epidemiology, an individual's absolute risk of disease progression is more relevant than their theoretical relative risk compared with a healthy population. The Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk score has been useful in predicting one's 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease and has guided primary prevention therapy accordingly.39 The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines also recommended using the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk score to identify patients with stage 1 hypertension who may benefit from pharmacologic therapy.36 The 3-year risk could potentially be used in a similar manner, especially with recent clinical trials demonstrating that it is now possible to slow CKD progression using kidney-preserving therapies.21,23,37 The risk categorization can also be applied to guide nephrology referral for high-risk patients.\n\nOur study has important implications for future research. The efficacy of treatment intensification based solely on the pretreatment CKD progression risk is unknown. Post hoc analyses of recent landmark trials of kidney-preserving therapies21,23,37 can provide this information and assess efficacy in different strata of the CKD progression risk. These randomized controlled trials recruited individuals with eGFRs from 25 to 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACRs from 30 to 5000 mg/g. However, we found the 3-year risk of CKD progression to be high (risk ≥5%) in over 1 million US adults who do not have CKD on the basis of laboratory criteria (eGFR ≥60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and UACR <30 mg/g) but with concurrent risk factors of kidney disease, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart failure, or vascular disease. Further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of kidney-preserving therapies in these individuals. Finally, the 3-year risk was developed using data from an era before the new kidney-preserving therapies. Further studies are needed to evaluate the performance of the risk score in individuals receiving these therapies.\n\nOur study is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the NHANES study design, thus longitudinal outcomes could not be ascertained. Because the 3-year risk equation was previously validated in almost 1 million adults, we did not seek to revalidate this in our study, but rather understand the distribution of the 3-year CKD progression risk in the US population. We used one-time measurements of serum creatinine and UACR to define CKD. Both serum creatinine (by proxy eGFR) and UACR can fluctuate.40–42 Nevertheless, NHANES data currently form the basis for CKD prevalence estimates in the United States.43,44 Moreover, the calculation of the 3-year risk may be inadequate in younger persons because this does not consider their lifetime risk of kidney failure. However, these limitations are counterbalanced by several notable strengths of our study, including the NHANES design allowing generalizability to the US population, measurement of creatinine and UACR not influenced by clinical indications, and comprehensive data on comorbidities. Our findings can guide primary care management of CKD and improve resource allocation to those with the highest risk of progression.\n\nIn conclusion, we found that over 4.77 million adults with preserved eGFR had high risk of CKD progression, whereas most persons with CKD G3a-A1 and G3b-A1 had lower risk. Our findings highlight the importance of individualized risk assessment to identify the patients at the highest risk of CKD progression.\n\nDisclosures\n\nDisclosure forms, as provided by each author, are available with the online version of the article at https://links.lww.com/JSN/E701.\n\nFunding\n\nM.C.
