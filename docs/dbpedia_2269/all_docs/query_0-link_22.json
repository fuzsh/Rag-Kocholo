        "text": "Detection of Human and Mouse E‑Cadherin by Simple WesternTM. Simple Western lane view shows lysates of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line, P19 mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line, A431 human epithelial carcinoma cell line, and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, loaded at 0.2 mg/mL. A specific band was detected for E-Cadherin at approximately 128 kDa (as indicated) using 5 µg/mL of Goat Anti-Human/Mouse E-Cadherin Antigen Affinity-purified Polyclonal Antibody (Catalog # AF748) followed by 1:50 dilution of HRP-conjugated Anti-Goat IgG Secondary Antibody (Catalog # HAF109). This experiment was conducted under reducing conditions and using the 12-230 kDa separation system.\n\nDetection of Mouse E-Cadherin by Immunocytochemistry/Immunofluorescence Retention of the spermatogonial phenotype following gene correction.Immunostaining was performed on gene-corrected GT59 (left) and GT65 cells (right): DAZL, a germ cell specific marker; GFRA1, POU5F1, ETV5, CDH1, and SOHLH1, markers of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Additionally, GT59 and GT65 cells were treated with the differentiation factor, retinoic acid (1 µM) or a vehicle control and then immunostained to examine levels of ZBTB16, a marker of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Bar represents 50 microns. Image collected and cropped by CiteAb from the following publication (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25409432), licensed under a CC-BY license. Not internally tested by R&D Systems.\n\nDetection of Mouse E-Cadherin by Immunocytochemistry/Immunofluorescence Localization of MAFB in mouse testes.(A) Localization of MAFB in E18.5 mouse testes. Double immunostaining of MAFB with E-cadherin (ECAD), GATA4, or STAR is shown. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The color of each marker is indicated above the images. G; germ cells. S; Sertoli cells. L; Leydig cells. MAFB was specifically detected in Leydig cells and Sertoli cells. (B) Localization of MAFB in adult mouse testes. Double immunostaining of MAFB with E-cadherin (ECAD), KIT, SCP3, PNA Lectin, or vimentin is shown. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The color of each marker is indicated above the images. All seminiferous tubules shown represent stage VII. US; undifferentiated spermatogonia. DS; differentiated spermatogonia. P; pachytene spermatocytes. Sp; spermatids. S; Sertoli cells. L; Leydig cells. MAFB was specifically detected in Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and pachytene spermatocytes.

Not internally tested by R&D Systems.\n\nDetection of Mouse E-Cadherin by Immunocytochemistry/Immunofluorescence Cellular localization of PEDF in testicular spermatogenic cells. Methanol-fixed cells were used to stain premeiotic and meiotic/postmeiotic cells as described in Figure 2. (A) alpha 6-integrin, (B) GFR-alpha, (C) CDH1, (D) and NC—IF staining without the presence of primary antibody. (E) CREM, (F) Boule, (G) Acrosin and (H) NC—IF staining without the presence of primary antibody. Scale bar: 100 μm. Image collected and cropped by CiteAb from the following publication (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33498962), licensed under a CC-BY license. Not internally tested by R&D Systems.\n\nDetection of Mouse E-Cadherin by Immunocytochemistry/Immunofluorescence Testis morphogenesis of Mafb KO embryos developed normally.(A) Histological section of WT and KO E18.5 testes stained with HE. No morphological alteration or distribution was detectable. (B and C) Counts of Leydig and Sertoli cells from E18.5 WT and KO testes. Embryonic testes (n = 3 per genotype) were sectioned, and 4 sections for each gonad were randomly selected and stained with the germ cell marker E-cadherin (green) together with either STAR (red) or GATA4 (red). Numbers of STAR-positive cells outside seminiferous tubules (Leydig cells) or GATA4-positive cells inside the tubules (Sertoli cells) were counted per unit area. The values are the mean±S.D. *P<0.05. There was no significant difference between WT and KO cell counts. (D) The expression of genes involved in testes development and function. mRNA expression of the gene markers encoding for PGCs (Oct4), Leydig cells (Cyp17a1, StAR, Insl3, Hsd3b1, and Cyp11a1), and Sertoli cells (Amh, Sox9, and WT1) was determined by qRT-PCR in E18.5 WT and Mafb KO testes. Gene expression levels were normalized to Hprt. The bars represent the mean±SEM of five individuals. *P<0.05.
