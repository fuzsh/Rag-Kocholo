After her jobs as a factory worker and a nurse’s aide, she became a member of the Senior Citizens Club. She had a strong passion for traveling to different states and deep sea fishing, but most importantly she lived her life through simple pleasures like spending time with her friends and family, cooking, and taking walks around her neighborhood. Mary touched everyone she encountered and was truly a blessing to be around.\n\nMary will lovingly be remembered by her daughter, Rosalin Harris of Camden, South Carolina; her longtime friend Mary Halley; three grandchildren: Phyllis Mack of Hackensack, New Jersey, Tionese Alexander of Camden, South Carolina, and Arthur Mack of Camden, South Carolina; nieces: Eunice Thomas, Clarissa Thomas-Bracey, Tonya Thomas, and Hope Williams; nephews: Michael Thomas and Ray Williams; fourteen great-grandchildren: Alexander King, Dominique King, Marcus King, Solomon King, Fetima Mack, Kathleen Alexander, Jalen Alexander, Rajon Jefferson, Jordan Alexander, Kiera Alexander, Isaiah Mack, Sha’Born Davis, Shyriana Mack, and Levi King; and two great-great-grandchildren: Mckenzie Moses and Kaidren Byrd.\n\nMary was preceded in death by her two sisters: Charity Jones and Natalie Clark; her son; Russell Harris; and her grandson Eugene Mack.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Monday, September 17, 2018 at 11:00 AM at Grace Episcopal Church in Camden. Interment will follow at Cedar Cemetery. Public viewing will be held on Sunday from 3:00 PM until 6:00 PM at the funeral home.\n\nFamily and Friends may call or visit at the residence.\n\nCompassionate Professional Care has been entrusted to Brown's Funeral Home."
