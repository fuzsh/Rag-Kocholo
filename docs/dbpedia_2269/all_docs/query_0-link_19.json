We describe the protocol of a pilot study of a community health worker–occupational therapist-led lifestyle program, ¡Vivir Mi Vida! (¡VMV!), designed for delivery in primary care and adapted for late-midlife, Latino rural-living patients. Using mixed methods, we collected feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy data on ¡VMV!. Forty 50- to 64-year-old Latinos participated in a 16-week lifestyle intervention led by a community health worker–occupational therapist team. We conducted pre- and post-intervention assessments to evaluate the efficacy of ¡VMV! in improving psychosocial and clinical health outcomes. Focus groups and interviews were held post-intervention with participants and key stakeholders to assess feasibility and acceptability. This is the first trial designed to evaluate a lifestyle intervention that includes collaboration between occupational therapists and community health workers within primary care. The detailed description of methodology promotes research transparency and reproducibility of a community health worker–occupational therapist-led lifestyle intervention.\n\nBaranek, G.

Longitudinal assessment of stability of sensory features in children with autism spectrum disorder or other developmental disabilities. Autism Research, 12(1), 100–111. https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2008 Show abstract\n\nPrior research on the stability of sensory processing problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental disabilities (DD) has produced inconsistent results. We employed a longitudinal study design to assess the stability of three clinical sensory response patterns: hyporesponsiveness; hyperresponsiveness; and sensory interests, repetitions, and seeking behaviors (SIRS). Parents of children with ASD (n = 55) or DD (n = 35) responded to sensory questionnaires at two time points (T1 and T2) separated by 3.3 years on average, with the children aged 2–12 years (M = 5.69 ± 2.46) at the first assessment. For each sensory response pattern, regression analysis revealed that, for both ASD and DD groups, scores at T1 were strong predictors of scores at T2. Over the longitudinal assessment interval, there was a significant mean decline in severity for SIRS in both groups and for hyporesponsiveness in the ASD group. Parental estimates of the amount of therapy services received were positively associated with the severity of sensory features at T2, an outcome that may result from increased intervention dosages being administered to children who fail to improve over time. The results are discussed in terms of person‐centered and environmental considerations, which, in combination, have the capacity to affect stability outcomes for sensory features.\n\nCarlson, M., Vigen, C.

The intervention produced positive effects across a wide array of outcome domains. In settings in which clinical meaningfulness is an appropriate index of intervention outcomes, evidence suggests that LR produces effects that are clinically meaningful. As an evidence-based intervention, LR should be considered useful both in population-oriented contexts and in addressing discrete health conditions.\n\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS: Valid analyses demonstrate that the positive experimental effects of the WE 2 study are, in fact, genuine and cost-effective, and LR in clinically oriented contexts has produced statistically significant, clinically meaningful results. Clearly and accurately representing the evidence base of occupational therapy in prevention and chronic care is of critical importance to advance the field as a whole.\n\nSchepens Niemiec, S.

We conducted a qualitative pilot study with 11 Latinos in this demographic group to develop a foundational schema for the design of health promotion programs that could be implemented by occupational therapy practitioners in primary care settings for this population. One-on-one interviews addressing routines and activities, health management, and health care utilization were conducted, audiotaped, and transcribed. Results of a content analysis of the qualitative data revealed the following six domains of most concern: Weight Management; Disease Management; Mental Health and Well-Being; Personal Finances; Family, Friends, and Community; and Stress Management. A typology of perceived health-actualizing strategies was derived for each domain. This schema can be used by occupational therapy practitioners to inform the development of health-promotion lifestyle interventions designed specifically for late-middle-aged Latinos.\n\nMallinson, T., Schepens Niemiec, S.

The primary sample included 149 African American and 92 Hispanic men and women aged 60 to 95 years, recruited at senior activity centers and senior residences. Chi-square and logistic regression procedures were undertaken to examine study-based, psychosocial and health-related predictors of retention at 18 months following study entry. For both African Americans and Hispanics, intervention adherence was the strongest predictor. Retention was also related to high active coping and average (vs. high or low) levels of activity participation among African Americans and high social network strength among Hispanics. The results suggest that improved knowledge of the predictors of retention among minority elders can spawn new retention strategies that can be applied at individual, subgroup, and sample-wide levels.\n\nClark, F., Pyatak, E.

Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation, 84(7), 1543-1551. https://doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2012.754026 Show abstract\n\nThe most common strategy for comparing two independent groups is in terms of some measure of location intended to reflect the typical observation. However, it can be informative and important to compare the lower and upper quantiles as well, but when there are tied values, extant techniques suffer from practical concerns reviewed in the paper. For the special case where the goal is to compare the medians, a slight generalization of the percentile bootstrap method performs well in terms of controlling Type I errors when there are tied values [Wilcox RR. Comparing medians. Comput. Statist. Data Anal. 2006;51:1934–1943]. But our results indicate that when the goal is to compare the quartiles, or quantiles close to zero or one, this approach is highly unsatisfactory when the quantiles are estimated using a single order statistic or a weighted average of two order statistics. The main result in this paper is that when using the Harrell–Davis estimator, which uses all of the order statistics to estimate a quantile, control over the Type I error probability can be achieved in simulations, even when there are tied values, provided the sample sizes are not too small. It is demonstrated that this method can also have substantially higher power than the distribution free method derived by Doksum and Sievers [Plotting with confidence: graphical comparisons of two populations. Biometrika 1976;63:421–434]. Data from two studies are used to illustrate the practical advantages of the method studied here.\n\nCarlson, M., Park, D. J., Kuo, A., & Clark, F. (2014).

Journal of Occupational Science, 21(2), 117-129. https://doi.org/10.1080/14427591.2012.727356 Show abstract\n\nKnowledge of the construct of occupation remains fragmented within traditional social science disciplines. In this paper, we aim to provide a theoretical synthesis by explicating the unique properties of occupation in relation to the self within social science discourse. Occupations relate to other social science constructs in three ways: (a) they recruit a set of associated changes into a person's life; (b) they serve a person's ability to achieve important goals; and (c) they act as a mirror by reflecting multiple dimensions of the self. Key characteristics of occupation such as its experiential salience and its repetitional flavor powerfully amplify its significant role in affecting self-relevant outcomes. Occupation represents a crucial playing field that profoundly affects the unfolding of human lives. Therefore, the continued pursuit of occupational science is warranted and can uniquely contribute to an improved understanding of the self.\n\nWilcox, R. R., Vigen, C., Clark, F., & Carlson, M.

Participants were 460 community-dwelling older adults who responded to (1) global activity evaluations, (2) activity participation frequency scales, and (3) indices of life satisfaction, depression, and physical and mental health-related quality of life. Regression analyses indicated that global activity evaluations had a stronger relationship to psychosocial outcome indices than did participation frequency ratings, although both measurement approaches were associated with statistically significant predictions. However, global evaluations and participation frequency ratings were approximately equal in their ability to predict physical health-related quality of life. These relationships were fairly consistent across ethnic groups. Overall, the results suggest that ideally the two strategies for assessing activity should be incorporated in future research on activity and occupational therapy practice.\n\nWilcox, R.

Toward the latter end, intervention manuals are essential for ensuring trustworthiness and replicability of randomized controlled trials that aim to provide evidence of the effectiveness of occupational therapy. In this article, we review the literature on the process of intervention manualization. We then illustrate the prescribed steps through our experience in implementing the University of Southern California/Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center's collaborative Pressure Ulcer Prevention Project. In this research program, qualitative research provided the initial foundation for manualization of a multifaceted occupational therapy intervention designed to reduce the incidence of medically serious pressure ulcers in adults with spinal cord injury.\n\nWerner, J.

Psychological Assessment, 23(2), 558-562. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0022484 Show abstract\n\nReverse-scored items on assessment scales increase cognitive processing demands and may therefore lead to measurement problems for older adult respondents. In this study, the objective was to examine possible psychometric inadequacies of reverse-scored items on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) when used to assess ethnically diverse older adults. Using baseline data from a gerontologic clinical trial (n = 460), we tested the hypotheses that the reversed items on the CES-D (a) are less reliable than nonreversed items, (b) disproportionately lead to intraindividually atypical responses that are psychometrically problematic, and (c) evidence improved measurement properties when an imputation procedure based on the scale mean is used to replace atypical responses. In general, the results supported the hypotheses. Relative to nonreversed CES-D items, the 4 reversed items were less internally consistent, were associated with lower item-scale correlations, and were more often answered atypically at an intraindividual level. Further, the atypical responses were negatively correlated with responses to psychometrically sound nonreversed items that had similar content. The use of imputation to replace atypical responses enhanced the predictive validity of the set of reverse-scored items. Among older adult respondents, reverse-scored items are associated with measurement difficulties. It is recommended that appropriate correction procedures such as item readministration or statistical imputation be applied to reduce the difficulties.\n\nEakman, A. M., Carlson, M. E., & Clark, F.

The MAPA evidenced a sufficient level of internal consistency and test-retest reliability and correlated as theoretically predicted with the Life Satisfaction Index-Z, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey, the Purpose in Life Test, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Inventory and the Rand SF-36v2 Health Survey subscales. Zero-order correlations consistently demonstrated meaningful relationships between the MAPA and scales of psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life. Results from multiple regression analyses further substantiated these findings, as greater meaningful activity participation was associated with better psychological well-being and health-related quality of life. The MAPA appears to be a reliable and valid measure of meaningful activity, incorporating both subjective and objective indicators of activity engagement.\n\nEakman, A. M., Carlson, M.

The EMAS evidenced moderate test-retest reliability (r = .56) and good internal consistency (α = .89). Exploratory factor analysis (principal components) discerned a two-component structure within the EMAS, indicative of Personal-Competence and Social-Experiential meaning. The EMAS demonstrated theoretically predicted zero-order correlations with measures of meaning and purpose in life, depressive symptomology, life satisfaction, and health-related quality of life. Regression analyses discerned that purpose and meaning in life consistently predicted the EMAS and its components. Furthermore, individuals reporting greater levels of Social-Experiential relative to Personal-Competence meaning had the lowest levels of physical health-related quality of life. This study offers initial evidence in support of the EMAS as a valid measure of meaningful activity in older adults.\n\nJackson, J. M., Carlson, M. E., Rubayi, S., Scott, M. D., Atkins, M.

Data from a subset of these individuals are described; each of these stories contains a pressure ulcer risk episode related to wheeled mobility or cushion use. Identified risk episodes were associated with wheelchair selection, wheelchair adjustment, habituation to new equipment, lifestyle choices, and challenging life contexts. Examples highlighted the crucial relationship between individuals’ minute-to-minute decision-making and pressure ulcer risk.\n\nDunn, C. A., Carlson, M. E., Jackson, J. M., & Clark, F. A. (2009).

Full text Show abstract\n\nDuring the past century, numerous researchers and theorists have argued that human lives are largely shaped by the nonreflective realm of habit. Beyond this observation, however, scholarly conceptualizations of habit are widely divergent, ranging from neural-level to culturally saturated macro-level constructs. To clarify the multiple ways that habit has been construed and is related to rehabilitation, the authors present a typology of nine categories of habits: habit as tic; habit as neural networks; habit as conditioned responses; habit as addiction; habit as single, everyday activities; habit as routine; habit as custom, ritual, rite, or ceremony; habit as character; and habit as habitus. Although these categories overlap and share common properties, their conceptual features differ along several dimensions. Each category offers a distinct perspective from which to understand the role of habit in the lives of clients undergoing rehabilitation, which the authors illustrate using examples from the Pressure Ulcer Prevention Study (PUPS), a qualitative study on the contextual factors that lead to serious recurrent pressure ulcers in people with spinal cord injuries. The authors argue that habit is a ubiquitous, protean force that presents itself in many interlinking forms, steering the course of human lives in both health-promoting and destructive directions. To have the greatest effect on health and participation, rehabilitation professionals must examine the nuanced ways that habit may operate both in the lives of clients and in professional practice.\n\nClark, F.

Although pressure ulcers are often assumed to be preventable, research suggests that more than three fourths of individuals with an SCI will develop a pressure ulcer over the course of their lifetime. The total annual cost to treat these ulcers is nearly $1.5 billion. Not only can pressure ulcers be potentially life-threatening, but they can also impede the rehabilitation process and significantly disrupt the quality of life of persons with an SCI.\n\nBecause the pressure ulcer problem among persons with an SCI is so severe, it is important for clinicians to develop a full understanding of the underlying contributing factors in attempting to reduce pressure ulcer risk. Research has demonstrated that in the realm of lifestyle choices, factors such as poor fitness, inadequate nutrition, unemployment, decreased social involvement, substance abuse, and emotional stress can increase the risk for developing pressure ulcers. By focusing on generalizable quantitative relationships between variables, these researchers have demonstrated that, on average, individuals with an SCI who manifest a particular risk factor have a greater likelihood of developing a pressure ulcer.\n\nClark, F.

All participants completing the trial were followed for an additional 6 months without further intervention and then reevaluated using the same battery of instruments. Long-term benefit attributable to preventive OT was found for the quality of interaction scale of the Functional Status Questionnaire and for six of eight scales on the RAND SF-36: physical functioning, role functioning, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and general mental health (p < .05). Approximately 90% of the therapeutic gain observed following OT treatment was retained in follow-up. The finding of a sustained effect for preventive OT is of great public health relevance given the looming health care cost crisis associated with our nation's expanding elderly population.\n\nJackson, J.

With regard to this goal, current thinking points to the optimistic conclusion that potentially controllable lifestyle factors play a crucial role in enabling people to experience health and satisfying lives well into older adulthood. In this paper, the importance of occupation as providing a fundamental, personally relevant context for the enactment of sustainable lifestyle choices that foster successful ageing is described. This stress on the significance of occupation is supported by the successful outcome of an experimental test of a preventive occupational therapy intervention designed to promote health and psychosocial well-being in community dwelling elders. Based on the theory and research that is discussed, a practically oriented synthetic overview is provided of the conditions conducive to successful ageing.\n\nJackson, J. M., Carlson, M.

In a previously reported large-scale randomized effectiveness study, this intervention was found to be highly successful in enhancing the physical and mental health, occupational functioning, and life satisfaction of multicultural, community-dwelling elders. In this article, the philosophical background, manner of development, topical content, methods of program delivery, and mechanisms underlying the program's positive effects are discussed, along with implications for occupational therapy practice. The treatment was based on application of occupational science theory and research and emphasized the therapeutic process of lifestyle redesign in enabling the participants to actively and strategically select an individualized pattern of personally satisfying and health-promoting occupations. The wide-ranging effectiveness of the program supports the occupational therapy profession's emphasis on occupation in affecting health and positions practitioners to extend their services to the realm of preventive interventions.\n\nClark, F.

To evaluate the effects of change in posture on regional lung mechanics at different lung volumes, lung elastance and resistance were measured at graded volume subdivisions and three esophageal levels at seated and supine body positions, using the esophageal balloon technique. Volumes were adjusted to be the same in both postures. In general, lung elastance (both static and dynamic) tended to be higher in supine posture and uniform at all lung volumes, except at 80% vital capacity, where it increased sharply. The ratio of dynamic to static lung elastance was slightly higher at the cephalad esophageal level, where regional flow rates and relative volume expansion are lower. Lung resistance varied inversely with lung volume but was higher at corresponding volume subdivisions in the supine posture. It decreased at more cephalad esophageal levels, where volume expansion and flow are less. Thus, the increase in regional flow at low volume subdivisions (most marked in the supine position) also contributed to higher lung resistance at these volumes. These findings are explained on the basis of a combination of Newtonian physics as well as nonlinear viscoelastic properties of the lung as applied to regional flow and volume expansion.\n\nBaydur, A.

American Journal of Occupational Therapy, 50(2), 99-108. https://doi.org/10.5014/ajot.50.2.99 Show abstract\n\nOlder adults are at increased risk for a variety of physical and functional limitations that threaten their ability to lead independent and fulfilling lives. Consequently, they stand to benefit from personalized strategies of adaptation that enable them to achieve successful outcomes in their daily activities and desired goals. In the current investigation, a qualitative descriptive methodology was used to document the perceived life domain of importance and associated strategies of adaptation of 29 residents of Angelus Plaza, a federally subsidized apartment complex in downtown Los Angeles for low-income, well older adults. On the basis of interview data, 10 life domains were identified, and within each domain, a typology of adaptive strategies was derived. The domains were activities of daily living (ADL), adaptation to a multicultural environment, free time usage, grave illness and death–spirituality, health maintenance, mobility maintenance, personal finances, personal safety, psychological well-being and happiness, and relationships with others. Although the typology should not be generalized to a geriatric population, therapists may wish to refer to it to gain a sense of the extent to which certain adaptive strategies may be applicable to the lives of particular older adults to whom they deliver services. The teaching of these adaptive strategies could then be incorporated into an individualized treatment plan.\n\nThe typology also provides a broad picture of the kinds of adaptive strategies used by the older adults as a way of coping and adapting to their setting. Although some of the domains do not differ from those typically addressed in occupational therapy textbooks on geriatric care (e.g., ADL, health maintenance), others seem uniquely tailored to the specifics of the Angelus Plaza context (e.g., personal safety). Finally, certain domains emerged that may be highly relevant to older adults in most settings but are not typically the focus of occupational therapy programs (e.g., grave illness and death–spirituality, relationships with others). The emergence of these domains from our data suggests that therapists may wish to consider them more in treatment if they are convinced that they possess local relevance.\n\nCarlson, M.

For a sample of 15 distinct tests of occupational therapy, a positive unweighted mean effect size of .51 (54 when corrected for instrument unreliability) was obtained, along with a highly significant cumulative result for treatment success (p < .001). Beneficial treatment effects extended to activities of daily living—functional and psychosocial outcomes. The results for physical outcomes suggested a beneficial effect, although not every meta-analytic test yielded significant results. It was concluded that factors such as publication bias or poor study design are incapable of accounting for the positive meta-analytic result and that occupational therapy represents a worthwhile treatment option for older persons.\n\nCarlson, M.

Patients with neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and those with recent ketoacidosis were excluded from the study. The patient and control groups did not differ in sexual or skeletal maturation, weight, height, surface area, body mass index, abdominal fat, or paraspinal musculature. In diabetic children, cortical bone density was slightly but significantly lower than in controls (3.5% lower, P < .02); there was no difference between patients and controls regarding trabecular bone density. The decrease in cortical bone density in the diabetic group did not correlate with age, sex, duration of diabetes, or glycosylated hemoglobin levels. These results suggest that in children with uncomplicated IDDM, decreased vertebral bone density is a minor abnormality that only affects cortical bone.\n\nRoe, T.

The authors discuss difficulties that meta-analysts usually face when they try to investigate the effects of psychological mediators in a substantive research area and suggest the use of inferential judgments to overcome them. A validity study is presented that supports this recommendation. It shows that judgments regarding the level of psychological mediators, as inferred from a reading of method sections of social psychological experiments, correlate highly with manipulation-check effect sizes. This was true for each of two affective mediators (positive and negative mood) and each of two cognitive mediators (perception of control and source credibility). However, as was predicted from thle literature on the role playing of social psychological experiments, judgments about subjects' helping behavior or attitude change, though highly reliable, were not so consistently related to dependent-measure effect sizes.\n\nClark, F.

A general systems model is presented as a heuristic to explain occupation and organize knowledge in occupational science.

Next, exemplars of research methodologies that meet these criteria are described. In the conclusion, the role that nonscientific ways of knowing, such as art and literature, may play in the understanding of human occupation is discussed.\n\nGilsanz, V., Roe, T.

Although changes in calcium intake can modify the rate of decline in bone density in the mature skeleton, longitudinal assessments of the effect of dietary calcium supplementation during skeletal growth on peak bone mass have not been done in humans or experimental animals. Thus quantitative computed tomography (QCT) was used to monitor changes in vertebral bone density at 6-wk intervals during growth from 8 wk of age until skeletal maturity at 35 wk in male New Zealand White rabbits maintained on diets containing 0.15% (low Ca), 0.45% (normal Ca), or 1.35% (high Ca) calcium. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitriol levels increased, and renal calcium excretion decreased in low Ca compared with normal Ca; in contrast, serum calcitriol levels decreased and renal calcium excretion increased from control values in high Ca. Vertebral bone density by QCT did not differ during growth between high Ca and normal Ca, and peak values at epiphyseal closure also did not differ in these two groups. Vertebral bone density was lower, however, throughout the study in low Ca, and peak values at epiphyseal closure remained below those in either normal Ca or high Ca. Quantitative bone histology revealed decreases in cortical thickness in the third lumbar vertebra in low Ca, whereas trabecular bone area did not differ among groups; there was no histological evidence of osteomalacia in low Ca. Thus dietary calcium restriction during growth reduces peak bone mass at skeletal maturity, but raising dietary calcium intake above normal levels does not increase peak bone mass in this experimental model.\n\nGilsanz, V., Carlson, M.

Forty-two survivors of ALL had the trabecular bone density of the spine evaluated by quantitative computed tomography, 6 to 98 months (mean 42 months) after completion of chemotherapy. The ALL survivors had significantly lower bone density than age-, gender-, and race-matched nonleukemic control subjects had (10% less, p < 0.001); this decrease was accounted for solely by the subset of patients who had received cranial irradiation (n = 30; p < 0.001). The relative reduction in bone density in ALL survivors was unrelated to age at the time of diagnosis or time without therapy. The effects on bone density of 18 Gy and of 22.5 to 25.2 Gy were indistinguishable. We conclude that survivors of ALL commonly have reduced bone density in the lumbar spine and suggest that the diminution is related to nervous system irradiation, not to the disease or to chemotherapy.\n\nCarlson, M.

The first study, which examined the so-called weapons effect, the effect of name-mediated cues, and other cue effects, showed clear evidence that aggression cues augment aggressive responses in negatively aroused subjects. This was true for the overall analysis and for name-mediated cues, but confirmation of the weapons effect was restricted to cases wherein subject sophistication and evaluation apprehension were low. A second study used partial correlation analysis to assess independently the effects of seven potential mediators of aggression cue effects. Of these, target-based facilitation and harm capacity of the aggressive response were found to mediate the magnitude of cue-facilitated aggression. A third study showed that these mediators augmented cue effects among neutral as well as negatively aroused subjects. These outcomes are interpreted as emphasizing the role of cognitive factors in the expression of both impulsive and nonimpulsive aggression.\n\nBaydur, A. N., Gilgoff, I., Prentice, W., Carlson, M.

Carlson and N. Miller's (see record 1987-31249-001) method and objected to 3 reported tests of their negative state relief (NSR) model of mood-induced increments to helpfulness. In response, evidence is presented that the use of judges to define variables is a common tool in psychology and, when used within meta-analyses, consistently meets the relevant criteria of convergent, discriminant trait, and construct validity. Multiple new tests based directly on the more objective criteria that Cialdini and Fultz stipulate for defining NSR variables fail to support their model. New data they presented to challenge the discriminant validity of judges' ratings are shown to be based on methodologically and conceptually flawed procedures. Finally, they reported a (nonsignificant) positive correlation between sadness-manipulation check effect sizes and helpfulness effect sizes, in support of the NSR model. When this correlation was computed in 9 different ways on the basis of more extensive sets of studies, it was uniformly close to zero and nonsignificant, thereby supporting Carlson and Miller's prior meta-analytic outcome.\n\nGilsanz, V., Gibbens, D.

Full text Show abstract\n\nThe densities of the trabecular bone of two or three lumbar vertebral bodies in twenty adolescents, twelve to eighteen years old, who had Scheuermann disease were measured by quantitative computed tomography. These densities were then compared with those for the same vertebrae of twenty age, sex, and race-matched adolescents who were examined by computed tomography because of trauma. The same scanner and phantom were used in all examinations. Both the adolescents who had Scheuermann disease and the control patients were in good health before the quantitative computed-tomography examination and had not been taking any medications. The density of the trabecular bone density in the patients who had Scheuermann disease was not significantly different (p = 0.28) from that in the controls. There also were no significant differences between the patients and the controls with regard to height, weight, surface area, or body-mass index.\n\nGilsanz, V., Gibbens, D. T., Carlson, M.

Full text Show abstract\n\nTo determine whether limping is associated with decreased bone mineralization, the trabecular and integral bone densities (BDs) of 18 Caucasian children exhibiting computed tomographic evidence of tarsal coalition (14 boys, 4 girls, aged 9 years, 5 months to 16 years, 3 months) were compared with those of an age- and sex-matched control group. Patients with tarsal coalition had significantly lower trabecular (p < 0.05) and integral (p < 0.05) BD than controls. Trabecular spinal density was approximately 17% lower on the average in patients with tarsal coalition. Among the limping patients, neither the duration of symptoms nor bilaterality was associated with decreased BD. The findings suggest that painful tarsal coalition may decrease vertebral bone mass and predispose to spinal osteoporosis.\n\nCarlson, M. E., Marcus-Newhall, A., & Miller, N. (1989).

It was found that (a) alternative measures of physical aggression directed by the same subjects against the same target tend to intercorrelate positively within studies, (b) across studies, the correlations between effect-size estimates of physical and written aggression emitted by the same subjects are positive, and (c) physical and written aggressive responses are similarly influenced by theoretically relevant antecedent factors (e.g., personal attack and frustration). The consistent overall pattern of results supports the notion that aggression, defined as intent to harm, is a viable construct that possesses some degree of generality.\n\nGilsanz, V., Roe, T.

Vertebral QCT densities increased during growth, were highest at the time of epiphyseal closure, and were significantly greater (p < 0.001) in hormone-treated animals. In vivo QCT measurements in 12 vertebraes correlated strongly (r = 0.92) with percentage of calcium per weight assessed in vitro by neutron activation analysis.\n\nGilsanz, V., Gibbens, D.

The adolescent girls had a higher mean trabecular vertebral density (p < 0.01), suggesting that spinal density reaches its peak around the time of cessation of longitudinal growth and epiphyseal closure.\n\nKing, J., Diefendorf, D., Apthorp, J., Negrete, V.

Full text Show abstract\n\nTo assess empirically the radiologic appearance of fractures among victims of child abuse, the charts and radiographs of 189 battered children exhibiting fractures (n = 429 total fractures) were studied. Approximately one-half of the patients had a single fracture. Bones most commonly fractured were the humerus, femur, and tibia; transverse fractures were the most common type. Of long bone fractures, the middle third (50%) and distal third (41%) locations were most prominent. Age, race, and gender were not associated with any particular long bone fracture type. Skull fractures were the only type more likely to be present in children aged less than 1 year than in older children (p < 0.05, one-tailed). In the past, emphasis has been placed on corner fractures, fractures at different stages of healing, and injuries at several sites. Our results suggest that fresh single diaphyseal fractures are more common.\n\nGibbens, D. T., Gilsanz, V., Boechat, M. I., Dufer, D., Carlson, M. E., & Wang, C. I. (1988). Osteoporosis in cystic fibrosis. The Journal of Pediatrics, 113(2), 295-300. Full text Show abstract\n\nTo determine if osteoporosis is prevalent among patients with cystic fibrosis, we compared the vertebral bone density measured by quantitative computed tomography in 57 such patients (29 male, 28 female, aged 3 to 21 years) with those of an age-, race-, and sex-matched control group of 57 healthy subjects. Patients with cystic fibrosis had significantly lower bone density (10% lower, p < 0.001) than in controls. The decrease in bone density in patients with cystic fibrosis was unrelated to age. Shwachman clinical evaluation scores (based on case history, pulmonary physical findings, growth, and x-ray findings) correlated positively with age-standardized bone density values (p < 0.01). Male patients had substantially lower bone density than did female patients (p < 0.02), but bone density differences related to gender were not significant when effects of disease severity were controlled for. Decreased bone density was more common in patients with poor nutritional status as determined by anthropometric measurements (p < 0.05). We conclude that osteoporosis is a frequent complication in children with cystic fibrosis regardless of their age and is more prevalent in patients with greater disease severity.\n\nCarlson, M.

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55(2), 211-229. https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.55.2.211 Show abstract\n\nPast research has shown rather consistently that positive mood states lead to increased helpfulness. In an expanded analysis of the published literature, we examined six distinct views about this relation: the focus of attention, objective self-awareness, separate process, social outlook, mood maintenance, and concomitance hypotheses. For each of 61 positive affect conditions in which it was possible to generate an effect-size estimate corresponding to the relative degree of helpfulness exhibited by positive mood subjects (compared with neutral affect subjects), judges assessed the contextual levels of variables relevant to each of the six hypotheses by reading the Method section of each article. Higher-order partial correlation coefficients were then calculated to isolate the independent contribution of each of the theoretically relevant variables to the variation among the 61 effect sizes. The results support the focus of attention, separate process, social outlook, and mood maintenance hypotheses, and partially support the objective self-awareness and concomitance hypotheses.\n\nGilsanz, V., Gibbens, D.

Radiology, 166(3), 847-850. https://doi.org/10.1148/radiology.166.3.3340782 Show abstract\n\nTo determine changes in bone density during growth, trabecular vertebral density and an index of spinal cortical bone were measured with quantitative computed tomography in 101 children. The children were divided by age into three groups: prepubertal, indeterminate, and pubertal. Compared with prepubertal children, pubertal adolescents had significantly higher trabecular bone density and more compact bone in the spine (p < .001). After controlling for puberty, vertebral bone density failed to correlate significantly with age, sex, weight, height, surface area, and body mass index. The results indicate that bone density increases markedly during puberty.\n\nCarlson, M. E., & Miller, N. (1988). The differential effects of social and nonsocial negative events on aggressiveness.

Show abstract\n\nPrior research addressing the relation between negative affect and helping behavior has yielded inconsistent results. Three theoretical interpretations, negative-state relief, attentional focus, and responsibility/objective self-awareness, are examined in an expanded analysis of published research. For this purpose, judges assessed for each of 85 negative affect conditions the contextual levels of the variables relevant to each theory by reading relevant material that was excerpted from the method section of each article. Higher order partial correlations were then calculated between each variable and the 85 helpfulness effect sizes. The results are consistent with the attentional focus and the responsibility/objective self-awareness models. Both increased perceptions of responsibility for causing the negative event and attentional focus on another (as opposed to oneself) as the target of the negative event augment helpfulness. Furthermore, mood-lowering events that engender objective self-awareness promote helpfulness when prosocial values are psychologically salient. No support obtains for the negative-state relief model.\n\nCarlson, M. E. (1987). Abnormal bone density following treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
