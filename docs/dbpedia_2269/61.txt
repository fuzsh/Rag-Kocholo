The Franklin County Coroner's Office has identified 32-year-old Clarissa Williams as the adult who died early Sunday morning after driving a car off a trail and into a pond at Franklin Park on Columbus' Near East Side.

Williams' death appears to have been the result of drowning, but the coroner's autopsy report that would include the results of toxicology testing and official cause of death has not been completed.

Columbus police have reported that around 4:39 a.m. Sunday, an adult, now identified by the coroner's office as Williams, was driving her 2019 Nissan Altima westbound on a driving path on the southwest side of Franklin Park near the intersection of Franklin Park West and Franklin Park South. "For reasons unknown," police said the car went into the pond.

Responding officers reported the vehicle went into the pond. The Columbus Division of Fire dive team responded and retrieved Williams, who then transported by medics to Ohio State University East Hospital. She was pronounced dead at 5:59 a.m.

An investigation into what happened continues by the Columbus police Accident Investigation Unit.
