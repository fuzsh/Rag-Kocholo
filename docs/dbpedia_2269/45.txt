A woman was killed and a man who had been shot six times drove her to a Queens police station trying to seek help.

Authorities identified the woman as Clarisa Burgos, 28, and said she died after being shot once in the head.

The unidentified 39-year-old man had driven her to the 103rd precinct station in Queens after being shot six times himself. The fatal shooting took place near the corner of 127 Street and Liberty Avenue in the Richmond Hill neighborhood.

The driver was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition.

Now, police are investigating the shooting and working to identify suspects.

Multiple gunmen reportedly opened fire on the car, injuring the driver who then raced to a nearby NYPD station in a failed attempt to save the fatally wounded woman in his passenger seat.

The injured man pulled up to the 103 Precinct station house in Queens Tuesday night shortly before midnight, alerting officers to the harrowing incident, police said Wednesday.

Officers recovered 16 shell casings, both .45 caliber and 9mm, from the crime scene.

The injured driver has 29 arrests on his record, according to police.

Police are still searching for the suspects and say they are seeking two to three men wearing dark clothing who are believed to have fled in a dark-colored sedan.

The motive of the shooting remains under investigation.

No arrests have been made and the investigation remains ongoing.

The 106th Precinct, where the shooting occurred, has seen just one homicide this year, according to recent NYPD statistics. Shootings are reportedly also down more than 66 percent for the year.

Anyone with information regarding the shooting are encouraged to reach out to Crime Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS.
