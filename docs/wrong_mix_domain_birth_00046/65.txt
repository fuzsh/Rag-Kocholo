Justin Timberlake Wife

Hours before Justin Timberlake’s arrest, his wife Jessica Biel was photographed on the set of her new series “The Better Sister” in New York City’s Central Park. She was filming alongside Elizabeth Banks and Corey Stoll.

Early life

The son of Baptist church choir director Charles Randall Timberlake and Janet Lynn (Bomar) Harless, Justin Randall Timberlake was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on January 31, 1981. Timberlake’s two half-brothers from Charles’s second marriage to Lisa Perry are Jonathan and Stephen. In 1997, his half-sister Laura Katherine passed away soon after she was born. She is referred to as “My Angel in Heaven” in his album NSYNC’s acknowledgments. Several musicians are in his family; Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash are two of the country musicians his grandfather first exposed him to. When Timberlake was younger, he sang gospel and country music. At the age of 11, he had an appearance on Star Search, where he sang country songs under the character “Justin Randall”. At that point, he started to listen to.

Career

The two lead singers of the boy band NSYNC, Timberlake and Chasez, joined the group in 1995 and they started touring Europe in 1996. The group became well-known in the US in 1998 after releasing their self-titled debut studio album, which featured the hit song “Tearin’ Up My Heart” and sold 11 million copies. The number one single “It’s Gonna Be Me” from their second album No Strings Attached (2000) sold 2.4 million copies in its first week of release. Celebrity, NSYNC’s third album, was also a commercial hit in 2001. Some of the group’s top-five hits, including “Bye Bye Bye,” “Girlfriend,” and “This I Promise You,” were from their second and third studio albums. After the Celebrity Tour concluded, the group took a break in.

Artistry

Timberlake can sing in the lyric tenor register. Near the conclusion of his boyband career, he started incorporating beatboxing into his albums. This continued throughout his solo career, as evidenced by Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds. His personal life and relationships are the subject of many of his songs, most famously “Cry Me a River,” which is about his split with Britney Spears. Timberlake, who has been called a “consummate showman” by critics, typically performs with keyboard, piano, and guitar. After Timberlake’s 2015 Country Music Association Awards performance with Chris Stapleton, editor Katie Rogers of the New York Times emphasised Timberlake’s crossover appeal.

Legacy

According to modern journalists, Timberlake is known as the “Prince of Pop” and the “President of Pop.” The Hollywood Reporter editor Scott Feinberg said of Timberlake in a 2016 piece that he is “widely regarded as one of the greatest all-around entertainers in the history of show business”. He was named the year’s biggest pop star by Rolling Stone, which also put him on the cover and said that he “attained the one thing most pop stars don’t, and the one thing he wanted more than anything else: credibility.” He “redefined pop’s cutting edge” with his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, according to Entertainment Weekly, and “pushed boundaries more forcefully” (Vibe) than his male contemporaries’ work.[305] It “changed the game,” according to Jason Lipshutz, editor of Fuse TV.
