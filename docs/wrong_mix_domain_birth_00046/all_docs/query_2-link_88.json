        "text": "His lawyer will represent his client in court; the pop star is slated to be appearing in Poland on July 26 as part of his world tour.\n\nSAG HARBOR, NY — Justin Timberlake is not expected back in the Hamptons anytime soon.\n\nAlthough the pop star has a court date scheduled for July 26 after his DWI arrest in Sag Harbor in June, Timberlake is not slated to appear in person.\n\nInstead, his attorney, Edward Burke Jr. told Patch he will appear in his stead at the proceedings.\n\nTimberlake, according to his world tour schedule, is slated to appear in Poland on July 26, and will continue with the European leg of the tour through October, when he is scheduled to appear at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\n\nAccording to a Sag Harbor Village Police representative, Timberlake, 43, was arrested in the \"early morning hours\" on June 18 on the DWI charge and was arraigned.\n\nSag Harbor police said that at 12:37 a.m. Timberlake, of Tennessee, was seen driving a 2025 BMW southbound on Madison Street and failing to stop at a duly posted stop sign, as well as failing to maintain his lane of travel.\n\nA Sag Harbor Village police officer initiated a traffic stop and, upon investigation, determined that Timberlake was driving while intoxicated. He was placed under arrest, processed, and held overnight for morning arraignment, police said, the same protocol as in any other DWI arrest.\n\nTimberlake was arraigned at Sag Harbor Village Justice Court and released on his own recognizance, police said.\n\nBurke issued a statement after he was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated in Sag Harbor.\n\n\"I look forward to vigorously defending Mr. Timberlake on these allegations,\" said Burke. \"I will have a lot to say at the appropriate time but am currently awaiting full discovery from the District Attorney’s office.\"\n\nPolice released a mug shot taken of Timberlake after he was arrested on a driving while intoxicated charge in Sag Harbor — and was held in custody overnight.\n\nBurke told Patch that Timberlake was charged with a single count of DWI, a misdemeanor; he refused to take a breathalyzer test, he said. He was also charged with vehicle and traffic violations after failure to stopping at the stop sign and stay in his lane of travel, Burke said.\n\nTimberlake pleaded not guilty, he confirmed. \"There was no accident,\" Burke said. \"No one was hurt.\"\n\nTimberlake was released without bail, Burke said.\n\nA report by PIX11 as well as a number of media outlets said that court documents revealed Timberlake told police: \"I had one martini and I followed my friends home.\"\n\nThe New York Post reported that the criminal complaint said, of Timberlake: \"His eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot, and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests.\"\n\nNBC reported that Timberlake had dined at the iconic American Hotel and was headed to a friend's house when he was pulled over by police. The identity of that friend has not yet been disclosed.\n\nA representative for Timberlake could not immediately be reached.\n\nMeanwhile, fans have shown their love at various tour dates and Timberlake has expressed his gratitude.\n\nA video from a fan's TikTok account showed pop star Timberlake facing the crowd at a Chicago concert soon after his arrest: \"We've been together through ups and downs and lefts and rights,\" he said. \"It's been a tough week, but you're here, and I'm here and nothing can change this moment. I know sometimes I'm hard to love, but you keep on loving me and I love you right back.\" He blew a kiss to his fans.\n\nTimberlake is currently in the midst of the Forget Tomorrow World Tour; the 55-plus city tour has sold over one million tickets so far across the more than 85 performances.\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
