        "text": "HARRISONBURG, Va. (WHSV) - Justin Timberlake is back touring and has been accompanied by a man from the Shenandoah Valley at recent shows.\n\n“My mom for the longest time has always said ‘you’re going to work with Justin in some capacity I don’t know what, but you are’ and fast forward to now and here we are,” Andrew Hypes, a DJ from Waynesboro said.\n\nThe past few weekends you could find DJ Andrew Hypes in the booth during Justin Timberlake’s shows, including his hometown show in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n“The fans were so amazing, and the energy was just so incredible,” Hypes said.\n\nHowever, the journey to DJing for Justin Timberlake didn’t happen overnight.\n\nHypes was born in Waynesboro to a musician father which has led to music always flowing through Hypes’ blood.\n\n“One day I picked up the drumsticks and I just fell in love with playing music,” Hypes said.\n\nHe has moved and worked all across the country, but when it came to his big break, as the saying goes “It’s not what you know it’s who you know.”\n\n“Without even me being in the room essentially the president of his (Timberlake’s) label was like ‘Hey do you know any upcoming DJ, producers like the combination of the two’ and our mutual friend that I know, apparently instantly stood up and was like yeah you got to check this kid out,” Hypes said.\n\nHe said there are already plans in the works to DJ for Justin Timberlake again.\n\n“I would love to shout out Waynesboro, the support I’ve had throughout the years, I mean literally since the beginning has been a huge part of my drive and ambition I feel like coming where we’re from it is a small town there isn’t a lot of opportunity but you know I’m hoping that people will see that you can really do anything out here as long as you believe in yourself,” Hypes said.\n\nYou can follow Hypes’ work on his social media platforms here."
