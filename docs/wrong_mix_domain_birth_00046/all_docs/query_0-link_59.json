        "text": "ST. PAUL (WJON News) -- A three-time Grammy-winning artist, and a local favorite are coming to Minnesota in 2024. The Americana/Folk groups the Avett Brothers, and Trampled By Turtles will take the stage at the Xcel Energy Center on Thursday, October 24th.\n\nThe Avett Brothers came out of the gate strong with their critically acclaimed debut release “I And Love And You” in 2009. They backed it up with “The Carpenter” in 2012, which hit #4 on the Billboard 200, and “Magpie And The Dandelion,\" debuted on the Billboard 200 at #5 in 2013.\n\nThe group's most recent LP, 2020’s \"The Third Gleam\" debuted on the Billboard Americana/Folk Album chart at #1 and hit #1 on the Rock Albums and #1 on the Vinyl Albums charts. Plus, the single “Victory” hit #1 on the Americana Radio Singles Chart.\n\nTrampled By Turtles are from Duluth, MN where frontman Dave Simonett formed the group as a side project in 2003. After a slow start the group's fourth album “Duluth” picked up steam in the Bluegrass/Americana community with it hitting #8 on the Bluegrass Album Charts.\n\nThe band’s 2012 LP, “Stars and Satellites” crossed over and hit #32 on the Billboard Pop Chart, and their latest album “Alpenglow” was released in 2022. Tickets for the show go on sale on Friday, March 22nd at 10:00 a.m. on ticketmaster.com.\n\nREAD MORE FROM AUTHOR PAUL HABSTRITT:\n\nKVSC Trivia Zaniness Provided By “Goat Posse” For 30 Years\n\nPaynesville Broadcast Club Continues to Grow In 6th Year\n\nSartell Schools Doing Its Part To Boost State’s Computer Ranking\n\nEra Coming To An End For Cold Spring Opera House\n\nDestiny Calls Hanowski For Flyers Hall Of Fame\n\nYOUNG GYMNASTS MAKING HISTORY IN ALBANY"
