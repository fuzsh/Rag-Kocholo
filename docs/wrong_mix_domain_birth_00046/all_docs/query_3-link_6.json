Born in Memphis, Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of the boy band 'N Sync, whose launch was financed by Lou Pearlman.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee, to Janet Lynn (Bomar) Harless and Charles Randall Timberlake, a Baptist church choir director. Timberlake grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington. He has two half-brothers, Jonathan (born September 12, 1993) and Stephen (born August 14, 1998), from Charles' second marriage to Lisa Perry. His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth on May 12, 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album NSYNC as \"My Angel in Heaven\". His family circle includes a number of musicians; his grandfather introduced him to music from country artists like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. Performing as a child, Timberlake sang country and gospel music: at the age of 11, he appeared on the television show Star Search, performing country songs as \"Justin Randall\". By that time, he began listening to rhythm and blues musicians from the 1960s and 70s, such as Al Green, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and he had listening sessions with his father of studio albums by the Eagles and Bob Seger.\n\nIn 1993 and 1994, he was a Mouseketeer on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club, where his castmates included future girlfriend and singer Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, future bandmate JC Chasez, and future movie actors Ryan Gosling and Keri Russell. Timberlake then recruited Chasez to be in an all-male singing group, organized by boy band manager Lou Pearlman, that eventually became NSYNC.\n\nCareer\n\n1995–2003: 'N Sync, Justified, and the Super Bowl\n\nThe boy band 'N Sync formed in 1995, and began their career in 1996 in Europe; Timberlake and Chasez served as its two lead singers. In 1998, the group rose to prominence in the United States with the release of their self-titled debut studio album, which sold 11 million copies and included hit single \"Tearin' Up My Heart\". Their second album No Strings Attached (2000) sold 2.4 million copies in the first week and included a #1 single, \"It's Gonna Be Me\". 'N Sync's third album Celebrity (2001) was also financially successful. Upon the completion of the Celebrity Tour, the group went into hiatus in 2002. In its lifetime, 'N Sync was internationally famous and performed at the Academy Awards, the Olympics, and the Super Bowl, as well as selling more than 50 million copies worldwide, becoming the third-best selling boy band in history. In late 1999, Timberlake made his acting debut in the Disney Channel movie Model Behavior. He played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model. It was released on March 12, 2000. The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of 'N Sync. Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake's actions in his memoir Out of Sync. In August 2002, Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he premiered his debut solo single \"Like I Love You\"; it peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. His debut solo studio album Justified was released in November and debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 439,000 copies, fewer than previous 'N Sync releases. It went on to sell over three million copies in the U.S. and more than seven million copies worldwide. Its R&B influence, provided by hip-hop producers The Neptunes and Timbaland, was complimented by music critics. The album spawned the top 10 singles \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\". In summer 2003, Timberlake and Christina Aguilera headlined the Justified/Stripped Tour. Later that year he recorded a song \"I'm Lovin' It\", used by McDonald's as the theme to its \"I'm Lovin' It\" campaign. The deal with McDonald's earned Timberlake an estimated $6 million. A tour titled Justified and Lovin' It Live was included with the deal. Timberlake was featured on Nelly's song, \"Work It\", which was remixed and included on Nelly's 2003 remix album. In February 2004, during the halftime show of the Super Bowl XXXVIII broadcast on the CBS television network, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson before a television audience of more than 140 million viewers. At the end of the performance, as the song drew to a close, Timberlake tore off a part of Jackson's black leather costume in a \"costume reveal\" meant to accompany a portion of the song lyrics. Jackson's representative explained Timberlake intended \"to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed.\" Part of the costume detached, and Jackson's breast was briefly exposed. Timberlake apologized for the incident, stating he was \"sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl....\" The phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\" has since been used by the media to refer to the incident and has entered pop culture. Timberlake and Jackson were threatened with exclusion from the 2004 Grammy Awards unless they agreed to apologize on screen at the event. Timberlake attended and issued a scripted apology when accepting the first of two Grammy Awards he received that night (Best Pop Vocal Album for Justified and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Cry Me a River\").

Their relationship ended abruptly in March 2002. The breakup influenced the lyrics and theme of \"Cry Me a River\".\n\nIn April 2003, he began dating actress Cameron Diaz soon after they met at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. After much speculation of breakups throughout their relationship, the couple split in December 2004 shortly after she introduced him as musical guest on Saturday Night Live. In January 2005, they denied allegations of an alleged affair between Timberlake and Scarlett Johansson, with whom he had shot the music video for his song \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\".\n\nIn January 2005, Timberlake began dating actress Jessica Biel, with whom he had been photographed on multiple occasions. They became engaged in the mountains of Montana in December 2011. The couple married on October 19, 2012 at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy. Their son, Silas Randall Timberlake, was born in April 2015. In September 2020, ex-NSYNC member Lance Bass said that Timberlake and Biel had another child in July 2020, a son named Phineas. He has said he has obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) mixed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nIn June 2024, Timberlake would be arrested for driving while intoxicated.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilms\n\nYear\n\nFilm\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n2000\n\nLongshot\n\nHimself\n\nSupporting Role\n\n2000\n\nModel Behavior\n\nJason Sharp\n\nLead Role\n\n2003\n\nEdison\n\nJoshua Pollack\n\nLead Role\n\n2004\n\nAlpha Dog\n\nFrankie Ballenbacher\n\nLead Role\n\n2006\n\nThe Love Guru\n\nJacques \"Le Coq\" Grande\n\nLead Role\n\n2007\n\nBlack Snake Moan\n\nRonnie Morgan\n\nLead Role\n\n2007\n\nSouthland Tales\n\nPrivate Pilot Abilene\n\nLead Role, Narrator\n\n2007\n\nShrek The Third\n\nArtie\n\nVoice\n\n2009\n\nThe Open Road\n\nCarlton Garrett\n\nLead Role\n\n2010\n\nThe Social Network\n\nSean Parker\n\nLead Role\n\n2010\n\nYogi Bear\n\nBoo-Boo Bear\n\nVoice\n\n2011\n\nBad Teacher\n\nScott Delacorte\n\nLead Role\n\n2011\n\nFriends with Benefits\n\nDylan Harper\n\nLead Role\n\n2011\n\nIn Time\n\nWill Sallas\n\nLead Role\n\n2012\n\nTrouble with the Curve\n\nJohnny Flanagan\n\nLead Role\n\n2013\n\nRunner Runner\n\nRichie Furst\n\nLead Role\n\n2013\n\nInside Llewyn Davis\n\nJim Berkey\n\nSupporting Role\n\n2013\n\nThe Short Game\n\nExecutive Producer\n\n2016\n\nPopstar: Never Stop Never Stopping\n\nTyrus Quash\n\nSupporting Role\n\n2016\n\nJustin Timberlake + The Tennesse Kids\n\n2016\n\nTrolls\n\nBranch (voice)\n\nLead Role\n\n2017\n\nWonder Wheel\n\nMickey Rubin\n\nLead Role\n\n2020\n\nTrolls World Tour\n\nBranch (voice)\n\nLead Role\n\n2021\n\nPalmer\n\nEddie Palmer\n\nLead Role\n\nTelevision\n\nYear\n\nTitle\n\nRole\n\nNotes\n\n1993\n\nThe Mickey Mouse Club House\n\nHimself\n\nSeasons 6 & 7\n\n1999\n\nTouched By An Angel\n\nUnknown\n\n2001\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nHimself\n\nVoice\n\n2003-2011\n\nSaturday Night Live\n\nHimself/Backup Dancer\n\n7 episodes\n\n2003\n\nPunk'd\n\nHimself\n\n2 episodes\n\n2003\n\nMTV Movie Awards\n\nCo-Host\n\n2007\n\nKids' Choice Awards\n\nHost\n\n2008\n\nEspy Awards Host\n\n2009\n\nThe Phone\n\nExecutive Producer\n\n2011\n\nThe Cleveland Show\n\nPaul/Rallo's Booger (voice)\n\nEpisode: \"Terry's Unmarried\"\n\n2017\n\nTrolls Holiday\n\nBranch (voice)\n\nTV Special\n\nTours\n\nHeadlining\n\nThe Justified World Tour (2003-04)\n\nFutureSex/LoveShow (2005)\n\nThe 20/20 Experience World Tour (2013-15)\n\nThe Man of the Woods Tour (2018-19)\n\nCo-Headlining"
