        "text": "Thanks to Kacey Musgraves, The Civil Wars, Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Justin Timberlake, Pharrell Williams and others, we saw many Southerners receiving awards at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards held on Sunday, Jan. 26, 2014, from Los Angeles.\n\nThe big winners of the night were made up of artists from all parts of the globe like Daft Punk (The French electronic music duo consisting of musicians Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter) and Lorde (singer-songwriter from New Zealand). From the U.S., the big winners were Pharrell Williams and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. (see all the winners at the bottom of this article.)\n\nThe older artists were highly represented as well, with wins by Paul McCartney, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Throughout the years, this is quite the norm when it comes to The Grammy Awards, but this year the Awards managed to be somewhat daring with many of the choices that took home the trophy.\n\nAs far as Artists from The South, after Pharrell Williams, the next biggest winner of the night was Kacey Musgraves. She was up for four awards and took home two – one for Best Country Album (Same Trailer Different Park) and secondly for Best Country Song (Merry Go ‘Round). The Southland Music Line had high hopes for her winning Best New Artist, but that award went to Seattle’s Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. Darius Rucker, from Charleston, S.C., won Best Country Solo Performance for his song “Wagon Wheel.” Memphis born, Justin Timberlake picked up Best R&B Song for “Pusher Love Girl” and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration with Jay Z for “Holy Grail”. The video for his song, “Suit & Tie,” won for it’s director, David Fincher.\n\nMore winners from The South were: The Civil Wars (Best Country Duo/Group Performance for “From This Valley”); Former American Idol Contestant, Mandisa, who now lives near Nashville, won Best Contemporary Christian Album for “Overcomer”. The writers of the title track “Overcomer” also picked up the Grammy for Best Contemporary Christian Song.\n\nThe highly praised “Old Yellow Moon” by Emmylou Harris and Rodney Crowell won for Best Americana Album; Guy Clark won Best Folk Album for “My Favorite Picture of You”; Terrance Simien & The Zydeco Experience won Best Regional Roots Music Album for “Dockside Sessions” and then there was Snarky Puppy, a band that originated from the University of North Texas, that won Best R&B Performance.\n\nOverall, it was an interesting awards show and, as with all such shows, it’s very easy to disagree with, or not even like, some of the choices. Of course, as in previous years, so many great albums, songs and artists were overlooked, (Best example of that: Jason Isbell’s brilliant “Southeastern”). We have to just accept it and remember that award shows and honors are just part of the business of making music. However, never forget that hundreds of great bands, artists and albums are ‘out there’ for all of us fans to keep searching for. And how grand it is when we find them!\n\nThe following 56th Annual Grammy Award Winners have a connection to The South. They either originate and/or now call “The South” their home:\n\nThe following 56th Annual Grammy Award Winners have a connection to The South.
