        "text": "Justin Timberlake\n\nProfile\n\nChart History\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter, actor and entrepreneur. He first achieved fame as a contestant on Star Search, and went on to star in the Disney Channel television series The New Mickey Mouse Club, where he met future bandmate JC Chasez. Timberlake became famous in the late 1990s as the lead singer and youngest member of the boy band 'N Sync, whose launch was financed by Lou Pearlman.\n\nTimberlake's first two solo albums Justified (2002) and FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006) established him as one of the most commercially successful singers, with each exceeding sales of seven million copies worldwide. The former spawned hits \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\", while the latter debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart and produced the US number-one hit singles \"SexyBack\", \"My Love\", and \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\". From 2007 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career with starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher and Friends with Benefits. His third album The 20/20 Experience (2013) is preceded by lead single \"Suit & Tie\", which has peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nDate Title Peak Position # of plays Suit and Tie 14 22 Mirrors 1 45 Tunnel Vision 16 25 TKO 13 24 Not A Bad Thing 19 23 Can't Stop the Feeling 3 83\n\nOur Partners\n\nTune in to the most interesting “hot” stories from the local and international music scenes.
