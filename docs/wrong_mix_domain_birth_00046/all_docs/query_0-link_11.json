        "text": "\"Hailing from the same small town Luke Bryan calls home and graduating from the same high school as Cole Swindell, Nick proves to be yet another form of extreme talent that flows from the heart of South Georgia.\"\n\nfrom http://www.nickalligood.com/about.html\n\nM E E T T H E A R T I S T\n\nNicholas Patrick Alligood\n\nAge\n\n24\n\nHometown || Currently Live\n\nAlbany, GA || Nashville, TN\n\nWhat made you want to start singing/writing?\n\nI just kinda fell into it. I've played guitar in multiple bands over the years, but I honestly never imagined things would end up like they have! I worked for an entertainment company in South Georgia and my boss asked me to fill in for an artist who cancelled a show. So, I went to the venue knowing only 7 songs and having to play for 3 hours. Somehow I made it through the night! After the show a man walked up to me and asked me to play at a party he was having and I was completely shocked. So I began playing around town and experimenting with simple song writing. Next thing I know, I'm moving to Nashville, writing with some amazing songwriters, and blessed enough to tour regularly across the US. Its been a journey, that's for sure!\n\nDo you play any instruments? Did you teach yourself?\n\nGuitar and yes, I am self taught\n\nWho are your biggest musical inspirations?\n\nMan, this is the toughest question that can be asked of me for interviews haha. I've always listened to a variety of music. Of course with Luke Bryan being from my hometown area and with me graduating from the same high school as Cole Swindell (Terrell Academy), those guys have had a huge influence in my music. But growing up I listened to everything from Justin Timberlake to George Jones to Metallica.\n\nWhere do you get inspiration to write?\n\nEverywhere and anywhere. The first song I ever wrote was about as cliche as it can get. But it was about what I knew and it expressed how i felt, and to me that's what writing is all about. That first song gave me the inspiration to improve my writing!\n\nDo you have a favorite song that you’ve written or co-written?\n\nI would have to say it would be \"I Get It Honest\" It's a song that will appear on my EP Album this year. Its about my grandfather so it means a lot to me. It was co-written with Todd Hanchock.\n\nWhat moment in your career is your favorite thus far?\n\nThis past year I was honored to win 2014 Country Male Artist of the Year at the Georgia Music Awards.\n\nFinish this sentence, If I could write a song for or with anyone I would choose….?\n\nI would choose to write a song for Jason Aldean.\n\nIf I could sing a song with anyone I would choose….?\n\nKaty Perry, for sure. haha\n\nWhere do you see yourself in a year?\n\nHopefully picked up by a publishing company and still touring!\n\nIf I wasn’t a singer/songwriter I would be…?\n\nSomewhere in the business side of music for sure. Marketing is definitely a passion of mine!\n\nI’m afraid of…?\n\nSPIDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI never get tired of…?\n\nWaking up and getting to do what I love everyday!\n\nWhat is one thing people may not know about you?\n\nI'm VERY claustrophobic.\n\nWe are a month into the new year, what does 2015 look like you for? New music? Festivals? Etc.\n\nWe have an awesome tour lined up for 2015 and cant wait to hit the road February 11th! Some big shows with artists like Jerrod Niemann and Eric Paslay, as well as the opportunity to headline venues like The Grizzly Rose in Denver, Colorado! I will be releasing a six song Ep Album, so make sure to be looking out for that! Its going to be an awesome year!\n\nI N H A L E T H E E A R C A N D Y\n\nWith talk of 'shine', empty cans, backroads, and Silverados, Get It Girl is one of those country songs we all like to hear and love to live.\n\nPurchase Get It Girl on iTunes HERE:\n\nC O N N E C T"
