        "text": "Memphis-born Justin Timberlake got his start in entertainment as a child on “The All New Mickey Mouse Club” and “Star Search” before hitting it big with the pop group NSYNC, the late-’90s juggernaut that became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time.\n\nTimberlake went on to a hugely successful solo career. His 2002 album “Justified” netted him two Grammys, for the hit singles “Cry Me a River” and “Rock Your Body,” and his 2006 album “FutureSex/LoveSounds” yielded the hits “SexyBack” and “My Love.” The two albums have sold more than 10 million units worldwide, making Timberlake one of the most commercially successful artists of the decade. He followed those with “The 20/20 Experience” and “The 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2,” which debuted in 2013 to much acclaim.\n\nHe has also had a prominent film career, appearing in both commercial hits and auteur-driven fare, including “Friends With Benefits,” “In Time,” “The Social Network,” “Inside Llewyn Davis,” and the DreamWorks animated film “Trolls,” which features his fifth No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 single, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!”\n\nHe’s also a successful music producer, under his Tennman Records label, and a restaurateur, operating the Destine and Southern Hospitality eateries.\n\nNamed twice to Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World list, Timberlake has won nine Grammy Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards, three Brit Awards, and four Emmys for his popular “Saturday Night Live” appearances."
