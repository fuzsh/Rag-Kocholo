        "text": "SAG HARBOR, N.Y. — Justin Timberlake claimed he had just \"one martini\" beforehe was pulled over, failed field sobriety tests and was arrested on suspicion of intoxicated driving early Tuesday in the affluent Hamptons area of Long Island, police said.\n\nTimberlake — identified as a 43-year-old Franklin, Tennessee, resident in the criminal complaint — was arraigned and released without having to post bail about nine hours after he was arrested, police said.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty and was ordered to appear in court July 26, officials said.\n\nHis attorney, Edward Burke Jr., said in a statement Wednesday: \"I look forward to vigorously defending Mr. Timberlake on these allegations. I will have a lot to say at the appropriate time but am currently awaiting full discovery from the District Attorney’s office.\"\n\nTimberlake was behind the wheel of a gray Florida-registered BMW when he was stopped a little after 12:15 a.m. near Madison Street and Middle Line Highway, initially for driving through a stop sign and failing to stay on the right side of the road, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nBut once police spoke to Timberlake, they said, it was clear he was not in shape to drive, according to the complaint, written by Sag Harbor Village Police Officer Michael Arkinson.\n\nIt was \"ascertained that the defendant was operating said vehicle in an intoxicated condition in that his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath, he was unable to divide attention, he had slowed speech, he was unsteady afoot, and he performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,\" Arkinson wrote.\n\nTimberlake struggled to walk heel-to-toe and stand on one foot without swaying or using arms to balance, the report said.\n\nThe officer quoted Timberlake as saying: \"I had one martini and I followed my friends home.\"\n\nHe also declined to be tested for impairment, said police, who alleged he told them, \"No, I'm not doing a chemical test.\"\n\nNBC News legal analyst Danny Cevallos said: \"A refusal can be introduced at trial to establish conscious evidence of guilt. It is the predicate for a revocation of driving privileges.\"\n\nTimberlake had dined at the American Hotel in the Hamptons community of Sag Harbor \"and then headed to a friend’s house when he was pulled over by police,\" a source close to him said.\n\nWhile the property where the American Hotel now sits can trace its roots back to before 1776, this edition of the inn wasn't restored and opened again until 1972. It boasts an extensive wine list that includes dozens of four-digit offerings.\n\nTimberlake is set to play in Chicago on Friday and Saturday before he plays Madison Square Garden in New York City next Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nHis \"The Forget Tomorrow World Tour\" had been in Miami on Saturday and Tampa, Florida, on Friday.\n\nJust a day before he was arrested, Timberlake's wife, actor Jessica Biel, gushed about him as \"the rock\" of their family, pledging to keep him \"eternally grounded and warm.\"\n\nBiel's loving words are in stark contrast to the backlash Timberlake has faced from fans of former girlfriend Britney Spears.\n\nTimberlake, who rose to fame in the pop group NSYNC, wasn’t portrayed flatteringly in Spears' memoir last year, “The Woman in Me.” The pair, who met as kids on the set of “The Mickey Mouse Club,” dated from 1999 to 2002.\n\nSpears wrote that she had an abortion after she got pregnant by Timberlake, and she accused him of cheating on her “a couple of times.”\n\nIn January, Spears apologized on social media for offending anyone with her memoir and complimented Timberlake on his latest single. Days later at a show in New York City, Timberlake kicked off another round of online criticism by saying he’d “like to take this opportunity to apologize — to absolutely f---ing nobody.”\n\nPei-Sze Cheng and Adam Reiss reported from Sag Harbor, New York, and David K. Li and Brittany Kubicko from New York City."
