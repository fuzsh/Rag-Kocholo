        "text": "Here’s a little more on the Justin Timberlake story.\n\nSources at the American Hotel in Sag Harbor say Justin “was not intoxicated” when the restaurant shut down last night.\n\nJustin had been dining with a couple — that’s it, two people, not a crowd of the guys out for a good time.\n\nWhen the American Hotel shuts down the bar and dining room for the night, customers can stay on the very small terrace out front and finish their drinks.\n\nAccording to my sources, JT and the couple were polishing off a pitcher of martinis. Again, Timberlake didn’t appear to be drunk at all. He told the arresting officer he’d had “one martini” and was following his friends home.\n\nJustin listed his home address as Franklin, Tennessee. But the car he was driving, a grey BMW, was from Florida. On the police report, JT is listed as “glassy eyed.”\n\nA few people have suggested that JT was with his pal, Jimmy Fallon, who lives in East Hampton. But Jimmy has a week of live shows in New York this week for The Tonight Show, and no one in the restaurant indicated he was there."
