        "text": "Justin Timberlake’s birthday statement has resulted in unwanted attention. As we previously reported, the “Selfish” singer was performing on his birthday Wednesday (January 31) in New York City. In between songs, JT took the opportunity to apologize “to absolutely f—ing nobody.” With the internet in an uproar over his apology being a sarcastic, shady gesture against Britney Spears and Janet Jackson, the pushback has been immense. Yesterday, Britney caught wind of his “apology” and addressed him on Instagram. She wrote in response in her caption: “Someone told me someone was talking s— about me on the streets !!! Do you want to bring it to the court or will you go home crying to your mom like you did last time ??? I’m not sorry !!!”\n\nEverything He Thought It Wasn’t\n\nFollowing Brit’s response, Timberlake is apparently “seething” over the renewed drama with his ex-girlfriend for “overshadowing his new music,” a source tells Page Six. “Justin had hoped the backlash [from Spears’ memoir] would’ve blown over by now so that he could focus on his new album, which he’s very excited about, but every day is something new,” the insider says.\n\nJust two days prior to Justin’s “apology,” Spears actually apologized to him on Instagram in a post that has since been deleted. The “Womanizer” singer posted a clip of JT’s recent late-night show performance with Jimmy Fallon and The Roots with classroom instruments. In Spears’ post, she praised JT’s musical and comedic abilities. She started off by apologizing “for some of the things I wrote about in my book. If I offended any of the people I genuinely care about I am deeply sorry…” Spears revealed in her memoir, The Woman in Me, that she had an abortion while pregnant with the *NSYNC alum’s child. Spears wrote, “Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”\n\nJustin Timberlake’s 14 Greatest Music Videos Ranked\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
