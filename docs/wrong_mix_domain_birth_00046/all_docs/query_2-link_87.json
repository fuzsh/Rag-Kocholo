        "text": "The dark mahogany door swings open, and into the virtually empty locker room at Sherwood Country Club strides singer-songwriter-golfer Justin Timberlake. He's here for a casual, early-morning round at his home course, but his attire (perfectly pressed gray slacks, white polo and stylish black sweater vest) conveys something a little more formal. At 27 and admittedly a workaholic, Timberlake has spent much of the past few weeks writing and producing music. In between, he took a few days to write, rehearse and host ESPN's annual awards show, The ESPYs. A few weeks before that, he was promoting \"The Love Guru,\" a film in which he co-starred with Mike Myers and Jessica Alba.\n\nThere's no questioning Timberlake's love and respect for the game. Most of all, he's a smart guy and a kind-hearted person, a credit to his mom (Lynn Harless) and dad (stepfather Paul Harless). Timberlake says golf for him is mostly about playing with his dad, who introduced him to the game at Big Creek near Memphis. When the course was in danger of being turned into a housing development a year ago, Timberlake and his parents stepped in and bought it (Read, \"Giving Back In Memphis\").\n\nTimberlake's career began as a runner-up on \"Star Search\" in 1992. From there came a stint on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" with future girlfriend Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and others. And then came the mega boy band 'N Sync that sold more than 11 million copies of its first album. Today Timberlake is a six-time Grammy-winning solo artist with six No. 1 songs.\n\nDuring multiple interviews with Golf Digest, Timberlake talked about playing the world's greatest courses, and with some of film's best-known actresses, including girlfriend Jessica Biel. And he also told us about connecting with America's top teacher, Butch Harmon, for what JT described as his \"first real golf lesson\" earlier this year. In April, Harmon arranged for Timberlake and his dad to play Augusta National, and a few days prior to the U.S. Open, Harmon caddied for his pupil in the first Golf Digest U.S. Open Challenge at Torrey Pines.\n\nJustin Timberlake: We were backstage at Roseland in New York City, and I was about to go onstage with Madonna. I had found out earlier that day that Butch Harmon had arranged for my dad and me to play Augusta with one of Butch's friends, and I told my mom about it but said not to tell Dad because I wanted to surprise him. At first I was thinking I'd send a plane the day before we were supposed to play and just surprise him, tell him the plane was taking him to Augusta. The more I thought about it, I knew that if he knew he was going to get to play Augusta, he'd want to have a couple of weeks to prepare. So we're standing backstage, and my mom says, \"Why don't you go ahead and tell him now?\"\n\n[Laughs.] Oh, wow. I pulled my drive a little bit and ended up sort of behind the limbs of a tree on the left side, so I bumped a 6-iron down about 130 to 135 yards out. The pin was on the top right, and there were only about 10 to 12 paces behind the hole, so my caddie said the safe play was to hit a little wedge up there and leave me an uphill putt.\n\nYeah, and I hit the perfect shot. It was in the air, and my caddie said, \"That's all over it.\" My dad said, \"Man, that looks good.\" It landed about a yard from the back of the green, and we saw it start rolling back toward the hole. It was like slow motion. There was a group teeing off on the 14th hole that saw the whole thing. So it rolls all the way back into the cup for an eagle. Amazing.\n\nI got in the clubhouse afterward, and one of the guys from the group in front of us said, \"Man! Every time I looked back, you were hitting great shots. What did you shoot, two, three under?\" I did play great on the back, but I told him, \"You didn't see me on the front.\" I think I shot, like 85.\n\nBethpage Black. We just showed up one morning. It was the year they found out they were going to play the Open there. My dad and I showed up around 8 o'clock. I think the starter recognized me and got us out. There were four of us.\n\nGolf is me and buddies out having a good time, but most of all, golf is about me and my dad. Anytime I think of golf, I think about my dad. He taught me how to hit a golf ball, and he got me playing.\n\nWe were at a course one time, and all the members had called their kids. As we walked up the 18th hole, there were literally 300 kids standing there. They wanted me to stay and sign autographs, which I'd have been happy to do, but not if it was going to disturb the other golfers. I just don'tthink that's right.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I played basketball religiously. I begged my mom to get me voice lessons because I wanted to learn to sing the right way, but at the same time I was playing Junior Olympic basketball, and I was playing point guard for my school. But I was wanting to get into entertainment, into music and film and television.\n\nI think when I was about 12 or 13, my dad started taking me out to the local golf course, and that's the first time I ever hit a golf ball. I picked it up pretty quickly, just kind of monkey-see, monkey-do. But when I was 12, golf was so slow to me. For me it was basketball, girls and music.\n\nAround the same time there was a resurgence with some guy named Tiger Woods. So, the guys asked me if I knew how to play golf, and I told them, \"Yeah, I know how golf works.\" I remember I hit one amazing shot off the tee, straight down the middle. I got to thinking maybe I could play this game.\n\nYep. At around that time I had a house at Bay Hill in Orlando, just across the lake from where Tiger lives. I remember I bought the house when I was 17. It wasn't on the course, but you could take a golf cart over there pretty easily.\n\nNope, just self-taught. I'd watch Tiger and Ernie Els on TV and try to learn from what they did, but obviously I related music to it. The golf swing is very, very rhythmic. There's a certain tempo to it, just like in music. It just made sense to me. Music is everything to me.\n\nNot really. Until I feel like I'd have time to do it, it's not really the way I wanna play golf, you know what I mean? Golf is my getaway. I have my day job. I mean, there's gotta be something Tiger does for fun, right?\n\nI love being a songwriter, I love being a musician, I love being a producer, I love being an actor, I love working on a clothing line. I love all of those things because they're all creative. For me, golf is one of those things where you go out and forget about everything else.\n\nI've seen him there a couple of times, but I've never actually played with him. I joked with him by talking during his backswing. He's such a great guy. I don't know what Will plays to. If he could step his game up, he'd be great [for the Golf Digest U.S. Open Challenge.]\n\nMeeting somebody like John [[John Atkinson, winner of the Golf Digest contest, battling lung cancer] was a pretty amazing experience. The golf experience alone, playing on a U.S. Open course from where the pros get to play, was amazing. I'm pretty sure the pros got to play up a little bit on one or two holes every day, so the course we played might've been about 200 yards longer. I paid attention to that.\n\nIt was as hard as I expected it to be. Talking to Butch beforehand, I was so over-warned about how hard the rough would be. I never found myself, other than hole 9, with a shot out of the rough that I couldn't hit.\n\nThe other thing I'd like to point outâ€”and listen, in no way, shape or form can we play that course like themâ€”but in the fourth round, they weren't playing from the same rough that we were. By then, 50,000 people had walked all over that rough. I could tell from watching on television. The other thing I learned is that I should never play courses like that. I don't know if you saw me constantly pulling the tissues out, but I had an allergy attack, bad, that day.\n\nIt was really bad that day, I think because so many people were out trampling through the grass for the first time that week, and it was kicking up that Kikuyu. I was about to die. There was one time where I looked at Butch and said, \"I can't breathe.\" He was like, \"Are you OK? Do you need some help?\" And I was like, \"No, no, I don't want to have the opportunity for that to be on television.\"\n\nAt the Hope, with Sam Jackson, Joe Pesci, and our pro the first day was Justin Leonard. The more you play in them, the more you get used to just stepping up and hitting the ball. What got to me at Torrey was how slow it was. It took a looong time.\n\nI shot 82 or 83 out there earlier in the week during practice rounds, but the actual challenge was a lot different. It took a long time, and by the time we finally got something to eat, I had just made a 10 [on the par-5 ninth], and I could have just called it quits right then.\n\nI committed to be the host of the ESPYs because I knew that'd be a way for me to finally meet Tiger Woods. Then he tears an ACL, can't come, and I don't get to meet him. He's invited me to Tiger Jam before, and I hear it's a great event, so maybe I'll see him there sometime.\n\nI care what my peers think about my music. Most of the people who do concert reviews are like 80,000 years old. They all want to go see Bruce Springsteen. So if I make music that they like, then I'm doing something wrong. I don't want Bruce Springsteen's fans; they should go listen to his music. And, by the way, I love Bruce Springsteen's music, too.\n\nI watched it on YouTube many times. Tiger's response was like, I don't care. Wasn't that what he said? I could tell by the statement, the nature and the context and the delivery that she had no idea what she was saying.\n\nYou mean because it's expected of him? I love John. He's such a sweet guy. He's got such a big heart, and I think that's why he sometimes gets a pass. I've had about as much fun as you can have with anybody on a golf course while playing with John. We were playing one day, and John hit a 290-yard cut with a driver off a Coors Light can.\n\nObviously there were two people who were involved equally, and both of us chose to handle it in separate ways. That's apparent; we'd agree on that, right? I immediately apologized. Right? A lot of people misunderstood why I did that. The story that got spun was that I apologized because I wanted to perform on the Grammys. I didn't care about that.\n\nFor my family... for my grandmother and my grandfather. The other thing people have to understand is that... a lot of people said that certain people were left hung out to dry. Well, certain people left themselves hung out to dry. Certain people could have apologized as well.\n\nYeah, U.S. Open at Bethpage. I was there for the final round with my dad, but it started to get a little weird, so I put my dad in the grandstand at 18, and I went into a tent and watched Tiger do his thing.\n\nI'm just trying to be respectful. Those guys don't come hang out onstage while I'm trying to do my thing. They're playing for big purses, and I totally understand why some of them don't like playing with certain people, even in the pro-ams. Too distracting.\n\nI have a funny story about getting Peyton Manning's autograph on a jersey. The story is, I wasn't asking for Peyton's autograph. We ended up at a charity bowling event, and Peyton was there with his wife. I said, \"You know, I used to watch you when you were at Tennessee, and congratulations on the Colts and everything.\" He's like, \"That's cool, man. Say, can you get me a size 11Â½?\" And I realize he thinks I work at the bowling alley.\n\nA few months later, my road manager tells me that Peyton Manning or someone from his family has called asking for tickets to one of my shows. So I had my road manager call them back and say that Justin would be happy to give him tickets if he'd just send me a pair of size 11Â½ bowling shoesâ€”autographed. [Laughs.] He ended up sending me a jersey that's signed, To Justin. A True Tennessean.\n\nI have been at times. I dug a hole one time with my 5-iron because I hit a bad shot. But I remembered something that I tell my friends now when I'm teaching them: \"You're not good enough to be upset. Just go out there and have fun.\"\n\nI don't think I'm overpaid at all. I don't think I'm underpaid, either. I think I work for the money I get. People don't know the extent of the work I do. People probably think I just show up to the ESPYs and I know that song, I know that monologue, know that routine.\n\nThey aren't a big part of my life, fortunately. They sit outside my house every now and then, which is pretty weird. I'll go down there sometimes and let them take their pictures. \"Hey, guys. How's it goin'? You're not going to sit down here in front of my house all day, are you, 'cause ... that's kind of weird.\"\n\nAugusta. I definitely want a rematch with that place. Torrey Pines. I love to play the Olympic Club in San Francisco because of these hamburgers they make. Those are the best hamburgers I've ever had in my life. And I do love my home course, Big Creek in Tennessee. Carnoustie, I loved that one.\n\nI haven't. I've been asked a few times, but it's always right around New Year's, and it seems so weird to give up your family time to go play in a pro-am.\n\nPure passion. For golf, and I love doing charity work for kids. You see a young person like Katie, who was here today. She has a prosthetic leg. That's the point of this: She plays golf. She played with me at Riviera. It was all because of the Shriners Hospitals that she was able to get the prosthetic and is able to function with it.\n\nWhen the PGA Tour called me back so quickly, I realized that I had the right instinct. They said, \"We've been looking for someone that's your age, has your stature and your passion for the game to host a charity tournament. We feel like you open it up to another demographic.\"\n\nAbout a year ago I said to my team, \"I can't really think of a celebrity tournament that I really like. How can I get a celebrity tournament of my own? Call the PGA Tour and let them know that I'm interested.\"\n\nThe tour called back right away, and they had a few options. The first one was the Nissan Open [nowNorthern Trust] at Riviera, and I asked, \"What do you guys have in Vegas?\" They told me that the Vegas event had lost its luster, so I told them that Vegas is a perfect place for the golf-and-entertainment marriage. Riviera was my second choice, but I felt like Riviera was already a special event for the pros, with all the history there, and I didn't want to do anything to taint that.\n\nI'd like to have something for the celebrities, maybe not this year, but down the road, where maybe we have a competition for them on Monday and Tuesday. I know guys I play with like Sam Jackson,Alice Cooper, Darius Rucker, they like to compete.\n\nWe're trying to do something for the pro-am round, something a little more fun. I haven't even spoken to her about it, but I'd like to get Ellen DeGeneres to do a heckle hole, where she's on a tee box and talks to people while they try to hit. The only thing is, you have to do it in a way that's respectful of the game.\n\nJustin Timberlake is not a lifelong golfer, but Big Creek Golf Course near Memphis has been part of his life since he was 5 years old. Not only is it the public course where his stepfather, Paul Harless, first taught him to swing a club, it's where Harless and Timberlake's mom, Lynn, had their wedding reception in 1986.\n\nLast year, when Big Creek was about to be turned into a housing development, Timberlake and his parents bought it for $800,000. Their No. 1 goal was to save the golf course, but they also planned to improve it. When the renovated 7,400-yard course reopens next summer, probably on the Fourth of July, Memphis golfers will be blown away by the transformation.\n\n\"We're doing this for the area more than anything,\" says Timberlake, who says the course will remain a daily-fee. Green fees are expected to be $65-$75, including cart, and a nine-hole short course (about 3,300 yards) is being built to encourage beginners and families to take up the game. Timberlake hopes it becomes the home for a First Tee facility."
