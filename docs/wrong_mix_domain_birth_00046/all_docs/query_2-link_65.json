After doing time in The All-New Mickey Mouse Club, he makes his mark in the boy band 'N Sync before launching his solo career.\n\nJustin Timberlake releases his debut solo album, Justified. It debuts at #2 in America and earns Top 5 entries with the singles \"Cry Me A River\" and \"Rock Your Body.\"\n\nMcDonald's launches the \"I'm Lovin' It\" ad campaign in America, with Justin Timberlake singing the \"ba da ba ba bah\" hook and releasing a full-length version of the jingle as a single. It becomes the company's longest-running ad campaign.More\n\nJustin Timberlake makes his first appearance on Saturday Night Live, doing double-duty as host and musical guest. It's the first of many appearances he makes on the show through the coming years; his sketches eventually grow to include a Bee Gees parody, a sketch about dating Lady Gaga, a bailiff in a courtroom trial of an alligator, \"the Target lady,\" appearing in drag onstage with Beyonc√©, and the infamous \"Dick in a Box\" bit.\n\nJustin Timberlake wins the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Cry Me A River\" (inspired by his breakup with Britney Spears) and takes Best Pop Vocal Album for Justified. The prizes are the first Grammy wins for the former *NSYNC singer.\n\nJustin Timberlake punctuates the Super Bowl halftime show by tearing away part of Janet Jackson's costume, revealing her right breast to a massive audience that quickly reaches for their TiVos for a replay. Both artists blame it on a \"wardrobe malfunction,\" but while Jackson gets blacklisted, Timberlake is welcomed back by the music industry and the NFL after a series of apologies.More\n\nJustin Timberlake releases his second solo album, FutureSex: LoveSounds. Impelled by the lead single \"SexyBack,\" it goes to #1 in the US and sells over 9 million copies.\n\n\"SexyBack,\" the lead single from Justin Timberlake's second solo album, FutureSex: LoveSounds, hits #1 in America, where it stays for seven weeks. Timbaland and Nate \"Danja\" Hills are the producers - they're red hot, coming off Nelly Furtado's #1 \"Promiscuous.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake's \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\" wins the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.

His appearance in Stockholm, Sweden, leads to speculation that the USA will be invited to enter the song competition, following the successful addition of Australia to the line-up in 2015.\n\nJustin Timberlake accepts the Decade Award at the Teen Choice Awards, the first time the award is given out. He says, \"As a former teen, who's made a few choices along the way, I'm here to tell you that you and your choices matter.\""
