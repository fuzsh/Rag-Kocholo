        "text": "Dates: June 4, 2003 – September 2, 2003\n\nLegs: 2\n\nShows: 46\n\nThe Justified and Stripped Tours were three concert tours that took place in 2003. First American singer Justin Timberlake staged his Justified Tour. Then for the last legs of his routing, he was joined by fellow American singer and fellow-New Mickey Mouse Club alumni Christina Aguilera for the Justified and Stripped Tour. Then after Timberlake was done, Aguilera carried on for her Stripped World Tour.\n\nThe Justified & Stripped tour grossed $45 million in the United States alone. Altogether this was the most lucrative tour of 2003.\n\nJustin Timberlake began touring in support of his Justified album.\n\nJustified and Stripped was the third tour for Aguilera, and was sponsored among others by Coca-Cola. Material for the tour came from her most recent album Stripped, together with selections from the previous albums Christina Aguilera and Mi Reflejo, together with “Lady Marmalade” and “At Last”, the classic from Etta James.\n\nThe majority of the shows were opened by The Black Eyed Peas, with whom Timberlake had collaborated on the massive hit “Where is the Love?”. The tour itself counted on a team of over 150 people, including technicians of sound, light, video, etc. There were 20 buses of great transport to all carry the material, beyond more than 15 buses to transport the team itself.\n\nIn August an overhead lighting grid collapsed from the ceiling of Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, causing major damage to the sound and video equipment below. Because the collapse occurred hours before the performance, only a few stagehands were injured, but a few shows were cancelled and some postponed.\n\nRegardless, Justified and Stripped was one of the top-grossing tours of that year, and sold out most of its venues. Rolling Stone’s Music Awards tabbed it as the Best Tour of the Year via their Readers’ Poll.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of that year Aguilera continued to tour internationally without Timberlake, and changed the name of the tour consequently. Her set list remain fundamentally the same, except she added the song “Cruz.” This routing passed through some countries of Europe, Australia and Japan, starting on 22 September 2003 in Hamburg. Also negotiations for Brazil were made, at the beginning of 2004. In 2004 Aguilera part of the tour was shown in a 1 hour WB special with good ratings.\n\nEuropean performances formed the basis for her 2004 Stripped Live in the UK DVD release.
