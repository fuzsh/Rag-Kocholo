        "text": "It’s been five long years since renowned musician, actor, and entertainer Justin Timberlake has taken to the stage for a concert tour, leaving some fans wondering if he would ever return to his roots. Well, as the saying goes, good things come to those who live in Fort Worth. We may have changed the traditional saying a bit, but you get the picture.\n\nTimberlake’s upcoming 22 city tour, titled “The Forget Tomorrow World Tour” is making a stop in Cowtown on Tuesday, June 4, at Dickies Arena. This stop is scheduled to take place during the tour’s first leg, which comes as a shot of good news for fans of the former NSYNC singer’s music.\n\nIronically, just a few weeks after Timberlake’s stop in Cowtown, Dickies will also host female pop icon Janet Jackson’ s “Together Again” tour on July 25th. The irony is, the last time these two pop stars shared a stage on television they caused a bit of controversy, during their 2004 live performance at the XXXVIII Super Bowl halftime show. This is when the infamous moment in which Janet Jackson's right breast — adorned with a nipple shield — was exposed by Timberlake to the viewing public. But this is only one notable event in Timberlake’s storied career.\n\nOutside of this early 2000s viral moment, Timberlake has sold over 54 million albums and 63 million singles globally, and an even 70 million more as lead vocalist of as the aforementioned NSYNC pop boyband.\n\nSome of Timberlake’s accolades include ten GRAMMY Awards across the pop, dance and R&B genres, including a nod for his solo albums “Man of the Woods,” “The 20/20 Experience,” “FutureSex/LoveSounds,” and his debut solo album, “Justified.” Throughout his career, the “I Promise You” singer has garnered over 23 billion audio and video streams globally and won four Emmy Awards for his memorable stints on “Saturday Night Live.” Timberlake's last major tour took place in 2018/2019, in support of his last album “Man of the Woods.”\n\nThis new upcoming tour, which was announced Thursday evening by Timberlake who was a guest on the Jimmy Fallon Show, has created quite the buzz with pop-music fans far and wide. Timberlake, who just dropped his latest single, “Selfish” was more than happy to share the upcoming tour news on Fallon’s late night talk show before the duo went into an impromptu musical number.\n\nBesides the tour news, Timberlake announced the release date for his latest album, “Everything I Thought It Was” on March 15th. To further promote this new musical offering, the “Cry Me A River” singer will also be performing on Saturday Night Live on January 27th as the musical guest."
