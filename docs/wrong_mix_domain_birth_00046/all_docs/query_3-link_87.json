        "text": "This combination photo shows, from left, Janet Jackson performing at the Essence Festival in New Orleans on July 8, 2018, from left, Justin Timberlake performing during halftime of the NFL Super Bowl 52 football game in Minneapolis on Feb. 4, 2018 and Britney Spears performing during her concert in Taipei, Taiwan on June 13, 2017. (AP Photo)NEW YORK – In a lengthy social media post, Justin Timberlake says that he wants to apologize to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson “because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed.”“I’ve seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. AdFans called out Timberlake for contributing to Spears' very public breakdown and controlling the narrative about the end of their relationship. More backlash hit Timberlake as social media began to recall the wardrobe malfunction with Jackson that caused a national controversy at the 2004 Super Bowl. I want to take accountability for my own missteps in all of this as well as be part of a world that uplifts and supports,” Timberlake wrote.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Wednesday unveiled its shortlists for several categories, including documentary feature, international feature, original song, original score, visual effects and makeup and hairstyling. Titles as diverse as “Tenet” (for score and visual effects), “Borat Subsequent Moviefilm” (for the original song “Wuhan Flu”), “Eurovision Song Contest” (for song) and “Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Story” (for score, song and makeup) are in the initial mix. The Korean American film “Minari,\" which was controversially nominated for a foreign language Golden Globe, was not eligible in the same category for the Oscars. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross could find themselves double nominees, as both “Soul” and “Mank” were shortlisted for original score. Winners will be announced at the 93rd Oscars on Sunday, April 25, which will be telecast live on ABC.\n\nTimberlake’s had star turns in films like “Friends with Benefits” and “Inside Llewyn Davis,” but “Palmer” marks his time as a solo film headliner. Ad“Palmer” called for Timberlake to tone down his exuberance and play an intense, quiet, broken man living in a town where everyone knows his story. Director Fisher Stevens said he and Timberlake talked a lot about “stillness and trusting” while shooting the film. Palmer was raised with a more “stereotypical idea” of what it means to be a man and has to expand his mindset. And that’s kind of why I wanted to make the film,” Stevens said.\n\nThis image released by Syfy shows Alan Tudyk as Harry Vanderspeigle in a scene from the new series \"Resident Alien,\" premiering Wednesday on Syfy. — AP Film Writer Jake CoyleMUSIC— iHeartRadio’s fifth annual ALTer EGO show dedicated to contemporary rock artists starring Billie Eilish, Foo Fighters and Coldplay will air virtually on Thursday night. — British singer-songwriter Arlo Parks is having a breakthrough, and she can count former first lady Michelle Obama as a fan. — If a wacky sci-fi series sounds appealing, check out “Resident Alien.” Alan Tudyk plays Harry, masquerading as a small-town doctor — and a human — after crash-landing on Earth. Based on the comic book series of the same name, “Resident Alien” debuts 10 p.m. EST Wednesday on SyFy.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs won their first NFL title since 1970 when they beat San Francisco in last year's Super Bowl. What we get Sunday is a matchup of dynamic offenses and overlooked defenses, the top two teams in the conference. Kansas City (15-2) has the confidence of a reigning champion and a charisma few NFL teams can match. That could provide an edge over Bills rookie Tyler Bass — except that Bass has been very reliable all season. Buffalo punter Corey Bojorquez and Kansas City rookie Johnny Townsend were two of the most dependable in the AFC.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden watch fireworks light up the sky from the White House, Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2021, in Washington. Both he, Harris and their spouses walked the last short part of the route to the White House after an abridged parade. At Biden's invitation, congressional leaders from both parties bowed their heads in prayer in the socially distanced service a few blocks from the White House. The Bidens ended their evening watching fireworks from a White House balcony. Trump did adhere to one tradition and left a personal note for Biden in the Oval Office.\n\nLady Gaga sings the national anthem during the 59th Presidential Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol for President-elect Joe Biden in Washington, Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2021. And country star Garth Brooks, doffing his black cowboy hat, sang a soulful a capella rendition of “Amazing Grace,” his eyes closed for much of the song. While stars mostly eschewed Trump's inauguration four years ago, the A-list was back for Biden. Brooks was careful to call his decision to perform on Wednesday non-political, and in the spirit of unity. Alone with his guitar, The Boss sang his “Land of Hope and Dreams” in front of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nFinal preparations are made ahead of the 59th Presidential Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2021. What to watch for on Inauguration Day:THE SWEARING-INBiden's oath of office is the only essential. Others say the first eyewitness account of a president using those words came at Chester Arthur’s inauguration in 1881. Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman will read an original poem, “The Hill We Climb.”THE SPEECHA president’s inauguration speech is designed to set the tone and the policies the new administration will pursue. The National Mall is closed and just a fraction of the tickets usually handed out for an inauguration will be distributed.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden watch fireworks light up the sky from the White House, Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2021, in Washington. We’ve learned again that democracy is precious and democracy is fragile. At this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,\" Biden declared in his speech. Both he, Harris and their spouses walked the last short part of the route to the White House after an abridged parade. Biden then strode into the Oval Office, a room he knew well as vice president, for the first time as commander in chief.\n\n(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)Like so much this past year, the inaugural celebration will be like no other: pared down, distanced, much of it virtual. But for actor Christopher Jackson — the original George Washington in Broadway's “Hamilton\" — performing in a virtual “ball” is a way of participating in an essential rite of American democracy. Miranda will contribute a classical recitation, joining musicians like Bruce Springsteen, Katy Perry, John Legend, Demi Lovato, Foo Fighters, Justin Timberlake and Bon Jovi. The inaugural committee has made sure to blend this high-powered list with ordinary Americans and inspiring stories. And the “AAPI Inaugural Ball: Breaking Barriers” celebrated the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities with planned participants including actors Kal Penn, John Cho, Kumail Nanjiani and Chloe Bennet.\n\nIconic artists Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jon Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen are among the stars who will highlight a primetime virtual celebration televised Wednesday night following President-elect Joe Bidens inauguration. Biden’s inaugural committee announced the lineup Sunday for “Celebrating America,” a multinetwork broadcast that the committee bills as a mix of stars and everyday citizens. Musicians John Legend, Demi Lovato and Justin Timberlake, among others, will join Springsteen and Bon Jovi. The safeguards will remain in place leading up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday. Fencing, boarded-up windows and lines of police and National Guard troops have transformed statehouse grounds ahead of expected demonstrations leading up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday.\n\nThe outgoing president traditionally attends the inauguration to symbolize the peaceful transfer of power. And there will be no inaugural balls for Biden, Harris and their spouses to dance the night away. But in the wake of the violent Jan. 6 mob attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, all semblance of normality might be gone. Biden, first lady Jill Biden, Harris and second gentlemen Douglas Emhoff will later visit Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The inauguration comes just two weeks after the insurrection at the Capitol by Trump supporters as Congress was confirming Biden's victory.\n\nFILE - In this Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2020, file photo, Bill Murray tosses his putter into a bunker after missing a birdie putt on the 18th green of the Pebble Beach Golf Links during the celebrity challenge event of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am golf tournament, in Pebble Beach, Calif. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)The only stars at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am this year will be the players and the golf course. The 156-man field on Feb. 11-14 will be held only at Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill. The tournament will have a pro-am on Wednesday at Pebble Beach, as other PGA Tour events have done in recent months. Pebble Beach winners include Woods and Jack Nicklaus, and more recently Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and five-time winner Phil Mickelson.\n\nFILE - In this Nov. 2, 2020 file photo, Lady Gaga performs during a drive-in rally for then Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh. Try Lady Gaga and J. “In the end, I don’t think having Lady Gaga or J. “Lady Gaga is as big as you can get, and she is very talented,” he said. “If I were being inaugurated and I could have Lady Gaga, I would take it.”\n\nBon Jovi, Timberlake and Lovato will perform at a 90-minute primetime TV special celebrating the inauguration of Joe Biden as president of the United States. (AP Photo)NEW YORK – Tom Hanks will host a 90-minute primetime TV special celebrating the inauguration of Joe Biden as president of the United States, with performances by Justin Timberlake, Jon Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato and Ant Clemons. It will also be streamed live on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, Amazon Prime Video, Microsoft Bing, NewsNOW, DirectTV and U-verse. The inauguration will look different from other presidential inaugurations because of last week’s riot at the U.S. Capitol. The event was already going to be pared down because of COVID-19; Biden had asked supporters to say home and watch from afar.\n\nLOS ANGELES – The King of Pop is joining The Boss and Old Blue Eyes on SiriusXM satellite radio. The month-long Michael Jackson channel was announced Wednesday by the singer's estate. Jackson joins SiriusXM channels devoted to artists like Bruce Springsteen, Frank Sinatra and The Beatles. It will also include music that influenced Jackson from artists including James Brown and Sly & the Family Stone, and artists that Jackson influenced including Beyoncé, Justin Timberlake and Usher. Journalist and author Steven Ivory, a family friend who interviewed Jackson often, will provide the voice of the channel, telling stories, introducing discussions that chronicle the history and career of Jackson and sharing his own Jackson playlist.\n\nSome experts believe it could be more than a year until live concerts return to our daily lives, which is heartbreaking for people who love seeing live music. So until then, the next best thing to do is watch a concert movie from one of your favorite artists. Look no further than Beyoncé's “Homecoming,” her live concert that was filmed in 2018 when she headlined Coachella, the Southern California music festival. From the costumes, dancing and marching band music arrangements, Beyoncé transformed Coachella into “Beychella,” and we’re lucky enough that the entire show is documented. Not only is Timberlake’s music incredible catchy, but the production value that went into this show, especially the choreography, makes it worth visiting.\n\nJustin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are clearly smitten with one another and they aren't afraid to let their love show on Instagram. Back in August, Biel posted an old screen test clip from her 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Timberlake commented, \"God, I love you.\" In September, Biel posted a throwback bikini video, which prompted Timberlake's comment, \"Gimme...\"ET's Brooke Anderson spoke with Timberlake recently about his love for his wife of almost seven years.
