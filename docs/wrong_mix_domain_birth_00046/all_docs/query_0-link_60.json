        "text": "Performance Details\n\nFriday, August 9, 2024\n\nSLIGHTLY STOOPID\n\nWITH SPECIAL GUESTS\n\nCOMMON KINGS + FORTUNATE YOUTH\n\nABOUT SLIGHTLY STOOPID\n\nAs a musical brotherhood since 1995, Slightly Stoopid, led by the vastly versatile duo of Miles Doughty and Kyle McDonald, has expanded its fusion of rock, reggae, acoustic soul, hip hop, heavy metal, and punk rock, and achieved artistic freedom and commercial success while subscribing to their own DIY ethos. In the process, the talented collective has grown both onstage – from their original trio to a seven-piece ensemble – and as the generational forebearer of an immensely growing subculture and lifestyle movement.\n\nBound by their devotion to a musical agenda that relies on the spirit of collaboration and improvisation, and a social agenda that advocates for the freedom and legalization of marijuana, Slightly Stoopid’s musical melting pot continues to earn the respect of their mentors and peers, inspire countless young musicians, and delight millions of fans.\n\nLearn More >\n\nABOUT COMMON KINGS\n\nCommon Kings are more than a band of musicians, they are a family, a lifestyle, a community, a brother and sisterhood, having grown up together in California’s Orange County, four college mates who first met at a backyard barbeque 20-some years ago. Music was the common bond for these Pacific Islanders (all but one first-generation Americans) who have together transcended their Polynesian reggae roots to achieve pop crossover success since releasing their first music in 2011 – Samoan-born Hawaiian lead singer Sasualei “Jr. King” Maliga and Hawaii-raised Samoan guitarist Taumata “Mata” Grey; Fiji-born bassist Ivan “Uncle Lui” Kirimaua, and L.A.-born Tongan drummer Jerome “Big Rome” Taito. The band has toured with Justin Timberlake, Bruno Mars, Meghan Trainor, Fifth Harmony and CeeLo as well as headlining their own shows and music festivals around the country and world.\n\nLearn More >\n\nABOUT FORTUNATE YOUTH\n\nFrom backyard BBQs in Southern California beach towns to its rise as one of the most popular reggae rock bands in the country, Fortunate Youth remains devoted to its roots and a simple mission: Spread peace, love, and unity with music. It’s a mantra of sorts for the multi-faceted sextet from Hermosa Beach, driving a relentless thirst for live performances and an ever-evolving cache of original material dotted with influences of blues, ska, rock, world, soul, and punk.\n\n​\n\nDedicated to performing live, the ensemble has logged countless miles across the globe, with F.Y. supporting brethren such as Slightly Stoopid, Stick Figure, and SOJA.\n\nLearn More >\n\nGates open at 6:00pm, Show starts at 7:00pm.\n\nTicketing\n\nTICKETS ON SALE NOW!\n\nReserved Pavilion Tickets | Starting at $80.95\n\nGeneral Admission Tickets | $66.00\n\nDay of Show Tickets (if available) | $71.00\n\nSlightly Stoopid is proud to partner with Maui Food Bank so that $1 from every ticket sold will help support their mission to help the hungry on Maui.\n\nBUY TICKETS\n\n**There is a strict 8 ticket limit per show.
