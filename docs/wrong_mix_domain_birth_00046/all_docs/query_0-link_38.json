        "text": "When Justin Timberlake played his new material for close friends, they had one resounding reaction: \"This sounds like everything we know you for, everything we thought we wanted from you.\"\n\nThose words inspired the title of Timberlake's first album in six years, Everything I Thought It Was, which arrived March 15. The Memphis-born singer has described the release as \"incredibly honest\" but also as having \"a lot of f—ng fun\" — a statement that encapsulates how his music has evolved in the past three decades.\n\nSince his beginnings as a child entertainer on shows like Star Search and Disney's Mickey Mouse Club, and later as a member of best-selling boy band *NSYNC, Timberlake proved that he belonged on the stage. His charisma and passion made him stand out effortlessly, and those experiences foreshadowed his star power and the brilliant solo career he was poised to have.\n\nWhen *NSYNC announced their hiatus in April 2002, it took Timberlake just six months to release Justified, his debut LP. For the first time in a decade, he was introducing himself as an artist with full agency over his work, and showing exactly the kind of music he wanted to create.\n\n\"I felt like I had so much to prove to myself because I was coming from such a humongous group and a humongous movement of pop music,\" he reflected in a 2023 YouTube interview for Beatclub. \"There was a real sound around what people were considering pop music before I went solo ... I knew I wanted to make a different type of album.\"\n\nJustified promptly shifted Timberlake's good-boy image into a grown-up stunner. Through R&B, hip-hop and funk beats, he wears his heart on his sleeve; there's lust in lead single \"Like I Love You,\" pain in \"Cry Me A River,\" joy in \"Rock Your Body.\" It resonated with the public — the album peaked at No.2 on the Billboard 200 and spawned two top five singles, proving that Timberlake was more than ready to shine on his own. In addition, the album won him his first GRAMMYs in 2004 for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Cry Me A River\"; he had been nominated nine times with *NSYNC, and once for \"Like I Love You\" the year prior.\n\nLargely produced by the Neptunes and Timbaland, Justified also marked the beginning of a vital partnership for the singer. Timbaland was essential in shaping Timberlake's musical DNA, and helped produce a majority of his discography — including credits on two tracks of EITIW. \"We share the same perspective that we always want to make something that reminds us of music that we love, but at the same time is something we've never heard before,\" Timberlake told GRAMMY.com in 2014.\n\nFollowing Justified, Timberlake ventured into acting — another one of his burgeoning skills — landing roles in films like 2006's Alpha Dog and Black Snake Moan. However, 2006 was best known as the year Timberlake brought sexy back with his sophomore album, FutureSex/LoveSounds.\n\nConsidered by many as peak JT, FS/LS shot his popularity into the stratosphere and solidified him as a superstar in his own right. An avant-garde pop masterpiece, its 12 tracks weave R&B and electronic music, sprinkling in guitar solos and interludes, Timberlake's flawless falsetto and distorted synths. Its experimentalism laid the groundwork for what became known as Timberlake's signature sound, and what he would explore in the future — including on Everything I Thought It Was singles \"Selfish\" and \"Drown.\" The album also marked Timberlake's first solo No.1 on the Billboard 200, and produced three No.1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 in a row.\n\nAccording to Timberlake, those three singles — \"SexyBack,\" \"My Love,\" and \"What Goes Around…Comes Around\" — \"started a sound that I feel like it went on for, humbly speaking, a whole decade.\" FutureSex/LoveSounds earned Timberlake four more GRAMMYs: Best Dance Recording for \"SexyBack\" and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"My Love\" in 2007, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"What Goes Around…Comes Around\" and Best Dance Recording for \"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows\" in 2008.\n\nFollowing FS/LS, Timberlake started a six-year release pattern that he has continued through Everything I Thought It Was. During those down periods, he still managed to maintain his star prowess by landing successful acting spots and producing songs for artists such as Rihanna and Madonna. And the first six-year hiatus was clearly fruitful, as his third LP was a two-part beast: 2013'sThe 20/20 Experience.\n\nProduced by Timbaland and J-Roc, the double album displayed the singer at his most sophisticated yet, and reflected his growth in the decade since Justified came out. The first half's 10 tracks are lofty, lengthy meanderings inspired by neo soul and Timberlake's lasting love of '60s music.\n\n\"When we were making the record I said, 'If Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin can do 10-minute songs and Queen can do 10-minute songs, then why can't we?' We'll figure out the radio edits later,\" he told Capital FM at the time, according to NME. The album went straight to No.1 on the Billboard 200, spearheaded by the austere charm of \"Suit & Tie,\" featuring Jay-Z, and the stirring emotions of \"Mirrors.\"\n\nSix months later, Timberlake dropped the second half of his project, The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2, and the compilation of both albums, The 20/20 Experience – The Complete Experience. Comprising songs with a more accessible structure (though they still averaged 7 minutes), 2 of 2 also debuted at No.1 on the Billboard 200, and \"Pusher Love Girl\" won Timberlake his first Best R&B Song GRAMMY in 2014. Furthermore, its sounds pushed Timberlake's versatility to new edges, and deeply impacted his future releases.\n\nAs he entered his thirties, Timberlake's priorities shifted; he married actress Jessica Biel in 2012, and welcomed his first son, Silas, in 2015. A break from music was only natural, but this time it was also transformational — and reflected in his artistry. In 2016, in the middle of an album hiatus, Timberlake landed one of the biggest and most unexpected hits in his career: \"CAN'T STOP THE FEELING!.\"\n\nThe disco-infused single was part of the soundtrack for DreamWorks Animation's Trolls, where Timberlake voiced the character Branch and worked as executive music producer. Attesting his talent for making simple, feel-good hits, \"CAN'T STOP\" was Timberlake's first No.1 single in almost a decade, and earned him a GRAMMY for Best Song Written For Visual Media and an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. It is also his biggest streaming song to date, with over 1 billion listens on both Spotify and YouTube.\n\nTrolls brought Timberlake back into the limelight after years of focusing mostly on his personal life, and consequently created buzz around his upcoming releases. \"I wouldn't say [my new material] is the antithesis of 20/20, but it does sound more singular,\" he teased in an interview with Variety in 2016. \"If 20/20 sounded like it literally surrounds your entire head, this stuff feels more like it just punches you between the eyes.\"**\n\nIn 2018, Timberlake dropped his fifth studio album, Man Of The Woods, whose title derives from the meaning of Silas' name. The album itself was largely inspired by Timberlake's family and his Southern roots, and found him back with Timbaland and the Neptunes. The result is a record where Timberlake mixes his brand of funky pop while diving into the country and Americana sounds of his childhood. It's his most vulnerable work so far; in the album closer, \"Young Man,\" for example, Timberlake takes the position of a doting father passing on his teachings, wrapping it up with vocal snippets from Biel and Silas.\n\nEven though Man Of The Woods largely didn't have the same commercial impact as Timberlake's previous works, it still marked his fourth consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard 200, and the release lined up with a headlining gig at the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show — a testament to his staying power.\n\nIn the years prior to Everything I Thought It Was, Timberlake kept busy by collaborating with artists like SZA (\"The Other Side\" from Trolls World Tour), Calvin Harris (\"Stay with Me\" with Halsey and Pharrell Williams), and Jack Harlow (\"Parent Trap\"). He also welcomed second son, Phineas, in 2020, and worked in several movies, including two Trolls sequels.\n\n2023's Trolls Band Together, the latest installment of the franchise, also held a sweet, dreamlike surprise: Timberlake reunited with *NSYNC to release their first song together in 20 years. The heartwarming, funky \"Better Place\" was a reminder of the quintet's chemistry, and reignited hopes for further collaborations.\n\nLuckily, fans wouldn't need to wait for too long. *NSYNC is among the three featured artists on Everything I Thought It Was, on a breezy track called \"Paradise.\" (And those who were in attendance at Timberlake's \"one night only\" show at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on March 13 got to see the group's first performance together in over a decade, when they premiered \"Paradise\" and sang four *NSYNC classics.)\n\nThis isn't the only callback to the past on the album, though. The chill beats and adoring message of lead single \"Selfish\" bring to mind a refresh of 20/20's \"Not A Bad Thing\"; second single \"Drown\" rides on the same wavelength of \"Cry Me A River\" and \"What Goes Around…Comes Around,\" but tinged with more sadness than spite. Meanwhile, \"Sanctified\" is the pure ambition of FS/LS transmuted into a soul-opera-rock trip. Throughout the album's other 15 tracks, Timberlake also dabbles on heavy basslines (\"No Angels\"), disco melodies (\"My Favorite Drug\"), sweet R&B croons (\"Love & War\"), and sour, stingy ballads (\"Flame\").\n\nAs Timberlake declared himself on The Graham Norton Show, bits and pieces of all his previous works come together to form an updated version of himself on this album — one that is finally comfortable in being vulnerable, and thankful for everything he's been through. \"I'm everything you thought I was/ I'm everything I thought I was/ It was everything I thought it was,\" he sings in the opening track, \"Memphis.\"\n\n\"I'm having this moment in my life looking back on everything that has been, and accepting all of it. The good, the bad, the fast, the slow,\" he said on The Kelly Clarkson Show. \"It's just about arriving at this place right now in my life, as an artist, as a husband, as a father, as a human. And I'm just really excited about what the future holds.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake's Biggest Songs, From His Best *NSYNC Moments To The Solo Smashes\n\nMarch is Women’s History Month, and women in music are more powerful than ever.\n\nThe month begins with the comeback of several queens, starting with Kim Gordon’s The Collective and Ariana Grande’s Eternal Sunshine. Later, country darling Kacey Musgraves will unveil Deeper Well, and Shakira will drop the empowering Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran. Long-awaited debuts by GRAMMY-winning singer Tyla and singer/bassist Blu DeTiger will also join the lineup, with their respective Tyla and All I Ever Want Is Everything. Wrapping up March on a high note, Beyoncé will drop her highly-anticipated Act II on the 29th.\n\nMen will release music in March as well: Expect new releases by Justin Timberlake, Bleachers, the last record from pop-punk band Sum 41, and (allegedly) Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures 2.\n\nTo make the most of this prolific time, GRAMMY.com compiled all the must-hear albums dropping March 2024.\n\nSchoolboy Q - Blue Lips\n\nRelease date: March 1\n\nOn Feb. 1, Schoolboy Q’s website was updated with a mysterious countdown and a 37-second video. In it, the rapper finally unveiled the setlist and title of his much-awaited sixth studio album, Blue Lips, as well as its release date — March 1.\n\nBlue Lips is Q’s first full record since 2019’s Crash Talk, although he had been teasing the album since 2020. Hopefully, it was worth the wait: Blue Lips holds 18 tracks and participations by Rico Nasty, Freddie Gibbs, and more. Q has also started a new vlog series on social media called \"wHy not?,\" where he takes the viewers behind the scenes of making the album and previews snippets of the songs.\n\nSo far, the rapper shared tracks \"Blueslides,\" \"Back n Love\" with Devin Malik, \"Cooties\" and \"Love Birds\" with Devin Malik and Lance Skiiwalker, as well as lead single \"Yeern 101.\"\n\nBleachers - Bleachers\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nFronted by 10-time GRAMMY winner and 2024 Producer Of The Year Jack Antonoff, rock band Bleachers will release its eponymous fourth studio album on March 8.\n\nIn a press release, Bleachers is described as Antonoff’s \"distinctly New Jersey take on the bizarre sensory contradictions of modern life.\" The self-titled record will blend sadness and joy into \"music for driving on the highway to, for crying to and for dancing to at weddings.\"\n\nThe band shared four singles so far: lead track \"Modern Girl,\" \"Alma Mater\" featuring Lana del Rey, \"Tiny Moves\" and \"Me Before You.\" Through serendipitous melodies and soulful writing, Bleachers commit to \"exist in crazy times but remember what counts.\"\n\nBleachers will tour the U.K. in March and the U.S. in May and June.\n\nKim Gordon - The Collective\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nFormer Sonic Youth vocalist Kim Gordon will release her sophomore LP, The Collective, on March 8. The album is a follow-up to her 2019 debut No Home Record, and furthers her collaboration with producer Justin Raisen, as well as additional producing from Anthony Paul Lopez.\n\n\"On this record, I wanted to express the absolute craziness I feel around me right now,\" said Gordon in a press statement. \"This is a moment when nobody really knows what truth is, when facts don’t necessarily sway people, when everyone has their own side, creating a general sense of paranoia. To soothe, to dream, escape with drugs, TV shows, shopping, the internet, everything is easy, smooth, convenient, branded. It made me want to disrupt, to follow something unknown, maybe even to fail.\"\n\nBack in January, the singer unveiled the album’s moody first single, \"Bye Bye,\" and a music video starring her daughter, Coco Gordon Moore. The second single, \"I’m A Man,\" came out in February. Gordon will play six concerts in support of The Collective, starting March 21 in Burlington, Vermont.\n\nAriana Grande - Eternal Sunshine\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nIt’s been almost four years since Ariana Grande’s last studio album, 2020’s Positions. The starlet spent the past few years filming Wicked, an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, and declared that she wouldn’t be releasing any new records until it was done.\n\nThe wait is finally over, as Grande announced her seventh studio album, Eternal Sunshine. The album’s first and only single, \"Yes, And?,\" dropped in January, followed by an Instagram video of the soprano singer explaining the concept of the album to her Republic Records team.\n\n\"It’s kind of a concept album ’cause it’s all different heightened pieces of the same story, of the same experience,\" she said. \"Some of [the songs] are really vulnerable, some of them are like playing the part of what people kind of expect me to be sometimes and having fun with it.\"\n\n\"I think this one may be your favorite,\" Grande wrote of Eternal Sunshine on her Instagram Story. \"It is mine.\" The 13-song collection will reportedly explore house and R&B, and will have only one feature: Grande’s grandmother, who appears on the last track, \"Ordinary Things.\"\n\nKanye West and Ty Dolla $ign -Vultures 2\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nAfter a series of delays, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s first collaborative album, Vultures 1, ultimately dropped on Feb. 10, 2024. Set to be the first installment of a trilogy, the album was released independently through West’s YZY label, and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, with all of its 16 tracks also charting on Billboard’s Hot 100.\n\nBilled as ¥$, the duo plans to release Vultures 2 on March 8, and follow up with Vultures 3 on April 5. Although any other info about the upcoming volumes is still unclear, Timbaland recently shared on X (formerly Twitter) that Vultures 2 is \"OTW.\" (Timbaland produced Vultures 1’s \"Keys to My Life\" and \"Fuk Sumn\" with Playboi Carti and Travis Scott.)\n\nIn the past month, West and $ign held a few listening parties for the album in the U.S. and Europe, but additional schedules are yet to be revealed.\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain - Glasgow Eyes\n\nRelease date: March 8\n\nTo celebrate their 40th anniversary, alt-rock band the Jesus and Mary Chain will release their eighth studio album, Glasgow Eyes, on March 8.\n\nAs it can be seen on lead single \"Jamcod,\" the Scottish group still runs strong on the distorted synths and electrifying guitars that shaped their sound. \"People should expect a Jesus and Mary Chain record, and that’s certainly what Glasgow Eyes is,\" vocalist Jim Reid said in a statement. \"Our creative approach is remarkably the same as it was in 1984, just hit the studio and see what happens. We went in with a bunch of songs and let it take its course. There are no rules, you just do whatever it takes.\"\n\nGlasgow Eyes also mends a six-year gap since the Jesus and Mary Chain’s latest album, 2017’s Damage and Joy. To further commemorate, the band will also release an autobiography and embark on a European tour throughout March and April.\n\nJustin Timberlake - Everything I Thought It Was\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nJustin Timberlake is back with his first studio album since 2018’s Man of the Woods. The new record, Everything I Thought It Was, is spearheaded by singles \"Selfish\" and \"Drown.\"\n\n\"I worked for a long time on this album, and I ended up with 100 songs. So, narrowing them down to 18 was a thing,\" said Timberlake in an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1. \"I’m really excited about this album. I think every artist probably says this, but it is my best work.\" The Memphis singer also shared that there are \"incredibly honest\" moments in the album, but also \"a lot of f—ng fun.\"\n\nTo celebrate his return, Timberlake announced his Forget Tomorrow World Tour. Set to kick off on April 29 in Vancouver, the tour will cross through North America and Europe until its final date on Dec. 16 in Indianapolis.\n\nKacey Musgraves - Deeper Well\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nFresh off winning Best Country Duo/Group Performance at the 2024 GRAMMYs for the Zach Bryan duet \"I Remember Everything,\" Kacey Musgraves announced her fifth studio album, Deeper Well..\n\n\"My Saturn has returned/ When I turned 27/ Everything started to change,\" she sings in the contemplative title track, exploring how she changed over the last few years. The single sets the tone for the rest of the record, which was co-produced by longtime collaborators Ian Fitchuk and Daniel Tashian.\n\nFeaturing 14 tracks, Deeper Well was mostly recorded at the legendary Electric Lady studios in New York City. \"I was seeking some different environmental energy, and Electric Lady has the best mojo. Great ghosts,\" the country star noted in a press release.\n\nOn social media, Musgraves wrote: \"it’s a collection of songs I hold very dear to my heart. I hope it makes a home in all of your hearts, too.\" Deeper Well follows 2021’s star-crossed.\n\nTierra Whack - World Wide Whack\n\nRelease date: March 15\n\nWhen rapper Tierra Whack released her first album, 2018’s Whack World, she quickly garnered the admiration of both critics and fans. Comprising 15 one-minute tracks and music videos for each, the release was a refreshing introduction to a groundbreaking artist.\n\nIn 2024, the Philadelphia-born star is preparing to release World Wide Whack, labeled her official debut album in a press release. The cover artwork, created by Alex Da Corte, was inspired by theater character Pierrot, fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli and Donna Summer, and represents \"the first reveal of the World Wide Whack character, an alter ego both untouchable and vulnerable, superhuman and painfully human, whose surprising story will unfold in images and video over the course of the album’s visual rollout.\"\n\nThe album follows Whack’s 2021 EP trilogy — Rap?, Pop? and R&B? — and is foreshadowed by the poignant \"27 Club\" and the eccentric \"Shower Song.\"\n\nTyla - Tyla\n\nRelease date: March 22\n\nAfter a glowing 2023 with viral hit \"Water,\" South African newcomer Tyla started 2024 with a blast. Last month, she became the first person to win a GRAMMY for Best African Music Performance, and the youngest-ever African singer to win a GRAMMY Award at 22 years old.\n\nNext month is poised to be even better: Tyla’s eponymous debut LP drops on March 22, featuring \"Water\" and other hits like \"Truth or Dare,\" \"Butterflies\" and \"On and On,\" as well as a guest appearance by labelmate Travis Scott.\n\n\"African music is going global and I’m so blessed to be one of the artists pushing the culture,\" Tyla shared on Instagram. Her unique blend of amapiano, pop and R&B is making waves around the world, and the star will rightfully celebrate by touring Europe and North America throughout this spring.\n\nShakira - Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran\n\nRelease date: March 22\n\nThe title of Shakira’s new album, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, is a nod to her 2023 hit \"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\" with Argentine DJ Bizarrap. In the lyrics, she states that \"las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan\" — \"women don’t cry anymore, they make money.\"\n\nThe single is a diss to Shakira’s ex-partner, footballer Gerard Piqué, and, like the rest of the record, served as a healing experience after their separation. \"Making this body of work has been an alchemical process,\" the Colombian star said in a statement. \"While writing each song I was rebuilding myself. While singing them, my tears transformed into diamonds, and my vulnerability into strength.\"\n\nLas Mujeres will feature 16 songs, including her Bizarrap collaboration and singles \"Te Felicito\" with Rauw Alejandro, \"Copa Vacía\" with Manuel Turizo, \"Acróstico,\" \"Monotonía\" with Ozuna, \"El Jefe\" with Mexican band Fuerza Regida, and \"TQG\" with fellow Colombian Karol G.\n\nSheryl Crow - Evolution\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nBack in 2018, Sheryl Crow said that the LP Threads would be her last — fortunately, she changed her mind. \"I said I’d never make another record, though there was no point to it,\" the singer shared in a statement about her upcoming album, Evolution. \"This music comes from my soul. And I hope whoever hears this record can feel that.\"\n\nAccording to the same statement, \"Evolution is Sheryl Crow at her most authentically human self,\" and its music and lyrics \"came from sitting in the quiet and writing from a deep soul place.\"\n\nThe entire album was written in a month, starting with the title track, which expresses Crow’s anxieties about artificial intelligence and the future of humans. From then on, Crow and producer Mike Elizondo found bliss. \"The songs just kept flowing out of me, four songs turned into nine and it was pretty obvious this was an album,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to the album's title track, Crow also shared singles \"Do It Again\" and \"Alarm Clock.\"\n\nSum 41 - Heaven :x: Hell\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nAfter nearly three decades together, punk-metal mavericks Sum 41 are parting ways. Their final release will be a double album. Heaven :x: Hell, set to drop on March 29.\n\nHeaven is composed of 10 pop-punk tracks reminiscent of the band’s early years, while Hell is 10 tracks of pure heavy metal, reflecting the direction they took more recently. \"Once I heard the music, I was confident enough to say, ‘This is the record I’d like to go out on,'\" frontman Deryck Whibley said in a statement. \"We’ve made a double album of pop punk and metal, and it makes sense. It took a long time for us to pave this lane for ourselves, but we did, and it’s unique to us.\"\n\nThe band shared singles \"Landmines,\" \"Rise Up\" and \"Waiting on a Twist of Fate,\" and proved that they’re leaving on top of their game. \"I love Sum 41, what we’ve achieved, endured, and stuck together through, which is why I want to call it quits,\" Whibley added. \"It’s the right time to walk away from it. I’m putting all of my energy into what’s ahead.\"\n\nBut before embarking on new ventures, Sum 41 will spend the rest of the year touring throughout Asia, North America, and Europe.\n\nBlu DeTiger - All I Ever Want Is Everything\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nAt only 26 years old, Blu DeTiger has already toured with Caroline Polachek, played bass for Jack Antonoff’s band Bleachers, partnered with Fender, and appeared on the 2023 Forbes 30 Under 30’s music list.\n\nNow, she prepares to release her debut studio album, All I Ever Want Is Everything. \"This album is about growing and becoming, settling into yourself and learning to love where you’re at through it all. It’s about learning how to be your own best friend,\" the bassist and singer wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"Dangerous Game,\" the lead single off the album, showcases DeTiger’s effervescent energy and potential for pop stardom. Starting April, she will also headline a U.S. tour across Boston, Washington D.C., New York, Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nBeyoncé - Act II\n\nRelease date: March 29\n\nWhat better event to announce a new album than the most-watched TV program ever? That’s what Beyoncé did during Super Bowl LVIII, on Feb. 11. At the end of a Verizon commercial, the singer declared \"Okay, they ready. Drop the new music,\" while simultaneously releasing Act II’s lead singles, \"16 Carriages\" and \"Texas Hold 'Em,\" on social media and streaming platforms.\n\nComing out March 29, Act II is the second part of Beyoncé’s ongoing trilogy, which was written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic. The album is preceded by 2022’s acclaimed Act I: Renaissance, but instead of house and disco, the singer will reportedly take a deep dive into country music.\n\nThis isn’t Queen Bey’s first foray into the genre — in 2016, she released Lemonade’s \"Daddy Lessons,\" and her 2021 IVY PARK Rodeo collection was inspired by \"the overlooked history of the American Black cowboy,\" as she told Harper’s Bazaar. It was just a question of time for Beyoncé to enter her country era, and it is finally upon us.\n\n17 Love Songs That Have Won GRAMMYs: \"I Will Always Love You,\" \"Drunk In Love\" & More"
