        "text": "Justin Timberlake is making music again with his longtime collaborator, Timbaland. Since their first collaboration from over 20 years ago, the duo will have new music coming soon for fans. The “Cry Me A River” producer, 51, told Variety that he and Timberlake, 42, have completed a new album together and that “everything sounds great.”\n\nHe told the publication, “Now it’s really on him how and when he envisions it to come out. But it’s done, and it’s coming.” Timbaland added that the sound of the new album will be like 2006’s FutureSex/LoveSounds. “It’s fun Justin,” he said. “But nothing too heavy, just giving you what you expect from us.”\n\nRELATED: Justin Timberlake Sells Entire Song Catalog To Hipgnosis\n\nAfter collaborating with each other for so long, Timbaland said, “Music is a young sport — of course, we’ve both seen a lot of life, but you have to bring out the 13-year-old kid again, you know? We had songs that maybe were too complicated, so we said we want it to feel like FutureSex part two, so we did songs that will fit that.”\n\nWorking On New Music For Years\n\nThe duo previously teased that they had been working on new material back in August of 2020. In an Instagram post at the time, Timbaland wrote, “FUTURE SEXY LOVESOUNDS pt [two]” on a photo of him and Timberlake performing. He followed that post up with a video of them sampling beats in the studio in December of 2021.\n\nTimbaland began his producing relationship with Justin on his 2002 debut album, Justified. He then worked on the musician’s next four albums as well, including the Grammy-winning FutureSex/LoveSounds for “Sexy Back” and “LoveStoned/I Think She Knows.” A few years later, the duo earned another Grammy with “Pusher Love Girl” from 2013’s The 20/20 Experience. The following year, another Timbaland-produced song won a Grammy — Jay-Z’s 2013 hit, “Holy Grail,” featuring Justin. Most recently, Timbaland produced JT’s 2018 album, Man of the Woods.\n\nJustin Timberlake’s 14 Greatest Music Videos Ranked\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
