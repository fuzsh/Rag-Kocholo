        "text": "We’re not even into the double-digits of January yet, and Justin Timberlake has officially taken 2018 by storm. After announcing his fifth studio album, Man of the Woods, last week and dropping the lead single “Filthy” on Friday, the singer unveiled a 25-city North American tour to promote the release of his upcoming LP — and fans are going crazy.\n\nWhile “Filthy” doesn’t exactly scream “outdoorsy,” Timberlake insists in a tour promo video that Man of the Woods was heavily inspired by nature. In turn, the tour “will be able to bring the outside in,” says Timberlake, making all who wish to attend eager to see what he has in store.\n\nAfter blowing fans away with the spectacle that was The 20/20 Experience Tour, Timberlake definitely won’t be letting fans down with his next trek. But with a new earthier vibe happening on his next album, there will likely be some new experiences for JT fans young and old. Billboard has put together a list of what we’d like to see the “SexyBack” singer bring to the stage next.\n\nAnother 30-song set\n\nThe 20/20 Experience Tour saw Timberlake perform essentially every song a JT fan would want to hear, but that’s because he had a set list of 30 songs. That may be a lot for a dad to take on, but we have faith Timberlake has the stamina to power through — especially now that he has five albums of material to incorporate.\n\nThe classics\n\nNo matter how long the set list is, the most important thing is that fans get to hear the hits. Sure, fans want to hear Man of the Woods tunes, but Timberlake can’t forget his Justified beginnings — including “Rock Your Body” and “Señorita” — as well as some of the FutureSex/LoveSound jams like “My Love” and “LoveStoned” still need some love in 2018. Oh, and Justin, we wouldn’t mind a little *NSYNC throwback in there…\n\nSome woodsy decor\n\nIf Timberlake’s going to say he’s bringing the outside in, we better see that. His stage setting on the last tour was nothing short of impressive, with “JT”-embossed mic stands and mind-blowing light screens. With so much outside inspiration, we’re envisioning trees and logs, perhaps some water (perfect for “Cry Me a River,” just saying) will be covering the stage, at least at some point.\n\nA mix of suits and flannel\n\nAs his half-and-half Man of the Woods album cover insinuates, Timberlake is going to be part “Suit & Tie,” part “Flannel” (there’s even a song titled the latter on the track list). Why not make the visuals that way too? We loved his dapper look on the 20/20 tour, but if there’s going to be so much outdoor influence, we wouldn’t mind seeing JT in a nice plaid too.\n\nMore surprise guests\n\nTimberlake brought out JAY-Z in Brooklyn and Garth Brooks in Nashville on the 20/20 Experience Tour, which was obviously huge for those lucky enough to see those appearances. And he loves collaborating on stage with Chris Stapleton, as he declared when he surprised his Pilgrimage Festival crowd with the country crooner in September. After JT served as one of Taylor Swift’s many superstar surprise guests on the 1989 Tour in 2015, maybe he’ll be inspired to do his own series of cameos?\n\nThe “Filthy” robot\n\nIf Timberlake can’t get his human friends to join him onstage during the tour, fans would likely be pretty stoked to see the futuristic robot that was the star of the “Filthy” video. Obviously we want to see Timberlake bust some serious moves, but to have a robot onstage to follow suit would be… well, filthy.\n\nA video montage of the Timberlake family\n\nIn the video teaser for the album, Timberlake said that both his wife and his son had a big impact on Man of the Woods. We’re thinking Justin will be leaving Jessica Biel and Silas Randall at home while he’s on the road, but we’d love to see Timberlake break out some home videos.\n\nMoving stage parts\n\nThose who saw the 20/20 Experience Tour will remember the epic platform he had during “Let the Groove In,” when the stage began to move and hover over the floor of the arena all the way to the back. Not only did it have fans wowed, but it allowed those further away to see JT’s swift moves from a closer (and cooler) view. That may be more cutting-edge than “earthy,” but we sure hope there’s something as awe-inspiring as that.\n\nA Memphis influence\n\nAlong with his family, Timberlake has cited where he’s from (Memphis, Tennessee) as a main influence on Man of the Woods. While we’re sure he’ll bring some Memphis flair to the stage between the setting and his soulful backing band the Tennessee Kids, it’d be cool to see some Memphis flavor too — maybe a little BBQ on the food menus, or a little blues before the show? We know Justin feels the hometown pride, and we want to feel it with him."
