        "text": "Justin Timberlake and *NSYNC seem to be reuniting once again, this time for JT’s upcoming album. Timberlake, 43, reunited with the boy band a few months ago for the Trolls Band Together soundtrack and the group didn’t say “Bye Bye Bye” for long after that. Taking to TikTok on Wednesday (February 28), the “What Goes Around… Comes Around” singer cheekily teased that he’s teaming up again with JC Chasez, Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, and Joey Fatone again. One fan told the singer-songwriter to: “Blink twice if *NSYNC is on a song called Paradise.”\n\nTimberlake’s response video featured him pulling down his sunglasses, slowing down and zooming in to show him blinking twice, before pushing them back up with one finger and smiling.” The fan originally left the comment on a previous video he posted on the social site that showed the artist holding copies of the deluxe vinyl edition of his new album, Everything I Thought It Was, which is set for release on March 15. In the original video, JT showed off everything that comes with the deluxe edition of his sixth studio album, including postcards, receipts, a film strip and an air freshener.\n\nOne fan commented on his teaser clip, “JUSTIN, PLEASE JUST GIVE US MILLENNIALS AN NSYNC REUNION TOUR.” Another said, “yes JT… give us a full blown *NSYNC reunion!!! [prayer hands emoji]” A third fan excitedly said, “Omg [blushed face emoji] I’m going to get all my posters back out and put them on my wall…husband can deal with it [running emoji].” One fan wrote, “CONFIRMEDDDD!!!! SCREAMING!!! Now beatbox if they will join you on stage. JK. But not really kidding.” One more person gushed, “We heard it from the man himself so we can officially CONTINUE to be overwhelmed with anticipation!”\n\nRELATED: Justin Timberlake and *NSYNC Discuss ‘It’s Gonna Be May’\n\nFans of Timberlake and his boy band origins have long-awaited a reunion. Timberlake has been teasing new music from *NSYNC since the beginning of this year. During an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show in January, he told the host they have been in the studio, “So there may be a little something in the future, too.” The appearance came months after *NSYNC reunited on the song “Better Place,” which was released in September as part of the Trolls sequel. As for how connected the former group members still are, Timberlake said it just “picks up right where it left off as far as the chemistry.”\n\nJustin Timberlake’s 14 Greatest Music Videos Ranked\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
