        "text": "Justin Timberlake is bringing \"Sexyback\" … and not for the first time.\n\nApparently, the Grammy-winning singer \"Can't Stop the Feeling\" for his Columbus fans, since his Oct. 23 concert at Nationwide Arena will be at least his 10th time performing here in the past 25 years.\n\nTimberlake has crooned, gyrated, popped and locked at Nationwide so frequently — the upcoming show will be No. 4 — that he'd be well within his rights to call the venue his old stomping grounds.\n\nFrom his earliest appearances with chart-topping boy band *NSYNC to more recent shows as a successful solo artist, here is a rundown of some times that Timberlake has visited Columbus:\n\nTimberlake as a solo act\n\n▪ March 31, 2019, Nationwide Arena\n\n▪ May 7, 2018, Nationwide Arena\n\nA Dispatch reviewer deemed Timberlake \"a colorful force who more than proved his right to remain an A-list pop star more than 20 years after getting his start in boy band *NSYNC.\"\n\n▪ Nov. 16, 2013, Nationwide Arena\n\nOur review was accompanied by a photo with the caption, \"Justin Timberlake showed he knew how to make an audience, especially one filled with women, his for the night.\"\n\n▪ Feb. 19, 2007, Schottenstein Center (Value City Arena)\n\n▪ Aug. 3, 2003, Schottenstein Center\n\nOur recap of Timberlake's concert with opener Christina Aguilera referenced the pair's beginnings on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\": \"One of the former Mouseketeers who performed Sunday night … has found a comfortable musical niche; the other is still frantically trying out possibilities. Justin Timberlake doesn't have as strong a voice as Christina Aguilera, but he's found a way to position his particular talents.\"\n\nJustin Timberlake with *NSYNC\n\n▪ Aug. 20, 2001, Historic Crew Stadium\n\n▪ April 23, 2002, Nationwide Arena\n\n▪ June 27, 2000, Schottenstein Center\n\nUnfortunately, the five-man band's sold-out 2000 appearance (when Timberlake was 19) left our reviewer underwhelmed: \"The production was more like an ESPN cheerleading competition than a concert. And when (*NSYNC) added scripted skits, the production became like a second-rate Ice Capades. The only thing missing was Snuffleupagus on skates.\"\n\n▪ July 29, 1999, Polaris Amphitheater\n\nIf you missed any of his past performances (or you weren't born yet) and you're dying for Timberlake to \"Rock Your Body\" live, you don't have to say \"Bye, Bye, Bye\" to your dream. Tickets to his October concert are just a few clicks away!\n\nCiti cardmembers can buy presale tickets until 5 p.m. Thursday at citientertainment.com and Verizon is offering presale access until 5 p.m. Thursday through Verizon Up at verizon.com/featured/verizon-up. General admission sales begin at 10 a.m. Friday at justintimberlake.com."
