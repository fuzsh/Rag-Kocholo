        "text": "\"Do Your Thing\"\n\nBT Earns 'King Of Dirty Pop' Title With 'NSYNC, Britney Tracks\n\n6.23.01 l source: mtv] So far in BT's remarkable six-year career, he's spearheaded the popular genre known as trance, revolutionized film scores and brought Tori Amos into clubs. But he will probably forever be remembered as the inventor of \"dirty pop.\"\n\nOver the past few months, Maryland-bred Brian Transeau has brought gritty beats and broken vocals into the glossy worlds of 'NSYNC and Britney Spears. BT produced the Orlando, Florida, fivesome's latest hit single, \"Pop,\" and recorded two tracks for the pop princess' upcoming album  one of which he described as \"insane.\"\n\nHow did this happen? Let's just say it wasn't an idea some record company executive had in a boardroom one day.\n\n\"Believe me, I thought about 'NSYNC what a lot of people that aren't 14 years old and female think about 'NSYNC,\" BT explained. \"Not that I hated them, it was ambivalence. I just didn't care.\"\n\nThen 'NSYNC's JC Chasez started popping up at BT's shows last fall. Soon the two were talking and eventually hanging out with each other's friends and girlfriends, including Justin Timberlake and Spears.\n\n\"They're so cool and levelheaded,\" BT said. \"I know people that are extras in films that have more attitude than them.\"\n\nThen he heard his new friends sing.\n\n\"I thought, 'Hang on a second. These guys may be a groomed, commercialized thing, but they are really talented,'\" BT explained.\n\nStill, he was hesitant.\n\n\"JC was saying we should do a track. I said, 'I like you guys a lot, but it's probably not right for either one of us.' I thought it would freak out everybody. One night, Justin called me up and said, 'Dude, you've said no to this sh-- a bunch of times, but I want to do a track with you like 'Hip Hop Phenomenon,' which is on the U.K. version of my record. It's a crazy underground new-school breakbeat track. [He said,] 'You can do whatever the hell you want to our vocals. Anything.'\"\n\nSo, BT took him up on the offer, and he did whatever the hell he wanted. He spent two weeks working on their vocals, trying 40 different treatments, using special equipment usually reserved for movie sound effects.\n\nThe result is the dirtiest pop this side of the Dirty South. BT took Timberlake's vocals to hell and back and still found a finished product the kids can groove to. \"Pop\" is \"Beat It\" on ecstasy, and that wasn't an accident.\n\n\"I was totally going for the Michael Jackson,\" BT said. \"When Justin was singing in the studio, I kept shouting, 'Michael!' at him.\"\n\nTimberlake's girlfriend was so moved by the 29-year-old classically trained producer's work, she had to have a taste for herself. She spent a few days in BT's home studio last week recording two tracks, an untitled dance number and the groundbreaking \"Before the Goodbye.\"\n\n\"It goes back and forth from sounding like new-school R&B, Timbaland-style beats, to progressive house,\" BT said of the tune. \"Everyone we've played it for is like, 'This is so crazy that it might just be amazing.'\"\n\nBT, who released his first single on Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto label in 1995, has ventured into the pop world in the past only as a remixer, taking on tracks by Madonna, Sarah McLachlan and Seal. His remix of Amos' \"Blue Skies\" in 1996 was a worldwide club smash.\n\nHe's also scored movies, first with \"Go\" in 1999, followed by \"Under Suspicion,\" \"Driven\" and \"The Fast and the Furious,\" which opens Friday (June 22).\n\nMovement in Still Life, BT's third album, was released a year ago and melds together a smorgasbord of genres with appearances by former Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty, Sasha, Paul van Dyk and DJ Rap.\n\nNSYNC FLIP FLOPS!\n\n[6.17.01 l source: Jens_Nsync_Pix] Pink 'N Sync flip-flops, with secret compartments in the soles, can be bought for $12.99 at Kohl's.\n\nNSYNC SINGING AT SOFTBALL GAME\n\n[6.17.01 l source: Jens_Nsync_Pix] 'NSync will sing the national anthem at the Jayson Williams Celebrity Softball Challenge on July 29 at Riverfront Stadium in Newark. The event will be held in conjunction with the Newark Bears baseball team. Proceeds will benefit the Jayson Williams Foundation.

The performing artists, along with the DIXIE CHICKS, CARL THOMAS and others are part of the Candies Foundation's public service campaign that will run this fall in fashion and entertainment magazines.\n\nThe \"*NSYNC Fan Bus\" Wants to See You!\n\n[5.26.01 l source: NSYNCstudio.com Report] Maybe you've heard about it. Maybe you even saw them win big on The Price Is Right - heck, maybe you've even visited thier website, nsyncfanbus.com\n\nJust imagine, winning a $70,000 motorhome and then touring around the country going to every *NSYNC show on the PopOdessey tour! How cool is that? Well, Winter, age 22 and Meredith, 21, want you to come see what it's like on their motorhome! They have a huge RV with *NSYNC pictures and logo's blaring across the sides.

Take a tour of their motorhome, ask what it's like to be interviewed on the radio, how the concerts were, etc. Just have a great time :) Winter & Meredith are super-sweet girls and want to get all the fans involved with the *NSYNC Fan Bus!\n\nAll you Hershey fans at tomorrow's show, go search for the RV (it's so huge, it's not that hard to miss!) And Foxboro attendees, we're gonna have a big par-tay (I'll be there!) So hop on and say hi! Visit the *NSYNC Fan Bus website @ nsyncfanbus.com\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Florida\n\n[5.26.01] 'NSYNC have found themselves in a pickle. The group's forthcoming album, Celebrity, has been shelved until mid summer. The Backstreet Boys' most recent record, a bellwether for Celebrity if ever there was one, wasn't quite the huge success the Boys' previous two were, causing some observers to even decree teen pop dead. And come to think of it, no one in 'NSYNC is even a teen any more.\n\nWhat's a boy band to do? Well, creating the largest musical production in concert history is one solution. The PopOdyssey Tour began Wednesday in Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium with a video montage chronicling the history of 'NSYNC to date: here's how they met, here's how they started, here's how they sued for control of their careers and here's how they became celebrities. After the video, the five song-and-dance superstars emerged from a translucent pod at the center of the stadium. From there they pranced down a catwalk and ascended their stage, a metallic fortress replete with video screens, conveyor belts and elevators. They opened with \"Pop,\" the first single from Celebrity. It's the latest in a long line of 'NSYNC rave-ups, noteworthy for a couple of reasons. Fans call the song \"Dirty Pop,\" in reference to the much-repeated refrain. Thing is, it's no dirtier than many of the old, vaguely suggestive 'NSYNC songs. By keeping the word \"dirty\" out of the title, the song stays parent-friendly, but by keeping the word \"dirty\" in the lyrics, it makes the group seem edgier. A nice example of having it both ways. \"Pop\" also represents Justin Timberlake's unofficial ascension to group leader. In addition to singing all the verses, he remained the focal point for 'NSYNC's high-concept dance choreography throughout the song. Come to think of it, he was center-stage throughout just about every song. He's always been a fan favorite, but it looks like his bandmates are finally giving him a larger share of the spotlight.\n\nAfter \"Pop\" came a brisk spin through \"Tearin' Up My Heart,\" and soon after that member Lance Bass addressed the crowd. \"Tonight is very special for us,\" he said, \"because you're going to get to hear most of our upcoming album, Celebrity, before anyone else in the world.\" And with that, they dove into ... \"God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You,\" from their 1998 debut album. Later in the show the band actually did reveal some of Celebrity, to the shrill delight of the young female audience. The songs tend to borrow from the accessible end of electronica, co-opting the basic principles of two-step or drum and bass, then sanitizing them and making them a little more pop-friendly. They're certainly catchy  this is 'NSYNC we're talking about  and the audience loved them, a good sign for the folks back at Jive.\n\nThe show featured a number of costume changes, presumably intended to represent the different faces of celebrity. The band became everything from Prohibition-era dandies to cowboys in matching chaps. During \"Space Cowboy (Yippie-Yi-Yay),\" the guys rode five silver mechanical bulls, which lovingly bucked them as they waved their arms above their heads. Afterward, it was hard to tell whether member Chris Kirkpatrick was kidding when he ripped off his chaps and said, \"These are the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in my life.\" Every so often, another video would roll. Once it was a silent film parody, another time it was JC fighting with his gold-digging girlfriend. And at various points fireworks exploded, smoke poured, lasers flashed and 'NSYNC glided across the stadium on a rip cord.\n\nPart commentary on fame, part multimedia indulgence, the concert certainly proved 'NSYNC's resolve. They're not ready to quit, and they're determined to turn their third record into a hit. By the time the tour is over, we'll know if they succeeded. Nick Marino\n\n'NSYNC Tour Secrets: Multiple Stages, Red Carpet\n\n[5.24.01 l source: Sweet_Nsync_Pix] 'NSYNC fans had to wait an extra five days for the PopOdyssey tour to kick off Wednesday, and the group promises to make it worthwhile with an elaborate stage setup and the chance for audience members to join the band onstage.\n\nIn addition to a five-story-high main stage, several smaller stages will be set up throughout each venue. There won't be a bad seat in the house, according to an 'NSYNC publicist. Originally set to begin May 12 in Miami, opening night was pushed back to May 18 and then to May 23 in Jacksonville, Florida (see \"'NSYNC Push Back Tour, Album Release\"). Calling it one of the biggest pop tours ever mounted, the publicist said that a total of 88 trucks would be transporting two separate, complete concert setups from town to town. While 'NSYNC is playing in one city, a crew will already be setting up in the next city. The group's 2000 tour only needed 19 trucks, the publicist added. At the shows, 'NSYNC will treat fans to songs from its upcoming album, Celebrity, due July 24. During the title song, 20 randomly selected fans will join the group onstage to take pictures as the guys walk down a red carpet.\n\nSouvenir stands will be selling 'NSYNC single-use cameras, and the group will ask audience members to shoot away during \"Celebrity,\" with the hope that thousands of flashes will create a \"paparazzi\" effect. One dollar from each camera sold will go to 'NSYNC's Challenge for the Children Foundation, which raises money for kids' programs and other charities throughout the United States.\n\nDuring their shows, the group will also run a public service announcement for the Office of National Drug Control Policy featuring the group members talking about their \"anti-drugs,\" the people and things they see as healthy, creative alternatives to drugs.\n\nAfter postponing the tour launch twice and canceling a May 30 show in Foxboro, Massachusetts, because crews wouldn't have enough time to set up the stages, the group suffered a scare at rehearsals in New Orleans last week when Joey Fatone suffered a cut on his leg after misjudging a trapdoor opening. The injury was minor, however, and Fatone rejoined the group for recording sessions in Los Angeles over the weekend, the publicist said.\n\nPop!!\n\n[5.17.01] NSYNC's first single off of their new up-coming album, Celebrity, is now in stores!! The single will probably only be released overseas (Europe to us americano's) as to not take away from album sales. so..turn on that radio, full blast!!!!!! :)\n\n'N Sync Go POP\n\n[5.17.01 l source: Rolling Stone] While 'N Sync's third album, Celebrity, won't be released until July 24th (long after their tour is underway), fans can get a taste of the first single tomorrow. MTV will preview the song \"Pop\" during Total Request Live, five days before it hits airwaves officially, and on May 28th the network will premiere the video. \"Pop\" was co-written and co-produced by Justin Timberlake and Wade Robson. JC Chasez also has songwriting and producing credits on several Celebrity tracks. And, true to its title, the album is loaded with big-name producers, from Rodney Jerkins (Michael Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, Backstreet Boys) to the Neptunes (Mystikal, No Doubt, Ol' Dirty Bastard). R&B crooner Brian McKnight makes a guest appearance on the record. 'N Sync's summer tour kicks off on May 23rd in Jacksonville, Florida, and winds down August 24th in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n*NSYNC Celebrity in Stores: July 24\n\n'Pop' Shipping to Radio: May 15\n\n[5.12.01 l source: Sweet_Nsync_Pix] NEW YORK (ENTERTAINMENT WIRE) - On July 24 Jive Recording artist *NSYNC will release Celebrity the follow up to their Diamond certified Jive debut album No Strings Attached. The first single \"Pop\" will be available via satellite on May 15 at 7:00 PM ET via the DG system. On May 28 MTV's Making The Video will debut the video.\n\n\"Pop\" was co-written by Justin Timberlake and Wade Robson and co-produced by BT, Justin Timberlake and Wade Robson.\n\nCelebrity has tracks written and/or produced by Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Max Martin, Rodney Jerkins, The Neptunes, Brian McKnight and Wade Robson.\n\n*NSYNC will perform \"Pop\" on:\n\nThe Rosie O'Donnell Show (6/5)\n\nThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno, (7/23)\n\nThe Today Show (8/20).\n\nIn addition, MTV will preview \"Pop,\" on TRL (5/10) and MTV will air an *NSYNC weekend on July 21 and 22.\n\nThe group consists of Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick, and Justin Timberlake.\n\n*Nsync scheduled to perfom at Charity Concert\n\n[5.7.01 l source: MuchMusic] Destiny's Child, *NSYNC, 98 Degrees, and Macy Gray and several more soon-to-be announced acts will perform live in concert to benefit the Candies Foundation on June 5 at New York's Roseland Ballroom. The goal of the concert, which will be hosted by actress and Candies spokesperson Jenny McCarthy, is to raise $500,000 for the new charitable organization.\n\nDestiny's Child took time off from its busy schedule to appear at the launch of the Candies Foundation at West Side High School in New York City yesterday (May 2), just one day after the group's album Survivor hit store shelves nationwide. McCarthy joined the trio to announce the foundation, which aims to educate teenagers about the consequences of teen pregnancy via a massive public-awareness initiative.\n\nDestiny's Child singer Beyonce Knowles spoke candidly with LAUNCH about why the group decided to tackle the issue of teen pregnancy. \"I know we're looked up to as role models, and as much as we can help, we're here,\" she said. \"It's very disappointing that four out of 10 young ladies get pregnant before the age of 20, and I know that people don't know sometimes. You feel like you're pressured to have sex, and sometimes you're pressured to have unprotected sex by guys. And women just really should respect themselves and love themselves, and if we can get them to love themselves, then we're here to do that.\"\n\nThe public-awareness initiative will include print ads featuring photos of Destiny's Child, *NSYNC, 98 Degrees, Macy Gray, and McCarthy in entertainment and lifestyle magazines. The ads will contain a positive message targeted at teens followed by compelling statistics about teen pregnancy. The ultimate goal of the organization is to reduce the high rate of teen pregnancy in the United States. Destiny's Child's Michelle Williams took to the podium in the high school's gymnasium and addressed the West Side High School students directly: \"I'm not saying that you can't be a 'survivor' having a child because we've seen some people who have made it, but you don't want that to slow you down,\" she said. \"You don't want to have unprotected sex because there's AIDS out there, first of all. There's so many STD's that are out there without a cure, so we just wanted to be here today to educate you about the risk of teenage pregnancy.\"\n\nTickets for the June 5 concert event are priced at three levels: $300 for the full concert, $500 for the pre-party and the concert, and $1,000 for the pre-party, concert, and post-concert party at Studio 54. Additional information regarding concert-ticket packages will be made available shortly at the Candies Foundation's official website, candiesfoundation.org.\n\nCelebrity\n\n[5.7.01 l source: MuchMusic]Celebrity was due out on June 26, but it has now been pushed back until July 24th. Meanwhile, *NSYNC's first single entitled \"Pop\" is scheduled to be released to radio in mid-May, followed by a cd single release in mid-June. The guys have also promised to preview the album on their PopOdyssey tour, which kicks off May 18th in Jacksonville, FL.\n\n'NSYNC embrace the of-the-moment dance sound of England's two-step/U.K. garage movement on \"Pop.\" Listen to a clip on http://www.jiverecords.com. Dance producer BT, who has remixed songs for Madonna, Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan and Seal, worked with 'NSYNC on the song, EW reported in its latest issue. \"We took it to where we think music is going,\" Justin Timberlake, who co-wrote the song, told the magazine. \"It's more futuristic. It's like R&B twice as fast.\"\n\nCelebrity will also include the ballad \"Gone\" and the potential single \"Game Over.\" Rodney Jerkins produced the title track, while R&B crooner Brian McKnight produced a track called \"Selfish.\"\n\nMay 14th New Single To Be Released\n\n[5.06.01 l source: nsync.com] \"The working title of NSYNC's upcoming album is \"Celebrity\" - look for it in stores this summer! The first single is \"Pop\" - be sure to listen for it on your local radio station beginning May 14th! We're planning some extra cool stuff for \"Celebrity,\" so keep checking back right here for updates!\n\nN The Works\n\n[5.6.01 l source: Entertainment Weekly] Remember when electronica was about to be the next big thing...then wasn't? It may still take over if teen girls have any say. \"Pop,\" the probable first single from 'N Sync's July album, \"Celebrity,\" finds producer BT adopting England's trendy \"two step\" sound.\n\n\"We took it to where we think music is going,\" says cowriter Justin Timberlake. \"It's more futuristic. It's like R&B twice as fast. It's like house - dance meets R&B...\"\n\n\"It's like the Artful Dodger making out with Aretha Franklin,\" kids Chris Kirkpatrick.\n\n\"Pop\" could almost be mistaken for the next Michael Jackson single, if he goes electronica. And Jacko is paying attention to 'N Sync: He heard \"Gone\" (cowritten by Timberlake) and asked if they'd donate it to his long delayed disc instead of \"Celebrity,\" but was turned down.\n\n\"It's probably my favorite ballad I've ever heard,\" boasts Lance Bass. Other completed tunes include the Rodney Jerkins helmed title track; \"Selfish,\" produced by Brian McKnight; and \"Game Over,\" which may be the first single if the group thinks radio is too pooped to keep up with \"Pop.\"\n\nNo 'Grease' For 'NSYNC, Bass And Fatone Pursue Movies On Own\n\n[5.03.01 l source: mtv] Sometimes even the world's biggest boy band can't get what it wants.\n\nThe members of 'NSYNC traveled to the Cannes Film Festival last May to announce  with maximum fanfare  that they planned to film a movie together. In October, the group's Lance Bass revealed that the movie in question would \"most likely\" be \"Grease 3.\"\n\nAnd in fact, the group had been working on a potential \"Grease\" sequel with the California production company Total Film Group, according to sources close to the project.\n\nBut 'NSYNC's substantial clout has so far not been enough to obtain the rights to the \"Grease\" name and characters, the sources said, and the movie has been shelved.\n\nTotal Film Group is working to come up with another potential project to present to the 'NSYNCers, and continues to try to rescue \"Grease.\"\n\nBut the time for a full-fledged 'NSYNC movie, with all five members, may have passed, according to Lance Bass.\n\nInstead of a group movie, a la the Beatles' beloved \"A Hard Day's Night\" or the Spice Girls' ill-fated \"Spice World,\" Bass and fellow group member Joey Fatone have chosen to make their movie debuts without the rest of 'NSYNC.\n\nBass will star and Fatone will appear in \"On the Line\" (originally called \"On the L\"), a romantic comedy due this September or October.\n\n\"I think if you had all five guys of 'NSYNC, people really wouldn't take the movie seriously,\" Bass said recently from the film's set \"This way, there's a couple of us in it, and it's a real movie. It really stands up on its own.\"\n\nThe movie stars Bass as a fresh-from-college 20-something who works in an advertising agency. He meets the \"woman of his dreams\" on Chicago's \"L\" train, but she leaves without giving him her name and number. Bass' character spends the rest of the movie trying to track the woman down.\n\nBass and Fatone may contribute new music to the soundtrack, but no plans have been confirmed, according to a publicist for the movie, which is the first film project from Bass' A Happy Place Productions.\n\n\"This is definitely a huge risk for me,\" Bass said. \"The thing is, my first job is music... If this doesn't work for me, it's not going to break me. Coming out [with] my first movie, [in] the lead role... it's very insane. But you know, people are going to look at this and [know that] I'm doing this for my fans. The fans are going to love it.\"\n\nFatone also filmed a supporting role last September in an upcoming independent movie, \"The Bros.,\" playing the victim of a crime spree.\n\nThe movie  which is expected to include cameos from rappers Ludacris and Vanilla Ice  is scheduled to be completed by summer. The filmmakers are searching for a distributor, according to writer/director Jonathan Figg.\n\n\"Joey was excellent. He was a real pro. It's a real coup for us [and] he was very excited about doing something a little grittier and edgier,\" Figg said from his Orlando, Florida, production office. \"There's a possibility that Joey might contribute to the soundtrack either by doing a track himself or providing us with an artist he's bringing up.\"\n\nThe movie, which was called \"The Brothers\" until Sony Pictures put another movie by that title on their lineup, is a dark comedy about a pair of suburban kids who are obsessed with hip-hop.\n\nAlso last year, Fatone filmed a small role in another independent film, the comedy \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" which is slated for release sometime this year.\n\nDespite unending rumors to the contrary, no other 'NSYNC-related movie projects appear to be anywhere near hitting theaters.\n\nMore on Baby Fatone\n\n[4.29.01 l source: Nsync_NSA] According to reports, the *NSYNC member is a new father. Joey's girlfriend, Kelly Baldwin, gave birth to a baby girl named Brianna on an unreported date. Calls to *NSYNC's reps were not returned by press time. Over the past nine months, Joey has remained tight-lipped about the pregnancy. \"It's a personal thing that I just want to keep personal,\" he told the Orlando Sentinel in February. \"When the timing is right, I'll let everyone know.\" Guests at a baby shower held at Orlando's Hard Rock Café in February included bandmates Lance Bass and Chris Kirkpatrick. Judging from gift registries at JC Penny and Babies \"R\" Us -- under the name Kelly Baldwin of Orlando, Fla. -- the shower attendees didn't have to dig very dip into their pockets to buy the baby's presents. Among the items the couple requested:\n\nA pair of terry cloth changing pad covers ($25)\n\nA lavender crochet dress with matching shoes and hat ($16.99)\n\nComfy Bear Bath Cushion ($3.99)\n\nBaby wipe refills ($2.99 each)\n\nLance & Joey film to have 2 nsync tracks on!\n\n[4.29.01 l source: Nsync_NSA] *NSYNC boys Joey Fatone and Lance Bass have almost wrapped up filming on their movie, On The L. The pair recently jetted from Toronto, Canada to Chicago to shoot the final scenes and producers are expected to set the US release date for this September.\n\nIn the movie, Lance plays a guy who falls in love with a beautiful stranger, Emanuelle Chriqui, on a train, and spends the rest of the film trying to find her with the help of his friend, played by Fatone.\n\nDuring interviews on set it was clear the boys didn't take their newfound roles too seriously with Lance confessing that he was not the best actor but he was having a good time nonetheless!\n\nHe went on to reveal that the soundtrack will feature at least two *NSYNC tracks and hinted at the possibility of the whole band making an appearance in the movie.\n\nFatone and Bass are not the first pop stars to test the movie star water. They follow in the footsteps of a host of chart toppers including Mark Wahlberg, Toni Braxton, LL Cool J, Kid Rock, Mariah Carey and most recently the Princess of Pop herself, Britney Spears.\n\nTIPY still on the charts\n\n[4.29.01 l source: Nsync_NSA] Weekly charts for the nation's recorded music as they appear in the April 28, 2001 issue of Billboard magazine.\n\n(Compiled from a national sample of airplay supplied by Broadcast Data Systems)\n\n1. ``I Hope You Dance,'' Lee Ann Womack With Sons Of The Desert.
