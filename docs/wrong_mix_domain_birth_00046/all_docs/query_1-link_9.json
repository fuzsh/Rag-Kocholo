        "text": "(born 1981). American singer, songwriter, actor, and producer Justin Timberlake was part of the teen pop revival of the 1990s and 2000s. He was a member of the hugely successful “boy band” *NSYNC before beginning his solo music career.\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee. He launched his performing career in the late 1980s on the Disney Channel’s The New Mickey Mouse Club alongside future recording stars Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and J.C. Chasez. In 1996 Timberlake and Chasez were asked to join the male pop vocal quintet *NSYNC. Sales for the group’s self-titled debut, released in 1998, started slowly but then did extremely well. Their second effort, No Strings Attached (2000), became one of the fastest-selling albums in history. Timberlake began his solo recording career in 2001 after the release of *NSYNC’s third album.\n\nDuring his time with *NSYNC, Timberlake cultivated his role as a songwriter. His breakup with Spears, with whom he had had a relationship, provided the inspiration for a number of songs on his solo debut, Justified (2002). For this effort he won Grammy Awards for best pop vocal album and for best male pop vocal performance for the song “Cry Me a River.” In 2003 Timberlake was a guest performer on the Black Eyed Peas’s hit “Where Is the Love?” He became mired in controversy when, during the halftime performance of the 2004 Super Bowl, he pulled off part of co-performer Janet Jackson’s top. His second solo release, the Prince-influenced FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), featured production work by Timbaland and Rick Rubin and earned four Grammy Awards, including best dance recording for “Sexy Back.”\n\nAn actor as well as a singer, Timberlake appeared on the television show Saturday Night Live, where his music video parodies became popular hits on the Internet. His first substantial film roles came in Alpha Dog (2006) and Black Snake Moan (2007). In 2010 he portrayed Internet entrepreneur Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook, in the film The Social Network, a fictionalized account of Facebook’s origins. The same year, he provided the voice of Yogi Bear’s diminutive sidekick Boo Boo in Yogi Bear, a movie adaptation of the classic TV cartoon. Timberlake subsequently starred in the racy romantic comedy Friends with Benefits (2011), the sci-fi thriller In Time (2011), and the online-gambling drama Runner Runner (2013). In addition, he took supporting roles in Bad Teacher (2011), Trouble with the Curve (2012), and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013). For the animated film Trolls (2016), Timberlake provided the voice of one of the title characters and cowrote the Oscar-nominated song “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” In Wonder Wheel (2017) he portrayed a lifeguard on Coney Island during the 1950s who wants to become a playwright.\n\nIn 2013 Timberlake mounted a musical comeback with The 20/20 Experience, a pair of song suites that were recorded in collaboration with Timbaland and released six months apart. Boasting both contemporary electronic production and old-fashioned rhythm and blues, The 20/20 Experience found Timberlake sounding relaxed and romantic, particularly on singles such as “Mirrors.” The song “Suit & Tie,” which featured Jay-Z, won a Grammy Award for best music video, while the song “Pusher Love Girl” won for best R&B song. Also in 2013 Timberlake was featured on Jay-Z’s song “Holy Grail,” which won a Grammy Award for best rap collaboration."
