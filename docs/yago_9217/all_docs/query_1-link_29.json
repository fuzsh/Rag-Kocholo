        "text": "Maria Mercedes Carreño Nava, known publicly as “Meche Carreño”, was born in Minatitlan Veracruz on September 15, 1947. She was the last daughter of Malaquías Nava and Daniel Carreño. She had two sisters, Bella Newton Nava and Digna Cruz Nava, and a brother Felix Cruz Nava. During her youth Mercedes and her family moved to Mexico City, were they lived in poverty. In the hard city of Mexico, her mother and her sister Digna scrape together enough money to send Mercedes to the “Andres Soler Academy for Dramatic Arts”. Mercedes excels in acting and participates in several theater productions, including one with Alejandro Jodorowsky.\n\nDuring this time Mercedes was also a model and she becomes the first Mexican woman to be photographed in public wearing the scant “monoquini” bathing suit. These images make Mercedes instantly famous as “The Monoquini Girl”. Because of this, the photographer Jose Lorenzo Zakany Almada hires her as a model for his photographs. In 1967 Mercedes and Zakany marry and the have one son, Jose Zakany Carreño. Mercedes working with her brother Felix Cruz Nava write a film script. Jose Zakany produces this script with his own money, into the successful movie “Damiana y los Hombres” 1967. Following the success of their first movie, Mercedes and Zakany Produce “Andante” 1969, “La Sangre Enemiga” 1971, and “La Inocente” 1972. Soon after Mercedes and Zakany divorce. In 1973 the prestigious Mexican director Emilio Fernandez, casts Mercedes to work on his award winning film “La Choca”. This becomes on of Mercedes’ great acting achievements and she wins an “Ariel Award” (equivalent of an Oscar in Mexico). Immediately after Mercedes is involved in other successful films such as “La Otra Virginidad” (1975), “El Mar” (1977), and “La Mujer Perfecta” (1979), directed by Juan Manuel Torres, with whom Mercedes has a second son Juan Maria Torres Carreño. Again Mercedes works with the director Emilio Fernandez in “Zona Roja” (1976).\n\nIn 1979, after the death of the director Juan Manuel Torres, Mercedes and her two sons move to New York city were she marries the American Stephen George. During this time Mercedes develops several film scripts and is heavily involved in educating her children. In 1981 she returns to Mexico to make the film “El Noa Noa” with famed singer Juan Gabriel.\n\nLater in the 2000’s she marries the French man Daniel Malfatti. In her last few years she travels extensively, writes, paints and is involved in humanitarian projects. On July 21, 2022 Mercedes passes away in Harlingen Texas after a two year battle with anemia and cancer. We know from testimonials of people that were with Mercedes during her last days, that a supernatural sense of peace and gratefulness descended upon her. Even though she knew that she would soon pass, she was confident of her reconciliation and intimacy with Jesus Christ.\n\nMercedes is survived by her husband Daniel Malfatti, her son Jose Zakany Carreño, her daughter in law Norma Zakany and her four grand children Diego Zakany, Joshuah Zakany, David Zakany, and Elisah Zakany."
