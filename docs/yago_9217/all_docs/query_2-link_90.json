        "text": "As I find myself in Italy, I would like to say that summer is over, but given the 28 degrees of heat, I am basking in the warm autumn sun writing about how summer is over without feeling that it is over; at least according to the atmospheric condition. Nevertheless, I am writing this post as a follow up to the Pulitzer winning piece of text I published at the beginning of the summer, where I had outlined my plans for the Summer. No fancy internships (🙅), just raw and smoked fish, and university. I have now completed that chapter in my life, and would like to sharer a few lessons I learnt during the summer: 1. Screaming ‘they don’t know me son’ at dead fish while trying to filet for an impatient customer will not impress anyone: employee of the month ! 2. In Finland people do eat fish other than salmon (and apparently there is a difference between Finnish salmon and Norwegian salmon). 3. If you have the ‘trainee’ tag on, customers will have mercy for you, even when you haven’t learn to filet or recognise different types of fish in 3 months of work (who’s gonna carry the boats?) 4. The Information Technology Program I (hope) completed this summer has been extremely eye opening: first, I have realised that digital marketing studies are something I like and would like to continue in the future. Shame I didnt know that before completing a degree in international relations, and starting a new one in Economics. MR=MC. I am happy that I have helped people pick the right fish to eat, stacked the shelves of the supermarket in a way that would’ve made anyone want to get lost in the meat and cheese section marvelling and the beautiful ‘facing’ of products provided by yours truly. I am also extremely grateful for the people that I worked with in ITP, for the amazing lecturers that made the 9am’s really worth it, and to my PlayStation, for staying by my side and voluntarily keeping me company at 2am while undecided whether I should play NHL15 or Fifa20. #takemeback As for what happens now, I will start writing a book about the primitive desire to be a part of the masses, and how that instinct has been exploited in social media marketing. I will call it ‘The MASSengers’. You make of it what you will Until next time, Let’s see where the buzz of life takes me #beeinsipred🤟🏼\n\nLife before NIL ⬇️ As we embrace the new era of NIL, I want to spread a positive message to student-athletes: It's okay if you don't want to dive headfirst into the endorsement aspect of NIL. ‼️ Before the era of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) in college athletics, I had the privilege of navigating the world of student-athlete life in a different landscape. Reflecting on my journey, I'm grateful for the opportunities and lessons learned along the way. 🏆 Accomplishments prior to NIL: • NCAA Division I athlete at NC State University • Earned multiple degrees in Business • Studied abroad in Paris, France for 4 months • Started a fashion brand • Joined a fraternity, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc. • Connected with luxury brands like Louis Vuitton Jo Malone, Chanel and Christian Dior • Received internship opportunities • Mentored to aspiring athletes and entrepreneurs • Then, became the Founder of Law of Athlete 🚀 (Some might say I've lived multiple lives beyond athletics! 😂) There are countless other ways to utilize your name, image, and likeness to carve out your path to success. Whether it's building your personal brand, pursuing entrepreneurial ventures, stepping into your career beyond athletics, or making a difference in your community, the opportunities are boundless. Embrace your uniqueness, leverage your platform, and remember that success comes in many forms. 💡 The journey is yours to define. - That’s Law Share this message with someone who needs to hear it 💌 #StudentAthlete #NIL #Empowerment #Motivation #LawofAthlete #Education\n\n𝙶𝚁𝙾𝚆𝚃𝙷, 𝙲𝙾𝙼𝙼𝙸𝚃𝙼𝙴𝙽𝚃, 𝙰𝙽𝙳 𝚃𝚁𝙰𝙹𝙴𝙲𝚃𝙾𝚁𝚈 The Forwardzone USA Office has been steadfastly advancing on three pivotal fronts as we approach the end of 2023.

As I review how these opportunities were sourced, 8 stemmed from direct emails to me from industry employers seeking talent, 6 were through TeamWork Online, 4 were through family/friends, 2 were through LinkedIn, 2 were through team websites, and the others didn't specify. That we have placed nearly 60 students in the last 2 summers across various sports industry internships and entry-level jobs is truly amazing, and makes me feel very lucky to play a mentorship role with such a talented and dynamic group of young people. 25 different companies...12 properties/teams, 9 agencies, 1 speedway, 1 tech company, and 2 \"others\". 8 companies we've placed students in the past, so 17 new companies we are engaging with this summer. And we have alumni connections at 8 of the 25 companies listed below. Connections, connections...and then more connections. That's the WashU way. The companies where WashU students will work this summer include DICK'S Sporting Goods (GameChanger program), Oak View Group, Milwaukee Bucks Inc., Wasserman, GSE Worldwide, SponsorUnited, TXV Partners, World Wide Technology Raceway, Philadelphia Eagles, Golden State Warriors, Paragon Marketing Group, Brooklyn Nets, WIT Sports, SportsManias, Elevate, Columbus Crew, Pittsburgh Penguins, York Rugby Club, Austin FC, Forward Madison FC, Milwaukee Brewers, Rank + Rally, Chicago Fire FC, Universal Music Group, Chicago Bears"
