        "text": "Lola Lolita is one of the most well-known stars on social media in our country. Her naturalness, charm, and boldness in front of the camera earn her thousands of followers every day. On her TikTok account alone, the woman from Alicante already has over 12.7 million followers, while on Instagram, she has 3.8 million fans.\n\nIn addition to using her social media profiles to work with different fashion, beauty, and other brands, the 22-year-old uses her Instagram and TikTok accounts to vent and share some parts of her daily life with her audience.\n\nNow that summer is here, Lola Lolita doesn't hesitate to show her followers some of the most striking details of the trips she takes with her family and friends: landscapes, activities, meals...\n\nThe influencer is currently in the Maldives, an ideal place for diving. As she mentioned three days ago, Lolita had the opportunity to swim alongside 150 manta rays, which she described as “a real dream”.\n\nHowever, that episode with such animals has come to nothing after the content creator uploaded a stunning video of her swimming among sharks with a calm and relaxed attitude.\n\nEven though she really enjoyed it, in the piece you can see how, unintentionally, she collided with a shark swimming peacefully above her head. “I wanted to leave this accident here as a memory that I never thought I would experience. We are all alright. We didn't see each other. Sorry from the heart and soul, truly,” the woman wrote as the title of the post.\n\nAn accident\n\nThe girl has explained in her Instagram stories that there were instructions not to touch the sharks, but that they did touch them with their fins. “It has been surreal. I was going up and looking ahead (...) He is fine, I am fine (...) I'm really sorry, it was unintentional. You have to have eyes everywhere,” she stated.\n\nThe post showing the moment when she encounters the shark has generated a plethora of comments: “Lola Lolita caught nodding off with a shark,” “It probably hurt you more than him for sure,” “You ran over a shark,” “What a hit, poor shark,” “Things that only happen to Lola,” “This is surreal,” etc."
