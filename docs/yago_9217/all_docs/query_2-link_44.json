        "text": "Description\n\nEmilio Fernandez 2017 – one of the most spectacular guitars as we finally got it – it reminds strongly of the Faustino Conde guitars from Conde’s golden age.\n\nEmilio Fernandez is a very remarkable guitar maker. He was still very young when he learned the art of guitar making in Faustino Conde’s workshop in 1970. After a short time, he was already building the master class guitars in the Conde workshop.\n\nHe remained loyal to Conde Hermanos even after Faustino Conde’s death and continued to work as workshop manager for Faustino Conde’s widow until 2013.\n\nIn 2013 he finally opened his own workshop in Madrid. There he builds wonderful and exclusively handmade guitars. His choice of materials is of very high quality and his workmanship is masterful!\n\nThis guitar has a spruce top with a straight and even grain over the entire surface. The sides and back are made of high-quality cypress.\n\nThe scale length is 662 mm and the nut width 52 mm.\n\nThe sound of this guitar is absolutely spectacular. The tone is of powerful quality and great resonance. It has a fullness in the basses and an impressive clarity and melody in the trebles. The quality of the volume and the personality of the guitar elevate this instrument to the top category of flamenco guitars.\n\nThe guitar is in very good condition. It shows signs of use and play but is free of cracks and repairs."
