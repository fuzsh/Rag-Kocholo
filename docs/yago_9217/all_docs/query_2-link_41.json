He has an amazing capacity to bring all his focus to bear on a problem, leveraging his intellect and strong pharma experience to rapidly identify solutions and opportunities, always prioritizing what is realistic over what would be perfect. I would work with him again in a heartbeat!”\n\n“Emilio was part of my team for three years while leading the Sandoz LatAm Regional Business Development team. He is one of the best and sharpest professionals I have worked with in my career, dedicated, hard working and always results-oriented. Emilio is able to quickly grasp and understand new business opportunities and willing to put the extra effort to identify and implement innovative solutions. At the same time, working and leading Emilio is a pleasure since he is eager to develop others and be developed on all aspects. An asset for any team that would be fortunate to have him.”"
