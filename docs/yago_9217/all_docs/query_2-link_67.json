        "text": "Emilio has not only proven that the Latin community at large is vital for the evolution of pop music, but he has been instrumental in breaking down barriers that limited its exposure and acceptance around the world. As a true visionary, Emilio has continually experimented and pushed the envelope of blending Latin, pop and world rhythms that have created a unique style and personality. This vision transcends the music field and spills over into film, television, hotels and restaurants, among other endeavors. After a quarter of a century producing music for some of the biggest and brightest stars in the music business, his superstar wife, Gloria as well as Shakira, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, Jon Secada, Alejandro Fernandez, Thalia, Carlos Vives, and Jennifer López, among many others. Emilio has also put his indelible vision in the television and movie industry. His main objective, as it always has been, is to shatter the stereotypes that have been a part of the Latin community for decades in film and TV. In 2008, Emilio produced and directed his first full-length documentary film, “90 Millas,” based on the pioneers and history of Cuban music. The film received critical accolades after premiering in the Tribecca Film Festival, Dubai Film Festival and the Miami International Film Festival.\n\n​\n\nWith the same passion and drive that Emilio has achieved in music, film & TV he has proven the same in the hospitality industry as well. In the early 90’s Emilio had the vision that Miami’s South Beach would become an international destination and purchased the Cardozo hotel on the world famous Ocean Drive. His Midas touch was immediate and visible with the success of Larios on the Beach (Miami Beach), Bongo’s Cuban Café (Downtown Disney at the Walt Disney Resort in Orlando, Fl, at the American Airlines Arena in Miami and at the Seminole Hard Rock & Casino in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida). Expanding his hospitality success north of Miami in Vero Beach Florida, the Estefans own and operate Costa d’ Este Beach Resort. His vision is making Vero Beach the next great tourist attraction. \"We are creating great opportunities for people to discover this beautiful paradise.”\n\nIn 2009, Emilio became the first Cuban-American to become a minority share-holder in an NFL franchise, joining the ownership of the Miami Dolphins.\n\nIn 2010, Emilio added the title of best-selling author to his long list of credits with the release of The Rhythm of Success - How an Immigrant Produced his own American Dream. It chronicles the story of his perseverance in succeeding both in his personal and professional life. From his humble roots as a Cuban refugee, to becoming one of the most successful businessmen in America, he shares his unconventional and pioneering career as a guide, to empower readers to establish for themselves the tools, ethics, values, and strategies necessary to unleash their own business potential. The following year he presented in collaboration with The Miami Herald. The Exile Experience: Journey to Freedom is a groundbreaking historical chronicle that tells the personal stories of those who fled the island and celebrates the accomplishments of the Cuban-American community. The book is published in three separate editions – each tailor-made for those who arrived through Operation Pedro Pan, the Freedom Flights and the Mariel boat lift. Each edition features the names of every Cuban who arrived in one of the three exoduses, more than 400,000 names between the three editions.\n\nFor a man who arrived in the United States from Cuba as a teenager during the 60s, he lived and faced the cultural and racial differences that have been a part of the Latino integration in the United States. In spite of the challenge, Emilio has not lost his sense of humor, humbleness, charisma and alchemist qualities. In order to blend two different cultures, they have to be respected and treated as complete and whole. That has been a very important ingredient to Emilio’s success. \"I can say, very respectfully, that I understand both the Latino and Anglo cultures. I know how they feel and what moves them and it is working in that gap that has enabled me to create my body of work.\"\n\nMusician, producer, creator, visionary, husband, father, friend and distinguished person of the community, Emilio Estefan symbolizes and embellishes the new Latino in the world.\n\n​\n\nFor Spanish, click here >\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​"
