Weatherford In 1940, American Pulitzer Prize–winning author and future Nobel laureate John Steinbeck met the still fairly unknown but soon-to-be iconic Mexican director Emilio “El Indio” Fernández. Although the details of that meeting are not well known, that first encounter would blossom into a productive transnational relationship that would mark the artistic careers of both men. Steinbeck was in Mexico to film the semi-documentary The Forgotten Village , but it was not his first time south of the Rio Grande.1 Indeed, Steinbeck, who was fluent in Spanish, had traveled through much of central Mexico and would continue to return to the country (especially to Mexico City, Puebla, Oaxaca, and Cuernavaca), often staying for weeks at a time (Bercini 2013, 73). The California-bred author was, of course, quite familiar with, and sympathetic to, the presence of Mexican and Mexican American laborers in his own community and he often included individuals of Hispanic descent in his fiction, giving his work what Charles L. Etheridge Jr. (2007) has called a “Mexican sensibility” (226). In 1940, however, Steinbeck was not looking simply to flavor his fiction with Hispanic characters; rather, he was attracted by the possibility of creating something that would be truly Mexican. As it turns out, Steinbeck’s encounter with Fernández would culminate in his writing the short novel, The Pearl in 1945. This novel was adapted by Fernández for the big screen, first in the Spanish as La perla, released in Mexico in 1947, and then in the English as The Pearl, released in the United States in 1948. These versions of the film cemented the American author’s place in Mexican film history and that of Mexico in his own artistic oeuvre. At the heart of Steinbeck’s fascination with his southern neighbor is a quartet of 70 · Douglas J. Weatherford texts that were created almost entirely in Mexico and that are set fully in that country: Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research (1941), The Forgotten Village (1941), The Pearl (1947), and Viva, Zapata! ([1952] 1993). Fernández’s direct participation in this grouping is limited to The Pearl, and I will return to that work at the end of this study. And yet, a comparison of the Mexican vision of Steinbeck and Fernández might be found just as productively in an examination of the semi-documentary film The Forgotten Village that the California native was working on when he met the future director of many of Mexico’s most cherished movies. That piece shares an important connection to Río Escondido [Hidden River] (1947), a featurelength film that Fernández directed a half-decade after The Forgotten Village and that became one of the most important additions to the so-called Golden Age of Mexican Film.2 Both Fernández in Río Escondido and Steinbeck in The Forgotten Village examine the national condition in the decades following the Mexican Revolution of 19103 and commend the central government ’s efforts to send assistance to the farthest corners to cure what they considered to be two of the nation’s lingering maladies: disease and ignorance . Along the way, both artists created didactic works whose reach—like that of the maestros rurales and médicos rurales [rural teachers and doctors] that they honor—is intended to extend far and wide.4 Indeed, Steinbeck and Fernández create what Marijane Osborn (2013) has called participatory parables in an effort to make an impact on the viewing public. This metacinematic instructional imperative is reflected in both works through the obsessive creation of on-screen learning environments where the moviegoing public on this side of the big screen observes another audience projected in black and white absorbing a lesson (be it about health or history) that each socially committed artist hoped would change lives on both sides of the so-called fourth wall. A lot has been said already about the presence of medicine and medical practitioners in Steinbeck and Fernández’s work.5 My research complements those earlier investigations by illuminating both individuals’ interest in the possibilities of art to influence national film audiences who might recognize themselves in the faces of on-screen learners. At the same time, I show that John Steinbeck, acclaimed chronicler of the North American experience in a healthcare-based cinematic endeavor, fits well within the..."
