DAVE WOLVERTON—aka, David Farland—was an award-winning, New York Times bestselling author with nearly fifty science fiction and fantasy novels to his credit, written for both adults and young adults. He won the Writers of the Future International Gold Award for best short story of the year, the Philip K. Dick Memorial Special Award for Best Novel in the English Language, the Whitney Award for Best Novel of the Year, and many other awards. His novels have been translated into more than twenty languages, and his readership runs into the millions. Over the years he worked with some of the largest franchises in the world—writing novels for Star Wars and The Mummy, and designing and scripting international bestselling videogames for StarCraft and Xena.

In addition to writing novels and video games, Dave worked for many years as the judge for one of the world’s largest writing contests, as an educator teaching creative writing at Brigham Young University, and taught numerous writing seminars, and thus trained dozens of other New York Times bestsellers, including Brandon Sanderon, Brandon Mull, Erick Flint, and Stephenie Meyer. He also worked as a movie producer in Hollywood, and as a screenwriter. In 1999 Dave set the Guinness Record for the world’s largest book signing with the science fiction novel A Very Strange Trip.
