David Wolverton, who was better known to some of his fans as Dave Farland, has passed away aged 64, after an accident in his own home. He suffered a fall down his stairs on the morning of January 13, 2022, and hit his head. He suffered a hemorrhagic stroke with bleeding around his brainstem which had left him comatose and on life support.

Hi son, Spencer, used the David Farland Entertainent official Facebook account to share the sad news.

John David Wolverton was born May 30, 1957 in Monroe, Oregon, USA. He started writing short stories in 1985, while at college. He quickly became an established award winning author who penned many novels, including Star Wars Legends books, The Courtship of Princess Leia, The Rising Force and The Hidden Past in the late 90’s.
