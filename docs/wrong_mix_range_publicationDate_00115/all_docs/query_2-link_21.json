A fusion of science fiction and mystery, the novel introduces the detective duo Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, who investigate a murder in a futuristic New York. Asimov reflected that the \"humaniform\" robot Daneel was \"possibly the most popular character in all my writings\" (p. 168). The work was originally serialized in Galaxy magazine the previous year. In 2004, it was nominated for a retrospective Hugo Award for Best Novel of 1954. Currey, p. 16; Locke, vol. I, p. 24. Octavo. Original blue boards, spine lettered in red, top edge red, fore edge untrimmed. With dust jacket. Extremities a little rubbed, superficial split to front inner hinge; spine lightly sunned, extremities lightly creased, closed tear to rear panel discreetly repaired with tape to verso, short split and tiny chips to rear flap fold, else bright and unclipped: a near-fine copy in near-fine jacket.\n\n\"One of the classic presentations of the womb-city, metropolis as mother, which has haunted imaginations ever since. The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun are the best books Isaac Asimov ever wrote\" (The Guardian). In 2004 The Caves of Steel was nominated for a retroactive Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1954. A television adaptation was made by the BBC and shown in 1964: only a few short excerpts still exist. In 1989, the book was adapted by Bert Coules as a radio play for the BBC, with Ed Bishop as Elijah Baley and Sam Dastor as R. Daneel Olivaw.\n\nCondition: Near Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good+. First Edition. First edition stated, first printing. Signed by Isaac Asimov on title page and inscribed to a former owner. 224 pp. Bound in publisher's original dark blue leatherette with spine lettered in red, red topstain.
