Do you think you're not good enough, not rich enough or thin enough or smart enough, to have the life you want? Or that the problems in your community and the world around you could be solved if only there were more to go around? Everywhere, all the time, we get this message that there is something lacking, something more, something better to strive for. In fact, the idea that there isn't enough or you aren't enough is so deeply ingrained in us and into our culture that it holds sway over pretty much every aspect of our lives, from how we perceive our self-worth and our skills as parents, friends, and partners (I am not enough) to the ways in which we are taught and governed.\n\nBut what if it's a lie? Author and activist Laurie McCammon (the founder of the Women's Institute of Maine, holds an MS in Adult Education with a thesis on transformational learning, and who has served as an NGO delegate at the UN International Commission on the Status of Women) wrote \"Enough!: How to Liberate Yourself and Remake the World with Just One Word \" to show you that it is all a lie. Discover how your own never-enough thinking has been limiting you and how to challenge it in all the places it lurks. Let \"Enough!\" show you how to develop a sense of 'enoughness' that can change not only how you feel about yourself but how you view time, your relationships, your work, and the possibilities for helping to shape a better world.\n\nCritique: Challenging, iconoclastic, insightful, informative, erudite, compelling, and ultimately inspiring, \"Enough!\" is very highly recommended for community library Self-Help/Self-Improvement collections. For personal reading lists it should be noted that \"Enough!\" is also available in a Kindle edition ($10.99).\n\nClean Language\n\nJulie McCracken\n\nCrown House Publishing\n\n6 Trowbridge Drive Suite 5, Bethel, CT 06801\n\nwww.crownhousepublishing.com\n\n9781845901257, $34.95, PB, 160pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: The concept of Clean Language was first developed in the 1980s and 90s by psychotherapist David Grove as he sought to find respectful and effective ways to work with trauma victims. The approach he devised was based on a new type of questioning (and listening) that was rooted in honoring the client's language rather than paraphrasing it, reserving advice rather than pushing it, and cleaning up his own communications with respect to assumptions and metaphors. What Grove learned was that these adjustments allowed his patients to discover and build on the metaphors that were meaningful to them. Once established, they could explore that meaning, experience it in their own ways, learn from it, heal, and move forward. David Grove called his questioning approach Clean Language untainted by assumption or metaphor. Inspired by the effectiveness of David Grove's work, James Lawley and Penny Tompkins studied the approach, eventually codifying it, then expanding upon it and adapting it for classroom teachers. Now in \"Clean Language: Revealing Metaphors and Opening Minds\", authors Sullivan and Rees and take this revolutionary way of communicating completely out of the closet, introducing the concepts to the broad range of helping professional (from psychotherapist to organizational coach) as well as interested non-specialist general readers. Clean Language (Clean, for short) allows access to the deepest levels of people's communications so that the real issues are revealed early and real helping strategies can be created to meet them. When the patient is invited to find the solution, then time isn't wasted in the vain attempts to convince, cajole, or coerce. The basic perspective is straightforward. You should keep your opinions and advice to yourself. You should Listen attentively and ask clean questions to explore metaphors. You should listen to the answers and then ask more Clean questions about they've said. There are just a dozen key Clean questions, and when combined with the words offered by the person being questioned, they become part of a flexible, multipurpose toolkit. The possibility of positive change is just a natural part of the process nobody forcing it, nobody being forced. It's as natural as using clean language.\n\nCritique: Clean Language describes a simple yet potentially revolutionary concept in Communication Studies. Impressively well written, organized and presented, \"Clean Language: Revealing Metaphors and Opening Minds\" is very highly recommended for professional, community, and academic library Educational Studies instructional reference collections and supplemental studies reading lists.\n\nAunt Dimity and the Buried Treasure\n\nNancy Atherton\n\nViking Books\n\nc/o Penguin Group USA\n\n375 Hudson Street, New York, NY 10014\n\nwww.penguin.com\n\n9781101981290, $26.00, HC, 240pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: While exploring the attic in her cottage near the small English village of Finch, Lori Shepherd makes an extraordinary discovery: a gleaming gold and garnet bracelet that had once belonged to Aunt Dimity. When Lori shows the garnet bracelet to Aunt Dimity, it awakens poignant memories of a doomed romance in Aunt Dimity's youth in London after the War. Regretfully, Aunt Dimity asks Lori to do what she could not: return the bracelet to her unsuccessful suitor, setting Lori off on an adventure through London (and through history) to put a piece of Aunt Dimity's past to rest.\n\nIn the meantime, a new family has moved to Finch. The villagers are thrilled because their new neighbors are avid metal detectorists. Metal detectors soon become all the rage in Finch and the villagers unearth a lot of rubbish (some of it quite embarrassing) before one of them stumbles upon a trinket that could hold the key to the origin of Aunt Dimity's bracelet.\n\nIs the bracelet a priceless and protected national treasure? Was Aunt Dimity's lovesick suitor a common thief? If so, how will Lori break the news to Aunt Dimity? And what will she do with the bracelet? As Lori searches for answers, she discovers an unexpected link between the buried treasure in the village and the treasure buried in Aunt Dimity's heart.\n\nCritique: Another riveting entertainment from the pen and imagination of Nancy Atherton, \"Aunt Dimity and the Buried Treasure\" confirms her impressive mastery of the genre. While very highly recommended for community library Mystery/Suspense collections, it should be noted for the personal reading lists of mystery buffs in general, and Nancy Atherton's Aunt Dimity novels in particular, \"Aunt Dimity and the Buried Treasure\" is also available in a Kindle edition ($12.99) and in a complete and unabridged Audio CD format (Dreamscape Media, 9781520006208, $29.99).\n\nBeatrice Bunson's Guide to Romeo and Juliet\n\nPaula Marantz Cohen\n\nPaul Dry Books\n\n1700 Sansom Street, Suite 700, Philadelphia, PA 19103-5214\n\nwww.pauldrybooks.com\n\n9781589881051, $11.95, PB, 200pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: High school begins, and to Beatrice Bunson nothing is the same, not even her best friend, Nan. The \"new\" Nan doesn't hang out with Bea; she's running for Student Council and going to parties and avoiding Bea at lunchtime. The boys who were gross in middle school have become surprisingly polite, while the \"cool\" kids are still a mystery. Bea's older sister, meanwhile, acts like she's living in a soap opera.\n\nOn the bright side, there's English class with Mr. Martin, where Beatrice discovers that Shakespeare has something to say about almost everything -- and that nothing in life is as dramatic as Romeo and Juliet. But when Nan gets in over her head in her new social life, it's up to Beatrice to restore her reputation - and she may need to make a few new friends to pull it off. One of them, the slightly brainy guy that Beatrice meets at her grandmother's retirement home, is definitely kind of cute, and probably dateable.\n\nAs Beatrice and her classmates tackle Romeo and Juliet, they unveil the subtleties of the play as well as broader lessons of love, family, honor, and misunderstandings. Guided by Mr. Martin, these ninth-graders help us to understand Shakespeare, as Shakespeare helps them begin to understand themselves.\n\nCritique: Original, deftly crafted, compellingly entertaining from beginning to end, \"Beatrice Bunson's Guide to Romeo and Juliet\" is very highly recommended for community library General Fiction collections. For personal reading lists it should be noted that \"Beatrice Bunson's Guide to Romeo and Juliet\" is also available in a Kindle edition ($8.17).\n\nShe Poured Out Her Heart\n\nJean Thompson\n\nBlue Rider Press\n\nc/o Penguin Group USA\n\n375 Hudson Street, New York, NY 10014\n\nwww.us.penguingroup.com\n\n9780399573811, $27.00, HC, 432pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: The night that Jane and Bonnie meet on a college campus sets them on paths forever entwined. Bonnie, the wild and experimental one, always up for anything, has spent the past two decades bouncing between ill-fated relationships, while Jane's seemingly perfect life, perfect husband, and perfect children have all but materialized out of a fantasy. But these appearances contradict the quiet, inescapable doubt Jane feels about her life. One night, in the middle of her own Christmas party, she steps outside into the snow, removes her clothing and shoes, and lies down in the backyard. When she is discovered, nothing is the same for anyone. As Jane begins to have visions and retreat into a private inner world, Bonnie finds herself drawn inevitably into an affair with Jane's husband.\n\nCritique: A deftly crafted story of multilayered female friendship, psychological suspense, the complex nature of love, \"She Poured Out Her Heart\" is a compelling and consistently entertaining novel from beginning to end. While \"She Poured Out Her Heart\" is very highly recommended for community library General Fiction collections, it should be noted for personal reading lists that this outstanding work from the pen of Jean Thompson is also available in a Kindle edition ($13.99) and in an MP3 CD format (Blackstone Audio, 9781504715188, $29.95).\n\nShelby's Way...Maybe\n\nKatherine Mitchell\n\nDog Ear Publishing\n\n4011 Vincennes Road, New Augusta, IN 46268-3005\n\nwww.dogearpublishing.net\n\n9781457544132, $12.95, PB, 214pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: Shelby is a stunning beauty, a young mother whose husband, a Hollywood stuntman, runs off with a rich glamorous older woman.

Into this curious limbo where all that is required of Shelby is not to do anything she would regret, enters Marc, a successful screenwriter and former family friend who, with his final divorce decree in hand comes calling.

Retellings often must stray quite far from their original roots to capture this sense of originality, but such is not the case with Hansel and Gretel: The Brothers Grimm Story Told as a Novella, and this is because Mike Klaassen's approach is to add a great deal of psychological insight to explain characters' choices and rationales.\n\nFrom Hansel's changing relationship with his little sister (\"Hansel couldn't stand to see his little sister abused, and he said, \"Do as she says, Gretel.\") to his problem-solving abilities (\"He considered refusing to eat any more food, but then Petra would hurt Gretel again. He needed to find a solution to his problem, but he could think of nothing that would save their lives.\"), psychological depth brings this classic story to new life.\n\nWhy is Hansel so clever? What are the conflicts he faces between protecting his little sister and feeling that she's a stubborn obstruction in his life? Why would their parents consider that abandoning their children was a better option than all of them starving together, or searching out a different way of living? How does Hansel's ability to observe and analyze his world, both within the home and outside of it, open them up to new options?\n\nThese are just some of the ideas in a retelling that stays entirely true to its roots, but injects new understanding into a dark and otherwise-puzzling story line. Those with a special affinity for fairy tale retellings will quickly recognize that this Hansel and Gretel is more than a notch above the usual approach, remaining more connected to its original than most and yet offering something far more compelling. A reading of this novella along with other fairy tale reworks will quickly highlight Klaassen's unique strengths.\n\nConductoid\n\nM. B. Lehane\n\nPounce Publications\n\n9780994489401 $15.25 www.conductoid.com\n\nOpen with a typical student soccer game in which player Jack declines team celebrations at the end of a successful game to examine an illuminated device on his ankle in the privacy of the still-empty locker room, then flees. But there's something extraordinary in the method of his flight and in his ride home, implying that Jack is not the ordinary soccer-playing schoolboy he portrays.\n\nNot every boy has a secret compartment in his closet and a jetpack accompanying his lunch bag. No normal boy can rocket into the sky through his rolled-back bedroom ceiling. And what boy can face his greatest enemy with nary a quiver? Nobody, it turns out - even Jack. But, a boy can dream!\n\nIn a world that constantly challenges Jack to be extraordinary, he consistently fails. His performance in class, in P.E., and in life are all met with obstacles and his best intentions to do better send him into a dream world filled with creatures more realistic than his own life. In contrast, his twin Phoebe is a winner at nearly everything she does. Even worse, his mother is about to become his teacher at school.\n\nWhat's left to enjoy are dreams, which sometimes come with nightmares attached. And in this world, he shines.\n\nConductoid is a super-hero story, a saga of dreams and reality, and tells of a boy who shifts between the persona of a failure and that of Conductoid, a superhero with extraordinary abilities who saves lives and faces down challenges. What, exactly, is a 'conductoid'? It's \"A being who can have another's powers transmitted through them.'\"\n\nAs Jack faces strangers, transformations, and challenges even in his super-world, he finds that the very qualities that limit him in one world come back to haunt him in the one place he feels powerful: \"'In the short term, the danger is more pronounced,' replied the man grimly. 'If you wish to proceed, you will need to listen to my instructions carefully and follow them - a task that may be beyond your capabilities.'\"\n\nNot everything in Conductoid focuses on Jack's changing worlds: in between there are family encounters and relationships, field trips, and revelations about the underlying meaning of being powerful (\"...he was a Conductoid. With great power comes great responsibility.\").\n\nReaders move between fantasy adventure and Jack's real world as Jack explores his position in both. Do the stories Jack creates have their roots in reality? While readers are treated to a satisfying intersection between fantasy and reality, the real questions lie in Jack's ability to move between two worlds and face the consequences of his choices in each.\n\nThis gripping saga will especially delight advanced elementary to middle grade readers who secretly dream of being heroes even as they struggle with being.\n\nPilgrim Spokes\n\nNeil Hanson\n\nHigh Prairie Press\n\n9781944868017 $14.95 www.highprairiepress.com\n\nPilgrim Spokes: Cycling East Across America continues cyclist Neil Hanson's story of his journey across America via bicycle, and begins where the first book (Pilgrim Wheels) left off as he rides from Medicine Lodge in Kansas to Annapolis on the east coast.\n\nAt 60 years old, Hanson is beyond the age when most people would take on this sort of self powered cross country adventure. He averaged 100 miles a day in the course of his ride, traveled alone for part of his journey and then continued on with a fellow cyclist. Pilgrim Spokes delivers a delightful blend of travelogue, cycling insights, and reflections on his journey along America's byways.\n\nPilgrim Spokes and Pilgrim Wheels adopt such a similar tone that one might wonder why the two books weren't merely incorporated under one cover; but as Hanson explains in his introduction, \"the complete answer revolves around things like taking the time for deep and meaningful reflection, transforming the pace of a bicycle ride into a book, and wanting to tell a more complete story.\"\n\nNot a hasty rush through America, his journey allowed a deep and meaningful embrace of the experience as he meandered from the Pacific to the Atlantic. It would have thwarted the spirit of this journey to have edited out many of these experiences for the sake of cramming them all into one book. Reflecting the slower pace of a bicycle ride, Pilgrim Spokes indulges the reader within a journey that fully explores the sights, sounds, sensations, and encounters of the road.\n\nReaders need not be avid cyclists in order to appreciate Pilgrim Spokes. The focus is on the experience and the journey, not just the destination or the mechanics of getting there. Armchair readers will be as enchanted with this book as will be the cyclist who contemplates this sort of epic journey.\n\nHanson immerses the reader in the cultures and experiences of the communities who invite him in to their world: \"It's late in the night when the music gets underway down in the living room. The cool September night air feels good creeping in through my open window, the quiet disturbed only by wonderful sounds from the living room below, filling the air with the songs of musicians expressing themselves through the souls of their instruments. Their music drifts out through the windows downstairs, across the old porch, and folds itself luxuriantly around me in my bed above. Music has been an unexpected and delightful surprise to me as I've crossed Missouri.\"\n\nThe introspection prompted by Hanson's encounters is wonderfully done - \"I lay awake, watching lights from outside the partially closed curtain playing across the ceiling. I'm a lucky man to have the solid oak planking of a friendship with Dave in my life. I'm a lucky man to have been part of a marriage that lasted 30 years. I hope to be wise enough to recognize and appreciate the wise and imperfect people I will cross paths with as I continue down this road I'm on.\") They blend nicely with the pedaling progress of his road trip: \"This old secondary road may very well be the Old Old National Road, hinted at by an old covered bridge sitting by itself in a city park in the town of Lewisburg. I ride over to and around the bridge, a feeling of disappointment hanging over me. The bridge is clearly out of place here in the dry park, like a once-proud lion panting on the concrete in a cage at the zoo.\"\n\nWhile Hanson's story shares many moments of joy and sweet reflection, there are also darker experiences, including physical exhaustion and pain, deadly attacks from passing thugs, and deep personal regret. Many of the obstacles that he discovers emerge as much from emotional psyche, the need for flexibility, and gaps in comfort as they do from physical effort.\n\nHanson's story takes the time to capture subtle nuances within his journey, and this sets it apart from other travelogues. Pilgrim Spokes is a vivid read filled with personal reflection, philosophical insights, physical challenges, and a dose of spirituality that immerses the reader in an exhilarating ride.\n\nThe One\n\nB.A. Sherman\n\nB.A. Sherman, Publisher\n\nPaperback: 978-1530616039 $11.65\n\nEbook: ASIN:B01D3HQIWA $ 2.99\n\nAmazon Website: http://www.amazon.com/B.A.-Sherman/e/B00KIO8190\n\nAuthor Website: www.basherman.com\n\nThe One presents the second book in the Greg Dorn series and opens with a dream by Mica, who has returned to her family home mourning the absence of partner Greg, who left her long ago. Now he's dead and gone forever, killed, and Mica must close the book what could have been - or should she?\n\nIt's not often that a thriller begins with the death of the main protagonist, but The One is filled with surprises, and this opener is only one of them. Is Greg Dorn dead, or is there an insidious plot underway with new and dangerous scheme? Under what circumstances can a family man dedicated to justice become a killer, and what would it take to twist that man to change his most basic impulses?\n\nAs Greg navigates unfamiliar surroundings and is primed for a mission far beyond anything he's considered a part of his psyche, he finds himself literally and figuratively speeding on a fast train to nowhere, immersed in lives and circumstances designed to remake all his abilities to point them in an entirely new direction.\n\nIn the end, all he may have are dreams of what was, to guide him to a different path as he rampages through his new persona: \"Greg flashed awake, breathing heavily and sweating. He could feel that he had been crying and still felt the sadness from his dream. All he could remember was Daddy, please help us, and it echoed in his head making his ears ring. \"I have to leave this place, I need to be with them,\" Greg said out loud as he lay in his bed looking up at the ceiling in the dark.\"\n\nCan Greg Dorn ever return to his real self; and will his newfound mission and direction return him full-circle into his familiar world? These are just a few of the questions readers of this psychological thriller will relish as they follow the transformation of good man into killing machine.\n\nReaders of psychological thrillers and intrigue are in for a treat with The One.\n\nThrow Away Girls\n\nJennifer Vaughn\n\nWaldorf Publishing\n\nhttp://waldorfpublishing.com\n\nwww.jvwrites.com\n\n9781944245627 $16.95\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Throw-Away-Girls-Jennifer-Vaughn/dp/1944245626/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453134307&sr=1-1&keywords=throw+away+girls\n\nFans of novels that feature high-octane action and powerful female protagonists will quickly realize that the characters and nature of Throw Away Girls represents the embodiment of passion and purpose in the form of reporter Jaycee Wilder, who sets out to snag a big story and a bigger career in Los Angeles.\n\nShe gets more than she bargained for, however, when a series of murders draws her from her safe role as a reporter into the more dangerous world of an involved investigator edging ever closer to a clever killer.\n\nThrow Away Girls doesn't open with Jaycee's perspective, however: shockingly, it documents a murder in progress, immediately letting readers know that violence and danger will permeate the story line, which is not a powder-puff piece for light mystery readers.\n\nThis killer specializes in the seedy kinds of girls who frequent nightclubs; so in order to break the story, Jaycee must track dangerous, savvy killer whose methodology and expertise in murder is only part of his cunning in knowing how to disappear and how to observe, from a safe distance, Jaycee's increasing involvement in the hunt.\n\nAt times it feels like the roles of predator and prey is continually switching, and that's because each protagonist faces a worthy, equal opponent in the other. And so a cat-and-mouse game evolves that keeps Jaycee - and readers - on their toes as a dangerous romp through the seedy side of life embraces agony, awareness, and the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde life of a family man by day, who is a passionate killer by night.\n\nIs Jaycee about to become a \"Throwaway Girl\" in the killer's limelight? Evidence warns her of the danger (\"If she wasn't in the throes of a big story, using insider information, and about to reveal even more about a killer on the loose, she'd consider this a coincidence. Some crazy guy letting her know he thought she was hot. But then she flipped the picture around and all hope of bad cosmic timing was lost. No, this was intentional, a killer's way of telling her to back off in bold red pen.\"), but her response is to not only persevere, but adopt a level of cunning equal to that of her opponent.\n\nIn such a game, who will win? There are no pat answers and no quick solutions, and readers of detective fiction who like well-developed characters, twists of story line, and engrossing moves and counter-moves will love the approach of Throw Away Girls, which takes a brutal vigilante's personal quest for justice and blends it with a savvy reporter's passion for her job.\n\nReaders enthusiastic about smart, successful, creative female protagonists will find themselves rooting for Jaycee's ultimate success and chafing at the many obstacles and increasingly insurmountable hurdles she faces in the process of playing a dangerous game.\n\nTell My Dad\n\nRam Muthiah\n\nWaimea Publishing\n\n9780997390681 $2.99 (Kindle), $11.95 (Paperback)\n\nhttp://www.rammuthiah.com https://www.facebook.com/tellmydad\n\nIt's not often that a mystery is based on real-life events; but Tell My Dad presents such a thriller in presenting a child's kidnapping and the kind overture that truly turned deadly in the California scenario which plays out in this book.\n\nThe opening seems an unlikely setup for crime: Amanda, a senior in high school, is on top of the world about her Stanford admission and shopping habit. But when she is abducted in broad daylight, shock waves hit the community and immediately involves the law in a desperate search for a serial killer who is an expert at snatching and murdering girls with wanton disregard for any witnesses.\n\nInspired by a late-night internet chat, the perp has hatched the perfect plan - but something goes awry. Someone has quickly found him, and plans on exacting their own revenge for his crimes. Readers won't expect what happens next, which is one of the specialties of Tell My Dad: it takes a murder mystery and twists its scenes so that what is seemingly inevitable becomes a big surprise.\n\nHaving a vigilante killer who takes on the chore of doing the police's job is nothing new; but what is new is a professional approach to the task that sets up and perhaps even creates kidnappers.\n\nThe dangers of internet interactions with strangers, the culpability of teenagers to dangerous online situations, and the determination of a killer who has serious intentions of reducing the number of kids kidnapped in America all intersect to make for a gripping study in tension.\n\nWhy is the killer so seasoned and expert at his tasks? How can the savviest of detectives be thwarted, and who will track down this vigilante hero?\n\nAdd a healthy dose of ethical conundrum on the parts of the investigators charged with bringing him to justice (\"I still think that whoever killed these monsters is a good guy. If not for him, these monsters would have killed even more children.\") for a mystery packed with satisfying scenes and many a surprise to keep even seasoned thriller readers engrossed to the last page.\n\nSecrets of a Financial Aid Pro\n\nJodi Okun\n\n15th Street Publishing\n\n9780997352726, Hardcover: $25.95 Paper: $14.95\n\nhttp://amzn.com/0997352728\n\nAs kids near college age, financial planning for higher education becomes imperative; yet too many parents and students enter the process without all the tools they need to make reasoned financial decisions (or learn of their far-reading consequences).\n\nSecrets of a Financial Aid Pro: Master the College Funding Process and Give Your Child Lifelong Financial Skills Without Losing Your Cool goes beyond the usual focus on how to locate loans or scholarships in offering a complete method of achieving this major task. The result is not a listing of financial sources so much as a strategy for college funding and beyond which can move into life and business circles just as easily as it assesses the college planning process.\n\nFunding is a basic issue in any life endeavor, whether it be college, starting a business, buying a house, or achieving almost any big goal. That's why, in most cases, the bigger picture boat is missed in other college planners: and that is one of the basic process of gathering, assessing, and applying funding options across the board.\n\nThere are more than a few surprises revealed in this wider-ranging approach; among them the idea that such planning should ideally begin in middle school, and that middle school and high school student can possess the skills and information to make solid financial decisions about their futures (with a little parental insight and knowledge, the latter of which is provided here).\n\nChapters admonish parents to involve their kids more in major financial matters (\"It's important to start teaching your child about money, budgeting, and saving early in life. Giving your child responsibility for saving toward big purchases, like a car, or teaching them how to budget their allowance helps them understand the value of their money and how hard they have to work for what they want.\") and emphasize the difference between a finite resource and no resources.\n\nStep-by-step instructions for applying for funding (such as filling out forms for the FAFSA) juxtapose with life funding and money management tips and insights, such as why a student should understand how credit works and use it carefully and cautiously: \"It's important to teach your student about the implications of bad credit. Not making payments, paying minimum amounts, skipping payments, or having too much credit are all reported to the various credit bureaus. While this might not seem like a big deal to your student now, having a bad credit rating can cause a lot of harm later in life. It could affect their ability to rent an apartment, purchase auto insurance, buy a home, or get a car.\"\n\nSecrets of a Financial Aid Pro's tone assumes that parents will be reading the book and working with their child: it covers the basic financial skills needed for life itself, organizing them into digestible bits that take college funding a step further, using it as a template for lifetime money management routines.\n\nNo parent should be without this essential guide, whether their child is going to college or not.\n\nGambling Demons\n\nAlex Siegel\n\nAmazon Digital Services\n\nB01D5R0WSY, $2.99 (Kindle)\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D5R0WSY\n\nOnce again angels and demons that inhabit the world powered by The First Circle Club are facing an adversary that may move in circles beyond Heaven and Hell when a series of disasters affecting a football team toes the line between a losing streak and a curse. Why should a supernatural vigilante team become involved in a football team's dilemma? Because it's not just the team that's endangered, as club leader Virgil comes to realize in a progression of deadly encounters and bloodshed.\n\nThe second scene opens with the admission that Virgil has no heart. Literally. But this doesn't mean he can't enjoy a good heart-pounding game of football on TV at the headquarters of the First Circle Club which he leads. It's there that he first learns about the string of amazingly deadly events affecting his favorite team - and since he's the leader of a group charged with investigating and resolving supernatural possibilities, the task seems right up his alley in more ways than one.\n\nThe problem is: that alley is, in actuality, only one long, winding road in a dangerous journey, and Virgil's initial interest has just sent him, unsuspectingly, straight into the heart of a new danger. News of the curse actually feels like a set-up by the perp, using a personal lure to beckon him to investigate; and when Virgil grabs the bait, eternal punishment seems like a picnic in the face of this new danger.\n\nOne of the pleasures of this ongoing series is that the multiple, action-packed books allow readers to enjoy characters that become more developed with every book.\n\nFrom FBI involvements to visions of monsters chasing Virgil and a bet with gambling and the gaming community that turns deadly, Gambling Demons moves swiftly beyond its initial scenario and premises to grab and absorb readers with another supernatural battle involving insanity, mythical demons, the murder of a master, and scenarios even demons find impossible to comprehend or predict.\n\nReaders should be forewarned that familiarity with the prior First Circle novels will contribute to a smooth transition into this latest novel (although Gambling Demons opens with enough of a bang to immediately draw newcomers as an undercover cop meets his maker).\n\nCombine a 'whodunnit' with a healthy dose of supernatural intrigue and a conflict brought to the gates of Heaven and Hell themselves and you have a riveting read that's hard to put down, especially recommended for prior First Circle Club fans who will find this latest struggle knocks on the door of Heaven itself, begging for God's involvement.\n\nA More Deadly Union\n\nGayle Carline\n\nDancing Corgi Press\n\n9781943654079, $3.99, (ebook)\n\n9781943654086, $13.99 (paperback)\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/More-Deadly-Union-Minneopa-Mysteries-ebook/dp/B01D3MMZ9K?ie=UTF8&keywords=A%20More%20Deadly%20Union&qid=1464009664&ref_=sr_1_1_twi_kin_1&s=books&sr=1-1\n\nPeri Minneopa's in a bind in more ways than one: her detective boyfriend of 10 years, Skip, is in a coma in a hospital after being shot and she can't even visit him (since they're not married), while her client is facing a deadly stalker.\n\nBlinded by grief and thwarted by an impossible task, Peri looks at death from both sides of her desk as she struggles to make sense of her life.\n\nThe reality of hospital limitations on non-relatives (\"Um, I'm sorry. This group is for relatives and spouses only.\" \"But I've been dating him for ten years.\" Peri reasoned with her. \"We lived together.\" \"I'm sorry, Ma'am.\" The nurse sounded contrite. \"We have rules. Confidentiality, you know.\") comes to life in the saga of a police office down and sends Peri into a tailspin; specially since her client's case keeps conflicting with police investigations.\n\nIt may take more than a bullet to bring Skip down, but his greatest challenge in life is well on its way to making a direct hit on his home turf at the time as he faces his own struggle for survival.\n\nThis riveting saga will engross any interested in police procedural mysteries, adding a powerful sense of purpose and angst between two protagonists who must not only face the demands of their jobs; but their own relationship.\n\nCan Peri investigate a shooting she's been giving a \"hands off\" order to avoid when new clues falls directly into her hands? Can friendships prove harder than being alone? And what happens when the hunter becomes the hunted?\n\nAs the detective and P.I. struggle to regain their lives and find new purpose in them, readers are swept along in a mounting story of intrigue and strange associations in a satisfyingly complex, engrossing mystery from start to finish.\n\nDark Moon\n\nDeborah Hawkins\n\nAmazon Digital Services\n\nISBN 9780988934757 (ebook) $.99\n\nISBN 9780988934764 (print) $17.15\n\nhttp://amzn.com/B01BTR8Q44\n\nCriminal defense attorney Sarah Knight has made a name for herself while spending over forty years in hiding from her own truth. Having just journeyed coast-to-coast to San Diego, she faces one of the most challenging cases of her life in representing a former Supreme Court clerk arrested for murder; but the process of her defense leads to an investigation of more than another's guilt or innocence in Dark Moon.\n\nTrue to the rest of Deborah Hawkins's legal thrillers, Dark Moon injects more than a light degree of personal involvement into the story of a high-profile case where Sarah is advised to make only a mild defense effort for the sake of preserving her professional career.\n\nThe only trouble is: Sarah's efforts can't be bought with threats, and it can't even be swayed when she and her investigator, ex-FBI agent Jim, face death threats as their probes go too far.\n\nWho would be willing to set up Alexa so that she's quickly sentenced to death for a crime she may not have committed, and who would be willing to risk the deaths of her defenders in a very high-profile, public case? The answer is: only someone with everything to hide and too much confidence that their road to success is virtually guaranteed.\n\nAs Sarah embarks on one of the biggest challenges of her professional career - one which quickly evolves to become a challenge to survive on more than one level - she faces losing everything she's built and the secret she's so carefully preserved all her life.\n\nWhat makes Dark Moon such a standout (much like the author's other legal thrillers) is the concurrent themes of personal challenge and achievement which run through the story line with a powerful ability to draw in even readers who usually eschew this genre for its too-common over-reliance on legal process over character development.\n\nInteractions between characters are vividly portrayed and readers become drawn to the story by many personal moments and connections: \"I'm serious, Sarah. You look as if you're burning up from the inside out.\" And maybe I am, she thought. Maybe I'll be a pile of ashes by morning, and I'll be free of you and Alexa and the torment of this case.\"\n\nThe result is a gripping study in psychology and legal process wound deftly into the footprints of a legal thriller that is hard to put down, holding the rare ability to immerse both genre readers and more general-interest thriller and mystery enthusiasts, alike.\n\nDandelion Iron\n\nAaron Michael Ritchey\n\nWordFire Press\n\nPO Box 1840, Monument CO 80132-1840\n\n9781614753490 $14.99 Paper; $5.99 Kindle\n\nwww.wordfirepress.com\n\nDandelion Iron is Book One of The Juniper Wars and is set in 2058, when men have largely been exterminated by war and the remaining population is mostly sterile. Under these conditions, humanity's survival is in jeopardy. In this world, five U.S. states (now known as the Juniper collective) have banded together in a struggle to survive. Three spunky girls who are trying to save their cattle ranch stumble upon an oddity - a boy who represents one of the last remaining hopes for a new generation.\n\nSo what happens when three feisty girls find one boy? Trouble. One falls in love. One sees the profit in the matter and wants to sell him off. The other wants to get trouble out of their lives.\n\nAs if this weren't enough, an army knows about Micaiah and is searching for him, too. With four conflicting special interests surrounding him, action is swift and engrossing. And with spirited, largely-female characters running the show, there's a lot to like in Dandelion Iron.\n\nTake a deep breath to absorb the smells, sights, and feel of Aaron Michael Ritchey's apocalyptic landscape, which is steeped in Western tradition and atmosphere: \"Right then, it was as if such violence had never happened there. The morning air was heavy with ranch smells: three thousand head of cattle, fifty horses, pigs, chickens all created quite a bouquet. A gust of wind brought the smell of dry, winter grass and drying mud - the perfume of my homeland.\"\n\nThen prepare for a rollicking good ride in a romance that deftly toes the lines between an odd version of a new morality, a romance, and a Western gun slinging adventure powered by female interests and perceptions and fueled with solid dialogue.\n\nUnder Ritchey's hand, the writing is compelling (\"Cavatica, I'm in trouble. Real trouble. If your sisters get their way, I'll either be dead in a week or sold into slavery. I need your help. What we had, well, it was powerful, unexpected, incredible, but I understand what you're getting at. However good it was, we can't be together under these circumstances.\" Now I wanted to protest, 'cause, dang it, I wanted to kiss him again. \"I'll convince my sisters. You're with us 'til the end. In Wendover, you'll be able to catch a bus easy to Vegas, or a plane. And maybe you and I ...\" More dead syllables, scattered all around. Maybe you and I could go to Vegas together. Didn't say it, only thought it - fell into a little fantasy, right there. He and I in a hotel suite, him respecting my decision to be chaste, and me wanting him more than I should.\"), the characters come alive, and the story line is engrossing and practically impossible to put down.\n\nIt's great to see another, different take on an apocalyptic scenario: one that takes 'woman power' to a whole new level, leaving them in charge and in defiance of some of the concepts and options in their new world. Dandelion Iron is a compelling read because of these powerful women and their different quests through a rugged, semi-familiar Western territory, making for a highly recommended pick for any who enjoy stories of survival against all odds.\n\nEscapee: Repelling the Invasion\n\nEdward Hoornaert\n\nMuseItUp Publishing\n\n9781771277945, $2.99, www.museituppublishing.com\n\nHector is a career military man who finds himself pushing papers more than battling for what he believes in, while Catt ekes out a living and learns to survive through conducting commerce on the same mining moon that Hector's forces occupy.\n\nWhen invaders capture the moon, destroying Hector's command and power and taking away Catt's only source of income, their lives and different goals become connected when Catt rescues Hector from the rubble of disaster.\n\nFar from being grateful, Hector wants Catt to join him in a counterattack - just the two of them - but Catt hasn't planned on becoming a soldier anytime soon, much less one under the command of another. And both of their lives are in danger, not only from the new occupying forces, but from a notoriously fierce environment of eruptions and storms.\n\nGiven their fierce independence, disparate goals, and strong personalities, it feels inevitable that their differences would draw them together sooner or later; but the romance develops in a satisfyingly logical manner and offers a number of surprises along the way as each evaluate the other for more than survival purposes or military might.\n\nReaders holding a special affinity for romances and military sci-fi will enjoy the blend of these genres and scenes which describe both love and battle: \"Hector stabbed a finger at the map projected in the middle of the cabin. Then he glanced at Catt - Captain Sayer, that is - who frowned back at him. In the last two hours, she had frowned non-stop. Which did she regret - agreeing to take him to the enemy headquarters? Or the kiss?\"\n\nIf love takes the reins, will survival and revenge take a back seat? A powerful story of invasion, destruction, newfound love and threats to life evolves in a story of strikes, counterstrikes, and just the right dose of romance to give it all a satisfying personal overlay. Military sci-fi readers who like romance stories will find Escapee: Repelling the Invasion an engrossingly satisfying read.\n\nPMS: The Power & Money Sisters\n\nK.P.

Seeing women her own age shopping with teenaged children made her realize how much time had already passed.\"\n\nAgainst the backdrop of success lies the reality of diverging paths and failures along the way, brought to light and examined by PMS members who use the bonds of affection to form new associations and handle the breakups and dissolutions inevitable in life, love, and business: \"Breaking up is hard to do, even if it's just business, not love.\"\n\nFans of women's fiction will find a lot to like in a story that explores the foundations of friendships and love alike: \"Men come and go,\" she said, \"but girlfriends are forever.\" It's refreshing to see these women's bonds center around personal power over male interactions. Even when the women speak of lovers, partners, and male associates, it's always tempered by their own strong interrelationships with each other and other facets of life.\n\nAs each woman faces the opportunities and limitations of her life and choices, sharing the results with others, a subtheme of growth and change emerges which offers candid assessments of the special challenges facing women who dream of both careers and family: \"She was thankful he seemed oblivious to the implications of her question, that what she really wanted to know was if he wanted to have children with her. She wanted to kick herself for so badly misinterpreting his proud fatherhood. He'd already produced his progeny; he was done, while she was eager to begin.\"\n\nWomen's fiction readers will relish these empowering encounters between business professionals who each have a foot in the trials and challenges of daily living.\n\nThe Black Ten Commandments: National Warning Order\n\nTony Caligula, M.R.E.\n\nOutskirts Press\n\n10940 S. Parker Road, #515, Parker, CO 80134\n\n9781478727057 $29.95 http://www.outskirtspress.com\n\nThe title of Tony Caligula's book The Black Ten Commandments actually comes from a quote by Ossie Davis, from a comment during the first Congressional Black Caucus dinner in 1971, which called for a black plan of action that eschews leadership in favor of personal responsibility The book offers an intriguing mix of military process and social insights on the black community and comes from an Army Captain who synthesizes some 20 years of research into his game plan.\n\nWhat are the real roots of dysfunction in the black community? While many may claim that these lie in racism and heritage, Caligula maintains that in fact the high illegitimacy rate in the black community is one of the key starting points of poverty, crime, and repression.\n\nWhile some single parents have defied the odds, statistical evidence points to an overwhelming disparity between the comparative statuses of two-parent, wealthier homes and those headed by a single, struggling parent - and since the latter is the norm in the Black community, it's a major problem that needs to be addressed and changed.\n\nAt what point does victimization become an excuse for repeating patterns that have historically lead to failure, and how has the Black community been steeped in following familiar but self-defeating paths? The purpose of The Ten Black Commandments isn't just to change the course of the Black community: it advocates creating an independent, economically powerful low-income Black United States of America sub country loyal to the U.S. constitution, but fiscally separate; and its startling opener is that Dr. Martin Luther King's vision and dream is officially dead - it's time for another game plan, which is covered here.\n\nChapters defy the usual statistics to strike at the heart of what keeps Black America in thrall and oppressed, and then they build this concept up by showing exactly how abuse can be identified, codependent actions eliminated, and mis-education processes thwarted.\n\nWhether one agrees with the processes and procedures or not, the information is precise, strategic, and actionable - and these approaches are only one reason why The Black Ten Commandments is highly recommended for any who would consider causes, effects, and alternatives in building a more powerful Black community.\n\nThe other reason embedded in this process is hope, which lies in a specific model for change by an aware, much-decorated military officer.\n\nPulse: When Gravity Fails\n\nJohn Freitas\n\nCreateSpace\n\n4900 LaCross Rd., North Charleston, SC 29406\n\nwww.createspace.com\n\n9781530117567 $2.99\n\nAmazon link: http://amzn.com/B01BZDQCNE\n\nAuthor's website: http://www.scifibookseries.com\n\nWhen the Alpha Centauri star system collapses, it creates a gravitational wave across space that changes everything when it hits Earth, but at fist these strange changes are viewed as localized odd phenomena. It will take a savvy scientist, such as Dr. Paulo Restrepo, to connect the dots and discover not only the problem, but a cure - if there is one.\n\nPulse: When Gravity Fails is Book One of an apocalyptic series, but unlike many of its genre peers; it's not an epic tome but a relatively quick, digestible read. While this fact may disappoint readers who like complex and lengthy stories, in fact its concise format makes Pulse far more accessible than many and allows for a series of adventures that aren't rooted in over-complexity or \"filler\" descriptions.\n\nThe opening examples focus on several vastly different scenarios. From a laundry room child's impromptu flight to a military pilot's unexpected plane crash and odd happenings in a remote Siberian outpost, the different events are connected together in a thrilling tale that moves from scientific impossibility to revelation. Earthquakes, satellites knocked out of orbit, a changing world, and different characters who struggle to understand and then survive all make for lively, engrossing reading that explores not only efforts to live, but connections between different cultures and characters.\n\nWhat will the human race do if it has prior warning that its way of life will soon change? And what if that warning is incomplete? As efforts to survival emerge, the story line is fueled by believable protagonists who hold clear goals and face many challenges. Can peace and trust emerge from chaos and unprecedented disaster?\n\nPulse's strength lies in its ability to quickly immerse readers in several simultaneous scenarios revolving around the effects of changed gravity on the world. Characters and events in Russia and Arkansas create satisfying contrasts of experience and perspective and juxtapose two stories under one larger umbrella of earth-altering disaster - all this completed in under a hundred pages of gripping description. Fans of apocalyptic scenarios will relish this concise, compelling story and will look forward to more books in the series.\n\nA Very Physical Spirituality\n\nMichael Abramowitz\n\nSmashwords\n\n9780992559618 Free\n\n\"A Very Physical Spirituality\" at Smashwords\n\n\"A Very Physical Spirituality\" at Google Play\n\nA Very Physical Spirituality: A Bridge Over the Divide Between Science and Religion draws important links between the spiritual and material world and, from the start, defines the roots of disparities which have divided the two: \"While it's not possible to test the veracity of any other-worldly claims, the descriptions of this world by many religions have proved to be scientifically inadequate, and this has aroused suspicion of their other-worldly offerings.\"\n\nThe alternative idea of a sentient spirituality is presented, along with supporting evidence that examines the presence of patterns and their orders as one key to understanding the connections between spiritual and material forces.\n\nChapters consider how meaning can be derived from these patterns, show how a combination of scientific analysis and logic can be adjusted in order to allow a plausible context for spirituality, and present a brand of physics that requires no scientific mindset to prove accessible and understandable.\n\nMake no mistake: just because it's accessible doesn't mean that Michael Abramowitz's discussion is easy. A Very Physical Spirituality is best digested slowly, in bits and pieces, because its concepts and admonitions present much food for thought for scientific, spiritual, and general-interest readers alike: \"We construct our narratives, and the narratives of the people and things around us, on the basis of the meanings we comprehend. The mode of sentience we choose can determine the mode of the serial meaning in which the reality we are responsible for unfolds.\"\n\nIt should also be cautioned that believers in one God or one system will find many challenging points here; not the least of which is the presence of layers of Dieties: \"The sentiences of these deities did not precede the material world. From this perspective, the fundamental forces of physics are dumb natural spirits, the phenomena of connectivity and the architective constraining thereof are dumb natural spirits, the entire basic material universe is itself a dumb natural spirit while all sentiences, even spiritual sentiences, have arisen in it.\"\n\nBy now it should be evident that A Very Physical Spirituality requires more than a scientific or a spiritual mind: it demands of its readers the flexibility of belief and thinking to envision a different kind of connection between science, spirituality, and the material world. Readers who enjoy higher-level thinking about cosmic consciousness will relish a discussion which is semi-scholarly in tone but clear enough to educate and challenge readers looking at different kinds of connections and purposes between Heaven and Earth.\n\nRedefining Darkness\n\nAlaric Cabiling\n\nAlaric Cabiling Limited (Ltd.)\n\nISBN: 9781513609591 $15.00 paper\n\neISBN: 9781945170423 $2.99\n\nAuthor website: alariccabiling.net\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Redefining-Darkness-Stories-Alaric-Cabiling/dp/1513609599/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8\n\nBarnes & Noble: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/redefining-darkness-stories-alaric-p-cabiling/1123537505?ean=9781513609591\n\nRedefining Darkness is a short story collection pairing protagonist choices and experiences with solid plots representing vignettes of time and place, and demonstrates just how much can be accomplished within the short story format.\n\nTen circumstances of 'redefining' one's world are illustrated in stories that run the gamut in presenting characters of different ages, sexes, and approaches to life.\n\nTake the opener, 'Day of Darkness', for one example. Seven-year-old Francis is confessing his little crimes, but a bigger one takes place instead. Instantly the scene changes to a police report on television, then to the reactions of the Church, both internally and externally.\n\nReaders receive only four pages to this short story, which create the precise and concise staccato impact of a verbal photo shoot, the camera clicking along from scene to scene while viewers receive a dose of just one definition of a growing darkness.\n\n'Cause of Death', the next story, takes longer to build and describe its particular brand of darkness: here the anniversary of a wife's murder thirteen years earlier brings with it the nightmare of a life lived in grief, among bodies and murders, fueled with the fiery results of vodka and horror.\n\nAgain, experience the staccato paragraphs of description that click from scene to scene with the clarity of a camera shutter capturing images and vignettes. Readers have no idea where the journey is heading: all they know is that it's going straight into the darkness of death - with a peculiar twist.\n\nSuicide. Abandonment. Death. The pursuit of fortune and sex. Each short story expertly hones the knife of angst and moves between vastly different character perspectives; and each adds a piece to the evolving jigsaw puzzle theme.\n\nThe result is a powerful, gripping gathering that grabs readers and doesn't let go. How does darkness evolve and grow? Read these stories and find out.\n\nThat which doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.\n\nSpider 2-3\n\nRobert Vallier\n\nJaguar Publishing Inc.\n\neBook: 9780990881179 $3.49\n\nPaperback: 9780990881148 $13.99\n\nhttp://www.spider2-3.com\n\nOrdering Links:\n\nAmazon (USA): http://www.amazon.com/SPIDER-2-3-Robert-Vallier-ebook/dp/B0164EUPZK\n\nNook: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/spider-2-3-robert-vallier/1123361218\n\nKobo: https://store.kobobooks.com/en-us/ebook/spider-2-3\n\nSpider 2-3 is the kind of thriller that takes the familiar theme of international espionage and elevates it to a whole new level. Within this genre lie the usual suspects: murderers, kidnappers, traitors and spies, and intelligence games played on all sides of the international arena.\n\nIf it's nonstop, staccato action that's desired, readers should definitely choose Spider 2-3 above others: the adventure starts with cool observation (\"The elevator doors opened. The night receptionist looked up from her keyboard and glanced at the man. She noticed the light brown coat, the dark shoes, the grey hair. No-one important. She put away her empty smile. It would be the last smile he'd ever see.\") but moves quickly to the streets of Berlin and the mission of a man who walks - then runs - straight into darkness.\n\nFast forward to the Caribbean three weeks later for a change of scene that at first seems unrelated to events in Berlin. The beaches of paradise are the last place one would expect to find the intrusion of international intrigue - but JP and Stella head into the heart of danger when a disappearance brings heartache into the picture: \"Those emotions were fighting the strong practical approach that he knew he had to maintain.\"\n\nReaders easily follow the give-and-take action, largely because of Robert Vallier's attention to exploring emotion, motivation, and the complexities of international affairs that enter into the story line and give it added flavor and a logical progression of events : \"In discussion with the Chief of Police, JP pointed out that when the kidnappers make contact it would be with Stella's family in South Africa and so he should leave the island immediately to be with them. The Police agreed - if there had actually been a kidnapping. So far there was only a missing person, and so they were understandably reluctant to let JP off the island; what if the woman turned up dead? There would be a murder investigation and the prime suspect would then be JP himself.\"\n\nAs international agents and confrontations rise to the forefront, a myriad of subplots engage in satisfyingly vivid descriptions that wind a series of events around the Spider, whose actions represent larger threats.\n\nAs heroes and villains clash and the killings escalate, a desperate race against time ensues, with subterfuge and secret motivations powering events surrounding nuclear weapons, espionage, international money matters, and more.\n\nThriller readers who appreciate a blend of nonstop action and a romp around the world chasing Muslim extremists and facing chess-like moves on an international playing board will find Spider 2-3 a powerfully moving read that's hard to put down.\n\nThings on a Tree\n\nD.L.

With this book in hand, no potential 'green' homeowner need enter the process uninformed.\n\nReverie\n\nLauren Rico\n\nHarmony House Productions\n\nhttp://www.harmonyhouseproductions.com.au\n\n9780997430325, $14.99 print, $4.99 electronic\n\nWebsite: www.LaurenRico.com\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Reverie-Lauren-Rico-ebook/dp/B01D6KSIBS\n\nJulia's gone into hiding in response to her terrible childhood experiences - not in a usual secret place, but in full public view. As one of the top cellists in the country, her ambitions and work assures that she won't become involved in any pressing or dangerous relationships, and won't have to face either her own sexuality or the ghosts of her past.\n\nBut fellow musician Jeremy has broken down these barriers, and Julia finally feels able to trust, open up, and move on from her past, since she's now found the right person to help - or, has she?\n\nReverie is a powerful story about hiding and dangerous patterns, it's about playing from memory and turning those memories into powerful instruments of change, and it's about what happens when that determination to succeed against all odds is attacked by something different.\n\nIt's not that Julia doesn't have friends - Matthew and other musicians are some of her biggest fans. It's that she hasn't let anyone get close, until now. And her hardest decisions may be yet to come.\n\nReverie focuses on the demanding world of professional music, the opportunities it holds for success and safety, and what happens when someone breaks through professional boundaries.\n\nJulia didn't expect a charming and complicated guy to penetrate her well-honed defenses. She didn't opt to fall for someone who gets along with few people in her world. And most of all, she didn't expect that the techniques she carefully put into place to survive would all come crashing down around her the instant she relaxed.\n\nJeremy, too, is in for more than a few surprises (\"I've been blindsided, that's what happened. And I don't do blindsided.\") What evolves is an increasingly complicated example of what happens when different worlds - and relationships - collide. What makes a stalker or contributes to the relationship between stalker and victim? What happens when others get in the way of carefully-laid plans?\n\nAs perspectives change between Jeremy and Julia and immerse everyone around them in music and personal worlds, the story becomes a riveting example of what happens when things fall apart. The story revolves around a competition in more ways than one, and its outcome will surprise and delight readers looking for a blend of professional music world insights, romance, and psychological tension. Most of all, Reverie profiles dreams, shattered visions, and survival. Tenacious and absorbing, Reverie is a story hard to put down.\n\nShadows And Teeth: Ten Terrifying Tales Of Horror And Suspense, Volume 1\n\nVarious Authors\n\nDarkwater Syndicate, Inc.\n\nhttp://www.darkwatersyndicate.com\n\n9780991074570, $3.99 e-book / $19.99 paperback\n\nShadows And Teeth makes for exquisite reading for those who like dark stories filled with horror, bloodshed, demons, and the bizarre. The anthology delivers tense thrills. Each story excels in its craft and provides horror readers with twists and turns that are unexpected and engrossing.\n\nSurvival instinct kicks in both for protagonists and readers alike as terrifying scenarios are presented in which the unexpected turns deadly. In Rich Phelan's 'The Pied Piper's Appetite', a sadistic, psychotic man kidnaps and tortures women he deems to be whores, with the larger scheme in mind to involve an unwilling accomplice in murder. Mark Meier's 'The Final Spell' tells of a modern day wizard who hand-picks his replacement, and what terrible things befall his power-hungry protege.\n\nThe only prerequisite for complete appreciation of this powerful collection is a penchant for the macabre. Each tale is a surprising celebration not of life, but of death and the things that genuinely frighten us. I recommend Shadows And Teeth for fans of a good scare.\n\nThe Distance To The End\n\nMichael Aaron Casares\n\nSerasac Press\n\n9780692667835 $14.95\n\nhttp://www.serasacpress.com\n\nhttp://macasares.wix.com/home\n\nNicholas has just been reunited with his estranged lover when they are invited to go to Las Vegas. There they imbibe a lush and lavish lifestyle by friends whose newfound lottery wealth leads them to embark on a pleasure-filled and lavish whirlwind trip.\n\nAll is not hedonistic enjoyment, however, for embedded in this journey is the reunion and slow evolution of Raoul and Nick's relationship, the realities that are revealed when wealth strips away illusions and true desires are uncovered, and the injection and influence of drugs and fast living into the mix of interpersonal growth and connections.\n\nExpect a rollicking ride through drugs, Vegas, and the glittery attraction of self-indulgent and materialistic living (\"Fat Tuesdays would never run out of drink! They had enough booze and slush to last lifetimes, and we would see how many of those lifetimes we could go through before we ran out.\") set against the backdrop of a journey exploring the pathos and angst of modern America.\n\nFrom poetry and passion between men to coming to grips with life and self (\"When I began to take account for myself, I found a great peace because I could forgive everyone who'd transgressed me, or anyone I may have been angry at. I began to see a lesson in altercations, and they became less and less and less. I found myself more at peace, more at peace. I found it easy to let the energy flow; I didn't attach myself to things or people as much, though that isn't to say storms didn't brew, because when they did I let them blow over methodically.\") to the promises and possible failures of returning to a once-failed relationship to retry and jumpstart it, The Distance To The End offers a compelling journey into hope, awareness, empowerment, and ultimately, forgiveness.\n\nThe path to these places is what makes The Distance To The End shine in a revealing, passionate read that takes the glitzy impersonal backdrops of Vegas, sex, and relationships and elevates them to new levels as Nick winds his way through changed worlds only vaguely familiar from past encounters.\n\nHoly Mirage\n\nA. Aboud\n\nPublisher: A. Aboud\n\n0615636160, $0.99\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Holy-mirage-Aboud-ebook/dp/B007XSI6NA?ie=UTF8&keywords=holy%20mirge&qid=1462299304&ref_=sr_1_sc_1&s=books&sr=1-1-spell\n\nHoly Mirage is a book for any who have loved, lost, or found their faith misplaced or shattered - it's not for the true believer who harbor a faith unexamined. A. Aboud closely inspected the roots of his own faith, and Holy Mirage's opener outlines the results and moves on from there: \"On the day when I came to understand that there was no God, I cried. I cried because I loved God. I cried because I had been wrapped in the softness of his spirit. I cried because I knew that I would never find him waiting for me after death; I cried to awaken from such a pleasant dream. But, then, I wiped away my tears and made ready for the new day. On this day, I learned to face the trials of life with my own strength. After this, when I woke to face each morning, sometimes I would smile, and, sometimes, I would cry once more. But it doesn't matter. I will be rational. I will take the world as it is. And, most of all, I will be free.\"\n\nHoly Mirage offers more than an autobiographical account of this process. It considers how faith began, how it evolved into a doctrine that opened slowly and 'shyly' only to evolve into institution, judge and executioner all in one. Many wars have revolved around belief, atrocities have been committed in the name of conviction (or its perceived lack), and oftentimes, religious belief has redefined the nature of reality.\n\nHoly Mirage creates its analysis using plain language which may sound simple and accessible, but which is actually hard-hitting (to believers who may bristle at its contentions) and thought-provoking (to those who would question and think about the real contentions, outcomes and controversies surrounding faith): \"...the idea of God is an ancient carpet, borne aloft above the world by the winds of history. Its fabric, its color, its pattern - all are greatly changed by time and circumstance.\"\n\nChapters trace the history of this process from early to modern times, always with a critical eye towards showing how concepts evolved and were embraced, how different (and seemingly opposed) religions actually contributed to the evolution of not just their modern counterparts, but to society's perceptions and belief systems as a whole, and how much-embraced religious concepts represent extensions of human rituals and changes more than admonitions from above: \"...the idea of Jesus sacrificing himself for humanity is also an extension of these old rituals, in which, sometimes, even humans were offered up as sacrifices.\"\n\nFrom rituals of marriage and laws of worship processes to the real forces that dictate religious change (\"The terms of reality are reacting with each other in a dynamic and continuous way, and that's why there is always a new reality. Religions are a part of this reality, and are engaged with the other terms of reality. Despite the existence of a tendency in religion against progress, reality requires, over the years, that religions change.\"), Holy Mirage leaves no stone unturned and no cows sacred in its steady, relentless, and unerringly candid critique of how religions have changed (and have changed their believers) over the centuries and why discrepancies between religious law and human behavior have created disparities between institutions and those they were designed to oversee.\n\nAny who would think, question, and receive a different and critical angle on the nature and evolution of belief as a whole - whether it be Muslim, Christian, or otherwise - will find Holy Mirage an excellent, hard-hitting and highly recommended discussion, filled with carefully presented ideas cemented by history, philosophy, and insights into the nature of reality itself.\n\nFated Memories\n\nJoan Carney\n\nEastlake Publishing\n\nAmazon Digital Services LLC\n\nEbook: ASIN: B01CL4WAAK $3.99\n\nPaper: 9780692663868 $13.99\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Fated-Memories-Joan-Carney-ebook/dp/B01CL4WAAK\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Fated-Memories-Joan-Carney/dp/069266386X\n\nKitty is being transferred to a different section of the hospital where her ex works - and she's certain she can't do this. Her parents want her to live at home and go back to school to gain better skills that would lead her away from dead-end jobs, but Kitty has other ideas, and Fated Memories probes these choices which lead her from a limited world into the full blossoming of war.\n\nAs a timeslip saga blends with a girl's struggles to gain meaning from her life, Fated Memories brings with it a unique brand of time-travel lessons as it uses a journey into the past to reveal not just romance and war, but how meaning can be gleaned from everyday life, choices, and circumstances.\n\nIn the beginning, Kitty feels her options are very limited (\"If I quit the hospital I'll have to go back and live with my parents. I'm such a loser.\") while her good friend tries to make her see that adversity can translate to opportunity with just a small attitude adjustment (\"Life is all about changes that's what makes it interesting. You've always known you were too smart for that job. This is your chance to break free, turn the negative into a positive. Spread your wings. Grow.\"). Neither expected that such opportunity would come in a very different way, or that Kitty would find herself on the cusp of self-growth even as the world around her falls apart.\n\nWhere has the time gone, and what are her choices in navigating between two very different worlds? As Kitty finds within herself new resources she didn't know existed, she also hones a new purpose in life and a new set of abilities that brings with them not just adversity, but unexpected love.\n\nIs she really stuck in time and place, and does she really have choices? Fans of Time and Again and other timeslip romances and classics will love the twists and turns presented in Fated Memories, which provides a different kind of coming-of-age saga of growth and revelation.\n\nThe Vatican Protocol\n\nBrian Gallagher\n\nMirror Publishing\n\nhttp://www.vaticanprotocol.com\n\nhttp://www.vaticanprotocol.com/contact.html\n\n9781612253343, $15.95, www.amazon.com\n\nFans of intrigue rooted in religious tradition and history and steeped in the mysteries of sects, discoveries, and ancient texts will relish Brian Gallagher's The Vatican Protocol, a novel based on real events.\n\nSean O'Shea is researching clues pointing to alien life; but the last place he expects these clues to lead is to a cover-up involving the Vatican. His journey to a secret UFO crash site in Germany starts the clock ticking over the Vatican's most closely-held secret: one that will shake the foundations of religion, humanity, and perhaps reality itself.\n\nThe Vatican Protocol opens with a bang - the bang of a crashed aircraft in Germany - and creates a tense thriller that begins with events in 1936 and immediately moves to 2014, where Sean, who has lost nearly everything in a financial meltdown, has cultivated a goal-oriented approach to life that has returned his world to a semblance of stability.\n\nHis desire to probe mysteries and create a great book in the process leads to an obsession with history and supernatural forces that swirl into intrigue, death, and some hard truths that rival anything he could have dreamed about aliens and mankind.\n\nBlack operations groups, old wars between popes and Catholic hierarchies, heretics and philosophies challenged, and castles, labs, and dangerous discoveries all blend in a thriller centered on religious secrets.\n\nReaders will find The Vatican Protocol follows no predictable paths and involves an unusual kind of power struggle that sharply redefines Sean's life, purposes, and the extent he will travel in his search for the truth. There are many surprises along the way, embedding the story line with a progressively tense atmosphere to keep readers guessing about the truth.\n\nAny who have enjoyed The DaVinci Code and Indiana Jones adventures will find The Vatican Protocol a hard-hitting novel of intrigue and adventure whose protagonist crosses continents in a quest to reveal an increasingly challenging truth.\n\nThe Rose Within - A Gothic Romance\n\nSana Pirzada\n\nBook Empire\n\n9781911357001, $5.99 GBP, www.sanapirzada.com\n\nEnvision Henry James' classic Turn of the Screw melded with Bronte's Wuthering Heights with a touch of Jane Eyre thrown in to a novel of mystery and uncanny supernatural romance and you begin to get a taste for what's being served in The Rose Within, a delicious gothic romance that emphasizes elements of horror in a winding, subliminally appealing story line.\n\nThe time is the 1920s and the setting is England, but the protagonist is male - one Jonathan, whose infatuation with Selina draws him into her world at Winter Grange, an estate permeated by ghosts and mystery.\n\nIn great literary classics, time and place are well detailed. Using a similarly-compelling approach, Sana Pirzada blends a diary format and Jonathan's observations to capture, in exquisite description, the sensory impressions which bring this world alive: \"I remember seeing a long hallway with white marble floors and white Roman columns. White curtains of a sort of delicate, translucent fabric gently fluttered in the winds, and tiny bells chimed. In the background, I could hear one large bell ringing. It was a church bell, I was certain, and the purity of the mise en scene suggested this was the interior of a convent, perhaps somewhere in Italy. Amidst the muffled noises in the background, I faintly heard a Gregorian chant. The soft and sensual voices, combined with the sound of the subtle winds, built up to a gradual crescendo.\"\n\nDrawn in by setting, readers then receive a taste of mystery (\"There, standing in front of the altar, was the figure of a woman in a long, pure white dress, her head covered with a white hood. At first, I took her for a nun, but then she turned around and walked in the direction of the hallway; though her attire was graceful and noble, I realized it was not a nun's raiment. As she passed me, I smelled the sweet scent of roses, and when she lifted her sapphire eyes demurely, they glowed like fireflies in the night sky. Without thinking, I gently put my hand on her supple arm to feel whether she was real or a fairy. But she walked on as if I was never there, as if I had never existed.\"): one not just appropriate for its murky dream world, but which sets the stage for similar encounters presented in a different reality.\n\nThese are the kinds of devices great novels are made of: atmospheres of dread and evolving tragedy, a reflective inspection (via hindsight) of how events have transpired to reach this moment; and most of all, the urges of a man who longs for love and mystery outside of his circles of experience (\"I too have always dreamt of traveling to a faraway castle and encountering a mysterious supernatural being; reading of the isolated glaciers in Frankenstein, I too want to witness nature's deadly beauty and seclusion.\").\n\nPirzada admits an obsession with Phantom of the Opera, and elements of this passion and pathos are reflected in proceedings that swirl around Jonathan like a thick London fog; but to call The Rose Within a modern take on Phantom would be doing it a grave disservice.\n\nEmbedded in a rich tapestry of mystery, supernatural encounters and love is a story line that also features a spiral staircase into what might be the pits of Hell itself; and as readers follow the protagonist into these murky depths, unexpected encounters and tension give The Rose Within its own, uniquely powerful take on life, love, and everything in between these passions and the final throes of death.\n\nFans of supernatural fiction, romance, and gothic horror will find much to like in The Rose Within: its attention to atmosphere and detail will leave them riveted as Jonathan descends into horror on the journey of his life, with a first-person description blending observation and reflection creating a powerhouse of a read that's nearly impossible to put down, holding many surprise twists of plot throughout. A five-star production, The Rose Within is very highly recommended.\n\nFatal Formula\n\nA.J.

Why would he commit suicide when he seems to have everything?\n\nThe quick answer is: he didn't. But embedded within the question of how Dr. Mason died is the bigger question of who in the medical community might have had a reason to want him dead, and as puzzles increase and attention focuses on Henry's ground-breaking research, disparate and powerful forces coalesce to gain control of what will be one of the biggest discoveries in the history of medicine.\n\nFatal Formula is a riveting story that will appeal to fans of Robin Cook and other medical thrillers. It crosses the line into the mystery realm yet focuses on a discovery that could change the world and those forces that would do anything to control it.\n\nBut unlike many of these thrillers, which focus on discovery, treachery, and murder, Fatal Formula also includes the formulas of people's relationships, from their professional associations to their love lives, considering how these forces enter into the equation of innovation and confrontation.\n\nReaders who normally eschew some of the medical thrillers on the market for their formula approaches will find something different in A.J. Harris's production: a survey of the fundamental forces affecting forensic pathology resident and investigator, Dr. Sam Daviss life, an examination of romance, flings, and the primary foundations of lasting relationships, and a detailed examination of formulas for greed, success, love, and lives well lived.\n\nAs Dr. Sam Davis edges ever closer to a dangerous truth, so he uncovers the kind of relationship that will support rather than injure him - if he can navigate the obstacles that threaten to inject defeat and danger into a formula that negates success.\n\nDoes Dr. Henry's find promise miracles, or is it a recipe for disaster? And will Dr. Sam learn the difference in time? The result is a powerful, compelling, and revealing story line that adopts a winding, twisting approach through all kinds of possibilities and takes no linear path in its journey. It's the kind of medical mystery thriller that will keep readers guessing about love and loss right up to its unexpected conclusion.\n\nI Am Enough\n\nCheryl Miguel\n\nBalboa Press\n\nc/o Hay House, Inc.\n\nPO Box 5100, Carlsbad, CA 92018-5100\n\nwww.balboapress.com\n\nISBN: 9781504338561 (sc) $22.99\n\nISBN: 9781504338578 (hc) $39.95\n\nISBN: 9781504338554 (e) $6.99\n\nhttp://amzn.com/1504338561\n\nMost lives are a combination of pain and suffering juxtaposed with achievement and happiness; but for some, the weights fall more heavily on pain and loss. Such was the case for Cheryl Miguel, who found herself physically and emotionally in shambles after a series of onslaughts challenged her very will to survive against all odds.\n\nI Am Enough chronicles a descent into hell and back into enlightenment, and opens with the author's sudden fall. Alone and living on acreage far from anyone who could hear her cries for help, Miguel reflects on the circumstances which have brought her full circle from health to in a life affected and changed by lupus.\n\nHaving watched the same disease swallow up her father's hopes, dreams and life, Miguel is now besieged by a diagnosis that includes increasing disability, family challenges, and more. How does one rise from the ashes of disaster, divorce, and declining health?\n\nOne might expect the trials and tribulations, but what evolves from I Am Enough is more than hope: it's a description of the healing and enlightenment process that moves beyond physical and emotional challenges and into the realm of spirituality.\n\nAs Miguel opens up to new possibilities, she finds the course of her life changing in unexpected ways. The process involves asking basic questions (\"I understood life was always changing and our job was to go with the changes rather than resist them, but I continued to ask myself, How do I look forward if everyone is moving on except me?\") and how she finds the answers provides the core of a memoir that goes beyond struggle and into the process of finding meaning in all that occurs.\n\nCoping with chronic illness, the deaths of loved ones, and isolation, Miguel fights with those around her (\"It was lonely suffering with a chronic illness. Coping with it alone - the solitude - was crippling....I did have the girls. But for how much longer? As soon as their lives opened up, they would be gone. In a sense, they were trapped too. I feared my future a little more each day, knowing that I eventually burned people out, becoming nothing more than a burden.\") in an effort to battle the growing darkness seeping into her heart, body and soul.\n\nHow does a person evolve from this point? Where does one find strength for self, let alone family members? How do you move from being an observer in life to a participant?\n\nI Am Enough is about the process, the journey, and overcoming impossible physical and emotional obstacles. How Miguel defies not only the odds of living into her fifties with a chronic disease but learns to live well, absorbing new lessons of healing and enlightenment, makes for a powerful spiritual and psychological read especially recommended for others struggling with issues of dependence, independence, deteriorating health, and who want to learn the path of creating a well-lived life from the ashes of angst.\n\nCandor Candy: Global Poems\n\nHelene Pilibosian\n\nOhan Press\n\nwww.ohanpress.com\n\n9781530080861 $13.95\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Candor-Candy-Global-Helene-Pilibosian/dp/153008086X/ref=sr_1_1_twi_pap_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1464011687&sr=1-1&keywords=9781530080861\n\nWhat is a 'global poem'? Perhaps it's best to let poet Helene Pilibosian define her own genre: this opens the collection and leaves nothing to question about the purpose and poetic structures of her work: \"I hang a gauze curtain made of the verbs/from cultures all around the world./As it swings/lightly with every breeze,/it looks like a see-through image/to make sure Igor and Giovanni/can converse without anger.\"\n\nWith that intro, readers are off on a journey through different cultures and worlds in a poetic romp that \"...juggles French food,/Egyptian sun, gustatory glitches,/perfume of foreign trees/standing on a harvest of harbors.\"\n\nIn order to traverse this world and bring armchair readers along for the ride, it's essential to capture sensory experiences; and Pilibosian presents these images in spades, steeping readers in the sensual tea of European and world travels: \"Castles of kings welcomed her/as she bit the French language/like a crepe with its sauce.\"\n\nThis well-balanced poetic production explores not just sensory information, but plots, protagonists, and hearts and minds as well, as in the story of Here: \"She meets old friends in a restaurant/in a square called There,/in spite of tiny typos that dance around/like mosquitoes in the evening/and wrap words around her emotions.\"\n\nPeppered atop the production like sprinkles on icing are social commentaries, interpersonal interactions, and reflections on the dance that is life itself, journeying ever further on the trajectory of foreign soils and experiences: \"His youth took her hand/and sprinkled its demands/all around the world/on a dizzying circumference:/the curl of Shell Oil,/the curve of a nose,/the verve of an African harvest,/the deserving Italian phrase.\"\n\nIn any successful poetry collection, it's the journey that counts.

The stars and planets are next on the journey, and narrative poet Helene Pilibosian is just the pilot to take readers there in Planet Tome Reborn, a driving dervish of a production that follows a family who journeys to Earth, there to explore love, life, and immigrant dreams from Boston to beyond: \"My heels have/a Cambridge and Boston ring./They sputter, try to tell/a story that is/too long, too edgy for feet/that want to be free/to cross the boundaries/for a social pun or two.\"\n\nPlanet Tome Reborn is more centered in living and observing this daily life than her Candor Candy production, and after taking the whirlwind world tour offered there, presents both a celebration of homebodies and an observational piece on the lure of local places from a true foreigner's perspective: \"I set the table again/for the din of discussions/on repercussions of the recession./The waiter floated the meal/that featured roasted new year/with sauce of coffee quotes/and the latest in jollity.\"\n\nJust as immigrants rebirth themselves under new conditions, reflect their cultural origins, and remake their lives, so the observer in Planet Tome Reborn deconstructs the ironies and inconsistencies of the human race and concocts a formula for love and acceptance that embraces both worlds: \"I turn on the radio - /intergalactic to be sure - /to flood the atmosphere/with the notes of Mozart...\"\n\nWhile the poem 'For Sunflower Sanity' explains much of the sci-fi setting of this collection (even though it appears much later), readers will have gleaned much from the Tome pieces before this point, and even newcomers without prior familiarity with Helene Pilibosian's otherworldly creation will appreciate both its narrative approach and attention to building the details of an immigrant's melding of experiences.\n\nFans of the poetic narrative format who relish evocative imagery and unexpected word constructions will recognize Planet Tome Reborn as an outstanding example of how two very different worlds collide and blend.\n\n90 Lessons for Living Large in 90 Square Feet (...or more)\n\nFelice Cohen\n\nDividends Press\n\n9781500657857 $10.00\n\nWebsite: https://www.felicecohen.com\n\nOrdering Link: http://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Living-Large-Square-Feet-ebook/dp/B01CM3XU0E\n\nAuthor Felice Cohen lived in New York City in a 90-square-foot abode; a feat which demanded a high level of organization and a clutter-less approach to life. The last thing she planned to do was produce a book based on her ability to live in such a space; but 90 Lessons for Living Large in 90 Square Feet (...or more) evolved from a demand to know how this was achieved, in response a YouTube video profile of her tiny accommodation, and her book will be an invaluable map for any who would do the same.\n\nThat Cohen struck a nerve with her achievement and the downsizing of her dreams was evident when the video of her place took off: \"After five years of living in a tiny space on the fifth floor of a former tenement building on the Upper West Side, I had arrived at the same conclusion: I had grown accustomed to an independence from stuff. Along the way, my fantasies of \"one day\" living in a large home with a voluminous foyer illuminated by skylights, had changed too. Instead, they were now of living with just the space I actually needed, preferably near a bike path. When I eventually showcased that independence - an"
