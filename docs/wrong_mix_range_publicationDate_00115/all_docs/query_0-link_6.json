        "text": "… Or why EU fans and Star Wars.com are equally annoying.\n\nThe sudden passing of Dave Wolverton on January 14, had many star warriors reminiscing about the first time they ever read his 1994 novel, The Courtship of Princess Leia. Around the same time Star Wars.com published an article called Star Wars Inside Intel: The Nightsisters. Written by Emily Shkoukani, a member of the Lucasfilm Story Group (whose job is to “know as much about a galaxy far, far away as possible”), the article committed this original sin:\n\n“Making their canon debut in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated television series the Nightsisters were eccentric witches residing on the distant, rocky world of Dathomir. In the show’s episode aptly titled “Nightsisters,” fans first encountered the mystifying culture of these witches.”\n\nThis got many EU fans in a tizzy for ignoring the fact that Dave Wolverton created the Nightsisters and the planet Dathomir first and they expressed their grievances on Twitter, prompting the author to update her article and apologize for the error.\n\nPredictably, this glaring error, also brought out the knives on Dave Filoni and the Clone Wars cartoon for “butchering” the EU.\n\nYes, it was stupid and lazy on Lucasfilm’s part to ignore the contributions Wolverton gave to Star Wars (and considering that the author lists her pronouns as they/she, this should come as no surprise) especially on the heels of his death. But does that give fans the right to bash Filoni at the same time for re-introducing the force-wielding witches to a wider audience? No. George Lucas created and produced Star Wars: The Clone Wars, he has the right to override the EU if he wants to, Clone Wars was around long before Disney got its mitts on the franchise and it was butchered by Disney just as much as the Expanded Universe was.\n\nAnd in a twist of irony it gives Filoni too much credit when the person who wrote all the Nightsisters episodes was Katie Lucas, daughter of George. It’s no different from what StarWars.com did to Wolverton. Besides, in a 2014 interview for the 20th anniversary of TCOPL, Wolverton had this to say:\n\nSo it appears Wolverton was happy to see his creation on The Clone Wars and was looking forward to seeing more onscreen depictions of Nightsisters. Maybe if Lucas were still in charge, we would’ve eventually seen more of the Singing Mountain Clan in upcoming shows, video games and action figures.\n\nWell, now that we got that out of the way, let’s take this hated, updated article and improve on it by rewriting it with EU and CW references. My “article” will mostly focus on standout moments and characters from the franchise. If you want a more detailed, in-depth article about the Nightsisters, head on over to Wookieepedia (and click on the Legends tab, if you so choose).\n\nStar Wars Inside Intel: The Nightsisters\n\nMeet the Witches of Dathomir\n\nby The Lady From Planet X\n\nMaking their first appearance in the 1994 Legends novel The Courtship of Princess Leia by the late Dave Wolverton, the Nightsisters were force sensitive magick practicing witches (yes, according to George, the Force and magic exist in the same universe, which is why the jedi are not “space wizards”) hailing from the planet Dathomir. In chapter 2, page 19, Luke Skywalker discovers an old holo vid of a young Master Yoda describing the failed rescue of “Chu’unthor from Dathomir”:\n\n“Artoo”, Luke said. “Run through your astrogation files and tell me if you find any reference to a place named Dathomir. It could be a star system, a single planet…” Maybe even a person, he thought with dismay.\n\nArtoo took a moment, then whistled a negative. “I thought not,” Luke said. I’ve never heard of it, either.” During the Clone Wars, so many planets had been destroyed, made uninhabitable. Perhaps Dathomir was one of those, a world so ravaged that it had been forgotten.\n\nConveniently, Luke’s question would be answered when a lovesick Han Solo wins Dathomir in a card game and kidnaps Leia to the mysterious planet. There, Han and Leia encounter the Singing Mountain Clan, a tribe of force-sensitive Amazons (who more than likely represent the Light Side of the Force) and their enemies, The Nightsisters, who are, in Han’s words, “their sith”.\n\n“The Nightsisters have come for General Solo and the other offworlders. We captured them first, and by all right they belong to us!”\n\n“If you want to interrogate General Solo, then perhaps I can help you. General Solo, why did you come to Dathomir?” Augwynne’s eyes flashed to the pouch at Han’s belt and he took the cue.\n\n“I own this planet and everything on it,” Han said. “I came to check out my real estate.”\n\nAs one of the Nightsisters began hissing, shaking their heads, and Baritha spat, “A man claims to own Dathomir?”\n\nHan fumbled in his pouch for the deed, found the box and pressed its switch. The holo of Dathomir appeared in the air above his palm, his name clearly registered as owner.\n\n“No!” Baritha shouted, waving her hand. The box flew from Han’s grip, tumbled to the floor.\n\n“That’s right,” Han said, I own this world, and I want you and your Nightsisters off my planet!”\n\nBaritha glared at him. “Gladly,” she said. “Provide us a ship, and we will leave.” – chapter 14, pg 179\n\nTrailing Han and Leia to the planet, Luke and Leia’s suitor, Prince Isolder, are also captured by the Singing Mountain Clan and – long story short (seriously, just read the book, it’s really good) – together they battle the Nightsisters.\n\nThis novel introduced the Nightsister character of Gethzerion, who would later make an appearance in Star Wars Galaxies.\n\nHowever, in the next year, all this would get retconned… sort of.\n\nIn 1995, Bantam Spectra, the same company that published TCOPL, published Kevin J. Anderson’s The Illustrated Star Wars Universe, a sort of textbook/travelogue “written” by historians and poets about the history and ecology of the planets of the Original Trilogy.\n\nAccording to this source book, the witch Charal (played by Sian Phillips) from the 1985 TV movie, Ewoks: The Battle For Endor was the first introduction of a Nightsister. In the book, an Imperial sergeant by the name of Pfilbee Jhorn writes:\n\n“Charal, is a female shape-shifter, a Force-wielding witch who apparently escaped from her exile on a planet called Dathomir.”\n\nNearly executed for stealing the Talisman of the Raven for its shapeshifting powers, Charal escaped from Dathomir and joined the Sanyassan Maurauders. She was made second-in-command to the warlord Terak and they ended up on Endor where they encountered Cindel Towani, Noa Briqualon and the Ewoks. In the end, she was turned into a raven permanently when Wicket destroyed the talisman.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that Dave Filoni was considering including Charal in the show, but for some reason, it didn’t happen. However, she’s mentioned Daniel Wallace’s Book of Sith: Secrets From the Dark Side (2012).\n\nIn the same year, Anderson wrote another book where Luke would confront another Nightsister again, this time to rescue his niece and nephew. Young Jedi Knights: Shadow Academy introduced readers to Tamith Kai, a Nightsister who teamed up with a fallen jedi named Brakiss to “recruit” force sensitive youths into the Shadow Academy to be “trained” into Dark Jedi. Tamith Kai is hilariously defeated when the practical Tenel Ka, daughter of Prince Isolder, responds to Kai’s Force powers with a swift kick to the knee.\n\nBy now you’ve noticed that the Nightsisters are depicted as human looking with a pale complexion. All that would change in the late ’90s and early ’00s.\n\nThe “Sith Witch”\n\nDuring the making of The Phantom Menace, Lucas told concept artist Ian McCaig to design a person from “your worst nightmare”. One of the sketches would later become known as the “Sith Witch”, a woman dressed in red robes with a black and white type of “rorschach pattern” on her face.\n\nThis design was rejected by Lucas for the movie, but would later appear in The Dark Side Sourcebook of the 2001 Star Wars Roleplaying Game.\n\nAnother concept sketch that would be rejected and then recycled was Dermot Power’s “female apprentice to Count Dooku”.\n\nBut we’ll get to her in a minute.\n\nOn January 7, 2011, fans finally got to see the Nightsisters come to life in The Clone Wars season 3 episode titled, aptly, “Nightsisters”. It turns out that Asajj Ventress, who already made a name for herself in Dermot Power’s sketches, Clone Wars comics and books and Genndy Tartakovsky’s 2003 Clone Wars animated shorts, hailed from this eccentric coven – although her upbringing largely differed from her sisters.\n\nDathomir is depicted in The Clone Wars with sprawling rockscapes consisting of canyons, caves and cliffs (this is why when Prince Isolder saw Tenenial Djo nude for the first time, he noticed how muscular her back looked from lots of rock climbing). The flora and fauna aren’t too particularly friendly either. Fungus and fire lichen grow abundantly and native to the planet is the Rancor, used as mounts for the Nightsisters.\n\nThe Nightsisters’ magick was dark in nature, and Jedi that found themselves on their world often described feeling the presence of the dark side. Although their understanding of it was unique to their world and culture, the magick the sisters wielded was seemingly connected to the Force — just used in a vastly different way than the Jedi or the Sith. Where those groups followed strict dogmas and used the Force in (arguably) more simple ways such as pushing and pulling objects/beings or levitating, the Nightsisters used their magick to cast spells, perform rituals, and brew potions.\n\nWhen Asajj Ventress returned to her home world seeking guidance, her sisters bathed her in the glowing-green Water of Life in a ritual inducting her into their clan. Later, Mother Talzin, the leader of the clan, brewed a potion that allowed Asajj and a few of her sisters to become transparent — almost invisible — in order to perform a stealth mission.\n\nThe Nightsisters also used another form of their magick in rituals conducted following the death of one of their own. When a Nightsister passed, her clan took great care of the body, wrapping it in cloth soaked in the planet’s magickal waters and reciting a spell of protection for their fallen sister. They were then placed in a burial pod that would be hung from a Grave Thorn, a warped and twisted, barbed tree native to the planet.\n\nThough it appeared that the Witches of Dathomir ruled the planet, like most humanoid species, these women still needed males to reproduce. While The Singing Mountain Clan often captured men as mates, the Nightsisters had male counterparts in the form of the Nightbrothers, subservient to the witches. The two sects of natives lived and operated in separate areas of the planet, the Nightsisters calling on the brothers when needed. When Asajj’s original assassination plan failed with the use of the invisibility potion, Mother Talzin organized a competition amongst a selection of Nightbrothers. They fought in gladiatorial-style trials before one, Savage Opress, edged out the competition. He was then tasked to aid Asajj in her quest to exact revenge on her former teacher, Count Dooku. Whereas the Nightsisters wielded magick, the Nightbrothers were warriors. After Savage was selected to assist Asajj, Mother Talzin and the Nightsisters used their magicks to enhance Savage’s physical strength, putting him under a spell that forced him to obey their directions.\n\nMother Talzin was among the strongest witches in her clan, and served as their leader. She was a master at her arcane abilities, with the Nightsisters seeking her guidance. She was also responsible for handling any relations with the galaxy, such as when the malevolent Darth Sidious, an ally of Talzin’s, came to Dathomir and saw the potential in one of the young Nightbrothers. Talzin released the child to Sidious, who raised him as his Sith apprentice, and became known as Darth Maul (note: this happened in the James Luceno Legends novel, Darth Plagueis).\n\nAfter the many attempts Asajj made to have her former master, Count Dooku, executed to get revenge against him for abandoning her, Dooku turned his attention to the Nightsisters. With the Separatist army at his disposal, Dooku ordered General Grievous and his battle droids to the twisted planet of Dathomir to eradicate the galaxy of Nightsisters. But the Nightsisters would not go down without a fight.\n\nWith the guidance of Mother Talzin and the power of their dark magicks, the Nightsisters retaliated against the Separatist droids. Talzin went so far as to raise the dead, awakening deceased Nightsisters from their long slumber to aid the living in their attempt to avoid extinction. But despite their power and abilities, Talzin’s Nightsister clan met its demise. All but a few were slain, but their legacy carried on in those that remained.\n\nMy final entry here is Dark Disciple, a 2015 novel penned by Christie Golden, that was originally going to be an eight-part story arc on The Clone Wars before cancellation. After the massacre of her sisters and her betrayal by Count Dooku, Asajj spends the rest of her days as a bounty hunter. With the Jedi Order more determined than ever to have Dooku killed, they turn to his former apprentice for help by teaming her up with Jedi Master Quinlan Vos on a mission to assassinate the sith lord. You can guess how well that turns out. Long story short (seriously, read the book, its really good. Its arguably the only good novel from the new Star Wars canon), Ventress is killed in the process. Vos and Obi-Wan Kenobi (who now views Ventress as an ally) lay Asajj’s body in a dark pool at an abandoned Nightsister village on Dathomir. To the awe of the two jedi, the pool turns green at the touch of her body and the voices of the deceased Nightsisters are heard, welcoming Ventress back.\n\nSo there you have it. A herstory of the Nightsisters. What are your favorite memories of these creepy cool gals? Did you ever cosplay as a Nightsister? Do you own a Mother Talzin action figure? Let me know in the comments.\n\nFor Dave Wolverton (1957-2022), the Original Nightbrother.\n\nOh what a tangled web we weave.\n\nFirst there was that live action Beauty and the Beast (which got more award nominations than it deserved).\n\nThen Dumbo flopped.\n\nThen there was the lukewarm response to Aladdin.\n\nThen there was that Twitter “flame war” (if that’s the right word) over Halle Bailey’s casting as Ariel in the upcoming Little Mermaid remake.\n\nThen there was another “flame war” over the teaser trailer for Mulan because Mushu, Li Shang, nor any of the songs, won’t appear in the live action 2020 film.\n\nAnd now early reviews for The Lion King are coming in and… oh boy, why am I not surprised?\n\nI think we, the audience, are partly to blame for this since we’re the ones that made Maleficent, Cinderella, The Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast successful. That (partly) made Disney think: “see we can just remake our classic film catalog, make it more PC and we’ll still make money!”\n\nIt also doesn’t help when you get this:\n\nClick on the tweet and you’ll learn that the original film “offended” Chinese audiences with its humor and “lack of respect for Chinese culture”. So apparently Disney is trying to “get it right” (Never mind that China released a film about Mulan in 2009). Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t Mulan a legend who never existed? I remember reading in The Art of Mulan that when Disney animators went to China, the locals couldn’t agree on which province Mulan came from or which time period the story originated.\n\nMulan means a lot to me. I remember seeing a preview of the film when Hercules was released on video in early 1998.\n\nThe moment I saw this trailer I knew this movie was for me. I knew Disney was breaking barriers and leaving its comfort zone. I knew Mulan would be unlike any other Disney heroine before or since and I knew I HAD to see this movie. And I did. Twice. In theaters (a feat I wouldn’t repeat until Wonder Woman). I checked out the official soundtrack from the library multiple times. Bought Mulan toys. Drew Mulan characters like crazy. It’s my favorite Disney film of all time. Mulan resonated with me not because of her ethnicity or her culture but because she was a woman finding her way in a sexist society, something all women could relate to regardless of color, class, country or time period.\n\nSo why am I upset about this live action Mulan?\n\nBecause it shows laziness on Disney’s part.\n\nIt saddens me that people are coming to the defense of a multi-media corporation’s uninspired decisions all in the name of “representation” and “diversity”. How is casting a black singer in a fairy tale based in 19th century Denmark supposed to be a win for representation when there are plenty of stories from around the world that could use a wider audience and meatier roles for people of color? Why make a live action Mulan when you can adapt another legend of a Chinese or Asian heroine? Let’s look at some fairy/folk tales & legends that need a film adaptation. Take notes Disney.\n\nMufaro’s Beautiful Daughters\n\nI grew up with John Steptoe’s 1987 award-winning adaptation of this Zimbabwean tale about two sisters whose differing personalities are put to the test when a king announces that he’s looking for a wife. This story has been featured on Reading Rainbow and has beautiful illustrations that still hold up to this day.\n\nThe Rough Face Girl\n\nI was introduced to this Algonquin tale by the PBS show Storytime and I never forgot it. Similar to Mufaro’s Beautiful Daughters, it tells the story of a man with three eligible daughters who are invited to meet another eligible bachelor with special powers but must past some tests. The difference here is that of the three sisters, only two are beautiful but the third sister, has skin that’s been damaged over the years. But as we all know, true beauty lies within.\n\nAida\n\nThis is the role I’d like to see Halle Bailey play. Did you know that Disney was planning on making an animated film based on Verdi’s opera about the titular Ethiopian princess? Did you know that they owned the rights to the picture book written by the Leontyne Price? And did you know they wanted Elton John to write the music? Alas, Sir Elton didn’t want to do another animated film, so they gave him the option of doing a Broadway musical instead. It went on to win 4 Tony Awards and one Grammy. I think it’s time Disney brought their musical to the big screen (with a happy ending of course). More info can be found here. I, for one, would love the idea of adding Ethiopian and Egyptian princesses to the Disney Princess roster, don’t you?\n\nThe Woman Who Outshone The Sun Beautiful Lucia Zenteno is special. She has a skirt covered with butterflies and animals love her, but the villagers fear her and drive her away. Unfortunately, the river leaves with her and the village has no water supply. Will they apologize to Lucia?\n\nThe Maid Who Braved The Deep\n\nI will retell this Japanese story, word for word, from the TIME LIFE book, The Enchanted World: Dragons. Her story was also told in Robert San Souci’s book, The Samurai’s Daughter (note: he was also a consultant and storywriter for Mulan).\n\nLong ago, an Emperor banished a famous warrior to the Oki Islands, in the storm-wracked Sea of Japan. The reason for the punishment is not known. The offense may well have been a minor one, for the Emperor suffered greatly from an illness that had come upon him suddenly, and his temper was uncertain. In any case, the samurai was taken guard to the place of exile. He left behind a daughter, Tokoyo, who was as pretty as a chrysanthemum and as strong as the steel of her father’s sword.\n\nShe mourned, but she was a brave young woman, and soon she set out to find her father. For weeks Tokoyo traveled alone along the coast of the great island of Honshu, until she came to Hoki Province in the north. From the rocks there she could see, faint in the sea mist, the silhouette of the isle where her father was imprisoned. But she could find no sailor or fisherman to take her across the water, because it was well known that the Oki Islands were haunted by dragons.\n\nNight fell, and in the concealing darkness, Tokoyo stole a small fishing boat. She rowed the little craft through the waves for hours. The moon set, the sun rose, and still she rowed. Not until late the next day did she reach her next destination. Leaving the boat on the rocky shore, Tokoyo followed a path to a road cut into the coastal cliffs. She came to a shrine and there she lay down and slept.\n\nOn the following morning, faint sounds of weeping awakened her. At once she scrambled to her feet and followed the road to its end on a windy headland, where she discovered a piteous scene.\n\nAt the edge of the cliff, high above the seething sea, stood a maiden robed in white, and near her knelt two aged people – her parents. They were sobbing uncontrollably. Behind them stood a priest, his head bowed.\n\nIt was a sacrifice, the priest explained. Each year the people of that island gave a maiden to the dragon Yofune – Nushi, ruler of the deep and bringer of storms, and the offering held off the tempests the creature could send.\n\nImpulsively, the Tokoyo offered to take the maiden’s place. She put on the ceremonial white kimono, clasped a warrior’s dagger between her teeth and, without hesitation, leaped into the boiling waves.\n\nDown through the green depths she plummeted, swimming as strongly as she had in her childhood, when she dived with the pearl fishers of her own province. She neared the sea bottom, and there she found a cave mouth. Beside it was a curiosity – a wooden statue of the Emperor who had banished her father. And streaming from the opening was an undulating serpent with dagger-like claws and luminous scales.\n\nIt glided swiftly toward her, eyes alight with fury and anticipation. Tokoyo struck at it. She thrust her dagger into one of the creature’s eyes. Half-blinded, the dragon lashed at her clumsily. The woman struck again. Then the end came quickly. The dragon sank to the ocean floor, its coils slowly stirred by the tide.\n\nCharged with a greater-than-mortal strength, the dragon-slayer grasped the serpent with one hand and the statue with the other and kicked her way back to the surface.\n\nWhen the priest and the others saw her head appear above the waves, they ran down to the shore and stretched out helping hands.\n\nThe ending of the tale was wonderful and strange. Tokoyo was taken with her prizes to the lord of that island, who greatly honored her bravery. He sent messengers to the Emperor about her feat and thus discovered the meaning of the statue. When the image, which had been cursed and thrown to the sea god, was removed from the water, the Emperor’s illness disappeared. In his gratitude, the ruler reunited the woman and her father and brought them back to their homeland.\n\nAnd from then on, the city of Edo was renamed Tokyo in honor of the Maid Who Braved The Deep.\n\nGordafarid from The Shanameh\n\nGordafarid is the most famous heroine of Hakim Abu I-Qasim Firdawsi Tusi’s epic poem. In it she faces off in battle against Sohrab, commander of the Turanian army and held back his troops from invading Persia. I first heard about her in Marjane Satrapi’s graphic novel, Perepolis and learned that she is an icon to Iranian women. So of course I will include her.\n\nThe Twelve Dancing Princesses\n\nBefore Frozen‘s release, many news media outlets kept pointing out that this was Disney’s first film with two princesses. Well here’s a story about twelve sisters who disappear every night to go dancing and the young man (on orders from their father) follows them to investigate. It’s about clubbing and raves before clubbing and raves happened. Think of the catchy songs Disney could come up with! And here’s a chance for each princess to be a different ethnicity (they don’t have to be sisters, just BFFs). That way everyone’s happy!\n\nDo you know of any stories from other cultures that you’d like to see on the big screen? Do you think there are better roles for Halle Bailey and Liu Yifei? Drop a suggestion or tell a story in the comments.\n\nSince the cancellation of the Star Wars Expanded Universe, fandom response to Disney’s new Star Wars novel timeline has been lukewarm to say the least. For me the only exception is Christie Golden’s Dark Disciple and that was based on an unproduced script from the then-canceled Clone Wars show (now that the show’s been “renewed”, does that mean the book is no longer canon? Does that make it a “novelization”?). Well now I can add another exception.\n\nI’ve just finished reading E.K. Johnston’s novel Queen’s Shadow and dear Star Warriors, I loved every minute of it. It manages to answer all the questions we’ve been asking for the past 20 years about Padme’s career between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones while still respecting the movies, the Clone Wars and the Legends timeline. It passes the torch from Amidala’s royal handmaidens to her senatorial handmaidens. And – most importantly – it tastefully introduces diversity to the Galaxy Far Far Away without virtue signaling.\n\nFor those of you irritated with current Star Wars authors (and we know who they are), this is the book for you, even if you prefer Legends, like me. In fact it renewed my love of Star Wars reading, because I’m finally reading Heir to the Empire.\n\nFour years after The Phantom Menace, Naboo is electing a new monarch while Padme and her handmaidens: Sabe, Sache, Yane, Eirtae and Rabe, are enjoying a swim at a lake retreat (perhaps the same one she described to Anakin in AOTC?). This is the last time all six young women have together as Queen and Handmaidens as the girls go their separate ways thinking about what to do next with their lives. Also present is Captain Panaka – who plans on retiring – and his wife, Mariek – who plans to take over as Padme’s Captain of the Guard. Before you ask, yes, Typho shows up later in the book but as a sergeant.\n\nPadme is unsure where her future lies in the world of Naboo politics, until the newly elected Queen, Reillata, asks her to serve as Senator for Naboo. She accepts the offer but learns that the transition from Queen to Senator is not as easy as it seems. She tries her hand at freeing Tatooine slaves but fails at locating Shmi Skywalker. In her first meeting with Bail Organa she’s nearly killed in an assassination attempt (the first of many). Due to her role in ousting Valorum as Chancellor, many see her as Palpatine’s lapdog. And the Galactic media still sees her as the naive, aloof Queen from Naboo. She’s going to need a lot of allies. Good thing she has her loyal handmaidens to help her. While Sache, Yane, Eirtae and Rabe go their separate ways, Sabe continues to serve as Padme’s “secret agent” and decoy, while the novel introduces us to Padme’s senatorial handmaidens: Dorme, Verse and Corde.\n\nIf you’re a big fan of Amidala’s handmaidens, then this is definitely the book for you. Let’s not kid ourselves here: as much as I love Legends, the backstories of the handmaidens, the Queens of Naboo and Queen Breha Organa of Alderaan are regrettably sparse. Compare the Legends and the Canon entries for Naboo monarchs on Wookiepedia. The book also reveals some interesting details about the Queen’s wardrobe and Naboo politics. Senators Mina Bonteri and Rush Clovis from The Clone Wars also make an appearance. It’s interesting how Johnston uses the theme of duality to highlight Padme’s relationships to Bonteri and Mothma, foreshadowing the sides both women take in the Clone Wars conflict.\n\nHowever (and there’s always a however), I have two minor complaints. One chapter ends with a passionate makeout scene (but no sex) between Sabe and Captain Tonra (the previously unnamed Naboo Royal Pilot played by Richard Armitage) that I felt was a little too inappropriate for a Star Wars novel. Yes, there’s been some sexy scenes in previous novels (see Shadows of the Empire), but this felt a little too much for a novel aimed at teens and was unnecessary.\n\nAnother complaint isn’t in the novel but on the last page, and this may be a deal breaker for some. In the acknowledgements: Johnston thanks the Lucasfilm Story Group and design team. “Natalie Portman, Keira Knightley and Trisha Biggar, who gave me the best fifteenth birthday present ever, and Cat Taber, who kept it going.” And every girl “who ever asked for more from Star Wars”.\n\nYet the one important person Johnston never thanks is George Lucas and that’s a big no-no. Every writer before her (In the EU at least) always gave a shout out to Lucas for creating Star Wars and “allowing them to play in his sandbox”. I think I’ll have to e-mail Johnston’s publisher a complaint about this oversight.\n\nBut despite these setbacks, I hope Queen’s Shadow will be the beginning of a Padme rehabilitation in pop culture that leads to more Padme appreciation. Purchases of this book may convince Lucasfilm and Disney that there are #PeopleForPadme because…\n\nWe are brave Your Highness."
