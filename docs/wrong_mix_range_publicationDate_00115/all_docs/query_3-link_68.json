        "text": "David Wolverton, who was better known to some of his fans as Dave Farland, has passed away aged 64, after an accident in his own home. He suffered a fall down his stairs on the morning of January 13, 2022, and hit his head. He suffered a hemorrhagic stroke with bleeding around his brainstem which had left him comatose and on life support.\n\nHi son, Spencer, used the David Farland Entertainent official Facebook account to share the sad news.\n\nJohn David Wolverton was born May 30, 1957 in Monroe, Oregon, USA. He started writing short stories in 1985, while at college. He quickly became an established award winning author who penned many novels, including Star Wars Legends books, The Courtship of Princess Leia, The Rising Force and The Hidden Past in the late 90’s. In recent years he had taken to lecturing and passing on his immense knowledge of the industry to those starting out on their own careers.\n\nMany fans have enquired if they may be able to help Wolverton’s family and a further update from Spencer was posted a few hours ago.\n\nTributes have been flooding in on Social Media and all the team here at Jedi News are deeply saddened by this news. We would like to extend our condolences to his family and friends at this difficult time."
