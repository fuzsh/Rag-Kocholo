        "text": "Detective Elija Baley doesn‚Äôt like robots very much. They act weird, they take people‚Äôs jobs. I bet they smell too. Earth has strict rules about robots, but the Outer Worlds don‚Äôt have such scruples. When an Outer World ambassador gets murdered, Baley is less than happy to hear that his Commissioner teams him up with a robot partner to investigate. Baley‚Äôs headache is bound to get worse when his robot partner becomes a prime suspect in the murder.\n\nEven though Asimov‚Äôs book is the first SF-detective crossover ever, it is not just simply a detective story with a robot in it. Asimov takes the effort to really flesh out this future world. The title The Caves of Steel has more to do with the future world than with robots. Robots are just the start of it. For instance, people struggle with how complicated the world has become and turn ‚Äúmedievalist‚Äù. There‚Äôs tension now that Earth itself is a backwater world among fifty other planets, which are healthier and richer. Baley himself is worried that a robot will replace him. Much of this sounds familiar in the 21st century. (Except the fifty planets, unfortunately üò• )\n\nI think it is a funny idea that the robots all get the prefix R. in the story, instead of Mr. or Mrs. There‚Äôs an R. Sammy walking around the police office, and Baley‚Äôs partner is R. Daneel Olivaw. (Makes me suspect that writer R. Scott Bakker is in fact a robot.) It‚Äôs just a subtle sign that humanity is adapting to having robots in their midst.\n\nThroughout the story, Baley struggles with his professional relationship with R. Daneel Olivaw. Baley is used to the robot Sammy who walks around the office with an inane smile on his face, but Daneel Olivaw is a more advanced robot and can blend in with the human crowd. The more human Olivaw looks, the harder it is to accept non-human behaviour from him. And, whenever he does something right, Baley feels humiliated, as if he is about to be replaced by a robot.\n\nI liked this one quite a bit and got a lot out of it.\n\nThe detective story is just the backdrop. It‚Äôs about racism, about Baley‚Äôs prejudice, about two cultures clashing, about economic reforms, Malthusian growth and technological progress. That‚Äôs a lot of themes to squeeze into a short little novel. The detective story itself is rather mediocre, really, but it is only a vehicle for all these themes. The Caves of Steel is also an extension of the short stories of I, Robot (1950), including, more than anything, the Three Laws of Robotics. Those Three Laws worked as a thought experiment, a funny logic puzzle to figure out why robots behave weirdly even with these laws in place. In The Caves of Steel just so.\n\nSome futuristic ideas about the city are like a comic-book version of the future, not out of place in, say, The Jetsons, but Asimov doesn‚Äôt hold it up as something admirable. Detective Baley‚Äôs culture is a sociological dead end, and so are the Outer Worlds. The solutions are all tied to Baley‚Äôs investigation. But detective Baley is stuck between worlds. He‚Äôs a very change-averse man, with a disdain for anything new and distrust about anything Spacer related. Yet to solve his case he needs to overcome his own prejudices; try on other ways of thinking.\n\nIt‚Äôs great to see this gradual change in Baley. Him trying to adjust to R. Daneel Olivaw is simultaneously an effort to adjust to new technology and to adopt the views of another culture. There are parallels between these struggles that I never really thought about. It is an optimistic novel. A spirited defence for a lot of things, for rationality, for overcoming prejudice, for technological progress, for being in touch with nature and having things to aim for as a culture.\n\nYes, Asimov‚Äôs writing can be bland and dry on a sentence level, and he can‚Äôt write women, but he has an optimism, an understanding of humanity and a celebratory vision of science that always impresses me.\n\n7,5/10"
