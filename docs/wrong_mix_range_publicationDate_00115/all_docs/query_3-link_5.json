        "text": "David Farland was an award-winning, international best-selling author with over 60 novels still in print. Published in over 20 languages. Dave wrote science fiction as Dave Wolverton, and in fantasy his pseudonym David Farland.\n\nFarland wrote for major franchises such as Star Wars and his own bestselling works including The Runelords, Of Mice and Magic, and On My Way To Paradise. He won the 1987 Writers of the Future Contest, and has been nominated for a Nebula Award and a Hugo Award.\n\nAs a writing instructor, Farland mentored dozens who have gone on to staggering literary success, including such #1 New York Times Bestsellers as Brandon Mull (Fablehaven), Brandon Sanderson (Wheel of Time), and Stephenie Meyer (Twilight).\n\nFarland judged L. Ron Hubbard’s Writers of the Future, the largest worldwide writing competition for new fantasy and science fiction authors. He worked in Hollywood greenlighting movies and doctoring scripts. He set the Guinness World Record for the largest single-author, single-book signing. He has been hailed as “the wizard of storytelling” and his work has been called “compelling,” “engrossing,” “powerful,” “profound,” and “ultimately life-changing.”"
