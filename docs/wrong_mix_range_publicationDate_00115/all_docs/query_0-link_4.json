        "text": "Star Wars Missions 14: The Monsters of Dweem is the fourteenth adventure book in the Star Wars Missions young-reader series and roleplaying game. It was published by Scholastic in October 1998.\n\nPublisher's summary[]\n\nThe monsters of Dweem do not take any prisoners. They are the color of ice, and can appear at any moment with their jagged teeth bared. You are an Imperial soldier who has traveled to Dweem in search of Han Solo and his Rebel friends. You will be lucky to get off the planet alive. Your mission: to trap the Rebels before the monsters of Dweem trap you.\n\nGood luck.\n\nPlot summary[]\n\nThe Millennium Falcon, set on a course for Dweem, is diverted, thanks to the machinations of B-1D4. The Captain, Han Solo, is outraged and powers Wondeefor down, much to the angst of C-3PO and R2-D2. Meanwhile, on the Zaker Besar, Grand Moff 4-8C searches for the Falcon. Instead, his crew find the remains of the M'hendosat and a life pod carrying the former Captain, Kassihm.\n\nBurra Stone, Imperial interrogator, is abruptly awoken from his sleep on the Zaker Besar, and summoned into 4-8C's presence. Meanwhile, Kassihm's pod is captured by the Imperials. Stone interrogates Kassihm, and determines that Solo was headed for Dweem. Kassihm also convinces Stone and 4-8C that he is more valuable alive, and that he would be willing to join the hunt for the Corellian.\n\nOne of the Imperials, in an AT-ST, leads a team through the Dweem wilderness. Encountering an ancient auto cannon, the Imperials wonder whether there really is a Rebel base on the planet. Venturing into a cave, the Imperials are set upon by Dweemons, large spydr-like creatures. Though they fend off the monsters, they then encounter an avalanche. Venturing further into the cave, and encountering more Dweemons, the Imperial is forced to abandon the AT-ST, and traverse on foot. Eventually, the Imperial encounters an Iron Knight, but defeats it. Realizing that the base is in fact an ancient Republic installment, they begin to make their escape, but encounter more knights. The Knights provide riddles, but the Imperial solves them, and meets back up with the group.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]\n\nStar Wars Missions\n\nAssault on Yavin Four Escape from Thyferra Attack on Delrakkin Destroy the Liquidator The Hunt for Han Solo The Search for Grubba the Hutt Ithorian Invasion Togorian Trap Revolt of the Battle Droids Showdown in Mos Eisley Bounty Hunters vs. Battle Droids The Vactooine Disaster Prisoner of the Nikto Pirates The Monsters of Dweem Voyage to the Underworld Imperial Jailbreak Darth Vader's Return Rogue Squadron to the Rescue Bounty on Bonadan Total Destruction\n\n[edit]"
