By Henry McKeand The legacy of Sammo Hung’s work with Jackie Chan is so massive that it’s easy to forget what a diverse filmography he has. In a sense, there are many Sammos. You have … Continue reading →\n\nDirector: Wong Jing Cast: Eric Kot, Chingmy Yau, Ben Lam, Ng Man Tat, Diana Pang Dang, Shing Fui On, Ashton Chen, Bobby Yip, Nat Chan Pak Cheung, Hui Si Man, Pauline Yeung, Donnie Yen, Corey Yuen Kwai, Andy Cheng Kai-Chung Running Time: 96 min. By Paul Bramhall While the Hong Kong gambling movie has been around for several decades, chances are if you ask someone to name one of them, the default answer will be the 1989 classic God … Continue reading →\n\nDirector: Chow Cheung Co-director: Chen Wei-An Co-director: Mao Chiang-Pang Cast: Shing Fui-On, Dick Wei, Billy Chow Bei-Lei, Suen Tong, Chow Yuk-Ling, Yue Shut-Man, Lin Hsiao-Lu, Lam Chak-Ming, Hung Fung, Fu Kwai Running Time: 97 min. By Paul Bramhall During the 1990’s the Hong Kong Category III rating practically became its own genre. The equivalent of a US R-rated movie or an 18 certificate in the UK, while in the west such … Continue reading →\n\nDirector: Jeff Lau Producer: Wong Hoi Cast: Sandra Ng Kwan, Shing Fui On, Stephen Chow, Ann Bridgewater, Sunny Fang, Wu Fung, Jeff Lau, Lam Siu Lau, Joh Chung Sing, Eddie Ko Hung Running Time: 97 min. By Paul Bramhall The sheer volume of movies cranked out of Hong Kong in the 1980’s somewhat belies belief, and perhaps understandably, the on-the-fly nature of so many of them sometimes results in confusion. … Continue reading →\n\nDirector: Tony Liu Chun-ku Cast: Moon Lee, Gordon Liu, Lau Siu Kwan, Leung Kar Yan, Fujimi Nadeki, Kingdom Yuen King Tan, Shing Fui On, Ng Man Tat, Tony Liu Jun Guk, Mark Houghton Running Time: 91 min. By Paul Bramhall Like most fans of Hong Kong action, I have a soft spot for the Girls with Guns genre. Sure it was short lived (almost every entry that falls under the … Continue reading →\n\nDirector: Herman Yau Producer: Wong Jing Cast: Anthony Wong, Angel Wong, Vincent Wan, Mariane Chan, Lo Meng, Ng Sui Ting, Peter Ngor Chi Kwan, Shing Fui On, Cindy Yip, Chang Yin, Tsang Yin Running Time: 97 min. By Martin Sandison After the success of the sadistic and powerful Bunman: The Untold Story, the director and star team of Herman Yau and Anthony Wong set about making another classic slice of … Continue reading →\n\nDirector: Herman Yau Cast: Anthony Wong, Danny Lee, Emily Kwan, Lau Siu-Ming, Shing Fui-On, Parkman Wong Pak-Man, Yee Ka-Fat, Lam King-Kong, Julie Lee, Leung Hung-Wah Running Time: 96 min. By Martin Sandison One of the most notorious Category 3 Hong Kong films ever made, Bunman (what a title!) features everything that makes extreme HK cinema so unique: brutality, seriously dark comedy and insane energy that spills off the screen. Only … Continue reading →\n\nDirector: Ring Lam Writer: Nam Yin Cast: Chow Yun Fat, Tony Leung Ka Fai, Roy Cheung Yiu Yeung, William Ho Ka Kui, Victor Hon Kwan, Tommy Wong Kwong Leung, Frankie Ng Chi Hun Running Time: 98 min. By Numksull Lots of directors out there could learn a valuable lesson from Ringo Lam. No artsy-fartsy cinematic snobbery to be found in his films, for better or for worse. He and screenwriter … Continue reading →\n\nDirector: John Woo Co-director: Ng Ma Cast: David Chiang, Danny Lee, Chen Kuan Tai, Stephen Chow, Lo Lieh, Cally Kwong, Wu Ma, Shing Fui On, Zhao Lei, Tien Niu, Alan Chan, Fung Hak On, Philip Ko Fei Running Time: 97 min. By Numskull This is the John Woo “gun fu” movie that nobody has seen. It’s listed on the filmographies, but nothing much is ever said about it. It simply gets nestled … Continue reading →\n\nDirector: Lau Kar Leung Cast: Chow Yun Fat, Conan Lee, Nina Li Chi, Shirley Ng, Norman Chu, Gordon Liu, David Chiang, Philip Ko Fei, James Wong, Wayne Archer, Lau Kar Wing, Shing Fui On, Lydia Shum, Ti Lung, Wilson Tong, Wu Shih, Bill Lui Tak-Wai Running Time: 89 min.
