        "text": "Hong Kong comedian and actress (1945–2008)\n\nLydia Shum Din-ha or Lydia Tin Ha Sum (Chinese: 沈殿霞; 21 July 1945 – 19 February 2008) was a Hong Kong-Canadian comedian, MC, actress and singer. Known for her portly figure, signature dark-rimmed glasses and bouffant hairstyle, she was affectionately known to peers and fans as Fei-fei (Chinese: 肥肥, lit. \"Fat Fat\" or \"Fatty\") or Fei Jie (Chinese: 肥姐 lit. \"Fat Sister\").\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nShum was born on 21 July 1945 in Baoshan, Shanghai to Shum Yin Gee (Chinese: 沈賢祺; 1913–1978, with his ancestral home in Shanpei, Ningbo) and Shum Yao Tam Suh (Chinese: 沈邱淡素; 1913–2008).[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nShum entered the Hong Kong entertainment industry at the age of 13 in 1958. She made her film debut in 1960, joining Shaw Brothers as an actress at the age of 15. Shum debuted in When the Peach Blossoms Bloom, a 1960 Mandarin comedy directed by Griffin Yueh Feng.[3] She took some time to adjust to Hong Kong as she found the local Cantonese cuisine very different from that of her native Shanghai.[citation needed]\n\nTVB\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile she worked at Shaw Brothers, her popularity grew and she became one of the first stakeholders in the up-and-coming television broadcast station TVB. In 1967, Shum's stardom took off with the popular variety show Enjoy Yourself Tonight. She first sang in the Cantopop group, the Four Golden Flowers. Later, she played a Shanghai woman in the 1970s. She also sang as the partner of Roman Tam from 1971 to 1973.[citation needed]\n\nBy August 1972, she was sufficiently well regarded to be invited to ceremonially ride through the Cross-Harbour Tunnel on its opening day. TVB General Manager Stephen Chan has said that there was no substitute for Lydia Shum, and that every person who worked with her professionally eventually became well known in Hong Kong. Her openness to appearing in sport bikinis and ballet costumes despite her size earned her respect in image-conscious Hong Kong.[citation needed]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nShum has been established mainly as a comic and dramatic actress but is not limited to films in those genres. Kung fu fans will recognize her from her role as Yuen Cheung-Yan's dominating wife in the film Drunken Tai Chi. She also appeared as Richard Ng's wife in the all-star comedy Millionaire's Express, as well as a major role in the successful four movie series It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World.[1] Her 1997 film Fitness Tour utilised her weight for its plot.\n\nShe took a leave from her movie career that same year, and hosted a talk show on Hong Kong, along with numerous telethons and variety shows on TVB.\n\nIn 1976, Shum co-directed You Are Wonderful. Shum's last film was In-Laws Outlaws, a 2004 Cantonese comedy film directed by Clifton Ko Chi-Sum. Shum is credited with over 175 films.[3]\n\nAsia region\n\n[edit]\n\nShum starred in Singapore's Channel 5 sitcom Living with Lydia (while credited as Lydia Sum) and Cantonese series like Slim Chances (我要Fit一Fit). Her performance in Living with Lydia won her the \"Best Comedy Performance by an Actress\" award at the 2003 Asian Television Awards.[1] It was also the first time she had acted in an English sitcom with a multi-camera format, though a laugh track was used.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLydia Shum was the sister of fashion designer Alfred Sung. Shum married actor and singer Adam Cheng Siu-chow in January 1985 after 11 years of cohabitation. Prior to the marriage, in December 1984 Shum was asked by her good friend Lee Heung Kam to fly to San Francisco for the opening ceremony of Lee's shop. [citation needed] Shum, who was in Taiwan with Cheng at the time, was reluctant to do so initially, but three days later, Shum left for San Francisco. When she returned to Taiwan, she heard rumors that Cheng was having an affair. Upon being asked about this, Cheng denied having a relationship with another woman and suggested marriage. Shum believed that a marriage would deter any woman from becoming close to Cheng. On 5 January 1985, Cheng and Shum flew to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to get married.\n\nDue to the hurried circumstances of their marriage and Shum's proportions being outside standard clothing sizes, there was insufficient time to prepare a wedding gown. Shum wore a Chinese cheongsam instead, and later said in a 2006 interview in Hong Kong that one of her greatest regrets was not wearing a wedding gown for her wedding. [citation needed]\n\nOn 30 May 1987, Joyce Cheng Yan-Yee was born to Shum and Adam Cheng. Eight months after their daughter was born, Cheng and Shum divorced.[4]\n\nHealth problems and subsequent death\n\n[edit]\n\nShum had several serious chronic ailments: cholangitis, diabetes, and hypertension. In 2002, she was admitted to the Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) in Hong Kong and had 36 gallstones extracted. In September 2006, Shum was diagnosed with a liver tumor and cancer around the gallbladder. Doctors immediately removed one third of her liver.[5]\n\nPrior to a cholecystectomy done in 2002, she had bile duct inflammation in 1978 and again in 1989. On 22 September 2006, the inflammation recurred. Four days later, it had complicated her liver and she went into a coma until 1 October. Once again, on 29 January 2007, she entered the operating room to remove a liver tumor which weighed 2.7 kg. On 8 March 2007, the tumor was found to be growing so she had another surgery. [citation needed]\n\nOn 1 November 2006, a 24-year-old Indonesian domestic helper, Triyuliarti Yuyun, was convicted of violating the Hospital Authority Ordinance and sentenced to four weeks in jail.\n\nYuyun entered a ward at the Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) on 1 October 2006 where Shum had been receiving treatment, and attempted to take photographs of Shum.[6] Later, it was confirmed that Yuyun was working for an employee of the local magazine East Week, but she had not been authorised to take photographs of Shum. Senior management of East Week did not approve of the action and offered an apology to Shum. Magistrate Colin Mackintosh determined that Yuyun's actions were premeditated and done for financial gain, and that the serious infringement of the patient's privacy warranted a custodial sentence. On that occasion, Shum was discharged from the hospital in July 2007.\n\nOn 11 October 2007, Shum collapsed at home with pleural effusion, and was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QE) for emergency treatment. Later that day, Shum was transferred to QMH.[5] She was discharged from that hospital on 16 October 2007.\n\nShum was admitted to the intensive care ward of QMH on 22 January 2008 and checked out four days later. Shum's mother died in Canada while Shum was in hospital. She was once again admitted to the intensive care ward of QMH on 2 February 2008, where her condition worsened. On 19 February, at 3 am, her family decided that Shum's life support should be withdrawn. It was decided that her breathing apparatus would be removed and that her family spend time with her by her bedside. Shum died at 8:38 a.m. local time that day. Prior to her death, she had liver cancer for two years. As part of the treatment for her illness, she underwent chemotherapy and several rounds of kidney dialysis treatment. On 24 February 2008, escorted by her daughter Joyce, Shum's body was flown on a Cathay Pacific passenger flight from Hong Kong to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. On 27 February, Shum was buried at Burnaby's Forest Lawn Memorial Park in a private ceremony.[7] Video footage of the funeral was played at a memorial event at the Hong Kong Coliseum on 2 March.[8]\n\nFei-fei Day\n\n[edit]\n\nFei-fei Day was proclaimed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for 1 June 2008 (Shum's Chinese lunar calendar birthday). Mayor Sam Sullivan proclaimed this memorial day in Vancouver on 26 February 2008, a week after Shum's death.[9] On 21 July 2022 she is featured as a Google Doodle.[1]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is a partial list of films.[3]\n\n1965 The Lotus Lamp\n\n1967 A Girl's Secret[10][11]\n\n1967 Broadcast Queen[12][13]\n\n1967 Every Girl a Romantic Dreamer – Sai.[14]\n\n1967 Finding a Wife in a Blind Way[15]\n\n1967 The Flying Killer (aka Chivalrous Girl in the Air) – Chow Mei-Ha.[16]\n\n1967 Happy Years – Cheung Lan.[17]\n\n1967 The Iron Lady Against the One-eyed Dragon\n\n1967 Three Women in a Factory – Chow Siu-Yuk.[18]\n\n1967 Waste Not Our Youth – Fei Fei.[19][20]\n\n1967 Unforgettable First Love[21]\n\n1968 Lady Songbird\n\n1968 Happy Years\n\n1968 Four Gentlemanly Flowers\n\n1968 A Blundering Detective and a Foolish Thief\n\n1968 Won't You Give Me a Kiss?\n\n1968 Teenage Love\n\n1968 Wonderful Youth\n\n1968 We All Enjoy Ourselves Tonight\n\n1969 Moments of Glorious Beauty\n\n1969 The Little Warrior\n\n1969 Teddy Girls – Yeung Siu-Kiu.[22]\n\n1969 To Catch a Cat\n\n1969 A Big Mess\n\n1969 One Day at a Time\n\n1970 Secret Agent No. 1[23][24]\n\n1970 Happy Times\n\n1970 The Mad Bar\n\n1971 The Invincible Eight\n\n1972 Songs and Romance Forever\n\n1973 The Private Eye\n\n1973 Love Is a Four Letter Word\n\n1973 If Tomorrow Comes\n\n1973 The House of 72 Tenants – Shanghai Po.[25]\n\n1974 The Country Bumpkin\n\n1974 Tenants of Talkative Street\n\n1974 Lovable Mr. Able\n\n1974 The Crazy Instructor\n\n1974 The Country Bumpkin in Style\n\n1974 Kissed by the Wolves[26][27]\n\n1975 Pretty Swindler\n\n1975 Don't Call Me Uncle\n\n1975 Sup Sap Bup Dup\n\n1976 You are Wonderful – also director\n\n1976 Love in Hawaii\n\n1977 The Great Man\n\n1982 Cat vs Rat\n\n1984 Drunken Tai Chi\n\n1986 The Millionaire's Express\n\n1987 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World\n\n1987 Mr. Handsome (1987)\n\n1988 Tiger on the Beat [cameo]\n\n1988 Double Fattiness\n\n1988 Mother vs. Mother\n\n1988 King of Stanley Market\n\n1988 Faithfully Yours\n\n1988 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World II\n\n1989 The Bachelor's Swan-Song\n\n1989 City Squeeze\n\n1989 Eat a Bowl of Tea\n\n1989 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World III\n\n1989 Lost Souls\n\n1991 The Banquet\n\n1991 The Perfect Match\n\n1992 It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World Too\n\n1993 The Laughter of Water Margins\n\n1993 Perfect Couples\n\n1993 He Ain't Heavy, He's My Father\n\n1995 Just Married\n\n1997 Fitness Tour\n\n1997 Happy Together [2]\n\n2001 The Stamp of Love\n\n2001–2005 Living with Lydia\n\n2003 Miss Du Shi Niang\n\n2004 In-Laws, Out-Laws\n\n2006 Where Are They Now?\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
