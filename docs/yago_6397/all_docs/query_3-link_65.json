Cheng played Ting Hai in the series, who made an immense fortune by short selling derivatives and stocks during a bear market. Many people went bankrupt while Ting Hai's family became richer until they were defeated by their nemesis. Cheng became popularly associated with the Ting Hai effect, named after his character in the series. The effect involves a peculiar and unexplained phenomenon, in which global stock markets will fall whenever a new Hong Kong TV drama series, starring Cheng, is aired.\n\nkenntona\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#2\n\nRe: HK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\nSelf fulfilling prophesy lah..... take a good look at the daily and weekly charts of HSI - was set up for a sell-down since January.\n\nBut news coverage picked this up all over....Hong Kong Stock Market 'Ting-Hai' Effect - Business Insider\n\n\"The Greed Of Man,\" 1992: The Hang Seng fell 13 percent while the show was on.\n\n\"Legend of Yung Ching,\" 1997: The Hang Seng sunk below the below 10,000 while the series was running.\n\nCheng had shows airing during the Asian financial crisis of 1998 and the tech bubble burst of 2000.\n\nThe market fell during 11 of 17 of his television shows since 1992.\n\nCLSA analysts say the markets do worse when the series are more tragic.\n\nâ€‹\n\nsszone\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#3\n\nRe: HK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\ni think adam cheng will dulan one day and take chopper chop ppl for blaming him every time when shit happens....lol\n\nhoks\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#4\n\nRe: HK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\nActually I read some HK forum that complied data of him appearing on tv vs stock market crashes...only 50% zun leh.\n\nwobbles\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#5\n\nRe: HK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\nIs he the guy who married the late Fei Fei?\n\nJason8822\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#6\n\nRe: HK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\nView attachment 49159\n\nCorrect.\n\nDun ask me who is the person standing at the centre\n\nMeek\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#7\n\nHK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\nJason8822;976002 said:\n\nView attachment 49159\n\nCorrect.\n\nDun ask me who is the person standing at the centre\n\ndats joyce cheng, lydia (fei fei's) and adam's daughter.\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Apr 5, 2013\n\ngolilok\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#8\n\nRe: HK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\nMeek;976014 said:\n\ndats joyce cheng, lydia (fei fei's) and adam's daughter.\n\nSame colour dye, not confusing one\n\nMeek\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#9\n\nHK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\ngolilok;976020 said:\n\nSame colour dye, not confusing one\n\nastute observations. you are a sheer genius.\n\nhey, does dat mean you are not confused anymore?\n\ngolilok\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#10\n\nRe: HK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\nMeek;976023 said:\n\nastute observations. you are a sheer genius.\n\nhey, does dat mean you are not confused anymore?\n\nare u? your astute compliments give me sheer pleasure thank u meek mm.\n\nMeek\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#11\n\nHK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\ngolilok;976029 said:\n\nare u? your astute compliments give me sheer pleasure thank u meek mm.\n\nme is glad you are suitably unconfused now and then... i can rely on you when i do get confused.\n\nJason8822\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nApr 5, 2013\n\n#12\n\nRe: HK stock market reaction - Ting Hai effect - Adam Cheng Siu-chow\n\nHmmm...
