        "text": "Hong Kong singer and actor Adam Cheng will perform his ‘Adam Cheng World Tour In Macau’ at The Venetian Macao’s Cotai Arena on September 30, 2017.\n\nMarking his 50th anniversary in the industry, Cheng embarked on his world tour earlier this year in Hong Kong. Cheng has been a household name for over half a century, and has appeared in leading roles in numerous television productions since the 1970s, including “The Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre”, “The Greed of Man”, and “Cold Blood Warm Heart”. He has also appeared in around 40 movies.\n\nAccording to a press release issued by Sands China, Cheng’s first album “Lover Got Married” was widely acclaimed, after which he went on to record over 40 albums.\n\nFoundation sponsors 86 students for educational visits\n\nEighty-six students from secondary schools in Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore were sponsored by the Stanley Ho Astronautics Training Foundation to participate in the 24th Annual Aerospace Summer Camp, held in Beijing between July 16 and 22.\n\nThe students attended seminars and visited aerospace-related museums and organizations. These included the China Aerospace Museum, the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application.\n\nThe group also visited China Academy of Space Technology, Centre for Space Breeding, China Science and Technology Museum, and the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nAmbrose So, Secretary-General of the Foundation, remarked, “The Summer Camp offers a series of interactive activities aiming to broaden students’ knowledge of aerospace science and to enhance their understanding of China’s aerospace development and appreciation of Chinese culture.”\n\nMercedes Benz announces new S-class vehicle\n\nMercedes-Benz Hong Kong has released a new S-Class vehicle offering 64 colors in an extended range of ambient lighting along with an array of customizable settings.\n\nThe feature adds lighting highlights on the trim elements, the central display, the storage facility and the front of the center console.\n\nThe extended ambient lighting creates interior lighting moods by creating composite colors from the 64-color range.\n\nThe ‘energizing’ comfort control in the S-Class links various systems in the vehicle together for comfort. These include the climate control system, which includes fragrance options, and seats which allow passengers to control heating, ventilation, and massage.\n\nFor the first time, the ‘linguatronic’ voice control of the new S-Class can receive Cantonese voice commands. The voice commands can be used to control the air conditioning, seat heating and ventilation, and interior lighting, among others. Also new to the ‘linguatronic 2.0’ is a feature that enables drivers to request information such as the next service date, the current speed limit, and the remaining range or the date."
