        "text": "She was affectionately known by her nickname Fei Fei (“fat fat” in Cantonese) – the actress regularly poked fun at her own physique – and today she is regarded as Hong Kong’s queen of comedy and is remembered for bringing joy and positivity to her audiences.\n\nAs she appeared in more films Sum slowly began gaining recognition, but it was only in 1967, after joining the broadcaster TVB and appearing on its variety show Enjoy Yourself Tonight as a co-host, that she shot to stardom.\n\nAt the time, television producer Robert Chua Wah-peng invited Sum to be part of the show because he was looking for someone who “appeared like anyone’s family”, he told the Post in 2008.\n\n“Lydia was very fresh, genuine and she could bring a smile to your face. Everything came from the heart,” he added.\n\nIt was during her time on the show that Sum became beloved among fans for her jovial demeanour and distinctive cackle, both of which were also seen in the films she appeared in.\n\nWhile Sum did not always play leading characters – she was sometimes typecast as the dependable good friend – the actress remained ever likeable and a constant in the entertainment industry, a rare feat for someone who did not fit the mould of a typical movie star.\n\n“I stand out because I am special, because I am fat,” she once said. “Am I not beautiful? I think I am. I have a lot of confidence in myself. I may be fat, but I look good too. As long as the audience accepts me, that’s enough.”\n\nSum appeared in over 100 films and hosted more than 5,000 variety shows, but she did not limit herself to just those two forms of entertainment. In the 1970s, Sum ventured into music.\n\nShe became a member of the Cantopop group Four Golden Flowers along with Liza Wang Ming-chun, Teresa Cheung Tak-lan and Wong Oi-ming; and she also sang alongside Roman Tam Pak-sin.\n\nIn 1991, she shot a 60-episode drama series called Auntie Lydia and Uncle Bill for the television network ATV, which featured Sum as an advertising manager who moves to Canada.\n\nThere, her character reconnects with an old classmate – played by frequent co-star Bill Tung Biu – and they end up in a romantic relationship back in Hong Kong. It was the first time Sum had starred in a long-running television drama series.\n\nWhile the actress had a wildly successful career, her personal life was filled with ups and downs. After marrying Hong Kong actor and singer Adam Cheng Siu-chau in 1985, the couple got a divorce in 1988, eight months after Sum gave birth to their daughter, the Cantopop singer Joyce Cheng Yan-yee.\n\nAt the time she was completely heartbroken, according to a Post article from 1990. “I thought of ending my life and retiring permanently from the world of show business,” Sum said. But two things kept her going: her daughter and elderly mother.\n\nThe actress became a single parent; in the 1990s, Sum emigrated to Vancouver, Canada with her daughter and raised her there. Despite having left Hong Kong, she returned often for work.\n\nSum eventually made her way back to Asia a few years later, and starred in a Singaporean television sitcom, Living with Lydia, from 2001 to 2005 – her first English-speaking role.\n\nWhile Sum dealt with several health issues over the years – diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure – her health took a turn for the worse in the 2000s. In 2002, she had 32 gallstones removed, and in 2006 she was diagnosed with cancer of the liver and gallbladder.\n\nA year later, in October 2007, Sum collapsed at home and was admitted to hospital. She was visited by her daughter and her ex-husband, who told the Post he had not seen Sum for a long time and learned about her condition through the media and friends.\n\n“She winked at me to let me know that she knew I came to see her,” Adam Cheng said at the time. “Doctors say her condition has stabilised and is now under control. But it is not known why she suddenly fell ill. Tubes have been attached to her to help her breathe.”\n\nA month later, in November 2007, Sum was once again taken to hospital after attending a friend’s birthday party in Macau. It was at this time that the actress made her final television appearance, during which she received a lifetime achievement award from TVB.\n\nIn February 2008, at the age of 62, Sum died at Queen Mary Hospital. Her death brought condolences from well-wishers in Hong Kong and worldwide, with many of Sum’s peers, colleagues and fans noting her impact and legacy.\n\n“Fei Fei cheered up Hong Kong people, who grew up with her laughter,” Stephen Chan Chi-wan, then the general manager for broadcasting at TVB, said, describing Sum as a Hong Kong icon who represented the Hong Kong spirit.\n\nIn Canada, a few days after Sum’s death, Vancouver’s then-mayor, Sam Sullivan, declared June 1 “Fei Fei Day” to honour Sum’s birthday.\n\n“I would like to acknowledge her legacy as a great artist and as a great supporter of many community services in Vancouver,” he said at a city council meeting that was attended by Sum’s daughter, Joyce Cheng.\n\n“I know right now my mother must be laughing out loud – her signature laugh, loud and proud – knowing that her birthday this year will be Ms Fei Fei Day in the city of Vancouver,” Cheng said at the time."
