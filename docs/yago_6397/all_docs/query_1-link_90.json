She began her career from an adolescent age through Shaw Brothers Studio, which was the biggest production house in Hong Kong at that time.\n\nShe had her breakthrough in 1967 as the host of a well-known variety show “Enjoy Yourself Tonight”. Later, she played a prominent role in a well-known Cantonese movie ‘The House of 72 Tenants’.\n\nThe movie was based on the daily lives of people who dwell in a dilapidated flat. The movie outperformed blockbuster movies and won the 1973 box office championship in Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, Shum appeared in a four-part hit comedy called “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad World”. It was about a poor family who tried to seek financial success. This movie still sparks debate in the media as it offers a potent critique of societal inequity.\n\nAside from working in Hong Kong, Shum also appeared in few English-language movies such as “Living with Lydia” for which she won the 2003 Asian Television Award for Best Comedy Performance.\n\nShe was also known by nick-name such as, “Happy Fruit” and “Fei Fei” (which is Cantonese word for “Fat Fat”). Fei Fei is a well-known word in Chinese communities, which means spreading joy and laughter.\n\nLydia Shun’s Husband?\n\nAfter being together for almost 11 years, Shum finally tied the knot in January 1985 with actor and singer Adam Cheng Siu-Chow. Shum and Adam had a daughter named Joyce Cheng.\n\nAfter 8 months of their daughter’s birth, the couple got divorced in 1988.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoyce, Shun’s daughter, is a Canadian singer, writer, and actor. She is best known for her role of Snow White at Hong Kong Disneyland. Joyce also participated in several charitable events after her mother’s death in 2008.\n\nDeath\n\nShum was afflicted with several diseases such as, cholangitis, diabetes, and hypertension, among other severe chronic diseases. In the year 2002, she had a surgery to remove 36 gallstones.\n\nLater, in September, 2006, it was discovered that she had a liver tumor and cancer near her gallbladder due to which Shum underwent several chemotherapy and rounds of kidney dialysis treatment.\n\nFinally, on February 19th, 2008, at the age of 62, Shum passed away after her family decided to withdraw her life support following a pleural effusion. Veteran comedienne Lydia Shum Tin-ha was laid in peace at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Vancouver, Canada after her funeral. Her net worth stood at $2 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO READ: Explained What Is The Pulling Man Game On TikTok, Scream, Link, Meaning And How To Play The New Viral Trend"
