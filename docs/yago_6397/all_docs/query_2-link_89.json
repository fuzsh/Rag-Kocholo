        "text": "Yesterday around 2pm, there was a live telecast of late Lydia Shum aka Fei Jie’s memorial service from the Hong Kong Coliseum where thousands of people attended including celebrities who have retreated from the entertainment industry such as Gallen Lo, Esther Kwan and husband, Cheung Ka Fai, Lo Ka Ying and more many veterans.\n\nIt was telecasted live by many TV stations in different countries and is considered the biggest coverage ever for a celebrity’s death after Princess Diana. Young artists such as Ron Ng, Raymond Lam, Kevin Cheng, Patrick Tang, Shirley Yeung, Kenix Kwok, Frankie Lam, Hung Tin Ming, Wong Hei, Linda Chung and many more.\n\nThe ceremony started with clips and videos of Lydia’s funeral in Canada followed by a silent tribute led by Eric Tsang Chi Wai, Lydia’s long-time on screen partner. Tsang was hanging by tread controlling his emotions. The stage was decorated with a golden curtain, hearts composed of 10,000 champagne roses (Lydia’s favourite flower) and white orchids, and four pictures of Shum.\n\nLydia’s old friends went on stage to express their feelings and gratitude towards Fei Jie. Friends including actress Connie Chan Po-chu and singer Liu Jia-chang, actor Wu Fung who said, “I say this to you Ah Fei with an aching heart- good-bye forever. I say this wholeheartedly – you’ll be in my heart. Rest in peace.”\n\nLydia’s godson, Heavenly King Jacky Cheung Hok Yau lost control of his emotions as he couldn’t find the words to express Lydia’s death in a pre-recorded tape.\n\nLydia’s long-time friend aka 5th god-big brother, Alan Tang Kong Wing express his dissatisfactory towards father of Lydia’s daughter, actor Adam Cheng Siu Chau aka Chau kun when he went on stage for final tribute. He exclaimed, “Why is all the aunties and uncles saying they will take good care of Joyce (Lydia’s daughter)? Where is the father? Why is he appearing only now? Come here and explain yourself!”\n\nAccompanied by daughter, Joyce Cheng Yan Yee, Adam who was half bold took of his cap when he went on stage to clarify himself but was interupted by the audiences who were shouting, “Its a lie!!”, giving Adam a hard time to explain.\n\nDue to that, Joyce had to take over the mic from her father and handled the situation maturely by saying that it was all a misunderstanding. The ceremony was a tribute to her mother and she hope that there will not be gossips or any bad intentions to disrupt the way people remember Lydia.\n\nThis incident has shown that Joyce has matured, capable of taking care of herself and makes Eric as an uncle feels relieve mentioned Eric Tsang later on in his speech before passing on the microphone to Joyce.\n\nLast speech given my Joyce, she said, “Even if Mommy is playing mahjong high above, she will stop and listen to our blessings and thank us. I hope after this memorial ceremony everyone will forever hold Mommy’s happiness and her positive [nature] close to their hearts so she could live on forever in our hearts.”"
