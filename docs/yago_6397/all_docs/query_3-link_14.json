        "text": "Hong Kong singer-actor Adam Cheng’s eldest daughter, Angelina Cheng On Yee, was recently found dead at her home in South California, United States. She was 55.\n\nAccording to a HK01 report, Angelina’s death was discovered after her friends alerted the police as they could not get in touch with her. She was believed to have taken her own life.\n\nA church in the US held a funeral for Angelina on the morning of Sept 30. Its members urged Cheng, 76, to reach out to them as soon as possible in order to make arrangements for his daughter’s final rites.\n\nIt's reported that the church initially tried to contact Cheng’s ex-girlfriend, and Angelina’s biological mother, Lo Wai Yu but failed.\n\nIn a brief statement to Hong Kong media on Monday (Oct 2), Cheng's current wife Koon Jing Wah said that she and her husband are \"handling the matter\".\n\nShe added that Cheng is emotionally affected by the news and that they are both working to contact Lo who is living in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nAccording to Koon, she and her husband hoped Lo would come forward to handle the funeral due to legal issues concerning Angelina's estate.\n\n“Relatives and friends have tried contacting her by phone. Her number has also been passed to the church,” she said.\n\nAngelina was raised by Lo and had no contact with Cheng until a few years ago when the Cantopop star arrived in Las Vegas for a performance.\n\nCheng once mentioned in an interview that he had paid for Angelina’s tertiary education but lost contact with her after that.\n\n“I don’t know if I’d be able to recognise her if we meet on the streets,” he said, as quoted by China Press.\n\nCheng and Lo dated for three years before going their separate ways. The pair had Angelina in 1968.\n\nCheng has a daughter, singer Joyce Cheng, with late comedian Lydia Sum and two daughters with Koon."
