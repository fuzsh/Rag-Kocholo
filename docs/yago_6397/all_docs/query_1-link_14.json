A few hundred family and friends gathered at Forest Lawn cemetery for Shum's funeral service and burial. One uninvited phototgrapher was arrested and carried off by police during the service.\n\nShum, possibly Hong Kong's equivalent of U.S. comedienne Roseanne Barr, was one of Hong Kong's best-known entertainers and fondly called \"Fei Fei\" or \"Fatty Shum\" for her corpulent physique and exuberant personality.\n\nHer influence extended to greater China and Chinese communities the world over.\n\nLeading lights in Hong Kong's entertainment and political circles paid tribute to Shum's life and career, intertwined with the collective memories of many Hong Kong families.\n\nThe entertainer, known for her high-pitched voice and laughter, initially built her career in Hong Kong, although her popularity later spread to Singapore, where she anchored the sitcom \"Living with Lydia\", speaking in accented but fluent English.\n\nBorn in Shanghai in 1947, Shum's multi-faceted 40-year showbiz career began as a child actress with the Shaw Brothers Studio. She later became a legendary compere for the TVB variety show, \"Enjoy Yourself Tonight\", which turned her into a household name.\n\nFormerly married to actor Adam Cheng, Shum is survived by her daughter Joyce, who also has show business ambitions.\n\nCopyright Holder: REUTERS\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2011.
