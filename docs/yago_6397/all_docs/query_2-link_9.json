In a old clip where Joyce sang with her mother, Joyce looks very fat; a carbon copy of her mother. Now she seems like a different person.\n\nI believe Joyce grew up in Vancouver, where Lydia maintained a house.\n\nDoes anyone know where Joyce went to school in Vancouver? Thats probably how she got her Caucasian boyfriend.\n\nCh28 wrote: ↑Crofton Manor\n\nI heard she grew up in Vancouver, but she went to Queen's University. She's only 20 years old now since I'm guessing she's in her second year or so right now. But looks like she will probably put her school on hold and join the singing industry. Her voice is not bad and she has really slimmed down but everyone will always see her as Fei Fei's daughter.\n\nHeatware: spike-spiegel @ Heatware\n\nst7860\n\nBanned\n\n10708 posts\n\n152 upvotes\n\nAir Canada Aeroplan Super Elite Reservations: 1-800-401-7201 or 514-369-7598\n\nget unlimited calls or other discounts by calling directly to:\n\nFido Retentions: call 611 then push 7, then push 3 - or Rogers Retentions 1-514-734-7873 or 1-866-228-7109\n\nTelus Mobility: 1-877-279-3100 or 416-279-3100 or 1 416 296 7669 client.loyalty@telus.com\n\nBell Mobility: 1-866-313-1086\n\nnice chairs http://www.eternitymodern.ca\n\ngreat value - lol http://www.walmart.ca\n\ntinlunlau\n\nDeal Addict\n\n3976 posts\n\n20 upvotes\n\nAs much as the dude has a point, it was pretty unnecessary to ruin the mood in the nature of this specific event.

Joyce handled it pretty well and Adam Cheng did his best to try to say something to cool the fire. Considering the situation with Adam has always been a bit dicey, it was the elephant in the room.\n\nAfter the service ended, Adam was being interviewed by some media. After he was interviewed, he turned around and Alan walked out and they momentarily met each other. I think Adam tried to greet Alan but Alan brushed him off again.\n\nHeatware: spike-spiegel @ Heatware\n\nteknoluv\n\nDeal Fanatic\n\n6044 posts\n\n23 upvotes\n\nToronto\n\ntinlunlau wrote: ↑But Alan was very good friends with Lydia.

But then WHY did Cheung have to even care about Shum AFTER they had divorced?? Moreover, Shum never wanted Cheung to play a good part in her daughter's life until more recent years.\n\ntinlunlau\n\nDeal Addict\n\n3976 posts\n\n20 upvotes\n\nteknoluv wrote: ↑Yes, it's understandable since Tang and Shum are like brother and sister FOR SO MANY YEARS.

Moreover, Shum never wanted Cheung to play a good part in her daughter's life until more recent years.\n\nI even heard Adam's current wife is pretty tempermental too.\n\nI've actually met and got close to Adam Cheng in Toronto back in November 1988. Back then, my dad was helping the folks at Profekta (TVB's exclusive distributor in Toronto at the time) and his restaurant sponsored an anniversary show for them while TVB sends some of their actors to do a show at Seneca College Auditorium. I was only 7 years old at the time but even then, I did not have a good impression of him. I keep getting bad vibes from him. Dude gave me the cuteye after I walked off and asked a waitress for her number. All the other TVB actors and executives chuckled at me and thought it was cute. Only Adam was giving me this angry stare. I was just like any other typical CBC so I couldn't care less what Adam was thinking at the time.\n\nI've even heard that Adam Cheng kept bugging my dad about giving him a 5 star hotel which my dad refused cuz it'd be unfair for the other actors. Thought it was pretty annoying to hear he'd make that kinda request. Considering the fact that my grandfather was one of the first people who produced his albums in Adam's early years, I don't think Adam has the right to even make that request. My impression of him just gone down the drain when I found out about it. And to think I used to idolize him in my toddler years.\n\n(On an added note, Bennett Pang Kin-San was a pretty cool guy. I remember laughing and singing along to his \"strip off your clothes and shoes\" song. And he doodled a picture of himself. I'm sure Bennett Pang is great with kids. He handled me pretty well.)\n\nmanixc\n\nDeal Fanatic\n\n7654 posts\n\n455 upvotes\n\nBC\n\ntinlunlau wrote: ↑As much as the dude has a point, it was pretty unnecessary to ruin the mood in the nature of this specific event.
