        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis revisionist account of the production history of How Green Was My Valley (1941) challenges the standard account that John Ford shot the film as written by screenwriter Philip Dunne. A close examination of the complete run of script variants, as well as memos in the Twentieth Century-Fox collection at the University of Southern California, the Wyler papers at the Margaret Herrick Library at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the Ford papers at the Lilly Library at Indiana University, provides a comprehensive account of the process of script development and details Ford’s contributions to the narrative structure of the completed film."
