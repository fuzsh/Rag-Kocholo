        "text": "Terms of Sale:\n\nPayment with order. We accept Paypal, major credit cards via abebooks check-out system, or money orders.\n\nItems are guaranteed to be as described with regard to condition, edition, and authenticity or provenance. No other warranty is expressed or implied.\n\nOwner Name: John T. Cannon dba Aladdin Books\n\nAddress: P.O. Box 152, Fullerton, CA 92836\n\nPhone: 714: 738-6115\n\ne-mail: aladdinbooks@earthlink.net\n\nShipping Terms:\n\nSHIPPING CHARGES: Please note that about 13.5% of the shipping and handling charge is retained by AbeBooks as a fee levied against the bookseller and not passed along for purchasing postage and packaging supplies. That is much of the reason why the shipping charge is significantly higher than actual postage costs. This is especially true for international shipping where international postal costs are high to begin with. Occasionally (such as when ordering a set of books) it will be necessary for us to ask domestic buyers for some additional shipping funds. In this case, after confirming your book(s) is available, we will ask AbeBooks to request appropriate additional shipping charges. In practice, this is a rare occurrence on domestic orders. See below for international shipping. PACKING: All books will be carefully packed to insure safe arrival. We use either quality shipping boxes or other shipping containers augmented by bubble, paper cushioning, or cardboard chipboard to insure safe delivery in the same condition as book was sent. INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Our default shipping cost is for shipping in a flat rate global priority envelope, small box, or flat rate bag. If your book is too large or too expensive to ship in these containers we will be asking AbeBooks to request adequate additional funds so we can ship your book safely and securely. All international shipments will be listed as books-merchandise on customs forms with value as actual invoice cost. No exceptions. If you have any concerns, please contact us via e mail prior to placing an order for an accurate shipping quotation."
