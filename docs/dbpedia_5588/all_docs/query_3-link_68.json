And it happens to neither be a Western nor a Hitchock thriller? But a late 1950s teen drama?\n\nWhich is to say that none of those above things even factored into why I watched this film in the first place.\n\nNo, it was Marsha Hunt actually who was my gateway. For reference, she plays the mother of Brandon De Wilde (aka the kid from Shane).\n\nWho is Marsha Hunt and why is she important to me? Hunt is somewhat forgotten these days. Woefully so.

He wrote the novel that became MIDNIGHT COWBOY, and that film pulled no punches. So, I gave BLUE DENIM a try and found that it was quite good.\n\nReleased in 1959, the film is…"
