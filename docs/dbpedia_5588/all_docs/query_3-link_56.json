Together with her daughter Anna and housekeeper, Martha Huggins, Lucy departs for Whitecliff-by-the-Sea. There Lucy calls on Coombe, an estate agent, who reluctantly shows her Gull Cottage, a striking house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Lucy insists on renting Gull Cottage, and during her first night in the house, as a fierce storm rages, she speaks to the ghost in the darkness. When it gruffly replies, Lucy lights a candle and gazes in amazement at the handsome captain. Gregg dismisses Coombe's claim that he committed suicide, explaining that he had accidentally kicked the gas heater on while sleeping.

An 11 Feb 1947 HR news item reports that production was suspended when Gene Tierney broke her foot in an accident. She completed the filming with a cast on her leg, which was covered by the long period skirts required for the role. Charles Lang, Jr. was borrowed from Paramount for this production. His work on The Ghost and Mrs. Muir was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Black and White). The Ghost and Mrs. Muir was broadcast on Lux Radio Theatre on 1 Dec 1947, with Madeleine Carroll and Charles Boyer in the starring roles, and on Screen Directors' Playhouse on 16 Aug 1951, again with Boyer as \"Capt. Gregg.\" On 17 Oct 1956, the story was adapted as a segment of The Twentieth Century-Fox Hour on CBS-TV, under the title \"Stranger in the Night.\" Joan Fontaine and Michael Wilding starred. Twentieth Century-Fox later produced a television series, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, which starred Hope Lange, Edward Mulhare and Charles Nelson Reilly. The series, which was updated to modern New England, ran on NBC network for the 1968-69 season, then switched to the ABC network for the 1969-70 season.\n\nLess\n\nIn London at the turn of the century, young widow Lucy Muir tells her late husband's mother Angelica and overbearing sister Eva that she wants to move out of the family home and pursue a life of her own.

Unheard by Eva and Angelica, Gregg tells Lucy that he wants her to stay, and she sweetly bids her relations to \"shove off.\" Gregg then proposes that they repair her finances by collaborating on a book about his life on the sea. In the following weeks, Gregg dictates his \"unvarnished\" memoirs to Lucy, and the bond between them deepens, leaving her increasingly confused. When the book, Blood and Swash , is finished, Lucy takes the manuscript to the office of publishers Tacket and Sproule, where she attracts the attention of debonair author Miles Fairley. Miles arranges for Lucy to meet Sproule, who reads the bawdy tale in one sitting and happily agrees to publish it. After leaving the office, Lucy shares a cab with the roguish Miles, who tells her that he writes children's books under the pseudonym \"Uncle Neddy.\" One afternoon, Lucy encounters Miles painting near the beach at Whitecliff, and he proclaims his love for her. They begin courting, and although both Gregg and Martha express disdain for Miles, Lucy decides to marry him. Gregg sadly accepts her decision, and after telling the sleeping Lucy that when she wakes, she will believe that their entire relationship has been a dream, he departs. One day, Lucy goes into town to collect a royalty check and impulsively decides to visit Miles. When she arrives at his house, however, she is greeted by Miles's wife, who gently tells her that this sort of thing has happened before. Years pass, and the now grown Anna returns from the university with her beau Bill, a naval officer, and tells her mother they will soon be engaged. Lucy is stunned when Anna tells her she used to talk with Gregg's ghost when she was a child, and admits that she too encountered him in her \"dreams.\" Many years later, the elderly Lucy reads Martha a letter from Anna saying that her daughter, Little Lucy, is engaged to an airplane captain. After Martha leaves the room, Lucy dies. At that moment, Gregg appears and reaches out to Lucy, and her ghost--which resembles Lucy as a beautiful young woman--rises from the old woman's body. Arm in arm, the two spirits leave Gull Cottage and disappear into the fog.\n\nLess"
