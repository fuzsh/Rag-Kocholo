        "text": "It is really no surprise that The Welsh Folk Museum, which opened in St Fagans near Cardiff in 1948, omitted industrialised Wales, for it was founded by the Welsh nationalist poet and scholar who was also its curate: Iorwerth C. Peate. Peate saw a rural and pre-industrial artisanal based and monoglot Welsh-speaking culture as the only way to preserve Welsh identity. It is indicative of a fortress nationalism that has deep roots in Wales, a nation that has been perpetually under threat from extinction by invaders. The locus of this ‘fortress Wales’ was not, however, to be found in the anglicised south at all but in the Welsh speaking West and North. In particular, it was traditionally found in Gwynedd (formerly a kingdom centred in what would become Caernarvonshire, which at its height — roughly between 1063 and 1081 — stretched across all of North Wales to the border), heartland of the language, and home of the medieval Welsh princes and thus the landscape of national autonomy. Image makers have long been drawn to this defiant landscape."
