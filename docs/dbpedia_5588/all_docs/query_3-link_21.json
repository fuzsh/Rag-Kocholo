SAB, however, credits Pascal with contributing to screenplay construction. In response to a claim by G. Louis Peters that the story plagiarized Peters' story, \"Fool's Gold,\" Harry Chandlee, who worked on the screenplay, detailed the development of the project in correspondence in the legal records. According to Chandlee, Frank Mitchell Dazey wrote the original story around 1930 under the title \"Ghost Town\" and registered it with the Screen Writers' Guild.

Fox then dropped him from the payroll and was planning on instituting measures to collect from Tracy all costs incurred by the delay, which was estimated to be about $7,500. According to DV, this was the second time Tracy went \"AWOL\" in two months. He previously disappeared while working on Marie Galante (see below) with only ten days to go in the production. In the case of that film, Tracy agreed to reimburse the studio $25,000 and appear in the film rather than be held liable for the substitution of another actor and remake costs of $125,000. After Richard Arlen replaced Tracy, DV reported that \"a mysterious eye infection,\" which victimized Arlen, director James Cruze and actor Ralph McCullough, caused Fox to close down production on 28 Sep 1934. According to DV, \"shortly after starting work, the eyes of all three started to close and were shut tight within a few minutes.\" Production resumed on 4 Oct 1934.\n\nAccording to information in the pressbook for the film, this was Arlen's first film as an independent free-lancer after leaving Paramount. The pressbook states that Jesse L. Lasky, the producer of this film, gave Arlen his first screen role, and that Cruze and Lasky hadn't worked together since the silent era.\n\nLess\n\nArthur T.

Art begins making grand plans to turn Helldorado into a major industrial center when a call comes in from the assay office informing him that his mine contains only fool's gold. The news of gold has spread like wildfire nonetheless, and a crowd of shovel-bearing men gathers in Helldorado demanding to know the mine's whereabouts. Art is frantic, but Glenda arrives and gives him a document that turns out to be Abner's original deed stating the true location of the mine. Art shows the crowd the area where the mine was discovered, being careful to protect Abner's claim. Glenda informs him that she won't return to Van, and the two embrace.\n\nLess"
