        "text": "Description\n\nPhilip Dunne was a co-founder of the Screen Writers Guild, one of the first entertainment labor unions in Hollywood in the 1930s, and an important part of film history. He moved to Hollywood after graduating from Harvard in 1929, and worked steadily for Twentieth Century Fox through the golden days of the studio era in Hollywood. He was the first screenwriter to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His screenplay credits include How Green Was My Valley The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. He co-founded the Committee for the First Amendment to stand up to HUAC and fight the Blacklist.\n\nCopyright Statement\n\nCopyrighted.
