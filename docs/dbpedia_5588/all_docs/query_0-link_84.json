        "text": "BEST PICTURE - 1941\n\nIt is quite simply impossible for me to get through John Ford’s Oscar-winning masterpiece, How Green Was My Valley (1941) without shedding tears; its reverent and poetic celebration of life and love, perhaps even more far-reaching beyond the truthfulness in those moments. Told almost entirely in flashback, the earliest recollections are undiluted and joyous, rekindled through the bright eyes of one of Hollywood’s truly inspired child stars, Roddy McDowell, not yet fully able to comprehend the darkness that thinly veils, but has yet to fully intrude on his idyllic surroundings. Like a romantic elegy or meticulously woven arras, Ford integrates the various threads in Philip Dunne’s nonpareil screenplay, producing a precisely gratifying, often nostalgic visual rendering of a tightly knit family in decline. Plumbed through finely wrought performances from its stellar cast, remarkable, though hardly iconic performers – some, to go on and have lasting careers - How Green Was My Valley has endured the test of time, principally because it seems excruciatingly authentic, not only to its source material, but to a way of life all but overshadowed with the passage of time.\n\nWhen asked to name the favorite of all his many cinematic triumphs, Ford, a visionary in his perennial renaissance of a certain type of masculine heroism and pageantry, substituted as our collective truth for the American west, chose How Green Was My Valley above all others to stand in for the formidable girth of his body of work. Although this may seem ironic at first, given Ford’s irascible nature, and his affinity for stories devoted to manly men, in hindsight one can plainly understand the appeal for Ford in making this movie. It remains Ford’s aide memoire to his Welsh roots. And Ford, who could be crass, often adversarial, with stars – even the one most closely aligned to his own legacy – John Wayne - herein, is working with an ensemble of solid, though hardly headlining names above the title: front-lined by the luminous, Maureen O’Hara (then, only nineteen years old), as the fiery Angharad, and transcendent Walter Pigeon, as Mr. Mr. Gruffyd, her never-to-be paramour. Indeed, O’Hara would later tell stories of Ford’s tender encouragement, the way he guided everyone through their performances – especially hers, and even took time out to gather the ladies in the cast for a ritual afternoon tea between takes. If Ford did have a soft side, it is most obviously exposed in Angharad’s wistful assignations with Pigeon’s noble minister; O’Hara’s forthright beauty, brought to heel in a loveless marriage to the wealthy son of the local mine owner, poignantly offset by the memorably caustic deliberations, lightly peppered in comedic irony, by Sarah Algood’s feisty matriarch, Beth.\n\nBased on Richard Llewellyn’s best seller, How Green Was My Valley is perhaps the most perfectly realized family drama ever put on film. The story concerns the Morgan clan; Welsh miners, overseen by a morally benevolent, if outwardly stern patriarch, Gwilym (masterfully realized by Donald Crisp) and his devoted, Beth. Crisp and Allgood are genuine troopers. Crisp in particular, a consummate professional, who rarely escaped being hired in support of other actors, often relegated to minor parts, but who enriched virtually every movie in which he appeared, is arguably the real star of How Green Was My Valley. For generations yet to follow, Crisp’s indomitable – and yes, ‘crisp’ pater, is precisely the sort one would wish for from a loving, but propitious head of the family, the veritable glue that keeps the Morgans honest and together. As an interesting aside: Donald Crisp would take home the Best Supporting Actor’s Oscar for this performance (shamelessly, the only time the Academy honored him so), go on to appear in close to 200 movies, and, through wise investments in business and real estate, died at the ripe old age of 92 in 1974, one of the richest actors of his generation. Richard Llewellyn’s novel, first published to instant acclaim in 1939, is narrated by Huw Morgan – the youngest member of the clan; reflections from a middle-aged man looking back on his childhood and youth with warmhearted reminiscences. At the time of publication, Llewellyn claimed to have based the book on personal experiences. Upon his death, this was revealed as a lie. The English-born author had actually culled his inspiration from conversations with local mining families in Gilfach Goch; most of the situations depicted in the book, bearing no earthly resemblance to his upbringing.\n\nIn Hollywood, the novel’s runaway international success was not lost on 2oth Century-Fox mogul, Darryl F. Zanuck. Zanuck, who had begun his career as a writer, though hardly of Llewellyn’s caliber, nevertheless could recognize quality authorship at a glance. Securing the rights to the novel for a cool $300,000, Zanuck envisioned How Green Was My Valley as a monumental 3-hour epic shot in Technicolor; doing for Wales what David O. Selznick’s Oscar-winning masterpiece, Gone With The Wind had for the Old South. Wartime rationing prevented Zanuck’s vision from taking hold. It also discouraged Ford from his desire to shoot the picture abroad in authentic locations. Instead, Zanuck and Ford compensated by having art directors, Richard Day and Nathan Juran construct a full-on Welsh mine and its adjacent town on a hillside at the Fox Ranch in Calabasas; the set, employing 150 craftsmen over a period of six months to achieve its incredible authenticity.\n\nPhotographing How Green Was My Valley in B&W proved an inspiration, Arthur C. Miller’s gorgeous cinematography typifying the stark natural beauty and gradual decline of the valley, forever tainted in coal dust. To add yet another layer of authenticity, Zanuck elected to hire a Welsh choral, led by Tudor Williams, from a nearby Los Angeles’ church, under a special dispensation from the Screen Actors’ Guild. How Green Was My Valley soars with some of the finest, and, most rousing, stout-hearted traditional Welsh/Irish songs and ballads, including ‘Men of Harlech’ – under the main titles, ‘Llwyn Onn’– serenaded as a heartrending epitaph to Angharad’s wedding day, ‘Calon Lan’, ‘God Save the Queen’ and, ‘Bryn Calfaria’ – an ebullient ‘coming home from work’ song. These are interpolated with a first-class underscore by Fox’s resident composer/conductor extraordinaire, Alfred Newman.\n\nFord begins his story in the present: our narrator, never seen from the neck up, preparing a modest kit bag for his departure from the only place he has ever known as home. Yet the valley of the present, with its stone-pillared courtyards barren of vegetation, in ruins, and void of any signs of life, save a few aged scraps of humanity, unable or unwilling to leave it as yet, bears little resemblance to the rolling countryside of natural promise into which we will shortly regress. In less than a generation, we come to know the valley in its prime – an emerald oasis with a thriving village of neatly kept houses built at the foot of the colliery; its black-faced minions, happy-faced, and, returning after a hard day’s effort of toiling deep within the bowels of the earth. The Morgans are well-respected within this community. Gwilym is, in fact, an intermediary between the mine’s boss, Mr. Evans (Lionel Pape) and the men – trusted, admired and charged with facilitating their productivity. Gwilym’s eldest son, Ivor (Patric Knowles) has become engaged to Bronwyn (Anna Lee) – a handsome lass from the neighboring village. This announcement breaks the heart of the Morgan’s youngest son, Huw (Roddy McDowell) who, while still a boy, has nevertheless developed a puppy love crush on his elder brother’s wife. At the wedding reception, the Morgan’s only daughter, Angharad (Maureen O’Hara) becomes smitten with the town’s newly-appointed minister, the kind-hearted Mr. Gruffyd (Walter Pigeon).\n\nHowever, in a town where even the least flirtatious provocation can be misconstrued as sinful, the tender relationship between Angharad and Mr. Gruffyd is doomed from the start, particularly after Gwilym is approached by Mr. Evans to broker an arrangement for his son, Lestyn (Marten Lamont). In a time when a young woman was considered little more than property, servile and obligated to the wills and whims of her father, Angharad’s complicity to enter into this loveless – but otherwise ‘respectable’ marriage is expected. Indeed, Gwilym believes it will ensure, if not her happiness, then most assuredly, security for the future. As the wife of a prominent businessman, she will want for nothing – except genuine passion. In the meantime, the workers have become increasingly disgruntled with the owners. Gwilym’s adult sons, Ianto (John Loder), Ivor, Davy (Richard Fraser), Gwilym Jr. (Evan S. Evans) and Owen (James Monks) propose a rally for a union. Gwilym, who regards even talk of a union as ‘socialist nonsense’ refuses to partake in their efforts. But Mr. Gruffyd encourages their decision to strike, citing that, individually, they are weak, but collectively, each may share in the strength and safety of their numbers. This decision backfires as the owners call the bluff and the men are locked out. As the sting of sustained unemployment bears down hard, a bitter resentment begins to mount. The mood turns violent as neighboring men, hungry and careworn, throw rocks at the Morgan home, shattering its front window.\n\nForging into a blinding snowstorm, Beth confronts the strikers at their rally, declaring that if any harm befalls her husband, the town will have her reckoning to endure. On the way home, Beth loses her way and falls into the frigid lake with Huw clinging to her side. Saved at the last possible moment from freezing to death, Beth and Huw face months of painful recovery at home. As spring creeps over the windowsill, Beth struggles to come downstairs from her bedroom, determined to show Huw that his own health may too soon be restored. Indeed, the boy has suffered a graver malady and setback – crippling self-doubt, resulting in depression. Mr. Gruffyd arrives one afternoon. Unable to shake the boy free of his melancholy, he declares “Where is the light I thought to see in your eyes?” before taking Huw – whose legs remain weakened by hypothermia – on his back, and, into the hills just beyond. There, Gruffyd encourages Huw to walk again on his own. Meanwhile, an accident at the mine claims Ivor. Bronwyn moves in with the Morgans temporarily and gives birth to her late husband’s only son. At approximately the same time, Huw is sent to school. It is Gwilym’s sincere hope the boy will become something better than a miner. Indeed, he has promise. Regrettably, the schoolmaster, Mr. Parry (Arthur Shields) is a ruthless disciplinarian who regards Huw with a contemptible desire to see him fail. After being pummeled by a schoolyard bully, Huw is taught to defend himself by the Morgan’s close friend - fisticuffs champion, Dai Bando (Rhys Williams). Although Huw is successful in a subsequent bout at school, Mr. Parry exploits his victory as an excuse to severely cane him, resulting in Dai Bando returning to give Parry a taste of his own medicine.\n\nAngharad marries Lestyn and moves away to a great house in a neighboring village. Despite having provided Angharad with every luxury, Gwilym’s intervention has deprived his daughter of the satisfaction of knowing genuine happiness. The busybodies in town waste no time concocting rumors about Angharad and Mr. Gruffyd. As a result, the church deacons elect to remove Mr. Gruffyd from his post as their pastor. Having left school, Huw takes a job in the colliery with his father and brothers, moving into the home Bronwyn once shared with Ivor to support her. The Morgan clan is split apart yet again, as Davy, Owen and Gwilym Jr. elect to leave the valley for more fruitful prospects in America. An explosion at the mine traps Gwilym. Hurrying to his rescue, the men arrive too late, and Gwilym’s remains are brought to the surface by a stoic Mr. Gruffyd and Huw. Aside: the look of utter desolation caught in young Roddy McDowell’s eyes in this scene is penetrating and will break your heart. Our flashback concludes with Beth’s hopeful, haunting vision, telling Bromwyn she saw Gwilym ‘just now’ and Ivor again, walking off together in the distance. We return to the present and realize Huw is all grown up, having just finished his packing; his declaration that “Men like my father cannot die. They are with me still, real in memory as they were in flesh, loving and beloved forever. How green was my valley then?” resonating with a compendium of flashbacks that extol the idyllic memories of a way of life, alas, no more.\n\nHow Green Was My Valley is a superior example of 2oth Century-Fox’s studio craftsmanship at its zenith. The amalgam of Fox Picture Corp. and 20th Century Pictures may have come late to Hollywood’s party (the studio, officially founded on May, 31st, 1935), but under Zanuck’s aegis, Fox’s ascendance as one of the irrefutable titans in the industry in less than a decade, made even the cynics take pause. From the advantage of hindsight, we can clearly take stock of the studio’s heritage as a vibrant assortment of outstanding artistic achievements; How Green Was My Valley, among its rarest crown jewels. Apart from its’ remarkable production design, the picture ought to be highly regarded for its ensemble cast; Zanuck, having assembled actors – rather than stars – to populate this intimate familial saga – a character study of life’s triumphs and tragedies. The result – not a false note among them; the emotion, wrought genuinely, and, the alliances, wholly believable. In hindsight, it seems predestined John Ford should have directed this picture; Ford’s natural affinity for blending the lithe and lyrical with the harsh and cruel, weaving his rich tapestry of human dignity, frailty and the understanding heart that beat so gently beneath his outwardly cantankerous façade. So, it is perhaps a minor revelation to recall Ford was not Zanuck’s first choice to direct this movie; rather, an impressive substitute, after odds-on favorite, William Wyler bowed out. Many a story told on celluloid before and since its time has tried to evoke the vast integrity of mankind, as distilled into the microcosm of just a simple ‘little’ story about people; applying universal truths to mitigating circumstances. But How Green Was My Valley outshines them all in its affecting genuineness.\n\nFox Home Video’s Blu-ray does justice to Ford’s masterpiece. Previous DVD incarnations have yielded images too stark and far too gritty to evoke Arthur Miller’s cinematography. By comparison, this Blu-ray radiates every stunning grain in Miller’s sumptuous visual design. Truly, watching How Green Was My Valley on Blu-ray is like seeing the movie for the very first time with a heightened sense of Miller and Ford’s sublime visual storytelling. The B&W image reveals great depth and tonality, close-ups, bringing out every handsome, craggy detail. Establishing shots are razor sharp with film grain appearing indigenous to its source. We get 2 audio tracks: a DTS ‘stereo’ and the original ‘restored’ mono. The mono here is preferred, as the ‘stereo’ merely splits the full spectrum across two channels. Extras are all imported from Fox’s long-defunct ‘Studio Classics’ DVD series: an episode of Hollywood: Back Story, providing a truncated ‘making of’ and an audio commentary. Bottom line: while I could have wished for Fox to do more with the extras, the quality of their transfer is A-1 perfection. Very highly recommended!\n\nFILM RATING (out of 5 – 5 being the best)\n\n5+\n\nVIDEO/AUDIO\n\n5\n\nEXTRAS"
