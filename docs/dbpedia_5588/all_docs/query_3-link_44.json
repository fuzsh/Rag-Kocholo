        "text": "Notes\n\nA relatively early draft (though denoted \"Final\") of Dunne's screenplay for the adaptation of Kathleen Winsor's period costume novel to the screen. Ring Lardner Jr. is credited with having a considerable hand in the final form of the script that made it to the screen, but for this draft, his participation is not credited. It would seem most likely that Lardner, then the highest paid screenwriter working in Hollywood, stepped in at some point either prior to, or after this draft and made his contribution. The film was directed by Otto Preminger (with whom Lardner had worked on LAURA in 1943) and John M. Stahl, and starred Linda Darnell, Cornell Wilde, Jessica Tandy, et al. It was formally released in 1947, the dark year that found Lardner and many others working in Hollywood called before the HUAC.\n\nAbout Us\n\nEstablished in 1975, William Reese Company are among the leading specialists in the fields of Americana and world travel, and also maintain a large and eclectic inventory of literary first editions and antiquarian books of the 18th through 21st centuries.\n\nDelivery\n\nShipping costs are based on books weighing 2.2 lb, or 1 kg without special services.
