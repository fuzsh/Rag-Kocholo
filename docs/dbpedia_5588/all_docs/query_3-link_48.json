        "text": "Early work\n\nHuston was born in a small town in Missouri that his grandfather claimed to have won in a poker game. Huston’s father, Walter Huston, had given up stage acting for work as a civil engineer that took his family to Texas and Indiana before he decided to return to acting in 1909. Within a few years Huston’s parents were divorced, and he spent his childhood moving between his father, who initially returned to vaudeville, and his mother, Reah, who worked as a journalist and taught him to both ride and bet on horses. Although he suffered from kidney disease and an enlarged heart, Huston overcame a frail, often bedridden youth to become so robust a teenager that he was the amateur lightweight boxing champion of California (with a distinctive broken nose to show for it). After briefly studying painting in Los Angeles, Huston moved to New York City in 1924 to become an actor and performed with the Provincetown Players in Greenwich Village. In 1925, while vacationing in Mexico, he became an honorary member of the Mexican cavalry.\n\nReturning to New York in 1929, Huston took a job as a reporter at the New York Graphic, where his mother was then working. He also began writing and publishing short stories, most notably “Fool,” which appeared in the literary magazine American Mercury. In 1931 Huston went to Hollywood. After a false start as a contract writer with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), he moved to Universal, contributing to the screenplays of a pair of films starring his father, A House Divided (1931) and Law and Order (1932). During this period of hard drinking and carousing, a car that Huston was driving hit and killed a pedestrian. Consumed with guilt, he moved to London, where he intended to write for the British studio Gaumont but instead lived a ne’er-do-well existence. After a stint in Paris painting, he returned to the United States.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nBy 1937 Huston was back in Hollywood, where Warner Brothers signed him to a screenwriting contract. This time his career was on track. Huston collaborated on the scripts for William Wyler’s Jezebel (1938), Anatole Litvak’s The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse (1938), and William Dieterle’s Juarez (1939) before directing his father in A Passage to Bali on Broadway in 1940.\n\nFilms of the 1940s\n\nHuston then cowrote three exceptional films: Dr. Ehrlich’s Magic Bullet (1940) for Dieterle, High Sierra (1941) for Raoul Walsh, and Sergeant York (1941) for Howard Hawks, the last of which earned Huston his first Academy Award nomination, for best original screenplay in 1942.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The Maltese Falcon had already been filmed by Warner Brothers in 1931 and 1936, but Huston’s proto-film noir had the advantage of Huston as the screenwriter, Humphrey Bogart as the amoral private eye Sam Spade, Mary Astor as the immoral Brigid O’Shaughnessey, and Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre as a pair of lovable cutthroats. It was nominated for the Academy Award for best picture.\n\nAfter directing the melodrama In This Our Life (1942), Huston was unable to complete his next project, the high-seas espionage tale Across the Pacific (1942), because he was drafted. For the U.S. Army’s Pictorial Service, Huston directed and narrated the renowned World War II documentaries Report from the Aleutians (1943), The Battle of San Pietro (1945), and Let There Be Light, the last a disturbing study of emotionally unstable veterans in a Long Island hospital that was so powerful that it was not given a public release until the early 1980s. Huston was discharged from the army in 1945 with the rank of major and awarded the Legion of Merit for making his films under perilous battle conditions.\n\nBack in the United States, he worked on the scripts for Robert Siodmak’s The Killers and Orson Welles’s The Stranger (both 1946). Huston also directed Jean-Paul Sartre’s No Exit on Broadway in 1946. In 1947, as the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) geared up for its initial wave of hearings into the Hollywood community’s past or present communist affiliations, Huston joined with director William Wyler and screenwriter Philip Dunne in establishing the Committee for the First Amendment. Huston was part of a delegation of industry liberals—including Bogart and Lauren Bacall—who flew to Washington, D.C., to support those witnesses who had taken a confrontational stand when called to testify before the HUAC. Like other members of the delegation, however, Huston was put off by the aggressive belligerence of the “unfriendly” witnesses who would become known as the Hollywood Ten, though he remained disgusted by the proceedings as a whole.\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) was Huston’s return to motion-picture directing in Hollywood. Adapted by Huston from an obscure novel by the mysterious, reclusive writer B. Traven and shot on location in Mexico, it starred Bogart in the decidedly unheroic role of a paranoid prospector, Fred C. Dobbs. As good as Bogart was in depicting Dobbs’s descent into madness, most critics believed that he was out-acted by Walter Huston as the grizzled, sagacious Howard, who tries in vain to keep greed from consuming the little treasure-seeking band. (This was the first time that Huston had cast his father in a major role, though he had appeared in unbilled cameos in The Maltese Falcon and In This Our Life.) Although The Treasure of the Sierra Madre would become one of Huston’s greatest critical triumphs and continues to be widely considered one of the best films of its time, it was a box-office disaster, perhaps because of its grim ending and the daring casting of Bogart against type. Still, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for best picture, Huston won the awards for best director and best screenplay, and his father was named best supporting actor.\n\nBogart, Bacall, Edward G. Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, and Claire Trevor starred in Huston’s next film, Key Largo (1948), a suspenseful adaptation of a Maxwell Anderson play that is regarded as a classic film noir. With a screenplay by Huston and Richard Brooks, it is set in a small hotel in the Florida Keys that is taken over by a gangster (Robinson) who has made a clandestine return from deportation to Cuba. Trevor won the Academy Award for best supporting actress for her portrayal of the gangster’s mistress. Cuba was then the setting for We Were Strangers (1949), an atmospheric account of revolutionaries’ attempt to overthrow the government, which starred Jennifer Jones and John Garfield."
