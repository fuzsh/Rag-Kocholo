        "text": ":\"This article is about an American screenwriter. For the UK politician, see Philip Dunne MP.\"\n\nPhilip Dunne (February 11, 1908 – June 2, 1992) was a Hollywood screenwriter, film director, and producer, who worked prolifically from 1932 until 1965. He spent the majority of his career at 20th Century Fox crafting well regarded romantic and historical dramas, usually adapted from another medium. Dunne was a leading Writers Guild organizer and was politically active during the \"Hollywood Blacklist\" episode of the 1940's-50's. He is best known for the films \"How Green Was My Valley\" (1941), \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" (1947), \"The Robe\" (1953), and \"The Agony and the Ecstasy\" (1965).\n\nBiography\n\n{|align=\"right\"|Philip Ives Dunne was born in New York City, the son of Chicago syndicated columnist Finley Peter Dunne and Margaret Ives (Abbott) Dunne, the daughter of the \"Chicago Tribune\"'s book reviewer and novelist, Mary Ives Abbott.\n\nAlthough a Roman Catholic, he attended Middlesex School (1920-1925) and Harvard University (1925-29). Immediately after graduation, he boarded a train for Hollywood. His first screenplay (uncredited) was \"Me and My Gal\", released in 1932. His first credited screenplay was \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", released in 1934. After working for various studios, he moved to 20th Century Fox in 1937, where he would remain for 25 years (excepting 4 years civilian war service during World War II), scripting 36 films in total and directing 10. He also produced several of his later films.\n\nDunne was a co-founder of the Screen Writers Guild and served as vice-president of its successor, the Writers Guild of America from 1938 to 1940. He later served on the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) from 1946 to 1948.\n\nBefore World War II, he was a member of the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, a group founded in May 1940 that advocated military materiel aid to Britain as the best way to keep the United States out of the war.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945, Dunne was the Chief of Production for the Motion Picture Bureau, U.S. Office of War Information, Overseas Branch. Notably, he produced the non-fiction short \"The Town\" (1944), directed by Josef von Sternberg, which has received some critical acclaim.\n\nIn 1947 he co-founded the Committee for the First Amendment to protest the House Un-American Activities Committee's (HUAC) investigation of Communist influence in Hollywood. He appeared before HUAC with other Hollywood figures in a well publicized meeting in October 1947.\n\nDunne married the former Amanda Duff on July 13, 1939. They had three children, Miranda, Philippa, and Jessica.\n\nIn 1980 he published his memoirs, \"Take Two: A Life in Movies and Politics\".\n\nDunne died of cancer on June 2, 1992 in Malibu, California, aged 84.\n\nCareer highlights\n\nDunne received two Academy Award nominations for screenwriting: \"How Green Was My Valley\" (1941) and \"David and Bathsheba\" (1951). He also received a Golden Globe nomination for his screen adaptation of Irving Stone's novel \"The Agony and the Ecstasy\" (1965), as well as several peer awards from the Writers Guild of America (WGA).\n\nMany notable directors worked with Dunne's screenplays, including Carol Reed, John Ford, Jacques Tourneur, Elia Kazan, Otto Preminger, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and Michael Curtiz, among others.\n\nIn 1961 he directed \"Wild in the Country\" starring Elvis Presley, from a screenplay by Clifford Odets. In 1962 he directed \"Lisa, based on the novel \"The Inspector\" by Jan de Hartog featuring Stephen Boyd and Delores Hart, which was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Picture - Drama.\n\nThe 1992 film \"The Last of the Mohicans\", directed by Michael Mann and starring Daniel Day-Lewis, was based on Dunne's 1936 screenplay of the Fenimore Cooper novel.\n\nIn addition to screenwriting, Dunne wrote syndicated newspaper articles and was a contributor to \"The New Yorker\" and \"The Atlantic Monthly\" magazines. He also wrote a stage play, \"Mr. Dooley's America\" (1976), based on his father's humor, and another, \"Politics\" (1980). His books include \"Mr Dooley Remembers\" (1963) and \"Take Two-A Life in Movies and Politics\" (1980). His short stories appeared in the \"New Yorker\" and his essays have been regular features of \"Time Magazine, the \"Los Angeles Times\", and the \"Harvard Review\". He was a winner of the Laurel Award (1962) and Valentine Davies Award (1974).\n\nHe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in front of 6725 Hollywood Blvd., just west of Las Palmas Ave.\n\nPhilip Dunne and the Hollywood Blacklist\n\nDunne was a key participant in the Hollywood Blacklist episode of the 1940's and 1950's. In 1947 he co-founded the Committee for the First Amendment with John Huston and William Wyler in response to hearings held by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Dunne, Huston, and Wyler, along with fellow members Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Danny Kaye, and Gene Kelly, appeared before HUAC in Washington, D.C. in October 1947, protesting HUAC's activities and methods. Dunne was never subpoenaed or blacklisted himself, nor was he accused of any Communist Party affiliations.\n\nAs a writer and director, Dunne frequently worked with others who either were, had been, or would become blacklisted, including Ring Lardner Jr., Clifford Odets, Albert Maltz, and Marsha Hunt. Additionally, Dunne was a character witness for Dalton Trumbo at the latter's trial for contempt of Congress.\n\nThe original credits for \"The Robe\" (1953) gave Dunne the sole screenplay credit, when in fact Hollywood Ten member Albert Maltz had made significant contributions. In 1997, the WGA restored full writing credits to blacklisted writers whose names were left out of films they worked on. The following is from the WGA's \"Blacklisted Writers Receive Credit\" press release of April 2, 1997:\n\n\"In the case of The Robe there was an extraordinary amount of information gathered to indicate that Maltz was entitled to shared screenplay credit. In addition, Philip Dunne did not believe he deserved sole screenplay credit but it was not until many years later that he learned that a blacklisted writer had worked on the project. Amanda Dunne, Philip's widow, confirms that Philip would have been happy to share screenplay credit with Maltz.\"\n\nDunne's political stances were decidedly liberal and reformist, but he was also determinedly anti-Communist. His involvement in the Committee for the First Amendment can arguably be read as just that - support for Constitutional free speech against a government entity (HUAC) that, to Dunne, seemed determined to usurp those rights. At various times dating to before the Second World War, he clashed with fellow members of the Screen Writers Guild whom he felt were \"pro-Stalin\" Communists. Dunne's anti-Communist leanings would seem to be verified by his uninterrupted employment as a screenwriter on major Hollywood productions throughout the blacklist period, despite his quite vocal denunciation of HUAC.\n\nQuotes\n\n*\"Never in all my years in this chancy and unstable profession did I ever realize that I was sleepwalking along a precipice. I ignored the fact that the rate of professional mortality among screen writers is extremely high...It wasn't courage or arrogance or insensitivity; I suspect it was the irascible Horatio Alger in my blood. If I had it to do all over again I would perish of sheer fright.\"\n\n*\"All over town the industrious communist tail wagged the lazy liberal dog.\"\n\nelected filmography\n\n*\"The Agony and the Ecstasy\" (1965, screenplay)\n\n*\"Blindfold\" (1965, screenplay and director)\n\n*\"Wild in the Country\" (1961, director)\n\n*\"Ten North Frederick\" (1958, screenplay and director)\n\n*\"The Egyptian\" (1954, screenplay with Casey Robinson)\n\n*\"The Robe\" (1953, screenplay, with Albert Maltz)\n\n*\"David and Bathsheba\" (1951, screenplay)\n\n*\"Pinky\" (1949, screenplay with Dudley Nichols)\n\n*\"Forever Amber\" (1947, screenplay with Ring Lardner Jr.)\n\n*\"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" (1947, screenplay)\n\n*\"Son of Fury\" (1942, screenplay)\n\n*\"How Green Was My Valley\" (1941, screenplay)\n\n*\"Johnny Apollo\" (1940, screenplay with Rowland Brown)\n\n*\"Stanley and Livingstone\" (1939, screenplay with Julien Josephson)\n\n*\"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1936, screenplay)\n\n*\"The Count of Monte Cristo\" (1934, screenplay with Rowland V.
