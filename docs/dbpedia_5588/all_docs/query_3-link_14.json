        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n71 Philip Dunne Interview by James Bawden You can tell a lot about a screenwriter by looking at his or her list of credits over the years.Some are known for the concoction of original scripts from basic research or from their own imagination, while others are noted for their superb ability to adapt a popular novel or stage play for the screen,an often difficult task since the mediums of literature and cinema are so radically different. Philip Dunne was gifted in both traditions,but he was extremely valuable as an adaptor of published works.Movie studios often paid enormous sums for a workable screenplay they could depend upon. In Dunne’s busiest years during Hollywood’s golden age of the 1930s through the 1950s, it wasn’t easy to keep the readers of either a classic novel or a contemporary best seller happy with the movie version because the studios exerted strict control over the length of a film. If the studio wanted a film of under two hours, you knew you were going to have to throw away a good deal of the book that millions loved. But if you could find a way to thread that critical needle, you might bring satisfied smiles to the faces of moviegoers who tended to be supremely prejudiced against Hollywood writers who made good books into bad movies—as well as film fans who never read anything but the comics page. Dunne’s list of credits is lined with the titles of critically acclaimed films adapted from long and sometimes complex works of literature. Take the literary classic The Last of the Mohicans, by James Fenimore Cooper. It had been filmed often in the silent days, but in 1936 Dunne adapted it for an action-packed new version starring Randolph Scott as Cooper’s pioneer hero Hawkeye. Respectful to the original, it managed to tell the famous story in exciting, breathless fashion in just ninety-one minutes. Three years later, Dunne’s version of Louis Bromfield’s best seller The Rains Came (1939) was a dramatic triumph and a box office hit. In 1941 THEY MADE THE MOVIES 72 Dunne tackled the sprawling, unconventionally constructed novel How Green Was My Valley, winner of the Oscar for Best Picture. By eliminating the second half of the story, he created a hit that came in under two hours in length. In the 1950s Dunne wrote the original screenplay for David and Bathsheba (1951), a biblical extravaganza that was a huge hit, and adapted Lloyd C.Douglas’s novel The Robe (1953),another box office hit that introduced the modern wide-screen era. In that period he also began his serious career as a director with such films as Ten North Frederick (1958), using his own screenplay adapted from the novel by John O’Hara. During the final phase of his career, Dunne continued to write for the screen, but also produced and directed many films. Setting the Scene Philip Dunne’s name always stood high on the list of the really great screenwriters ,which is why I was delighted to learn he was willing to do an interview with me in 1990, even though his health wasn’t good and he wasn’t doing much press in those days. Hesitant at first, he finally invited me to lunch at his home in Malibu. Dunne lived on a sprawling cliffside estate,the heavy surf of the Pacific pounding hundreds of feet below.As I walked up the trail from the road, a ferret stuck its head out of a rock pile to say hello and seagulls squawked as they flew over the sea.After lunch,we repaired to his scholarly writer’s hut, crammed with mementoes of a lifetime in the movies. We started our chat with a brief biographical résumé. Born in New York City in 1908, Dunne was the younger son of syndicated Chicago columnist Finley Peter Dunne. He got his education at Harvard University and after graduation took the first train for Hollywood. The Interview BAWDEN:You really wanted to become a screenwriter? DUNNE:Always,although perhaps not as much in the silent days.And it’s true I took the train,bummed around a bit and first wrote dialogue for the 1932 Spencer Tracy movie Me and My Gal. I did snippets of talk, particularly when we hear what the characters are really thinking—a spoof of Strange Interlude [the stage play by Eugene O’Neill]. [167.71..."
