        "text": "I am packing my belongings in the shawl\n\nmy mother used to wear to the market,\n\nand I am going from my valley.\n\nAnd this time I shall never return.\n\nI am leaving behind me\n\nmy 50 years of memory.\n\nMemory.\n\nStrange that the mind will forget so much\n\nof what only this moment is passed,\n\nand yet hold clear and bright\n\nthe memory of what happened years ago,\n\nof men and women long since dead.\n\nYet who shall say\n\nwhat is real and what is not?\n\nCan I believe my friends all gone,\n\nwhen their voices are still a glory in my ears?\n\nNo. And I will stand to say no and no again,\n\nfor they remain a living truth within my mind.\n\nThere is no fence nor hedge\n\naround time that is gone.\n\nYou can go back and have what\n\nyou like of it, if you can remember.\n\nSo I can close my eyes on my valley\n\nas it is today and it is gone,\n\nand I see it as it was when I was a boy.\n\nGreen it was, and possessed\n\nof the plenty of the earth.\n\nIn all Wales, there was none so beautiful.\n\nEverything I ever learnt as\n\na small boy came from my father,\n\nand I never found anything he ever told me\n\nto be wrong or worthless.\n\nThe simple lessons he taught me\n\nare as sharp and clear in my mind\n\nas if I had heard them only yesterday.\n\nIn those days, the black slag,\n\nthe waste of the coal pits,\n\nhad only begun to cover the side of our hill,\n\nnot yet enough to mar the countryside,\n\nnor blacken the beauty of our village.\n\nFor the colliery had only begun to poke\n\nits skinny black fingers through the green.\n\nI can hear even now\n\nthe voice of my sister Angharad.\n\nHuw!\n\nAngharad!\n\nCoal miners were my father\n\nand all my brothers, and proud of their trade.\n\n- Gwilym Morgan, three pounds seven.\n\n- Thank you, sir.\n\nLanto Morgan, three pounds seven.\n\nIvor Morgan, three pounds seven.\n\nDavy Morgan, two pounds five.\n\nOwen Morgan, two pounds five.\n\nYoung Gwilym Morgan, one pound ten.\n\nSomeone would strike up a song,\n\nand the valley would ring\n\nwith the sound of many voices.\n\nFor singing is in my people\n\nas sight is in the eye.\n\nThen came the scrubbing,\n\nout in the back yard.\n\nIt was the duty of my sister Angharad\n\nto bring the buckets of hot water and cold,\n\nand I performed what little tasks I could\n\nas my father and brothers\n\nscrubbed the coal dust from their backs.\n\nMost would come off them,\n\nbut some would stay for life.\n\nIt is the honourable badge of the coal miner,\n\nand I envied it\n\non my father and grown-up brothers.\n\nScrub and scrub,\n\nMr Coal would lie there and laugh at you.\n\nThere was always a baron of beef or\n\na shoulder or leg of lamb before my father.\n\nThere was never any talk\n\nwhile we were eating.\n\nI never met anybody\n\nwhose talk was better than good food.\n\nMy mother was always on the run,\n\nalways the last to start her dinner,\n\nand the first to finish.\n\nFor if my father was the head of our house,\n\nmy mother was its heart.\n\nAfter the dishes had been washed,\n\nthe box was brought to the table\n\nfor the spending money to be handed out.\n\nNo one in our valley had ever seen a bank.\n\nWe kept our savings on the mantelpiece.\n\nMy father used to say\n\nthat money was made to be spent,\n\njust as men spend\n\ntheir strength and brains in earning it,\n\nand as willingly.\n\nBut always with a purpose.\n\nThank you, Dadda.\n\nOut of the house and across the street,\n\nas I had run a hundred times before.\n\nSoftly now, for respect for chapel\n\nwas the first thing my father taught us.\n\nThen straight to Mrs Tossal the Shop,\n\nfor that toffee which you could\n\nchew for hours, it seems to me now.\n\nAnd even after it had gone down,\n\nyou could swallow\n\nand still find the taste of it\n\nhiding behind your tongue.\n\nIt is with me now, so many years later.\n\nIt makes me think of so much\n\nthat was good that is gone.\n\nIt was on this afternoon\n\nthat I first saw Bron - Bronwyn.\n\nShe had come over from the next valley\n\nfor her first call on my father and mother.\n\nIs this Gwilym Morgan's house?\n\nYou must be Huw.\n\n- Is that you, Bronwyn?\n\n- Yes.\n\nThere's lovely you are.\n\nI think I fell in love with Bronwyn then.\n\nPerhaps it is foolish to think a child could\n\nfall in love, but I am the child that was,\n\nand nobody knows how I felt, except only me.\n\n- I'm so proud for lvor.\n\n- I'm the one to be proud.\n\nYou think well of our lvor?\n\nIt seems only a few months\n\nsince he was scratching around here\n\nlike this one, with his mouth open.\n\nThis is Bronwyn, Huw,\n\nwho's to be your sister.\n\nWe have met already.\n\nBe careful of the basket.\n\nThere's shortcake in it.\n\nThis is not for you. You will have\n\nyour time to come. Run along now.\n\nBronwyn and lvor were to be married\n\nby the new preacher, Mr Gruffydd,\n\nwho had come from the university at Cardiff.\n\nThis was my first sight of him.\n\n# Now here's a man won't get drunk,\n\ncan't get drunk, shan't get drunk\n\n# Here's a man won't get drunk, Peter O'Pea\n\n# From my heel to my toe,\n\nfrom my toe to my knee\n\n# I'll walk the line, chalk the line, Peter O'Pea\n\n- Good evening, Mr Morgan.\n\n- Yes, indeed, sir.\n\n- Excuse me.\n\n- Thank you.\n\nCome now, boys. Back to work.\n\nIvor, find Dai Griffiths and Idris John\n\nand bring them to Mr Evans' office.\n\n- Will we come with you?\n\n- No. This is a matter for the older men.\n\n- Home to your mother.\n\n- But...\n\nLeave it now, Davy.\n\nWell, come.\n\n- Why aren't you washed?\n\n- We were waiting for you.\n\nThe cut is only a few shillings.\n\nThere will still be plenty for us.\n\nA bit of supper now, is it, girl?\n\nIt is because they are not\n\ngetting the old price for coal.\n\n- Come and wash now.\n\n- May we speak first, sir?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- They did not give you the real reason.\n\nWe've been expecting it since\n\nthe ironworks at Dowlais closed down.\n\nWhat have the ironworks to do with us?\n\nThe men from Dowlais will work for any\n\nwage, so all our wages must come down.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning. Watch now.\n\nThey will cut us again and still again, until\n\nthey have this as empty as their promises.\n\n- A good worker is worth good wages.\n\n- Not while there are three men for every job.\n\nWhy should the owners pay more\n\nif men will work for less?\n\nBecause the owners are not savages.\n\nThey are men too, like us.\n\nMen, yes, but not like us.\n\nWould they deal with you just now, sir,\n\nwhen you went to them?\n\n- No.\n\n- Because they have power and we have none.\n\n- How will we get power, then? From the air?\n\n- No. From a union of all the men.\n\nUnion, is it? I never thought I'd hear\n\nmy own sons talking socialist nonsense.\n\n- It's good sense.\n\n- Unless we stand together...\n\n- I've had enough of this talk.\n\n- But, Father, it does...\n\nCome and wash now.\n\nYour good mother will be waiting.\n\nDo you think I'll let them make you stand\n\nin the rain and not raise my hands to stop it?\n\nHush, Davy.\n\n- Who gave you permission to speak?\n\n- It is too important for silence.\n\n- They're trying to punish you because...\n\n- It is not more important than good manners.\n\nBut what are we going to do about it?\n\nYou'll die of cold when it comes to snow.\n\nLet us stand together\n\nand see how they act then.\n\nRight. The men will come out\n\nif we say the word.\n\nAll the pits are ready."
