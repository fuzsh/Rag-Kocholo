The extant and fossil marine mollusc faunas of Aotearoa New Zealand are relatively well known. A total of 4371 extant species and subspecies are presently recognised, of which 80% are endemic to New Zealand. This total represents a 19% increase (688 taxa) since Spencer et al. (2009) (Table 14.1; Figs 14.1, 14.2). Of these, 2,491 species are named, and 1,880 are known, undescribed species. About 7,000 species are known from the fossil record, which includes many extant taxa. A checklist of the extant marine Mollusca is provided here. A comprehensive revision of the taxonomic treatments of extant taxa, including listings of unnamed taxa, new synonymies and resurrections from synonymy is currently in preparation (Marshall, B.A. (Ed.) in prep.). Extinct marine mollusc taxa are not reviewed here.

To interpret changes in biodiversity through geological time, it is necessary first to correct for biases in sampling effort related to variations in the exposure of rocks and recovery of fossils with age. Data from New Zealand indicate that outcrop area is likely to be a reliable proxy of rock volume in both stable cratonic regions, where the paleobiodiversity record is strongly correlated with relative sea level, and on tectonically active margins. In contrast, another potential proxy, the number of rock formations, is a poor predictor of outcrop area or sampling effort in the New Zealand case.

Size bias in the fossil record limits its use for interpreting patterns of past biodiversity and ecological change. Using comparative size frequency distributions of exceptionally good regional records of New Zealand Holocene and Cenozoic Mollusca in museum archive collections, we derive first-order estimates of the magnitude of the bias against small body size and the effect of this bias on completeness of the fossil record. Our database of 3907 fossil species represents an original living pool of 9086 species, from which ˜36% have been removed by size culling, 27% from the smallest size class (

The systematics of Notoacmea Iredale, 1915 have been confused because of their highly variable shells. We used DNA sequences from a mitochondrial gene (COI) and a nuclear gene (ITS1) to define the species boundaries among New Zealand Notoacmea species, using the allied genus Patelloida Quoy & Gaimard, 1834 as outgroup. Phylogenetic trees of 195 individuals showed 14 well-supported, reciprocally monophyletic clades, which we treat as species: N. badia Oliver, 1926, N. cellanoides Oliver, 1926, N. daedala (Suter, 1907), N. elongata (Quoy & Gaimard, 1834), N. parviconoidea (Suter, 1907), N. pileopsis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1834), N. scapha (Suter, 1907), N. scopulina Oliver, 1926, N. sturnus (Hombron & Jacquinot, 1841), N. subantarctica Oliver, 1926, Patelloida cortica (Hutton, 1880) and three new Notoacmea species, N. potae, N. rapida, and N. turbatrix, which are described here. Of the above names, N. daedala and N. subantarctica are resurrected from synonymy. Notoacmea helmsi (E.A. Smith, 1894) and N. virescens Oliver, 1926 are interpreted as synonyms of N. elongata.
