More than 100 species of molluscs are listed from Nukumaruan (late Pliocene or early Pleistocene) siltstone on the summit of the first hill south of Oaro, Hundalee Hills, southern Marlborough. Most species are part of the living bathyal molluscan fauna of canyons off eastern South Island, and the siltstone evidently was deposited in 600–800 m of water. Falsilunatia, Penion benthicolus Dell, P. fairfieldae (Powell), Cominella (Eucominia) alertae (Dell), C. mirabilis cantuariensis (Dell), Euthrenopsis otagoensis Powell, and Volutomitra (Latiromitra) are reported as fossils for the first time. The fauna is dominated by the buccinids Cominella nassoides otakauica Powell, an abundant living taxon, and Aeneator (Aeneator) elegans (Suter), a species only recently recognised in the living fauna. The locality is probably the type locality of Aeneator elegans and of Falsilunatia ambigua (Suter), the latter an earlier name for the living F. powelli Dell. New species of Mesoginella (Sinugin ella), Paracomitas (Macrosinus), Splendrillia (two), and Neoguraleus (Fusiguraleus) are named. Splendrillia armata Powell, S. kingmai Marwick, S. majorina n.sp., S. zeobliqua n.sp., and Paracomitas (Macrosinus) haumuria n.sp. are recorded living off eastern South Island.

Thirteen new species of Scissurellidae (Scissurella regalis n. sp., Sinezona mechanica n. sp., Sinezona platyspira n. sp., Sinezona enigmatica n. sp., Sinezona wanganellica n. sp., Satondella azonata n. sp., Satondella bicristata n. sp.), Anatomidae (Anatoma amydra n. sp., Anatoma kopua n. sp., Anatoma megascutula n. sp., Anatoma tangaroa n. sp.), and Larocheidae (Larochea spirata n. sp., Larocheopsis macrostoma n. sp.) are described, all of which occur in New Zealand waters. The greatest geographic source of new taxa is the islands and underwater features off northern New Zealand. The new shell-morphological term "sutsel" is introduced for the area between the SUTure and the SELenizone.

Three new species of Venustatrochus Powell, 1951, V. eclectus n. sp., V. galateae n. sp. and V. youngi n. sp. are described from New Zealand, and Calliostoma (Benthastelena) malaita Vilvens, 2009 from the Solomon Islands and Norfolk Ridge and C. atlantis Clench & Aguayo, 1940 from off Cuba are referred to the genus. The radula of the type species of Otukaia, O. kiheiziebisu (Otuka, 1939), is illustrated, and O. ikukoae Sakurai, 1994 is resurrected from synonymy under O. kiheiziebisu and transferred to Tristichotrochus Ikebe, 1942. Benthastelena Iredale, 1936, Fautor Iredale, 1924 and Maurea Oliver, 1926 are each assigned genus rank in Calliostomatinae, and Alertalex Dell, 1956 is treated as a subgenus of Maurea. The South American species Otukaia chilena (Rehder, 1971) and O. delli (McLean & Andrade, 1982), the western subantarctic species O. eltanini Dell, 1990 and Calliostoma muriellae Vilvens, 2001 from Madagascar are referred to Maurea. Otukaia crustulum Vilvens & Sellanes, 2006 is referred to Calliotropis L. Seguenza, 1903 (Calliotropidae). Six new species of Falsimargarita Powell, 1951 are described—F. callista n. sp., F. challengerica n. sp., F. eximia n. sp. and F. tangaroa n. sp., from New Zealand, F. kapala n. sp. from southeastern Australia, and F. coriolis n. sp. from New Caledonia. Calliostoma atlantoides Quinn, 1992 and C. coronatum Quinn, 1992 from off the Lesser Antilles and Brazil, respectively, are referred to Falsimargarita. Phenacomargarites n. gen. is introduced for P. williamsae n. sp. from the Solomon Islands, and P. incomptus n. sp. and P. titan n. sp. from the New Zealand region. Phenacomargarites, Falsimargarita, Selastele Marshall, 1995 and Fautrix Marshall, 1995 are referred to subfamily Fautricinae Marshall, 1995 (elevated from tribe level). http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:09EAD861-3B62-42F9-BCC1-453EBE1347D4 © 2016 The Malacological Society of Australasia and the Society for the Study of Molluscan Diversity
