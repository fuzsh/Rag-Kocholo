This is the second part of a series on the German zoologist Johannes Thiele (1860-1935) and comprises a critical listing of the genus-group taxa which he described as new to malacology. Each of these names is accompanied by author and bibliographic references, original status, type-species with its original binominal spelling and bibliographic source and some data on subsequent taxonomic placements. Thiele introduced a total of 291 such names in the Phylum Mollusca, distributed as follows: 11 Aplacophora; 39 Polyplacophora; 200 Gastropoda (138 Prosobranchia; 20 Opisthobranchia and 42 Pulmonata); 31 Bivalvia; 10 Cephalopoda; there were no new scaphopod or monoplacophoran names. Of these, later authors recognized as valid 85 at the generic level, 110 at the subgeneric level; 71 are considered to be synonyms, and the remaining 25 are unjustified emendations or errors.

An annotated checklist of the Mollusca from the Australian Indian Ocean Territories (IOT) of Christmas Island (Indian Ocean) and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is presented. The checklist combines data from all previous studies and new material collected during the recent Christmas Island Expeditions organised by the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum (formerly the Raffles Museum of Biodiversty Resarch), Singapore. The checklist provides an overview of the diversity of the malacofauna occurring in the Cocos (Keeling) / Christmas Island ecoregion. A total of 1,178 species representing 165 families are documented, with 760 (in 130 families) and 757 (in 126 families) species recorded from Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, respectively. Forty-five species (or 3.8%) of these species are endemic to the Australian IOT. Fifty-seven molluscan records for this ecoregion are herein published for the first time. We also briefly discuss historical patterns of discovery and endemism in the malacofauna of the Australian IOT.
