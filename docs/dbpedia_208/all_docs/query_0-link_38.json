Verrill 96 Index 99 Plates 108 OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS 3 HISTORICAL SECTION Addison Emery Verrill, first professor of zoology at Yale University, was one of the leading figures in the third era of American conchology, which William H. Dall called the Stimpsonian Period after WilHam Stimpson (1832-1872). \"This period can hardly be said to have been introduced by an epoch-making work, but gradually the old methods were discarded for the new. This meant adopting radical changes in classification and welcoming the theory of evolution with all the light it shed in dark places\" (Dall, 1888: 97). Stimpson was preparing a manual of the marine invertebrates from Maine to Georgia for the Smithsonian Institution based on the most extensive collection of eastern American inverte- brates ever brought together, but it, along with the manu- script, was destroyed in the great Chicago fire of October 1871. Stimpson died the following year, only forty years old. It was Verrill who with the aid of his brother-in-law, Sidney Irving Smith, prepared a more geographically limited, but com- prehensive manual, Report upon the Invertebrate Animals of Vineyard Sound and adjacent waters (1873). Verrill was to write extensively on the marine invertebrates of eastern North America based on subsequent collections made by the United States Fish Commission. Many of these works were exclusively on mollusks. Some, like those of Dall, were based on the spoils of Alexander Agassiz' expeditions on the government ships Blake and Albatross which Agassiz under- took at his own expense. When Dall wrote his paper, Some American Conchologists (1888), Stimpson, who was thirteen years his senior, was long dead \"cut off early in his career showing more promise than accomplishment,\" but Dall could hardly have called the period after himself or Verrill, who were very much alive, and among its most accomplished members. Verrill was born on his father's farm on Furlong Mountain in Greenwood, Maine on February 9, 1839, and was named for a close friend of his parents, Nathan Addison Emery, who died from a fall shortly thereafter. Verrill's parents, George 4 OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS Washington Verrill and Lucy Hillborn, were both descended from Colonial families; the Verrill line from an ancestor who settled in Gloucester, Massachusetts about 1720 and the Hill- borns from a Quaker who settled in Pennsylvania before 1688. As in many other old American families, some became entranced with their ancestors, especially as they correctly perceived that they were being outnumbered by newer arriv- als as the nineteenth century advanced. Writing in this century, Verrill's son, George Elliot Verrill (1958) traced the Verrill name, and its variations, and concluded that the var- ious branches of the family had a common progenitor, a Norman who came to England with William the Conqueror in 1066 and settled in Sussex County. Interestingly, Verrill's sister, Lucy Ellen, married Henry Rust Mighels of Norway, Maine in 1866. He was the son of Dr. Jesse Wedgwood Mighels (1795-1861), the pioneer concholo- gist of Maine, whose collection of shells and books at the Portland Society of Natural History was destroyed in the Portland fire of 1854. During the 1840s he published several illustrated articles in the Boston Journal of Natural History describing new native shells (Johnson, 1949). Mighels re- turned from Cincinnati, Ohio to Norway, Maine in 1857 where he remained until his death. He must have been known to young Verrill. Addison's interest in marine zoology is said to have been awakened by his grandfather Hillborn who took him for a walk along the sea shore at Cape Elizabeth, near Portland, Maine when he was ten years old and told him the vernacu- lar names of the invertebrates which they found. His real passion at this age became minerals and he secured copies of C. T. Jackson's reports on the geology of Maine. Writing many years later he said, \"About a dozen years later [age twenty-two] I was associated with Dr. Jackson as an officer of the Boston Society of Natural History [curator of Radiates, 1864-1870] and I had the pleasure of telling him how much his reports had helped me in my early efforts to study geology by myself. When I was about twelve years old my father obtained for me Dana's small Manual of Mineralogy, but I OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS 5 little thought that I would eventually be the colleague of that eminent scientific man in Yale University. Later I also obtained Professor Asa Gray's Manual of Botany, little thinking that subsequently I would be a student under him at Harvard\" (Verrill, 1958: 92). In 1844 when Verrill was fourteen years old, his father was seriously injured, and the family moved to Norway, Maine where his father ran a successful general store until his death in 1862. Young Verrill prepared for college at the Nor- way Liberal Institute, which later became the public high school, between 1853-1859. In addition to a passion for botany and an interest in photography, Verrill began to collect birds and mammals. Before he entered Harvard, he had already amassed a suite of specimens numbering two hundred birds and mammals. Although not particularly interested in insects, he aided a younger friend, Sidney Irving Smith (1843-1926) who became an authority on marine and freshwater Crustacea as well as the insects of Maine. Smith followed Verrill to Yale where he earned his Ph.D. in 1867 and became a professor of zoology. Early in May 1859, when he was little more than twenty years old, Verrill entered the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University with advanced standing. He must have been present at the ground breaking ceremony on June 14 of Louis Agassiz' Museum of Comparative Zoology, which was ready for occupancy the following May. By this time Agassiz had hired Edward Sylvester Morse (1838-1925), another Maine boy and friend of Verrill, who later was to publish the first work on the terrestrial shells of Maine in the then new Journal of the Portland Society of Natural History. Subse- quently, Morse became director of the Peabody Museum of Salem. Between 1877-1879 he visited Japan to teach zoology and became the father of zoological study there. He studied Japanese culture and made a distinguished collection of Japanese pottery. Among the mollusks he collected there were two new species of cephalopoda from Tokyo Bay which he sent to Verrill for description. Among the other student assistants during the years of 6 OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS 1859-1864, most of whom became distinguished researchers, were Alexander Agassiz, Frederic Ward Putnam, Alpheus S. Packard, Jr., Nathaniel Southgate Shaler, Samuel Scudder, Alpheus Hyatt, Albert Ordway, Caleb Cooke, William H. Dall, and Albert Smith Bickmore. In his first annual report of the Museum of Comparative Zoology for 1859, Louis Agassiz wrote, \"Mr. Verrill has arranged the corals, and has made a special study of the embryology of the class of Birds. To aid in the latter purpose, he passed the summer on the island of Grand Manan.\" When he returned at the end of the summer, Verrill had some 1200 bird embryos as well as numerous bird and fish skeletons. Early in 1861 Agassiz sent Verrill, Ordway, and Putnam to obtain specimens from the Smithsonian Institution to \"get as many corals, birds, birds' eggs, and mammals of all kinds as you can and gain the confidence of Prof. [Joseph] Henry (1797-1878) by talking with him.\" William Stimpson, then established as a marine invertebrate zoologist, who had been an Agassiz student about a decade before, and whom Verrill had previously met in Cambridge, was the first person to call on the young men as soon as they arrived in Washington. While there, Verrill met Spencer Fullerton Baird (1825-1887), who was to become an important contact, as Baird was appointed United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisher- ies, and eventually succeeded Joseph Henry as Secretary of the Smithsonian. He also met Count Louis F. de Pourtales, a former pupil of Agassiz in Switzerland, who had joined the United States Coast Survey in 1848 and was first in this country to attempt deep sea dredging. During the summer of 1861, Alpheus Hyatt (1838-1902) and Nathaniel Southgate Shaler (1841-1906) visited Anticosti Island, in the Gulf of the St. Lawrence, to collect geological, paleontological, and zoological specimens. It was here that Verrill had a serious introduction to those marine inverte- brates to which he was to devote most of his professional career. Verrill's friendship with Hyatt continued through life, and he named his second son after him. Hyatt became curator at OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS 7 the Boston Society of Natural History as well as being in charge of the fossil cephalopod collection at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. He also served as professor of zoology and paleontology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy and professor of biology at Boston University. He pub- lished on the systematics and evolution of ammonoids and on fossil gastropods of the freshwater family Planorbidae, and was working on the Hawaiian tree snails at the time of his death. Hyatt was essentially a philosopher, lost in specu- lation concerning the significance of the adaptations of the animals he discovered. Like most of Agassiz' students he early embraced evolutionary theory, not as a Darwinian, but rather as a neo-Lamarckian and developed a theory of \"racial senescence\" which gained some popularity until the formulation of the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory in the 1930s. Shaler was appointed assistant in paleontology in the Museum of Comparative Zoology in 1864, and the following year began teaching zoology and geology in the Lawrence Scientific School eventually becoming its dean. He was gifted in generalization and in the popularization of science. While Shaler may have considered himself an early Darwin- ian, he became more of a neo-Lamarckian as time went on, a term coined by Alpheus S. Packard, Jr. Verrill in contrast to Hyatt and Shaler was a painstaking, hardworking investigator who devoted himself to discover- ing the most minute morphological characteristics that would distinguish two closely allied species, as well as tack- ling tangles of synonymy that might have discouraged anyone else. While the vogue in zoology changed from tax- onomy to comparative anatomy, then to the study of adapta- tions and the evidences for evolution, and finally to experi- mental genetics at the beginning of the century, Verrill maintained to the end of his life the importance of taxonomy as a necessary preliminary to more specialized biological work. The Anticosti Island trip did not lead to any extensive pub- lications, and nothing appears to have been announced in 8 OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS regard to the original purpose of the trip which was to test the anti-Darwinian teachings of Agassiz. On the contrary, this field experience helped to instill the belief of organic evolu- tion in one form or another in the young men. In later years Hyatt, who commanded his own yacht, said it had been an extremely dangerous trip and that they should not have come back at all. In 1863 Agassiz published in the annual report of the museum, a new set of regulations for museum assistants which caused nearly all of them, with the obvious exception of Alexander Agassiz, to leave the museum. E. S. Morse was the first to depart, followed by F. W. Putnam, A. S. Packard, Jr., A. Hyatt, and A. E. Verrill. A. S. Bickmore wrote the first annual report on Mollusca that year and then was dismissed by Agassiz for soliciting funds for an expedition to Amboina to re-collect the shells described by Rumphius in the sixteenth century. He later became scientific \"father\" of the American Museum of Natural History. When George Peabody endowed the Peabody Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, Putnam became director and invited the others to help reorganize the museum of the East India Marine Society and to incorporate the natural history collec- tions of the Essex Institute. Verrill was looked upon as the spokesman of the \"Salem Secession,\" (Dexter, 1965: 1) but he was in Salem for only a short time before he took an appointment as a full professor in zoology in the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University. He was made a member of the governing board, and became curator of all the zoolog- ical collections at the age of twenty-five. In 1866 George Peabody also gave Yale University the funds to \"found and maintain a museum of natural history, especially in the departments of zoology, geology, and min- eralogy.\" Verrill moved into the original Yale Peabody Museum in 1876, and finally had the opportunity to put on display the collections he had been accumulating since he arrived in New Haven a dozen years before. He had already written extensively on cephalopods, especially giant ones, an interest that would persist at least until 1897 when he OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS 9 wrote on a \"Supposed giant Cephalopod on the Florida coast,\" Octopus giganteus Verrill, which only recently was proven to be an Octopus based on fragments of it that had been sent to the Smithsonian Institution. Therefore, not sur- prisingly among the exhibits were a life size model squid over forty feet long counting the two thirty foot tentacles and a giant octopus. These were designed by Verrill but con- structed by James H. Emerton of Salem, Massachusetts, who became Verrill's assistant and illustrator in 1880. They were made of papier-m^ch6, rubber, and any other materials at hand. Three copies of the squid were made and two of the octopus. Only one model remains on exhibit, that of a huge reddish octopus suspended from the ceiling of the Coral Room at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. The room is a memorial to his lifelong friend from college days, Alexander Agassiz (Hall and Hall, 1985: 46). During his first year at Yale, Verrill roomed with Daniel C. Eaton, Professor of Botany. They formed a friendship which lasted as long as they lived and in which their families participated after they both married. Verrill married Flora Louisa Smith in Norway, Maine on June 15, 1865. She was the sister of Sidney Irving Smith, whom Verrill had be- friended in Maine and who became a distinguished Yale professor himself. The Verrills had six children, including Major George E. Verrill, an engineer who constructed breakwaters, and became his father's biographer and Alpheus Hyatt Verrill, who described a few shells in his latter years. During his early years at Yale, Verrill did much of his marine collecting along the shore by dredging from a small craft in Long Island Sound, mainly in the vicinity of New Haven. In 1870 when the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries was created with Spencer F. Baird as commis- sioner, he appointed Verrill as his assistant in charge of all of the invertebrate collections. The first investigations were made in 1871 with Woods Hole, Massachusetts as the base. In 1872 the dredging was conducted out of Eastport, Maine by the United States Revenue cutter Moss wood under the 10 OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS instructions that operations were to be suspended if a suspi- cious vessel were sighted; however, since smuggling was done at night, the order does not appear to have upset any dredging schedule. From 1873 until 1881 when Woods Hole became the permanent base of operations, work was carried out by the vessels Bache, Speedwell, and Blake from various ports between Salem, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island. It was not until the arrival of the vessel Fish Hawk in 1880 that there was sleeping space on board for the scientific staff, but the Fish Hawk was of light draft and could make offshore cruises of only a few days' duration. Finally in 1883 the Commission received a specially built research steam- ship, the Albatross, of about 1,000 tons, which had good accommodations and facilities for the scientists and was able to dredge in much deeper water than previously possi- ble. When Baird died in 1887 coastal dredging off New Eng- land was discontinued and not resumed until 1954 (Galtsoff, 1962: 48). Verrill's studies provided a basis of knowledge of the ma- rine benthic invertebrates of the Woods Hole region extend- ing at least to the 100 fathom line. Published in 1871 , it is still a major source of information about benthic communities of this area. In \"Notice of a remarkable marine fauna occupy- ing the outer banks off the southern coast of New England, and some additions to the fauna of Vineyard Sound\" (1884), he describes the rich fauna along the 100 fathom line between latitudes 35°40' and 40°22' N and longitudes 69°15' and 71°32' W. He concludes that the number of species and abun- dance of individuals in this area \"is due very largely to the annual uniformity of the temperature enjoyed at all seasons of the year, at all those depths that are below the immediate effects of the atmospheric changes. The region ... is subject to the combined effects of the Gulf Stream on one side and the cold northern current on them, together with the gradual decrease in temperature in proportion to the depth.\" He also describes the effects of the Gulf Stream in bringing \"vast quantities of free-swimming animals which furnish an inex- haustible supply of food for many bottom animals.\" OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS 11 \" Verrill's conclusion about the condition responsible for the abundance of life along the 100 fathom line in an area south of Woods Hole shows a highly developed power of observation and the ability of the author to visualize a general ecological picture from the multitude of detached observations. Verrill never lost sight of the forest because of the trees\" (Galtsoff, 1962: 48). \"For more than thirty years [Verrill] had the faithful assis- tance of Dr. Katharine J. Bush (1855-1937), co-author of sev- eral of his papers on mollusks and annelids, whose accuracy and ability are reflected in nearly all of Professor Verrill's publications during that period,\" wrote her brother-in-law, Wesley R. Coe (1929). Katharine Bush was educated in public and private schools in New Haven, but had not attended college, when in 1879 at the age of twenty-three, she was hired by Verrill. He noted in the 1880 annual report of the Peabody Museum she, \"has been employed in completing the cata- logues and writing labels,\" and in the next year's report, she had been promoted to arranging and cataloguing collections made by the United States Fish Commission at the commis- sion's expense. By 1885 she was taking courses at the Sheffield Scientific School and by 1901 became the first woman to earn a doctor- ate in zoology at Yale. Bush's research was on the taxonomy and systematic classification of marine invertebrates, espe- cially mollusks, annelids, and echinoderms, based primarily on the material collected by Alexander Agassiz and the Unit- ed States Fish Commission. Her papers appeared under her own name or as junior author with Verrill. Among her last works on mollusks was \"Notes on the family Pyramidellidae\" (1909); this was in response to a paper on the same subject written earlier the same year by Paul Bartsch (1871-1960), in which she complained about his purloining of her unpub- lished work. Dr. Bush left the Museum about 1913 or 1914 to become a patient at the Hartford Retreat (now called The Institute for Living) where she died in 1937. Wesley Coe, her brother-in-law and bibliographer of Verrill, sent a short para- graph to Yale Alumni Weekly, which on May 7, 1937 gave the 12 OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS barest facts of her life. She never married and Katharine Bush's admiring biographer, Jeanne E . Remington, adds that \"a series of rented rooms was home to Katharine Bush;\" then hsts the various addresses and even suppHes a photograph of the entrance to one of them (Remington, 1977: 4, 6). In addition to Bush, Verrill was long associated with San- derson Smith (1832-1915) during the investigations of the marine fauna made by the United States Fish Commission from 1875 to 1887. Working without compensation Smith was a careful and enthusiastic collector who rendered valuable services in connection with the dredging during those years. Verrill mentioned that, \"although unfortunate circumstances prevented his participating largely in the final working up of the collections as planned, his name appears jointly with that of the writer, in connection with a large number of new species of deep sea shells discovered by us.\" During the spring of 1898 Verrill visited the Bermuda Islands, accompanied by, among others, C. Montague Cooke, Jr. (1874-1948) who was one of his students both as an under- graduate and as a Ph.D. candidate. In 1901 Verrill again visited the Bermuda Islands, this time accompanied by his wife and one of his sons, Alpheus Hyatt Verrill (1871-1954) who helped collect and make colored drawings, as well as photographs, of many of the specimens. He invented the autochrome photographic process in 1902. Verrill senior wrote extensively on all aspects of Bermuda, his last related paper appearing in 1923. A. H. Verrill became a naturaHst and explorer and spent much of his life in Central and South America. He wrote many popular books on archaeological subjects and two on shells (1936 and 1950). In his seventy- third year he established a shell business in Lake Worth, Florida and began describing shells from the Caribbean that he believed to be new species. The elder Verrill wrote his last paper on mollusks in 1906 and though he retired in 1910, he remained active and con- tinued to publish numerous works on invertebrates. He died in 1926 while visiting his son and biographer, George, in Santa Barbara, California.

VERRILL, WITH THEIR ORIGINAL REFERENCES, TYPE LOCALITIES AND THE LOCATION OF THE TYPE SPECIMENS. REMARKS For convenience of reference the following list of taxa introduced by the above authors is arranged alphabetically by species. In addition to the original reference, subsequent ones are also cited if they include the first figure of a type or other relevant information. References to later collections are usually not included. Since many of the dredging sta- tions are mentioned many times over, their longitude and latitude are listed beginning on page 77. There were very few Bache stations so they are included in the original refer- ences. Complete lists of the dredging stations in North Amer- ican waters between 1867 and 1887 which include other data such as water temperature and types of bottoms were com- piled by Smith (1888). Most of the available types which were previously not illustrated are figured here. The figures on the plates are arranged by genera insofar as possible, though the several species described from Lower California are arranged geo- graphically. The actual measurements are given on the plate captions. All data in brackets have been found on original labels, are additions or corrections from recent maps, or are OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS 15 comments by this author. No attempt has been made to discuss the present status of any of the taxa. This is a task for individual revisers. As a partial compensation for his work, the Fish Commis- sion allowed Verrill to keep the first set of duplicates as his personal property, after sending the types and unique speci- mens to the National Museum of Natural History. Other duplicates were to be sent to other institutions. However, he did not finish working on the material until 1908, and except for his own set of duplicates which he sold to Yale's Peabody Museum, all of the material was returned to Washington, save for six holotypes which appear to have been overlooked. The types in the Division of Mollusks are segregated, and there is a file of the types which made the task of locating and determining holotypes, either figured or unfigured, easier than originally expected. When this could not be done, and when the original description was not based on a single specimen, lectotypes have sometimes been selected from among the syntypes. In all such cases the specimens are figured. Lectotypes have been selected from specimens in the National Museum when possible, otherwise from those in the Peabody Museum, where the types are also separated from the main collection. With the exception of two cephalopods sent to Verrill by E. S. Morse, and one he deposited in Can- ada, all of his extant types in this class are in Washington and were studied by Roper and Sweeney (1978), and no attempt has been made to do more than include their findings. The types of the species described by Bush for Alexander Agassiz are in the general collection of mollusks at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. The collections made in Bermuda should be in the Peabody Museum, but only one lot described in Verrill's 1900 paper on nudibranchia was located and none from the 1901 paper, nor could the several subspecies of Poecilozonites, a fossil land snail from Ber- muda, be found. Many of the species which bear Bush's name do so jointly with Verrill; they are included in papers authored by him and 16 OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS those that were co-authored. In addition are those which were described solely by Bush. Almost all of the species which bear Smith's name do so jointly with Verrill, who with Smith, recognized them as new when they were first sorted, \"for such species, 'Verrill and Smith' are usually given as authorities,\" but Verrill makes it clear that he, alone, is responsible for the descriptions of all the species (Verrill, 1884: 140). Since J. H. Emerton, Verrill's artist, did not publish on mollusks himself, but was included as an authority with Verrill in a few instances, he is mentioned here in this con- nection for the first time. In addition to the species in which Verrill included Sanderson Smith as an authority are listed the few which Smith described by himself or with Temple Prime. Verrill described some 402 species of mollusks among these are 97 with Bush as joint author, 39 with Smith, and 2 with Emerton. No type material was located for 75 of these. Bush described 73 species, and type material was found for all but 4 of them. Together or separately Verrill and Bush introduced over 60 genera or other higher categories. As mentioned previously, the molluscan taxa introduced by Alpheus Hyatt Verrill are included here so as to avoid confusion with those of his father. Most of his taxa were published in mimeographed form, but their validity was con- firmed by Coan (1976). Unfortunately, most of these types were in his private collection, the deposition of which is unknown. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS It gives me pleasure to thank those people whose willing cooperation eased the task of accumulating data. Dr. M. G. Harasewych gave me access to the types in the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution and Mrs. Raye N. Germon prepared the loan of those which were previously unfigured. Dr. Willard D. Hartman allowed me to examine all of the types in the Peabody Museum of Natural History, Yale University, and to borrow those requested. Dr. OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON MOLLUSKS 17 Arthur E. Bogan of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia studied the Turbonilla in that institution des- cribed by K. J. Bush and made available the unfigured types. Drs. Anders War^n, James McLean, Robert G. Moolen- beek, Clyde F. E. Roper, Ruth D. Turner, and others who kindly supplied photographs, drawings, and information are acknowledged in the text. Unless otherwise mentioned, the photographs were taken by Mr. David H. Backus. Dr. Ken- neth J. Boss and Mr. Alan Rabat made many helpful sugges- tions and frank criticisms. The latter also called attention to the recent study confirming Verrill's Octopus giganteus to be a Cephalopod. Mrs. Marion D. Britz patiently aided in pre- paring the work for the press.
