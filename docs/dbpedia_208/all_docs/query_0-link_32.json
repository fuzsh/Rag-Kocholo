        "text": "Two poorly known species of genus Raphitoma Bellardi, 1847 (Gastropoda Conoidea) are revised. Raphitoma pumila (Monterosato, 1890) is redescribed and Cordieria cordieri var. hispida, Monterosato, 1890 is raised to species level and transferred to the genus Raphitoma, hence requiring the creation of a replacement name (R. hispidella nomen novum) due to secondary homonymy with R. hispida Bellardi, 1877.\n\nA new raphitomid toxoglossan, &lt;em&gt;Raphitoma spadiana &lt;/em&gt;n. sp., is described from the Mediterranean Sea. It is the sister species to &lt;em&gt;R. contigua &lt;/em&gt;Monterosato, 1884, from which it differs in the different protoconch (paucispiral vs. multispiral), adding to a long list of pairs of caenogastropod species differing in their larval development.\n\nReceived 16.11.2018; accepted 07.12.2018; printed 30.12.2018; published online 07.01.2019 A new raphitomid toxoglossa, Raphitoma griseomaculata n. sp. (Gastropoda Conoidea), is described from the Ionian Sea. It is the sister species to R. densa (Monterosato, 1884) from which it differs in the different protoconch (paucispiral vs. multispiral), adding to a long list of pairs of the cenogastropod species that differ in their larval development.\n\n\"In this paper, the authors deal with Raphitoma corbis (Potiez et Michaud, 1838) (Gastropoda Conoidea), a poorly-known taxon differently interpreted over time, by fixing a neotype in order to stabilize the nomenclature because the type material has been lost.\"\n\nIn this work, the authors revise 10 pairs of northeastern Atlantic sister cryptic species of the genus Raphitoma Bellardi, 1847 as currently conceived. The species within each pair differ only or mostly in their protoconch morphology, which reflects their larval developmental type (multispiral vs. paucispiral, corresponding to planktrotrophic vs. non-planktotrophic development, respectively). Of the ten studied pairs, one (R. histrix/R. pseudohystrix) includes species with almost allochronic ranges; one pair includes species with allopatric ranges (R. oblonga NE Atlantic, R. alleryana Central editerranean Sea); the remaining 8 studied pairs include exclusively Mediterranean species. Four species are described as new: R. skylla Pusateri & Giannuzzi-Savelli n. sp., R. kharybdis Pusateri & Giannuzzi-Savelli n. sp., R. bartolinorum Pusateri & Giannuzzi-Savelli n. sp., R. ebreorum Pusateri & Giannuzzi-Savelli n. sp. Neotypes are designated for Raphitoma hystrix Bellardi (type species of Raphitoma), Pleurotoma laviae Philippi and Pleurotoma philberti Michaud (type species of Philbertia); lectotypes are designated for Clathurella pseudohystrix Sykes, C. servaini Locard, C. purpurea var. denseclathrata Dautzenberg & Durouchoux, Philbertia alleryana Sulliotti, Ph. papillosa Pallary, Pleurotoma bicolor Risso.\n\nKEY WORDS In the present work we present a complex of species of the family Raphitomidae (Mollusca Gastropoda) comprising three entities: two have multispiral protoconchs, Raphitoma pupoides (Monterosato, 1884), the less known R. radula (Monterosato, 1884) and a new species with paucispiral protoconch.\n\nIn this paper we review the Raphitomidae of the Lower Piacenzian, Upper Pliocene of Estepona, southern Spain. Sixty-two species are recorded representing 21 genera and subgenera, of which 12 species are described as new: Clathromangelia acuticostata nov. sp.,\n\nPublished morphometric data of the maximum diameter of protoconch I of 20 Raphitoma species belonging to 10 pairs of “sibling” species grouped in 12 sets were subjected to Orthogonal Regression Analysis (ORA) for congruence with the poecilogony hypothesis proposed by MANOUSIS et al. (2018). Results exclude the possibility that the obtained data are random but further investigations (e.g. DNA) will support the hypothesis.\n\nThe family of Raphitomidae is currently considered a well supported clade of the Conoidea. The type genus Raphitoma Bellardi, 1847 is well known in the mediterranen Seas with about 40 species, some of which are still undescribed. Morphological analyses carried out on the genus Raphitoma Bellardi, 1847 (Mollusca Neogastropoda Conoidea Raphitomidae) from Mediterranean Sea allowed to identify a new species which is described in the present paper."
