        "meta_description": "Abstract: Bathymetric gradients of biodiversity in the deep‐sea benthos constitute a major class of large‐scale biogeographic phenomena. They are typically portrayed and interpreted as variation in α diversity (the number of species recovered in individual samples) along depth transects. Here, we examine the depth ranges of deep‐sea gastropods and bivalves in the eastern and western North Atlantic. This approach shows that the abyssal molluscan fauna largely represents deeper range extensions for a subset of bathyal species. Most abyssal species have larval dispersal, and adults live at densities that appear to be too low for successful reproduction. These patterns suggest a new explanation for abyssal biodiversity. For many species, bathyal and abyssal populations may form a source‐sink system in which abyssal populations are regulated by a balance between chronic extinction arising from vulnerabilities to Allee effects and immigration from bathyal sources. An increased significance of source‐sink dynamics with depth may be driven by the exponential decrease in organic carbon flux to the benthos with increasing depth and distance from productive coastal systems. The abyss, which is the largest marine benthic environment, may afford more limited ecological and evolutionary opportunity than the bathyal zone.",

        "text": "Bathymetric gradients of species diversity are the most well‐documented biogeographic patterns in the deep‐sea soft‐sediment ecosystem. They have been attributed to a wide range of ecological influences that vary with depth, including environmental stability (Sanders 1968), food availability and biotic interactions (Rex 1981), sediment grain‐size heterogeneity (Etter and Grassle 1992), metapopulation dynamics and dispersal (Etter and Caswell 1994), boundary constraints (Pineda and Caswell 1998), topography (Vetter and Dayton 1998), hydrodynamics (Gage 1997), bottom‐water oxygen concentration (Levin and Gage 1998), and gravity‐driven sediment failure (Levin et al. 1994). While diversity‐depth trends remain incompletely understood, it seems likely that they are shaped by a complex of interacting factors that operate at different scales of time and space (Levin et al. 2001; Stuart et al. 2003).\n\nKnowledge of bathymetric gradients of diversity is largely based on studies of α diversity conducted in the bathyal zone, which descends from the shelf‐slope break (∼200 m) to ∼4,000 m and extends as a narrow ribbon along continental margins. Seaward of the continental margins (>4,000 m) lie the great abyssal plains that form the floor of the world ocean. The abyss, covering 53% of the seabed globally (Menard and Smith 1966), is the largest and most recently explored marine benthic habitat. The transition from the bathyal to the abyssal environment is a very gradual slope with no obvious barriers or abrupt habitat shifts. However, it parallels the strongest biological gradient in the deep sea, the exponential decrease of standing stock as depth and distance from land increase. This decline in standing stock is caused by the decrease in organic carbon flux to the benthos from overhead production, terrestrial runoff, and offshore transport (Rowe and Pariente 1992).\n\nStanding stock of the macrofaunal community decreases two to three orders of magnitude from the upper bathyal region, where density reaches tens of thousands of individuals per square meter and biomass is tens of grams per square meter, to extremely low levels of tens to hundreds of individuals per square meter and <1 g m−2 in the abyss (Rowe 1983). The trend of decreasing standing stock with depth and distance from productive coastal systems appears to be quite general, with predictable regional variation associated with the level of surface production, current patterns, bottom topography, and oxygen minimum zones (Levin et al. 2001). The pronounced gradient of nutrient input and standing stock has vital implications for the development of biodiversity in the deep‐sea benthos, particularly at tremendous depths where populations of individual species are very sparsely distributed (Rex 1981; Etter and Rex 1990; McClain et al. 2004). In the North Atlantic, where depth‐correlated patterns of diversity are especially well documented, α diversity of the macrofauna decreases from the bathyal zone to the abyss (Rex 1981; Cosson‐Sarradin et al. 1998). Abyssal communities also appear to have truncated trophic structures characterized by an increased dominance of deposit feeders and fewer predators compared with bathyal communities (Rex 1976, 1981). The simplest explanation for depressed abyssal diversity is that severe energy constraints at these depths prevent many species from attaining the critical densities required to sustain reproductively viable populations (Rex 1973). In other words, for many species, the abyss may be a marginal environment where they experience chronic extinction arising from vulnerabilities to Allee effects (Courchamp et al. 1999)."
