The first report (Beu 2004) reconsidered the generic positions or specific determinations of some New Zealand late Neogene to Recent molluscs, including migrants from eastern Australia and the tropical Pacific that appeared only briefly in New Zealand during interglacial periods. The second (Beu 2006) reconsidered time ranges and taxonomy of bivalves over this period, including further warm-water migrants. Part 3 (Beu 2010) commenced reconsideration of the time ranges and taxonomy of some gastropods over the same period.The present report is a reconsideration of the time ranges and taxonomy of the remaining gastropods over the same period, with time ranges recorded in oxygen isotope stages (OIS) where possible. Because of space considerations, a number of further gastropods requiring revision have been deleted from this work (partially listed below). A summary paper will follow. Time ranges have been compiled from the detailed faunal lists provided for the formations of Wanganui Basin by Fleming (1953), assigned to individual oxygen isotope stages in the correlation diagram of cycles in Wanganui Basin compiled by Carter & Naish (Citation1999). The faunas included in this overview, their ages and their oxygen isotope stage correlations were summarized in Part 1 of this series of papers (Beu 2004), modified slightly in the introduction to Part 2 (Beu 2006), and are not repeated here. Once again this work is founded on the seminal works on Wanganui Basin by Fleming (Citation1947,1953), and much of what the present ‘Wanganui Basin working group’ has published (particularly Beu 2004, 2006; Abbott et al. Citation2005; Naish et al. Citation2005; Pillans et al. Citation2005) is based on Fleming's brilliant foundation.\n\nThe obvious new, larger taxa and some previous misidentifications have been revised in these four papers, but there is little doubt that this is merely the beginning of recognising the true relationships of the late Neogene molluscan fauna of New Zealand. Further taxonomic revisions and reidentifications undoubtedly will bring to light an increasing list of molluscs that extended their ranges to Wanganui Basin briefly during the many glacial-interglacial oscillations of late Pliocene-Pleistocene time.\n\nAbbreviations and conventions\n\nCollections and institutions housing specimens listed here are abbreviated:\\\n\nDimensions of specimens are cited in millimetres, in the consistent order H (=height), D (=diameter).The standard abbreviations for points of the compass (N = north, S = south, E = east, W = west, NE, SSW, etc.) are used to abbreviate locality details.Unless otherwise stated, I have examined the type material cited below under ‘Type material’.\n\nLocality details\n\nDetailed locality records are listed below for the less common species, for which localities help to establish accurate time range. Full locality data are not listed for common, widespread species.\n\nBiostratigraphy\n\nis a time-scale diagram for the last 2 million years in New Zealand, repeated from Beu (2004, fig. 4; 2006, fig. 1), apart from deleting the now out-dated Plio–Pleistocene boundary. shows the time ranges in oxygen isotope stages of most of the gastropods discussed in the present paper and previous papers (Beu 2010). Some taxa with earlier time ranges or no biostratigraphical utility are discussed in the text but not included in Fig. 2. As in Beu (2006), I adopt the time scale of Cooper (2004) and the definitions of local stages adopted by me (Beu in Cooper Citation2004; Beu 2006:155): Haweran–Castlecliffian boundary at Rangitawa Tephra, 0.34 Ma, in OIS 10 (in Rangitawa Stream, Rangitikei valley); Castlecliffian–Nukumaruan boundary at Ototoka Tephra, 1.63 Ma, in OIS 57 (on the Wanganui coast east of Ototoka Stream mouth); Nukumaruan–Mangapanian boundary at the base of Hautawa Shellbed, 2.4 Ma, in OIS 97 (proposed but not formally defined, on Hautawa Road, between Turakina and Murimoto valleys, north of Hunterville; Beu in Cooper 2004:217); and Mangapanian–Waipipian boundary at the base of Mangapani Shellbed, 3.0 Ma (in Mangapunipuni Stream, Waitotara valley). As I have pointed out before (Beu 2004:155), these New Zealand local stage boundary definitions are critical for allowing the recognition of the stages by the criteria identified in the present paper and in previous papers in this series. The stages would not be identifiable by biostratigraphical proxies if different boundary positions were adopted.\n\nNew Zealand Pleistocene-Holocene time scale (Beu 2006, fig. 1). Correlation of oxygen isotope stages with the geomagnetic polarity time-scale modified slightly from Carter & Naish (1999). Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary now at 2.59 Ma, below base of diagram; Late Pleistocene is applied only to the Last Glaciation, OIS 2.\n\nTime ranges of Pleistocene-Recent gastropods discussed in this paper and in Beu (2010), in oxygen isotope stages (additional to Beu 2004, fig. 5; Beu 2006, fig. 2). Time scale as in Fig. 1. Time ranges derived from correlation of Wanganui formations (Fleming 1953; Abbott & Carter 1999; Abbott et al. 2005) with oxygen isotope stages, slightly modified from Carter & Naish (1999) following Pillans et al. (2005). Approximate duration of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (c. 920–640 ka) from predominantly 41 ka cycles to 100 ka cycles shown by bold bar labelled “MPT”. NUK = Nukumaruan Stage; Castlecliffian/Nukumaruan boundary at 1.63 Ma.\n\nThe Plio–Pleistocene boundary, as defined in 1984 in the Vrica section, southern Italy, falls within OIS 65, at 1.81 Ma, but has been removed from the figure, as the International Union of Geological Sciences has recently (July 2009) ratified a new definition of the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary at the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) of the Gelasian Stage in the Monte San Nicola section in Sicily, within OIS 103, with a date of 2.588 Ma, only 1 m above the Gauss–Matuyama magnetic reversal in the Monte San Nicola section. The Gelasian Stage is now the lowest stage of the Pleistocene, and the former Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary at Vrica is now defined as the GSSP of the Calabrian Stage. The Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary (as judged by the position of the Gauss–Matuyama reversal) now falls between the Parihauhau and Te Rama Shellbeds of Fleming (1953), as shown in the correlation diagram by Carter & Naish (1999), high in the Mangapanian succession in Wanganui Basin. This position is about 200 ka, or four or five glacial–interglacial cycles, earlier than the first obvious cooling in the New Zealand succession, identified by the appearance of the Zygochlamys delicatula (Hutton, 1873) fauna in Wanganui Basin (Fleming Citation1944), defining the base of the Nukumaruan Stage. It should be noted that this new definition equates the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary with the Neogene–Quaternary boundary, but the term Neogene is used throughout this paper in the usual sense of Cenozoic stratigraphers working with marine successions (e.g. McGowran et al. Citation2009), and as usually used in New Zealand, that is, extending from the end of Oligocene time until the present day.\n\nis constructed to demonstrate:\n\nA group of species (Stiracolpus huttoni, Struthiolaria frazeri, Xymene drewi, Paracomitas protransenna, Aoteadrillia finlayi, A. apicarinata) and the genus Taxonia, all of which became extinct at the end of Nukumaruan time, and so provide reliable criteria for identifying the Nukumaruan–Castlecliffian boundary (with the proviso that a form closely resembling Aoteadrillia finlayi still occupies bathyal depths along central eastern New Zealand).\n\nLonger-ranging species that became extinct during Castlecliffian–Haweran time: Calliostoma nukumaruense, in OIS 17; Maoricrypta profunda, in OIS 19 or possibly 17; Trivia (Ellatrivia) zealandica and Taniella planisuturalis, which both retreated from a Nukumaruan–early Castlecliffian last appearance in central New Zealand to be last known in OIS 15(?) at Ohope Beach, Whakatane; Iredalula striata in OIS 11; Zeatrophon bonneti in OIS 9.\n\nThe evolving lineages of Xymene drewi (Mangapanian–Nukumaruan), X. expansus (late Nukumaruan–OIS 19) and X. plebeius (OIS 17–Recent), and of Paracomitas protransenna (Nukumaruan), P. gemmea (Castlecliffian; OIS 23–14?, limited by its restriction to offshore siltstone facies) and P. augusta (Recent).\n\nShort-ranging species of biostratigraphical utility during Castlecliffian–Haweran time: Stephopoma roseum (OIS 13 and 9 at Wanganui; OIS 7 and Recent in NE North Island); Stiracolpus vigilax (OIS 11–9 at Wanganui; OIS 7 at Te Piki, near East Cape), Maoricrypta costata (OIS 29–5a at Wanganui, Recent in NE North Island), M. youngi (OIS 11–Recent), Zelippistes benhami (OIS 13 and 9 at Wanganui; Recent in NE North Island), Semicassis labiata, Argobuccinum pustulosum, Agnewia tritoniformis, Hydatina physis, and Bulla quoyii (all OIS 7–Recent), Acirsa cookiana (OIS 23–Recent), Opalia flemingi (late Nukumaruan–Castlecliffian, OIS 31, 29?), Ponderia zealandica (OIS 13 only; Recent in Cook Strait and near East Cape), Agnewia kempae (OIS 7 only, at Te Piki), Aeneator delicatulus and Buccinulum caudatum (both OIS 25–17), and Philine tepikia (OIS 9 and 7 only).\n\nSpecies previously thought to have short (Haweran–Recent) time ranges, now known to have appeared earlier and to have unreliable, facies-controlled time ranges: Cantharidella tessellata (earliest record late Nukumaruan); Risellopsis varia (earliest record OIS 25?, Teer Formation, Cascade, S Westland).\n\nSpecies previously thought to consist of numerous taxa with short ranges of high biostratigraphical utility during this period, but each interpreted in these papers as consisting of one species that ranged right through the period and provides no biostratigraphical utility: Stiracolpus symmetricus, Pelicaria vermis, and Aoteadrillia wanganuiensis.\n\nThe biostratigraphically useful taxa in Fig. 5 supplement those shown and discussed previously by me (Beu 2004, fig. 5; 2006, fig. 2), together providing the means of distinguishing Nukumaruan from Castlecliffian faunas, and of identifying a number of the oxygen isotope stages during Castlecliffian–Haweran time.\n\nMid-Pleistocene transition\n\nAs noted previously (Beu 2006:156), one of the aims of this series of papers is to recognize evidence for origination and extinction caused by temperature change during the last 2 m yr and, in particular, to what degree origination and extinction coincided with the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) (ca 1.0–0.65 Ma; taken here as occupying OIS 23–17), when glacial-interglacial cycles changed gradually from the 41 ka period of Pliocene–early Pleistocene time to the eccentricity-driven, roughly 100 ka period of the last ∼800 ka. Data from Beu (2004, 2006) indicate that only seven events occurred during the MPT. Most obvious origination and extinction events during the last 2 m yr occurred either at the end of Nukumaruan time or since the MPT (23 events), during the period of high-amplitude glacial-interglacial cycles. The end-Nukumaruan extinction apparently resulted from closure of the Manukau seaway and the consequent decrease in larval transport to Wanganui Basin. Data from gastropods (Fig. 2) demonstrate that seven further events occurred during the MPT, whereas a further 20 occurred since then, making totals of 14 MPT and 43 post-MPT events. These numbers confirm that the biota was more drastically affected by the large-scale glacial-interglacial cycles of the late middle and late Pleistocene than by the more gradually changing temperature regime of the MPT.\n\nOther taxa useful in biostratigraphy\n\nStill further molluscan taxa actually or potentially are useful for biostratigraphy in Nukumaruan–Haweran rocks. They have not been investigated in these papers, because of space and time constraints, or because further taxonomic revision is required before they are useful in biostratigraphy (e.g. Neoguraleus and Splendrillia, Conoidea; Mesopeplum, Pectinidae). Some have well-established biostratigraphical utility (e.g. Aethocola species). They are listed briefly here, as an indication of further work required; no doubt others remain unrecognized. Several of the listed species (identified with an asterisk*) are small molluscs, under ca 6 mm in greatest dimension, constituting the majority of the Mollusca, but ignored in the present works in favour of taxa identifiable in the field.\n\nPolyplacophora\n\nCryptoconchus marwicki Bucknill, 1928 (Beu & Maxwell Citation1990:333, pl. 43j, l), limited to Castlecliffian rocks (records from OIS 15, 13).\n\nGastropoda\n\n*Scissurona fossilis Laws, 1940, Mangapanian and Nukumaruan; recorded from Wilkies Shellbed at Wilkies Bluff and Nukumaru Brown Sand at Nukumaru Beach (Laws 1940); occurs also in Waipuru Shellbed.\n\nHaliotis (Sulculus?) powelli Fleming, 1952 (Beu & Maxwell 1990:347, pl. 47c), occurs in Castlecliffian rocks at Ohope Beach (OIS 15?) and in the Komako area, Pohangina, eastern Wanganui Basin, Nukumaruan (Carter Citation1972).\n\nEmarginula haweraensis Powell, Citation1931, the largest New Zealand Emarginula species; occurs in Waipipian to Nukumaruan rocks (Waipipi shellbeds, type; Okauawa Stream and Kaiwaka S Road, Hawke's Bay, late Nukumaruan).\n\n*Brookula funiculata Finlay, 1924, recorded only from late Nukumaruan to Haweran rocks (Waipuru Shellbed to Landguard Sand, OIS 9). Numerous unnamed Recent species of Brookula are known from the NZEEZ (Spencer et al. Citation2009:201) and it is quite feasible that B. funiculata is still living.\n\nZethalia species (Trochidae, Umboniinae): an excellent example of a long-continued, anagenetic lineage, with arbitrary subdivision into species. Currently accepted species are Z. russelli Marwick, 1965 (Opoitian) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:289, pl. 36e, h), a small species (diameter 6–7 mm) with the tallest spire in the genus, a subsutural row of small beads, another periumbilical row of small beads, and the umbilicus not quite filled by a lobe of the inner lip callus forming a spiral plug; Z. coronata Marwick, 1948 (Waipipian–early Nukumaruan), intermediate in size (diameter 10–17 mm) and with small beads in a subsutural row, but with a completely filled umbilicus and smooth base; and Z. zelandica (Hombron & Jaquinot, 1854) (early Nukumaruan–Recent) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:347, pl. 47l, p), the largest and lowest-spired form (diameter 15–23 mm), almost smooth, with no subsutural row of beads and a smooth base. This genus seems to represent gradual evolution from the strongly sculptured shell of the monileine genus Antisolarium to be able more readily to live infaunally and to occupy the mobile sand habitat occupied, convergently, by Umbonium in the N Pacific. Zethalia was included in tribe Monileini, rather than Umboniini, by Hickman & McLean (1990:126) on anatomical grounds, and although Williams et al. (2010) did not recognize these tribes, they demonstrated that Umbonium and Zethalia are distinct genera on the basis of molecular phylogeny.\n\nPliconacca denticulifera (Marwick, 1924), apparently ranging from early Nukumaruan (Kuripapango, inland Hawke's Bay, GS12687, U20/f10A) to Recent (see Majima [Citation1989:63] for reference to Pliconacca Cossmann & Martin in Martin, 1914; Majima specifically mentioned the Miocene species ‘Uberella’ cicatrix Marwick, 1931, which seems to have been ancestral to P. denticulifera).\n\nGaleodea plauta Beu (Citation2008:313, fig. 17E–G) (Castlecliff, OIS 19, to Recent); living records are from off W Northland only.\n\n*Melanella treadwelli (Hutton, 1885), limited to Castlecliffian rocks at Wanganui; but apparently no specimens have been collected for more than 100 years. However, as with Brookula species, numerous unnamed species of Eulimidae are known from the Recent fauna of the NZEEZ (Spencer et al. 2009:205) and one of these could well be M. treadwelli.\n\nMargineulima christyi (Marwick, 1924) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:328, pl. 41h; Maxwell 1992:120), supposedly a Mangapanian–Nukumaruan restricted species, this large, distinctive species was recorded from Castlecliffian rocks at Wanganui by Fleming (1953:188, 199): Kaimatira Pumice Sand (OIS 25; in GS 4148, R22/f7414) and Kaikokopu Shellbed (OIS 19; in GS4156, R22/f7417).\n\nMurexsul species: Marshall & Burch (Citation2000) revised Murexsul species (as Muricopsis) in the modern fauna and some late Pliocene–Pleistocene fossil records. The relatively small species M. espinosus (Hutton, 1885) is apparently limited to Mangapanian and Nukumaruan rocks, and the earliest definite record of the larger species M. octogonus (Quoy & Gaimard, 1833) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:359, pl. 48 l) is from Castlecliff (Kaikokopu Shellbed, OIS 19; Fleming 1953:199), but Marshall & Burch (2000) recorded specimens similar to both M. octogonus and M. espinosus, along with a possible third species, from Ashcott Road, W of Waipukurau, Hawke's Bay (GS10858, U22/f 9588, late Nukumaruan). Late Neogene species require further study.\n\nCominella (Eucominia?) hamiltoni (Hutton, 1885) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:324, pl. 42g), a distinctive small species limited to Nukumaruan rocks.\n\nAethocola species: many species of this genus have highly useful, restricted ranges, most notably the Kapitean index species A. coerulescens (Finlay, 1930) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:266, pl. 30e). Several Pliocene species have rather short ranges also: A. pagoda Finlay, 1924 (Beu & Maxwell 1990:298, pl. 37g) and A. (Zelandiella) pliocenica (Powell, 1931) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:299, pl. 37d), both limited to Opoitian–early Mangapanian rocks; A. (Zelandiella) propenodosa (Bartrum, 1919), recorded only from Opoitian rocks at Kaawa Creek, SW Auckland; and A. (Zelandiella) allani (King, 1934) (=conoidea Zittel, 1864), limited to Opoitian–Waipipian Starborough Formation in the Awatere valley. The superabundant living species A. glans (Röding, Citation1798) (Beu & Maxwell 1990, 364, pl. 49c) is not known fossil earlier than Castlecliffian, but the significance of this is uncertain, as specimens very similar to its supposed ‘form’ A. chathamensis (Finlay, 1928) occur uncommonly in Nukumaruan rocks of Wanganui and Hawke's Bay, in near-shore facies. A. taitae Marwick, 1924 (Beu & Maxwell 1990:324, pl. 42k) is limited to late Nukumaruan rocks of Hawke's Bay, A. cottoni (King, 1933) is limited to Nukumaruan rocks in S Wairarapa, and A. clavicula (King, 1933), an unusual species with a narrowly rounded rather than angulate margin to the sutural ramp, is limited to early Nukumaruan bathyal rocks at Palliser Bay.\n\nTaron dubius (Hutton, 1878), now limited to the NE North Island warm province; Fleming (1953:188, 199) recorded ‘Taron n. sp.’ from Kaimatira Pumice Sand (OIS 25; in GS4163, R22/f6459) and T. dubius from Kaikokopu Shellbed (OIS 19; in GS4156, R22/f7417). Taron possibly represents another rare warm-water migrant from the N North Island in Wanganui Basin, but T. dubius has direct development, so any transport presumably would have been by rafting.\n\nAustromitra planata (Hutton, 1885), apparently limited to Mangapanian–Castlecliffian rocks. However, the Recent species A. lawsi Finlay, 1930 seems to be conspecific (Oaro, Marlborough, Nukumaruan [Beu 1979]; Waipuru Shellbed to Upper Castlecliff Shellbed [OIS 11], as Proximitra n. sp., etc., of Fleming's [1953] lists). Taxonomic revision required; again, many unnamed species are recorded from the NZEEZ by Spencer et al. (2009:209) and probably include A. planata.\n\nAlcithoe species: the restricted ranges recorded by Beu & Maxwell (1990) and Maxwell (2009) for some late Neogene Alcithoe species suggest they are useful for biostratigraphy, but in practice they are uncommon and variable, and difficult to use: A. arabica (Gmelin, 1791) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:366, pl. 49d), first record Nukumauan; A. exigua Marwick, 1926 and A. nukumaruesis (Marshall & Murdoch, Citation1920) (an ecophenotype of A. arabica?), both limited to Nukumaruan; A. fusus (Quoy & Gaimard, 1833) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:367, pl. 49i), Castlecliffian–Recent.\n\nThree large, long, narrow, short-spired, distinctive species of Marginellidae seem to be limited to Nukumaruan rocks of Hawke's Bay: Serrata hectori (Kirk, Citation1882), S. kirki (Marwick, 1924), and S. marwicki (Finlay, 1927) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:326, pl. 42j; Maxwell 2009:245), but these require revision and comparison with the Recent species renamed by Marshall (2004).\n\nZeadmete kumeroa Fleming, 1943, apparently limited to Nukumaruan rocks of S Hawke's Bay, and Z. pliocenica (Finlay, 1930), apparently limited to Castlecliffian rocks at Wanganui (recorded by Fleming (1953:226, 230) only from Pinnacle Sand (OIS 14; GS4098, R22/f6425) and Tainui Shellbed (OIS 13; GS4013, R22/f6353, & GS4097, R22/f6516) at Wanganui, but recently collected from Upper Castlecliff Shellbed (OIS 11; GS13590, R22/f0100). Neogene–Recent species require revision.\n\nBonellitia lacunosa (Hutton, 1885) (Beu & Maxwell 1990:326, pl. 42 l) is another species apparently limited to late Nukumaruan rocks of Hawke's Bay; collected recently at localities in Petane Group near Napier and at Maharakeke Road SW of Waipukurau. B. lacunosa seems to reach a larger size and have coarser sculpture than the Recent species B. superstes Finlay, 1930.\n\nComitas allani Powell, 1942 (Beu & Maxwell 1990:327, pl. 42p), Opoitian to Nukumaruan; last recorded uncommonly in late Nukumaruan Petane Group in central Hawke's Bay.\n\nTomopleura subalbula (Murdoch, 1900), Nukumaruan–Haweran; recorded from Waipuru Shellbed (late Nukumaruan) to Landguard Sand (OIS 9) and at Te Piki, near East Cape (OIS 7); apparently ancestral to the Recent species T. albula (Hutton, 1873) but the distinction needs to be verified from more material.\n\n*Zenepos lacunosa (Hutton, 1885); Powell (1942) recorded this from Castlecliff (holotype) only; I am not aware of any other records.\n\n*Ringicula uniplicata Hutton, 1885, recorded only from the late Nukumaruan Petane Group of Hawke's Bay, but again apparently not collected for more than 100 years, and the type material is lost.\n\nBivalvia\n\n*Cosa wanganuica Finlay, 1930, apparently limited to Castlecliffian rocks of Wanganui (Kaimatira Pumice Sand, OIS 25, to Tainui Shellbed, OIS 13; Fleming 1953).\n\n*Hamacuna nukumaruensis (Laws, 1940), limited to Mangapanian–Nukumaruan rocks (Wilkies Shellbed at Wilkies Bluff and Nukumaru Brown Sand at Nukumaru Beach; Laws 1940).\n\nTalabrica bellula (A. Adams, 1854) and related species all require investigation. The earliest New Zealand record of the genus seems to be Mangapanian. Fleming (1953:178) recorded T. bellula only from Lower Okehu Siltstone (Castlecliffian, OIS 29; Mowhanau Formation of Abbott & Carter Citation1999). T. nummaria Powell, 1931 is recorded only from Nukumaruan and, possibly, Castlecliffian rocks (recorded by Fleming (1953:180) from Okehu Shell Grit (OIS 27), but in brackets, indicating thought reworked from older rocks). T. inornata Wild & King, 1932 apparently is a rare species recorded only from Nukumaruan rocks. T. senecta Powell, 1931 (Beu & Maxwell 1990:310, pl. 40b, f) apparently is limited to Nukumaruan rocks at Castlepoint (although both T. nummaria and T. inornata possibly are synonyms of T. senecta). An unnamed species occurs in Castlecliffian (OIS 15) rocks at Matata, Bay of Plenty (NMNZ M.137685), and another is present in the Recent fauna of the Three Kings Islands (NMNZ M.137651; BA Marshall NMNZ pers. comm. October 2009; Spencer et al. 2009:198). Lamprell (Citation2003) treated Talabrica Iredale, 1924 as a synonym of Crassatina Kobelt, 1881 (West Africa), but judged from illustrations of African species (e.g. Ardovini & Cossignani 2004, figs. pp. 277–278) this synonymy is most unlikely to be correct. The shape and sculpture of Crassatina species are both strongly distinct from those of Talabrica species.\n\nMarama murdochi Marwick, 1927 (Beu & Maxwell 1990:316, pl. 41c, d), species and genus last recorded in late Nukumaruan rocks; a distinctive, inflated relative of Dosina with a large, pouting lunule and fine commarginal sculpture, limited to offshore, shelf, mudstone facies.\n\n‘Parilimya’ neozelanica (Suter, 1914) (Boreham 1965:73, pl. 20, figs. 2, 3, as ‘Thracia’ neozelanica; Beu & Maxwell 1990:346, pl. 46g, i); recorded rarely from Wanganui Castlecliffian rocks and the Recent fauna; collected recently from Upper Castlecliff Shellbed (OIS 11).\n\nThracia magna Marshall & Murdoch, 1921 (Beu & Maxwell 1990:288, pl. 34h), limited to Waipipian–Nukumaruan rocks. This distinctive, large species is last recorded from late Nukumaruan rocks (Nukumaru Brown Sand) at Wanganui.\n\nWarm-water taxa recorded by Fleming (1953:272–274) from Oturi shellbed, Waipipi (OIS 5a): a final subject that deserves fuller treatment than the cursory glance given it here is the taxa recorded by Fleming from the basal Oturi shellbed of the Hauriri Terrace cover beds (OIS 5a, ca 80 ka) at Waipipi, mouth of Wairoa Stream, W end of Waverley beach, W of Wanganui. Re-collections have shown that this is a ‘fossil’ boulder beach, with Barbatia novaezelandiae (Smith, Citation1915) abundant among the in situ boulders, infaunal boring bivalves such as Pholadidea present in their bore-holes in the boulders, and a few specimens of Cleidothaerus albidus (Lamarck, Citation1819) attached to the boulders. The small amount of shelly sand surrounding the boulders contains the following warm-water species, according to Fleming's (1953) list: Monodilepas monilifera (Hutton, 1873), Maoricrypta costata (G. B. Sowerby I, 1824), M. cf. youngi Powell, 1940, Murexsul mariae Finlay, 1930, and Marginella cf. mustelina Angas, 1871 (that is, Serrata fasciata (G. B. Sowerby II, 1846); Marshall [2004:8]). These almost all have taxonomic problems or could refer to other, similar species, e.g. Fleming's material identified as Murexsul mariae appears to me to be M. octogonus (Quoy & Gaimard, 1833), which still lives in W Cook Strait; Monodilepas contains a number of similar species with distinct ranges around New Zealand at present; and Maoricrypta youngi still lives in W Cook Strait (see below). The only certain warm-water, NE North Island species present is Maoricrypta costata, although if Fleming's identification is correct, Serrata fasciata is possibly another, as it is not recorded south of Mahia Peninsula (Marshall Citation2004:9). This fauna deserves further attention, although recent re-collections have not brought any apparently significant species to light.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nPhylum Mollusca\n\nClass Gastropoda\n\nInformal group Ptenoglossa\n\nFamily Epitoniidae\n\nGenus Acirsa Mörch, 1857\n\nAcirsa Mörch Citation1857:77.

Type species (by original designation, Iredale 1936:336): Scala morchi Angas, 1871, Recent, SE Australia (new synonym).\n\nRemarks\n\nBouchet & Warén (1986:526) regarded all the subgenera of Acirsa recognized by Cossmann (1912) based on Recent type species as synonyms of Acirsa, and commented that ‘Other genera based on fossil type species may be synonyms’, implying that they thought the other very similar subgenera listed in the synonymy above are also synonyms. Another synonym may well be Proacirsa Cossmann (1912:96; type species Turritella inornata Terquiem & Jourdy, 1869, Bathonian, France) but as this almost identical shell is Jurassic in age, whereas all other members of the genus are Cenozoic to Recent, the synonymy deserves more careful evaluation than is possible here. It was discussed in some detail by de Boury (1917:58), who thought the age difference unimportant. In his critique of Cossmann's (1912) classification, de Boury (1917:57) objected to Cossmann's (1912:96) comments on the similarity of these subgenera, pointing out that the protoconch of some of these groups (particularly Acirsa sensu stricto) is obtuse and submammillate, whereas that of others (notably Plesioacirsa) is pointed and elongate. However, this distinction between tall, narrow, planktotrophic protoconchs and shorter, wider, lecithotrophic ones is no longer regarded as a generic character. De Boury (1917:59) also admitted that distinguishing Acirsella from Plesioacirsa was extremely difficult. Bouchet & Warén's (1986) synonymy is well justified, particularly as the three similar shells they illustrated (Bouchet & Warén 1986, figs. 1224–1226) are the type species of the subgenera Acirsa (fig. 1225), Pseudacirsa (fig. 1224) and Plesioacirsa (fig. 1226). In view of the range of taxa included by Bouchet & Warén (1986) it is accepted here that the New Zealand fossil species assigned to Notacirsa by Finlay (1926a) belong in Acirsa. One of the few apparently distinctive characters of Notacirsa, compared with typical N Atlantic species of Acirsa, is the relatively prominent, wide, widely spaced axial ridges (e.g. in N. oamarutica (Suter, 1917); Finlay 1926a, pl. 56, fig. 16; N. vetusta Maxwell 1992, pl. 14 l), but some other species illustrated by Cossmann have much coarser ridges (e.g. A. drevermanni de Boury in Cossmann 1912:196, pl. 6, figs. 4–6; A. duvergieri de Boury in Cossmann 1912:197, pl. 6, fig. 21). Other genera proposed for Australian Recent taxa, in particular Plastiscala Iredale (1936:302) (type species Scala morchi Angas, 1871, Recent, S Australia; Weil et al. Citation1999:140, fig. 433, holotype illustrated, BMNH 1871.7.5.10) seem highly likely to be further synonyms of this almost cosmopolitan, speciose genus. The holotype of Scala morchi (examined, AGB) is very similar to Acirsa cookiana (Dell, 1956) in most characters other than its smaller size, its markedly weaker spiral sculpture and its few low varices at irregular, sparse intervals, and generic separation does not seem warranted.\n\nFinlay (1926a:231) gave a very vague type species designation for Notacirsa, stating only ‘Notacirsa n. gen./I provide this for Turbonilla oamarutica Suter [reference]’. He also included two other named New Zealand species and an Australian fossil, Scalaria (Hemiacirsa) lampra Tate, Citation1888. However, Finlay obviously intended his ‘I provide this for’ statement to be a type species designation, and this is accepted here.\n\nAcirsa cookiana (Dell, 1956) (F,G)\n\nMathildona cookiana Dell 1956b:39, fig. 30; Maxwell Citation1966:447 (position queried); Bieler Citation1995:632, fig. 92 (holotype; removed from Mathildidae).\n\nMathildona? cookiana.

This specimen was identified as ‘Aclis cf. planostoma (Hutton, 1885)’ by J Marwick in the GNS collection, but is considerably wider and more strongly sculptured than other specimens referred to A. planostoma, and appears to be an incomplete spire from a much larger shell similar to Acirsa cookiana. Castlecliffian: Omapu Shellbed (OIS 23), Castlecliff coastal section E of Mowhanau Beach, coll. C. A. Fleming (TM8601, GS4060, R22/f6391, 1, Fig. 3F, G); Pinnacle Sand (OIS 15/14) at ‘the pinnacles’ gully, Castlecliff coastal section (one, TM8602), collected and presented by the late Mrs Jean Boswell, a keen collector of fossils from the Castlecliff section, near her home in Wanganui. Jean donated several valuable specimens to GNS's collection over many years. Another specimen of A. cookiana from the same locality was present in her collection, but I do not know its present location. Recent: A specimen in Suter's collection from the famous ‘110 fathoms [200 m] off Great Barrier Island’ sample (Murdoch & Suter Citation1906) seems likely to be conspecific, and is quite similar to the Omapu Shellbed specimen. It was not mentioned by Murdoch & Suter (1906), but a number of other unrecorded and unidentified taxa from this station are present in Suter's collection. Others: NMNZ M.8839, Cook Strait, 148 m, 40°49.6′S, 174°36.8′E (five, paratypes of M. cookiana); NMNZ M.287949, SE slope of Ranfurly Bank, 153–143 m, 37°38.5′S, 178°56.4′E (two); NMNZ M.287948, N of Alderman Islands, 108–113 m, 36°47.5′S, 176°00.0′E (one); NMNZ M.287950, NZOI Stn P515, 37 km NE of Great Island, Three Kings Islands, 550 m, 33°58.0′S, 172°30.6′E (one).\n\nDistribution\n\nAcirsa cookiana is uncommon around northern and central New Zealand at present and a few fossil specimens have now been recognized at Castlecliff, Wanganui. Possibly its uncommonness at Castlecliff results from the deposition of most Nukumaruan–Castlecliffian formations in Wanganui Basin in no more than about 50–70 m of water, that is, significantly shallower than Recent records of A. cookiana, which are from ca 100–550 m. The very similar Opoitian specimen from N Hawke's Bay suggests that this is a widespread, if uncommon, species group in New Zealand late Neogene rocks, but its range is poorly known at present.\n\nDimensions\n\nHolotype: H 9.8, D 3.7 mm (Dell 1956b:39); GS4060, TM8601, Omapu Shellbed: H 14.2, D 4.8 mm; TM8602, ‘the pinnacles’: H 16.1 (slightly incomplete), D 5.4 mm.\n\nRemarks\n\nAcirsa cookiana has more prominent spiral cords than most species assigned to Acirsa previously, but relatively weak, uniform spiral sculpture is present over the entire exterior on most Acirsa species (Bouchet & Warén 1986, figs. 1224–1226), and some species previously assigned to the synonym Acirsella de Boury, 1886 have prominent spiral cords (e.g. Cossmann 1912, pl. 4, figs. 31, 32). The protoconch is present on one of the Castlecliff specimens (Fig. 23I) and is a normal epitoniine lecithotrophic protoconch, closely similar to those illustrated by SEM by Bouchet & Warén (1986, figs. 1165–1181, 1227–1235), lacking the prominent axial costae of planktotrophic protoconchs of Epitoniidae Nystiellinae (Bouchet & Warén 1986, figs. 1131–1138) (Nystiellidae; Nützel Citation1998). Okutani's (Citation2000, pl. 160, fig. 16) illustration under the name Plastiscala morchi (Angas, 1871) shows a specimen closely resembling Acirsa cookiana, and much larger than P. morchi. However, it has still more prominent, strongly convex, polished spiral cords and weaker axial ridges than New Zealand specimens. Hasegawa & Nakayama (Citation2009) recently confirmed this by recording what is apparently the same species under the name Acirsa morsei (Yokoyama, 1926) from off Noto Peninsula, Sea of Japan. Iredale's (1936, pl. 22, figs. 21–23) illustrations of Plastiscala morchi show a shell with aligned ventral varices that are absent from New Zealand specimens, and with much weaker spiral cords (Scala morchi Angas Citation1871:15, pl. 1, fig. 7; May Citation1923:63, pl. 29, fig. 13; Cotton 1956:4, fig. 13; Macpherson Citation1958:33, pl. 29, fig. 13; Weil et al. 1999:140, fig. 433). Australian specimens are also much smaller (H 7–8 mm for the apparent synonym Plastiscala verconis Cotton [Citation1939:172]; H 9.7, D 2.8 mm for the holotype of P. morchi, BMNH 1871.7.5.10). New Zealand specimens are also significantly larger and have more numerous, narrower, more closely spaced spiral cords than Australian ones: 12 very closely spaced ones on spire whorls and about 15–16 on the last whorl on TM8601, nine more widely spaced ones on spire whorls and about 12–14 on the last whorl on TM8602 (low, narrow, closely spaced cords on the ramp and base are difficult to count). However, it appears that the relative prominence of secondary cords (all prominent on TM8601, some suppressed over much of the height but strengthening on the last whorl on TM8602) affects the overall shell appearance greatly. New Zealand specimens also lack the true, raised, strongly aligned varices that are present on Australian material of P. morchi, although low ridges marking growth pauses are present at irregular intervals on both Castlecliff specimens. Despite the deservedly critical reviews of Weil et al. (1999) by Beechey (Citation2009) and Petit (Citation2009a), I agree with Weil et al. (1999:128) that A. cookiana is a prominently sculptured species of Acirsa.\n\nGenus Opalia H. Adams & A. Adams, Citation1853\n\nOpalia H. Adams & A. Adams 1853:222.

Beu & Maxwell 1990:348, pl. 47k.\n\nType material\n\nHolotype (Fig. 3A, B) TM8590, GS4107, R22/f6430, Ototoka Siltstone (OIS 31), coast E of mouth of Ototoka Stream, W of Wanganui, collected by CA Fleming; with two paratypes, TM8591–2.\n\nOther material examined, all paratypes\n\nGS4107 re-collection, R22/f6430 (one incomplete); GS1198, R22/f6305, ‘sandstone immediately above coal [that is, a lignite bed in Maxwell Formation], coast between Ototoka Stream and Okehu Stream’ (=upper Tewkesbury Formation; one incomplete); GS1164, R22/f6348, Tewkesbury Formation, Nukumaru Beach, W of Ototoka Stream mouth (one incomplete);?Ototoka Siltstone, poorly localized (TM8593, Fig. 23D, specimen illustrated by Beu & Maxwell (1990:348, pl. 47k); collected by OJ Marston from a locality well to the W of Kai-Iwi). The last paratype was incorrectly stated by Beu & Maxwell (1990:348, pl. 47k) to be from ‘the pinnacles’ gully, but actually came from well to the west. The collector is unfamiliar with Wanganui stratigraphy, but the specimen is clearly from much lower in the section than Pinnacle Sand. However, its preservation is better than that of the rest of the type material, it bears more prominent axial ridges than the other paratypes, and it is also possible that it is from significantly higher in the section than Ototoka Siltstone. The full stratigraphic range of O. flemingi n. sp. is, therefore, unclear at present.\n\nDistribution\n\nNukumaru–Castlecliff coastal section, only, in Wanganui Basin; early Castlecliffian (OIS 31; possibly later) and latest Nukumaruan; only seven specimens seen. The record of ‘Acrillospira’ (sic,=Acrilloscala) from Tewkesbury Formation at Nukumaru Beach (Abbott et al. 2005, appendix table, p. 149) was based on Fleming's (1953:158) record of this species (RM Carter, James Cook University pers. comm. 6 October 2005), which in turn was based on Marwick's collections from Nukumaru Beach (Fleming's [1953:158] list for GS1164-1202, R22/f6348, R22/f6309). The only other record by Fleming (1953:174) is from GS4107, R22/f6430, ‘Ototoka Siltstone Tongue’ of Fleming, in the coastal section E of Ototoka Stream mouth (Ototoka Siltstone; Abbott & Carter 1999:96). Unfortunately, this part of the Wanganui coastal section is heavily overgrown, deeply weathered, and inaccessible at present.\n\nDimensions\n\nHolotype: H 36.2, D 11.1 mm; paratype TM8591: H (incomplete) 39.9, D 11.2 mm; paratype TM8592: H 32.3, D 9.9 mm.\n\nDescription\n\nShell tall and narrow, large for genus (height 32–40 mm), weakly sculptured with narrow, closely spaced axial and spiral ridges; rather thin and fragile; apparently mostly composed of aragonite (white in most specimens), but with a thin, pinkish to pale brown (presumably calcite) outer layer that detaches rather easily (an intritacalx?). Protoconch not seen. Teleoconch evenly tapered, of 12–13 lightly convex whorls with moderately impressed suture, spire angle 17–18°. Peribasal cord prominent, smooth on most specimens, faintly nodulose on a few, narrowly rounded, issuing from suture on last whorl, continuous with suprasutural cord when that is present, delineating basal disc; termination faintly angling lower right profile of outer lip. Axial sculpture of low, narrow, rather closely spaced, slightly irregular ridges with indistinctly defined edges, weakly curved, inclined slightly forwards towards upper suture; prominent on early spire whorls, weakening down teleoconch; narrower and more closely spaced over upper part of whorl (a weakly defined sutural ramp) than lower down; each axial interspace slightly wider than one ridge; 32 on last whorl and 33 on penultimate whorl of holotype, 26 on last whorl and 28 on penultimate whorl of paratype TM8593. Spiral sculpture of one low suprasutural and one low subsutural fold (subsutural fold formed by closely spaced, weakly nodulose tops of axial ridges) slightly more prominent than remainder of spiral sculpture, rest of whorl (between suture and peribasal cord on last whorl) entirely covered with 12–18 low, weak, closely spaced cords per whorl, crossing axial ridges without forming nodules; relatively few, prominent, uniform and wide on some specimens (e.g. paratype TM8593) but lower, more closely spaced, more varied and more numerous on others, including holotype; with numerous very fine interstitial spiral threads on some specimens, including holotype. Basal disc sculptured much as on whorl sides, but all sculpture much more subdued. Exterior surface bearing microscopic rectangular pits in regular spiral rows; pit rows mostly few and in spiral interspaces on spire whorls, but numerous, closely spaced and covering entire surface including basal disc (but not apertural lips) on last few whorls of well-preserved specimens. Aperture elliptical, with weak posterior sinus, weakly angled at anterior end; lips smooth, thickened, forming continuous peristome and a terminal varix; small, narrow, sharp-edged, weakly ridged fasciole bordering lower half of inner lip on holotype, weakly developed on other specimens. Low, indistinct varices present at irregular intervals of about 2/3 to one whorl on lowest 5–7 whorls.\n\nRemarks\n\nThe taxonomic position of this species is a little uncertain. The regular pitting of the whorl surface (Fig. 3D, H) was interpreted by Beu & Maxwell (1990:348) as evidence for a position in Opalia, following Kilburn (1985:241,266). The presence of only low, irregular varices also supports a position in Opalia. I have searched long and hard for a Recent analogue of this species, with little success; nothing similar was described by Weil et al. (1999), Nakayama (Citation2003) or Garcia (Citation2003, Citation2004). It is most nearly similar to the South African Recent species O. (Pliciscala) aglaia (Bartsch, 1915) (Kilburn Citation1985:271, figs. 51, 52) but the few known specimens of O. aglaia are much smaller (reaching 20×6.4 mm, but most specimens are half this size) and a little more finely sculptured than O. flemingi, with narrower, more numerous (30–40 per whorl), more closely spaced, and slightly more strongly curved axial ridges. Kilburn (1985:272) described O. aglaia as having ‘micropunctate interstices’. This is the only really similar species I am aware of, and a close phylogenetic relationship with O. aglaia appears feasible, implying that this is a further example of transport as planktotrophic larvae in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\n\nTwo Recent lots in NMNZ (M.171153, off Lord Howe Island, 565–960 m, 31°45.73′S, 159°20.93′E, RV ‘Tangaroa’, one large; M.172283, W Norfolk Ridge, W of Cape Reinga, 785–800 m, 34°17.09′S, 168°25.82′E, RV ‘Tangaroa’, one large and seven small) are superficially similar to Opalia flemingi n. sp., but have more regular, even spiral cords and axial ridges, lack obvious punctae, and belong in the group of epitoniids usually assigned to Acrilla. The large specimen in M.171153 is particularly similar in size and shape, but has lightly angled early spire whorls not seen in O. flemingi n. sp. A Grebneff (Dunedin pers. comm.) pointed out similarities to O. leeana (Verrill, 1883) and O. (Cylindriscala) andrewsii (Verrill, 1882) (Abbott Citation1974, figs. 1211, 1214) from the NE United States. None of the Recent Australian species of Opalia is similar; all have much fewer, lower, more widely spaced, less sharply defined axial costae, weaker spiral sculpture, and a more prominent peribasal ridge. The regularly pitted surface of Opalia flemingi n. sp. cannot be a preservational artefact, so the new species is not related to such taxa as Acrilla acuminata (G. B. Sowerby II, 1844) (Wilson Citation1993, fig. p. 274; Indo-West Pacific to Keppell Bay, Queensland). Another Australian Recent species that resembles O. flemingi n. sp. quite closely is Propescala valida (Verco, 1906) (Verco Citation1906a:147, pl. 4, fig. 7; Cotton Citation1956:1, fig. 19), which, however, is much smaller (H 7 mm). A final Australian(?) species resembling the new species is ‘Scalaria’ distincta E. A. Smith (Citation1891:441, pl. 35, fig. 15; Iredale 1936:305, pl. 22, fig. 29), which Iredale included in the ‘not rediscovered’ list of possible Atlantic species from the muddled HMS ‘Challenger’ Station 164B, supposedly dredged off Sydney, New South Wales, in 750 m. ‘Scalaria’ distincta is particularly similar to O. flemingi, but has regular varices in the centre of the venter of each whorl that are not present on O. flemingi n. sp., and appears to be related to Acrilla acuminata. Whatever its relationships, Opalia flemingi n. sp. is a very distinctive addition to the New Zealand epitoniid fauna.\n\nEtymology\n\nIt is a pleasure to name this finest of the new Wanganui Plio–Pleistocene molluscs in honour of Charles Fleming KBE FRS, the leading New Zealand paleontologist of the late twentieth century. Fleming's seminal work on the stratigraphy and paleontology of Wanganui Basin underpins all later research on this magnificent succession.\n\nSubgenus Nodiscala de Boury, 1890\n\nNodiscala de Boury 1890:12. Type species (by original designation): Scalaria bicarinata G. B. Sowerby II, 1844, Recent, tropical Indo-West Pacific (Hawaii and the Red Sea to South Africa; Weil et al. 1999:106, fig. 339, as Opalia (Nodiscala) bicarinata).\n\nRemarks\n\nThe taxonomy of this group of Epitoniidae is complex and undecided even at the generic level, and I use Nodiscala here as a subgenus of Opalia (1) to underscore the need for a reassessment of these epitoniid genera, (2) because the genera and subgenera in this group, discussed below, all have punctate teleoconchs resembling that of Opalia, and (3) because the Nodiscala species illustrated by Cossmann (1912, pl. 4, figs. 5, 6; pl. 5, figs. 23, 25–27; pl. 6, figs. 9, 15, 20, 24) most closely resemble the New Zealand species under consideration here, O. (Nodiscala) nympha (Hutton, 1885), O. (Nodiscala) ahiparana (Powell, 1930), O. (Nodiscala) zelandica (Finlay, 1930) and O. (Nodiscala) maxwelli (Finlay, 1930).\n\nThese species (at least Opalia nympha and O. maxwelli, in most previous classifications) have been placed by most previous authors in Funiscala de Boury (Citation1891:205; type species [as reidentified by de Boury 1911:219]: Scalaria speyeriana Sacco, 1891, Oligocene, Italy). The type species originally designated for Funiscala by de Boury (1891:205) was Scalaria pusilla Philippi, 1844 (Oligocene or Miocene, N Germany) but Cossmann (1912:86, footnote 2) stated that the type species was misidentified. Cossmann's treatment followed that of de Boury (1911:219), who discussed the problem of Funiscala in more detail. He concluded that in at least two earlier publications he had misidentified the shell he now called Scalaria speyeriana Sacco as S. pusilla. S. speyerianathen, in his opinion, became the true type species of Funiscala, whereas he now regarded S. pusilla as a species of Bifidoscala. The situation is that covered by ICZN Article 70.3. As de Boury's (1911) identification of the type species of Funiscala has been accepted by subsequent authors, the type species is here fixed (under Article 70.3) as Scalaria speyeriana Sacco, 1891, misidentified as Scalaria pusilla Philippi, 1841 in the original designation by de Boury (1891:205). De Boury (1917:50) made this case still more complex: ‘unfortunately, Funiscala must be called Rugatiscala’. He repeated the type-species problem and considered that the type species of Rugatiscala is Scala levesquei de Boury, 1887 (Cossmann 1912, pl. 3, fig. 43). He also stated (de Boury Citation1917:51) that the main distinguishing character of Bifidoscala is the presence of a single row of punctae in the [spiral] furrows, whereas Nodiscala species illustrated by Cossmann (1912, pl. 5, figs. 23, 25–27; pl. 6, figs. 9, 15, 20, 24) are more prominently and coarsely punctuate, and species assigned to Funiscala by Cossmann (1912:5, figs. 8, 9, 24) lack punctae altogether. The presence or absence and degree of punctation in various species of Opalia (sensu lato) varies greatly, and it is as difficult to use this character as all others in Epitoniidae. At present the name Funiscala (and possibly also Bifidoscala Cossmann, 1888, Rugatiscala de Boury, 1913, and several others) is regarded as a probable synonym of Nodiscala, although it is unclear whether Nodiscala really can be maintained as separate from Opalia and/or Pliciscala in the long run.\n\nOpalia (Nodiscala) nympha (Hutton, 1885) (A, B, D–F)\n\nScalaria nympha Hutton Citation1885a:321; Hutton 1893:67, pl. 8, fig. 71.\n\nEpitonium nympha.

Nukumaruan: otherwise recorded only from Nukumaruan rocks, although not recorded from Wanganui Basin Nukumaruan rocks by Fleming (1953). The single specimen attributed to this species in the GNS reference collection is from GS6985 (T24/f6489, shelly conglomerate at Ashhurst Domain, cliff 600 m W of railway bridge over Manawatu River, E of Palmerston North; Fig. 4E, F).\n\nDistribution\n\n(Waipipian?); Mangapanian–Nukumaruan, Wanganui Basin and Hawke's Bay.\n\nDimensions\n\nSyntypes, M-3098: H (incomplete) 6.1, D 2.6 mm; M-3099: H (incomplete) 6.2, D 2.9 mm; GS6985: H 7.9, D 2.8 mm.\n\nRemarks\n\nOpalia (Nodiscala) nympha is a small species (H 6–8 mm) with a teleoconch of at least seven whorls (the teleoconch spire apex and protoconch are not preserved on the material examined; naturally decollate?) with 14–15 wide, prominent, essentially smooth axial costae per whorl. The costae have narrow crests, concave sides and wide edges, merging imperceptibly into the intercostal intervals, which are each about twice the width of one costa. The intercostal intervals appear under the light microscope to be crossed by many even, fine, low, closely spaced spiral lirae, but under SEM examination these are seen to be vague, partially obliterated, irregular ridges, possibly resulting from partial abrasion of a former intriticalx. A prominent peribasal spiral rib marks off the apparently smooth, flat basal disc, and high, weakly spirally lirate varices are present at roughly one whorl intervals down the entire spire. The apertural lips are wide, double (that is, grooved), smooth on the inner edge, but raised into a prominent, spirally lirate varix on the exterior, and the inner lip is margined by a narrow fasciole. SEM examination showed that the surface between the axial ridges bears irregular, small, subcircular pits, and the basal surface inside the peribasal cord is coarsely and regularly pitted.\n\nThe most nearly similar of Recent species is Opalia maxwelli (Powell 1979:252, fig. 58.3), which has very similar axial sculpture but has a more obviously concave base and less prominent varices than O. nympha (Fig. 4C). Its surface also bears pits in the base, inside the peribasal ridge, as in O. nympha. SEM examination also showed that Recent specimens bear a finely reticulate intritacalx, and the unusual, irregularly ridged surface of both fossil specimens of O. nympha examined possibly results from the abrasion of an intritacalx. O. ahiparana (Powell 1979:262, fig. 58.1) has less prominent axial costae, two more prominent peribasal cords (one in the usual peripheral position, the other below it on the base) bearing large, rounded nodules that are not present on any other New Zealand Epitoniidae, and lacks obvious varices before the terminal one, which is more prominent than in O. nympha. The final species needing comparison, O. zelandica (Powell 1979:252, fig. 58.2) is more Epitonium-like than O. nympha, with lower, narrower and more numerous axial costae, and no peribasal spiral cord; ‘the labial varix is heavy, and previous varices are prominent on the spire at ¾ whorl intervals’ (Powell 1979:252).\n\nOpalia (Nodiscala) nympha has remained little-known since it was described, and is illustrated here with the aim of allowing wider recognition of the species, and so assessment of its possible utility as a Mangapanian–Nukumaruan index species. As noted above, its generic position also is unclear. O. nympha resembles the specimen illustrated as Funiscala levesquei (de Boury, 1887) (middle Eocene [Cuisian], Paris Basin) by Cossmann (1912, pl. 3, fig. 43). The two species have similarly prominent axial sculpture, interrupted at irregular intervals by more prominent varices, a correspondingly thickened, varicate outer lip, a similar rather restricted basal disc, and similar weak spiral sculpture. If F. levesquei were a typical Funiscala species, the generic position of O. nympha would be clear. However, in their catalogue of Paris Basin Paleogene molluscs, Le Renard & Pacaud (Citation1995:93) referred F. levesquei to Opalia (Rugatiscala) de Boury, 1913, proposed after Cossmann (1912) was published. This suggests that Rugatiscala de Boury (1913:176–177; type species Scalaria levesquei) might be a more suitable position. However, the better illustration of a complete specimen of R. levesquei by de Boury (1913, pl. 8, fig. 6) demonstrates that this is a more typically Opalia-like shell than the incomplete, more finely sculptured (evidently distinct) one illustrated by Cossmann (1912, pl. 3, fig. 43), having coarser axial and spiral sculpture than in the earlier illustration and a series of regular varices almost aligned down the ventral face of the teleoconch. The situation is further confused by the characters of the Recent species O. maxwelli, which lacks the finely reticulate surface sculpture (an intritacalx?) of species referred to Funiscala by Cossmann (1912), and is much closer in appearance to species Cossmann referred to Nodiscala de Boury, 1890. Finlay (1930b:232, pl. 44, fig. 35) proposed Nodiscala zelandica at the same time as Funiscala maxwelli, and evidently thought them not to be congeneric because of the more prominent axial ridges of O. maxwelli. As noted above, a position in O. (Nodiscala) is adopted for all the New Zealand species discussed here, but this group is urgently in need of major revision. The major generic overhaul of all epitoniids suggested by the excellent new research by Gittenberger & Gittenberger (Citation2005) and Gittenberger et al. (Citation2006) indicates that none of the species considered here is likely to be placed in its phylogenetically correct genus at present, but a huge amount of further research is required before the genera are resolved.\n\nGenus Cirsotrema Mörch, 1853\n\nCirsotrema Mörch Citation1853:49.

Weil et al. (1999:128, figs. 399, 400) placed C. zelebori in Boreoscala Kobelt, Citation1902 (type species: Scalaria greenlandica Perry, 1811, Recent, North Atlantic–North Pacific), and this has been followed by a few New Zealand authors (Morley Citation2004:101). The New Zealand fossil and Recent species are definitely less elaborately sculptured than the more extreme Recent tropical species of Cirsotrema. However, the rather different nature of the wide, simple, closely spaced spiral cords, lack of a basal disc, and wide, low, smooth, convex-crested axial ridges of Boreoscala greenlandica (see Bouchet & Warén 1986:518, figs. 1210–1213), compared with the complex orders of spiral cords and threads and complex, multilamellate varices in New Zealand species assigned to Cirsotrema, makes a position in Boreoscala unlikely to be correct. The original assignment of Australasian fossil species to Cirsotrema was made by the well-known epitoniid specialist de Boury (1887:40), who regarded Tate's Adelaide Eocene species Caloscala mariae Tate, 1885 and the other species included in Caloscala by Tate, Scalaria lyrata Zittel, 1864 (Oligocene–Miocene, New Zealand) as species of Cirsotrema. As de Boury's (1887) work is not widely available, his brief statement is quoted in full here: ‘The subgenus Caloscala has been established by M. Ralph Tate for C. lyrata (Zittel) and C. mariae, Ralph Tate. The author has had the generosity to send us a very beautiful example of this latter species, which has many similarities [“beaucoup de rapports”] with S. acuta, Sow. We have demonstrated that this species cannot be separated from the true Cirsotrema’ (free translation from de Boury 1887:40). Later, de Boury (1911:215) restated this case: ‘I persist in thinking that there is no place to conserve this subgenus [Caloscala], which appears to include shells belonging to Cirsotrema Mörch. These forms cannot be, as I had thought for a while, confounded with our subgenus Coroniscala, which differs completely from Cirsotrema by its ribs, which are not at all crisped and frilled like those of the last subgenus’ [Cirsotrema]. The illustration of C. mariae by Tate (Citation1893, pl. 12, fig. 2) shows a shell very similar to such large, prominently sculptured New Zealand fossil species as C. lyratum (Zittel, Citation1864) and the Argentinean fossil species C. rugulosum (G. B. Sowerby I, 1846) (Griffin & Nielsen Citation2008:305, pl. 23, figs. 8, 9). Cossmann (1912:52) and de Boury (1913:170) also expressly included C. zelebori in Cirsotrema. The Nukumaruan–Castlecliffian specimens reported below, with thicker varices than C. zelebori, are intermediate in many characters between C. zelebori and the large Oligocene–Miocene species such as C. lyratum and C. caelicola Finlay, 1926, helping confirm a position in Cirsotrema for C. zelebori. On the other hand, it should be noted that Cossmann, ‘avec la collaboration de M. de Boury’ (1912, pl. 3, figs. 5, 6), placed the large Patagonian Oligocene–early Miocene species here identified as Cirsotrema rugulosum (G. B. Sowerby I, 1846) in genus Boreoscala, significantly confusing the generic position, as these South American shells are exceedingly similar to the large New Zealand fossils of the same age. The large Recent southern Australian species Dannevigena martyr Iredale (1936:303, pl. 22, fig. 25; Wilson 1993:275, pl. 44, fig. 4; named for the drowned captain of FIS ‘Endeavour’, HC Dannevig; Verco Citation1935, pl. 16) is particularly closely similar to the large New Zealand and South American Oligocene–Miocene species assigned to Cirsotrema, although its spiral sculpture (‘faintly … striate’; Wilson 1993:275) is weaker than on most fossil species, other than C. gagei Maxwell (Citation1978:36, fig. 44). There is little doubt that C. martyr is a Recent species of the same clade as the Australian, New Zealand and South American fossil species, that is, Dannevigena is a further synonym of Caloscala and Cirsotrema. It seems likely that more of the greatly over-split subgenera proposed in Epitoniidae by de Boury should be regarded as synonyms of Cirsotrema. If the very similar New Zealand, Australian and South American fossil species usually assigned to Cirsotrema should require a distinct genus or subgenus, Caloscala Tate, 1885 is available for them. Like Recent tropical Cirsotrema species, but few other epitoniids, the fossils have a calcitic teleoconch and preserve well in limestone faunas from which the aragonitic molluscs have been dissolved. Epitoniidae is perhaps the most obvious group crying out for resolution by molecular techniques, because of its poorly understood phylogeny, staggering diversity and few, intergrading taxonomic characters, and a position in Cirsotrema should be maintained for C. zelebori and similar species until molecular studies can be carried out to confirm or deny this position.\n\nTate (1885:3) included two species in Caloscala, but did not designate a type species. I am grateful to TA Darragh (Museum Victoria pers. comm. September 2005) for pointing out that Tate (1890:230) subsequently designated the type species himself, with the statement (under the heading Scalaria (Cirsotrema) mariae Tate) that ‘This species is the type of my subgenus Caloscala…’.\n\nCirsotrema zelebori (Dunker, Citation1866) (A–E)\n\nScalaria zelebori Dunker in Dunker & Zelebor 1866:912; Hutton Citation1873a:21; Hutton 1880:69; Tryon Citation1887:78, pl. 15, fig. 75; Hutton 1893:66; Clessin 1897:50, pl. 13, fig. 5; Suter in Hutton Citation1904:80; Suter 1905a:72; Moss Citation1908:30, pl. 7, fig. 17.\n\nScala (Opalia?) zelebori.

(D) C. zelebori, holotype of Scalaria intermedia Hutton, TM8285, Tainui Shellbed (Castlecliffian, OIS 13), “Shakespeare Cliff”, Wanganui; height 33.2 mm.\n\nType material\n\nThe type material of Scalaria zelebori was stated by Suter (1913:322) to be in NHMW. Anita Eschner (NHMW pers. comm. 5 October 2007) reported that 11 syntypes of Scalaria zelebori are present: NHMW 89781 (one syntype, labelled as ‘Dunker's original’), NHMW 89782 (nine syntypes), and NHMW 89783 (one syntype, from J Zelebor's collection), all from ‘New Zealand’ (not seen). The type material of Scalaria reevei was stated by Clessin (1897:63) to be in ‘Mus. Stuttgt.’ [Stuttgart], not seen. Scalaria intermedia, holotype TM8285 (Fig. 5D), from Shakespeare Cliff, Wanganui; almost certainly from Tainui Shellbed (OIS 13).\n\nCossmann (1912:52) listed the name ‘Scalaria huttoni de B. (=Sc. intermedia Hutton)’, so presumably Cossmann and de Boury thought that S. intermedia is a junior homonym, but did not state the earlier usage, and I have been unable to find one. De Boury (1913) returned to the name Scalaria intermedia Hutton, so apparently it is not preoccupied. This is unimportant, as S. intermedia is clearly a synonym of C. zelebori.\n\nOther material examined\n\nNot listed; widespread and not uncommon. The earliest record of Cirsotrema zelebori seems to be from Kaawa Creek, SW Auckland, Opoitian (Laws Citation1936:111). It occurs at most younger fossil localities throughout New Zealand, including almost all formations in Wanganui Basin. I have seen the apparently distinct Turakina valley species (OIS 43–41?; see below) only from the one early Castlecliffian shellbed. Recent specimens of C. zelebori occur throughout New Zealand, usually found washing ashore on sandy beaches; particularly common on Orewa Beach, Northland. Its host cnidarian(s) have not been identified.\n\nDistribution\n\nOpoitian (early Pliocene) to Recent, throughout New Zealand.\n\nDimensions\n\n‘Type’ of Scalaria zelebori: H 24, D 8 mm (Suter 1913:322); Scalaria intermedia, holotype: H 33.2 (incomplete, originally ca 36), D 12.4 mm; Recent, RM4759, Waihi Beach, Bay of Plenty: H 27.2, D 9.6 mm; H 26.3, D 9.6 mm; RM319, Mount Maunganui, Bay of Plenty: H (incomplete) 27.0, D 10.2 mm; H 26.2, D 9.5 mm; NMNZ M.18724, Waihi Beach, Bay of Plenty: H 30.4, D 11.5 mm; NMNZ M.277711, beach, Maioro, SW of Waiuku, SW Auckland: H 29.8, D 10.6 mm; H 28.3, D 11.1 mm.\n\nRemarks\n\nSuter (1899a:54) and de Boury (1913:170) attributed the name Scalaria zelebori to Frauenfeld, as Frauenfeld (1867:7) seems to have considered that he described the species first. However, the name was first published by Dunker (in Dunker & Zelebor 1866:912), as Suter (1905a:72) later pointed out.\n\nFleming (1953:144) listed ‘Cirsotrema n. sp. aff. zelebori (Dunk.)’ in the fauna from Nukumaru Brown Sand in the Nukumaru Beach coastal section, from GS4117, R22/f6437, ‘unlocalised as to member’. Reconsideration of this record, among the many other ‘n. sp.’ records of molluscs by Fleming (1953), raised the question of the status of Scalaria intermedia Hutton, 1873, and more generally the taxonomy of New Zealand late Neogene species of Cirsotrema.\n\nThe holotype of Scalaria intermedia has not been illustrated previously, and an illustration therefore is provided here (Fig. 5D) as an example of a typical, large specimen of C. zelebori. The question of its status was considered by de Boury (1913:170–171), who examined a ‘magnifique’ specimen identified as C. intermedia, 27 mm high, which MNHN acquired from M Bonnet (a fossil, and so presumably from Castlecliff, Wanganui; de Boury did not state a locality, but Cossmann [1912:52] cited Wanganui). De Boury thought C. intermedia distinct from C. zelebori, although he admitted that he had compared Scala intermedia with only a few abraded Recent specimens of C. zelebori, and that comparison with better specimens was desirable. The holotype is merely a large specimen of C. zelebori. The spiral sculpture, the number and position of the complex axial lamellae and the ridges and nodules formed on them by the spiral cords, the peribasal cord, and the aperture, including the fasciolar ridge alongside the inner lip, all agree exactly. The only slight difference, also pointed out by de Boury (apart from the slightly larger size of C. intermedia at the same number of whorls—27 vs 24 mm), is the slightly higher and thinner axial lamellae of the fossil. However, the varices are compound axial ridges as in Recent material, and the holotype is closely comparable with many Recent specimens. The specimen identified by Fleming (1953:144) as ‘C. n. sp. aff. zelebori’ (GS4117, R22/f6437) also agrees in almost all characters with Recent specimens, and again has slightly higher and thinner axial lamellae than most Recent specimens. There is little doubt that this difference is trivial.\n\nNützel (1998:93, pl. 13I–K,O–Q) illustrated specimens of Cirsotrema zelebori, including SEM enlargements showing the micropunctate sculpture. The very small punctae occur in spiral rows in the interspaces of the spiral cords (Fig. 5C,E), although Nützel (1998:93) noted that the punctae are not visible on all specimens. SEM examination showed that the punctae are much smaller and sparser than those of Opalia species, seem to be at least partially revealed by corrosion of the shell surface, and vary in visibility over the surface of one specimen. This newly revealed character requires comparison in a range of other New Zealand material to determine whether it is present, but is likely to be present on all Cirsotrema species.\n\nTwo specimens from a Maoricrypta-dominated shellbed exposed on Turakina Valley Road, east of Wanganui (Fig. 5A; GS15338, S22/f0164, S22/096385, ca 600 m S of Mangara Stream bridge and ca 200 m N of Glenroy Station; early Castlecliffian, ca OIS 43–41) belong in a species distinct from Cirsotrema zelebori. They are similar in appearance to a moderate-sized specimen of C. zelebori, but have a slightly wider spire angle, very wide, almost smooth axial ridges (heavy varices), up to five times as thick as on any specimens of C. zelebori I have seen, and a very wide, prominent fasciolar ridge alongside the inner lip. However, it is unclear to what extent the smoothness of the outer surfaces of the lamellae is due to abrasion. If it is naturally smooth, these specimens conform to the description provided by A Grebneff (Otago Uuniversity pers. comm. May 2008) of Cirsotrema forresti Dell (1956b:40, figs. 33, 47, 48), originally proposed in C. (Tioria) Marwick, 1928. Grebneff has concluded that the Cirsotrema species in deep, cool water in southern New Zealand is C. forresti, with a slightly lower spire than in C. zelebori, smooth rather than spirally ridged variceal surfaces, a more prominent basal cord and fasciole than in C. zelebori, and in many specimens a nodule or spine on the shoulder (adapical extremity) of each axial ridge. It seems possible that this species occurs at Wanganui. However, it is likely that the Turakina Valley Road specimens are smooth because they have been abraded during reworking from Nukumaruan or older rocks, and the wider varices suggest that they are a species distinct from both C. zelebori and C. forresti. A few other, relatively large specimens of C. zelebori from Nukumaruan localities (GS4259, R22/f6489, muddy sandstone below Kuranui Limestone, Waitotara desert [Fleming 1953:130]; Nukumaru Limestone, bluff alongside Nukumaru Stream on New Plymouth-Wanganui highway, in GNS) include specimens with much thicker axial ridges than any Recent specimens seen, but are not as extreme as the Turakina Valley Road early Castlecliffian ones. The latter probably represent an unnamed species, but better material is required to confirm their distinctive characters. An attempt at re-collection of this material did not reveal any further specimens.\n\nCirsotrema zelebori is also similar to Epitonium (Boreoscala) blainei Clench & Turner (1953:361, pl. 180), from Florida (A Grebneff pers. comm. May 2008). The illustrations by Clench & Turner (Citation1953) show a specimen with thicker, slightly more fluted axial ridges and coarser spiral cords than C. zelebori, although otherwise similar in size, shape and the presence of a peribasal spiral cord. Clench & Turner (1953:362) mentioned the similarity of E. blainei to ‘E. magellanicum Philippi [1845] from Patagonia’. C. magellanicum is another species of the same group as C. zelebori, but has weaker spiral sculpture and a slightly lower spire than C. zelebori, and is possibly descended from the Patagonian fossil species related to C. rugulosum.\n\nClade Neogastropoda\n\nFamily Buccinulidae\n\nRemarks\n\nI follow Harasewych & Kantor (Citation2004) in recognizing on anatomical grounds several of the Southern Hemisphere families proposed by Powell (1929). In particular, most New Zealand ‘buccinids’ probably belong in Buccinulidae Powell, 1929 whereas, if ‘Buccinulum’ pangoides Beu, 1973 is correctly referred to Euthria (as is suggested below), it seems likely to be a member of the mostly Northern Hemisphere family Buccinidae. It should be noted, however, that Hayashi (Citation2005) did not distinguish Buccinulidae from a monophyletic Buccinidae on the grounds of molecular phylogeny (determined from complete 16S rRNA gene sequences). The family position of Iredalula has long been in doubt, and in recent years it has usually been referred to the Buccinidae (sensu lato), but following Ponder (1968b) and Beu & Maxwell (Citation1987), it seems likely to be a member of the Colubrariidae, which was recognized as a family by Bouchet et al. (2005).\n\nGenus Aeneato r Finlay, 1926\n\nAeneator Finlay Citation1926b:414.

Type species (by original designation): Ellicea (Pittella) valida Marwick, 1928, Pliocene, Pitt Island, Chatham Islands.\n\nRemarks\n\nAlthough it has been customary in recent years to treat Ellicea Finlay, 1928 as a synonym of Aeneator Finlay, 1926 (e.g. Powell 1979:201; Spencer & Willan, 1996:26; Spencer et al. 2009:208), their fossil records seem to indicate that they had distinct times of origin in New Zealand and, therefore, possibly different ancestors. Ellicea has the earlier first record (Tongaporutuan, early late Miocene; three bathyal species described) whereas Aeneator huttoni Finlay, 1930 (Kapitean, latest Miocene) is the earliest species recorded in Aeneator (sensu stricto) in New Zealand. Both are otherwise Pliocene to Recent (sub?)genera, at least in New Zealand. Trophon succinctusTenison Woods (1897:16, pl. 4, fig. 6, 6a) was referred to Ellicea by Darragh (1970:198) and Goudey (Citation2006:32, figs. 6, 6a; 49, fig.1) and superficially resembles Ellicea species closely, especially E. valida (Marwick) (1928:486, fig. 130) from Waipipian (Pliocene) Whenuataru Tuff, Pitt Island, Chatham islands. However, TA Darragh (Museum Victoria pers. comm. 6 August 2010) informed me that T. succinctus belongs in Dennantia Tate, 1888. This removes an apparently anomalously shallow-water record of what is an entirely bathyal (sub)genus in New Zealand. At least three species living along the Chilean coast at present have been assigned to Aeneator (McLean & Andrade Citation1982:12-15; Osorio & Romajo Citation2007) and one referred to A. (Ellicea) (A. loisae Rehder Citation1971:593, figs. 7, 8). Most of these species would be better referred to another (unnamed?) genus, but A. loisae does seem to be a species of Ellicea, suggesting the possibility that Ellicea was a Neogene migrant to New Zealand. The Seymour Island Eocene species referred to Aeneator by Stilwell & Zinsmeister (1990) seem more likely to belong in the Antarctic genus Prosipho Thiele, 1912 (Beu Citation2009). Ellicea and Aeneator also possibly had an earlier, unrecorded history in New Zealand. Further research is needed on these obviously similar generic groups, but it seems likely that they are not as closely related, in a phylogenetic sense, as the similar teleoconchs and radulae of Recent species seem to indicate. Once again, this is a question that will be resolved by DNA studies.\n\nAeneator (Aeneator) delicatulus Powell, 1929 (E, J)\n\nAeneator delicatula Powell 1929:91, pl. 4, fig. 75.\n\nAeneator delicatulus.

(E,J) Aeneator (Aeneator) delicatulus Powell, GS10909, R22/f6319A, Omapu Shellbed (Castlecliffian, OIS 23), E of Mowhanau Beach, Wanganui; height 64.4 mm.\n\nType material\n\nAeneator delicatulus holotype AIM AK72003, from between Kai-Iwi and Okehu Streams, Castlecliff coastal section, Wanganui. Powell (1929:92) also recorded a ‘large specimen’ (here regarded as a paratype) in GS1163, R22/f6498, between Ototoka and Okehu Streams, Wanganui coastal section, but this specimen cannot be located in GNS.\n\nOther material examined\n\nCastlecliffian: the stratigraphically lowest record of Aeneator delicatulus is in Kaimatira Pumice Sand (OIS 25; Fleming 1953:188) in the Castlecliff coastal section. Other records are from Lower Kai-Iwi Siltstone (OIS 23), particularly common (Fleming 1953:192), Omapu Shellbed (OIS 23; Fleming 1953:194) and Lower Westmere Siltstone (OIS 21; Fleming 1953:196). Records from Kaikokopu Shell Grit (OIS 19; Fleming 1953:199, ‘Aeneator aff. delicatula’) and Kupe Formation (OIS 17) in at least two collections (Fleming 1953:203, gastropod shellbed and Mactra tristis layer, ‘A. aff. delicatula’) are based on small, abraded, equivocal specimens, possibly all reworked from older units. A. delicatula therefore essentially is limited to Kaimatira Pumice Sand and the siltstone beds of OIS 27–21 in cycles exposed in the cliffs NW and SE of Mowhanau Beach, Castlecliff. Specimens in the GNS reference collection are: Kai-Iwi, Castlecliff, CA Fleming collection (three); basal conglomerate member, Upper Okehu Siltstone (OIS 27), coast W of Kai-Iwi, Wanganui (GS4075, R22/f6406, one, slightly coarser spiral sculpture than others); upper part of Lower Kai-Iwi Siltstone (OIS 23), Castlecliff section (GS4061, R22/f6392, six); Omapu Shellbed (OIS 23), coast E of Omapu Stream, E of Mowhanau, Wanganui (GS4060, R22/f6391, and GS10909, R22/f6391A, eight); fossiliferous silt member, Lower Westmere Siltstone (Lower Westmere Shellbed; Abbott & Carter 1999; OIS 21), coast E of Mowhanau, Castlecliff (GS4058, R22/f6389, one).\n\nDistribution\n\nEarly Castlecliffian, OIS 25–21; 19–17?, Wanganui Basin only; there are no records from localities away from the excellent exposures in the coastal section.\n\nDimensions\n\nAeneator delicatulus, holotype: H 42, D 21.5 mm; large specimen in GS1163: H 68, D 31 mm (Powell 1929:92); GS10909, R22/f6319A, Omapu Shellbed: H 54.4, D 27.5 mm (Fig. 26A,B; specimen illustrated by Beu & Maxwell 1990, pl. 48o).\n\nRemarks\n\nAeneator delicatulus is a very distinctive, small Aeneator species with a short spire, a long, very straight, left-inclined anterior siphonal canal, and consistently very fine, closely spaced, silky-looking spiral sculpture. The maximum size achieved is smaller and the sculpture of A. delicatulus is quite obviously much finer than that of the much more common and widespread, more long-ranging type species of the genus, A. marshalli (Murdoch, 1924) (Nukumaruan–Recent) and there is no doubt that these are distinct species. A. marshalli also is not found in siltstone beds, and seems essentially limited to Type B shellbeds (high-stand systems tract shellbeds) in the Wanganui succession. As Recent specimens occasionally wash ashore on ocean beaches (e.g. Ohope Beach, Whakatane), at least part of the range of A. marshalli is evidently further inshore than that formerly inhabited by A. delicatulus.\n\nThe type material of Aeneator marshalli includes four syntypes representing two possible species; two are the relatively large, short-spired species usually known by this name, whereas two are the smaller, more elongate, possibly distinct species A. attenuatus Powell, 1927. These all seem best regarded as syntypes despite Murdoch's (1924:159,160) statements ‘Type in the Wanganui Museum’ and ‘A fossil specimen is chosen for the type…’, as the illustrated specimen is not identified as ‘type’ in the caption, and no syntype is now labelled as ‘type’ or any other qualifying word or phrase. To ensure that this name is maintained in its accustomed usage, Murdoch's (1924) larger illustrated syntype is here designated the lectotype of Verconella marshalli Murdoch, 1924 (Fig. 6A; GNS TM6837, ‘Castlecliff, blue sandy clays’). One of the other, taller syntypes was also illustrated by Murdoch (1924, pl. 10, figs. 2, 3) as ‘Verconella marshalli (juv.)’. Dimensions of lectotype: H 71.7, D 33.5 mm.\n\nGenus Buccinulum Deshayes, 1830\n\nBuccinulum Deshayes 1830:143.

Beu & Maxwell 1990:362, pl. 49b; Maxwell 2009:244.\n\nType material\n\nBuccinulum (Evarnula) caudatum,, holotype AIM AK72018, from ‘between Kai Iwi and Okehu, Wanganui, Upper Pliocene’ (Powell 1929:76), that is, early Castlecliffian beds of the Wanganui coastal section (not seen).\n\nOther material examined\n\nCastlecliffian: Buccinulum caudatum was recorded by Fleming (1953:188, 192, 194, 196, 199, 203) from Kaimatira Pumice Sand (‘B. aff. caudatum’; OIS 25), Lower Kai-Iwi Siltstone and Omapu Shellbed (OIS 23), fossiliferous silt member of Lower Westmere Siltstone (Lower Westmere Shellbed; Abbott & Carter 1999; OIS 21), Kaikokopu Shell Grit (OIS 19), and Kupe Formation (‘derived’; OIS 17). As with Aeneator delicatulus, the youngest records are based on equivocal, abraded specimens, possibly derived from older formations, and the true time range seems to be OIS 25–19. Specimens in the GNS reference collection are: Kai-Iwi, Castlecliff, CA Fleming collection, labelled ‘topotypes’ (15); fossiliferous silt member, Lower Westmere Siltstone, Castlecliff coast (GS4058, R22/f6389, two); Omapu Shellbed, coast E of Omapu Stream, E of Mowhanau, Wanganui (GS4060 re-collection, R22/f6391, 30).\n\nDistribution\n\nEarly Castlecliffian, OIS 25–19 (–17?), in the Wanganui coastal section only.\n\nDimensions\n\nBuccinulum caudatum, holotype: H 57.5, D 27 mm; paratype: H 61, D 27.5 mm (Powell 1929:76); GS4060, R22/f6391, Omapu Shellbed: H 48.1, D 23.2 mm; H 38.8, D 18.9 mm; ‘Kai-Iwi, topotypes’, CA Fleming collection: H 52.0, D 27.3 mm; H 47.6, D 25.3 mm.\n\nRemarks\n\nAs with Aeneator delicatulus, Buccinulum caudatum is limited to early Castlecliffian rocks (OIS 25–19; 17?) and as it is a very large, highly distinctive species, the largest species referred to Buccinulum (the still larger B. pangoides Beu, 1973 is transferred below to Euthria Gray, 1850), it is useful for biostratigraphy within Wanganui Basin. Ponder (1971:243) treated B. caudatum as a subspecies of B. linea (Martyn, 1784). However, the species status of B. caudatum is demonstrated by both the strongly marked morphological differences and the partial syntopy of the two forms. Specimens of B. caudatum differ from those of B. linea in their much larger size, in their strongly concave rather than straight or weakly concave sutural ramp, in their much more prominent axial ridges, in their longer and more prominent transverse (spiral) ridges inside the outer lip, and in their more flared outer margin of the outer lip, outside the transverse ridges. The protoconch also is correspondingly larger than that of B. linea. The stratigraphic range of B. caudatum is virtually identical to that of Aeneator delicatulus, and specimens of the two species occur syntopically. However, specimens of B. caudatum are more common in Kaikokopu Shellbed than is A. delicatulus, and it seems likely that at least some of these are in situ, that is, its time range more certainly extends up to include OIS 19.\n\nGenus Cominella Gray, 1850\n\nCominella Gray 1850:72.

Eucominia elegantula verrucosa, holotype AIM AK70282 (O Lee, AIM, pers. comm. 11 March 2008); Finlay (1926a:241) stated the locality only as ‘same as last, with the species itself, but rarer’, that is, he used ‘subspecies’ in the sense of a sculptural variant rather than the modern usage of a geographically isolated form. Cominella (Eucominia) marlboroughensis, holotype AIM AK71453, Recent, from 150 m, 41°16′S, 173°17′E, ca 40 km E of Cape Campbell, Cook Strait (all not seen).\n\nOther material examined\n\nMangapanian: a single specimen from Weka Pass, N Canterbury (GS6215, M34/f7660, 50 m above Waiauan limestone, Weka Creek, 160 m downstream from junction with Weka Pass Stream; with Taxonia suteri, Polinices waipipiensis (Marwick, 1924), and Glycymerita (Manaia) manaiaensis (Marwick, 1923)) resembles Cominella elegantula and C. virgata closely in most characters, but is a little larger than any specimens from Wanganui or Hawke's Bay and has rather more prominent spiral cords. It possibly represents an unnamed species.

Recorded also by Fleming (1953:151) from GS3093, S22/f9489, Waipuru Shellbed (?), Hunterville-Turakina Valley Road 5 km W of Hunterville, Rangitikei valley. Castlecliffian: common in most later Castlecliffian highstand systems tract shellbeds at Wanganui, not listed; recorded by Fleming (1953:203–204, 209, 218, 230, 239) from gastropod shellbed, Cyclomactra tristis, and bivalve shellbed members of Kupe Formation (OIS 17), undifferentiated Kai-Iwi Group, W side Whangaehu valley (GS4235, S22/f6457, ‘cf. verrucosa’), Lower Castlecliff Shellbed (OIS 15), Tainui Shellbed (OIS 13), and Upper Castlecliff Shellbed (OIS 11). Recent: the holotype of Cominella marlboroughensis and the material reported by Dell (1956b:52, 53) as ‘Eucominia marlboroughensis’ and ‘Eucominia cf. elegantula’ are from Cook Strait (150 m, 40 km E of Cape Campbell, Cook Strait, holotype; 275 m, 41°28.5′S, 174°50′E, & 110 m, between Island Bay Bank and East Bank [Dell 1956b:52], and 137 m, 40°52.6′S, 174°49.5′E [Dell 1956a:53]); 15 other lots in NMNZ, ranging from Kahurangi Shoals, N Westland, 91 m (M.59050, four small) and off Westhaven Inlet, to off Kapiti Island (M.7681, two), throughout Cook Strait, to Port Gore, Marlborough, 139–144 m (M.53717, one small) and to Palliser Bay, E Cook Strait, in 274 m (M.11543, one). The largest lot is M.135047, Nicholson Canyon, off Turakirae Head, 640 m (24 stained, dead specimens).\n\nDistribution\n\nMangapanian, N Canterbury?; early (rarely) and late Nukumaruan in Hawke's Bay and (rarely) Wanganui Basin; common in later Castlecliffian rocks of Wanganui Basin; still living offshore in Cook Strait in about 110–280 m. Available records suggest that in Hawke's Bay, Cominella elegantula is limited to upper beds of Petane Group (Darkys Spur Formation to Te Ngaru Mudstone, and possibly a few"
