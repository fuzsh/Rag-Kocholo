(Lou) Paardekooper, 1916-1966, member of the former Dutch mollusca working group.\n\nProf. Eystein Karl Mørner Paasche, (17 Sep. - Oslo) 1932-, Norwegian algologist, who was professor of Marine Botany in Oslo.\n\nThe gastropod name Alvania paatsi Hoenselaar & Goud, 1998 is named after the technician Mr. J.J.P. Paats, 19??-, for his participation in the CANCAP-expedition for marine biological research in the Canarian-Cape Verdean region of the North Atlantic Ocean (1976-1986). (Curator Henk K. Mienis, Tel Aviv Univ., kindly provided this information).\n\nStephan Ion Pace, (22 Nov. - London) 1872-1941 (13 Dec. - London), English malacologist (a student of Columbellidae), director of the Marine Biological Association of the W of Scotland , i.e. Millport, where he arrived from Plymouth in June 1905 until 1907 (when he resigned and was replaced by R. Elmhirst (q.v.)) [Columbella pacei E.A. Smith, 1895; also Columbella pacei Melvill & Standen, 1896, renamed C. stephani Melvill & Standen, 1897, after realizing that their first name was preoccupied ], in January 1904 married to the marine biologist Rose Mable Clark, 18??-19??, who worked on hydroids and bryozoans. He also studied holothurians, describing i.a. Cucumaria normani, a synonym of Aslia lefevrei. He was considered to dislike amateur researchers. From 1897 and three years he had been in Torres Strait and surroundings to conduct experiments with pearls in the pearl industry. After Millport he went to London, working part-time at the British Museum (Nat. Hist.), where his very good friend E.A. Smith (q.v.) was working. He took part in WWI, but later suffering from severe headaches, he never could continue his research work. Another namesake is the stalwart South Florida collector Robert (Bob) Pace, 19??-, from Miami [Ancilla (Amalda) pacei Petuch, 1987, Coralliophila pacei Petuch, 1987, Terebra (Strioterebrum) pacei Petuch, 1987, Conus pacei Petuch, 1987, Trivia (Niveria) pacei Petuch, 1987, Modulus pacei Petuch, 1987, Cerithium muscarum pacei Petuch, 1987, Cyclotheca pacei Petuch, 1987, Dermomurex pacei E. J. Petuch, 1988, Favartia pacei E. J. Petuch, 1988 (several of these species named for Pace's exploratory collecting in the Bimini area [thank you Riccardo Giannuzzi-Savelli for this information and for the information about Mrs. Alice Pace below])]. Mrs. Alice Pace, 19??-, Miami, may likely be R. Pace's wife and she is honoured in the names Muricopsis aliceae Petuch, 1987 and Cerithium eburneum aliceae Petuch, 1987. (Andrew Vik, Tampa, Florida kindly provided most of the information about R. Pace).\n\nA. Pack (possibly identical with the US educator Arthur Newton Pack, (20 Feb. - Cleveland, Ohio) 1893-1975 (6 Dec.)), published on ciliates from the Great Salt Lake in 1919 and is honoured in the ciliate name Strongylidium packi Calkins, 1919.\n\nDr. Alpheus Spring Packard Jr., (19 Feb. - Brunswick, Maine) 1839-1905 (14 Feb.), was Professor of Zoology and Geology (from 1878) at Brown University (Rhode Island, USA) and professor of Biology and Geology at Bodwin College, Maine. As a boy, he collected and read about molluscs and their shells, encouraged by his father Prof. Alpheus Spring Packard Sr, 1798-1884, a professor of classical languages. Packard was well-known at this time in the Boston Society of Natural History, and was acquainted with Louis Agassiz (q.v.), A.A. Gould (q.v.), S. F. Baird (q.v.), and other mid-century naturalists in USA. Packard attended Harvard with Agassiz as his teacher. His youthful interests expanded to insects, fishes, and general marine zoology, a precursor of his adult contributions. He did well in so many fields that it is difficult to characterize any specialty. He traveled widely, forming strong connections with foreign scholars. One of the last of his 500+ publications was a biography (1901) of his intellectual hero Lamarck (q.v.). Packard is honored by his name attached to 3 insect genera and at least 39 (mostly insect) species. Within these is the amphipod Monoculodes packardi Boeck, 1870 [Pleurotomella packardii Verrill, 1872]. (Dr. D. Damkaer kindly provided this information).\n\nDr. Earl Leroy Packard, 1885-1983?, US palaeontologist and malacologist at the Univ. of Oregon.

Later (in 1882) he moved to his wife's home city Hamburg and founded the Natural History Museum there, becoming its first director. [Janua pagenstecheri (de Quatrefages, 1866), Lumbricillus pagenstecheri (Ratzel, 1869), Henricia pagenstecheri (Studer)]. A namesake and far away relative, Dr. Arnold Andreas Friedrich Pagenstecher, (25 Dec. - Dillenburg) 1837-1913 (11 June - Wiesbaden), Wiesbaden, was an entomologist and lepidopterologist.

A hobby entomologist, Charles Jackson Paine, (17 June - Weston, Massachusetts) 1876-1926 (4 Aug. - Vanceboro, Maine), businessman and banker is likely not the honoured person, but possibly John Howard Paine, (9 Sep. - Cleveland, Ohio) 1888-19??, (not identical with the identical namesake, the author of the well known \"Home Sweet Home\", who lived between 1792-1852), who in his teens was collecting mollusks together with the 8 years older Lowe (q,v.) assisted by mother and daughter Fancher and Fancher Sawin (see Fancher) studied by Dall (and later a disciple of V.L. Kellogg (q.v.)), or perhaps - considering his young age at the time - rather to his father Charles C. Paine. (28 Mar. - Painesville, Ohio) 1848- 19??, - and the Los Angeles Times credited the work to John's father: \"Avalon, July 14, Commodore C. C. Paine has begun a series of biological researches in the waters hereabouts. He has procured a deep-sea dredge and is bringing up from the ocean depths things new, strange and beautiful.\". C.C. Paine had been a soldier in the Civil War and the son John later studied entomology at Stanford (A.B. in 1912) as a student of V.L. Kellogg (see Heath) and published on Mallophaga and Lepidoptera at least until 1917. He worked for U.S. Dept. of Agriculture until about 1919 and as a portrait photographer during the 1920s. In 1931 he is listed as production manager in Washington, DC for Underwood & Underwood (photography). (David Hollombe, Los Angeles, kindly provided the lead to which Paine who is the most likely honouree and much of this information)\n\nDr. Daniel Pajaud, (21 Dec. - Paris) 1934-2003 (13 Nov.

His dissertation in Leiden treated intestinal worms and he became Professor of Natural History in 1767, but he is most renowned for beeing contracted by the Russian government in 1768 to travel through Siberia during 6 years, where he collected huge amounts of material, which he later worked up and described in St Petersburg after returning there 30 July 1774. In 1793 he again was sent on a new expedition to the Crimea area, where he, his wife and daughter stayed during several years in an estate given to him by the emperess Katharina II, (who's favorite he was), but almost 70 years old he returned home to Berlin [Pallasea Bate, 1862, Cryptosula pallasiana (Moll, 1803), Stenurus pallasii (van Beneden, 1870), Amicula pallasii A.

Likely the self-taught British botanist and physician Dr. Edward Palmer, (12 Jan. - Norfolk County, England) 1831-1911 (10 Apr. - Washington D.C.), who mainly was active in USA (arrived there - Cleveland, Ohio - at age 18) and i.a. collected land shells in Mexico, described by Dall and also much other natural objects in SW USA, may be the honoured person.\n\nThe parasitic nematode name Cucullanus palmeri Crites & Overstreet, 1997 is a tribute to Ronnie G. Palmer, 19??-, for \"superb technical assistance\".\n\nAbout the Balearic Islands mysid name Burrimysis palmeri Jaume & Garcia, 1993, the authors wrote: \"The species is dedicated to\" Dr. \"Miquel Palmer\", 19??-, \"who helped us during the field work\".\n\nLacking information about Palmer in the Micronesian amphipod name Beaudettia palmeri J.L.

(The medusa was named by Olof Swartz, (21 Sep. Norrköping) 1760-1818 (19 Sep.), a Swedish natural history collector, who travelled in E USA (Philadelphia & Boston areas), Jamaica, E South American coastline between 1783-87 - the last year, however, in London, bringing together a lot of material).\n\nThe monogenean name Calicotyle palombi Euzet & Williams, 1970, the triclade genus name Palombiella Westblad, 1951 and the cestodan name Rhinebothrium palombi Baer, 1948 mustall be in honour of Arturo Palombi, 1899-1987, Italian marine biologist / helminthologist at the Zoological Station in Napoli.\n\nM.W. (or M.V.) Paltschikowa-Ostroumowa, 1???-19??, described in 1925 the medusa Ostroumovia inkermanica from the Sevastopol area [Ostroumovia Hadzi, 1928], but it had already earlier been named Thaumantias maeotica A.A.

She retired formally in 1973, but continued to work for another decade. Parker Bank in the Louisiana shelf is also named for her. An earlier namesake dealing with foraminiferans (known during his life mainly for his vertebrate skull studies) was the British physician Dr. William Kitchen Parker, (23 June - Dogsthorpe, near Peterborough) 1823-1890 (3 July - Cardiff), publishing together with T.R. Jones (q.v.) , W.B. Carpenter (q.v.) and others.\n\nLacking information about R.H. Parker in the amphipod name Bathyporeia parkeri Bousfield, 1973. Parker collected amphipods for Bousfield in the Hadley Harbor region. He may be identical with Dr. Robert H.

County Sanitation Dist., California), who kindly provided the material)\".\n\nThe gastropod name Ithycythara parkeri Abbott, 1958 and the bivalve name Cuspidaria parkeri Knudsen, 1970 may possibly honour the malacologist John Dyas Parker, (5 June) 1915-1977 (2 Feb.), Pilsbry's (q.v.) long-time assistant.\n\nThe Baja California gastropod name Turritella parkeri J.H. McLean, 1970 is perhaps likely a tribute to R.H. Parker (above), who was active and i.a. worked on board the R/V \"Thomas Washington\", which found the species in 1968, during that time.\n\nMactra parkesiana Hedley, 1902 was named for Miss L. Parkes, 18??-19??, a daughter of the veteran Australian statesman, and who presented her specimen to the Australian Museum.\n\nMr. Brian Parkinson, (Opotiki, New Zealand) 1944-, Rabaul, New Guinea, who collected specimens of Terebra parkinsoni Cernohorsky, 1976 and has written a number of shell books (and other books about butterflies, sea birds etc.), is honoured also in Oliva parkinsoni Prior, 1975, a papuinid land mollusc Megalacron parkinsoni Van Goethem 1983 and a rainbowfish Melanotaenia parkinsoni Allen, 1980. Also Scabricola parkinsoni Salisbury & Wolff, 2005 is honouring his name.\n\nLacking information about Parkinson in the bivalve name Solemya parkinsoni Smith, 1874, but possibly a late tribute to James Parkinson (see under Parkenson).\n\nThe bivalve name Teredo parksi P. Bartsch, 1921 is not in honour of the US entomologist and educator Dr. Thaddeus Hedges Parks, (14 Feb. - Ashville, Ohio) 1887-1971 (31 Mar.) or Dr. William Arthur Parks, (11 Dec. - Hamilton) 1868-1936 (3 Oct. - Toronto), Director of the Royal Ontatio Museum, who published a paleontological book in 1933 and initially worked on invertebrate palaeontology, but of Admiral Parks, which must be the chief of the US Bureau of Yards and Docks Rear Admiral Charles Wellman Parks, (22 Mar. - Woburn, Mass.) 1863-1930 (25 June - Washington D.C.), who was an educated civil engineer.\n\nProf. Dr. Paul Woodburn Parmalee, (17 Oct. - Mansfield, Ohio) 1926-2006 (4 July - Knoxville), US zooarcheologist and palaeontologist, former director at the Frank H. McClung Museum at the University of Tennessee [Bellascintilla parmaleeana Coney, 1990]. (Dr. Jefferson Chapman, Director of the McClung Museum, kindly provided the date and birth place).\n\nJuan José Parodiz, (Buenos Aires) 1911-2007 (24 Sep. - Allentown, PA), Argentine malacologist working at the Carnegie Museum, USA from 1951, is honoured in the genus name Parodizia Medina, 1959. He studied palaeontology and malacology at the Instituto Nacional Ciencias Naturales, and while serving in the Argentinian Navy, he took part in several oceanographical expeditions to southern seas and worked for almost 20 years at the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales before going to USA. (André Tromboso, Brazil, kindly provided the information).\n\nThe decapod name Gelastocaris paronae (Nobili, 1905) is likely derived from Prof. Dr. Corrado Parona, (12 June - Corteolona) 1848-1922 (23 Aug.), who was a physician and Prof. of Zoology at the Genova University - he not only worked within zoology (see also A. Perugia), but also described som algae [Calceostoma paronai (Parona & Perugia, 1892), Encotyllabe paronae Monticelli, 1907], cooperating with his brother Dr. Ernesto Parona, 1849-1902, who also was a physician, within parasitology, although the most famous Italian scientist of this name was Prof. Carlo Fabrizio Parona, (8 Mar. - Melegnano) 1855-1939 (15 Jan.), working at the Univ. of Torino, geologist and palaeontologist with special regard to the 2ndary formations of N Italy. (Drs Stefano Palazzi & Maria Angela Stradi kindly provided this information).\n\nDr. Albert Eide Parr, (15 Aug. - Bergen) 1900-1991 (16 July - Wilder, Vermont), Norwegian born US ichthyologist, who had started studying Marine Biology as an assistant to Professor August Brinkmann (q.v.) at the Bergen Museum. Emigrated to the USA, where he in 1926 became an assistant at the New York Aquarium. He continued his research in Marine Biology and in 1927 he became curator of the Bingham (q.v.) collections, in 1938 he was appointed director of the Bingham Oceanographic Foundation (Peabody Museum) at Yale University of the Peabody Museum at Yale University. In 1942 (until 1959) he became director of the American Museum of Natural History, later working as a senior scientist at the museum [Sicyonia parri (Burkenroad, 1934)].\n\nWalter James Parr, 1???-1949, was a well reputed amateur, who published on foraminiferans from Australia and New Zealand between 1930-50 [Parrina Cushman, 1931]. He died in a comparatively young age. An obituary (unseen by this compiler) was published oin 1950 by M.F. Glaessner in Australian Journal of Science 12(6): 211.\n\nLudwig Parreys, 1796-1879, Austrian (Wien) collector and dealer of natural history objects.\n\nEither A. Parriaud , 19??-, or Henri Parriaud, 19??-, booth algal workers, is honoured in the green algal name Cladophora parriaudii van den Hoek. Henri Parriaud published at least between the 1950s and 1990s.\n\nAdmiral Sir William Edward Parry, (19 Dec. - Bath) 1790-1855 (8 or 9 July - Bad Ems), British Arctic Explorer and Hydrograper of the Navy.\n\nLacking information about Parseval in the bryozoan name Parasmittina parsevalii (Audouin, 1826). Not a common name, but Marc-Antione Parseval des Chênes, (27 Apr.) 1755-1836 (16 Aug.), French mathemathician and François-Auguste Parseval-Grandmaison, (7 May) 1759-1834 (7 Dec.), French poet, are a few authors with this name and of these likely the mathematician is the most probable honouree.\n\nLacking information about the malacologist M. Parth, 19??-, in the gastropod name Murexiella parthi R. Houart, 1993.\n\nThe Austrian geologist Paul Maria Partsch, (11 June - Wien) 1791-1856 (3 Oct. - Wien), is honoured in the foraminiferan name Adelosina partschi (d'Orbigny, 1846).\n\nAmur M. Parukhin, (23 Feb.) 1928-1994 (25 May), Russian helminthologist born in Blagoveschchensk (the Amur river region), is honoured in the digenean name Elytrophalloides parukhini Gupta & Gupta, 1997. He studied at the Gorky Univ. at Nizny Novgorod under Prof. A. Sobolev and after that he went to the Far East, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean, where he began to study helminths from marine fishes, which became a life-long work, although he later went to Sevastopol and spent his last 24 years in the Black Sea region (Prof. Jean-Lou Justine, Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, kindly provided a copy of a biographical note in Systematic Parasitology (1996) 34: 77-78).\n\nLacking information about the Indian actinian researcher Dr. Arun H. Parulekar, 19??-, (active with sea anemones during the late 1960s - later with i.a. polychaetes) in the actinian name Synantheopsis parulekari den Hartog J.C. and Vennam J., 1993 and in the octocoral name Sinularia parulekari Alderslade & Shirwalker, 1991.\n\nDermomurex agnesae Vokes, 1995 was named for Mrs Agnes Pas, 19??-. Likely also Dermomurex pasi E. H. Vokes, 1993 was named for the same person or a male person of the same family.\n\nNorman Dale Paschall (24 Apr., Ava, Missouri, U.S.A.), 1924-2003 (28 May - MS), collector and student of marine molluscs. He exchanged widely with other collectors and published many articles in local conchological journals. He was well-known for his huge collection of worldwide Wentletraps, Fam. Epitoniidae. Unfortunately his mollusc collection was completely destroyed by a fire in the nineties. This loss affected him so immensely that it interfered heavily with his speech and memory. A rare Cone species found in Nicaragua: Conus (Leptoconus) paschalli Petuch, 1998, was named after him in appreciation for his assistance in collecting in the Bragman's Bluff area, the type locality of that Cone species. (Curator Henk K. Mienis, Tel Aviv Univ., kindly provided this information).\n\nDr. Adolf A. Pascher, 1881-1945, German microalgae worker during the first decades of the 20th century [Urceolus pascheri Skvortzow, 1924].\n\nThe Italian (Pisa, later Padova) copepod researcher Prof. Pasquale Pasquini, (19 Nov.) 1901-1977 (28 Jan.),who published on such creatures already in 1929 until at least the 1960s, is honoured in the harpacticoid name Psammopsyllus pasquinii Cottarelli, 1969.\n\nLacking information about Pasternak in the cirripedian name Teloscalpellum pasternakae Zevina, 1972, but possibly a tribute to the Russian pennatularian & antipatharian researcher Dr. Fedor Aleksandrovich Pasternak, 19??-, at P.P. Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, Moscow, (the husband of the tanaid researcher Dr. R.K. Kudinova-Pasternak (q.v.) - and their daughter Dr. Anna Pasternak, 19??-, is a plankton specialist at the Shirshov Institute), who began publishing around 1958 - or considering the female ending -ae perhaps more likely a tribute to his wife? (The isopod name Ceratoserolis pasternaki (Kussakin, 1967) must more likely honour him). The Israelic coral symbiont researcher Dr. Zohar Pasternak, 19??-, who also has published on Cirripedia, must be too young to be the candidate.\n\nThe marine gastropod Conus patae Abbott, 1971 was named after Mrs. Patricia (\"Pat\") Nelson Ware, 19??-, who collected part of the type material off Pompano Beach, Broward County, Florida, U.S.A. (Curator Henk K. Mienis, Tel Aviv Univ., kindly provided this information).\n\nMr. Somnuk Patamakanthin, (Damnoen Saduak, Ratchaburi Province) 19??-, Rawai Phuket, is honoured in the Thailandic gastropod names Conus patamakanthini Delsaerdt, 1997 and Surrepifungium patamakanthini A. & E. Gittenberger, 2005. He migrated to the Phuket area and started to collect shells, later establishing the Phuket Sea Shell Museum, an occupation taken over by his son Somwang Patamakanthin, 19??-, who is one of the largest shell collectors in Thailand.\n\nAlexander Patience, (3 Dec. - Inverness) 1865-1954 (1 Jan.) , was a little-known amateur carcinologist (and property valuator) in Glasgow, publishing during the Edwardian era. He was the son of James Patience who became a Clyde river pilot. He worked all his life inGlasgow (in commerce as a house factor and valuator). He was active within the Glasgow Natural History Society and published 24 papers mainly on terrestrial isopods (woodlice) and marine Crustacea in the Clyde. He was friendly with Thomas Scott (q.v.) and Dr. John Nairn Marshall, Sheina Marshall's (q.v.) father. He named the amphipod Isaea elmhirsti Patience,1909 after the then Director of the Marine Station at Millport (Richard Elmhirst (q.v.)). Why his published contributions to crustaceology dried up after about 1910 remains mysterious. Two species of woodlice, Chaetophiloscia patiencei (R.S. Bagnall, 1908) and Miktoniscus patiencei Vandel 1946 are honouring his name. Vandel wrote that he assigned the name patiencei in the honour of the English zoologist who was the first to precisely describe a species of Miktoniscus (in Vandel, A. (1946) Crustacés isopodes terrestres (Oniscoïdea) épigés et cavernicoles du Portugal. Anaïs da Faculdade de Ciências do Porto 30: 135-427). (Prof. Geoff Moore, University Marine Biological Station Millport, who together with Geoff Hancock in 2004 finished an extensive biography of this amateur naturalist, kindly provided all this information, except the last eponym and its reference, which Glyn Collis, Isle of Bute kindly provided).\n\nPatricia : (see also Hutchings or Oxner).\n\nThe diatom name Cocconeiopsis patrickae (Hustedt, 1955) must honour the algae worker Dr. Ruth Myrtle Patrick, (26 Nov. - Topeka, Kansas) 1907-, celebrated by a gala at her 100:th birtday.\n\nDr. Colin Patterson, (13 Oct. - London) 1933-1998 (9 Mar. - London), palaeo-ichthyologist.\n\nProf. Dr. David J (Paddy). Patterson, (19 Apr. - Belfast) 1950-, British-born protistologist, PhD in 1976 (Bristol), D.Sc. in 1990 (Belfast), working with a wide spectrum of organisms from 1992-2004 in Sydney, Australia, efter which he left for Woods Hole. Several species are named for him, but so far perhaps most non marine. However the foraminiferan name Nanosylvanella pattersoni Loeblich Jr. & Tappan, 1994 may perhaps be a tribute to him? {another picture}.\n\nRobert Patterson, (18 Apr. - Belfast) 1802-1872 (14 Feb. - Belfast (died after a fall in his house)) , (with double t), owner of a mill-furnishing business in Belfast and one of the young men, who gathered with Dr. J.L. Drummond (q.v.) to shape the Belfast Natural History Society in 1821, is often mentioned as a collector for British naturalists of that time. He was the grandfather of R. Lloyd Praeger (see Southern). He is remembered in Iophonopsis pattersoni (Bowerbank, 1858), Sarsia pattersoni Haddon, 1886 and he seems to have collected the first specimens of Anomalocera patersoni Robert Templeton, 1838 at the outlet of Larne Lough, Antrim, Ireland and delivered his observations in a letter to the travelling surgeon and naturalist Dr. Robert Templeton, (12 Dec. - Cranmore, Belfast) 1802-1892 (2 June - Edinburgh), a son (2.nd of 5 siblings, having 4 sisters) of the well-known close friend of Joseph Banks, John Templeton, 1766-1825, who all his life was active as a naturalist at his estate a couple of kilometers from Belfast, e.g. making drawings of Irish cryptogams. According to Hopkinson 1913, Robert Templeton wrote an article in 1834 in Mag. Nat. Hist. (1) VII, pp. 129-131, using the pseudonym \"C. M.\" - and he continued to publish (but usually using his own name) at least until 1858 (2 years before he retired in January 1860). Robert T. achieved his MD in Edinburgh in 1831 and joined the army as a surgeon between 1833-60, became widely travelled, e.g. staying at Sri Lanka between 1839-48, and produced a steady stream of natural history papers dealing with decapods, copepods, molluscs and insects. Possibly also Salenia pattersoni A. Agassiz, 1878, is named after Robert Patterson.\n\nChoriplax pattisoni Ashby, 1921 was named for George Pattison, 18??-19??, lighthouse keeper at Cape Banks, South Australia.\n\nLacking information about Paul in the digenean name Metadena pauli (Vlassenko, 1931).\n\nWho is Paul in the copepod name Phyllopodopsyllus pauli Crisafi, 1959? Possibly another harpacticoid, Oniscopsis pauliani Chappuis, 1954 may be connected with the same person? One possible candidate may of course be Paul Illg (q.v.).\n\nThe Caribbean mollusca name Volvarina pauli de Jong & Coomans, 1988 is in honour of Paul de Jong, 19??-, son of the first author.\n\nPaul in some gastropod names : (see Bartsch).\n\nMr. Edward D.

Vance, 19??-, [the elasipod Ophnurgus dorisae Pawson, 2002] (and they now seem to be a married couple, sharing the family name Pawson) [Pawsonia Rowe, 1970].\n\nProf. Dr. Ferdinand Albert Pax, (30 Dec. - Breslau) 1885-1964 (11 Sep. - Bad Honnef), zoologist in Köln-Klettenberg, who in 1962 published his well-known book \"Meeresprodukte, ein Handwörterbuch der marinen Rohstoffe\". Pax had specialized in anthozoans after visits to the zoological stations in Trieste in 1906 (under Cori) and Bergen in 1907 (under Appelöf). [Parastephanauge paxi Dufaure, 1959]. He was a friend of W. Arndt (q.v.) and published some works together with him. His father was the botanist Ferdinand Albin Pax, (26 July - Köninginhof) 1858-1942 (1 Mar. - Breslau).\n\nJulius (Ritter von) Payer, (2 Sep. - Teplitz-Schönau) 1841-1915 (29 Aug. - Veldes (now Bled, Slovenia)), Austrian polar researcher and naval officer, who took part in the 2:nd German polar expedition with Koldewey 1869-70 and the Austrian/Hungarian expeditions with Weyprecht (see him) in 1871 and 1872-74, after which he became an artist, painting and drawing motives from the Arctic [Bythocaris payeri (Heller, 1875)].\n\nBaron Gustaf von Paykull (Paijkull), (21 Aug. - Stockholm) 1757-1826 (28 Aug. - Wallox-Säby (his estate in Uppland), Swedish poet and amateur collector and writer of insects. He donated his very huge natural history collection to the Swedish Academy of Science. (He had sent collectors to different parts of the world to enlarge his collections). This became the first collection in the Swedish Musium of Natural History, when it was founded and Paykull was knighted (baron) because of this. According to certain sources, he was a somewhat dubious person who did not hesitate to cheat and had cleptomanic inclinations.\n\nBenjamin Charles Marie Payraudeau, (22 Mar. - logis de la Grande Forêt à La Réorthe) 1798-1865 (12 Jan.), disciple of Lamarck (q.v.) at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. He published on molluscs and birds in 1826 [Mangelia payraudeaui Deshayes, 1835]. His brother, the physician Dr. Auguste François Lous Liberté Payraudeau, (12 Sep. - St-Jean-de-Beugné) 1795-1868 (11 Oct. - St-Mars de La Chaize-le-Vicomte), was also interested in natural history.\n\nThe gastropod names Paziella Crosse, 1869 pazi Crosse, 1869, Poirieria pazi H. Crosse, 1869 and the bivalve name Nemocardium pazianum (Dall, 1916) .may possibly honour the Madrid museum researcher Patricio Maria Paz y Membiela, (17 Mar. - El Ferrol) 1808-1874 (11 Jan. - Madrid), .\n\nCharles William Peach, (30 Sep. - Wansford, Northamtonshire) 1800-1886 (28 Feb. - Edinburgh), son of a saddler and harness-maker, who soon gave up this professon, becoming an inn-owner and farmer. Charles, beeing fond of books, went to school until 15 years old, when he had to assist his father in the inn and at the farm, but was often scolded for attending to books rather then the plough. When 23 years old, he was appointed as a riding officer in the coast-guard at Weybourn, in the port of Clay, Norfolk. In 1845 he moved to Cornwall and in 1849 to Peterhead, a town north of Aberdeen and then to Wick further north. He was a diligent collector of marine invertebrates for researchers, af first for Dr. Johnston (q.v.). He also himself published some articles - despite (at least initially) indigence, a family with 9 children to support and educate at an income of 4 shillings per day (in 1844). (One of his children, Benjamin Neeve Peach, 1842-1926, became a well known geologist). Participated during the 1860s in Jeffreys' collecting expeditions as a specialist on sessile fauna. (He retired from the coast-guard in 1861). Actually, as Peach had grown up in the inland, not having seen the sea until leaving his fathers house, he became fascinated of the sea when first confronted with it. He tells himself about how a most splendid specimen of Nemertesia antennina (Lamarck, 1816) found at the chimneypiece of an inn, where he stayed when going to his first job outside his family, excited his curiosity so much, so he had to find out what it was and after this his interest in marine life was awaked. He began collecting for the beauty, but in 1825, when meeting the Rev J. Layton, then at Chatfield, he became inspired also to collect all information he could find about the natural objects he came across, but not until 1841 at a meeting of the British Association at Plymouth, where he read a paper on Organic Fossils of Cornwall, he began reading or publishing papers [Peachia Gosse, 1855, Tricellaria peachi (Busk, 1851), Hymedesmia peachi Bowerbank, 1882].\n\nTitian R. Peale : (see Dana). He should not be confused with his father, Charles Willson Peale, (15 Apr. - Chester, Maryland) 1741-1827 (22 Feb.), the portrait painter from Maryland, who at his own expences built the Philadelphia Museum, which started in 1786. Dr. D. Damkaer (in litt.) wrote that C.W. Peale's whole family was talented and that C.W. Peale named most all his sons after painters, except two, who were named for other celebrities. They were Raphaelle (the oldest), Rembrandt, Rubens, Charles Linnaeus, Franklin (for Benjamin Fr.), and (the youngest) Titian Ramsay. A couple of these made their name as artists. The father is best known now for his great portraits of the Founding Fathers of USA, G. Washington, Thomas Jefferson, etc [Loligo pealeii Lesueur, 1821].\n\nProf. Em. Dr. William (Bill) Gordon Pearcy, around 1929-, PhD at Yale in 1960, born in a suburb of Chicago, Oregon State Univ., is honoured in the Mysida name Boreomysis pearcyi Murano & Krygier, 1985. He has mainly worked on fish and retired in 1998. Together with Dr. Peter C. Rothlisberg, 1945-, Cleveland, Australia he also developed and in 1976 published on the Rothlisberg-Pearcy (RP) Epibenthic Sledge, a good device for collecting fish larvae and other more or less hyperbenthic animals. Rothlisberg is honoured in the names Spirorbis rothlisbergi Knight-Jones, 1978 and Brachycalanus rothlisbergi Othman & Greenwood, 1988.\n\nProf. Dr. Arthur Sperry Pearse, (15 Mar.) 1877-1956 (13 Dec.), US zoologist, who obtained his PhD at Harvard. Was for most of his life Professor of Zoology at Duke University, in North Carolina. Specialized in parasitic copepods, leaving about 25 publications between 1904 and 1952. Also authored general works on zoology. See his autobiography (1952) \"Trying to be a Zoologist.\" Copepods named for him are Diaptomus pearsei Wright, 1927 and Paralebion pearsei Causey, 1953. [Phonorhynchus pearsei Ferguson, Strewalt & Kepner, 1940, Typhlatya pearsei Creaser, 1936]. (Dr. D. Damkaer kindly provided this information). A later namesake is Prof. Em. John Pearse, 1936-, Biology Department at University of California, Santa Cruz, who formally retired in 1994, has after that been working on invertebrates together with his wife Dr. Vicki Buchsbaum Pearse, 1942-, [Anthosactis pearseae Daly & Gusmao, 2007 - a whale carcass sea anemone] and her father Dr. Ralph Morris Buchsbaum, (2 Jan. - Chickasha, Indian Territory) 1907-2002 (11 Feb. - Pacific Grove, California), PhD at Univ. of Chicago in 1932, continuing at this university until 1950, when he moved to Univ. of Pittsburgh, but retired in 1972, moving to Pacific Grove, well-known for several invertebrate books, some of them together with his wife Mildred Shaffer Buchsbaum, (25 Apr. - Chicago) 1912-1996 (16 Jan. - Pacific Grove), and his sister Elizabeth Buchsbaum Newhall, 1909-1942, who helped with the illustrations.\n\nThe digenean specialist, Prof. Dr. John Cawardine Pearson, (Toronto, Canada) 1927-, is honoured in the flatworm name Pearsonellum Overstreet & Køie, 1989. PhD in 1954. Two years later he moved to Brisbane, Australia, where he he has stayed. He retired in August 1992. (Prof. Jean-Lou Justine, Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, kindly provided a copy of a biographical note from Systematic Parasitology (1994)) 27: 237-238).\n\nThe holothurian name Pearsonothuria Levin, in Levin, Kalinin & Stonik, 1984 is in honour of Prof. Karl Pearson, (27 Mar. - Islington, London) 1857-1936 (27 Apr. - Coldharbour, Surrey), British mathemathician, who had spent some study time in Germany and there got the spelling of his first name changed from Carl to Karl, established the discipline of mathematical statistics and became a protegé and later the biograper of Francis Galton, Darwin's cousin.\n\nThe gastropod name Cymatium (Septa) peasei Beu, 1986. may possibly honour the American malacologist William Harper Pease, (Brooklyn, New York) 1824-1871, who in 1849 moved to Honolulu, from where he continued to work [Favartia peasei (Tryon, 1880), Conus peasei J.

(Andrew Vik, Tampa, Florida kindly provided this information).\n\nThe West African polyplacophoran name Ischnochiton peasleri J. Thiele, 1910, seem to be a wrongly spelled variant of I. paessleri Thiele, 1910, and if so, likely a tribute to captain Richard Paessler (q.v.).\n\nJean Péchaud, (31 Oct. - Chavagnac (Cantal)) 1823-1886 (9 July - Saint-Saulge (Nièvre)), French Malacologist.\n\nAbout the sponge name Hymenancora pecqueryi (Topsent, 1892)the athour told: \"Je dédie cette espèce à mon excellent ami\" M.
