        "text": "Podgorica, city, administrative centre of Montenegro. It is situated in southern Montenegro near the confluence of the Ribnica and Morača rivers.\n\nThe first recorded settlement was Birziminium, a caravan stop in Roman times, though it probably was an Illyrian tribal centre earlier. As a feudal state capital in the early Middle Ages, it was known as Ribnica; it was called Podgorica from 1326. It fell to the Turks in 1474 but was restored to Montenegro in 1878. In 1916 it was occupied by the Austrians, in 1941 by the Italians, and in 1943 by the Germans. Only the Turkish clock tower (late 18th century), a mosque, and several houses survived the destruction of the old city in World War II. The city’s bloody history is portrayed through a large number of war memorials. In the postwar communist period the city was known as Titograd in honour of Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. After the collapse of communism, the city revived its old name, Podgorica, in 1992. Podgorica has several cultural and educational institutions, including the University of Montenegro (1974). Manufactures are mainly consumer items; in 1972 an aluminum works began exploiting rich bauxite deposits nearby. Pop. (2011) 150,977."
