        "text": "Climate\n\nThe climate of Podgorica is affected by the Adriatic Sea, via the valley of the River Bojana and across Lake Skadar. Under the impact of the surrounding mountains, Mediterranean climate is changing in such way that Podgorica has a modified Mediterranean climate, characterized by warm and hot summers, and mild and rainy winters. Due to thermal impact of the Adriatic Sea, Podgorica has a high air temperature during the winter.\n\n- The average annual air temperature in Podgorica is 16.4° C, with a maximum of 40.7° C, and a minimum of −4.6° C.\n\n- The average annual rainfall in Podgorica is 1,544 mm, and its relative humidity is 59.6%.\n\n- The average number of rainy days is 118, there are three snowy days, and 58 days with strong winds.\n\nSummers in Podgorica are extremely hot and long. There are around 135 summer days, in which the air temperature reaches or exceeds 25° C. Plenty of sun and warmth, a relatively small number of days with precipitation, sufficient relative humidity and good ventilation constitute the basic climate characteristics and categorise Podgorica as an area with a pleasant climate.\n\nHistory\n\nThe City of Podgorica is located at the intersections of several major roads, which run along the basins of the Rivers Zeta, Morača, and Cijevna, into the valley of Lake Skadar and near the Adriatic Sea, in a fertile plain with favourable climate conditions. This area has always been very suitable for the establishment of human settlements since ancient times, and thus settlements existed here even in prehistoric times. The oldest remains of material culture in this area belong to the late Stone Age. Further development have enabled the appearance of organised human settlements that will survive numerous events.\n\nIn the Illyrian period, in the area of the Zeta-Bjelopavlići valley there lived members of two Illyrian tribes – the Labeati and Docleati, which influenced in the most direct way the establishment of the tribes of that time. The Labeati inhabited the area from Shkodra in Albania to today’s Podgorica. They had their own fortress Meteon, known today as Medun, and a developed organisation of life, in particular their military. The Docleati also inhabited the Zeta Valley, and experienced fast economic growth due to the fertile plain and favourable position in terms of geography and roads. Their main settlement was Doclea. The city was situated around three kilometres northwest of today’s Podgorica. Urban Doclea was adjusted to the configuration of the terrain. For that time, it was a big city with a population of 8–10,000, with all their basic communal issues resolved. The relatively dense population density in an area no more than 10 square kilometres was conditioned by its geographical position, favourable climate, economic conditions, and defensive positions, especially important at that time.\n\nRead more..."
