        "text": "Initially known as the “Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes” and later as the “Kingdom of Yugoslavia”, the country was partitioned into different states by the Axis powers during World War II. After the post-war ascendance of a Communist regime in 1946, Yugoslavia became a state of federated republics. Under Communist rule, Yugoslavia consisted of six Socialist Republics: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, and Macedonia. In 1991-1992, four of these republics -- Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia -- broke away from Yugoslavia and became independent countries, while two -- Serbia and Montenegro -- continued to form a rump republic of Yugoslavia. In 2003, this rump republic was renamed Serbia and Montenegro and, in 2006, it dissolved as Serbia and Montenegro assumed the status of separate, sovereign countries. In 2008, the republic of Kosovo, which had previously been an autonomous region within Serbia, declared independence from Serbia, a declaration that has not received unanimous recognition from the international community. In February 2019, the Republic of Macedonia changed its name to the Republic of North Macedonia. Taken collectively, the independent countries that formerly formed part of Yugoslavia are known as the Former Yugoslav republics.\n\nThis chapter (1) lists the access points for Yugoslavia, its predecessors, and successors; (2) discusses the application of subject headings for these countries; and (3) concludes with a listing of Country and Country of Publication codes for them in the MARC format. The order in which the access points are listed and discussed begins with a chronological listing of access points referring to the Yugoslavian territory as a whole (1.A) and continues with an alphabetical listing of the access points for the states that preceded the formation of Yugoslavia and the independent republics that emerged from it (1.B). Note that in subsection 1.B, headings referring to a particular region at different periods are listed in chronological order: this chronological sub-arrangement departs, at certain points, from alphabetical order.\n\n1.

The subdivision form is --Slovenia.\n\n2. The use of subject headings for Yugoslavia and its successor states\n\nThe Subject Headings ManualH1055 provides the following instructions for assigning subject headings pertaining to Yugoslavia and its successor states:\n\n1. Assign the heading Yugoslavia, with appropriate topical and period subdivisions, to works on the country of Yugoslavia during the period 1918-1992 as well as to works on the country of Serbia and Montenegro during the period 1992-2003 when it was called Yugoslavia.\n\n2. Assign the heading Serbia and Montenegro to works on this country from the time its name changed in 2003 until 2006, when it split into two separate, independent countries.\n\n3. Treat Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo (Republic), North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia as fully independent countries. As geographic subdivisions, use these headings directly after topics, even for works covering the time period when they were republics of Yugoslavia. For example, a work on Yugoslav-era city planning in Skopje would have the subject string City planning--North Macedonia--Skopje--History--20th century; “Yugoslavia” does not appear.\n\n4. Assign the heading Former Yugoslav republics, with appropriate topical subdivisions, to works discussing collectively the independent countries that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991-1992 and 2006, or to works discussing the equivalent area. When using geographic subdivisions, do not divide localities through Former Yugoslav republics. Divide only through the name of the current country or, in the case of areas that span more than one country, assign the heading directly after topics.\n\n3. Codes for Yugoslavia and its successor states\n\nIn applying the geographical area code in the MARC 043 field, catalogers should, as a rule, enter the code e-yu--- only for resources whose subject involves Yugoslavia or the set of former Yugoslav republics as a whole. Otherwise, they should assign the code for the individual country/region which the resource being cataloged treats; these are listed in the table below."
