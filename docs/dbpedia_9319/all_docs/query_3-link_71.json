        "text": "Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, sits at the confluence of two rivers, the Ribnica and the Moraca. Inhabited since the Stone Age, Montenegro's cultural and economic epicenter has been ruled not just by the Montenegrins but also by the Ottomans and the Serbs, the latter of whom named the city Titograd. Today's Podgorica is largely made up of historic buildings from the Ottoman era and urban sprawl from the Yugoslav postwar era. Visit and discover the Dajbabe Monastery, Lake Skadar, Adzi-Pasa Bridge, Ribnica and Moraca Rivers, Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Independence Square, Natural History Museum of Montenegro, and so much more.\n\nMontenegro is an up-and-coming Adriatic beach destination, boasting over 180 miles of coastline. Perhaps overlooked in favor of countries like Croatia, Montenegro has a lot to offer the jetsetting traveler, and the Montenegrins are proud of their 120 beaches and beachside resort towns such. (Fun fact: The beach in Ulcinj stretches on for nearly 20 uninterrupted miles. Visit and discover a lot of Bars, Becici, Budva, Petrovac, Sveti Stefan, Ulcinj, Jaz Beach, and so much more.\n\nPodgorica, the capital of Montenegro, sits at the confluence of two rivers, the Ribnica and the Moraca.
