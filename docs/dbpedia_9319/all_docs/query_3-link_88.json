        "text": "If you’re looking for a cheap city break in Europe, consider visiting Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro. It offers affordable prices compared to other European capitals like Paris or Rome. You can enjoy meals at casual restaurants for as little as €6.40, and a three-course meal for two in a mid-range restaurant costs around €25. Refreshments such as beer, cappuccino, and bottled water are also reasonably priced. Transportation is affordable, with one-way tickets starting at €0.90 and a monthly pass costing just €30. Podgorica is 38.8% cheaper than Rome and 47.9% cheaper than Paris, according to Numbeo.\n\nIn Podgorica, you can explore the old town of Stara Varoš, which has a charming atmosphere with low stone houses and overgrown lanes. This area was the center of a vibrant Ottoman Turkish town from the 15th to 19th centuries, and remnants of its golden era can still be seen. The old town features landmarks like the Starodoganjska Mosque and the Osmanagić Mosque, showcasing Ottoman architecture. Along the Ribnica River, you can walk along a secluded pathway with remnants of ancient fortifications and visit the Roman-built Adži-Paša’s Bridge.\n\nPodgorica also has impressive brutalist architecture, with structures like the Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus and the Blok 5 housing estate, which resemble giant Jenga towers. The city offers a vibrant café scene with establishments like Zrno and Mehanizam, known for their chic and unique atmospheres. Karver, a bookstore, café, and gallery housed in a former Turkish bathhouse, is worth a visit. For summer drinks, you can head to Njegošev Park near the Millenium Bridge, where a small beach with an outdoor bar awaits. In the evenings, explore Bokeška Street, known for its colorful cocktail bars and unique pubs."
