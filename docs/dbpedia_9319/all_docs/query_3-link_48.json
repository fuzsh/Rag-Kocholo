        "text": "I find it hard to resist the allure of a capital city.\n\nA capital city represents a safe bet for a city break. They’re usually the administrative and economic hubs of a country or state, attracting politicians, businessmen, visitors and tourists.\n\nThis means that there will be no shortage of infrastructure, restaurants, cafés, bars, museums, interesting architecture, places of worship and attractions.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nI’d been toying for a while with the idea of going travelling in Southeast Europe for some time. One of the continent’s lesser-travelled realms, it still contained a good portion of European nations that I was yet to visit, but the logistics weren’t easy.\n\nMacedonia, Kosovo, Albania and Montenegro were all on the hit list, and their close proximity made them eligible for a four-county travel trail.\n\nI’d also thought about breaking that down into two or more trips. Kosovo is reachable from Macedonia, and there are direct flights on budget carriers from the UK to three of the four nations.\n\nOne of those routes is London Stanstead to Podgorica, the capital city of Montenegro.\n\nMontenegro is an interesting country, tucked in between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania on the Adriatic coast. Its coastline is incredible, stunning even. A testament to Mother Nature and the beautiful ruggedness of her child. It is where cascading mountains meet elegant Mediterranean sea and a host of charming port towns and villages await the yearly influx of tourists.\n\nBut Podgorica, in reletive terms, isn’t near the coast. It’s over an hour away by road and seems as though it’s in a different country altogether.\n\nIn retrospect, I’m glad I never commissioned a two or three night break in Podgorica.\n\nDoing it as part of a package where we would go from Luton to Skopje, to Pristina, then Tirana before reaching the Montenegrin heartland was a wise choice, in a roundabout way.\n\nAfter little research concerning the place itself and more emphasis put on travel time between destinations, I decided a two-night layover en route from Albania to Tivat would be a good idea. A chance to split a five-and-a-half-hour journey in two.\n\nIt was a safe bet. Podgorica, as the capital city of a European nation, would have plenty going on. Certainly enough to fill two days of activity, and act as a worthwhile buffer between two other places. If it’s on Ryanair’s route map, there must be something going on.\n\nOh, what a bout of misjudgement.\n\nWe’d left Tirana in the morning and were scheduled to reach Podgorica by the afternoon. As we got closer to the city, what was countryside or wasteland didn’t seem to be disappearing, nor was there a cosmopolitan marker of skyscrapers and structures in the distance.\n\nAfter pulling into the bus station, I made the assumption that we were away from the core of Podgorica, and we were. Unfortunately, I’d booked the hotel in proximity to where we disembarked, as opposed to the city centre itself.\n\nAt that point it seemed more of a plus than a minus.\n\nWe checked into the hotel and headed straight out. There was no point in hanging around as we only had a day and a half there, and the intention was to make the most of it.\n\nSo we went out and got our walking boots on, as we were staying about twenty minutes away from downtown. A helping of Balkan speciality ćevapi preceded the first item on the itinerary: Podgorica Old Town.\n\nNow I’ve been to many old towns in many different cities all over Europe.\n\nI’ve explored their wonderful streets, stood in awe at their amazing architecture, had drinks in quaint cafes and bars, and dined with true tradition.\n\nSo I’d be forgiven at scoffing at an old town which comprised of the backs of some houses and the driveways of others, in addition to a small mosque. I felt more like I’d wandered down some back alley as opposed to an area of great culture and history.\n\nBut I’m more optimistic than that and felt that there was more to Podgorica than just the dust-covered tracks of an underwhelming old town.\n\nI was determined to look past this black mark, and so we soldiered on.\n\nWe continued in the direction which we entered the old town and headed out towards the Moraca river, crossing a long bridge which spanned its breadth.\n\nIt looked as though at one point it was a place of fun and good times, but its state of disrepair looked straight-up abandoned fairground creepy.\n\nLittle did I know at that point that the waterpark was the perfect euphemism for the rest of this city.\n\nI had a few other points of interest scheduled, so we headed to the next destination, and Podgorica’s crowning glory: the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ.\n\nWhat was a nice looking church was incredible inside. The ceilings and walls were covered in biblical collage, and the obnoxious golden-yellow background made everything pop.\n\nBut it wasn’t quite enough to salvage the drab affair unfolding in front of us.\n\nWe’d been out for a couple of hours, yet we still hadn’t even seen the very centre of Podgorica. I find value in everywhere I go, but here I was struggling.\n\nWe’d been out for so long, yet not even ventured to the main drag. That wasn’t due to a plethora of other activity on the outskirts. Our encounters so far had mainly been with graffiti, potholes and garbage bins.\n\nAs we sat down I connected to the Wi-Fi and began searching. The lifelessness and bland outlook that I perceived Podgorica to have had been picked up by many other people.\n\nA lack of art, interesting museums, attractions, restaurants and other things to do seemed to be problems people had with their visits to this part of Montenegro. My own findings backed these notions up.\n\nAfter the first day came to a close, I surmised that the two best things to do here were a cathedral and a bridge. That may pass in a place like Vatican City, but here it just contributed to a depressing profile.\n\nThe strange thing is that it has potential. By virtue of being a capital city, Podgorica has the platform to become a destination that people want to visit.\n\nPodgorica Airport shouldn’t just be a gateway for Tivat and Kotor. In my opinion, local officials should look to cash in on the opportunity that welcoming customers from a variety of major European airlines presents, especially in the colder months when the seaside becomes a limited option.\n\nSo can’t Podgorica be THE destination?\n\nWell, it can. But from what I saw, there’s a long way to go until that becomes a reality. I was fortunate enough that our visit was a simple buffer between Tirana and Tivat. I wasn’t expecting much, but I feel for those who make dedicated trips to Podgorica because they’ve seen cheap flights to a country they haven’t visited before, and so decided to go for it.\n\nWe eventually departed for the next stop at four in the morning. We arrived back at the bus station to be greeted by a number of homeless people. They were flat out across seats and fast asleep. Sure, it was shelter for them, but they probably couldn’t bring themselves to take refuge on those Podgorica streets. And who could blame them?\n\nPIN ME!"
