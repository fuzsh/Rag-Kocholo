        "text": "Podgorica has always been at the historical and cultural crossroad of Europe. It is here where many nations, cultures and roads have met. Old and new, traditional and modern, Podgorica offers its charm to all visitors.\n\nPodgorica boasts beautiful, unspoiled scenery, cultural heritage from ancient times to the present, as well as modern buildings and monuments. It is a conveniently situated town, close to several European main centers. There are few towns in this world which are only an hour drive from both the closest sea and mountain resorts. Mild, almost Mediterranean climate, makes Podgorica one of the warmest towns in Europe.\n\nPodgorica is the hub of all main roads in Montenegro. Along with the hospitality of the people, safety is something that is meant when you come to the capital of Montenegro.\n\nPodgorica has an excellent geographical location, with good road and air connections. The city is about 40 km as the crow flies from the Adriatic Sea, and 60 km by road. It is also only 19 km from fascinating Lake Skadar. It is situated at a distance of 12 km from Podgorica Airport, 81 km from Tivat Airport, and 153 km from Cilipi in Dubrovnik (Croatia).\n\nIn Cetinje, discover the story of Montenegrin history through the riches of historic edifices and museums in the “Valley of Gods”. Take time to enjoy the labyrinth of roads the aristocrats of Europe showed off on too!\n\nVisit and experience life in the castle of the King Nikola Petrović, where the princes forged maiden dreams about the future. Under the centennial lime trees, see how the moon “pours magical rays, stirring secret feelings” in the legacy of the spiritual ruler, great thinker and poet Petar II Petrović Njegoš. Take a look at the first billiards in his Biljarda, which was brought from Kotor by Montenegrin youths on their shoulders. This will just scratch the surface of the castle, as every wing holds its own secret treasures.\n\nNearby, there are three great relics in the town at the foot of Lovćen: the icon of Our Lady of Philermos, the hand of Saint John the Baptist and the particle from the Holy Cross. See a living theatre in the streets as you follow a new creative trail at the town’s traditional foundations created by academy students, actors, painters, musicians. Cetinje is a town with the hint of enchantment, rumours of past encompassing everything, and warm households. Don’t hesitate to taste cheese and prosciutto from the village of Njeguši. The best taste from Montenegro is the smoked meat dried at the crossroads of mountain and sea air."
