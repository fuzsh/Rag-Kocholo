Most of the blocks of flats were built this way in addition to public buildings such as Television and Radio Building, Scientific Centre of Montenegro, institutions (consisting of the university) and Morača Sports Centre. The most impressive is the building blocks of Blok 5 and Blok 6.\n\nAfter visiting Blok 5 and seeing the buildings, you can walk in Boulevard of George Washington and do some shopping in the best boutiques of Podgorica, up to St. Peter Statue and wonderful little park in front of the Rectorate of the University of Montenegro.\n\nThe most impressive of Podgorica's sculptures is the huge (almost 7m tall) bronze statue dedicated to the Metropolitan and ruler of Montenegro Petar I Petrovic Njegos.\n\n12.

Ravaged by the Goths in the late V century, and also struck by the earthquake thirty years later, Duklja, as opposed to Medun did not grow into a medieval, but to a modern settlement of this era. As a settlement of the Illyrian tribe Dokleati, and later Roman, it grew into the most sophisticated community of existing Montenegro.\n\nThe sculptures and remainings testify the rich culture of this ancient roman town. You will be able to see the ruins of town forum with Basilica, temples of Diana and Roma, urban villas, ramparts, gates, bridges, bath house.

The inspiration for this unique architectural monument was the St. Tryphon cathedral in Kotor.\n\nConstruction of the temple began in 1993 and lasted 20 years. The temple is dominated by two towers, which are 26.7 meters high with a total of 17 bells. The biggest one of all the bells weighs 11 tons and is the largest bell in the Balkans.
