It represents the main demographic, political, economic, traffic, cultural-educational and scientific centre of the state. In Podgorica there are 190000 inhabitants which is almost one third of the total population of Montenegro.\n\nPodgorica is a city whose development began in the fifties of the last century. Now it is a modern city with lots of greenery. Podgorica is situated on the banks of several rivers. So there are many bridges.\n\nAll the major traffic flows in Montenegro pass through Podgorica, with the exception of maritime transport.\n\nThe plans are being developed related to the transport infrastructure including two future highways, Bar-Boljare-Belgrade and Adriatic - Ionian highway. Both highways passing through the territory of Podgorica.

City has prepared a Study of long-term development of urban and suburban transport. Priority was given to public mass transport which is performed by buses."
