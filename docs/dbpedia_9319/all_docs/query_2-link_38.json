        "text": "How would you describe Montenegro?\n\nThis young European country is a land of sunshine. There is a saying often being used by all Montenegrins, \"Nidje nebo nije plavo kao iznad Crne Gore.\" And the translation goes: In no country is the sky so blue as in Montenegro. You can easily guess it – We take pride in our country and we absolutely love it!\n\nSet on a beautiful Mediterranean sea, crossed by pure rivers and marked by deep and transparent lakes, creased by deep canyons and vast valleys, relic caves, virgin forests, medieval villages and towns, ancient cities, age-worn churches, Montenegro has it all.\n\nImagine a country where it takes you one hour from the capital, Podgorica, where we are located, to get to the mountains with an altitude of 950 m, a half an hour to the biggest lake in Balkans, and one hour to get to the long sandy beaches with turquoise waters.\n\nWhat is the most picturesque place along the Montenegrin coast?\n\nIt`s very difficult to pick one. However, the biggest impression, the most striking feature of the coast of Montenegro, according to our guests is the Bay of Kotor. The Bay of Kotor is often considered to be \"Europe's Southernmost Fjord,\" even though it has nothing to do with fiords, except its appearance.\n\nDid you know? This magnificent bay is in fact a submerged (flooded) river canyon which was flooded by the sea and the Bokelj River, which ran from the heights of Mount Orjen, and now lies submerged along the ocean depths.\n\nThe Bay of Kotor is surrounded by mountains up to 1,000 m (3,281 ft), which are almost vertically immersed in the sea. The photos do not do justice to the Bay of Kotor, you have to see it with your own eyes!\n\nA short history of Montenegro?\n\nThe name Montenegro began to be used in the 15th century, when the Crnojevic dynasty began its rule in Zeta (formerly Montenegro). At the end of the 15th century, Zeta became more known as Montenegro. It was succeeded by theocratic Montenegro and the Ottoman rule. Yet, over the centuries, Montenegro has managed to maintain its independence from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nFrom 16th to 19th century, Montenegro became the theocracy ruled by rulers and princes. The Berlin Congress in 1878. has officially recognized the independence of de facto sovereign states of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania, as the 27th, 28th, and 29th free countries of the world.\n\nAfter the First World War, Montenegro joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. At the end of the Second World War it became the constitutive republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the fall of this country in 1992, Montenegro united with Serbia, first in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and later in 2003, in the loose community of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nWhen did Montenegro become independent?\n\nIn May 21 2006, Montenegro called for its right provided for by the Serbian and Montenegrin Constitutional Charter to hold a referendum on independence from the state union. Voices for the end of the community with Serbia exceeded 55% - the census that the EU defined - which allowed Montenegro to formally declare independence on June 3, 2006. From 2006, Montenegro is an independent country.\n\nGo now before everyone else does.\n\nHolidays in Montenegro FAQ\n\nDo I need a travel visa for my trip to Montenegro?\n\nVisa entry requirements differ from country to country, and are dependent on your nationality.\n\nWe will happily check with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to see if you need a visa or not, however, obtaining a visa for your travel is your responsibility, and the cost of a travel visa is not included in the price of your trip.\n\nPlease contact us if you require any supporting documentation or information in obtaining your visa.

We will specify everything upon your booking.\n\nIs airfare included in the trip price?\n\nFlights (international) are not included in the tour prices, however, we can help you with booking the flights as well.\n\nWhat are the departure dates for the tours on the website?\n\nThere are no set departure dates for our tours because every tour is private, which means you can depart on whatever day you wish. With very rare exception, every single trip on our website can depart on any day from May to October.\n\nAre these group tours?\n\nWe do not sell group tours. When we say our tours are private, that is exactly what we mean: the only travelers on your trip are you and the companions with whom you choose to travel. In case you choose our already crafted tours, the itinerary doesn’t have to be fixed, and no list of sights must be seen in a given day. You could alter a tour by telling us what exactly you want from your day. Touring is flexible and can be modified each day to suit your interests or energy level.\n\nCan the tours on your website be altered?\n\nOur already crafted tours are intended to serve as a \"starting point\" for the trip you ultimately end up taking. These suggested itineraries are based on our own expertise and experience. While it's fine to decide to take a trip exactly as it appears on our website, most of our clients prefer to work with us to create an itinerary that meets their schedule, interests, and budget.\n\nDo I need travel insurance for my trip?\n\nYes. It is mandatory for all passengers travelling with us to purchase a comprehensive travel insurance policy, and we will be requesting your policy number prior to departure. If you do not have a policy number upon embarking on your tour, we have the right to remove you from the trip. At a minimum, your policy must cover medical costs in case of hospitalization, and emergency travel repatriation.\n\nIs Caeli right for me?\n\nCaeli welcomes all travelers, but not tourists, with the majority of our travelers falling within the age range of 25+.\n\nOur tours are private.\n\nOur tours are tailor made, unless you book one of our amazing tours\n\nWe are LGBTQ friendly.\n\nWe encourage solo travelers; you will make long-lasting friendships on our tours.\n\nWe thrive on a mix of activities that get us into nature, immerse you into the local culture, teach you about the lifestyle of Montenegrins, help you have incredible adventures, or just allow you to lay on the beach with a mojito in one hand.\n\nWe love trying local food.\n\nWe love meeting local people.\n\nWe support local businesses.\n\nWe aim to leave green footprints in Montenegro.\n\nOur clients are those who are looking to get safely off the beaten path.\n\nMontenegro is maybe not (yet) the no. 1 top tourist destination in Europe, but if you choose to visit it once, there is no question that you will fall in love in this gorgeous country and friendly Montenegrin people. Holidays in Montenegro are full of wonders to be discovered.\n\nThere is so much to see and explore in Montenegro that every time you visit this wonderful country you will discover something new – a hidden gem which can be observed only while walking the streets of Montenegrin towns, hiking the majestic mountains or swimming in clear Adriatic sea waters. So if you are planning your first trip to this destination, check out the our private tours in Montenegro. You will learn everything important, have fun and enjoy this country's way of life."
