        "text": "With its majestic mountains, national parks playing host to a range of wildlife, a stretch of coastline on the Adriatic Sea, and fascinating history to explore within its churches, medieval villages and fortified towns, the miniscule but mighty Montenegro has been attracting more visitors than ever in recent years. But while the stunning Bay of Kotor, mountainous Durmitor National Park, Monaco-like Tivat or beachside Budva may have taken the spotlight, the capital city of Podgorica is not a place that should be overlooked when planning a trip to this diverse Balkan country.\n\nRead on to find out how you can enjoy the best of Podgorica, Montenegro’s captivating capital city.\n\nWhat to do in and around Podgorica\n\nAs you explore the nation’s modern capital, you’ll find glimpses of its storied past in Stara Varos its Ottoman-era old town, which holds the centuries-old Clock Tower – the most famous landmark in Podgorica, alongside the more modern aspects of the city, including the Millenium Bridge over the Moraca River.\n\nThe Clock Tower was a 19th-century addition to a 17th-century mosque, which was destroyed by bombing during World War II, leaving this structure the only surviving part of this complex. Visitors can make their way to the top to uncover panoramic views of the city. For another piece of history, be sure to head to Ribnica Bridge, which was constructed in the 18th century and crosses the Ribnica River at its mouth to Moraca, while the Dajbabe Monastery, The Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, and Petrovic Royal Palace will offer further insights into the history of this fascinating city.\n\nNature lovers will want to explore Njegošev Park in the city, while just outside you’ll find the stunning Waterfall Niagara Podgprica, and half an hour’s drive south there’s Lake Skadar, the largest lake in southern Europe, which is well worth a visit for its wildlife and picturesque views.\n\nAlso outside of the city, you’ll find the old royal capital, Cetinje where you can explore the country’s art, history and culture, just 22 miles away, and an hour’s drive northwest of the Podgorica you’ll find the 17th-century Ostrog Orthodox Monastery, which sits 900m above the Zeta valley.\n\nWhile visiting Podgorica, be sure to tuck into some local cuisine by trying traditional Montenegrin dishes like grilled meats, fresh seafood, and hearty stews alongside local wines at one of the city’s many cosy restaurants. The city is well-known for its nightlife so be sure to head to its hub at Independence Square, where you can start your night of fun.\n\nGetting around Podgorica\n\nThere are a few ways of getting around Podgorica when you need to go a little further than your feet will take you, and that’s by bus or car. While the bus system offers a great way to explore, they may not reach every destination you have in mind, especially if you wish to explore some of the highlights mentioned above that sit further afield.\n\nTherefore, exploring the charming city and beyond becomes even more convenient and exciting when you opt for a car rental in Podgorica. With the freedom to roam at your own pace, you can easily navigate through the city’s bustling streets or venture off the beaten path to discover the array of aforementioned hidden gems.\n\nWhether you’re looking to visit historical sites, enjoy outdoor activities, or simply soak in the local culture, having a car at your disposal gives you the flexibility to tailor your itinerary according to your preferences. Plus, parking is relatively easy in Podgorica, making it hassle-free to hop out and explore whenever something catches your eye. Check out Tara-car for more information on booking your car rental straight from the airport.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nFrom elegant boutique hotels to lavish five-star resorts, there is a wide range of options to choose from for the discerning traveller seeking comfort and style during their stay in Podgorica.\n\nOne top choice for luxury travellers is the Hilton Podgorica Crna Gora, known for its sophisticated design and impeccable service. Situated in the heart of the city, this five-star hotel offers stunning views of Moraca River and easy access to Podgorica’s main attractions.\n\nFor those looking for a more intimate setting, Hotel Ziya provides a luxurious oasis with its modern décor and personalised attention. Guests can unwind at the spa or enjoy gourmet dining at the five-star hotel’s restaurant.\n\nCUE Podgorica, meanwhile, is housed in the landmark Capital Plaza building and offers opulent rooms and top-notch facilities, while Boscovich Boutique Hotel, Hotel Podgorica, Signum Hotel, and Kings Park Hotel all come highly rated and are well worthy of a spot on your shortlist of accommodation options."
