The magnificent Skadar Lake is just 9 km away from the city. It is also very close to the beautiful and well preserved Ostrog monastery.\n\nPodgorica has a reputation as a party city, and it's no problem for visitors to make friends in one of the city's many caf√©s, bars and clubs.\n\nWhat to do in Podgorica\n\nIf you have some free time in Podgorica, we recommend you enjoy the diversity of Montenegro's capital cafes and restaurants, the nightlife, or take a walk at some of the favorite picnic locations of Podgorica citizens - Mareza, Skadar Lake, or Gorica hill.\n\nPodgorica has also few small shopping malls and one with vast number of choices Delta city in which you might find the shopping area interesting, as there is vast number of boutiques, just beware the counterfeits!"
