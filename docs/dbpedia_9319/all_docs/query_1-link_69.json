        "text": "Just 150 km from Dubrovnik there is Podgorica, one of Europe’s youngest capitals. Why not combine these two very different cities in one trip?\n\nHardly definable, Podgorica is a city that has changed its name five times in the course of its thousand-year history (it is still remembered by many as Titograd) and that mixes Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian and Soviet influences and atmospheres with the new buildings that symbolise the contemporary era, such as shopping centres and offices.\n\nNestled in a valley north of Lake Shkodra, the city lies at the confluence of two main rivers, Morača and Ribnica, into which other rivers flow. To the west of Morača stretches the new business district, while to the east the city is divided into Stara Varos, the historical centre, and Nova Varos, a modern area full of shops and bars.\n\nIt is not the most beautiful capital city in Europe, but it is worth seeing: Podgorica is a lively city, pervaded by a strong optimism and desire for growth, perfect for those who want a city break in an unusual destination.\n\nGive it a thought: you won’t have to scramble to see famous sights amidst crowds of tourists and you can spend a pleasant day (or more!) visiting interesting art galleries, stopping for a snack in elegant cafés, strolling through parks and riverside promenades and indulging in a lively nightlife.\n\nThings to do in Podgorica\n\nPodgorica may not boast monuments and attractions as famous as the great European capitals, but there are nevertheless interesting things to see that we recommend below.\n\nPerhaps more than other cities, however, Podgorica should be discovered freely, without a set itinerary. You might discover elaborate and colourful street art amongst the anonymous and sad Soviet buildings or come across a stall serving the best burek in town (puff pastry pie filled with minced meat or spinach and cheese) and a thousand other surprises.\n\nParks and riverside\n\nOne of the most beautiful things to do in Podgorica is to walk along the banks of its rivers. Perhaps the most beautiful are the banks of the Ribnica, long stretches of which are lined with trees and lined with paved stone paths and steps: an oasis of tranquillity just a stone’s throw from the shopping streets, bars and restaurants of the centre – perfect for stretching your legs or, conversely, standing still and watching the water pass by and enjoying the silence.\n\nAnother place of peace is the Njegošev Park located along the banks of the Morača River, not far from the point where the three main rivers intersect. It is an ideal starting point for exploring the old town.\n\nDuring your walk along the riverbank, you will come across several old stone bridges.\n\nLake Shkodra\n\nFrom Podgorica, one can easily reach the Montenegrin side of Lake Shkodra by car, bus or train. The largest lake on the Balkan peninsula seen from above has a curious dolphin shape; it lies just halfway between Montenegro and Albania and has become a popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe best way to admire the beautiful landscape, still untouched by economic development, is to take a boat trip on the lake: it will be a day of total immersion in nature and silence that will give you indelible memories.\n\nOstrog Monastery\n\nAnother unmissable attraction around Podgorica is the Ostrog Monastery, an Orthodox monastery carved entirely out of the mountain rock that has become a pilgrimage destination for believers of different religious faiths.\n\nMap\n\nIn the following map you can see the location of the main places of interest mentioned in this article.\n\nWhere to stay in Podgorica\n\nThe best area to stay in Podgorica is certainly the Old Town within the city walls: charming and comfortable, full of amenities and with all the main tourist attractions within easy walking distance.\n\nWithin a radius of only 3 km from the centre you can find a wide variety of good quality accommodation. At a fraction of the price of other European capitals, you can find nice, well-furnished flats, modern B&Bs, 3-star hotels and even a couple of international chain hotels.\n\nIf you are aiming for extreme savings, you can choose from the city’s many hostels, suitable for young people and tourists without too many demands.\n\nRecommended hotels in Podgorica\n\nHow to get to Podgorica\n\nIf you want to reach Podgorica by car from Dubrovnik, there are two possibilities.\n\nThe quickest and shortest route is via the M6 and M18, but this way you have to drive a long way into Bosnia and Herzegovina. The alternative is to drive south along the Croatian coast and once you enter Montenegro cut inland. In the first case calculate about two and a half hours, in the second an hour more.\n\nIt is possible to reach Podgorica from Dubrovnik by public transport because the two cities are connected by a direct bus, but the journey is very long: calculate between four and five hours depending on the time of departure and traffic.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want to get to Podgorica , you can take a low-cost flight departing from several European cities; given the tumultuous development of the city, it is possible that departures from other cities will be added soon."
