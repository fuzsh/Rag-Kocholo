        "text": "by Property Forum | Investment\n\nCBRE South Eastern Europe provided advisory services to BIG CEE in the process of purchasing the Capital Plaza complex in Podgorica.\n\nCapital Plaza, a mixed-use facility, represents a specific entity when it comes to real estate on the Montenegrin market. It includes over 55,000 square meters of office space located in two towers, luxury apartments that can be rented for residential and business needs, a 122-room hotel, and a retail zone on two levels, all in the heart of the Podgorica business zone.\n\n\"The transaction represents one of the largest investments in the Podgorica market and we are honoured to have had the opportunity to advise BIG CEE in their new acquisition on the Montenegrin market. As part of this transaction, the CBRE SEE investment team, as a specialized associate for this type of transaction, initiated the entire process - from the purchase idea to the complete due diligence process. Regarding the further development of the real estate market in our region, it is particularly encouraging that this transaction took place just one year after the BIG CEE company added the Delta City shopping centre in Podgorica to its portfolio, thereby expanding its business to the Montenegrin market,\" Uroš Grujić, Head of Investment Properties for Southeastern Europe at CBRE pointed out."
