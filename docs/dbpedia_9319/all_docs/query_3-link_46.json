        "text": "In this destination guide we will visit the sights of Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro.\n\nPodgorica\n\nAfter spending a great time in beautiful Kotor on the Montenegrin coast and making a short stop in the old royal capital of Cetinje, it was now time to explore Montenegro’s modern-day capital of Podgorica.\n\nBefore the start of my trip I contemplated for a while whether or not I should include Podgorica on my Montenegrin itinerary.\n\nAlthough it is Montenegro’s biggest city and economic heart, it is not known as a particularly interesting city to visit for tourists.\n\nIn the end I decided to give Podgorica a chance for the simple reason that I never managed to visit on my previous trips to Montenegro and at least it meant an easy commute the next day to Podgorica Airport to catch my flight to Germany.\n\nWould the city indeed disappoint – or has it some hidden charms?\n\nExploring the old town\n\nFrom my Podgorica hotel it was a short walk to Stara Varoš, the old town neighbourhood of Podgorica.\n\nNow don’t get your expectations up too high about Podgorica’s old town. Whatever you might expect, Dubrovnik or Sarajevo it is certainly not.\n\nThe neighbourhood feels more like a old village located smack bang in the middle of a modern city.\n\nAlthough there are some winding roads (tarmac rather than cobblestones) and old Ottoman-era houses, there are an equal number of modern-day apartment buildings built right in between taking away all the charm.\n\nThat said, there are a two old Turkish mosques and a clock tower worth checking out and the area makes for a pleasant, low-key area to walk around.\n\nJust don’t go in with high expectations of a Medieval old town!\n\nRiver\n\nStara Varoš is built just south of the small Ribnica river, which flows here into the much larger Morača river. Historically, the focal point of Podgorica used to be on the south side of the Ribnica.\n\nNowadays the city centre of Podgorica and most of the city’s cultural and social life can be found in the neighbourhood just to the north of the river.\n\nThe Old Ribnica River Bridge makes for a lovely way to cross the small waterway.\n\nThere are some decent views here over the river confluence and the ruins of Nemanjin Grad, the old city fortress.\n\nCity centre\n\nThe modern-day heart of the city is centred around Independence Square with its large fountain in the middle. Around it you can find plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants.\n\nAlthough Podgorica is certainly not Montenegro’s most exciting city, it is for sure the best place in the country for shopping and probably for everyday life as well due to the abundance of bars and pubs catering to government workers, businessmen and students from the local university.\n\nIt is therefore not a surprise that in this part of town you can find a number of government offices, such as the National Parliament, the Podgorica city hall, supreme court and a handful of foreign embassies.\n\nYou should however not expect hundreds of shops and pubs like you would find in a national capital like Belgrade.\n\nAfter all, don’t forget that the city of Podgorica only has 200,000 inhabitants – making it one of Europe’s smallest capitals!\n\nRiverside walk\n\nFrom the city centre I headed back towards the Morača river.\n\nAlong the riverside is a nice pedestrian walk from where you have some good views over the water, the city and the mountains in the far distance.\n\nEven though Podgorica is located in a broad valley, the mountains are never too far away in the mountainous country which Montenegro definitely is.\n\nThere are also some good views over the many bridges spanning the Morača, of which the Millennium Bridge is the best known and one of Podgorica’s best known landmarks.\n\nAfter a nice walk along the riverside it was time to find a place for dinner.\n\nI originally had my eyes set on an appealing-looking restaurant in the old town called Pod Volat, but when I walked across a cheap eatery advertising ćevapčići for dump prices I couldn’t resist as I was getting hungry.\n\nIf memory serves well the ćevapi, salad, bread and beer were only 3 or 4 euro or so – quite a steal!\n\nEnd of the Balkan part\n\nAfter the decent meal I walked back to my hotel, but not before hopping into the adjacent shopping mall to buy a beer or two as small nightcaps to drink in my room.\n\nThe rest of the evening I just relaxed in my room, taking a bath while drinking a cold beer and listening to some traditional Balkan music.\n\nAs I would fly onward to Germany the following day, this evening did mark the end of the Balkan part of this trip.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the last few days being back in the Balkans and was already starting to make plans for a future trip to other parts of Montenegro, Serbia and other countries in the region!\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is however one question which remains unanswered: Does Podgorica warrants a visit, or is it best skipped on your Montenegrin or Balkan itinerary?\n\nI would say that for most tourists, Podgorica would not be a terribly interesting destination as the city is low on traditional sights.\n\nYou just cannot compare Podgorica to the historic, beautiful cities of the region such as Dubrovnik, Kotor and Budva, let alone to other Balkan capitals such as Belgrade and Zagreb.\n\nPodgorica feels like (and to be honest, actually is) a provincial town at best.\n\nDon’t forget this is a city with only 200,000 inhabitants.\n\nYou cannot expect the same atmosphere as the Montenegrin coastline, which is full of holidaymakers in summer, or the bustling and picturesque streets of Sarajevo’s Baščaršija area.\n\nFor most tourists Podgorica is about as appealing as that other Balkan capital of Prishtina (Kosovo) – and I would personally rank them both towards the bottom of my list of least favourite European capitals.\n\nMontenegro’s capital is mostly an everyday city in which people work, study, shop and actually live.\n\nIf you look at Podgorica from this point of view, the city isn’t actually bad at all.\n\nThere are some good hotels, decent shopping and lively pubs and restaurants. It doesn’t seem like a bad place to live.\n\nIt means that Podgorica is certainly not a bad place to spend half a day in walking around and sitting down for a meal or drink.\n\nIf you find yourself in the area and have some time to spare, by all means pay Podgorica visit!\n\nIf you are flying in or out of Podgorica Airport like me on this trip, Podgorica isn’t a bad place at all to visit and stay for the night if you think it is more convenient.\n\nBut a touristic highlight of Montenegro Podgorica is certainly not.\n\nIf you have only limited time in the country, I would strongly suggest moving immediately on towards the coast or the mountains which do make for top travel destinations.\n\nTrip report index\n\nThis article is part of the ‘An Adriatic Adventure: Off-Season Travel to Dubrovnik, Montenegro and a Bit of Bavaria‘ trip report, which consists of the following chapters:"
