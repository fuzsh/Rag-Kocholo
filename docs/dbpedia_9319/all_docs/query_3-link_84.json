        "text": "All of Podgorica's glories in the palm of your hand\n\nDo you wish to \"get lost\" in a city with a lot to offer yet isn't overwhelmed with tourists? Then come to Podgorica!\n\nWander around the city\n\nThe Ribnica Delta in Morača is the city's historical center, and it has been refreshing city life with the charm of wild nature for centuries. For the people of Podgorica, this is a favorite picnic spot! Begin your journey into the past, or at least the part of it that is preserved in Podgorica. Be sure to stop by the Sahat Kula (Clock Tower) on your way through the Old Town's narrow alleys, as it is one of the few Ottoman architectural structures that survived World War II.\n\nPodgorica is a city where various cultures, religions, and nations have intertwined as demonstrated by the Orthodox, Catholic, Islamic, and Jewish temples that you can visit.\n\nThe ruins of ancient Doklee, dating from the first decade of the first century AD, are located 4 kilometers from the city center of Podgorica. Visit the Marko Miljanov Museum and the village of Medun, where the remains of the Illyrian city of Meteon can be found.\n\nSnuggle in a peaceful corner by the water and swim in Morača\n\nYou will get a true taste of Montenegro's capital in one of the restaurants along the water near the city. That's where the summer heat fades away! You may discover a quiet beach, a quiet corner, and enjoy the richness of nature at Sitnica, Morača, Zeta, Ribnica, and even on Skadar Lake (about a 20 minute drive from the city centre). Swimming in Morača is a special pleasure for all Podgorica people. It will undoubtedly attract you as well! Niagara Falls, located 7 kilometers from the city, are particularly beautiful during the winter months. Be sure to check this place on your \"bucket\" list!\n\nTry some local wines\n\nCheck to see if Montenegrin wines are indeed what they promise to be. Between Podgorica and Skadar Lake, there are thousands of vines heavy with grapes ready for harvest in September. If you're lucky enough to visit a local home, you'll be able to take part in the process of preparing homemade wine and brandy!\n\nIf you have a taste for decadence, consider paying a visit to the most popular wine cellar, Šipčanik (30 meters below ground), which offers tours and tastings throughout the year. You can even visit it on the same day as “Niagara Falls” since they are in the same direction. Local wines can also be sampled at Podgorica cafes or purchased at a reasonable price in a local supermarket.\n\nEnjoy local sports and cultural events\n\nPodgorica offers cultural and sporting activities all year round. International festivals, open-air cinema, festivals, football, basketball, and volleyball tournaments, and others. If you go to Kruševac Park, which is great for a night out in the summer, you might be astonished to see Petrović castle in the heart of the park, which has a lovely pink exterior. The Centre for Contemporary Art features both permanent and temporary exhibitions.\n\nWant more action? Go rafting and kayaking on the Morača and Cijevna rivers. Rocks perfect for free-climbing are maintained in the locality of Smokovac. Bring your sports equipment because there are fields for cyclists, table tennis, football, and more on the hill Gorica. How about a little jogging? The forest of Tolok is great for this!\n\nHave fun at night out in Podgorica\n\nDid someone mention \"fun?!” In Podgorica, leisure is an art form, and having fun and going out is a basic necessity! You'll have a great time here. Have fun on Bokeška Street, which is lined with clubs, pubs, and cafes (salsa parties, live concerts, old town music.) There is no shortage of cafes because a new one opens every so often. The Podgorica holiday market is especially attractive in the winter, when you may enjoy the distinctive ambiance of Podgorica while listening to good local music, eating high-quality food, admiring New Year's lanterns, and sipping mulled wine.\n\nFinally, remember that everything is close by in Podgorica! You can choose if you want to go to the shore, which is an hour away, or to the mountain center of Kolašin, which is an hour away (65 km from the center). The possibilities are numerous!"
