While it’s nice to visit the beach towns like Budva and Kotor or the mountains in Durmitor National Park, you only get the full picture of Montenegro by visiting the capital Podgorica.\n\nWhat is Podgorica Known for?\n\nPodgorica is known for its long history starting in Illyrian and Roman times, continuing during the Ottoman Empire and extending to former Yugoslavia.\n\nYou can still find plenty of architectonic evidence from all eras around town.\n\n6 Reasons to Visit Podgorica Montenegro\n\nWhy you need to visit Podgorica when you’re in Montenegro:\n\nPodgorica has a long-ranging history.\n\nIt’s cheaper than the beach destinations of Montenegro.\n\nDelicious food which is less Venetian influenced than in the coastal towns and more traditional Balkans cuisine.\n\nOn a similar note, we liked the nightlife which seemed to be catered more towards the locals than tourists – unlike in the coastal towns.\n\nSee the everyday life in Montenegro.\n\nGreat base to explore Lake Shkadar as well as other destinations.\n\nQuick Podgorica City Guide\n\nHow Many Days in Podgorica?\n\nWith only 200000 inhabitants, Podgorica is a small capital. One day is enough to see the major sights and get a taste of the vibe.\n\nWe would personally recommend to staying one night as well because we enjoyed the nightlife.\n\nWhere to Stay in Podgorica\n\nThere are plenty of Podgorica hotels:\n\nOur Podgorica Accommodation\n\nWe chose to stay at House with a garden in Podgorica Center and couldn’t be happier with our choice. The location was amazing, the room comfy and the hospitality of the owners through the roof.\n\nFor more of a Hostel vibe, we can recommend Hostel Q.\n\nWhere is Podgorica?\n\nPodgorica is located in the southeast of Montenegro, close to Lake Shkadar, Albania, as well as the Adriatic Sea.\n\nDay Trips from Podgorica\n\nAs Montenegro is a small country, Podgorica is the ultimate day trip base.\n\nHow to get to Podgorica\n\nBus to Podgorica\n\nPodgorica is well connected to its neighbouring cities. You can take direct buses from Tirana, Albania, Belgrade, Serbia, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegowina, and many more destinations.\n\nTrain to Podgorica\n\nThere is one daily train from Belgrade to Podgorica.\n\nFlying to Podgorica\n\nPodgorica airport is well connected to other European destinations – also by low-cost carriers like Ryanair or Wizz Air.\n\nPodgorica Airport to City Centre\n\nThe easiest way to go from Podgorica Airport to the city centre is by Podgorica airport taxi. Expect to pay around 15€.\n\nIf you are on a budget, there is also a train. You have to walk around 15 minutes to the Aerodrom train station. Don’t worry if it looks a little (ok a lot) shabby – a train did eventually come for us. It should cost around 1-2 €. Here is the timetable.\n\nIs Podgorica Safe?\n\nWe always felt safe in Podgorica – also walking around at night. Locals confirmed that they feel like they live in a very safe capital city.\n\nIs Podgorica Expensive?\n\nPodgorica is much cheaper than the seaside destinations in Montenegro like Budva or Kotor!\n\nThings to Do in Podgorica\n\n1. Podgorica Sightseeing\n\nThings to see in Podgorica include:\n\nPodgorica Old Town (Stara Varos) with its windy alleys, mosque, and clock tower.\n\nSkaline (Stairs) where Ribnica River meets Moraca River. With the Ottoman Bridge and the ruins of old Nemanja's town.\n\nTrg Republike ( Central Square) and Hercegovacka pedestrian street.\n\nMillennium Bridge.\n\nPetrovic Palace.\n\nThe Orthodox Temple of Christ's Resurrection.\n\n2. Podgorica Free Walking Tour\n\nWe love to take a free walking tour in every city we can.\n\nIn Podgorica, we tried something new and did a free e-bike tour by discover.podgorica. It was super interesting to get out of the city centre and explore some places we would have never found on our own!\n\n3. Try Local Food\n\nPod Volat is amazing for Montenegrin food.\n\nItaka Library Bar is hands down the best bar in Podgorica – plus the craft beer is delicious.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links.
