Podgorica International Airport is just a few kilometers south of the city center and provides direct flights to many major European cities, including London, Vienna, and Paris.\n\nIf you prefer to travel by land, Podgorica is easily accessible by bus and train from other parts of Montenegro, as well as neighboring countries such as Serbia and Croatia.\n\nFor more information on how to get to Montenegro, be sure to check out our article: Take to the Skies: How to Get to Montenegro\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nBut why is it important to know Montenegro’s capital?
