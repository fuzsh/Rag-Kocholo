        "text": ", 2522m - Info\n\nIntroduction :\n\nPart of Yugoslavia (1918 - 1992), and later Serbia and Montengro,(1992 - 2006), Montenegro regained its status as an Independent Republic on 28th June 2006.\n\nMontenegro offer some of the least visited and thus wildest mountain scenery in Europe. With a name literally meaning \"black mountain\" you might not expect anything else, however the name refer to the dark forests that once cover the lower slopes than the white karst limestone rock of the mountains themselves. In stature, mountain ranges of this country; Durmitor, Prokletije (mountains of the \"damned\") and others, match anything else the continent has to offer walkers, back packer, and tourist.\n\nTraditionally (if not officially) Montenegro claims Bobotov Kuk on Durmitor as its highest peak at 2,523m. It stands in the Durmitor National Park which was formed in 1980 and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which really goes to prove how ecologically valuable the landscape here is. The region is a patch work of forests, meadows, steep slopes, and seasonal lakes. To the north, the park is bordered by the equally sight worthy Tara Canyon, claimed by the Montenegrins to be the second deepest canyon in the world. Beyond the Tara Canyon the mountains rise to the border with Bosnia Herzegovina and its highest peak Maglic.\n\nBobotov Kuk was first climbed in 1883 by the Austrian Dr. Oscar Baumann (1864 to 1899) who later pioneered exploration of Africa. Despite other scientific and climbing expeditions, Durmitor did not attract significant visitors until after the second world war.\n\nAs previously suggested there are other claims to the highpoint throne. In the south east of Montenegro lie the Prokletije mountains. Here there are three peaks in Montenegrin territory higher than Bobotov Kuk. The border with neighbouring Albania runs very near or even over these peaks, and thus they are also known by Albanian names, which can add confussion. I have yet to find any of these peaks on a map\n\ni. Maja Kolac / Maja Kolata with its highest peak Zla Kolata / Kolata e Keq (2534m)\n\nii. Maja Kolac / Maja Kolata with its second peak Dobra Kolata (2528m)\n\niii. Mt. Bjelic (possible also spelt Belic) with its highest peak Rosni Vrh / Maja Rosit (2525m)\n\n(Vrh is Serbian / Montenegrin for top, whilst Maja is Albainian for crown, i.e. much the same thing.)\n\nAt present it is unclear why neither of these peaks are officially recognised as the highest. There are few possibilities ranging from the love for, and iconic status of the Durmitor range in the Montenegrin culture, the fact that Bobotov Kuk stands wholly in Montenegrin territory whilst those in the Prokletije are shared with Albania. Perhaps some more recent and yet undisclosed survey has come up with different summit altitudes. For sure there will be continues debate until this is resolved.\n\nRoutes :\n\nWaymarking on the red routes.\n\nFootpaths in the Durmitor National Park are marked with a circle of red paint with a white centre on trees and rocks. At junctions, there are usually small wooden signs or arrows and destinations written in red paint upon a boulder.\n\nThere are a number of approaches to Bobotov Kuk, generally split between the Northern and Southern. The Northern is described as a classic route taking from 5 to 6 hours in ascent, whilst the Southern around 3 hours. Neither route is technically demanding. The best way to enjoy the mountain (and the Durmitor National Park) would be to make a South to North traverse.\n\n● Northern Route\n\nThis begins by Crno Jezero (Black Lake) (1416m) 3 km west of Žabljak centre and can be reach either on foot, by bus or taxi. There is a modern yet welcoming resturant here serving good food. From the lake you follow the way-marked path west along the lake shore and then northwards to the junction of paths at Jaksica Mlin (Jaksica mill) on Mlinski Potok river (25 mins from starting). So far the walking has been on the level, but the route now climbs up first through conifer forest then beech, with views back down to Crno Jezero. 1hr after leaving the mill, the forest ends, and at its edge there is a split in the path providing two routes which converge later at Biljegov Do.\n\nRainbow over Crno Jezero, and Jaksica Mlin on Mlinski Potok.\n\na) The right hand path heads initially north-west through dwarf pine, then west and south-west across a tricky a landscape of karst rock formations, sink holes, and scree slopes to Ledena Pecina (ice cave) 1 hr 40 mins from the junction. A decent into the hall of icicles is optional, but well worth it. From the cave, head south for 15 mins to join the other route at Biljegov Do.\n\nb) The left hand path heads south-west over undulating terrain, through a narrow canyon and up to a collection of shepherd's huts and the mountain refuge at Katun Lokvice (40 mins from the junction). There is a junction outside the hut. You should travel the westward path, which gains a little height before dropping into the Lokvice Valley. Here the path climbs in a series of switchbacks up the steep face of Prla and into the lower section of the glaciated Biljegov Do. Continue north-west (ignoring the path that heads south-west) to re-join the path coming in from Ledena Pecina 1 hr from leaving the mountain refuge.\n\nInside the Ledena Pecina (ice cave).\n\nFrom Biljegov Do it is another 2 hrs to the summit of Bobotov Kuk. First the path ascends to the boulder strewn basin of Valoviti do. Here maps indicate another choice of paths;\n\na) The most direct trail travels southwest, close to a burnt down mountain refuge, to climb steeply up to a pass between Bobotov Kuk (to the north) and Lucin Vrh (to the south). Snow may lie on the step ascent into July, so beware. At the pass there is a path coming in from the southern routes. Your path lies westward beneath the pyramid of Bobotov Kuk for a final approach of its west face.\n\nb) The other path travelled west to rise beneath the peak of Bozimeni Vrh to the ridge line above the impressive, steep sided valley / cirque of Skrka do. From here you once followed the ridge line southward for twenty minutes to below Bobotov Kuk before making an ascent of its west face. However the ridge path was destroyed by rock fall many years ago and a traverse is ill advised.\n\n● Southern Routes\n\nThe two southern routes require a taxi ride to Sedlo (1907m) or Urdeni do (1772m). The route from Sedlo is slightly longer than that starting at Urdeni do. Both routes join near the shores of small lake at 2028m, before steep climb up to the pass between Bobotov Kuk and Lucin Vrh, and a traverse westward beneath Bobotov Kuk before making the final approach.\n\nFinal Asent of Bobotov Kuk from the col between it and Lucin Vrh, May 2007"
