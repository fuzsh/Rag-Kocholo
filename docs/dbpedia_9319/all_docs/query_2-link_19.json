        "text": "Introduction\n\nLocated in the Balkan region of southeastern Europe, the country called Montenegro sits along the Adriatic Sea. Montenegro was part of Yugoslavia for most of the 1900s and later, after Yugoslavia broke apart, part of the country called Serbia and Montenegro. In 2006 Montenegro peacefully gained its independence and became a separate country. Area 5,360 square miles (13,883 square kilometers). Population (2024 est.) 615,200.\n\nLocated on the Balkan Peninsula at the southern end of the Dinaric Alps, Montenegro is bounded on the southeast by Albania, on the southwest by the Adriatic Sea and Croatia, on the northwest by Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the northeast by Serbia, and on the east by Kosovo. Montenegro has two capitals. Its administrative capital and largest city is Podgorica, though its cultural center is the titular capital and older city of Cetinje.\n\nLand and Climate\n\nMontenegro’s terrain consists mostly of rugged mountains and valleys, with the best farmlands and forests in the eastern section. Montenegro, which means Black Mountain, was named for Mount Lovćen, a peak near the Adriatic Sea that was the state’s stronghold during centuries of conflict with the Turks. The Dinaric Alps in the east include the highest mountain in Montenegro, Bobotov Peak, at about 8,277 feet (2,523 meters) above sea level. A narrow plain borders the Montenegrin coast except in the north.\n\nThe northern part of Montenegro is drained by the Lim, Piva, and Tara rivers, which are tributaries of the Danube. In the south, the Morača and Zeta rivers drain into the Adriatic Sea. Power plants on the Piva and Zeta rivers produce substantial amounts of hydroelectricity. The mountains of Montenegro have many lakes. The largest lake in the Balkan region, Lake Scutari, lies along the border between Montenegro and Albania.\n\nA cold climate dominates the highlands, but the temperatures are milder in the valleys. The mean annual temperature in Montenegro is 58° F (14° C). In some places the snow never thaws but is constantly replenished by the country’s high annual precipitation, which averages some 150 inches (380 centimeters) a year.\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the time of the Roman Empire, the area that is now Montenegro formed part of the Roman province of Illyria. Present-day Albanians claim the ancient Illyrians as their ancestors. The Slavs settled the area in the 7th century ad, and Eastern Orthodox Christianity spread throughout the region over the next few hundred years. In the late 12th century, it was incorporated into the Serbian empire. It became independent again in 1389, after the Ottoman Turks defeated the Serbs at the Battle of Kosovo. The Montenegrins struggled frequently with the Turks and Albanians during the next few hundred years but maintained their independence.\n\nIn the early 18th century the state formed an alliance with Russia. Some two centuries later, in 1910, Nicholas I of Russia declared himself king of Montenegro. Montenegro joined forces with Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece to fight Ottoman Turkey during the Balkan Wars of 1912–13. Montenegro’s territory was extended as a result of the war, and from then on it shared a common border with Serbia.\n\nAt the end of World War I, the assembly in Montenegro deposed Nicholas and announced that Serbia and Montenegro would form a union. Both states joined the larger Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes when it was formed in 1918. The country was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929.\n\nAfter World War II, Montenegro became part of the newly formed Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia, a Socialist federation led by Tito until his death in 1980.\n\nThe Socialist Yugoslav state broke apart in 1991–92, leaving only Serbia and Montenegro in the union. The two republics reconfigured the country as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992 and then, in 2003, became a federation under the name Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nThe movement for an independent Montenegro, however, had been growing since the late 1990s. In 2006 the Montenegrins voted to end the federation, and on June 3, 2006, Montenegro declared its independence. The Serbian parliament recognized Montenegro’s independence two days later."
