        "text": "With daughter Suzi as our guide, Eva and I flew down on no-frills Ryanair (not even free water from a tap) to the beautifully set, up and coming city of Podgorica. Unfortunately, many WWII bombing raids and about 50 years under Tito communism left the city quite distressed. But recovery is on the way. A year ago Montenegro joined NATO, to serious Russian angst.\n\nLet’s take a look at downtown, where we had intended to stay, then progress to the vibrant suburbs where we spent three nights. The apartment we reserved in the Old Town back in January had meanwhile been rented to our host’s cousin. So we found ourselves in new quarters, which turned out to be just fine as it was in the newest part of town, and we were near the theater where Eva would see a showing of the NY Metropolitan Opera. She was able to walk home by herself quite safely late at night.\n\nThe country of Montenegro has been under so many different rulers and under the thumb of so many other countries, it boggles the mind to keep the history straight. It became independent from Serbia only in 2006, avoiding all the Balkan wars, but not internal tribal feuds. While part of Yugoslavia, the capital of Montenegro was known as Titograd, but now Podgorica. Both Cyrillic and Western alphabets are in use, with Western far more common. English dominates signs and advertising, and almost everyone we meet speaks English surprisingly well. Here are a few old manhole covers with lettering from the past.\n\nWe decided to have lunch at the Lanterna, a small, inviting local restaurant.\n\nThe city park sits astride the fast flowing Morača River, green from glacial water and clear as can be.\n\nIf we had had time, we might have taken in a play of Shakespeare. We know he himself spelled his name in different ways, but probably not Šekspir.\n\nNow let’s move out of downtown a couple of kilometers, just beyond the university, to our apartment on the seventh floor.\n\nOur flat was modern and spacious with two bedrooms. We looked out over snowcapped mountains in one direction, to a well-stocked supermarket in another, and to abandoned factories right below us.\n\nThis was the first of many surprises as to how much food was served. Ten sausages each overwhelmed us. We saved most of them for later meals at the apartment.\n\nOne morning we just had to try Bar 49 for breakfast. Ice water with our coffee. What a super idea. Nowhere in Europe can you get ice water even if you plead for it. Here it’s free. No need to even ask.\n\nFrom our balcony we had a stark view of an abandoned heavy equipment manufacturing plant. It had been a star performer in communist times, but could not compete with the West. Maybe not unlike Detroit not so long ago.\n\nSince we were situated on the edge of town, we took a morning walk across the river and into a residential neighborhood, on the fringe of modernization.\n\nWe returned to our apartment, checked out and had lunch at Meat restaurant. There we waited for our apartment host who had agreed to drive us to Cetinje, the old capital and our next destination, up 2000 feet into the mountains, 35 minutes away. He was so accommodating and took us right to the doorstep of our next destination."
