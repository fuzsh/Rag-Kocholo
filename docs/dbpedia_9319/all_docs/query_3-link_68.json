        "text": "While still recovering from the pandemic, Montenegro is facing renewed headwinds. Growth is estimated at a strong 6.9 percent in 2022, led by private consumption. Inflation surged to new highs but its adverse impact on the cost of living was largely mitigated by an increase in real disposable incomes.\n\nAdditional Financing to MIDAS Project (US$ 3.84 mln)\n\nThe Project Development Objective is to expand capacity building in relevant institutions in Montenegro to manage public funds dedicated to agricultural support. Around 660 farmers, 60 percent of whom live in the poorer north, received IPARD-like grants to enhance their agricultural production."
