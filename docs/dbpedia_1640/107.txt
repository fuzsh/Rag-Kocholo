Pulp's 'Disco 2000' is a nostalgic anthem that captures the essence of looking back on youth and the pangs of unrequited love. The song's protagonist reminisces about a childhood friend, Deborah, with whom he shared a close birth time, suggesting a deep connection from the very beginning. Despite the mothers' playful suggestion that they could be 'sister and brother,' the protagonist harbors deeper feelings for Deborah, feelings that were never reciprocated. The song's title, 'Disco 2000,' alludes to a future meeting time, a common childhood promise to reunite in the new millennium, which serves as a metaphor for the hopes and dreams of youth that often go unfulfilled.

The lyrics paint a vivid picture of the protagonist's memories, from the wood-chip wallpaper in Deborah's small house to the social dynamics of their school days. Deborah's early physical development and popularity among boys are contrasted with the protagonist's own awkwardness and invisibility in her eyes. The repeated chorus about meeting up 'in the year 2000' underscores the passage of time and the changes that come with it. The protagonist is left alone, reflecting on a lonely past moment, while Deborah has moved on with her life, even getting married.

The song concludes with a bittersweet realization that the planned reunion will never happen, yet there's a lingering hope as the protagonist invites Deborah to meet up, despite the years and her changed circumstances. 'Disco 2000' is a poignant reflection on the past, the innocence of childhood dreams, and the reality of growing up. It's a universal story of the one that got away and the enduring nature of first loves, set to an upbeat, danceable tune that belies the song's more melancholic undertones.
