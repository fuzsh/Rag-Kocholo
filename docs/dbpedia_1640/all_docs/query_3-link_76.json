        "text": "Following on from the previous post, we simply had to take a deeper dive into some of our favourite funky/disco house tracks from the 2000s!\n\nBut first…\n\nHow we define ‘’Classic Funky/Disco House’’\n\nDrawing on funk, soul and disco influences from the 70s & 80s, together with the use of samples, the mid-to-late 90s was really the birth era of what we call ‘’funky house’’; a sub-genre that would go on to flourish for about 15 years – running all the way through the 2000s.\n\nEvery standout genre (or sub-genre in the case of funky house) has its golden age, which is nearly always during the initial years from when that genre was conceived. And it’s these tracks that are commonly referred to as ‘’classics’’ for years to come.\n\nIn short, this is why ‘’classic funky house’’ (or classic disco house) is the best way to describe our selection.\n\nFor those of you born in the late 90s, or even the early 2000s, you might prefer to describe these tracks as ‘’old school house music’’ – which is also fine. To a certain degree, you might say it’s subjective.\n\nBefore we jump in\n\nThis list below has been hand-picked by our team here at The DJ Revolution, many of whom had these tracks in their vinyl collections as working DJs through this period.\n\nIt includes tracks from house music legends such as Junior Jack, Deep Dish, Joey Negro and Martin Solveig — released on iconic record labels such as Hed Kandi, Defected Records and Strictly Rhythm.\n\nMake no mistake, these records helped shape dance music culture in a big way during this incredible decade of house music.\n\nFor the DJs and music collectors out there, we did our best to include the appropriate ‘buy’ links for the digital and vinyl versions in the description for each track.\n\nSo then, here are 20 of the best funky & disco house classics from the 2000s!\n\n1. Carousel Feat. Krysten Cummings – Wanted (Main Piano Club Mix)\n\nTo kick things off, we’ve gone for this feel-good piano house classic produced by Carousel members Danny Allsopp, Johnny Coombes and Pete Doyle, with Krysten Cummings providing the infectious soulful vocals.\n\nThe track was originally released on well-known U.S. house music label Soulfuric Trax back in 2000. Founded in ’96, the label has since garnered a cult-like following, having released classics from the likes of John ‘Julius’ Knight, Hardsoul, Urban Blues Project, Wayne Gardiner and others.\n\nYou can grab this little beauty on vinyl over on Discogs – which includes the ‘Main Piano Club Mix’ featured here below – or get the digital version on Beatport.\n\n2. Powers That Be vs Roland Clarke – Funky Planet (Warren Clarke Remix)\n\nKeeping the energy up, this next track is from ‘Powers That Be’, with help from American DJ, producer, songwriter and vocalist Roland Clark.\n\nAlso the founding member of the dance music project Urban Soul, Clark has worked with a long list of prolific house music figures including Armand van Helden, Todd Terry, Fatboy Slim and others.\n\nIf you want to add this to your collection, either grab the 12-inch vinyl over at Discogs or the digital version via Beatport. The track was released on Defected back in 2003.\n\n3. Daft Punk – High Life\n\nOriginally released on Virgin Records back in 2001, High Life was part of Daft Punk’s disco-inspired second studio album entitled ‘Discovery’. It samples the 1980 soul/disco hit ‘Break Down For Love’ by Tavares.\n\nDaft Punk were of course French electronic music duo, formed in 1993 by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. The duo unfortunately broke up in February 2021.\n\nYou can get the vinyl on Discogs (from 2004) or the digital version on Beatport. Alternatively you might just want to get the album, which also includes massive hit singles ‘One More Time, ‘Digital Love’ and others.\n\n4. DJ Disciple Feat. Suzy – Yes (Ian Carey Remix)\n\nWith a house music resume as long as your arm, DJ Disciple (real name Dave Banks) is an American house music DJ-Producer from Brooklyn.\n\nAlthough this track was originally released on David’s ‘Catch 22 Recordings’ label in 2002, it wasn’t until 2006 when iconic UK label Hed Kandi — known for this brand of feel-good disco house — released the more popular Ian Carey Remixes.\n\nIf you wish to add it to your collection, you can grab the original vinyl EP over on Discogs or get a digital copy from Traxsource. Whilst it might be considered a little commercial by some, this funky house classic can’t be denied!\n\n5. Danny Clark & Jay Benham – Wondrous (David Penn Remix)\n\nWith help from SuSu Bobien on the vocals, ‘’Wondrous’’ was the debut single from production partnership Danny Clark & Jay Benham. This powerfully uplifting funky classic became one of the most successful house tracks of 2008.\n\nThe track was first released on Strictly Rhythm and later licensed to Defected, and subsequently featured on countless compilations worldwide.\n\nWe couldn’t easily find the David Penn Remix on vinyl unfortunately, although the digital version can be found on Traxsource.\n\n6. Community presents Fonda Rae – Over Like A Fat Rat (Jazz N Groove Mix)\n\nThis next track came out on UK label Z Records back in 2003, produced by Community members Eric Beal and Jim Caruso. It’s basically a rework of Fonda Rae’s original, ‘Over Like a Fat Rat’, from 1982.\n\nThe remix we’ve featured below is an absolute floor-filler from American house music production team Brian Tappert & Marc Pomeroy – AKA ‘Jazz N Groove’.\n\nThe 12-inch vinyl, which includes the ‘Prime Time Dub’ in addition to the Jazz N Groove Mix, is available over on Discogs. You can also grab a digital copy from Beatport or via Defected’s House Masters compilation on Traxsource.\n\n7. Deep Dish – Flashdance (Original Club Mix)\n\nOriginally from Iran, Deep Dish are electronic music duo consisting of Dubfire and Sharam, who moved to the U.S. in the early 90s.\n\nWith its infectious electric guitar riff, Flashdance is one of the most recognizable dance tracks ever made …certainly from the 2000s. It is a cover of “He’s a Dream” by Shandi Sinnamon (1983) – taken from the Flashdance soundtrack in that same year.\n\nThis ‘Original Club Mix’ was released on a few different labels in 2004 and quickly became a massive hit the world over, also featuring on the album ‘It’s All Gone Pete Tong’ a year later in 2005.\n\nTo buy it, either grab the vinyl on Discogs or check out the different digital remixes via Juno Download.\n\n8. John ‘Julius’ Knight – Dancin’ In Paradise (JJK Mix)\n\nIf you’re a DJ that’s looking for a funky, floor-filling bomb, then look no further! This little gem is by American house music DJ, producer/remixer John ‘Julius’ Knight …also known as ‘JJK’.\n\nThe track was first released on UK label Spectrum Records (part of Defected) back in 2002, and is a remix of Candido’s ‘’Dancin’ & Prancin’’ from 1979.\n\nWe couldn’t find a digital copy unfortunately, although the 12-inch vinyl (which includes three different edits) is available via Discogs.\n\n9. Gadjo feat. Alexandra Prince – So Many Times (Club Mix)\n\nThis next track is credited to German producer, Gadjo, and features singer-songwriter and house music diva Alexandra Prince on the vocals.\n\nAs well as proving the vocals, Alexandra also wrote the song, which reached No. 1 in the Worldwide Dance Charts and No. 22 in the official UK Single Charts. It was originally released in 2003 and hit its peak in popularity on the bar & club scene around 2005.\n\nRegardless of its commercial success, the combination of the awesome piano riff together with those reminiscing vocals puts this Latin-influenced funky house classic right at the top of the pile.\n\nYou can grab four different edits on vinyl over at Discogs or get the ‘Vocal Club Mix’ on Beatport.\n\n10. Rasmus Faber Feat. Melo – Get Over Here (Axwell Club Mix)\n\nKeeping it around the middle of the decade, this next track was written and produced by Swedish composer & remixer, DJ Rasmus Faber – with soulful singer and fellow Swede ‘Melo’ providing the vocals.\n\nFollowing its massive success in the bars & clubs, originally released in 2005, it was later signed by the Azuli label who provided additional remixes. Groove Armada’s Andy Cato also did one.\n\nYou can grab the 3-track vinyl EP over on Discogs or get the digital version via Traxsource. The Axwell Remix is the one we’re featuring here below, which was certainly the most popular.\n\n11. Joey Negro – Make A Move On Me (Club mix)\n\nAnother absolute classic … ‘Make A Move On Me’ was put together by English veteran producer & remixer, Joey Negro (real name Dave Lee), who released it on his own label Z Records back in 2005.\n\nNotably, Dave was one of the first artists to incorporate disco samples in house music when he began his production career in 1988.\n\nFun fact: Believing that his own name was somewhat mundane, he decided an alias was required. Unable to think of a suitable name and under pressure to meet a deadline, he took inspiration from the artist names that were present on two records amongst a pile upon his desk. Elements from Pal Joey and J Walter Negro.\n\nIf you’re looking to pick up this disco house classic, the original vinyl EP includes a few different remixes plus the full acapella, available on Discogs. Alternatively grab the digital version via Traxsource.\n\n12. Salif Keita & Martin Solveig – Madan (Exotic Disco Mix)\n\nThis next track was put together by Salif Keita — an internationally recognized Afro-Pop singer-songwriter from Mali, considered to have the ‘’Golden Voice of Africa’’– in collaboration with highly successful French house DJ/Producer Martin Solveig in 2002.\n\nBringing its unique afro-disco charm, ‘Maden’ was another massive success in clubland, particularly in certain European holiday destinations such as Spain and Portugal. The song peaked at No. 37 on the French Singles Chart and would later appear on various Hed Kandi compilations.\n\nIf you want to buy it, either grab the 4-track vinyl EP from Discogs or get the digital single from Traxsource.\n\n13. Shakedown – At Night (Original Version)\n\nAs far as classic funky house goes, I think it’s fair to say they don’t get much bigger than this! Shakedown was a house music project comprising of Swiss brothers Seb Kohler and Stephan Mandrax, with American singer-songwriter Terra Deva providing the vocals on this one.\n\nThis timeless classic was first released on ‘Sine Dance’ back in 2001, and later signed by Defected and other labels. The track reached No.1 in the UK Dance Charts and also the Australian Club Chart.\n\nYou can get the 12-inch vinyl on Panorama from 2002 (which includes the Original Club Mix featured below), or the digital version via Beatport.\n\n14. Steve Haines – Be With You (Feat. Carmen Anderson)\n\nWhilst you’d rarely associate the word ‘’Euphoria’’ with a house track, it’s probably the most fitting description for this next one! With help from Carmen Anderson on vocals, ‘Be With You’ was released on Hed Kandi in 2009 by UK electronic music DJ/producer Steve Haines.\n\nSince Hed Kandi’s inception in 1999, the UK label became best known for their disco house compilations (among other house sub-genres) and enjoyed meteoric success through the 2000s.\n\nWe couldn’t easily find a digital copy unfortunately, although you can grab the 12-inch vinyl over on Discogs.\n\n15. The Soul Seekerz – Electro Shock (The Soul Seekerz Electro Shock Remix)\n\nAnother piano house BOMB now that never gets old! This time from English dance music producer duo Soul Seekerz from 2005.\n\nThis track is a reworking of old skool Italian House classic ‘Shock The Beat’ by Electric Choc from 1990, which samples tracks from earlier back in the 80s.\n\nIf you want to add this to your collection, the 12-inch version is available on ‘in.stinct Recordings’ over on Discogs. Again, we couldn’t easily find a digital copy online, so you’ll have to go digging!\n\n16. Junior Jack – Stupidisco\n\nThis next track really needs no introduction …it’s by Italian DJ/Producer Junior Jack (real name Vito Lucente).\n\nVito is one of the prolific house music producers of this magical era. As a DJ, he dominated dancefloors across the globe, including his residency at Pacha in Ibiza, where he really came into his own as the master of his own sound for Defected.\n\nStupidisco was originally released on various labels including Defected back in 2004 and reached No.1 in the US Dance Chart. It’s part of the album ‘Trust It’, which also includes club hits such as ‘Thrill Me’, ‘Da Hype’ and ‘E Samba’.\n\nTo buy Stupidisco, head over to Discogs for a vinyl copy, or grab the digital version from Beatport.\n\n17. Future funk – Wildberry Tracks (Main Mix)\n\nWhen we think about Disco House classics, this track is right up there with the best of them! It was produced by German electronic music duo, Future Funk – originally released on their own label in 2004.\n\nWith its powerful, hypnotic soulful vocals, the track samples Barry White’s soul/funk/disco classic ‘Don’t Make Me Wait Too Long’ from 1976.\n\nIn addition to the ‘’Main Mix’’ we’ve featured below, the 12-inch EP includes three other edits. Alternatively, the digital version is available on Beatport.\n\n18. M&S Presents The Girl Next Door – Salsoul Nugget (If U Wanna)\n\nGoing by a number of different aliases during the early 90s/early 2000s, ‘M&S’ were a British music production team consisting of garage DJs Ricky Morrison and Fran Sidoli.\n\nOriginally released on vinyl in 2000, this track achieved significant commercial success, reaching the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart in 2001. It samples two disco classics from 1976: ‘Hit And Run’ by Loleatta Holloway and also ‘Everyman’ by Double Exposure.\n\nHead over to Discogs to grab the 12-inch vinyl EP, or check out various digital versions on Traxsource.\n\n19. Junior Jack – Thrill Me (Original Version)\n\nAnother disco-inspired classic from Junior Jack …Thrill Me was also featured on his album ‘Trust It’ – and a massive hit in clubland!\n\nIt was originally released on a few different labels in 2001 and contains a sample from electro-disco track “This Beat is Mine” by Vicky D from 1981.\n\nErick Morillo provided a vocal remix with Tera Diva, although we definitely prefer the original. You can grab both of those edits on the same vinyl EP via Discogs, or get the digital versions on Traxsource.\n\n20. Soulsearcher – Feelin’ Love (Original Mix)\n\nTo finish things off we’ve gone for ‘Feelin Love’ from Soulsearcher featuring vocals from legendary R&B diva Donna Allen. You might say it’s the ultimate feel-good house record!\n\nSoulsearcher was a project of Marc Pomeroy, a Florida-based house music producer who had earlier hits such as “Can’t Get Enough” in 1999, which also featured Donna on vocals.\n\nThis track was released on a handful of labels including Marc’s own ‘Soulfuric Deep’ label in 2003. You’ll find all the different digital versions on Traxsource, or you can grab the vinyl EP from Discogs.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith a whole decade to play with we were spoilt for choice when putting this list together — we could have easily included 100 tracks or more!\n\nParticularly for those of you born in the 1980s, I’m sure some of these tracks have a special place in your heart…\n\nWe hope you enjoyed the funk!\n\nRead this next: 20 of the best funky house classics from the mid-to-late 90s."
