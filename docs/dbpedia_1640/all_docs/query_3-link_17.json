        "text": "Deborah Bone, a British mental health nurse and the inspiration behind Pulp‘s hit single “Disco 2000,” passed away at the age of 51 on Tuesday (Dec. 30).\n\nAccording to local newspaper The Comet, Bone moved to Letchworth, a town in Hertfordshire, England, at the age of 10, and became friends with Jarvis Cocker, who would later become the frontman of Pulp. The Brit-pop group’s 1995 single “Disco 2000,” from the album Different Class, focuses on Cocker’s friendship with Bone and begins with the following verse:\n\n“Well we were born within one hour of each other.\n\nOur mothers said we could be sister and brother.\n\nYour name is Deborah, Deborah.\n\nIt never suited ya.\n\nAnd they said that when we grew up,\n\nwe’d get married, and never split up.\n\nWe never did it, although often I thought of it.”\n\nWhile Cocker went on to win international acclaim with Pulp, Bone became a pioneering mental health nurse, setting up the Step2 health service in Hertfordshire and developing the “Brainbox,” a tool to help young patients deal with anxiety. Before her death, Bone had been awarded an MBE — a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire — for her services to children and young people.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nCocker and Bone kept in touch since their shared childhood: the frontman reportedly performed “Disco 2000” at her 50th birthday party in 2013. Bone, who had been suffering from multiple myeloma (a form of bone marrow cancer), is survived by her husband Colin, daughters Jemima and Pollyanna, and grandson Elliot."
