A question to Pulp fans: Does anyone else have a copy of \"His 'N' Hers\" with an incorrect label on the B-side (The original 1994 vinyl version ILPS 8025, 524 005-1). I have a copy where the B-side label is from the preceding Island Records release ....so is mine the first out of the press and will Jarvis C come and sign it and play a few songs for me and my friends?\n\nPost here on Discogs describing in more detail:\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/866095\n\nHope you can help. Regards. Jesper\n\nHi, did any Pulp fans ever see them play at The Leadmill, Sheffield, England?\n\nWe are looking to interview or chat with any keen fans from England who have ever been to The Leadmill or know of Sheffields music community and Jarvis's relationship etc.\n\n6 Leadmill Road is a documentary that will focus on the iconic Night Club and Venue, in particular, the community surrounding its 36 year prominence.\n\nSince its opening in 1980, The Leadmill has quickly become one of the most notable and Iconic music venues in the UK. Garnering a range of awards in its time, this documentary aims to look at what it is about the Leadmill that makes it so popular as both a venue and nightclub. Talking to a range of contributors from those on the stage, to those behind it, to those in front of it, this film will delve into the legacy of The Leadmill and discover its status as an institution.\n\nIf you are interested or have any other information or stories/content etc, which you think would interest us, we would love to hear them, please email us at:\n\n6leadmillroad@outlook.com\n\nThanks,\n\n6 Leadmill Road Production Team\n\nFor those who played it, those who worked it, and those who lived it!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Leadmill.Documentary\n\nhttps://www.twitter.com/6LeadmillRoad\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/6leadmillroad\n\nHello,\n\nAs a fan of Pulp, I've visited this site quite a few times over the \"whizzing\" years. Something I'm about to work on maybe of interest to you fellow fans, and Russell Fans. Especially those in the Manchester area. Russell is in conversation (re: the \"Freak Out The Squares\" book), with (Writer and The Membranes vocalist) John Robb at the Louder Than Words Literary Festival at the Palace Hotel in Manchester on Saturday the 14th of November 2015. The informal talk runs from 2pm and is followed by a signing session. It's a ticketed affair, tickets can be purchased online in advance (I've put the link at the end of this whole message). I run a thing called BobArtModels, which alternates between paintings, and recyclable models. I shall be present over the long weekend (13th-15th) as the festivals Artist-In-Residence, illustrating some of the authors in attendance, some topics, and selling already existing works. Jarvis owns one of my creations, a friend purchased one for another friend, unbeknownst to me the latter friend was infact Candida. I hope this kind of tip off is helpful.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to email me via: bobartmodels@gmail.com. All best wishes, Bob.

I am a 3rd year PhD student at the Politics and International Relations department at Royal Holloway. My thesis is focused on the relationship between national identity (British identity) and popular music (British pop music). I strongly believe that Pulp played a key role in the representation of British identity in British pop music during the 1990's. That is why I am looking for Pulp fans who would like to do an interview with me and/or join a focus group as this will provide a great inside view into this interesting period of time.\n\nThe interview won't take long (30 minutes maximum), the focus groups will take a little longer (1 hour) and will take place in central London in August/September 2014. Since I am a student, I am unable to pay for the interviews but I offer a good time talking about great music and I will provide a little something to drink/eat. If you're interested please send me a quick email and I will get to you regarding date/time:\n\nClaudia.Lueders.2011@live.rhul.ac.uk\n\nMany thanks! looking forward to see you soon!\n\nClaudia\n\nThis may be of interest to some of you. I put on Pulp three times in Halifax when I ran the Return Club. The 1991 headline show was at the Piece Hall in Halifax and I've recently had an old video of the show converted to dvd. Having not seen it I didn't expect much but it's great! the sound quality is fine and Jarvis is in cracking form. The show itself was reviewed by Dave Simpson for Melody Maker.\n\nIn March of this year I'm launching the Halifax Music Heritage Trail and the film will be part of that (as well as a plaque unveiling to commemorate when Pulp played at North Bridge Leisure Centre. A website for the trail will be launched in the next couple of months but if anyone wants to know more about the trail, plaque unveiling or the film then do email me at hxmusictrail@gmail.com"
