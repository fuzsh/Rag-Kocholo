        "text": "Passionate purveyor of energetic pop-rock hits Panic! At The Disco is set to take over Wells Fargo Arena Tuesday for the Des Moines edition of the band’s “Death of a Bachelor” tour.\n\nThe first headlining arena tour for the Brendon Urie-fronted act in nearly 10 years (so, since the “Nine in the Afternoon” days), Panic! headlines Des Moines’ biggest indoor venue a year after the release of Urie and company’s fifth studio album, which bears the same name as the tour. “Death of a Bachelor” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 album sales charts, the first No. 1 in the band career.\n\nHere's a look at what you need to know before heading to the arena for the show.\n\nPeople really, really like that new record.\n\nAlong with topping the Billboard charts, “Death of a Bachelor” marked the band’s second Platinum-certified record, selling more than one million copies. Singles like “Victorious” and “Hallelujah” have earned tens of millions of plays on Spotify and YouTube and Urie has delivered raucous performances on national television shows such as “Ellen” and “Conan.” The record received a Grammy Award nomination for “Best Rock Album” in 2017.\n\nIn a post on Facebook, Urie called the record “the beginning of a new era [and] a homage to how it all began.” Tracks on the record like “Emperor’s New Clothes” and “Golden Days” boast bombastic choruses, while a track such as “Death of a Bachelor” mashes modern pop with elements of flamboyant swing music.\n\nThe band’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” cover isn’t terrible.\n\nCovering Queen isn’t easy. Actually, covering Queen (and doing it well) is a rare accomplishment for any modern act. Panic! covered “Bohemian Rhapsody” for the summer 2016 blockbuster “Suicide Squad” soundtrack … and didn’t butcher it. Urie (the sole original member remaining in the band) and his group has been performing the cornerstone rock number for years live and fans should expect to see the full-throttle rendition in Des Moines.\n\n“ … the track moves and breathes much like the original, with little tweaks to background vocal levels and the volume of the guitar riff when it first kicks in,” pop culture website The Nerdist said when the track dropped last summer.\n\nRELATED: Panic! at the Disco covers 'Bohemian Rhapsody'\n\nYou can start the party early.\n\nConcert organizers suggest getting to downtown early to avoid rush hour traffic on I-235. Street parking in downtown Des Moines is free after 6 p.m. and a number of spaces are available in the lots north of Wells Fargo Arena for $8 a vehicle. Multiple parking garages can also be found within walking distance of the arena. View a full list of parking garages and options at downtowndesmoines.com.\n\nShow-goers who do make the trip downtown early could take advantage of a happy hour special such as $2 pizza slices and $4 craft beers at Fong’s or half-off social plates at Goldfinch. The show is scheduled to start at 7 p.m.\n\nDon’t forget about the opening acts.\n\nThe show is slated to feature two opening acts, Saint Motel and Misterwives. Saint Motel, an indie pop band from Los Angeles, released its sophomore album, “saintmotelevision,” in October 2016 and saw the single “Move” land in the top 5 on Billboard’s adult alternative song chart.\n\nMisterwives, an indie rock act from New York City, is set to release its second studio record, “Connect The Dots,” in May. The group released its latest single, “Machine,” last month.\n\nExpect a mix of new and old.\n\nReviews from the “Death of a Bachelor” tour show that Panic! has been pulling from all 12 years of the group’s popularity. Deep cuts from the band’s breakthrough debut “A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out,” as well as a healthy number of songs from the new record have made the tour’s setlist. Fan-favorite singles such as “Nine in the Afternoon” and “Miss Jackson” have also made it into the show.\n\nSome critics have noted the show’s crowds are representative of the band’s two generations of fans. Billboard summed this up in a review of the tour: ““Death of a Bachelor” … garnered a younger fanbase, like the one Panic! captivated with its first album, 2006's “A Fever You Can't Sweat Out,” and both demographics came together for this tour — proving that Urie has managed to keep the momentum alive and revive the initial success the group had.”\n\n… And, yes, the band doesn’t leave the stage without giving fans “I Write Sins Not Tragedies.”\n\nRELATED: 11 must-see concerts in Des Moines this March\n\nPanic!
