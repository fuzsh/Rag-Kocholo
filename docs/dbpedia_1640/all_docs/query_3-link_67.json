        "text": "Deborah Bone, a nurse and muse of Jarvis Cocker, has died from bone cancer aged 51.\n\nBone was awarded an MBE in the New Year's Honours list for her services to children and young people just hours after she passed away. She set up a series of innovative services for young people and children sufffering from anxiety and stress.\n\nHowever, Bone was best known to pop fans for inspiring the Pulp frontman and songwriter to write Disco 2000, the band's Top 10 song which was released in 1995.\n\nBone wrote on her blog, My Myeloma Journey, in which she wrote about her illness: \"Born in Sheffield, my claim to fame is growing up and sleeping with Jarvis Cocker, well someone had to do it, and it was all perfectly innocent!\n\nI have been told and like to believe that I am the Deborah in the Number 1 hit Disco 2000 but we never did get to meet up by the fountain down the road.\"\n\nThe lyrics to Pulp's song about unrequited love describes how Cocker and a girl called Deborah grew up together, and that he nurtured a fondness for her. The chorus asks: \"I said let's all meet up in the year 2000. Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown. Be there at 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road.\"\n\nAs the song says, Bone did get married. Her second husband and \"soul mate\" Colin paid tribute to her this week in Herfordshire's regional paper, The Comet: \"What made Deborah different from others is once she identified the problem she set about finding answers. With characteristic determination and drive, she went on to create the solution.\"\n\n\"I shall be so proud to attend the MBE award ceremony on her behalf accompanied by her daughter Pollyanna who is following in her motherâ€™s footsteps working for the NHS and already achieving national recognition.\""
