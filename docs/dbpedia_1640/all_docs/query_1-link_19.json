        "text": "Album supporting: This is Hardcore\n\nHeadline material: Yes and this time they were booked to headline from the start.\n\nBand/Artist who subbed: Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds. (Bob Dylan was before, a strong Sunday line-up.)\n\nWould I have attended: Very likely, although Joe Strummer was headlining the Other Stage which would have been tempting.\n\nI live in Plymouth and volunteer at the Plymouth Arts Centre, an independent cinema which has had to change a lot since I started their in 2014. In 2017, the Arts Centre also exhibited art from local and national artists and some would come down to present short films or host talk sessions. When I arrived in March 2017 to start my shift as an usher, half an hour before the film began, unbeknownst to me, I ended up being in the same room as someone who had headlined the Pyramid Stage..twice!\n\nPulp guitarist Mark Webber was hosting a talk on Plymouth born artist Malcolm Le Grice and the London Filmmaker’s Co-op. The Co-op was a British film-making workshop founded in 1966 and ended in 1999. Le-Grice founded the workshop and is known for avant-garde filmmaking. I knew nothing about this when I turned up, but as I was taking my usual place in the cinema, I realised I recognised this unassuming, bespectacled man talking with some of the bigwigs of the Art Centre. When I realised, I couldn’t be more excited and was chuffed that I had been within a couple of metres of someone I had seen perform onstage in front of me at Reading 2011 and who had the rare opportunity of headlining Glastonbury twice.\n\nPulp’s performance at the 1998 Glastonbury festival has faded from public consciousness. Their triumphant 1995 performance is their defining live show, and it is the one that is broadcast, (like it was this year) and most talked about. This is the case for every headline performance this festival. Blur’s defining moment was in 2009 and Primal Scream have played so many times since that their Pyramid headline performance has been scrapped from the history books almost.\n\nContrary to this, after watching some of the performance on YouTube and obtaining a copy of This is Glastonbury, a bonus disc on their 1998 album This is Hardcore, it is a thoroughly enjoyable performance. Jarvis’ banter is just as entertaining, and they lean heavily on the This is Hardcore album. They almost play the whole album. I was shocked that they neglected to play Disco 2000 which would have gone down a storm at the gig. This choice though, makes it more interesting for my purposes as I’m not treading on familiar ground, but I am curious as to how the more casual Pulp fan would have regarded it.\n\nThe songs on This is Hardcore are dark, difficult and rather ‘out there.’ It is a long album, and it is only on multiple listens that I now consider it as good or if not potentially better than His ‘n’ Hers or Different Class. The crowd certainly seem receptive, but I wonder if it would have been a tad disappointing if you were more of a casual fan. There weren’t many big songs the new album. Well there are but it is a bit of a grower of an album. They mostly ignore His N Hers and they only play token Different Class songs, and the crowd are obviously most excited during the grand finale of Common People.\n\nIt is, however, the strongest headline performance of that year. Jarvis commands the stage as always and the songs from their latest album sound ginormous. It is a shame they haven’t headlined since. After their 2002 We Love Life album, Pulp would disband before reuniting in 2011 with their excellent reunion shows and after 2012, they would cease to exist once more. At Glastonbury 1998 it seemed they could do anything and would go on for a lengthy amount of time. Instead, it would mark the beginning of the end of Pulp’s popularity and Britpop’s domination of the music industry."
