        "text": "Sweet Child O' MineGuns N' Roses\n\n\"Sweet Child O' Mine\" is about Erin Everly, who was Axl Rose's girlfriend at the time. She is the daughter of Don Everly of the Everly Brothers.\n\nNothin' On YouB.o.B\n\nWhen \"Nothin' On You\" reached #1 on the Hot 100, B.o.B became the first American act whose name is a palindrome to top the chart. The other two who did so prior to the Atlanta rapper were both Scandinavian groups - ABBA and A-Ha.\n\nLife During WartimeTalking Heads\n\nThe 1979 song \"Life During Wartime\" by Talking Heads deals with how technology could be exploited to take down the framework of society and enable government surveillance.\n\nPegSteely Dan\n\n\"Peg\" by Steely Dan is told from the perspective of Peg's jilted ex-boyfriend as he watches her launch an acting career.\n\nWhere Did Our Love GoThe Supremes\n\nHolland-Dozier-Holland originally wrote \"Where Did Our Love Go\" with The Marvelettes in mind, but they turned it down. Marvelettes lead singer Gladys Horton sang in a lower key than Diana Ross, so when The Supremes came to record the tune, Ross was forced to sing in a lower, breathier style than she was used to.\n\nMovie Stars In Music VideosSong Writing\n\nJohnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, Mila Kunis and John Malkovich are just a few of the film stars who have moonlighted in music videos.\n\nAdeleFact or Fiction\n\nDespite her reticent personality, Adele's life and music are filled with intrigue. See if you can spot the true tales.\n\nSarah BrightmanSongwriter Interviews\n\nOne of the most popular classical vocalists in the land is lining up a trip to space, which is the inspiration for many of her songs."
