Our mothers said we could be sister and brother. Your name is Deborah, Deborah. It never suited ya. And they said that when we grew up, we'd get married, and never split up. We never did it, although often I thought of it. Oh Deborah, do you recall? Your house was very small, with wood chip on the wall. When I came around to call, you didn't notice me at all. And I said let's all meet up in the year 2000. Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown. Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road. I never knew that you'd get married. I would be living down here on my own, on that damp and lonely Thursday years ago. You were the first girl at school to get breasts. Martyn said that you were the best. The boys all loved you, but I was a mess. I had to watch them trying to get you undressed. We were friends, that was as far as it went. I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant, oh, it meant nothing to you, ''cause you were so popular. Deborah do you recall? Your house was very small, with woodchip on the wall. When I came around to call, you didn't notice me at all. I said let's all meet up in the year 2000. Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown. Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road. I never knew that you'd get married, I would be living down here on my own, on that damp and lonely Thursday years ago. Oh yeah, Oh yeah. Ah do you recall? Your house was very small, with wood chip on the wall. When I came around to call, you didn't notice me at all. And I said let's all meet up in the year 2000. Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown. Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road. I never knew that you'd get married, I would be living down here on my own, on that damp and lonely Thursday years ago. Oh what are you doing Sunday baby. Would you like to come and meet me maybe? You can even bring your baby. Ohhh ooh ooh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. What are you doing Sunday baby. Would you like to come and meet me maybe? You can even bring your baby. Ooh ooh oh. Ooh ooh ooh ooh.
