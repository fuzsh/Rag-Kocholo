        "text": "“Pulp: A Film About Life, Death & Supermarkets” puts a neighborhood spin on the typical rock documentary. Though there are the expected scenes of the Britpop rockers performing onstage and discussing their careers, the film is largely an affectionate look at the Pulp’s fans and its hometown, Sheffield, England.\n\n“I always thought that these days, if you want to know the whole story of Pulp, you can look at Wikipedia,” said the director Florian Habicht, 39. “We didn’t want to make a traditional film, where the band is like God, and there’s separation between them and the fans.”\n\nMr. Habicht’s egalitarian approach to the documentary, which opens nationwide on Wednesday and for digital rental and download on Nov. 21, seems well suited to a band like Pulp, whose witty, literate anthems on class struggle and sexuality were touchstones of the 1990s British rock scene.\n\nThe film is framed around a rousing concert in Sheffield in December 2012, the last stop in Britain on the band’s international reunion tour. The group had gone on hiatus shortly after the release of its seventh album, “We Love Life,” in 2001. Footage of the Sheffield show is woven throughout the film. Viewers see Jarvis Cocker, the band’s charismatic frontman, preening and dancing wildly as he sings its biggest hit, “Common People,” while his boisterous audience howls the chorus back at him.\n\nElsewhere, Mr. Habicht’s camera captures a host of colorful local characters: newspaper vendors, fishmongers and knifemakers as well as precocious children and philosophical pensioners. One young man in smeared glam-rock makeup pokes fun at the close-knit community in his hometown, saying, “You’ll usually know the person that’s mugging you.” Mr. Habicht prompts a still-dripping swimmer to recreate Mr. Cocker’s trademark haughty stage poses, and he chats with a coterie of Mr. Cocker’s giggling female fans as they wait at the gates of the concert.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
