        "text": "Jarvis Cocker's lyrical genius has always been a big part of Pulp's excellence. Finding inspiration in Sheffield's teenage bedrooms, decaying flats in London's East End and, of course, while studying at St Martins College, Cocker has captured beauty in the seedy side of British life. The mass singalongs Pulp inspired at this summer's festivals were a testament to the power of his words.\n\nThis week Faber and Faber is publishing an anthology of Pulp lyrics, Mother, Brother, Lover, recognising the songs as poems in their own right. Cocker, who has just signed up as an editor-at-large for the publisher, has also written an introductory essay on the art of lyric writing and his fascination with poetry. An edited version is in Monday's G2 and on guardian.co.uk/music, along with a Jarvis Cocker interview by Decca Aitkenhead. There is also a video of Cocker returning to his old school, where Pulp played their first ever gig, to talk to pupils and return some overdue library books.\n\nTo mark Jarvis day on the site, we asked some musicians and poets what their favourite Pulp lyric is and why. Here is what they picked:\n\nBilly Bragg\n\nI want to sleep with common people like you.\n\nWell what else could I do - I said I'll see what I can do.\n\n- Common People\n\n\"I like my rock on the wry side, but self-knowledge was in short supply during the Britpop era. I love what Jarvis does here, the knowing wink to the audience, making us aware that he knows he's on to a good thing and inviting us to watch him milk it for all its worth.\"\n\nRussell Lissack from Bloc Party\n\nI never knew that you'd get married.\n\nI would be living down here on my own\n\non that damp and lonely Thursday years ago.\n\n- Disco 2000\n\n\"Disco 2000 is one of my all time favourite songs. Even as a teenager I found it amazing that the lyrics made me feel the emotions of a life I'd never lived.\"\n\nGareth from Los Campesinos!\n\nThe crowd gasp at Cocker's masterful control of the bicycle,\n\nskillfully avoiding the dog turd outside the corner shop.\n\nImagining a blue plaque, above the place\n\nI first ever touched a girl's chest\n\n- I Spy\n\n\"Everything that makes Cocker so excellent, in the space of 15 seconds. Picking out the beautiful detail in the ugly and mundane, a perverted mind and a dollop of self mythologising. To me, Cocker always seemed to be the axis on which his tales spun, like nobody from the outside looking in could possibly see it and tell it like he does.\"\n\nKate Jackson, former singer of the Long Blondes\n\nThe world is going on outside, the night is gaping open wide\n\nThe wardrobe and the chest of drawers are telling her to go outdoors\n\nHe should have been here by this time, he said that he'd be here by nine\n\nThat guy is such a prick sometimes, I don't know why you bother, really.\n\n- Sheffield: Sex City\n\n\"I like the way Jarvis uses Sheffield as a character in his lyrics. Sheffield is like another woman, a soft umbrella under which all his stories play out. Sheffield is all encompassing, taunting cheekily, inviting us out or telling us to stay in. I wanted to be there when I heard this song, so I moved there! Sheffield: Sex City has all the elements of a classic Jarvis lyrical narrative: humour, sexual frustration and unrequited love.\"\n\nLemn Sissay, poet\n\nI wrote the song two hours before we met.\n\nI didn't know your name or what you looked like yet.\n\nOh I could have stayed at home and gone to bed.\n\nI could have gone to see a film instead.\n\nYou might have changed your mind and seen your friends.\n\nLife could have been very different but then,\n\nsomething changed.\n\n- Something Changed\n\n\"Jarvis Cocker is a poet: you could perform Something Changed at any literary salon. 'Something changed' means everything changed; it's subtle and seismic to the piece. Set against the verses, the two words gain momentum and accumulate power. It's a grand understatement, a deft lyrical move. Everyday language of the common people is rich with opportunities for exploration. Take a phrase, look at it on the page and something changes.\"\n\nCaitlin Rose\n\nIt's hard to believe that you go for that stuff\n\nAll those baby-doll nighties with synthetic fluff\n\n- Pink Glove\n\n\"The rest of the verse is ace, but this is such a perfect little couplet. Immediately it turns kink into cliche and sounds equal parts callous and caring. That air of tender disapproval is what attracted me to the band in the first place and you can hear it in other songs of theirs, but this is always the first line to pop into my head.\"\n\nMichael McKnight from Frankie and the Heartstrings\n\nIt's like a later Tom and Jerry\n\nwhen the two of them could talk;\n\nlike the Stones since the eighties;\n\nlike the last days of Southfork\n\nLike Planet of the Apes on TV;\n\nthe second side of 'Til the Band Comes In;\n\nlike an own-brand box of cornflakes\n\nhe's going to let you down my friend\n\n- Bad Cover Version\n\n\"Quite possibly the worlds greatest analogy (or 6) and can be regurgitated in any conversation to describe anything that's a massive disappointment. However Sainsbury's own brand cornflakes do have their merits. Maybe they've improved their recipe since the line was written. Regardless, the song's incredible.\"\n\nNapoleon IIIrd\n\nAnd as I touch your shoulder tonight this room has\n\nbecome the centre of the entire universe.\n\n- F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E.\n\n\"I first heard this song when I was at school, before I'd ever even kissed a girl. It summed up the first time I did, in a cold tent in Wales whilst doing the Duke of Edinburgh award.\"\n\nTim Clare, poet\n\nIt was on the fifteenth floor,\n\nIt had a board across the door.\n\nIt took an hour to pry it off and get inside.\n\nIt smelt as if someone had died;\n\nthe living-room was full of flies\n\n- Mile End\n\n\"These lyrics went round my head when I came back to my grotty flat in Cambridge and encountered a dreadful stench. I later found out someone really had died (our upstairs neighbour) - hence the flies. Still, it felt like a bit of an adventure.\"\n\nRoxanne Clifford from Veronica Falls\n\nMister, we just want your car,\n\ncos we're taking a girl to the reservoir\n\n- Joyriders\n\n\"Somehow this sentence manages to be funny, ominous and poignant all at once. I love how he makes the banal sound exiting.\"\n\nOlly Joyce from Peggy Sue\n\nYou see you should take me seriously.\n\nVery seriously indeed.\n\nCause I've been sleeping with your wife for the past sixteen weeks,\n\nsmoking your cigarettes,\n\ndrinking your brandy,\n\nmessing up the bed that you chose together.\n\nAnd in all that time I just wanted you to come home unexpectedly one afternoon,\n\nand catch us at it in the front room.\n\n- I Spy\n\n\"With just a few words Cocker manages to conjure up an image of middle class domesticity. That of the brandy swilling, cigarette smoking, gentleman who spends his weekends buying beds for his wife at DFS. What is great about Cocker as a lyricist is he allows you to project your own thoughts and fantasies onto his text. Cocker writes about society in a way we can all empathise with. This idea is in the sleeve notes of the album: 'Please understand - we don't want no trouble. We just want the right to be different. That's all.' All those who buy Pulps records are invited to be a Different Class.\"\n\nSo now it's over to you. Which Pulp line most moves or amuses you? What does it remind you of and why is it so great?
