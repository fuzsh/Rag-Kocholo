        "text": "When seminal Palm Desert outfit Kyuss called it a day in 1995, few would have predicted that towering, red-headed guitarist Josh Homme would pivot to form one of the most popular and influential bands of the next 25 years. Effectively a one-man show at its outset, Queens Of The Stone Age was originally dubbed Gamma Ray, but the German power-metallers of the same name forced a change. Reworking a nickname given by legendary producer Nick Goss (‘Kings Of The Stone Age’) into something less aggressively macho, the eventual QOTSA moniker would be emblematic of the sex and swagger with which they would take over the world.\n\n“Rock should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls,” Josh explained in interviews early on. “That way everyone's happy and it's more of a party.”\n\nStaying true to the collaborative nature of the scene that spawned them, there’s been something of a revolving-door membership around Josh, with luminaries like Kyuss bandmate and Mondo Generator-frontman Nick Oliveri, Nirvana / Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl, Screaming Trees legend Mark Lanegan and great keyboardist Natasha Shneider coming and going. Particular credit should go to guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, though, who’s been a constant since 2002 and has done much to maintain focus on their sense of effortlessly thrusting cool. QOTSA’s unwavering cool factor is the one constant across this low-slung Top 20: that inimitable aura of knowing they’re the very best at what they do without ever really appearing to give a damn…\n\nFeaturing the dream team of Josh Homme, Dave Grohl, Mark Lanegan and Nick Oliveri, the third Queens Of The Stone Age LP was jam-packed with bangers that could easily tower over the catalogues of lesser bands. Third single First It Giveth fits that bill. Playing on an extract from The Book Of Job (“The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away”), its lyrics are a bittersweet examination of how drugs can be an inspirational force for musicians, but how they eventually negate that influence and leave said musicians too washed-out to actually perform. Its music video – a compilation of live clips from the time – lives long in the memory for its footage of scary Nick onstage in the nude.\n\n‘I want God to come and take me home,’ Josh sings on the funereal, piano-led third single from 2013’s …Like Clockwork, harking back to a near-death experience that changed his perspective on the world. Going in for a routine knee surgery in 2010, there was no reason for the frontman to be afraid, but on finding out that his heart had momentarily stopped on the operating table – thanks to years of touring and drug abuse – he was knocked into a darker place, ruminating on the fragility of life and how suddenly one can stumble off the mortal coil. The understated insidiousness, splashes of acidic synth and conclusive declaration of ‘I'm alive – hooray!’ suggest he still found some wry amusement in the troubling ordeal.\n\nComing on like a wavy surf-rock deep cut from some lost Quentin Tarantino soundtrack album, there’s a curiously timeless quality to 2002’s brilliant Another Love Song. With Nick on lead vocals (proving he was capable of far more than his barked contributions elsewhere) and featuring e-bow, organ, and tremolo-loaded lead guitar, it felt like a tantalising departure from QOTSA norms and a perfect addition to Songs For The Deaf’s mixtape-alike station-hopping concept. Those sticky, romantic lyrics, however (‘Now the time has come to leave this love that's left you dry / No need to work this out now ’cause you know there's no reason why’) were very much on brand.\n\nBefore Rated R, Josh has admitted that his lyrics were tightly guarded and often impenetrable on purpose to avoid having to bare himself to the world. On the second album, however, he “wore the feather boa” and gave fans a closer look at what exactly was going on inside his head. Brilliantly, this included Monsters In The Parasol: a first-person account of tripping balls on LSD and, er, seeing a monster in a parasol. Powered by route-one stoner-rock riffs and delivering even its most absurdist lyrics (‘Paul's sister is an alien, oh well / I seen some things I thought I never saw / Covered in hair’) in brilliant deadpan, it’s a leftfield narcotic delight.\n\nThe chemistry between the core Queens trio on Songs For The Deaf – Josh Homme, Nick Oliveri and Dave Grohl – was evident right from the album’s ragged opening track. A simple driving beat, pointed six strings pierce through, then the pounding bassline kicks into gear and we’re really in business. From the fuzzy riffs and bursts of handclap percussion to that audacious fake-out ending at the 2:40 mark, this is the sound of a band high on their own confidence. It’s the contrast between Nick’s ragged vocals (‘Metal heavy, soft at the core / Gimme toro, gimme some more’) and Josh’s smoother croon that really lets fans know they’re in for an album above and beyond.\n\n“Here is something for you to drop to your knees for and worship…” announces the mysterious DJ as Songs For The Deaf topples over into song number 13: its sort-of title-track. And she’s not kidding. A strange, five-minute masterwork constructed of layer upon layer of pulsating bass, pounding drums, ear-rattling feedback, duelling vocals and sheer demonic intensity, it is probably the most daringly dense and heavy QOTSA have ever sounded. Veering from the abrasive malevolence of the verses (‘The blind can go get fucked / Lie beside the ditch / This halo round my neck / Has torn out every stitch’) to an oddball chorus that flirts with catchiness (‘And I got what was / I want to take what's left’), this Song For The Deaf is genuinely hard to get your ears around – and all the better for it.\n\nFollowing the career high of Songs For The Deaf and the recruitment of new collaborators Troy Van Leeuwen and Joey Castillo, Lullabies To Paralyze saw QOTSA struggling to meet almost impossible expectations, but lead single Little Sister was a hell of a place to start. Inspired by the 1961 Elvis Presley single of the same name, yet loaded with far more 21st century innuendo (‘Hey little sister, can I come inside, dear?’), its stabbing riffs and thudding jam block (a plastic cowbell) re-hooked listeners right out of the gate. In a show of outrageous talent and raw chemistry, it was apparently recorded in one take, too.\n\nThere was a dark, meditative woundedness bleeding through broad tracts of 2013’s …Like Clockwork, but fourth single Smooth Sailing felt like an outrageous statement of self-confidence. ‘I got bruises and hickies / Stitches and scars,’ Josh declares at one point, spitting over some massive blues licks and canyon-sized funk grooves. ‘Got my own theme music / It plays wherever I are.’ A few verses later he’s stroking that OTT braggadocio further still: ‘I blow my load / Over the status quo / Here we go!’ Perhaps it’s an observation on the ridiculousness of rock star ego. Perhaps not. Either way, it’s an absolute blast. Hiro Murai’s music video – where Josh enjoys a really wild night with some Japanese salary men – is a devilishly debauched classic.\n\nIn contrast, absolutely fucking everyone has heard the lead single from Songs For The Deaf. Josh had apparently been toying with the base idea for years before it properly clicked, but when it finally did it would catapult his band to superstardom. Dropping on music TV in late 2002, fans were taken by the crazily catchy jauntiness of it all, by Dave’s thunderous drums, and by Dean Karr / Michel Gondry’s high-concept video where a deer gets its revenge on a group of hunters. Almost two decades down the line it’s still a fan-favourite and rock club staple, thanks to its outsider attitude, a brilliant rhythmic focus and lightning-in-a-bottle interplay between a group of the finest musicians of their generation at the top of their game. Would QOTSA ever have gotten where they are today without this all-time banger? No one knows…"
