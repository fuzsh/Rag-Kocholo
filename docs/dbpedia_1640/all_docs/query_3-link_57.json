The book features (mostly) original contributions by various different authors including Pat Cadigan, Grant Morrison, Robert Anton Wilson, and Douglas Coupland.\n\nThe book includes Bill Drummond’s short story ‘Let’s Grind (or How K2 Plant Hire Ltd Went To Work)‘. The companion album released alongside the book furthermore features 2K’s Fuck The Millennium.\n\nDespite its name the book is – unsurprisingly – in no way related to the KLF side project of the same name.\n\nBack Cover Blurb\n\nThe party starts here… with a cast of crazy scientists, nomadic DJs, fetish queens, conspiracy theorists, killer ants, graffiti artists, gangsters, convicts, cult leaders, Netheads, repilcants, religious maniacs and ball room dancers.\n\nIs it worth getting?"
