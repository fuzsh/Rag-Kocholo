        "text": "French house classics will never go out of style. Really, these songs have paved the way for modern dance music in many respects, influencing a new wave of disco-inspired producers to enter the scene.\n\nTo honor the filter-friendly genre, we’ve compiled a hand-picked selection of 20 french house classics from the early 2000s, featuring songs from Daft Punk, Fred Falke, Modjo, Play Paul and more. Tune in below.\n\nFrench House Classics Song List:\n\nEtienne de Crécy – Am I Wrong\n\nRaw Man – Europa\n\nSedat The Turkish Avenger – Fist Funk\n\nDaft Punk – High Life\n\nRomanthony – Hold On\n\nPlay Paul – Holy Ghostz\n\nCerrone – Hysteria\n\nBob Sinclar – I Feel For You\n\nBenjamin Diamond – In Your Arms (We Gonna Make It)\n\nModjo – Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\n\nSuperfunk – Lucky Star\n\nLe Knight Club – Nymphae Song\n\nDaft Punk – One More Time\n\nAlan Braxe & Fred Falke – Palladium\n\nSébastien Léger – Rapsody\n\nDJ Mehdi – Signatune (Thomas Bangalter Edit)\n\nTogether – So Much Love To Give\n\nThe Supermen Lovers – Starlight\n\nTogether – Together\n\nDemon – You Are My High\n\nAm I Wrong\n\nProduced By: Etienne de Crécy\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Tribal energy, filter house vibes and funky rhythms – that’s exactly what you can expect in this Etienne de Crécy single. What more could you ask for? In short, Am I Wrong is four minutes of elegance and nonchalance, bundled into one.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nEuropa\n\nProduced By: Raw Man\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Raw Man is a staple in the french house scene, with a number of releases on Crydamoure, Kitsuné, We Rock Music and more. 2003 release, Europa, is just one of many hits from the talented producer, fusing smooth synths with upbeat disco.\n\nClick to Stream\n\nFist Funk\n\nProduced By: Sedat The Turkish Avenger\n\nWhy You Should Listen: When we covered Sedat The Turkish Avenger’s best tracks, we forgot to include disco-charged banger, Fist Funk. In what can only be described as high-powered filtered funk, the 7-minute track will undoubtedly keep you dancing all night long.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nHigh Life\n\nProduced By: Daft Punk\n\nWhy You Should Listen: This french house classics list wouldn’t be complete without an appearance from robotic duo, Daft Punk. Would you agree? The Frenchmen are arguably the most highly-acclaimed musicians in the genre, with more than 25 years of production under their belts. And, High Life is one magical track that we’ll never forget.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nHold On\n\nProduced By: Romanthony\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Romanthony is most well-known for his work with Daft Punk, having provided vocal treatment for blockbuster singles, Too Long and One More Time. Don’t discredit his solo work though. His releases on Roulé and Azuli Records are top-notch.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nHoly Ghostz\n\nProduced By: Play Paul\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Though many refer to him as Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo’s brother, Play Paul has some serious credibility in the music scene. His releases across Crydamoure and Kitsune alone are impressive enough, and his single, Holy Ghostz, really started it all.\n\nClick to Stream\n\nHysteria\n\nProduced By: Cerrone\n\nWhy You Should Listen: The music video for Cerrone’s Hysteria is interesting enough in itself. If that doesn’t entice you to tune in, the majestic sounds from the French disco superstar certainly will. The single is a hypnotic fusion of indie-pop vocals, soulful synths and crisp melodies. Lots of nostalgia with this one.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nI Feel For You\n\nProduced By: Bob Sinclar\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Bob Sinclar’s entire discography spans so many genres that it’s difficult to associate him with one music movement. That being said, we chose to focus on his earlier works, like I Feel For You, due to the funk frenzy those singles embodied. I Feel For You is one of many of his quintessential french house classics that’ll bring you right back to the early 2000s.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nIn Your Arms (We Gonna Make It)\n\nProduced By: Benjamin Diamond\n\nWhy You Should Listen: It’s time to slow things down a bit. Luckily, Benjamin Diamond has us covered with tasteful track, In Your Arms (We Gonna Make It). What’s really impressive about the french house song is the fusion of disco, jazz and soul in nothing less than flawless form.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nLady (Hear Me Tonight)\n\nProduced By: Modjo\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Let’s be honest – you knew that Lady (Hear Me Tonight) would feature in this list. Besides ranking number one on 10+ major music charts, the smooth song is downright amazing. Four minutes of perfection? We think so.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nLucky Star\n\nProduced By: Superfunk\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Superfunk’s Lucky Star has seen so many successes since its release in 2000. With more than 500,000 copies sold worldwide, the track has more than earned its place in this selection of french house classics. Simply put, it’s an intimate summertime love jam, with serious jazz, blues and disco energy. Oh, and if you enjoyed the original, check out Solomun’s remix too.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nNymphae Song\n\nProduced By: Le Knight Club\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Le Knight Club is Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo’s joint project with Pumpking Records label head, Eric Chédeville. To no surprise, the results of the partnership are no less than astounding. Mesmerizing rhythms and dance-driven grooves were to be expected, but perfection was the result. That’s certainly the case with french house jam, Nymphae Song.\n\nClick to Stream\n\nOne More Time\n\nProduced By: Daft Punk\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Yes, Daft Punk has a second feature in this list. Why? Because Daft Punk’s music is irresistible and we couldn’t leave out One More Time. As we mentioned time and time again, the collaboration between the Frenchmen and Romanthony is one that nobody will ever forget.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nPalladium\n\nProduced By: Alan Braxe & Fred Falke\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Speaking of collaborations, Alan Braxe and Fred Falke created quite an amazing track in 2002, titled Palladium. Remember the Vulture Music release? It has rocked nightclubs all around the world for more than 15 years.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nRapsody\n\nProduced By: Sébastien Léger\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Sébastien Léger’s Rapsody is truly something special. If french house wasn’t a genre, we’d characterize the 2000 release as dark and dirty funk with soul-pop accents. Looking for vintage vibes? Look no further.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nSignatune (Thomas Bangalter Edit)\n\nProduced By: DJ Mehdi\n\nWhy You Should Listen: First off, rest in peace DJ Mehdi. Your contributions to music will never be forgotten. Secondly, Thomas Bangalter’s edit of Signatune is captivating to say the least. It maintains this blade runner type of spirit in sound and style, and we can’t get enough of it.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nSo Much Love to Give\n\nProduced By: Together\n\nWhy You Should Listen: One listener said it best: “My favourite part of the song is when he sings ‘I’ve got so much love to give.'” Well, we’d have to agree. Out via Roulé Music, Together’s So Much Love To Give may be slightly repetitive in approach, but it’s the type of consistency that we appreciate.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nStarlight\n\nProduced By: The Supermen Lovers\n\nWhy You Should Listen: It’s said that The Supermen Lovers have tried to distance themselves from hit release, Starlight, in recent years to better showcase their full discography. Regardless, the song is one french house classic that no one will ever forget. From its catchy lyrics to its lush leads, Starlight will bring you on one of the best 4-minute funk adventures of all time.\n\nClick to Stream // Download\n\nTogether\n\nProduced By: Together\n\nWhy You Should Listen: Another Together release in this selection? That’s right. Following similar suit to So Much Love To Give, Together’s Together features some spellbinding resampling that’ll keep you entranced for years to come. And, if you really like it, check out this remix of the single by Le Castle Vania and Computer Club.\n\nClick to Stream\n\nYou Are My High\n\nProduced By: Demon\n\nWhy You Should Listen: And last, but not least, we have Demon’s single, You Are My High. In comparison to many other tracks in this list, You Are My High is much lesser known. But, one thing is certain – it’s just as good.\n\nClick to Stream // Download"
