        "text": "By Guy Mankowski.\n\nPulp / Richard Hawley 15th July 2023, Sheffield Utilita Arena, Sheffield\n\nPulp — a band who make the weird mainstream. Who make you dance to songs in which the singer more often than not fails to get the girl. Who make an art form of turning class warfare into public singalong. Sorely missed, and longed for during their live interregnum, before a 2023 tour became the holy ticket of the year.\n\nPulp fans seem a bit cooler than most fans. Tonight — a vintage rim to the sunglasses here, a modified T-shirt there, a retro print over by the window of the rammed, rain-sleeked tram that rumbled towards Sheffield Utilita for Pulp’s homecoming gig. Some Pulp fans were lucky enough to board the stylish Different Class bus most braved the storms, before being funnelled in.\n\nInside, adverts for Peter Kay and the cool air of an indoor hockey pitch. In orange letters flanking the stage it flashed up that Richard Hawley was playing. Unusually he began with his best known song, ‘Tonight The Streets Are Ours’, his rich, lugubrious voice filled a rapidly-filling stadium. It was no surprise that the much-loved Hawley (formerly of Sheffield indie-rockers Longpigs) was warmly received. What was more surprising with his set was the powerful dynamics of his songs and the sheer width of the sound. The familiar numbers like ‘Coles Corner’ were given away early on, building to a brief set of startling intensity. Given the depth of his lounge-singer voice, Hawley has an existential ability to mine the darker corners of human experience in his songs. Even if he has a stasis about his performing style that is not a problem for Jarvis Cocker the sheer epic quality of ‘Don’t Stare At The Sun’ and ‘Time Is’ made for a set satisfying in its vastness. Hawley has an ability to connect with the audience and express a sense of gratitude and occasion that is touchingly sincere. Tonight, this serves to root the crowd.\n\nAfter a break this was a sense built upon with the comfort nostalgia of Pulp’s font on the two vast screens. On them, Jarvis Cocker’s (remember when Chris Evans made him just ‘Jarvis’?) recognisable lexis told us ‘This is a night you will remember for the rest of your lives’. With artful gaps (‘Ok. We hear you’) via the screens Jarvis exhorted the audience to loudly bring on his crew. The long, Bond-inflected string introduction to ‘I-Spy’ placed us within a world in which lounge music met the nostalgic, melding into something ‘dirtier than that’ as Jarvis, to booming cheers, appeared.\n\nPowerfully silhouetted to assert his iconic presence, at the top of steps, his Cuban heels enhancing his height. He stepped with care, he tottered, his movement as precise as his skewering lyrics of class revenge. To hear a crowd sing ‘Take your year in Provence / shove it up your ass,’ in an era in which wealth and class inequality has never been more painfully stark was an arresting moment.\n\nDuring ‘I-Spy’ it became apparent how validated he is as a singer — the bitter, less likeable, revenge-fixated parts of his persona not just rendered communal but also a means by which to connect with an audience that is by and large devoted, music literate, literary. In lesser hands ‘Can’t you see a giant walks amongst you seeing through your petty lives?’ would sound solipsistic and arrogant. With Cocker, it sounds like a long-stifled voice fighting to heard.\n\nThis sense of connection, as well as a gesture to the sheer depth of Pulp’s back catalogue, is fast apparent when Jarvis encourages the crowd to do some ‘magic clapping’ and follow his lead to clap fast three times. Something which guitarist Mark Webber uses to ensure the crowd clap in perfect time to the three-stroke into riff to ‘Disco 2000’. Cue all the seats flanking the packed standing area to be vacated by instantly euphoric dancers. 15,000 people are on their feet singing along to a song landmarked by a fountain that was literally down the road. Goodwin Fountain in Fargate, Cocker tells us, before ‘the council went and fucking filled it in.’ We’re rooted in Sheffield, we’re rooted and welded as fans, and yet we’re reaching for places and times that at once feel out-of-reach and yet never more powerfully realised. And in their dazzling light show (rave strobes for ‘Sorted For E’s and Wizz’ and ‘Weeds II’, Cocker’s lyrical depth mirrored by the pyrotechnics) Pulp have mined their distinctive aesthetic for visuals that make tantalising souvenirs of the past. What we see on the stage and what we experience with the lights is no less than a visual banquet. It has the effect of making each song feel fully realised.\n\nIn this constant dialogue between past and current self via a band that has connected through the years, the effect is soon emotionally overwhelming. Pulp are now part-staffed live by tastefully retrained and effective Emma Smith (is it borderline blasphemous to notice that she plays Russell Senior’s parts with a little more deftness?) and the accomplished Andrew McKinney stepping in for Steve Mackey. But is it the sense of Senior and Mackey not being there, with Mackey cheered when he appears on screen, that starts to make these songs overwhelming? It was a sense that hit around the third song, ‘Mis-shapes’, and one I had frankly given up feeling at a gig. As a just-turned-forty gig goer I had assumed that people talking during songs, people drunkenly smashing into each other as they danced whilst shamelessly shouting the wrong words would mean that a transcendental feeling at a gig was no longer possible. (Incidentally, has the isolation of Covid enhanced this sense of wilful determination for some to self-indulge at gigs?) But the sheer number of heads visible at the gig (all with connections to songs you too are intimately engaged with) made for a moving experience. This sense of connection was made all the more overwhelming with the realisation that on the path between past and future forged with these songs people had been lost along the way. People in your lives who you bonded with to these songs. The dedication to Steve Mackey at the start of ‘Something Changed’ scaled up the emotions to an unbearable peak.\n\nThe darker tones of ‘Pink Glove’ slightly missed Mackey’s distinct, propulsive playing, and ‘Weeds’ and ‘Weeds 2’ saw an easing off of the intensity that was perhaps not unwelcome. The Eno-esque layers of ‘F.E.E.L.I.N.G. C.A.L.L.E.D. L.O.V.E.’ with its chattering, staccato drum parts brought us back into the sleek murk of Different Class. Cocker’s uncanny ability to exhume personal feelings of isolation is never rendered better than in the once-ropey-live-now-quite-powerful ‘Sorted For E’s and Wizz’, with everyone in the audience who’d lost their friends and who were now dancing alone surely feeling it acutely. Nick Banks came to the fore in the sleazy, off-kilter rhythm of ‘This Is Hardcore’, his range as a percussionist deeply impressive. ‘Babies’ and ‘Do You Remember the First Time’ retain that roller-coaster, euphoric sense of goose-bump provocation. Cocker languished on the speaker, evoking the sleeping narrator of ‘Sunrise’, which built to a visually dazzling, frenetic set-closer.\n\nCocker has always been deft at teasing the audience with encores. Like a prodigious and strange student appearing in front of an audition panel he gave a touching literary reading and then gave us the intimate start to ‘Like a Friend’ on a sparsely stroked electric guitar. The curtains parted for our first encore as the band kicked in. The glam-rock existentialism of ‘Underwear’ led to him teasing ‘have we forgotten a song? Styloroc Nites Of Suburbia?’ And the audience screamed for Pulp’s one number which defined an era. A song which captured the slippery false sense of transience between class-consciousness — ‘Common People’. Live, the band tease out its fallow periods and its climaxes. The sense of this being Ultimate Pulp — for all that has been lost — burrows home.\n\nIt is quite remarkable to that one person’s lyrical vision could so connect with these masses. It is a remarkable thing to hear as one voice a crowd sing a song in a manner familiar to them whilst its creator sings his own version at the heart of the storm.\n\nThe final encore saw the underrated ‘After You’ stripped of its synths, and the grandeur of ‘Razzamatazz’, its twisted lyrics becoming epic. That became the filmic, self-realising ‘Glory Days’. The former had always seemed too urban, too closed a note to end a set on.\n\nAnd so we were met with, in many ways the engine room of Pulp — Candida Doyle and Jarvis Cocker sat close together on the piano for an intimate rendering of the live debut of ‘Hymn Of The North’. It’s a song that was originally written by Cocker as a solo track for the 2019 play Light Falls by the playwright Simon Stephens. ‘We are in the north, so you should hear it first, ok?’ Cocker said, to roars of approval.\n\nSo much was said, and so much was shared, by Pulp People and for Pulp People."
