        "text": "Virgin Radio\n\n3 Nov 2022, 14:04\n\nCredit: Getty\n\nMake a note in your diary, because tickets to Pulp’s much anticipated performances at Latitude Festival, Isle of Wight Festival, and the rest of their reunion tour, all go on sale tomorrow.\n\nWith anticipation building towards the legendary band’s reunion next year, and with people gearing themselves up to try to get tickets this Friday morning (4th November), thoughts are inevitably turning towards what the band will play when they finally take to the stage for the first time since 2012.\n\nWhich tracks will fans be hoping for?\n\nHere are just a small selection of songs that would be great to hear in Pulp’s live set.\n\nCommon People\n\nLet's start with the obvious one. It would be something of a surprise to say the least if this wasn't included in their set!\n\nCommon People reached number two in the UK Singles Chart in 1995, becoming a defining track of the Britpop era and perhaps the song for which the Sheffield band are best known.\n\nBabies\n\nPerhaps Pulp’s biggest single before they released hit album Different Class, Babies actually failed to chart when it was first released in 1992. However, when re-released in 1994, it landed at number 19 on the UK singles chart, and it remains a fan-favourite.\n\nMis-Shapes\n\nThe opening track of Mercury-winning album, Different Class, Mis-Shapes is a rousing paean to the outcast. “Brothers, sisters, can't you see? / The future's owned by you and me.”\n\nRazzamatazz\n\nThe 1992 song focuses on an ex-girlfriend. Vocalist Jarvis Cocker sings: “Oh you knew it, and you blew it didn't you babe? / I was lying when I asked you to stay / Now no-one's gonna care / If you don't call them when you said.”\n\nThis Is Hardcore\n\nThis is the title track from Pulp’s 1998 album, which celebrates its 25th anniversary next year. The song includes a sample of the Peter Thomas Sound Orchestra's Bolero on the Moon Rocks, and is a distinct step away from the poppier sound of the band’s previous record, Different Class. At over six minutes long, it takes the listener on a creepy, dark journey.\n\nPink Glove\n\nTaken from 1994 album, His ‘n’ Hers, Pink Glove wasn’t a single, but is one of many strong tracks that the Mercury-nominated record holds. His ‘n’ Hers proved to be Pulp’s breakthrough record, reaching number nine on the UK Albums Chart, and paved the way for the success of next record, Different Class.\n\nDisco 2000\n\nWe've got a better idea... Let's all meet up in the year two thousand... and twenty three!\n\nFingers crossed for tickets tomorrow morning, and we'll see you down the front when this anthem belts out. We can't wait!\n\nLast week it was announced that Pulp would headline the 2023 Latitude Festival, which runs from 20th-23rd July at Henham Park in Suffolk. Its other two headliners will be Paolo Nutini and George Ezra.\n\nIt has since been announced that the band will also headline the Isle of Wight Festival 2023.\n\nPulp will also head on their own headline tour around the UK next year."
