        "text": "Don’t Forget the Songs-365: Mach Dos: Day 95\n\nFri. April 13, 2012\n\nDisco 2000\n\nPulp\n\n1995\n\n“♫ […] do you recall?/ our house was very small/ with wood-chip on the wall/ when I came round to call/ you didn’t notice me at all […] ♫”\n\nI was up late last night—reliving the glory of the Brit Pop 90’s. Does anybody else remember the night Jarvis Cocker got arrested for doing his “interruption dance” during Michael Jackson’s deity like performance on The Brit Awards circa 1996? That was right about the time Common People and Different Class blew up while Jarvis’ arrest made Pulp notorious.\n\nAlthough “Common People” is probably Pulp’s most popular hit, there’s something about the Laura Branigan “Gloria” inspired riff on “Disco 2000.” The thing that set Jarvis apart from most of his Brit Pop counterparts was the literary flavor of his lyrics. Cocker’s songs are little short stories spun into brilliantly bizarre li’l pop songs. “Disco 2000” is like Sheffield’s Cocker idea of a post modern Springsteen song.\n\nJarvis told BBC 6 Music the story behind Disco 2000: “I haven’t got much of a sense of imagination so a lot of our songs are just straight true stories – there was a girl called Deborah – she was born in the same hospital as me […] I fancied her for ages and then she started to become a woman and her breasts began to sprout so then all the boys fancied her then – I didn’t stand a ‘cat-in-hell’s chance’ – but then I did use to sometimes hang around outside her house and stuff like that. The only bit that isn’t true is the woodchip wallpaper.”\n\nBut the story doesn’t end there, Jarvis once complained—“People haven’t really covered Pulp songs. I don’t know why – maybe it’s because the lyrics are personal. Or maybe because they think the songs are rubbish!” Not true, Mr. Cocker. Jarvis’ fellow Leonard Cohen enthusiast Nick Cave did an extraordinary cover of Disco 2000 on 2001 “Bad Cover Version” single. Cave turned Cocker’s futuristic love song into a lovely classic waltz ballad."
