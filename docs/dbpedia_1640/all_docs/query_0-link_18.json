        "text": "Remember when everyone was partying like it was 1999 because it was, in fact, 1999? That was 10 years ago. Yes, the first decade of the 21st century-- \"The Aughts\"-- is coming to a close, and for music fanatics such as ourselves, that means it's a good time to make some lists. We round up our favorite albums, tracks, and videos at the end of every year, of course, but once in a while we go all-out and tackle an entire decade-- The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s, the Top 100 Albums of the 1990s, and so on. Since Pitchfork has been around for all of the 2000s, we're taking the opportunity to put together a detailed and wide-ranging story-- as told in four lists, four essays, and a timeline of events-- of what happened in music in the last 10 years. About what you'd get from a print magazine, but it's free and you won't throw it out the next time you move.\n\nOur list has 500 songs, but only 200 to 1 have written briefs; read to the end to see numbers 201-500.\n\n200.\n\nBeck: “Lost Cause” (2002)\n\nThe sad-sack, lost-love mumble of Sea Change is so thoroughly down, it’s hard to imagine it producing a single. But Beck managed to inject his stoic sorrow into a few catchy tunes, “Lost Cause” being the catchiest. Kind of the emotional inverse of “Loser”, it marries lyrical futility to an achingly circular melody, which goes up and down like stairs in an M.C. Escher drawing. The rest of Sea Change may be more hypnotic in its resigned sorrow, but “Lost Cause”, like the best mope-anthems, makes you nod along to sentiments that would otherwise have you hanging your head. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: Beck: “Lost Cause”\n\n199.\n\nPortishead: “The Rip” (2008)\n\nPerhaps the comeback of the decade. Portishead returned in 2008 and the space they’d carved out was somehow more removed and vacant than the phantom, fractured jazz and blues clubs suggested on their two previous records. That pulsing tone that opens the track could have been some dying transmission from one of Dummy’s analog synthesizers, yet the arpeggios that underpin the back half of the track sounded achingly contemporary. And threading a line between the 1990s and now was that voice, reminding us that nobody can spread multi-syllabic words of woe across bars of music quite like Beth Gibbons. –Matthew Solarski\n\nListen: Portishead: “The Rip”\n\n198.\n\nVitalic: “La Rock 01” (2001)\n\nBefore Justice and Daft Punk lit their megawatt crosses and pyramids in the name of all things distorted and danceable, there was Pascal Arbez aka Vitalic and his arena-ready take on four-down party spiking. Seemingly going for as many head bangs as hip flips, “La Rock 01” takes a pugilist’s mentality when it comes to dancefloor takeover-- put up a fight or get knocked out. Arbez pulled off the industrial-tinged techno attack a full four years before his famous French countrymen famously mangled their groove with 2005’s fuzzed-to-oblivion Human After All, and “La Rock 01” in particular sounds like the top of a blog-house family tree that’s still splitting bandwidth on a daily basis. And Arbez makes the machines work for him, whether they’re buzzing like bees on speedballs or causing EQ meters to snap into a billion pieces thanks to a what sounds like a demonic copy machine’s futuristic head-rush chomp. The 1990s promised a electro takeover of all things rock-- it didn’t happen. But Vitalic begins the decade by riding lightning as hard and fast as any musclebound fist-pumper-- and priming the formula that would eventually give rise to megawatt crosses and pyramids around the world. –Ryan Dombal\n\nListen: Vitalic: “La Rock 01”\n\n197.\n\nJoanna Newsom: “Peach, Plum, Pear” (2004)\n\nGet past That Voice, and that harpsichord, and all the quirks that make Joanna Newsom either catnip or poison to her admirers and detractors, and what you find here is one hell of a composition. The odd chord progression stays precisely the same for the entire song, but the melody “changes some,” in Newsom’s phrase. So does the tenor of its lyric, from the ooze and floozies and alliteration of its first few verses to the manic, bolting horse and internal assonance (and therefore suggestion of “whores”) in the last few. None of that is obvious at first, but all of it works in the service of the song’s needle-sharp emotional sting. –Douglas Wolk\n\nListen: Joanna Newsom: “Peach, Plum, Pear”\n\n196.\n\nNo Age: “Teen Creeps” (2008)\n\nIt’s tempting to hear “Teen Creeps” as a rant against No Age’s home, scene-defining L.A. venue the Smell. “I hate this place,” moans drummer Dean Spunt over guitarist Randy Randall’s gravity-pulled riffs. But the rallying, march-like feel of the track suggests that when Spunt insists, “I won’t end up like them at all,” he’s not pointing at his musical brethren, but scene come-latelys that “wash away what we create.” Or maybe the song isn’t that literal– certainly the music’s hazy hooks stand up to multiple interpretations. That’s the potency of No Age’s rough minimalism: it could mean almost anything, except nothing at all. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: No Age: “Teen Creeps”\n\n195.\n\nLove Is All: “Make Out Fall Out Make Up” (2003)\n\nLove Is All may specialize in songs that sound sharp and jagged, but their best single is more like a series of rounded upward curves, building up and crashing down like tidal waves confined to a kiddie pool. While the verses in “Make Out Fall Out Make Up” throb like a hangover headache, the choruses blare to the point of nearly collapsing into atonal cacophony, with Josephine Olausson’s trebly yelping rising above the din to absolutely nail the tune’s feeling of overwhelming romantic anxiety. –Matthew Perpetua\n\nListen: Love Is All: “Make Out Fall Out Make Up”\n\n194.\n\nDavid Banner: “Cadillac on 22’s” (2003)\n\nThis is what I figured a brilliant Kid Rock ballad could sound like: Big plastic beats, folksy steel-string guitar, and devotional verses about the heart of the streets. But Kid Rock was a clown and David Banner just turned out to be confused– a guy who earned his savings shouting about pussy and pimpin’ but privately ground his teeth over whether raps about pussy and pimpin’ were really what his community needed. His most detached lyric– “My folks still dumping, my music bumping but I feel nothing”– is also his most engaged. “Record companies don’t give a fuck about ’Cadillac on 22’s,’” he told Pitchfork’s Tom Breihan in a Village Voice interview. Sadly, it figures. –Mike Powell\n\nListen: David Banner: “Cadillac on 22’s”\n\n193.\n\nTwista: “Slow Jamz” [ft. Kanye West and Jamie Foxx] (2004)\n\nIt’s easy to forget these days, but Kanye West– self-serious megastar with a laser-light show and an androgynous girlfriend– was once funny as hell: The two-liner here about Michael Jackson is a great, simple gag, made even better by Kanye’s barely suppressed giggle. The concept of “Slow Jamz”, it being a slow jam about slow jams that namedrops slow jams, could have been a groaner, but young Kanye’s easy charm saves it, and the lite-jungle breakbeat and Twista’s hyperlogia saves the song from just being Jamie Foxx’s karaoke homage. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: Twista: “Slow Jamz” [ft. Kanye West and Jamie Foxx]\n\n192.\n\nPulp: “Sunrise” (2001)\n\nThere were two fitting epitaphs to Pulp. The first is the “Bad Cover Version” video, a charity song send-up with celebrity musician look-alikes paying tribute to Pulp’s musical legacy; the other– “Sunrise”, the final song on the group’s We Love Life album– wasn’t so celebratory. After spending 20 years chasing fame, Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker realized it didn’t suit him much, releasing first the 1997 hangover LP This Is Hardcore and then the more introspective and conflicted Life. “All my achievements...range from pathetic to piss-poor,” Cocker claims before celebrating the titular sunrise of early semi-retirement. The band itself didn’t seem to want to go as patiently into that good night, closing the song with three minutes of its most ferocious work, a snarling, climatic build and a fitting send-off for one of the more creative acts of our time. –Scott Plagenhoef\n\nListen: Pulp: “Sunrise”\n\n191.\n\nVampire Weekend: “Oxford Comma” (2008)\n\nThere’s plenty about “Oxford Comma” that screams “Kitsch!”: that Lil Jon shoutout, the fact that Vampire Weekend, already with a reputation for overbearing bookishness, wrote a song ostensibly about grammar. But “Oxford Comma” is compositionally brilliant; clocking in at 3:15, it’s a microcosm of momentum-building, beginning with a slow thudding beat before, in short order, ramping to its double-chorus finale, resplendent and victorious without ever being angry or loud or fast. Montessori, finishing school, whatever it took: “Oxford Comma” is well-mannered punk rock. –Andrew Gaerig\n\nListen: Vampire Weekend: “Oxford Comma”\n\n190.\n\nPanjabi MC: “Mundian to Bach Ké (Beware of the Boys)” [ft. Jay-Z] (2003)\n\nBhangra never blew up in the U.S. the way dancehall or reggaeton did, but its one shot says something about the ridiculous zone Jay-Z was in for the decade’s first few years. Before Jay got ahold of it, “Mundian to Bach Ké” was a geography-crushing global smash. Jay might not have understood a word of the original, but he heard a dope beat (that “Knight Rider” theme was always meant to destroy dancefloors) and an opportunity to flex regal. And Jay just tore this thing apart, protesting the Iraq war before it was cool and calling himself the black Brad Pitt, taking one of ya chicks straight from under ya armpit– which is always cool. Some days, globalization feels like a good thing. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: Panjabi MC: “Mundian to Bach Ké (Beware of the Boys)” [ft. Jay-Z]\n\n189.\n\nThe Tough Alliance: “Silly Crimes” (2006)\n\nAmong indie dudes, “pure pop” used to mean “1960s-style pop.” Jangling guitars were a must– nothing too spicy, please. Well, the King of Pop is dead. Was that what he sounded like? How about the sound of global pop culture circa 2009? From heartfelt (OK, gloriously flawed) singing to running a collector’s-mentality record label, the Tough Alliance are way more indie than they’d probably like to admit. But they’ve seldom sounded more purely pop than on “Silly Crimes”, the flagship track from their maiden EP as label owners. Bass-heavy dance beats, sweetly yearning hooks, neon synths, utopian strings, and tropical sound effects– it’s New Waves, not “new wave.” And as frivolous delinquency goes, it’s pretty near a perfect crime. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: The Tough Alliance: “Silly Crimes”\n\n188.\n\nJens Lekman: “Black Cab” (2005)\n\nOh, you’re so self-conscious, Jens. With a “There She Goes” bounce in his step, Lekman wittily wallows in the guilt of ruining someone else’s good time. Now, all he wants to do is get home and sleep in his own bed, but the poor guy’s missed the last train. So he straps on a harpsichord borrowed from the Left Banke and some violins and casts his lot with the disreputable drivers of the black cabs, singing, “They might be psycho killers but tonight I really don’t care.” If Lekman’s bad nights out beget songs like this, I hope he never improves his social aptitude –Joe Tangari\n\nListen: Jens Lekman: “Black Cab”\n\n187.\n\nBooka Shade: “Mandarine Girl” (2005)\n\nIn 2005, dancefloors were awash in the anthems of what would briefly be known as “electro-house”– big, bold things with a beefed-up midrange as colorful and lovingly sculpted as the neon trim of an import tuner. Booka Shade claimed two of them, the Ibiza favorite “Body Language” and the more driving “Mandarine Girl”. Flush with rubbery riffs and sparkling counterpoints, the latter is essentially trance with swing, its syncopated refrain cycling upwards as fat, tubular synthesizers puff like smokestacks. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen: Booka Shade: “Mandarine Girl”\n\n186.\n\nFugazi: “Cashout” (2001)\n\nGentrification and real estate greed were not necessarily hot topics for rock bands to tackle in early 2001, but then Fugazi always have stayed ahead of the curve. Years prior to the final build-up and burst of the housing bubble, Ian MacKaye and company used “Cashout” to forcefully question the motives of real estate developers and the local governments who cater to them. In the process MacKaye delivers one of his most nuanced vocal performances, while the rest of the group matches his every lithe stride with characteristic economy of movement and an innate sense for genuine community action. –Matthew Murphy\n\nListen: Fugazi: “Cashout”\n\n185.\n\nDead Prez: “Hip-Hop” (2000)\n\nIn 2000, Dead Prez were the rare NYC group who recognized Southern rap’s subwoofer-heavy ascension as an opportunity, not a threat. The gargling-demon bassline on “Hip-Hop” kicked as hard as anything Mannie Fresh made that summer. And MCs M1 and Stic.Man used its buzzing urgency as a jumping-off point, slamming through righteous, fiery self-policing sermonism so woolly and ferocious that their preaching didn’t resonate as preaching. When Stic.Man pledged to run up on them crackers in they City Hall, you believed him. But at the end, when they broke away from all the fury to chant about how dope they were, you believed that, too. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: Dead Prez: “Hip-Hop”\n\n184.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age: “No One Knows” (2002)\n\nThis powerful slab of punch-drunk boogie rock stands as the most visible piece of QOTSA’s legacy, and not just because it topped the Modern Rock charts. A lot of its indelibility comes from the rhythmic swagger that arose from the combination of Josh Homme’s loping guitar riff, Nick Oliveri’s charging oompah-bass, and frequent ringer Dave Grohl’s memorably tourniquet-tight performance behind the kit. But there’s a sour, mournfully anxious mood under all that force, and the song stands as a bitter counterpoint to the manic pharmaceutical inventory of their previous single, “Feel Good Hit of the Summer”: “We get these pills to swallow/ How they stick in your throat”. –Nate Patrin\n\nListen: Queens of the Stone Age: “No One Knows”\n\n183.\n\nBeyoncé: “Irreplaceable” (2006)\n\nSeriously: What kind of numbskull would cheat on Beyoncé? She’s crazy, she’s ringing alarms, and– most important– she’s Beyoncé, almighty one-stop entertainer beamed down from Planet Perfection. But “Irreplaceable” is all about the revelation that there’s some unscripted emotion underneath all those hypnotic sequins. She puts on a good front: “You must not know ’bout me, I could have another you in a minute,” she sings, hand on hip. But the cracked delivery of “another you” gives her away– she sounds vulnerable, crushed, human. By the end of the song, the “another you”s are more strident as she turns back into the high-heeled superhero with invisible pores and quite-visible hips. But even when she loses, she wins. –Ryan Dombal\n\nListen: Beyoncé: “Irreplaceable”\n\n182.\n\nYo La Tengo: “Our Way to Fall” (2000)\n\nThe English language suggests “falling in love” and “being in love” are two totally separate states. Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley have been falling in love with each other long enough to know better. The wisdom of shared experience informs this song’s still-fluttery reminiscences on new romance, presented with the refined brushstrokes and humble restraint of indie rock Zen masters. It’s the little things you remember: what music you heard, gestures you noticed, what she was wearing around her neck and the day it fell to pieces behind the dresser. And it’s the little things Yo La Tengo get right with “Our Way to Fall”, an intimate anytime wedding march as post-Talk Talk tone poem. I remember the way it sounded walking down the aisle. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Yo La Tengo: “Our Way to Fall”\n\n181.\n\nMorrissey: “The First of the Gang to Die” (2004)\n\nMorrissey’s doomed romantic persona is the perfect vehicle for this update of American gangster mythology, which moves the action from the fedoras, Tommy guns, and speakeasies of 1930s Chicago and New York to the modern mean streets of L.A. His snuffed gangster, Hector, is no angel– he steals “from the rich and the poor and the not very rich and the very poor,” and steals our hearts as well. Morrissey’s grand musical backdrop and emotional distance allow him to croon his way to Hector’s complex inner nobility, and the result is a sensitive anthem for a tough, tough guy. –Joe Tangari\n\nListen: Morrissey: “The First of the Gang to Die”\n\n180.\n\nGwen Stefani: “Hollaback Girl” (2004)\n\n“Hollaback Girl” proved divisive with critics, with this publication decrying it as second-rate Queen, but this list’s voters evidently have latched on to Gwen’s feminine sport anthem. Stefani actually wrote “Hollaback Girl” with producer Pharrell Williams in reaction to a derogatory statement made by Courtney Love labeling Stefani a cheerleader. From the outset, it’s pretty obvious that Stefani is a cheerleader, and a damn good one. The cut’s Spartan beat proved wildly successful in the club, with Stefani’s invocations leading legions of ladies (and dudes) in an empowering urban shout-along. –Mike Orme\n\nListen: Gwen Stefani: “Hollaback Girl”\n\n179.\n\nBon Iver: “Skinny Love” (2007)\n\nPeople make too much of the cabin thing. Yes, Justin Vernon got his heart broken, hightailed it to the woods, donned some flannel, and emerged with some truly lovely music; it’s a story roughly as romantic as the records he makes. What makes “Skinny Love” so resonant isn’t just the wounded quality in Vernon’s unadorned voice or the easily identifiable chill carried by the track’s slight echo; it’s the fact that we can all imagine holing up while wounded and attempting to make something beautiful while making some sense of it. The only difference is, this guy actually did it. –Paul Thompson\n\nListen: Bon Iver: “Skinny Love”\n\n178.\n\nAir: “Cherry Blossom Girl” (2003)\n\nA successful marriage of the alien and the sensual is a tricky thing to pull off (check the Svedka she-bot for an example of how this can go horribly, horribly awry), but Air nailed it with this assemblage of FutureSex LoveSounds for the retro-futurist set. The lyrics may be all innocent infatuation, but the music tells a very different story. It’s hard to say which is more seductive: those gentle organic strums, the sci-fi synths, the Kenny G shit, or the way sensuous sounds past and present all come together in glorious communion here. File this one under “pomo-erotic”. –Matthew Solarski\n\nListen: Air: “Cherry Blossom Girl”\n\n177.\n\nEminem: “The Real Slim Shady” (2000)\n\nAs a self-styled controversy-courting public enemy number one, Eminem knew people would be listening closely when he dropped his second album The Marshall Mathers LP. Needless to say, “The Real Slim Shady”, its pop-culture-puncturing first single, went out of its way to chum the waters, and did so with such malicious glee that its instantly dated time-capsule lyrics hardly matter. “May I have your attention please?” asks Eminem politely at the song’s start, but he needn’t have bothered. He knows he’s got it long before he even hits that undeniably anthemic chorus. –Joshua Klein\n\nListen: Eminem: “The Real Slim Shady”\n\n176.\n\nXiu Xiu: “I Luv the Valley OH!” (2004)\n\nA good Xiu Xiu song is like someone vividly describing his pain. A great Xiu Xiu song is like someone actually hurting himself, right in front of you. This isn’t their most violent effort, but it’s their most scouring; a place where mortar-round drums pound down on rolling bass and chiming guitars, unsubtly conveying the painful insight that some dreams have to be razed, not realized. But the killshot is Jamie Stewart’s plugged-in vocal performance. Couched in his family mythology, it’s both pining and excoriating, his fatal cries pluming out like red mist. It sounds wrenched from a deeper place than even Stewart often goes. –Brian Howe\n\nListen: Xiu Xiu: “I Luv the Valley OH!”\n\n175.\n\nUsher: “Yeah” [ft. Lil Jon and Ludacris] (2003)\n\nIt’s hard to remember a time when a combination of Southern crunk’s trunk-rattling grit with sleek modern R&B would be considered groundbreaking. But so it was when Usher unveiled “Yeah” in early 2004. “Yeah” was the dirtiest-sounding thing Usher had done to date, but the real draw was Lil Jon’s ferocious-but-slippery production, featuring that crazy keyboard vamp that still sounds thrilling today. It also contains fantastic moments of unintentional hilarity, with lyrics dovetailing with Dave Chappelle’s loving TV mimicry of Lil Jon and the best guest-spot mispronunciation (Ludacris’ “Ursher”) since cats were calling Kanye “Cain” on his own records. –Joe Colly\n\nListen: Usher: “Yeah” [ft. Lil Jon and Ludacris]\n\n174.\n\nLos Campesinos!: “You! Me! Dancing!” (2007)\n\nA huge part of Los Campesinos!’ charm lies in their comfort with–and embrace of– being a bunch of nerds. And what’s more nerdy than not being able to dance? How about a song celebrating not being able to dance, but dancing anyway? “You! Me! Dancing!” explodes with the exuberance that comes from realizing that there’s no shame in being uncool, and no shame in doing uncool things like obsessing over long-lost indie heroes like Bis or throwing violin, glockenspiel, and girl-boy shouting over a tinny approximation of a classic rock riff. Fittingly, this track first drew attention via an uncool forum full of nerds: MySpace. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: Los Campesinos!: “You! Me! Dancing!”\n\n173.\n\nM.O.P.: “Ante Up” (2000)\n\nFact: Did you know that every time you play “Ante Up”, M.O.P.’s collaboration with LFO ceases to exist for exactly 4:09 seconds? It’s true; with every unhinged shout of “YAP THAT FOOL!” it becomes increasingly impossible that M.O.P.’s Billy Danze and Lil Fame ever worked with the “Chinese food makes me sick” dudes. It’s just that potent– the purest distillation of the sort of gun-blazing roughneck shit that M.O.P. have been slinging with wild-eyed, suicide-bomber conviction ever since 1993’s “How About Some Hardcore?” The Mash Out Posse do one thing, over and over again, and they do it incredibly well, and if there’s any confusion over what that thing is, then perhaps you are simply unclear on the meaning of either the words “mash” or “out,” or what they mean when put together. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen: M.O.P.: “Ante Up”\n\n172.\n\nShellac: “Prayer to God” (2000)\n\nIt’s not easy to find nuance in hate. Sounding like a country death ballad banged out by factory machinery, “Prayer to God” is a double-death wish with revealing specificity. The setup is simple enough: There are two people\n\nhere, and the narrator wants God to kill them. Over clamoring chords and the dead-air breaks in between, any other information comes slowly, and the same goes for the blustering climax and teeth-gritting tension from the lyrics’ repetition– all to be deflated by its grim punchline: the most disarming “amen” put to tape. –Jason Crock\n\nListen: Shellac: “Prayer to God”\n\n171.\n\nTalib Kweli: “Get By (Remix)” [ft. Mos Def, Jay Z, Kanye West, and Busta Rhymes] (2003)\n\nBefore he claimed he’d rhyme like Talib Kweli if lyrics sold, Jay-Z appeared on a remix of Talib’s hit single and did just that in a way that made his desperate struggles sound suave. Before his outsized lyrical personality was as famous as his production chops, Kanye West augmented his masterful Nina Simone-derived piano-hook beat with his first truly great turn on the mic. Before both of their verses, Mos Def opened with what’d be his most impassioned performance for years to come. Before the stirring gospel coda, Busta tore shit up. And before I forget: Kweli’s the beating heart at the center of a legendary posse cut. –Nate Patrin\n\nListen: Talib Kweli: “Get By (Remix)” [ft. Mos Def, Jay Z, Kanye West, and Busta Rhymes]\n\n170.\n\nGuillemots: “Trains to Brazil” (2005)\n\nAll swing drums, horn crescendos, and vocal gallantry, “Trains to Brazil” was the Guillemots’ first single and the most stirring encapsulation of the unabashed romanticism of their Through the Cliffs EP and debut full-length, Through the Windowpane. Singer Fyfe Dangerfield turns his eye toward the seemingly intractable conflicts of society: the title refers to Jean Charles de Menezes, who was killed after he was mistaken for a suicide bomber in the aftermath of the London train bombings. But being the obvious idealist that he is, Fyfe concludes, with a largely jazz-trained backing band playing ADD R&B behind him, that we’re all lucky to be alive. –Mike Orme\n\nListen: Guillemots: “Trains to Brazil”\n\n169.\n\nLudacris: “Southern Hospitality” (2000)\n\nThe early Ludacris singles remain the best because they had one quality much of his later music lacks: subtlety. There’s a stark menace to “Southern Hospitality” that makes his punchlines land harder because he’s not overwhelming the music by selling every line as a stand-up’s money shot. An early example of the already miserly Neptunes at their most restrained, the whistling synths are about the only thing coloring the clonk-and-clap drum pattern; it’s stand-out minimalism perfect for a performance with more honest, laconic menace than the rapper would later allow himself. Plus it brought a hip-hop catchphrase to Middle America on the back of something other than a shitty dance-craze record, no mean feat. –Jess Harvell\n\nListen: Ludacris: “Southern Hospitality”\n\n168.\n\nOf Montreal: “The Past Is a Grotesque Animal” (2007)\n\nAfter establishing his mission in the very first line of Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?– “We just want to emote ’til we’re dead”– Kevin Barnes tries his damndest to fulfill it on the record’s 12-minute centerpiece. And for Of Montreal, the past almost seemed like a set-up to blindside listeners with this song. For a band that built its following on “Sesame Street” psychedelia that sounded like eating a box of acid-laced crayons, “Grotesque Animal” is a jarring detour, a prowling, evil drone-rant that eschews Barnes’ usual sugar-high hooks for a diary-reading travelogue of love gained and lost, culminating, inevitably, in screaming sheets of Casio catharsis. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: Of Montreal: “The Past Is a Grotesque Animal”\n\n167.\n\nLiars: “The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack” (2006)\n\nThe Hollywood ending of Liars’ most essential album, “The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack” climbs from Drum’s Not Dead’s summit of rhythm, tension, and dissonance into a valley of easy harmonies splayed over chiming guitars. This woozy love song takes its time finding contentment, too, with a beat that sits still and vocals that promise to stretch on forever. In its own angular, art-rock way, “The Other Side” presaged the slow-song, group-vocals that bands like Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear turned into tour buses. –Grayson Currin\n\nListen: Liars: “The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack”\n\n166.\n\nGui Boratto: “Beautiful Life” (2007)\n\nBrazil’s not particularly known for its techno, but then Gui Boratto isn’t your average techno producer. Armed with a background in radio jingles and engineering credits for the likes of Garth Brooks and Des’ree, Boratto dropped in Chromophobia one of 2007’s most intricately mapped techno expeditions. Most of the record consisted of haunting, wordless sequencer games, but it’s “Beautiful Life”, an eight-minute slab of lo-fi vocal trance-pop, that many listeners remember. Sleepy vocals recorded by Luciana Villanova, who also happens to be married to Boratto, top out the New Order tribute without diminishing the impact of Gui’s techno swath. –Mike Orme\n\nListen: Gui Boratto: “Beautiful Life”\n\n165.\n\nJimmy Eat World: “The Middle” (2001)\n\n“Don’t write yourself off yet.” In the world of rock’n’roll, that’s about as good as advice gets. But “it’s only in your head you feel left out, or looked down on,” on the other hand, is a total lie. They really are looking down on you, and they’d rather you not come along at all. But you can’t let the enormity of that hit you when you’re 16 (the hardest age) and in the middle of it. So it’s a good kind of lie, the kind that helps you when you need it most, and J.E.W.’s affirmation, then, is offered as a sort of public service to a nation of insecure teenagers. And if your band delivers that message of hope with the kind of power-pop chorus hook that gives the best couple of Weezer songs a run for their money, you’ve accomplished something. –Mark Richardson\n\nListen: Jimmy Eat World: “The Middle”\n\n164.\n\nBroadcast: “Come on Let’s Go” (2000)\n\nCompared to the heady, slippery stuff Broadcast has created since The Noise Made By People, the lava-lamped bubble-chair groove of “Come On Let’s Go” sounds downright decadent and facile. But if this alluring combination of spy-flavored radiophonics and Trish Keenan’s velvet-honey coo is easy, then I don’t want to know from difficult. –David Raposa\n\nListen: Broadcast: “Come on Let’s Go”\n\n163.\n\nGirl Talk: “Smash Your Head” (2006)\n\nThe first half of “Smash Your Head” is just a well-executed mash-up, blending Clipse with Fall Out Boy and Nirvana with Young Jeezy and making them sound like they could all have some fun together. But then comes Elton John’s sped-up “Tiny Dancer” piano, and right behind it, Biggie. The collision opens up a new world for each song, making Elton’s piano trills sound like the perfect backing to any story told with heart, and the words that much more poignant. And as Biggie talks above all about a love of music, what that can mean to a kid, and shows how that can be carried into adulthood, he unwittingly sums up Girl Talk’s entire M.O. –Mark Richardson\n\nListen: Girl Talk: “Smash Your Head”\n\n162.\n\nGrizzly Bear: “Two Weeks” (2009)\n\nSunny and psychedelic, sure, but far from trapped in its own 1960s echo chamber, Grizzly Bear’s sweet “Two Weeks” is as welcomingly open as it is sneakily weird. While the band’s celestial “oohs” and “ahhs” soar, the song itself is driven and underpinned by soft piano plinking, shimmering but subtle sonic accoutrements, and a booming beat that’s more song-of-the-summer than inward indie. The track could probably go on forever but instead ends abruptly, which is perhaps the only way it really could end: flying so high above it all, there’s simply nowhere left for it to go. –Joshua Klein\n\nListen: Grizzly Bear: “Two Weeks”\n\n161.\n\nChristian Falk: “Dream On” [ft. Robyn and Ola Salo] (2006)\n\nDance music– and the act of dancing itself– has long been as much about creating safe havens for outsiders as about crafting moveable beats. Swedish DJ Christian Falk’s “Dream On” plays up that warm inclusiveness: Robyn and the Ark’s Ola Salo check IDs and stamp hands outside the a club tailormade for outsiders, offering sanctuary to pigs, snitches, thugs, lifers, freaks, junkies, and outcasts of all stripes. These may be the very same people many dancers want to get away from, but on this bubbly bit of triumphalism, Falk knows the promises of dance music are nil unless extended to every loser and locked-up intern. –Stephen M. Deusner\n\nListen: Christian Falk: “Dream On” [ft. Robyn and Ola Salo]\n\n160.\n\n50 Cent: “In Da Club” (2002)\n\nSorry to get all meta re: this list for a second, but this result is surely more a reflection of how absurdly hard 50’s star has crashed over the past five years than any real comment on the song’s quality, right? Because seriously: There are probably only a handful of grooves in recent hip-hop as remotely as instantaneous or as happy-making as these chugging chords, and I feel like in 2003, we all understood this a bit better. What else to say– the lyrics are standard-issue party jam bulletproof braggadocio that squarely lay out the terms: 50 doesn’t make love but he still wants to be loved. Other questions: Was this awesome because 50 doesn’t sing in the chorus? Do you think he’s still happy to sell like Eminem? –Mark Pytlik\n\nListen: 50 Cent: “In Da Club”\n\n159.\n\nCat Power: “I Don’t Blame You” (2003)\n\nIn retrospect, it can be easy to view Cat Power’s 2003 album You Are Free as a transitional work, one that marks the closing of a musical chapter for Chan Marshall. On the album opening “I Don’t Blame You”, this desire for artistic liberation is at once literal in Marshall’s lyrics and palpable in her performance. Backed only by a solo piano, Marshall’s voice brims with sympathy as she witnesses a musician tormented by audience expectation, a portrait that bears close resemblance to her earlier onstage self. Yet the song is also tempered by a certain measured distance, a sense of quiet acceptance that mirrors Cat Power’s eventual musical evolution away from such harrowing, introspective bloodletting. –Matthew Murphy\n\nListen: Cat Power: “I Don’t Blame You”\n\n158.\n\nArt Brut: “Formed a Band” (2004)\n\nI’m sure I wasn’t the only disappointed one in the room when, one night earlier this summer, Art Brut left “Formed a Band” off their setlist. But I get it, I do. An origin story this powerful can eclipse a band’s subsequent work– even a band of such overwhelming personality and aggressive rock’n’roll theater. Along with sharp-sticked campaigns to call bullshit on the industry and their peers, Art Brut have committed their career to unpacking “Formed” and selling the joys of forming your own (even if, like Eddie Argos, your singing voice is more drunken harangue than golden croon). So maybe we don’t need the three-minute digest version of their career at every show. Actually, maybe we still do. –Amy Granzin\n\nListen: Art Brut: “Formed a Band”\n\n157.\n\nKanye West: “Touch the Sky” [ft. Lupe Fiasco] (2005)\n\nIn maybe his last public act before dying, Evel Knievel sued Kanye for jacking his style in the “Touch the Sky” video. He should’ve thanked Kanye for celebrating his goofy-ass legacy. If Knievel didn’t want to see pop’s most dizzily egocentric figure trying on his star-spangled jumpsuit, he should’ve listened a little closer. In some ways, “Touch the Sky” is Kanye at his humblest: Detailing his struggles and failures before exploding into that glorious chorus, outsourcing the beat to fellow Roc-A-Fella house producer Just Blaze because nobody could’ve flipped that Curtis Mayfield sample harder. And when a then-unknown Lupe slickly ducked and weaved through that guest verse, another star was born. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: Kanye West: “Touch the Sky” [ft. Lupe Fiasco]\n\n156.\n\nThe Pipettes: “Pull Shapes” (2006)\n\nNo offense to the lovely brassy ladies of the Pipettes and the shapes they themselves pull with aplomb, but they’re just the cherry on top of this symphonic sundae. Those gorgeous soaring strings, with center stage all to themselves for the track’s first 30 seconds, are the song’s turbo-charged engine. It’s all listeners, and even the Pipettes, can do to hold on and enjoy the ride. –David Raposa\n\nListen: The Pipettes: “Pull Shapes”\n\n155.\n\nColdplay: “Clocks” (2002)\n\nAre they a part of the cure or a part of the disease? Well, Coldplay spent the decade securing next-U2 status by swiping Radiohead’s falsettoed grandiosity and stripping it down to a deliriously unthreatening rise-and-swoop formula. So check on in the “disease” column, I guess. But Chris Martin is the rare singer who can write lyrics that mean nothing and sell them like they mean everything, pushing his angelic wail over the glorious tumbling pianos and locked-in cymbal crashes of “Clocks” like Icarus trying to see how far he could push this whole flying thing. “Clocks” is MOR arena-pop done as well as MOR arena-pop can possibly be done. And nothing else compares. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: Coldplay: “Clocks”\n\n154.\n\nSufjan Stevens: “Casimir Pulaski Day” (2005)\n\nSomewhere between his five-volume Christmas album (surprisingly pretty, by the way) and his conceptual work about the BQE Expressway at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (hula hoops, angel wings, and enormous projections of blow-up gorillas played key roles) it started becoming a little more difficult to recall the simple pleasures of Sufjan’s keenly observed folk-pop. Now that his swelling string sections are permanent parts of the indie DNA it’s hard to remember just how fresh-sounding it all was, and how inviting his loose, communal approach to music-making felt, especially when contrasted with his grandiose, 50-ALBUMS-FOR-50-STATES! ambitions. But “Casimir Pulaski Day”, the modest follow-up to “Chicago”, still retains its campfire glow: a softly plonking banjo and guitar, some muted horns, and Sufjan’s gimlet storyteller’s eye. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen: Sufjan Stevens: “Casimir Pulaski Day”\n\n153.\n\nLuomo: “Tessio” (2000)\n\n“Microhouse,” or house under a microscope? Luomo’s early work honed in on house’s fleshy expanses to reveal a secret world of riotous molecular activity, strewn with dub echo and whispering clicks and snaps. “Tessio” is his most romantic epic, its hesitant build into a voluptuous house groove mirroring the journey of its enigmatic singers from uncertainty to sheltering comfort– “Baby, it’s okay,” they murmur finally, like these simple words could heal a thousand scars of past disappointments. The lingering resonance of “Tessio” as a house anthem full stop confirms that the biology of seduction is unleashed not in a laboratory, but on dancefloors every night. –Tim Finney\n\nListen: Luomo: “Tessio”\n\n152.\n\nLife Without Buildings: “The Leanover” (2000)\n\nIt’s beautiful for many reasons– Robert Johnston’s lyrical guitar work and Sue Tompkins’ genius-baby sing-speak embody pure delight. But mostly, it’s beautiful because it feels like the stuff of spontaneous inspiration, the splatter-paint syllables falling into unrepeatable patterns. Remarkably, this is an illusion, as the faithful version captured on Live at the Annandale Hotel attests. The dense wordplay and Rorschach-blot diction make the hundredth listen feel almost as fresh as the first (in 2009, for instance, opening line “If I lose you” sounds an awful lot like “Fallujah”). But the emotional baseline, bursting with love and quavering with doubt, remains satisfyingly constant –Brian Howe\n\nListen: Life Without Buildings: “The Leanover”\n\n151.\n\nSantigold: “L.E.S. Artistes” (2008)\n\nOn the face of things, Santi White (aka Santogold, now Santigold) would not seem like a person who lacks confidence. Yet there is an undercurrent of self-doubt that ripples through her 2008 breakout single “L.E.S. Artistes”, providing crucial emotional ballast to her buoyant and acerbic songcraft. Though the song takes aim at the poseurs she might see lurking around her Lower East Side neighborhood, lines like “What am I here for?” and “I hope it will be worth what I give up” reflect someone not afraid of turning the same critical eye towards herself, glancing back at avenues not taken while still maintaining her self-assured swagger. –Matthew Murphy\n\nListen: Santigold: “L.E.S. Artistes”\n\n150.\n\nJunior Senior: “Move Your Feet” (2002)\n\nThank you, internet! How else would we have found Junior Senior, a gay/straight Danish duo crafting dance parties from whatever genre ingredients were within arm’s reach. “Move Your Feet” caught the online jet stream, helped no doubt by its 8-bit evil squirrel and talking hot dog video (thanks again, internet!), but also through skilled deployment of roller-rink dance-hit staples: bad rapping, funk guitar, bells, humanism-through-dance. Its timing was exquisite, not just for distribution purposes, but for hitting American indie ears just as their dance music allergies were fading and meet-you-halfway disco-punk was leaving newly-founded indie dance parties unsatisfied. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: Junior Senior: “Move Your Feet”\n\n149.\n\nDan Deacon: “The Crystal Cat” (2007)\n\nWhat a lonely, lonely sound. Dan Deacon’s shows are about the high of communal experience– about surrendering your ego to a crush of overheated strangers. But his music is solitary. Cartoons and video games might make twentysomethings flush with nostalgia, but “The Crystal Cat” sounded more like Kraftwerk’s cold futures cast in pixels– a sound, above all, about distance rather than closeness. Yeah, you can twist to it. Yeah, it’s freaky and buzzing and loud. But when Deacon squeals through the hail of synthesizer noise and junked drum machines, he sounds like an astronaut sucked through the airlock– lost. –Mike Powell\n\nListen: Dan Deacon: “The Crystal Cat”\n\n148.\n\nAir France: “Collapsing at Your Doorstep” (2008)\n\nIt’s a travel-agency ad, not a pop song– an aural scrapbook by Scandinavian youths who’ve probably seen more of Barcelona through postcards than sunglasses. (We sure love music of distance, huh? Swedes dreaming of the beach; New Yorkers dreaming of the jungle; Timbaland dreaming, endlessly, of deep space.) The swishy, euro-pop pose always bugged me until I heard “Collapsing at Your Doorstep”. It’s music driven by longing, not owning. Music that sounds urbane, but like its makers are shut-ins and cinephiles. With Air France, it’s hard to tell what’s sampled and what’s live– in other words, which sun-soaked daydreams are actually theirs, and which we all somehow share. –Mike Powell\n\nListen: Air France: “Collapsing at Your Doorstep”\n\n147.\n\nWilco: “Poor Places” (2002)\n\n“A lot of times when you’re playing, if you don’t have any kind of sonic landscape behind you, everything kind of turns into a folk song,” explains Jay Bennett during the documentary I Am Trying to Break Your Heart as Wilco maps out “Poor Places”. Indeed, on paper, this tune comprises four chords, four verses, and a chorus; on record, though, it’s a Rube Goldberg contraption, with tiny parts lurking in the background only to spring the song into surprising directions. A coruscated drone becomes sedate pop becomes that folk number about which Bennett warned us becomes the most damaged minute in some dude’s iTunes library: No incarnation of Wilco has since outfitted Jeff Tweedy’s universal unease so boldly. –Grayson Currin\n\nListen: Wilco: “Poor Places”\n\n146.\n\nFennesz: “Caecilia” (2001)\n\nFennesz’s Endless Summer may have been complicated to make, but its effect is simple: sweet melodies poured into mesmerizing noise. “Caecilia” is the prettiest such concoction, burying lapping waves of digital grit under a languorous vibraphone hook. The pairing smoothes the former and toughens the latter until they fuse into a real song. How Fennesz fit all his blips and blurs into a song-mold remains a mystery– it sounds more like they’re organizing themselves, like a flock of birds flying in a V. Many imitators since have attempted that trick, but no other digital magicians keep their secrets hidden quite like Fennesz. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: Fennesz: “Caecilia”\n\n145.\n\nBroken Social Scene: “Cause = Time” (2003)\n\nBy the time “Cause = Time” appears eight songs into Broken Social Scene’s You Forgot It in People, the Toronto indie-rockestra had covered much stylistic turf– from noisy garage-rock to bossa nova to orchestral folk. But it was this peak mid-album track that both consolidated the album’s textural sprawl and confirmed Broken Social Scene’s own transformation from ambient hobby project to powerhouse rock band. With its cryptic references to menstruation, religion, and numerology, “Cause” isn’t about political activism any more than Sonic Youth’s “Teen Age Riot” was about tossing Molotov cocktails. But by updating classic, class-of-1988 indie rock anthemery with motorik post-rock rhythms, it served as the wake-up call for a new generation of daydream nationalists. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen: Broken Social Scene: “Cause = Time”\n\n144.\n\nJustice vs. Simian: “We Are Your Friends” (2003)\n\nOnly in Paris could something as seemingly uncool and ho-hum as a college radio remix contest birth a worldwide dancefloor sensation. Made using pretty rudimentary remixing tools, “We Are Your Friends” not only won Justice some contest prize, it established them as a force to be reckoned with. The prodigal duo almost completely gutted Simian’s “Never Be Alone” with the same audacity that would make their debut album such a monolith a few years later. However, despite the drastic re-imagining, Justice, always rockists at heart, preserved the original’s fist-pumping immediacy, a detail too many remixes neglect. –Adam Moerder\n\nListen: Justice vs. Simian: “We Are Your Friends”\n\n143.\n\nFeist: “1234” (2007)\n\nIt’s the song that sold a whole bunch of iPods, and gave “Sesame Street” a chance to learn a new way to count. And it’s a tune that vaguely mirrors Feist’s own transformation from beloved Broken Social Scenester to ubiquitous adult-contemporary everywoman– it starts off modest and gentle atop some acoustic strumming (on guitar and banjo), and then gradually builds to an ebullient horn-filled crescendo, with Feist proving to be just as adept at belting as at murmuring, but never at the expense of the song. –David Raposa\n\nListen: Feist: “1234”\n\n142.\n\nThe Flaming Lips: “Do You Realize??” (2002)\n\nThe Flaming Lips nabbed critics with The Soft Bulletin and their carnivalesque live performances, but “Do You Realize??” secured their public spotlight for years to come. Their commercial profile is one of many strange twists and turns over their career, and “Do You Realize??” does more than just announce it: it challenged them to take the vulnerability and earnestness of The Soft Bulletin widescreen, and not fall headfirst into a bucket of sap. The lyrics walk that tightrope precariously, but it’s really only the Lips, after years of spiritual quests, spider bites, flaming cymbals, and constant self-exploration, who can earn them. –Jason Crock\n\nListen: The Flaming Lips: “Do You Realize??”\n\n141.\n\nBritney Spears: “Toxic” (2003)\n\nThe thing that made Britney’s mid-decade breakdown so distressing is that the lady actually had great pop instincts. It’s not like when Jessica Simpson lost her damn mind and we the listeners lost exactly nothing. Sure, Brit bounced back with Blackout, but for better or worse she was a warbling ghost in her producer’s gleaming machines. “Toxic” was the last great Britney single (so far), the last where it felt like a personality was inhabiting the tune. (Britney always had more individualist pep than her peers, important when you’re dealing with steamroller productions from the mind of Max Martin.) And as a bonus, the backing track remains deeply, enjoyably weird-but-catchy: a club-tempo stepping breakbeat colored by James Bond soundtrack outtakes. –Jess Harvell\n\nListen: Britney Spears: “Toxic”\n\n140.\n\nInterpol: “NYC” (2003)\n\nFrom “New York, New York”, Ryan Adams’ accidental anthem, to Cat Power’s Sinatra cover, to LCD Soundsystem’s waning-decade lament “I love you but you’re bringing me down,” 9/11’s musical legacy is a still-unresolved mess of bewildered public discourse and private grief. With its aqueous chords and Paul Banks’ quietly desperate, yet poker-faced pronouncements, nothing, perhaps, vents the city’s confusion and ambivalence as elegantly as “NYC”. Everyone always remembers “subway is a porno,” and forgets the chorus, “New York cares,” but this song isn’t just some hipster’s crack-of-dawn crawl home. It’s also an epiphany a lot of New Yorkers reached post-attack: Civic disengagement’s no longer an option. –Amy Granzin\n\nListen: Interpol: “NYC”\n\n139.\n\nDaft Punk: “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” (2001)\n\nDance songs with instructional chants for lyrics tend to have a short shelf life. So upon first hearing “Harder, Better, Faster Stronger” (and to a greater extent, “One More Time”), I wondered if the new decade had already stumbled upon its “Bodyrock” or “Rockafeller Skank’. But how has “Harder” stood the test of time when so much borderline-brainwashing big beat has turned into dated punchlines? Because even if Kanye made it really tough to find as much novelty in those vocals, there’s just so much else to be amazed at that transcends novelty: go ahead and press play again and try to remember which part is your favorite– the 10 seconds before the intro beat drops? That ridiculous breakdown after the vocals go all widdly-widdly like an electric guitar? There are 138 songs on this list that do a better job of improving your day immediately? In terms of both artists and listeners, this decade has in large part been defined by its pleasure-seekers, and no matter where they sought their thrills, it never seemed like we got too far removed from “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger”. –Ian Cohen\n\nListen: Daft Punk: “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger”\n\n138.\n\nD’Angelo: “Untitled (How Does It Feel?)” (2000)\n\nThis single became notorious for its sexually charged video, featuring a series of lingering shots of D’Angelo’s nude body that split the difference between mass voyeurism and personal intimacy. But the rapturous intensity in his lushly multi-tracked vocal performance still holds more weight than any pin-up shot could– swooping and diving, gliding smoothly over the sway of the beat only to punctuate it with a sharp hitch or an extension of his deceptively delicate falsetto into an intense wail. The musical backing only adds to that euphoria, with gospel-soul pianos direct from Aretha’s Muscle Shoals sessions intertwined with pre-Dirty Mind (but still dirty-minded) Prince guitars. –Nate Patrin\n\nListen: D’Angelo: “Untitled (How Does It Feel?)”\n\n137.\n\nLadytron: “Destroy Everything You Touch” (2005)\n\nThe average pop song is a short lesson in delayed gratification– a calibrated crawl from intro and pattern-stamping verse to the big chorus. “Destroy Everything You Touch” has no such self-control: just 16 seconds in, the scorched-earth banger explodes and then gleefully burns for more than four minutes on sarcasm and spite. In an evil-genius marriage of sound and image, the catwalk-perfect “Destroy” partly soundtracks the forthcoming film doc about Anna Wintour, Vogue chief and booster bar none of last-capitalist excess. Marx should be so persuasive. –Amy Granzin\n\nListen: Ladytron: “Destroy Everything You Touch”\n\n136.\n\nGhostface Killah: “Shakey Dog” (2006)\n\nWe enter Ghost’s stream-of-consciousness stick-up narrative with the action already in progress, and leave with a “to be continued.” Within this seemingly arbitrary framework, however, Ghost omits no detail: the lady with the shopping cart hiding a cocked shottie, the steak and onions cooking down the hall, the “Sanford and Son” theme. Amidst the soul-superhero horn charts and Ghost’s dizzying thick description, it’s that sustained, soulful vocal note present throughout that gives “Shakey” its bullet-time panopticon perspective, with no bit of minutiae too tiny to mention. Tony Montana reference notwithstanding, “Shakey” is part cinema vérité, part “CSI”. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: Ghostface Killah: “Shakey Dog”\n\n135.\n\nThe Strokes: “The Modern Age” [EP version] (2001)\n\nThough they were one of the most talked-about bands of the decade, the Strokes were never among the highest-selling. Maybe it had to do with the fact that their feverishly anticipated debut album, Is This It?, had the misfortunate of dropping just weeks after 9/11, rendering their carefree garage-rock jangle– of which this debut single still stands as the purest distillation– almost instantly out of time and place. But even if the Strokes’ “Modern Age” sounded a lot like Lou Reed’s golden one, the song belongs to that rarefied class of singles that (like “Please Please Me” and “God Save the Queen” before it) divides history between the before and the after– specifically, a modern age defined by a ceaseless parade of definitely-articled, skinny-jeaned, pretty-boy rock bands, and an increasingly accelerated mode of blog-about/spit-’em-out musical consumption. However, divorced from the hyperbole that greeted its release, “The Modern Age” now just sounds like a sweet, innocent ode to fun in the sun– and a poignant time capsule of a world where it’s still Sept. 10, all the time. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen: The Strokes: “The Modern Age” [EP version]\n\n134.\n\nClipse: “Trill” (2006)\n\nClipse’s Hell Hath No Fury is too thick with highlights to truly contain a centerpiece, but there is something about the dark, streamlined “Trill” that beats very close to the album’s steely heart. For the album the Clipse brothers requested only the Neptunes craziest productions, and here Pharell Williams and Chad Hugo dutifully respond by packing “Trill” tight with bass, jittery beats, and motion-sick keyboards. The track’s ultimate brilliance depends entirely upon the way Malice and Pusha T are able to faultlessly balance their matter-of-fact braggadocio above the song’s shifting, precarious instrumental backdrop– as though savoring a brief moment before it all comes crashing down. –Matthew Murphy\n\nListen: Clipse: “Trill”\n\n133.\n\nBelle and Sebastian: “Your Cover’s Blown” (2004)\n\nTo parse NME’s cheeky comparison from 2004, there’s a bit of bohemian in “Your Cover’s Blown,” but not much rhapsody. “Cover” is more a slinky spy theme for breaking free from scenester security, and Stuart Murdoch plays the puppetmaster with puckish understatement. But this doesn’t mean that “Cover”– still the funkiest and longest song Belle & Sebastian have created– doesn’t create its own form of dramatic tension. The quickly alternating currents of chippy disco rhythms and Bolero-style guitar make Murdoch’s anxiously told tale of surreptitiously splitting the city for the sticks into a quietly garish operetta. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: Belle and Sebastian: “Your Cover’s Blown”\n\n132.\n\nPanda Bear: “Comfy in Nautica” (2005)\n\nNoah Lennox’s to-do list, summer 2005: Go to Coney Island. Clap more. Hear the beauty in thunderstorms. Watch the night skies for UFOs. Define “coolness” without being uncool or getting into one of those boring “what does ‘indie’ even mean anymore, brah?” dormroom bull sessions. Place off-kilter but emotionally packed melodies over repetitive loop collages, establishing a new instrumental paradigm for forward-looking rock and pop musicians. Render Animal Collective’s past yawpy unintelligibility newly intelligible; don’t lose sight of all that you can’t put into words. Capture the sound of the global village chanting. Be less afraid. “Try to remember always/ Just to have a good time.” Underline those last two words. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Panda Bear: “Comfy in Nautica”\n\n131.\n\nDestiny’s Child: “Say My Name” (2000)\n\nBeyoncé is a force now, but it would be almost impossible for her to ever again wield the kind of stranglehold over the world’s ears the way Destiny’s Child did at the turn of the millennium. At the time, they so thoroughly dominated the charts and airwaves, the hits just kept coming even when they ditched half the band. “Say My Name” is DC at their peak, riding a tidal wave of feisty righteousness to the ladies club anthem of 2000. The girls stop and start like ultrafine robots, sleekly maneuvering through producer Rodney Jerkins’ arsenal of space-age R&B effects. I could never figure out why the guy in the song even picked up the phone in the first place, though. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: Destiny’s Child: “Say My Name”\n\n130.\n\nSpoon: “The Underdog” (2007)\n\nIt’s only fitting that on a song called “The Underdog” Britt Daniel takes a well-deserved victory lap. For folks that remember Spoon’s failed dalliance with Elektra Records, this song’s call to “cut out the middleman” might sound like a long-awaited response to the two-song Saddle Creek single Daniel once recorded in honor of the group’s less-than-honorable A&R rep. But that was a long, long time ago– if anything, “The Underdog” is just emblematic of Spoon’s unabashed embrace of the pop sophistication they’ve been honing throughout their Merge career, critics and naysayers be damned. When the tune’s handclaps give way to a boisterous horn section, it’s a middle finger to any and all doubters and purists, and it’s delivered with an infectious smile. –David Raposa\n\nListen: Spoon: “The Underdog”\n\n129.\n\nAndrew W.K.: “Party Hard” (2001)\n\nThere’s a place in music for subtlety, layered meaning, and nuance, but it’s somewhere way the fuck on the other side of town from this piston-pumping, steam-rolling, brick-wall-compressed-to-within-an-inch-of-its-life riff machine. Indeed, the first single from I Get Wet wins the decade’s truth in advertising award: It’s called “Party Hard”, it opens with the phrase “When it’s time to party, we party hard,” the verses are about partying (hard), and the chorus features shouts of “Party hard!” over and over. Before Red Bull and vodka became fashionable and sports drink companies made the decade all about the pursuit of eXtreme energy, the movement already had its anthem. –Mark Richardson\n\nListen: Andrew W.K.: “Party Hard”\n\n128.\n\nThe Mountain Goats: “No Children” (2003)\n\n“No Children” would be one of the most lacerating breakup songs of all time...if John Darnielle actually allowed his characters to break up. Instead, Darnielle’s frequently chronicled Alpha Couple are doomed to drown together, “hand in unlovable hand.” As the couple’s male half spews bilious hate-fuckery in the direction of his wife, sprightly piano props him up, symptomatic of the way Tallahassee pushed Darnielle’s previously stubborn lo-fi aesthetic towards studio sheen. Besides, if she’s gone, who would be left for our narrator to hate more than himself? At least they didn’t have any children, thank god. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: The Mountain Goats: “No Children”\n\n127.\n\nCiara: “Oh” [ft. Ludacris] (2005)\n\nLyrically, “Oh” could practically be a T.I. track, drunk on the little local-color details that rappers love so much. Musically, it’s not too far off either, Dre & Vidal’s organs copping that sunny “Rubber Band Man” melodicism. But Ciara’s gorgeous robo-sigh of a voice is something else entirely. She floats just above the beat, slowly and breathily pushing it back and forth. When Ludacris jumps on board for one for a typically masterful hyperspeed guest-verse (and good lord he was on a roll back then), he’s the antic, amped-up counterpoint to Ciara’s slow sensuality. Every city deserves a song like “Oh” in its honor; almost none get one. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: Ciara: “Oh” [ft. Ludacris]\n\n126.\n\nCalifone: “The Orchids” (2006)\n\nSometimes for better but oftentimes for worse, Califone have forsaken song for sound, reveling in the possibilities of the studio while obfuscating Tim Rutili’s fragmentary ditties. The same holds for British industrialists Psychic TV, who, after a ponderous instrumental introduction, led 1983’s Dreams Less Sweet with “The Orchids”. Lifted by pointillist keyboards and ascendant horns, it remains one of the band’s purest pop moments. Califone one-ups them on this cover: After a violin fanfare, the veterans saunter through what might be the most cohesive, communicative and contagious three minutes of their repertoire. In Rutili’s weary voice, the song’s resilient mantra– “In the morning after the night/ I fall in love with the light”– feels like a testimonial. –Grayson Currin\n\nListen: Califone: “The Orchids”\n\n125.\n\nThe Field: “Over the Ice” (2006)\n\nMinimalism tends to work in deep code, with referential gestures that cater to initiates on a very “head” level, but the Field imbues it with huge, rushing feeling: No arcane knowledge required. “Over the Ice” is your pulse, your stride, the blood squeaking in your ears. It’s also the voices in your head, chattering in a benevolent language, and your bright, ringing nerves. It eventually became a permanent part of me, that staccato “da, da-da, da-da, da-da da” still on silent repeat in my head. This might be a problem if it weren’t so salutary, organizing the chaos of ecstatic experience into endlessly hospitable courses. –Brian Howe\n\nListen: The Field: “Over the Ice”\n\n124.\n\nTed Leo and the Pharmacists: “Where Have All the Rude Boys Gone?” (2002)\n\nYeah, it’s about the Specials; the key line in Ted Leo’s fedora-tip and hit of liquid sunshine isn’t the second-wave ska roll call, but the one about dancing and being free. And the elements of “Rude Boys”– Leo’s ever-impassioned pleas, the rumbling rhythm section, that overjoyed guitar running up its center– sounds both like that freedom and will easily inspire that dancing. So the message to you, Rudy, isn’t really about bygone days, but about possibility of the future: of being young, of having a favorite sound, and, heck, maybe even of ending your punk song in a round. –Paul Thompson\n\nListen: Ted Leo and the Pharmacists: “Where Have All the Rude Boys Gone?”\n\n123.\n\nKanye West: “Jesus Walks” (2004)\n\nOh Kanye. On only his third single ever, he can’t help but congratulate himself inside the actual song for supposedly bringing the Lord back to hip-hop airwaves. But comparing his relationship with Christ to Kathie Lee and Regis isn’t exactly St. Augustine’s Confessions. Instead, “Jesus Walks” is a densely layered premonition of the producer/rapper’s ambitions, from a guy mostly known at the time for playing soul records at the wrong RPM. Militaristic drums, choral melisma, snake-charmer keyboards, and swatches of orchestration made “Jesus Walks” an odd thing to spill out car windows in Summer 2004, if more for the music than the message. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: Phoenix: “If I Ever Feel Better”\n\n119.\n\nT.I.: “Rubber Band Man” (2003)\n\nThe nine in his right and the 45 in his other hand got him in some trouble a few years later. But at the time, nobody minded that Tip was bragging on his arsenal while a mob of school-kids chanted deliriously joyous la-la-las underneath. That’s the thing about “Rubber Band Man”: Its forbidding snarls evaporate when confronted with David Banner’s ice-rink organ and candy-floss melody. Tip’s got a striver’s quiet confidence, reveling in his small triumphs: “But why the rubber band? It representin’ the struggle, man.” Ludacris later made fun of Tip for only being worth a piddling couple hundred grand, but that didn’t last long, either. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: T.I.: “Rubber Band Man”\n\n118.\n\nCamera Obscura: “Lloyd, I’m Ready to Be Heartbroken” (2006)\n\nLloyd Cole was a lyrical namedropper in his day, but it was the nameless, second-person address in “Are You Ready to be Heartbroken” that had the most lasting effect. Thankfully, one of those moved by it 22 years later was fellow Scot Tracyanne Campbell, who set about crafting that rarest type of response song. “Lloyd” packs the sort of built-up, bittersweet patience that comes from finally replying to an old letter pulled from the bottom of a dresser drawer, and is perfectly situated within Motown-derived pop-soul, giving that indelible refrain equal parts effervescent joy and lonesome resignation. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: Camera Obscura: “Lloyd, I’m Ready to Be Heartbroken”\n\n117.\n\nAnimal Collective: “Leaf House” (2004)\n\nIf Animal Collective have a pivot point, it’s here– when their arrangements became lean, spare, and syncopated; when they salvaged their vocals from the margins and evolved beyond the shout and moan; when South American and African music emerged as influences in their sound, not just sidebar bullet points about their record collections. After the humid Here Comes the Indian, I doubt even their most slavish fans expected music as lithe as “Leaf House”. I remember exactly where and when I first heard it– there’s probably still saliva in the carpet. –Mike Powell\n\nListen: Animal Collective: “Leaf House”\n\n116.\n\nThe White Stripes: “Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground” (2002)\n\nThat loud squeal that opens the first song on the White Stripes’ third album– for many listeners it was their debut– announced the duo’s arrival as neither garage-rock bandwagoneers nor showboating blues revivalists. “Dead Leaves” mapped out a primitive sound that came across as downright innovative in 2001, pairing Jack’s gargantuan guitar riff with Meg’s rudimentarily pounding to create a song that moved effortlessly between cracks of thunder and pockets of quiet. Instead of delivering another screed against women as evildoers (a common blues depiction), Jack sings the tenderest of love-song sentiments: Her every breath is a “tiny little gift,” and he sounds like the most mannish boy for acknowledging it. –Stephen M. Deusner\n\nListen: The White Stripes: “Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground”\n\n115.\n\nDirty Projectors: “Stillness Is the Move” (2009)\n\nImagine the bored, flat, tuneless tones of a thousand underwhelming indie vocalists drove a hipster to the demonstrative gymnastics of Mariah Carey or the playful entreaties of Rihanna. But imagine that listener still musically craved the left-turn dissonance and unpredictability of his favorite arty strivers. Now you understand part of the reason why so many indie acolytes eventually acknowledge the triumphalism of pop, and why “Stillness Is the Move” was such a godsend, pairing Angel Deradoorian and Amber Coffman’s soaring, heart-stopping testimonials with such satisfyingly squiggly guitars and creative melodic and harmonic shifts. –Joshua Love\n\nListen: Dirty Projectors: “Stillness Is the Move”\n\n114.\n\n!!!: “Me and Giuliani Down By the Schoolyard (A True Story)” (2003)\n\nThe lyrics were already outdated by the time they released this single in 2003 (young folks: Rudy Giuliani was once New York City’s law’n’order mayor, 1994-2001), and frankly Nic Offer isn’t much of a singer. But a) Who cares, and b) Who cares– neither were his models in the Clash, New Order, and Liquid Liquid. !!! advanced all of those bands’ tradition of integrating the urgent abrasion of underground rock into the time-obliterating throb of club music (hint: cowbell!!!). The most thrilling moments of the many packed into \"Giuliani\"’s nine minutes come when an electronic pulse emerges from a sour thicket of rock instruments, or when the machines do an echo-dub dive away from the mix and the human noise rises back to the surface. –Douglas Wolk\n\nListen: !!!: “Me and Giuliani Down By the Schoolyard (A True Story)”\n\n113.\n\nKelis: “Milkshake” (2003)\n\nWhen Kelis and the Neptunes first came together, they were relative unknowns with weirdbeat designs on the charts. Thus began the mutual rise that commenced with 1999’s twerky Kaleidoscope and peaked with “Milkshake”. With its atonal, disruptive clatter, it has the distinction of unofficially ushering in the brief era of the female meme-chasing single (see: “Hollaback Girl”, “My Humps”) while simultaneously being one of the last big-bottomed hits to flourish before being subsumed by the high-end-fixated sing-songy ringtone R&B that remains summer’s hottest look. Speaking of memes, “milkshake” did well in the noughties. But before Henry Plainview drank it, Kelis brought it. –Mark Pytlik\n\nListen: Kelis: “Milkshake”\n\n112.\n\nLindstrøm: “I Feel Space” (2005)\n\nHans-Peter Lindstrøm certainly wasn’t the first artist to re-imagine Giorgio Moroder and Donna Summer’s classic Italo-disco prototype “I Feel Love”, but he arguably did it best. Indeed, the Norwegian producer’s “I Feel Space” sounds not unlike Moroder launched into outer orbit, its arpeggiated synths and thumping bass so bouncy they could have been recorded in zero gravity. The high-water mark for what became known as space disco? Sure. But “I Feel Space” is an even simpler victory: The employment of traditional music-making expertise– check the sweeping chord changes and perfectly timed handclaps– in the creation of one flawless dance track. –Joe Colly\n\nListen: Lindstrøm: “I Feel Space”\n\n111.\n\nAaliyah: “We Need a Resolution” (2001)\n\nR&B has made a craft of apportioning guilt as much as declaring love, but “We Need a Resolution” despairs at ever separating the two. “You got issues, I got issues,” Aaliyah sighs, as always evocative rather than exhibitionist, “but I know I miss you…” The song’s series of questions (“Who should be hurt? Who should be blamed?”) could only have been asked by Aaliyah; any other singer would have given away the answers. Timbaland’s arrangement offers little guidance, its unsettling clarinet melody, chattering beat, and gamelan twinkles balancing on a knifepoint of uncertainty fully as much as Aaliyah’s delicate interrogation. –Tim Finney\n\nListen: Aaliyah: “We Need a Resolution”\n\n110.\n\nDizzee Rascal: “Fix Up Look Sharp” (2003)\n\nDizzee Rascal ends the 2000s as Britain’s biggest urban music star. “Fix Up Look Sharp” was his first record to suggest that might be a safe bet. He had more surprising songs and more challenging tracks but “Fix Up” had the muscle and hunger. That delirious signature yelp of cartoon contempt began here– “your head splits like ba-NARNAR” and the flow demonstrated that Dizzee could make the hugest hook his own. In truth “Fix Up” is as fiercely stark as any 00s production but you simply don’t notice that: Dizzee’s addictive, dominating talent turns it into thrillingly uncompromising pop. –Tom Ewing\n\nListen: Dizzee Rascal: “Fix Up Look Sharp”\n\n109.\n\nGrizzly Bear: “Knife” (2007)\n\nThere’s a palpable musk around “Knife”, as if it were buried for a long time and then exhumed in 2006. You might peg the date of interment in the 60s, when the Shangri-Las and George “Shadow” Morton were clotting simple yet twisted love songs with mossy production, making them sound all deathy and decayed. There are just a few words, inscribed in a lavish script on the harmonies; a handful of chords. But a whole host of sensations pour through them, and not just emotional ones: The guitars prickle and clutch; the refrains scale ear-popping altitudes. You can, it turns out, feel the knife. –Brian Howe\n\nListen: Grizzly Bear: “Knife”\n\n108.\n\nThe Hold Steady: “The Swish” (2004)\n\nThe Hold Steady came as a relief to squares who liked AC/DC’s riffs but got tired of searching for value in cock jokes on repeated listens. But they weren’t simple– their songs were long; their verses obsessively detailed; their codas jarring; their theater weird. Craig Finn didn’t need vocal melodies– he had one-liners. This is a guy messing with puns the year Funeral came out. He rants with such force that, with headphones on, you can feel spit showering your eardrums. Though they’re a band best experienced as a big picture, “The Swish” distills their appeal to an essence– a collage of 70s rock dressed in pop-culture trivia and half-remembered stories about drug dealers. A fan’s band from the first song. –Mike Powell\n\nListen: The Hold Steady: “The Swish”\n\n107.\n\nM83: “Don’t Save Us From the Flames” (2005)\n\nThe fantasy of dying in your lover’s arms amidst a fiery auto accident has been a pop staple from 1960s teen tragedy songs through the Smiths and beyond. With “Don’t Save Us From the Flames”, M83’s Anthony Gonzalez blows that tradition up into full-screen high definition, the track serving as a bridge between his more abstract earlier work and the explicit melodrama of 2008’s Saturdays = Youth. Here, the adrenaline spike of the car crash is replicated at the nexus of shoegaze bliss-out, ambient oblivion, and stadium rock release. Piledriving drums, headrush guitars, unearthly synths– not a bad way to go out, huh? –Amy Phillips\n\nListen: M83: “Don’t Save Us From the Flames”\n\n106.\n\nThe Mae Shi: “Run to Your Grave” (2008)\n\nWho would guess that this hyperactive, riff-happy six-piece could calm down enough to craft an all-together-now anthem? Or that it would be a moving ode to sprinting through life to the end? In the year-plus since its release, the super-sunny \"Run to Your Grave\" has become even bigger and brighter, inspiring a bro-fest video and countless live sing-alongs (the band has even been known to stretch it into passages of solo-guitar folk and freestyle rap). But the humble little LP version remains a powerful bit of pied-piper synth-pop, while still retaining the band’s Casio-freak edge. –Marc Masters\n\nListen: The Mae Shi: “Run to Your Grave”\n\n105.\n\nGrinderman: “No Pussy Blues” (2007)\n\nIn which Nick Cave proves there are few things funnier than a hyper-literate old man driven to sputtering frenzy by the erection he can’t relieve. It takes bravery to add a fresh twist to a 30-year-career with a song about being hard up, though it probably mitigates some of the sting when you’re mordantly self-aware, happily married, and take to black humor like the proverbial duck. It also helps when the backing track refuses any concessions to the encroaching gentility that seems to invariably come with age. And unlike most rock’n’roll songs about an inability to get your rocks off, you suspect the anti-adolescent “No Pussy Blues” will only become more hilariously apt as you grow older, whatever your gender. –Jess Harvell\n\nListen: Grinderman: “No Pussy Blues”\n\n104.\n\nEminem: “Lose Yourself” (2002)\n\nIf this list reflected the number of “no-one-watching, in-the-mirror, punch-the-air self-psyching”-moments a song produced and not the whims of a group of music critics, this song would be such a runaway number one Vegas would’ve stopped taking bets six months ago. It’ll be quicker, so let’s do it this way: raise your hand if you haven’t pumped yourself up for a workout, date, hockey game, or hipster-ogling with “Lose Yourself”? Yeah, pretty much the same number that predicted Em’s most lasting moment would be an almost too-serious soundtrack jig about the perils of a character named (presumably) after a John Updike protagonist. –Andrew Gaerig\n\nListen: Eminem: “Lose Yourself”\n\n103.\n\nFeist: “Mushaboom” (2003)\n\nJust do a cursory search for real estate in Mushaboom, Halifax. Look at the landscape shots. It’s all you really need to know. Feist had been kicking around in punk bands, touring with Peaches, and singing sweet, fucked-up songs with Broken Social Scene for a decade before “Mushaboom”. But then this simple song about simple life in the tiny Canadian town hit and your platonic indie pop ideal was born. Singing in a controlled lilt, Feist performs “Mushaboom” like a plaintive acoustic number that just might fit right in on the Singin’ in the Rain soundtrack. From Peaches to Debbie Reynolds: This is the versatility of a great artist. –Sean Fennessey\n\nListen: Feist: “Mushaboom”\n\n102.\n\nCut Copy: “Hearts on Fire” (2007)\n\nYou once could find Cut Copy’s debut Bright Like Neon Love in the dollar bin at San Francisco’s Amoeba Records. Think you’ll find it there now? Neon Love’s diffident and dreamy synth-pop relegated the band to the fringes of hardcore appreciators. In the interim, their makeover, partially tended to by DFA’s Tim Goldsworthy, morphed them into indie stars, fuelled first by the Hearts on Fire EP in 2007 and a kaleidoscopic game of Human League that casts shadows of Berlin period Bowie. The best part? At 30 seconds in, keyboard stabs and female vocals chime in, and the song evokes the Night at the Roxbury head-whipping of La Bouche or Haddaway. It takes stones to pull that off. –Mike Orme\n\nListen: Cut Copy: “Hearts on Fire”\n\n101.\n\nJürgen Paape: “So Weit Wie Noch Nie” (2002)\n\nThough the original version first appeared on Kompakt’s 2001 Total 3 compilation, many listeners first discovered Jürgen Paape’s luscious “So Weit Wie Noch Nie” when Erlend Øye used the song as the opener for his stellar 2004 DJ-Kicks mix. However you arrived at the track, its five-and-a-half minutes– a swaying, heady blend of weighty bass, spray-can hisses, and warm-blanket synths– remain some of the most thoroughly pleasurable techno of the decade. But what truly sets “So Weit Wie Noch Nie” apart is Paape’s masterful sampling of Israeli-born schlager singer Daliah Lavi’s wispy vocals, which elevates a gorgeous instrumental into something heavenly. –Joe Colly\n\nListen: Jürgen Paape: “So Weit Wie Noch Nie”\n\n100.\n\nJamie Lidell: “Multiply” (2005)\n\nFor a long time, Jamie Lidell was a voice in search of a vessel– a “walking talking question mark,” as he put it in another song, who poured himself into his samplers on stage, hoping to find the loop that would straighten him out again. And then with “Multiply”, the lead track off his debut album, he found his container in a Sam Cooke castoff. Just a hair from all-out plagiarizing the melody of “(Sittin’ on) the Dock of the Bay”, Lidell and his collaborator Mocky strung plucky electric guitar figures like so many clothespins along a loose, ropy drum line, with falsetto doo-wops billowing above. Lidell– multitracked, and singing sweetly of the schizo mindset– never sounded so whole. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen: Jamie Lidell: “Multiply”\n\n99.\n\nMGMT: “Time to Pretend” (2008)\n\nWhat makes “Time to Pretend” so universally liked (even by cranky indie rock purists) is its dazzling wire walk between smug, smartass irony and actual lust for the kind of fucked-up celebrity lifestyle that keeps Perez Hilton in bandwidth. MGMT’s perfect sound was an evolution. The duo’s earlier self-produced Casio-chintzy version of the song made no secret of then-college students Ben Goldwasser and Andrew Van Wyngarden’s dry disdain. But Dave Fridmann’s major-label-funded take two is something out of Hieronymus Bosch, a lush pleasure garden of melodies twining like naked limbs, guitars and drums distorted into dirty, Ecstatic grooves. It’s all a little unsettling– decadence always is. But MGMT pull “Pretend” off with the kind of conviction that standing on the precipice of stardom can give you. –Amy Granzin\n\nListen: MGMT: “Time to Pretend”\n\n98.\n\nBeirut: “Postcards From Italy” (2006)\n\nHow fitting is it that this one initially rose to prominence via a nascent blogosphere? The story of “Postcards” is also the story of this hyperactive age of information exchange and accrual. Sure Beirut’s Zach Condon had actually been to the Old Countries, but his appropriation of traditional Yiddish and French styles is still just that, and a tinge of desperation can be felt in this song’s attempt to detach from the very age that, paradoxically, makes it possible. It’s nostalgic, sure. But this wasn’t so much, to crib James Murphy, borrowed nostalgia for an unremembered era. This was a kind of *imagined *nostalgia, one that could be acquired through the sheer act of looking at old photos– or postcards– and a sentiment that could be convincingly and compellingly evoked by a 20-year-old kid dreaming away in his New Mexico bedroom. It may sound entirely out of time, but “Postcards” is a decidedly 21st century anthem. –Matthew Solarksi\n\nListen: Beirut: “Postcards From Italy”\n\n97.\n\nBelle and Sebastian: “I’m a Cuckoo (by the Avalanches)” (2004)\n\nBelle and Sebastian believe in traveling light. The Avalanches believe in traveling. On 2003’s Trevor Horn-produced Dear Catastrophe Waitress, “I’m a Cuckoo” was just one audaciously kooky, Thin Lizzy-owing AM pop thrill en route to the even greater lavishness of 2006’s The Life Pursuit. The Avalanches’ reimagining spirits Stuart Murdoch’s cheerfully heartbroken vocal (and not much else) to North Africa for hand-played percussion, wooden flute, and a Sudanese children’s choir. Not only does this version make “Cuckoo” finally sound as carefree as its melody, it also predicts indie pop’s late-2000s turn Africa-ward. (See especially the Tough Alliance and Air France remixes of former Concretes singer Victoria Bergsman’s Taken By Trees project.) So if Murdoch still would “rather be in Tokyo,” he has some traveling left to do. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Belle and Sebastian: “I’m a Cuckoo (by the Avalanches)”\n\n96.\n\nClinic: “Distortions” (2000)\n\nIt was hard to know what to make of Clinic when they debuted with a string of singles in the late 1990s. The only points of reference you could formulate to describe them were absurd and floral, like what if Radiohead and the Pixies were broadcasting garage-rock distress skronks from some lunar shore? But this enigmatic new-millennium band dropped its guard a little on the amorous-mixtape staple “Distortions”, which beat the Postal Service to the indie-electronic slow dance by several years. The funny thing is, it’s not really a romantic song. Ade Blackburn may love it when you blink your eyes, but he’s also picturing you dead and thinking about marrying your sister. Despite the devotional tone, you get the sneaky feeling that “free of distortions” is a euphemism for being left alone. –Brian Howe\n\nListen: Clinic: “Distortions”\n\n95.\n\nWolf Parade: “I’ll Believe in Anything” (2005)\n\nIt’ll always go down as a Spencer Krug song, but “I Believe in Anything” testifies to the power of teamwork. Don’t ask me how the blue collar Dan Boeckner ever gelled with an ADD Renaissance fair castaway like Krug, but this freak of a power ballad maximized the group’s disparate strengths. Bands with cobbled-together lineups like Wolf Parade’s too often fall short of the sum of their parts, usually because they don’t have the artistic genius (or compromising skills) to take, say, this wacky funhouse melody and hammer it on repeat until it becomes a Springsteen anthem. It also doesn’t hurt to have Wolf Parade’s heart-on-sleeve conviction. Krug promises to take you to a place where “nobody knows you” or “gives a damn either way”, and the funny thing is, I trust him– even if he does sound like a weirdo. –Adam Moerder\n\nListen: Wolf Parade: “I’ll Believe in Anything”\n\n94.\n\nThe Futureheads: “Hounds of Love” (2005)\n\nIn the decade of post-punk pastiche overload, too few bands focused on the pop-centric quirk on those classic John Peel radio shows. What made the Futureheads 21st-century p-punk exemplars was their commitment to twee-boy harmonies as dizzyingly overlapping hooks. And it’s the play of voices that made this Kate Bush cover more than a one-note joke.\n\n“Play” is right: few contemporary rock bands have sounded like they’re having as much fun as the Futureheads. They almost trip over themselves in transforming Bush’s paean to the slow surrender of control into a race to be the first one wrestled to the ground by love. In a decade when mainstream rock continued its ignoble slide into pure alpha-male-ism, it was beyond refreshing to see four boys embracing one of pop’s most theatrically feminine figures. –Jess Harvell\n\nListen: The Futureheads: “Hounds of Love”\n\n93.\n\nThe Game: “Hate It or Love It” [ft. 50 Cent] (2005)\n\nThe notion that 50 Cent was ever involved in a song this, well, appealing feels pretty remote in 2009. He’s deep into his late-period-Tyson decline now, the stage in which you brag about hanging out with Bette Midler on your mixtapes, narrate porn films, and (possibly) make an appearance on Foxy Boxing. But man, the Curtis of “Hate It or Love It”– this guy seemed like he might be a star forever. The nimble rhythm of the chant “hate it or love, the underdog’s on top” bobs and weaves around the syncopated bass line, and his evocative opening verse– his last great one– seems to summon Cool and Dre’s summer-soul track into existence: sheepskin coats and gold ropes, Rakim’s “My Melody”, bikes getting stolen, mommy kissing a girl. By the time Game comes huffing onto the track, it’s already all over, which is probably one of the reasons Game refuses to perform this song. He knows who it belongs to, and it still burns him up. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen: The Game: “Hate It or Love It” [ft. 50 Cent]\n\n92.\n\nModest Mouse: “3rd Planet” (2000)\n\nThe world begins and ends in “3rd Planet”, which is kind of a lot to tackle in a rock song. Birth, death, depression, possibly stoned revelations about the shape of the universe itself, all prove conversation fodder on this, the leadoff track to The Moon & Antarctica, one of the decade’s most expansive albums. Rattled by the loss of a child, Brock– one eye on his navel and the other fixed skyward– navigates the cosmic chaos as the band crafts a sound to match the scope of his gaze. Brock’s disarmingly direct lyrics still manage to hint at a well of hurt and self-reflection a few minutes couldn’t possibly hope to resolve– he dares to ask personal questions of the universe, and “3rd Planet” finds him posing some of the toughest ones yet. –Paul Thompson\n\nListen: Modest Mouse: “3rd Planet”\n\n91.\n\nJustice: “D.A.N.C.E.” (2007)\n\nMaybe it’s just the “P.Y.T.” reference, but it’s kinda hard to write about “D.A.N.C.E.” at this point without the mind eventually turning to Michael Jackson. Even forgetting the letter-by-letter MJ breadcrumb trail in the lyrics (“P.Y.T.”, “B.E.A.T.”, “A.B.C”), it always felt like this was Justice’s best attempt to soften their pulverizing brand of French touch by locating it in a sweeter time, i.e., somewhere between the Jackson 5 and Off the Wall. Hell, considering the syrupy disco strings, emphatic childlike joy, overstuffed melodies, and unrelenting technical efficiency at the heart of it, you could even build a case for this being a sort of loving metaphor for MJ pre-Thriller. In the world outside of half-baked critical theory, “D.A.N.C.E.” suffered from more practical bugaboos in the form of flagrant and unrelenting overexposure. Swear to God there was a brief period in 2007 where it was government-mandated to appear in 40% of the world’s advertisements and television musical montage moments. Are we ready to hear it again? Probably not quite yet. Good tune, though. –Mark Pytlik\n\nListen: Justice: “D.A.N.C.E.”\n\n90.\n\nThe Streets: “Weak Become Heroes” (2002)\n\nThe fourth single from the Streets’ 2002 album, Original Pirate Material, jettisoned the cocky Cockney mirth and the jovial 2-step skip of its predecessors in favor of a gently swinging, genuinely heartfelt piano-house ballad. The object of Mike Skinner’s then-24-year-old affections? His first E, its dizzy new heights breathlessly described with a storyteller’s pitch-perfect eye for detail, right down to “Mad little events happen,” which should ring true for anyone who’s ever puzzled over the jigsaw contours of the chemical night. Rising piano chords and muted drums carry as if from at the far end of the field; Skinner metes out observations like crumbly Mitsubishi quarters to the new mates gathered around him, the “weak become heroes” who are both audience and subject of his starry-eyed tale of rave’s star-crossed generation. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen: The Streets: “Weak Become Heroes”\n\n89.\n\nThe Postal Service: “Such Great Heights” (2003)\n\nReally, the Postal Service’s sound was an inevitable development. Just as laptops begin infiltrating stages and indie rock began to finally turn away from years of anti-electronic orthodoxy, Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello made themselves the odds-on favorites to play genre husbandry when “(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan” grabbed ears on Tamborello’s 2001 Dntel album. So the world was ready for “Such Great Heights” when it finally appeared, a salad of itchy microhouse beats and pointillist synthesizers rescuing Gibbard’s dreamy love song from congealing into a thick Jack Johnson sap (a hazard Iron & Wine helpfully demonstrated). Go ahead and blame the Postal Service for launching the subsequent decade of lazy lap-pop, but it’s a “blame Star Wars for Transformers 2” sort of haterade, assigning guilt to Gibbard and Tamborello for making an updated synth-pop song so perfect, it introduced a new vocabulary to emo kids’ bedrooms, for better or (mostly) worse. –Rob Mitchum\n\nListen: The Postal Service: “Such Great Heights”\n\n88.\n\nThe New Pornographers: “Letter From an Occupant” (2002)\n\nCarl Newman certainly knows his way around a hook, and I can count three distinct, why-not-just-build-a-song-around-me candidates in the New Pornographers’ barnburning “Letter From an Occupant”: the chorus, of course, “where have all sensations gone?”, and the “song is shaking me” bit. So you take one of Newman’s most strident earworms from a decade that found him in no short supply of them, get the incomparable Neko Case to wow and flutter over top in what’s almost certainly her finest vocal performance on a New Pornographers record, have your band of sorta-superstars pound out some no-nonsense neon behind it, and whaddya know, there’s nary a second that goes by that could be any catchier. Show offs. –Paul Thompson\n\nListen: The New Pornographers: “Letter From an Occupant”\n\n87.\n\nMike Jones: “Still Tippin’” [ft. Paul Wall and Slim Thug] (2005)\n\n“I got the internet goin’ nuts,” Paul Wall drawled near the end of “Still Tippin’”, a weirdly arcane boast at the time but absolutely a true one. Back in the pre-YouTube days of late 2004, the grainy BET Uncut video for “Still Tippin’”, later recut without the girl blowing Slim Thug in the Escalade, circulated online and set everyone to Googling. The appeal of the song wasn’t quite in the rapping, though the rumble-voiced Slim easily won MVP honors there. Instead, it was the hazy, trapped-in-amber feel of the song, the way Salih Williams’ mournful violin moan slowly floated above the trunk-rattling bass, the way the rappers’ unflappable voices lazily wound their way through everything, encapsulating the city’s slow-crawl aesthetic in one bite-size chunk.\n\nAfter “Still Tippin’”, every rapper on the song got a major-label contract, as did half the rappers in the city. None of them became stars, and none of them recaptured the magic of this song. But “Still Tippin’” still sounds like steam rising off hot asphalt. –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: Mike Jones: “Still Tippin’” [ft. Paul Wall and Slim Thug]\n\n86.\n\nMclusky: “To Hell With Good Intentions” (2002)\n\nBy the early 2000s, indie rock had grown largely disconnected from its 80s post-hardcore roots, trading in once-prized qualities like dissonance and provocation for cuddly, campfire collectivism or synth-pop sleekness. But these three cranky Welshmen weren’t going down without a fight– or at least a good larf. Over a bruising backbeat and a riff that feels like chewed tinfoil, Andy Falkous unleashes a veritable Quote-of-the-Day calendar of one-liners (“My band is better than your band/ We got more songs than a song convention”) that skewer the sport of indie-elitist one-upmanship. But the most resonant lines are the least cheeky: “When we gonna torch the restaurant? When we gonna get excited?”– desperate pleas for anarchic abandon that would go unanswered at a time when popular indie rock was forsaking its core contrarian ideologies in favor of strategic placements on episodes of “The O.C.” and Starbucks display racks. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen: Mclusky: “To Hell With Good Intentions”\n\n85.\n\nPhoenix: “Long Distance Call” (2006)\n\nThe best moment during “Long Distance Call” is when singer Thomas Mars, in the second verse, draws the line between “doing well well well” and “only doing just fine.” If that were the entire emotional spectrum the peppy, perpetually lovelost Mars experienced, no one would be surprised. But “Long Distance Call” draws a tension between Mars’ laissez-faire mantra-making (“Your capital letters keep me asking for more”) and his bandmates’ up-off-the-floor-there-pal riffing.\n\n“Long Distance Call” is a song about... well, I’m not sure exactly, only about one-third of the lyrics make any sense, which means it’s probably a song about being lost, or at least away (phones– check; lack of cash– check). Like the best summer flings, college road trips, Parisian honeymoons, Phoenix manage to turn romantic confusion and map-less wayfaring into a statement of independence. –Andrew Gaerig\n\nListen: Phoenix: “Long Distance Call”\n\n84.\n\nPeter Bjorn and John: “Young Folks” [ft. Victoria Bergsman] (2006)\n\nLike Jonny Greenwood’s electric-guitar hiccups on Radiohead’s “Creep”, the insidious whistled melody of Peter Bjorn and John’s “Young Folks” was an unintentional, rough-draft accoutrement that effectively catapulted the Swedish trio from indie-pop upstarts to international It Band. But it’s what happens between all that tootin’ that really set our iPods on repeat, with Peter Morén and guest vocalist Victoria Bergstrom (formerly of the Concretes) acting out a tentative courtship between two aloof hipsters who only seem to express any emotion during the rousing chorus, in which they effectively admit they don’t have any (“All we care about is talking/ Talking over me and you”). Innumerable TV-soundtrack appearances and a Kanye endorsement would soon follow, but perhaps the most telling indicator of the song’s remarkable success was that Peter Bjorn and John felt the need to react against it with a difficult follow-up album (2009’s Living Thing). –Stuart Berman\n\nListen: Peter Bjorn and John: “Young Folks” [ft. Victoria Bergsman]\n\n83.\n\nBasement Jaxx: “Where’s Your Head At?” (2001)\n\nMost dance music evokes pleasure of one kind or another: movement, sex, freedom. The evil, grinning genius of “Where’s Your Head At?” is that it’s a doctrinaire house record in some ways, but it’s about a really bad trip: failure, stasis, friends getting antsy while you’re stuck in a K-hole. In lieu of factory-sterile, aerodynamic electronics, there are totally septic analog synthesizers lifted from a pair of Gary Numan songs, decorated with an unusually dissonant version of Basement Jaxx’s habitual vacuum-abhorring sound effects and drop-ins. The vocals are a three-dimensional array of disembodied heads screaming that something’s wrong and you’re letting everyone down. The song surges forward into the darkness like a flood in a tunnel (maybe the reason it made its biggest impact on the Tomb Raider soundtrack). And it’s totally hilarious in the context of its era’s sleek, muscular, cheerful dance music. –Douglas Wolk\n\nListen: Basement Jaxx: “Where’s Your Head At?”\n\n82.\n\nRobyn: “Be Mine” (2005)\n\nSometime between 2005, when Robyn released “Be Mine” in her native Sweden, and last year, when the single finally hit charts beyond Scandinavia, somebody added an exclamation point. Unnecessary! Except to drive home something you’ve probably already noticed: This utterly heartbroken song has a title phrase you see on chalky-tasting Valentine’s Day candy.\n\nExclamation or not, “Be Mine” is made of such paradoxes. Poised vocals express overwhelming emotion. “Racing heartstrings” (as Stephen Deusner said in a p4k review) adorn depressive lyrics. And the spoken-word section, starring old Whatsername’s shoelaces, recounts a scene any real narrator would’ve been too distraught to remember so touchingly. In indie rock, where craft is sometimes viewed with suspicion, angst makes singers sound like Conor Oberst; even Annie’s “Heartbeat”, which opened many indie listeners’ ears to Scandinavian pop in 2004, remains vocally icy and detached. “Be Mine” works by expertly using all the tools of commercial, instantly communicative pop– even when what’s being communicated is deep personal anguish. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: Robyn: “Be Mine”\n\n81.\n\nDeerhunter: “Nothing Ever Happened” (2008)\n\n“Nothing Ever Happened” came at a moment when Bradford Cox seemingly spent all his time doing one of two things: compulsively writing a litany of often-great songs about the fallibility of his memory and body, and issuing public correctives for the fallibility of his big mouth. Both tendencies made Deerhunter one of the decade’s most continually compelling acts, and both come to a head on “Nothing”, easily the band’s best song. As an aughts indie epic of cathartic self-loathing, the song is Deerhunter’s own “The Rat”, but the failure to go out and see people is the last thing on Deerhunter’s mind. Cox’s terrors are buried deep inside, and to the degree he’s able to access them, they’re released with hushed, uncomplicated passion that finds the perfect fit between Poe, post-punk, and pot. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: Deerhunter: “Nothing Ever Happened”\n\n80.\n\nLil Wayne: “A Milli” (2008)\n\nThat tinkling soundtrack trill on the intro is such a great fakeout, with producer Bangladesh mocking late-decade rap’s orchestral fixation before letting the insanity start. And then there it is: the bubbling mantra refrain, the eyepunch snare-hits, the ravenous bass thud. “A Milli” has the simplest beat this side of “Grindin’”, but the feeling you get from it isn’t spartan crunch; it’s gibbering chaos. Part of it is that bent vocal sample, and part of it is Wayne himself, disappearing down rabbit hole after rabbit hole. Bangladesh later complained that Wayne didn’t follow up the millionaire concept of that hammering beat, that he just freestyled the song. But that’s the magic of “A Milli”; it sounds like a random four-minute excerpt from a freestyle that could’ve gone for hours, Wayne chasing tangents until they become catchphrases. What’s a goon to a goblin? Nobody even knows what that means, but there’s a reason none of the hundreds of rappers who manhandled the “A Milli” beat on mixtape freestyles could ever equal the original. (FYI: Fabolous came closest.) –Tom Breihan\n\nListen: Lil Wayne: “A Milli”\n\n79.\n\nJay-Z: “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” (2001)\n\n“Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” is essentially an autobiographical song, but the details of the lyrics are so secondary to the track’s feeling of sustained triumphalism that the only thing that comes across loud and clear is the notion that Jay-Z is a force of unstoppable greatness. Self-hagiography has always been a dominant lyrical theme in rap, but the magic here is in the way a young, hungry Kanye West brings out the joy in the rapper’s swagger by framing it in the context of the Jackson 5’s ebullient “I Want You Back” and transfers his ecstatic egomania to the listener like a contact high. At the start, Hov thanks us all for showing up, because we could have been anywhere in the world. Back in late 2001 when it seemed like the Apocalypse was an imminent possibility, there could not have been a more appealing place to be than basking in the glow of this man’s supreme confidence. –Matthew Perpetua\n\nListen: Jay-Z: “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)”\n\n78.\n\nFreelance Hellraiser: “A Stroke of Genius” (2001)\n\nThe golden rule of mash-ups is the same as it was in 2002: if you can’t show us something new about the source material, don’t bother. It was broken a lot back then, and even more now, but Freelance Hellraiser at least set the bar high. Christina Aguilera and the Strokes find smolder in one another, Aguilera’s purring sultriness transforming the ache in “Hard to Explain” from world-weariness to frustrated desire. Impressively, the Hellraiser predicted the arc of 00s teenpop with this– its turn away from bubblegum R&B to guitar-driven confessionals. While most mash-ups read and play like gimmicks, “A Stroke of Genius” skips free of its origins and fits into the world of Kelly Clarkson and the Veronicas as, simply, a standout pop song. –Tom Ewing\n\nListen: Freelance Hellraiser: “A Stroke of Genius”\n\n77.\n\nThree 6 Mafia: “Stay Fly” (2005)\n\nA bruising round robin about getting so high your speech sounds screwed and chopped before the remix. By 2005, everyone had heard a soul sample, but most listeners were still getting used to the profound lethargy of tracks like “Still Tippin’”– and “Stay Fly” had both. Tom Breihan called it a “curious departure” in his review of Most Known Unknown, but I’ll dissent. True, for guys who built their reputation barking at each other over minor-key piano arpeggios and airless beats, double-time rapping over a soul sample probably sounded like a sellout. (And it sold– their first Top 20 single since forming in 1991.) But the way they flipped it– it glimmered like a knife under a streetlight; like Psycho, luxurious without losing its edge. –Mike Powell\n\nListen: Three 6 Mafia: “Stay Fly”\n\n76.\n\nHot Chip: “Ready for the Floor” (2007)\n\nIt’s apropos that the group which put the geek back in funk better than anyone this decade would morph dancing and debate so seamlessly, and cleverly. On the “do it” front, “Ready for the Floor” is the best paean to shaking ass-as-shyness shedding since Marvin Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up”. It’s almost as funky and twice as nerdy, to boot. From the “say it” perspective, “Ready” offers a hand to take the lead in conversation, giving the impression that something important needs to see daylight. The lyrical sentiment might be purposefully illusory, but combine it with that wobbly rhythm and sour synth, and there’s no mistaking that “Ready” is twerpy, charming, intelligent, and irresistible. –Eric Harvey\n\nListen: Hot Chip: “Ready for the Floor”\n\n75.\n\nAaliyah: “Try Again” (2000)\n\nTimbaland’s late-90s work with Aaliyah helped usher in an era of R&B singles as modernist pop events– “Try Again” has a claim to be its peak. At the time Timbaland’s use of acid house’s signature 303 bassline sound caught the attention: a decade on what strikes me is how well it suits the song, and its singer. Aaliyah’s great necessary quality as Timbaland’s muse and chief interpreter was poise, the ability to deal nervelessly with whatever fresh unlikeliness he conjured. This lack of showiness led some to di"
