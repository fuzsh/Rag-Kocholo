        "text": "When people hear their favorite song, they are urged to show off their signature dance moves. Music makes people move their bodies, whether a song brings back memories of past dance eras or allows listeners to get lost in the beat.\n\nSince music and movement are so closely connected, it's no wonder that artists have used \"dance\" in their song titles. While some songs hold lyrical content about actually dancing, other songs tend to have deeper meanings. From ballads to uptempo tracks, here are 25 songs that can encourage listeners to do a little two-step.\n\n1 of 25\n\n“I Wanna Dance With Somebody” by Whitney Houston\n\nFrederic REGLAIN/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nIn 1987, Whitney Houston released “I Wanna Dance With Somebody.” She realizes her loneliness without a special someone by her side and would rather spend time with a life partner. “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” became a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n2 of 25\n\n“I Hope You Dance” by Lee Ann Womack\n\nJohn Shearer/Getty Images for CMT/ViacomCBS\n\nLee Ann Womack’s 2000 single “I Hope You Dance\" holds a much deeper meaning than one showing off their dance moves. Throughout the track, Womack is encouraging listeners to take chances, stay faithful, and live life like there is no tomorrow. In addition to the song being a hit across numerous Billboard charts, it won a Grammy Award for Best Country Song.\n\n3 of 25\n\n“Lose Yourself to Dance” by Daft Punk feat. Pharrell Williams\n\nMichael Kovac/WireImage\n\nElectronic duo Daft Punk recruited Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers to work on the funky single “Lose Yourself to Dance.” Pharrell is repeatedly encouraging listeners to slow down in life and release any stress by dancing.\n\n4 of 25\n\n“Dance, Dance\" by Fall Out Boy\n\nDan MacMedan/Getty Images\n\nIn 2005, punk rock band Fall Out Boy released their sophomore album, From Under the Cork Tree. It garnered three singles, including the guitar-heavy “Dance, Dance.” On the track, the protagonist details being awkwardly infatuated with a girl and getting a chance to dance with her, but he’s actually hoping to have an intimate night with her. “Dance, “Dance” became a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n5 of 25\n\n“Dance Tonight\" by Lucy Pearl\n\nTim Mosenfelder/Getty Images\n\nIn the late ‘90s, Raphael Saadiq recruited En Vogue's Dawn Robinson and A Tribe Called Quest's Ali Shaheed Muhammad to form the R&B supergroup Lucy Pearl. The group’s lead single, “Dance Tonight,” was a smooth highlight of going out to have a good time.\n\n6 of 25\n\n“Just Dance” by Lady Gaga feat. Colby O’Donis\n\nSamir Hussein/Getty Images for Live Nation\n\nIn 2008, Lady Gaga put the pop world on notice with her debut single, “Just Dance.” She teamed up with Akon and producer RedOne to bring the dance track alive, along with additional vocals from Colby O’Donis.

As he says on the hook, “I need a one dance / Got a Hennessy in my hand / One more time ‘fore I go / Higher powers taking a hold on me.”\n\n8 of 25\n\n“Let’s Dance” by David Bowie\n\nNILS MEILVANG/AFP via Getty Images\n\nChic member Nile Rodgers produced David Bowie’s 1983 hit single “Let’s Dance,” and his signature guitar sound was evident throughout the song. \"Let's Dance\" was widely successful in Bowie's discography and sampled by Diddy on his hit song \"Been Around The World.\"\n\n9 of 25\n\n“Last Dance” by Donna Summer\n\nHarry Langdon/Getty Images\n\nDonna Summer always made songs that could get people to the dance floor. She’s often referred to as the Queen of Disco. Her hit song “Last Dance” starts as a ballad, but then Summer takes it up a notch to sound like an essential uptempo disco track. The song could easily have two meanings: having one last chance at love or dancing before the disco closes.\n\n10 of 25\n\n“Dancing Queen” by ABBA\n\nHulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nWhen disco was taking over in the ‘70s, pop group ABBA decided to follow suit with “Dancing Queen.” On the track, the group details the joy of dancing from beginning to end: “You can dance / You can jive / Having the time of your life / Ooh, see that girl / Watch that scene / Digging the dancing queen.”\n\n11 of 25\n\n“After The Dance” by Marvin Gaye\n\nJim Britt/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nThe smooth sound of Marvin Gaye’s voice is sure to take any listener to another realm.

Normani\n\nToni Anne Barson/WireImage\n\nSam Smith teamed up with Normani on their smooth 2019 hit “Dancing With A Stranger.” On the track, Smith and Normani detail their loneliness while dealing with a breakup. While trying to move on, they find themselves going out and dancing with someone new.\n\n18 of 25\n\n“Everybody Dance” by Chic\n\nJeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nDisco and funk band Chic rose to prominence in the ‘70s with a number of upbeat singles, including “Everybody Dance.” The song is about how music can make anyone feel good, as stated in the first verse: “Music never lets you do down / Puts a smile on your face, anytime, anyplace / Dancing helps relieve the pain / Soothes your mind, makes you happy again.”\n\n19 of 25\n\n“Dancing In The Street” by Martha Reeves and The Vandellas\n\nRB/Redferns\n\nWhen people think of the prime Motown sound, “Dancing In The Street” always comes to mind. Martha Reeves and The Vandellas use the song to encourage people to have a good time, no matter where they are in the world. “Dancing In The Street” reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n20 of 25\n\n“Dance Again” by Jennifer Lopez and Pitbull\n\nChristopher Polk/Billboard Awards 2014/Getty Images for DCP\n\nIn 2012, Jennifer Lopez decided to release a greatest hits album, and she teamed up with Pitbull for the lead single, “Dance Again.” On the track, Lopez encourages people to continue to live life and dance, even when things don’t always turn out as they hoped.\n\n21 of 25\n\n“The Humpty Dance” by Digital Underground\n\nEarl Gibson III/Getty Images\n\nSometimes songs come with actual dance moves. That was the case for Digital Underground’s 1990 hit “The Humpty Dance.” The group's frontman Shock G had an alter ego called Humpty Hump. On the track, he introduces this alias and shows confidence in his signature dance. \"The Humpty Dance\" peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n22 of 25\n\n“You Should Be Dancing” by Bee Gees\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nThe Bee Gees were a dominant trio in the disco era, and their hit song \"You Should Be Dancing\" gave them strong headway during that time. For people who recall the movie Saturday Night Fever, the song was used during one of John Travolta's scenes on a dance floor.\n\n23 of 25\n\n“Dance to the Music” by Sly and The Family Stone\n\nGAB Archive/Redferns\n\nFunk band Sly and The Family Stone always created music that could get people moving. With simplistic lyrics about adding different instruments on their 1967 single “Dance to the Music,” the track sounds like a demo that eventually turned into a solid dance track.\n\n24 of 25\n\n“Dancing in the Dark” by Bruce Springsteen\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images for The Rainforest Fund\n\nRock legend Bruce Springsteen was feeling the pressure of writing a hit song, but his pen slump worked in his favor when he released “Dancing in the Dark.” The hit song became his highest-charting single to date.\n\n25 of 25\n\nDancing Machine” by The Jackson 5\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nIn 1974, The Jackson 5 released their groovy single “Dancing Machine.” On the track, the brothers describe a woman who’s also a great dancer — someone who shows off her moves at any given moment — while keeping all eyes on her. \"Dancing Machine\" reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nMya Singleton is a freelance music journalist and social strategist based in the Bay Area, with experience covering R&B and hip-hop.
