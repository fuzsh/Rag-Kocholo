It reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming a defining track of the Britpop movement as well as Pulp's signature song.[2] In 2014, BBC Radio 6 Music listeners voted it their favourite Britpop song in an online poll.[3] In a 2015 Rolling Stone readers' poll it was voted the greatest Britpop song.[4]\n\nThe song is a critique of the wealthy wanting to be \"like common people\" – ascribing glamour to poverty.[5] This phenomenon is referred to as slumming or \"class tourism\".[5] The song was written by the band members Jarvis Cocker, Nick Banks, Candida Doyle, Steve Mackey and Russell Senior. Cocker had conceived the song after meeting a Greek art student while studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London (the college and the student feature in the lyrics). He came up with the tune on a Casiotone keyboard he had bought in a music store in Notting Hill, west London.\n\nJustin Myers of the Official Charts Company wrote the song \"was typical Pulp – a biting satire of posh people 'roughing it' and acting like tourists by hanging with the \"common people\". Jarvis delivered his scathing putdown with glee, in an iconic music video, directed by Pedro Romhanyi,[6] featuring actress Sadie Frost as the posh woman on the receiving end of Jarvis' acid tongue.\"[2] Pulp first performed the song in public during the band's set at the Reading Festival in August 1994. A year later, they performed it at Glastonbury Festival as the headline act. The song has since been covered by various artists. In 2004, a Ben Folds-produced cover version by William Shatner brought \"Common People\" to new audiences outside Europe.\n\nInspiration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe idea for the song's lyrics came from an art student from Greece whom Pulp singer-songwriter Jarvis Cocker met while he was studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Cocker had enrolled in a film studies course at the college in September 1988 while taking a break from Pulp. He spoke about the song's inspiration in NME in 2013:\n\nI'd met the girl from the song many years before, when I was at St Martin's College. I'd met her on a sculpture course, but at St Martin's you had a thing called Crossover Fortnight, where you had to do another discipline for a couple of weeks. I was studying film, and she might've been doing painting, but we both decided to do sculpture for two weeks. I don't know her name. It would've been around 1988, so it was already ancient history when I wrote about her.[7]\n\nIn a 2012 question-and-answer session on BBC Radio 5 Live, Cocker said that he was having a conversation with the girl at the bar at college because he was attracted to her, but he found some aspects of her personality unpleasant. He remembered that at one point she had told him she \"wanted to move to Hackney and live like 'the common people.'\" Cocker used this phrase as the starting point for the song and embellished the situation for dramatic effect, for example reversing the situation in the song when the female character declares that \"I want to sleep with common people like you\" (Cocker said that in real life he had been the one wanting to sleep with the girl, and she had not been interested in him).[8] Taking this inspiration, the narrator explains that his female acquaintance can \"never be like common people\" because even if she gets a flat where \"roaches climb the wall\" ultimately, \"if [she] called [her] dad he could stop it all\", in contrast to the true common people who can only \"watch [their] lives slide out of view\".\n\nA BBC Three documentary failed to locate the woman, who, Cocker stated, could have been in any fine art course but that \"sculpture\" sounded better.[9] The lyrics were in part a response by Cocker, who usually focused on the introspective and emotional aspects of pop, to more politically minded members of the band like Russell Senior. Furthermore, Cocker felt that 'slumming' was becoming a dominant theme in popular culture and this contributed to the single's rushed release. Cocker said \"it seemed to be in the air, that kind of patronising social voyeurism...I felt that of Parklife, for example, or Natural Born Killers – there is that noble savage notion. But if you walk round a council estate, there's plenty of savagery and not much nobility going on.\"[10]\n\nIn May 2015, Greek newspaper Athens Voice suggested that the woman who inspired the song is Danae Stratou, wife of Yanis Varoufakis, a former Greek finance minister. Stratou studied at St. Martin's between 1983 and 1988 and is the eldest daughter of a wealthy Greek businessman.[11] Greek newspaper Ta Nea contacted Stratou, who replied that \"I think the only person who knows for whom the song was written is Jarvis himself!\",[12] but the London Evening Standard reported that an email exchange with Varoufakis indicated that there was truth in the rumour.[13] Katerina Kana, a Greek-Cypriot who also studied at St. Martins during that time, has claimed since 2012 that the song was about herself,[14] but Cocker has not commented on this claim.\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\nCocker came up with the tune on a small Casiotone MT-500 keyboard he had bought from the Music & Video Exchange shop in Notting Hill in west London. He thought the melody \"seemed kind of catchy, but I didn't think too much about it\".[15] When he played it at rehearsals to the other members of the band, most of them were unimpressed; Steve Mackey said it reminded him of Emerson, Lake & Palmer's 1977 hit single \"Fanfare for the Common Man\".[16] Keyboardist Candida Doyle was the only member of the group who spotted the potential of the tune, saying \"I just thought it was great straight away. It must have been the simplicity of it, and you could just tell it was a really powerful song then.\"[17] Cocker then wrote the lyrics inspired by his time in London. The song was first performed in public during the band's set at the Reading Festival in August 1994: Cocker revealed that he had written the majority of the lyrics the night before the band's performance, and he had trouble remembering them on stage the following day.[7]\n\nThe band realised they had \"written something that had slight pretensions to anthemic\"[18] and wanted to find a producer that could give them a big-sounding record. Veteran producer Chris Thomas was chosen and the single was recorded in a two-week period at The Town House in London.[19] The group used all 48 tracks of the studio, filling them with a variety of sounds from keyboards and even a Stylophone to create the anthemic sound they were looking for: Thomas remembered that the band \"were just coming up with stuff all the time, it was just trying things on here and there.\"[20] To keep the single at around four minutes, the final verses that begin \"Like a dog lying in a corner\" were omitted, although they appear on the album version. These include the peak of the crescendo where Cocker reduces to an intense whisper and describes the life of \"common people\".[9]\n\nThe tune bears \"more than a passing resemblance\" to the song \"Los Amantes\" by the Spanish group Mecano, which came out in 1988. However, Pulp were not accused of plagiarism despite the similarity.[21]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Common People\" was directed by Pedro Romhanyi,[6] featuring an appearance from actress Sadie Frost and a dance routine improvised by Cocker on the day of shooting.[9] The video also features a homage to the \"Eleanor Rigby\" sequence in the animated film Yellow Submarine, with everyday people stuck in repeating loops lasting less than a second. The club scenes were filmed inside Stepney's Nightclub on Commercial Road in the East End of London. The nightclub still had its original décor, including a 1970s dance floor, and was described as a \"cultural icon\" when under threat of demolition in 2007.[22]\n\nSleeve artwork\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Common People\" was released on two CD singles, one a 'day-time CD' and the other a 'night-time CD', both showing the band sitting in a café at different times of day. Four posters available on the band's 2011 tour showed a classic Pulp record sleeve, with photography notes beneath. For the poster of the \"Common People\" 'day-time' CD single it read:\n\nLOCATION: Frank's Sandwich Bar, Addison Bridge Place, London W4 (eat-in and takeaway available)\n\nTIME: 4:05pm, Wednesday 30 November 1994\n\nPHOTOGRAPHER: Donald Milne\n\nCAMERA: 1979 Hasselblad 500CM with 80mm lens\n\nFILM STOCK: Fuji Super G-400 (pushed 2 stops)\n\nDESIGN: The Designer's Republic™\n\nORIGINAL SLEEVE NOTES: \"There is a war in progress, don't be a casualty. The time to decide whose side you're on is here. Choose wisely. Stay alive in '95.\"\n\nReception and legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Common People\" was a very popular song of the Britpop era with many critics praising Cocker's lyrics. The song was popular in the US music press. Larry Flick of Billboard wrote 'Layered in the fabric of \"Common People\" are soft keyboard threads and a majestic weave of blazing guitars. All this and witty lyrics to boot.'[23] Andrew Mueller from Melody Maker named it Single of the Week, noting that it 'is remarkable for the eloquence with which it articulates the envy vs snobbery dynamic inspired by all good class struggles.'[24] Another Melody Maker editor, Simon Reynolds, commented, 'Its populis sentiments are anchored in a specific, one-on-one instance of class combat. It's personal: the song smarts with the humiliation of being patronised, and takes revenge with gloating glee. The title itself is jarring, a reminder: I'd forgotten the word common could even be used in that snobbish sense, outside Alan Bennett plays like \"A Chip in the Sugar\".'[25] Music & Media wrote 'Playing with electro and indie guitar pop like Blur on \"Girls & Boys\", Pulp come close to Kim Wilde's \"Kids in America\" with the intro to the Sex Pistols' \"Anarchy in the UK\".'[26] Music Week gave the double single 5 out of 5, adding that the song \"is epic-length Pulp\".[27] Sylvia Patterson from NME named it Mirth-Quakingly Obvious Single of the Week, writing, \"A sound pop idea honed eloquently into a grand colossus of vindication in velveteen trews, this is the one that bestrides Jarvis' gifts for jocular panache and moulded songsmithery and radiates in the pop nook this week as Pulp's very own 'Sympathy for the Devil'. With even more jokes.\"[28] Charles Aaron of Spin considered it to be \"smarter than Blur, and slyer than Elastica\". He wrote that \"Pulp finally conquered the British charts with this exhilarating slag on class slumming.\"[29] He later ranked the song at No. 2 on his pick of the singles of 1996.[30]\n\nThe song was Pulp's most popular single and has featured on more than 16 compilation albums since its original release. In 2006, an hour-long documentary on the song's composition and cultural impact was broadcast on BBC Three. In 2007, NME magazine placed \"Common People\" at No. 3 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. Rock: The Rough Guide said that on the single's parent album Different Class, Cocker was \"[s]tripping away the glamour from Britpop's idealization of the working class\" (it had been performed on a TV programme called Britpop Now), and described the song as the centrepiece of the album and \"one of the singles of the 90s\".[31] In a poll by the Triple J in July 2009, the Pulp original was placed at No. 81 on its \"Hottest 100 of All Time\" from over 500,000 votes cast.[32]\n\nIn September 2010, Pitchfork listed \"Common People\" at No. 2 on their list of the Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s.[33] In April 2014, listeners of BBC Radio 6 Music voted it as their favourite 'Britpop' song in an online poll conducted by the station to celebrate 20 years since the start of the Britpop era. DJ Steve Lamacq said: \"It is one of the defining records of Britpop because it seemed to embrace the essence of the time so perfectly.\"[3] In 2014, Paste also ranked \"Common People\" at No. 1 in its list of The 50 Best Britpop Songs.[34] In 2015, Rolling Stone readers voted it the greatest Britpop song in a poll.[4] As of October 2014 the single had sold 430,000 copies.[2]\n\nIn 2021, it was listed at No. 75 on Rolling Stone's \"Top 500 Best Songs of All Time\".[8]\n\nOther Pulp versions\n\n[edit]\n\nDifferent versions of \"Common People\" exist, including the recording from Pulp's headline act at Glastonbury Festival in 1995, a \"Vocoda\" mix and a radically different \"Motiv8 club mix\", which also appeared on the single \"Sorted for E's & Wizz\".[35] The Vocoda mix later featured on the 2-disc version of Different Class, which was released in 2006.\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\nAll songs were written and composed by Jarvis Cocker, Nick Banks, Steve Mackey, Russell Senior and Candida Doyle except where noted.\n\nUK CD1 and cassette single[36][37]\n\n\"Common People\" (full-length version) – 5:51\n\n\"Underwear\" – 4:07\n\n\"Common People\" (7-inch edit) – 4:07\n\nUK CD2[38]\n\n\"Common People\" (full-length version) – 5:51\n\n\"Razzmatazz\" (acoustic version) – 4:05\n\n\"Dogs Are Everywhere\" (acoustic version) (Jarvis Cocker, Russell Senior, Candida Doyle, Magnus Doyle, Peter Mansell) – 3:05\n\n\"Joyriders\" (acoustic version) – 3:31\n\nUK 7-inch yellow vinyl single[39]\n\n\"Common People\" (7-inch edit) – 4:07\n\n\"Underwear\" – 4:07\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nPulp\n\nJarvis Cocker – vocals, organ, acoustic guitar\n\nCandida Doyle – synthesizers\n\nMark Webber – electric guitars\n\nSteve Mackey – bass guitar\n\nRussell Senior – violin\n\nNick Banks – drums, tambourine\n\nAdditional personnel\n\nAnne Dudley – piano\n\nChris Thomas – producer, stylophone\n\nOlle Romo – programming\n\nDavid 'Chipper' Nicholas – engineering\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales Spain (PROMUSICAE)[53] Gold 30,000‡ United Kingdom (BPI)[54] 2× Platinum 1,200,000‡\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Date Format(s) Label(s) Ref.

Reviewers were pleasantly surprised by Shatner's spoken-word presentation of Cocker's tirade against class tourism as Shatner's previous work had been widely mocked by reviewers.[60][61] Folds abruptly replaces Shatner's voice with that of singer Joe Jackson, and then alternates and blends the two into a duet, bringing along a large chorus of young voices on the line \"sing along with the common people\", which finally replace Shatner and Jackson's vocals in the song's concluding crescendo.\n\nIn 2011, Cocker praised the cover version: \"I was very flattered by that because I was a massive Star Trek fan as a kid and so you know, Captain Kirk is singing my song! So that was amazing.\"[62]\n\nIn a listeners' poll by Australian radio station Triple J, this cover version was ranked No. 21 on its Hottest 100 of 2004 poll. In 2007, a ballet called Common People, set to the songs from Has Been, was created by Margo Sappington and performed by the Milwaukee Ballet.\n\nOther covers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, impressionist Rory Bremner performed a version of the song, as sung by David Cameron on Channel 4's Bremner, Bird and Fortune.[63]\n\nAmerican rock band My Chemical Romance covered \"Common People\" multiple times on stage during their 2010-2011 World Contamination Tour. In an interview, lead singer Gerard Way explained that the song was important to him growing up because it \"speaks to regular people.\"[64]\n\nUK dark wave band Libitina covered the song as \"Gothic People\", with subtly altered lyrics referencing clichés of the goth subculture.[65][66][67]\n\nIn February 2019, the news website Joe.ie released a speech sampled parody version of the song with the British Brexit supporting MP Jacob Rees-Mogg supposedly singing \"I want to leave the Common Market\" instead of \"I want to sleep with common people\".[68]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nLove of the Common People\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
