        "text": "5. “Disco 2000” – Pulp\n\n(From the album Different Class)\n\n1995\n\nAfter the success of the lead single “Common People” Pulp was suddenly seen as one of the biggest bands in Britain. A status that was only confirmed when the band filled in for The Stone Roses at the last minute at the Glastonbury Festival and had a triumphant performance. The band followed up this performance and “Common People” with the release of the double A-side single “Sorted For E’s & Wizz/Mis-Shapes”. The single generated huge controversy in the UK when an article in the Daily Mirror ran under the headline BAN THIS SICK STUNT and accused the song of being “pro-drugs” due to the lyrics and instructions in the packaging that showed how to conceal amphetamines in a homemade wrap. In the article, the author, Kate Thornton, called for the BBC to ban the song. Jarvis Cocker replied a few days later a denied that the song had a pro-drugs message and argued that Thornton had misunderstood both the lyrics and the intent of the packaging. Ultimately, Pulp agreed to change the packaging and the Daily Mirror printed Cocker’s rebuttal statement. In the end though the controversy only helped the single gain attention and “Sorted For E’s & Wizz/Mis-Shapes” followed “Common People” to #2 on the charts in the UK. The next single Pulp released was “Disco 2000”, an upbeat yet vaguely melancholy dance-rock song inspired by Laura Branigan’s 80’s hit “Gloria” and featuring lyrics by Cocker based on an actual girl he had a crush on while growing up. “Disco 2000” was another UK Top 10 for Pulp, peaking at #7 and has become one of the band’s best-known and most loved songs in the years since."
