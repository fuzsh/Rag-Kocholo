        "text": "It Marked Britney Spears' Big Break\n\nLong before Spears turned into one of music's most recognizable stars, she was just another fledgling young singer searching for her way in the ruthless industry.\n\nAfter stints as part of \"The New Mickey Mouse Club\" and a turn on \"Star Search,\" the young singer dodged two life paths that could have changed everything. First thinking that she'd develop a sound similar to Sheryl Crow, Spears then nearly joined the R&B girl group Innocence. But once the Kentwood, Louisiana native signed with Jive Records — which had a working relationship with a group of buzzy producers in Sweden — the teen singer's future was sealed.\n\nThe Song's Success Recentered Pop Production In Sweden\n\nJive executives had early success with the visionary Swedish producer Denniz Pop, who had a dream that his Nordic country would become the center of popular music. First producing hits for Ace of Base such as \"All That She Wants,\" the mastermind subsequently crafted the Backstreet Boys' iconic sound (including \"As Long as You Love Me\"). His Cheiron Studios in Stockholm was named after the wise centaur who played a Lyre in Greek mythology.\n\nJust as his dream was coming true however, the producer was diagnosed with stomach cancer and died one month before the release of \"...Baby One More Time\" in August 1998. But while sick, he passed on his techniques and vision to a range of mentees including Max Martin, a former rocker turned pop-producer. \"(The Cheiron sound is) direct, effective, (and) we don't show off,\" Martin said in 2001.\n\nIt Launched Max Martin's Historic Career…\n\nThe melody of \"...Baby\" came to Martin as he was falling asleep. Not wanting it to escape him, he recorded it. \"I remember listening back to (the tape) after (the song) blew up and you can hear me sort of go: 'Hit me baby one more time,' he recalled in a 1998 interview of the song he'd later write and producer. \"Then I hear myself say, 'Yeah, it's pretty good.'\"\n\n\"...Baby\" later became his first No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit of his ongoing career, a feat he reached a whopping 25 times with songs ranging from Taylor Swift's \"Shake it Off\" and \"Blank Space\" and The Weeknd's \"Can't Feel My Face\" to name a few. In fact, Martin is second-only to Paul McCartney and John Lennon as the songwriter with the most No. 1 hits in the history of the charts.\n\n…And Changed The Trajectory Of TLC's\n\nTLC almost recorded the future smash. However, the R&B group were turned off by its lyrics, thinking that \"Hit me\" was meant to be taken literally.\n\nSaid TLC member T-Boz of the decision: \"I was like: 'I like the song but do I think it's a hit? Do I think it's TLC?' … Was I going to say 'Hit me baby one more time'? Hell no!\" TLC would go onto record \"No Scrubs\" and \"Cool\" and \"Unpretty,\" both of which marked the end of their hit-making era.\n\nIt Established Spears' Signature Sound\n\nSpears understood the melodic power of \"... Baby One More Time\" immediately.\n\n\"The whole song is about that stress that we all go through as teens,\" Spears told the Guardian in 2018. \"I knew it was a great song. It was different and I loved it, (but) I don't think you can anticipate how a song is going to be received.\"\n\nMartin was a big part of that. \"I think Max is a genius. It all just came together and felt right. In my opinion Max is the greatest songwriter of all time.\" For their efforts, Rolling Stone later called \"...Baby One More Time\" the greatest debut single of all time.\n\nIt Ushered In A New Pop Era\n\nThe first time Spears heard her song, she just hopped off an airplane. \"It was so weird because we'd just got in the car, I'd just shut the door, and it came on,\" she recalled to Variety. \"It was so overwhelming, I just started screaming. It was really cool, though.\"\n\nIn the fall of 1998, it debuted at No. 17 and hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two consecutive weeks, later spending 32 weeks on the Hot 100 and earned platinum status. Speaking to its influence, the radio programmer Clark Ingraham later told the Guardian, \"We'd been through an alternative cycle in the early to mid-'90s, and something of an R&B cycle after that. Britney was among the first big artists in a pop cycle that began in the late 1990s and continued into the early 2000s.\"\n\nThe Music Video Is Iconic\n\nOne month before the song was released, Spears and director Nigel Dick descended on Venice High School in Los Angeles. Originally conceived as a cartoon, it was Spears who pushed for the now-infamous schoolgirl concept that exploded onto television screens.\n\n\"The beauty of the video on some level is there's nothing fancy about it,\" Dick told Billboard in 2018. \"It's very… ho-hum isn't quite the word, but it's very ordinary on some level, which is, I think, one of the reasons (why) Britney shines is because it's all about Britney.\"\n\nNominated for four MTV Video Music Awards, the channel's \"Total Request Live\" called the video the Most Iconic of All Time.\n\nThe Video Turned Britney Spears Into A Sex Symbol\n\nFor better or worse, Spears's image was solidified with the video, which showed her scantily clad and landed her on magazine covers the world over.\n\nWhen it comes to her schoolgirl look in the video, Dick told Billboard: \"My producer and the executive producer from the label — who are both women — go, 'No, I think that's a really good idea,'\" he says of dressing the young star. \"Music magazines said this artist was conceived by a bunch of dirty old men in a conference room wearing raincoats. Which, in my experience, was not how it occurred at all.\"\n\nIt Earned Spears Her First GRAMMY Nomination\n\nAside from its immense commercial success, \"...Baby One More Time\" helped Spears earn nominations for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 42nd GRAMMY Awards. She'd later win Best Dance Recording for \"Toxic,\" among eight career nominations.\n\n\"...Baby One More Time\" Influenced Future Pop Songstresses\n\nBritney Spears's debut and subsequent success influenced generations of young performers who were inspired by her voice, talent and image, altering an industry in her wake.\n\nContemporaries including Christina Aguilera, later superstars including Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry, and modern names ranging from Dua Lipa to Billie Eilish have all pointed to Spears as major influences. \"I have loved Britney Spears her whole career,\" Lady Gaga wrote in 2021. \"I looked up to her and admired her strength. She empowered so many people, and still does.\"\n\nIt's a stunning legacy, and it all started with a certain, unmistakable keyboard riff. \"Oh, baby baby!\"\n\n5 Ways Lorde's 'Pure Heroine' Helped Pave The Way For The Unconventional Modern Superstar\n\nI was asked to do some sessions with Gwen and my friend Justin Tranter. It was my first session with her but not his, so they had already known each other.\n\nI wasn't entirely sure what I was gonna walk into or what she would feel comfortable talking to me about. And she was just so open and so lovely and vulnerable. She had these journal entries; in the midst of all of these thoughts and feelings she’d written down she had said: “I don't know why I cried, but I think it's because I remembered for the first time since I hated you that I used to love you.” She kept on reading from her journal and I stopped her and said \"No, no, no, that’s a song.\" So we wrote it and it was just beautiful, she was very happy with it.\n\nEvery session is different, every artist is different, everybody writes differently. So sometimes I'm not sure what role I need to take that day. Gwen was very much in control of her narrative and vision, and what she wanted to talk about, so I just followed her footsteps.\n\nI'm not really one for small talk. I think that's why I am still here. I like to get down to the heart of somebody and I know that takes a lot of trust. I'm grateful that I've been able to work with artists that allow the space for vulnerability and for authenticity, and for us to be able to speak openly and honestly about things we're going through.\n\nI don't really have any qualms with walking in a room and being like, \"Okay, but how are you really doing?\" Not the L.A. version of how are you doing. Like no, how are you actually doing?\n\n\"Slumber Party\" feat. Tinashe - Britney Spears (2016)"
