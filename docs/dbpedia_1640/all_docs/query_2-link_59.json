        "text": "Deborah Bone, the inspiration behind Pulp‘s 1995 hit ‘Disco 2000’, has died at the age of 51.\n\nThe mental health worker had been battling multiple myeloma – a type of bone marrow cancer – and, as reported by The Comet, passed away on Tuesday morning (December 30).\n\nBorn in Sheffield, Bone and Pulp’s lead singer Jarvis Cocker were close growing up and their friendship inspired the band’s famous track, which begins with the lyric: “Well we were born within an hour of each other. Our mothers said we could be sister and brother. Your name was Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya.”\n\nBone moved to Letchworth at aged 10 and went on to become a nurse, later setting up the Step2 health service for the Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust in Stevenage. She won various awards for her work in mental health and, just hours after her death, it was announced that she was to receive an MBE in recognition of her services to children and young people as part of the 2015 New Year’s Honours List.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Learning Deborah had been awarded an MBE was a very emotional experience,” her husband Colin told The Comet. “Her first thoughts characteristically were for the other people who helped to make her achievements possible.”\n\n“I shall be so proud to attend the MBE award ceremony on her behalf accompanied by her daughter Pollyanna who is following in her mother’s footsteps working for the NHS and already achieving national recognition.”\n\nWriting for the blog ‘My Myeloma Journey’, which documented her journey after being diagnosed with the illness, Bone revealed that she and Cocker “never did get to meet up by the fountain down the road”. She is survived by her husband Colin, her daughters Pollyanna and Jemima, and her grandson."
