        "text": "Pulp have reunited and played their first live show of the year last week – check out footage of the set below as well as their full setlist.\n\nREAD MORE: Jarvis Cocker teases more Pulp shows and discusses new project ‘Biophobia’: “I used to be scared of nature”\n\nThe Britpop icons took over the AFAS Live in Amsterdam, Netherlands last Friday (May 24) for their first show of the year. Before heading on stage, the sentence “You are about to see the 543rd concert by Pulp” was projected on to the stage’s closed curtains.\n\nJarvis Cocker and co. kicked off the show with ‘I Spy’ before jumping into their 1995 hit ‘Disco 2000’. They dedicated the fourth song of the night, ‘Something Changed’, to their late bassist Steve Mackey, who passed away last year at the age of 56. Other tracks that followed include ‘Pink Gloves’, ‘Weeds’ and ‘Sorted For E’s & Wizz’.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended\n\nThe encore included ‘Like A Friend’, ‘Underwear’, ‘Common People’, ‘Joyriders’ and ‘Glory Days’. Pulp’s last show was on New Years in Edinburgh at the Princes Street Hogmanay concert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPulp’s Setlist on May 24 at the AFAS Live was:\n\n‘I Spy’\n\n‘Disco 2000’\n\n‘Mis-Shapes’\n\n‘Something Changed’ (dedicated to Steve Mackey)\n\n‘Pink Glove’\n\n‘Weeds’\n\n‘Weeds II (The Origin of the Species)’\n\n‘F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E.’\n\n‘Sorted for E’s & Wizz’\n\n‘This Is Hardcore’\n\n‘Do You Remember the First Time?’\n\n‘Babies’\n\n‘Sunrise’\n\n‘Like a Friend’\n\n‘Underwear’\n\n‘Common People’ (preceded by a tease of ‘The Fear’)\n\n‘Joyriders’\n\n‘Glory Days’\n\nThe show was the last scheduled gig of the band’s reunion tour, although drummer Nick Banks revealed to NME that more may come from the band in 2024. “It’s the last scheduled thing we’ve got. Hopefully we’ll have more to announce for next year but I don’t know how much I can say at this moment in time, sorry! It’s classified. I’m looking forward to whatever 2024 may bring.”\n\nThe indie icons have also scheduled numerous summer European festivals, including slots at Primavera Sound, Way Out West, Øya and Flow Festival.\n\nDuring an interview with NME this March, frontman Jarvis Cocker confirmed that the group’s touring plans would extend into 2025. They have since announced their first run of North American dates in over a decade for this autumn.\n\nLast November saw Cocker and co. debut a new song called ‘Background Noise’ at a show in Mexico. It came after they performed an unreleased track titled ‘Hymn Of The North’ in Sheffield.\n\nSpeaking to NME in October, however, Banks downplayed the chances of Pulp releasing a new album soon, and said their reunion gigs were “more about getting the party back”.\n\n“There have certainly been no conversations about new material and to be honest,” he explained. “I’m not sure if any of us have a real appetite for that because you have to put three to five years of your life into it.\n\n“In terms of writing, recording then touring, it would be really difficult. I can’t see it happening myself – we’ve got other things to do.”\n\nBanks also spoke to NME about his 2023 memoir So It Started There: From Punk To Pulp.\n\n“I don’t think that there’d really been an insider’s view of all of the events,” he said. “Every person’s and every band’s story is unique, but I just felt like ours was that little bit more unique so needed to be put down on paper.”\n\nElsewhere, Cocker previously thanked fans for their support after his mother passed away at the beginning of this year."
