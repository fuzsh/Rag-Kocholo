Disco 2000 is a collection of short stories edited by English music journalist Sarah Champion. The book features (mostly) original contributions by various different authors including Pat Cadigan, Grant Morrison, Robert Anton Wilson, and Douglas Coupland.

The book includes Bill Drummond’s short story ‘Let’s Grind (or How K2 Plant Hire Ltd Went To Work)‘. The companion album released alongside the book furthermore features 2K’s Fuck The Millennium.

Despite its name the book is – unsurprisingly – in no way related to the KLF side project of the same name.
