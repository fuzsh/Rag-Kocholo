Universal Pictures has paid seven figures for “Goner,” a fantasy thriller spec script Joss Whedon wrote and will direct. Whedon was cryptic in describing the project, but the title conveys that it will tread on supernatural turf comparable to his series creations “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and the bloodsucker spinoff “Angel.” “It’s the story of a young woman’s journey that involves a great deal of horror and some heroics,” he said. “It’s certainly darker than ‘Serenity,’ and there are a lot of left turns along the way. It is something I had in mind for a while, and it just poured out of me when I finished my film.” Timing isn’t clear, since Whedon is writing to direct “Wonder Woman,” the Warner Bros. film based on the DC Comics heroine. That may take some time, as Whedon started his script from scratch. “I was given license to purely make it my own and yet she is already an iconic Amazon princess,” Whedon said. ” ‘Goner’ has some similarities, but the heroines could not be more different, and the story is a bit more intimate and less complicated than ‘Wonder Woman.’ ”
