Joss Whedon will focus on writing and directing thriller Goners

Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon has pulled out of directing a feature film about Wonder Woman.

"I had a take on the film that nobody liked," he told a fan website, saying he and the film's producer Joel Silver "just saw different movies".

"At the price range this kind of movie hangs in, that's never gonna work," the writer and director added.

Wonder Woman was created by DC Comics and adapted for a hit US TV show starring Lynda Carter in the 1970s.

Though I felt good about what I was coming up with, it was never gonna be a simple slam-dunk

Whedon, who also created the Buffy spin-off Angel and sci-fi TV series Firefly, had been linked to the project since March 2005.

"Everyone knows how long I was taking and what a struggle the script was," he said in a post on the Whedonesque website.

"Though I felt good about what I was coming up with, it was never gonna be a simple slam-dunk."

Whedon denied he ever had a specific actress in mind to play the film role.

Wonder Woman first appeared in comic form in 1941

"I never had an actress picked out, or even a consistent front-runner," he said.

When his involvement in the film was first announced, the 42-year-old described Wonder Woman as "the most iconic female heroine of our time".

Whedon said he would now focus on Goners, a thriller he is writing and directing for Universal Pictures.
