        "text": "The Greatest Sci Fi/Fantasy TV Shows: Considering the case for the sci fi and fantasy television shows that should be counted among the greatest of all time.\n\nWhat Is It?\n\nFive hundred years in the future, humans have expanded across the galaxy and the central governing force known as the Alliance rules over the colonists with a tight grip. A group of former rebels and outlaws try to survive aboard the “Firefly” class ship Serenity by living on the fringes of colonized space and attempting to steer clear of Alliance forces. But when two fugitives seek passage onboard the ship, the crew finds itself once again on the run.\n\nAired: FOX, 2002-03, 1 Season Totaling 14 Episodes\n\nStarring: Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite, Sean Maher, Summer Glau, Ron Glass\n\nCreated By: Joss Whedon\n\nArgument to Count It as One of the Greatest Sci Fi TV Shows:\n\nWhen Firefly hit Prime Time in the Fall of 2002, it was a breath of fresh air for sci fi and fantasy television. While the space western thing had been done before (Cowboy Bebop), and the ragtag crew on the run through the galaxy was not new (Farscape, et al), Firefly offered its own spin that helped it steer clear of the retread route as it charted a whole new course for sci fi TV. This was a fully developed show that had an extensive back story, interesting and well-developed characters, good episodic stories, and also an extended arc full of mystery and intrigue. It also had plenty of witty dialogue and a sense of fun that helped it rise above the by-the-numbers space opera formula (as represented by shows like Andromeda and Starhunter which were airing at the same time in syndication).\n\nBut most important to this show was its cast. Joss Whedon managed to assemble a dream team of actors, and each was perfect for their part. With the exception of Ron Glass and Adam Baldwin, the actors were mostly unknown at the time. But Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk, Morena Baccarin, Jewel Staite, Gina Torres, and Summer Glau have since become iconic names in the genre, most starting with their accomplishments in this show. The cast developed an instant chemistry, and that helped elevate the show so that it stood out as an excellent example of the genre.\n\nFirefly was sadly cancelled too soon by short-sighted decision-making on the part of FOX executives, but it still received a wrap-up with the Serenity movie. It tells a fairly complete story over fourteen episodes and a movie and does not leave the audience hanging, though it does leave them wanting more. It has since lived on in books and comics, but the series itself stands out as a notable accomplishment for sci fi TV and certainly deserves a nod as one of the greatest genre shows of all time. (Read more about the series at this link.)\n\nArgument Against:\n\nNo matter how good you consider the fourteen episodes of the show’s original run to be, the fact is that is all we have from the television series. We don’t know how the show would have progressed if it had received a second season or more. Heroes could count as one of the greatest sci fi TV shows of all time if you judge it by its first season alone, but it had a notable decline in quality starting with the second year and beyond and has mostly dropped out of that conversation. So Firefly is just too short and too incomplete to get ranked among the best of the best in genre television. It had the potential, but we don’t know where it would have gone if it had continued, and network tinkering almost certainly would have come into play since FOX execs simply did not understand the show. In addition, the Serenity movie acts as a rather unsatisfying conclusion, wrapping up a story that Joss Whedon planned to unfold over multiple seasons. Firefly is definitely a good show, and perhaps an important sci fi TV entry, but it was around for too short of a time to truly judge it as one of the best.\n\nJohnny Jay’s Take:\n\nFirefly may have only lasted fourteen episodes in its initial run on television, but it made such a notable impression during its short tenure that it has to count as one of the all-time great sci fi TV shows. It was hampered by poor scheduling and poor promotion on the part of FOX, but it still found a notable audience and built a large fanbase. When the entire series was released on DVD (which was rare for a cancelled show at that time), it set sales records and received the greenlight for a movie continuation. And even though that film was disappointing to many (myself included), it did give the show some resolution. But if FOX execs had been a little more patient with the series, it could have gone on to become the next great sci fi TV franchise. The fact that it has lived on for years in books and comics and that fans still clamor for a return of the show certainly proves that. The cancellation of Firefly may be one of the greatest television injustices of all time because it truncated a truly great show, and its place among the greatest genre shows shouldn’t be denied simply because of its short tenure.\n\nWhere Can You Watch It?\n\nThe entire series has been released on DVD and Blu-ray and you can also purchase it VOD. The show is also currently available for streaming on Hulu. The Serenity movie is available on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4k UHD and you can purchase it VOD.\n\nDo you consider Firefly one of the greatest sci fi TV shows of all time, or did it not stick around long enough to get counted in that class?
