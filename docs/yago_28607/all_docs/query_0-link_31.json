        "text": "Biography\n\nJoss Whedon: Geek King of the Universe\n\nAs the title suggests, this is a portrait of a geek made good. In the world of television, Joss Whedon has, since the days of his genre-busting teen-horror-comedy TV series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003), been regarded with awe by a vocal chorus of devotees. For these enthusiasts, he's a TV god, a creative, innovative and prolific writer, producer and director who has used his estimable talents wisely and well.\n\nAmy Pascale is one of them, an out-and-proud fan who uses the expression \"Whedonverse\" – signifying membership of Joss' world – without a hint of irony. She is also a \"Bronzer\", a member of the online community that formed around Buffy and that took its name from the nightclub where the show's core characters gathered. Her book is dedicated to fellow Bronzers and she credits inspiration drawn from Whedon's work for enabling her to face challenges in her own life.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that her biography is admiring and while it might be a little unfair to label it a hagiography, it comes close. The tone is relentlessly upbeat and the tendency to wax lyrical about Whedon and his accomplishments becomes more pronounced as the book goes on, escalating to a full-blown gush by the time he gets to writing and directing the 2012 blockbuster, The Avengers.\n\nChoosing a subject whose career is in full bloom is clearly an attractive proposition, as there's likely to be interest in their story as well as an in-progress star-is-born tale to tell. But it also creates challenges, particularly when that person has grown into a Hollywood powerhouse whom potential collaborators or employees might be to loathe to cast in a less-than-flattering light. If there are people who have worked with Whedon who have criticisms or complaints, they appear to have no place in this book.\n\nShowbiz biographies extend across a broad spectrum, from gossipy sensation-mongering to respectful, authorised and duly sanitised profiles to more academic treatises that focus on the work and leave private lives out of the picture. This study sits squarely in the respectful category, combining details of personal life and professional development, both rendered with a rosy glow.\n\nThat sheen doesn't, however, prevent the biography from offering insights into the man and his work. Pasquale has done her research, read extensively and interviewed Whedon and his wife, Kai Cole, as well as a host of unanimously positive people who have worked with him on an array of projects.\n\nWhat emerges is a man who loves comic books and musicals – especially Sondheim –- and literature – especially Shakespeare. He's a script doctor of dexterity (Speed, Toy Story), as well as the driving force behind a host of productions, from TV's Buffy, Angel, Firefly and Dollhouse to Serenity, The Cabin in The Woods and the glorious black-and-white adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing on film. The development of these productions is documented in illuminating detail.\n\nAs well, Whedon's distinctive qualities, especially as a writer, are identified: the cracking wit and flair for dialogue; the construction of vibrant screen communities; the frequently female protagonists who triumph over adversity, often with aid of friends who become a surrogate family. He specialises in tales in which characters find strength to conquer their fears and, as early as Buffy, he signalled his intention to mess with convention by casting the pretty blonde girl who was usually a horror-movie victim as his hero.\n\nHe has the capacity to keep a keen eye on the heart of a story while developing its plot and characters and he's built a talented troupe around him. Beyond that, he apparently loves to dance and to cook – and does both very well – and he loved Kai from the first time he clapped eyes on her.\n\nThis celebratory account of Whedon's life and work doesn't ignore the bumps: a frustrating 18 months grappling with a script for Wonder Woman; the still-unproduced movie script Goners, the dismaying treatment by the Fox network of his beloved Firefly. But the emphasis is on resilience and Whedon's capacity for turning an obstacle into an opportunity. \"It was time for Joss to rewrite the rules yet again,\" Pasquale remarks before describing the circumstances that led to the production of Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog, a musical made for online release that exceeded all expectations and won him his first Emmy Award.\n\nWhile there is a nagging impression that Pasquale's portrait lacks grit, it's hard not to like the man who emerges. But the biography would be more satisfying if it didn't read quite so much like a valentine to an idol."
