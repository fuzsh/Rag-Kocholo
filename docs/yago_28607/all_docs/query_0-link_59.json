        "text": "According to Eliza Dushku, she and Joss Whedon are going to team up again for a new film. As you know, they worked together on the TV series Dollhouse. Unfortunately, the show got cancelled due to lack of viewership. Here is what Dushku recently revealed to Hollywoodlife,\n\nI would say that we would [be working on something new very soon]! I think we’re going to work on a kickass feature together that we’ve been thinking about for a few years.\n\nOur friends over at /Film suggest that the possible film they could be working on is a horror movie Whedon has been talking about called Goners.\n\nIt would definitely be awesome if this was the film they were going to start working on. Whedon has described the film as the following:\n\nIt is a fantasy thriller, it is pretty dark and it’s all me. So people will pretty much know what that means if they look at my body of work. But it’s a new universe set in the present day with a new concept for me and a new bunch of characters. It’s been a long time since I got to do that, so that’s really fun.\n\nIt’s the story of a young woman’s journey that involves a great deal of horror and some heroics.\n\nIt would be cool to see this film finally realized, but there's always a chance that the project they have in mind is something completely new, fresh and different.\n\nOnly time will tell what their new film project will be."
