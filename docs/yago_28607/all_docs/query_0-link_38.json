        "text": "Now that Wonder Woman is set to make her first ever live-action feature film appearance in next year's Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, I was wondering (pun not intended) if their had ever been a Wonder Woman film in the works before. And to my surprise, their have actually been a few, one of which was set to be directed by none other than Joss Whedon.\n\nFrom Wikipedia...\n\nIn March 2005, Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures announced that Joss Whedon would write and direct the film adaptation of Wonder Woman.[61] Whedon's salary was reported to be between $2 to $3 million.[62] Since Whedon was directing Serenity at the time, and required time to research Wonder Woman's background, he did not begin the screenplay until late 2005.[63] According to Joel Silver, the script would cover Wonder Woman's origin and include Steve Trevor: \"Trevor crashes on the island and they go back to Man's World.\"[64] Silver wanted to film Wonder Woman in Australia once the script was completed.[65] While Whedon stated in May 2005 that he would not cast Wonder Woman until he finished the script,[66] Charisma Carpenter[67] and Morena Baccarin[68] expressed interest in the role. In 2006, a wide section of media reported that Priyanka Chopra was in talks to portray Wonder Woman in the film adaptation by Joss Whedon.[69]\n\nAfter nearly two years as script-writer, Whedon had not managed to write a finished draft. \"It was in an outline, and not in a draft, and they [studio executives] didn't like it. So I never got to write a draft where I got to work out exactly what I wanted to do.\"[70] In February 2007, Whedon departed from the project, citing script differences with the studio.[71] Whedon reiterated: \"I never had an actress picked out, or even a consistent front-runner. I didn't have time to waste on casting when I was so busy air balling on the script.\" Whedon stated that with the Wonder Woman project left behind, he would focus on making his film Goners.[71]\n\n\"I would go back in a heartbeat if I believed that anybody believed in what I was doing. The lack of enthusiasm was overwhelming.\"\n\n​\n\nSo, what if some things had been different and Whedon had better luck writing the script and got some more support from WB. A Wonder Woman film ends up getting made and released sometime from 2007-2010. For the purpose of the discussion, we'll say it's a stand-alone film with the potential for sequels but not part of any grand DC Cinematic Universe like they're working on now.\n\nWhat do you think the film would actually end up looking like? Who would get cast as Wonder Woman and the other main characters? What are the odds the film is actually a success? How might it impact the superhero/comic book film genre and the idea of superheroines on screen? Also, how would this impact Whedon's work with the MCU?\n\nThoughts? Ideas?\n\n1) Yeah, I know Buffy had her friend Allyson Hannigan/Willow, but Willow saw her lover shot dead (WTF?), only to be replaced by a drip. And while her father simply abandoned Buffy, her much more loyal mother was killed outright, then turned into a zombie\n\none thoroughly disgruntled Amber Benson fan\n\nI felt exactly the same It didn't help that Tara had grown as a character between her introduction and when she got shot, it wasn't like she'd stayed one-note. She'd started out as the shy person in the corner, but by Season 6...OK, she wasn't as powerful as Willow, but she was definitely a stronger character, I liked the maternal dynamic she developed with the others in the group, like with Dawn, and she'd generally become more confident. She wasn't just 'Willow's girlfriend', or even mostly - her character had grown legs. And then Whedon decides 'Ah feck that jazz'...\n\nOK, I'm done now\n\nIn my opinion, one of the really missed opportunities for DC Comics/Warner Brothers was the possibility of doing a Wonder Woman movie in the early 1990's using the continuity that George Pérez created in 1986-1991. And they would have probably found an actress that would have fit the role perfectly: Lucy Lawless, who had the height and physical build to pull off a convincing-looking Wonder Woman in the early 1990's, which may end up butterflying off the Xena: Warrior Princess TV series project.\n\nAt the time she was cast for the part in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Lucy Lawless was a miner and sometime set hand. What happened what that during filming in the town she had been living in, the woman originally cast for the part (Claudia Black, of Farscape fame!) had come down with a bad case of dysentery and had to be airlifted to the hospital. Sam Raimi and company were in dire straits, and Lucy came up and read for the for the newly opened part on a dare. The rest is history.\n\nIn the Early Nineties, if they deemed Lynda Carter too old to reprise the part, the most likely replacement would have been Linda Fiorentino."
