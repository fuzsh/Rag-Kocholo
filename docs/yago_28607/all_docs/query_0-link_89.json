        "text": "It's a huge surprise but a very welcome one for Joss Whedon fans - The creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly is returning to television with a new series. The new show is called Dollhouse and it will reunite Whedon with actress Eliza Dushku, who played the popular character Faith on both Buffy and Angel.\n\nVariety, the Hollywood Reporter and TV Guide are all reporting on the new series, and together establish how it came to be. Dushku had recently signed a talent deal with 20th Century Fox and the FOX network (who will partner on Dollhouse) and she then met with Whedon over lunch to discuss career options. As Whedon tells the Reporter \"In the middle of the conversation I went 'Oh God. I thought of the show and I had the title.'\" After the cancellation of Firefly in 2002 and Angel in 2004 Whedon had seemingly washed his hands of TV, moving back to working on feature films, including a version of Wonder Woman that never came to be and the still in development horror movie Goners. However, Whedon remained a creator/producer who was high in demand for television executives, if he wished to return to that world.\n\nDollhouse will in fact bring Whedon back to television in a full capacity, as he will executive produce the series and serve as showrunner and head writer. Dushku will have a producer credit, and Whedon's frequent collaborator Tim Minear (Angel / Firefly) is also participating in the series. Whedon, Minear and Dushku had once discussed working together on a possible spinoff from Buffy and Angel featuring Dushku's Faith, but that project never happened, with Dushku opting to do the short-lived Tru Calling instead.\n\nSo what's Dollhouse about? The project centers on a woman named Echo (Dushku) who is one of a group of special operatives who work out of a facility called Dollhouse. The catch is that all of these agents, Echo included, have their memories wiped clean after each assignment, living a childlike existence in the time when they're not out in the field. They are then imprinted with new false memories and an appropriate skill sets for each new mission. The show focuses on what happens when Echo begins resisting the constant mind wipes and starts to develop self-awareness. Whedon tells TV Guide \"Dollhouse is a suspense drama about a girl who can have any personality except her own.\" The TV Guide piece describes the show as Alias meets Quantum Leap, because as Whedon explains \"Echo is literally changing who she is. She gets into people's lives a little bit.\"\n\nSome Whedon fans will be shocked (and worried) that Dollhouse is set up at the FOX network, after he had a notorious experience with Firefly there. Whedon has gone on record saying he felt the network never supported that beloved cult series, which was aired out of order and cancelled after only 11 episodes were shown. Describing the experience of meeting with FOX about Dollhouse Whedon says to TV Guide \"Honestly? Walking back into that building was pretty damn strange.\" However he adds that he always had a good relationship with 20th Century Fox, the studio who produced Buffy, Angel and Firefly, and that when it comes to FOX the network \"it's a completely new bunch of people, and from what I've seen, a fairly impressive bunch.\"\n\nDollhouse has an initial seven episode commitment. While some reports say it could potentially air as a mid-season replacement in the late spring, the Variety piece suggests it's more likely to debut next fall. They add that the potential is there for the early production on the first seven episodes to allow for enough lead time to let the show air a full 22 episode season uninterrupted by repeats. Shows that have done this previously, including 24 and Alias, have had to wait until later in the season to begin airing, to allow for enough episodes to be completed so that there can be no breaks."
