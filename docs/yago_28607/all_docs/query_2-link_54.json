        "text": "Ditto. I personally believe they did a massive dis-service by trying to sell this as a “Space Western” … I like the description that Joss Whedon gave it…\n\n“This is the story of the people the Enterprise would have flown right by”\n\nYou will enjoy it GalaxyRanger…trust us. Excellent writing, brilliant acting, beautiful cinematography…it has got it all.\n\nThe whole western meets space concept put me off too, but stick with it, its so worth it and Solai is right, Lo Tech is probably the best way to view it.\n\nOh, I trust you. Y’all have good taste.\n\nI’ll check it out eventually, after my finals…\n\nYou’ll have to excuse my ignorance about Firefly, though, it was never on TV over here - probably never on TV in any non-English speaking country? - and I hadn’t even heard about before I started listening to GWC.\n\nIronic, considering TOS Trek was sold to the network as “Wagon Train in space.”\n\nThe Western angle is both essential and incidental. The way the Firefly universe is set up, the Western thing amounts to realism, basically. You’ll see.\n\nDefinitely. Also consider the timing tho…Wagon Train ran from 1957 to 1965. Star Trek started in 1966, the comparison makes sense especially when there was no language to really describe what they wanted to do. It is funny to imagine Gene Roddenberry’s pitch.\n\n“Ok…so, we have a group of astronauts”\n\n“On a rocket?”\n\n“Yes…but much bigger. It is like the size of a battleship.”\n\n“So it is a war rocket?”\n\n“No, it is just big. Really big. People live on it.”\n\n“And they have to return to Earth after a few days?”\n\n“No, they are explorers. They are going out into the universe, exploring.”\n\n“They don’t need rocket fuel?”\n\n“No, the ship runs on giant crystals. They don’t have to refuel. They are just exploring. Like Columbus.”\n\n“Why? To get gold?”\n\n“No, to increase their knowledge.”\n\n<blank stare>\n\n“Ok, try this: it is Wagon Train in space.”\n\n“Ohhhhhhhh!”\n\ni just loaned my dad the series, he loves it, he got though 11 episodes in 2 days.\n\nSo, I just watched Serenity, the movie, I had totally forgotten that I had a not-so-legal copy of it just lying around here somewhere, unwatched.\n\nGuess what.\n\nI liked it. It’s not Star Trek, but that’s okay. I’m convinced. I’ll watch all the rest too.\n\nYou won’t be disappointed! Well, except for the fact that there isn’t a lot more…\n\nWhich is precisely why I love Firefly so much.\n\nYeah, I can see that. It was hard at first to bear all the visual differences and the no-pastels look\n\nno, I’m really good with Firefly, I can see why everybody likes it so much and I think I will too. Just a quick question: there’s lots of Chinese symbols and writings and from what I understand about the backstory, the US and China were the two main spacefaring nations. Do we get see actual Chinese astronauts or spacefarer or is their scripture all that is left of them?\n\nGreat question. You will encounter Chinese in the 'verse, but not so much in the episodes we were given. There are rumors that this was going to be developed more…but alas.\n\nI hope I didn’t offend you with my comment, but to me, Firefly addresses a lot of the things about the star trek series that have always bothered me. There are no magic like technological fixes to a problem (though apparently some of the science concept in Trek are being realized), and serenity’s crew succeeds in spite of their human nature, not because of it.\n\nAs far as the US and Chinese back-story goes, the two countries merged into one entity, and became the alliance, which is why you see the dual language, and non-Asians with Chinese names and vice versa.\n\nAs far as the regular season goes, the first episodes are all right, but it really gets a lot better after the “Serenity” and “the train job.” I would just say be patient and I think you will really enjoy the series.\n\nNot at all, nothing could ever take away my infatuation with Star Trek. Trek and Firefly seem to be two very different concepts, Trek was never about the magical reset buttons, that was just a device to tell the story.\n\nYeah, I think I will like Firefly, I’m just a bit confused about where to start, the chronological order doesn’t seem to be the one that it first aired in?\n\nThat’s a tough call. I’d suggest starting with the pilot episode “Serenity” to get some of the backstory on the characters.\n\nWatch them in the order on the dvds. DO NOT watch them in the order they were aired. F!x did the show a major disservice by airing them out of order.\n\nWatch all 14 eps.\n\nThen, you’ll want to do the following:\n\nWatch the viral videos, if you can still find them.\n\nRead the unaired script, “Dead or Alive”\n\n(I’m linking it from whedon.info. Since fireflyfans.net got hacked, the alignment is all kinds of whacked out. This copy is cleaner: http://www.whedon.info/article.php3?id_article=8136\n\nGo to stillflyin.net and check out their amazing 2nd season and beyond.\n\nCheck around for Browncoat Recruitment tips. ( I donate copies of the box set to the Maryland library system. )\n\nRoot around some of the oldest Firefly boards:\n\nThe OB - The “Original Board” - http://forums.prospero.com/foxfirefly\n\nFireflyfans.net - http://fireflyfans.net/\n\nSerenitymovie.org - http://www.serenitymovie.org/browncoats/forums/index.php?act=home\n\nSerenitystuff.com http://www.serenitystuff.com/?PHPSESSID=23222f999ad6167dc2dde8a6a9adbe09\n\nWow, that’s a quite a handful of info. Thankx!\n\nI’ll definitely watch them in order on the dvds, thanks a lot, that’s what I wanted to know. Not sure if I’ll like it enough to delve into all that other stuff, but we’ll see. I’ll start with the dvds:-)\n\noh and your avatar is beautiful, is that an actress?\n\nIf you like BSG at all GR, I think you will definitely enjoy Firefly, as it really paved the way for a lot of the stuff BSG does. I think the DVDs are about 20USD now, and you can always record it for free off of SCIFI.\n\nNO.\n\nBuy the box set. Then go buy a box set for your friend.\n\nIt is our best, and possibly only weapon right now to get us more canon.\n\nWhat language do the studios speak? Money. Pure and simple. Fatten their wallets by buying Serenifly, there’s a greater chance for us to get more.\n\n:o My avatar is a stock photo of a redhead. Not anyone famous.\n\nI have to agree with Mavourneen on this one. If you enjoy the Firefly, definitely get the box set. This is useful for a few reasons:\n\nKeeping the sales up helps get us our big damn trilogy\n\nHaving the box set means you can always watch Firefly\n\nHaving the box set means you can lend it to a friend!"
