        "text": "Discussing the short-lived show Firefly is usually one of those things that gets a rise out of the geek community, whether it’s gushing over characters like Mal Reynolds or bemoaning the Fox channel for not giving the show the chance it deserved. As a member of the rare but intriguing Space Western genre, Firefly is bound to get a chorus of approval across multiple geek websites and forums.\n\nBut try as I might, I’m just not a fan.\n\nYes, despite all the hard work that Joss Whedon and Co. put into both the TV show and the movie sequel Serenity, I’ve never really fallen in love with the show. I feel like I should have, given that it features a colorful starship setting, a diverse and memorable cast, and a curious fusion of Old West tropes and Chinese culture (which I find cool, even as a typical gweilo). And who doesn’t love a good bit of space travel in a science fiction story?\n\nHowever, every time (and I mean every time) I watched an episode of Firefly, I either fell asleep halfway through or let my mind wander, even while bar fights and witty banter were raging across the TV screen. I really did want to enjoy the show, but a few things never really clicked with me.\n\nSo here are a few things that never really clicked with me.\n\n1. The pacing\n\nSay what you will about the likes of Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek: The Next Generation, but at least those shows had a certain energy in each episode that kept them entertaining from start to finish. For me, Firefly never becomes quite that interesting until the last 10 minutes, which is a bad sign for the other 80% of the episode. You can tell the show has its own formula; there’s some bit of action fluff at the beginning, then lots of setup and the usual twists and turns in the plot, followed by Mal facing some personal dilemma before the climatic ending and then back to life onboard Serenity as usual.\n\n2. The dialogue\n\nJoss Whedon does some pretty great dialogue, which shows in later projects like The Avengers. However, I was never a fan of the dialogue in Firefly in much the same way I never liked the writing in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It’s all very witty and playful, but it washes over me most of the time. I can usually recall one or two very funny lines by the end of an episode, but that’s about it.\n\n3. Mal and Inara’s relationship\n\nI like the idea of the Alliance being sex-positive enough to see prostitution as not just a legal profession, but a respectable one, too. It makes Inara an intriguing character and a good ally for the Serenity crew. However, though some may enjoy the back-and-forth between her and Mal, I started to find it a little repetitive. Every episode had the same formula: Inara takes on a new client, Mal makes a disparaging remark about her as a Companion, then relies on her for help navigating through Alliance Space, and Inara shows signs of concern for Mal by the end of the episode. Their relationship was probably more heartwarming than I give it credit for, especially since I drifted off while watching.\n\n4. The threat of the Alliance\n\nObviously, Firefly holds true to the Western genre ideal of freedom, so its main antagonist is the faceless, bureaucratic Alliance that threatens to stamp out liberty with a massive fleet of starships and a series of cruel experiments performed on poor kids like River. However, apart from one or two run-ins with Alliance star cruisers and soldiers, the central government never seems that big a deal. Mal and his crew usually face more trouble from the likes of fellow outlaws, hostile locals on the planets they visit, and the spacefaring psychopaths known as the Reavers.\n\nBy all accounts, the Serenity crew are more like villains than the Alliance. They regularly betray employers, provoke fights in bars, and get tangled up with some nasty crime bosses along the way. And except for the general threat of the Alliance’s victory over the Independents that continues to haunt Mal, he has more to fear from the likes of the Reavers and his next employer than a distant government run by punch clock officers.\n\nNow, having said all that, I will admit that I love the idea of Captain Malcolm Reynolds. He’s basically Han Solo if he were cast in the lead role of his own show, that lovable smuggler and outlaw with a heart of gold and a burning hatred of the government. However, Star Wars at least had some balance between its science fiction and Western styles.\n\nFirefly is commendable for taking a new path with the Space Western genre and it deserves all the love it gets from fans both old and new. But it’s just not for me.\n\nIt’s a funny thing. Show me a typical Western like Shane or True Grit, and I’m not interested, but give me an anime with strong Western roots, like Cowboy Bebop or Trigun, and I’m hooked.\n\nI’ve already reviewed the Trigun series, but now I’ve finally watched the standalone movie Trigun: Badlands Rumble.\n\nTwenty years after accidentally helping the infamous bank robber Gasback make his grand escape, Vash the Stampede finds himself swept up with a tide of bounty hunters to Macca City, where it’s rumored that Gasback will strike to pull his biggest heist yet. Vash encounters a mysterious young woman named Amelia, who’s as fast as the gunslinger and has her own score to settle with Gasback. Meanwhile, Nicholas D. Wolfwood is contracted to be the infamous thief’s bodyguard on his way into town, putting him directly at odds with his buddy Vash. Throw in the insurance agents Meryl and Millie, and what you’re left with is a rollicking adventure in a very strange corner of the Wild West.\n\nOne of the traits that first drew me to Trigun was that the English dub had famous voice actor Johnny Yong Bosch playing Vash. He brings that same high-spirited performance to this movie, which made me nostalgic about watching the show. The same goes for Brad Hawkins, who puts on a very cool but heartfelt take on Wolfwood. But the real surprise among the English dub cast for me was Colleen Clinkenbeard (whom you may remember as being the voice for Lt. Hawkeye from Fullmetal Alchemist and Ritsuko from Rebuild of Evangelion). I know her voice by ear and she really plays Amelia well, giving her just enough edge to be tough and just enough sass to be human (check the bar scene halfway through the film for a good example of both qualities).\n\nThe other characters are decent enough. I like that the plot hinges on taking otherwise forgettable bad guys from the beginning and turning them into serious players by the end, whose plot involves escaping Gasback’s revenge. Gasback himself (voiced by the prolific John Swasey) is larger-than-life (literally, towering over the rest of the human-sized cast), although I found some of his philosophical musings about life and “rolling the die” throughout the film to be a bit heavy-handed.\n\nPerhaps I need to take another look at the series itself, but for what it’s worth, the animation in Badlands Rumble really impressed me. Sure, there’s the usual hi-jinx and shoot-outs that Vash gets himself thrown into, but in the quieter moments, the shading of the faces of people talking or shots of objects like Vash’s iconic glasses goes up a notch. It’s like someone inserted a few fine-crafted paintings into a standard anime.\n\nOn the whole, I had a great time watching Badlands Rumble and getting reacquainted with Trigun and the adventures of Vash the Stampede. I recommend this film for anyone looking to get into the Trigun anime, anyone looking for a decent Western with some science fiction elements, or just anyone looking to get into anime.\n\nThe English dub for Trigun: Badlands Rumble is available through FUNimation Entertainment.\n\n—\n\nBibliography: Trigun: Badlands Rumble.
