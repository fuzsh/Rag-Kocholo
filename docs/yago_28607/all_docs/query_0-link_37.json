        "meta_description": "The years since Angel’s end have seen Whedon emerge as one of the most important figures in Hollywood. As his television work diminished, his presence in the film world grew enormously both in terms of blockbusters that are part of some of the most powerful and richest corporations in the world; and as a producer of low budget independent films. The tensions between the would-be geek outsider and the multi-billion-dollar blockbuster powerhouse are rife in this period. I use the Commentary! to Dr. Horrible for an extended assessment of the conflicts between Whedon’s liberal politics and his place at the heart of corporate America, and some of the ways this is manifested in his work. Alongside this, I look at his contribution to comic books, his early pre-Buffy film writing career and its role in this period, the causes and importance of the strike by the Writers’ Guild and how this transformed Whedon’s later career. I also continue the book’s examination of under-developed aspects of television studies with an assessment of the role of the editor in Whedon’s work.",
