        "text": "Universal Pictures has picked up Goner, a fantasy thiller script by Joss Whedon.\n\nThe Buffy creator will direct from his own script, though he is not being forthcoming as to its contents. Variety quotes him as saying: \"It's the story of a young woman's journey that involves a great deal of horror and some heroics.\n\n\"It's certainly darker than Serenity, and there are a lot of left turns along the way. It is something I had in mind for a while, and it just poured out of me when I finished my film.\"\n\nSerenity, the big screen reworking of Whedon's short-lived TV show Firefly, hits cinemas next month."
