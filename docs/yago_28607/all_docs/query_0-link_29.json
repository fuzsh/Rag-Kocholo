        "text": "It's a sad, sad day for fanboys everywhere. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Buffy and Angel creator Joss Whedon has bailed on Warner Bros. Pictures' Wonder Woman feature. \"I had a take on the film that, well, nobody liked,\" he wrote on www.whedonesque.com. \"[The suits and I] just saw different movies.... nonsympatico. It happens all the time.\" Bah! At this rate, when that pic finally gets made, Lauren Graham's gonna be too, er, mature to play the (other) part she was born to play. (Oh, and at least one Today's News reader owes Matt Mitovich an apology.) Next up for Whedon is the thriller Goners, which he's directing for Universal.\n\nIn other comic-book/feature news, WB Pictures has signed Night at the Museum director Shawn Levy to take over its adaptation of The Flash, which is hardly as good as Wonder Woman, but hey, it's something.\n\nMonday's Today's News was written by Ben Katner."
