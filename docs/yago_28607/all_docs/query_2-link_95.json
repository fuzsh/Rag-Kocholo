        "text": "Source: MTV Geek\n\nNow before everyone goes crazy, I have to council that MTV Geek cautions that this is a bit of speculation on their part but they also raise some points that inspire a wee-bit of optimism. The site goes on to report that writer Marc Bernardin has a talent for spotting \"possibilities\" long before they appear on the public radar. Case in point, he was the first person to suggest that Donald Glover should play Spider-Man and look at the media blitz that ensued after that. According to some camps, Glover was very seriously considered for the role and while he ultimately didn't get it, some say that the new Ultimate Spider-Man, Miles Morales is paving the way to make Donald Glover:Spider-Man a reality.\n\nBut that's a totally separate topic of discussion. On Firefly, Bernadin raises some interesting points about the show over on his blog, and I encourage everyone to click here and read them.\n\nFurther fanning the flame of a Firefly Netflix resurrection is actor Nathan Fillion. In response to Bernadin's post, Fillion sent out this tweet to his 1 million+ followers.\n\nAgain, this is just speculation.....for now.\n\nFirefly is an American space western television series created by writer and director Joss Whedon, under his Mutant Enemy Productions label. Whedon served as executive producer, along with Tim Minear.\n\nThe series is set in the year 2517, after the arrival of humans in a new star system, and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of Serenity, a \"Firefly-class\" spaceship. The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity. Whedon pitched the show as \"nine people looking into the blackness of space and seeing nine different things\". The show explores the lives of some people who fought on the losing side of a civil war and others who now make a living on the outskirts of society, as part of the pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system. In addition, it is a future where the only two surviving superpowers, the United States and China, fused to form the central federal government, called the Alliance, resulting in the fusion of the two cultures. According to Whedon's vision, \"nothing will change in the future: technology will advance, but we will still have the same political, moral, and ethical problems as today\".\n\nFirefly premiered in the United States on the Fox network on September 20, 2002. Despite high expectations for the Joss Whedon-led project, by mid-December 2002, Firefly had averaged only 4.7 million viewers per episode and was 98th in Nielsen ratings. It was canceled after eleven of the fourteen produced episodes were aired. Despite the series' relatively short life span, it received strong sales when it was released on DVD and has large fan support campaigns. It won an Emmy in 2003 for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series. The post-airing success of the show led Whedon and Universal Pictures to produce a film based on the series, Serenity. The Firefly franchise expanded from the series and film to other media including comics and a role-playing game."
