        "text": "If there's one thing you can say about Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly and Serenity, it's that he's prepared to give pretty much anything a go. This is, after all, the man who took on the challenge of bringing Wonder Woman to the big screen - a chalice so poisoned that none has so far been able to successfully drink from it. Earlier this week he posted on his blog offering to buy the rights to the Terminator franchise (which are currently up for sale) for $10,000.\n\n\"I am Joss Whedon, the mastermind behind Titan A.E., Parenthood (not the movie) (or the new series) (or the one where 'hood' was capitalized 'cause it was a pun), and myriad other legendary tales,\" wrote Whedon. \"I have heard through the 'grapevine' that the Terminator franchise is for sale, and I am prepared to make a pre-emptive bid RIGHT NOW to wrap this dealio up. This is not a joke, this is not a scam, this is not available on TV. I will write a check TODAY for $10,000, and viola! Terminator off your hands.\"\n\nWhedon went on to suggest a number of options for Terminator in the future, including 'Terminator of the Rings' (\"Yeah, what if he time-travelled TOO far... back to when there was dragons and wizards?\") and a musical version.\n\nThe film-maker later explained that his apparently sardonic post was in fact based on a genuine love for the man versus the machines franchise. \"It's all ridiculous, but it comes from love,\" he told Entertainment Weekly. \"I love The Terminator. That part's totally true. I loved the mythology. I loved the TV show - like, really loved. Not for pretend.\n\n\"But mostly, it's just me being a dumb-ass, because that seems to be what I do best - I'm not even very good at that. So, no, I do not think they're going to call me and say 'Congratulations! We'll have that $10,000 now.\"\n\nWhat's sad is that, all sniggering aside, Whedon is just the kind of visionary film-maker who might be capable of returning Terminator to its dystopian best. The series shares his penchant for strong female characters, and while its sense of humour might be slightly less kooky than Whedon's own, I don't think too many people would deny that the last two outings could have done with a bit more sarcastic wit in amongst all those explosions.\n\nInstead, the studios seem determined to hand these projects to the likes of McG, a talented hack who made Terminator Salvation perfectly watchable action fare which nevertheless ultimately lacked that vital spark of genius. Meanwhile, Whedon seems confined to the small screen right now - his forthcoming \"ultimate\" horror project Cabin in the Woods has been delayed until 2011, while fantasy Goners seems to be on the permanent backburner. What a pity someone can't travel back in time to 2003 and get Whedon, rather than the hapless Jonathan Mostow, to direct Terminator 3.\n\nElsewhere this week, here's another one of those slightly spurious early screening reports that Aint It Cool News seems to pick up on a weekly basis. I'm always curious as to how they vet these things to ensure some studio stooge hasn't written in to pour praise on an utterly unworthy piece of celluloid, but let's hope this one's the real deal. The writer claims to have been present at a test screening of Kick-Ass, Matthew Vaughn's forthcoming adaptation of the Mark Millar comic book about a teenager who decides to become a masked crimefighter without having any discernible actual superpowers.\n\nThe good news, if Aint It Cool's spy is to be believed, is that Christopher \"McLovin\" Mintz-Plasse - yes, he of Superbad fame - is apparently on top form as fellow hero Red Mist, while Nicolas Cage does not completely ruin every scene in which he appears as the mysterious vigilante Big Daddy, something we should all be grateful for.\n\nFurthermore, Chloe Moretz is said to be a revelation as Hit Girl, a sparky 12-year-old superhero who has been trained by Big Daddy to bring down the bad guys. The latter piece of news is particularly pertinent, as Moretz has just been cast in the Lina Leandersson role in the forthcoming Hollywood remake of last year's excellent Swedish horror, Let the Right One In, Let Me In.\n\nI'm pretty hopeful about the prospects for this one. Vaughn has financed the movie via private backers, outside the studio system, making interference unlikely, and it looks like the British film-maker has avoided watering down the comic book's violent overtones to appeal to a wider (younger) audience. Kick-Ass arrives in April next year, so we'll find out more then.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this week's stories? Should someone out there lend Joss Whedon the cash to buy Terminator? And are you getting excited about Kick-Ass? Do drop a comment below and let us know your thoughts."
