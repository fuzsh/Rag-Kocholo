        "text": "The folks over at Entertainment Weekly have posted one seriously bitchin’ article on all things Joss Whedon, providing, among many exclusives, a sneak peak at “Buffy: Season Eight”, which the man is currently writing as a comic book series.\n\nAccording to the report, Season Eight focuses on the worldwide mobilization of slayers and Buffy having to cope with her place in the world. Most of the supporting scoobies will return, but sadly, Whedon remains tight-lipped about the possibility of Angel survivors.\n\nCheck out the full article for more details. Sadly no mention was made of the horror film he’s supposedly been working on, Goners, but there’s still a whole helluva lot of good stuff to help make your Turkey Day that much more tolerable!\n\n– Andrew Kasch\n\nGot news?
