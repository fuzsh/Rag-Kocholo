        "text": "When I was younger, my parents took me to see Star Wars (later titled A New Hope) in theaters back in the month of my birthday- May of 1977.\n\nI was forever sold, as my 6 going on 7 year old mind exploded and I was instantly transported to worlds light years away from my own in galaxies far, far away.\n\nOver the years, I continued to be a fan of Science Fiction and the outer limits it would bring me to.\n\nI was Starborn.\n\nAnyone who knows anything about me knows that I love movies and television. Hell, one of the best jobs I ever had was at Blockbuster Video back in high school.\n\nIt was awesome.\n\nOver the years I’ve developed a deep love for the many genres that it presents as a lover of the cinema and of great television.\n\nDuring that time, many fantasy, horror and adventure stories have been written and transported onto the small screen… and that’s not a bad thing.\n\nSome I liked, some I didn’t. But it was great to be able to watch how shows became mainstream in the new era for services like streaming and digital television.\n\nAnd while it’s true that nobody is ever in the same mood all the time, when we watch TV… good TV can be a challenge to find today, considering the amount of streaming services out there offering a flood of programming options for comedy, drama, action and the world of science fiction entertainment.\n\nIt’s a great time to find good television as the options are plentiful and again…\n\nthat’s not a bad thing.\n\nDeep Space\n\nWhen people hear the words “Science Fiction” or “Sci-Fi”, it’s not entirely uncommon for many to think of the worlds far, far, away like legendary Star Wars and Star Trek or to worlds where cybernetics live among us (like Blade Runner or the Terminator) and classics like Space 1999 and Lost in Space.\n\nBut, over the recent years, television has come light years into the future becoming very much akin to film production in both its quality and production value.\n\nSo while sci-fi is just one of the plethora of flavors of mood you could choose when it comes to an insatiable television appetite, there are also all sorts of flavors on that sci-fi menu that are more than just flashy and shallow.\n\nMany of the best shows incorporate secondary elements into its involved storyline like politics, culture or comedy and deep character development and cinematography that rival some of the best films and offer us more than just 2 to 3 hour long installments in a theater.\n\nTo even heighten the quality level, many of them are backed by big budgets that rival their big brother franchises that are made into films.\n\nThe advantage of a great television show or series over a feature film is that it allows for the story to progress for many installments over the course of a season and continued seasons furthering the ever expanding stories.\n\nOver the course of weeks, months and seasonal years, the most popular and successful shows continue on to great lengths and reception with big fan bases and audience viewership.\n\nBelow, is what I think is some of my favorites and the top of the extensive list of the many more modern offerings in the constant search for the best of Sci-Fi streaming on television and guaranteed to take you on your next journey among the stars.\n\nPlease enjoy the included trailers I have made available as I think they sell the series themselves quite a bit.\n\nStar Wars : Andor\n\nThere are very few franchises, whether films and shows that can measure up to the stories told in the world of Star Wars.\n\nIn fact, over its legendary history, many Star Wars fans consider Rogue One to be one of, if not the best Star Wars movie ever made.\n\nThe Star Wars series Andor, is no exception.\n\nThe series follows thief-turned-rebel spy Cassian Andor during the five years that lead to the events of the two films, a prequel to the film Rogue One (2016), which in turn is a prequel to the original Star Wars film (A New Hope, 1977) and explores how he becomes radicalized against the Galactic Empire and how the wider Rebel Alliance was formed.\n\nDiego Luna reprises his role as the titular protagonist, Cassian Andor from Star Wars: Rogue One and serves as an executive producer in the very cerebral and central Star Wars storyline.\n\nThe series also stars a deep cast including Kyle Soller, Adria Arjona, Stellan Skarsgård, Fiona Shaw, Genevieve O’Reilly, Denise Gough, Faye Marsay, Varada Sethu, and Elizabeth Dulau.\n\nDisney and Lucasfilm announced the series focused on Andor in November 2018, with Luna attached in the first season, which tells a year of Andor’s story when he first becomes a revolutionary, rebel hero in some of the best Star Wars to date.\n\nAndor represents the best of what Star Wars can be going forward also. It is a series that is committed to deep character development and pays meticulous attention to detail while exploring the grey areas of morality.\n\nWriter Tony Gilroy did an amazing job spending a few years of his time on this amazing project, writing a story that doesn’t quite separate GOOD vs EVIL.\n\nHe crafted a story that spends its time within this Grey area, building layers upon layers on both sides of the factions of the Rebellion and Imperial Empire.\n\nCoupled with the fact that the level of sweeping real cinematography outside of the studio constraints on location combined with real time practical effects give rise to its authenticity onscreen.\n\nIn addition to amazing visuals, the music composition for Andor make this top tier Star Wars and Science Fiction in general.\n\nAs of this year, the Andor Season 2 release date has been delayed to 2025 due to production setbacks and Disney’s involvement with other Star Wars projects.\n\nIt was originally scheduled for August 2024 but has been rescheduled until 2025, which in all honesty, can happen not soon enough as I love this series and it’s opening season.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n5/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nThe Mandalorian/Ahsoka and the Book of Boba Fett.\n\n(5 season combination)\n\nYou would be hard pressed to find many that have not heard of Disney Lucasfilm’s Star Wars’ The Mandalorian and Ahsoka series.\n\nIf you have been reading my articles from earlier this year, including the preview of my upcoming book on films, then you will no doubt have known that not only am I a huge fan of Star Wars, but also of The Mandalorian and Ahsoka specifically.\n\nIn fact, I wrote a series of articles on the Ahsoka series and I implore you to read them right here on Medium in my Ahsoka: Path of Light series.\n\nThe Star Wars universe is very complex … in fact, it is governed by canon (a collection or list of sacred facts accepted as true and genuine) it’s wide concepts have always been in the spotlight of both controversy and subjective opinion.\n\nSo when, more modern shows expand or intend to retcon certain narratives from earlier works, sometimes the world of Star Wars can be downright sticky.\n\nFortunately, in both series’ The Mandalorian and Ahsoka, the dynamic duo of Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau have done everything in their power to preserve the sacred lore and canon of Star Wars while expanding its storyline with a fantastic new story.\n\nShowcasing high level Star Wars and featuring Pedro Pascal as Mando, The Mandalorian is a Disney+ space Western series about a lone bounty hunter who protects a Force-sensitive child, Grogu, from Imperial forces.\n\nThe series takes place five years after the events of Star Wars Return of the Jedi (1983) and before the emergence of the First Order in the latter films.\n\nThe Mandalorian has been a historical success for the Star Wars franchise and Disney+.\n\nIn 2023, it was the most streamed original series, surpassing other popular shows like Ted Lasso and The Witcher. It has also been nominated for some 50 Emmy Awards and won 14 in total.\n\nSome say the show’s success is due to its unique approach to the franchise, which has reignited interest and proved that it’s more than just Jedi and the Skywalker saga. Others say it’s due to its focus on flexibility, emotion, and adventure over lore.\n\nI think it’s a combination of both and offers some great Star Wars content and adventure unlike anything we’ve seen before.\n\nAlike, Ahsoka continues the back story and crossover to The Mandalorian series of Ahsoka Tano, a Togruta female who was the Padawan learner to Anakin Skywalker and a hero of the Clone Wars.\n\nAlongside Anakin, she grew from headstrong student into a mature leader. But her destiny laid along a different path than the Jedi and left the order. Ahsoka continues her journey and return to the Path of Light as Dark Forces arise and threaten the newly formed Republic.\n\nAlthough it’s pure fan service in many respects, it’s an absolute exceptional series with a deeper story that Star Wars fans have been waiting for a long time to finally see.\n\nIn addition it is the continuation of the long awaited and celebrated Timothy Zahn (Heir to the Empire and Thrawn) Star Wars novels onscreen.\n\nBut you don’t have to even be a life long Star Wars fan to really appreciate these shows as the story and characters carry a well directed and engaging narrative across the entire series.\n\nThey can really stand on their own but do overall expand on storylines and really give fans their fill of more Star Wars, which in my opinion is always good.\n\nAdditionally, the full series The Book of Boba Fett offers the return of characters that first appeared in The Mandalorian and the Star Wars films.\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett provides a really great seven-episode, one-season, Star Wars miniseries side story that premiered on Disney+ on December 29, 2021.\n\nIt is more or less Mando 2.0 and a spin-off of The Mandalorian and integrated part of the Star Wars franchise.\n\nWhile the series reception was mixed among fans and viewers, the series showcases one of the most beloved characters in all of Star Wars, Boba Fett portrayed by the incredible Temuera Morrison.\n\nThe series follows bounty hunter Boba Fett and his partner Fennec Shand as they attempt to rebuild Jabba the Hutt’s criminal empire on Tatooine after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983) and the second season of The Mandalorian.\n\nIt’s not long as far as series goes but offer a really solid set of seven episodes detailing some back story and expansion on The Mandalorian.\n\nAhsoka Season 2 is in development with creator Dave Filoni, Lucasfilm has confirmed. The news came with the reveal of the new “Star Wars” film “The Mandalorian & Grogu,” directed by Jon Favreau also in development as well as Season 4 of The Mandalorian.\n\nSeason 1 of Ahsoka is streaming now as well as the 3 seasons of The Mandalorian and the extension series The Book of Boba Fett on Disney+ in addition to their complete lineup of feature films.\n\nStarring Pedro Pascal, Rosario Dawson, Natasha Liu Bordizzo, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ray Stevenson, Ivanna Sakhno, Diana Lee Inosanto, David Tennant, Eman Esfandi, Genevieve O’Reilly, Hayden Christensen, Ariana Greenblatt, Lars Mikkelsen, Temuera Morrison and Anthony Daniels\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n5/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nResident Alien (3 seasons)\n\nWhat do you get when you combine a great Sci-Fi drama with interesting characters spiced with the perfect balance of comedy?\n\nYou get the phenomenal series, Resident Alien.\n\nI’d give this 10 stars if I could. I love this show!\n\nAlan Tudyk is amazing in the lead role and the supporting cast members give funny and charming performances.\n\nI think they did a really outstanding job at portraying how an alien would behave, view things and adapt as they came to Earth and tried to fit in and become more human.\n\nOver the course of its run (currently in Season 3 as we speak) Season 1 of Resident Alien had 12.7 million views on Netflix, ranking 9th on the Global Top 10.\n\nBy Season 2, the premiere was Syfy’s second-most-watched telecast since 2013 and the series finished again in the Top 4 of the Global Top 10.\n\nSeason 3, currently running as of this writing had some 700,000 live viewers on average for Syfy, making it the highest viewed series this year.\n\nEvery episode has laugh out loud moments and so many great one-liners from its charismatic and quirky characters.\n\nTo give you a brief overview, without spoiling anything, because this series is just too good to even think about that… Resident Alien is about an alien who had an interstellar solo mission to initiate a destruction of Earth.\n\nAs it turns out, he ends up crash landing in rural Colorado and becomes stranded. With no real discernible way to leave or carry out his mission, he has to adopt a human form using a genetic cloak and he ends up becoming a small-town doctor as a result.\n\nHarry as he is known, is torn between completing his mission to kill all humans and increasingly discovering feelings for humanity as he adapts and becomes more and more human as the show progresses.\n\nThe creator of the show was one of the main writers of Family Guy, Chris Sheridan, so be prepared for a ton of quick wit exchanges and unexpected twists.\n\nOne of my favorite themes, throughout the series first 2 seasons that never fails to make me laugh is Harry’s complete distain for children and constant addiction to pizza and pies.\n\nThe make up design is top notch and features an all star cast starring Alan Tudyk, Sara Tomko, Corey Reynolds, Alice Wetterlund, Levi Fiehler, Judah Prehn and Elizabeth Bowen.\n\nIf you like sci-fi and sitcoms, this is the perfect combination for you. Seasons 1 and 2 are on Netflix and Season 3, just started on the SyFy channel and on Peacock.\n\nTell them Big Black sent ya.\n\nHighly recommended\n\n5/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nFirefly and Serenity\n\n(1 Season/1 Film combination)\n\nTake my love, take my land, Take me where I cannot stand.\n\nI don’t care, I’m still free\n\nYou can’t take the sky from me…\n\nI love Firefly and Serenity. It’s one of my most favorite show/films ever made.\n\nI could talk about it forever and have re-watched both the show and its series conclusion film, so many times, I’ve simply lost count.\n\nI was beyond bummed when they cancelled Firefly after one season and I’m still pissed with Fox about that.\n\nOf course, I am also a huge fan of Nathan Fillion and more or less, Joss Whedon.\n\nI love the writing and the mythology Joss creates in this show and it was lightning in a bottle as his characters are so well fleshed out, deep and interesting.\n\nJoss Whedon’s cult TV show Firefly aired in 2002, and then… boom… it was suddenly gone.\n\nYou see, it only aired for a single season before it was cut from TV.\n\nWay before anyone had a chance to truly appreciate it.\n\nIt had a smallish but loyal audience, which continues to grow thanks to Netflix and has over the years become a cult classic in the realm of Sci-Fi done right.\n\nJoss even did a follow-up movie called Serenity, to tie up loose ends and the film served as a decent ending to an otherwise phenomenal show that could have been a multi season success.\n\nSo the thing is…should you watch it after all these years?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIt’s a great show, and one that I’d recommend to anyone whether you’re a sci-fi nerd or not.\n\nFirefly has that great epic Space Western feel to it and has a cool ass Firefly class Starship named Serenity.\n\nThe story of Firefly tells of off world adventures and terraformed new planets to suit humanity’s needs giving a whole different meaning to a New Frontier.\n\nThe show is gritty, dirty, and downright bloody … it’s got great dialogue between the characters and phenomenal practical and special effects… it’s got swearing in a Chinese integrated language and the perfect balance of comedy.\n\nI absolutely love it.\n\nIt tells the story of Malcolm (Mal) Reynolds, who is the blunt and brutally honest captain of the Starship Serenity … oh yeah and one more thing… he’s a thief , well— sort of.\n\nMalcom (Nathan Fillion) would rather be doing honest jobs, but if it comes between him taking the high road and him being able to survive and take care of his crew at the end of the day… we’ll just say that Mal, will do what he has to in order to survive.\n\nPlus, his team is somewhat mercenary and does the jobs that no one outside the law, really wants to do.\n\nWith that going the crew, as Captain, Mal actually has a good conscience in him.\n\nIf he thinks the job is explicitly wrong or malicious he won’t do it and he might even find a way to stop it in the process.\n\nThis is where the fun begins in most of the episodes — along with the fact that the people who crew the Serenity are actually the bad guys.\n\nThey’re ducking from the government. They’re thieves. They kill people. They take bounty and conduct heists… But, in reality, they’re also the good guys because you see the government in this show is corrupt.\n\nWith this Robin Hood mentality and in possession of a woman with supernatural powers and abilities they are in a position to save lives when they can and right some wrongs.\n\nThe lines between right and wrong are easily blurred out in Deep Space but with Mal Reynolds and crew… it makes for a fun ride.\n\nWhereas Firefly was a show about Mal and his crew, Serenity was very much a movie about the characters Simon and River that we get to know from the series.\n\nRiver was the driving force behind the plot in Firefly in a lot of ways.\n\nIt was because of her that the crew had to keep running from the Alliance — more than usual, anyway. But in the movie, River is the plot.\n\nRiver Tam (portrayed by actress Summer Glau) while in the hands of Alliance doctors and scientists, River was secretly experimented on, including surgery that damaged her amygdala.\n\nThe amygdala is a small, almond-shaped structure in the brain that’s part of the limbic system. It’s located in the temporal lobes of the cerebrum, and is made up of several nuclei and cortical fields. The amygdala plays a key role in fear conditioning, aggression, and species-specific defensive behavior. It also helps form and retrieve emotional and fear-related memories.\n\nAs a result, River has some form of telepathy and remote sensory capability, as well as Combat Clairvoyance which make her a perfect companion and weapon against the Government.\n\nAccording to Simon, she’s able to grasp just about any subject as naturally as breathing, due to both her savant learning ability and latent psychic powers which make her well taught after by the law and Government that Mal and crew are trying to avoid.\n\nShe begins to act out, sometimes in dangerous ways, and Simon has to find a way to control her before Mal is forced to kick her off the ship. All this goes down while they have an intelligent and deadly assassin right on their heels.\n\nFirefly/ Serenity is a Journey albeit short one, to take. The series could’ve gone into become a multi seasonal success with spinoff films, but was unfortunately cut way too short by the network to the disservice to millions of fans worldwide of this incredible unique series.\n\nShiny.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n5/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nStar Trek: Picard\n\nWhere do I begin?\n\nWhen Star Trek: The Next Generation was on air back from 1987 to 1994 and the 4 extension films that followed…\n\nI was in my glory.\n\nI grew up watching the classic series with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy as a kid but TnG was the one I really grew up with in my younger years.\n\nOver the course of those many seasons, it was successfully on television, I fell in love with all of the characters and developed a deep love for Star Trek.\n\nEspecially Jean-Luc Picard and his team aboard the Starship Enterprise.\n\nSo when I heard that CBS and Paramount were going to be doing Star Trek: Picard on Paramount+ streaming services, needless to say I couldn’t contain my excitement.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, anyone who was a fan of the Next Generation will absolutely love this series.\n\nI know I did.\n\nIt takes place twenty years after the film, Star Trek: Nemesis, this crew’s last big adventure together, has them all returned, and it finally feel like we get the proper conclusion from the retcon ancient sagas misstep in Data (Brent Spiner) a favorite of mine and his sacrificial and unselfish death to save Jean-Luc.\n\nThe final season is wild, intense, action-packed and still has that special one of a kind sense of wonder that makes Star Trek what it is.\n\nMany reviews say the three season series is a wild success and that re-tooling the series to be a reunion of The Next Generation cast was an obvious Hail Mary play that worked.\n\nDuring this series we get a real deep look in the finale against the infamous Borg and redemption of Picard on his last voyage of one of the best shows ever to be broadcast.\n\nI’d agree, and will say nothing more other than it indeed a love letter to fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation and is the best send off that any fan could ever ask for.\n\nMake it so.\n\nWatch this series. It’s the best Star Trek in over 20 years.\n\nStarring Patrick Stewart, Alison Pill, Isa Briones, Harry Treadaway, Michelle Hurd, Santiago Cabrera, Evan Evagora, Jeri Ryan, Orla Brady, Brent Spiner and Ed Speleers.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n5/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n•CJ"
