        "text": "Buffyverse ruler Joss Whedon whose Firefly flick Serenity hits theaters one week from today has inked a seven-figure deal with Universal to write and direct the fantasy thriller Goner. \"It's the story of a young woman's journey that involves a great deal of horror and some heroics,\" he tells Variety. \"It's certainly darker than Serenity, and there are a lot of left turns along the way. It is something I had in mind for a while, and it just poured out of me when I finished my film.\" Of course, Goner will have to wait until Whedon finishes Warner Bros.' big-screen Wonder Woman flick and (hopefully) gets the ball rolling on that long-rumored Spike TV movie (hint hint, nudge nudge, slap slap)."
