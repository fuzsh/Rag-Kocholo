        "text": "I know the bandwagon raced across the finish line long ago, but I'll jump on anyway: DVD is kind of cool.\n\nA couple factors finally swung this technological laggard into the DVD camp. First, I got a DVD player and the \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" Season Four collection for Christmas. I had been resistant to buying my favorite shows on DVD since I laboriously taped them all on VHS, but I have to admit that the world of writer commentaries and bonus features is quite a magical place.\n\nSecond, \"Firefly,\" the greatest space western ever told, was released on DVD last month. The collection features the 12 episodes from fall 2002, a \"making of\" feature, a profile of the Serenity spaceship, deleted scenes, Alan Tudyk's audition, a gag reel, series creator Joss Whedon singing the theme song\n\nAnd three episodes that were never aired in the United States.\n\nThe best of the three new ones has Captain Malcolm receiving another visit from a con artist introduced earlier in the season. There's also a strong hour featuring the guy who plays Knox on \"Angel\" and an OK episode with \"The O.C.'s\" Melinda Clarke as a noble space prostitute. (I can be objective about \"Firefly\": Two episodes were OK. The other 13 were masterpieces.)\n\nSaving quality TV\n\nOddly, the \"Firefly\" DVDs are a huge deal now because Fox saw the show as such a small deal when it had the opportunity to keep it around a year ago. Even more odd, Whedon is now developing a \"Firefly\" movie for Universal (which bought the rights from Fox), although the studio apparently is taking a look at the DVD sales numbers before giving the official go-ahead.\n\nIn an interview for the DVD, one of \"Firefly's\" crew posited this head-spinning scenario: The TV show was popular enough to warrant the DVD, which might be popular enough to greenlight a movie, which, if successful, could be spun-off into a TV show.\n\nThis scenario isn't as far fetched as it would have been a couple years ago. \"Family Guy,\" canceled after a four-season run on Fox, was the most popular TV DVD of 2003 with 750,000 copies sold. Now Cartoon Network is considering ordering new episodes for early 2005, which would make it the first show in American TV history (not counting remakes) to be canceled, disappear from the airwaves for more than a year and then be resurrected.\n\nWith \"Firefly,\" a TV resurrection is unlikely because it's difficult to re-hire actors and crew who might have signed on with other shows or films in the meantime. In fact, even the notion of a \"Firefly\" movie has a distinct whiff of \"too good to be true.\" For one thing, Universal would have to give Whedon complete control of the film; the reason he got into TV was because writers are never given control of their movie, even when it makes sense.\n\nBut at least we have the \"Firefly\" DVD, which is a prime example of how DVD might save the entire concept of quality TV. Not just literally (the three episodes that we wouldn't have seen otherwise) but also on an intangible level -- the dunderheads that run network television might realize there are more ways to make money off TV shows than through advertising deals with cold medicine, truck and shoe companies based on ratings breakdowns.\n\nThe value of a loyal audience\n\nDVD is showing networks that good TV can be marketed just as effectively as trash TV, but in a different way. Fox is currently hyping \"My Big Fat Obnoxious Fianc\" (a show that I'm not making up, although it does indeed sound like a satirical title invented for a humor column), but science fiction shows haven't enjoyed the same treatment.\n\nFox's tradition of launching and quickly axing sci-fi shows has been well-publicized. Fan response to every one of these cancellations has been straightforward: \"Fox are idiots.\" And while this isn't the deepest analysis, one has to admit that it's nearly impossible to discern what goes through network executives' heads.\n\nSince \"The X-Files\" became a hit in 1993 (more precisely, it debuted in 1993 and became a hit around 1995), almost all of the network's sci-fi shows have aired on Friday nights and drawn nearly identical ratings (about 4 million to 8 million viewers). The ratings are similar because the same 4 million to 8 million people tuned in to all of the shows.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first two seasons of the ABC spy drama \"Alias\" are available on DVD at Target in Baxter. Among the fan-friendly features are commentary tracks, deleted scenes, a feature on stunts and \"making of\" segments on the pilot episode and the Season 2 finale."
