        "text": "Fox Wednesday made official what’s been obvious for weeks: Joss Whedon’s \"Dollhouse\" is done.\n\nThe show’s fate was sealed a few weeks ago when the network pulled the series from its November sweeps schedule.\n\nFox also made public declarations that all 13 episodes from this season would be produced and aired, and made it clear no more episodes were going to be produced.\n\nIn addition, Whedon made it clear to fans that he was writing the show’s season finale as a series-ender.\n\nAnd at a Fox event a few weeks ago, entertainment chief Kevin Reilly, talking to TVMoJoe, acted as if everyone and his mother knew that the series was a goner.\n\nIn other words, \"Dollhouse\" has been dead for weeks. Fox just officially printed the obit today.\n\nA Fox rep said the series will still return for a run of several weeks, starting Dec. 4. It’s unclear when the series’ finale will be broadcast.\n\nThe series finale is currently scheduled to air Jan. 22.\n\nUPDATE: Whedon speaks via the Whedonesque forum.\n\nHmm. Apparently my news is not news.\n\nI don’t have a lot to say. I’m extremely proud of the people I’ve worked with: my star, my staff, my cast, my crew. I feel the show is getting better pretty much every week, and I think you’ll agree in the coming months. I’m grateful that we got to put it on, and then come back and put it on again.\n\nI’m off to pursue internet ventures/binge drinking. Possibly that relaxation thing I’ve read so much about. By the time the last episode airs, you’ll know what my next project is. But for now there’s a lot of work still to be done, and disappointment to bear.\n\nThank you all for your support, your patience, your excellent adverts. See you again. -j."
