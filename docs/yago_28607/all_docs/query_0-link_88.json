        "text": "Did anyone see this??\n\nAccess Hollywood got the chance to talk with a Fox Studios worker in Century City, who revealed that one of the major movie studios is looking to quickly sign Joss Whedon as the director of the Sailor Moon live action movie, now that he is free from the Wonder Woman big screen adaptation. Also, a list of unconfirmed actresses attached to the movie that the studio has already contacted for main roles.\n\nAbout a year ago, rumors said that Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer) was attached to direct the live action version of the popular anime “Sailor Moon” after doing Wonder Woman. Now that Whedon is off the WW project it’s likely that he will take on the Sailor Moon movie right away, or at least that’s what Fox wants.\n\nWhen the Sailor Moon movie was reported last year, Lindsay Lohan and Jennifer Garner were both set to play starring roles, but both now dropped out. This time new casting announcements include; Maggie Grace, Julie Gonzalo, Amber Tamblyn, Alexis Bledel, Danielle Panabaker, A.J. Cook, Rachel Blanchard, Mischa Barton, Deanna Casaluce, Amanda Righetti, Elisa Donovan and Emma Caulfield.\n\nThe plot will be a complete new story based on Naoko Takeuchi’s (Sailor Moon creator) unreleased material. Whedon is also developing a horror movie called “Goner”.\n\nHere is an unconfirmed list of actresses and the characters they are supposed to play:\n\nMischa Barton -----Sailor Moon\n\nAlexis Bledel ----- Sailor Mercury\n\nJulie Gonzalo ----- Sailor Venus\n\nAmber Tamblyn ----Sailor Jupiter\n\nDeanna Casaluce --- Sailor Mars\n\nDanielle Panabaker--- Sailor Neptune\n\nMaggie Grace ----- Sailor Uranus\n\nA.J. Cook, Elisa Donovan, Amanda Righetti, Emma Caulfield and Rachel Blanchard would play the main villains.\n\nI'm crying inside......I mean, I didn't mind the corny-ness of the Japanese live Action one..but I can just imagine this being a whole lot worse....;____; oh god why...I respected Joss with Angel and Buffy..even Firefly from the bits n' pieces I saw..but to do SAILOR MOON? It doesn't even seem in the same ballpark as his work in like genre. I'm afraid of how it would turn out.....~_~"
