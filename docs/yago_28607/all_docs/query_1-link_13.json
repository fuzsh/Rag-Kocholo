        "text": "Quotes • Headscratchers • Playing With • Useful Notes • Analysis • Image Links • Haiku • Laconic\n\nForeshadowing: Your clue to quality literature!\n\n—Berke Breathed, Bloom County\n\nA clue or allusion embedded in the narrative that predicts some later event or revelation. It could be something a character says or does, an event that doesn't make sense until much later, a Meaningful Name, or really anything at all. The foreshadowing may be ominous, or seem perfectly innocent at the time.\n\nA good enough foreshadowing doesn't spoil the surprise, yet seems an obvious clue in retrospect. Genuinely bad foreshadowing either deflates the suspense or is too obfuscated (such as an Ice Cream Koan) to predict anything. It's also equally problematic if used excessively. Foreshadowing may establish something to avoid an Ass Pull. Or it may put a viewer off as introducing a needless supernatural element to the story.\n\nIn literature, foreshadowing is commonly done when a possibility is mentioned, but almost immediately dismissed or disproved. To some readers, they will dismiss the suggested possibility just as the unsuspecting characters do. More experienced readers will immediately call the author's bluff and know what to expect.\n\nDreaming of Things to Come often foreshadows. Chekhov's Gun is often used as a foreshadowing tool. If it makes no sense, it may be Strange Minds Think Alike. If this is done with a work released after the work containing that which it foreshadows (such as the page image), it's a Call Forward.\n\nA specific variant is Futureshadowing, where the shadowing comes after the actual event chronologically but is still seen before it.\n\nWhen there's only a tiny gap between the foreshadowing and the actual foreshadowed event, that's Five Second Foreshadowing.\n\nContrast Plot Point. Compare AND contrast Funny Aneurysm Moment, Hilarious in Hindsight. Contrast Fauxshadow. Production Foreshadowing is this trope's meta version. This Index Will Be Important Later covers foreshadowing tropes. This trope is a good Rewatch Bonus.\n\nNot to be confused with The Shadow Knows, which the picture to the right uses to do this trope.\n\nNaturally, the examples are full of spoilers. Consider yourself warned.\n\nExamples of Foreshadowing include:\n\nAnime & Manga[]\n\nInuyasha: Naraku gives Sango a choice: steal Inuyasha's Infinity+1 Sword for him or he'll kill her brother. He then tries to kill her with it, something he shouldn't be able do since it's protected by an anti-Youkai barrier. Later, we find out that Naraku isn't a Youkai. He's a hanyou, just like Inuyasha: hanyou aren't repelled by the barrier which is why Inuyasha can use it.\n\nAs a result of the same scene, Sango warns Inuyasha's group that if Naraku ever gives her the same choice again, she'll make the same decision again (betray friends to try and save the life of a loved one). In the Final Battle Naraku gives her the same choice (kill Rin to save Miroku's life) and, true to her earlier warning, she does indeed make the same choice again (fortunately, Kagome saves Rin's life just in time).\n\nThe opening narration to Suzumiya Haruhi foreshadows a lot of the upcoming plot, and one fact that is so spoilery that it can't even be mentioned on this page.\n\nAdditionally, both Yuki and Mikuru give Kyon cryptic warnings that, after the fact, seem incredibly obvious.\n\nAnother thing for something that has happened in the anime as of the second season episode one: Haruhi asking Kyon \"Have I met you before?\" — She has. Two words about that meeting: Loli Haruhi. Loli Haruhi! (she's kinda cute)\n\nYuki is reading Hyperion when Kyon first walks in. A major plot point of the first two books in that series is a computer intelligence that has started creating Artificial Humans one of which is murderously violent and another that is very helpful and honest and in the second half of the Hyperion Cantos God (okay, Jesus) turns out to be a Genki Girl that drags a helpless boy along on her adventures that potentially threaten the entire world.\n\nIn the fourth episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Shinji watches a B-Movie about some sort of Freak Lab Accident, with the characters lamenting how bad science has gone. And, well...\n\nHe's actually watching a fictionalization of the Second Impact, and the characters are lamenting science's inability to detect the deadly meteor before it struck. The irony being that there was no meteor to detect, Second Impact was a man-made event.\n\nLet's not forget Ritsuko's lamenting on the Hedgehogs Dilemna. Some fans connect this with Shinji's choice regarding Instrumentality.\n\nIn the opening sequence, we see many images of characters and plot important words. After showing a picture of Kaworu and Rei, the word 'Angels' appears.\n\nNot to mention a shot of Yui Ikari in profile, followed immediately by a shot of a helmetless EVA-01 in profile. The credits, like the rest of the show, like to mess with your head.\n\nA bit of musical foreshadowing occurs during fight scenes. Note one of the Angel themes is titled \"The Beast\"; compare with whenever EVA-01 goes berserk, the theme is titled \"The Beast II\", referencing how Evangelions are living beings.\n\nAlthough only noticeable in the english translation the Mechas are all called EVA which can be read as Eve who is infamous among the Abrahamic Religions. This hints to the fact that they're all actually the Pilot's Mother in Giant Robot Form.\n\nHappening very early in the anime adaptation of Seirei no Moribito, some kids are singing \"The Nahji Song/Song of the Nahji\", which represents events that happened in the past, and those to come.\n\nMisuzu's fate in AIR gets foreshadowed a lot by Yukito's remarks. The viewer then gets fed false hope when things seem to be alright after the \"last dream\", but it all ends pretty much as predicted.\n\nMadame Christmas of Fullmetal Alchemist seems like a strange name when you remember that Christmas or Christianity are not in the manga version of FMA. Of course it makes perfect sense when it's just a nickname based off her real name of Chris Mustang, who is Roy's foster mother. That explains how he became such an amazing flirt.\n\nFullmetal Alchemist does this quite often, usually with things said in passing by the homonculi. \"Human Sacrifices\" indeed...\n\nIn episode 11 of Brotherhood, a wanted poster with Greed on it appears near the end. Guess who appears two episodes later.\n\nThere's a particularly chilling example in the most recent arc. In Chapter 94, Hawkeye gets a minor scratch on her neck during a fight with Envy. Then in Chapter 100 she is mortally injured in the same place.\n\nRemember Lust's curse to Mustang as he killed her? I long for the day your eyes are twisted in agony. Well... Mustang ends up blinded.\n\nIn his fight with Lan Fan, Ed uses a decoy (in the form of his detached right arm) to defeat her and references getting the idea from animals who are trapped sacrificing a limb. Later on, Lan Fan is hunted by Wrath and forced to chop off her arm.\n\nLing and Greed are the only two characters to go around without shirts. Minor foreshadowing? Maybe.\n\nA better example of foreshadowing for Ling's fate occurs soon after his introduction: Ling is seeking immortality and is interested in Al's soul being attached to armor. Guess who else shared these same traits and was killed off in the chapter right before.\n\nThere's also the part where both of them hate people fucking with their henchmen. Really, they were tailor made for one another.\n\nWhen Ling sees Ed perform alchemy without a circle, it looks to him as though Ed is praying to God. Later, we find out that Amestrian alchemy is powered by a Satan-like Homunculus who actually absorbs God, only to eventually lose control at the apex of his power and receives a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown sans alchemy courtesy of, um…\n\nSome people, really, such audacious thoughts... Guess what Father is planning to do.\n\nThe first anime had major foreshadowing for the manga. . Example 1: Mustang's defeat of Pride in the final episode has a lot in common with his defeat of Lust in the manga (both homunculi impale him with their respective weapons during the battle, and both are ultimately killed by Mustang burning them with his bare hands until their regenerative abilities are exhausted. Example 2: At the end of the anime, Mustang loses an eye. Guess what? In the manga he goes completely BLIND. Example 3: Riza Hawkeye emotionally shoots Archer to death after thinking Roy is dead. She does the same in the manga to Lust but it doesn't work in the latter case. Heck, even tiny things as Ed's Conqueror of Shamballa hairstyle looking eerily similar to his hairstyle in the manga's final arc and the stealth crowd appearance by Ling foreshadow the manga's events in various ways.\n\nGo watch any ,or all, of the openings to FMA Brotherhood. One would notice that they all have a close up of either Roy's face and eyes. In some he looks directly at us. That coudn't mean anything right?\n\nPrincess Mononoke: After San is temporarily incapacitated during a fight, Lady Eboshi warns her men that she's still dangerous with the words, \"If you cut off a wolf's head, it can still bite.\" Now try to guess what rips Eboshi's arm clean off late in the movie.\n\nAlso, while fighting Ashitaka, Eboshi declares, \"Why don't I just cut the damn thing off?\" in regards to his cursed arm.\n\nIn episode eight of Digimon Adventure, the group stays at an abandoned mansion. While there, TK notices a picture of an angel, and explains to Patamon that it's a benevolent guardian, comparing it to the digimon themselves. At the end of that story arc, Patamon digivolves into Angemon and gives his life to protect TK.\n\nYou'd surely never see it coming: at the beginning of Read or Die the OAV, Yomiko wakes up and hums Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\"; later on, it's revealed that the true threat is Clone Beethoven and his Suicide Symphony.\n\nAlso, when Joker first fills Yomiko in on the robbery of the DNA of famous people, a list of the individuals whose DNA was stolen is shown behind him. The name on the bottom of the list? Mata Hari.\n\nOne Piece is the king of this trope. Author Oda often drops thing that foreshadow events years and/or hundreds of chapters in advance.\n\nLuffy stating that even though it is shortening his lifespan, he wants to use 2nd Gear to protect 'what is in front of him now'. It's a noble sentiment, but it wound up foreshadowing the Wham! Episode when he uses it, but still fails to protect his True Companions from getting poofed by Kuma.\n\nUsopp's lies often turn out to be foreshadowing as well.\n\nDuring the Alabasta arc, Sanji makes frequent references to and jokes about 'okama' (Japanese equivalent of 'drag queen'). Later, he ends up on an island of gay men. Who all really, really like him.\n\nThe Amazon Lily arc seems to be a payoff to earlier foreshadowing. Between them, Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold use via Ambition (or Haki, if you prefer) abilities remarkably similar to Skypeia's Mantra, CP9's Life Return, Garp's ability to physically harm Luffy despite his rubber body, suggesting all of these are forms of Ambition which the previously seen users may or may not have known about.\n\nIn the Jaya arc, Buggy the Clown's crew contemplate taking an ideal chance to kill Portgas D. Ace when he falls asleep on their ship. Buggy warns them against it because the one thing Ace's captain Whitebeard will not tolerate is the death of his crew. The Impel Down and Marineford arcs center on the Marines preparing to publicly execute Ace, even though it will certainly mean war with Whitebeard.\n\nIn 2006, there was an anime special, where the Straw Hats were mythical animals. Luffy was a dragon. Guess who turned out to be his father? The revolutionary Dragon, the world's most wanted man.\n\nRelated to that revelation, way, way back in Chapter 5, Zoro asks Luffy if he's the offspring of the devil. Four hundred and twenty-seven(!) chapters later, we find out that Luffy is the son of Dragon, who the World Government considers to be the \"The Worst Criminal in the World.\"\n\nWhen Nami first joined the crew in the Buggy Arc, she said that she'd only join for the time being, and that she would eventually leave the crew. I doubt anyone remembered this when she actually did leave the crew at the end of the Baratie Arc.\n\nThat pirate in Shank's and Buggy's flashback in the first few chapters from when they were cabin boys? It turns out that he's Silvers Rayleigh, the former first mate of Gold Roger.\n\nOda reportedly insisted that he not be named captain when the flashback was animated, only revealing the reason why almost a decade after the fact.\n\nIn the Impel Down Arc, Blackbeard alludes that he's soon going to \"make a show that will shake the world to it's core\", he means this both literally and figuratively as he somehow steals (something that is noted to be usually impossible) the Gura Gura no Mi at Marineford.\n\nThat ocean was \"Paradise\"...\n\nBack in Loguetown when Luffy was about to be executed by Buggy, a lightning bolt strikes the platform, frying Buggy and leaving Luffy miraculously unscathed. In the Skypiea arc, we find out that Luffy, as a rubber man, has immunity towards lightning and specifically towards Enel's powers.\n\nAt the end of the Enies Lobby arc, Kokoro mentions to get to Fishman Island the Straw Hats will have to pass through a sketch of sea that is haunted where there were reports of haunted ships. Luffy immediately asks if they will get to see skeletons that move. Which does come true when the crew meets future crewmate Brook, a living skeleton.\n\nEven before then, Luffy has been adamant for getting a musician as a crewmate and repeats this desire several times. It comes true when Brook joins.\n\nEarlier on, Nami is shown to have an exceptional weather sense and when comes her Alabasta fight, the weapon that she asked Usopp to make for her has to do with weather control.\n\nBefore arriving to Water 7, Luffy draws what he wants his future shipwright to look like. It happens to resemble Franky, from the blue hair to his big arms to his rather tall height.\n\nIn the first chapter of One Piece, Shanks scares away a sea monster with just a glare and later on, he knocked out several crew members of Whitebeard's crew. In Skypiea, Satori and Aisa were also shown to have an ability to sense other people's presence and even predict their moves. When fighting Duval, Luffy manages to stop Duval's bull, much to his and everyone else's confusion. This ability would be revealed to Haki, which wasn't expanded upon until Luffy arrived on Amazon Lily and later trained with Silvers Rayleigh.\n\nWhen Luffy's reunion with his brother Ace finally ends in Alabasta, and he leaves, he says he'll meet Luffy again \"at the summit\" (meaning when he's a top-level pirate, he'll see him again). When Luffy next sees Ace, it takes place at the \"Paramount War\" in Marineford with the Whitebeard Pirates and their allies fighting the Marines and the Seven Warlords of the Sea to save Ace's life.\n\nShanks meets up with Whitebeard to warn him of the potential threat of \"Blackbeard\" Marshall D. Teach and asks him to call Portgas D. Ace back, saying he isn't ready to face him. Whitebeard's refusal not only leads into the greatest war the world had experienced in recent history but led to his and Ace's deaths, and Teach even taking over his old territories and Four Emperor status.\n\nGundam Seed does this with incredible subtlety. It's pretty much seen in the first ending sequence, which is essentially a wide shot of all the important characters, namely the crew of the Archangel, the 4 ZAFT pilots, and Lacus Clyne. However, there is ONE important character missing. Mwu La Flaga. Lt. Raimus happens to be staring at a soldier's helmet and a dog tag on a cross. The kicker? The ruins of the Strike Gundam in the background. And that's THE FIRST ENDING! This was planned quite well.\n\nRau Le Creuset is missing too.\n\nIn the manga Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Battlefield of Pacifists, Heero teased that Duo came along with him on a mission, because he got into a fight with Hilde. Fastfoward to the Frozen Teardrop novel, Duo and Hilde are divorced.\n\n5 Centimeters Per Second : You know the tune of the background music in the scene where Takaki and Akari part ways when they're 13 after meeting for the first time in years? Sure is pretty, ain't it? It's actually taken from a pop song, which supposedly pretty much everyone in Japan has heard about. It's about a man who persistently longs for his doomed love. If you know what the song is about beforehand, then you probably had a pretty good idea of where the plot of the movie was going.\n\nThere's quite a few moments of foreshadowing in the original Chrono Crusade manga that made it into the anime, only to never have the payoff work out thanks to the Gecko Ending. This includes Chrono's Unstoppable Rage tendencies becoming a major plot point, to Rosette's watch causing her to appear as a ghost to people in the Order later being a key to raising her from the dead.\n\nPrincess Tutu has foreshadowing all over the series, to the point where it'd be pointless to list them all here. They include background characters becoming important later, several details about the fictional fairytale The Prince and the Raven and Fakir's fear of crows/death.\n\nDragonball Z pretty much foreshadows Goku's first transformation to Super Saiyan all throughout Namek.\n\nThere are many, many examples in Dragon Ball. Including:\n\nFrom Goku's first transformation into an Oozaru and him turning to normal after his tail is removed, Oolong asks if \"he's some kind of space alien\". Turns out he's a member of the Saiyan race.\n\nIn the beginning of Z, Raditz when he arrives on Earth makes reference to the Galactic Market which he's a mercenary for. The good guys then have to face off against the head of the organization, Freeza.\n\nPiccolo becoming less evil, and allowing them to pass on. While it shows he is changing into a Noble Demon, it also ominously notes that his life may end soon.\n\nKing Kai noting that if Vegeta was at Krillin's mercy and was killed, it wouldn't \"[destroy] the roots [of evil]\". He was likely referring to Freeza.\n\nNail noting Piccolo as a one of two beings (Kami), and remarked if they united again, he'd be more powerful than Freeza. He did this later and was strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Imperfect Cell.\n\nIgnoring Future Trunks' message, looking back on it, it can even be implied that Bulma and Vegeta may get together, when she offered him a place to stay alongside the Nameks in her home, although at first sight it would be simply her being a decent person as an Earthling would be. She even described a dream she to her then-boyfriend Yamcha about Vegeta being a decent guy to her. Of course this is just a few episodes just before Trunks appears.\n\nExcept the dream was dub-only so it doesn't really count.\n\nKami being reluctant to fuse with Piccolo to observe if the Artificial Humans are really as evil as Trunks claimed they were, and observing a new evil developing (Cell). Turns out with the former he was correct.\n\nGoku noting that Majin Buu is more of a naughty Adult Child than an evil monster, after their fight. He is redeemed after the Enemy Without was destroyed by Goku, and decides to spare his life.\n\nAlso with regards to Buu there is a possibility in one of Fat Buu's comments to Babidi. While dancing around in mockery of Babidi's injuries, he chants \"Never normal, never normal, can't go back, can't go back!\" In later episodes, Buu goes back to \"normal\".\n\nRahXephon owing to it's Jigsaw Puzzle Plot has tons of moments like this, Megumi casually mentioning Haruka's old boyfriend is one.\n\nIn the Sailor Moon manga, Chibi-Usa creates a clay replica of the Holy Grail two chapters before the real thing is introduced. The clay Grail subplot also exists in the anime, but the search for the Holy Grail is made the entire focal plot point of that arc in the anime, so it loses some of its foreshadowing properties. Ironically, Chibi-Usa's decision to give her clay Grail to Hotaru in the manga foreshadows Sailor Moon's decision to give the real grail to Hotaru in the anime.\n\nSay, remember how in the early chapters of Mahou Sensei Negima, there was that Negi is a prince rumour that spread in Negi's class? Guess what's been revealed more than two hundred chapters later?\n\nNot to mention this statue, which also appears in that chapter, is quite closely related to Negi's royal lineage. The mage just so happens to be Negi's direct ancestor, and the first Queen of Ostia.\n\nThere's more. When Asakura first witnesses Negi's magic, she briefly wonders if he might be on a (genderflipped) version of a Magical Girl Queenliness Test, or that he may be a hero of justice or an alien. Negi was actually sent to Mahora as some sort of test, and as the above spoiler shows, he's technically a royalty, so the Magical Girl Queenliness Test thing was partially correct. And then there's Negi's quest to become a hero like his father, fitting the hero of justice one. Lastly, his mother was born on Mars, so he's also technically an alien.\n\nEven earlier, there was this, which is the first time Negi's father is shown. The foreshadowing part is what appears to be the shadow on the right side of his face, which shows up again here, and eventually revealed to be blood (spoilers). It's subtle, but that hint of blood is the earliest hint of the Genre Shift that the series would eventually undergo.\n\nThe same page shows Nekane on the ground behind Negi, which becomes more significant in Volume 8 when we find out that she was petrified and her legs were shattered in Wilhelm's attack.\n\nChapter 74, when Mana and Setsuna are tasked to capture a ghost(Note: Sayo), Mana exclaims that \"she cannot escape her demon eye!\". Guess what is revealed 225 chapters later?.\n\nWhen Yue and Nodoka ask Negi if they could become mages, there's an imagine spot showing what they think it will look like. Some 140 chapters later, it turns out that their imaginations were spot on.\n\nAnd that image spot continues to foreshadow \"more than two hundred chapters later\" (seems to be a theme for Negima) as it may look a bit different, but we finally get to see Nodoka confident and wielding a magical staff.\n\nBack in the \"School Festival\" Arc, Negi questions Chao about why she has an insane technique that drains the body and soul for unbelievable power. Cue the next major story arc where he learns an insane technique that drains body and soul for unbelievable power.\n\nFrom the cover of Volume 3, look at the logo on Negi's shirt. It's the Ala Alba symbol.\n\nChapters 164 and 165 seem like just a humorous interlude, and perhaps the silliest moment is when Makie goes into the confessional only to complain that she can't think of any worries to get off her chest. 133 chapters later, Makie is one of the only ones unaffected by a Lotus Eater Machine, because she's so satisfied with her current life that the real world is her ideal world. Unexpectedly, Chisame is also unaffected, and suffers a Heroic BSOD at the thought of being just like Makie in that aspect.\n\nKu Fei makes a joke about the number of Fate existed back in the day and shudders to think that there may be more. In Chapter 311, guess how many showed up.\n\nAt one point, Negi, Nodoka and Yue head into Library Island looking for Nagi. They are stopped in their search by a dragon, who ends up drooling on Nodoka and Yue, prompting Yue to state will will one day get her revenge on the dragon. Different dragon, but many chapters later, Yue proves her worth during her Laser-Guided Amnesia by her role in taking down a dragon.\n\nIn Martian Successor Nadesico, half of the major plot points for the show are foreshadowed by the Show Within a Show Gekiganger 3, such as Gai Daigoji's death and even predicting the end episode being pretty lackluster.\n\nKannazuki no Miko has lots of foreshadowing, such as quick, very short flash-backs of the priestess ritual seen a few times. The whole first part of Episode 8 heavily hints that Chikane's up to something, and watching the show several times will induce cringing during some seemingly perfectly innocent moments, such as Chikane commenting that she likes the color of Himeko's robes better than her own or even just Nekoko saying she doesn't like to get injections... There's also the fact that on the painting-thing of the Orochi, seen in the very first episode, the eighth head is quite obviously separated from the others and won't be seen at first glance.\n\nAt one point in the Spiral manga, Hiyono starts spouting out Kanone's \"data\" ; he stops her when she's about to say his father's name. Said name is revealed about three books later, said father is central to the plot. ... And the reason Hiyono knows that name is more than the fact she's got insane info-collecting skills. As all Hiyono manages to say is \"Ya\" before Kanone angrily interrupts her, though, it seems like some random pained cry the first time you read it. (And that's how it got \"translated\" in the English publication.)\n\nOburi is hit by a basketball thrown by a little girl near the beginning of Kite, in the process splashing water on the back of his coat. At the end of the series, he walks past the same little girl as she innocently bounces a basketball off of the wall... right before she nonchalantly pulls out a gun and shoots him in almost exactly the same spot.\n\nA minor one in Naruto. In chapter 91, Gaara casually mentions Shukaku is more blood thirsty during the full moon. Over 350 chapters later, it is revealed the body of the creature the Shukaku was born from is sealed in the moon.\n\nOn the title page of chapter 24, Sasuke is standing in a badass pose with snakes surrounding him. Guess who he ends up working for later on?\n\n[1] I Take Your Snakes And Raise You A Bird.\n\nA really realllyyy long-in-the-coming, when Itachi confronts Sasuke after the Uchiha Massacare he tells him to read the tablet below the naka shrine in the Uchiha household. Sasuke does as told, but his eyes are always blackened out when he does so. Some 300 chapters later we find out that the tablet was created by the Sage of The Six Paths himself and can only be read (partially) by the Sharingan and more fully by the Mangekyou Sharingan and Rinnegan. The foreshadowing? Sasuke actually unlocked his Sharingan for the first time during the aftermentioend confrontation with Itachi, but he also saw Itachi cry shortly after that and could not cope or understand that, and so he repressed the memory along with his knowledge of activating the Sharingan.\n\nDuring Kakashi's bell test early in the series, Kakashi places a kunai on Sasuke's neck and tells Sakura, \"Kill Naruto or else Sasuke is going to die\". Hundreds of chapters later the same scenario is played out again in the back story of a major villian (except that this time it was for real).\n\nItachi's parting words to Sasuke: \"When you have the same eyes as I, come to me.\" Originally he was talking about Sasuke acquiring the Mangekyou Sharingan, but now Sasuke has literally Itachi's eyes and he runs into him.\n\nThere's about a million examples in Revolutionary Girl Utena, but one in particular happens during the Freaky Friday Flip episode. Utena makes an off-hand remark about how she feels like she's gotten caught up in a bizarre ritual, and that she hopes she can get out before someone is sacrificed. Since it's on this page, it turns out that's exactly what Akio has been using Anthy for, and he's trying to build Utena up to replace her.\n\nWhen Haruko first hits Naota with her guitar in FLCL, she yells \"lunch time!\" and in the final episode what does she do to Naota? She yells lunch time and feeds him to the terminal core. Doubles as a Call Back.\n\nYu-Gi-Oh! GX: Daitoukuji makes mention of Juudai's true power sleeping in season one. Then, Kagemaru insists that he must duel Juudai to gain his power over Duel Spirits and attain eternal youth. It's not just Juudai's power to communicate with them (Manjoume is there as well, after all) but as we find out later, Juudai is the incarnate force that created the universe itself!\n\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann has a bit pretty early, and about halfway through: The first major time is when Kamina says \"Simon, without you, I'll die.\" Guess what happens in episode 7 and 8 where they have separate objectives (Kamina and the rest of the Gurren-dan were to distract the enemy, so Simon could use Lagann to take over the Dai-Gunzan). The second time is in episode 15, when Simon has just killed the Spiral King, Lordgenome. Lordgenome then warns Simon about what will happen when the population reaches a million. Guess what happens in episode 17 (albeit 7 years had passed between episode 15 and 17, so people had forgotten the warning).\n\nDeath Note takes this to the next level. In the first episode, Ryuk tells Light \"When you die, I'll be the one writing your name in a Death Note\". In the last episode, Light survives several gunshots, only to be killed by Ryuk writing his name in the Death Note.\n\nIn the Shaman King anime, in the first episodes Manta tells Yoh he's seen a boy like him, meaning he saw someone who's a Shaman like him. Yoh then says that he doesn't have a twin, joking. Turns out he does have a twin brother, as we find out several episodes later. Not sure if this is foreshadowing though, since his words were more like an accidental guess.\n\nAbsolutely everywhere in Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Why are characters (especially Kyouko) often depicted eating something? What does cooking eggs have to do with the worth of a woman? When you rewatch the episodes after you watch episode 10, you're going to cringe at the Foreshadowing.\n\nI'll take this apple... AND EAT IT!\n\nDuring the girls' first (shown) conversation at Mami's apartment there's an interesting shot where the reflection of Mami's head on the glass table is shown superimposed over her legs, as if it were lying in her lap. Come episode 3.... Later in that same conversation there's another shot where Mami's entire torso is bisected by the glass, letting us know *exactly* how Charlotte eats her meals...\n\nBleach has Shinji's introduction to Ichigo's classroom where he writes his name backwards and admits he's good at it. His first appearance is walking upside down in the sky drinking water as if he was right side up. More than 200 chapters later, we learn his zanpakuto's ability allows him to flip the perception of its targetsso all directions are reversed.\n\nIt's not Bleach's ONLY Foreshadowing. Tite Kubo is good at this. Remember, back at the end of the Soul Society Arc, Jushiro Ukitake quietly gave Ichigo a badge meant to represent Substitute Soul Reapers? Remember how The Mook guarding Kurakara Town never recognised it? This is because, in a Chekhov's Gun lasting FOUR YEARS (just for english readers, going by the official translation — In Japan the gun lasted longer) it is revealed why: Ichigo is the only one to receive one besides the new arc's Big Bad, Ginjo Kugo, the only other Substitute Soul Reaper in the history of the 13 Guard Companies.\n\nIn Tiger and Bunny, there's a curious tendency throughout the series for Barnaby's Troubled Backstory Flashbacks to be a bit inconsistent with each other — such as the same event taking place in different settings, or a person's clothing/appearance changing ever-so-slightly from one flashback to the next. This is one of the first hints that someone's been messing around with his memory.\n\nIn The World Only God Knows, Tsukiyo's doll narrates an omake. Hilarity Ensues until you realize that the doll was controlled by Vulcan all along.\n\nOn a playing card for Tsukiyo, Luna the doll is already standing and holding onto the sofa without any assistance. And on this page, the telescope smacks Keima's head but Tsukiyo and Keima's hands aren't anywhere near it.\n\nTwo from Digimon Savers. When Touma is formally introduced to Masaru's mother and little sister, he's briefly saddened, but develops a sort of crush on them almost at first sight, and approaches spending a day out with them the way some men might plan a marriage proposal. While the episode includes a brief flashback to his own mother, confirming he has issues with her, it's a good twenty episodes before we find out that he also has an Ill Girl little sister that he dotes on. A subtler one is from episode 8: When he reveals that he planted a listening device on Yoshino, assuming that she'd ignore orders to back down from a target she was too close to, Touma adds that \"To deceive your enemies, you first have to deceive your friends.\" Halfway through the series, Touma pretends to betray the group in order to get close to and betray Kurata, who's holding his sister hostage.\n\nIn The Grand Punk Railroad, Isaac and Miria have a conversation about the name of Frankenstein's monster, with Isaac insisting that the monster's name was actually Mary Wolstonecraft Godwin Shelly. When Miria points out that Mary is a girl's name and that the monster was male, Isaac counters that men sometimes have feminine names and there's no telling what sort of name a monster would have. As it turns out, the entire conversation is a nod to the true identity of the Rail Tracer (a monster slowly offing people inside the train), who is revealed to be a male assassin named Claire.\n\nIn Eyeshield 21, Sena's test number for the Deimon test entrance exam was 21.\n\nWay back in the earlier chapters, Agon predicts that Ojou would make it to the top 4 at best. Ojou got 3rd in the Kanto tournament, and 4th overall.\n\nA random member of the Dinosaurs suggested \"they should just aim for 3rd\", which is what Hakushuu ended up getting.\n\nDuring the game against Shinryuuji, Monta catches a ball thrown by a fan without even turning around, foreshadowing his later move \"the Devilbat Backfire\" which wouldn't officially appear until the game against Ojou.\n\nIn Barefoot Gen, one of the Hiroshima locals comment on the weather, saying that it's going to be a hot day.\n\nComic Books[]\n\nElf Quest comics have a lot of foreshadowing. One of the best examples is in the original series. In ElfQuest #2 the Wolfriders are resting up during a grueling desert journey, having managed to find a little water. Cutter, however, wants to do some more exploring, and his friend Skywise reluctantly agrees, complaining that \"you won't sit still 'til you've found us a blasted waterfall\". Several years later (in both real and comic time), in ElfQuest #9, Cutter and Skywise are involved in a literal Cliff Hanger beside — you guessed it — a giant waterfall.\n\nThe retelling of Sleeping Beauty in Castle Waiting features this. The evil witch proclaims to the Opinicus — a griffin-like creature that she was riding — that after today, she'll ride the Devil himself as her steed and he'll thank her for the privilege. It turns out to be exactly correct, but not in the way she meant — her wickedness was worse than the standards the Devil considers acceptable and he disguised himself as the Opinicus on her return trip to personally carry her off to Hell.\n\nWatchmen's Pirate Story.\n\nHeck, all of Watchmen. If we made a complete list it'd be longer than the rest of this page. Just from the first three panels (read here): the blood on the smiley recalls the five-minutes-to-midnight Doomsday Clock that'll appear again, and then there's the red-headed guy being Rorschach.\n\nIn Alpha Flight, Northstar's sexuality was foreshadowed for years — right back to the beginning of the series — before he came out in #106.\n\nA clever one foreshadowed a death in Fantastic Four, where the team are visited by the future Invisible Woman, who mentions that future Reed Richards and Ben Grimm died to get her there, but she doesn't mention Johnny Storm. This is a good way to do so as Johnny died about twenty issues later. Foreshadowing far ahead, but making the death more effective.\n\nThe era of Grant Morrison's Justice League of America started with Midsummer's Nightmare, where a villain gave all of humanity super-powers, leading to chaos and mayhem, in order to prepare them for a nebulous apocalyptic threat. When that threat finally appeared in the form of the \"anti-sun\" Mageddon, the League was only able to beat it by...giving everyone on Earth superpowers.\n\nIn the first proper arc of Morrison's run, the White Martians also mentioned that they'd experimented on humanity in the distant past, with the result that a species who should have been superhuman ended up only human. The anti-Mageddon plan pushed human evolution to the super-race it was destined to become.\n\nAll Fall Down — On his first trip to the moon, Pronto complains about being \"boxed in.\" In issue five, he is in a crate, arriving at the same destination, as AIQ Squared's secret weapon.\n\nFan Fiction[]\n\nThe fact that Aeon Natum Engel is (somehow) darker than the original is probably something to do with the sheer amount of foreshadowing.\n\nKyon mentions his uncle is called Keichii in one early chapter of Kyon: Big Damn Hero. Later on, he ends up in Hinamizawa for Golden Week, staying with said uncle.\n\nHappens in every other scene in Hammered Down. When you get to the climax, it's like everything just decided to go boom.\n\nOccurs twice in the Portal 2 fanfic Test Of Humanity. First is when Wheatley gets stuck in a garbage chute after trying to find a way to get into the lab and save Chell.. He later gets stuck in an exhaust pipe (he's too fat to fit all the way through) causing it to explode). The second time is when Wheatley is overwhelmed with guilt after watching 2001: A Space Odyssey and begins comparing himself to HAL. During the climax G La DOS tortures Wheatley by playing the film but replaces HAL's dialog with Wheatley's evil speeches from the games.\n\nIn the The OC fanfic AVDC, Summer hits on Alex early on in the story. Later in the story she ends up in a relationship with her Non Rival Anna\n\nThe author of the Mega Crossover fancomic Roommates loves to do this, and is actually good in it. If something is in the comic it will be important eventually. Like: Why on earth is the Erlkönig on the monitors of Heaven and Hell together with Jareth and Jadis? They are family. Or This highly literal example.\n\nIn The Tainted Grimoire, there is a lot of these.\n\nThree big examples in Pokémon: Storm Clouds:\n\nWhen exploring the ruins beneath Saffron City, Nightshade comments that Pokemon Tower was thought to have been built by the same civilization. The artifacts in the Tower prove crucial in returning Dan and Missy home.\n\nThe phrase \"pokemon are made of stronger stuff than humans\" is thrown about a great deal in the early chapters. This foreshadows Missy's survival of the apparently-lethal wound inflicted on her at the story's end.\n\nAt one point, Masque responds to Giovanni's directives with a smug \"You cannot control a marionette with only one string.\" This comment, seemingly mere insubordination, actually confirms in a big way that Masque is the real danger and manipulating Giovanni. It even receives a direct Call Back when Masque reveals his true nature.\n\nAnimated Film[]\n\nUsed twice to great effect in The Incredibles. Dash comments that saying \"everyone is special\" is just another way to say that no-one is, which ends up echoed in Syndrome's Motive Rant. A bit later, Edna, while discussing why she doesn't work with capes, mentions a superheroine whose cape was sucked into a jet engine. This ends up being exactly how villain Syndrome dies.\n\nIn Coraline, the Other Father's song when he sang to Coraline.\n\nAlso, the Other Mother referring to the Other Father as \"Pumpkin\". Guess what he really is.\n\nIn Megamind, after creating Titan/Tighten, Megamind holds up a picture of Metroman with the head ripped off, so Titan's/Tighten's head is in place instead. Later on, after Titan/Tighten has revealed that he prefers being evil, he holds up the same Metroman picture, this time with Megamind's head in place. Not only does this hint to who the true hero will be in the film, it also gives a subtle clue as to who it really is when Metroman turns up during the final battle.\n\nIn the final fight shortly after Metroman (Megamind in disguise) says his death was greatly exaggerated, he strikes a grand pose and the tassels on his boots straighten and flare out as if Metroman is even able to flex his tassels. This frightens Tighten who immediately takes off trying to get away. Metroman can't flex his tassels, the tassels were being blown around by the jets as Megamind powered up his flying suit.\n\nNear the end of Toy Story 2, Stinky Pete the Prospector actually threatens Woody and his friends that \"one day, they will all rot away in a dump.\" Guess where the climax of Toy Story 3 takes place!\n\nWhen Lightning McQueen and his pit crew arrive at Tokyo, Japan to meet Miles Axlerod in Cars 2, while they are all talking to Axlerod Sarge is frowning while everyone else is smiling, suggesting that he is thinking that Axlerod is up to no good. Guess who's actually right!\n\nAlso, the line \"But I never leak oil!\" Guess who was with Mater when the tow truck saw a puddle of oil on the carpet!\n\nIn the first film, Big Bad Chick Hicks is assigned with the number 86, which not only references the year Pixar was first established, but also a slang term for being fired. Which is exactly what happened to Chick at the end of the film for deliberately pushing Strip \"The King\" Weathers off the racetrack.\n\nIn Sleeping Beauty, during the scene where Maleficent is yelling at her goons, if you listen very closely when she hits her staff on the ground, it makes the same sound effect as her eventual dragon form's biting sound at the end of the film.\n\nIn Monsters, Inc., this line comes up.\n\nIn Tangled, the song \"Mother Knows Best\" has many clever hints to Gothel's eventual fate.\n\nOne of Gothel's earlier lines was \"I'm not getting any younger down here!\"\n\nAnd also Flynn's \"This is the story of how I died\" in the beginning introduction. Who would take it seriously?\n\nOne of Flynn's first lines is how much he wanted a palace. He's joking, but that's what he gets in the end.\n\nAt the very beginning of the film, the mobile dangling above Rapunzel's crib is decorated with the cutouts shaped like a chameleon, a duck, a horse, and a cupid.\n\nA king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. The sun will set on my time here and will rise with you. The guy who says that has his reign end at sundown, and in the end, his son ascends to the rock in the sunrise.\n\nIn Rango, before reaching the town of Dirt, Rango has a bizarre dream that foreshadows things to happen later in the movie. The dying cactus moving. The rattlesnake tails. The shadow of the hawk flying. The voice of Roadkill asking him \"Where are your friends now, amigo?\" Rango being submerged in water.\n\nWhen the mayor orders his men to call Rattlesnake Jake, they warn him specifically that Rattlesnake Jake is a \"grim reaper\" and \"never leaves town without taking a soul\". He doesn't listen and orders Jake to be contracted anyways. After betraying Rattlesnake Jake, the mayor is dragged out of town by an angry Rattlesnake Jake.\n\nDisney's Aladdin first film. During the song \"One Jump Ahead\", Aladdin and Abu grab a rug, jump out a window and ride the carpet down to the ground. Later on Aladdin rides a magic carpet several times.\n\nIn The Iron Giant, Hogarth shows the titular giant a few comics, like Superman and Atomo, later in the film, we learn the giant can fly, and Atomo bears an incredibly eerie resemblance to the titular robot's combat mode.\n\nPinocchio: \"They never come back... as BOYS.\"\n\nNear the very beginning of Pocahontas, while inside Kekata the Medicine Man's wigwam, Kekata actually tells Chief Powhatan about a dream he had of the settlers from England. As Kekata starts talking about his dream, he waves his staff around over a fire, causing the smoke rising from it to turn into a ghostly pack of wolves, which surround Kocuom. This foreshadows Kocuom being killed by one of the settlers, which is represented by the wolves.\n\nThe smoke wolves then rush towards Powhatan, but are dissipated before they can surround him as they did Kocuom, foreshadowing how Powhatan is also nearly shot by Radcliffe.\n\nIn The Nightmare Before Christmas, whenever Oogie Boogie is talking, an insect will occasionally crawl out of the seams holding together his burlap body and all over him before finally disappearing back inside, annoying him as it does so.\n\nNear the end of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, as Judge Frollo is destroying Quasimodo's model of Paris, at one point he grabs the wooden figure of Esmeralda and throws, knocking down a wooden figure of himself in the process.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the scenes where Esmeralda is kicking, jumping, or performing some other action that would make her dress fly up, which reveals the lacy, tattered hem of a white dress underneath. Guess what color dress she wore at the end of the film!\n\nDuring the song \"Topsy Turvy\", Esmeralda actually performed her infamous pole dance wearing a skimpy red dress, and this led to Frollo's obsession. Red is ironically considered as a sign of bad luck in real life according to Gypsy culture.\n\nDespicable Me: The first scenes show a little child who does a perilous thing trying to get the attention from his oblivious father. Later, we will see the real reason why Gru wants to steal the moon.\n\nNear the beginnning of Atlantis the Lost Empire, while ____ and Whitmore are talking to each other, Whitmore presents several photographs to ____ showing the explorers he will be travelling with to Atlantis. ______'s photograph shows only half his face.\n\nLive-Action Film[]\n\nThe page image is an early teaser poster for Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.\n\nIn the zombie horror film The Rezort, after the zombies escape their confinement, one of them points their finger at Valerie Wilton.\n\nAt the beginning of Enchanted when Giselle is building a mannequin of her true love, of whom she dreamed, the mannequin is wearing Robert's blue jacket from the ball, not Prince Edward's poofy-shouldered maroon outfit.\n\nA veeeeeeeeeery subtle one in Terminator 2 when the T-1000 shows up looking for John. In the first film, dogs were established as being used to spot infiltrators. John's dog Max, barely visible and audible in the background, is going nuts.\n\nIn the Back to The Future trilogy, there are many examples, including:\n\nDuring the opening of part 1, the radio mentions the theft of plutonium by terrorists, the same who show up trying to kill Doc.\n\nGeorge McFly flexes his hand defensively during a confrontation in the unaltered 1985 in Part I, foreshadowing his final fight with Biff in 1955, the opening montage of the film (in Doc Brown's garage) foreshadows later parts of the film, including Doc's hang off the clocktower.\n\nThe DeLorean's ignition troubles once Marty arrives in 1955 during Part I.\n\nThe following exchange at the beginning of part 1:\n\nLorraine says the following to her children at dinner, all of which she ends up doing to \"Calvin Klein\":\n\nIn Part 1 Doc mentions that if he can travel to the future he can see the winner of the next 25 world series. In Part 2 the same kind of future knowledge (thanks to the almanac) is used by Biff to build his fortune through betting.\n\nPart II is filled to brim with foreshadowing for Part III, such as Biff watching A Fistful Of Dollars in Part II foreshadows Marty's boiler plate armor trick, a documentary mentioning \"Mad Dog\" Tannen being Biff's great-grandfather, and a lot more.\n\nA bit of unintentional and subtle foreshadowing: In Part I, the Starliters play a song called \"Night Train\", which wasn't named in the movie, yet whose title foreshadows the use of trains in Part III. (When that Starliters scene was filmed, the sequels weren't even a glimmer in Robert Zemeckis' eye yet.)\n\nWhat's even more hilarious in hindsight, the lyrics of \"Power of Love\" by Huey Lewis (the title song) include the following line: \"Don't need no credit card to ride this train\". It unintentionally spoilered not only the use of trains, but also the fact that the train would be hijacked... used for a science experiment.\n\nThe Final Destination movies revolve on those to warn the characters of how Death plans on dealing with them. Unfortunately (for them), it serves more to the viewers as foreshadowing on what's going to happen soon enough.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: All throughout the films, Will Turner ends up the sole survivor of shipwrecks. The first wreck foreshadows the second, and it's retconned in the sequels into foreshadowing Will's destiny as captain of the Flying Dutchman in the third film, which doesn't pan-out until the bottom of the last act. The second film has several, including Jack arriving in a coffin and later falling into an open grave, foreshadowing his death in the last act. It also had a few for the third, such as Gibbs explaining the natives of Pelegosto thought Jack was a god in human form and intended to release him, just as Barbossa intended to do for Calypso.\n\nBrick: Pay very close attention to Emily's phone call at the beginning of the film.\n\nReservoir Dogs: the very first scene foreshadows Mr Blonde's sociopathic tendencies, as well as the identity of the rat. A later scene drops a clue unintentionally as well, when an orange balloon is shown flying around.\n\nThe initial dialogue also shows Mr. White as the \"protective\" guy (defending the waitresses), as well as foreshadowing his clash of authority with Joe, Mr. Blonde's loyalty to Joe (\"Shoot this piece of shit for me, will ya?\") and Mr. Pink's individualist attitude.\n\nThe friendship between Orange and White is foreshadowed without either saying a word to each other — most of White's shots (especially when he's expounding an opinion) include Orange looking at him and reacting to him.\n\nMr Orange's Conflicting Loyalty (and Nice Guy Eddie's raging reaction) is foreshadowed when he is easily convinced by Pink's tirade.\n\nIn a rare case of foreshadowing that isn't in the first scene, Mr Orange asks his boss to 'take care' of Long Beach Mike, the guy who got Orange into the group. His boss very specifically tells him that Long Beach Mike is a piece of shit who he can't trust. Later, Orange tells his friend White that he's the cop. White (maybe) shoots him in response.\n\nThere's a conversation in the beginning of L.A. Confidential where a police captain asks a younger officer intending to join the detective bureau if he's willing to do certain unethical things to bring a criminal to justice: plant evidence, beat a confession out of a suspect, and shoot a criminal in the back lest he be acquitted. The younger officer claims he won't... but by the end of the film, he's been complicit in all three.\n\nThe Haunting: Nell asks to borrow her sister's car, to which her sister replies: \"How do I know you'll bring back my car in good condition?\" Nell is killed when she crashes the car into a tree.\n\nIn Inception, Fischer says to Saito after the avalanche, \"Couldn't someone dreamed up a goddamn beach?\".Later, Saito dies and goes to limbo which starts on a beach.)\n\nEdgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz are both FULL of foreshadowing (too many examples to fit this wiki). Almost every word and many images appearing in the first 30 minutes are full of foreshadowing and references to the whole plot. The Hot Fuzz DVD even has a function called Fuzz Facts which points out such bits of foreshadowing.\n\nThe Shaun of the Dead DVD, or at least the special edition, has something similar-- the Zomb-O-Meter.\n\nThe quote at the top comes from the Riff Trax commentary on Daredevil where we see a young Matt Murdock standing behind his father, who is wearing a red hood with devil's horns on it, that casts a shadow onto Matt.\n\nThe Andromeda Strain (1971)\n\nWhen Dr. Leavitt first enters Wildfire, she avoids looking at a flashing red light. Later on she looks at a flashing red alarm light and goes into a grand mal seizure, whereupon another character realizes she's epileptic.\n\nSeveral in Mulholland Drive.\n\n\"... and now I'm in this... dreamplace!\"\n\n\"It's strange, calling yourself.\"\n\n\"Come on, it'll be just like in the movies...we'll pretend to be someone else.\"\n\n\"This is the girl\" (albeit this is more of an Ironic Echo)\n\n\"We don't stop here\"\n\n\"You will see me one more time if you do good. You will see me two more times if you do bad.\"\n\nIn The Brothers Lionheart, during the song at the inn, the paintings on the wall depict things that will happen later in the story.\n\nSerenity. River's comment about the Reaver that managed to get aboard the ship after their narrow escape (\"He didn't lie down. They never lie down.\") mirrors Inara's later comment about the victims of Miranda who didn't become Reavers and how they just laid down and died as an unexpected result of the Pax.\n\nThe original King Kong begins with a (made-up) proverb about a beast being placated by a beauty, and how \"from that day forward, it was as one dead\" (said proverb is also quoted in the 2005 film). Later on, Carl Denham tells Jack Driscoll the story of the movie he's making: \"The Beast was a tough guy... He could lick the world. But when he saw Beauty, she got him. He went soft, he forgot his wisdom, and the little fellers licked him.\" Guess how the movie ends.\n\nMidway through Jaws, Hooper warns Brody about fiddling with his scuba tanks, explaining how they could blow up if not handled properly. Quint remarks on this.\n\nThere is also a blink-and-you'll-miss-it bit of foreshadowing along the same lines: watch the illustrations in that picture book on sharks Brody flips through very carefully.\n\nIn Dead Poets Society, the ghost story Neil tells at the first meeting can be interpreted as a cryptic bit of foreshadowing of his own death.\n\nFor that matter his surname, Perry, could be symbolic for \"Perish\".\n\nOne scene halfway through the fully-CGI Monster House has three kids stuck inside the titular Monster House's mouth, and the Smart Girl points out all the similarities to human anatomy, including an uvula. The token fat kid somehow misunderstands and goes \"oh, so it's a girl house\". Turns out he was right — the house was possessed by a giantess who fell to her death in its foundations..\n\nIn The Stepford Wives, a robotic wife starts malfunctioning, and is clearly at a party, where she keeps repeating 'I'll just die if I don't get that recipe!', which is both a hint at what is going to be Joanna's fate and at the horrifying reality of The Stepford Wives system, which has women literally die — and be replaced by placid robot clones for their husbands' desire of a prim and proper hausfrau, who cleans and cooks.\n\nIn X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Stryker says to Wade Wilson that he'd be the perfect soldier if he didn't have such a mouth. Stryker later turns Wade into a mutated super-soldier who literally has no mouth.\n\nIn Gran Torino, Walt reading the paper on his birthday about a sudden life change that will occur that will come to a dramatic, yet seemingly anti-climatic ending. Guess what happens next? Immediately the Hmong girl walks over and invites him to their dinner where he makes new friends and works with a young boy that he comes to mentor. Oh, and the movie ends with him getting anti-climatically shot when everyone was expecting a major shootout.\n\nIn Alien³, there's a \"blink and you might miss it\" moment during the scene just after the xenomorph has attacked, some inflammable liquid caught alight and a large fire has been set off through the passage shaft. They activate the sprinklers to put the fire out, there's a view of the carnage and there's one brief shot of a bucket that was holding the inflammable liquid and was dropped and as the water hits it, the metal expands and snaps. This is how the xenomorph is actually killed at the end, they hit it with molten lead, it survives, they hit it with cold water and the rapid contraction causes it to implode.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz. Bear in mind that this only happens in the movie:\n\nOf course, we can't forget \"Over The Rainbow\". She even makes a reference to the song when she lands in Oz (\"We must be over the rainbow!\").\n\nThis all feeds into the All Just a Dream ending the movie has, since all of this would have been stuck in Dorothy's subconscious. In the books however, Oz is not a dream.\n\nIn The Usual Suspects, Verbal Kint is introduced early on as a short-con operator, which is the only job in the string that seems useless for what they're doing.\n\nAgent Kujan tells Verbal that the way to spot a murderer is to arrest five guys for the same crime and leave them in a cell overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your guy. In the scene with all the suspects in jail for the hijacking, the one lying down is the one who actually did it.\n\nIn the thriller Fatal Attraction, during her second seduction of Michael Douglas's character over the telephone, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) says, in response to him explaining he needs to work and take the dog for a walk, \"Just bring the dog over. I'm great with animals. And I love to cook.\" By the end of the movie, those two things are not mutually exclusive. Just ask that bunny.\n\nNot only that, her overall demeanor starts to give hints as to her obsessive personality--calling him the day after, refusing to take \"no\" for an answer. Not to mention the way she flips out (even before she slashes her wrists) when he gets ready to leave a second time.\n\nThe Mask. Early on Stanley orders his dog Milo to \"Get the keys\" (his car keys which he lost). Later, after Stanley is arrested he tells Milo to \"Get the keys\" again — the keys to his cell.\n\nThere is a cut in Se7en after detectives talk about the case directly to Pitt's character's wife's head. At the end, her head is delivered to Pitt's character.\n\nThere are many foreshadowing moments in The Matrix trilogy, but one prominent one is (which foreshadows at least two significant choices):\n\nBecause of the way it's disguised in plain sight as a throwaway line spoken with annoyance, many viewers and Neo himself miss it when the Merovingian says, with no cryptic language whatsoever, that Neo has had predecessors. This is not only a major reveal in itself but foreshadows other reveals Neo will learn when he meets the Architect forty-five minutes of film-time later.\n\nJames Bond\n\nDiamonds Are Forever.\n\nWhile Bond is in the Whyte House he sees a painting of the owner, Willard Whyte. Later he meets and rescues Willard Whyte and discovers he looks just like his picture.\n\nPlenty O'Toole is thrown out a window and ends up landing in a pool. Later she's killed by Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, who tie her to a weight and throw her into a pool to drown.\n\nWhen Bond first meets Tiffany Case she's wearing a black wig. Later she sees black hair in a pool and thinks it's her wig: it's actually the hair of Plenty O'Toole. Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd thought Plenty was Tiffany wearing the wig.\n\nGoldfinger. Oddjob breaks off a statue's head by throwing his hat at it, and later on breaks Tilly Masterson's neck the same way.\n\nThe Avengers 1998:\n\nWhile in Wonderland Weather Steed and Mrs. Peel see globes filled with weather patterns, including snowfall and a tornado. When Sir August attacks London with his Weather Control Machine it causes heavy snowfall and tornadoes.\n\nSteed says \"I'll stick to swordplay\" just before his big sword fight with Sir August.\n\nIn Equilibrium, the fact that DuPont, the suit-and-tie wearing politician, can keep up with Preston in Gun Kata for far longer than anyone else in the move almost seems like an Ass Pull...except for a scene earlier in the movie where he's shown teaching a class on the technique, which would mean he himself knows it.\n\nIn The Dark Knight Saga the first we see of Bruce Wayne his him tending a wound he recieved from an attack dog. The last shot of Batman in the film is him fleeing from a pack of police dogs.\n\nHarvey Dent: You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n\nEarly on in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Norman Bates, taxidermist and mama's boy extraordinaire, defends his mother to Marion by saying, \"Why, she's as harmless as one of those stuffed birds!\" Guess what we find out at the end of the movie...\n\nTotal Recall\n\n\"Would you like us to integrate some alien stuff? Two-headed monsters? (Kuato) We're doing alien artifacts now (the alien device in the mine).\"\n\nWhen one of the staff members receives Quaid's memory package, he notes that it contains \"blue skies on Mars,\" which is how the film ends.\n\n\"One minute you'll be the saviour of the rebel cause, next you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy!\"\n\nAfter Cohaagen is forced to give the order to kill his friend Quaid (Hauser), he angrily knocks over his aquarium full of goldfish. The fish lie on the floor gasping, the same way Cohaagen, Quaid and Melina do after they're blown out into the Martian surface late in the movie.\n\nIn Avatar, it's practically a drinking game. Observe:\n\nGrace: \"I'd die to get a sample [of the Tree of Souls].\" When she's dying later on they take her to the Tree of Souls, she says \"I should get a sample.\"\n\nGrace:\"What're you gonna do, Ranger Rick? Ya gonna shoot me?\" Quaritch:\"I can do that.\" During their escape, one of Quaritch's shots hits her.\n\nTrudy:\"And I was hoping for some kind of tactical plan that didn't involve martyrdom.\" During the battle between the humans and the Na'vi, she attacks Quaritch's ship directly and ends up being shot and blown up.\n\nNeytiri mentions that there has only been one Toruk Makto and that he brought all the tribes together, which comes back later when Jake becomes the Toruk Makto and brings all the tribes together.\n\nActually there's been 5, all happening in times of great sorrow... her grandfather just happened to be the last one who brought the clans together.\n\nWhen Zartan is introduced in G.I. Joe the Rise of Cobra, he makes some remarks about the American political system based the book he's reading.\n\nStar Wars has a few of these.\n\nIn Attack of the Clones Obi Wan jokingly says to Anakin:\n\nThe scene in The Empire Strikes Back on Dagobah where Luke Skywalker cuts off Darth Vader's head, only to find his own face beneath the mask.\n\nStar Wars: Clone Wars has this as well for Anakin Skywalker, when he is in the cave and has the vision. This also happens again in The Clone Wars when the Son shows Anakin his future, although it is later erased from his memory by the Father.\n\nA few episodes later, Anakin meets and strikes up something of a friendship with Captain Tarkin, who of course will later become Grand Moff Tarkin. When they shake hands at the end of the three-parter, a few notes from the Imperial March play.\n\nThis exchange in A New Hope:\n\nConstantine. Papa Midnite tells Constantine that his soul is the only one Satan himself would come to collect. He's right.\n\nThe final lines of the movie Mommie Dearest, after Christina Crawford and her brother find out that their mother Joan Crawford had disinherited them, suggest that Christina would truly have \"the last word\".\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade\n\nWhen Indiana Jones gets captured by the Nazis after getting betrayed by Dr. Elsa Schneider, she says to him, \"Don't look at me like that. We both wanted the Grail. I would have done anything to get it. You would have done the same.\" To which Indiana replies, \"I'm sorry you think so.\" This minor exchange actually foreshadows the climax of the movie when Elsa tries to leave the temple with the grail. In that scene, Elsa almost falls into a crevice she created when she crossed the seal of the temple, but Indiana catches her. True to her earlier words, Elsa pulls a hand free to reach the grail below her instead of letting Indiana lift her up. Before she can get it, the glove on her other hand pulls off and she ultimately falls to her death. Indiana is then placed in the same situation, only he chooses to \"let it go\" and let his father save him.\n\nDonovan says to Indy that they're only a few steps away from finding the Holy Grail, which prompts Indy to say \"That's usually where the ground falls out from underneath your feet.\" Guess what happens when the Grail is found towards the end.\n\nIn Halloween: H20, Laurie Strode (who now goes by the name Keri Tate) is teaching an English literature class on Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. Molly, one of the students, responds to a question about the book and fate with this: \"I think that Victor should have confronted the monster sooner. He's completely responsible for Elizabeth's death. He was so paralyzed by fear that he never did anything. It took death for the guy to get a clue.\" She goes on to say that Victor finally confronts the monster because he \"had reached a point in his life where he had nothing left to lose. I mean, the monster saw to that by killing off everybody that he loved. It was about redemption. It was his fate.\" This foreshadows the final scenes in the movie where Laurie finally decides to stop running from Michael Myers and confront her monster. After 20 years of living in fear and seeing her loved ones murdered, she had nothing more to lose. It was time to face her fears and end the nightmare.\n\nThroughout the fourth Juon movie, Toshio repeatedly shows himself to be placing his hand on Kyoko's stomach. When one takes the ending into account, it becomes chillingly obvious why.\n\nNot to mention the entire \"Tomoka\" vignette in the same movie. When the reason for the mysterious \"banging\" on her wall every night is revealed, it's downright horrifying.\n\nFrom Thor, Loki's hand after he was touched by a Frost Giant. Also: \"Allfather, you look ... weary.\"\n\nIn the beginning of the film, Odin tells a young Thor and Loki that both were meant to be king. It's later revealed that Loki was the son of the Jotun king.\n\nIn Captain America: The First Avenger, when Red Skull acquires the cube, the old monk warns him that its power will burn him. In the climax, when Red Skull tries to use the cube himself, he is seemingly disintegrated by it.\n\nIn the beginning, a group of Nazis are scrambling to lift a lid off a tomb without any success. Minutes later, Schmidt walks over and effortlessly shoves the lid off by himself. We find out later that he had also taken the Super Soldier serum.\n\nIn X-Men: First Class, when we see Magneto as an adult, he uses his powers to slam a coin at a picture of Shaw in the forehead. This is how he kills Shaw in their final confrontation, except much slower.\n\nAlso part Chekhov's Skill where Erik asks Charles to shoot him point-blank and when met with Charles' refusal, he states he can deflect it. This comes back at the end where Moira shoots at Erik to stop him from sending the missiles back at the American and Russian navies and he easily deflects the bullets ... only to have one bullet hit Charles and paralyze him.\n\nAnd in a scene where Havok is learning to shoot straight in the bomb shelter, Charles and Hank are standing right to either side of the target manekin. Charles says, with light emphasis, \"And try not to hit ME, there's a good chap\". A little odd, considering Hank is just as likely to get hit, so it should be \"us\". Later in the movie, of course, Charles is hit by a bullet, due to standing right NEXT TO it's intended target, Erik.\n\nBefore the attack at the CIA base, Havok beats Darwin at a pinball game. Darwin declares \"Jesus man, you're killing me!\" Later, Shaw uses the energy absorbed from Havok's blast to kill Darwin.\n\nIn Deep Rising, there are several allusions to the revelation that the monsters are actually the tentacles of a humongous octopoid monster, most notably Finnegan's anecdote about the octopus and the bottle.\n\nTransformers: Dark of the Moon drops a few hints that something isn't quite right with Sentinel Prime, with the most obvious hint in hindsight being \" I've seen this one. This is the one where Spock goes nuts.\".\n\nAlso when Sentinel first wakes up, he accidentally attacks Optimus. The second time it happens, he attacks the Autobots intentionally.\n\nA subtle one is how the Decepticons were public service vehicles, police, military and construction vehicles while the Autobots were regular private civilian cars. Sentinel's vehicle mode was a fire truck.\n\nMearing had earlier pointed out that Sentinel's pillars could be used to bring an invasion.\n\nCarly's car is said to have a \"deep throaty engine\". Her car is Soundwave and voiced by Frank Welker.\n\nIn the film Unfaithful, Connie, the cheating wife in question, is on her way to meet her lover when she runs into some girlfriends. While having coffee with them, her lover shows up at the cafe. Unaware of Connie's relationship with him, one of the women proceeds to gush over how gorgeous she is, then half-jokes about how she wouldn't mind having a fling with him. The other woman denounces her for this, then reveals that she had an affair of her own and that it is the one thing in her life that she truly regrets. \"These things always end in disaster. Someone always gets hurt\". Despite this ominous and inadvertent (the other woman doesn't know about the fling either) warning, Connie continues the affair until sure enough, disaster strikes. Her husband finds out, kills her lover, and now they must contend with the possibility of him going to jail.\n\nThe first scene in The Artist shows George Valentin's latest silent adventure film. As his character is being subjected to Electric Torture, he is seen speaking, with the accompanying title card reading \"I won't talk! I won't say a word!\" Later, his refusal to do talkies leads to his film career falling apart.\n\nLater in the film, Peppy Miller, the young starlet whose first screen role was an extra in one of Valentin's movies, is seen starring in a movie called \"Guardian Angel\". She ends up becoming a guardian angel to Valentin, inviting him to stay in her mansion while he recovers from injuries sustained in a fire, and trying to help him get back into movies.\n\nPlayed with beautifully in Wood Allen's Match Point.\n\nSherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, Holmes warned Irene about working for Moriarty. When Irene outlived her usefulness to Moriarty, he kills her.\n\nWhen Holmes officially meets Moriarty, he tells him that if it one-hundred-percent guaranteed Moriarty's destruction, he would gladly accept his own. He follows this when he does a suicide leap off a cliff bringing Moriarty with him.\n\nEarlier than that, when showing Watson the web of conspiracy, Holmes told him he'd give his life to see Moriarty's demise.\n\nThe fate of the Parisian bomb-maker who kills himself to protect his loved ones from Moriarty.\n\nKill List foreshadows several events late in the film in its apparently innocuous early scenes:\n\nJay and Gal's drunken play fight at Jay's dinner party becomes a real fight when their relationship is tested late in the film.\n\nEarly on, Jay finds the cat has left a rabbit with its entrails hanging out — this mirrors how he finds the mortally wounded Gal in the tunnels late in the film.\n\nJay's play fight with Shel and Sammy foreshadows how the cult force him to fight and kill them for real at the climax.\n\nIn Master and Commander, this happens several times.\n\nBlakeney makes Calamy promise that if he dies, not to stitch him 'through the nose' when wrapping his body in his hammock. After Calamy is killed in the final battle, Blakeney asks to personally take care of his friend's body to make sure that the last stitch doesn't go through his nose.\n\nAn albatross appears and the Captain of the Marines tries to shoot it. Moments later, the bird dives low, the shot misses and hits Dr. Maturin.\n\nSpider-Man 3: Early on, after Peter and Mary Jane visit Harry Osborn in the hospital, a nurse comments to him how they really seem like good friends. Harry proudly states they're the best, and that he'd die for them. Guess what happens to him during the final battle?\n\nIn the The Avengers, when Loki arrives on the SHIELD airship, he briefly smirks at Bruce. Guess what or who his plan for escaping is?\n\nSteve tells Tony that Tony isn't the kind to sacrifice himself for a greater cause.\n\nThe Galaga gag becomes a subtle foreshadowing for the final showdown. Much like the unwinnable video game, the heroes fight endless hordes of alien ships.\n\nIn Ghost Rider, the Caretaker's identity as another Rider, who knows what it's like to be one first-hand, is implied by his having left exactly the right number of cups of water for Johnny to guzzle when he wakes up.\n\nProfessional Wrestling[]\n\nIn the Raw Legends episode of Monday Night Raw Randy Orton harassed both a scooter assisted Mark Henry and Big Show after Show was done talking to Matt Riddle. Months later Randy is in a tag team with Riddle who now has a gimmick where he comes out in a scooter.\n\nLiterature[]\n\nA rather interesting example shows up in Elantris. Near the start there is a mention of Hrathen as the savior of Arelon which most simply put down to simply stating his thoughts. it isn't until the end that you find out that Hrathen defects when he realizes how evil dilaf is, and then sacrifices his own life to kill him, saving the entire joint population of both Arelon and Teod from being annihilated by the derethi cult.\n\nGenesis 3:15 'he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.' If you're Christian, you probably think this is foreshadowing to Jesus punishing Satan (the snake) ... a few thousand years before he was born.\n\nAs well as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and every other prophetic book. Prophesies, in general, are this in real life.\n\nIn addition, many Old Testament events are similar to events in the New Testament. They are known as \"types.\"\n\nThe first volume of The Lord of the Rings has this ironic example: Frodo says, \"So far, my only hope has been to get here (Rivendell.) I hope I shan't have to go any further...I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has been as much as I want.\" Guess what the next two books are about?\n\nThere is also Gandalf's statement that, \"There are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world.\" when they enter Moria and only shortly before they encounter the balrog.\n\nAlso in FOTR, Elrond says to Boromir, \"Slow should you be to wind that horn again until you stand once more on the borders of your land and dire need is upon you.\" The next time he uses the horn, just before his death, fits these circumstances perfectly.\n\nHarry Potter has foreshadowing all the way through the seven book series, but there's also a lovely piece of cinematic foreshadowing in the Chamber of Secrets film: after the scene in which McGonagall describes the Chamber of Secrets, which has been hidden for centuries, it fades to a shot showing exactly what the characters are searching for: the secret entrance to the chamber. It's not until the end of the film that they learn that's what it is.\n\nMany of Professor Trelawney's predictions, while mostly inaccurate, sometimes end up echoing events later in the book. The most obvious example is in Half Blood Prince, in which Trelawney goes over Tarot readings. The Tower comes up, and Trelawney uses it to predict Harry's death... again. It's not till later in the book, in a chapter titled The Lighting Struck Tower when Snape kills Dumbledore on top of the astronomy tower.\n\nAnd of course, you have to consider also the fact that Harry did die in Deathly Hallows. Sort of. He was Only Mostly Dead.\n\nRon is king of this. He says about Tom Riddle \"maybe he killed Myrtle, that'd have done everyone a favour.\" Riddle did kill her! In Deathly Hallows, Ron almost predicts the taboo on saying \"Voldemort.\" The exact words were \"It feels like a jinx or something.\"!\n\nA bunch of the Horcruxes are even shown in the book, such as Slytherin's locket and Ravenclaw's tiara, although this overlaps with Chekhov's Gun.\n\nHarry foreshadows the events of the Tri-Wizard Tournament fairly early in Goblet of Fire.\n\nAn incredibly early bit of Foreshadowing occurs right in book one, when in an echo of his being Sorted, Harry dreams that a voice comes from Quirrell's turban telling him he should be in Slytherin. Apart from the fact we later find out he has qualities Slytherin (and Voldemort) prized and that he obtained some of these due to his link with Voldemort, there's the fact that of course Voldemort himself was under Quirrell's turban. Sometimes it seems as if Tonks's notion that Harry has Seer blood may not be that far off the mark...\n\nThis happens even in throw-away lines! In Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets after Harry was sent down the wrong chimney via Floo Powder, Draco is seen examining a cursed opal necklace that claimed the lives of 19 Muggles. Sound familiar? Not to mention that Draco had also shown interest in the Hand of Glory, which should also sound familiar for the very same reason.\n\nAnd he (Harry) is standing in the very cabinet that Draco uses to smuggle the Death Eaters into Hogwarts in Half-Blood Prince. Also note that Harry never closes the door to the cabinet all the way, which would result in him getting transported away.\n\nIn Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone, it was mentioned that \"Always the innocent are the first victims,\". In Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, the first victims of Voldemort's plan to be completely restored were Bertha Jorkins, Frank Bryce, Bartemius Crouch Senior (he was at fault but did not intend to help Voldemort) and Cedric Diggory.\n\nEarly in Wyrd Sisters, Granny Weatherwax says \"You'd have to be a born fool to be a king.\" By the end of the book, the court Fool has become the king. And not only that, he is a 'born fool' — his father and grandfather were Fools before him.\n\nA similar example crops up in Assassin's Quest by Robin Hobb. The character Kettle is part of a group who's looking for the White Prophet, and says with respect to their search \"Perhaps it is a fool's errand that I go on.\" Again, the White Prophet turns out to be the Fool.\n\nhappens throught all the second part of Foundation and Empire, this part of the book being full of situations that not only hint the powers of The Mule but also wouldn't have been possible without them; the casual reader passes by without noticing anything out of place, is only when you have completed the book and start rereading it that everything makes sense.\n\nAnother Discworld example: characters in previous City Watch books remark that there's no reason why the older but perfectly healthy Lady Sybil shouldn't be able to have children. It still takes her husband the whole length of The Fifth Elephant to get the happy hint.\n\nAnd another: in Thief of Time there's a weird little section where Lu-Tze cuts off a Yeti's head in order to show Lobsang their ability to manipulate time and avoid death. It seems sort of out of place, especially considering they're supposed to be in a bit of a hurry to get to the city, until Lu-Tze says \"I hope I'm never that desperate,\" at which point you are absolutely, without-a-doubt certain that by the end of the book he will be. Of course, this may also just be an example of The Law of Conservation of Detail and readers being Genre Savvy.\n\nMore cryptically, Death in the same novel is unable to see Lobsang Ludd. This appears to be hinting that Lobsang is immortal, until Fridge Logic reminds the reader that Death has seen plenty of other immortals before. The real reason turns out to be far stranger than that: Lobsang's life as an individual isn't destined to end with his death at all; instead, he ceases to exist as Lobsang when he merges with his other self, Jeremy Clockson.\n\nTwo notable examples occur in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. In the very first scene, George complains about how Gentle Giant Lennie always accidentally kills his pet mice. About halfway through the book, Carlson shoots Candy's dog. Both of these nicely build up the drama of the last chapter.\n\nThe whole book is dripping with foreshadowing if you know where to look.\n\nAn excellent example of foreshadowing is The Wheel of Time in The Great Hunt Turak mentions that the Emperess of the Seanchan Empire rules from the Court of the Nine Moons, and her favorite daughter is named Tuon. In The Shadow Rising Mat Cauthon is told he will marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons. Guess who the Daughter of the Nine Moons is? To put this in perspective The Great Hunt is the second book in the series, The Shadow Rising is book 4, and The Winter's Heart where Tuon actually enters the story is book 9.\n\nThis is in fact pretty much the entire principle behind the Wheel of Time books. That and clothes.\n\nAbout halfway through Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Elizabeth says to Darcy, \"I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\" He is.\n\nLong before that, when Jane is ill, Darcy and Elizabeth discuss the eventuality of Mr. Bingley suddenly leaving Netherfield at a friend's request. Darcy thinks it would be a lack of character to yield so easily to a friend, and Elizabeth thinks it's perfectly natural to be influenced by those who are dear to you. Guess who changed their opinion when Bingley does leave Netherfield in a hurry at his friend's request?\n\nIn the first Redwall book, Cluny had a nightmare where he was being chased by Martin the Warrior, and as the sword \"struck\" him, he was woken up by a giant bell. His final battle is in the bell-tower, where Matthias uses Martin's sword to chop the rope keeping the bell up, and it lands on Cluny's head.\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire is so full of this.\n\nOne example, right from the start: Lord Eddard Stark, on his way back from an execution, finds a direwolf (the symbol of his house) killed after being run through with the horn of a great stag (the symbol of House Baratheon). Sure enough, the coming of his old friend Robert Baratheon leads to the crippling of his son, the outbreak of civil war in Westeros, and his execution. It's also an example of in character foreshadowing: everyone else gets really uncomfortable when they see it, and his wife Catelyn wishes he would put more stock in its meaning.\n\nBeyond the Wall, Jon Snow is told a tale about his ancestors that involved two people hiding the crypts of Winterfell so well that no one found them. Guess how Bran, Rickon, and their group survive the Greyjoy-Bolton attack of Winterfell.\n\nAnimorphs is full of this, usually in the form of remarks the characters make. Read the series. Then read it again. You will be amazed.\n\nHere are only a select few examples from only the first book:\n\nMarco: \"We'd be totally famous. We'd get to be on Letterman for sure.\"\n\nAt the end of the series, they're practically the most famous people on Earth. Marco not only gets on Letterman, he even gets his own show.\n\nVisser Three: \"[...] And then I'll be Visser One.\"\n\nHe does get promoted to Visser One near the end of the series.\n\nJake (as narrator): \"I think maybe the Andalite meant even more to Tobias than to the rest of us.\"\n\nElfangor, the Andalite in question, is later revealed to be Tobias' father.\n\n[-Marco: \"Maybe it's your own brother you'll end up destroying.\"\n\nJake: \"Yes, maybe that's what will happen.\"-]\n\nJake ends up ordering his cousin to kill his brother.\n\nJake: \"Tobias! Get a grip. Don't start eating mice just because you're in a hawk's body. What's next? Roadkill?\"\n\nTobias ends up eating mice exactly because he gets stuck in a hawk body. He also resorts to roadkill when he has bad hunting luck.\n\nCassie: \"What are we going to do with dolphin morphs?\"\n\nThey acquire dolphin morphs shortly after, and use them on quite a number of underwater missions.\n\nJake (at Tobias): \"Too late for you to morph back now.\"\n\nUttered in reference to the strategic situation, right before Tobias passes the time limit and gets stuck in his hawk body.\n\nAlso done without words in the first book. Tobias is the one who has the deepest connection with Elfangor, who stays with him the longest. He does not know why, but we find out why in The Andalite Chronicles, with the parental reveal.\n\nDone rather badly in Twilight: Bella says something like \"nobody's gonna bite me\" in the first chapter. If you already know that the book is about vampires, which the back cover explicitly mentions, then this is pretty blatantly obvious.\n\nThe Horus Heresy books, particularly early on, seem to be a contest between the authors as to who can foreshadow the Foregone Conclusion best. There are a lot of comments about how space marines fighting other space marines would be unthinkable, gods and religions, particularly malignant ones, are a silly idea, etc etc.\n\nIn Z for Zachariah, a character who later turns out to be a Complete Monster tells the protagonist \"Ann Burden, you're going to wish I'd never come here.\" At the time he doesn't seem serious, but turns out to be very right.\n\nMatthew Reilly's Hover Car Racer has several bits of foreshadowing for important races. In professional races, the steering wheel is the only part of the car required to cross the line to finish the race if the car crashes close to the line (except for a particular race, and this becomes important too). Jason has dreams about blacking out on Liberty's Elbow (a tight hairpin turn around the Statue of Liberty). The Bradbury Principle is mentioned a couple of times before it happens.\n\nIn Dale Brown's Fatal Terrain, Brad Elliott says that he \"always thought I'd buy the farm in the cockpit of a B-52 after just saving the world from thermonuclear meltdown\". Guess what...\n\nThe lovely thing about the Suzumiya Haruhi novels is the anachronistic order which it's presented. There are foreshadows almost everywhere. For example, in Snow Mountain Syndrome, Kyon casually mentions a crazy ex-classmate who wanted to confess to Nagato. In the next novel, there's a story about it. The best foreshadow was from the first book, Melancholy, where Kunikuda mentioned that Kyon liked strange girls, and Kyon protests, claiming that she was just a good friend, and nothing more. In the ninth novel, Sasaki is introduced, and she IS strange enough to have her own anti-SOS Brigade.\n\nA truly hilarious example in the first novel. When Haruhi decides to recruit (kidnap) Mikuru into the (then unnamed) SOS Brigade, as Haruhi runs off to retrieve her, Kyon jokingly wonders if Haruhi had finally found an alien. Having run into Haruhi as she was leaving the club room, the next paragraph (only a sentence long), describes him entering the room. The very next line after that is, \"Yuki Nagato was already in the club room.\" (From the English translation)\n\nIn the Attack of the Clones novel after Zam, the assassin who tried to kill Padme, fails to shake Anakin clinging to her flyer off, she thinks desperation that \"Whoever rids the galaxy of these meddling stubborn creatures indeed deserves the mantle of an Imperor\". Well, what'd you know!\n\nBokonon tells the protagonist of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle what he would do if he were \"a younger man\"...such as the protagonist. It is heavily implied that John does exactly what Bokonon says. We know for a fact that he does part of it by the end of the book.\n\nPercy Jackson and The Olympians: In The Last Olympian, when Percy is trying to determine the most strategic location for his one mortal point, he chooses the small of his back in favor of an armpit, being more dignified. Anyone want to guess where Luke's body's Achilles spot is?\n\nThe novel To Kill a Mockingbird spends an entire chapter detailing local racist Bob Ewell's attempts at getting revenge on everyone he blames for being outed as a liar (he had beaten his daughter after catching her trying to seduce a black man and forced her to accuse the innocent man of rape. Despite evidence of his innocence, the man was convicted and fatally shot trying to escape.), stalking the man's widow, the trial judge, and explicitly threatening the man's lawyer, Atticus Finch. In the next chapter, as Atticus' children prepare to go to a Halloween party, their aunt mentions an uneasy feeling, \"Something just walked over my grave\". The children are viciously attacked by Ewell on their way home, and it is all but stated that they would have been killed had someone not heard their screams and come to help.\n\nWhen Atticus, who has made it clear that he is adverse to violence, goes out into the neighborhood to \"take care of\" the rabid dog it foreshadows both his battle against the legal system and the climax of the book.\n\nAnd Then There Were None. Soon after arriving to a manor with several others, one of the characters goes into his room and takes a bath while pondering what he's going to do next: \"Warm steaming water — tired limbs — presently a shave — a cocktaildinner. And after — ?\" He dies during the dinner.\n\nIn Myth-Chief, Aahz and Skeeve are competing over who gets to be the new president of M.Y.T.H., Inc. Early on, Guido accidentally calls Bunny \"boss\", foreshadowing who eventually gets the job.\n\nIn Moby Dick, the landlord of the inn at the beginning of the book is named Peter Coffin. At the end, Ishmael survives by clinging to a coffin.\n\nThe 2003 Bionicle book Tales of the Masks is full of foreshadowing, hinting at a mysterious, forgotten past and an ancient city called Metru Nui. The following two years focused entirely on this. Later, in the '05 book Time Trap, Toa Vakama received a vision that faintly hinted at the '06 storyline.\n\nA very coy example appears in Steven Brust's Phoenix, in which Vlad asks Loiosh if Rocza is pregnant in passing. This seems innocuous at the time, except that Loiosh replies that Rocza isn't pregnant, but is \"a little closer to Cawti\". Turns out that Vlad should have been asking Cawti whether she was pregnant.\n\nIn the Sword of Truth novels, the best example is in the sixth book, Faith of the Fallen. Right after Nicci forcibly takes Richard prisoner and right before he leaves with her to the Old World, Kahlan tells Richard that he should, \"Carve something to make Nicci see that you should be free.\" Richard dismisses this as unnecessary and silly. At the climax, when Nicci sees the statues on the cover of the book that Richard carved, she has an epiphany, sets Richard and Kahlan free, and pulls a Heel Face Turn.\n\nIn the first chapter of Dead Souls the author mentions that Chichikov (the protagonist) is able to talk about custom officials \"as if he had been one of them\". Much later we'll learn that this has indeed been the case — and that he tried a big smuggle operation, which almost would've made him a rich man.\n\nOriginally, each Magic School Bus book ended with Ms. Fizzle setting up classroom decorations and donning an outfit relating to the subject of the next book. (eg, the book preceding the class' trip inside a hurricane ended with her displaying weather-measuring equipment and wearing a dress boasting stormy imagery.) Series Fauxnales had Ms. Frizzle wear a dress covered in question marks on the last page.\n\nTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea:\n\nThe first time he sees Captain Nemo, Aronnax instinctively trust him because Beauty Equals Goodness, but later reevaluates his beliefs when it seems that man is going to left them starving in a cell. Cue the final of the novel…\n\nLooking at the marvels of the South Pole, Ned Land says that These Are Things Man Was Not Meant to Know… just next chapter, the Nautilus is Almost Out of Oxygen.\n\nNed Land, Great White Hunter, is ashamed when Ubermensch Captain Nemo KicksTheCachalots in a terrible massacre. At the end of the novel, Nemo will Kick the Dog again…\n\nIn Conspiracies, Repairman Jack encounters the Twins, agents of the Ally who are the basis for that Verse's \"men in black\" rumors, and are noted for driving around with their headlights off. After his attempt to get away from the pair causes their deaths, Jack vacates the area, driving away in the dark with his headlights off. Guess whose job he just inherited?\n\nIn Dostoevsky's The Idiot, Nastassya Filippovna makes a comment about Rogozhin becoming consumed by his passions and ending up being exiled to Siberia. Much later on, Rogozhin murders her...and is sentenced to fifteen years' hard labour in Siberia.\n\nEarly in S.E. Hinton's That Was Then, This Is Now, Byron muses about how Angela would look beautiful even with all her hair cut off. Later in the book, his friend Mark does exactly that to her while she's passed out drunk.\n\nJack London's short story, \"To Build A Fire\", is most frequently used to teach this trope in high school English classes. The reader knows the main character's a goner long before he does.\n\nIn The Kite Runner, Amir reads Hassan a story about Rostam and Sohrab. Rostam kills Sohrab in battle, not knowing that Sohrab is his son. Later in the book, Amir blames himself for Hassan's death, and learns that he was his half-brother.\n\nIn \"Lost In a Good Book\", second of Jasper Fforde's \"Thursday Next\" series, pairs of amusingly named agents appear throughout the novel. Examples include agents 'Kannon' and 'Phodder', and 'Lamm' and 'Slaughter'. These names foreshadow their inevitable horrible deaths.\n\nLive Action TV[]\n\nDanis House has S4 E9 Pen Pal with Jack's pen pal talking in a very fake Japanese accent. He's faking it — he's Cornish.\n\nLost has many examples, but the most prominent is in the pilot: Locke and Walt play backgammon and Locke mentions that it's the oldest game in the world and there's two players: one light, one dark. The final season reveals that the series' events revolved around two people, one \"light\" and one \"dark\", each having a goal that's part of what's essentially a game they invented in their childhood, and they've been at it for two thousand years.\n\nThe first time we see Juliet's face, it's her reflection in a mirror. In season 5 she sacrifices herself believing it will create a Mirror Universe.\n\nThe Wizards of Waverly Place's episode \"Future Harper\" is a festival of foreshadowing.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer is laced with foreshadowing, because of Joss Whedon's long-term planning:\n\n\"I'm so evil and skanky. And I think I'm kinda gay.\" — Willow Rosenberg about her vampire Doppelganger, a year before she did become gay — and three before she almost destroyed the world.\n\nResults in something of a terrifying echo, especially if you watch the second season again after knowing what happens. When Willow first utters 'Bored now' as a vampire, it actually gives you chills.\n\nForshadowing only counts if it's intentional. Joss has admitted that neither of those plot lines were in the works when that line was written.\n\nWrong. He had been planning either Willow or Xander to be gay for a while. Though, I still think the man needs to learn the word bisexual or just say that Oz was confusion (oh, and verbally bitchslap Kennedy with the word sooner or later for her actions towards Satsu).\n\nSimilarly, Dawn Summers' arrival was foreshadowed by dream dialogue in two different episodes in season four: In \"This Year's Girl,\" Faith and Buffy are making a bed in Dawn's future room when they have this exchange:\n\nAnd in the season finale \"Restless\", one episode before Dawn's appearance, Tara urged Buffy to \"be back before Dawn.\"\n\nThere's also a remark somewhere about \"trying on big sister's clothes\".\n\nFaith's mention of counting down from \"seven-three-oh\" foreshadows the fifth season finale, exactly 730 days later. The end of season 4 also makes reference to the scene with Faith while foreshadowing season 5, and mentions that a clock showing 7.30 is now \"way out\".\n\nXander dresses as a pirate in the season six episode, and then in the seventh season he loses an eye and has to wear an eye patch.\n\nThere's a very subtle one during first season where Buffy is hanging out with her friends and she says bite me. Cue Angel looking all weird at Buffy.\n\nAt the end of \"The Harvest\" Angel appears to be standing next to a sign saying WATCH YOU — appropriate enough for his Mysterious Watcher role. But when he walks away we see the sign actually reads WATCH YOUR STEP, foretelling his Face Heel Turn into Angelus. Similarly at the end of \"After Life\" Buffy's other vampire Love Interest, Spike, is standing next to a discarded door with a BEWARE OF DOG sign, hinting at the Destructive Romance to follow.\n\nAngel had its share as well. \"Soul Purpose\" in season 5 pops to mind rather quickly. When Fred is doing surgery on Angel in his coma-dream, she looks in and tells him \"there's nothing left, just a shell\". A Lthough mainly referring to Angel, it was likely also a reference to her becoming a literal shell for Illyria several eps later.\n\nIn the same ep, Gunn growls like a cat during another dream scene. In \"A Hole In The World\" the white room's cat conduit is gone, replaced with a evil Gunn twin.\n\nEarlier in season 3, Wesley has a talk with Gunn about \"the pull of conflicting loyalties\". This is a kind of foreshadowing of Wes's own conflict with Connor and the team.\n\nHighlander the Series foreshadowed Richie's immortality in the first ep, after the defeat of Slan.\n\nWe did find out later that immortals can sense pre-immortality faintly, so it's probably justified.\n\nCharmed's Season 3 finale gives Prue Halliwell the line, \"This has to end now or our lives are over!\" At the end of the episode, she dies. Permanently.\n\nFrom the season 2 episode \"Morality Bites\" when future Phoebe receives a premonition of how she killed a man, she is seen floating up into the air. In season 3 she gains the power of levitation.\n\n[[Black Mirror]]: USS Callister: At the beginning of the episode, Captain Daly defeats the villain by going through an asteroid gas chamber. Near the end of the episode, his mutinous crew escape him by going through an asteroid belt and into a wormhole.\n\nFriends: Some may be a bit far-fetched in retrospect but:\n\nChandler and Monica's relationship (which began on the 4th season finale): Several previous episodes hint at the possibility, and often near the end of a season (i.e. when Ben's born, when Mon laughs at the hypothetical scenario).\n\nRoss and Rachel: From the very first episode, although that's pretty obvious as the show (especially during its beginning) is basically about them.\n\nIn a 2nd season episode, Ross mentions he likes that name. Two years later, he meets an English girl called Emily, who then becomes his second wife.\n\nRachel's baby's father: It's a bit suspicious that there's no major interaction between Ross and Rachel during the 7th season's last episodes (i.e. after they slept together and when she realizes she's pregnant) and the 8th season's premiere. Then, on the 8th season's second episode, she mentions the best sex she ever had with him. Guess what's revealed at the end of that same episode?\n\nDawson's Creek, especially in the third season and regarding the Pacey/Joey/Dawson love triangle. It's mainly foreshadowed in dialogue between Pacey and Jen, with lines such as \"the sidekick never gets the girl\" or \"what does (Joey) have that all men seek her?\" (or something to that effect).\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Freak Show has Dandy Mott mentioning that he hates his mother (he mentions that she didn’t want him to become an actor, likely because this would involve him leaving her), during his speech about his intentions of becoming a serial killer…which foreshadows him shooting her in the head. Additionally, earlier on in the episode that Dandy kills her, he mentioned to his psychiatrist that he was considering bathing in people’s blood.\n\nEarly in the season, Dandy Mott expressed the desire to join the freak show. But Jimmy decided to politely turn down his request, explaining that he’s living a far better life than the freaks themselves. Considering what an awful employer he was to the freaks when he replaced Elsa, that was probably for the best. As to why he wanted to join the freak show in the first place, guess what? Desiree told him he was the biggest freak of them all after all the horrible things he did.\n\nBeverly Hills, 90210, third season as well: Dylan seems oddly concerne"
