        "text": "Dollhouse’s Eliza Dushku might be going back to Joss Whedon’s laboratory of evil soon — she told an interviewer the duo aim to make a movie together. And she also still hopes to be in Ghostbusters 3.\n\nTalking to HollywoodLife.com, Dushku says that she’s definitely up for being one of the five new Ghostbusters who are rumored to pick up the torch from Venkman and company in the new movie. And she says her pal Dan Aykroyd wants her in the film. But she adds: “I don’t know anything, I don’t have a script – it’s still a rumor thing right now.”\n\nMeanwhile, though, she sounds more sanguine about this mystery film project with her Dollhouse collaborator, Whedon:\n\n“I would say that we would [be working on something new very soon]!” she confided to us. “I think we’re going to work on a kickass feature together that we’ve been thinking about for a few years.”\n\nNote, of course, that the part where she says they’ll be working on something together soon is in square brackets, meaning it’s a paraphrase. (Maybe the interviewer asked “Will you work with Joss Whedon again soon?” And she replied with the part not in brackets. That’s my guess, anyway.)"
