        "text": "Devin: Serenity is going to come out and it’s going to do what it does. If it does well, you’ll come back for more, but either way I am sure Serenity II wouldn’t be the next thing you do. Is there another original project that you have percolating?\n\nWhedon: Well, there’s there’s Wonder Woman obviously. But yes, I have other stuff I’m not going to talk about just yet. I have some ideas. But again, fitting in the Serenity sequel to my busy schedule should be the problem I’m faced with. However, if I’m faced with it, it’ll actually be a problem!\n\nDamn you, Joss Whedon! What a scoop it would have been if you had told me that Universal was going to have you direct your spec script, Goner. Oh what a coup indeed.\n\n\"It’s the story of a young woman’s journey that involves a great deal of horror and some heroics,\" he told Variety. \"It’s certainly darker than ‘Serenity,’ and there are a lot of left turns along the way. It is something I had in mind for a while, and it just poured out of me when I finished my film.\"\n\n\"I was given license to purely make it my own and yet she is already an iconic Amazon princess,\" Whedon said when asked about his Wonder Woman gig. \" ‘Goner’ has some similarities, but the heroines could not be more different, and the story is a bit more intimate and less complicated than ‘Wonder Woman.’ \"\n\nWell, I can see the comments a mile away – a female heroic horror story again? The details are vague, though, so we’ll see what this is really about. When I asked my question about new original projects, I was hoping that Joss would bust out with something completely unlike Buffy. And I still am. Hoping.\n\nCheck out part 1 of my epic one on one where he doesn’t reveal Goner to me right here, and part 2 right here.\n\nDon’t really feel that bad for Devin on our message board!"
