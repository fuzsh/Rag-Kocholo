I'm thrilled he'll be loaning us his fantastic groundbreaking talent.\"\n\nAnd there's no reason to panic, \"Dollhouse\" fans: I'm told the auteur's moonlighting in no way, shape or form suggests that that show is a goner. He'd most likely tackle the side job after Eliza Dushku and Co. have wrapped their 13-episode order.\n\nEW.com: 25 best TV episodes associated with Joss Whedon\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly"
