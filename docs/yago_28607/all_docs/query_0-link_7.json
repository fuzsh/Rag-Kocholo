        "text": "Universal Pictures has forked over seven figures to Joss Whedon for him to direct his fantasy thriller spec script GONERS, reports VARIETY. Mary Parent and Scott Stuber are set to produce.\n\n\"It's the story of a young woman's journey that involves a great deal of horror and some heroics,\" Whedon said. \"It's certainly darker than SERENITY, and there are a lot of left turns along the way. It is something I had in mind for a while, and it just poured out of me when I finished my film.\"\n\nNo time schedule has been set for GONERS, which will most likely be the project he does after Warner Bros. WONDER WOMAN, which he is currently writing."
