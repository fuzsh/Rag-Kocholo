        "text": "“Buffy” creator and “Serenity” director Joss Whedon has confirmed at Whedonesque that he is no longer slated to make the “Wonder Woman” movie.\n\nThe split however seems rather amicable – Whedon’s take on the film wasn’t liked by Silver Pictures – “We just saw different movies, and at the price range this kind of movie hangs in, that’s never gonna work. Non-sympatico. It happens all the time” says Whedon.\n\nHe also explains the reasons behind the delays – “Everybody knows how long I was taking, what a struggle that script was, and though I felt good about what I was coming up with, it was never gonna be a simple slam-dunk… The worst thing that can happen in this scenario is that the studio just keeps hammering out changes and the writer falls into a horrible limbo of development. These guys had the clarity and grace to skip that part. So I’m a free man”.\n\nHe also confirms that despite all the talk “I never had an actress picked out, or even a consistant front-runner. I didn’t have time to waste on casting when I was so busy air-balling on the script”.\n\nSo what’s next? He plans to “finally finish polishing” the script for “Goners” and planning assorted other projects – nothing concrete as yet."
