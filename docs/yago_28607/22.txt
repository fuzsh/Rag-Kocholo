“Goners” is a supernatural/thriller movie from the mind of Joss Whedon (Serenity) and is under development by Universal Pictures, produced by Mary Parent and Scott Stuber.

Though the project currently has no firm release date, and has not yet entered production, the anticipation is already growing due to the intense loyalty of Joss Whedon’s fans!

It was originally announced in Variety in September 2005. This project has been through various stages during the last couple of years and is awaiting final script confirmation.
