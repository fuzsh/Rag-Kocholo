Born on May 31, 1930, Clint Eastwood is an American actor, film director, producer, musician, and politician. He rose to international fame in the 1960s for his roles in Sergio Leoneâ€™s spaghetti Westerns, then as a antihero cop Harry Callahan, better known as Dirty Harry.

The interesting and predestined fact about his name though, is that Old West Action is an anagram of Clint Eastwood!

Coincidence or destiny?
