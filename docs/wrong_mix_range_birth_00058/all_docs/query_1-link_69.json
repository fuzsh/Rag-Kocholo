        "text": "UPDATED: Check out the celebrities turning 90 in 2021!\n\nCelebrities born in 1930 turn 90 years old in 2020. These stars have accomplished so much over the course of nearly a century, and some continue to work to this day. Continue on to learn more about famous people born in 1930.\n\nJoining the elite group of celebrities in their 90s is actor and director Clint Eastwood. Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, and Robert Evans are other famous 90 year old actors. Other famous 90 year olds include politicians like Sandra Day O'Connor and James Baker.\n\nWhile this list has several actors born in 1930, it also includes astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. Aldrin was the second man in history to walk on the Moon, and Collins manned the Apollo 11 command module while Aldrin and Armstrong made their landing.\n\nRead below to find out all the 90 year old celebrities still alive today.\n\nClint Eastwood, a name synonymous with Hollywood's gritty charm and charisma, is celebrated for his remarkable contributions as an actor, filmmaker, musician, and political figure. Born on May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, California, Eastwood's journey to stardom began when he moved to Los Angeles in the 1950s. It was here that he broke into the entertainment industry, initially securing minor roles until he landed his breakthrough role as Rowdy Yates in the television series Rawhide. Eastwood's career took a monumental turn when he ventured into the Spaghetti Western genre under the direction of Sergio Leone. His iconic portrayal of the Man with No Name in films like A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly propelled him to international stardom. However, it was his role as Dirty Harry Callahan in the eponymous five-film series that solidified his status as a bona fide action star. His trademark squint and gravelly voice became cinematic staples, marking him as a symbol of rugged individualism. In addition to his acting career, Eastwood has also made significant contributions behind the camera. His directorial debut came in 1971 with Play Misty for Me, and he has since directed numerous acclaimed films, including Unforgiven, which won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Eastwood's influence extends beyond film and television; he served as the Mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California from 1986 to 1988, and his passion for music has seen him score several of his own films. Clint Eastwood's diverse talents and enduring appeal have made him a true icon of American cinema and culture.\n\nBorn : 05-31-1930\n\nBirthplace : San Francisco, California, United States of America\n\nHailing from an austere background in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, Sir Thomas Sean Connery had a life trajectory that would inspire many. The legendary actor, best known for his portrayal of the iconic James Bond character in seven films between 1962 and 1983, was much more than his on-screen persona. His journey from a milkman to one of the most admired and influential figures in the world of cinema is a testament to his sheer determination and unparalleled talent. Connery's early life was marked by hardship and struggle. Born on August 25, 1930, he left school at an early age to support his family, working various jobs before joining the Royal Navy. However, it was during his stint as a backstage hand at the King's Theatre in the late 1950s that he developed a fascination for acting. This passion led him to secure minor roles in television, theater, and films. His big break came when he was chosen to play James Bond in Dr. Nobgh (1962), a role that not only catapulted him to international stardom but also redefined the spy genre. Despite his overwhelming success as Bond, Connery yearned to escape typecasting and took on diverse roles in films like The Man Who Would Be King, Murder on the Orient Express, and The Untouchables. His performance in the latter earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He continued to captivate audiences with his powerful performances until his retirement in 2006. Off-screen, Connery was known for his philanthropy, his staunch support for Scottish independence, and his love for golf. A celebrated figure in the film industry, Connery's enduring charm, charismatic screen presence, and distinctive voice have firmly etched his legacy into the annals of cinema history.\n\nBorn : 08-25-1930\n\nBirthplace : Edinburgh, Scotland, UK\n\nBuzz Aldrin, born Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr., is an American astronaut and mechanical engineer who made significant contributions to the history of space exploration. Born on January 20, 1930, in Montclair, New Jersey, Aldrin graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and later earned a doctorate in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Aldrin's name came into prominence when he joined NASA's Astronaut Group 3 in 1963. His first spaceflight occurred in 1966 aboard Gemini 12, where he set a record for extravehicular activity and effectively proved that astronauts could work outside spacecraft. However, it was his second spaceflight that would etch his name in gold in the annals of history. As a member of the Apollo 11 mission, Aldrin became the second person to walk on the moon on July 20, 1969, following mission commander Neil Armstrong. This monumental achievement was watched by millions around the globe and stands as a pivotal moment in human space exploration. Post-NASA career, Aldrin continued to advocate for space exploration and has written numerous books and papers on the subject. He proposed a special spacecraft cycling system, now known as the Aldrin cycler, aiming to provide regular, cost-effective travel to Mars. To this day, Aldrin has remained a prominent figure in the public eye, often speaking at events and appearing in popular culture as an icon of human adventure and discovery. His life serves as a testament to the power of human ambition and the limitless possibilities of exploration.\n\nBorn : 01-20-1930\n\nBirthplace : USA, Glen Ridge, New Jersey\n\nStephen Sondheim, an American composer and lyricist, has etched his name in the annals of musical theatre with his unsurpassed creativity and innovation. Born on March 22, 1930, in New York City, Sondheim exhibited a deep affinity for music from an early age. As a student of the renowned Oscar Hammerstein II, he was instrumental in shaping the future of American theater. Sondheim's illustrious career is distinguished by his ability to seamlessly blend complex narratives with intricate wordplay and music. His debut as a lyricist with West Side Story in 1957 marked the start of his consistent contributions to Broadway. His compositions often challenged traditional forms, pushing the boundaries of musical storytelling. Some of his most acclaimed works include Into the Woods, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Sunday in the Park with George. Each work provides a testament to his unique approach and artistic vision, which led him to be revered by audiences and critics alike. Throughout his career, Sondheim received numerous accolades, including multiple Tony Awards, an Academy Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. In 2015, he was honoured with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His influence reaches far beyond these recognitions, however. Sondheim's pioneering work reshaped musical theatre, inspiring countless artists. His legacy continues to live on, serving as a beacon for aspiring composers and lyricists across the globe.\n\nBorn : 03-22-1930\n\nBirthplace : New York City, USA, New York\n\nMichael Collins (October 31, 1930 – April 28, 2021) was a former American astronaut, test pilot and major general of the United States Air Force Reserves. Selected as part of the third group of fourteen astronauts in 1963, he flew into space twice. His first spaceflight was on Gemini 10, in which he and Command Pilot John Young performed orbital rendezvous with two different spacecraft and undertook two extravehicular activities (EVAs, also known as spacewalks). His second spaceflight was as the command module pilot for Apollo 11. Collins is one of 24 people to have flown to the Moon, which he orbited thirty times. He was the seventeenth American in space, the fourth person (and third American) to perform a spacewalk, the first person to have performed more than one spacewalk, and, after Young, who flew the command module on Apollo 10, the second person to orbit the Moon alone.\n\nBorn : 10-31-1930\n\nBirthplace : Rome, Italy\n\nBorn Nathalie Kay Hedren on January 19, 1930, in New Ulm, Minnesota, Tippi Hedren is a revered figure in the world of Hollywood. She embarked on her career as a successful fashion model in the 1950s before making a significant shift to acting. Hedren's breakthrough came after being discovered by acclaimed director Alfred Hitchcock, who was smitten by her grace and beauty during one of her television commercials. He offered Hedren her first acting role, casting her as the lead in his psychological thriller The Birds in 1963. This led to a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer, propelling Hedren into the limelight. Following up on her success with The Birds, Hedren continued working with Hitchcock, starring in Marnie in 1964. Despite experiencing a tumultuous professional relationship with Hitchcock, she managed to deliver impressive performances that etched her name in Hollywood's history. However, Hedren's career took an unexpected turn after her fallout with Hitchcock, leading to fewer roles in high-profile films. Nevertheless, she continued to act in various television series and independent movies, exhibiting her dedication to her craft. Beyond her acting career, Hedren also significantly impacted the world of animal rights activism. She established the Roar Foundation and the Shambala Preserve, a sanctuary housing neglected and abused exotic animals. Furthermore, she played a crucial part in changing the laws regarding the treatment of animals in Hollywood productions. Additionally, Hedren had an indirect influence on the beauty industry by mentoring Vietnamese women refugees in the art of manicuring, leading to a substantial rise in Vietnamese-owned nail salons across the United States. With her immense contributions to various fields, Tippi Hedren remains a noteworthy and influential figure, illustrating resilience, courage, and compassion throughout her life.\n\nBorn : 01-19-1930\n\nBirthplace : New Ulm, Minnesota, USA"
