        "text": "2015-2022 * Record: 91-18\n\nUga IX officially retired as the Bulldogs’ mascot at the end of the 2014 season. After a three-month “audition” in that role, his grandson “Que” was formally crowned as his successor in a collaring ceremony prior to the Georgia- Georgia Southern game on Nov. 21, 2015. During his audition, he made appearances at the Countdown to Kickoff event in July 2015, as well as Picture Day in August, before presiding over the entirety of the 2015 football season. Que capped his inaugural season by leading the team to a 24-17 victory over Penn State at the 2016 Taxslayer Bowl.\n\nQue was two and half years old when he began his reign as Georgia's beloved mascot in 2015. He compiled an impressive 91-18 record, which included back-to-back College Football Playoff National Championships, two SEC titles and victories in the Rose, Sugar, Orange and Peach bowls.\n\nUga X joined \"Seiler's Uga Three\" as the only two Bulldogs in Georgia history to win a national championship and passed Uga VI, who reigned from 1999-2008, as the winningest Bulldog in Georgia lore.\n\n2012-2015 * Record: 44-19\n\n\"Russ,\" the half-brother of Uga VII who has served as interim mascot for the Georgia Bulldogs, has received a \"battlefield promotion\" and assumed the title of \"Uga IX\" prior to the Florida Atlantic game on September 15, 2012.\n\n\"Russ\" served as the Bulldog Mascot a total of 25 games beginning with the Georgia Tech game in Atlanta in 2009 helping his squad to a 30-24 win. Russ worked a total of nine games during the 2009 and 2010 seasons. Following the unexpected death of Uga VII on Nov. 19, 2009, Russ served as interim mascot the final two games of the 2009 season and the first six games of 2010. Uga VIII was introduced on Oct. 16, 2010 prior to the Georgia-Vanderbilt game. Russ was pressed back into duty prior to the 2010 Liberty Bowl and stayed on following the untimely death of Uga VIII in February, 2011.\n\nHe roamed the sidelines at all 14 games during the 2011 season. He then served for two wins at the beginning of the 2012 season before being promoted as Uga IX prior to the Florida Atlantic game on Sept. 15, 2012. His time as mascot has included the 2011 and 2012 SEC Eastern Division championship, two road wins at Georgia Tech, a victory over Texas A&M in the 2009 Independence Bowl in Shreveport, La. and a win at the Capital One Bowl in Orlando, Fl. on January 1, 2013 against Nebraska. Uga IX finished 2013 with an 8-5 record. He completed the 2014 season with a 10-3 mark, capped by a victory over 20th-ranked Louisville in the Belk Bowl.\n\nHe was the first substitute mascot since \"Otto\" in 1986.\n\n\"Russ has endeared himself to the Georgia people over the last three years,\" said UGA Director of Athletics Greg McGarity. \"His dedication to duty when called upon has been exemplary and it's fitting that he takes his place in the official line of Georgia mascots.\"\n\n2008-2009 * Record: 16-7\n\nThe seventh in the Uga line of Georgia mascots was introduced to the Georgia fans on Saturday, Aug. 30, 2008, during pre-game ceremonies of the Bulldogs' season opener against Georgia Southern.\n\n\"Loran's Best\" officially became \"Uga VII,\" when he was introduced. Uga VII was escorted onto the field by members of the Frank W. \"Sonny\" Seiler family of Savannah who have owned the continuous line of mascots since Uga I took up the mantle in 1956. The first year was a success for the laidback mascot. He was not bothered by flying in an airplane, taking photos with excited fans and was oblivious to the crowd noise during games.\n\nUga VII, at 56 and one half pounds, completed the 2008 season with a 24-12 win at the Capital One Bowl in Orlando and ended his first season with a record of 10-3.\n\nUga VII passed away unexpectedly on Nov. 19, 2009 of heart-related causes. It was the Thursday before the final home game of the 2009 season and the Bulldogs did not have a live mascot at the game. Instead, a wreath was placed on Uga VII's doghouse, and the players wore a special Uga VII decal on their helmets to remember him.\n\n1999-2008 * Record: 87-27\n\nIn 2007, Uga VI became the winningest mascot in school history at that time with a record of 87-27. He reigned over more games than any other mascot at 114.\n\nThe pregame passing of the bone ceremony from Uga V to his heftier and friskier son, Whatchagot Loran, took place at the 1999 Georgia-South Carolina contest. Only a year old at his coronation, Uga VI stands as the biggest of all the Uga mascots weighing in at 65 pounds - 20 pounds heavier than his father.\n\nHis first season climaxed in a magnificent come from behind victory over Purdue at the Outback Bowl in Tampa. The comeback from a 25-point deficit marked an unprecedented feat in Georgia annals and the largest comeback in collegiate bowl history.\n\nThe 2000 season ended in Hawaii, but due to the distance and a quarantine rule, Uga VI missed the O'ahu Bowl, marking the first time the Georgia mascot had missed a postseason game since the 1969 Sun Bowl.\n\nAlongside first-year head coach Mark Richt, Uga VI saw his third consecutive 8-4 season.The 2002 Bulldogs won a record 13 games (to only one loss), and topped Arkansas to win the program's first league title since 1982. And Uga VI roamed the sidelines as the Bulldogs defeated Florida State in the 2003 Nokia Sugar Bowl, 26-13.\n\nThe wins kept piling up for Uga VI and the Bulldogs in 2003, as the team posted an 11-3 record, returned to the SEC Championship game before falling to eventual national champion LSU. Georgia held on for a 34-27 overtime victory against Purdue in the Capital One Bowl in Orlando.\n\nIn the 2004 season, the Bulldogs posted a 10-2 record with a 24-21 win against Wisconsin in the Outback Bowl.\n\nYear 2005 ended with a record of 10-3 and a loss in the Nokia Sugar Bowl 38-35 against West Virginia on January 2, 2006. The game was played in Atlanta, Ga. due to destruction in New Orleans from Hurricane Katrina. Georgia returned to Atlanta, Ga. to defeat Virginia Tech in the Chick-fil-A Bowl on December 30, 2006 to end the 2006 season with a 9-4 record.\n\nThe Bulldogs defeated the Hawaii Warriors 41-10 in the Allstate Sugar Bowl on January 1, 2008 in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, La. ending the 2007 season ranked second in the AP poll.\n\nEpitaph: A Big Dog For A Big Job, And He Handled It Well\n\n1990-99 * Record: 65-39-1\n\nIn the first game of 1990, Uga V officially began his reign as the Georgia mascot taking over from his father Uga IV, who passed away at his home in Savannah on Feb. 26, 1990. Uga V was the last pup sired by Uga IV and was born on March 6, 1990.\n\nNamed in honor of one of the greatest Bulldogs, Dan Magill, former Assistant Athletic Director for Public Relations and longtime tennis coach and sports information director. Surprisingly, the Seiler family became aware that Uga IV's mate was expecting only 10 days before the litter was due. This notice came a week after Uga IV had passed away at his home in Savannah from kidney failure. There were only three pups in the litter and the last one born on March 6 was the only solid white male.\n\nUga V had been perhaps the most well known of all the Bulldog mascots highlighted by his appearance on the cover of the April 28, 1997, Sports Illustrated which declared him the nation's best college mascot. Rocketed to stardom, he also appeared in Clint Eastwood's \"Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil\" - filmed in his hometown of Savannah, Ga. Uga V also presided over Georgia's most successful collective sporting effort in department history as the Bulldogs claimed four NCAA team titles during the 1998-99 season - women's swimming and diving, women's gymnastics, men's tennis and men's golf - and placed second in the Directors' Cup race. He died on Nov. 22, 1999, just over two months after his retirement.\n\nEpitaph: Defender Of His Turf\n\n1981-89 * Record: 77-27-4\n\nUga IV was perhaps the most active of all the Georgia mascots, standing as the only one to attend a bowl game every year of his service (1981-89). He took over for Uga III in the 1981 season opener and over the next nine seasons, led Georgia to a record of 77-27-4. The highlight of his career was his personal appearance at the Heisman Trophy Banquet with Herschel Walker in New York on December 9, 1982. Uga IV was escorted through the banquet hall by the president of the Downtown Athletic Club, and was earlier photographed with Walker by news photographers from across the country. The proud Bulldog donned his game jersey for the outing but added the formal touch of a collar and black tie. Uga IV was the first mascot invited to the Heisman Banquet.\n\nDeclared \"Dog of the Decade\" by Vince Dooley in 1991, Uga IV was posthumously awarded the highest honor available to University of Georgia mascots - the Georgia varsity letter.\n\nEpitaph: The Dog Of The Decade"
