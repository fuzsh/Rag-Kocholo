        "text": "SAGINAW TWP, MI — A Saginaw native who has been climbing the Hollywood ranks as an actor is the star of a new Clint Eastwood movie about Richard Jewell.\n\nPaul Walter Hauser portrays Jewell, a security guard who found a backpack with pipe bombs inside it at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Jewell alerted the police and helped to evacuate people from the area before the bomb exploded. Jewell initially was hailed as a hero until it was reported he was being investigated as a person of interest by the FBI.\n\nThe movie “Richard Jewell” is set to premiere in theaters on Friday, Dec. 13.\n\nHauser said he trained for the role to play Jewell by watching lots of video footage and studying photos and other materials.\n\n“I watched a lot of footage of Richard and tried to pick up on mannerisms and his general energy and spirit, which had such a Southern chivalry and a sense of duty,” Hauser said via email to MLive-The Saginaw News.\n\nHauser, a Valley Lutheran High School alumnus, has been in the spotlight since he was a child, landing roles in TV series and movies such as “Super Troopers 2,” “I, Tonya” and “BlackKklansman.”\n\nHis mother, Deborah Hauser, who still lives in Saginaw County, describes her son as having a “bigger than life” personality. From a young age, Hauser said she encouraged all four of her children to pursue their dreams, despite the obstacles they might face.\n\nPaul Walter Hauser moved to Los Angeles in 2009 to pursue his dreams full time, and a decade later he’s the star of a major motion picture.\n\nCasting director Geoff Mickey showed Eastwood a photo of Hauser next to a photo of the real Jewell and producers reminded the filmmaker of Hauser’s previous work.\n\n“He had a gut instinct to cast me, without even making me audition,” Hauser said of Eastwood.\n\nHauser knew nothing about Jewell’s story, but he learned he was “razor-sharp” and was proficient in law enforcement.\n\n“I realized that there were many misconceptions regarding Richard being called dimwitted and silly,” said Hauser.\n\nThe real Jewell died in 2007. Before his death, he was formally cleared of any wrongdoing and eventually was praised by local Georgia government officials for his heroism. In 2005, Eric R. Rudolph, a North Carolina man who became a suspect in the subsequent bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, pleaded guilty to the Olympic park bombing. He is serving a life sentence.\n\nHauser starring in “Richard Jewell” is his biggest role yet, but life still hasn’t changed that much, according to him.\n\nHe said the best part of being cast in the movie has been getting to know his collaborators and becoming friends with Sam Rockwell, who plays Watson Bryant, a friend of Jewell’s and a lawyer.\n\n“The other night I was having drinks with Sam and we had an impromptu dance-off in front of like 30 people at a club in NYC,” said Hauser. “Nights like that, I still pinch myself.”\n\nNext up, the actor has roles in Spike Lee’s film “Da 5 Bloods” and Disney’s “Cruella,” opposite Emma Stone.\n\nHauser draws his inspiration for his craft from so many things but he credits his relationship with God as having the most impact.\n\n“This career could go away any minute, but my relationship with Jesus isn’t going anywhere,\" he said.\n\nRelated news:\n\nSaginaw man starring in ‘I, Tonya’ ‘took every opportunity until it happened’\n\nSaginaw native Brian d’Arcy James and ‘Something Rotten’ in Tony Awards race"
