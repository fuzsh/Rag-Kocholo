He has been mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nI thought I might die. But then I thought, 'Other people have made it through these things before'. I kept my eyes on the lights on shore and kept swimming.\n\nOn surviving a plane crash in 1951\n\nZmijewsky, Boris; Lee Pfeiffer (1982). The Films of Clint Eastwood. p. 16.

If you make a mistake one week, you can look at it and say, 'Well, I won't do that again,' and you're still on the air next week.\n\nOn Rawhide's impact on his beginning acting career\n\nZmijewsky, Boris; Lee Pfeiffer (1982). The Films of Clint Eastwood. p. 20. Secaucus, New Jersey: Citadel Press. ISBN 0806508639.\n\nThere's only one way to have a happy marriage and as soon as I learn what it is I'll get married again.\n\nReported in Investor's Business Daily (April 9, 2001), A-4.\n\nI've actually had people come up to me and ask me to autograph their guns.\n\nReported in Leslie Halliwell, John Walker, Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies (2003), p. 149.\n\nWith that kind of money, I could have invaded some country.\n\nOn the $31 million cost of making a film\n\n\"Figures and quotes\", Bristol Evening Post (June 19, 2007), p. 36.\n\nEverybody wonders why I continue working at this stage.

[DVD]. Warner Home Video. June 1, 2010. Event occurs at 1:26:15.\n\nIn recent times it just seems that women have been relegated to either romantic roles or fluff pieces. So the appeal, for me, is to make a picture about a real woman.\n\nMaher, Kevin, \"Clint Eastwood the bashful legend: somebody stop me,\" Times Online, (2008-11-13).\n\nI never thought it was a good idea for attorneys to be president, anyway. ... I think it is maybe time -- what do you think -- for maybe a businessman. How about that? A stellar businessman.\n\nSpeech at the Republican National Convention on August 30, 2012 (transcript)\n\n[...] secretly everybody's getting tired of political correctness, kissing up. That's the kiss-ass generation we're in right now. We're really in a pussy generation. Everybody's walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff.\n\nMichael Hainey, Clint and Scott Eastwood: No Holds Barred in Their First Interview Together, Esquire.com, Aug 3, 2016.\n\nClint: The Life and Legend (1999)\n\n[edit]\n\nMcGilligan, Patrick (1999). Clint: The Life and Legend. London: Harper Collins. ISBN 0006383548.\n\n'Don't just do something, stand there.' Gary Cooper wasn't afraid to do nothing.\n\nIn the first part, Eastwood was reportedly quoting a favored instruction from acting coach Jack Kosslyn.\n\np. 112.\n\nI wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement. It was just the kind of character I had envisioned for a long time, keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past. It came about after the frustration of doing Rawhide for so long. I felt the less he said the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audience.\n\nOn playing the Man With No Name character\n\np. 133.\n\nDustin Hoffman and Al Pacino play losers very well. But my audience like to be in there vicariously with a winner. That isn't always popular with critics. My characters have sensitivity and vulnerabilities, but they're still winners. I don't pretend to understand losers. When I read a script about a loser I think of people in life who are losers and they seem to want it that way. It's a compulsive philosophy with them. Winners tell themselves, I'm as bright as the next person. I can do it. Nothing can stop me.\n\nOn his role in The Beguiled\n\np. 189.\n\nWesterns. A period gone by, the pioneer, the loner operating by himself, without benefit of society. It usually has something to do with some sort of vengeance; he takes care of the vengeance himself, doesn't call the police. Like Robin Hood. It's the last masculine frontier. Romantic myth. I guess, though it's hard to think about anything romantic today. In a Western you can think, Jesus, there was a time when man was alone, on horseback, out there where man hasn't spoiled the land yet.\n\np. 217.\n\nAbout Clint Eastwood\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is one politician who doesn't have ambitions to leave Carmel.\n\n\"1986: Eastwood voted mayor by landslide,\" BBC: On This Day-8 April.\n\nThe roles that Eastwood has played, and the films that he has directed, cannot be disentangled from the nature of the American culture of the last quarter century, its fantasies and its realities.\n\nAuthor Edward Gallafent, commenting on Eastwood's impact on film from the 1970s to 1990s\n\nGallafent, Edward (1994). Clint Eastwood. p. 10. New York: Continuum. ISBN 0826406653.\n\nLazy, and would cost you a morning. I never started a day with Clint Eastwood in the first scene, because you knew he was gonna be late, at least a half hour or an hour.\n\nRawhide director Thomas Carr on Eastwood\n\nMcGilligan, Patrick (1999). Clint: The Life and Legend. p. 111. London: Harper Collins. ISBN 0006383548.\n\nAt that time I needed a mask rather than an actor, and Eastwood had only two facial expressions: one with the hat and one without it.\n\nSergio Leone\n\nFrom: Mininni, Francesco (1988), Intervista: Sergio Leone, Cinema del Silenzo (see also, The Guardian)\n\nIt could be that today's conservative movement remains in thrall to the same narrative that has defined its attitude toward film and the arts for decades. Inspired by feelings of exclusion after Hollywood and the popular culture turned leftward in the '60s and '70s, this narrative has defined the film industry as an irredeemably liberal institution toward which conservatives can only act in opposition—never engagement. Ironically, this narrative ignores the actual history of Hollywood, in which conservatives had a strong presence from the industry's founding in the early 20th century up through the '40s, '50s and into the mid-'60s]. The conservative Hollywood community at that time included such leading directors as Howard Hawks, Frank Capra, and Cecil B. DeMille, and major stars like John Wayne, Clark Gable, and Charlton Heston. These talents often worked side by side with notable Hollywood liberals like directors Billy Wilder, William Wyler, and John Huston, and stars like Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, and Spencer Tracy. The richness of classic Hollywood cinema is widely regarded as a testament to the ability of these two communities to work together, regardless of political differences. As the younger, more left-leaning \"New Hollywood\" generation swept into the industry in the late '60s and '70s, this older group of Hollywood conservatives faded away, never to be replaced. Except for a brief period in the '80s when the Reagan Presidency led to a conservative reengagement with film—with popular stars like Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone, and Arnold Schwarzenegger making macho, patriotic action films—conservatives appeared to abandon popular culture altogether. In the wake of this retreat, conservative failure to engage with Hollywood now appears to have been recast by today's East Coast conservative establishment into a generalized opposition toward film and popular culture itself. In the early '90s, conservative film critic Michael Medved codified this oppositional feeling toward Hollywood in his best-selling book Hollywood vs. America.\n\nGovindini Murty, “Hey, Conservatives: It's Safe to Go to the Movies Again”, The Atlantic, (Oct. 12, 2011).\n\nHe just made my day. What a guy.\n\nMitt Romney on Eastwood's endorsement of him in the 2012 United States presidential election.\n\nSource: Access Hollywood.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCategory:Clint Eastwood films\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nClint Eastwood on IMDb"
