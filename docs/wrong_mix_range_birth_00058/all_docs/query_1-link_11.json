        "text": "Sondra Locke, the actress, who has died aged 74, was nominated for an Oscar for her first screen role in The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (1968), but she became most associated both professionally and personally with Clint Eastwood; the break-up of their long relationship in 1989 led to her fighting a bitter legal battle against both the star and his favoured studio, Warner Bros, which she detailed in a much-publicised memoir.\n\nPetite in stature and appearing younger than her years, Sondra Locke was 23 when she won a nationwide search by Warners for an unknown actress to play teenager Mick Kelly in its adaptation of Carson McCullers’s novel.\n\nOpposite Alan Arkin as the tragic deaf-mute John Singer, Sondra Locke’s performance led her to be nominated for two Golden Globes as well as the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThereafter her movie career stuttered, and later she reflected that she had learnt that winning roles depended on more than talent or being the best person for the part. After appearances in Willard (1971), a film about killer rats, and in television series such as Planet of the Apes, as well as reluctantly in a semi-clad spread for Playboy, she jumped at the chance of a role as Eastwood’s romantic interest in The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976).\n\nHaving fallen for each other, the two soon moved in together, albeit their personal circumstances were not straightforward. Eastwood, known as an ardent admirer of womankind, was separated but not divorced from his first wife, Maggie.\n\nSondra Locke, meanwhile, had since 1967 been married to Gordon Anderson, a childhood friend and sculptor, though he was homosexual and she described their relationship as being essentially fraternal.\n\nOver the next decade, Sondra Locke worked mostly on projects involving Eastwood, and appeared in six films with him. These included Every Which Way but Loose – the one with the orang-utan – in which she played a country singer and which was the second-highest grossing release of 1978.\n\nShe also featured in its sequel, Any Which Way You Can, the circus-set Bronco Billy (as a child she had been inspired by De Mille’s The Greatest Show on Earth) and Sudden Impact, one of Eastwood’s Dirty Harry series, as well as The Gauntlet, in which Eastwood’s down-and-out cop escorts a prostitute played by Sondra Locke to testify against the Mob.\n\nAmong a handful of roles of her own were playing Rosemary Clooney in a television biopic and, somewhat improbably, starring in 1984 in an episode for ITV of Tales of the Unexpected.\n\nAware that in her mid-forties she was going to find parts harder to come by, Sondra Locke began to aspire to direct, having watched Eastwood take the same path. She was an admirer in particular of European auteurs such as Max Ophüls and Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\nHer fantasy Ratboy (1986) did little business in America but rather better in Europe, and in 1989 she began work on the psychological thriller Impulse, starring Theresa Russell.\n\nBy then, she and Eastwood had split up after 14 years together. Reportedly, she fainted on set when Anderson read out to her over the telephone a lawyers’ letter demanding she leave the house she believed was hers. She discovered that Eastwood had fathered two children with another woman, although Sondra Locke had undergone a sterilisation procedure after having had two abortions early in her relationship with the star.\n\nHaving sued Eastwood for palimony, she settled with him in 1990, by which time she was suffering from breast cancer, necessitating a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. Part of the deal included a house for Anderson, and Sondra Locke having a three-year directing contract with Warners (which then made all Eastwood’s films).\n\nDespite the risks, she became determined to expose this – and, she later said, a less attractive side of Eastwood than customarily seen on screen. She herself believed that he had felt his authority as a man challenged when she began to seek directing work for herself.\n\nIn the mid- and late-1990s both Eastwood and Warners settled multi-million dollar suits she had brought against them shortly before juries were due to give their verdicts, and in 1997 a triumphant Sondra Locke published her version of events as The Good, the Bad and the Very Ugly.\n\nShe was born Sandra Louise Smith in Madison, Alabama, on May 28 1944. Her father, who abandoned her mother Pauline, a pencil factory worker, before the birth, was in the army.\n\nBy a short marriage, Pauline then had a son, before marrying, secondly, Alfred Locke in 1948. He owned a building firm and Sandra grew up in Shelbyville, Tennessee; she would later change the spelling of her first name as she disliked being called “Sandy”.\n\nA studious child – she and Gordon Anderson bonded over a love of Tolkien, and her favourite authors included J P Donleavy and Iris Murdoch – she briefly read Drama at university before leaving home and finding work at a television station.\n\nShe had worked only intermittently in recent decades, though earlier this year she was seen in Ray Meets Helen, with Keith Carradine.\n\nShe and Anderson never divorced, and he survives her.\n\nSondra Locke, born May 28 1944, died November 3 2018"
