        "text": "In what’s shaping up as one of the most-talked-about movie projects in recent memory, Clint Eastwood is reportedly about to tackle yet another remake of the musical “A Star Is Born,” with Beyoncé as the star.\n\nThis would be the fourth incarnation of the film, which has starred Janet Gaynor and Fredric March (1936), Judy Garland and James Mason (1954) and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson (1976).\n\nEastwood is currently at work on his J. Edgar Hoover biopic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and has not commented on the “Star Is Born” remake, which he would direct. But Will Fetters is writing the script and Basil Iwanyk and Jon Peters have been brought in as producers, so the project seems to be a go.\n\nNo word on whom the male lead will be.\n\nANOTHER INTERESTING MOVIE IDEA: Josephson Entertainment and Michelle Krumm Productions have announced plans for a big-screen adaptation of Andrew Fowler’s upcoming biography of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, “The Most Dangerous Man in the World.”\n\nThe Australian reporter’s book, to be released later this year, will focus on more than WikiLeaks and its most famous cases, offering an extensive look at Assange’s life from childhood on.\n\nJosephson Entertainment, clearly hoping this will become the next “Social Network,” said the project “is this generation’s suspenseful drama with global impact.”\n\nOPRAH LANDS FIRST LADY “…: Michelle Obama is going on “The Oprah Winfrey Show.”\n\nThe White House has confirmed the first lady is returning to her Chicago hometown Friday to tape one of the last original episodes of Winfrey’s nationally syndicated talk show.\n\nIn what has become her latest drive, Obama will discuss plans to launch a nationwide campaign to support families with someone in the military. The first lady has traveled to military installations to talk with service members about their needs and concerns and has urged Americans to volunteer time to help them.\n\n“…AND PROMISES A SHOCKER: Meanwhile, the Divine Ms. O says her show Monday will include a blockbuster personal revelation:\n\nShe really hates Dr. Phil.\n\nHo, ho, a little self-help-guru humor; we’re sure she just adores the lovable old windbag. But as for Monday, she says, “I was given some news that literally shook me to my core. This time, I’m the one being reunited. I was keeping a family secret for months, and on Monday you’re going to hear it straight from me.”\n\nShe offered no other details. Winfrey was born to unwed teens, was raised by various family members and had a baby who died. “I thought I’d seen it all,” Winfrey continues. “But this, my friends, is the miracle of all miracles.”\n\nWHEN REALITY SHOWS COLLIDE: Kim Kardashian, usually known for commenting on such weighty matters as her clothes, cosmetics and the unmistakable awesomeness of her world and anything she decides to spend money on, is embroiled in a smackdown of sorts with some actual substance to it.\n\nEarlier this week, Kardashian trashed the reality series “Teen Mom,” decrying — bless her heart — that “it seems that shows like ‘Teen Mom’ are all of a sudden making teen pregnancy seem cool in the eyes of young girls “…. Having a baby so young shouldn’t be seen as the trendy thing to do.”\n\nOne of the “Teen Mom” cast members has fired back.\n\n“Last time I checked, Kim Kardashian had a sex tape floating around on the Internet and I’m pretty sure she made a lot of money off of it,” Amber Portwood told E! News. “She made a sex tape when she was younger and she wants to bash the girls on ‘Teen Mom’?”\n\nCORRECTION: An Associated Press report that appeared in the People Column on Friday incorrectly said that Sacha Baron Cohen would play Saddam Hussein in a new movie.\n\nWhat’s really true is that Baron Cohen, the actor and writer who brought us the “Borat” and “Bruno” movies, will be adapting Hussein’s novel “Zabibah and the King” for the big screen in 2012. And also will be in the starring role. The film is titled “The Dictator.”"
