        "text": "November is one of the most interesting months of the year to visit Spain. Temperatures are still mostly mild, particularly at the start of the month when the country often experiences “St. Martin’s summer”, which is a late burst of unseasonal summer heat.\n\nBetter yet, by November even the last of shoulder season visitors have usually departed, and you’ll see prices fall off the face of a cliff (in a good way!).\n\nWith fall leaves embellishing landscapes with autumnal reds, golds, and browns, prices at their lowest, scant a visitor around, and all of Spain back in familiar rhythms, a November visit is a surprisingly lovely choice.\n\nNature certainly steals the show in the fall with brightly colored deciduous forests in the mountains, fiery red and orange fields of grapes, and striking contrasts of greens and brown in the olive groves. However, many cities also look especially beautiful, with leafy avenues and soft, golden light falling over stone architectural masterpieces.\n\nThe north of Spain provides the best contrasts and colors, but it will also be colder and rain will be unavoidable. The south, more muted in its fall display, will stay warmer and give you fewer rainy days and chilly nights.\n\nAnd remember, while November air temperatures might make the thought of swimming unappealing, in Andalusia water temperatures are actually at their hottest of the year.\n\nHikers especially can enjoy November as the cooler temperatures mean even midday hikes are comfortable, and the scenery is simply divine. Up in the mountains of the Pyrenees, medieval villages look their most atmospheric of any season.\n\nAnd of course, as in almost every month of the year in Spain, November offers a host of festivals and local events to enjoy.\n\nMore Spain travel info:\n\nFor more info on Spain, check out our guide on how to plan a trip to Spain and our 2-Week Spain itinerary.\n\nIf you could use some one-on-one help planning your itinerary, schedule a Spain travel consultation with one of our Local Experts!\n\nGuide to the Basque Country\n\nGuide to Andalusia\n\nNorthern Spain travel guide\n\nSpain’s 17 autonomous communities\n\n16 beautiful places in Spain\n\nLocal guide to the Costa Brava\n\nCity guide to San Sebastian\n\nCity guide to Bilbao\n\nWeather\n\nAlthough not a huge country, Spain has great climate variability. Northern Spain in November is bound to be chilly and rainy, especially in Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, and Basque Country.\n\nMeanwhile, Andalusia and other Southern regions usually have cool early mornings that rise to pleasant temperatures by mid morning and “ditch that sweater” temperatures by midday.\n\nSpain’s weather in November varies tremendously from one region to another. While November is a rainy month overall, it can be warm and dry or cold and wet depending on where you are.\n\nThe countrywide average temperature is about 60°F by day and 45°F at night. However, there’s little point discussing average countrywide temperatures as it’s too variable by region.\n\nIn the north, in Basque Country for example, the average daytime temperature for November is 55ºF (13ºC), and you can expect at least 13 days of rain. It’s not a season in which forgetting your raincoat will be a happy mistake…\n\nIn Madrid, the average temperature hovers around 53ºF (12º C), but nighttime temperatures often fall below 40ºF. A normal November in the Spanish capital sees 6-8 days of rain.\n\nIn Barcelona and Catalonia, daytime temperatures are almost 5-10 degrees warmer than in Madrid, but the even bigger difference is that temperatures barely drop overnight. As such, your days will warm and you won’t find yourself shivering during your post-dinner stroll.\n\nIn Andalusia and the Valencian coast things stay much more civilized and you can expect an average daily temperature of about 62ºF with nights dropping into the high 40s. Daily ranges are about 47 – 67ºF (8-19ºC).\n\nIn early November, it’s not unheard of to get the occasional break above 80ºF and days are sunny and clear with an average of just 3 days of rain in the month. If you’re headed to Andalusia, you’re better off packing a bathing suit than an umbrella!\n\nEvents\n\nAs with most months of the year, November offers you the chance to enjoy all kinds of events and gastronomic festivals in Spain. I’ve selected a few of the many to give you some starters on November fiestas.\n\nGijón International Film Festival - The Gijón International Film Festival, one of the most important in Spain, usually takes place in November. Over the years, it has gained more and more international prestige and is now a well-respected event.\n\nAside from the film productions included in the competition and their associated showings and events, Gijón is a gorgeous northern city to visit and there are many cultural activities such as exhibitions, concerts, and book presentations that occur alongside the film festival.\n\nOlive & olive oil celebration in Baena (Cordoba) - During the month of November, the village of Baena, in the southern province of Córdoba, celebrates their chief product (olive oil) during 3 days in the annual Las Jornadas del Olivar y el Aceite festival.\n\nDuring the event, there are sessions dedicated to locally produced olive oil, which is regarded as one of the best in the world. There are tasting sessions and a host of activities - from classes and workshops to music and folklore - which attract visitors from all over Spain and other countries.\n\nWhile not related to the festival, if you wind up here, don’t forget that the best Iberian ham is produced in Andalusia, and makes for the perfect combination with a piece of toast drizzled with Baena olive oil.\n\nAll Saint’s Fair at Cocentaina (Region of Valencia) - The small town of Cocentaina, in the Levante region (near Valencia & Alicante), has hosted this agricultural fair for more than 600 years. Every year it takes place at the same time as Dia de Todos los Santos (All Saint’s Day in English or Fira de Tot Sants in Catalan/Valencian) in the first week of November.\n\nAlthough it started as a simple regional cattle fair (and that is still a major component of it), it has since transformed into a major attraction and you can find a wide range of cultural activities including horseback riding, traditional medieval dress and armor displays, crafts workshops, choral competitions, and more.\n\nThe festival has a definitive medieval bent that accompanies the agricultural focus. This is no longer just a small regional fair though and attendance has steadily climbed to now routinely hit over 350,000 spectators/visitors - it’s a pretty good party.\n\nThe Humanitarians Festival in Asturias - Asturias, a small coastal region in the north of Spain, combines charming villages with possibly the best cuisine in Spain. Every year, on November 11, the village of Aller celebrates a popular autumn festival known as the Humanitarians Festival (Fiesta de los Humanitarios) which is organized by the San Martín Humanitarian Association.\n\nA religious festival, the event starts with a Catholic mass that is sung and accompanied by traditional Asturian bagpipes. After, there’s an auction where faithful bid on a special type of bread that is blessed during the mass. Later in the day, a large procession passes through town with locals in traditional regional dress and lots more bagpipe playing.\n\nAt the end of the day, visitors and participants are rewarded with a feast whose primary dish is fabada, a white bean stew typical of Asturias.\n\nMadrid Jazz Festival - JazzMadrid brings together Spain’s best Jazz musicians with artists and acts from all over the world. The event lasts for almost all of November (2-27) and there are performances and shows throughout the city. Although Jazz is obviously the focus, you can also find Blues, Swing, and other genres too.\n\nMadrid Horse Week - Not typically of interest to the average visitor (or Spaniard), it’s still worth noting that from the 24th to 26th of November Madrid hosts the country’s biggest equestrian festival. There are competitions in showjumping, vaulting, reining, and lots of other horse-related sports and activities as well as exhibitions and plenty of activities for kids.\n\nIt probably won’t be something most visitors plan their stay in Madrid around, but if you happen to be in the capital and have even a passing interest, it’s a neat event."
