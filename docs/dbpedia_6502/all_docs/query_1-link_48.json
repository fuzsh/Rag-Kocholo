        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI'm committed to start the VDLP on12th or 13th of May.I will be arriving in Seville on the 10th and taking a couple of days of rest and sight seeing, which I will sorely need after flying direct from New Zealand. I'm a bit worried that I left my starting date a bit late in the year because of the possible heat and that there might not be other pilgrims on the track. Also I heard it talked about that the auberges might close during summer break in Spain. Any insides are appreciated, I'm in my 60s and female traveling on my own.\n\nCheers Elke\n\nI walked the VdlP last year starting in Seville on April 24th and it was already very hot ( and I’m from Australia so used to the heat ).\n\nMy tips would be to be prepared for pre dawn starts and to finish walking by early afternoon.\n\nTake lots of water and I used a sun umbrella which helped.\n\nUnfortunately I sustained an injury and stopped in Zamora and am now planning to return, possibly in June, although I’m a little concerned about hot weather then.\n\nThere were a few other pilgrims each day but certainly not many.\n\nBuen camino\n\nI started late March last year and it was getting warm by late April. 28C by late afternoon.\n\nJust be sensible. I'm sure you'll be fine.\n\nIt's possible to walk shorter days in many cases. Though walking the VdlP is a bit like a chess game, as you need to think a few moves / days ahead to plan your distances and likely stopping places.\n\nI walked days that varied from 10 kms to 27 kms. The 27 kms (from Villafranca de los Barros to Torremejia) was hard to make any shorter, but it's not a hard day. Lovely walking track and dead flat! Just start very early to avoid the heat.\n\nTake care to monitor your hydration levels. If you are not sure how to check just google it. Dehydration urine colour! Not drinking enough water is an easy trap to fall into. Leads to sore feet, joints etc.\n\nStart well hydrated...before you start walking.\n\nYou will need a carry a fair bit of water. It is rare to be able to refill during the day unless you are passing through the larger villages/towns. Most days I carried 2 litres. on warm or longer days more. You'll soon get used to your water consumption. Mine is fairly constant at 10 kms / litre. But I need a bit more water above 30C.\n\nPre dawn starts are your friend! Most of the time you are on excellent tracks, and with a good headlamp, walking in the dark is easy. My routine start time became 30 mins before dawn. Hearing the animals and birds waking up and watching the dawn was truly amazing. I never appreciated why people started early. The main benefit of course, is that it's Cool! The hottest part of the day seemed to be 3-5 pm. So I aimed to finish by 2 pm. In time for a menu del dia!\n\nIt's worth reading about dawn v sun rise. Most weather apps will tell you the time of sun rise.\n\nBut dawn, is well before that, before the sun even appears.\n\nYou'll be able to walk with a head torch from about 60 minutes before sunrise for example. Or earlier if you like.\n\nStarting an hour before sunrise, means you are only using your head torch for about 30 minutes.\n\nI hope that makes sense.\n\nHere's an example. Merida in May.\n\nSunrise and sunset times in Mérida, May 2024\n\nCalculations of sunrise and sunset in Mérida – Badajoz – Spain for May 2024. Generic astronomy calculator to calculate times for sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset for many cities, with daylight saving time and time zones taken in account.\n\nSunrise is at 7:27 am. But you might start well before that. As the sun comes up, the temperature starts to rise modestly till about 11 am, then it seems, more quickly to the peak part of the day.\n\nNautical Twilight as at 6:23 am. You can just make out the horizon.\n\nCivil Twilight is at 6:58 am. It's plenty of light for walking without a head torch.\n\nIn this scenario, I would probably start walking at 6:15 am.\n\nI might need my head torch for 30 minutes.\n\nOf course you could start earlier, but then you are in the dark longer and missing the scenery.\n\nBut of course if the local bar opens for breakfast at 6:30 am, that throws out the whole thing!!\n\nYour call.\n\nThe hottest part of the day is a bit counter intuitive.\n\nIn that link, you will see a reference to 'Solar Noon'. This is when the sun is at it's highest.\n\nIn this case it's 2:22 pm.\n\nI seem to recall the hottest part of the day is a bit later than that (2 hours or so).\n\nMaybe a Meteorologist will come along and explain why that is........\n\nLastly.......\n\nI know that there is often debate about electrolytes and similar. But I think it's important to maintain salt levels in hot weather. Salty foods etc should suffice. But on the VdlP I actually took electrolyte tablets. (Salt Sticks). Hardly a scientific study, but I didn't suffer from energy loss and tired muscles as much as I used to.\n\nHi Gerald,\n\nsorry for not being precise I'm from NZ and have done plenty of multi day hikes , in NZ you carry all your gear and have to be prepared for all weather but not 40 degrees . Also I have done some High altitude hiking in the Himalayas , so I got some experience.\n\nCheers Elke\n\nThe Mean daily maximum °C in Seville in May is 27.8, in June it's 32.4. So, second half of May it isn't unusual to have temperature in the mid 30s. You'll be walking in Extremadura in June, long stages, little shade and temperature in the mid 30s not unusual up to Salamanca.\n\nI wouldn't start from Seville in May. For me personally I know I wouldn't enjoy it. So I would encourage you to consider your options and think about walking one of the Caminos in the north of Spain. A lot of people drop out of the Via before Merida because it's a lot harder than they were expecting. And that's an option too, from Merida there are trains to Madrid and from there it's easy to get to points on the Camino Frances.\n\nAnyway, whatever you chose, Buen Camino!"
