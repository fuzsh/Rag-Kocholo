For visitors in May, we suggest visiting Madrid, Barcelona, Santiago de Compostela, and Cordoba. Read on to find out more about travel and weather, including temperatures, rainfall, humidity, and tips for May.\n\nContent Preview\n\n1. Weather Overview\n\n2. Best Places to Visit\n\n3. Crowds and Costs\n\n4. What to Wear\n\nSpain Weather in May: Overview\n\nAverages:\n\nTemperature range: 14â24Â°C (58â75Â°F)\n\nRainfall: 4 cm (2 inches)\n\nRainy days: 6\n\nSunshine hours/day: 9\n\nHumidity: around 75% (comfortable in Madrid, more humid in Barcelona)\n\nMay is mild to warm in Spain, with higher temperatures in Seville and the rest of the south of the country, and milder but pleasant temperatures in the north of the country. TheÂ averageÂ temperature range is 14â24Â°C (58â75Â°F), and the days are long with plenty of sunshine, averaging 9 hours per day. This makes May a great time of the year to visit.\n\nThere is a little bit of rainfall in May, typically around 4 cm (or 2 inches), across 6 days of the month. This leads to slightly higher humidity levels in cities like Barcelona, but in general the conditions are comfortable.\n\nMay Climate Comparison (Averages) for Spain's Top Tourism Areas\n\nThe Best Places to Visit in Spain in May\n\nMay is a beautiful month in which to visit Spain, before the summer rush and before the higher temperatures of the peak summer season in July and August. The days are long and temperatures range between mild and warm, ideal for walking around and exploring. During this month, all of Spain is great to visit, but we've pointed out a few specific destinations worth a mention.\n\nIf you need more help putting together your ideal trip in Spain, reach out to our team of Spain experts who can help you put together the perfect itinerary for your trip to Spain. Whether you're going for the history, the architecture, the food, or the local festivals, our experts can help you tailor your experience. Contact us to start planning your Spain trip.\n\n1. Watch a Bullfight in Madrid and Visit Las Ventas\n\nMadrid is home to Las Ventas, the largest bullfighting ring in Spain, located in Madrid's Salamanca district. It was inaugurated in 1931, and fits over 23,000 people, making it the third-largest bullfighting ring in the world.\n\nThe stadium itself is fascinating, as it was built in a Moorish and Neo-MudÃ©jar style, and has a dark history,Â as it was also used as a concentration camp during Franco's fascist reign. We recommend visiting on a tour, and if you are interested, May is when many bullfights are held, so it is worth getting a ticket to watch one of them at the stadium.\n\nBullfighting is deeply rooted in Spain's culture, and while it is worth researching a little more thoroughly to ensure you're up for watching it, many festivals and celebrations incorporate the fights.\n\nFor more information about other activities to do in Madrid including the museums, the Royal Palace, and going out for tapas, check out visiting Spain in March and April.\n\n2. Take a Walking Tour of Barcelona's GaudÃ­ Legacy\n\nYou will undoubtedly have heard of the incredible structures designed by architect GaudÃ­ in Barcelona. He was born near Barcelona in 1852, and between then and his passing in 1926, he worked on beautiful projects that attract millions of visitors each year, some of which are still in progress.\n\nWe suggest spending some time in Barcelona and walking around the highlights, including, of course, the Sagrada Familia, a beautiful Catholic Church that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, also where GaudÃ­ was buried. The church is built in an Art Nouveau style, but taken far beyond its usual application, with beautiful spires decorated inside and out.\n\nAfterwards, head on over to see GaudÃ­'s work at PlaÃ§a Real, Palau GÃ¼ell, the Block of Discord, Casa BattlÃ³, and Casa MilÃ , the latter being a beautiful private residence with twisting balconies and an incredible terrace. We recommend visiting inside too.\n\n3. Hike around Santiago de Compostela to Experience (Part of) the Camino de Santiago\n\nThe Camino de Santiago is perhaps one of the most famous hikes in the world, with the entire route in Spain taking around 30 days from start to finish. While there areÂ a large number of routes between Portugal, Spain, France, and even into the rest of Europe that are all part of the network, these pilgrims' paths historically lead to Santiago de Compostela on Spain's northwestern coast, where apostle Saint James the Great's remains are allegedly buried in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela.\n\nWe highly recommend for avid hikers to join in for some of the route, as the views are beautiful, there is lots to see on the way, and the hike is often still seen as a spiritual path. You don't have to do the entire 30 days, and Global Highlights can help you plan some of your trip if you are interested. Contact Global Highlights for more information. May's weather is perfect for it!\n\nAfterwards, admire the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela and its Romanesque facade with Gothic and Baroque additions, and sample some local dishes at one of the many surrounding restaurants. We highly recommend trying the traditional boiled octopus dish with paprika, as well as the empanadas and almond cake for dessert.\n\n4. Be Wowed by Flower Structures in Cordoba During Cruces de Mayo\n\nIn the first few days of May (usually around May 3), people in Andalucia celebrate the Festival of the May Crosses, or Cruces de Mayo. Cordoba and Granada are two of the cities where the most impressive flower crosses are on display, making it worth visiting Cordoba (or Granada) if you are in Spain at this time.\n\nThe best neighborhood to see the beautiful flower constructions in Cordoba are San Basilio, Santa Marina, and San Augustin.\n\nWe also recommend visiting the Mezquita Cathedral de Cordoba, a Roman Catholic Church which was once a mosque, where you can see how its architectural style was changed multiple times over the years, as its main function changed. Cordoba also has an interesting Jewish Quarter with wonderful restaurants, and the beautiful Palace of Viana.\n\nBetween May 2 and 12, Cordoba also holds a courtyard decorating competition, which you'll be able to enjoy while walking around the old city, and between May 25 and June 1 Cordoba is also home to a spring fair. With plenty to see even on a regular day, Cordoba is an even better choice to visit in May.\n\nCrowds and Costs for Traveling in May\n\nMay is typically low season in Spain, as tourists are more plentiful during the summer months. This means that you might be able to get lower priced accommodation and transportation during this time. However, given that Spain is home to so many incredible attractions, and the weather is great, we do still suggest planning ahead.\n\nThere are a few festivals in Spain in May, including Cruces de Mayo as described above. Spain also celebrates Labor Day on May 1, during which some restaurants and museums might be closed. We recommend calling ahead or asking your hotel to confirm before heading out.\n\nMay 2 is Madrid Day, or Dos de Mayo, which is celebrated in Madrid with fireworks, closures in the city, and street parties. It's a fun time to be in Madrid, but we do recommend planning ahead as there can be some street closures, too.\n\nWhat to Wear in May\n\nSpain's weather is mostly dry and mild to warm in May, and as a result we would recommend wearing light clothing but bringing a jacket or a jumper for the evenings and cooler days, as there is always a chance that the temperature will drop a bit, particularly in the north of the country.\n\nSince you will likely be walking around a lot to see all the incredible sights, we suggest bringing supportive footwear, and wearing sunscreen as well as sunglasses or a hat to protect against the sun."
