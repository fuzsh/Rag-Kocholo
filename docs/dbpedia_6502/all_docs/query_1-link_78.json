Have a look below!\n\nFind Places To Stay In Madrid, Spain\n\nWeather in Madrid\n\nMadrid has a Mediterranean climate and its high altitude (2,188 ft above sea level) and distance from the moderating effect of the sea, means that temperatures vary from season to season.\n\nWinters are cold and mostly sunny, but rain, sporadic snowfalls, and frosts can occur between December and February. Summers are hot, dry, and mostly clear, with temperatures peaking at around 32ºC during the warmest month, July.\n\nMadrid, alongside Athens, is the driest capital in Europe, meaning rainfall is limited throughout the year.
