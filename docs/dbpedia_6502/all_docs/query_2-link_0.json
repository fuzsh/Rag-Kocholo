In Salamanca, the chance of a wet day over the course of January is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 18% and ending it at 14%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 23% on October 30, and its lowest chance is 5% on July 30.\n\nOver the course of January in Salamanca, the chance of a day with only rain decreases from 17% to 14%, the chance of a day with mixed snow and rain remains an essentially constant 1% throughout, and the chance of a day with only snow remains an essentially constant 0% throughout.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during January in Salamanca is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 1.2 inches, when it rarely exceeds 3.1 inches, and ending the month at 0.8 inches, when it rarely exceeds 1.7 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of January in Salamanca, the length of the day is increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 46 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 1 minute, 31 seconds, and weekly increase of 10 minutes, 40 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is January 1, with 9 hours, 17 minutes of daylight and the longest day is January 31, with 10 hours, 3 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Salamanca is 8:47 AM on January 5 and the earliest sunrise is 13 minutes earlier at 8:34 AM on January 31.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:04 PM on January 1 and the latest sunset is 33 minutes later at 6:37 PM on January 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Salamanca during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during January, so the entire month is in daylight saving time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 6:50 AM and sets 15 hours, 7 minutes later, at 9:58 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:44 AM and sets 9 hours, 14 minutes later, at 5:57 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in January in Salamanca\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in January in SalamancaJan112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829293030313112 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMDecFeb001010202020300001010202030\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for January 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Salamanca is essentially constant during January, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 10, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time, while on January 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Salamanca is essentially constant during January, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 9.5 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on April 6, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 10.2 miles per hour, while on August 26, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.9 miles per hour.\n\nThe wind direction in Salamanca during January is predominantly out of the south from January 1 to January 15 and the west from January 15 to January 31.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Salamanca typically lasts for 6.5 months (199 days), from around April 14 to around October 30, rarely starting before March 23 or after May 4, and rarely ending before October 8 or after November 20.\n\nThe month of January in Salamanca is reliably fully outside of the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in January in Salamanca\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Salamanca are essentially constant during January, remaining within 4Â°F of 4Â°F throughout.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Salamanca is gradually increasing during January, rising by 0.7 kWh, from 1.9 kWh to 2.6 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in January in Salamanca\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in January in SalamancaJan11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303031310.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWh4.5 kWh4.5 kWh5.0 kWh5.0 kWhDecFebJan 11.9 kWhJan 11.9 kWhJan 312.6 kWhJan 312.6 kWhJan 112.0 kWhJan 112.0 kWhJan 212.3 kWhJan 212.3 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Salamanca are 40.969 deg latitude, -5.664 deg longitude, and 2,674 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Salamanca contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 331 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 2,648 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (764 feet). Within 50 miles contains significant variations in elevation (6,893 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Salamanca is covered by artificial surfaces (61%) and cropland (34%), within 10 miles by cropland (80%), and within 50 miles by cropland (60%) and trees (16%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Salamanca, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Salamanca.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Salamanca according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Salamanca is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Salamanca and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nSalamanca Airport (LESA, 97%, 9 mi, east, -79 ft elevation change)\n\nBraganca (LPBG, 3.3%, 82 mi, northwest, -410 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Salamanca and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
