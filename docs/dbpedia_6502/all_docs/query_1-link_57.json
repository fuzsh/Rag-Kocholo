        "text": "March marks the onset of spring in Spain and if you pick the right spot you can find some lovely warm spring sunshine, but don’t expect scorching heat. If you like to sunbathe, see where’s really hot in March. You should also consider the Canary Islands in March where the weather is a lot more reliable.\n\nLet’s get back to mainland Spain. For the best of the weather you need to head to the south-west corner of Andalucia. Hottest spot will be the city of Seville, one of the best destinations in Spain for a short break. Expect an average 21ºC and seven hours of daily sunshine in March. Nearby Granada will also be warm and you can explore the majestic sights of the Alhambra without being overwhelmed by crowds.\n\nIf you want beaches, the Costa de la Luz in this corner of Spain is beautiful with sand dunes, fishing ports and historic towns and cities such as Cadiz and El Puerto de Santa Maria. The seafood is especially good in this region.\n\nIt’s a good time to explore the world-class art galleries of Madrid with temperatures of 16ºC and an average six hours of daily sunshine. You can expect similar temperatures in Barcelona with seven hours of sunshine, perfect for checking out the sights, from the Sagrada Familia to the Camp Nou.\n\nAnother option is the Balearic Islands, a different experience to the baking heat of high summer. This is a popular time for walking and cycling in Mallorca and you may see some of the world’s top road cycling teams practising on the hilly roads. Expect temperatures of around 16ºC and six hours of daily sun. The capital Palma is a delightful place to spend a few days.\n\nFind more holiday ideas in Spain, including the best singles holidays in Spain.\n\nHoliday weather in Spain in March\n\nDestination Average highs Average hours of sun Average rainfall (mm) Seville 21°C 7 hours 50 Madrid 16°C 6 hours 38 Barcelona 16°C 6 hours 56 Ibiza 17°C 7 hours 39 Mallorca 16°C 7 hours 42 Tenerife 23°C 7 hours 22 Lanzarote 22°C 8 hours 16 Valencia 18°C 6 hours 39 Bilbao 14°C 5 hours 126 Marbella 19°C 7 hours 62\n\nExtreme March weather in Spain\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Spain in March was 37.3ºC (99.1ºF) in 2012, in the city of Seville.
