The database covered the period between 1992 and 1994 and the precipitation data from 68 meteorological observatories were used. Temporal and spatial scales of 1 month and 102 km2 were considered. Values of rain yield (defined as the ratio of convective precipitation to CG flash count over a common area) were centered around a mean value of ∼108 kilograms per flash (kg fl−1) but varied as a function of the climate regime, increasing from a mean value of 1.2 × 108 kg fl−1 for the semiarid region of the Iberian Peninsula to a mean value of 2.1 × 108 kg fl−1 for the humid region of the Iberian Peninsula. The correlation coefficients between convective precipitation and the CG flash count also varied with the climate regime. The correlation coefficient was higher for the semiarid zone (0.75) than for the humid one (0.65). These variations are physically consistent. Within each climate regime, rain yield (correlation) was lower (higher) in July than in June and August, although this result was probably an effect of convective precipitation, which is inflated by frontal precipitation. To test the stability and correlation associated with these results, a “predicted” convective precipitation for 1994 was calculated using the rain yields of 1992–93. The seasonal correlation coefficient between predicted and gauge-measured precipitation was 0.71.",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nConvective precipitation and lightning activity are two related effects of thunderstorms. While cloud-to-ground lightning flashes are easily counted using lightning detection systems, convective precipitation cannot be measured directly, since rain gauge networks do not distinguish between “stratiform” and “convective” precipitation [Houze (1993), e.g., provides definitions of stratiform and convective precipitation]. Thus, if a relationship between the flash count and convective precipitation can be found, convective precipitation may be readily estimated. There is further interest in lightning–convective precipitation relationships, since their spatial variations may be used as a quantitative indicator of the rainfall regime, as suggested by Zipser (1994) and Petersen and Rutledge (1998).\n\nBoth noninductive (e.g., Reynolds et al. 1957; Saunders et al. 1991) and inductive (e.g., Brooks and Saunders 1994) charging processes have been proposed to explain the electrification of clouds. However, regardless of the charging mechanism, the initiation of lightning seems to be associated with the development of a robust ice phase (e.g., Chauzy et al. 1985; Carey and Rutledge 1996). In fact, numerous observations point to the presence of precipitation-size ice in lightning-producing clouds (e.g., Williams et al. 1989; Petersen et al. 1996). In the summer, a large percentage of convective precipitation in midlatitude continental areas is produced by ice-based process (e.g., Young 1993). Thus, a positive correlation between convective precipitation and lightning could be expected.\n\nThe relationship between convective precipitation and lightning has been calculated in many works (e.g., Battan 1965; Piepgrass and Krider 1982; Williams et al. 1992; Cheze and Sauvageot 1997; Sheridan et al. 1997; Petersen and Rutledge 1998; Tapia et al. 1998; Carey and Rutledge 2000; Grecu et al. 2000). Most of these studies use the “rain yield,” which is defined as the ratio between the convective rain mass and the lightning flash count over a common area [units of kilograms per flash (kg fl−1)]. Another approach was taken by Zipser (1994) and Manohar et al. (1999), who used the rainfall to thunder day ratio to analyze this problem. It is worth mentioning that the majority of previous studies have computed the relationship between convective precipitation and lightning for individual (or ensemble) thunderstorm case studies, reporting that a high positive correlation exists between convective precipitation and lightning, and that rain yield varies by an order of magnitude or more. However, Petersen and Rutledge (1998) adopted another approach, calculating rain yield for long temporal and spatial domains in order to filter cloud-scale variability.\n\nHere we analyze the relationship between convective precipitation and cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning over the Iberian Peninsula during the summer season for 1992–94. We used CG flashes instead of total lightning because the lightning detection network installed on the Iberian Peninsula can only detect CG flashes. However, the link between precipitation on the surface and CG lightning has been reported many times (e.g., Williams et al. 1989; Carey and Rutledge 1996; Petersen et al. 1996; Sheridan et al. 1997; Petersen and Rutledge 1998; Tapia et al. 1998). Cheze and Sauvageot (1997), for example, found on a case-by-case basis that the correlation between CG lightning and rainfall is higher than the correlation between total lightning and rainfall.\n\nConvective activity within the Iberian Peninsula is focused on the warm season: 56% of the total number of CG flashes from 1992 to 1994 were counted from June to August. Our analysis is therefore restricted to the summer season. The same procedure was adopted by Sheridan et al. (1997) and Petersen and Rutledge (1998) in the United States.\n\nIt should be noted that most studies on the relationship between convective precipitation and lightning have been carried out in tropical areas and in the United States, whereas the number of studies relating to other areas, specifically to Europe, is limited.\n\n2. Data and estimation of convective precipitation\n\nThe CG lightning data were obtained from a lightning detection network installed on the Iberian Peninsula that belongs to the Instituto Nacional de Meteorología (Fig. 1). It uses Advanced Lightning Direction Finder (ALDF) model 141-T, manufactured by Lightning Location and Protection Inc. This lightning sensor has been described in depth by several authors (e.g., Orville et al. 1983; Lopez and Holle 1986). The location accuracy of flashes has been analyzed by Martin (1995), who reported maximum error in the flash position lower than 8 km for Spain and between 8 and 11 km for Portugal. Detection efficiency has not yet been estimated. Previous studies (e.g., de Pablo et al. 2000) used an arbitrary detection efficiency of 70%. However, the assumption of 70% uniform flash detection efficiency may be not realistic, especially near the edges of the network. In consequence, no attempt was made to correct for detection efficiency. This may artificially inflate the rain yield on the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula and will be discussed in section 3. Precipitation data were obtained using quality controlled rain gauge data from the Spanish and Portuguese meteorological services. Precipitation data was recorded daily and then summed to yield the monthly data. Here, we considered the rain gauge data of 68 observing stations throughout the Iberian Peninsula (Fig. 2).\n\nIn order to analyze the relationship between convective precipitation and CG lightning, we considered long timescales (1 month) to filter out the cloud-related time variability. We considered the total (both negative and positive) monthly number of CG lightning flashes counted in blocks of 0.1° latitude × 0.1° longitude surrounding each observing station and assumed that precipitation does not change within each block. This is a reasonable assumption owing to the small area associated with each block (∼8.3 km × 11.1 km ≈ 102 km2). Thus, the spatial scale that we considered is approximately the same as the rain gauge data (∼0.5° × 0.5° grid; see Fig. 2). The small spatial domain allowed us to retain the spatial variability associated with the complex orography of the Iberian Peninsula. These temporal and spatial scales are significantly different from those used in most previous works, which considered the relationship between convective precipitation and lightning for individual convective systems. They are also slightly different from the scales used by Petersen and Rutledge (1998) for the continental United States, since in this case long temporal (∼1 month) and large spatial (∼105 km2) scales were used.\n\nThe measured precipitation includes both convective and stratiform rainfall. Accordingly, the data on precipitation must be filtered to remove stratiform precipitation and to ensure that the data only refer to convective precipitation. Since we considered a small spatial scale, the use of an arbitrary precipitation rate to discriminate between stratiform and convective precipitation could be an appropriate scheme. However, the precipitation data in hourly increments were available from so few observing stations that this procedure was impossible. We therefore applied a technique similar to that employed by Petersen and Rutledge (1998). It is worth mentioning here that the scheme used by Petersen and Rutledge (1998) is more appropriate for spatial scales on the order of climate regimes. However, in view of the lack of more exact information, this procedure seems to be reasonable. The procedure we used to remove the stratiform precipitation was as follows: 1) we removed all precipitation data associated with non-CG-flashes and 2) we examined the rain yield values for a given month and block that were threefold (or more) greater than values of surrounding blocks or previous months. Such large values may indicate that convective precipitation is inflated. These values were removed if (a) precipitation was associated to a frontal passage or (b) the number of CG flashes was greatly reduced and surface observations reported little thunder. From a total of 394 monthly data points (i.e., month's data at a rain gauge site), this procedure retained 228 data points. That is, 42% of the total number of data points was eliminated, although this percentage was different for each climate regime. Two climate regimes can be established in the Iberian Peninsula (e.g., Font 1983; García de Pedraza 1994): humid and semiarid (Fig. 2). As expected, the percentage of data points eliminated was higher for the humid zone (56%) than for the semiarid one (35%) since the passage of frontal systems generating nonconvective precipitation is more frequent in the humid zone. It should be noted that this procedure assumes that the majority of warm season convective precipitation is associated with deep convection. However if convection is weakly forced, the cloud will not penetrate to −20°C and lightning does not occur, although precipitation still exhibits the structure attributed to convective precipitation. These events were eliminated from the sample. Moreover, our sample is undoubtedly contaminated by precipitation from cloud systems with little or no CG flashes (e.g., precipitation from Mesoscale convective system stratiform regions). The rain yields that we obtained cannot therefore be interpreted as a unique amount of precipitation associated with an individual CG flash. The rain yield only indicates a general relationship between convective precipitation and CG lightning.\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\nThe CG flash density and convective precipitation during the warm season on the Iberian Peninsula are shown in Fig. 3. Both spatial CG lightning and convective precipitation distributions are very similar, increasing northward. On comparing Figs. 1 and 3 it can be seen that convective activity approximately follows altitude distribution, as expected. However, it should be mentioned that convective activity is higher over the Mediterranean coast than over the Atlantic coast. This is an effect of the Mediterranean Sea, which supplies warm and humid air, thus increasing convective activity.\n\nFigure 4 shows the spatial distribution of rain yield. Rain yields increase toward seas, reaching their maximum values on the coasts. Minimum values are found over the central areas of the Iberian Peninsula. It should be noted that the rain yields along the northern and southern coasts are similar, in spite of the fact that convective activity is higher in the north. These results are physically consistent. Oceanic cumulonimbi are generally associated with low lightning activity (e.g., Williams et al. 1992; Rutledge et al. 1992; Petersen et al. 1996) and high amounts of precipitation (e.g., Zipser 1994; Rickenbach and Rutledge 1998). Therefore, the rain yield is expected to increase as the climate regime becomes more humid. The north–south-oriented tongue of high rain yield values (>1.2 × 108 kg fl−1) from the center of the Iberian Peninsula to the southeast coast is remarkable. This area approximately corresponds to two mountainous ranges: the Sistema Penibetico and the Sistema Central. Thus, these high values may be partly caused by rain yields that have been inflated by upslope precipitation. However, they may also reflect an area of humid climate within a region of semiarid regime generated by low-level transport of high-θe air off the Mediterranean Sea. The south and east coasts of the Iberian Peninsula are usually considered to be semiarid (Fig. 2). This climate designation is deduced from the Köppen and Thornwaite climate classification. The rain yield seems to suggest that these coastal areas are more humid.\n\nIt is expected that detection efficiency will decrease as the distance from the perimeters of the lightning detection network increases. The network configuration (Fig. 1) suggests the possibility that rain yield may be artificially inflated on the west coast of the Iberian Peninsula (i.e., Portugal). However, rain yield values in this area seem to be reasonable. The procedure used to estimate convective precipitation may explain this fact. Not only weakly forced convective events were removed from our sample in this area, but also deeper events associated with artificially low flash counts.\n\nBecause of the dependence of rain yield on the climate regime, the analysis of lightning and precipitation production must be conducted within each climate regime (Fig. 2). The average rain yield within each climate regime as well as the correlation coefficient between precipitation and CG lightning are summarized in Table 1 for each month and for the whole warm season. This average rain yield may be considered as an estimation of the rain yield on a spatial scale on the order of climate regimes. Seasonal mean rain yields in the Iberian Peninsula are over 108 kg fl−1. This value compares well with the values reported by other authors for continental midlatitude areas but it is lower than the values reported for subtropical and oceanic areas. Petersen and Rutledge (1998), for example, give mean values of ∼108 kg fl−1 for the continental United States, ∼109 kg fl−1 for the island ocean rainfall regime, and ∼1010 kg fl−1 for the tropical ocean rainfall regime.\n\nThe rain yields in the humid Iberian Peninsula range from 1.0 × 107 to 8.5 × 108 kg fl−1, with a mean value of 2.1 × 108 kg fl−1. This value is close to that of Petersen and Rutledge (1998) for the humid United States: 1.3 × 108 kg fl−1 for the humid Southeast and 2.5 × 108 kg fl−1 for the north. As expected, rain yields in the semiarid Iberian Peninsula are lower, ranging between 7 × 106 and 5 × 108 kg fl−1, with a mean value of 1.2 × 108 kg fl−1. This value also compares well to that reported by Petersen and Rutledge (1998) for the arid United States: 5.7 × 107 kg fl−1 for the arid Southwest and 1.1 × 108 kg fl−1 for the midcontinent. The same behavior, that is, higher rain yields for the humid Iberian Peninsula, is found when monthly mean rain yields are considered (Table 1). Deviations from the mean rain yields are higher for the semiarid Iberian Peninsula. This is probably an effect of the inclusion within the semiarid region of the zone of high rain yields found over the southern region (see Fig. 4). Monthly rain yields are higher in June and August than in July for both climate regimes (Table 1). The passage of frontal systems over the Iberian Peninsula in the first half of June and the second half of August is not a rare occurrence and hence the high values of rain yield computed for June and August relative to July are an effect of rain yields that have been inflated by nonconvective frontal precipitation.\n\nThe correlation coefficients between convective precipitation and CG flash count are higher for the semiarid regime (0.75 for the whole warm season), where ice-based precipitation processes are dominant. In the humid zone (correlation coefficient of 0.67 for the whole warm season), precipitation is affected by synoptic systems, which produce precipitation with a small amount of flashes. This is in agreement with other studies (i.e., Rutledge et al. 1992; Zipser 1994) reporting that lightning activity associated with oceanic areas is lower than that associated with continental areas. The correlation coefficients reported by Petersen and Rutledge (1998) for the humid United States (0.71 for the humid Southeast and 0.45 for the north) are close to that found in the humid Iberian Peninsula, and the values reported for the arid United States (0.90 for the arid Southwest and 0.87 for the midcontinent) are slightly higher than those found in the semiarid Iberian Peninsula. The correlation coefficients of each month (Table 1) show that the largest correlation is achieved for both climate regimes in July, when nonconvective precipitation is very rare. In June and August the precipitation data were inflated by frontal precipitation.\n\nTo test the stability and correlation associated with these results, we followed the same approach as Petersen and Rutledge (1998) for the continental United States. We have calculated the monthly and seasonal mean rain yields for 1992 and 1993 and computed a “predicted” convective precipitation for 1994 multiplying the 1994 CG flash count by the appropriate 1992–93 rain yield. The correlation coefficients between actual and predicted convective precipitation are shown in Table 2 and the scatterplot of predicted versus gauge-measured precipitation is depicted in Fig. 5 for the whole of warm season. The seasonal correlation coefficient is 0.71. This value is lower than that reported by Petersen and Rutledge (1998) for the continental United States (0.95), but we used a small spatial scale and did not reject in our correlation the data that might have been inflated by non-lightning-producing frontal precipitation, as discussed above. When the correlation coefficients for each month are compared, it is seen that the highest correlation between predicted and measured precipitation is reached in July. This is an expected result, since precipitation data are inflated by frontal precipitation in June and August, as discussed above. In any case, the correlation in June and August seems sufficiently significant. Further, it should be noted that only one point in Fig. 5 falls outside of the 95% confidence interval. This point corresponds to Soria in August, where 107 flashes were counted but only 62 mm of precipitation were measured. Soria is located in a mountainous region. In this case, our estimation of the precipitation on a grid block of 0.1° × 0.1° using only one data point may be not realistic due to the influence of orgraphy on convection."
