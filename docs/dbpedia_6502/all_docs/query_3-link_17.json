These findings highlight the substantial influence of urbanization on rainfall patterns in the urban environment.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Lake Victoria basin (LVB) and its surrounding areas face susceptibility to extreme events, exemplified by destructive flash floods resulting from intense rainfall in mountainous regions [1,2]. In recent times, there has been rapid progress in the development of the urban canopy model (UCM) in conjunction with mesoscale models. [3] conducted a comprehensive review outlining the evolution and status of urban canopy schemes within the WRF model. This encompasses bulk urban parameterization (BULK) [4], a single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM) [5], a multilayer urban canopy model (BEP) [6], and a simple building energy model (BEM) [7] linked to BEP. The WRF model, coupled with UCM (WRF/UCM), has been extensively utilized to explore the impacts of urbanization processes, such as the urban heat island effect and urban air quality.\n\nCities not only alter the permeability of surfaces and impact the extent of storms but also have the potential to amplify short-duration (sub-daily) extreme rainfall intensities [8,9], which are primary triggers for urban pluvial floods [10]. Several factors, including surface roughness, the presence of tall buildings, urban heat islands (UHI), heightened sensible heat, and aerosol concentration, can contribute to the intensification of extreme rainfall in urban areas [11,12]. The increase in surface roughness within a city compared to its surroundings is linked to the deceleration of air masses moving toward the city, leading to an augmented surface moisture convergence that elevates the rainfall intensity [13].\n\nThe urban environment plays a pivotal role in shaping meteorological conditions and radiation fluxes, especially during extreme weather events [14]. The impact of urbanization on weather patterns and energy balance has attracted heightened attention due to its far-reaching implications for public health, urban planning, and climate change. In the specific context of the Lake Victoria basin (LVB), an area marked by rapid urban expansion and susceptibility to intense rainfall events, it is of the utmost importance to understand the influence of an urban canopy on meteorological parameters [15,16,17,18].\n\nAn urban canopy, consisting of buildings, roads, vegetation, and other structures, possesses the capacity to influence local weather conditions via various mechanisms. Urban areas commonly display elevated temperatures in comparison to the surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect [19,20,21]. This temperature differential is attributed to factors such as diminished vegetation cover, expanded impervious surfaces, and the generation of anthropogenic heat. Consequently, extreme rainfall events in urbanized areas may interact with evolving meteorological conditions, potentially resulting in heightened rainfall intensity and modified storm dynamics.\n\nFurthermore, the urban canopy can shape the formation and behavior of clouds [14,22]. The presence of tall buildings can serve as impediments to the vertical movement of air masses, giving rise to localized updrafts and downdrafts. These vertical motions contribute to enhanced cloud formation and precipitation processes, potentially leading to more pronounced rainfall in urban areas. A crucial facet of the urban canopy’s impact on meteorology is its influence on radiation fluxes. Vegetation plays a pivotal role in regulating the energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere through processes such as evapotranspiration, solar radiation absorption, and reflection. As urban areas undergo a reduction in vegetation cover and an increase in artificial surfaces, significant changes occur in the energy balance and radiation budget. These alterations can give rise to shifts in local temperature patterns, atmospheric stability, and the formation and intensity of rainfall systems [9,23].\n\nThe LVB, which includes rapidly growing urban centers such as Kampala, Nairobi, and Kisumu, is undergoing swift urbanization, population expansion, and changes in land use [24,25]. These dynamics have the potential to exacerbate the consequences of extreme rainfall events, leading to heightened flood risks, damage to infrastructure, and threats to human lives and livelihoods. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive investigation into how the urban canopy in this region interacts with meteorological conditions during extreme rainfall events.\n\nGaining a nuanced understanding of the intricate relationship between urbanization and meteorology in the LVB can offer valuable insight for urban planners, policymakers, and disaster management agencies. By pinpointing the specific mechanisms through which the urban canopy influences extreme rainfall, strategies can be formulated to mitigate the adverse impacts of such events and bolster urban resilience. Furthermore, this research contributes to a broader understanding of the urban environment’s role in local and regional climate dynamics, facilitating efforts to address the challenges posed by urbanization and climate change.\n\nThis study aims to examine the impact of the urban canopy on meteorological conditions during an extreme rainfall event in the Lake Victoria basin (LVB). We set out to evaluate the spatiotemporal variations in rainfall characteristics and other meteorological parameters across urban and rural areas, employing a combination of observational data, numerical modeling, and statistical analyses. The outcomes of this investigation contribute to a more holistic understanding of the interaction between urban environments and the atmosphere, offering valuable insight for sustainable urban planning and climate resilience in the LVB and analogous regions experiencing rapid urbanization and extreme weather events.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides details on the study area, data, and methodology employed, while Section 3 examines the findings. Finally, Section 4 outlines the primary conclusions derived from the study.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Study Area and Selection of the Heavy Rainfall Event\n\nThe basin encompasses portions of Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, as depicted in Figure 1. Positioned within a continental sag between the two arms of the Great Rift Valley system, the basin is flanked by elevated mountain ranges to the east and west, including Kilimanjaro, Kenya, and Rwenzori. The altitude of the lake surface is approximately 1135 m above the mean sea level, while the basin itself comprises a succession of stepped plateaus with an average elevation of 2700 m, rising to 4000 m or more in the highland areas [26]. The land use and land cover in the LVB have undergone significant transformations, primarily due to human activities resulting in the conversion of forests, woodlands, grasslands, and wetlands into either agricultural land or settlements [27]. Figure 1 depicts the changes of land use/land cover up to the year 2022, utilizing Landsat multi-temporal satellite images. The Lake Victoria region stands out as one of the most densely populated areas in East Africa, boasting a population exceeding 30 million [5,28,29].\n\nThe definition of severe rainfall used in this study is taken from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)’s Severe Weather Forecasting Programme (SWFP). According to SWFP, the threshold for defining severe rainfall is set at 50 mm [30]. Table 1 presents rainfall data, specifically noting instances of more than 20 mm recorded in the Lake Victoria basin between the 24th and 26th of April 2022. A 20 mm threshold is chosen on the basis that it becomes extreme if experienced persistently in the region for more than two consecutive days (https://community.wmo.int/en/activity-areas/severe-weather-forecasting-programme-swfp, accessed on 22 March 2022).\n\n2.2. The Interactions between Lake Victoria and the Atmosphere\n\nThe storms in this region are caused by circulation in the atmosphere above Lake Victoria. Daytime breezes flow outward from the relatively cool surface of the lake toward the sunbaked land. At night, the pattern reverses, and land breezes converge over the water. Combined with evaporation from the vast lake and warm-air convection into the atmosphere, this results in thunderstorms [31].\n\nThe lake’s large surface area and relatively warm temperatures can lead to the evaporation of water into the atmosphere. This process contributes to the moisture content in the air, which can then lead to precipitation in the form of rain or storms in the surrounding region [32].\n\nAdditionally, the presence of Lake Victoria also influences local wind patterns. The temperature difference between the lake and the surrounding land can create a temperature gradient, leading to the formation of breezes or winds that can affect the local climate and weather patterns [33].\n\nThe lake also plays a role in regulating the temperature of the surrounding area. During the day, the water in the lake absorbs heat from the sun, helping to moderate the temperature of the air above it. At night, the lake releases this heat, keeping the surrounding area warmer than it would be otherwise [34].\n\nIn summary, the interactions between Lake Victoria and the atmosphere are complex and dynamic, with the lake exerting a significant influence on the local climate and weather patterns in the region.\n\n2.3. Model Description and Experiments\n\nThe Weather Research and Forecasting model, version 4.4.2, with a convective-permitting resolution of 3 km, was employed to simulate the impact of the urban canopy on meteorology during an extreme rainfall event in the LVB [35]. The model runs were conducted using a modified version of WRF, specifically version 4.4.2. The WRF model is a non-hydrostatic compressible model that utilizes a mass coordinate system, and it is widely used as a mesoscale meteorological model. The version utilized in this study incorporates an updated urban Local Climate Zone (LCZ) numbering system, ranging from 51 to 61 in parameter tables, to prevent potential overlaps with existing land-type data.\n\nThe simulation period commenced on 23 April 2022 at 00:00 UTC and lasted until 26 April 2022, 00:00 UTC. To ensure the model’s stability, the first day (24 h) of the output was designated as spin-up time, with the subsequent 96 h considered for analysis. The initial and boundary conditions for the simulations were derived from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis datasets, obtained from the NCAR/UCAR website (rda.ucar.edu); these datasets feature a horizontal resolution of 0.25°.\n\nThree experiments were conducted during this study. The first experiment involved replacing urban areas with the dominant surrounding vegetation category (referred to as non-urban physics or non-urban). The other two experiments served as control simulations and utilized the default land use of two distinct urban physics schemes, which included urban areas. The model was executed with three nested domains as shown in Table 2., featuring horizontal resolutions of 27 km, 9 km, and 3 km, and encompassing 50 vertical levels from the surface to the 50 hPa level. The investigation into the effects of the urban canopy was carried out by analyzing the differences between the control simulations and the non-urban simulation.\n\nThe control simulations involved the urban canopy model (UCM) three-category option with surface effects for roofs, walls, and streets. This included an experiment with a green roof option and utilized the PBL Yonsei University scheme: a non-local-K scheme with an explicit entrainment layer and a parabolic K profile in the unstable mixed layer (bl_pbl_physics = 1). Additionally, it incorporated building effect parameterization (BEP) with the PBL scheme BouLac PBL (8), i.e., Bougeault–Lacarrère PBL, which was specifically designed for use with the BEPurban model [36]. This scheme included a TKE prediction option.\n\nSeveral physical parameterizations were switched on for this study, including the following:\n\n1. The Noah-land-surface model [37], which was used to represent land-surface processes.\n\n2. The rapid radiative transfer model (RRTMG) scheme for long- and short-wave radiation [38]. A radiative transfer model simulates the interaction of radiation with the atmosphere.\n\n3. A modified MM5 surface layer scheme [39], which was employed for surface layer processes.\n\n4. The BouLac boundary layer scheme [36], which was used to model boundary layer processes.\n\n5. The Stony Brook University (Y. Lin) scheme [40]. A five-class scheme with riming intensity, which accounts for mixed-phase processes in microphysics.\n\nAdditionally, the cumulus convection scheme used in this study was the Grell 3D cumulus scheme [41] for domains d01 and d02. However, it was not used for the finest domain (d03), since the model can explicitly solve convection at such a fine resolution (3 km).\n\nFigure 2 shows the systematic approach or set of procedures used to conduct research, in our case it involves a combination of data analysis, numerical modeling, and scientific interpretation to assess the effects of the urban canopy on extreme rainfall and other weather parameters using the WRF model.\n\n2.4. Observational Data\n\nThe satellite-based precipitation data utilized in this study are derived using the Climate Prediction Centre (CPC)’s morphing technique (CMORPH), which comprises global high-resolution satellite precipitation estimates [42]. The dataset has undergone bias correction and reprocessing. Initially, global precipitation data taken solely from satellites are integrated, drawing from all available passive microwave measurements aboard low-Earth orbiting platforms. To rectify biases, these integrated precipitation data are compared with the CPC daily gauge analysis over land and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) analyses conducted over the ocean [43]. The CMORPH data are then reprocessed on a global grid with a spacing of 8 km × 8 km and a temporal interval of 30 min, covering the period from January 1998 to the present. This dataset has previously been employed in studies focusing on the rainfall climate in cities and in numerical modeling evaluations [44,45,46]. In specific instances related to Africa, the daily data are downscaled to a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°. This reduction in the spatial resolution is undertaken to facilitate and enhance support for land-surface modeling activities. Downscaling allows for a more detailed representation of geographical features and local conditions, providing valuable input for land-surface models operating at a finer scale.\n\nERA5, on the other hand, constitutes the fifth-generation ECMWF reanalysis, providing global climate and weather data for the past eight decades [47,48]. The data are available from 1940 onward, replacing the ERA-Interim reanalysis. ERA5 offers hourly estimates for various atmospheric, ocean-wave, and land-surface quantities.\n\n2.5. Statistical Metrics for Model Evaluation\n\nThe predominant approach for assessing the model involves employing statistical analysis with observed data. While the evaluation process aligns with validation methodologies in several respects, its primary objective is to gauge the model’s capacity to replicate observed phenomena. The utilized statistical indices are shown in Appendix A, and the contingency table was formulated as shown in Table 3. Below.\n\n2.6. Calculation of the Moisture-Flux Convergence\n\nRegarding the vertically integrated moisture-flux convergence (VIMFC), we define VIMFC as the horizontal moisture-flux convergence integrated between 1000 hPa and 500 hPa to measure the lower tropospheric forced lifting, as most water vapor exists below 500 hPa, i.e., as shown in Appendix A.\n\n2.7. Observation Minus Reanalysis Method\n\nThe “observation minus reanalysis” (OMR) method is a valuable technique employed in meteorology and climate science to evaluate the precision and reliability of atmospheric observations, particularly within the realms of climate research and numerical weather predictions [49,50]. The widely used OMR method serves to explore the influence of urbanization and land-use changes on climate dynamics [51].\n\nIn the context of this study, simulations without urban physics (non-urban) were utilized as the control simulation. This was because we aimed to investigate the impact of the urban canopy on extreme weather events and radiation fluxes, providing insight into the effects of urbanization on these climatic factors.\n\n3.

Rainfall distribution\n\nFigure 3 depicts the spatial distribution of a rainfall event occurring between the 24th and 25th of April 2022. Initially, the observation data from CMORPH and the two control experiments (denoted as b and c) exhibited a comparable pattern, indicating substantial precipitation over the lake and the western regions of the study domain. Nevertheless, we observed that, when compared to simulations with the urban canopy (urban), the simulations incorporating the building effect parameterization demonstrated a more dispersed rainfall pattern. Urban areas often experience higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas due to the urban heat island effect. This localized warming is caused by the concentration of buildings, pavements, and other heat-absorbing materials [52]. The higher temperatures can lead to increased atmospheric instability, which can enhance convective processes and potentially lead to more localized rainfall.\n\n3.1.2. Diurnal Variation\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the diurnal variation in the study area, showing elevated rainfall during the daytime on the 25th and 26th and during the nighttime on the 24th. Notably, the pattern was not consistent, suggesting that factors other than changes in the urban environment influence extreme rainfall. The study indicated that the urban building effect parameterization (BEP) tended to overestimate the maximum rainfall during the night while underestimating it during the day.\n\nAn inconsistent diurnal pattern was identified, with high levels of rainfall observed during the night extending into the daytime; meanwhile, on the 25th and 26th, high levels of rainfall were predominantly observed during the daytime. During the day, urban areas tend to experience the urban heat island effect, where temperatures are higher than in the surrounding rural areas. This localized warming can lead to increased atmospheric instability, which, in turn, can enhance convective processes and potentially lead to more localized rainfall during the day. Daytime heating from solar radiation can also lead to the development of thermal and local circulations within urban areas. These processes can contribute to the lifting of air and the formation of clouds, potentially leading to increased rainfall during the day. Anthropogenic heat sources contribute to the release of heat into the atmosphere. These anthropogenic heat sources can further enhance the urban heat island effect and contribute to increased convective activity and rainfall during the day [53,54]. This variation suggests that meteorological factors beyond changes in experimental physics may influence the diurnal pattern.\n\n3.2. Evaluation of the Model\n\nLow bias, a small normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and a higher positive correlation coefficient (CC) are generally indicative of a well-performing model [55]. The model’s performance is evaluated by comparing the simulated results with the satellite product CMORPH. The initiation and evolution of rainfall over the Lake Victoria basin are tracked and compared between CMORPH and the simulations. To objectively assess the evolution of the extreme rainfall event in time and space, we utilize bias, the RMSE, and Pearson correlation coefficients to compare the two datasets. In the evaluation, we employ the Grell 3D cumulus scheme in the mother and second domains, considering its dualistic performance and relevance to the experiments [41]. The rain event is reproduced using CMORPH data, taking into consideration the fact that rainfall modeling is highly sensitive to the initial conditions, especially for short simulation periods to the scale of days. It is widely understood that, in numerical weather forecasting, the initial conditions (particularly the amount and instability of moisture) significantly impact the outcomes.\n\nWe evaluated the model’s spatial capacity to replicate rainfall patterns across the Lake Victoria basin, and the outcomes are presented in a visual form in Figure 2. The analysis reveals that the WRF model exhibits a robust performance when compared to the observed datasets (CMORPH). Figure 5a,b illustrates the RMSE of the model within the study region, while (c, and d) depict the model’s bias outcomes for the same area. The model tends to overestimate rainfall in the Lake Victoria area and underestimate it in the corresponding regions. The instances of the model overestimating precipitation in specific areas are highlighted. Specifically, high-positive-bias values (bias > 25 mm) are identified over Lake Victoria and certain western regions, while lower bias values (bias < −25 mm) are observed elsewhere.\n\nThe bias and RMSE during the rainfall event were further analyzed using time series analysis, and the results are presented in Figure 5e,f. The findings indicate that BEPurban outperformed non-urban and urban in terms of bias and RMSE in the rainfall time series analysis. Bias measures the systematic error in the model’s predictions, indicating whether the model consistently overestimates or underestimates the observed values. A lower bias value for BEPurban indicates that the model’s predictions are closer to the true values on average, with less systematic deviation. A lower bias value indicates that the model’s average predictions are more accurate and closer to the true values, which is a positive indicator of the model’s performance [56]. The RMSE measures the average magnitude of the errors between the predicted values and the observed values [57]. A lower RMSE for BEPurban indicates that the model’s predictions are closer to the observed data points on average. In other words, the model’s simulations are more accurate and exhibit smaller deviations from the actual data. This result also indicates that the model is better at capturing the variability and patterns in the observed data, which is a positive indicator of the model’s performance.\n\nThe correlation of our model’s simulation of the rainfall event using the CMORPH dataset in Figure 6a,b illustrates the relationship between the predicted values generated from the model and the actual values in a scattered plot and regression line. It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the predicted and actual values for non-urban, urban, and BEPurban, with correlation coefficients of R = 0.7984, 0.78, and 0.83, respectively. In this context, our evaluation model, which showed a higher correlation, reveals that the BEPurban results exhibited a strong linear relationship between the simulated data and the observed data. This constitutes a strong positive indicator of the model’s performance and its ability to simulate the behavior of the extreme rainfall being studied [58].\n\nTo realistically compare the model’s performance against observations, we added more statistics, such as the false alarm ratio (FAR), the frequency bias index (FBI), the probability of detection (POD), and the critical success index (CSI) for the amount of rainfall experienced in the region, as shown in Table 4. The results of the two control experiments, the urban canopy model (urban), and the multiple-canopy model of building effect parameterization (BEPurban) show higher scores for POD, FBI, and CSI, along with a lower FAR score. This indicates that the WRF model exhibited a better spatial performance than CMORPH rainfall.\n\nThe FBI index for the three experiments is one or almost equal to one, suggesting that the WRF model’s results are spatially well-located compared to CMORPH rainfall. However, for the two experiments, BEPurban performed better than urban on days when there was extreme rainfall.\n\n3.3. Effect of the Urban Canopy on Meteorology\n\n3.3.1. Rainfall\n\nTo better understand the differences between the simulated experiments, a further analysis was conducted using the differences in simulated rainfall, as is shown in Figure 7. It can be observed that BEPurban has more significant modifications, especially over the lake and western locations. This implies that buildings have a more pronounced impact on the intensity of rainfall over the study domain. Generally, in urban locations, there is an urban thermal effect, whereby the heat from buildings can directly reinforce convective processes by attracting and converging moisture from the surrounding area, consequently enhancing extreme rainfall events over urban areas [59,60,61]. Changes in the surface runoff can lead to increased surface runoff and the reduced infiltration of water into the soil. As a result, less water is available for groundwater recharging and natural moisture storage, potentially affecting the availability of water for sustaining local ecosystems and contributing to rainfall patterns.\n\n3.3.2. Moisture-Flux Convergence (MFC)\n\nFigure 8 displays the vertically integrated moisture flux and wind fields. A noticeable contrast is observed in the non-urban and BEPurban simulations, indicating that strong convergence is induced by the urban canopy over the urban–rural interface. In comparison to the non-urban simulations, the BEP simulations exhibit enhanced convection over urban areas. This enhanced convection is mainly attributed to increased surface roughness over urban areas, which decelerates wind speeds and leads to the expansion of the convergence zone from the urban–rural interface toward the urban areas [19,20,21].\n\n3.3.3. Temperature\n\nFigure 9 shows the spatial distribution of temperature across two meters during the extreme rainfall event (a, b, and c), along with the difference between the non-urban simulation and the control experiment (BEPurban). The simulated temperature in all environments, both non-urban and BEPurban, indicates an increase in temperature over the lake and a decrease as one moves further away from the lake.\n\nFurther analysis that utilizes the difference between non-urban and urban reveals negative values ranging between −0.4 K and 0 K. These values suggest an increase in temperature in the northern and western locations of the study domain, while the positive values indicate a decrease in temperature, particularly in the southern locations. This implies that higher temperatures were observed for urban areas in most northern and western locations, with the opposite trend observed in southern locations. The thermal influence appears to be limited, as contrasts in the surface temperature are relatively small in the BEPurban simulation, indicating an increase in temperature in the urban areas. Many building materials, such as concrete and asphalt, have good heat-absorption properties. This means that they absorb and retain heat from the sun, leading to higher surface temperatures and contributing to overall warming in urban areas [62,63,64]. Overall, the presence and characteristics of buildings in urban areas can significantly impact local temperatures, leading to higher temperatures compared to the surrounding rural areas.\n\n3.3.4. Relative Humidity\n\nIn Figure 10, the spatial characteristics of relative humidity (RH) reveal the highest RH in western and some northern locations of the Lake Victoria basin for both the non-urban and the control simulations (BEPurban). In comparative terms, relatively larger variations were observed between BEPurban and non-urban. For instance, the differences ranged between −1 and −4 for non-urban and BEPurban, dominating central and some western locations. This indicates that the magnitude of the difference was observed to be high for non-urban and BEPurban, signifying the high-level influence of BEPurban on RH. Based on these results, this study concludes that there is generally an increase in temperature and a decrease in RH due to the effects of roughness and buildings. As temperatures rise, the air’s capacity to hold moisture also increases, potentially leading to lower relative humidity levels. This effect is particularly noticeable in densely built-up areas with significant heat generation from buildings, industrial processes, and transportation. Buildings can influence local airflow patterns, potentially impacting the distribution of moisture in the air. In some cases, buildings can also obstruct natural airflow, which may affect the dispersion of moisture and lead to variations in relative humidity levels in different parts of the urban environment [65].\n\n3.3.5. Sensible Heat\n\nAs shown in Figure 11, the sensible heat flux is dominated by positive fluxes (0–75 W/m2) over the land, with a few locations showing negative fluxes. The magnitude of the difference is notable for non-urban and BEPurban, with the highest values observed over the eastern locations. For sensible heat, in the comparison between non-urban and BEPurban (hfx non-urban, hfx BEPurban), high magnitudes of negative values, indicating an increase in sensible heat flux due to urbanization, can be seen over the southern locations, while positive values (decreased sensible heat flux) are observed over the lake and western locations. An increase in surface temperatures around the buildings contributes to a higher sensible heat flux. The stored heat is then released back into the atmosphere, impacting the local heat exchange between the surface and the air [66].\n\n3.3.6. Latent Heat\n\nThe latent heat flux was observed to be highest over Lake Victoria (in a, b, and c), primarily because there is less impervious coverage in the urban grid in the urban and BEPurban simulations, which promotes a greater latent heat flux due to evapotranspiration over Lake Victoria. This pattern is particularly evident in eastern locations (Figure 12). According to the model, latent heat was consistently high over the lake throughout the study period. In terms of magnitude, the disparities between urban and non-urban parametrizations seemed to have less of an impact on surface energy fluxes across the entire lake basin. However, this contrasted with the significant influence of non-urban and BEPurban parametrizations on surface energy fluxes in the same region. The presence of the buildings causes the rate of evapotranspiration to decrease, leading to a reduction in the latent heat flux. Heat retention and redistribution lead to elevated surface temperatures in urban areas, which, in turn, affect the local water cycle and can influence the availability of moisture for evaporation, potentially reducing the overall latent heat flux in the vicinity of buildings [67,68].\n\n3.3.7. Vertically Integrated Moisture Flux\n\nFigure 13 shows the results for the integrated moisture flux, indicating a clear convergence of air moisture over the urban area. An increase in the moisture flux implies a rise in the amount of water vapor being transported in a specific direction. This can occur due to various atmospheric processes, including changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, temperature, and humidity gradients, or the availability of surface moisture. In regions with high levels of humidity, an elevation in the moisture flux can lead to more frequent and intense precipitation events, potentially causing flooding and landslides.\n\nThe water vapor flux (WVF) shown in Figure 13 reveals the transportation of moisture from the southeast to the study domain, with a pronounced influence over the eastern locations. The study also observed a variation in the moisture concentration when comparing non-urban with BEP-urban (Figure 13c). BEP-urban demonstrated a more pronounced effect on moisture transportation compared to the non-urban experiment. The study noted an increase in moisture over the central locations of the study domain due to the influence of buildings, as indicated by negative values. This suggests that the urban heat island (UHI) not only enhances convergence over the urban area (due to the additional sensible heat flux) but also amplifies the land/lake temperature contrast. This contrast, in turn, reinforces the lake breeze, bringing in additional moisture. Changes in the vertical distribution of moisture due to urban development can influence local precipitation patterns. The altered moisture flux resulting from the presence of buildings can impact the formation and behavior of clouds and precipitation processes [69,70].\n\n4. Summary and Conclusions\n\nThe study investigated the impact of the urban canopy on an extreme rainfall event in the Lake Victoria basin. Utilizing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, three sets of experiments were conducted over three days in this East African region. The model verification, employing metrics such as the false alarm ratio (FAR), the frequency bias index (FBI), the probability of detection (POD), and the critical success index (CSI), indicates that the WRF model performed well, aligning closely with both CMORPH and ERA5 in capturing spatial patterns during the extreme event. In terms of the model’s performance, the study indicates that WRF simulations effectively represent the extreme event, with BEPurban outperforming the urban experiment. Therefore, WRF can be regarded as a reliable tool for forecasting weather parameters during such extreme events.\n\nComparisons between the well-performing control run (BEPurban) and the non-urban run simulations, where the urban area is replaced with forest, reveal that the urban environment amplifies extreme rainfall events. The control run generates 30 mm more rainfall over the city compared to its non-urban counterpart. This enhancement is attributed to urban factors such as reduced evapotranspiration, resulting in an increased sensible heat flux (by 75 W m2) and an elevated urban heat island effect (0.4 K increase in air surface temperature). These factors trigger horizontal convergence and enhance the sea breeze, leading to the convergence of moisture from the southern sea area over built-up areas. This creates favorable conditions for convection and rainfall processes.\n\nUnderstanding the impact of the urban canopy on extreme rainfall events is crucial for policymakers and urban planners. It helps in the development of strategies to mitigate flood risks and promote sustainable urban development. The WRF model serves as a valuable tool for assessing and predicting the influences of urbanization on rainfall patterns, facilitating informed decision making amid increasing urbanization in the region. This type of research helps to improve our understanding of how urbanization affects meteorology and hydrometeorology, providing a foundation for enhancing the resilience of future cities to weather- and climate-related hazards. As far as the community is concerned, this study contributes to safeguarding the well-being of communities in the Lake Victoria basin by providing knowledge that can improve preparedness and responses to extreme rainfall events, including the implementation of early-warning systems, disaster risk reduction measures, and community-based adaptation strategies. The robustness of the validation and verification of the study using the WRF model is reduced due to the restricted availability of in situ observational data. These data are characterized by frequent gaps, limited accessibility, and high costs, and they are often less accurate due to a variety of influencing factors.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization, J.B and J.Y; methodology, A.A.S.C.; software, A.A.S.C.; validation, J.B., and J.Y.; resources, J.Y.; visualization, N.M. and E.Y.; data curation, J.B. and A.A.S.C.; writing—original draft preparation, J.B.; writing—review and editing, N.M. and E.Y.; supervision, J.Y.; project administration, J.Y.; funding acquisition, J.Y.
