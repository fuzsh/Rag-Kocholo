To my mind rather than buying every imaginable item for all possible weather conditions and lugging those items all the way across Spain it's better to just be ready to purchase items as and when you need them, things aren't particularly expensive in Spain and there are plenty of shops along the CF.\n\nI had zero rain on my April/May walk in 2015 and it was regularly pushing 30c though there were some cold nights at altitude.\n\nBuen Camino,\n\nRob.\n\nCamino Chrissy\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nRecent:Norte/Muxia- Spring '23\n\nMadridWay- Fall '23\n\nDec 3, 2018\n\n#12\n\nWeatherspark.com will give you historic highs, lows, median temperatures, average precipitation, and so on, for any decent-sized town (such as Burgos or Leon), either by month or day.

Plan for rain, perhaps every other day. Get the Eltiempo.es+ app for your smartphone. It has the most comprehensive weather status and forecast information for Spain and Portugal.\n\nBasically the weather during this time can be cold and raw in the early morning. If you are lucky, the sun pops out and warms things up to where you can take off outer layers of clothing.\n\nIn my experience, and using this app for forecast information, if the probability of rain is under 40%, there will be not appreciable precipitation, though the day might be cloudy and blustery. If the probability is from 40% to 60% there may be a shower or two. However, if the probability is over 60%, plan for significant rain during the day. The weather app has hour-by-hour forecasts.\n\nAlso, plan to encounter light but wet snowfall at altitudes over about 700 meters ASL. This includes the Napoleon Pass, Alto de Perdon, Cruz de Ferro, O'Cebreiro, and any other peak higher than about 700 meters. I have walked past Cruz de Ferro three times from mid to late April to mid-May (2013, 2014, 2016). I have experienced snow, to some degree, every time.\n\nOn my last walk through O'Cebriero (2016), I found myself in the midst of a brief but furious snow squall with a whiteout for about an hour. One could not see 30 meters ahead. The snow was gone as soon as I walked down a hundred meters or so, after the peak...go figure...\n\nPack layers. Add and subtract layers as needed. You warm up as you walk. As long as you keep your feet dry, and your head and hands warm, you will be fine.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nC clearly\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMost years since 2012\n\nDec 3, 2018\n\n#16\n\nThe funny thing is that the same advice applies for any month of the year.

April 20 - May 20, 2016 had some snow remnants in the Pyrenees, though not much. It rained lightly and overcast the first week, had 10 days of sun on the Messeta, overcast and light rain after the Messeta and foggy mornings in Galicia. The mornings were cold, often times below freezing, almost the entire month. It snowed heavily at the Cruz de Ferro the day after I was there. I made the mistake of not bringing gloves, and bought a pair at a little store after Roncesvalles, and wore them every morning all the way to Santiago. We only had one afternoon that was actually hot, and shorts weather. Buen Camino!\n\nIriebabel\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2022\n\nDec 3, 2018\n\n#18\n\nI can tell you that I started in St Jean on 1 April. It rained for 2 weeks straight then a couple days of sunshine rain every day except for when it snowed. Morning and evening below freezing sometimes., wind rain and mud during the day.\n\nI suggest layers and good rain gear weather it’s poncho, rain pants , gaiters , gortex boots or socks and sandals. Be prepared but not overzealous. Towards the middle May was very sunny most days in Galicia but had a cold hail storm in Santiago around 15may. So as you can see the weather is unpredictable.\n\nJohn Hawke\n\nLeaving O Cebreiro\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2025\n\nDec 8, 2018\n\n#19\n\nAnd I started on April 18th and found it quite pleasant. Some rain days and a few where severe with temps that made walking quite pleasant. As T2Andreo said pack with layers, I started each day with a shirt a cover, a vest and a jacket. The jacket usually was off within the 1st hour and the vest by noon. Rarely did I get down to only the shirt. Good Luck and Buen camino\n\nThegreyfoxfromoz\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMarch 2018\n\nDec 8, 2018\n\n#20\n\nWe started March 10, 2018 in Pamplona. Finished April 6. Snow, strong wind, cold. But a week after we finished, floods. Have layering options. Get more experience in walking outdoors. Synthetic layering options gives you flexibility to handle all weather and keeps your pack light\n\nCicada\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances St Jean -Santiago April -June 2017\n\nDec 9, 2018\n\n#21\n\nHmm.......I put \"weather + April\" into the search box and ended up here......While I found the thread very interesting it does not really answer my question. If someone could give me an indication of what the weather on the Camino Frances is like in April and May it would be much appreciated.\n\nWalked in April May June 2017 42 days blessed with the weather only 3 days wet and no blisters. This year there were floods so next year who knows? Take it as it comes pasa a pasa\n\nBuen camino\n\nVacajoe\n\nTraded in my work boots for hiking ones\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances, Portuguese, Aragon, Norte, SJWayUK, Nive\n\nDec 9, 2018\n\n#22\n\nWalked April & May 2018 through snow, rain, sleet, fog, thunderstorms, hail, and also plenty of sunshine! In short, who knows about April 2019?!??\n\nBe prepared, but don’t overpack: stores exist in Spain, especially along the CF. Pack in layers that will quick-dry overnight.\n\nF\n\nFormer member 2537\n\nGuest\n\nDec 9, 2018\n\n#23\n\nPlease, can we stop talking about *weather* a year from now! We don’t know what the *weather* is going to be 10 days from now. We *can* talk about climate. And what somebody experienced last year, or five years ago, in terms of weather is completely irrelevant to the future. Please see:\n\nhttps://www.americanpilgrims.org/internet-resources#weather\n\nand find the climate tables. (Or the weather links if you’re interested in what’s going to happen tomorrow!)\n\nSusan Peacock\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances/SJPP '15,'16,'18,'19,('20)\n\nWay of St. Francis, Italy 2017\n\nPortuguese/Finisterre 2018, 2019\n\nDec 9, 2018\n\n#24\n\nCertainly the weather is unpredictable and part of the experience. I have walked twice in April/May, both times starting in SJPdP on April 14th. In 2016, I had a lot of rain and walked in white-out snow at Cruz de Fero (May 12th) , in 2018 I didn't have one day of rain, only a few snow flurries at Cruz de Fero: that is not to say that pilgrims a week before me or behind me didn't have totally different experience. My advice for this time of year would be to take layers, your preferred rain gear, a beanie and gloves as you most definitely will have some cold days (my preferred walking weather). While it is true that you can find gear in some towns, there are sections where you won't find any. I found myself totally surprised by the snow without gloves and a hat and certainly couldn't buy them in Foncebadon. I was very happy to have them this year!\n\nJaipurDan\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nmid April 2019 - Camino Frances\n\nDec 9, 2018\n\n#25\n\nWe must think alike Lindsay as that was going to be my question! I am also walking the Camino Frances mid April. Good to get a sense of what to expect and about the cold temperatures. A lot of packing lists i had read were more geared towards the warmer weather and i too wanted to get a sense of what temperatures we are talking about. I'd figured layers were the way forward but didn't want to come with too little due to keeping the weight down and finding myself cold....I hate being cold! Thanks everyone for your answers.\n\nLindsay53\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 2019\n\nPortugues 2022\n\nVDLP 2023\n\nDec 9, 2018\n\n#26\n\nWe must think alike Lindsay as that was going to be my question!

We may end up freezing (or roasting) together.\n\nSusan Peacock\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances/SJPP '15,'16,'18,'19,('20)\n\nWay of St. Francis, Italy 2017\n\nPortuguese/Finisterre 2018, 2019\n\nDec 9, 2018\n\n#27\n\nDefinitely two different packing list. My pack this time of year weighs a good 3-4 lbs more due to clothing and my sleep sack that I made by sewing on a down throw to one side of my silk liner (kept this to 1 lb.)\n\namocatnerak\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances April 2018, Frances October 2019\n\nDec 9, 2018\n\n#28\n\nI walked the first three weeks* in April this year (2018) and was glad I had all of my layers! It was cold and wet, raining, sleeting, and snowing a lot of the time. The coldest days were of course Cruz de Ferro and O’Cebreiro. The last few days into Santiago were beautiful. I would be prepared for cold days, wet days, and muddy trails. Also, I was glad I brought my sleeping bag as there were a few very cold nights in albergues.\n\n*skipping parts in the middle"
