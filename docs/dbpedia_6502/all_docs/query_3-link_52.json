Plans to walk Porto 2020\n\nSep 30, 2023\n\n#16\n\nDear Ruth, as usual the experience Forum Members have offered sensible (although humorous) advice.\n\nYour Camino from St Jean to Santiago during the months you have advised will imho offer any range of weather conditions. It can snow in the mountains above St Jean at virtually any time of the year; Yes the Meseta (the high plain from Burgos to Leon) can have temperatures in the +30c (86F) degree range, but these can be overcome by starting early (say 30 mins after sunrise).\n\nNote from Leon to O'Cebereiro you will encounter small mountains up to 1500m/4650ft so it should be more manageable.\n\nBy the time you reach O'Cebereiro you will be in Galicia the cooler weather should be with you.\n\nAs advised if necessary you can buy lighter clothing (there are 3 or 4 large cities on this Camino).\n\nSo my advise come prepared - a broad brim hat (not a baseball one), carry and drink two litres of water per day (that about 2 US quarts). Oh and just take your time, take a rest of 15-20 mins every two hours, more frequently on hotter days. So go forth and Buen Camino.\n\nDonna Sch\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVdLP-Sanabres-Fisterra '15; Levante-Invierno '19\n\nSep 30, 2023\n\n#17\n\nThe Gulf Stream should be further south by then.

I’m currently in Ireland enjoying those very temps and having a great time, but I leave for SJPP in less than two weeks. My weather app keeps reporting temps in the high 80s for many of the Spanish cities along the Camino, and I’m starting to fear I’ve packed all wrong for this trip. This is probably just a rhetorical question, an airing of my fears, but when will it cool down?\n\nImpossible to know in advance, but there is a very lengthy heat wave in Europe which I think is global ,and to have been caused by a massive underwater volcanic eruption, and if so this unusually hot weather will last until about 2025, and so until the extra water vapor in the atmosphere comes down as rain.\n\nIn any case, this heat wave started in 2021, and seems to be continuing, with its own seasonality.\n\nOctober-November should be OK though, they were last year.\n\nBut be prepared, bring a woollen jumper just in case, and rain kit will be a must for Galicia at the very least.\n\nRuth Sensenig\n\nRuthinak\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMarch/April 2018\n\nOct 2, 2023\n\n#47\n\nThanks, all, for the advice, commiseration, etc. I’m sure things will all work out. The Camino will be a stretch for me mentally and physically and spiritually as it is, so the potential heat will just be one more challenge to help me rely on God as I walk.\n\nBuen Camino to those of you out there now or soon.\n\narfajajc\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nApril 2024\n\nRuth Sensenig\n\nRuthinak\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMarch/April 2018\n\nOct 2, 2023\n\n#49\n\nWhat?

I watch for when they come on sale. If you are looking online- try searching for \"long sleeve T shirts\" rather than base layers, and I'd also include the words \"relaxed fit\" or \"loose\". I found these - expensive, but you can see they are not tight. A few more came up too, from Australian manufacturers, but not sure where you are.\n\nLooks like there are more options in Australia. I’m in the USA\n\ntrecile\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious routes 2016 - 2024\n\nOct 4, 2023\n\n#52\n\nImpossible to know in advance, but there is a very lengthy heat wave in Europe which I think is global ,and to have been caused by a massive underwater volcanic eruption, and if so this unusually hot weather will last until about 2025, and so until the extra water vapor in the atmosphere comes down as rain.\n\nI haven't heard anything about the underwater volcanos, but another factor contributing to hot weather is the solar cycle - usually about 11 years in which solar activity increases and decreases. The next solar maximum is predicted for July 2025.\n\nBeedel\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nmid-Sept to mid-November, 2023\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\n#53\n\nI’m an Alaskan girl who’s most comfortable in 55-60 degree weather, and I have been excitedly planning my Camino for October-November, thinking that I would be able to stand the temps in Spain during those months. I’m currently in Ireland enjoying those very temps and having a great time, but I leave for SJPP in less than two weeks. My weather app keeps reporting temps in the high 80s for many of the Spanish cities along the Camino, and I’m starting to fear I’ve packed all wrong for this trip. This is probably just a rhetorical question, an airing of my fears, but when will it cool down?\n\nMy concerns as well! I am beginning Oc. 18.
