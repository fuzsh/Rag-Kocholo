        "meta_description": "Abstract. Current climate modelling frameworks present significant\nuncertainties when it comes to quantifying flood quantiles in the context of\nclimate change, calling for new information and strategies in hazard\nassessments. Here, state-of-the-art methods on hydraulic and statistical\nmodelling are applied to historical and contemporaneous flood records to\nevaluate flood hazards beyond natural climate cycles. A comprehensive flood\nrecord of the Duero River in Zamora (Spain) was compiled from documentary\nsources, early water-level readings and continuous gauge records spanning\nthe last 500Â years. Documentary evidence of flood events includes minute\nbooks (municipal and ecclesiastic), narrative descriptions, epigraphic\nmarks, newspapers and technical reports. We identified 69 flood events over\nthe period 1250 to 1871, of which 15 were classified as catastrophic\nfloods, 16 as extraordinary floods and 38 as ordinary floods. Subsequently,\na two-dimensional hydraulic model was implemented to relate flood stages (flood marks and\ninundated areas) to discharges. The historical flood records show the\nlargest floods over the last 500Â years occurred in 1860 (3450âm3âsâ1),\n1597 (3200âm3âsâ1) and 1739 (2700âm3âsâ1). Moreover, at least 24\nfloods exceeded the perception threshold of 1900âm3âsâ1 during the period\n(1500â1871). Annual maximum flood records were completed with gauged\nwater-level readings (pre-instrumental dataset, PRE: 1872â1919) and systematic gauge records (systematic\ndataset, SYS:\n1920â2018). The flood frequency analyses were based on (1) the expected moments\nalgorithm (EMA) and (2) the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) method, using\nfive datasets with different temporal frameworks (historic dataset, HISTO: 1511â2018; PREâSYS:\n1872â2018; full systematic record, ALLSYS: 1920â2018; SYS1: 1920â1969; and SYS2: 1970â2018). The\nmost consistent results were obtained using the HISTO dataset, even for high\nquantiles (0.001â% annual exceedance probability, AEP). PREâSYS was robust\nfor the 1â% AEP flood with increasing uncertainty in the 0.2â% AEP or\n500-year flood, and ALLSYS results were uncertain in the 1â% and 0.2â%\nAEP floods. Since the 1970s, the frequency of extraordinary floods\n(>1900âm3âsâ1) declined, although floods on the range of the\nhistorical perception threshold occurred in 2001 (2075âm3âsâ1) and 2013\n(1654âm3âsâ1). Even if the future remains uncertain, this bottom-up\napproach addresses flood hazards under climate variability, providing real\nand certain flood discharges. Our results can provide a guide on low-regret\nadaptation decisions and improve public perception of extreme flooding.",

        "text": "There are major challenges in dealing with flood hazards on a global scale (UNISDR, 2015). Climate warming is part of the problem, but the challenges will continue to be great as a result of population growth and human occupation of flood risk zones (Kundzewicz et al., 2014). Most âtop-downâ approaches based on downscaling of nested climate models with hydrological approaches (deterministic and statistical) typically produce uncertain results, with a wide range of scenarios which are difficult to implement on a local scale (GarcÃ­a et al., 2014; IPCC, 2012). Given the uncertainty in climate model projections, a new focus on other risk variables (demography, land use, urbanisation) has led to supporting decision-making processes (DÃ¶ll et al., 2015). This âbottom-upâ approach is based on reducing exposure and vulnerability but still fails to solve the probability assessment of flood hazards due to the stochastic nature of weather (Kundzewicz et al., 2010). In this regard, the information from past flood events has become an important data source to quantify the links between the occurrence of extreme events and natural climate variability that provide expectations of future climate change.\n\nOver recent decades, palaeoflood and documentary flood archives have been used to quantify flood discharge and frequency over centennial to millennial timescales with applications for engineering design and risk estimation (Aldrete, 2007; Baker, 2008; Wetter et al., 2011; Elleder et al., 2013). A recent pan-European historical archive analysis has identified nine flood-rich periods (30â40-year interval) over the last 500Â years, all except the last one (1992â2016) occurring during intervals of colder air temperatures than the interflood period before and after (BlÃ¶schl et al., 2020). The existence of flood-rich periods was also demonstrated at millennial timescales for the Mediterranean basin and at a European scale using palaeoflood sedimentary evidence (Benito et al., 2015c). These studies reveal that flood-producing mechanisms, on a local to regional scale, are not necessarily driven by temperature anomalies but are controlled by the behaviour process of ocean and atmospheric circulation (Woollings et al., 2010; Ballesteros-CÃ¡novas et al., 2019). Thus, long-term flood registers, produced by multiple atmosphereâocean interactions, contain a wide range of weather anomalies to advise on expected flood extremes in a changing climate, and, more importantly, it reveals what flood dimension is actually possible on a local scale (Elleder et al., 2013; Macdonald, 2013).\n\nHistorical and palaeoflood hydrology has demonstrated its potential to determine the quantitative information of specific flood events over centennial to millennial time spans (Benito et al., 2015a; CÅur and Lang, 2008; Wetter et al., 2011; Elleder et al., 2013; Wilhelm et al., 2019). Major advances are related to (1) digitalisation of archival sources, facilitating the search and screening tasks; (2) lidar data used for digital terrain models, buildings and urban spaces; (3) application of sophisticated two- or even three-dimensional hydraulic modelling to estimate peak discharges, local flow velocity and depth; and (4) new statistical procedures and software to feed historical and palaeoflood data into quantitative frequency analysis (Macdonald, 2013; Benito et al., 2020). Although in the past the use of historical flood archives was mainly considered in academic research circles, a recent publication by the US federal government guidelines (England et al., 2019) shows a growing interest to harness past flood information to evaluate flood hazards and risks (St. George et al., 2020). In the European Union, several countries have proposed the use of past flood data on the probability of future floods as part of low-regret actions to solve the uncertainty in downscaling climate model results on a local scale (GarcÃ­a et al., 2014; European Commission, 2021). Going forward, technical guidance and new protocols on the use of past flood archives are needed to reach engineers and stakeholders so it can become a far-reaching and smart tool to cope with flooding (EXCIMAP, 2007; England et al., 2019).\n\nIn this paper, we firstly implement a holistic methodology combining historical flood evidence and a two-dimensional hydraulic model to reconstruct centennial registers of peak discharges and their relationship with natural climate variability and triggers. Secondly, we apply two flood frequency statistical methods to different types and series lengths of flood data sources (historic, pre-instrumental and gauged records) to evaluate the robustness of flood discharges for low-probability events. Thirdly, we consider the historical flood imprint on local communities as a basic tool to improve public risk awareness on urban space, heritage buildings and cultural landscapes. Our results based on this bottom-up approach show a direct guide on flood possibilities beyond decadal climate cycles that can be used to provide a portfolio of low-regret solutions suitable for climate change adaptation.\n\n3.1âInstrumental records\n\nThe Duero River hydrological gauge stations next to Zamora (Fig.Â 1c) comprise (i) Carrascal (Station N.2066, period 1918â2021) located 8âkm downstream of Zamora, (ii) Zamora (Station N.2121, 2002â2021), (iii) Villachica (Station N.2096, 1929â1967) and (iv) Toro (Station N.2062, 2011â2021); the latter two are located 25 and 28âkm upstream of Zamora, respectively.\n\nThe oldest gauged records correspond to water-level readings taken on a daily basis in the El Porvenir gauge station, covering the period 1880 and 1943. The gauged section is located ca.Â 23âkmâââââââ downstream of Zamora at the San Roman hydroelectric station (operating since 1903). According to MarquinaÂ (1949b), the El Porvenir rating curve was well established to a stage of 5âm (1450âm3âsâ1) using the Villachica gauge data, whereas for higher discharges extrapolation of the curve may result in errors of ca.Â Â±10â%. The flood record was completed with the Carrascal station (1920âpresent) managed by the Iberdrola hydropower company, which allows robust estimations of historic floods in Zamora. The Toro and Villachica stations were used to test the gauged data at Carrascal, particularly those corresponding to flood peaks.\n\n3.2âHistorical data sources\n\nOur historical flood database was collected from published compilations, unpublished documents, epigraphic marks, historical maps, photos and newspapers (listed in the Supplement). The documentary flood records in Zamora essentially comprise a continuous series from 1545 to 1860 and a non-continuous dataset between 1250 and 1545 collected from ecclesiastic and municipal archives. In the Cathedral of Zamora archives, the Extracts of ecclesiastical agreements comprises two volumes over the period 1601 to 1745, and the Books of ecclesiastic agreements includes 34 volumes over the period 1601 to 1913. The municipal books (Libros de Actas) comprise 259 volumes over the period 1500â1899, although there are some missing documents over the periods 1503â1507, 1521â1530 and 1576â1585. Many references of those books and local chronicles were collected by historiographic collections, namely the historical memoirs of the city of Zamora (four volumes) by FernÃ¡ndez DuroÂ (1882). Extreme climate and hydrological event descriptions with reference to flooding in Zamora were also compiled in local ecclesiastic chronicles, namely by ZataraÃ­n-FernÃ¡ndezÂ (1898), and in the geological description of the Zamora Province by Puig y LarrazÂ (1883). Large floods typically affected historic buildings, such as churches, convents, bridges, walls and gates, the traces of which are recorded in architectural catalogues that describe inscriptions and flood marks, repair work to flood damages, or changes in the location of ecclesiastical communities due to the effects of major floods (Gomez-Moreno, 1927; AntÃ³n, 1927).\n\nThe most outstanding historical flood compilation effort was carried out by RodrÃ­guez MarquinaÂ (1941â1949), who analysed all available historical and hydrological reports on flooding for the construction of the dams in the Duero and Esla rivers. Marquina's manuscripts provided a highly detailed description and height survey of epigraphic marks, including some flood marks that later disappeared during restoration works. Marquina also compiled original water-level gauge readings from the Duero and Esla rivers at different locations (e.g. El Porvenir gauge). The temporal evolution of floodplain areas, buildings and riverine structures (weirs, bridges, mills, orchards, etc.) were evaluated using historic maps, drawings and etchings from historic times, namely by Anton van der Wyngaerde in 1570 (Kagan, 2008; RodrÃ­guez-MÃ©ndez and GarcÃ­a-Gago, 2014), Josep Auguier in 1756 (Museum of Zamora) and Juan MartÃ­n CermeÃ±o in 1766 (digital archive of the Ministry of Defence; Fig.Â 2a). The most detailed historical maps belong to the collection of plans of the municipal architect Segundo Viloria in 1880 (provincial historical archive of Zamora) and Zamora's municipal maps (19thâ20th centuries). A final source of flood data, mainly over the last 4 decades, was obtained from local and regional newspapers (Heraldo de Zamora, La Voz de Zamora, La OpiniÃ³n, Impero, among others) and national press (Ahora, La Correspondencia de EspaÃ±a, ABC, La Vanguardia). Regarding more general reference to the Duero River and its tributaries, an outstanding compilation of flood dates from historical data sources was compiled by Fontana TarratsÂ (1971â1977).\n\nThe reported floods were compared with historical series in the lower Douro River in Portugal (Loureiro, 1904; Aires et al., 2000; Amorim et al., 2017; Alcoforado et al., 2021). Flood severity was classified according to Barriendos and MartÃ­n-VideÂ (1998) into three flood categories: (1) ordinary, causing overbank flows of low to moderate intensity and temporary disruption of the human activities; (2) extraordinary, causing overbank flows of moderate intensity, with limited damages to crops, houses and river dykes; and (3) catastrophic, causing extensive overflow with significant damage to agriculture, mills, and/or destruction of houses and infrastructures.\n\n3.3âTwo-dimensional hydraulic modelling\n\nFlood water level (stage) related to historical floods includes (i) flood marks and observed water depth measures at sites reached by the flow (e.g. monastery, bridge, chapel, etc.), (ii) description of flooded areas (e.g. floodplain sectors, orchards, mills), (iii) description of non-flooded areas and (iv) comparative flood level of subsequent historical floods (e.g. said flood reached lower levels than previous one). The documented flood evidence can be used to estimate exact or relative (minimum or maximum) flood discharges associated with observed water levels. The conversion of flood level to discharge is obtained by matching a modelled water surface elevation for a given modelled discharge to the surveyed elevation of the known historical flood level (Benito et al., 2020).\n\nDischarge estimation by hydraulic modelling was carried out using a two-dimensional hydraulic model (Iber) which solves the depth-averaged shallow water (2D Saint-Venant) equations using a finite volume method with a second-order roe scheme (BladÃ© et al., 2014; http://www.iberaula.com, last access: 24Â NovemberÂ 2021âââââââ). This two-dimensional hydraulic model is particularly suitable for flow in alluvial floodplains with secondary currents. The model uses a non-structured mesh consisting of triangles or quadrilateral elements whose spatial resolution was set to 20âm for the channel bed, 10âm for the channel margins and floodplains, 1âm for river bars, and 1 to 5âm in the city streets and at major infrastructures (Fig.Â S1). The 13âkm length modelled reach extends from the Carrascal gauge station to the Duero River junction with the Valderaduey River (at the highway A-11; Fig.Â S1a). The Carrascal section is situated at a narrow bedrock canyon producing a backwater effect upon the upstream alluvial reach where the city of Zamora is located. The mesh elements were built from a cloud of lidar data with an average distance of 1.4âm (some are below 1âm) supplied by the Spanish National Geographic Institute (IGN; https://www.ign.es, last access: 24Â NovemberÂ 2021âââââââ). The topography of the river channel bottom and banks was obtained from field surveys with an echo-sounder device at cross-sections of 40 to 500âm distance (LINDE project, Ministry for Ecological Transition). The surveyed points from 268 cross-sections were extracted and integrated with the lidar cloud data using the spatial analyst tools in ArcGIS v.10. The bridges were introduced to model historical flood discharges considering their construction date.\n\nManning's n values were assigned from land use map classes (Corine Land Cover map) following the methodological guide of the National Flood Inundation Hazard Map (MMA, 2011). In our study, the initial set of n values was defined as 0.04 for the main channel and between 0.045 and 0.1 for the floodplains. Model calibration was performed using flow discharge-stage records at two gauge stations, namely the Carrascal one located at the farthest downstream cross-section and Zamora station in the upper sector of the modelled reach. For this calibration, the outflow stage for successive increments of inflow discharges in the upper section in Zamora was compared to the rating curve at the Carrascal gauge station. The difference in stage between the model and the gauge station for a discharge of 1100âm3âsâ1 was 2âcm, and for a discharge of 3100âm3âsâ1 it was 12âcm. After the model calibration, Manning's n at the channel was set at 0.035.\n\nThe flood marks and flooded sites mentioned in documentary flood evidence were surveyed using a Trimble GPS, supported by four geodetic survey monuments of the Spanish National Geographical Institute (numbers 305003, 305004, 601005 and 601006; TableÂ S1). We modelled successive increments of inlet water discharges at the upstream reach to simulate a steady flow. The hydraulic model provided a peak discharge vs. water stage relationship for 30 sites with known historical flood evidence (epigraphic marks, documented heights, description of flooded/non-flooded areas). We used the mean and standard deviation to estimate average peak discharge for each historical flood or used the minimum or maximum flood values according to the mean of the documentary flood evidence.\n\n3.4âFlood frequency analysis\n\nFlood data stationarity for censored samples (historical and systematic flooding) was confirmed using Lang's test (Lang et al., 1999). This test assumes that stationary flood series can be described by a homogeneous or stationary Poisson process. The 95â% tolerance interval of the cumulative number of floods above a threshold or censored level is calculated. Stationary flood series are those that remain within the 95â% tolerance interval (Naulet et al., 2005). The flood frequency analysis was performed with two computer programs: PeakFQ Version 7.2 (Flynn et al., 2006; Veilleux et al., 2014) and AFINS (Botero and FrancÃ©s, 2006, 2010). The PeakFQ program applies a generalised method-of-moments estimator denoted the expected moments algorithm (EMA; Cohn et al., 1997), whereas AFINS uses the maximum likelihood method (Frances, 2004). Flood frequency analysis was carried out with different combinations of three datasets: (1) documentary floods using minimum flow and/or peak discharge estimated from flood marks and reported flood descriptions (historic dataset, HISTO); (2) water-level readings on a scale gauge transformed into discharge at El Porvenir station (pre-instrumental dataset; PRE); and (3) continuous systematic records at Carracal station (systematic dataset: SYS), which was analysed first over the whole gauged period 1920â2018 (ALLSYS) and, secondly, subdivided on early (1920â1969; SYS1) and late (1970â2018; SYS2) datasets.\n\nThe documentary flood information is non-systematic data of censored type since only flows over a particular magnitude (commonly producing damages) are reported in documentary records. The minimum flood stage (perception threshold) is set according to flood magnitude spilling over urban areas, disrupting human activities (communication, manufacture works) and/or producing damage (orchards, bridge, houses and ecclesiastic goods). The flooding of sensitive urban areas, or perception threshold, may change through time according to the progressive human occupation of the riverine areas and the socio-economic context (Benito et al., 2004). In the case of Zamora, the perception threshold did not register significant changes through historical time. The minimum discharge (1900âm3âsâ1) is required to flow overbank in the low urban neighbourhoods of Horta, Olivares and Frontis and for cutting the main communication infrastructures next to the Duero River. The reconstructed historical flood discharges were added to the continuous gauged annual maximum flow records at the Porvenir and Carrascal stations.\n\nThe PeakFQ software uses the mentioned expected moments algorithm and a generalised version of the GrubbsâBeck test for identifying multiple potential influential low flows (PILFs; Cohn et al., 2013). Low annual discharge values may have excessive influence on the estimated frequency of large floods (Veilleux et al., 2014), and their identification of PILFs improve estimated frequency of large floods. PeakFQ is well designed to treat both historical and systematic data but only allows fitting of a log Pearson type III (LP3) distribution. A Gumbel distribution, commonly used in Spain, was fitted using the AFINS software that applies a maximum likelihood estimation method (MLE). This method has demonstrated a high capacity to incorporate in the estimation process any non-systematical data (Leese, 1973; Stedinger and Cohn, 1986). Visual matching of the plotting positions to the distribution curve and their statistical parameters were used to test the goodness of fit. Confidence intervals of the fitted distribution indicate the range of discharges statistically possible based on the available data.\n\n3.5âAnalyses of the atmospheric circulation related to floods\n\nTo provide a general context of the climate triggers of the larger floods exceeding the perception threshold of 1900âm3âsâ1, we investigated the related atmospheric circulation based on the 20th century reanalysis climate data (Version 3 and 2c, 20CRV3 and 2c) from NOAA/CIRES. These datasets cover the period 1836â2015 at a sub-daily scale (3âh) from around the globe at 2ââÃâ2â and provides relevant meteorological fields at different pressure levels (Compo et al., 2011). Thus, the climate analysis is restricted to floods occurring during this period. First, we extracted several ensemble mean fields at a daily scale from the surface and troposphere level, such as geopotential height, wind components, divergence and specific moisture up to 250âhPa. This information was used to carry out composite analyses of mean monthly anomalies (with regard to 1980â2010) to describe the general situation during flood events. Then, we investigated the source of moisture triggering floods at a daily scale. To this end, we compute the vertically integrated water vapour transport (IVT) for the region 0â90ââN, â100â20ââE, as suggested by Lavers et al.Â (2012) (Eq.Â 1), and plot the wind vector.\n\n(1) IVT = 1 g â« 1000 hPa 300 hPa q u d p 2 + 1 g â« 1000 hPa 300 hPa q v d p 2 ,\n\nwhere g is the gravitational constant (mâsâ2), q is the specific humidity (kgâkgâ1), u and v are the zonal and meridional wind components (mâsâ1), and p is the pressure (hPa). The IVT (kgâmâ1sâ1) is estimated to be between the sea level pressure and 300âhPa. To account for the rainfallârunoff transformation time in the Duero basin, we computed the averaged IVT over the 10 preceding days to the maximum peak discharge. Moreover, we used the Katalog Der Grosswetterlagen Europas (1881â2004) to identify the predominant circulation pattern associated with each flood (Gestengabe and Werner, 2005). Since this catalogue starts in 1881, we assigned a likely circulation type pattern for floods that took place before 1880 based on the geopotential field from 20CRV3 (TableÂ S2, Fig.Â S3). Finally, we also used the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index to characterise the regional influence of the North Atlantic atmospheric circulation variability (Hurrell, 1995; BrÃ¶nnimann et al., 2008) on the historical flood events. The NAO index reflects the difference in anomalies of the sea level pressure between Gibraltar (south-western Iberian Peninsula) and Reykjavik (Iceland) stations, as has been used as a surrogate of temperature and precipitation winter pattern in the Iberian Peninsula (LÃ³pez-Moreno et al., 2011).\n\n5.1âMulti-decadal flood patterns and climate variability\n\nDocumentary flood records in Zamora are scarce during the early medieval period, coincident with the late Climatic Medieval Anomaly that is characterised by warm temperatures and high hydrological variability. The limited flood data suggest, however, the occurrence of exceptional floods such as the 1258 and 1264 events, the former with a magnitude similar to or exceeding the 1860 flood as it is interpreted from inscription at the doorpost in St. Claudio church. The 1258 flood was exceptional in terms of peak flow but also in extension affecting other Iberian Atlantic basins, at least the Tagus and Guadalquivir rivers (Benito et al., 2003). The lack of information of catastrophic flooding between 1270 and 1500 is common to other Iberian rivers, although it is likely related to the discontinuity of written reports and preservation of documentary archives prior to the 14th century (Barriendos and Rodrigo, 2006).\n\nThe temporal distribution of floods over the past 500Â years shows at least six flood-rich periods of 20â40-year duration, commonly separated by â¼60-year periods with scarce numbers of large floods. Climatically, this period corresponds to the Little Ice Age (1500â1850) that in Iberia is characterised by cold conditions with alternating wetâdry phases (Oliva et al., 2018). Flood-rich periods were identified between 1600 and 1640, 1730 and 1750, 1770 and 1790, 1850 and 1880, 1924 and 1948, and 1960 and 1980 (Fig.Â 3), coinciding with flood episodes in Atlantic Iberian rivers (Benito et al., 1996, 2003; Barriendos and Rodrigo, 2006) and overlapping in time with flood periods described in western European regions (BlÃ¶schl et al., 2020). The temporal pattern of these flood clusters suggests a multi-decadal natural variability in the atmospheric circulation, affecting both flood frequency and magnitude (Nobre et al., 2017). In western Iberia, excess of winter precipitation is related to a southern position of Atlantic storm tracks occurring during the negative mode of NAO (Trigo et al., 2014).\n\nA detailed hydroclimatic analysis driving these flood-rich periods reveals complexities and dissimilarities among them. The first two periods (1600â1640, 1730â1750) were also identified as decades with frequent dry years in spring (needed for agriculture) according to reported prayers and novenas in churches and processions for rain usually undertaken in March and early April (Ãlvarez-VÃ¡zquez, 1986). The second two periods (1770â1790, 1850â1880) were dominated by overall wet winterÂ years, although the total of rainyÂ years was never more than a quarter of the drought years (Ãlvarez-VÃ¡zquez, 1986). In the Douro River in Porto these two periods were also identified by their anomalous frequency and severity of floods (Alcoforado et al., 2021; Amorim et al., 2017) that include the largest flood on record (4â6Â DecemberÂ 1739), which reached a stage of 12âm in a bedrock section at the right margin just upstream of the Dom Luiz I Bridge (Loureiro, 1904; Taborda, 2006). In RÃ©gua the 1739 flood peak was estimated at 18â000âm3âsâ1, and in Porto (â¼105âkm downstream) it likely reached 20â000âm3âsâ1 (Silva and Oliveira, 2002).\n\nIn western Iberia, the relationship between temperature and precipitation tends to be negative as cyclonic conditions are related to moist and relatively warm air masses from the Atlantic. Indeed, there is a total absence of large floods during the Maunder minimum period (1645â1715), a period with lower air temperatures, that intriguingly reveal a link between low solar activity and decreased flood frequency in the Iberian Peninsula (Vaquero, 2004). In contrast, periods with more frequent floods in the western Iberian region coincide with transitions to cool and wet conditions associated with a southward migration of westerlies (Benito et al., 2015b).\n\nIn terms of flood magnitude, the Duero data suggest that the largest floods occurred at the onset and final stages of the Little Ice Age (LIA). In both instances, these floods are related to persistent rainfalls occurring during winter months. Interestingly, during the 16th and early 17th centuries, catastrophic floods occurred mainly in January and extraordinary floods in early spring (March), whereas at the final stage of the LIA the largest floods tend to occur between February and March (with the exception of the 1860 flood).\n\nThe flood magnitudes over the 20th century may be biased by the environmental changes (agricultural transformation in the early part of the century) and reservoir construction (since 1950s). The 1924â1948 flood-rich period took place during the early-20th-century warming (ETCW; 1910sâ1940s), a period of strong internal variability in the climate system, which featured an anomalous warming of the Arctic region impacting climate in northern Europe (BrÃ¶nnimann, 2009). Two periods (1924â1927, 1935â1941) of extraordinary winter floods (Q>1250âm3âsâ1) that took place during the ETCW could arguably make this event relevant also for future analogous warming phases (Ballesteros-CÃ¡novas et al., 2019). Over the late 20th century, the frequency of extraordinary flooding has decreased and mostly occurred in late winterâearly spring, which confirms the delay of flood peaks under a warming climate in Europe (BlÃ¶schl et al., 2019).\n\n5.2âAtmosphereâocean interaction leading to catastrophic flooding\n\nDuring the 18th century the largest flood occurred on 5Â DecemberÂ 1739, with an estimated peak of 2700âm3âsâ1. In this winter, a previous peak flow was already reported on 1Â November, with a likely discharge of 2000âm3âsâ1 and at least another peak documented in AprilÂ 1740 with lower magnitude (â¼1800âm3âsâ1). The reconstructed monthly NAO index (Luterbacher et al., 1999) shows negative values in the month previous to peaks, namely â1.27 (October), â1.47 (November), and â0.38 and â0.55 (March and April), that, together with â2.38 and â1.14 during January and February, show persistent meridional atmospheric zonal flow during that exceptional winter. Other years with severe flood peaks associated with high negative NAO index were January and March 1931 (â2.08 and â1.16 NAO) and January and May 1881 (â3.6 and â1.42). The 29Â DecemberÂ 1860 flood was preceded by a negative NAO index in November (â3.44) and December (â2.14) and continued into JanuaryÂ 1861 (â0.56). In the Tagus River, similarly large floods have been associated with a very high frequency of negative NAO mode during the initial 20â25âd before the flood peak (Salgueiro et al., 2013).\n\nThe negative NAO-like phases allow the arrival to the Iberian Peninsula of a frontal system bringing warmer and enriched moisture air masses. Our analyses highlighted that the source of this moisture is the Caribbean Sea, and that is the so-called atmospheric river structures (Ralph et al., 2017; Dacre et al., 2015; Waliser and Guan, 2017). Thus, most of the major floods recorded in Zamora (88â%) were linked to the occurrence of these phenomena. A similar mechanism for moisture input has been associated with intense floods in Portugal (Trigo et al., 2014) and to other large European rivers draining to the Atlantic Ocean (Lavers and Villarini, 2015; Ballesteros-CÃ¡novas et al., 2019). Rainfall events linked to the arrival of the ARs are generally related to the uplift forced by orography (Ralph et al., 2006), which is consistent with the mountain reliefs surrounding the Duero basin. Although the frequency, position and magnitude of ARs depends on planetary-scale phenomena (Ralph et al., 2011), the moisture transport capacity may be enhanced under climate change conditions as a consequence of an increase in the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere (Lavers et al., 2013), which could have consequences on climate predisposition for floods in the Duero basin.\n\nOur analyses also pointed out that floods were linked to warmer-than-normal air temperatures, as identified in the composite analyses in the Duero basin (Fig.Â S2). This is consistent with the cyclonic circulation and the advection of template air mass, especially with a south-west orientation (Trigo et al., 2014). Thus, our results suggest that at least 70â% of the major floods recorded were related to either western or southern cyclonic circulation patterns and at least in 14â% of the cases were related to southern and western meridional circulation patterns. This implies that snowmelt and/or rain on snow from the surrounding mountains could have contributed to additional runoff (Stewart, 2009). Therefore, these mechanisms were related to main triggering mechanisms of torrential floods in mountain streams in the Duero basin (Ballesteros-CÃ¡novas et al., 2015; MorÃ¡n-Tejeda et al., 2019). Moreover, during wet winters, characteristic of negative NAO-like phases (LÃ³pez-Moreno et al., 2007), a high soil moisture content prevalence in a large portion of the basin could have enabled a recharge of the groundwater system and therefore favoured the direct rainfallârunoff transformation (Berghuijs et al., 2019; Benito et al., 2010, 2011).\n\n5.3âThe significance of past floods in flood hazard analysis\n\nThe historic city of Zamora is highly sensitive to flood hazards and weather extremes as both have direct impacts on architectural and patrimonial assets and cultural landscapes. Reported evidence of flood incidence provides a rich event catalogue with descriptions of more than 88 historical floods over a period of 760Â years as well as 17 pre-instrumental observations on a gauged water-level scale and 99Â years of gauged continuous records.\n\nThe basic hypothesis in flood frequency analysis (FFA) incorporating historical information (non-systematic) is that a certain perception threshold of water level exists, and all the exceedances of this level over a specific time interval have been recorded (Benito et al., 2015a). Perception thresholds are typically related to river morphological elements (e.g. river banks, dikes) above which overflow produces damages reported in municipal and ecclesiastic act books (Stedinger and Cohn, 1986; Frances et al., 1994; Macdonald, 2013). For instance, in the Duero's documented floods, the perception threshold is the flood discharge overflowing riverbanks at Olivares, Horta, Frontis and CabaÃ±ales neighbourhoods that is â¼1900âm3âsâ1. EachÂ year, therefore, the Duero River was characterised as having a peak discharge either exceeding or not exceeding that perception threshold. In the qualitative historical classification without any further damage descriptions, such events correspond to extraordinary floods (Barriendos and MartÃ­n-Vide, 1998). Catastrophic floods involve higher damages that are typically recorded in epigraphic marks and/or reports of impacts on historic buildings. The scarce urban development of Zamora until the second half of the 19th century allows a temporal stability (from 1511 to 1872) of this perception threshold, which was confirmed for modern flood analogues of historical extraordinary and even catastrophic floods. Over the 408Â years prior to the continuous gauged record (1511â1919) there is evidence of 30 floods exceeding the perception threshold (1900âm3âsâ1), whereas 8 floods exceeded that discharge over the gauged period (1920â2018).\n\nMore important are the consequences of possible climate-related non-stationarity for estimating flood quantiles (Milly et al., 2008). The alternation of flood-rich and flood-poor periods identified during the last 500Â years implies differences in the statistic values over time. However, the problem affects both historic and modern gauge records with the advantage that the former includes a longer-term flood dataset (rich and poor flood periods), whereas there may be a bias in gauged data for specific flood patterns. For instance, seven catastrophic floods were recorded over the period 1920â1969, whereas only two occurred over 1970â2018, which results in strong differences in the 25-year flood, with 2500âm3âsâ1 and 1650âm3âsâ1, respectively. The gauged registers indicate a trend to decrease the magnitude of extreme floods since the 1970s; however, flood events such as those in 2001 (2075âm3âsâ1) and 2013 (1654âm3âsâ1) illustrate the occurrence of extreme flooding despite the peak discharge attenuation by reservoirs. The overall gauge record (1920â2018) estimates the 25-year flood to be at an intermediate value of 2105â2300âm3âsâ1. In the case of long-term historical records, multiple flood-rich and flood-poor periods are combined, giving averaged estimates for the flood quantile discharges (e.g. T 25Â years: 2140â2070âm3âsâ1).\n\nDue to the extensive historical records of the area, flood hazard assessment can be performed by integrating different flood sources, datasets and timescales. Moreover, the implementation of two independent methods (EMA and MLE) for fitting regression models to censored data together with two distribution functions (LP3 and Gumbel) allows the robustness of results to be tested for low-probability quantiles. In the case of the 1â% AEP flood (T=100Â years), both the HISTO dataset (511Â years) and the PREâSYST (147Â years) result in a similar discharge (2800âm3âsâ1), whereas the SYS dataset (99Â years) provides a range of 2800â3100âm3âsâ1. In the upper tail of the distribution, the 0.2â% AEP flood (T=500Â years) based on HISTO data is well constrained to 3410â3475âm3âsâ1, whereas a wide discharge range is obtained with PREâSYST (3230â3530âm3âsâ1), and it is even wider with the SYST dataset (3550â3910âm3âsâ1). The historical flood record indicates that, at least over the last 511Â years, only one flood reached a discharge of 3450âm3âsâ1 (1860 flood), which is within the range of the 0.2â% AEP flood, whereas the SYST dataset overestimates the quantile discharge (3910âm3âsâ1). In even rarer floods, the 0.1â% AEP based on the HISTO dataset was estimated in the range of 3640â3795âm3âsâ1, which fits the 3700âm3âsâ1 estimated for the 1258 flood, although that historical flood was not included in the frequency analysis.\n\nPrevious studies of FFA under the non-stationary framework have been applied to documentary flood datasets using climatic (e.g. NAO) and environmental indices (reservoir index) as external covariates (Machado et al., 2015). In such a non-stationary approach, historical flood frequency analysis over the last 300Â years shows fluctuations in the estimated flood quantiles at a decadal scale responding to a combination of multi-decadal coldâwarm cycles and interannual oceanâatmosphere interactions. However, such analysis is not easy to implement (e.g. LÃ³pez and FrancÃ©s, 2013), and it is beyond the aim of the present study. Alternative options using climate models and scenarios may generate even higher uncertainties on flood hazard and risk planning studies (Serinaldi and Kilsby, 2015). Lins and CohnÂ (2011) suggested that it is preferable to continue with simple (stationary) statistical models with well-understood limitations than use sophisticated models whose correspondence to reality is uncertain. In this debate, historical hydrology informs about timing and persistence of flood clusters and identifies the relationships of the largest floods with low-frequency atmospheric circulation and other environmental drivers, providing robust data of real floods that occurred at a centennial scale. In summary, a long-term FFA framework under stationary models provides good average values supported by flood extremes beyond century-scale climate cycles.\n\n5.4âPublic perception and risk culture\n\nFlooding of the Duero River has been a recurrent problem for the city of Zamora, with most reported incidents related to the medieval bridge, water mill facilities, ecclesiastic buildings, farms and houses. Despite the abundant flood documentation, details on the relative importance of each historic flood are not always available, and only for the most catastrophic events are there precise references to flood levels on epigraphic marks. The best-preserved epigraphic marks are located inside San Frontis Church and DueÃ±as Convent, which became a cloistered convent with difficult access for the public. Epigraphic marks are important elements for public perception in central Europe (BrÃ¡zdil et al., 2005; Herget and Meurs, 2010; Wetter et al., 2011; Elleder et al., 2013; Glaser et al., 2010) and in Mediterranean regions (Aldrete et al., 2007; CÅur and Lang, 2008; Barriendos et al., 2019), which are maintained as part of the historical asset. In Zamora flood marks are not well known to the public, and, in the modern urban expansion, some flood marks were removed during restoration works of architectural assets. For instance, the 1860 flood mark disappeared from the old city gate (Puerta del Pescado) when, due to traffic problems, the old monument was moved to a new location in 1909. Curiously, in a municipal council meeting (29Â JanuaryÂ 1908), a city councillor (Eusebio CalongeÂ SansÃ³, cited in Heraldo de Zamora, 30 January 1908âââââââ) proposed to preserve the 1860 flood mark at its place for the public memory of that extreme flood. In that time, five floods over 2000âm3âsâ1 were recorded in a 30-year period (1880 to 1909) that kept alive the public perception of flood risk and its socio-economic consequences. It also corroborates a well-established observation that occurrence of a damaging flood improves awareness and social learning and enhances adaptation (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015). Conversely, over the last 40 years, only the 2001 flood exceeded 2000âm3âsâ1, and since the 1980s there is strong socio-economic pressure to expand urban occupation in the San Frontis, Olivares and CabaÃ±ales suburbs. Fortunately, the remarkable work on historical flood data collection done by MarquinaÂ (1949a, b) preserved the details on the location and position of epigraphic marks no longer at their original sites.\n\nWithin the framework of the European Flood Directive (2007/60/EC), EU member states are requested to map flood hazards (typically 100-year and 500-year floods) as well as consider the effects of climate change on flood risks. The climate effect on flood hazards is complex and not ubiquitous within a world that increases population, exposure and vulnerability (Kundzewicz et al., 2019). Recent developments on climate change science and adaptation actions focus on winâwin strategies for sustainable climate action. The study of past flooding, either historic or palaeofloods, can be a direct guide to flood possibilities for adaptation actions to extreme flooding under climate change as it reveals what is actually possible under conditions of centennial climate variability (BrÃ¡zdil et al., 2012; Macdonald, 2013). The flood magnitudes result neither from complex climate models nor from probabilistic language, difficult to understand for the general public. Common sense holds that what has really happened can happen again (Baker, 2008). This approach based on past flood occurrences also serves to increase public confidence in any proposed solution that ultimately involves a large economic or social expense for hazard mitigation.\n\nAires, C., Pereira, D.
