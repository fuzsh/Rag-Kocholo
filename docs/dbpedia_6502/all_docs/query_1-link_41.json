        "text": "Planning a trip to the land of tapas? Make sure you know the best time to visit Spain based on tourist trends, weather, and the fun happenings of this crazy cool country.\n\nIn this article, I’m going to walk you through the best time to visit Spain, and give you a breakdown on the best things to see and do per month!\n\nIf you’re looking for a quick answer on when the best time to visit is, our recommendation is to visit during the spring or fall is best as you’ll have mild weather, less crowds, and plenty of activities to keep you occupied.\n\nHowever, keep on reading this article to decide for yourself!\n\nThe best time to visit Spain is during the spring months of March to May or during the autumn between September and November.\n\nDuring these times, you’ll have pleasant weather, way less crowds, decent prices, and plenty to do! Plus, since these times are the off-season, accommodation will typically be cheaper, you’ll have a much easier time getting a dinner reservation, and you won’t have to spend half of your day waiting in line for the next attraction.\n\nSpring is an especially good time to visit as it’s often warm enough to hit the beach, and there are tons of festivals and events going on that shouldn’t be missed!\n\nHowever, no matter when you visit Spain, you won’t be disappointed. Year round, there’s delicious food, unbelievable museums, and a culture that’s well worth immersing yourself in. Just note that during off-season between November and March, you may find that businesses and restaurants have shortened hours.\n\nTravel Hack: To save money for your trip to Spain, check out the WayAway+ membership which gives you access discounts and cash backs when booking flights, tours, and hotels!\n\nWhat You Should Know When Planning a Trip to Spain\n\nBesides spring and fall, there’s a little more you should know when it comes to planning a trip to Spain. Keep this information in mind, and you won’t have to deal with any unpleasant surprises along the way.\n\nYou can opt to travel Spain independently or opt to join these multi-day tour from seasoned experts like G-Adventures. This Tapas and Flamenco Tour around Spain and Portugal is something we have been itching to do.\n\nWhatever you do, make sure that you bring appropriate clothing. There is nothing worse than being too hot (or too cold!) Check out our Europe Packing List guide to make sure you don’t leave anything behind.\n\nWhen is Peak Season in Spain?\n\nWhen it comes to tourism, peak season in Spain is during the sun-kissed summer months. You can expect hoards of people throughout the country during July and August, all eager to drink some sangria and hit the beach.\n\nDuring the summer, you’ll find that prices are much higher than any other time of the year, especially when it comes to flights and accommodation. To combat this, plan your trip early and book everything far in advance. It still won’t be cheap, but it should be less expensive than planning a last-minute trip during the busiest months of the year.\n\nThat said, just because it’s peak season doesn’t mean you won’t be able to find some peace and quiet while you travel through Spain. Tons of locals leave the country during the summer to escape the Spanish heat (and tourists), or head to the coastal beaches to cool off.\n\nYou may find yourself pleasantly surprised when you have an entire side street to yourself on the hunt for the best tapas.\n\nWhat’s the Weather Like in Spain?\n\nThe weather in Spain is generally pretty mild all-year long, besides the summer when it gets hot, hot, hot.\n\nIf you’re visiting Spain in winter, you can expect the temperatures to be around 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the country, but they will steadily rise as you move into spring and summer months.\n\nDuring the summer, a typical day is around 90 degrees, so be sure to pack plenty of sunhats! If you’re looking to escape the heat in the heat of summer, head to northern Spain where temperatures are closer to 70 and 80 degrees. Otherwise, the beach it is!\n\nThe beach is understandably quite crazy in the summer, as everyone is scrambling to cool off in the pristine Spanish waters. This is why it’s actually best to avoid hitting the beach between July and August, and going during the spring instead!\n\nBeaches during May and June are much more quiet than during peak season, and you can still enjoy warm weather. You can also hit the beaches on the other end of peak season between the end of August until October. The weather may be cooling off, but it’s still balmy enough to take a dip!\n\nIf you’re looking for warm weather year-round, you can generally find it along the coast. The Gran Canary Islands are also an ideal pick for a beach getaway, sunbathing, and ocean swimming any time of year!\n\nFestivals and Popular Events in Spain\n\nSpain is well-known for hosting some of the most unique, exciting festivals and events every single year. It’s not uncommon to plan a trip around one of these festivals so that you can get in on the action!\n\nMost of the popular events in Spain happen during the spring and summer, such as La Tomatina, Feria de Malaga, and Las Fallas De Valencia. But you can also find a bunch in the off-season like the Grape Harvest in Rioja and Carnival. Check out our list of top Spain festivals for more information.\n\nRegardless of which festival is on your bucket list, it’s best to plan far in advance as it’s likely going to draw in crowds from around the world. Book your hotel and flights early, and have tickets if needed! You don’t want to miss out.\n\nA Month-by-Month Guide to Visiting Spain\n\nTo help you decide when is the best time to visit Spain, here’s a breakdown of what goes on in the country month by month. Alternatively, you can also check out our full Spain Travel guide.\n\nBesides the weather, you’ll be able to choose when to go based on activities available and famous festivals that will round out your holiday.\n\nJanuary – Ideal for Winter Activities\n\nAverage Temperature: 45 – 60°F\n\nHighlights: Not many tourists | Cheap accommodation | Winter activities\n\nFestivals: Three Kings Day | San Sebastian Festival\n\nThis is definitely during the height of Spain’s offseason. The weather is chilly, but on the upside, there aren’t a ton of tourists so you can sightsee without constantly bumping into others. If that’s not enough, hotels and accommodation are typically less expensive in January because there isn’t much demand.\n\nIf you’re a winter sports lover, January is a perfect time to head out to the Sierra Nevada mountains for some skiing, snowboarding, or fireside tapas. There’s also plenty of snowshoeing and snowmobiling in the Pyrenees and Picos de Europa for different mountain views.\n\nIf you prefer to enjoy the mountains from a distance, there’s still plenty to do like warming up with a hearty cooking class or taking advantage of the post-Christmas shopping deals!\n\nFinally, you can find a couple of festivals in January like Three Kings Day on the 6th which is accompanied by celebrations around the Balearic Islands, and the San Sebastian Festival which is famous for residents taking to the streets with their Tamborrada drumming!\n\nFebruary – Party during Carnival in Spain!\n\nAverage Temperature: 50 – 62°F\n\nHighlights: Carnival | Flamenco\n\nFestivals: Carnival | Festival de Jerez\n\nFebruary is still pretty quiet in Spain with decently cold temperatures, especially in Madrid and other northern cities like Bilbao and Galicia. It’s also rainy pretty much all of the time, which is why most people opt to hit the south of Spain when planning a trip in February.\n\nThat being said, February is famed for being the month of Carnival, which celebrates the beginning of Lent. There are tons of events throughout Spain, with big parties in places like Cadiz and the Canary Islands.\n\nPut on a flouncy dress and your dancing shoes because Carnival means sangria and dancing!\n\nSpeaking of dancing, the Festival de Jerez is also in February and it’s one of the most well-known flamenco festivals in Spain. It’s a great way to experience Spanish culture while watching shows and listening to the stomp of heels. Flamenco fanatics — February is for you!\n\nMarch – Experience Unique Spanish Festivals\n\nAverage Temperature: 60 – 70°F\n\nHighlights: Beginning of spring | Not too crowded yet | Good time for hiking\n\nFestivals: Las Fallas | Sant Medir | Semana Santa\n\nThe weather in Spain in March can be unpredictable, so you never really know if you need your swim trunks or fleece. But then again, the start of spring is always unpredictable!\n\nMarch officially marks the beginning of spring which is one of the most beautiful times to visit Spain. Trees start to bud and blossom, there are flowers abound, and of course some rain to round things out.\n\nMarch is an awesome time to visit Spain as it’s right before it starts getting busy. Intimately enjoy museums before the tour groups roll in, and hit the hiking trails before it gets blisteringly hot.\n\nNot to mention, there are some unbelievable festivals during this time of year.\n\nA trip to Valencia during this month is a must as the week-long Las Fallas Festival is one of the most notable things to see in Spain. You’ll get to see a huge parade of giant figurines before they’re set on fire. It’s unique, totally Spanish, and an event that can’t be missed.\n\nOther festivals during March include the Sant Medir festival in Barcelona, where horse-drawn carriages filled with Spaniards throw treats to the people in the Garcia neighborhood. There’s also Semana Santa, the most Holy Week of the year. It’s a massive religious celebration throughout Spain during Easter, and can last for more than a week!\n\nApril – Prime Time for Adventure Activities\n\nAverage Temperature: 65 – 75°F\n\nHighlights: Warm, comfortable weather | Not too crowded | Adventure activities\n\nFestivals: Feria de Abril | Festimad | Feria del Queso\n\nAnother month of unpredictable weather, but certainly the warmest of the year so far.\n\nIn April, people in Andalusia start heading to the beach and restaurant terraces slowly fill up with eager diners ready for a taste of spring on the patio. Despite the weather being good, the wave of summer tourists still hasn’t hit yet, so this is a great time to visit before things get too crowded!\n\nEnjoy sightseeing and sitting outside enjoying a coffee in the city square, or hit the hiking trails to see spring budding in Spanish nature.\n\nApril is a prime time for adventure activities like mountain biking, rock climbing, quad tours, and helicopter flights as the weather is ideal for being outside.\n\nThe warm weather also brings fun festivals, like the Feria de Abril, a spring fair in Seville that showcases Spanish culture and has endless entertainment. There’s also a huge music festival in Madrid called Festimad during which you get a different concert every night!\n\nLast but not least, if you’re a cheese lover, Spain in April should certainly be on your bucket list as there’s the Feria del Queso in Trujillo, which is a three-day cheese festival.\n\nNo, you’re not dreaming… April is definitely one of the best months to visit Spain!\n\nMay – Perfect Weather and the Start of Bullfighting Season\n\nAverage Temperature: 70 – 80°F\n\nHighlights: Beautiful weather | Warm beaches | Hiking | Bullfighting season\n\nFestivals: Bullfighting | Madrid Open\n\nOne of the most beautiful months to visit Spain, the weather in May is simply superb. You’ll have warm and clear, sunny days with cooler evenings, perfect for city strolls of walks along the beach.\n\nThis is the month when the beaches start to fill up in the south, but the rest of the country experiences divine weather as well. Head down to enjoy a last bit of peace before the crowds of summer tourists roll in!\n\nThis is one of the last times you’ll be able to enjoy hiking without absolutely dripping in sweat, so be sure to head to the trails if you’re visiting in May! You can also comfortably enjoy activities like paragliding, a hot air balloon tour or even some water sports without the stress of getting too cold.\n\nWhat the month of May is probably best known for is the beginning of bullfighting season. If bullfighting isn’t your thing (not blaming you there), you can hit the Madrid Open, which is Spain’s largest tennis tournament, and also held annually in May.\n\nMay is also the month of the Cordoba Patios Festival, which is celebrated with events, parades, flower “wars”, and patio contests for residents to show off the finest of spring on their doorsteps!\n\nJune – Spain Heats Up!\n\nAverage Temperature: 77 – 90°F\n\nHighlights: Warm weather | Kite-surfing | Terrace coffees and dining\n\nFestivals: Water and Ham Festival | Photo Espana\n\nJune is when you start to get guaranteed good weather in Spain.\n\nGone are the days of carrying a raincoat around, because you can typically expect warm, sunny days, every day throughout Spain. While not officially peak season, this is when the tourists begin to roll in, and it’s immediately noticeable at attractions like museums, cathedrals, and even the beach.\n\nIt’s also quite apparent in the price of flight tickets, hotel prices, and even the amount being charged around town. Prices tend to skyrocket as businesses prepare for peak season, so you better get your reservation nice and early.\n\nJust make sure that whatever you book has air conditioning!\n\nSome events you can keep your eyes out for if you’re visiting in June are the Water and Ham Festival in Granada which is your chance to participate in a good old Spanish water fight; and Photo Espana in Madrid, an international photo exhibition that’s the largest in the country.\n\nIf you’re looking for a little bit of active fun, June is also the best time to head to Tarifa for some kite-surfing. The wind is stellar and the waters aren’t too crowded yet, so it’s the perfect time to learn!\n\nJuly – Peak Season Arrives\n\nAverage Temperature: 80 – 100°F\n\nHighlights: Beach! | Full hours of operation | Lots of festivals and events\n\nFestivals: San Fermin | Sanlucar de Barrameda | Benicassim Festival\n\nHello, Peak Season! This is without a doubt the busiest time of year in Spain as the entire country is packed north to south with tapas-eating tourists.\n\nIt’s also the hottest time of the year, so most locals in the inland cities make their way to the coast for some sea breezes and ocean views. You can visit Spain in July, but you should expect huge crowds everywhere, extremely expensive hotels and flights (book way in advance!), and long waits when it comes to dinner time.\n\nHowever, July isn’t all bad…\n\nThe country really comes alive to cater to everyone who’s come for a visit. Restaurants and business operate on full hours, there’s always something to do or see, and there are plenty of festivals and events to attend for a huge dose of Spanish culture.\n\nIn July, you’ve got San Fermin, aka the running of the bulls, which goes on in Pamplona from the 6th of the month until the 14th. It’s quite a wild sight to witness and is definitely worth attending if you’re in the area.\n\nSummer is also a popular time to visit Tarifa where you can enjoy kite surfing, beach days, and much more!\n\nIf you prefer horses, you can watch races on the beach in Sanlucar de Barrameda at this other annual event.\n\nOne last unforgettable option for events to hit in July is the Benicassim Festival, a huge four-day music festival held between Valencia and Barcelona. Get tickets in advance because the lineup is always fantastic!\n\nAugust – Time to Hit the Beach!\n\nAverage Temperature: 80 – 100°F\n\nHighlights: Best beach weather | Basque country is best | La Tomatina\n\nFestivals: La Tomatina | Semana Grande\n\nAugust rounds out the hottest time of the year, with more and more locals hitting the coast. If a beach getaway is what you’re looking for, Spain has some awesome beaches that are just perfect for a seaside holiday.\n\nPlaces like Seville, Madrid, and Granada are significantly less packed than the islands or coast of Spain as it’s too hot and dry to be landlocked. For this reason, you may find restaurants and businesses closed for the summer holiday, only to reopen when the weather cools down a bit.\n\nIf you’re looking for great places to visit in August, try Galicia, Basque country, and Asturias, where the weather is still beautiful without being too hot to handle. Take an awesome drive through northern Spain to check out the sights, and don’t forget to eat some pintxos while you’re up there!\n\nHowever, what really brings people to Spain in August is the one-of-a-kind annual festivals held during this month.\n\nThe most famous is probably La Tomatina, which is basically a giant tomato fight among thousands of people. It’s held in Bunol on the last Wednesday in August, so mark your calendars!\n\nAnother well-known August festival is Semana Grande in Bilbao and San Sebastian which shows off the finest of the Basque region. You can expect bullfighting extravaganzas, giant puppet dances, and fireworks lighting up the night sky to end every day.\n\nSeptember – Summer (and Peak Season) Winds Down\n\nAverage Temperature: 75 – 90°F\n\nHighlights: Less tourists | Grape harvests for wine | Inland cities have finally cooled down\n\nFestivals: San Mateo Festival | Festa de la Merce\n\nThe end of peak season, and officially the end of summer, but Spain remains hot pretty much through the end of the month. However, it’s certainly more bearable than July and August, making September a lovely time to visit when the busiest time of the year is winding down.\n\nYou can go back to visiting inland places like Madrid and Cordoba, as well as wandering around other central cities without feeling as if you’re going to melt.\n\nOne of the best reasons to visit Spain in September is for the wine. This month is harvest season for some of Spain’s finest wines, so it’s a great time to head out to vineyards and taste the latest vintage!\n\nThere are plenty of vineyard and wine tours that will take you around a region for tastings, or you can venture out on your own for some sipping and snacking at whichever winery is closest.\n\nSpeaking of wine, in the La Rioja region every September, there’s the San Mateo Festival, which is a week of music, dancing, fun and of course, endless amounts of wine to celebrate the local harvest.\n\nWhat could be more magical than that?! You can even use your feet to crush grapes at this event, one of the most traditional winemaking methods!\n\nIf you’re spending your September closer to Barcelona, be sure to head into the city for the Festa de la Merce, one of the largest festivals which celebrates Barcelona’s patron saint. Again, you’ll have a ton of wine here (which will make up for not heading to La Rioja), cultural events, and fireworks.\n\nFor even more culture, grab tickets to the San Sebastian Film Fest, also held during September, where you can watch films, catch sights of stars, and enjoy Basque country.\n\nAll of this goes to show that September is a simply magical time to visit Spain.\n\nOctober – Best Time to Visit Andalusia\n\nAverage Temperature: 65 – 75°F\n\nHighlights: Way less tourists | Pleasant weather | Good time to visit Andalusia | Surfing in Northern Spain\n\nFestivals: Bienal de Flamenco | Week of Architecture\n\nThe weather starts to cool off and the cities begin to empty, so October is the perfect time to visit Spain if you can’t stand the heat or the crowds of summer.\n\nOctober is the best time to head to inland cities like Madrid and Salamanca as they’re finally cool enough from the summer, but not as cold as they get in the heart of winter.\n\nThis is also a lovely time to pay the likes of Frigiliana in Andalusia a visit. You can still experience a decent amount of sun with more empty cities than you’ll find in the summer, making for the perfect quiet escape.\n\nFor those who can’t stand to be out of the water, make your way to the north of Spain, where October brings some of the best surfing during the year! But you’ll definitely want to pack a wetsuit as it can get chilly out there.\n\nOctober is also an ideal time to go hiking as you’ll be able to immerse yourself in the fall foliage along the trails.\n\nIn terms of events, October is home to the Bienal de Flamenco in Seville, the largest flamenco festival in Spain. Besides being great fun, just keep in mind that it only happens once every two years!\n\nYou can also head to Madrid for the Week of Architecture, which is great for any building fanatics looking to experience exhibits or workshops in some of the city’s most famous buildings.\n\nNovember – Enjoy the Off-Season with Less Crowds\n\nAverage Temperature: 55 – 65°F\n\nHighlights: Quiet city wandering | Fun festivals | Virtually no crowds\n\nFestivals: International Sherry Festival | Jazz Festival\n\nFinally, Spain gets some peace and quiet from the summer as the country prepares for the Christmas season. November is relatively quiet and cold, but there’s still plenty to do throughout Spain that makes it a worthy time for a visit.\n\nTake a tour around Andalusia to visit local villages, or head to Ronda, a stunning town made famous by Hemmingway’s description as the “most romantic town in Spain.” November is the best time to spend your time wandering around in the crisp, cool weather before the winter chill really hits.\n\nThere’s plenty going on in terms of events in November, like the International Sherry Festival in Jerez (drink responsibly!) and the Jazz Festival in Madrid that draws people in from all across the world.\n\nIn terms of Spanish culture, November is a great time to visit for the Fiesta de La Almundena, held in Madrid. During this event, you’ll get to experience Spanish culture from long ago and spot Madrileños in their traditional dress!\n\nNo matter where you choose, you’ll be pleasantly surprised on a trip to Spain in November.\n\nDecember – Celebrate the Holiday Season Spanish-style!\n\nAverage Temperature: 45 – 60°F\n\nHighlights: Holiday season & spirit throughout Spain!\n\nFestivals: Christmas Markets | Malaga Light Displays\n\nThe weather in December greatly varies, depending on where you are in Spain.\n\nOn one hand, you can be skiing through the snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountains, while on the other hand you can be lying on a Carribean-like beach. The choice is yours!\n\nTo close out the year, December is the time for Christmas festivities throughout the country. Think lively spirits, colorful lights, and widespread celebrations wherever you go. Doesn’t get much better than a Spanish holiday season, now does it?\n\nOne of the most delightful parts of December in Spain is the vast number of Christmas markets spread throughout the country. These markets are filled with trinkets for sale, delectable bites to eat, and warm drinks galore.\n\nYou can find the best (and biggest) ones in Barcelona or Seville but plenty of smaller cities and towns have them as well as the holiday approaches.\n\nYou can also find a wild light display in Malaga in December, with bright strings of fairy bulbs lighting the city every evening.\n\nIf you’re seeking a sandy Christmas rather than a snowy one, December is the perfect time to head to the islands for a warmer holiday season. However, if you’re staying landlocked, there’s plenty to do to celebrate the holiday and ring in the New Year as well.\n\nThe best place to celebrate the new year is to head to Puerto del Sol in Madrid for an experience similar to one you’d have in Times Square on December 31st. There are massive crowds of people, all gathered to party until the clock strikes midnight.\n\nThe tradition here is to eat 12 grapes, one for each chime, to welcome the New Year! There’ll be bright lights, music, dancing, and plenty of festivities, so be sure to make this a part of your plan if visiting Spain during this time of year.\n\nFor a magical trip to Spain, go in December!\n\nAs you can see, each month in Spain brings something different to the table. Whether you’re looking for less crowds, the perfect weather, exciting festivals, or all three, you’ll be able to plan a trip to incorporate it all.\n\nAll of this goes to say that the best time to visit Spain is based on personal preference and what you’re looking to get out of your trip.\n\nSpain really is the land of wonders, with endless amounts of surprises in store for those who visit. No matter when you go, you’re sure to fall in love with this magnificent country but just remember… avoid peak season if possible!\n\nAccommodations Around Spain\n\nLooking for different options on where to stay in Spain?
