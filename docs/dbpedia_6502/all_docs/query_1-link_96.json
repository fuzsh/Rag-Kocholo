Higher temperatures affect us much more at higher humidity, and colder temperatures feel piercing with high winds. Our perceived temperatures factor in humidity and wind chill to better represent how hot or cold the day feels to a person.\n\nAverage Salamanca Temperatures by Month\n\nDaily highs (averaged for the month) usually give the best indication of the weather. A significantly lower mean and low generally just means it gets colder at night.\n\nPrecipitation (Rain or Snow)\n\nIf dry weather is what you’re after, the months with the lowest chance of significant precipitation in Salamanca are February, January, and then November. Note that we define “significant precipitation” as .1 inches or more in this section. The lowest chance of rain or snow occurs around early to mid February. For example, on the week of February 12th there is 1 day of precipitation on average. By contrast, it’s most likely to rain or snow in mid May with an average of 3 days of significant precipitation the week of May 14th.\n\nWhen can you find snow in Salamanca?
