My pack is currently about 7.5kg without snacks and water. I worry that is too much and I should leave some stuff home. I will be walking from Salamanca and leave in just 4 days!\n\nI do run hot while actually walking but I tend to freeze when at rest/hanging inside. I feel I need everything on this list, perhaps I will be convinced otherwise by you. I really don't believe I need to add anything.\n\nI'm starting to become very nervous for the physical aspect and my Spanish. Any words of encouragement welcome! I'm sure it will all turn out alright but I am a worrier.\n\nThank you in advance to all who read this silly post.\n\nThe list as follows:\n\nWearing:\n\nWarm leggings\n\nMerino wool tank dress (homemade)\n\nMerino wool long sleeve shirt\n\nUndies & bra\n\nSock liners and darn tough wool socks\n\nwool buff\n\nlightweight beanie hat\n\naltra lone peak shoes\n\nfannypack with phone/documents/powerbank\n\nInside Bag:\n\nGossamer Gear Mariposa\n\nDown sleeping quilt with silk liner (UGQ bandit quilt)\n\nArcteryx Proton LT (warm clean layer for nights and mornings)\n\nPatagonia zip fleece (for walking when cold)\n\nWoolpower 200 long sleeve (clean warm layer for nights/and sleep)\n\n2 merino wool long sleeves (my everyday base layers)\n\nKuhl warm legging (walking spare to trade off)\n\n3 undies\n\n2 bras (slow to dry)\n\n2 sock liners\n\n2 darn tough socks\n\nLight fleece sleep pant\n\nCotton t shirt for sleep\n\nArcteryx rain coat\n\nlight rain pants\n\nwool buff #2\n\nrunning gloves\n\nsarong\n\nshammy (as towel)\n\nlaundry soap tabs from sea to summit\n\nToiletries:\n\ntoothbrush & paste travel size\n\nmuscle rub (icy hot or biofreeze)\n\nlush shampoo\n\nDr bronners liquid soap\n\nhairbrush\n\nsmall deodorant and body glide\n\nfeminine products\n\npain killers\n\ntissues and wetwipes\n\neyemask\n\nOthers:\n\nsunglasses\n\njournal\n\nguidebook\n\nkindle\n\nheadlamp\n\ngearties\n\nultrasil backpack\n\nshopping bag\n\npack rain cover\n\ndirty girl gaiters\n\ncrocs\n\ncharger cords for watch kindle headphones phone\n\nheadphones\n\nblow up neck pillow for airplane\n\nballcap\n\nosprey 2 liter bladder (wont fill it up all the way)\n\na couple ultrasil dry bags for organization/waterproof\n\nMost things are pictured other then sleeping back and pack and shoes/crocs.\n\nI list three shirts and three sets of socks/undies/bras as less laundry the better and it may not all dry overnight in winter.\n\nLooks good to me.\n\nA bit much on underwear, accessories and sleep, but i have not yet walked a camino in winter. 7,5kg baseweight should put you on the lower end of the spectrum for that time. I'd personally would leave a few items and buy what i feel is missing, but i am more of populated camino person, no idea how much shops are on the sanabres. I sent my kindle home (and a few other things), but again, that was Frances in late spring. Different story.\n\nJust a tiny thing: You can use Dr.Bronners for laundry too... might shave a few grams from the tablets. (and i use it as shampoo too, but i guess its a guy thing)\n\nedit: ultrasil backpack and shopping bag are redundant. another couple grams saved\n\nThank you for the well thought out response! It's true that every gram saved is helpful so I will use your tips. I won't give up my shampoo; but using bronners for laundry is something I'm willing to try!\n\nI will again reassess my clothing...as much as I don't want to give anything up it may be worth it in the end. I think the shops will be adequate as I will be passing through more then one big city. It is better to take less and buy it if I need it.\n\nI am a little confused when I try to figure out the layering options. Please understand that I have no objections to your list, for you, but will offer some comments in case you want to reduce your load.\n\nI appreciate your comments! I understand you have no objections, I will share my mental justifications for my layers I have added.\n\nArcteryx Proton LT (warm clean layer for nights and mornings)\n\nPatagonia zip fleece (for walking when cold)\n\nAren't the above 2 items rather redundant? They both can serve under your rain jacket, or for warmth whenever, but you would never need both.\n\nSo I suppose they kind of are redundant? You're right I probably would never wear both at the same time, unless on the airplane when I freeze. In my head I want both because the proton is way too hot to walk in but I'd like it at night. The zip fleece I could see myself walking in when its colder out. Its hard to plan for the unknown of weather. Right now it does look like I may have a good window of weather. If I were to give up one I guess it would be the zip fleece.\n\nWoolpower 200 long sleeve (clean warm layer for nights/and sleep)\n\n2 merino wool long sleeves (my everyday base layers)\n\nWill the above 3 shirts be layered in addition to your listed walking outfit or your evening wear? You will need one shirt as your dinner/evening wear, to be combined with either the Arcteryx or Patagonia for warmth and topped by the rain jacket when you go outside. You can wear your dinner/evening shirt to bed if it is cold. Maybe 2 of these would be nice to have, but I don't see the need for 3.\n\nThe 3 wool long sleeves wouldn't be worn together. I have long debated my need for 3 baselayers. They would be my rotating dinner shirt and walking shirts. I was thinking of having three to only do laundry every other day... or for wear one was one spare one? This may be completely unnecessary and I should drop one. Each is 150g.\n\nThe woolpower is more of a lofty sweater that I would wear over a baselayer or by itself with a bra. Basically a clean warmth layer I was hoping not to walk in. Again I should just choose between this or the zip fleece.\n\nI've read that you pack your insecurities. I suppose I fear not having clean dry clothes to put on after a long days work!\n\nKuhl warm legging (walking spare to trade off)\n\nDo you need this spare? In emergency (i.e. walking pair is wet, or it is extremely cold) you can always layer up with your fleece sleeping pants and rain pants. Or can you wear the spare leggings to sleep in?\n\nJust some ideas!\n\nYou make a good point. I could wear spare leggings to sleep in and drop the fleece pants. They are very lightweight and comfier for sleep but are starting to wear thin and I could walk in them in an emergency. I should only take one or the other.\n\nI feel like you maybe talked me into seriously rethinking some items. I had arguments and justifications for every piece but in the end I still was packing for the worst case scenario or \"what-ifs\"\n\nI'd rather keep my back and knees happy in the long run.\n\nHi! Please understand that posting a list is not opening yourself up to criticism and good on you for being open to advice. I dont understand a lot of your clothing (brands) and my internet is pretty poor at the moment so wont google.\n\nI have walked the CF twice in winter (with my family). what works for me is:\n\nwalking:\n\n- a light synthetic cami (adds warmth, dries super fast and I dont like the feel of merino against my skin, 1 long sleeve merino, a zip up polar fleece jacket and a gortex rain/wind coat. I also wore a buff, ear muffs ( like a wide headband style, not like headphones), merino sock. I was always warm enough.

And, you can always purchase stuff there if you need something you forgot. Have a wonderful trip.\n\nBuen Camino.\n\nI have walked the CF twice in winter (with my family). what works for me is:\n\nwalking:\n\n- a light synthetic cami (adds warmth, dries super fast and I dont like the feel of merino against my skin, 1 long sleeve merino, a zip up polar fleece jacket and a gortex rain/wind coat. I also wore a buff, ear muffs ( like a wide headband style, not like headphones), merino sock. I was always warm enough. You can expect to be a little on the cold side as you step out but walking and carrying a pack will see you nice and warm within 10 mins.\n\npack: cami/singlet, 1 long and one short sleeve merino, 2 extra pairs of each: bra and undies and socks. (I took other things as well, eg prescription medication, sun block, lip balm and a spare, face cream, body moisturizer - non negotiables!) warm hiking pants.\n\nSleep: long johns and the shirt I would wear the next day. I had an extra pair of long johns but did not need them.\n\nThank you for posting your experience. It's nice to see what's worked for you as you've been through this before. I will defiantly utilize most of this advice!\n\nwool buff #2 - just need 1\n\nrunning gloves - the warmer the better - gortex if possible to keep the rain out as much as possible\n\nsarong - why?\n\nshammy (as towel)\n\nlaundry soap tabs from sea to summit - Love to know how these work for you\n\nToiletries:\n\nmuscle rub - I lugged a tub around hardly used- are you sure you will need it - can be bought along the way\n\nhairbrush - will a comb suffice?\n\npain killers - definitely AND buy them along the way!!\n\ntissues and wetwipes - do you need wet wipes?\n\neyemask - personal choice\n\nAlso personal choice, but we always take nail clippers!\n\nkindle - can you download kindle on your phone - you will probably get used to it pretty fast\n\nheadlamp - I have taken one twice never used it.

The sarong was for after shower as my towel is very tiny so its nice to wrap up in something before dressing. Perhaps I will leave it at home though.\n\nI'll buy different gloves there I think. Something cheap from Decathalon that will be warmer then these.\n\nI'll leave the muscle rub and buy if needed.\n\nMy hair is waist length and I need to braid it everyday or its a problem... Unfortunately I need a brush!\n\nNail clippers are listed but they are packed! I'm diligent about those as I rock climb.\n\nI will bring my kindle. I read a lot and every night before bed. This is already a sacrifice as I typically have a paperback or two with me too!\n\nThanks for all these great tips and pointers.\n\nJust a few thoughts from what we did. 7.5kg is a fair weight for a winter camino, ours were about that weight too.\n\nGlad to hear my weight may already be spot on. Very encouraging. But I will still be leaving some things back for sure.\n\nHope you have a wonderful, wonderful walk and dont forget to tell us about it along the way\n\nThank you Gumba! Maybe I should do journal entries or similar on this forum to keep my notes organized and share my experiences.\n\nI walked the Camino last month, it was gray, rainy and chilly.\n\nhaha, This is what I'm expecting. Sun would be nice if I'm lucky! I live somewhere gray, rainy, and chilly. I look forward to seeing new the sights!\n\nIf I were to do it again I would only pack the following:\n\n...\n\nThis is most helpful! I really appreciate you taking the time! I'd love to hear about your trip sometime. You did it post covid and during winter, I've only seen a couple accounts of this yet.\n\nI brought too many \"just in case\" things that I never used.
