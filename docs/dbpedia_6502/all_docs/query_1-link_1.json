        "text": "Salamanca has a Mediterranean climate typical of Spain, although one that comprises extremes- the city experiences severely cold winters and scorching hot summers. November to March is considered the cold season, whereas the months from June to September make up the summer. As such, spring and autumn are relatively short seasons.\n\nThe average yearly temperatures are highs of 18ºC and lows of 5.5ºC, with a daily average of 11ºC. Salamanca is a sunny city, averaging 2500 hours of sunshine per year, and rainfall is a fairly low 43mm annually- only around 66 rainy days per year.\n\nBelow is an overview of Salamanca’s climate, according to the seasons.\n\n1. SPRING: April, May\n\nThis is the rainiest season of the year, with the month of May being the rainiest of all. Make sure to bring an umbrella and a raincoat, along with appropriate footwear.\n\nTemperatures heat up considerably in May and layering clothing is a good idea, to be equipped for the changeable weather. Although days will be fairly warm, requiring lighter clothing, nights will still be cool, so bringing warm clothing and a light winter coat is still a good idea.\n\nSpring temperatures (ºC/ºF) and rainfall (mm):\n\nApril: 3.5-16ºC or 38-60ºF, 39mm\n\nMay: 7-20ºC or 44.5-67.5ºF, 48mm\n\n2. SUMMER: June, July, August, September\n\nJune and September are pleasant months- hot but not as scorching hot as July and August, which are the hottest months of the year. In summer there can be the odd chance of heavy rain or thunderstorms.\n\nFor summer, lightweight clothing is recommended; t-shirts and shorts, or skirts and dresses with sandals. Nights tend to be slightly cooler, especially in early June and late September, so a cardigan or light jacket and closed shoes would be a good idea. Don’t forget your swimwear- although there are no beaches nearby, there are plenty of pools to enjoy in order to take advantage of the hot weather.\n\nSummer temperatures (ºC/ºF) and rainfall (mm):\n\nJune: 10.5-25ºC or 51-77.5ºF, 34mm\n\nJuly: 13-29ºC or 55-85ºF, 16mm\n\nAugust: 12.5-29ºC or 54-85ºF, 11mm\n\nSeptember: 9-24.5ºC or 48-76ºF, 32mm\n\n3. AUTUMN: October\n\nAgain, as Salamanca’s climate consists of extremes, this is a short season. The month is generally clear, sunny and warm, although temperatures start to drop and it may be windy and rainy. As with spring, layering is the best idea, to be able to enjoy the warmer day weather and withstand the cooler night temperatures. An umbrella is needed.\n\nAutumn temperatures (ºC/ºF) and rainfall (mm):\n\nOctober: 6-18ºC or 43-65ºF, 39mm\n\n4. WINTER: November, December, January, February, March.\n\nSalamanca during the winter is cold, although frost and snow are rare. Jumpers, trousers and boots are a good idea, paired with a warm winter coat, a scarf and gloves. Nights can be very cold (especially if the accommodation does not have central heating- which is common in Spain), so make sure you bring warm pyjamas. Rainfall is fairly common in winter but it tends to be light or moderate. The coldest month of the year is January.\n\nWinter temperatures (ºC/ºF) and rainfall (mm):"
