        "text": "Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu\n\nThe Salkantay Trek to Machu Picchu is an alternative to the Inca Trail. It is considered by most to be the best alternative route. We think it’s the best route! Not only because of the rampant beauty you will encounter, but also because of the lack of people. Because it is more rugged and remote, the Salkantay Trek is significantly less populated than the Inca Trail. With formidable views and awe-inspiring vistas, this path less traveled has an unquantifiable value. It is truly, as deemed by the Inca, sacred.\n\nSalkantay Travel Info\n\nInca Trail to Machu Picchu\n\nThe Inca Trail is the most famous hike in South America. Although the total distance is only about 39km, the ancient trail laid by the Incas from the Sacred Valley to Machu Picchu winds its way up and down and around the mountains, snaking over three high Andean passes en route, which have collectively led to the route being dubbed ‘the Inca Trail.’ The views of snowy mountain peaks, distant rivers and ranges, and cloud forests flush with orchids are stupendous and walking from one cliff-hugging pre-Columbian ruin to the next is a mystical and unforgettable experience.\n\nInca Trail Travel Info\n\nMachu Picchu Wonder of the World\n\nMachu Picchu is consistently the #1 travel destination in the world. Why? The answer is simple: the experience is mesmerizing and unique. You aren’t merely driving up to the lookout, getting out of the car, and snapping a few photos; you are traveling to the depths of South America, into the heart of the Andes. Stumbling onto the Lost City of the Incas is just one part of the journey.\n\nMachu Picchu Travel Info\n\nRainbow Mountain or Vinicunca Mountain\n\nVinicunca — also known as the Mountain of Seven Colors, or more simply Rainbow Mountain — was discovered four years ago when the snow covering it melted, revealing the natural beauty of the rock beneath. Formed by weathering, environmental conditions and sedimentary deposits over time, the mountain’s unique minerology created a marbling effect, with layered hues of gold, lavender, red and turquoise towering into the sky.\n\nRainbow Mountain Travel Info\n\nAusangate Adventure Trek\n\nAusangate is one of the highest mountains in the Cusco region and is also an important cultural centre for the Andean communities. Every year huge pilgrimages are made to the mountain. This has been going on for centuries.\n\nThe peak of the mountain is 6,385 masl, but we won’t go quite that high. On this hike you’ll come close to nature and feel the connection while you observe the impressive views that surround you. You’ll get to observe some fascinating bird species and other wildlife along the way as well as spectacular landscapes.\n\nAusangate Travel Info\n\nDay Tours in Cusco\n\nThe former capital of the mighty Inca Empire, Peru’s city of Cusco is a fabulous base from which to explore fascinating archeological and historical sites, as well as enjoy time in nature. Although the city has much to be proud of, many of the area’s delights can be found beyond the city limits. Here are some of the best day trips to take from Cusco for a fabulous Peruvian adventure to remember.\n\nThe best way to prevent altitude sickness in Cusco is to be prepared. During your first 2 days you should take things easy. This means you shouldn’t take part in any strenuous activity. You should rest a lot and drink plenty of water. Alcohol and smoking isn’t a good idea as it can agitate you and make you feel a lot worse.\n\nYou can avoid altitude sickness by spending a few days taking it easy in Cusco before you head off on any kind of trek. Trying to do a tough activity too soon could make you very ill. You should also eat lightly and avoid alcohol to feel your best.\n\nThere’s no definite answer to this as there are many options. The Inca Trail is the most popular and needs to be booked months in advance as there are only a certain number of spots each day. The best alternative trek is considered to be Salkantay, which offers a real adventure and fantastic scenery. Inca Jungle is great for those seeking a thrill and Lares is a top option if you want a quieter and more rural experience. If you have a lot of time and want to experience two incredible Inca sites, you can opt for the Choquequirao trek.\n\nThis depends on the individual who wants to trek. The Inca Trail is extremely popular as it takes you along the real trail where the Incas once walked. However, many say that the scenery on Salkantay is more beautiful. For this reason we would say go for the Inca Trail if you’re a real history lover and like to hike well-known treks, but go for Salkantay if you want to witness stunning landscapes and a variety of different climates.\n\nThe trek isn’t dangerous. You’re with fully qualified guides all the way to make sure you always stay on track. They are there to help you if you feel sick at all along the way. The path can be uneven, but if you take it slowly, you’ll have no issues. During wet season, November to April, you’ll have to take more care when you walk to avoid slipping.\n\nThe trek is moderately challenging. This means that most people will be able to complete it if they are well-prepared. Most of the trek isn’t too challenging. It’s just the second day where you walk up to the Salkantay pass. You’ll trek for a total of 10 hours that day. What makes this trek difficult is the high altitude at which you hike and the different terrains as well as changing climate.\n\nAlong the trail you’ll experience a lot of different climates. You’ll need to pack for the cold on the first two days. The first night will get below zero, so you need to make sure you have warm clothing and an excellent sleeping bag.\n\nTo prepare for trekking at high altitudes we recommend you start to prepare a few weeks before. You should start a fitness regime that includes daily stretching and exercises, particularly for your legs. We recommend taking hikes at home weekly before you come to do the trail.\n\nIf you do feel sick, there are a few things you can try. One is to speak to your doctor before you come to see if you can get a prescription for pills to help. These can also be bought in pharmacies in Cusco. Other helpful ways are to drink coca or muna (Andean mint) tea, which have been in use since the Inca times. Small oxygen bottles are also available in pharmacies and can really help.\n\nThe coldest months in Cusco are from May to July. During this time the sun is strong in the day, but once it goes down or you spend much time in the shade, it can get very cold. It can go below zero at night, so warm clothes are a must during these months.\n\nThe best month in all the year is October. The climate is just right and the sky is usually very clear. It’s also not the busiest season so it isn’t overrun by visitors. However, anytime from May to October is a good time as it’s the dry season so you won’t get wet.\n\nYou can’t hike to Machu Picchu in one day from Cusco, but you can visit in one day. There’s a one day tour option where you start early in the morning and get a car to drive you to take the train from Ollantaytambo to Aguas Calientes. You’ll then spend the morning in Machu Picchu before heading down for lunch, a brief rest or walk around the town, and then the train and car back to Cusco.\n\nThe best time of year is between May to October, with October being the best month of all. The trail is dry and the weather is lovely. During the rainy season the trail will be wet and can make it more difficult.\n\nYou’ll need to pack lightly as you only have a limited amount of space/weight that you can take. You need to make sure you have clothing for warm and cold climates, as well as lots of sun and bug protection. We recommend using thin layers that can be taken on and off as needed. In addition make sure you have toiletries and any personal medication you need to take. Don’t forget your permit, Machu Picchu tickets, and passport as you won’t be able to enter without these.\n\nThe Inca Trail is relatively difficult. You’ll be hiking up to a high altitude and a lot of the trail is along ancient steps. This means it can be tough on your knees and ankles. Take your time to allow your body to adjust.\n\nYou do need to be relatively fit to hike the trail. You’ll be heading up to a high altitudes and hiking along rough terrain, both of which can take their toll on your body. We recommend spending time training and hiking before you come to do the trail.\n\nWhat an experience!\n\nMust of been one of the most challenging treks I have done so far but was amazing ! Carlos our guide was the best as he took good care of us, was knowledgeable and really gave us the positive energy we needed in order to keep going! Would definitely recommend the experience as you get to see the Andes, the team is very organized, there was plenty of local food and many many stories to share :)\n\nWonderful trek!\n\nIt was honestly the most fantastic experience. My partner is quite fit, I would say I had a medium level of fitness, but 0 experience trekking or being at altitude and had felt a bit nervous before we went. But Freddy is a great guide and there were others in our group with a similar fitness level so it was nice to find someone your speed and trek together. It was an unforgettable experience and I’m so glad we got to do it, and feel so lucky we had Freddy as our guide!!!"
