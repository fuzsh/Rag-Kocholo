We also come to Salamanca for its rich architectural heritage, its cathedrals and its house of shells, which have earned it the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You can visit the Plaza Mayor, the University and its libraries as well as its cloisters, the Church of La Clerecia, with its towers from which you can admire the superb panorama of the city, the cathedrals and medieval towers of the city. The Museum of the Automobile, the Museum Moulin Fabrique de Flour, the Convent of San Esteban, and opposite the Convent de las Duenas and its beautiful cloister, the cellar of Salamanca where students learned magic (according to the legend ), The patio of the Salina, the Museum of Art Nouveau Art Deco sheltered in a mansion. If you visit the city during the summer, you will have the chance to attend theater, music, flamenco or cinema shows. And in any season you can enjoy bars and restaurants serving local specialties, or tapas bars, or shopping in the pretty little shops of the city center. A good idea to discover Salamanca: cycling through the cycling path along the river park and crossing some parts of the city. You can reach Salamanca by car from the A-50, coming from Madrid, by the A-62 from Portugal, but the city also has an airport where you can land from Paris or Barcelona. The train also connects the city to Madrid, Bilbao, or Barcelona among others. You can quite easily walk to town, and you can also easily use the buses or taxis."
