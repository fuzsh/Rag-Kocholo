June through August and December through February are also great times to visit, and this guide answers questions about when to visit the country for specific experiences.\n\nThe best time to visit central cities is different from the best time to visit the Dolomites, and the best time for wine tasting is not necessarily the best time for beach vacations. How you decide to travel will determine when you should visit Spain and our information can help you narrow down your choice.\n\nFrom seasonal changes to information on the hottest month in Spain, we can help you find the right time for your custom trip.\n\nOverview\n\nBest Time by Travel Season\n\nBest Time for Great Weather\n\nBest Time for Beachesâ\n\nBest Time for Sightseeing\n\nBest Time to Visit Barcelona\n\nBest Time for Hiking\n\nBest Time for Wine Tasting\n\nBest Time for Grape Harvesting\n\nBest Time for Food\n\nBest Time to Avoid the Crowds\n\nBest Time for Families with Children\n\nBest Time for Couples or Honeymooners\n\nBest Time for Seniors\n\nBest Time for Spring & Summer Activities\n\nBest Time for Fall & Winter Activities\n\nBook for the Best Time to Visit Spain\n\nBest Time by Travel Season\n\nThe AlcÃ¡zar de los Reyes Cristianos in Cordoba, Spain\n\nHigh Season: June â¢ July\n\nJune is the best month of the Spanish high season to visit for a summer vacation. During this time, you can relax on beaches on the northern, southern, and central coastlines, when the weather is warm and the sun is shining.\n\nAs you decide where to go for your Spain Vacations & Tours in July, also consider that northern Spain is busier, but slightly cooler than southern and central Spain.\n\nShoulder Season: September â¢ October\n\nThe fall months of September and October are the best times within Spainâs shoulder season to visit for comfortable weather and quieter experiences.\n\nThere is plenty of sunshine for beach trips, long days for extended adventures and tours, and the moderate crowds mean more space to enjoy authentic experiences on Spain Tours in September.\n\nLow Season: January â¢ February\n\nThe winter months of January and February are the best times to visit Spain to enjoy the advantages of a trip during the low season.\n\nYou will experience cold weather across the country, so you will not likely hit the beach, but snow in places like the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada mountains is often visible. The cool temperatures are better for clear skies and exploring the historic cities and towns when the crowds are long gone.\n\nGet Weekly Travel Inspiration\n\nExpert Tips for Discerning Travelers\n\nI would like to subscribe to the weekly newsletter.

As May marks the end of spring, the temperatures rise and the sun starts to shine brightly for the summer season. The latter half of August is the best time for great weather during the summer, as you can skip the hottest month, July, for slightly cooler temperatures and clear skies.\n\nMany travelers flock to Spain during the high season months of July and August as the perception is that the weather is fantastic. And while there are clear skies and plenty of sunshine, the temperatures can get especially hot.\n\nA trip to Spain during May and August provides the perfect weather for seeing the countryâs highlights, with tours capturing essential experiences.\n\nBest Time for Beachesâ\n\nLlafranc in Costa Brava, Spain\n\nBest Months: June â¢ September\n\nEarly June and mid-September are the best times to visit Spainâs beaches. During these times, the weather is warm enough to enjoy the golden sands, from the Costa del Sol to the Bay of Biscay, and the islands are open for the summer season starting in June. Also, the crowds thin at the start of the shoulder season in September.\n\nYou can visit Spain for its beaches in the summer months of July and August, but expect sweltering temperatures and crowds peaking on the shores of Ibiza, Malaga, Costa Brava, San Sebastian, and the Canary Islands.\n\nYou can explore the best beaches of Spain, including La Concha and Cala Macarelleta, in June and September on tours that highlight their sparkle, from Barcelona to the Basque Country.\n\nLearn more: Top 7 Things to Do in San Sebastian\n\nBest Time for Sightseeing\n\nThe Patio de los Naranjos at Seville's cathedral, Santa Maria de la Sede. Photo Â© Tourismo Andaluz\n\nBest Months: May â¢ June â¢ September â¢ October\n\nMay, June, and September to October are the best times for sightseeing in Spain. During these times, there are far fewer tourists and local vacationers.\n\nSmall crowds allow for an authentic cultural experience, whether in the plazas lined with orange trees in Andalusia or the pintxo (tapas) bars of San Sebastian. Traveling just outside the busiest seasons brings excellent opportunities to explore the countless museums, ruins, churches, and vineyards at your pace, rather than trying to avoid the crowds or the heat.\n\nBarcelona, Madrid, and Seville are among the best places to visit during these times and you can explore your options with our Barcelona, Madrid, and Seville Tours.\n\nLearn more: 10 Best Places to Visit in Spain\n\nBest Time to Visit Barcelona\n\nLa Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, Spain\n\nBest Months: May â¢ June â¢ July â¢ August â¢ September â¢ October\n\nThe best time to visit Barcelona, Spainâs capital of the Catalonia region, is between May and October.\n\nMay through October encompass spring, summer, and fall in Barcelona, great times for pleasant weather, with options in the shoulder seasons to escape the crowds. Spring is fantastic as sunshine breaks through the winter chill and blesses Barcelonaâs beaches with warm, clear days. Summer, though busy, offers the best conditions for the beaches and outdoor activities, while fall brings peace and quiet to the usually bustling city.\n\nYou can find inspiration for your vacation in Catalonia with our Barcelona Itineraries & Vacation Packages, planning your Spanish trip during the spring, summer, or fall seasons.\n\nLearn more: Best Time To Visit Barcelona\n\nGet Weekly Travel Inspiration\n\nExpert Tips for Discerning Travelers\n\nI would like to subscribe to the weekly newsletter.

You can enjoy comfortable strolls or challenging treks in the floral landscapes and spot more active wildlife during the cooler seasons of spring and fall.\n\nSummer hikes are possible, but more difficult because of the high temperatures.

The crowds havenât yet arrived and the vineyards are blossoming with plump grapes and lush foliage.\n\nSherry in Andalusia shines brightest in April, and August, towards the end of summer, is great for visiting the wineries around the Penedes, the region that produces famous Cava.

If you visit during the fall, you may assist with the harvest and sample the grape varieties fresh, in wine, as jelly, and more.\n\nSeptember and October are also best for meeting winemakers across Spain and witnessing the changing colors of the valleys and slopes on which the vineyards thrive. You can experience the grape-harvest season in all its glory on harvesting tours during the season.\n\nBest Time for Food\n\nSpanish Paella\n\nBest Months: January â¢ April â¢ August â¢ October\n\nSeasonal culinary traditions are at the heart of cooking in Spain and the best time for each season is January in winter, April in spring, August in summer, and October in fall.\n\nIn winter, hearty dishes like fabada asturiana, a warm Spanish bean stew, take center stage on the dining table, and the famous sagardotegi, or cider houses, open their doors to vacationers. The warmth of winter dishes contrasts with summer seafood meals that stake their claim as some of the best in the Mediterranean, paella being the most notable. Tomato dishes like pa amb tomÃ quet, a Catalan staple, are enjoyed during tomato season in spring, and food paired with wine is the culinary tradition during the grape-harvest season in fall.\n\nOur Spain Vacations in August can help you experience the best of the countryâs culinary traditions should you choose to visit during one of the best times of the year.\n\nLearn more: 7 Best Places for Food and Wine in Spain â¢ Top 7 Food and Wine Things to Do in Spain\n\nBest Time to Avoid the Crowds\n\nGothic Quarter in Barcelona, Spain\n\nBest Months: November â¢ December â¢ January â¢ February â¢ March\n\nWinter is the best time to avoid crowds in Spain as most travelers arrive in summer to take advantage of the great beach weather.
