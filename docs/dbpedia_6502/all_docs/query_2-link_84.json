        "text": "Being located in the western part of Spain, Salamanca experiences Continental type of climate with usual hot summers and cold winters. It is important to know about the four seasons if you are visiting Salamanca for the first time.\n\nSpring (March to April) & Autumn (October to November): The temperature usually stays around 30 degree Celsius. With clear blue skies and pleasant weather, it becomes easier for tourists to explore Salamanca in the best way. Moreover, in Spain its true beauty opens up in these seasons. Thatâ€™s why, most of the tourist crowds can be spotted in these peak seasons in Salamanca.\n\nSummer (May to September): The temperature slightly rises up. Especially in July and August, the temperature rises upto 39 degree Celsius. Though days might be warmer as compare to spring and autumn, still this off-season is perfect to explore Salamanca, specially if you hate crowd.\n\nWinter (December to February): As said before winter is very cold out here, with temperature falling upto -10 degree Celsius at night. Hence, if you are travelling in this season make sure you layered up yourself with thick clothes. Though most part of this city will be covered with snow, still it is visually appealing to see the white painted face of Salamanca.\n\nHence, Spring and Autumn are the obvious choice and the best time to visit Salamanca. As an alternate option summer can be considered as well."
