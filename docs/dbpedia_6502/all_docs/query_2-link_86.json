This climate type is found on the eastern sides of the continents between 20Â° and 35Â° N and S latitude. In summer, these regions are largely under the influence of moist, maritime airflow from the western side of the subtropical anticyclonic cells over low-latitude ocean waters. Temperatures are high and can lead to warm, oppressive nights. Summers are usually somewhat wetter than winters, with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunderstorm activity; tropical cyclones also enhance warm-season rainfall in some regions. The coldest month is usually quite mild, although frosts are not uncommon, and winter precipitation is derived primarily from frontal cyclones along the polar front.\n\nThe KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Cfa\". (Humid Subtropical Climate).\n\nThe average temperature for the year in Salamanca is 66.7Â°F (19.3Â°C). The warmest month, on average, is May with an average temperature of 73.4Â°F (23Â°C).

Industry characteristics\n\nThe petrochemical industry is the primary one in the city, giving rise to numerous companies and bus transport services available for employees. The strategy was to boost the creation and development of the so-called \"industrial corridor\" of the Bajio.\n\nThe largest Pemex refinery in Mexico is located in Salamanca, and it is the 11th largest crude oil refinery in the world.\n\nAlso noteworthy is CFE Thermoelectric, a source of significant employment in the municipality.\n\nIn Feb 2014, Mazda Motor Company opened its North American plant outside of Salamanca.

Attractions\n\nTemple of the Lord of the Hospital\n\nOpposite the main garden and next to the City Hall is the neoclassical Templo del SeÃ±or del Hospital (Temple of the Lord of the Hospital). There, in the 16th century, there was a hospital for OtomÃ­ people founded by MichoacÃ¡n Bishop, Vasco de Quiroga.\n\nThe current parish was consecrated until the last century, in 1924, and today houses the Black Christ of Salamanca, known as the Cristo del Hospital (Christ of the Hospital).\n\nThe Christ, reason for countless visits throughout the year, was made with corn cane more than 450 years ago in PÃ¡tzcuaro, MichoacÃ¡n. Itâs 1.80 meters high, weighs 13 kilograms, arrived when Salamanca was still known as Xidoo and acquired the Cristo del Hospital name when years later the hospital was installed at the service of the natives.\n\nA legend tells that initially the Christ image was white and acquired the black color to camouflage himself in the middle of the night. This, after a battle where the Spanish defeated the natives and the latter decided to take the image to Jilotepec.\n\nDreaming, one of them had an epiphany: the Christ asked to be left where he would be able to be permanently. Thus, he took it away and hid it near a river. When returning to continue the path, he discovered that the Christ had changed color to hide from enemies.\n\nThatâs why the image remains in Salamanca and maintains its black color.\n\nhttps://www.visitmexico.com/en/guanajuato/salamanca/temple-of-the-lord-of-the-hospital\n\nNopal Circuit\n\nDiscover the Valtierrilla municipality nopal plantations aboard a âtractopalââa trailer pulled by a tractor. As you pass, data that you didnât know about this cactus so representative of Mexican cuisine will be revealed.\n\nYou will also learn about the industrial and packaging process of this plant increasingly adding new followers in the United States and Canada, countries now lucky enough to receive it even in the comfort of their markets.\n\nAt the foot of the fields you can taste freshly cut nopales and cooked right there to calm the craving and continue with the tour. Then youâll arrive at a cosmetic factory nopal-made, where youâll see the production processes and the infinite benefits for the skin or hair this cactus brings. In addition, you can prepare your own soap.\n\nThe third point of the journey is an organic garden, where it is possible to talk with planting responsibles about caring and harvesting. The plantations are chemical-free and at the end you can make your own stuffed stalk.\n\nDuring the unusual trip, a musician with a guitar in hand will perform enlivened songs and invite the group to sing while the nopal deep green colors the fields.\n\nhttps://www.visitmexico.com/en/guanajuato/salamanca/nopal-circuit\n\nParroquia Antigua de Salamanca (Former Parish of Salamanca)\n\nIn front of the Plaza de los NiÃ±os HÃ©roes youâll find the Parroquia Antigua de Salamanca which, it is said, is one of the first churches built in this city.\n\nBaroque outside and neoclassical inside, you can immediately identify it by its Churrigueresque facade and its incomplete tower, which of course has more than one explanation.\n\nOn the one hand, itâs said that it was too heavy and to prevent collapse they decided to wait before continuing the construction. Another theory points to the lack of budget. Whatever the reason, this has become one of its hallmarks.\n\nAnother detail is that the floor is covered in mesquite wood, a material formerly used in Guanajuato buildings. Itâs said that this site is the only one from the colonial era that preserves its original floor, so upon entering youâll know that youâre standing over centuries of history.\n\nFor some time, it was a school and library instead of functioning as a temple. After the Cristero war, the authorities decided to give new uses to religious centers, and this was no exception. Years later, at the end of the conflict, it was used again for what it was built, remaining that way until today.\n\nhttps://www.visitmexico.com/en/guanajuato/salamanca/parroquia-antigua-de-salamanca-former-parish-of-salamanca\n\nSalamanca Guanajuato MÃ©xico, recorrido por el centro histÃ³rico\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sJVef3MxfwA\n\n6. History\n\nThe history of Salamanca, as a legally organized town, begins on January 1, 1603, when Viceroy Don Gaspar de ZÃºÃ±iga y Acevedo and Fifth Count of Monterrey, originally from Salamanca, Spain, decides, on August 16, 1602, to grant the Mercy of foundation requested by BartolomÃ© SÃ¡nchez Torrado and to support the Spaniards and the children of the Spaniards who were working the lands of the BajÃ­o because from the years 1540 or 1550 they began to establish \"estancias\", mainly of livestock and little agricultural exploitation , by a few Spaniards and colonized by small groups of Otomi Indians.\n\nIn this way, on January 1, 1603, BartolomÃ© SÃ¡nchez Torrado (born in Spain and not in the State of Guanajuato as erroneously indicated in other texts), Diego BeltrÃ¡n Camacho, AndrÃ©s GarcÃ­a de Valencia, Captain Diego de Valencia met. Come on, Juan de CuÃ©llar, Baltasar GonzÃ¡lez, Diego Fonseca de Oliva, Alonso RodrÃ­guez ManrÃ­quez, Luis de Fonseca, MartÃ­n GarcÃ­a Torrado, Alonso HernÃ¡ndez Romero, Diego Romero, Juan LÃ³pez IbÃ¡Ã±ez, CristÃ³bal de la Cruz Sarabia, Francisco Encal, Jorge Maldonado, MartÃ­n DomÃ­nguez, Francisco GÃ³mez, CristÃ³bal de Estrada, Diego Aguado CalderÃ³n, Juan de ChavarrÃ­a, Juan de Abella, Juan Fonseca, AntÃ³n GÃ³mez Casilla, Juan de Espinosa Alderete, MartÃ­n GarcÃ­a de Sosa Domingo HernÃ¡ndez, to elect the first four councilors, Juan de CuÃ©llar, Baltasar GonzÃ¡lez, Diego HernÃ¡ndez de Oliva and Juan de ChavarrÃ­a. Which elected two Mayors, AndrÃ©s GarcÃ­a de Valencia and BartolomÃ© SÃ¡nchez Torrado. Thus the foundation of Salamanca was declared, and its first council was elected, made up of four councilors and two ordinary mayors, and the life and existence of the Villa de Salamanca began legally, that January 1, 1603. The \"typical costume\" in those years consisted of the man: with a wide-skirted sollate hat and a high crown, a red or navy blue tie around the waist, and cross-strap huaraches. While the woman wore: on her right shoulder a clay jug, a blanket blouse, a shawl tied to the right shoulder, a long skirt of cotton cambaya fabric.\n\nIndependence\n\nDuring the days 24 and 25, in Salamanca, some Spaniards are apprehended, forty thousand pesos are collected from the Augustinian convent; Albino GarcÃ­a and his cousin Pedro, Father Gracilita and AndrÃ©s Delgado \"El Giro\" are commissioned to revolutionize as guerrilla leaders in different parts.\n\nDon JosÃ© MarÃ­a Luis Mora, an illustrious and trustworthy historian, says \"The most notable leader of the insurgents of that time was Albino GarcÃ­a who was born in Cerro Blanco located on the road to La Tinaja and Baltierra el Grande, administered by the Villa de Salamanca.\"\n\nTomasa Esteves was born in Salamanca, in 1788, and the report of AgustÃ­n de Iturbide tells the Viceroy that \"she was the main agent in procuring the desertion, which has considerably been verified.\" She was apprehended on August 5, 1814 and \"Tuesday 9 was passed by arms, continues Iturbide, saying The seductive woman whose head has been placed in the public square, \"the execution of Tomasa Esteves took place on the south corner of the streets currently called RevoluciÃ³n and RÃ­o Lerma. When AndrÃ©s Delgado appeared before the Cura Hidalgo, he had just turned 18, as is stated in the book of baptisms of Indians in the parish of Salamanca, on November 7, 1792 and he was born in a house facing the south side of the chapel of Santa MarÃ­a Nativitas, rebocero by trade.\n\nOn March 23, 1821, the Colonel passed through Salamanca on his way to Guanajuato with all the military forces of the region under the new flag of the Three Guarantees; Religion, Union, Independence, raised and sworn by Iturbide and Guerrero. Later he returned by that same road, waiting to be called to Mexico, that date can be considered as the end of the War of Independence in Salamanca.\n\nIn 1895 the Congress of the State of Guanajuato by decree promoted the town of Salamanca to the category of city.\n\nMexican Revolution\n\nIn April 1915, Colonel Francisco Villa gathered all his people, approximately 8000 soldiers, in Salamanca to go to Celaya where he was defeated by the forces of General Ãlvaro ObregÃ³n. Once the Villista forces were defeated, they passed through Salamanca again, pursued by the Army, ObregÃ³n's soldiers took Salamanca and stayed for 8 days. Then they went to the city of LeÃ³n Gto. In July of the same year, Salamanca is ravaged by General Fierro, one of the strong men of Villa. A few days later, the Carrancista army arrived in Salamanca under the command of the state governor and Salamanca was stained with blood with the shooting of 12 people in the middle of the main garden.\n\n7.Contact Information\n\nCity Mayor: MarÃ­a Beatriz HernÃ¡ndez Cruz\n\nPhone number: +52 (464) 641 4501, ext. 1012\n\nE-mail: beatriz.hernandez@salamanca.gob.mx\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BettyHdezCruz\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BettyHdezC\n\nWebsite: https://www.salamanca.gob.mx\n\nGovt.
