        "text": "The Camino de Santiago routes in January\n\nAre you planning to do the Camino de Santiago in January? Congratulations! There are not many pilgrims who decide to do the Camino de Santiago during the winter months.\n\nHowever, as we told you in our articles on the Camino de Santiago in winter, the pilgrim routes are surrounded by tranquillity and wonderful landscapes in January. Only a few are able to enjoy them.\n\nIn this article, we explain what climatic conditions you will find in each of the sections on the Camino de Santiago in January. We will also tell you about the different events that take place during January in the towns that the Camino de Santiago crosses.\n\nDoing the Camino Frances to Santiago in January\n\nThe Camino Frances to Santiago in January is a very different route from the one you will find in the high season. You will find few pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago in winter, specially in this route in January.\n\nIf you feel like venturing into this challenge, we recommend doing the Camino de Santiago from Sarria. Tell us when you’d like to complete it and other details about the trip you want to take. We’ll be happy to arrange it for you!\n\nIf you want to know more about the different sections of the Camino Frances you should consult the section dedicated to this route in our blog on the Camino de Santiago, in which we tell you what the route is like.\n\nIn this post, we will focus on explaining what sort of temperature you will find in January on the Camino Frances to Santiago and what events are held in the different localities that this popular route crosses.\n\nThe temperature on the Camino Frances in January\n\nIn January you will find an average temperature of 5 degrees centigrade. However, it is likely that in the stretch that crosses Castile there are days when the temperature is below zero.\n\nIf you plan to start the Camino Frances from Sant Jean Pied de Port you should find out clearly as to what the temperature may be on those days and if there is snow. In January it is quite common that one of the variants between Saint Jean Pied de Port and Roncesvalles is impassable.\n\nAnother point where you could find snow in winter is on the ascent to Foncebadón and O Cebreiro. You should know that to avoid this mountain pass the pilgrims of the Middle Ages took the route known as the Camino de Invierno.\n\nFestivals and events on the French route in January\n\nAs in most places, January is not a month that is characterized by the great presence of festivals and celebrations. Still, if you dare to do the Camino de Santiago in January you can enjoy some local holidays during your trip.\n\nKings’ Day (Epiphany)\n\nIf you are not Spanish you may not know that during the first days of January, Spain prepares to receive the Magi (January 6th). The previous night, January 5th, you will find King’s processions in almost all Spanish towns and cities.\n\nJanuary 25 in Belorado\n\nOn stage 10 on the Camino Frances, specifically in the town of Belorado, on 25th January the festivities are celebrated in honour of the patron saint of the town, the Virgin of Bethlehem. In addition to masses, on that day you will find various performances by local dance groups in the town.\n\nLa Borrachona in Mansilla de Mulas\n\nOn stage 19 of the tour, in Mansilla de Mulas, you will find the festival of Santa Eugenia. This curious celebration is also known by the name “La Borrachona”. It is a popular festival held between 30 and 31 January, hence the popular saying:\n\nThose who go to Santa Eugenia and sleep there,\n\nin one month they go, and one month later they come back.\n\nAstorga in January\n\nIf you do the Camino de Santiago with your dog you don’t want to miss the curious celebration that takes place in Astorga in mid-January. In this town, located on stage 22 of the Camino de Santiago, San Antón blesses every year the owners and their animals: dogs, cats, donkeys, cows, etc.\n\nAnother celebration you may find in Astorga if you are going to do the Camino de Santiago in January is the International Chocolate Salon. This event takes place either at the end of the year or early in the year, so find out the exact dates if you plan to stop by Astorga in January.\n\n28th January on the Camino Frances to Santiago\n\nOn stage 25, Villafranca del Bierzo celebrates its main festivities. On the days around January 28th, you will find various events in this town in honour of San Tirso (St. Thyrsus).\n\nDoing the Camino Portugues in January\n\nThe Camino Portugues is one of the most recommended routes to do in January, as it does not cross any mountain passes.
