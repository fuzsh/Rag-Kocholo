        "text": "The Brooklyn Museum\n\nWe found the Brooklyn Museum to be quite a piece of art. As you all well know, Brooklyn is not exactly the prettiest place in New York City. It is mostly a place for living, not a place for art seeing, but the Brooklyn museum inside and out doesn’t fit that stereotype. We were shocked when we stepped out of the dirty, creepy subway and saw such a beautiful building. Then, when we walked inside, the first thing we saw was a couple taking wedding photos. That pretty much says it all. If it’s pretty enough to take wedding pictures in front of and inside of, it’s got to be quite magnificent.\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum has got to be one of the prettiest buildings we’ve ever seen. Full of all different kinds of art starting with Egyptian Art, Pre-Columbian Art, African Art, and Native American Art, all the way down to modern art, the museum touches on all different time periods of art.
