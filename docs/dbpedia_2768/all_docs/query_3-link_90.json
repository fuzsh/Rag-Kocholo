        "text": "New York, as we all know, is the city that never sleeps. That means there’s never really a wrong time to plan a trip here. But each season does have its own personality, which means that visiting at different times of the year can feel as if you’re in an entirely different location. So when is the best time for you to plan your visit? That’s where we come in. We’ve curated a list of our 24 absolute favorite things to do in New York City all year long, from the best spots to catch outdoor concerts to where to find those holiday spirit vibes. We even tapped some of our favorite insiders to share their secrets. Read on for the absolute best things to do in New York City all year long.\n\nJanuary\n\nMid-January–early February\n\nVarious locations\n\n“This is your chance to score an affordable meal at some of the city’s best and most expensive restaurants,” says Thrillist contributor and food writer Devorah Lev-Tov. The event, which happens twice yearly (the second is in late July into early August), includes hundreds of the city’s hottest tables, all of whom offer a combination of two-course lunches and three-course dinners at price points of $30, $45, and $60. Restaurant Week’s website makes it easy to search by location, cuisine, and price; and with over 500 spots participating, you’re sure to find a menu that will satisfy nearly any craving. Some of our favorite tables to look out for include Soho’s sleek sushi counter Kintsugi Omakase, Michelin Starred-chef John Fraser’s IRIS in Midtown, and Williamsburg’s pasta stunner, Francie.\n\nReady to go? Book here.\n\nFebruary\n\nVisit MoMA or Whitney\n\nAll month long\n\nVarious locations\n\nWe’ll let you in on a little secret: One of the best times to visit NYC is in February. Sure, the weather might be frigid, but hotel prices are at rock bottom and the holiday crowds have vanished. And if trips to famed museums like the MoMA or the Whitney are on your must-see list, you might never experience them as unpopulated as during the winter months. “Even the greatest museum show can turn into a sour experience when you’re dodging massive crowds,” says art aficionado and ELLE editor Adrienne Gaffney. “A bit of planning, though, can yield a perfectly peaceful visit. February, in general, is a quiet month and you’ll have luck going either right after opening or later in the afternoon, closer to closing time.” And a bonus tip: Check museums’ websites to see what nights they might be open late. Wandering exhibit halls after hours makes for a unique evening activity.\n\nMid-February\n\nVarious locations\n\nSnagging tickets to a Fashion Week runway show might be impossible if you’re not in the industry, but if you’re into shopping (or just really good people watching), it’s an excellent time to visit NYC. “The city bursts with vibrant energy, and it’s the ideal moment to explore boutiques and special pop-up shops,” says stylist Faye Power Vande Vrede. Plus, many restaurants and bars will run Fashion Week promotions, whether it be specialty cocktails or lively after-hours events that are open to the public. And, with so many heavy hitters in town, from fashion editors to celebrities, New York’s prime shopping areas bring their A-game with activations and plenty of new collections to peruse. Some of the most popular neighborhoods to explore include the storied department stores of Fifth Avenue, Williamsburg’s vintage stores, and Soho’s lively flagship boutiques.\n\nReady to go? Book here.\n\nMarch\n\nMarch 27, 2025\n\nFlushing Meadows-Corona Park and the South Bronx\n\n“Few things beat being outdoors on a not-frigid spring day after a winter of being cooped up inside. Even better if it happens at a baseball stadium,” says baseball fan and food and wine journalist Rachel Tepper Paley. And there may be no sport more identified with New York City than baseball, thanks to our famed hometown teams of the Yankees and the Mets. Opening Day generally falls in late March, and with games running for all of the spring and summer, you can nearly always catch one when in town. As to which to choose? “Yankee Stadium and Citi Field both have their appeal, but the latter actually has some amazing food options—the pulled pork sandwich at Pig Beach BBQ is a thing of beauty,” Tepper Paley notes. And when you’re not focused on the game, she also has tips for what to see: “For supreme people watching, sit in the bleachers at both stadiums. Just be prepared to watch a drunken frat brother try to climb a partition before being escorted out by security. (Yes, this happened.)”\n\nReady to go? Book Yankees tickets here and Mets tickets here.\n\nApril\n\nMid-April\n\nVarious locations\n\n“Come springtime, pale pink cherry blossoms start blooming across the boroughs; my favorite spot for them is the grand cherry esplanade at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden—go during the week to avoid the crowds,” says Lev-Tov. And if you’d rather not pay, “you can also spot some for free outside the Brooklyn Museum that’s right next door,” she adds. Other spots to catch the fragrant blooms include Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Sakura Park in Morningside Heights, and, of course, Central Park, where the majority of cherry trees are between 72nd and 96th Streets (look out especially for the Yoshino trees on the east side of the Central Park Reservoir).\n\nReady to go? All NYC parks are free to enter; book Brooklyn Botanic Garden tickets here.\n\nApril 20, 2025\n\nMidtown East\n\nAlthough not quite as famed as New York City’s Halloween or Thanksgiving festivities, the Easter holiday in the Big Apple is low-key one of its most fun. And, just like its more flashy siblings, it too has a parade. “Whether you celebrate Easter or not, the Fifth Avenue Easter Parade and Bonnet Festival held annually on Easter Sunday is prime for people watching and the perfect way to usher in spring,” says journalist Andrew Nodell. “A portion of Fifth Avenue is closed for the day as the stretch between 49th Street and 57th Street becomes a river of pastels and jaunty chapeaux. BG Restaurant at Bergdorf Goodman and L’Avenue at Saks are great options for a post-parade lunch and cocktail, but be sure to stop by the steps of St. Patrick’s Cathedral to take in the scene of colorfully clad revelers who congregate there.”\n\nReady to go? The parade is free to watch.\n\nMay\n\nMay 2025\n\nUpper East Side\n\nThe Met Museum may be most well known for its art collection, but its subterranean Costume Institute is a favorite for fashion lovers the world over. And there is no buzzier time to visit than May, when the space unveils its newest exhibit after the flurry of the celeb-filled Met Gala. “I look forward to the opening of the Met’s Costume Institute every year,” says Trenton Chase Pardue, creator of Spaces Of My Dreams. “It starts with furiously finding my favorites on the red carpet and ends with me walking up the Met stairs myself the following week to enjoy the actual exhibit. The curatorial team pulls in so many beautiful references to each theme and it’s a great afternoon activity when you’re in the city.”\n\nReady to go? Book tickets to The Met here.\n\nThe First Warm Day\n\nAll month long\n\nUpper East Side and Upper West Side\n\n“There’s nothing more quintessentially New York—and necessary once the weather warms up—than picnicking in Central Park,” says travel editor Eva Morreale. “Not only is it excellent people-watching, it’s also meet-cute making!” Grab supplies from any nearby grocery on the Upper West or Upper East Sides to create your own, or ask if your hotel has its own program. The Mark Hotel, for example, offers a “Picnic in the Park” package, which features gourmet baskets prepared by chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten. The lunch includes elevated bites like Spicy Tuna Tartare and Maine Lobster Rolls, as well as an illustrated map so you can find your way to the best spots to lay down your blanket. We’ll also give you a few of our own to get you started: East Meadow for shade, Sheep Meadow to see and be seen, and Great Lawn for watching softball or soccer games.\n\nReady to go? Central Park is free to enter.\n\nJune\n\nEarly June\n\nFlushing Meadows Corona Park\n\nNew York City is home to many concert festivals, but none may be more anticipated than Governors Ball, which is normally held the first weekend in June. Featuring over sixty acts across three stages, last year’s event saw headliners like Post Malone, The Killers, and Sza. And while the music is the major draw, of course, I’m a huge fan of the stellar lineup of food. Forget gross chicken tenders: You’ll find me grabbing Fan Fan Doughnuts, Big Mozz mozz sticks, and juicy patties from Gotham Burger Social Club to keep up my energy in between sets.\n\nReady to go? Book tickets for Governors Ball here (when live).\n\nAll month long\n\nVarious locations\n\nWorld-famous DJs come to pay New York City a visit year round, but when massive outdoor venues like The Brooklyn Mirage open up for the season, you know summer clubbing is finally here. “The party scene in East Williamsburg and Bushwick is not to be missed,” says Pardue. “There are so many great DJ sets, concerts, and late night parties that you’re sure to have an exciting adventure that will most likely lead you into the early hours of morning.” Other outdoor venues we love include Elsewhere’s underground vibes, the daytime parties at Nowadays, and The Rooftop at Pier 17’s scenic views of the water.\n\nAll month long\n\nVarious locations\n\n“From the never-ending parties to the feeling of love that fills the streets, Pride is one of the most exciting times in the city,” says Pardue. “You will leave with a new sense of appreciation for the people of New York City … and maybe a little bit of a hangover.” And while the entire month of June brings plenty of Pride-themed programming at the city’s bars, theaters, and parks, it’s the last weekend when everything reaches a fever pitch. Don’t miss the NYC Pride March, which is normally held the last Sunday of the month. The largest pride parade in the world, the route down Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue is one of the most joyous and wild days on the city’s event calendar.\n\nReady to go? The parade is free to attend; other event prices vary.\n\nConey Island Mermaid Parade\n\nAll month long\n\nConey Island\n\nOld-school theme park kitsch lives on at Coney Island, New York’s very own warm weather playground. Famed amusement park Luna Park is home to the legendary Coney Island Cyclone roller coaster and the Brooklyn Flyer swings, while nearby boardwalk restaurants include legendary spots like Nathan’s Famous hot dogs and Coney’s Cones for gelato. One of the best days of the year to visit, though, is during a special “under the sea” event. “When people tell me that NYC has become too corporate or sterile, I tell them to watch (or walk in!) the Coney Island Mermaid Parade,” says Vicki Rutwind, content creator behind @vickirutwind. “It’s wacky, whimsical, weird and like no other parade you’ll ever see. Dressing up is half the fun, so don’t forget to grab a seashell bra or a pearl encrusted tiara before hopping on the train there!”\n\nReady to go? Book Luna Park wristbands here\n\nJuly\n\nJuly 4\n\nVarious locations\n\nAmerica’s birthday is a big deal in the Big Apple, with celebrations erupting (get it?) in all five boroughs. But the biggest draw, of course, are Macy’s 4th of July fireworks, which light up the Hudson or East River, depending on the year. I’m a big fan of the free viewing platforms scattered along the riverbanks, but many sky-high rooftops will also throw their own ticketed events. For the best views (although, fair warning: The entry fee might be steep), look into the fetes being thrown at the city’s observation decks, like Edge NYC, One World Observatory, and SUMMIT One Vanderbilt.\n\nReady to go? Fourth of July party prices vary\n\nAll month long\n\nVarious locations\n\nWarm weather and late sunsets also mean the start of New York’s stellar outdoor concert lineup in our public parks. Perhaps the most popular is Central Park’s Summer Stage, which hosts everyone from DJs to comedians to jazz musicians; and Bryant Park also runs its free Picnic Performances all summer long. But don’t overlook Prospect Park’s bandshell, which is home to BRIC Celebrate Brooklyn!, New York’s longest-running, free outdoor performing arts festival. “It’s one of my favorite concert series in New York,” says Ellis Ludwig-Leone, bandleader of San Fermin and co-founder of Better Company Records. “Most of the shows are free, and the lineup is always excellent. Bring a beach chair and a picnic basket, and make sure to catch the opener.”\n\nReady to go? Prices vary\n\nAugust\n\nBegins August 26, 2024\n\nFlushing\n\nOne of the biggest tennis events of the season descends on New York City every late August, bringing with it some of the world’s best players. But there is far more to see at the US Open than just the marquee matches; wandering the courts during the early days of the tournament is a fantastic way to learn about up and coming players. “Be sure to get there early so you can explore the food stalls that bring in some of the city’s favorite restaurants,” says Lev-Tov. “And don’t forget to try the signature Grey Goose Honey Deuce cocktail in a souvenir cup.” Tennis aficionados should also make a beeline for the US Open Fan Week, which takes place the week leading up to the competition. The free event features matches, concerts, and family friendly activities.\n\nReady to go? Book tickets to the US Open here.\n\nSeptember\n\nAll month long\n\nTheater District\n\nAs a huge theater nerd, I look forward to the fall premieres of Broadway’s newest musicals and plays with anticipation bordering on obsessive. As everyone returns from August vacations, September is when the Theater District shines, with many of the industry’s most anticipated shows taking their first bows. This fall, the hottest tickets include Romeo + Juliet with music by Jack Antonoff; a new production of Our Town starring Zoey Deutch and Katie Holmes; and the London transfer of Sunset Boulevard with Nicole Scherzinger making her Broadway debut as Norma Desmond. Of course, it’s also a great time to see Broadway’s most popular shows, like Tony winner Hell’s Kitchen (pictured above).\n\nReady to go? Ticket prices vary.\n\nOctober\n\nOctober 17–20, 2024\n\nVarious locations\n\nAs a writer who covers New York chefs, restaurants, and food trends, NYCWFF is one of the bigger events for the year on the industry calendar. But far from being just for insiders, it’s a lively celebration that brings together some of the country’s top chefs with a lot of people who really, really like to eat. Tentpole events include the Blue Moon Burger Bash (seriously, come really hungry for that one) and the weekend Grand Tastings, but there are also intimate dinners for those looking for something a little less wild. New this year is the Drag Disco hosted by David Burtka and Neil Patrick Harris, and the The Betty BOOze Harvest Happy Hour hosted by Blake Lively, among others.\n\nReady to go? Book tickets for NYCWFF here.\n\nAll month long\n\nVarious locations\n\nWe might be across the ocean from Munich, but German beer culture is alive and well here in New York City. Don’t believe us? Visit at any point during October, when stein-holding contests, giant pretzels, and dirndls pop up all across the boroughs. The largest event is Watermark’s Oktoberfest, which runs for most of September and October, but other spots bringing the Teutonic cheer include Loreley Beer Garden (look out for the Sunday pig roast), Stone Street Oktoberfest, and The Standard Biergarten.\n\nReady to go? Event prices vary.\n\nAll month long\n\nVarious locations\n\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that if you visit New York at any point during October, you should pack a costume. “No other city does Halloween for grown-ups quite like NYC,” says Rutwind. “The city comes alive with spooky Halloween themed pop-up bars, genuinely terrifying haunted houses, urban pumpkin patches, festive costume parties, and the world’s largest Halloween parade.” Rutwind is referring to The Village Halloween Parade, which is the capstone on a month of ghoulish fun. Every year, 50,000 revelers take to the streets in Greenwich Village, and you can be assured all the nearby bars and restaurants will be running ghastly specials to serve them.\n\nReady to go? The Halloween parade is free to attend; other event prices vary\n\nNovember\n\nNovember 28, 2024\n\nMidtown Manhattan\n\nMany of us probably grew up watching this beloved parade on TV on Thanksgiving morning, but seeing it in person is like going from black and white to color. “It’s a New York rite of passage, as far as I’m concerned,” says Lev-Tov. “Get there early to score a good spot, and be sure to bring warm layers and plenty of snacks and water.” And here’s a little secret: If you’d like to see the balloons with fewer crowds, head to the Upper West Side the night before for Macy’s Balloon Inflation Celebration. Like the name implies, visitors can watch the massive floats take shape before their spin in the spotlight.\n\nReady to go? The parade is free to watch.\n\nNovember 3, 2024\n\nCitywide\n\nTraversing all five boroughs, the 26.2-mile-long New York City Marathon brings the city together like few events can. “The energy of the city on Marathon Day is so positive,” says travel writer Jordi Lippe-McGraw. “Even if you don’t know anyone racing, it’s fun to pick a restaurant along the route to cheer on the runners.” And whether you’re running or not, you can still take advantage of Marathon food specials, which are often heavy on the bread and pasta. What’s not to love?\n\nReady to go? The race is free to attend.\n\nDecember\n\nAll month long\n\nMidtown West and Lincoln Center\n\n“Christmas is scientifically proven to be the absolute best time in NYC, and New York City Ballet’s Nutcracker, the Rockettes’ Christmas Spectacular, and other seasonal shows are some of the most treasured city traditions,” says Gaffney. “Christmas Spectacular stages as many as five performances a day to accommodate the demand, and after years and years it still never gets old.” We recommend booking both your show tickets and your pre-theater dinner reservations early: They fill up quickly during this busy time of year.\n\nReady to go? Book Nutcracker tickets here; and Christmas Spectacular tickets here.\n\nAll month long\n\nVarious locations\n\nWhether it’s your first time on blades or you’re an Olympic hopeful, there are few winter activities more iconic than taking a spin around one of NYC’s famed outdoor ice rinks. “I’m a romance writer, so nothing feels more classic New York romantic to me than ice skating in Central Park,” says bestselling author Ali Rosen. “Yes, your nose will get red. Yes, you’ll probably fall over. Yes, you might have children screaming around you. But there’s something thrilling about being surrounded by the city and doing something so quintessentially outdoorsy and wintery.” Aside from Central Park’s Wollman Rink, other cool spots to skate include The Rink at Rockefeller Center (perfect if you’re going to see the Christmas tree), Bank of America Winter Village at Bryant Park, and the city’s newest entry, Glide at Brooklyn Bridge Park.\n\nReady to go? Prices vary by rink.\n\nDecember 3, 2024\n\nVarious locations\n\nWe know we’ve been throwing around the word iconic a lot (hey, it is New York City!), but truly, is there anything more iconic New York than Times Square on New Year’s Eve? Sure, it’s crowded and you’ll have to wait for hours if you want a spot with a view of the ball drop, but we feel it kind of falls into YOLO territory, no? But if that crush of people isn’t for you, pretty much every bar and restaurant in the boroughs will be throwing some kind of a party. “Or, for a really unique experience, do the midnight run in Central Park,” says Lippe-McGraw. “It even has its own fireworks display.”\n\nReady to go? NYE in Times Square is free to attend.\n\nWant more Thrillist?
