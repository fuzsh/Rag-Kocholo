        "text": "Central Park is a must-see visit for any traveler to the New York City area. Not only is it a beautiful, sprawling natural space within the bustling city, it’s also full of distinctly New York character, folklore, and quirky history. But at 843 acres, attempting to see it all in a day is a near impossibility. Oh, you could spend an entire day and night exploring I suppose, and probably get it all in, but would that be actually enjoyable? Well, it would certainly be exhausting.\n\nAs locals to the NYC area who love Central Park and have visited many times, we decided to put together a walking route for the first-time visitor, or the tourist with other “must sees” on their agenda for the day. This route can be done in 2-3 hours, depending on your pace. We traverse this route ourselves on many trips to the Park, visiting some of our favorite (and famous) spots while experiencing the overall flavor of this beloved oasis in the busy metropolis of NYC.\n\nOf course, there is much more to see and do than such a tour can cover, and I will outline some of those highlights later in the post. But let’s start with our simple route.\n\nGreat walking route for a first-time visit to Central Park\n\nOur tour enters by the Museum of Natural History and ends at 5th Ave. and 59th Street.\n\nWe took the subway and got off at the Museum of Natural History stop. Take the C train up Central Park West or the B train when it’s running, weekdays only. (The signs say “Uptown & The Bronx via 8 Av and Central Park West”.)\n\nEnding up at 5th and 59th provides very convenient access to subways, Rockefeller Center and Columbus Circle.\n\nThis route will take you south through the heart of the park, passing or stopping at the following points of interest:\n\nDelacorte Theater\n\nThe Shakespeare Garden\n\nBelvedere Castle\n\nThe Ramble\n\nBow Bridge\n\nBethesda Terrace & Bethesda Fountain\n\nThe Mall\n\nBillionaire’s Row\n\nEnter on the north side of 81st Street and follow the path slightly to the right toward Delacorte Theater, The Shakespeare Garden, and Belvedere Castle. Central Park generally has good signage, so you’ll know you are going the right way.\n\nTouring Delacorte Theater, The Shakespeare Garden, and Belvedere Castle\n\nYou’ll first come to Delacorte Theater. This open-air theater is probably most well known for its annual productions of Shakespeare in the Park, one of New York City’s most treasured traditions. There are two plays produced each summer, sometimes featuring very well-known actors. The tickets are free, you’ll have to wait in line on the day of the performance to get them.\n\nViews of Turtle Pond and Belvedere Castle can be seen from the theater area.\n\nThere are also restrooms at this location if you need them.\n\nYou will then pass the Shakespeare Garden. This beautiful English cottage-style garden is densely planted with trees, shrubs, flowers, and herbs that are mentioned in William Shakespeare’s writings. Dispersed among the plantings are bronze plaques with quotes from his plays and poems that reference the plants. It actually predates the theater itself, having been created in 1912 as a place for public school children to study the natural world, before it later became more focused on Shakespeare.\n\nAfter numerous periods of decline and overgrowth, the Shakespeare Garden in its current form has been restored and is maintained by the Central Park Conservancy.\n\nYou could spend quite a bit of time wandering around this four-acre space on its own, but our route will just take you past it. Staying on the path will bring you up the steps to Belvedere Castle.\n\nI have to admit, Belvedere Castle is one of my personal favorite sites in the park. The name Belvedere literally means “beautiful view” in Italian, and that’s what you get from this miniature castle built on an outcrop known as Vista Rock. It’s a great place for a bird’s eye view of some of Central Park’s beautiful landmarks; Delacorte Theater, the Great Lawn, the Turtle Pond and the Ramble. And it also provides a respite from the sun under a sheltered area of the main terrace, which we’ve parked our bikes under many times for a water break and a look out over the Turtle Pond.\n\nIn the center is a sculpture called The Angel of the Waters, referring to a gospel story about an angel giving healing powers to the Pool of Bethesda. Interestingly, it was the only statue funded by the city in the original design for the park, and the artist was the first woman to receive a public commission for a work of art in NYC. The statue also alludes to the Croton Aqueduct, the first pure water aqueduct in NYC, which opened in 1842 on the site of Central Park and was a pretty big deal when it opened. So some local history there to ponder!\n\nInherent to the design of the Terrace and Fountain area was the idea of “nature first”, as the point of all this grand design was for people to take a break from city life and come and enjoy nature. Accordingly, the carved panels around the base of the fountain depict natural themes: the Seasons, the Times of Day, and the Ages of Mankind. Heady stuff to consider while having an ice cream break and watching a green-painted actor pretend to be the Statue of Liberty. (Did she move? I saw her move…)\n\nJust for fun, take a look for turtles at the edge of the Lake. There are an incredible number of them living there, and unfortunately, they seem to have taken to begging like overfed park ducks.\n\nSo be mindful, visitors. Don’t feed the wildlife. (I’ve encountered an aggressive squirrel or two as well if they think you may be inclined to give them a snack. City critters don’t fool around.)\n\nAfter your little break at the Esplanade, progress toward the Terrace. The upper terrace offers a nice vantage point for people-watching and views of the Lake, and if so inclined, you can take one of the grand staircases on either side up to check that out. But our route takes you underneath, through the Bethesda Terrace Arcade, which is more interesting, we think.\n\nThe Arcade has a cathedral-like quality, featuring a stunning tiled ceiling of more than 15,000 encaustic tiles that were created by England’s famous Minton Tile Company. The “Mintons”, as they were generally called, were removed for a time due to structural weakness of the terrace, but were replaced, fully restored, in 2007. Often used for floors in the great cathedrals of Europe, this is the only place in the entire world where these exquisite tiles are used for a ceiling.\n\nPerhaps it is the Mintons, or just the arched stoned structure itself, that gives the Arcade beautiful acoustics. You will find artists and buskers of all kinds, singers, dancers, violinists, etc, taking advantage of the sound quality of the arcade to entertain passers-by. It is one of the most “New York” experiences one can have.\n\nPass on through the Arcade, and climb the stairs to The Mall. There are restrooms in the area of the stairs if you feel the need.\n\nThe Mall, The Dairy, Billionaire’s Row and the Gapstow Bridge\n\nOnce you are up the stairs, you come to the wide, tree-lined path known as the Mall, which runs through the middle of the park from 66th to 72nd street and is one of its original design features.\n\nTwo things will strike you when strolling along the path: the beauty of the many American elm trees planted there, and the broad width of the path itself. This is one of the largest plantings of the American Elm in existence, as they were popular back when the park was created, but are somewhat less common today. These large trees provide a glorious amount of shade and in fall they appear lit up with golden yellow tones.\n\nCentral Park FAQ’s:\n\nWhat are Central Park’s hours and when is the best time to visit Central Park?\n\nCentral Park is open from 6 am to 1 am every day.\n\nSpring and fall are our favorite times to visit Central Park, as the weather is more agreeable.\n\nThat being said, the Park is beautiful in all seasons and there are many events that take place there all year long. In summer, you may want to visit in the morning when it’s cooler and less crowded or in the evening for sunset viewing.\n\nLuckily, much of the walking path we have created for you is in shade!\n\nIs there a fee to enter Central Park?\n\nThere is no fee to enter the park, however certain attractions such as the Central Park Zoo, Wollman Rink, and boating rentals, require purchasing a ticket.\n\nThe good news is our walking tour will not cost you anything! ;)\n\nAre there places to eat in Central Park?\n\nThere are a few sit-down restaurants and snack bars in Central Park, but our opinion is - don’t bother. Places like the Loeb Boathouse, Le Pain Quotidien, Tavern on the Green, and Dancing Crane Cafe are all crowded and pricey. With so many hot dog carts and food vendors, we suggest just grabbing a snack or two and save your sit-down eating for outside the park.\n\nYou might also consider packing a picnic lunch. Many visitors enjoy picnicking in the Sheep Meadow (just west of the Mall) or the Great Lawn (north of the Turtle Pond). Or with over 9,000 benches in the park, you can surely find a spot to sit. In NYC, there is certainly no shortage of places to pick up a sandwich for your Central Park picnic.\n\nHow else can I get around Central Park besides walking?\n\nCentral Park is mostly closed to car traffic; at best it is very restricted.\n\nBicycling is very popular in Central Park and can be either a leisurely scenic ride or a workout on hilly terrain, depending on what route you take. Permits are not required but keep in mind that the routes are shared with runners, walkers, skaters, horse carriages, etc and this can make it challenging, especially on weekends and in nice weather when the drives tend to get congested.\n\nNeed to rent a bike? BikeRent NYC offers these two locations:\n\nGrand Army Plaza entrance to the Pond at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street.\n\nMerchants' Gate Plaza at Central Park South and Central Park West.\n\nRentals are seasonal and offered on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nPedicab sightseeing tours are offered through Peter Pan Tours. As you can see at this Travelocity link Peter Pan Tours gets great reviews.\n\nRegarding the famous horse-drawn carriage rides, we know that many tourists may want to have this fairy-tale experience, but here at The Empty Nest Explorers, we don’t support it. It’s been a controversial issue here in New York for many years, and just this week a horse collapsed in the street due to the summer heat. So we would rather not recommend it.\n\nAnything special for kids at Central Park?\n\nYes, of course! While everything on our walking tour is kid-friendly, there are a few spots in the park that are especially for children.\n\nThere are actually 21 varied and fun playgrounds throughout the park! Too many to mention in one blog post, but a list of them can be found here: https://www.centralpark.com/things-to-do/activities/playgrounds/#page=1\n\nThe Central Park Zoo is a popular spot, but in my opinion, it is only good for very little children. Older kids may find it a bit unexciting, as there aren't a whole lot of animals. There is also a fee to enter the zoo.\n\nHow do I rent a rowboat on the Lake?\n\nRowboat rentals and guided gondola tours are available on the Central Park Lake from April to November, weather permitting. The Loeb Boathouse has a large fleet of rowboats, each of which seats four people. At $20 an hour, it’s not a bad deal, but it should be noted that it’s cash only. Boating on the Lake is a great way to see waterfowl up close, including egrets, herons, ducks and even occasional loons.\n\nFor complete details, see https://www.centralpark.com/things-to-do/sports/boating\n\nWhere can I learn more about Central Park?\n\nVolumes can be written on Central Park, its history and all its goings-on. In this post, we have attempted to give the first-time visitor a good day trip plan, but there is much more to see and do. We are pretty sure you will fall in love with Central Park and want to visit many more times, so be sure to check out the official website for events and further info:\n\nhttps://www.centralpark.com/\n\nFor more information on the good work being done by the Central Park Conservancy:\n\nhttps://www.centralparknyc.org/\n\nIf you are looking for something to do after your Central Park visit check out our post on What to do in Chelsea, NYC."
