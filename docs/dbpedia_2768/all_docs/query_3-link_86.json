        "text": "Here’s a universal truth. No one enjoys doing college tours. Not the kids who have to spend spring break being shuttled from one indistinguishable campus to the next with barely enough time to really get a feel for the school. And certainly not Mom and Dad, who are doing the shuttling, not to mention dealing with the logistical nightmare of hitting up several colleges in seven days. What if there was a better way?\n\nThere is—for a price. “There is no reason that college tours have to be the most miserable experience, where you do one after the other and it’s town after town and you’re exhausted and you have listened to every undergraduate tell you what their favorite dining hall is,” says Kim-Marie Galloway, a vacation consigliere for the one percent at luxury travel agency Embark Beyond, who also happens to be the #IYKYK guru for college-focused itineraries that don’t inspire fear, loathing, and dread. She has quietly been offering this service for years—so quietly, in fact, that even her own clients are surprised to learn this is something they can ask for. “Oftentimes it’s me saying, ‘Hey, so-and-so is going to be a rising junior, let's talk about this.’ Or if they are going to be in New York anyway, I might suggest they at least drive the kids by NYU, or maybe there is a show they can see on campus,” she says. “And a lot of times they’re like, ‘You could do this for me? I didn’t think of that.’ ”\n\nJust as with her clients’ European summer grand tours and winters on Big Island, Galloway handles every last detail, from procuring the private campus tour guide, to sourcing tickets to football games and performances, to organizing informational meetings with professors, while also ensuring the family is eating, shopping, sightseeing, and sleeping in all the right 5-star places. “People who travel at this level, they’re always traveling,” she says, “so it’s about fitting the campus tours into the places they’re already going—and into something else that is enjoyable.” For example, she recently planned a Miami trip for a family that tallied up to around $40,000. What did that buy? Suites at the Faena, brunch at the Surf Club, shopping appointments for Mom at Chanel and Dior. The purpose of the trip, though, was for the kid to see the University of Miami, which the family did for an afternoon, followed by dinner at the Versace mansion. “I want people to realize that this can be fun,” Galloway says.\n\nBut for that to be the case, there are a few guidelines to follow, regardless of how much you’re spending. Rule #1: Pick the right time to go. Spoiler alert: it’s not going to be during spring break. “It's about getting to the school while it’s in session and feeling the vibe,” Galloway says. “How you get a feel for the college is to be there when it’s at its best. Go during a football game or when there is a performance. Go at a beautiful time—and when there are actual kids on campus.” Rule #2: It’s okay to skip the public tours. The idea that participating in these increases your chances of getting in is a myth, confirmed by several admissions officers Galloway has consulted. “If you’re on campus for 3 hours, you will have no feel for it at all,” she says. “You need to have enough time to see the school in action.” And check school websites to get a sense of what events and other resources are available. Rule #3: Don’t cluster colleges geographically. There is no need to visit a college just because it’s within a 50-mile radius of another. Instead, organize tours based on your kid’s passion. “Look within the circle of schools that specialize in what your child is interested in,” she says."
