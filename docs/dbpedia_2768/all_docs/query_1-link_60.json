        "text": "Surgicore Fifth Avenue Surgery Center (FASC) is a multi-specialty surgery center conveniently located on Manhattan’s Museum Mile. It is accredited by the Centers for Medicare Services, the New York Department of Health and the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Healthcare (AAAHC). With state-of-the-art equipment, spacious procedure rooms and attentive administrative staff, the Fifth Avenue Surgery Center is an excellent alternative to traditional hospitals.\n\nThis center features two operating rooms and a five bed post anesthesia care unit (PACU) where patients can safely recover. Same-day surgical procedures, diagnostic tests and preventive measures can be safely and efficiently done at our facility. Surgeons are free to use our diagnostic and imaging equipment, or they can continue working with the same vendors they know and trust.\n\nImpeccable Clinical Care Off the Museum Mile\n\nNew York City calls Fifth Avenue from 82nd to 105th streets the “Museum Mile” because of its museums, fine arts centers and cultural diversity. It’s a central spot for tourists as well as locals. The Fifth Avenue Surgery Center is roughly a mile from Mt. Sinai Hospital and has an exceptional team of board-certified anesthesiologists, nurses and administrative staff.\n\nOur same-day surgery center is conveniently located on 86th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues. It is easily accessible for both surgeons and patients, and surgeons are given complimentary parking. For public transportation, the bus and subway trains (4, 5 and 6) are most convenient. Over 60,000 patients have been treated at our facility.\n\nAbout Fifth Avenue Surgery Center\n\nFifth Avenue Surgery Center was first opened in 1990. In November 2016, the new capital was invested into the facility to upgrade medical equipment, train staff and secure a better financial position. A focus on high payout procedures is also part of the business strategy. The services performed at our facility include:\n\nGastroenterology\n\nOphthalmology\n\nOrthopedics\n\nPain management\n\nPlastic surgery\n\nPodiatry\n\nUrology\n\nAll services performed are done on an outpatient basis where patients receive general, local or regional anesthesia. Patients receive highly individualized care in a safe and luxurious setting. This is a better alternative to a traditional hospital where staff may be overworked, costs are higher and the risk for infection is greater. As a result, surgeons form positive rapports with their patients and earn higher satisfaction ratings that help them grow their private practice.\n\nAdvantages to Choosing FASC\n\nHospital-based procedures are no longer limited to the hospital setting. These procedures can be done on an outpatient basis, increasing patient outcomes. The benefits to working with Surgicore at FASC include:\n\nHighly skilled clinical and administrative staff\n\nState-of-the-art equipment and supplies tailored to surgeon needs\n\nGreater autonomy over the work environment\n\nCost-effective procedures that save money for everyone\n\nMore control over scheduling - no delays or rescheduling\n\nIndividualized, quality care for patients\n\nFocus on a small number of patients in a single setting"
