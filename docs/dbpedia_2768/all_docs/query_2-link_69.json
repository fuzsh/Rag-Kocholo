The building is architecturally significant with its unmistakable limestone façade and trapezoidal extension above the roof line.\n\nStill, this is a white glove, full service, 5th Avenue cooperative building that is handsome at street level with its manicured landscaping and granite sidewalk. Completed in 1979, 1001 Fifth Avenue has 23 floors and contains 76 spacious 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms units. The oversized bay windows offer amazing views of the West Side, Central Park, and the spectacular Metropolitan Museum of Art across the street.\n\nBuilding amenities include a doorman, concierge, Live-in Super, laundry, storage facilities, fitness room, and a garage. Pied-à-terres are allowed and the building is pet friendly.\n\nLocated between East 81st & East 82nd Streets in the heart of New York’s “Museum Mile,” 1001 5th Avenue boasts easy access to Central Park, Madison Avenue shopping, restaurants, museums and cultural institutions.\n\nDescription Provided by Duncan A.
