        "text": "Are you looking for the perfect 2 day itinerary for NYC?\n\nI can help! If you only have two days to spend in New York City, then you need a 2 day itinerary for NYC that will give you the most bang for your buck. NYC is my happy place and I absolutely love to share tips for visiting my favorite city.\n\nOver the many years of living and visiting New York, I’ve learned a thing or too about balancing the urge to see and do everything, with the reality of time and energy!\n\nI know you want to see as much as you can in just 2 days and it might feel overwhelming, but don’t worry, you can squeeze in a lot, in a short time.\n\nSure, 2 days is not as great as 3 or 20 days, but this 2 day itinerary for NYC includes the iconic, must-see spots and will leave you looking forward to another visit to see even more of this great city.\n\nGear up for a fun-filled tour of the Big Apple!\n\n2 Day Itinerary for New York City\n\nI’ve created a 2 day itinerary of NYC that will cover some of the most fun parts of the city. You can mix it up a bit based on your schedule, but use this as an outline to hit all the top places and some hidden gems as well.\n\nYour 2 days will cover the highlights of uptown and lower Manhattan. I’ve trimmed off some time consuming activities in exchange for some other great choices.\n\nMy Pro Tips:\n\n→ MAKE DINNER RESERVATIONS in advance! There are so many amazing restaurants in New York, that you should plan ahead if you can so you won’t stress later.\n\n→ BUY Broadway show tix in advance! Research Broadway shows, comedy shows, or Lincoln Center performances that you may want to see on one of your NYC nights. Download the Today Tix app on your phone now and start searching for show tickets. Any choice you make will be a good one because NYC is the best theater town in the world. The theaters are pretty intimate, so don’t feel pressured to buy the most expensive seats, you’ll be able to see well from any part of the theater.\n\nDay One of 2 Days in NYC: Uptown\n\nThis is your uptown day! The Uptown & Central Park neighborhoods include both the Upper East Side and Upper West Side.\n\nKnown for upscale residences, elegant brownstones, and Museum Mile, these neighborhoods are filled with tree lined streets and have primary access to the stunning green space of Manhattan known as Central Park. Get ready to see some of the best stuff that NYC has to offer!\n\nMorning: Central Park & The Met\n\nVisit Central Park -Grab breakfast and start your morning off in every New Yorker’s favorite park. The iconic Central Park has 842 acres of greenery, lakes, walking trails, and history.\n\nTake a guided walking tour or do it DIY to get acquainted with all there is to see and do here. Be sure to stop by the Bethesda Fountain, walk on the Mall, and stroll on the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir Running Path.\n\nVisit the Metropolitan Museum of Art- Exit the park at 81st St. and 5th Avenue to enter the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Open 7 days per week from 9:30 – 5:30 and 9PM on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nWith only 2 days in the city, you can’t possibly visit all the museums and attractions, but the Met is non-negotiable in my book. The morning is the best time to go because it may be less crowded. Find your favorite section or head for the current exhibit. Be sure to enjoy the architecture as well as the art in this magnificent and world renowned museum.\n\n→ Book a walking tour of Central Park Here!\n\nAfternoon: Lunch at The Plaza & Rockefeller Center & Empire State Building\n\nLunch at The Plaza – When you leave the Met, walk south through the park and pass by the Central Park Zoo and walk along 5th Avenue until you reach the famed Pulitzer Fountain at Grand Army Plaza. Here, you’ll enter the one and only Plaza Hotel.\n\nIf you can get a table in the main dining room, The Palm Court, then do it! If not, The Champagne Bar will likely have a table and it is very lovely, with a great menu, perfect for your lunch at The Plaza with Eloise!\n\nVisit Rockefeller Center – After lunch, continue south on 5th Avenue for some window shopping until you hit 50th St. and see Rockefeller Center. You’ll find the Atlas statue, the ice skating rink, the flags, the fountain, and can get a pic in front of Radio City Music Hall.\n\nIf you have time, walk 20 more blocks (another 20 minutes) down 5th Avenue, passing the New York City Library at 42nd St. & 5th Avenue. before coming to the iconic Empire State Building at 34th St. & 5th Avenue. Both these landmarks are gorgeous inside and out.\n\nThe Empire State Building however, requires tickets and time waiting in line, etc, so you may have to pass on this particular adventure for this trip, and catch it the next time!\n\nEvening: Midtown – Dinner in Times Square & Broadway Show\n\nTimes Square – Continue on to 42nd St. & Broadway. You are now heading directly into Times Square. Hold on to your hat, and be prepared for a crowded, loud, and busy scene!\n\nIf you’ve never been, it can be a bit overwhelming. Everywhere you look will be filled with lights and sounds and street performers. You’ll see where the ball drops at New Year’s Eve, the famous billboards, and you can climb the steps above the TKTS office to get a birds eye view of the square.\n\nDinner Before the Show – Dos Caminos at 47th St. & Broadway for Mexican food.\n\nI always recommend this restaurant because the food is consistently great, there are always tables available, the prices are decent, and most of all because it’s close to all the theaters. You can relax during dinner knowing that you’re just steps away from your show.\n\nHead to the theater and enjoy the show! Check your tix for the show time, so you aren’t late!\n\nAfter The Show\n\nEnjoy a New York tradition and have some drinks after the show. Here are some special places in the Theater District:\n\nLillie’s Victorian Establishment – 249 W 49th St. & Broadway – An antique laden Victorian themed bar named for actress Lillie Langtry.\n\nSt. Cloud Rooftop Bar – 6 Times Sq. Broadway & 6th Ave. 17th Floor – A luxury rooftop bar in the sky!\n\nBar 54 – 135 W 45th St. &6th Ave. – The top of the Hyatt Centric with river to river views.\n\nDay Two of 2 Days in NYC: Lower Manhattan\n\nLower Manhattan is known for being the financial district (FiDi), which includes Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange. This part of the city features historic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, Battery Park, and the World Trade Center. I love how these neighborhoods blend modern skyscrapers with original cobblestone streets.\n\nThis full day downtown will give you a great taste of what there is to see and do in the lower part of the island.\n\nMorning: Battery Park & The Statue of Liberty & Financial District (FiDi)\n\nBattery Park – Head to Battery Park along the New York Harbor to see the iconic Statue of Liberty. It’s a special site to see for sure, but I don’t think you need to take the time for the boat ride and tours during this brief visit. I suggest instead that you get a great view of her from the land. If you want to take the time to visit the statue then click here for more info.\n\nWall St. – After soaking up the view, head to Wall St. & Broad St. to see the New York Stock Exchange Building. The opening bell is at 9:30 AM on weekdays. Visitors are not allowed inside but feel free to take photos in front with The Fearless Girl statue. She’s a 4 foot statue made in 2017 to honor International Women’s Day.\n\nCharging Bull– Next walk a few blocks to Bowling Green Park, at Morris St. for photos with the infamous Charging Bull statue.\n\nFun Fact: In 1989 Arturo Di Modica placed the 7000 pound bronze bull in front of the Stock Exchange building. It was later moved to the Bowling Green spot because members of the Stock Exchange complained. In 2017, the Fearless Girl was placed staring down the nose of the Charging Bull, but then Di Modica complained! So, the Girl was moved to the front of the Stock Exchange.\n\nAfternoon: Lunch at the Oculus &The 9/11 Memorial & Museum & Freedom Tower\n\nLunch at the Oculus – From the Charging Bull, take a 4 minute walk to the Oculus and the 9/11 Memorial Plaza. You’ll find lunch (and bathrooms) in The Oculus, the shopping center and transportation hub designed by Santiago Calatrava, resembling a dove leaving a child’s hands.\n\nVisit the 9/11 Memorial Plaza – Across from the Oculus is the plaza that honors the people killed on 9/11/2001 and in the World Trade Center bombing on 2/26/1993. It’s lovely in both design and significance. Spend time at the twin reflecting pools surrounded by names of victims and find the Callery Pear tree, known as the Survivor Tree. This was the only living tree after 9/11 and was saved and replanted when the memorial site was completed.\n\nThe memorial site is free and open to the public between 10 AM – 5 PM daily. The 9/11 Memorial Museum is open Thursday – Monday 10AM – 5PM.\n\nIf you don’t have time to visit the museum, not to worry, there’s a lot to experience by just wandering around the area.\n\nLate Afternoon: Little Italy & Chinatown\n\nBe sure to have your walking shoes on to make the 25 minute walk, north along Center Street, to New York City’s treasures of Little Italy and Chinatown. Yes, these neighborhoods are side by side and are a fun and uplifting compliment after visiting the Financial District.\n\nChinatown – is centered between Mott Street, Bleecker Street, and Chatham Square. This is one of the oldest Chinatowns in the country. Expect to see many shops selling fruits and vegetables as well as fish and herbs. You may be approached by people selling handbags and other random items. Don’t ever feel obligated to purchase anything if you don’t want to. But take the opportunity to buy souvenirs if you choose.\n\nLittle Italy – is centered around Mulberry St., adjacent to Chinatown. The large concentration of Italian immigrants moved here in the 1840’s and the traditions remain very vibrant today. Enjoy the smells of food and the sounds of music. Of course, stop for some cannoli if you need a little pick me up.\n\nExtra Time? Add a trip to Chelsea for a stroll on the High Line or a snack at Pier 57!\n\nEvening: The West Village\n\nThe West Village is the neighborhood known for its charming streets and historic brownstones. The Hudson River is to the west, Seventh Avenue South is to the east, 14th Street is to the north, and Houston Street is to the south.\n\nThe West Village is the center of New York University campuses, has a bohemian atmosphere, and vibrant arts scene. You might be familiar with its history as a hub for artists, writers, and activists.\n\nFrom Chinatown, take a 30 minute, 1.5 mile, walk north on Mott Street heading toward Washington Square Park, with its landmark arch built in 1892, in the heart of Greenwich Village. The park will be bustling in the early evening. Look for the oldest tree in Manhattan in the northwest corner of the park. It’s known as the Hangman’s Elm and is over 300 years old!\n\nIt’s time for you to move towards your dinner spot. Choose from the following in this neighborhood:\n\nLure Fishbar – 142 Mercer St. This is my favorite sushi restaurant in a great atmosphere.\n\nWaverly Inn – 16 Bank St. This is a cozy spot with great drinks and hearty American fare.\n\nDante – 79 Macdougal St. This is an historic Italian cafe in the Village known for being the world’s best bar.\n\nLola Taverna – 210 6th Ave. Come here for some of the best Greek & Mediterranean food you’ll ever have!\n\nEnjoy the evening continuing to wander the famous streets of Bleecker, MacDougal, and Prince. These spots were home to artists such as Bob Dylan and Jackson Pollack. You can also see the historic Federal style homes from the 1800’s and find alleys where the wealthy kept their horse stables.\n\nFun Facts: The Friends apartment building at 90 Bedford St. & Grove St. is the exterior of the show’s famous apartments of our favorite Friends.\n\nSex In The City’s Carrie Bradshaw (not to be confused with me) apartment location\n\nat 64 Perry St. While the show had Carrie living at 245 E. 73rd St.,the exterior shots were actually in the Village.\n\nAfter Dinner: Downtown Speakeasies\n\nManhattan has a secret nightlife hidden behind random doors. Check out a speakeasy for an after dinner drink. These are a couple of my favorites:\n\nThe Back Room – 102 Norfolk St. Look for The Lower East Side Toy Company sign on a little gate, walk down the steps into the alley and then up a staircase with toy cars displayed on the landing. Look for Laurel & Hardy telling you to Be Quiet in the Alley. This door is the same hidden entrance from the original 1920’s speakeasy. You’ll enjoy your cocktails in tea cups while you sit on velvet sofas and listen to music.\n\nThe Garret West – 7th & Bleeker St. Walk into the Five Guys Restaurant, but don’t order anything because you’re looking for the hidden staircase in the back. There you’ll find a beautiful speakeasy club famous for its delicious cocktails.\n\nWhere to stay in NYC\n\nI’ve pounded the pavement for you finding the safest places to stay in NYC. Among them you should be able to find great and affordable choices.\n\nHere are quick pick recs for a budget hotel downtown, a mid-range hotel uptown, and a luxury hotel in midtown. All with great reviews.\n\n* Be Aware that hotel prices fluctuate A LOT, depending on what else is happening in the city and when you go.\n\n→ Best Budget Spot – Arlo Soho -231 Hudson St.\n\nArlo Soho is in the heart of Greenwich Village, has a rooftop bar, and views of the river.\n\n→ Best Mid-Range Spot – The Hotel Beacon – 2130 Broadway\n\nThe Hotel Beacon is a historic building on the Upper West Side with apartment style rooms near Central Park.\n\n→ Best Luxury Spot – Lotte New York Palace – 455 Madison Ave.\n\nLotte New York Palace was formerly the historic Villard Mansion, on Madison Avenue.\n\n→ Check Out Great Vacation Rentals in NYC Here!\n\nGetting Around NYC\n\nOn your 2 day trip to NYC, I suggest a combo of walking and ride shares. The subway is efficient, but it’s fun to stay above ground to see more on such a short visit.\n\nWalking Around NYC\n\nWalking is the best way to get around NYC. It’s fun, safe, and helps you experience the city more fully.\n\nNYC By Subway\n\nSubways are the most common and convenient way to get around NYC. A lot of the trains have been updated, which makes it a bit cleaner.But don’t be surprised if you see some unsightly things down there. It can be pretty funky at times.\n\nHere are tips if you plan to ride the subway:\n\nPRO TIP #1: Download the official MY MTA App (Metropolitan Transit Authority) on your phone. You’ll find maps and schedules for all the subways, bus, and rail systems.\n\nPRO TIP #2: With your Maps/GPS App on your phone, use the “transit” view to find exactly where the closest subway station is and which train to take to your destination.\n\nPRO TIP #3: Make sure you have your credit card loaded on your phone in your “wallet.” When you open that card, simply TAP the OMNY screen at the turnstile of the subway stop and it charges you. Just like that!\n\nPRO TIP #4: You can purchase a Metrocard card on your phone or at a subway station to use on buses also. Each ride costs $2.90, and a 7 day, unlimited ride card is $33. You can also swipe through the turnstile and pass the card to your travel partner behind you. Do that for up to 4 people.\n\nPRO TIP #5: If you download an OMNY card and use the same card or device for 12 rides in a week, the rest of the week is free.\n\nNYC By Uber, Lyft, Revel, or Taxi\n\nRide share apps are great for getting around NYC, especially at night. Obviously, they’re more expensive if you are alone, but when with a group of people, it’s often more cost effective than paying for separate subway fares.\n\nPRO TIP #6: Load all the apps onto your phone in advance. Check prices for Uber, Lyft, and Revel to compare. Prices will vary a lot at different times of the day. Taxis are also available everywhere, but you have to hail one from the curb. If the cab light is on that means it’s available. There’s a Curb App available for download, but I’ve been told the cabs don’t come as quickly as the other ride shares do.\n\nNYC By Ferry\n\nAnother fun transportation choice for parts of the city is the ferry system. It only takes you to certain spots, which might not be part of your 2 day itinerary. But check it out if you want to add some boat rides to the trip.\n\nThe NYC Ferries travel from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island along the East River and Hudson River. You’ll take the ferry when visiting The Statue of Liberty or taking a sunset cruise. City views are awesome from the river!\n\nPRO TIP #7: Download the NYC Ferry App by Hornblower onto your phone. You can buy ferry tix on your phone and get a QR code to be scanned as you board the boat.\n\nBest Time To Go To New York City\n\nI love New York all times of the year, but here are things to consider in your plans for a 2 day NYC itinerary:\n\nMid June through Early July and Mid August through September are the most popular times to visit NYC. The warm, but not too hot weather is lovely. The middle of the summer can be pretty hot!\n\nFall is ideal with temps in the 60’s and 70’ fahrenheit. The crowds are smaller, the sun is warm, the trees are turning, and the air is clear.\n\nNovember and December are the most festive season to visit New York. Enjoy all the winter pop-up activities, decorations, and of course, the New Year’s Eve extravaganza! Check out The Things To Do In New York City At Christmas here!\n\nFebruary and March are also fun because it’s snowy, not very busy, and the prices are better! Bundle up with layers, and be prepared with umbrellas and all-weather shoes!\n\nHope you enjoyed your 2 Day Itinerary for NYC!\n\nIn a nutshell…\n\nFrom the towering skyscrapers of Lower Manhattan to the artistic vibe of the West Village and the serene beauty of Central Park, you’ve got a taste of the diverse and vibrant energy that makes New York City so special.\n\nWhether you’re loving the culinary delights of Chinatown and Little Italy or exploring the museums of the Upper East Side, there’s always something fun and exciting around every corner in NYC.\n\nEnjoy your adventure in the city that never sleeps, and don’t forget to leave some time for those unexpected moments that make NYC unforgettable!"
