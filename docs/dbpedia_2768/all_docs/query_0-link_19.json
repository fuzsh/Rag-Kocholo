Moore (1827–1891)—the creative force who led Tiffany & Co. to unparalleled originality and success during the second half of the 19th century—amassed a vast collection of decorative arts of exceptional quality and in various media, from Greek and Roman glass and Japanese baskets to metalwork from the Islamic world. The objects were a source of inspiration for Moore, a noted silversmith in his own right, as well as the designers he supervised. The exhibition Collecting Inspiration: Edward C. Moore at Tiffany & Co. (opening June 9, 2024) will feature more than 180 extraordinary examples from Moore’s personal collection, which he bequeathed to The Met, alongside 70 magnificent silver objects designed at Tiffany & Co. under his direction. Drawn primarily from the Museum’s holdings, the display will also include seldom-seen examples from a dozen private and public lenders. A defining figure in the history of American silver, Moore played a pivotal role in shaping the legendary Tiffany design aesthetic and the evolution of The Met’s collection.\n\nContinue reading “‘Collecting Inspiration: Edward C. Moore at Tiffany & Company’ at The Met” →\n\n‘Weaving Abstraction in Ancient and Modern Art” at The Met Fifth Avenue\n\nThe process of creating textiles has long been a springboard for artistic invention. In Weaving Abstraction in Ancient and Modern Art, two extraordinary bodies of work separated by at least 500 years are brought together to explore the striking connections between artists of the ancient Andes and those of the 20th century. The exhibition, which will open at The Met on March 5, 2024, will feature textiles by four distinguished modern practitioners—Anni Albers, Sheila Hicks, Lenore Tawney, and Olga de Amaral—alongside pieces by Andean artists from the first millennium BCE to the 16th century, who, though their names are largely unknown to us, created works of exceptional technical and formal refinement.\n\nThe exhibition is made possible by The Modern Circle.\n\nContinue reading “‘Weaving Abstraction in Ancient and Modern Art” at The Met Fifth Avenue” →\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art to Present ‘Indian Skies: The Howard Hodgkin Collection of Indian Court Painting’\n\nWidely regarded as one of the finest of its kind, British artist Howard Hodgkin’s collection of Indian paintings includes works created at the Mughal, Deccan, Rajput, and Pahari courts dating from the 16th to the 19th century. Opening at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on February 6, 2024, the exhibition Indian Skies: The Howard Hodgkin Collection of Indian Court Painting will present a unique and personal vision of India’s great painting tradition through newly acquired works from the artist’s collection. In 2022, The Met announced a major acquisition of more than 80 drawings and paintings from the Howard Hodgkin Collection.\n\nContinue reading “The Metropolitan Museum of Art to Present ‘Indian Skies: The Howard Hodgkin Collection of Indian Court Painting’” →\n\nThe Met Announces 2024 Commissions ~ Petrit Halilaj in The Roof Garden ~ Lee Bul in The Met Facade Niches ~ Tong Yang-Tze in The Great Hall\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art announced today the artists for the 2024 contemporary commissions.

Matisse, Derain, and the Origins of Fauvism’ to Open at The Met Fifth Avenue\n\nHenri Matisse (1869–1954) and André Derain (1880–1954) embarked on a creative partnership in the summer of 1905 that would change the course of French painting. The two painters daringly experimented with energetic bursts of color, form, and structure, the outcome of which led to a bold, new artistic language known as Fauvism (from the French fauve, or “wild beast”). Opening at The Met on October 13, 2023, Vertigo of Color: Matisse, Derain, and the Origins of Fauvism will present, for the first time in the United States, the legacy of that legendary summer through 65 paintings, drawings, and watercolors by Matisse and Derain on loan from national and international museums and private collections.\n\nContinue reading “‘Vertigo of Color. Matisse, Derain, and the Origins of Fauvism’ to Open at The Met Fifth Avenue” →\n\nHow American Artists Responded to the Tumult of the 1930s ~ ‘Art for the Millions’ at The Met\n\nThe 1930s was a decade of political and social upheaval in the United States, and the art and visual culture of the time reflected the unsettled environment. Americans searched for their cultural identity during the Great Depression, a period marked by divisive politics, threats to democracy, and intensified social activism, including a powerful labor movement. Featuring more than 100 works from The Met collection and several lenders, Art for the Millions: American Culture and Politics in the 1930s explores how artists expressed political messages and ideologies through a range of media, from paintings, sculptures, prints, and photographs to film, dance, decorative arts, fashion, and ephemera. Highlights include paintings by Georgia O’Keeffe, Charles Sheeler, and Stuart Davis; prints by Elizabeth Olds, Dox Thrash, and Riva Helfond; photographs by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange; footage of Martha Graham’s dance Frontier; and more. The exhibition is on view September 7 through December 10, 2023.\n\nContinue reading “How American Artists Responded to the Tumult of the 1930s ~ ‘Art for the Millions’ at The Met” →\n\nThe Met Unveils Nairy Baghramian’s Colorful Abstract Sculptures for the Museum’s Facade\n\nThe Met unveiled today four new sculptures by Nairy Baghramian (German citizen, born Iran 1971) for the Museum’s facade. This is the first public installation by the artist in New York City. Baghramian’s cast aluminum polychrome sculptures feature components that seem to have washed up like flotsam and jetsam in the voids of their respective niches. These abstract forms at the threshold of the Museum present a metaphor of the institution as a filter of historical fragments deemed representative or exemplary. The project’s title Scratching the Back—a distortion of the idiom “scratch the surface”—alludes to the need to move beyond superficially constructed cultural narratives. The Facade Commission: Nairy Baghramian, Scratching the Back will be on view through May 28, 2024.\n\nContinue reading “The Met Unveils Nairy Baghramian’s Colorful Abstract Sculptures for the Museum’s Facade” →\n\n‘Picasso: A Cubist Commission in Brooklyn’ to Open at The Met Fifth Avenue\n\nThe Met will open Picasso: A Cubist Commission in Brooklyn, the first exhibition dedicated to a captivating, but lesser-known chapter in the Cubist period of Pablo Picasso (1881–1973). In 1910, while making radical formal experiments with the human figure that brought him to the brink of abstraction, the artist embarked on a decorative commission for the Brooklyn residence of artist, collector, and critic Hamilton Easter Field (1873–1922). While the commission ultimately went unrealized, it served as a catalyst for Picasso’s exploration of Cubism, as he worked, abandoned, and reworked the panels in various studios in France. This focused exhibition will bring together for the first time six paintings linked to the commission—a group of figure and still life compositions—along with related works and archival material.

Born only two years apart, Édouard Manet (1832–1883) and Edgar Degas (1834–1917) were friends, rivals, and, at times, antagonists whose work shaped the development of modernist painting in France. By examining the ways in which their careers intersected and presenting their work side by side, this exhibition investigates how their artistic objectives and approaches both overlapped and diverged.\n\nContinue reading “‘Manet/Degas’, a Major Exhibition to Open at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, September 24th” →\n\nDiscovery and Play in The Met’s New 81st Street Studio!\n\nOn September 9, The Metropolitan Museum of Art will open the newly designed 81st Street Studio, a science and art play space for children ages 3 to 11, in the Ruth and Harold D.

Through some 160 works, it will explore the comprehensive and far-reaching ways in which Black artists portrayed everyday modern life in the new Black cities that took shape in the 1920s–40s in New York City’s Harlem and Chicago’s South Side and nationwide in the early decades of the Great Migration when millions of African Americans began to move away from the segregated rural South. The first survey of the subject in New York City since 1987, the exhibition will establish the Harlem Renaissance as the first African American–led movement of international modern art and will situate Black artists and their radically new portrayals of the modern Black subject as central to our understanding of international modern art and modern life.\n\nContinue reading “The Met to Unveil Groundbreaking Exhibition ‘The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism’ in early 2024” →\n\n‘Richard Avedon: Murals’ at The Met, Celebrating the Centennial of the Famed Photographers Birth in 1923\n\nTo celebrate the centennial of Richard Avedon’s birth in 1923, The Metropolitan Museum of Art will present a selection of the photographer’s most innovative group portraits in the exhibition Richard Avedon: MURALS, opening January 19, 2023. Although Avedon first earned his reputation as a fashion photographer in the late 1940s, his greatest achievement was his stunning reinvention of the photographic portrait. Focused on the short period between 1969 and 1971, this exhibition will explore a critical juncture in the artist’s career, when, after a hiatus from portraiture, he began working with a new camera and a new sense of scale. The exhibition will be organized around three monumental photomurals in The Met collection (the largest measures nearly 10 x 35 feet) that depict the era’s preeminent artists, activists, and politicians. Uniting the murals with session outtakes and contemporaneous projects, the exhibition will track Avedon’s evolving approach to group portraiture, through which he transformed the conventions of the genre.\n\nContinue reading “‘Richard Avedon: Murals’ at The Met, Celebrating the Centennial of the Famed Photographers Birth in 1923” →\n\nKarl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty at The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nThe Costume Institute’s spring 2023 exhibition will examine the work of Karl Lagerfeld (1933–2019).

The gods could perish, and some were born anew, providing a model of regeneration and resilience. Opening November 21, 2022, at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the exhibition Lives of the Gods: Divinity in Maya Art will bring together nearly 100 rarely seen masterpieces and recent discoveries in diverse media—from the monumental to the miniature—that depict episodes in the life cycle of the gods, from the moment of their birth to resplendent transformations as blossoming flowers or fearsome creatures of the night. Created by masters of the Classic period (A.D. 250–900) in the spectacular royal cities in the tropical forests of what is now Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, these landmark works evoke a world in which the divine, human, and natural realms are interrelated and intertwined. Lenders include major museum collections in Europe, Latin America, and the United States, and many of these works have never been exhibited in the U.S., including new discoveries from Palenque (Mexico) and El Zotz (Guatemala).\n\nContinue reading “The Met to Present ‘Lives of the Gods: Divinity in Maya Art’ on November 21, 2022” →\n\nArtist Hew Locke Unveiled ‘Gilt’ ~ The Met’s 2022 Facade\n\nA nice update to share ~ Hew Locke shortlisted for Apollo Magazine’s Artist of the Year (December 2, 2022).\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art announced that Guyanese-British artist Hew Locke has been selected to create new works for The Met Fifth Avenue’s facade niches, the third in a new series of site-specific commissions for the exterior of the Museum.

Opening April 11, 2022, Winslow Homer: Crosscurrents will reconsider the artist’s work through the lens of conflict, a theme that spans his prolific career.

The centerpiece of the exhibition will be The Met’s iconic The Gulf Stream, a painting that reveals Homer’s lifelong engagement with the charged subjects of race, geopolitics, and nature.
