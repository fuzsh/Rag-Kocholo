Culture is at the center of New York’s recovery, and we are grateful to the institutions and cultural workers who are committed to bringing us this staple of the city’s cultural scene.”\n\nHere are some highlights from each museum:\n\nThe Africa Center\n\nThe Africa Center presents “Home Is Where The Music Is,” a special multimedia presentation and discussion celebrating the sounds of Africa and its Diaspora interspersed with photography, art, video, and music featuring broadcaster Georges Collinet and media hub for African music, Jolly Papa.

The series connects World Africa Day to Juneteenth, two celebrations that are significant to both people of African descent around the world and people of African descent in the United States.\n\ntheafricacenter.org, 1280 Fifth Avenue between 109th and 110th Street Streets\n\nEl Museo del Barrio\n\nCurrently on view through September 26th, ESTAMOS BIEN – LA TRIENAL 20/21 is El Museo’s first national survey of Latinx art, featuring more than 40 artists from across the United States and Puerto Rico, and addressing such pressing issues as identity politics, gentrification and displacement, climate change, as well as the particular effects of the global pandemic, especially as it relates to Latinx populations.
