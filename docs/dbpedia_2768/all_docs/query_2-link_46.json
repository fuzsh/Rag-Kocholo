        "text": "Central Park West, at West 79th Street New York, NY\n\n212.769.5100\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History is one of the biggest and most-respected museums in the world. Located adjacent to Central Park, this institution is made up of 25 interconnected buildings that are home to 46 permanent exhibitions halls and their world-renowned library.\n\nWithin these storied and scholarly walls are entire exhibition halls devoted to African mammals, meteorites, human origins, gems and minerals, ocean life, fossils, and nature, as well as a massive planetarium.\n\n200 Eastern Parkway New York, NY 11238\n\n718.638.5000\n\nwebsite: www.brooklynmuseum.org\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum of Art is the second largest in the five boroughs, and the permanent collection here boasts more than one and a half million pieces running the gamut from contemporary art installations to their famous Ancient Egyptian collection.\n\nThe 560,000-square-foot, Beaux-Arts building is the anchor of parks and garden complex that also features the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Prospect Park Zoo. The Brooklyn Museum of Art has a well-developed collection of American art, with many pieces that vistors will recognize from their school-day textbooks.\n\n1071 Fifth Avenue New York, NY 10128\n\n(212) 423-3500\n\nOpened in 1959, New York City’s Guggenheim Museum was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and has become a significant architectural landmark. Their collection is focused on modern and contemporary art, and is the main hub of the global network of Guggenheim Museums.\n\nThe main rotunda here is a breathtaking setting for the museum’s refined collection of artworks, and the Wright restaurant continues the stunning theme while providing a beautiful place to sit down for a meal. The Guggenheim is open year-round, and counts among the highlights of their permanent collection several Picasso’s and Lichtenstein’s.\n\n1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street New York, NY\n\n212.535.7710\n\nwebsite: www.metmuseum.org\n\nKnown simply as “The Met” around town, New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of the nation’s foremost cultural institutions, serving guests both domestic and foreign since 1872. The museum is the most visited in America, but the building can accommodate plenty of visitors as it occupies a quarter-mile stretch of Manhattan’s Museum Mile.\n\nOverlooking Central Park, The Met contains over two million works of art which are distributed throughout nineteen curatorial departments. Their collection spans styles from all over the world, and is one of the most comprehensive in existence.\n\nCentral Park West, at 81st Street New York, NY\n\n212.769.5100\n\nwebsite: www.amnh.org\n\nThis brand new, state-of-the-art center takes visitors from the inner workings of our planet to the outer limits of the galaxy. The 87-foot-tall glowing sphere which appears to float in a glass-walled cube houses the new Hayden Planetarium, featuring the most technologically advanced space theater in the world, in which visitors can experience space shows of incredible realism.\n\nThe Big Bang Theater is a dramatic re-creation of the first minutes of the origins of the universe, examining issues such as how the universe evolved and providing an understanding of this theory for all ages."
