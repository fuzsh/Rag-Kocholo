        "text": "New Yorkers and tourists can spend tonight at the museum for free.\n\nThe 31st annual Museum Mile Festival takes place from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. along Manhattan's Fifth Avenue rain or shine. Fifth Avenue will be closed to traffic.\n\nVisitors can walk the mile from 82nd Street to 105th Street and visit nine of the city's finest cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Special exhibitions and works from permanent collections are on view inside the museums' galleries.\n\nLive music is being featured in front of each museum. Pablo Mayor and Folklore Urbano will be performing outside El Museo del Barrio and Hayes Greenfield Jazz Duo will be playing outside the National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts.\n\nThe festival's opening ceremony is at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, where visitors can see a Frank Lloyd Wright exhibit.\n\nNot a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright? That's okay, there are plenty of museums and exhibits to choose from. The Museum of the City of New York is featuring localized exhibits called Stoops of New York and Amsterdam/New Amsterdam. The Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum has an eco-friendly exhibit called Design for the Living World, featuring works that tell a unique story about the life-cycle of materials and the power of conservation and design."
