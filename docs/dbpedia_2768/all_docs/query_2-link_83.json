        "text": "New York is a great city with enormous leisure possibilities whatever the time of year you travel to the city.\n\nIt has become one of the great cultural centers of the planet thanks to its museums of all kinds for all tastes and there is no doubt that a tour of the best museums in New York is one of the essential plans to do there, but which ones can not be missed?\n\n1. 9/11 Museum\n\nFor all those people who in one way or another witnessed the events of September 1, 2001, visiting the National September 11 Memorial & Museum is a very emotional moment during a trip to New York. The world was paralyzed by the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers and the Manhattan skyline changed forever that morning.\n\nWith this audio tour ticket to the 9/11 Museum, you will have direct access to the museum itself and the 9/11 memorial where you can learn more about this episode in the history of the United States and the heroic response of New York City to the terrible event.\n\nA visit to remember, what is the 9/11 Museum like?\n\nThis museum documents the history and significance of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, through an extensive collection of more than 10,000 objects that bear witness to that tragic date.\n\nOn the day of my visit I started at the Memorial Plaza, two huge water fountains with waterfalls located in the exact spot where the towers once stood. The sight is absolutely breathtaking in its emotional significance. On the edges of the fountains you can read on bronze plaques the names of the people who perished in the attacks.\n\nVisiting the living history of 9/11\n\nThe museum is located underneath the Memorial Plaza, inside the remains of the original World Trade Center structure. After passing through the security arch, there is nothing that can prepare you for what you will see inside the 9/11 Museum as it stirs up many emotions and it is impossible not to have a lump in your throat throughout the tour.\n\nThe remains of the original columns of the Twin Towers, the stairs by which hundreds of people tried to flee for their lives, as well as the objects of the victims recovered from the rubble and the testimonies of the survivors.\n\nMany people sacrificed their lives that day to save the lives of others and thanks to all those anonymous heroes, hundreds of people managed to survive.\n\nPractical information\n\nWhere is the 9/11 Museum: 180 Greenwich Street in the World Trade Center, south of Manhattan.\n\nHow long does it take to see it: Because of the significance of this museum, it is a place that should be seen at your own pace. My advice is to set aside a minimum of 2 hours to visit it.\n\nHours: The 9/11 Museum is open on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays from 9AM to 8PM and on Fridays and Saturdays from 9AM to 21PM.\n\nHow to get there: Bus lines M5, M20, M22 / Metro Chambers Street (lines A, C, 1, 2 and 3), Park Place (lines 2 and 3), World Trade Center (line E) and Fulton Street (lines A, C, J, Z, 2, 3, 3, 4 and 5).\n\nExtra information: please refer to our article on 9/11 Memorial Tickets and Tours in NYC.\n\n2. Natural History Museum\n\nAnother of the best museums in New York is the Museum of Natural History. Many people will know it from the movie \"Night at the Museum\" by Ben Stiller, especially the younger ones. However, although its collection does not come to life in the real world, it is worth a visit because of the importance of its collections and how well structured they are in an enjoyable and exciting tour.\n\nIn fact, it is one of the must-see museums in the city and one of the most visited, so to skip the queues at the ticket office and go directly to what interests you, it is best to get this ticket to the Museum of Natural History in New York.\n\nWhat to see at the Museum of Natural History?\n\nIt was created in 1869 for the study of the universe, the Earth, the human being and the dissemination of science thanks to the efforts of naturalist Albert S. Bickmore, so here you can see a lot of things and very interesting: from fossils and dinosaur bones, to meteorites and the origins of human beings.\n\nGiven the size of the Natural History Museum and the large number of exhibits it has, the visit can be overwhelming, especially if it is the first time. With this ticket you will have access to nearly 50 permanent and special exhibits, including the Rose Center for Earth and Space.\n\nHow to plan your visit\n\nThe Natural History Museum is made up of 28 interconnected buildings that house its popular library, research labs, and dozens of permanent exhibit halls.\n\nSome of the most famous are the Biodiversity and Environmental Halls (where a 28-meter-long blue whale specimen is on display), the Earth and Planetary Sciences Halls (where the Ahnighito meteorite that crashed in Greenland is on display) and my favorite Fossil Halls, the room that exhibits the largest collection of dinosaur fossils and features life-size reproductions.\n\nMy advice is to plan it well and at least set aside 3 hours to explore the museum at your leisure, either to discover its most relevant rooms or to go at your own pace seeing what you like the most.\n\nVisit with children\n\nIf you go to the Museum of New York History with children, I advise you to set aside some time to go to the Discovery Room, a room where kids from 5 to 12 years old can learn about nature and science by experimenting interactively with puzzles and scientific challenges accompanied by their parents. They will love it!\n\nPractical information\n\nWhere is the Museum of Natural History: It is located on 79th Street west of Central Park.\n\nHow long does it take to see it: Its collection is considered the largest on the planet with more than 35 million pieces of all kinds. If you don't have much time it is best to be selective and go directly to the rooms you want to see.\n\nHow to get there: Bus (lines M7, M10, M11, M79, M86 and M104) / Metro (81st St. Museum of Natural History Station, lines B and C).\n\nHours: Open Wednesday through Sunday from 10 AM to 5:30 PM.\n\nExtra info: You can read more details in my article about the Museum of Natural History. Museum of Natural History New York Tickets: how to buy and prices.\n\n3. MoMA\n\nIf we talk about modern and contemporary art, MoMA is the most important museum in the world and one of the essential visits to make in New York.\n\nIts popularity lies not only in the incalculable value of its collections but also in offering a complete experience suitable for all ages, so it is common to find long lines at the entrance.\n\nHowever, with this skip-the-line ticket, you will get immediate access to the MoMA Museum and its vast collection of 200,000 works signed by famous artists such as Dali, Picasso, Andy Warhol and Van Gogh among many others. You will like it so much that you won't want to leave!\n\nWhat to see at the MoMA?\n\nIt is surprising to discover that from the eight canvases and one drawing with which MoMA began in 1929, now its repertoire exceeds hundreds of thousands of pieces including paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, design, photography, film, architecture and prints, all spread over 6 floors!\n\nIf you like art as much as I do, I'm sure you won't mind wandering for hours through its facilities enjoying every detail but if you just want to make a short visit to MoMA, I advise you to focus on floors 4 and 5, which is where the worksof the most famous artists are located: such as Warhol, Pollock, Matisse or Cézanne.\n\nBut its stimulating repertoire goes beyond that. The great thing about this skip-the-line MoMA ticket is that you can also explore MoMA PS1, Long Island City's contemporary art center, for 14 days after your visit to the Manhattan venue to soak up even more art. This cultural space hosts exhibitions that address both artist retrospectives and site-specific shows.\n\nBefore you leave MoMA\n\nWhen you're done, before hitting the streets of New York, I suggest you take a break at MoMA's Sculpture Garden, an oasis in the middle of the city where you can enjoy a coffee in a very unique setting designed by Philip Johnson in the 1950s.\n\nPractical information\n\nWhere is MoMA: It is located on 53rd Street between 5th and 6th Avenue.\n\nHow long does it take to see it: It will depend on how fond you are of modern and contemporary art. For a quick visit you will have to dedicate a minimum of 90 minutes.\n\nHow to get there: Bus lines M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5 / Subway 5th Avenue - 53rd Street (E and V lines).\n\nHours: Saturday to Thursday from 10:30 AM to 17:30 PM and Fridays from 10:30 AM to 20 PM.\n\nExtra information: I tell you more details about my visit to MoMa in the article on MoMA New York Tickets: how to buy, prices and schedules.\n\n4. Whitney Museum of American Art\n\nAfter a pleasant stroll through High Line Park you cancontinue your sightseeing tour by entering the Whitney Museum, a space specializing in 20th century American art.\n\nWith this skip-the-line entrance to the Whitney Museum of American Art you will have direct access to the best of modern and contemporary American art in one place with breathtaking scenery from the museum's open-air terraces. Plus, there are free daily tours to learn all its secrets in depth.\n\nWhat to see at the Whitney Museum of American Art?\n\nThere are many interesting museums in New York, but the curious thing about this one is that it was born out of failure. Its founder, sculptor Gertrude Vandelbilt Whitney, created it in 1930 after the MET refused to exhibit its collection.\n\nToday, its collection is made up of works of art by 20th century American artists such as Jackson Pollock, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe or Andy Warhol and, what I find most interesting, by living contemporary artists who find in this museum a space to present their works in public for the first time.\n\nHow to plan a visit?\n\nThe Whitney Museum consists of several floors among which are distributed the temporary exhibitions and the permanent collection, which has 21,000 pieces created by more than 3,000 artists and the own collection of founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney according to different historical periods.\n\nThe atmosphere at the Whitney Museum is relaxed and seems designed to appeal to a young-spirited audience.\n\nIf you don't have much time to make the visit, my advice is to look for the works and artists you like the most and take the opportunity to get to know the rest of the museum from above. As interesting is its interior (with the largest column-free gallery in the city) as the outdoor terraces on floors 5, 6, 7 and 8 that serve as art galleries and viewpoints of the city at the same time.\n\nWhy I like it\n\nIn addition to its own theme, contemporary art, I love the Whitney Museum because it is not crowded like other museums and for the architecture of the building, which has a spectacular facade. And from its terraces there are wonderful views of the Hudson River, the Meatpacking District and even New Jersey and southern Manhattan.\n\nPractical information\n\nWhere is the Whitney Museum: It is located at 99 Gansevoort St, New York.\n\nHow long does it take to see it: Book at least a couple of hours, because it is a very large museum, with hundreds of permanent works spread over nine floors.\n\nHours: The Whitney Museum is open Sunday through Thursday from 10:30 AM to 6 PM; Fridays and Saturdays until 10 PM. Closed Tuesdays, Thanksgiving Day, December 25 and January 1.\n\nHow to get there: Bus lines M1, M2, M3 and M4 / Subway 77th Street (line 6).\n\n5. Madame Tussauds\n\nAre the wax figures at Madame Tussauds as spectacular as they say they are? Yes! The truth is that this New York museum has a well-deserved reputation, not only because of how much the wax sculptures resemble the people they represent, something fundamental, but also because you can interact with them in different sets and take home a souvenir album of your visit.\n\nWith this ticket to the Madame Tussauds Museum in New York, you will have full access to its more than five floors of exhibitions with all kinds of scenarios in which to take pictures with your favorite actors, musicians and athletes. For example, imagine posing on Oprah Winfrey's interview couch or in the Oval Office with the President of the United States. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?\n\nWhat to see at Madame Tussauds?\n\nThe Madame Tussauds Museum welcomes you with the Opening Night Party room set as a big party where you can mingle with different celebrities. The visit continues with other themed rooms such as the Sports Zone or Pop Culture, where you will meet athletes, musicians and other famous personalities.\n\nOne of the areas that excited me the most was the Star On Broadway exhibition, an interactive experience where you get into the role of a real Broadway star. It was hilarious to play a tune on a giant floor piano, just like in the movies! And singing at the top of your lungs one of the songs from \"Phantom of the Opera\" along with the main characters.\n\nThe Marvel 4-D Cinema Experience is also highly recommended if you like super heroes. This is a 4-D movie that incorporates 3-D movie technology with special effects that include wind, water and even smell. It's as if the movie puts you in the middle of the battle between good and evil. Truly a fantastic experience.\n\nPerfect to go with kids\n\nIf you are traveling with children or teenagers this is one of the best museums in New York to visit as a family because they will have a blast.\n\nThey will be able to tour Madame Tussauds from top to bottom, taking pictures without fear of spoiling the wax figures (after all are 'celebrities' accustomed to the flashes) and pose with E.T. or ghostbusters among many other characters.\n\nPractical information\n\nWhere is it: It is located at 232 West 42nd Street (in Times Square).\n\nHow long does it take to see it: 90 minutes will be enough to see the highlights of Madame Tussauds although it all depends on how much time you want to spend taking pictures.\n\nHours: Madame Tussauds is open Sunday through Thursday from 10 AM to 8 PM while on Fridays and Saturdays it is open from 10 AM to 10 PM.\n\nHow to get there: Bus lines M6, M7, M10 M20, M27, M42 and M104. / Subway 42nd Street & 8th Avenue (lines A, C and E), 42nd Street & 6th Avenue (lines B, D, F and V) or 42nd Street-Times Square (lines 1, 2, 3, 7, N, Q, R, W and S).\n\n6. Fotografiska New York\n\nThe Fotografiska Museum in New York: it is anything but a regular museum. On the outside the building is a marvel, but inside it never ceases to amaze because there is no permanent collection, each exhibition is unique! It is a mix of photography, art, music and nightlife.\n\nA living art space in constant change able to adapt and show the latest movements and social issues from emerging and established artists through a vibrant cultural programming.\n\nWhy I like it\n\nFotografiska New York\n\nPrecisely because it is not just another museum with the typical atmosphere of a traditional museum.\n\nThe ambient lighting of the rooms, the elegant interior design and the soothing music is a novel approach to photography that, together with a temporary collection, makes the experience totally different every time and a reason to visit Fotografiska New York on every trip to the city.\n\nPractical information\n\nWhere: Located at 281 Park Avenue South.\n\nHow long does it take to see Fotografiska New York: At least 2 hours to enjoy the atmosphere and the collection.\n\nHours: Fotografiska New York is open Wednesday through Sunday from 11AM to 9PM. Closed Mondays and Tuesdays.\n\nHow to get there: Bus M1, M2, M3.\n\n7. Spyscape Museum and Experience\n\nHave you ever imagined being a spy on a secret mission? Think you could pass a lie detector test? Then put on a hat and trench coat because at the Spyscape Museum and Experience in New York you'll be taught how to think like a spy and put the tricks of the trade into practice.\n\nWith this ticket you'll get to experience those mysterious spy stories and in an immersive environment, you'll participate in a real spy challenge to test your own skills.\n\nAt the end you will be shown your own profile to find out what kind of spy you would be: will it be 007, Mata Hari, Alan Turing or text=Joan Clarke?\n\nWhy I like it\n\nSpyscape Museum and Experience\n\nBecause it is not just another museum about espionage but a mix between a museum and an interactive experience where I had a blast.\n\nSpyscape Museum is divided into seven sections that are dedicated to different facets of espionage such as intelligence service operations, deception or cyber attacks.\n\nBefore starting the adventure, a video is shown explaining the missions to be completed and each participant receives a wristband, which is scanned in each section to load the details of the next job.\n\nFor example, in \"Deception\" you have to tell which subject is lying or telling the truth after watching various interviews while in \"Surveillance\" you can test your talent for finding suspects on security cameras. The tests are so well done that you really get into the role and the time in the museum flies by.\n\nThe best part comes at the end though, when all the tests are completed, the results are analyzed to determine what kind of spy you are and what branch of military intelligence you would be instrumental in making the mission successful.\n\nWhen you leave Spyscape Museum and Experience you will feel ready to go on any mission incognito, like a real spy.\n\nPractical Information\n\nWhere is it located: 928 8th Ave Between 54th-55th Street.\n\nHow long does it take to tour the Spyscape Museum: It will take approximately 90 minutes.\n\nIs it suitable for children: The Spyscape Museum and Experience is best for children ages 10 or 12 and up as some of the exhibits can be tricky.\n\nHow to get there: Subway 50th Street (lines C, E), 59th Street Columbus Circle (lines A, B, C, D), 57th Street (lines N, Q, R, o, W) / Bus M7, M20, M104\n\n8. New York Historical Society\n\nIf you are interested in the history of the United States, you cannot miss the New York Historical Society, where you will find a very important art collection with documents and works preserved since the colonial era.\n\nFounded in 1804, thanks to the commitment to preserve American history of its 11 promoters, this institution has a wide variety of exhibits with objects, works of art, manuscripts and documents of great historical value.\n\nThis great museum also houses a library, which preserves one of the largest history archives in the country and is one of the oldest research libraries in the United States.\n\nWhat to see at the New York Historical Society\n\nIn addition to the Patricia D. Klingenstein Library and its extensive catalog of historical documents ranging from colonial and revolutionary era to military history or about slavery in the US, this museum also has permanent and temporary exhibits. Some of them are:\n\nDiMenna Children's History Museum: for children to also learn to understand history in a fun way with educational programs for all ages.\n\nWomen's History Center: pioneer in showing the legacy of women in the history of the United States.\n\nVarious temporary exhibits covering a multitude of historical aspects, from the exhibition on the Jewish cuisine of the Holocaust refugees in the country, to the exhibition on the Salem Witch Trials.\n\nWhy I like it\n\nAmerican history is very interesting and it is worthwhile to take advantage of your visit to New York to learn more about the evolution of society in this country and better understand its people.\n\nIn addition, being such a complete museum, with a great diversity of samples, both works of art and real objects and documents preserved, your visit will be a temporary trip to the turbulent history of the United States.\n\nPractical Information\n\nWhere is it? 170 Central Park West, Richard Gilder Way (77th Street)\n\nIs it suitable for children: Yes, as it has a museum especially for the youngest visitors.\n\nHow to get there: M10, M7 and M11 bus. 81st Street Subway - Museum of Natural History Station (A, B and C lines)\n\n9. Broadway Museum\n\nYou've probably added seeing a Broadway musical to your list of things to see in New York, but if you're a fan of Broadway shows, you might also want to know what's behind the scenes of Broadway.\n\nThe Broadway Museum, opened in 2022, is a space dedicated 100% to musical theater, to tell the secrets of Broadway. It exhibits everything from costumes to objects and sets from the greatest musicals in history.\n\nIt is a journey through history from the beginnings of the famous theater until today, paying tribute to actors and directors as well as light and sound technicians. The different rooms distributed among its more than 2,400 square meters offer an interactive experience for all audiences.\n\nWhat to see at the Broadway Museum?\n\nIn addition to learning about the history and understanding how the magic of Broadway was born, through its four floors, this museum offers musical lovers a journey through the different stages of the theater since it began operating more than 200 years ago in Lower Manhattan.\n\nYou can see photographs of the old shows, sets of the works that reaped the greatest successes, such as West Side Story, or see up close the props and costumes used in the great musicals that continue to offer their functions today.\n\nBut you will also have the opportunity to see how they work behind the curtain and how the show goes on thanks to the professional technicians who work meticulously taking care of every detail so that everything is perfect every night.\n\nThe museum also has a gift store where you can buy a souvenir of Broadway, a great international brand that is today one of the main reasons why people travel to New York.\n\nWhy I like\n\nthe Broadway Museum\n\nIn an entertaining way and with immersive elements, the museum offers an overview of the history and workings of Broadway.

Brooklyn Museum\n\nDuring a visit to the borough of Brooklyn, mark in your activity plan a visit to the Brooklyn Museum, one of the largest in the country and one of the best museums in New York.\n\nIt was founded in 1895 with the idea of becoming the largest museum in the world and although it was unable to achieve its purpose, its collections of antiquities and American art are of great value and are well worth seeing if you are interested in history and art.\n\nWhy visit the Brooklyn Museum\n\nI loved the experience because with this ticket I had access to the museum's permanent collection, which includes art from all corners of the world from ancient Egypt to the present day and the free guided tour.\n\nOne of my favorite exhibits was the Spanish Colonial and Native American art although its collection of African, Pacific Islander or Islamic art also deserves a special mention because it is simply spectacular as is the American art collection with works by Edward Hopper, Norman Rockwell or Winslow Homer.\n\nAlso, with this ticket to the Brooklyn Museum, you will get 10% in the gift store, which never hurts.

Its collection brings together works of art from around the world with more than 5,000 years of history.

This admission includes all exhibitions and free public tours, which are available in 10 languages.\n\nSince the MET opened in February 1872 when Robert Lee Jenkins donated his private collection, the museum has continued to grow and attract visitors. Each year more than 6 million people visit its halls filled with treasures from ancient Egypt, ancient Greece and Rome, the Middle Ages, Islamic art, art from the Americas, Africa, Oceania and much more.\n\nIn order to bring art and art education to Americans, the MET hosts dozens of exhibitions annually as well as events and programs that include films, lectures, performances, guided tours and family activities.\n\nSpeaking of families, did you know that children under 12 get in free when accompanied by an adult?\n\nHow to plan your visit\n\nA good start is to take a look at the MET map to locate the permanent collections and rule out those areas that are not of interest to you. I know that once you are there it is difficult to do it because you will want to see as much as possible, it has happened to me but believe me, to avoid going crazy the ideal is to select the areas that catch your attention and leave the rest for another time.\n\nWhat I like most about the skip-the-line ticket to the MET valid for 3 consecutive days is that you can return to any of the museum's locations to continue the visit right where you left off the previous day. So, take it easy!\n\nAll the pieces housed at the MET are fascinating but, in my opinion, the Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Medieval art galleries are a must-see treasure trove along with the European paintings.\n\nIf you have some time left, don't forget to stop by the MET Museum's other venues: The Met Breuer (dedicated to modern and contemporary art) and The Met Cloisters (dedicated to medieval art and architecture).\n\nPractical Information\n\nWhere is the MET: It is located at 82nd Street and 5th Avenue.\n\nHow long does it take to see it: You will need a minimum of 3 hours for a short visit knowing in advance what you want to see. Ideally you should have a whole morning or afternoon to visit the museum but as this is a three-day ticket you can take your time to organize the visit as you wish.\n\nHow to get there: Bus lines M1, M2, M3 and M4 / Subway 86th Street (lines 4, 5 and 6).\n\nHours: Open Tuesday through Sunday from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM. Fridays and Saturdays open until 9:00 PM. Closed every Monday, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day.\n\n12. Guggenheim Museum\n\nDuring your tour of the Upper East Side, a must-see is the Guggenheim Museum, one of the best museums in New York.\n\nNot only for the magnificent collection of modern art that houses works by Marc Chagall, Vasily Kandinsky, Edouard Manet and Vincent van Gogh but also for its spectacular architecture. A modernist building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright that has become an icon of the twentieth century.\n\nThat is why the Guggenheim Museum does not disappoint. I assure you that you will not tire of walking its corridors, with a spiral interior design that leads visitors naturally from one space to another or as Wright himself called it an \"uninterrupted symphony\".\n\nWith these credentials, it is not surprising that it is one of the most popular museums in the city where long lines form at the doors. To save the time you can spend on your visit, with this skip-the-line ticket to the Guggenheim Museum, you'll have direct access to one of the world's finest collections of modern and contemporary art.\n\nWhat to see at the Guggenheim Museum?\n\nUpon arrival, you will be surprised by the impressive building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, his last major project before his death. The exterior is designed as a large white cylindrical structure that seems to spin like a whirlwind towards the sky.\n\nAs you walk through the entrance, the first thing you notice is a great sense of spaciousness and emptiness. On either side of it is a very long ramp that flows along six floors until it rises towards a glass dome through which natural light penetrates. This slope creates the illusion of experiencing the art on display as you ascend upward in a very natural, organic way.\n\nAmong the criticisms the building received, some people believed that its design would overshadow the artwork displayed on its walls but nothing could be further from the truth. Architecture and painting have merged into one to become an emblem of New York.\n\nAs for painting, its collection is spectacular Kandinsky, Toulouse-Lautrec, Magritte, Chagall, Picasso and Miró, among others. All this together with very interesting temporary exhibitions and a collection of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, famous for his large black and white images.\n\nWhy I like it\n\nThe fantastic thing about this ticket is that you can explore the museum with a guide for free every day at 2PM, which gives you a super complete and different view of the Guggenheim.\n\nPractical info\n\nWhere is it: 89th Street and 5th Avenue.\n\nHow long does it take to see the Guggenheim Museum: For a quick visit to enjoy the building's architecture and collection, at least a minimum of 2 hours.\n\nHours: The Guggenheim Museum is open Friday through Wednesday from 10AM to 5:45PM. Saturdays are open until 7:45PM.\n\nHow to get there: 86th Street Subway (lines 4, 5 and 6). / Bus lines M1, M2, M3 and M4.\n\n13. Museum of the City of New York\n\nIf you are going to spend several days in the Big Apple to soak up the history of the city, what life was like for New Yorkers and how it became one of the most important cities on the planet you have to go to the Museum of the City of New York, south of East Harlem.\n\nWhat to see at the Museum of New York\n\nLocated in a beautiful colonial and Georgian style building, throughout its four floors the Museum of the City of New York exhibits objects, paintings, photographs and recreations that help to compose the history of New York from its origins and its future.\n\nIn addition, with this ticket you will have access to the documentary Timescapes:, a half-hour multimedia narration that takes you on a journey through 400 years of the city's history. Totally recommended!\n\nWhy I like\n\nThe Museum of New York Along with the documentary, I loved the exhibit of antique toys and full-scale models.\n\nPractical information\n\n14. KGB Spy Museum\n\nDo you like stories of spies during the Cold War? Then you must include this one in your list of the best New York museums to visit. It is an amazing exhibit of objects used by Soviet agents in their missions against the United States to try to get their secrets.\n\nThe funny thing is that the KGB Spy Museum is the work of just one person, Julius Urbatis, a Lithuanian historian who has spent decades collecting original pieces such as iconographies of Lenin or Stalin, cameras and microphones hidden in books, rings or belts, gas masks, guns shaped like lipsticks... some objects have almost a century of history!\n\nWhy visit this museum\n\nIf you like history and spy adventures, with this ticket to the KGB Spy Museum, you will have direct and skip-the-line access to the world's largest collection of KGB items, some of them never seen before!\n\nIn addition, you will discover the secret activities, strategies and methods used in many of the most important top secret espionage operations in history.\n\nPractical information\n\nWhere: This museum is located at 245 West 14th Street.\n\nHow long does it take to see it: About 90 minutes for a quick visit is enough.\n\nHours: Open Monday through Sunday from 10AM to 8PM.\n\nOther museums in New York\n\nIf visiting museums is your thing when you travel, here are two more options to include in your Manhattan itinerary:\n\nIntrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum\n\nThis museum is for history lovers.
