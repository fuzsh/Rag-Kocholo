        "text": "It's summer in the Northland, which brings a lot of great things, but it also brings what feels like a dramatic increase in road construction projects.\n\nThis seems to be especially true in downtown Duluth, and more so in the last couple of weeks. Our studios are located downtown and it has become noticeably more difficult to get around. Regardless of the route I choose, I seem to be greeted by a closed road or a long line of traffic.\n\nThat's just the way it is for now, so why not add another road closure in the area? At least this promises to be a short-term inconvenience.\n\nSection of Third Street To Be Closed Near St. Mary’s Hospital Site\n\nAccording to the City of Duluth, contractors will close the section of Third Street between Fifth Avenue East and Fourth Avenue East on Thursday, August 8, and Friday, August 9, to install fencing at the St. Mary’s Hospital site. This closure will begin at 6:00 am on August 8.\n\nTraffic will detour around the block to the north, using Fifth Avenue East, to Fourth Street, and to Fourth Avenue East, as shown on the detour map below.\n\nSignificant traffic congestion is expected during this time and motorists should expect delays. Drivers are advised that this road is already under construction due to ongoing repaving efforts, so the City of Duluth advises everyone to take alternate routes if possible during this closure.\n\nThe road will be reopened to limited lane traffic when work is completed, which is expected to be Friday afternoon.\n\nSEE NOW: Landmark Duluth Hotel Has Surprisingly Been Listed For Sale\n\nAccess to the Essentia clinic will be open beginning at 7:00 am Thursday. Before 7:00 am there may be no access to the clinic building from Third Street. Drivers visiting the Essentia clinic are advised that the only available exit will be to Second Street, either via Fifth Street or the parking ramp."
