        "text": "AUTUMN in New York. Has there ever been a time when that phrase sounded more bittersweet? Crisp fall days have always been perfect for seeing this city, the cool snap in the air drawing you outside for a walk through Central Park or down Fifth Avenue, and museums and restaurants and theaters and clubs luring you inside to take off the slight chill, to fill your stomach and raise your spirit.\n\nIt's different now, of course. All those pleasant choices exist in another dimension, overwhelmed by feelings of sadness and unease and anger, of wanting to get on with life but wondering just how far to go in doing so. This is understandable, but at the same time we shouldn't forget that for all New York has endured recently, it has not lost the ability to satisfy a lot of urges we might just be better off giving in to. That voice inside your head, the one that keeps saying it's O.K. to let go a little and enjoy yourself? Maybe we should listen to it.\n\nAnd so I offer the following, a completely subjective, totally uncomprehensive guide to a classic fall day in New York.\n\nFor starters, I suggest a not-too-early breakfast at the Stanhope Hotel (now officially the Stanhope-Park Hyatt ), a sophisticated, well-appointed stronghold of Upper East Side urbanity that is well situated for purposes of this day's itinerary, which goes, for the most part, north to south.\n\nThe Stanhope's dining room, called the Melrose, is on the front, facing Fifth Avenue at 81st Street. Take your time there. Order something hearty, eggs and bacon, or oatmeal; you'll walk it off later. If you're sitting near the window, watch the foot traffic go by. Listen for ghosts (the legendary alto saxophonist Charlie Parker died in a suite upstairs, watching TV). Have an extra cup of coffee. And when you're done, go to a museum.\n\nYou couldn't be in a better place for it. Directly across Fifth Avenue is the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is 7 blocks north, the Cooper-Hewitt 10, the Jewish Museum 11, and the Museum of the City of New York 22. The Whitney Museum of American Art is around the corner and six blocks south on Madison Avenue. An easy walk across Central Park takes you to the American Museum of Natural History (and the Rose Planetarium) and the New-York Historical Society.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
