Don't miss the chance to see our newest exhibition Changing the Face of Democracy: Shirley Chisholm at 100 and the send off of our centennial exhibition This Is New York: 100 Years of the City in Art and Pop Culture. We have partnered with Cool Culture to deliver family-friendly activities in connection with our Chisholm exhibition in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. Be sure to stop by and grab a Kids’ Activity Guide for the little ones to explore This Is New York.\n\nThe doors to each museum will be open to the public for free throughout the event. Please check each museum’s website to learn more about their programming.\n\nFree to all, no registration required!\n\nLearn more about the History of Museum Mile\n\nEstablished in 1978 to increase public awareness of its member institutions and promote public support of the arts, the Museum Mile Festival serves as a model for similar events across the globe. The eight institutions participating in this highly successful collaboration are The Metropolitan Museum of Art; Neue Galerie New York; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum; The Jewish Museum; Museum of the City of New York; El Museo del Barrio; and The Africa Center. Several neighborhood partners, including the New York Academy of Medicine, the Church of the Heavenly Rest, Asia Society, and AKC Museum of the Dog will also join us in this celebration.\n\nMuseum of the City of New York, El Museo del Barrio, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art are members of the Cultural Institutions Group (CIG), a diverse coalition of 34 nonprofit museums, performing arts centers, historical societies, zoos, and botanical gardens in New York that share a private-public partnership with the City and reside within City-owned property."
