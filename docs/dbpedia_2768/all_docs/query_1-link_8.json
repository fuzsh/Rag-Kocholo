        "text": "It’s one of New York City’s biggest block parties that’s free, held in the evening and open to the public.\n\nThe Museum Mile Festival is marking its 46th year in 2024, and it falls on Tuesday, June 18. This annual event happens along what’s known as the “Museum Mile.” This moniker refers to a section along Fifth Avenue, on the east side of Manhattan, that is home to the city’s most prominent art and cultural museums.\n\nThis stretch runs between 82nd and 110th streets. During the festival, it’s closed off to vehicle traffic. Festival hours are from 6 to 9 p.m.\n\nThere are eight partnering museums keeping their doors open after their usual weekday hours. They are: The Metropolitan Museum of Art; Neue Galerie New York; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum; The Jewish Museum; The Africa Center; Museum of the City of New York; and El Museo del Barrio.\n\nThis popular event was started in 1978 to raise public awareness about these institutions and overall support New York City’s arts scene.\n\n“The Museum Mile Festival has been a constant [event] on the NYC social and culture calendar ever since,” said Jerry Gallagher, chief operating officer of the Museum of the City of New York. “Even during COVID, there was a virtual offering as a way to keep the tradition alive. Every year, it’s a wonderful opportunity for all of New York to come together to celebrate art and culture.”\n\nAccording to Gallagher, the festival generally happens on the second Tuesday in June. Sometimes, its date may change to accommodate holidays or conflicting events.\n\n“This year, we are excited to have the Museum Mile Festival on the eve of Juneteenth and hope that people will take advantage of the holiday to spend the night before Juneteenth with us,” said Gallagher. “It’s a great opportunity to walk up and down Fifth Avenue on a beautiful evening and appreciate some culture along the way.”\n\nAlong with offering free admission, the participating museums schedule coinciding family-friendly activities and musical performances.\n\n“It offers the chance for locals and visitors alike to explore a favorite museum – or visit one that they’ve never seen before,” said Gallagher. “You’ll likely see something new, regardless.”\n\nEach year, one of the involved museums along the Museum Mile is appointed as the festival’s host. For the 2024 edition, the hosting Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum will hold a kick-off ceremony beginning at 5:45 p.m.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art will present a wide range of all-ages programming. Their event schedule includes a chamber music performance from Sugar Hill Salon that’s inspired by the exhibit, “The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism”; drop-in gallery chats in “Hidden Faces: Covered Portraits of the Renaissance,” and storytime for all ages. A New Orleans-style jazz performance by The Jon Lampley Band, and presented by the National Jazz Museum in Harlem, will round out the evening. It happens on the museum’s outside steps.\n\nNeue Galerie New York focuses on German and Austrian art and currently is featuring the exhibits, “Paula Modersohn-Becker: Ich bin Ich / I am Me” and “Austrian Masterworks from the Neue Galerie.” During the festival, the Neue Galerie’s Visitor Policies will remain in effect and children under 12 will not be admitted. Admission will be granted on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum will feature a sustainability program presented by the museum's School, Youth and Family team and Green Team. Upcycled fabric will be turned into a banner in the shape of the Guggenheim building.\n\nThe Jewish Museum will offer a musical performance by Matt Darieu World Klezmer Kapelye, presented as part of their ongoing collaboration with Bang on a Can. A drop-in art making project is also scheduled.\n\nThe El Museo del Barrio‘s current exhibits include “Amalia Mesa-Bains: Archaeology of Memory,” the first retrospective exhibition by the pioneering artist, curator and theorist. Also, “Cuerpo: Carlos Martiel” is the first solo exhibition in an NYC museum of the inaugural recipient of the Maestro Dobel Latinx Art Prize. Register in advance here to expedite check-in.\n\nThe Africa Center has two exhibitions on view right now. “Except this time nothing returns from the ashes” consists of Asmaa Jama and Gouled Ahmed’s short film and exhibition reimagining African identity and historical memory. “I Hope This Helps” is a multi-sensory exhibition by Harlem-based artist, Samiya Bashir.\n\nExhibitions at the Museum of the City of New York include “This Is New York: 100 Years of the City in Art and Pop Culture”and “Changing the Face of Democracy: Shirley Chisholm at 100,” honoring the late Brooklyn Congresswoman.\n\nIt’s best to read up on the participating museums’ visitor policies through their websites beforehand. Visitors needing assistance should contact them directly to arrange access accommodations in advance.\n\nOther NYC art or cultural attractions will participate in the Museum Mile Festival as cultural partners.\n\nThe AKC Museum of the Dog will offer fun activities to do with your dogs, while The Asia Society will showcase a variety of family-friendly crafts and activities.\n\nThe Church of Heavenly Rest will present children’s art and music, a “Stop and Be Dazzled” public art installation and a performance by The Queer Big Apple Corps Marching Band.\n\nThe New York Academy of Medicine will help visitors decompress by coloring images and turning them into buttons. Take a picture with their skeleton, or get a glimpse at the history of public health through a showing of a few items from their collection."
