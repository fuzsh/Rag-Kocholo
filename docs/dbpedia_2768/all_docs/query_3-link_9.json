        "text": "NEW YORK'S - and quite possibly the world's - most civilized stretch of boulevard is the section of Fifth Avenue from 82d to 104th Street known as Museum Mile, which takes in no fewer than 10 of the city's prized cultural institutions. It begins with the mighty bulk of the Metropolitan Museum, where global art history is on formal parade, and ends with the humbler but feisty El Museo del Barrio, which focuses on the art of Puerto Rico and Latin America.\n\nOn Tuesday night, from 6 to 9, the treasures within these buildings -some of them architectural gems in themselves - may be sampled free (the Metropolitan Museum has a suggested admission fee) along with outdoor entertainment, in Museum Mile's fifth street festival. For those three hours, upper Fifth Avenue will become a pedestrian mall, with the festivities inaugurated at 6 P.M. by Mayor Koch and Bess Myerson, the city's Commissioner for Cultural Affairs, at El Museo del Barrio, on the avenue at 104th Street (additional information, 722-1313).\n\nBut for those who cannot wait until Tuesday or who might not be able to attend the festivities on a weekday evening, this weekend provides a good opportunity for a preview.\n\nWhat the museums have to offer is of extraordinary scope: Jewish art and history at the Jewish Museum and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research; German culture at Goethe House; photography from the 19th century to now at the International Center for Photography; 20th-century art at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Design of the past and present can be explored in depth at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum; the Big Apple - more than 300 years of it -shines at the Museum of the City of New York, and the National Academy of Design, founded in 1825 and the oldest institution of them all, presents art of today and yesterday in work by members and in lively loan shows.\n\nThis weekend, an incredibly eclectic display awaits visitors - from canes and walking sticks to the art collections of the Vatican, from the paintings of Winston Churchill to 19th-century china dolls, from an archive of underground life in the Warsaw Ghetto to postwar painting in Europe - perhaps available nowhere else in such a concentrated area.\n\nThe Met offers the work of two Englishmen separated by a century: the painter John Constable and the sculptor Henry Moore. The delicate ornaments of the Russian jeweler Faberge are on view at the Cooper-Hewitt. The 1940's are seen through the lenses of 17 leading American photographers at the International Center for Photography.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
