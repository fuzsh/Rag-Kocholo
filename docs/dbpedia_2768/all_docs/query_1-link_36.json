        "text": "MAIN Travel New York City Museum Mile Festival\n\nBilled by festival organizers as New York's biggest block party, the Museum Mile Festival in New York City is a mile-long celebration of art and culture.\n\nThe festival is held annually, usually on an evening in June on the second Tuesday of the month.\n\nStretching along Fifth Avenue between 82nd and 105th (which is roughly a mile) the streets are closed off to cars. And, for at least one special day and evening -- the whole mile becomes a stroller's heaven.\n\nThis year, the 46th annual Museum Mile Festival is scheduled for Tuesday, June 11, 2024 from 6PM - 9PM, rain or shine.\n\nAll about the Museum Mile Festival\n\nThe first Museum Mile Festival was held in 1978 with the aim of letting people experience the many museums along 5th Avenue, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Design Museum, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum -- with FREE admission to all.\n\nYet museums certainly aren't the only attraction!\n\nMany of the museums also provide art related activities for kids, and musicians and bands of various flavors can be found playing everywhere along the avenue. The festival also plays host to a variety of street performers who entertain crowds up and down the mile-long stretch.\n\n\"New York City's biggest block party\" (photo courtesy museummilefestival.org)\n\nIn total, well over a million people have participated in the Museum Mile Festival over the years. The Museum Mile Festival has such a popular reputation, in fact, that tourists from the surrounding area come to New York specifically for the event -- to enjoy New York's rich cultural heritage all for FREE and to rub shoulders with like-minded New Yorkers.\n\nHave fun!\n\nalso see in Travel ->Top 5 Attractions at the Louvre\n\nMore about the Museum Mile Festival around the Web:\n\nMuseum Mile Festival - The official site, with information on this year's festivities including the complete schedule of participating museums, map & directions, lists of performers and street entertainment, photos.\n\nMuseum Mile Festival - NY.com- A guide to the festival along with more information on participating museums.\n\nMuseum Mile Festival on Flickr - Chronicling past festivals in dozens of photo galleries.\n\nMuseums participating in the Museum Mile Festival:\n\nMuseum of the City of New York\n\n(212) 534-1672\n\nwww.mcny.org\n\nEl Museo del Barrio\n\n(212) 831-7272\n\nwww.elmuseo.org\n\nThe Jewish Museum\n\n(212) 423-3200\n\nhttps://thejewishmuseum.org/\n\nCooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution\n\n(212) 849-8400\n\nhttps://www.cooperhewitt.org/\n\nNational Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts\n\n(212) 369-4880\n\nwww.nationalacademy.org\n\nSolomon R.
