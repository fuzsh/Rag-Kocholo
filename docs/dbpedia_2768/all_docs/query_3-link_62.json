In 1929, Guggenheim and his advisor, German-born artist Hilla Rebay, began collecting his paintings, works on paper, and sculpture in depth for the Guggenheim’s growing collection of nonobjective art. His work held a special place at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting—the forerunner of the Guggenheim Museum—where a memorial exhibition was presented shortly after his untimely death in 1946.\n\nOther exhibitions on view at the Guggenheim include But a Storm is Blowing from Paradise: Contemporary Art of the Middle East and North Africa. East-African retro-pop band Alsarah and the Nubatones will perform, and museum educators will lead chalk drawing activities for families on Fifth Avenue.
