Here's what to know.\n\nUPPER EAST SIDE, NY — After going virtual for two years during the pandemic, the Museum Mile Festival will be back in grand fashion on Tuesday, with eight museums offering free art exhibitions, activities, and performances along dozens of blocks of Fifth Avenue.\n\nThe evening event will run from 6-9 p.m. Tuesday between East 79th and 110th streets. Participating institutions include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, El Museo del Barrio, Neue Galerie, the Guggenheim Museum, Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, the Jewish Museum, the Museum of the City of New York, and the Africa Center.\n\nThe doors to all eight museums will be open during the event.\n\nMeanwhile, Church of the Heavenly Rest will be hosting its popular \"Block90 on Museum Mile\" event during the same time, on East 90th Street just off Fifth Avenue, with food, art balloon figures and a marching band performance.\n\nAt the Met, festivities will include a 6 p.m. kickoff performance by Slavic Soul Party at the David H. Koch Plaza near East 80th Street, followed by puppet shows, art workshops, paper lantern construction, more music, and a chance to take a quiet tour of some museum galleries. (See the Met's full schedule here.)\n\nAt the Guggenheim, visitors can stop in to see the exhibitions Vasily Kandinsky: Around the Circle or Cecilia Vicuña: Spin Spin Triangulene, and join the outdoor activity Sketch with Jeff.\n\nUptown at El Museo, the 105th Street institution will be hosting a live musical performance by salsa musicians Jose Trombone & Conjunto Rumbon, along with DJ Taina Enikeyi.\n\nInside, the museum will welcome visitors to check out the spring opening of \"Raphael Montañez Ortiz: A Contextual Retrospective\" — the largest-ever exhibition of the artist and educator who founded El Museo.\n\nA few blocks north at the Africa Center, meanwhile, will be a performance by Congolese musician Nkumu Katalay and The Life Long Project Band, plus free admission to the show African/American: Making the Nation’s Table.\n\nTuesday will be the 44th iteration of the annual event, back in its recognizable form after going remote in 2020 and 2021.\n\nClick the following links to see the 2022 Museum Mile Festival programming at each museum:\n\nMetropolitan Museum of Art\n\nGuggenheim Museum\n\nJewish Museum\n\nMuseum of the City of New York\n\nNeue Galerie\n\nCooper Hewitt\n\nEl Museo del Barrio\n\nAfrica Center\n\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
