        "text": "*Updated July 2023*\n\nDid you know there is a rooftop bar on top of NYC‘s Metropolitan Museum of Art?\n\nI know, right? When I found out I knew I immediately needed to get to the Met rooftop garden bar. Art and cocktails, what more do you need?\n\nHow about a freaking AWESOME view of the Manhattan skyline.\n\nYa, that’s not too bad.\n\nRight about now you might be wondering, “how do I get to this rooftop bar?” I want to enjoy a poptail on the top of one of the world’s most famous museums.\n\nGuess what? You don’t have to be a celeb or pay a ton of money to get to the Met rooftop garden bar. In fact, you don’t even have to get a drink to hang out at this bar. When I went, most people weren’t drinking.\n\nOk, so let’s get to it because I know you are ready to be done reading so you can be enjoying this view already. Don’t worry, by the end of this post you will have all the details so you can enjoy your own perfect afternoon at the Met rooftop garden!\n\nMet Basics\n\nSo back up, what exactly are we talking about here?\n\nOk, the Met (a shortened name for the Metropolitan Museum of Art) is the largest art museum in the United States. This museum is the crown jewel of museum mile in New York City. You could easily spend days exploring this museum. There are so many different exhibits, including Egyptian artifacts, suits of armor, and Van Gogh paintings.\n\nBut that short description really doesn’t even begin to cover it. The Met actually has two locations: The Met Fifth Avenue (the main location) and The Met Cloisters.\n\nThe rooftop bar we are talking about is located on top of the Met Fifth Avenue building. This is the main and iconic building you are probably thinking about anyways.\n\nGeneral admission tickets to the Met cost $30 for adults. These tickets are valid for same-day admission at both Met locations. If you have a valid New York State ID or you are a student in New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut you can purchase a pay-what-you-wish ticket.\n\nTo visit the Met rooftop garden you must purchase a ticket to the museum.\n\nHours\n\nThe Met Fifth Avenue is open: Sunday-Tuesday and Thursday from 10:00 am – 5:00 pm and Friday & Saturday from 10:00 am – 9:00 pm.\n\nThe Met Rooftop Garden Bar is open seasonally on Sunday-Tuesday and Thursday from 11:00 am- 4:00 pm and Friday & Saturday from 11:00 am- 8:00 pm.\n\nCost\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, a ticket to the Met is required to visit the Met rooftop garden bar. Met tickets cost $30 for adults and $17 for students.\n\nNew York residents and students in NJ, NY, and CT and purchase a pay-what-you-wish ticket.\n\nLocation\n\nThe Met Fifth Avenue is located at 1000 5th Ave New York, New York. You can get here by taking the 4, 5, or 6 train to 86th Street and walking west towards 5th Avenue. Or, take the 1 train to 86th Street, then the M86 crosstown bus across Central Park to Fifth Avenue. Another option is to take the C train to 81st Street, then the M79 bus across Central Park to Fifth Avenue.\n\nOnce inside the museum, it can be a little confusing to find the rooftop bar. This museum is large and might be overwhelming. Of course, you should spend some time exploring the museum. But when you are ready to get to the rooftop, take the elevator from the European Sculpture and Decorative Arts Gallery 555 to the 5th floor.\n\nGood to Know\n\nYou don’t have to purchase a drink to spend time on the rooftop. There is a bar, but there aren’t any tables. Most people were on the rooftop to enjoy the view. So, don’t feel like you will be out of place if you just want to go for the view and not pay $18 for a drink.\n\nMet Rooftop Garden Bar\n\nThe Met Fifth Avenue Bar is the perfect place to enjoy a summer happy hour. The bar’s official name is the Cantor Rooftop Garden Bar. This large space also often features contemporary art sculptures. You will find a bar, benches, and plenty of space to soak in the views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline.\n\nThere is no charge to visit the bar. You can simply go to enjoy the view. But, if you are here for a drink, you have some fantastic options. Here’s the most current menu:\n\nWhen I visited, I couldn’t pass up the Instagram-worthy poptails. These drinks are basically a glass of prosecco with a popsicle. The menu has changed a bit since I first visited but don’t worry, you can still get a Boozy Pop if you want!\n\nThe menu also includes a selection of specialty mocktails, beer, and wine. For an extra charge, you can turn the mocktails into cocktails. Cheers!\n\nWhat to Expect\n\nWhen you visit the bar, it will probably be slightly crowded (this is NYC after all). But the whole area was bigger than I expected. You shouldn’t have trouble getting a picture with the skyline, you just might need to be patient.\n\nEach summer the Met puts on a Roof Garden Commission. While you’re here, check out this year’s installation.\n\nDrinks are expensive (I’m talking $18 cocktails here) but of course you are paying a premium for the view and experience.\n\nHonestly, I felt like a celebrity hanging out on this rooftop. It’s not somewhere I would recommend as a go-to bar, but you should check it out at least once. And it is a great place to bring visitors.\n\nWhat Else Can You Do at the Met?\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the Met rooftop garden bar is amazing. And you should spend some time there. But you paid a good amount to be at the museum, so you should also check out the exhibits.\n\nBut don’t let yourself get overwhelmed. The Met is the largest art museum in the country. It holds more than 2 million pieces. You won’t see everything, so don’t force yourself to rush through the museum. Check out the website or map to decide the exhibits you are most interested in. Or, just wander for a while and let yourself get a bit lost. There are so many interesting exhibits to discover.\n\nDon’t miss:\n\nTemple of Dendur– This ancient Egyptian temple was given to the United States by the Egyptian government in an effort to preserve the ruins.\n\nWashington Crossing the Deleware– Leutze’s iconic painting that most Americans grew up seeing in our history textbooks.\n\nThe Arms and Armor Exhibit – It’s not every day that you get to see a suit of armor and the Met has over 1,000 pieces on display in this exhibit.\n\nNearby Attractions\n\nThe Met Fifth Avenue is located on Museum Mile, so there are a few other museums nearby to check out:\n\nSolomon R. Guggenheim Museum– Art museum housed in the iconic Frank Lloyd Wright building.\n\nCooper Hewit Smithsonian Design Museum– Design museum dedicated to historical and modern aesthetics.\n\nMuseum of the City of New York– This museum focuses on all things NYC and it’s quickly become one of my favorites. There’s a great permanent exhibit on the history of the city but the museum has ever-changing exhibits focused on different NYC-related topics.\n\nIf the Met was enough of a museum for you, I get it. There are some other great attractions nearby:\n\nCentral Park- The Met rooftop garden overlooks Central Park. Spend some time relaxing in the grass, riding a bike, admiring the Alice in Wonderland Statue, or following a self-guided walking tour.\n\nThe Plaza Hotel- If you want to take a walk through Central Park, you can easily reach the iconic Plaza Hotel. This is just over a mile from the Met, but the impressive building is worth the walk. You will also find an upscale food hall in the Plaza if you are hungry.\n\nSo, who is ready to visit the Met rooftop garden?
