        "text": "Museum Mile is the name for a section of Fifth Avenue running from 82nd to 110th streets on the Upper East Side, in an area sometimes called Upper Carnegie Hill. The Mile, which contains one of the densest displays of culture in the world, is actually three blocks longer than one mile (1.6 km). Nine museums occupy the length of this section of Fifth Avenue. A ninth museum, the Museum for African Art, joined the ensemble in 2009; its museum at 110th Street, the first new museum constructed on the Mile since the Guggenheim in 1959, opened in late 2012.\n\nIn addition to other programming, the museums collaborate for the annual Museum Mile Festival to promote the museums and increase visitation. The Museum Mile Festival traditionally takes place here on the second Tuesday in June from 6 – 9 p.m. It was established in 1979 to increase public awareness of its member institutions and promote public support of the arts in New York City.\n\nMuseums on the mile include:\n\n1. 110th Street – The Africa Center\n\n2. 105th Street – El Museo del Barrio\n\n3. 103rd Street – Museum of the City of New York\n\n4. 92nd Street – The Jewish Museum\n\n5. 91st Street – Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum (part of the Smithsonian Institution)\n\n6. 89th Street – National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts\n\n7. 88th Street – Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum\n\n8. 86th Street – Neue Galerie New York\n\n9. 82nd Street – The Metropolitan Museum of Art"
