But in 1978 some clever curators came up with the moniker Museum Mile for the stretch of Fifth Avenue from 105th Street to 82nd Street that houses no fewer than nine world-class museums, most with shops and cafés.\n\nhttp://www.ny.com/museums/frick.collection.html\n\nThe Frick Collection\n\nThe Frick mansion was designed by Carrere and Hastings, the same architects who worked on the New York Public Library, and was built to “make Carnegie’s place look like a miner’s shack.” Preserved on Millionaire’s Row, the mansion is a grand setting for an incredible collection of European painting and decorative arts. The enclosed inner courtyard is a perfect place for weary art lovers to take a rest.\n\n1 E. 70th St. (btw Madison & 5th Ave)\n\nwww.frick.org\n\nAhhhh…the Met!\n\nLook at this cute couple resting?….They found just the place to take 5 (and maybe a little people watching while they’re at it?) ? Looks easy enough except in reality you walk until your legs won’t take you another step only to realize there is no relief in site…one more step, one more block, one more place…..\n\nhttp://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art?projectId=art-project\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, located in New York City, is the largest art museum in the United States, and one of the ten largest in the world, with the most significant art collections.[6] Its permanent collection contains more than two million works, divided among seventeen curatorial departments.[7] The main building, located on the eastern edge of Central Park along Manhattan’s Museum Mile, is by area one of the world’s largest art galleries. There is also a much smaller second location at “The Cloisters” in Upper Manhattan that featuresmedieval art.[8]\n\n82nd & Fifth: A web series\n\n6,464 views 8 months ago"
