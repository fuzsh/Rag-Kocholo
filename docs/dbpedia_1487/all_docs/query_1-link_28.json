Pollack's Notes On ... —\n\nMarkus Heuger's Beabliography —\n\nZeezender Discografie —\n\nA list of all 212 Beatles' songs and covers officially released on record between 1962 and 1970 by Ger Tillekens The official Beatles' canon covers all songs the Beatles recorded and authorized for publication in their years as a performing group. In those years between 1962 and 1970 the Beatles released 219 songs or song variants, which are listed below in order of appearance. In this list there are 24 covers (C), and 1 traditional (T), leaving us with up to 194 released recordings of original Beatles' songs. Among those 194 we find 9 song variations and 1 song fragment. Of those 10 performances most authors of Beatles' books and commentaries discard 7 tracks as just variants or invalid members of the Beatles' songbook, leaving us with exactly 187 canonical Beatles' originals, 24 covers and 1 traditional: a total of 212 songs. [1] The links on this page all point towards Alan W. Pollack's Notes on ... Series.

This \"ditty\" was written and sung by Paul McCartney at the recording sessions of \"I Will\" on 16th September 1968 as take 19 of this song. The full song lasts 2'21 minutes and is not copyrighted. Most Beatles' commentaries exclude it from their lists. Having listened to the take several times, I'm inclined to do the opposite."
