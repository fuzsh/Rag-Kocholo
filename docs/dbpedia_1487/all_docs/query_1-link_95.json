She sang in 4 languages & released over 30 studio albums. She first retired in 2012 after being diagnosed with cancer but 5 years later (2018) she released an album.

Tragically, Bofill suffered a stroke in 2006 which paralyzed her left side & then suffered a second stroke in 2007 impairing her speech & mobility.

The band had some other interesting Ingle songs (“New Day,” “Filled With Fear,” “Soul Experience” & “In the Time of Our Lives”). But their momentum, like the hard rock band Blue Cheer, petered out.
