        "text": "The Strangeloves's song \"I Want Candy\" is a playful tune about the desire for something sweet, using candy as a metaphor for a desirable girl. The first verse sets the stage for the song's subject matter - a girl who is soft and sweet, has everything the singer desires, and sets the summer sun on fire. The chorus then repeats the desire for candy, with the \"Hey\" interjections adding to the high-energy and playful nature of the song. In the second verse, the singer mentions seeing Candy with her hair hung down, emphasizing her beauty and the singer's admiration for her. The chorus repeats again, but this time, the singer adds a line about candy being what the doctor ordered, adding another layer of metaphor for a desired, yet ultimately unhealthy, indulgence. The last verse ties together the song's themes, with the singer expressing a desire to have Candy all the time, and using both literal and metaphorical descriptions of candy to emphasize his desire for the girl."
