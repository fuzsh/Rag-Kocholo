        "text": "Here on The Beatles Channel (Ch. 18), we ain’t got nothing but love for our listeners. That’s why we’ve created a show where your votes determine the playlist.\n\nEach week, listeners can vote for their favorites from a list of songs by John, Paul, George, and Ringo — sometimes by the band, sometimes it’s their solo work. Every Friday, after the votes are tallied, we’ll air the top eight vote-getters from that list.\n\nThis week we count down your favorite Beatles songs released in the US in 1965.\n\nDirections: Select 5 songs from the list below. You may vote once between 8/18/2021 at 2pm ET and 9/10/2021 at 2pm ET.\n\nCan’t see the poll? Click here to vote!"
