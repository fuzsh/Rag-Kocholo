This process safeguards that the remote pilot complies with current FAA rules, provisions, and guidance by taking a responsible, risk-based approach to ensure the safety of the thousands of “non-participants” within the dynamic “open-air assembly” nature of the Fair event. Law enforcement will respond to all unauthorized UAS to identify the pilot and document the aircraft in use. The State Fair of Texas prohibits the use of all remote controlled devices of any type, including, but not limited to, aircraft, drones, quad-copters, cars or trucks, on or above property owned, leased or controlled by the Fair.
