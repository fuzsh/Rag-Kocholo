        "text": "The Beatles\n\ntimelines of their recordings and career\n\nRecordings, releases and key events in order\n\nRecording and chronology notes\n\nThe table layout\n\nThe tracks and releases\n\nPete Best\n\nBigger Than Jesus\n\nSongs in recording session order\n\nPolydor Germany recordings\n\nDecca audition recordings\n\nEMI Parlophone recordings\n\nBeatles timelines\n\nThis is an outline of The Beatles’ writing and recording career, relating studio sessions, original UK releases and other events.\n\nThere are 2 main lists on this page:\n\nAn overall chronology of major releases and events\n\nA complete sequential list of recording sessions and songs\n\nThis isn’t a complete discography or an exhaustive account of every repackaged and rereleased track. I don’t cover every out-take and post-Beatles recording on this page.\n\nThese Beatles records and films were produced in less than 8 years, alongside:\n\n4 years relentless touring around the world up to 1966;\n\nregular television and radio work, recordings and appearances;\n\nLennon/McCartney songs written for other artists;\n\nsolo instrumental compositions by Paul;\n\nGeorge’s solo electronic compositions;\n\nRingo’s solo records and acting work;\n\nJohn’s books and drawings, and records and films with Yoko.\n\nIt’s an impressive legacy, and that’s only the highlights. Here are the main titles in the order they were originally recorded and released.\n\nRecordings, releases and key events in order\n\nFew Beatles singles were album tracks and you can’t easily tell if they were also on EPs or LPs. All the tracks are now available on various CDs, but not in the order they were originally made and issued. This table shows the albums and singles in chronological order, with recording and UK release dates (EPs that duplicated other releases are omitted). It also shows which singles were on albums and some key events for context. There are additional footnotes about certain tracks and events.\n\nAlbum Start End Release Single Start End Release title date date date name date date date 1957 Paul met John and The Quarry Men 6 July (Woolton Parish Church Garden Fête) and joined that month 1958 George joined The Quarry Men in February or March ‘In Spite Of All The Danger’ recording John, Paul, George (Colin Hanton, drums and John Lowe, piano) 1959 Local gigs and talent shows as The Quarry Men and Johnny and the Moondogs 1960 May: Alan Williams (manager) arranged Scottish tour (Tommy Moore, drums) with Larry Parnes’ Johnny Gentle Pete Best joined 12 August for Hamburg bookings and The Silver Beatles became The Beatles Hamburg (1)—August to November (inc. first John, Paul, George and Ringo recordings, with Wally) November: George, Paul and Pete Best deported from Germany (and Stu Sutcliffe quit) 1961 Hamburg (2)—April to June (inc. recording with Tony Sheridan) Brian Epstein became manager 10 December 1962 Decca London recording audition 1 January (15 songs selected by Brian) Hamburg (3)—April to May EMI Abbey Road recording audition 6 June Love Me Do PPM\n\nP.S.

After Stu Sutcliffe, Pete Best is the most well-known. His two year stint began when they renamed themselves simply “The Beatles” and he was crucial for their live Hamburg and UK work. It is tragic that he was replaced on the eve of their breakthrough. There are conspiracy theories but it seems fairly straightforward, especially since the Pete Best version of Love Me Do was released on Anthology 1.\n\nBrian Epstein and George Martin agree it was George Martin’s decision to replace Pete after the EMI recording test in June 1962. Pete’s rhythmic variations on Love Me Do are weaker than Ringo’s interpretation (copied by session drummer Andy White for the original release). George Martin wanted the debut single to be tight. A mono mix was made from one of Ringo’s 15 takes but a week later Andy White played on a further 18 takes before Martin was satisfied. It seems unlikely Pete could have drummed on the single George Martin wanted. He had to go.\n\nIn simple terms, the band previously rejected by EMI and Decca was also rejected by George Martin.\n\nBigger Than Jesus\n\nThe generally accepted version of the “Bigger Than Jesus” story is that Americans, particularly in the Deep South, were outraged by John’s supposedly blasphemous remark. The offending quote was first published in a Maureen Cleave series for the Evening Standard on 4 March 1966. Apparently it went unnoticed in the USA until it was picked up by Datebook (a teenage pop magazine) for their issue published on 29 July, presumably to cash in on The Beatles’ American tour in August. What interests me is that Paulâs quote, which appears before Johnâs on the cover, seems more inflammatory but it is hardly ever mentioned.\n\nOf course, The Beatles knew black American musicians well and were inspired by their music, and they knew how they had been treated. Also, The Beatles insisted on playing to unsegregated audiences, so they were well aware of the situation in the South. It seems likely to me that it was Paulâs comment and The Beatlesâ position on segregation that caused more anger in Alabama and Texas but Johnâs comment was more convenient as an excuse. A blatantly racist anti-Beatles campaign would not go down well in New York or California where contrived Christian indignation might. If so, it worked and The Beatles never played there again.\n\nSongs in recording session order\n\nPolydor Germany recordings\n\nThe Beatles’ first recording contract was backing Tony Sheridan as The Beat Brothers. Sheridan was signed separately to Bert Kaempfert’s production company in Germany. This was a one year deal for 4 tracks to be released on Polydor. Two of these tracks (Cry For A Shadow and Ain’t She Sweet) featured The Beatles. The My Bonnie single was released in October 1961 and featured two of the 9 tracks recorded. The other tracks weren’t used immediately.\n\nYear Song Single Writers 1961 Polydor single session — 22 to 23 June 1961 My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean A side cover When The Saints Go Marching In B side cover Nobody’s Child cover Why (Can’t You Love Me Again) cover Cry For A Shadow Harrison/Lennon Polydor second session — 24 June 1961 (If You Love Me Baby) Take Out Some Insurance On Me cover Ain’t She Sweet cover 1962 Polydor final session — 24 May 1962 Sweet Georgia Brown cover Swanee River cover\n\nDecca audition recordings\n\nThese are the songs chosen by Brian Epstein and recorded at The Beatles’ unsuccessful Decca audition (1 January 1962) in the order they were played. It was this recording (rejected by Decca) that eventually led to their recording deal with EMI. On 8 February 1962 Brian took his Decca audition tape to HMV (EMI) in Oxford Street to have some 78 rpm acetates made (to demo the band in future meetings). Jim Foy, engineer at HMV, recommended the McCartney/Lennon compositions to Syd Coleman head of Ardmore and Beechwood, EMI’s music publisher at the time. Coleman’s office was upstairs at HMV. After meeting Epstein (8 May 1962) and hearing the acetate Syd Coleman recommended the band to George Martin for Parlophone. Epstein and Martin met the next day at Abbey Road and the audition was arranged for 6 June 1962.\n\nYear Song Writers 1962 Decca audition — 1 January 1962 Like Dreamers Do McCartney/Lennon Money cover ‘Till There Was You cover The Sheik Of Araby cover To Know Her Is To Love Her cover Take Good Care Of My Baby cover Memphis, Tennessee cover Sure To Fall cover Hello Little Girl McCartney/Lennon Three Cool Cats cover Crying, Waiting, Hoping cover Love Of The Loved McCartney/Lennon September In The Rain cover Besame Mucho cover Searchin’ cover\n\nEMI Parlophone recordings\n\nThis is a complete list of all The Beatles’ EMI songs showing how they were originally released in the UK, and the order they were recorded. They are sub-divided broadly into album sessions and The Beatles compositions are numbered (these numbers are the same as the sections in Revolution In The Head). Note that, contrary to popular myth, the Please Please Me album wasn’t recorded in a single day. However, most of the album was recorded on 11 February 1963 in two remarkable sessions.\n\nYear/\n\nNo. Song Album\n\nTrack?
