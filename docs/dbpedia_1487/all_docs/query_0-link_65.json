They performed four hits plus an a cappella tribute to the radio station.

Murphy, p. 135:\n\nIn 1990 Brian recalled, “Back in 1961, I’d never written a song in my life. I was nineteen years old. And I put myself to the test in my car one day. I was driving to a hot dog stand and I created a melody in my head without being able to hear it on a piano. I sang it to myself. I didn’t even sing it out loud in the car. When I got home that day, I finished the song, wrote the bridge, put the harmonies together and called it ‘Surfer Girl’.”\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nThe band first recorded the song at World Pacific Studios on February 8, 1962 which was one of the band’s first ever recording sessions. However, the recordings from that session, engineered by Hite Morgan, would ultimately remain unreleased until later archival releases. “Surfer Girl” is played in 12/8 time.\n\nThe instrumental track as well as the vocals for the officially released version were recorded on June 12, 1963 at Western Recorders, located at 6000 Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.[6] The session was produced by Brian; the first song, along with “Little Deuce Coupe”, to be credited as a Brian production. The musicians on the track are David Marks and Carl Wilson on guitar; Brian Wilson on bass guitar and Dennis Wilson on drums. The finished instrumental track can be heard on the 1968 release Stack-O-Tracks. The song is sung by the group – Mike Love, Carl, Marks and Dennis Wilson – with lead vocal by Brian. Also recorded during that session was “Little Deuce Coupe”\n\nThe Beach Boys — Take 1 demo recorded on 8 February 1962 at World Pacific Studios; released on the 2016 compilation album Becoming the Beach Boys: The Complete Hite & Dorinda Morgan Sessions, Omnivore Recordings OVLP-195 (LP), and OVCD-186 (CD)\n\n.\n\nLonely Sea (Brian Wilson, Gary Usher) — recorded 13 June 1962 (outtake, Surfin’ Safari sessions); included on the album Surfin’ USA, released 25 March 1963\n\n.\n\nSurfin’ Safari (Brian Wilson, Mike Love) — Capitol 4777, b/w 409 was the second Beach Boys single, and their first for Capitol.

Also recorded at the same demo session were 409, Lonely Sea, and Their Hearts Were Full of Spring.\n\nReleased on 4 June 1962, the single became their first hit, peaking at #14. It was also the first and title track of their debut album, released 1 October 1962.\n\nMike Love — lead vocal\n\nBrian, Carl, & Dennis Wilson, Mike Love — back vocals\n\nCarl Wilson — guitar\n\nDavid Marks — guitar\n\nBrian Wilson — bass\n\nDennis Wilson — drums\n\n___________________\n\n.\n\n1963\n\nLP: Surfer Girl — released 16 September 1963\n\nSurfer Girl (Brian Wilson) — recorded on 12 June 1963; issued 22 July 1963 on the single Capitol 5009, b/w “Little Deuce Coupe” — See above for info on the song’s origins and on the original February 8, 1962 “demo” recordings, followed by take 1 from one of the 1962 recordings.\n\n.\n\n______________\n\nLittle Deuce Coupe (Brian Wilson, Roger Christian) — first issued 22 July 1963 as the B-side of the single “Surfer Girl” (Capitol 5009).
