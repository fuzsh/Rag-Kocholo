        "text": "The formal register is just one of the registers we use daily. So, what are the other kinds of registers?\n\nThere are six main types of language register:\n\nCasual register\n\nIntimate register\n\nFrozen register\n\nConsultative register\n\nNeutral register\n\nFormal register\n\nTo begin, let's look at the meaning of 'formal register'.\n\nFormal Register Definition\n\nAs the 'Do-Re-Mi' song from The Sound of Music1 states, 'the beginning is a very good place to start', so let's start with a definition!\n\nFirst of all, what exactly is a register?\n\nRegister, in linguistics, refers to a variety or type of language used for a particular purpose in a particular type of communicative interaction.\n\nWhat, then, is the formal register?\n\nFormal is an adjective that refers to anything that is important or official, or carried out in a manner that follows convention.\n\nThis means that the formal register refers to the variety of language used in important, official, or ceremonial situations where proceedings are dictated by particular etiquette or rules.\n\nFormal Register in Communication\n\nNow that we have the definition of 'formal register' under our belts, let's take a closer look at the characteristics of the formal register that we can identify in communication.\n\nFormal register characteristics\n\ngenerally somewhat impersonal and unemotional\n\nuses complete sentences, complex or longer sentence structures, and standard grammar\n\nmost commonly uses Standard English (e.g., standard British English or standard varieties of other languages, depending on the country, e.g. Standard French)\n\nmakes use of extended or complex vocabulary\n\nlimited use of personal pronouns\n\navoids using pet names and terms of endearment\n\navoids contractions and abbreviations\n\navoids idioms and metaphorical language\n\ngenerally avoids imperative sentences\n\navoids colloquialisms, slang words, swearing, and vulgarities\n\nused in formal, official, or ceremonial situations, or situations that follow conventions of some kind\n\nColloquialisms - informal and non-standard parts of speech usually used in spoken, not written, language.\n\nHow do you know when to use the formal register?\n\nAudience\n\nIf you're struggling to know when to use the formal register, your audience is one of your most helpful hints! For example, if you're having a chat, or even a more serious discussion, with a friend or close family member, it is unlikely that you'll need to use the formal register.\n\nWhen we talk to people we know well, are close to, and feel comfortable around, we seldom need to use the formal register. Even when having important discussions or debates, it's more likely that we will use some informal language and language features rather than carefully constructing complex sentences and making sure our language is impersonal and standard.\n\nOn the other hand, when we speak to authority figures, employers, teachers, and other professionals, the formal register might feel more natural than more casual speech. Using the formal register in conversation with authority figures and professionals shows respect and will likely match the manner in which they are speaking to you.\n\nPlace\n\nOftentimes, the place in which a situation occurs will have a significant impact on the situation itself. There are some places where the formal register is not only appropriate, but expected. For example, in court, both lawyers and witnesses are expected to use formal and factual language. It is not appropriate for people to swear or use unnecessary colloquialisms.\n\nThere are many places and situations where the formal register is used as standard. Some other examples could include:\n\noffices and corporate spaces\n\nbusiness meetings and presentations\n\nacademic lectures and presentations\n\nhospitals\n\nPurpose\n\nThe reason behind the communicative interaction is a very important factor in determining what register to use.\n\nIf the purpose of the conversation or communication is simply to share information or catch up with a loved one or friend, then the formal register is not needed. Asking small favours of people, whether you know them well or not, does not generally require the formal register. For example, when asking a stranger on a train if they have the time, it is not necessary for you to use complicated sentences or even standard English; you could quite easily do this in the casual register.\n\nIf the purpose of the communication is to discuss a serious or official matter, ask for guidance or clarification on something, or to complain about something formally. In that case, the formal register might be more appropriate. Business-related communications, legal and accounting procedures, and academic situations also commonly call for the formal register.\n\nFormal Register Use\n\nNow that we've covered the main features of the formal register, and the factors that determine when it should be used, let's look at some examples of these situations:\n\nWhen teachers, lecturers, and other kinds of academic speakers deliver lessons and educational material, it's likely they will use the formal register (at least to a degree). This is because the formal register is clear and complete, using full sentences and grammar, as well as extended vocabulary. These characteristics make the formal register a good medium for teaching.\n\nAdditionally, when speaking to a teacher, lecturer, or academic professional, the student might also use the formal register. Because these academic professionals are authority figures in their particular fields, using the formal register to communicate with them shows respect.\n\nIn most kinds of job, the formal register is appropriate when an employee addresses their boss. If you had an issue you wanted to discuss, or required clarification on a work-related matter, you might send an email to your employer (or manager/supervisor etc) and it would make sense to use the formal register.\n\nWhen politicians and other authority figures in society make public addresses or speeches, they will most likely use the formal register. They will use full sentences, avoid slang and colloquialisms, and often follow certain conventions depending on the type of ceremony, speech, or broadcast.\n\nThe Queen's annual Christmas Address is an example of a public figure/ authority figure using the formal register to communicate to an audience. Here is an excerpt from her 2021 Christmas Speech:2\n\nAnd February, just six weeks from now, will see the start of my Platinum Jubilee year, which, I hope, will be an opportunity for people everywhere to enjoy a sense of togetherness; a chance to give thanks for the enormous changes of the last seventy years – social, scientific and cultural – and also to look ahead with confidence.\n\nQueen Elizabeth, 2021\n\nIn this passage, we see complex and full sentence structures, and the sentences are carefully constructed. There are no contractions, colloquialisms, or vulgarities, and although the content of the speech is festive and inspiring, the language used is not overly emotional. These are all characteristics of the formal register.\n\nSome other examples of when the formal register might be used include:\n\nwhen writing letters of complaint\n\nwhen writing letters of recommendation/ references\n\nwhen sending emails or memos in a corporate or professional environment\n\nduring court proceedings and other legal procedures\n\nduring wedding ceremonies and vow renewal ceremonies\n\nCan you think of any situations where you might have used the formal register? See how many examples you can think of. If you can't personally think of any examples, try thinking up some other potential scenarios where the formal register might be necessary or appropriate.\n\nFormal Register Conversation Example\n\nNo matter what the English Language topic, examples can help to consolidate our understanding. On that note, here are some examples of the formal register in verbal communication:\n\nOfficiant: 'Welcome everyone. We are gathered here today to witness the joining of John Smith and Sally Jones in holy matrimony. If anyone knows any reason why these two people should not be legally wed, please speak now.'\n\n...\n\nOfficiant: 'Very well. We will now continue with the vows. John, repeat after me \"I, John Smith, take you, Sally Jones, to be my wife.\"\n\nJohn Smith: 'I, John Smith, take you, Sally Jones, to be my wife.'\n\n(and so it goes on!)\n\nWedding ceremonies are a prime example of the formal register being used in verbal communication for several reasons. Firstly, the language used by both the officiant and the couple getting married is generally formal in nature, avoiding colloquialisms, contractions, and abbreviations. Secondly, wedding ceremonies are exactly that: ceremonies. They therefore follow specific conventions, which is another common characteristic of the formal register. Standard English (or a standard version of another language) and complete sentences are also used, rather than more casual language varieties and short sentences.\n\nAnother example:\n\nCustomer: 'Good afternoon, would it be possible to speak to the hotel manager, please?'\n\nReceptionist: 'Good afternoon, Sir. Of course. I am going to put you on hold for just one moment, is that alright with you?'\n\nCustomer: 'Yes, that's fine.'\n\nReceptionist: 'Ok great. The next voice you hear will be the manager. Thank you for your patience, and have a good day.'\n\nIn this example, the formal register is shown in how both participants use formal greetings such as 'Good afternoon', and 'have a good day', as well as the receptionist using the formal title 'Sir' to refer to the customer. Both participants are polite without being overly personal, and standard grammar and language choices are used throughout the exchange. Neither participant uses slang, colloquialisms, idioms, or contractions during the conversation either.\n\nFormal Register in Writing\n\nNow let's look at some examples of the formal register in writing:\n\nEmails to one's boss or teacher are often written in the formal register:\n\n'Dear Mr. James,\n\nI have attached a draft of the contract for the Burley Manor account for your consideration. I have yet to send a copy to the client, pending your final approval. If all appears to be in order, please send me a confirmation email and I will forward the document to the client for review.\n\nI would also like to arrange a time to meet with you in person to discuss another account. If you could let me know your availability at your earliest convenience, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nSusan Hart\n\nLegal Department\n\nIn this email example, we see that Susan has used the formal greetings of 'Dear Mr. James' and 'Kind Regards', and has kept the tone of the email professional and direct throughout. There is no overly descriptive language, no metaphorical references, and no slang. The sentences have been carefully constructed, and she has used Standard English and grammar too. There is no mention of personal matters, and Susan does not use any language that suggests she has a familiar or casual relationship with Mr. James. Business-related correspondence is often carried out using the formal register.\n\nAcademic essays are also typically written using the formal register:\n\nMental Illness in Modern Literature, and the Limitations of Medical Discourse\n\nMental health is an issue that is widely addressed in literature, and particularly in modern literature. Writers have handled mental health in a variety of forms including the short story (The Yellow Wallpaper), the novel (The Bell Jar), poetry (The Wasteland), plays (Edward Albee, Samuel Beckett), and auto/biography (Prozac Nation). This essay will explore these forms, the methods that writers use to portray mental illness effectively, and the ways in which medical discourse often fails to account for 'the self' when making diagnoses.\n\n...\n\nIn this opening paragraph to an academic essay, we see that informal language is avoided, as are idiomatic language, contractions, and abbreviations. The sentences use standard grammar and have a range of lengths and compositions, showing that they have been purposefully constructed. The writing style is impersonal, and the vocabulary choices stick closely to the topic being discussed. Casual language, non-standard grammar, and overly descriptive passages would not be appropriate in most forms of academic essays.\n\nFormal Register - Key Takeaways\n\nThe formal register is one of six types of language register: formal, casual, frozen, intimate, consultative, and neutral.\n\nThe formal register is used in formal, professional, or ceremonial situations and can be used in written and verbal communication.\n\nThe formal register is often associated with business, academic, and professional communications.\n\nThings that should be avoided when using the formal register include colloquialisms, slang, swearing, idioms, contractions, and personal pronouns.\n\nThe formal register often includes full and complex sentences, Standard English, and standard grammar.\n\nReferences\n\nR.
