It was also nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys, marking The Beatles’ first Grammy nomination in that category.\n\nHelp! was the second film to star The Beatles. It had the band trying to protect drummer Ringo Starr, who’s the target of a sinister cult and mad scientists trying to obtain a sacrificial ring he received as a gift from a fan.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.
