        "text": "2.2. Cancer of the lung\n\n2.2.1. Occupational exposure\n\nSigns that cancer of the lung could be induced by exposure to asbestos was first raised by reports of lung cancer cases that occurred among workers with asbestosis (Gloyne, 1935; Lynch & Smith, 1935). The first cohort study that demonstrated an excess of lung cancer among asbestos exposed workers was a study of textile workers (Doll, 1955). In this study, 11 cases of lung cancer versus 0.8 expected (P < 0.00001) were reported based on national mortality rates. Since 1955, an association between lung cancer and occupational exposure to asbestos has been demonstrated in numerous cohort and case–control studies that are summarized in Table 2.1 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100C/100C-06-Table2.1.pdf, Table 2.2 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100C/100C-06-Table2.2.pdf, and Table 2.3 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100C/100C-06-Table2.3.pdf.\n\nAlthough a causal association between asbestos exposure and lung cancer is generally well recognized, there are still substantial controversies on how the risk might vary by exposure to different fibre types and sizes, and whether there is a risk at low levels of exposure (i.e. environmental exposures). Particularly controversial is the question of whether chrysotile asbestos is less potent for the induction of lung cancer than the amphibole forms of asbestos (e.g. crocidolite, amosite and tremolite), which has sometimes been referred to as the “amphibole hypothesis” (Cullen, 1996; Stayner et al., 1996; McDonald, 1998). This argument is based on the observation from experimental studies that chrysotile asbestos is less biopersistent (i.e. has a shorter half life) in the lung than the amphiboles. Pathological studies of tissue using electron microscopy and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) have been used to measure the amounts of different asbestos fibre types in the lung. Case studies of Canadian chrysotile asbestos workers using these methods have shown an unexpectedly high proportion of amphibole (primarily tremolite) fibres, considering the relatively low percentage of amphibole fibres in commercial chrysotile asbestos (Pooley, 1976; Rowlands et al., 1982; Addison & Davies, 1990). [The Working Group noted that the lower biopersistence of chrysotile in the lung does not necessarily imply that it would be less potent than amphiboles for lung cancer.]\n\nSeveral meta-analyses have been conducted in which the relative potency of different fibre types and other fibre characteristics have been considered in relation to lung cancer. Lash et al. (1997) conducted a meta-analysis based on the findings from 15 cohort studies with quantitative information on the relationship between asbestos exposure and lung cancer risk. The slopes of the lung cancer exposure–response relationship from these studies were analysed using fixed and random effects models. Substantial heterogeneity in the slopes for lung cancer from these studies was found in their analysis. The heterogeneity was largely explained by industry category, dose measurements, tobacco habits, and standardization procedures. There was no evidence in this meta-analysis that differences in fibre type explained the heterogeneity of the slope.\n\nHodgson & Darnton (2000) performed a meta-analysis based on 17 cohort studies with information on the average level of asbestos exposure for the cohort as a whole or for subgroups in the study. The percentage excess lung cancer risk from each study or subgroup was divided by its average exposure level to derive a slope (RL) for the analysis. Substantial heterogeneity in the findings for lung cancer was also found in this analysis particularly for the chrysotile cohorts. The heterogeneity in the findings for the chrysotile cohorts was largely attributable to differences in the findings from the studies of chrysotile miners and millers in Quebec (McDonald et al., 1983), and asbestos textile workers in South Carolina (Dement & Brown, 1994; Hein et al., 2007), which differed by nearly 100-fold. No explanation has been found for these extreme differences although several possible explanations have been investigated. Co-exposure to mineral oils in the South Carolina textile plant was proposed as a possible explanation. A nested case–control conducted with the South Carolina cohort failed to provide evidence to support the hypothesis that mineral exposure was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in this study population (Dement & Brown, 1994). Differences in fibre size distributions have also been considered to be a potential explanation. The asbestos textile industry workers may have used a higher grade of asbestos resulting in exposures to a greater percentage of long fibres than what was experienced by miners and millers in Quebec. A larger percentage of long fibres was found in a recent reanalysis of samples from the South Carolina cohort using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Dement et al., 2008) than what was previously reported in TEM analyses of samples from the Quebec mines and mills (Gibbs & Hwang, 1975, 1980). Based on their analysis, Hodgson & Darnton (2000) concluded that the ratio between lung cancer risk for chrysotile and the amphiboles was somewhere between 1:10 and 1:50. However, in their analyses (where they excluded the study of Quebec miners rather than the South Carolina cohort), there was only a 2-fold difference in findings for lung cancer risk between the chrysotile (RL = 2.3) and amphibole cohorts (RL = 4.2). [The Working Group noted that there is no justification for exclusion of the South Carolina cohort because it is one of the highest quality studies in terms of the exposure information used in this study.]\n\nBerman & Crump (2008a) published a meta-analysis that included data from 15 asbestos cohort studies. Lung cancer risk potency factors (Kis = [RR-1]/cumulative exposure) were derived in their analyses that were specific for both fibre type (chrysotile versus amphiboles) and fibre size (length and width). Fibre size information was only available for one of the cohort studies, and for the other studies it was obtained from studies that were conducted in similar industrial settings. As with the previous analyses, substantial variation was found in the findings from these studies with results for lung cancer varying by two orders of magnitude, although no formal statistical tests of heterogeneity were performed. The hypothesis that chrysotile is equipotent as the amphiboles for lung cancer was not rejected for fibres of all widths (P = 0.07) or for thick (width > 0.2 µm) fibres (P = 0.16). For thin fibres (width < 0.2 µm), there was significant (P = 0.002) evidence that chrysotile fibres were less potent than amphiboles. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted in which the South Carolina or Quebec miners and millers cohorts were dropped from the analysis using fibres of all widths. Dropping the South Carolina cohort resulted in a highly significant (P = 0.005) result that potency was greater for amphiboles than for chrysotile. Dropping the Quebec cohort resulted in there being no significant (P = 0.55) evidence of a difference in potency between the fibre types. [The Working Group noted that both the Hodgson & Darnton and Berman & Crump analyses reveal a large degree of heterogeneity in the study findings for lung cancer, and that findings are highly sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of the studies from South Carolina or Quebec. The reasons for the heterogeneity are unknown, and until they are explained it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions concerning the relative potency of chrysotile and amphibole asbestos fibres from these analyses.]\n\nBased on findings from experimental studies, it is suspected that long and thin fibres are likely to be more potent than short and thick fibres in the induction of lung cancer in humans. Unfortunately until recently, all of the epidemiological studies that have been conducted used methods for exposure assessment that did not include a determination of fibre size, and thus this issue could not be directly addressed with these studies. As described above, the meta-analysis conducted by Berman & Crump (2008a) considered the effect of fibre size on lung cancer risk by using data from other studies conducted in similar circumstances as the cohort studies. Their analysis did not reveal strong evidence that lung cancer potency was dependent on fibre size. There was weak evidence that long fibres (length > 10 μm) were more potent than short fibres (5 μm < length < 10 μm) in models using all widths (P = 0.07). The lack of size-specific data from the studies was a major limitation of this study with regard to estimating size-specific risk estimates. Stayner et al. (2008) published findings from an analysis of the South Carolina asbestos textile cohort in which fibre size specific estimates of lung cancer mortality was evaluated using information from a reanalysis of archived air samples using TEM (Dement et al., 2008). Long fibres (> 10 μm) and thin fibres (< 0.25 μm) were found to be the strongest predictors of lung cancer mortality in this study.\n\nAnother study not part of the prior meta-analyses provides relevant information regarding the question of the relative lung cancer potency of the fibre types. Loomis et al. (2009) carried out a retrospective cohort mortality study of textile workers from four plants in North Carolina that had never been studied before. Workers in this cohort were primarily exposed to chrysotile asbestos that was imported from Quebec. A small amount of amosite was used in an operation in one of the plants. Overall, an excess of lung cancer was observed in this study (SMR, 1.96; 95%CI: 1.73–2.20), which was very similar in magnitude to that reported in the South Carolina cohort study of textile workers (Hein et al., 2007). However, the slope for the exposure–response between asbestos exposure and lung cancer was considerably lower than that reported in the South Carolina cohort study. The reasons for these differences in the exposure–response relationships are unknown, but one possible reason may be that quality of the exposure information was superior in the South Carolina study, and that the difference could be explained by an attenuation of the slope due to exposure misclassification in Loomis et al. (2009).\n\n2.2.2. Environmental exposures\n\nEvidence of an association in women between lung cancer and environmental exposures in New Caledonia to field dust containing tremolite and the use of a whitewash (“po”) containing tremolite has been reported (Luce et al., 2000). A positive association with heavy residential exposure to asbestos was observed in a lung cancer case–control study the Northern Province of South Africa, which is a crocidolite and amosite mining area (Mzileni et al., 1999). The association was strongest among women who resided in heavily exposed areas (odds ratio [OR], 5.4; 95%CI: 1.3–22.5; Ptrend = 0.02). A study of lung cancer mortality among women in two chrysotile mining regions of Quebec did not result in an increase in lung cancer (SMR, 0.99; 95%CI: 0.78–1.25) relative to women from 60 other areas of Canada (Camus et al., 1998).\n\n2.2.3. Non-commercial asbestiform amphibole fibres\n\nThere is emerging epidemiological evidence that non-commercial amphibole fibres that are asbestiform have carcinogenic potential. These fibres are not technically “asbestos,” and they were never commercially marketed. However, the Working Group felt it was important to discuss the recent evidence concerning these fibres because of their similarity to asbestos, and because of public concerns regarding this issue.\n\nSeveral studies have described adverse health associations with the amphibole fibres that contaminated vermiculite mined in Libby, Montana, USA. These fibres were originally characterized as from the tremolite-actinolite series (IARC, 1987a), however, they have been more recently described by the US Geological Society as approximately 84% winchite, 11% richterite, and 6% tremolite (Meeker et al., 2003). Sullivan (2007) reported standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), using cause of death data and expected mortality for the underlying cause of death based on national age-, race-, and sex-specific rates. Using a 15-year exposure lag, there were increased SMRs for all cancer (SMR, 1.4; 95%CI: 1.2–1.6; n = 202), and lung cancer (SMR, 1.7; 95%CI: 1.4–2.1; n = 89). Increasing risks were observed across categories of cumulative exposure; the SMR estimates were 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, and 1.9 in the 1–4.49, 4.5–22.9, 23.0–99.0, and ≥ 100 f/mL–years exposure categories, respectively. Results from other studies (Amandus et al., 1987; McDonald et al., 2004) of analyses using a continuous measure of exposure also resulted in statistically significant relationships with lung cancer mortality risk. For example, in the updated analysis by McDonald et al. (2004), the estimated linear increase in relative risk of respiratory cancer risk per 100 f/mL–years cumulative exposure was 0.36 (95%CI: 0.03–1.2; P = 0.02).\n\n2.3. Mesothelioma\n\nPleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas are very rare malignancies that occur in the mesothelial cells that line these cavities. The first report of a possible association between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma was by Wagner et al. (1960) who described an outbreak of mesothelioma in a crocidolite mining region of South Africa. The majority of the cases reported had worked in the mines (23/33) but some of the cases had also occurred among individuals with no history of occupational exposures (10/33). Since then, an excess of mesothelioma has been observed in a large number of cohort and case–control studies (summarized in online Tables 2.2, 2.3 and Table 2.4 available at http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100C/100C-06-Table2.4.pdf) in a variety of different industries using and producing asbestos. Although the causal association between mesothelioma and asbestos has been well established, several important issues remain to be resolved that are discussed below.\n\n2.3.1. Fibre type\n\nAlthough all forms of asbestos can cause mesothelioma, there is considerable evidence that the potency for the induction of mesothelioma varies by fibre type, and in particular that chrysotile asbestos is less potent than amphibole forms of asbestos. An excess of mesothelioma has been reported in cohort studies of chrysotile exposed miners and millers in Quebec (Liddell et al., 1997), and in South Carolina asbestos textile workers who were predominantly exposed to chrysotile asbestos imported from Quebec (Hein et al., 2007). However, the fact that the chrysotile asbestos mined in Quebec is contaminated with a small percentage (< 1.0%) of amphibole (tremolite) asbestos has complicated the interpretation of these findings. McDonald et al. (1997) found in a nested case–control study for mesothelioma in the Thetford mines of Quebec that an association with asbestos exposure was evident in mines from a region with higher concentrations of tremolite, and not in another region with lower concentrations of tremolite. Bégin et al. (1992) noted that although tremolite levels may be 7.5 times higher in Thetford than in Asbestos, the incidence of mesothelioma in these two Quebec mining towns was proportional to the size of their workforce. This suggests that the tremolitic content of the ores may not be a determinant of mesothelioma risk in Quebec. Separate analyses for workers at the Thetford and Asbestos mines and mills did not demonstrate a different exposure–response relationship for asbestos and mesothelioma in the two mining areas (McDonald & McDonald, 1995).\n\nIn a mesothelioma case–control study in South Africa, an association was reported with exposures to crocidolite and amosite asbestos, but no cases were found to have been exclusively exposed to chrysotile asbestos (Rees et al., 1999). One possible explanation for these negative findings for chrysotile is that South African chrysotile asbestos may contain relatively little tremolite (Rees et al., 1992). Another possible explanation is that chrysotile mining began later, and production levels were lower than in the crocidolite and amosite mines of South Africa. Cases of mesothelioma have been reported among asbestos miners in Zimbabwe, which has been reported to be uncontaminated with tremolite asbestos (Cullen & Baloyi, 1991). Excess mesothelioma mortality (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 4.0, 95%CI: 1.5–8.7) was reported in miners and millers from a chrysotile mine in Balangero, Italy (Mirabelli et al., 2008), reportedly free of amphibole contamination (Piolatto et al., 1990).\n\nAn evaluation of the relative potency of the different fibre types of asbestos has been considered in the meta-analyses that were previously described (see prior section on lung cancer) by Hodgson & Darnton (2000) and Berman & Crump (2008a, b). Hodgson & Darnton (2000) used the percentage of mesothelioma deaths of all deaths expected (at an age of first exposure of 30) per unit of cumulative exposure (Rm) as the measure for their analysis. They computed separate estimates of Rm for crocidolite, amosite and chrysotile asbestos. Based on their analyses, they estimated that the ratio of the potency for mesothelioma (pleural and peritoneal combined) was 1:100:500 for chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite respectively.\n\nThe meta-analysis conducted by Berman & Crump (2008a) was based on the analysis of the slopes (Km) that were estimated using an approach that assumes that the mortality rate from mesothelioma increases linearly with the intensity of exposure, and for a given intensity, increases indefinitely after exposure ceases, approximately as the square of time since first exposure (lagged 10 years). This model was tested with the raw data from several studies, and found to provide a good fit to the data (Berman & Crump, 2008b). Regression models were fitted to the study Km values that included information from surrogate studies to estimate fibre type (chrysotile versus amphiboles) and fibre length (short versus long) specific potency slopes (Berman & Crump, 2008a). Alternative models were fitted with exposure metrics based on different fibre widths. The hypothesis that chrysotile and amphibole forms of asbestos are equipotent was strongly rejected, and the hypothesis that potency for chrysotile asbestos was 0 could not be rejected based on their models (P < 0.001 and P = 0.29, respectively, for all-widths model). The best estimates for the relative potency of chrysotile ranged from zero to about 1/200th that of amphibole asbestos (depending on the width of the exposure metric used in the model). [The Working Group noted that there is a high degree of uncertainty concerning the accuracy of the relative potency estimates derived from the Hodgson & Darnton and Berman & Crump analyses because of the severe potential for exposure misclassification in these studies.]\n\nTwo newer studies, not part of the prior meta-analyses, provide important information regarding the question of the relative potency of the fibre types. The first is a study of a cohort of textile workers in North Carolina not previously examined (Loomis et al., 2009). Workers in this cohort were primarily exposed to chrysotile asbestos imported from Quebec. A relatively large excess of both mesothelioma [SMR, 10.92; 95%CI: 2.98–27.96] and pleural cancer [SMR, 12.43; 95%CI: 3.39–31.83]. The pleural and mesothelioma deaths combined comprised 0.3% of all deaths. This percentage was nearly identical to the estimate developed for the chrysotile cohorts in a review article by Stayner et al. (1996). Based on the approach that Hodgson & Darnton used in their meta-analysis, the authors estimated that the percentage of deaths per unit of fibre exposure was 0.0058% per f–y/mL (0.0098% per f–y/mL for workers followed ≥ 20 years). This estimate was considerably higher than the estimate developed by Hodgson & Darnton of 0.0010% per f–yr/mL for cohorts exposed to chrysotile.\n\nThe other study investigated mesothelioma among chrysotile miners and millers, and resident communities in Balangero, Italy. The chrysotile mined at Balangero was reported to be free of tremolite and other amphiboles. The ore contains trace amounts of another fibre called blangeroite, which is not an amphibole (Turci et al., 2009). A previous cohort of the miners and millers in Balangero with follow up to 1987 identified only two deaths from mesothelioma (Piolatto et al., 1990). Cases of mesothelioma were identified from a local mesothelioma registry comprises people who had been mine employees; employees of subcontractors or other firms transporting or refining Balangero asbestos, asbestos ore; residents of the area who were exposed from air pollution, living with a mine employee or from mine tailings from Balangero. Six cases of mesothelioma were identified among blue-collar miners, and an estimated 1.5 deaths (SIR, 4.00; 95%CI: 1.47–8.71) would be expected based on a previous cohort study (Piolatto et al., 1990), and conservative assumptions about the cohort. Additional cases of mesothelioma were identified among white-collar miners (three cases), workers in the mine hired by subcontractors (five cases), and from non-occupational exposures or exposure to re-used tailings (ten cases). Expected numbers of mesothelioma cases could not be derived for these groups because they were not part of the original cohort definition. The findings from this investigation indicate that the previous risk of mesothelioma for the Balangero cohort were seriously underestimated.\n\n2.3.2. Fibre size\n\nBased on a review of toxicological and human studies, Lippmann (1990) suggested that fibres shorter than 0.1 µm and longer than 5 µm are related to mesothelioma in humans. The Berman & Crump meta-analyses provided weak evidence that fibre length is a determinant of the potency of asbestos. The test of the hypothesis that long fibres (length ≥ 10 µm) and short fibres (5 < length < 10 µm) are equipotent was nearly rejected in some models (e.g. P = 0.09 for all widths). Thus, their findings provide weak support that long fibres may be more potent than short fibres for mesothelioma. There was little evidence in their analyses that thin fibres (width < 0.4 or < 0.2 µm) were stronger predictors of mesothelioma potency than all fibre widths combined. A major limitation of their analysis was that it relied on surrogate data to estimate the fibre-size distributions for the studies used in the meta-analysis.\n\n2.3.3. Pleural versus peritoneal tumours\n\nThe ratio of pleural to peritoneal mesotheliomas has varied considerably in different epidemiological studies of asbestos-exposed cohorts. In the cohort studies included in the meta-analysis conducted by Hodgson & Darnton (2000), the percentage of mesotheliomas that were peritoneal varied from 0 to over 50%. Hodgson & Darnton reported that peritoneal mesotheliomas increased with the square of cumulative exposure to asbestos (i.e. a supralinear relationship); whereas pleural mesotheliomas increased less than linearly with cumulative exposure to asbestos. This implies that the number of peritoneal mesotheliomas would dramatically increase relative to the number of pleural mesotheliomas at high asbestos exposure levels. Welch et al. (2005) found a strong association (OR, 5.0; 95%CI: 1.2–21.5) between asbestos exposure and peritoneal cancer in a population-based case–control study. This study included a large percentage of men with what were judged to be low exposures to asbestos.\n\n2.3.4. Environmental exposures\n\nAn excess of mesothelioma has been observed in several studies of communities with environmental exposure to asbestos. A large excess of mesothelioma was reported in a study of people living in villages in Turkey exposed to erionite used to whitewash their homes (Baris et al., 1987). An excess in mesothelioma was reported among people living near crocidolite mining regions in South Africa and Western Australia (Wagner & Pooley, 1986), among people residing in areas of tremolite contamination in Cyprus (McConnochie et al., 1987) and New Caledonia (Luce et al., 2000), and with non-occupational exposures in Europe (Magnani et al., 2000), Italy (Magnani et al., 2001), and California (Pan et al., 2005).\n\nMesothelioma has also been reported to occur among household members of families of asbestos workers (Anderson et al., 1976; Ferrante et al., 2007).\n\n2.3.5. Non-commercial asbestiform fibres\n\nSeveral studies have described adverse health associations with the amphibole fibres that contaminated vermiculite mined in Libby, Montana, USA. These fibres were originally characterized as from the tremolite-actinolite series (IARC, 1987a); however, they were subsequently described by the US Geological Society as being composed of approximately 84% winchite, 11% richterite, and 6% tremolite (Meeker et al., 2003). Sullivan (2007) reported SMRs, using cause of death data and expected mortality for the underlying cause of death based on national age-, race-, and sex-specific rates. Using a 15-year exposure lag, there were increased SMRs, mesothelioma defined by ICD-10 for deaths after 1999 (SMR, 14.1; 95%CI: 1.8–54.4; n = 2) and pleural cancer (SMR, 23.3; 95%CI: 6.3–59.5; n = 4). The only exposure–response modelling of mesothelioma was presented in the paper by McDonald et al., based on 12 mesothelioma cases (McDonald et al., 2004). Using Poisson regression, the mesothelioma mortality rate across increasing categories of exposure was compared with the rate in the lowest exposure category. For the cumulative exposure metric, the relative risk estimates were 1.0 (referent), 3.72, 3.42, and 3.68, based on 1, 4, 3, and 4, cases, respectively. The mean exposure level in these four quartiles was 8.6, 16.7, 53.2, and 393.8 f/mL–yr, respectively. It should be noted that the referent group was also at excess risk of dying from mesothelioma, i.e. there were 1–3 cases of mesothelioma observed in the referent group, which may have attenuated the observed effects.\n\nA high incidence of mesothelioma was reported among residents of Biancavilla, Italy, a city in eastern Sicily (SMR, 7.21; 95%CI: 3.59–13.00). Reviewing of the work histories of the cases did not indicate an occupational explanation for these exposures, and thus environmental explanations for the mesothelioma excess were sought. Environmental studies have indicated that these mesotheliomas are most likely due to exposures to fluoro-edenite which is a newly recognized fibre that is very similar in morphology and composition to the tremolite-actinolite series (Comba et al., 2003; Bruno et al., 2006; Putzu et al., 2006).\n\n2.5. Synthesis\n\nThe Working Group noted that a causal association between exposure to asbestos and cancer of the larynx was clearly established, based on the fairly consistent findings of both the occupational cohort studies as well as the case-controlcase–control studies, plus the evidence for positive exposure–response relationships between cumulative asbestos exposure and laryngeal cancercancer of the larynx reported in several of the well-conducted cohort studies. This conclusion was further supported by the meta-analyses of 29 cohort studies encompassing 35 populations and of 15 case-controlcase–control studies of asbestos exposure and laryngeal cancercancer of the larynx undertaken by the IOM (2006). However, there is insufficient information in the published literature to discern whether any differences exist among asbestos fibre types in their ability to cause laryngeal cancercancer of the larynx.\n\nThe Working Group noted that a causal association between exposure to asbestos and cancer of the ovary was clearly established, based on five strongly positive cohort mortality studies of women with heavy occupational exposure to asbestos (Acheson et al., 1982; Wignall & Fox, 1982; Germani et al., 1999; Berry et al., 2000; Magnani et al., 2008). The conclusion received additional support from studies showing that women and girls with environmental, but not occupational exposure to asbestos (Ferrante et al., 2007; Reid et al., 2008, 2009) had positive, though non-significant, increases in both ovarian cancer incidence and mortality.\n\nThe Working Group carefully considered the possibility that cases of peritoneal mesothelioma may have been misdiagnosed as ovarian cancer, and that these contributed to observed excesses. Contravening that possibility is the finding that three of the studies cited here specifically examined the possibility that there were misdiagnosed cases of peritoneal mesothelioma, and all failed to find sufficient numbers of misclassified cases. The Working Group noted that the possibility of diagnostic misclassification had probably diminished in recent years because of the development of new immunohistochemical diagnostic techniques.\n\nThe conclusion of the Working Group received modest support from the findings of non-significant associations between asbestos exposure and ovarian cancer in two case–control studies (Vasama-Neuvonen et al., 1999; Langseth & Kjærheim, 2004).\n\nAnd lastly, the finding is consistent with laboratory studies documenting that asbestos can accumulate in the ovaries of women with household exposure to asbestos (Heller et al., 1996) or with occupational exposure to asbestos (Langseth et al., 2007).\n\nThe study by Heller et al. (1996) was a histopathological study of ovaries from 13 women who had household contact with men who had documented exposure to asbestos, and of 17 women who gave no history of potential for asbestos exposure. The study found “significant asbestos fibre burdens” in the ovaries of nine (60.2%) of the exposed women and in only six (35%) of the unexposed women. Three of the exposed women had asbestos fibre counts in ovarian tissue of over 1 million fibres per gram (wet weight). By contrast, only one of the 17 women without household exposure had counts in that range.\n\nThe study by Langseth et al. (2007) found approximately 3–4 × 105 asbestos fibres per gram (net weight) in normal ovarian tissue taken from 2/46 patients with ovarian adenocarcinoma. It is unclear how many of these fibres were verified as asbestos because it is stated in the publication that three chrysotile and one crocidolite asbestos fibres were identified in Case 1, and two anthophyllite and one chrysotile fibre were identified in Case 2. This small number of confirmed asbestos fibres in only two of the patients could be due to sample contamination. Technical caveats associated with quantification of asbestos fibre tissue burdens are discussed in Section 4 of this Monograph and in IOM (2006).\n\nFurther discussion of the biological plausibility of an association between asbestos exposure and ovarian cancer is to be found in Section 4 of this Monograph.\n\nThe Working Group noted a positive association between exposure to abestos and cancer of the pharynx, based on the fairly consistent positive findings in a series of well conducted cohort studies of populations occupationally exposed to asbestos (Selikoff & Seidman, 1991; Sluis-Cremer et al., 1992; Reid et al., 2004; Pira et al., 2005) as well as on the positive findings of three case–control studies (Zheng et al., 1992; Marchand et al., 2000; Berrino et al., 2003). This conclusion was further supported by the findings of the meta-analysis conducted by the IOM. While tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption are clearly the dominant risk factors for cancer of the pharynx in industrialized countries, these associations between cancer of the pharynx and asbestos remained evident in several studies when tobacco and alcohol exposures were considered. The Working Group observed that the strongest associations between asbestos exposure and cancer of the pharynx were seen in studies that specifically examined cancer of the hypopharynx, the portion of the pharynx that is located closest to the larynx. However, there is insufficient information in the published literature to discern whether there are any differences among asbestos fibre types in their ability to cause cancer of the pharynx.\n\nThe Working Group noted a positive association between exposure to abestos and cancer of the stomach, based on the positive associations between asbestos exposure and death from stomach cancer observed in several of the cohort studies with heaviest asbestos exposure (Selikoff et al., 1964; Enterline et al., 1987; Raffn et al., 1989; Liddell et al., 1997; Musk et al., 2008). The conclusion was further supported by the positive dose–response relationships observed between cumulative asbestos exposure and stomach cancer mortality in several cohort studies (Selikoff & Hammond., 1979; Zhang & Wang, 1984; Liddell et al., 1997; Pang et al., 1997). It was supported by the results of two large and well performed meta-analyses (Frumkin & Berlin, 1988; Gamble, 2008). It received borderline support from the IOM meta-analysis of cohort studies, and also from the IOM meta-analysis of case–control studies, which show an especially strong relationship when only extreme exposures are considered. It was supported by the comparison developed by the Working Group between standardized incidence ratios for lung cancer and stomach cancer.\n\nPositive associations between asbestos exposure and stomach cancer and positive dose–response relationships are most likely to be seen in studies of populations with prolonged heavy exposure to asbestos that had long-term follow-up, and that incorporated high-quality assessments of exposure. The less detailed assessments of exposure found in many of the published studies would have tended to bias study results towards the null, and thus impede recognition of an association between asbestos exposure and stomach cancer, even if such an association were truly present.\n\n[The Working Group noted that heavy occupational exposure to dust, as had likely occurred in the case of the Quebec asbestos cohort, could have been an effect modifier. Low socioeconomic status is also a potential confounder.]\n\nHowever, there was insufficient information in the published literature to discern whether any differences exist among asbestos fibre types in their ability to cause stomach cancer. In the study by Liddell et al. (1997) exposure was to virtually pure chrysotile asbestos, in the study by Musk et al. (2008) the exposure was predominantly to crocidolite, and in most of the other published studies that observed positive associations, populations were exposed to mixtures of different asbestos fibres.\n\nThe Working Group noted a positive association between exposure to abestos and cancer of the colorectum, based on the fairly consistent findings of the occupational cohort studies, plus the evidence for positive exposure–response relationships between cumulative asbestos exposure and cancer of the colorectum consistently reported in the more detailed cohort studies (McDonald et al., 1980; Albin et al., 1990; Berry et al., 2000; Aliyu et al., 2005). The conclusion was further supported by the results of four large and well performed meta-analyses (Frumkin & Berlin 1988; Homa et al., 1994; IOM, 2006; Gamble, 2008).\n\nPositive exposure–response relationships between asbestos exposure and cancer of the colorectum appear most likely to be seen in studies of populations with prolonged heavy exposure to asbestos that had long-term follow-up, and that incorporated high-quality assessments of exposure. The less detailed assessments of exposure found in many of the published studies would have tended to bias study results towards the null, and thus impede recognition of an association between asbestos exposure and cancer of the colorectum, even if such an association were truly present.\n\nThe apparently non-positive findings of several the case–control studies are not a deterrent to this conclusion. The majority of these case–control studies incorporated relatively little information on levels of asbestos exposure; indeed, most of them considered exposure as simply a dichotomous yes/no variable. Some of the case–control studies also may be compromised by inadequate duration of follow-up. Thus, the Garabrant study (Garabrant et al., 1992) may be subject to the criticism, offered by Gerhardsson de Verdier et al. (1992) that “the highest duration of exposure…was ‘at least 15 years,’ a period that may be too short to detect an elevated risk.”\n\nThere is some suggestion in the literature that the association between asbestos might be stronger for colon cancer than for rectal cancer. This view is supported by the meta-analysis of Gamble (2008) which found a positive dose–response relationship for cancer of the colorectum taken together, but not for rectal cancer. It is supported also by the study of Jakobsson et al. (1994), which found excess of cancer of the right colon in asbestos-exposed workers, but not of the left colon.\n\nHowever, there was insufficient information in the published literature to discern whether any differences exist among asbestos fibre types in their ability to cause cancer of the colorectum. It is of note in the study by McDonald et al. (1980) that exposure was to virtually pure chrysotile asbestos, whereas in most of the other studies cited above, populations were exposed to mixtures of different asbestos fibres.\n\n3.1. Introduction\n\nAsbestos is a collective name for six different types of fibres: chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite, actinolite (see Section 1). Dusts from various deposits of the same type of asbestos can cause variations in the severity of the effects observed. Erionite is a fibrous zeolite found in Central Anatolia (Turkey), and Oregon (USA) (see Section 1 of the Monograph on Erionite). Talc is a hydrated magnesium silicate, and talc ore may contain several other minerals including anthophyllite, tremolite, calcite, dolomite, magnesite, antigorite, quartz, pyrophyllite micas, or chlorites (see Section 1).\n\nThe definition of pathogenic fibre properties as “sufficiently long, thin, and durable” is the subject of much debate, as are the differences between the exposure–response relationships or retained dose–response relationships of asbestos fibres in man and in rats, and the potential differences in the carcinogenicity of chrysotile compared to the various amphibole asbestos types. One of the reasons for a potential difference is a difference in the biopersistence between the two asbestos groups mentioned. The biopersistence is higher in the amphibole group (Hesterberg et al., 1996, 1998a, b). The rat is the main test model for fibre-induced diseases. As the removal of asbestos fibres due to biosolubility is slow compared to the lifetime of rats and hamsters, experiments with this model may not be appropriate in predicting results of risk in humans (Berry, 1999).\n\nCritical fibre dimensions to be used in toxicology and occupational regulations were discussed by the Working Group. It is generally agreed that the carcinogenic potency of a fibre increases with fibre length. Apart from the ongoing scientific view, standards of regulated fibres, with few exceptions, are based on the WHO fibre definition: aspect ratio ≥ 3: 1, length ≥ 5 µm, diameter ≤ 3 µm.\n\nThe tested materials (asbestos and erionite) are not presented in separate tables as in many cases they were tested in parallel experiments. The reason to split the inhalation studies into two tables (Table 3.1; Table 3.2) is that in many studies, various asbestos fibres were used as positive control in studies in which man-made fibres were tested (Table 3.2). In these latter studies, normally only one asbestos concentration was used. As for intrapleural and intraperitoneal studies, Table 3.4 is separate from Table 3.5 because the studies of Stanton et al. (1981) (see Table 3.5) included many fibre types – which also included fibres not to be reviewed here – and was designed to investigate the effect of fibre length and fibre type on mesothelioma induction.\n\nA general evaluation on the type of fibre application in animal studies and an evaluation of some of the asbestos studies listed in Tables 3.1–3.5 can be found in Pott (1993) and IARC (2002).\n\n3.2. Inhalation exposure\n\nand Table give an overview of the numerous inhalation experiments on asbestos, and a few experiments on erionite. Some of these are described more extensively below.\n\nTable 3.1\n\nStudies of cancer in experimental animals exposed to various asbestos species and erionite (inhalation exposure)a.\n\nTable 3.2\n\nStudies of cancer in experimental animals in which asbestos was used as positive control group (in inhalation studies of various man-made mineral fibres).\n\nBronchial carcinomas and pleural mesotheliomas have been observed in rats after exposure to chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, and tremolite fibres. In these studies, there was no consistent increase in tumour incidence at other sites. [The Working Group noted that in many studies, no complete histopathology was done.] All relatively short UICC asbestos preparations showed chronic effects in lung (based on fibre lenghts > 5 μm in the dust chamber) for fibres quantitatively roughly the same.\n\nOne of the first inhalation study with asbestos in rats that showed exposure–response relationships is the experiment of Wagner et al. (1974). Wistar rats were exposed to 10–15 mg/m3 of one of the five UICC standard asbestos samples for 7 hours per day, mostly 5 days per week. The duration of exposure lasted from one day to 24 months. According to the reported data, in the group exposed to crocidolite for one day, lung tumours and one mesothelioma were found in 7/43 rats (16%). The corresponding exposure to chrysotile A (from Canada) resulted in lung tumours in 5/45 rats; for amosite 4/45 rats developed lung tumours and one mesothelioma. Three months of exposure to the five UICC standard asbestos samples resulted in the following thoracic tumour (mainly of the lung) incidences: chrysotile A, 44%;chrysotile B (from Zimbabwe), 53%; crocidolite, 42%; amosite, 27%; anthophyllite, 16%. Further results are listed in . In the 126 control rats, seven animals were also found to have lung tumours ( ). This high spontaneous lung tumour rate is a unique finding in Wistar rats. A review of unexposed control groups of many other studies shows that spontaneous lung tumours are very rare in this rat strain (Pott et al., 1995; ); on average, the incidence is less than one percent. Therefore, the very high tumour incidences described in this first inhalation study of Wagner et al. (1974) might be a misinterpretation of histopathological lesions because of a lack of experience at that time.\n\nTable 3.3\n\nNegative controls (clean air for lifetime) in carcinogenicity studies after inhalation exposures from Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 .\n\nIn a study conducted by Davis et al. (1978), five groups of Wistar rats were exposed to chrysotile (2.0, 10 mg/m3), crocidolite (5.0, 10 mg/m3), or amosite (10 mg/m3). The highest tumour incidences (21–38%) were found in the chrysotile-exposed animals. This may be due to the relatively high fraction of fibres longer than 20 µm in the chrysotile dust used in this experiment. In addition to the lung tumours, extrapulmonary neoplasms included a relatively large number of peritoneal connective tissue tumours.\n\nIn a further study by Davis et al. (1986b), inhalation of short-fibred amosite did not produce tumours in Wistar rats (0/42). In contrast, there was a tumour incidence of 13/40 (33%) in a group exposed to long-fibred amosite. [The Working Group noted that extensive milling to produce short fibres may have altered the surface reactivity, see Section 4].\n\nA group of 48 SPF Fischer rats was exposed to 10 mg/m3 UICC chrysotile B by inhalation for 7 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 12 months (Wagner et al., 1984b). This group served as positive controls in a study in which various man-made fibres were tested. After exposure, the animals were kept until natural death. Twelve thoracic tumours (one adenoma, 11 adenocarcinomas) were observed in 48 rats. In the untreated control group, no lung tumours were observed in 48 rats.\n\nSmith et al. (1987) exposed groups of 58 female Osborne-Mendel rats to 7 mg/m3 UICC crocidolite asbestos for 6 hours per day, for 5 days per week, for 2 years. After this treatment, rats were observed for life. The tumour incidence in rats exposed to crocidolite was 3/57 (one mesothelioma and two carcinomas). In the control group, no tumours were observed in 184 rats.\n\nSpecial attention should be drawn to the crocidolite study with male Fischer rats of McConnell et al. (1994) because this study is very well documented. The exposure to 10 mg dust/m3 (with 1610 WHO fibres/mL containing 236 fibres > 20 µm) for 6 h per day, 5 days per week had to be stopped after 10 months because of unexpected mortality, which was interpreted as a sign that the maximum tolerated dose had been exceeded. The number of WHO fibres per µg dry lung tissue was 1850 (73 fibres > 20 µm) at the end of exposure and 759 WHO fibres (41 fibres > 20 µm) 12 months later. Fourteen out of 106 rats (13.2%), which survived the second year or longer, died with lung tumour (five of these rats developed lung carcinomas), and one rat also developed a mesothelioma. In the control group, 2/126 rats developed lung adenomas.\n\nIn two lifetime studies, male and female Fischer rats were exposed to either 10 mg/m3 erionite (Wagner et al., 1985) or an unknown concentration of erionite (Wagner, 1990) for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 12 months. Twenty seven out of 28 rats, and 24/27 rats developed pleural mesotheliomas, respectively. No lung tumours were observed. [The Working Group noted the lack of control group in the study by Wagner (1990).]\n\nMcConnell et al. (1999) exposed three groups of 125 male Syrian golden hamsters to 0.8, 3.7 and 7.1 mg/m3 amosite for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 78 weeks. They were then held unexposed for 6 weeks. Among animals that survived for at least 32 weeks, 3/83, 22/85 and 17/87 developed pleural mesotheliomas, respectively. No mesotheliomas were observed in 83 untreated controls and no lung tumours were observed in any groups.\n\nSome experiments were reported with baboons. After amosite exposure and crocidolite exposure for 4 years, 2/11 baboons and 3/21 baboons developed pleural mesothelioma, respectively (Goldstein & Coetzee, 1990; Webster et al., 1993).\n\n3.5. Oral administration\n\nA study on the carcinogenicity of ingested asbestos fibres involved male F344 rats groups exposed to amosite or chrysotile in combination with subcutaneous administration of a known intestinal carcinogen, azoxymethane (10 weekly injections of 7.4 mg/kg body weight). Fibres were administered three times a week for 10 weeks by intragastric bolus dosing (10 mg in 1 mL saline). The first experiment in this study included a full set of appropriate control groups. The experiment was terminated at 34 weeks. Neither amosite nor UICC chrysotile B, in combination with azoxymethane, increased the incidence of any intestinal tumours (≈10%) above that produced by azoxymethane alone, but the combination with either fibre type produced 4–5-fold increases (not significant, P > 0.1) in metastatic intestinal tumours. A second experiment with larger groups, the same dosing regimen, and for lifetime, but with a more limited design, tested only amosite in combination with azoxymethane versus azoxymethane. Amosite did not enhance azoxymethane-induced intestinal tumours (incidence, 77% versus 67%) (Ward et al., 1980; IOM, 2006). [The Working Group noted that the lack of untreated vehicle controls in the second experiment made interpretation of the results difficult considering that, compared to historical controls, there was a non-significant increase in intestinal tumours in rats exposed only to amosite (≈33%). One cannot know whether the results observed were associated with the asbestos or with irritation from the procedure, although one would not anticipate that gavage itself would impact the lower portion of the gastrointestinal tract.]\n\nThe most definitive animal studies of oral exposure to asbestos were a series of lifetime studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP, 1983, 1985, 1988, 1990a, b), in which asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, and amosite) was administered in the feed of rats and hamsters. Nonfibrous tremolite was also tested in rats according to the same protocol (NTP, 1990c). Exposure of dams of the study animals (1% in the diet) was followed by exposure of the pups by gavage (0.47 mg/g water) while they were nursing, and then in the diet for the remainder of their lives: they were exposed to asbestos at the level of 1%, which was estimated by the investigators to be about 70000 times the greatest possible human exposure in drinking-water. Histopathological examination of the entire colorectum was performed. No increases in the incidence of gastrointestinal lesions (inflammatory, preneoplastic, or neoplastic) were found after exposure to intermediate-length chrysotile (from Quebec) in hamsters, to short chrysotile (from New Idria) in rats or hamsters, to amosite in rats or hamsters, to crocidolite in rats, or to non-fibrous tremolite in rats. The mesentery was examined in detail, as well as mesenteric lymph nodes and sections of the larynx, trachea, and lungs from every animal. No lesions were found in any of those tissues. The only finding of note in the gastrointestinal tract was a slight increase in the incidence of adenomatous polyps in the large intestine after exposure to the intermediate-length chrysotile (from Quebec) in male rats (9/250 versus 0/85, P = 0.08), but preneoplastic changes in the epithelium were not found (NTP, 1985; IOM, 2006)."
