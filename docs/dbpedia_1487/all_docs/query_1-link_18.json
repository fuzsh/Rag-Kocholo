        "text": "All singles were in mono only until 1969, although Japan issued EP's in stereo.\n\nHowever, the answer to your deeper question is more complex. You asked...\n\nWhen and where were the stereo mixes of the Beatles' singles released?\n\nLet's go through the single tracks one by one...\n\nLove Me Do -- Master tapes deliberately destroyed; no stereo mixes possible.\n\nPS I Love You -- Master tapes deliberately destroyed; no stereo mixes possible.\n\nPlease, Please Me -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Please, Please Me LP (1963)\n\nAsk Me Why -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Please, Please Me LP (1963)\n\nFrom Me to You -- 1st appearance in stereo on the German \"Beatles Greatest\" LP (1965). The stereo mix was also sent to Capitol/USA in 1965, but they did not use it until 1973!\n\nThank You Girl -- 1st appearance in stereo on the American \"Beatles Second Album\" LP (1964)\n\nThe mono and stereo mixes of “Thank You Girl” were made immediately after the last overdub session on March 13th. “From Me to You” was mixed for mono and stereo the following day.\n\nShe Loves You -- Although it appears that parts of the backing track were used as the basis for \"Sie Liebt Dich,\" the single track has never appeared in true stereo. The original master tape is believed to have been stolen or destroyed.\n\nI'll Get You -- Based on the version on the Beatles Second Album, the original master tape may have an isolated harmonica on one channel. At any rate, the song has never appeared anywhere in true stereo.\n\nI Want to Hold Your Hand -- 1st appearance in stereo on the German \"Beatles Greatest\" LP (1965). The standard mix was created in 1966 and first appeared on the Collection of Beatles Oldies LP.\n\nThis Boy -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Canadian reissue single \"All My Loving\"/\"This Boy\" (1976).\n\nOn October 21st, 1963, both songs were mixed for mono and stereo. The 1963 stereo mix of \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" was not released until 1977, when it came out in Australia.\n\nCan't Buy Me Love -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Hard Day's Night LP.\n\nYou Can't Do That -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Hard Day's Night LP.\n\nA Hard Day's Night -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Hard Day's Night LP.\n\nThings We Said Today -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Hard Day's Night LP.\n\nI Feel Fine -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Collection of Beatles Oldies LP (1966).\n\nShe's a Woman -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Australian LP, \"Greatest Hits Vol. 2\" (1966).\n\nBoth songs were mixed for stereo in late 1964.\n\nTicket to Ride -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Help! LP (1965).\n\nYes it Is -- 1st appearance in stereo on the \"Only the Beatles\" cassette (1986).\n\nAlthough the b-side was mixed for stereo on 23 February, 1965, there were problems with sound dropout near the end of the recording. The song stayed on the shelf for 20 years.\n\nHelp! -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Help! LP (1965).\n\nI'm Down -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Japanese \"Help!\" EP (1965).\n\nWe Can Work it Out -- 1st appearance in stereo on the American \"Yesterday...And Today\" LP (1966)\n\nDay Tripper -- 1st appearance in stereo on the American \"Yesterday...And Today\" LP (1966)\n\nBoth of the above mixes were made in 1965 along with Rubber Soul. When the time came to create the LP, A Collection of Beatles Oldies, new mixes were made for that album. These 1966 mixes became the standard mixes. The 2009 remaster of \"Day Tripper\" is actually a tweaked version of the 1966 mix (an edit and extra echo) made for the \"1\" album.\n\nPaperback Writer -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Collection of Beatles Oldies LP (1966)\n\nRain -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Hey Jude album, released by Apple in several countries (1970)\n\n\"Rain\" was one of several anomalies -- songs that were not mixed for stereo until later -- in this case, 1969.\n\nYellow Submarine -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Revolver LP.\n\nEleanor Rigby -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Revolver LP.\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever -- 1st appearance in stereo on the American Magical Mystery Tour LP (1967).\n\nPenny Lane -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Australian Essential Beatles LP (late 1971).\n\nAlthough Capitol-USA requested and received a stereo mix of SFF, it appears that they did not request a stereo mix of \"Penny Lane.\" That song was not mixed for stereo until 1971. Shortly thereafter (1971), it was decided to create a new mix of SFF. That new mix first appeared on the German MMT album (1972) and became the standard mix.\n\nAll You Need is Love -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Yellow Submarine LP (1968).\n\nBaby, You're a Rich Man -- 1st appearance in stereo on the German Magical Mystery Tour LP (1972).\n\nHello Goodbye -- 1st appearance in stereo on the American Magical Mystery Tour LP\n\nI am the Walrus -- 1st appearance in stereo on the Magical Mystery Tour EP.\n\nLady Madonna -- 1st appearance in stereo on Apple's Hey Jude LP (1970).\n\nThe Inner Light -- 1st appearance in stereo on the British EP, The Beatles, which was released as part of the EP boxed set (1981).\n\nHey Jude -- 1st appearance in stereo on Apple's Hey Jude LP (1970).\n\nRevolution -- 1st appearance in stereo on Apple's Hey Jude LP (1970).\n\nGet Back -- 1st appearance in stereo on the American single (1969)\n\nDon't Let Me Down -- 1st appearance in stereo on the American single (1969)\n\nThe singles after Get Back were issued in stereo in England from the start.\n\nWhat a great post. Good work."
