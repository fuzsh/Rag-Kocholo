        "text": "History Highlight:\n\nToday in 1971, Isaac Hayes releases \"Theme From Shaft.\" This was the soul and funk-styled theme song to the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film 'Shaft'. The theme was shortened and released as a single that went to number two on the Billboard Soul Singles chart (behind \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\" by Marvin Gaye) and to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in November 1971. The following year, \"Theme from Shaft\" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, with Hayes becoming the first African American to win that honor - or any Academy Award in a non-acting category - as well as the first recipient of the award who both wrote and performed the winning song. Since then, the song has appeared in numerous television shows, commercials, and other movies, including the 2000 sequel Shaft, for which Hayes re-recorded the song.\n\nAlso, Today In:\n\n1955 - James Dean was killed in a car accident at age 24. Dean dies around the same time rock and roll comes alive (the #1 song the day he dies: Pat Boone's cover of \"Ain't That A Shame\").\n\n1965 - Donovan made his U.S. television debut on Shindig! along with The Hollies, The Turtles and the Dave Clark Five. Initially emerging from the British folk scene, Donovan reached fame in the U,K. with live performances on the pop TV series, Ready Steady Go!. His most successful singles were the early U.K. hits \"Catch the Wind\", \"Colours\" and \"Universal Soldier\" in 1965.\n\n1974 - Police were called to a Lynyrd Skynyrd and Blue Öyster Cult concert after a fight broke out between two sound engineers. The kerfuffle began when the Skynyrd tech claimed that the sound had been deliberately turned off during the band's set.\n\n1977 - Mary Ford — one-half of the musical team she formed with her husband, Les Paul — died from cancer after being in a diabetic coma for 54 days. Between 1950 and 1954, Les Paul and Mary Ford had 16 top-ten hits; in 1951 alone, they sold six million records.\n\n1978 - Exile started a four-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Kiss You All Over.\"\n\n1985 - Tom Waits released his ninth studio album, Rain Dogs. It features \"Jockey Full of Bourbon,\" \"Hang Down Your Head,\" and “Downtown Train.”\n\n1988 - John Lennon is awarded a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1750 Vine St.\n\n1988 - Neil Young played \"Rockin' In the Free World\" as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. Young, who was 43 at the time, came onstage wearing a leather jacket, Elvis T-shirt and faded jeans stitched with Toronto Maple Leafs motifs; he was backed by Charlie Drayton on bass, Steve Jordan on drums, and longtime sideman Frank \"Poncho\" Sampedro on second guitar.\n\n1989 - Bette Midler was awarded $400,000 in her lawsuit against the Ford Motor Company, which featured her former backing singer Ula Hedwig sing Midler's hit \"Do You Want To Dance\" in a 1985 commercial for the Mercury Sable. The verdict meant that companies can't purposely imitate the vocals of a famous singer in advertisements without consent.\n\n1991- Liza Minnelli receives a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame at 7000 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n1992 - Steve Earle was arrested in Nashville, Tenn., after he failed to report for jury duty.\n\n1993 - Kate Pierson of The B-52's was charged with criminal mischief and trespassing during an anti-fur protest at Vogue magazine's New York City offices.\n\n1995 - Mariah Carey made chart history when she started an eight-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. singles chart with \"Fantasy,\" making her the first woman to enter the chart in the No. 1 spot.\n\n2002 - The Rolling Stones released Forty Licks.\n\n2003 - Rockabilly performer Ronnie Dawson died of throat cancer in Dallas, Texas, at age 64.\n\n2006 - Justin Timberlake started a two-week run at No. 1 on the U.S. album chart with his second solo album, FutureSex/LoveSounds. It also became the biggest album ever for pre-orders on iTunes.\n\n2008 - Disney releases Nightmare Revisited, a cover album of songs from The Nightmare Before Christmas. The new album commemorates the fifteenth anniversary of the film's original 1993 release and features new arrangements by KoRn, Amy Lee of Evanescence, and Marilyn Manson.\n\n2011 - Guitarist and songwriter Marv Tarplin died at age 70. He was best-known as the guitarist for the Miracles from the 1950s through the early 1970s, and he co-wrote several of their biggest hits, including \"The Tracks of My Tears\".
