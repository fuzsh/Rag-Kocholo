        "text": "Classic Rock was a 31-volume series issued by Time Life during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The series spotlighted popular music played on Top 40 radio stations of the mid-to-late-1960s.\n\nMuch like Time-Life's other series chronicling popular music, volumes in the \"Classic Rock\" series covered a specific time period, including single years in some volumes and stylistic trends in others. Each volume was issued on a compact disc, cassette or (on volumes issued through 1990) 2-LP vinyl record set. Individual volumes generally contained 22 tracks, and represented the highlighted time period's most popular and noteworthy tracks. Also included was a booklet, containing liner notes written by some of the most respected historians of the genre, photographs of the artists, and information on the songs (writers, performers and peak position on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 chart).\n\n\"Classic Rock\" was first issued in the winter of 1988, with the first volume in the series titled Classic Rock: 1965. Like most compilation albums, songs by two of the era's most successful groups – The Beatles and The Rolling Stones – were not included due to licensing issues; however, several albums had cover art with drawings of male rock singers resembling The Beatles.\n\nAs was the case with Time-Life's other series, \"Classic Rock\" was advertised in television and magazine advertisements. The series was available by subscription (by calling a 1-800 number); those who purchased the series in that fashion received a new volume roughly every other month (on the format of their choice), and had the option of keeping the volumes they wanted.\n\nEach volume was also offered for individual sale. When the series was fully issued, a customer could purchase the entire series at once (or a group of albums, as packaged by Time-Life as part of a promotion), often at a discounted price.\n\nNew volumes continued to be issued through 1991, the final one being a volume titled Classic Rock: Rock Renaissance IV (an album of hard rock from the mid- to late-1960s). An additional volume, titled Totally Fantastic '60s, was released in 1996.\n\nTime-Life continued to offer \"Classic Rock\" through the early-2000s (decade), after which it was replaced by other series.\n\nIn 1999, Time-Life issued a \"budget\" box set, \"Classic '60s: Greatest Hits\", containing three CDs or cassettes of 12 songs each, for retail sale.\n\nAs with many of Time-Life Records' multi-volume releases, the volumes were not issued in a logical, sequential order by date or era of the subject; that is, issuing volumes covering 1964 before progressing to 1965. In the track information section, the volumes will be listed sequentially by era; the following list is the order in which the volumes were released.\n\nClassic Rock: 1965\n\nClassic Rock: 1966\n\nClassic Rock: 1964\n\nClassic Rock: 1968\n\nClassic Rock: 1967\n\nClassic Rock: 1969\n\nClassic Rock: 1966: The Beat Goes On\n\nClassic Rock: 1965: The Beat Goes On\n\nClassic Rock: 1964: The Beat Goes On\n\nClassic Rock: 1967: The Beat Goes On\n\nClassic Rock: 1968: The Beat Goes On\n\nClassic Rock: 1969: The Beat Goes On\n\nClassic Rock: 1966: Shakin' All Over\n\nClassic Rock: 1965: Shakin' All Over\n\nClassic Rock: 1967: Shakin' All Over\n\nClassic Rock: 1964: Shakin' All Over\n\nClassic Rock: Rock Renaissance\n\nClassic Rock: Creedence Clearwater Revival\n\nClassic Rock: 1968: Shakin' All Over\n\nClassic Rock: 1969: Shakin' All Over\n\nClassic Rock: Rock Renaissance II\n\nClassic Rock: 1966: Blowin' Your Mind\n\nClassic Rock: 1965: Blowin' Your Mind\n\nClassic Rock: 1967: Blowin' Your Mind\n\nClassic Rock: On the Soul Side\n\nClassic Rock: Rock Renaissance III\n\nClassic Rock: 1968: Blowin' Your Mind\n\nClassic Rock: On the Soul Side II\n\nClassic Rock: 1964: A Go Go\n\nClassic Rock: Bubblegum, Garage and Pop Nuggets\n\nClassic Rock: Rock Renaissance IV\n\nClassic Rock: Totally Fantastic '60s\n\n\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\" - Manfred Mann\n\n\"She's Not There\" - The Zombies\n\n\"What Kind of Fool (Do You Think I Am)\" - The Tams\n\n\"You Never Can Tell\" - Chuck Berry\n\n\"Come See About Me\" - Diana Ross & The Supremes\n\n\"Needles and Pins\" - Searchers\n\n\"I Get Around\" - The Beach Boys\n\n\"Farmer John\" - The Premiers\n\n\"Out of Limits\" - The Marketts\n\n\"Nobody I Know\" - Peter & Gordon\n\n\"I'm So Proud\" - The Impressions\n\n\"Hippy Hippy Shake\" - The Swinging Blue Jeans\n\n\"You Really Got Me\" - The Kinks\n\n\"Bread and Butter\" - The Newbeats\n\n\"Dead Man's Curve\" - Jan & Dean\n\n\"Bad to Me\" - Billy J.
