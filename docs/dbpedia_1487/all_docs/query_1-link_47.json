        "text": "Each Entry Contains:\n\nRelease Date ● Peak Chart Position ● Artist ● Song Title ● Time ● Original Label and Cat. Number.\n\nThe “Release Date” is not necessarily the date of the songs official release, but it’s Billboard chart appearance release date. Sometimes the difference between official release date and chart release date can differ, usually by no more than a week or two, but can go as long as years, depending on who released the single, and why it took so long to be released.\n\nThe “Peak Chart Position” is the highest position that song made it on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles charts. In the case of a “re-chart” single, say like Chubby Checker’s “The Twist” in 1960 and then later in 1962, the highest position of that single will count as its official peak position each time it was released. Re-charted singles will reappear on its official re-chart release date with its current peak position. Example includes Charlene’s “I’ve Never Been To Me” appears twice, once in September of 1977 and again in March of 1982, with two different peak positions for each chart entry (the first being #97 in 1977 and the other being #1 in 1982).\n\nThe “Artist” is just that, that artist for that single. The name listed is as accurate to its official label showing. In some cases, a song will be released by one artist over another (like Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney on “The Girl Is Mine”) but will vary depending on who is officially releasing that single (say like Paul McCartney & Michael Jackson on “Say, Say, Say” a year later). In the case of “The Girl Is Mine”, that is strictly a Michael Jackson single, and McCartney was a guest on it. And “Say, Say, Say” was strictly a McCartney record and Jackson guested on it.\n\nThe “Song Title” is accurately listed here according to how it is presented on the record label. All abbreviations, or usage of contractions, etc., are due to how the song was originally released. In the majority of cases, how I listed the song is the official title in accordance to the record label’s printing of the label.\n\nThe “Time of Song” is the original common total time of the song as officially listed on its original record label. Those times may vary, depending on whether or not the record company mastered the song slower/faster. or added the silence before or after the track. In most cases, however, the total time of the song is pretty much accurate.\n\nThe “Original Record Label and Catalog Number” is official according to the original single release. These numbers and labels do not display re-releases, re-issues or “gold standard” singles released retroactively. Should the song be re-issued as an official single, and appeared on the Billboard charts, it will be listed in its respective list with proper credit in accordance to that release. NOTE: On occasion the label and catalog number was not made available to me at the time of posting the information. Here. Little by little, and in due time, I will have that information corrected.\n\nThe Monthly Entries\n\nEach month of each year is titled appropriately (with month and year) and is broken up into each week. When you scroll down the list you will see that the first entry of each week of each month begins with the highest charted single of that month and then alphabetical by artists.\n\nWeekly Top 40 Charts\n\nA link is provided to our Weekly Billboard Top 40 charts. The work put into that site was too much to not interweave these two sites. Click the link to visit the site (HERE) and check out each and every Top 40 chart according to Billboard Magazine.\n\nThe Rock Era\n\nThe debut of the “Rock Era” is commonly known to be June 1955, when Bill Haley’s “(We’re Gonna) Rock Around The Clock” hit #1 on the Billboard pop/Top 40 charts. Through the years the Pop/Top 40 charts has remained relatively the same. Through radio airplay, sales/downloads, video plays, etc., these songs rank on these charts in order to keep an on-going record of what is popular, by whom, and when. In essence, the ranking of the pop charts is nothing more than just a document to history’s music and the artists that recorded and released them."
