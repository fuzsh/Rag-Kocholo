        "text": "Business Strategy Framework #1ANSOFF MATRIX ANALYSIS\n\nThe Ansoff Matrix is a business strategy framework and a planning tool that provides managers with a template to devise strategies for future growth.\n\nThere are 4 growth strategies within the Ansoff Matrix:\n\nMarket penetration strategy = in which the company seeks to improve business performance either; by increasing the volume of sales to its present customers or by finding new customers for present products;\n\nMarket development strategy = in which the company sells its existing products to new markets;\n\nProduct development strategy = in which the company develops new products for the same market;\n\nDiversification strategy = in which the company develops new products in a new market.\n\nWhat growth strategies does Apple use?\n\nLearn from our Ansoff Matris analysis of Apple.\n\nBusiness Strategy Framework #2BCG GROWTH-SHARE MATRIX\n\nThe BCG Growth-Share Matrix helps companies analyze their business units (i.e. their product lines) or any other cash-generating entities by their degree of profitability.\n\nThis business strategy framework provides the company with a four-quadrant chart where products are ranked on the basis of their relative market shares and growth rates:\n\n“cash cows”,\n\n“dogs”,\n\n“question marks” and\n\n“stars”.\n\nCash cows are products in low-growth areas for which the company has a high market share.\n\nProducts with a low market share in areas with slow growth are dogs.\n\nQuestion marks are the products with a low market share in a high growth rate market.\n\nStars are products with a high market share in a high growth rate market.\n\nTo show how you can use the matrix for your business, read our analysis of e-commerce leader Amazon, specifically four of its products: Amazon AWS, Amazon Video, Amazon Live and Amazon Echo with Alexa.\n\nBusiness Strategy Framework #3PORTER DIAMOND MODEL\n\nThe Porter Diamond Model is a business framework that describes a nation’s competitive advantage in the international market.\n\nIt also refers to innovation and why certain companies based in certain nations are capable of consistent innovation.\n\nThe 4 attributes of the Porter’s Diamond Model:\n\nFactor Conditions = defines the nation’s position in factors of production, such as labour, land, natural resources, capital or infrastructure, necessary to compete in a given industry.\n\nDemand Conditions = refers to the nature of home-market demand for the industry’s product or service.\n\nRelated and Supporting Industries = reveals the presence or absence in the nation of supplier industries and other related industries that are internationally competitive.\n\nFirm Strategy, Structure, and Rivalry = highlights the conditions in the nation governing how companies are created, organized, and managed, as well as the nature of domestic rivalry.\n\nCurious to see Porter’s Diamond Model applied to two leading brands?\n\nRead Porter’s Diamond Model Analysis – Louis Vuitton and BMW.\n\nBusiness Strategy Framework #4PESTEL\n\nPESTEL business analysis is a framework for helping entrepreneurs and business people to understand the impact of macro-environmental factors on their businesses.\n\nThe PESTEL acronym stands for 6 factors: POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, and LEGAL.\n\nPolitical factor = helps you appraise the degree to which a government intervenes in the economy or a certain industry.\n\nEconomic factor = examines the economic growth, exchange rates, interest rates, unemployment rates, the state of the country’s infrastructure, and taxes.\n\nSocial factor = analyzes the profile and behaviour patterns of your customers.\n\nTechnological factor = lists the technologies impacting your industry and whether they are or not favourable.\n\nEnvironmental factor = takes into account any negative impact your company operations have on the environment and prompts your company to reduce the carbon footprint, reduce waste and pollution, and preserve the environment.\n\nLegal factor = looks into the laws and regulations of your industry.\n\nNot sure how to apply the framework to your business?\n\nRead A Pestel Analysis of Nike.\n\nBusiness Strategy Framework #5PORTER’S 5 FORCES\n\nPorter’s 5 Forces framework is a valuable business tool that helps entrepreneurs shape their strategy to drive profitability.\n\nPorter’s 5 forces are:\n\n1. Existing rivals = Evaluate the existing rivals by looking at the number of competitors, their size and power, the industry growth rate and product differentiation.\n\n2. Buyers = The buyers are powerful and can influence the industry if they make purchases in large volumes. Are they price-sensitive? Do they have many alternatives to buy from?\n\n3. Suppliers = Factors in determining supplier power: number of suppliers and concentration, switching costs, availability of substitutes, uniqueness of product, whether or not the industry is an important customer of the supplier and its availability to cut out the middleman.\n\n4. Substitutes = Substitutes are alternative products that fulfil the same need by different means. In the airline industry, the substitutes are trains and cars.\n\n5. New rivals = Is it easy for new rivals to enter the industry? If the entry barrier is low, which means requirements to enter the industry are affordable or readily accessible, then there are increasing chances of new entrants in great numbers. In this case, the threat is high."
