        "text": "HE SAID, SHE SAID\n\nIn a recent survey we asked the more than 200 married couples who share degrees from Owen about their relationships. The answers we received were funny, touching and altogether heartfelt. Below are some of our favorites. (Please note that answers have been edited for length.)\n\n______________________________________________\n\nWHAT DO YOU REMEMBER MOST ABOUT YOUR FIRST DATE WITH YOUR SPOUSE?\n\nI remember coming around the corner and thinking, “Wow.” It really wasn’t a planned date, but it became one after I saw her.\n\nAlex Bailey, MBA’92\n\nHe had a machete in his belt and was driving a HUGE Buick Park Avenue. Oh yeah, it was some sort of costume party. We ended up going dancing afterwards.\n\nBeth Ann Siemanski Bailey, MBA’92\n\n12th and Porter. Great food, plenty of drinks, and many laughs.\n\nRussell Fleischer, MBA’91\n\nThe first date is debated in this household. Edgar believes it was at Sbarro at Green Hills Mall. I believe it was a candlelit dinner at some nearby restaurant.\n\nCara Yamamoto Heilmann, MBA’94\n\nI think our first date was a game of squash at the Rec Center and then dinner at Cafe Coco. She thinks our first “official” date was bowling at Melrose Bowling Lanes and then Zanies Comedy Club. Either way, I remember trying to beat her at both bowling and squash.\n\nWill Hughes, MBA’02\n\nHe cleaned his car for me—misleading me into thinking he was a neat person!\n\nKate Reid Laing, MBA’01\n\nI remember thinking he had to come from a good family because his mom had sent him back to school with a cooler full of frozen homegrown field peas and cream-style corn. I found that very attractive.\n\nAshley McDonnell Lane, MBA’03\n\nWe met on the first day of class while approaching the school. She asked me for directions even though a large sign saying “Welcome Owen Students” was clearly visible. After a keg reception for new students, I invited her to Rotier’s for a hamburger. We didn’t date again for six months.\n\nMichael P. Peck, JD’81, MBA’81\n\nI cooked dinner for him, and it turned out all wrong. He was a much better cook (still is!) and was very gracious during that first date. He helped me figure out how to fix the dinner, and that began the relationship we have today!\n\nCarolyn Bowman Pugh, MBA’85\n\nEverything. Sam Shepard’s Fool for Love. Dinner at a Chinese restaurant. That there would be a second date.\n\nBobby Rouse Jr., MBA’86\n\nEating dinner while sitting on the floor. It was my first time at a traditional Thai restaurant, and although the food was amazing, getting up and down from my seat wasn’t the most graceful thing I’ve done.\n\nAshley Wright Scharpf, MBA’97\n\nWe went to the Italian Street Fair in Nashville, and the thing I remember is riding these swings that we now refer to as the “kick booty ride.” The idea was that you’d push the people in front of you with your legs so that they’d fly faster and higher. We went on that ride several times, and we’ve been kicking each other’s booty ever since.\n\nDonna Zavada Wilkinson, MBA’93\n\nTalking about how excited we were to start business school and feeling like we had so much in common right away.\n\nKimberly Achziger Yoo, MBA’99\n\n______________________________________________\n\nWHAT DO YOU ADMIRE MOST ABOUT YOUR SPOUSE?\n\nHer dad said it best at our rehearsal dinner: “When she’s around, everything is more fun.”\n\nMike Dorr, BS’99, MBA’05\n\nHis intelligence.\n\nKathy Dillard Dorr, MBA’05\n\nHis perseverance, humor and kindness.\n\nLeslie Talmadge Ellwood, MBA’98\n\nHer attention to detail (which incidentally is also my biggest pet peeve about her).\n\nBrent Guinn, MBA’01\n\nHer absolute devotion to those she loves and to the interests she pursues.\n\nChris Jones, MBA’87\n\nHe is loving, intelligent, funny, and a great father to our children.\n\nPamela Dokecki Landes, BS’89, MBA’90\n\nI admire David’s sense of humor even during times of tremendous stress. I also admire what a loving and affectionate father he is to our two boys, Jameson and Payton.\n\nMindy Sauers McGrath, MBA’97\n\nHelen has maintained independence and achieved success without making some of the sacrifices that many career women have to make. She does it with enormous energy and a tremendous heart.\n\nKeith Hampton Parsons, BS’79, MBA’85\n\nHis ability to listen and provide sound, encouraging advice.\n\nHelen McCormick Parsons, MBA’84\n\nStephanie’s ability to connect with all sorts of people.\n\nSteve Pendray, MBA’04\n\nSteve’s utter confidence in me: letting me do my own thing and have an individual personality and life, as well as our life together.\n\nStephanie Warren Pendray, MBA’03\n\nBesides her beauty, I would say communication skills. Elaine speaks English better than most Americans even though she has only been in the United States since 2002. Elaine is a native Chinese speaker.\n\nJonathan Weindruch, BA’98, MBA’04\n\n______________________________________________\n\nWHAT’S YOUR BIGGEST PET PEEVE ABOUT YOUR SPOUSE?\n\nShe drapes things on door knobs. Who knew they could be used as hangers for clothes and purses?!\n\nJames Wade Brunstad, MMgt’75\n\nHis frustrations with his golf game.\n\nMargaret Hayes Brunstad, MMgt’75\n\nShe doesn’t always wear matching socks.\n\nKrunch Kloberdanz, BS’97, MBA’03\n\nHis nightly habit of leaving jugs of Pace picante sauce and bags of chips opened around the house!\n\nCourtney Brakebill Kloberdanz, BS’98, MBA’03\n\nWho needs Wikipedia? He knows everything.\n\nMarian Eichelman Matthis, EMBA’92\n\nUnrealistic standards of cleanliness.\n\nThomas McDaniel, MBA’02\n\nInability to keep the house neat.\n\nKristen Ruggles McDaniel, MBA’02\n\nShe keeps bothering me about getting a pet.\n\nRobert J. Misey Jr., JD’87, MBA’87\n\nMy only pet peeve is that we don’t have a pet!\n\nMonica Vaeth Misey, MBA’88\n\nIs this a Cosmo survey?\n\nNeil Stevens Rankin, MBA’00\n\nHe has an MBA yet doesn’t know how to make a five-year-old’s lunch.\n\nLauren Girard Rankin, MBA’00\n\nHe hardly ever closes doors after opening them—closet doors, cabinet doors, etc. A friend suggested that the next time he drops me off to park the car that I just get out and walk away without closing the car door. I have yet to do that. I just can’t.\n\nClara Proctor Sohan, MBA’00\n\n______________________________________________\n\nWHO HAS BETTER BUSINESS SENSE, YOU OR YOUR SPOUSE?\n\nShe does, but she would never admit to it.\n\nPhil Day, MBA’92\n\nHe thinks he does, but I believe that I do, at least with big decisions. He is great at making everyday decisions, and I am better at making the once-in-a-while big decisions in life.\n\nPaulee Coughlin Day, BA’90, MBA’92\n\nIt’s not a matter of being better. It’s a matter of being different. He’s an EVP of Finance for Sovereign Bank, so he’s very concerned with the bottom line. I’m in market research and am much more concerned about evaluating and predicting marketplace behavior.\n\nPatty Silvester Dew, MBA’84\n\nI am a better salesperson, but Kevin is much stronger at looking at the bigger picture.\n\nChristina Kennedy Hause, MBA’93\n\nBruce is a great strategic and long-term thinker and delegator. I’m hands-on and very thorough and organized. We are both good motivators of people.\n\nVicki Simons Heyman, BA’79, MBA’80\n\nWe both are good, but he is the only one who reads the small print.\n\nElena Karoulina de Leon, MBA’99\n\nI am the bigger risk taker, and I have a better gut feel for business opportunities. That said, she has more sense.\n\nWade Lee, MBA’84\n\nI do about most things except people. She can read people better than I can.\n\nJack Long, MBA’83\n\nDefinitely him because I’ve forgotten too much! As a homemaker and volunteer, I’m probably more organized, but he’s the true business genius.\n\nCarolyn Adams Long, MBA’83\n\nThis will sound WAY too politically correct, but I think we are each strong in different areas. We capitalize on this diversity and frequently bounce ideas off of one another.\n\nRick Marsh, EMBA’06\n\nThis one is tough. We have such different strengths. I love being able to come home from work and ask his advice since he has a different perspective and great business sense.\n\nHeather Vaughn Marsh, MBA’05\n\nMe, but it hasn’t been tested for a while unless you count negotiating with teenagers.\n\nJacki Voyles Tengi, BA’88, MBA’90\n\n______________________________________________\n\nIF YOUR SPOUSE HAD TO CHOOSE ANOTHER LINE OF WORK, WHAT WOULD HE/SHE BE BEST SUITED FOR?\n\nGraphic design. He loves to tinker on the computer and has a creative side.\n\nLesley Harper Bartley, MBA’05\n\nAlthough Steve has had a very successful career in commercial real estate, he would be a great high school football coach.\n\nCara Lilly Belcher, BE’83, MBA’86\n\nInterestingly he gravitates toward medical topics. I think that he would have made a great doctor.\n\nCindy McCallen Cassity, BA’90, MBA’94\n\nMatt is a great philosopher and has a gift for sales. Not sure what that qualifies him to do in his next career. Perhaps tourist vacations with the Dalai Lama? Seriously, he loves investing. Maybe a money manager?\n\nKarla Newburger Diehl, MBA’87\n\nMusic teacher.\n\nQuentin Hicks, MBA’04\n\nQuen’s dream is to open a restaurant one day. He is a grilling and cooking aficionado. I bet he could beat Bobby Flay at a barbeque cook-off any day of the year.\n\nShanon Gutierrez Hicks, MBA’04\n\nMotivational speaker or career coach.\n\nT.A. Iadevaia, MBA’91\n\nBuilding houses for Habitat for Humanity.\n\nKim Weaver Iadevaia, MBA’92\n\nI am firmly convinced that my wife could be the best teacher in the world. I watch her with our children, and I am amazed.\n\nCraig Montgomery, MBA’00\n\nI think he would be a terrific mentor of some sort. Over the years I have consistently been amazed at the number of colleagues, employees and friends who have sought out Craig’s guidance on career and other business decisions.\n\nWhitney Malocha Montgomery, MBA’00\n\nHostage negotiations working for the SWAT team. She would drive any hostage-taker to tears of frustration with her relentless persistence and Vulcan-like logic. The hostage-taker would clearly see the futility of the situation and surrender without violence.\n\nStein Soelberg, MBA’97"
