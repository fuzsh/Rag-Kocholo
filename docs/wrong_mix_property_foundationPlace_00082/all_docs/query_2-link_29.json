The document discusses Ansoff's Matrix, which outlines four strategic options for organizations: market penetration, market development, product development, and diversification. It provides examples and analysis of each option. Market penetration involves increasing market share with an existing product in an existing market. Market development means offering an existing product in a new market, while product development is introducing a new product to an existing market. Diversification, the riskiest option, involves offering a completely new product in a new market.",
