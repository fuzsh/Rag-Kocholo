        "text": "Given the complex and disruptive open-ended dynamics in the current dynamic global environment, senior management recognizes the need for a formalized, consistent, and comprehensive framework to analyze the firm’s strategic posture. Modern assessment tools, such as H. Igor Ansoff’s seminal contributions to strategic diagnosis, primarily focused on identifying and enhancing the firm’s strategic performance potential through the analysis of the industry’s environmental turbulence level relative to the firm’s aggressiveness and responsiveness of capability. Other epistemic modeling techniques envisage Porter’s generic strategic positions, Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT), and Resource-Based View as useful methodologies to aid in the planning process. All are complex and involve multiple managerial perspectives. Over the last two decades, attempts have been made to comprehensively classify the firm’s future competitive position. Most of these proposals utilized matri...\n\nThe purpose of this paper is twofold; first, a typology examining the multiple dimensions of H. Igor Ansoff’s Strategic Success Paradigm and the frequency of use of each of the paradigm’s components relative to the formulation of corporate level strategy in forprofit and not-for-profit organizations. Based on evidence from industry journals, there is both an implicit and explicit acknowledgement of its acumen and it’s efficacy as a whole or in part with multinational, multi-business firms faced with volatile, discontinuous, novel and environmental dynamism. The strategic success paradigm is empirically validated and supported by industry evidence that provides results of a firm’s increased financial performance. However, there is a noticeable lack of visibility of Ansoff’s Strategic Success Paradigm within the traditional academic strategic management textbooks. Therefore, the second focus of this paper will attempt to determine through a pragmatic perspective, why this dichotomy ex...\n\nhe main objective of the study is to develop a tool for assessing the balance of the company&#39;s product portfolio, with which you can determine the security of its competitive position. As such a tool is proposed matrix positioning. The indicator of the balance of the product portfolio is the golden ratio. The relevance of this study lies in the fact that currently there is no generally accepted criterion for determining the degree of balance in the product portfolio, and that the existing matrix analysis tools do not fully provide an adequate assessment of the security of a competitive position. The study of the topic in the article is carried out in the following logical sequence: the author proves the legitimacy of using the golden ratio as the main indicator for assessing the balance of the product portfolio, then suggests the algorithm for assessing the security of the product portfolio developed by the author; further author considers modern methods for evaluating the produ...\n\nIn today's economy, there are many fluctuations, especially and the strongest impact on the economy today is the Covid-19 pandemic, which has caused a significant decline in many economies, even the world's leading economies such as the US, China, and Japan are also significantly affected. In many respects, education is perhaps the most stable, although affected by other factors. But that does not mean that the field is not affected by unexpected factors. As we can clearly see many educational corporations have gradually shifted their business strategies to fit the current times. But how, to know if your business strategy will bring business efficiency to the business or not. Therefore, the use of matrices for strategy analysis is extremely important before making an implementation decision. And there are plenty of business analytics matrices out there, each with their own pros and cons. We will use the Hofer matrix, which analyzes the pros and cons of the strategy and helps the business to increase its position. How effective is the analysis and effectiveness of the matrix? We will learn based on the application of Hofer matrix to analyze the business strategy of an educational group, which is Nguyen Hoang Group. One of the famous educational corporations and also has many business strategies worth learning.\n\nFive more days to go until the new year, it was a warm, pleasant and busy morning in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. As the clock ticked 10 times, Aditya Bhagat (Aditya), a young, ambitious, passionate entrepreneur, is seemingly intrigued and curious. Exactly 30 minutes from now, he is scheduled to meet Surya Prasad (Surya), his friend, counterpart and co-founder of BankBuddy ( www.bankbuddy.ai ). Half the office is already empty as most of the associates had left for the year-end holidays, Aditya wanted to use this time to carefully brainstorm, methodically plan and articulate his business strategies and get them ready for execution in the new year. Marketing strategy is of particular importance, arguably the most critical and complex element that also needs the most attention in the overall exercise. He clearly understands that their current business strategy of being headquartered in Dubai and staying focused on artificial intelligence 1 (AI) powered solutions for the banking indust..."
