        "text": "‘AI wOn’t TaKe mY jOb, SoMeOnE wHo CaN UsE AI will’ Was one of the most overused quotes from the Cannes panels this year. But, as overused as it was, it’s probably true. At least, that’s why I wanted to speak with Omar Karim. There is nobody that I know that’s using AI like him. 💅🏻 He’s made an AI influencer with money he was going to use to buy a bike. 🏴☠️ He’s made AI pirate stations. 👩 And he’s even made an AI mum. I love Omar for many reasons. But mostly, because he’s ACKSHULLY playing around with this. Not just talking about it, he’s making mistakes publicly, and he’s using it as more than just ‘a tool’. Listen to this episode if you want to find out why AI isn’t just a tool. Or just listen to the wonders of Omars fascinating mind. P.S - If you’re in LA next week, hit Omar up as he’s heading out there. Full ep in the comments.\n\nOne of the things I really struggle with is building a culture of high performance. Push too hard. Everyone burns out and you feel bad. Push too soft. Everyone starts to accept mediocre as ok and you feel frustrated. In the early days of UNKNOWN, I think I over indexed on ‘feelings’. If I’m deeply honest, I think I projected my people-pleasing-co-dependent-LOVE ME insecurities onto everyone which led to me force feeding high performers with therapy and a lot of ‘yeah, but are you actually ok?’ I convinced myself I was being progressive. A lot of the time, it was actually the total opposite. These days, it’s a balance. We look backwards. And we think more about what we want out of forwards. I’m blessed to have people like Ellie Gould in my management team who shares the same love for woo woo and Woohoo. (That’s spirituality and performance for those linguists out there) At the end of what has been our biggest and hardest working Q, where we all looked a bit knackered, she ran this incredible exercise. And, if you’re in any kind of team, you should steal it: 1. Reflect: Think of the last three months. Write a challenge down. Write something your proud of. Write the sentence: Last Quarter I struggled with x. So I’m going to x. I’m proud of achieving x. And x made me happy. 2. Admire: Write one thing you have admired about the person you have been given in your ‘zenvelope’. 3. Bigphat group OMMMMMMM. OK, the last one may lose a few of you. But seriously… That was thirty of the nicest, purest, most vulnerable minutes I’ve spent with everyone in that room. And it just took two questions. Thanks, Elz.\n\nA lot of the time, UNKNOWN gets mistaken for a design agency. At first I thought we had done something wrong. These days, I take it as the biggest complement. But, every now and then, I think it’s important to explain a little more about what we ACTUALLY do. So, for 90% of the time… We are a creative recruitment agency, helping brands and agencies build six different types of teams: ⚫ Design teams (Branding Designers/Conceptual Designers) ⚫ Creative teams (Art Directors/Copywriters/Teams) ⚫ Product teams (UX/UI/Product Management/User Research) ⚫ Strategy teams (Strategists/Planners) ⚫ Client Services teams (Account Managers/Directors) ⚫ Leadership teams (C level/VP’s) Because our major talent is getting people to uncover their talent and truth, we put ourselves in places where that happens more naturally, so for the other 10% we… ⚫ Run a podcast about the design and creative industry (Untalented) and ask questions to make our guests seem as human as possible. ⚫ We run workshops on how we can make the agency world a better place. ⚫️ We have focus groups of CEOs which turn out to be more like group therapy. ⚫ We try to write what people are thinking and feeling in the industry so people feel heard. ⚫ We introduce brands to agencies or independent creative / designers sometimes too. So yeah, simply put: We introduce creative people on a mission to other creative people on a journey, to make wildly successful work together. And we aim to do that in the most unexpected way possible.\n\nSix years ago we met for the first time. And you’d drive 4 hours from Swindon to Wimbledon to record a podcast (going out to about 13 people back then) with us. Today, you’re putting your first book out, about to become a Sunday Times best seller, you’ve already changed the lives of millions… And you’re filling out scary, sort of biblical looking like places like this. Proud of what you’ve achieved, lucky to know you so well and so so so happy you’re getting the platform you’ve always deserved. Josh Connolly\n\n6 months ago I remember writing about how last year was our first financial ‘flat line’ year. Which, originally felt quite demoralising to write. But, I think it was the single most powerful driver of what then followed. I know this platform doesn’t need any more self promotion, but, given that I’m sharing the lows, I’m going to share the highs too. We just… after 18 months of bumpiness, completely obliterated our quarterly target. Like, actually nearly double our best ever quarter ever. In fact, I think this is what we did in the first 7 months of last year. 18 months of graft and pursuing what we think the future looks like and… doubling down on what we’re good at letting go of worlds that don’t serve us, parting ways with clients that don’t respect us, spending more time getting getting to know what makes people unique, getting deeper than ever in our briefings, building mini niche communities, serving them to our best ability, recording 50+ podcasts, running workshops, meeting over 150 CEOs, listening to over 1,700 of some of the brightest brains our industry has to offer… We’ve found over 165 people new homes, smashed our target and, in a twist of fate, are now tracking to hit an annual forecast that I wrote in my most optimistic mindset 2 years ago. Wild. A much needed celebratory moment as it’s been a slog. Then it’s back to the mission. BUT, before we do that, we must rent out a double decker bus and sing Cher - Believe at the top of our lungs. UNKNOWN\n\nGender pay gap conversations come around once a year, right? International women’s day. Everyone panics. Suddenly HR gets a flurry of intense messages from the CEO. ‘Have we made progress on this btw?’ Not for Polly McMorrow and McCann London. She has the data ready so if anyone asks her how they’re doing, that month, week, day or hour, Polly can tell you. Why? Because she’s committed to something she deeply (and genuinely) cares about. More interestingly, she’s not committing to every single social challenge out there and promising change. Its hard to be a CEO in this hyper connected world. And it’s easy to say you care about making change about everything that matters. But, what I admire about Polly is that she’s picked what she wants to make an impact on, and she’s decided to report on that thing. That takes courage and a bigphat dollop of authenticity. Listen to the full pod in the comments. UNKNOWN\n\nThe generation that entered our industry in 2020 got robbed of something major. Making mistakes. And recovering from them. We have a fear of failure problem. An endless pursuit of perfectionism problem. And I strongly believe it’s because of the working conditions that we’ve created post covid. I’m not just talking about learning stuff IRL. I’m talking about witnessing real life mistakes. Senior people fluffing their presentation. An ECD pitching an idea badly. A CEO taking a punt that doesn’t pay off. It’s why leaders like Polly McMorrow need to be shouted about. A CEO that invites you to be as unapologetically yourself as possible. A CEO that wants you to die on a hill for something you truly believe in. A CEO that gives you agency to make whatever decision you want, so long as you believe in it. I thoroughly enjoyed talking all things authenticity and magpies with Polly. This one was a pure joy to record. Thank you ☺️\n\nWe had a few favourite moments from Cannes this year. But nothing more than story time with Ernest Lupinacci. So, when I heard Ernest was in town, I asked if he’d come and verbatim repeat everything he said to us at 1am. He did. It was magical. Or as Ernest would say… F*cking sensational. And I think our first guest of a new series that we’ve not yet named. No doubt Ernest will help us there 👀 UNKNOWN\n\n‘I designed that… and it’s one of my proudest achievements’ mark whelan said to me as I walked out of the Havas London HQ. There are two things I love about out this… 1. An accomplished (British) leader being ok with saying ‘that’s one of my proudest achievements’. That just doesn’t happen. 2. The proudest achievement being something physical. That you can walk on. Look at. Touch. I wrote a thing about Spatial design making a resurgence recently. And I think a return to ‘physical’ isn’t just a counter movement to all the chat about AI and screens. I think it’s primal. I think humans want to feel things again. I think it’s why Cannes was flooded with humans. And I think it’s why Brands are investing in retail, experiential, events. Either way, if you didn’t know, now you know that Mark designed those cool stairs at Havas… and it’s actually a map of Kings Cross made from used metal from Kings Cross station. Luzz it. Thanks, Mark."
