Section 12.1Implementation Introduction This chapter focuses on the processes for creating and evaluating the activities that are necessary to implement both the strategic and marketing plans. Through the implementa- tion process, employees are assigned tasks and given the authority and resources needed to create the activities that bring the plans to life. Plans are written documents that specify what the organization wants to accomplish in the future; the tasks carried out by the orga- nization’s managers and staff turn those plans into reality. The evaluation and control of the plans involve determining whether objectives are being accomplished and taking the actions needed to align results with objectives. Evaluation involves comparing actual results to objec- tives and analyzing differences. Control refers to decisions or actions taken by management to bring results into alignment with objectives. 12.1 Implementation A classic Harvard Business Review article carried the title “Hustle as Strategy”—the point being that more is gained from a good strategy with great implementation than from a great strategy with good implementation (Bhide, 1986). “Hustle,” or implementation, can make or break a company in many marketing situations. The firm that achieves excellence in the skills needed for implementing a marketing plan may be achieving a competitive advantage that perhaps has eluded it in the strategy development stage of the planning process. However, excellent implementation of a poorly conceived strategy is akin to great advertising of a ter- rible product—the disaster occurs much sooner than if the excellence was not there! Thus, successful organizations have found ways to be good at both the development and implemen- tation of marketing plans. Implementation Skills To this point of the textbook, the emphasis has been on developing plans that focus on deliv- ering patient value at a competitive advantage. The goal is the desire to consider the impact of actions on the long-term as well as the short-term welfare of patients and society .\n\n12 Implementation, Evaluation, and ControliStockThinkstoc.docx\n\n12 Implementation, Evaluation, and ControliStockThinkstoc.docxnovabroom\n\n12 Implementation, Evaluation, and Control iStock/Thinkstock It is a bad plan that admits of no modification. —Publilius Syrus Maxim 469 Learning Objectives After reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: • List the four types of implementation skills that are necessary to successfully translate a strategic goal into implemented activities. • Identify six forces that can affect or cause resistance to change and innovation in a healthcare setting. • Explain the roles played by people, systems, corporate cultures, and organizational structures in success- fully organizing for the implementation of an organization’s strategy. • Describe the relationship between planning and control in the planning process. • Discuss the use of the balanced scorecard approach to performance evaluation, and identify the four key control areas for performance evaluation.

The committee consists of both IT managers (from each location), two department heads from each location, the chief financial officer, the director of operations, a senior applications programmer, and a senior systems programmer. During the kickoff meeting, you briefly mention a few advance preparation steps the committee needs to know about. In response, the committee asks you to create a full report or slide presentation of the steps that need to be considered in advance for Windows Server 2016 installations. In your report or slide show, present all of the steps appropriate to Gym Masters' situation Case Project 2-2: Server Roles The committee has recently been discussing the functions of each server. They are not familiar with server roles, but they do know how specific servers are used. Some of the server functions they mention include: Providing a website Supporting mobile devices for accessing the server over the network Offering shared files on large scale Managing Active Directory functions for the domain Offering VPNs Coordinating printing Providing web-based applications to internal users Create a short report for the committee that translates each of these functions into server roles offered through Windows Server 2016. Also, suggest some other roles that are likely necessary on the company's networks (Hint: Consider managing IP address assignments and translating computer names and IP addresses). Include a short explanation of each server role you mention..\n\nBanks are singled out for special attention in the financial sys.pdf\n\nBanks are singled out for special attention in the financial sys.pdfMAYANKBANSAL1981\n\nBanks are singled out for special attention in the financial system because Banks are singled out for special attention in the financial system because Banks are singled out for special attention in the financial system because Financial Analyses - Provide answers based on both qualitative and quantitative analyses to the following questions: 1.

Monitoring Internet Endpoints and Bandwidth Consumption1. NetFl.pdfMAYANKBANSAL1981\n\nA. Monitoring Internet Endpoints and Bandwidth Consumption 1. NetFlow/Slow: NetFlow and Slow are protocols used for monitoring network traffic. Network devices like routers and switches can be configured to export flow data to a collector. This data includes information such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, and the volume of data transferred. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into which clients are communicating with which servers and the amount of bandwidth they are using. 2. Packet Sniffers: Packet sniffers like Wireshark capture and analyze individual network packets. They provide a detailed view of network traffic, including the actual data payload. While this approach is thorough, it can be resource-intensive, and storing all packets may require significant storage capacity. 3. Proxy Servers: Deploying a proxy server can help monitor internet usage by clients. Proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and servers, logging all requests and responses. This provides detailed logs of web traffic, including URLs visited, data transferred, and user activity. 4. Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): IDS/PS systems are designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious or unauthorized activity. They use predefined rules or anomaly detection algorithms to identify potentially malicious behavior. When such behavior is detected, these systems generate logs and alerts for further investigation. If we lack the resources to capture and store all network packets, we can consider using sampling techniques to capture a representative subset of traffic or filtering criteria to focus on specific types of traffic. For instance, you might prioritize capturing and storing packets for traffic to and from critical servers or for specific applications critical to our organization's operations. B. Identifying the Local Host in a Data Exfiltration Event Identifying the local host involved in data exfiltration from external server logs can be done as follows: 1. Identify the External IP Address: Look in the web server logs to find the external IP address associated with the data exfiltration. This IP address typically corresponds to our company's router or firewall through which the data left our network. 2. Analyze High-Level TCP Port Number: Examine the high-level TCP port number in the logs. Some services or applications use specific ports. This can help us narrow down the scope of potential local hosts. 3. Check Firewall or Network Device Logs: Access logs on our company's router/firewall or other network devices responsible for outgoing traffic. Look for outbound connections originating from the internal IP address linked to the external IP address identified in the web server logs. 4. Cross-reference with Internal Logs: If your internal network has logs, such as firewall logs or proxy server logs, cross-reference the external IP address and port number with these logs. This will enable us to identify the local ho.\n\nAbout your clientName Samantha BensonAge 54Marital status .pdf\n\nAbout your clientName Samantha BensonAge 54Marital status .pdfMAYANKBANSAL1981\n\nAbout your client: Name: Samantha Benson Age: 54 Marital status: Married 2 adult children with former spouse, 1 minor child with current spouse Health: Great health (an active tri-athlete) but a family history of heart disease Occupation: Senior Director for Lion Industries, a $3 Billion Industrial Materials Firm Income: $270,000 salary per year + bonus/stock options up to $1.5M Total assets: $2.2M (not including value of home) Total debt: $750,000 (which mostly is a mortgage on her primary residence of $600k) Dependents: Minor child is age 17 Other notes: It is important to Samantha to provide for all 3 of her children in the event of her early death.

The new team is responsible for the small maintenance operations for the cars in the InstantRide system. The main idea is to take actions faster and minimize the time spent for the maintenance. Therefore, the Car Maintenance team wants to store MAINTENANCE_TYPE_ID (char(5)) and a MAINTENANCE_TYPE_DESCRIPTION (varchar(30)) in the database. Using MAINTENANCE_TYPE_ID as the PRIMARY KEY, create a new table, MAINTENANCE_TYPES, and send the table description with the column names and types to the Car Maintenance team. 2The Car Maintenance team also wants to store the actual maintenance operations in the database. The team wants to start with a table to store CAR_ID (CHAR(5)), MAINTENANCE_TYPE_ID (CHAR(5)) and MAINTENANCE_DUE (DATE) date for the operation. Create a new table named MAINTENANCES. The PRIMARY_KEY should be the combination of the three fields. The CAR_ID and MAINTENANCE_TYPE_ID should be foreign keys to their original tables. Cascade update and cascade delete the foreign keys. 3The Driver Relationship team wants to create some workshops and increase communication with the active drivers in InstantRide. Therefore, they requested a new database table to store the driver details of the drivers that have had at least one ride in the system. Create a new table, ACTIVE_DRIVERS, from the DRIVERS and TRAVELS tables which contains the following fields: 4The Driver Relationship team wants to have quick search options for the active drivers. The team specifically mentioned that they are using first name, last name and driving license ID to search the drivers. Create an index called NameSearch on the ACTIVE_DRIVERS table created in task 3. 5The Driver Relationship team requested to ensure that there will be no duplicates in the active drivers tables in terms of first name, last name and driving license ID. You need to create a constraint in the ACTIVE_DRIVERS table, called DuplicateCheck, to ensure the first name, last name, and the driving license ID are unique. 6The Car Maintenance team considered that the available maintenance tasks should also have the price information in the database. Alter the MAINTENANCE_TYPES table to include a new column named MAINTENANCE_PRICE of type DECIMAL(5,2).."
