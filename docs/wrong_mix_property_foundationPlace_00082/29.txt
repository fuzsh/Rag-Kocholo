HE SAID, SHE SAID

In a recent survey we asked the more than 200 married couples who share degrees from Owen about their relationships. The answers we received were funny, touching and altogether heartfelt. Below are some of our favorites. (Please note that answers have been edited for length.)

WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER MOST ABOUT YOUR FIRST DATE WITH YOUR SPOUSE?

I remember coming around the corner and thinking, “Wow.” It really wasn’t a planned date, but it became one after I saw her.

Alex Bailey, MBA’92

He had a machete in his belt and was driving a HUGE Buick Park Avenue. Oh yeah, it was some sort of costume party. We ended up going dancing afterwards.

Beth Ann Siemanski Bailey, MBA’92

12th and Porter. Great food, plenty of drinks, and many laughs.

Russell Fleischer, MBA’91

The first date is debated in this household. Edgar believes it was at Sbarro at Green Hills Mall. I believe it was a candlelit dinner at some nearby restaurant.

Cara Yamamoto Heilmann, MBA’94

I think our first date was a game of squash at the Rec Center and then dinner at Cafe Coco. She thinks our first “official” date was bowling at Melrose Bowling Lanes and then Zanies Comedy Club. Either way, I remember trying to beat her at both bowling and squash.

Will Hughes, MBA’02

He cleaned his car for me—misleading me into thinking he was a neat person!

Kate Reid Laing, MBA’01

I remember thinking he had to come from a good family because his mom had sent him back to school with a cooler full of frozen homegrown field peas and cream-style corn. I found that very attractive.

Ashley McDonnell Lane, MBA’03

We met on the first day of class while approaching the school. She asked me for directions even though a large sign saying “Welcome Owen Students” was clearly visible. After a keg reception for new students, I invited her to Rotier’s for a hamburger. We didn’t date again for six months.

Michael P. Peck, JD’81, MBA’81

I cooked dinner for him, and it turned out all wrong. He was a much better cook (still is!) and was very gracious during that first date. He helped me figure out how to fix the dinner, and that began the relationship we have today!

Carolyn Bowman Pugh, MBA’85

Everything. Sam Shepard’s Fool for Love. Dinner at a Chinese restaurant. That there would be a second date.

Bobby Rouse Jr., MBA’86

Eating dinner while sitting on the floor. It was my first time at a traditional Thai restaurant, and although the food was amazing, getting up and down from my seat wasn’t the most graceful thing I’ve done.

Ashley Wright Scharpf, MBA’97

We went to the Italian Street Fair in Nashville, and the thing I remember is riding these swings that we now refer to as the “kick booty ride.” The idea was that you’d push the people in front of you with your legs so that they’d fly faster and higher. We went on that ride several times, and we’ve been kicking each other’s booty ever since.

Donna Zavada Wilkinson, MBA’93

Talking about how excited we were to start business school and feeling like we had so much in common right away.

Kimberly Achziger Yoo, MBA’99

WHAT DO YOU ADMIRE MOST ABOUT YOUR SPOUSE?

Her dad said it best at our rehearsal dinner: “When she’s around, everything is more fun.”

Mike Dorr, BS’99, MBA’05

His intelligence.

Kathy Dillard Dorr, MBA’05

His perseverance, humor and kindness.

Leslie Talmadge Ellwood, MBA’98

Her attention to detail (which incidentally is also my biggest pet peeve about her).

Brent Guinn, MBA’01

Her absolute devotion to those she loves and to the interests she pursues.

Chris Jones, MBA’87

He is loving, intelligent, funny, and a great father to our children.

Pamela Dokecki Landes, BS’89, MBA’90

I admire David’s sense of humor even during times of tremendous stress. I also admire what a loving and affectionate father he is to our two boys, Jameson and Payton.

Mindy Sauers McGrath, MBA’97

Helen has maintained independence and achieved success without making some of the sacrifices that many career women have to make. She does it with enormous energy and a tremendous heart.

Keith Hampton Parsons, BS’79, MBA’85

His ability to listen and provide sound, encouraging advice.

Helen McCormick Parsons, MBA’84

Stephanie’s ability to connect with all sorts of people.

Steve Pendray, MBA’04

Steve’s utter confidence in me: letting me do my own thing and have an individual personality and life, as well as our life together.

Stephanie Warren Pendray, MBA’03

Besides her beauty, I would say communication skills. Elaine speaks English better than most Americans even though she has only been in the United States since 2002. Elaine is a native Chinese speaker.

Jonathan Weindruch, BA’98, MBA’04

WHAT’S YOUR BIGGEST PET PEEVE ABOUT YOUR SPOUSE?

She drapes things on door knobs. Who knew they could be used as hangers for clothes and purses?!

James Wade Brunstad, MMgt’75

His frustrations with his golf game.

Margaret Hayes Brunstad, MMgt’75

She doesn’t always wear matching socks.

Krunch Kloberdanz, BS’97, MBA’03

His nightly habit of leaving jugs of Pace picante sauce and bags of chips opened around the house!

Courtney Brakebill Kloberdanz, BS’98, MBA’03

Who needs Wikipedia? He knows everything.

Marian Eichelman Matthis, EMBA’92

Unrealistic standards of cleanliness.

Thomas McDaniel, MBA’02

Inability to keep the house neat.

Kristen Ruggles McDaniel, MBA’02

She keeps bothering me about getting a pet.

Robert J. Misey Jr., JD’87, MBA’87

My only pet peeve is that we don’t have a pet!

Monica Vaeth Misey, MBA’88

Is this a Cosmo survey?

Neil Stevens Rankin, MBA’00

He has an MBA yet doesn’t know how to make a five-year-old’s lunch.

Lauren Girard Rankin, MBA’00

He hardly ever closes doors after opening them—closet doors, cabinet doors, etc. A friend suggested that the next time he drops me off to park the car that I just get out and walk away without closing the car door. I have yet to do that. I just can’t.

Clara Proctor Sohan, MBA’00

WHO HAS BETTER BUSINESS SENSE, YOU OR YOUR SPOUSE?

She does, but she would never admit to it.

Phil Day, MBA’92

He thinks he does, but I believe that I do, at least with big decisions. He is great at making everyday decisions, and I am better at making the once-in-a-while big decisions in life.

Paulee Coughlin Day, BA’90, MBA’92

It’s not a matter of being better. It’s a matter of being different. He’s an EVP of Finance for Sovereign Bank, so he’s very concerned with the bottom line. I’m in market research and am much more concerned about evaluating and predicting marketplace behavior.

Patty Silvester Dew, MBA’84

I am a better salesperson, but Kevin is much stronger at looking at the bigger picture.

Christina Kennedy Hause, MBA’93

Bruce is a great strategic and long-term thinker and delegator. I’m hands-on and very thorough and organized. We are both good motivators of people.

Vicki Simons Heyman, BA’79, MBA’80

We both are good, but he is the only one who reads the small print.

Elena Karoulina de Leon, MBA’99

I am the bigger risk taker, and I have a better gut feel for business opportunities. That said, she has more sense.

Wade Lee, MBA’84

I do about most things except people. She can read people better than I can.

Jack Long, MBA’83

Definitely him because I’ve forgotten too much! As a homemaker and volunteer, I’m probably more organized, but he’s the true business genius.

Carolyn Adams Long, MBA’83

This will sound WAY too politically correct, but I think we are each strong in different areas. We capitalize on this diversity and frequently bounce ideas off of one another.

Rick Marsh, EMBA’06

This one is tough. We have such different strengths. I love being able to come home from work and ask his advice since he has a different perspective and great business sense.

Heather Vaughn Marsh, MBA’05

Me, but it hasn’t been tested for a while unless you count negotiating with teenagers.

Jacki Voyles Tengi, BA’88, MBA’90

______________________________________________

IF YOUR SPOUSE HAD TO CHOOSE ANOTHER LINE OF WORK, WHAT WOULD HE/SHE BE BEST SUITED FOR?

Graphic design. He loves to tinker on the computer and has a creative side.

Lesley Harper Bartley, MBA’05

Although Steve has had a very successful career in commercial real estate, he would be a great high school football coach.

Cara Lilly Belcher, BE’83, MBA’86

Interestingly he gravitates toward medical topics. I think that he would have made a great doctor.

Cindy McCallen Cassity, BA’90, MBA’94

Matt is a great philosopher and has a gift for sales. Not sure what that qualifies him to do in his next career. Perhaps tourist vacations with the Dalai Lama? Seriously, he loves investing. Maybe a money manager?

Karla Newburger Diehl, MBA’87

Music teacher.

Quentin Hicks, MBA’04

Quen’s dream is to open a restaurant one day. He is a grilling and cooking aficionado. I bet he could beat Bobby Flay at a barbeque cook-off any day of the year.

Shanon Gutierrez Hicks, MBA’04

Motivational speaker or career coach.

T.A. Iadevaia, MBA’91

Building houses for Habitat for Humanity.

Kim Weaver Iadevaia, MBA’92

I am firmly convinced that my wife could be the best teacher in the world. I watch her with our children, and I am amazed.

Craig Montgomery, MBA’00

I think he would be a terrific mentor of some sort. Over the years I have consistently been amazed at the number of colleagues, employees and friends who have sought out Craig’s guidance on career and other business decisions.

Whitney Malocha Montgomery, MBA’00

Hostage negotiations working for the SWAT team. She would drive any hostage-taker to tears of frustration with her relentless persistence and Vulcan-like logic. The hostage-taker would clearly see the futility of the situation and surrender without violence.

Stein Soelberg, MBA’97
