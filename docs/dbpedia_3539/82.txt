Hawking at an event in 2013

Stephen Hawking is the hero of the new movie The Theory of Everything, but he dreams of being a villain. The famous physicist, who is portrayed by Eddie Redmayne in the new biopic, recently told Wired that he would love to make an appearance in a James Bond film. “My ideal role would be a baddie in James Bond,” said Hawking (via The Hollywood Reporter). “I think the wheelchair and the computer voice would fit the part.”

As chronicled in The Theory of Everything, Hawking was diagnosed with a form of ALS at 21 years old, and has coped with the loss of his voice and motor functions by using a wheelchair and communicating with a computer. One of the world’s greatest thinkers, Hawking is also a recognizable presence in pop culture, having played himself on Star Trek: The Next Generation and The Simpsons. If the scientist is serious about adding a James Bond cameo to his résumé, now might be a good time: the upcoming Bond 24 is reportedly seeking a return to “classic” Bond villains in the vein of ’70s henchman Jaws (played by the late Richard Kiel).

Nothing says “classic Bond” like an evil genius in a big chair. Bond’s most notorious villain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, concocted his deadly schemes in seven Bond films, usually while seated in a black chair with a cat in his lap. (Coincidentally, one of those diabolical chairs will be going up for auction this weekend along with some other big-ticket Bond memorabilia.) A baddie who strongly resembled an injured Blofeld even attempted to kill Bond from a wheelchair using a remote-controlled helicopter in For Yours Eyes Only (watch below). We’ve no doubt Hawking would’ve pulled off the scheme with more finesse.
