        "text": "Synopsis\n\nBased on the book written by his wife, this moving drama tells the story of renowned British scientist Stephen Hawking. Following his life from his days as a dazzling young Cambridge student to his present status as a global icon, the film takes in some of his startling early theories as well as his devastating diagnosis of motor neuron disease aged 21. Perhaps less familiar, the film also focuses in large part on Hawkingâ€™s domestic life, in particular his long and at times challenging marriage to Jane. Remarkable performances from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones bring a moving sense of realism to an exceptional story."
