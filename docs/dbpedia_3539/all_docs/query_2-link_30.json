        "text": "Stephen and Jane met each other for the first time at a May ball in Cambridge. Stephen was initially timid and awkward, but he gradually overcame his shyness and became comfortable around Jane. They both fell in love with each other after their first meeting. However, after some days, Stephen was diagnosed with a deadly motor neuron disease, which reduced his life span. He only had two years to live. Stephen was shattered when he learned about his disease.\n\nNonetheless, during those tough times, Stephen found Jane beside him. Jane was so in love with Stephen that she married him despite being aware of his illness. However, after the marriage, Stephen’s health started to deteriorate. Over time, he loses his ability to walk, speak, and write. These struggles and hardships affected their relationship. Despite all the difficulties, Jane was always there for Stephen. She never left his side. She went above and beyond to help Stephen. “The Theory of Everything” perfectly portrays the unique relationship between Stephen and Jane. Another portion of the movie shows Stephen’s strong personality. Stephen was so cheerful and robust that despite having such disabilities, he never gave up. He had a strong desire to live and work. He faced all the challenging situations bravely. He gradually learned to communicate with the help of a speech-generating device. He had such a strong passion for science that he never stopped his research. He continued to explore the universe at the beginning of time and researched spacetime singularities. Jane and his Ph.D. supervisor, Dennis, strongly supported him. After days of hard work, he proved his theory regarding black holes. After that, he penned a book called “A Brief History of Time,” where many exciting topics such as the Big Bang, black holes, and light cones were discussed. The topic and theme of the book were so interesting that the book became famous worldwide, and since then, everybody has recognized him as one of the greatest physicists for his theory.\n\nThis film is about life, hopes, love, and science. This film’s graphics and message are both enthralling. The film is even more interesting because actual physicist Stephen Hawking saw it. He also offered his voice in it, which gave the movie a lift. Therefore, because of the mesmerizing plot, fantastic cinematography, and beautiful messages, I highly recommend this movie.\n\n“There should be no boundaries to human endeavor. We are all different.\n\nHowever bad life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.\n\nWhile there is life, there is hope.”\n\n- Stephen Hawking (The Theory of Everything)\n\nFilm Credit"
