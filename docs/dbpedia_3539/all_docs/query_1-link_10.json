I disagree. He wanted to work in astrophysics from the beginning. Why should he be expected to give that up? His intelligence is in a grasp of math and physics and not necessarily applicable to medical research. I loved nursing but if anyone had told me I had to change my emphasis to medical research I would have been horrified. I hated the slow pace, the paperwork, the publish or perish requirements of research. As for doing more to raise awareness of ALS, there are only two names that the public associates with ALS; Lou Gerig and Stephen Hawking, and people today know more about the life and work and success and challenges Hawking faced.\n\ndkcarl62\n\nDistinguished member\n\nJoined\n\nNov 12, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n220\n\nReason\n\nDX UMND/PLS\n\nDiagnosis\n\n03/2015\n\nCountry\n\nUS\n\nState\n\nmi\n\nCity\n\nNovi\n\nNov 21, 2014\n\n#7\n\nWe saw the movie \"Hawking\" (2013) on Netflix streaming.
