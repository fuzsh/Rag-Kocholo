        "text": "Thumbnail: It's a well-acted and entertaining biopic that overcomes its contrivances thanks to an uncommon amount of empathy for its female co-star.\n\nThe Box Office:\n\nThe Theory of Everything will be debuting this Friday on five screens courtesy of Focus Features (I'm using the UK poster for this review because I frankly prefer it to the American poster art). Barring unknown variables, it will expand wider throughout the month. The film comes courtesy of Working Title Films and will be distributed overseas by Universal ( Comcast Corp.). I don't have an exact production budget, but I'll takeVariety's word that it's under $15 million. So yes, like a lot of films dropping around the next few months that aren't The HungerGames: Catching Fire part I or The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, this is another character drama that has much of its would-be box office glory beyond LA/NY success pinned on Oscar hopes.\n\nAnd like a lot of would-be Oscar movies, the campaign is less likely to be focused on the overall film itself but instead one or two components. In this case, it's the lead actors, Eddie Redmayne as Dr. Stephen Hawking and Felicity Jones as his wife (now ex-wife) Jane Hawking. Mr. Redmayne, who came close to stealing the third act of Les Miserables fromHugh Jackman back in 2012, has been getting plenty of media attention for his portrayal of the famed scientist both in his younger/healthier days and through the various stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as ALS or \"Lou Gehrig's disease.\" It's a cliché to say that playing a severely mentally or physically disabled person can be an easy ticket to an Oscar nomination and/or Oscar victory, but in a season less gripped in Michael Keaton fever, Redmayne would probably be the front-runner even if he weren't superb in the film (note: he is terrific).\n\nThe other major contender in the film is Felicity Jones. She came to prominence back in 2011 in Crazy Love as a would-be new face to watch but since then hasn't done anything more high-profile than a glorified cameo in Amazing Spider-Man 2 which may or may not lead to her playing Black Cat in a spin-off/sequel/etc. That's not an insult, as she's made a number of below-the-radar films (Hysteria is awfully good, especially in light of current political circumstances), but this is her first shot at real mainstream exposure. Susan Wloszczyna already wrotea superb piece last week about how often the Academy awards actresses who basically do the whole \"stand by your man\" bit, and this is a pretty clear example of just that. That the film is based on Ms. Hawking's memoirs and gives her more sympathy than usual for these kind of stories makes Jones an even more formidable contender if the film clicks outside of the big cities over the next few months. Of course, again it helps that she is quite good in the film.\n\nThe Review:\n\nAt a glance, The Theory of Everything is a mix of two things of which I'm not generally a fan, the \"great man and the good woman by his side\" drama and the \"great accomplishments aren't as important as having a family or kicking a bad habit\" narrative. That it works despite my misgivings about the subject matter is a testament to its strong performances and a real sense of empathy toward both sides of the featured relationship. I don't pretend to presume everything that is presented in this \"based on a true story\" film actually occurred as such in real life. So for the record I am treating this film as an \"Elseworld\" so as to not have to spend the entire review pointing out the things that did or did not happen as presented. But the film, as is, represents something of an anomaly, as it's basically a look at a \"great man\" and his supportive wife with far more empathy than per-usual offered to said long-suffering spouse.\n\nThe film doesn't really pretend to be all that concerned with the scientific works of Dr. Stephen Hawking, and what scientific sequences there are mostly consist of Dr. Hawking giving a speech and being applauded while those around him conclude (presumably correctly) that he is a genius. While, for example, A Beautiful Mind at least made an effort to present its core scientific \"game theory\" in a way for general audiences to grasp, here Dr. Hawking's scientific pursuits are almost beside the point. This is first-and-foremost a story about a preternaturally gifted young man crippled by a devastating disease (ALS) and the young woman who goes from supportive girlfriend to loving wife to understandably aggravated caretaker. Like Good Will Hunting, the fact that its main character is a genius is basically seasoning sprinkled onto the core story being told. The film, directed by James Marsh and written by Anthony McCarten, is at its best when it stares unblinkingly at the cruel fate afforded the young Ms. Hawkins . To be frank, Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne don't have much chemistry in their initial scenes, and little reason is presented as to why these two young academics fall for each other beside the fact that they are both beautiful-looking creatures. The film improves as Stephen Hawking's condition worsens, as we see the sad irony of a stunningly brilliant mind betrayed by an uncommonly imperfect body. Redmayne is terrific even before he gets the showy physical acting challenges of portraying Dr. Hawking painfully climbing up a flight of stairs with his hands or struggling to speak via a computer. Felicity Jones is quite good here too, and the film truly excels by presenting a more sympathetic portrait of a potentially famous/important woman who is perhaps doomed, paraphrasing Nicole Kidman in Hemingway & Gelhorn, to become a footnote in a great man's life.\n\nThis is the rare \"stand by your man\" drama where you're all-but-actively rooting for the female half of the equation to actually commit adultery. Aside from the \"Dr. Hawking rises up the scientific ranks\" material, the film's emphasis, especially in its latter half, is on the unusual relationship between the Hawking family and a music teacher (Charlie Cox) that becomes a friend and caretaker to the family and obvious would-be love interest to Jane. The film doesn't shy away from the notion that Jane had basically put her own life on hold and the film implicitly asks if Jane perhaps would have made the same decision to stay with Stephen post-diagnosis if she knew he would live far beyond the initial prognosis of two years. Obviously these are troubling concepts and the film at-best skirts around them, but the fact that it doesn't paint an overtly rosy picture on an unfortunate situation earns token admiration.\n\nAgain, the key to the film's success is equal-party empathy. You'll surely empathize with Stephen Hawking as his body so brutally betrays him, but you'll also mourn for what could have been in Jane's life as well. I wish the film gave really any thoughts at all to how the kids coped with their dad's illness, as the younger family members barely register. I could carp that the real story is more complicated and arguably less-satisfying than what is presented onscreen, but again I am judging the film as if it were total fiction and its impact as a fictional motion picture with some non-fiction names attached. Again, as is often the case when discussing year-end Oscar contenders, I can proclaim that the film isn't quite \"best film of the year\" material while also admitting that it is a mostly satisfying emotional melodrama.\n\nThe Theory of Everything is a most enjoyable and well-acted drama that places an emphasis on family relations rather than the science that made its core couple world-famous. I could argue that in itself is a flaw, but instead I'll merely take the film as it is."
