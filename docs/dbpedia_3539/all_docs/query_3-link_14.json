        "text": "Here is the sad and frustrating irony of “The Theory of Everything”: it’s a biopic about one of\n\nthe most brilliant people in the history of the planet, the renowned astrophysicist\n\nStephen Hawking – a man famous for thinking in boldly innovative ways – yet his\n\nstory is told in the safest and most conventional method imaginable.\n\nThis is ironic given the director: James Marsh, an Academy Award winner for the 2008 documentary “Man\n\non Wire,” which was so thrilling and so clever in its narrative structure that\n\nit made you leave the theater feeling as if you’d actually witnessed Philippe\n\nPetit walking across a tightrope between the World Trade Center Towers. (You\n\ndidn’t – the film features photographs and reenactments but no film footage of\n\nPetit pulling off his daredevil stunt. That’s how persuasive Marsh can be.)\n\nHere, he’s made a strongly acted,\n\nhandsomely crafted film that nonetheless feels bland and unsatisfying. It falls into the trap that so many biopics do: It\n\nhits all the key moments in the life of the author of “A Brief History of Time”\n\nand skims the surface of a complicated existence without digging deeper,\n\nwithout taking chances. Everyone involved does everything they should, and the\n\nresult is just sort of … fine.\n\nOf course, Hawking’s story is\n\ninspiring – the way he’s battled motor neuron disease over the past 50 years\n\nand defied the odds not only to survive, but thrive. And in playing Hawking,\n\nEddie Redmayne more than rises to the challenge of portraying the man’s gradual physical deterioration but also conveying the spark of mental acuity\n\nthat has remained, and marked all of Hawking’s important work. Nothing the\n\n32-year-old actor has done previously (“Les Miserables,” “My Week With\n\nMarilyn”) suggested he had this sort of complexity in him. It’s an impressive\n\nperformance, so much so that it makes you wish it were in the service of\n\nstronger material.\n\n“The Theory of Everything” comes\n\nfrom screenwriter Anthony McCarten, based on “Travelling to Infinity: My Life\n\nWith Stephen,” the memoir by Hawking’s first wife, Jane. A general feeling of\n\ntastefulness permeates the proceedings, as if everyone wanted to be overly\n\nrespectful toward these people, and their life, and the access they provided,\n\nat the expense of revelations that might have seemed inappropriate or startling or, heaven forbid, thought-provoking.\n\nThe love and support we see from\n\nJane Hawking are tireless; as portrayed by a fresh-faced Felicity Jones, Jane\n\nis a woman of both grace and strength. And what she went through in taking care\n\nof him while raising their three children and trying to focus on her own\n\nintellectual pursuits must have been exhausting, and often\n\ndiscouraging. It must have threatened to swallow her whole. We see very little\n\nof that here. This Jane is a saint.\n\nBut the early scenes between\n\nRedmayne and Jones positively crackle. There’s an instant connection when they\n\nspy each other across a crowded room at a party at Cambridge in 1963. He’s\n\nfumbling and funny, she’s pretty and perky. He’s studying cosmology, she’s\n\nstudying medieval Spanish poetry. He’s an atheist, she’s a devout follower of\n\nthe Church of England. But they’re mutually curious and seem to bring out the\n\nbest in one another. Their preliminary days include a romantic scene involving the little-known properties of Tide laundry detergent.\n\nEverything seems possible for\n\nthese two young and brilliant minds, until Hawking experiences a series of\n\nincreasingly clumsy moments, followed by a serious spill on the campus\n\ncourtyard. Then comes the diagnosis at age 21 that he has motor neuron disease,\n\nor ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. The doctor also gives him just\n\ntwo years to live. Hawking tries to withdraw but Jane won’t have it; she forces\n\nher way into his life and insists she’s ready for whatever comes their way.\n\nThey quickly marry, and eventually have three children.\n\nBut as Stephen’s body weakens and\n\nthe family has to make continual adjustments to his physical status – including\n\nthe famous computerized voice he creates when he no longer can speak, which is\n\nthe source of some of the film’s precious few laughs – his mind stays sharp. He\n\ncontinues his pursuit of the one simple, elegant equation that will explain\n\neverything in the universe. (And it should be noted that “The Theory of\n\nEverything” is one of three films opening this week in which black holes figure\n\nprominently, alongside “Interstellar” and “Big Hero 6.”) Not unlike our own\n\ndear Roger Ebert, Hawking’s mind became even more expansive and powerful once\n\nhe began losing his physical abilities.\n\nEventually, “The Theory of\n\nEverything” reaches a point where it toys with a challenging notion: the\n\npossibility that Jane and Hawking each had dalliances on the side with the\n\nother’s tacit approval, once it became clear that their marriage had changed\n\nirreparably. Jane sought solace with Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox), the\n\nhunky, widowed choir director with big, brown puppy-dog eyes who served as\n\nHawking’s caretaker, and the family’s de facto husband and father figure. Hawking\n\nlater had the pleasure of spending time with the beautiful and vibrant\n\ntherapist Elaine (a charismatic Maxine Peake), who flirted with Stephen and\n\neven leafed through the pages of a Penthouse magazine for his perusal."
