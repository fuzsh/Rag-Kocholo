        "text": "Stephen Hawking only appeared once on the set of his 2014 biopic, The Theory of Everything, but it was suitably terrifying for everyone involved. Here was the world’s greatest living scientist, watching actor Eddie Redmayne play a young and able-bodied version of himself. To make the situation even more intense, the film had only just started production.\n\n“It was a real worry,” director James Marsh tells me. “It was the second or third day of filming and we were putting on a May Ball in Cambridge, for the early part of the film. I think for Eddie it was a particularly challenging day – he’s there being watched by the person he plays. And in that part of the story he’s playing a young, vigorous Stephen Hawking, which must have been strange for Stephen to see as well, I think.\n\n“But I think he was suitably impressed by the scale of what we were doing, and the tone of what we were doing. And he had some champagne – he liked a drink, as everyone knows, and who could blame him for that?”\n\nHawking, who has died at the age of 76, was famed for his scientific breakthroughs, but was long reluctant to have his own life story dramatised. It had been told more generally before, both in Errol Morris’s 1992 documentary A Brief History of Time and in the BBC drama Hawking, starring a young Benedict Cumberbatch, but The Theory of Everything was the first to explore the dysfunctional marriage and personal life that existed alongside his work.\n\nIt further dramatises the breakdown of their marriage, with Wilde struggling with depression and Hawking conducting an emotional affair with his nurse, who he later marries following his separation from Wilde.\n\nBecause of its intimate retelling of personal wounds, Jane Wilde was reluctant to sell the movie rights to her book, leading screenwriter Anthony McCarten to repeatedly petition her for close to a decade, so moved by her writing that he was desperate to adapt it for film. Wilde gradually softened to McCarten’s eagerness, helping him with script notes and revisions, and eventually giving her blessing after years of exchanges.\n\n“It wasn’t like she was making sure the script was the one she wanted,” McCarten told the Hollywood Reporter. “It was more like she was growing into a place where she was comfortable with anyone making a film about her.”\n\nMarsh, best known for his Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire, sparked to the idea of a biopic told from the perspective of Hawking’s wife, and was also intrigued to explore an aspect of the man’s life that few knew about, including himself.\n\nBritish actor Eddie Redmayne, then fresh from Les Misérables, was cast as Hawking. Marsh was initially unsure if Redmayne could convincingly alter his physicality for the role, but was encouraged to watch a little-seen indie he had made years prior called The Yellow Handkerchief, in which Redmayne played a character with an unusual gait. Impressed, Marsh gave him the job.\n\nIn the months prior to filming, Redmayne got to work studying Hawking’s research and his personal history, along with his physicality, which would change throughout the film – The Theory of Everything takes place over several decades. He also met numerous individuals with motor neurone disease, honing both the psychological and physical aspects of the struggle, and worked with a choreographer, Alex Reynolds, to enhance his physical movements.\n\nTogether the pair took over a car park opposite Redmayne’s London flat, where they would work on muscle training and practice Hawking’s physicality at different points over the course of the film.\n\n“When I hired the choreographer, I told her I wanted to spend enough time in these positions that my body started relaxing in them,” Redmayne told Deadline. “She suggested that I see an osteopath. This osteopath basically mapped my body during rehearsal, every two days, and it was amazing. She said the shape of your body starts changing, especially by being in the position that Stephen is in, which specialists call “windswept,” this sort of S-shaped thing. But also my face was affected because Stephen speaks out of the side of his face a lot. The makeup designer was like, ‘You’re growing muscles in the side of your face.’\n\nHe continued, “I would have to stay in the same position between takes, and that’s why I had to trust so much in this team of people, in particular James, behind the camera, because I couldn’t see what I looked like. There was a bit of a physical cost, but the reality is that every day I got to get out of my wheelchair. The 30 or 40 people with ALS that I met, a lot of them didn’t.”\n\nRedmayne spent five months in total researching Hawking and developing his performance before actually meeting the man himself just days before filming began, time finally opening up in Hawking’s busy schedule.\n\n“When I met Stephen, it was this astounding moment with this man who’d become an idol in my mind,” Redmayne said. “I actually had feared, ‘What if this man ends up in reality being nothing like what I predicted?’ Fortunately, in that meeting, he just emanated humor and wit and a joy of life. It became absolutely clear in meeting him that the illness is secondary.”\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo, Redmayne recalled that even at that late point in his process, he significantly altered his performance at Hawking’s suggestion.\n\n“Stephen asked me if I was playing him before the voice machine, and when I said yes, he said, ‘My voice was very slurred,’” Redmayne said. “At that time, the producers were a bit scared of getting to a place of incomprehensibility, because they didn’t want subtitles. But when Stephen said that, it re-invigorated me to go back and say ‘Look, we have to be true to what this disease is.’”\n\n“I did things to change the scale of Eddie’s face,” Sewell told IndieWire. “He wore ear clips that pushed out his ears. And then, as I started to put in different mouth pieces to slowly start to change his mouth, I changed his ears by adding little earlobes on to slightly change the scale of his face. I made prosthetic knee and hand pieces to make them look bonier. When we put the prosthetics on for the last time, for the last look, it gave the effect that he had shrunk because everything else had grown.”\n\nRedmayne’s performance would go onto win him an Oscar, while Jones, McCarten and composer Jóhann Jóhannsson, who died last month, received nominations. The film was also nominated for Best Picture. Some critics, however, argued that the film did not entirely depict some of the harsher difficulties of Hawking and Wilde’s marriage, or Hawking’s occasional ill-treatment of his wife, with The Guardian calling it “dishonest”.\n\nHawking was screened the near-completed film shortly after production had finished, with Marsh in particular anxious about recieving his approval. Hawking and his team came to the head offices of production company Working Title towards the end of 2014 and watched thoughtfully.\n\n“We had to wait a long period of time for him to give us his views,” Marsh remembers. “His communication device was quite slow, and you had to wait 10/15 minutes to get an answer from him. It was a very long 10 minutes, I can tell you, because his endorsement of the film was so vital.\n\n“So we waited and waited and waited, and you just fill that time with your own idle babble, essentially in front of the world’s smartest man. But eventually he was able to tell us the film was ‘broadly true’. He tolerated it going in, thinking ‘Oh, this is going to happen anyway’, but I think he was surprised and pleased with the results.\n\n“Later on he had a very good way of explaining his view, which was that, ‘It was all true, but not all of it happened.’ Which is what any biopic strives for, in a way. Something that tells the truth of something, if you embellish lots of details and leave lots of things out.”\n\nAs a further gesture of goodwill towards the production, Hawking gave Marsh and his crew access to his speech-generating device, guaranteeing perfect authenticity when it came to his famed digitised voice.\n\n“We created our own version of his voice, which was to our ears at least fairly accurate, but wasn’t his voice,” Marsh says. “So he volunteered to just give us his voice, and we were able to access his app on his computer. That was a real gift he gave us. It changed the film in such an interesting way, too. It was more emotional somehow to have his real voice in it.”\n\nHe adds, “Stephen understood that his life story was the stuff of myth, of narrative, and he got all that. He wasn’t shy about knowing that. I think it was a better film in that he was around to see it and to endorse it, essentially. We had to reckon with that and we thankfully passed the test. I’m very glad that he was able to be a part of it as he was.”\n\nAs for Hawking’s own thoughts on the film, he wrote on Facebook in 2014 that it had particularly moved him, and made him appreciate both his professional accomplishments and the many individuals to surround him along the way.\n\n“Seeing the film has given me the opportunity to reflect on my life,” he wrote. “Although I’m severely disabled, I have been successful in my scientific work. I travel widely and have been to Antarctica and Easter Island, down in a submarine and up on a zero gravity flight. One day I hope to go into space. I’ve been privileged to gain some understanding of the way the universe operates through my work. But it would be an empty universe indeed without the people that I love.”"
