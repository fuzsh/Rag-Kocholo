        "text": "Eddie Redmayne greets the famed physicist Stephen Hawking on the set of his new film Theory of Everything on Friday (September 27) in the Cambridge area of London, England.\n\nThe 31-year-old actor plays a young Stephen in the film, which explores the time when he was in his first year of graduate studies at Cambridge and got diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease. After falling into a deep depression and abandoning his work, Stephen fell in love with fellow student Jane Wilde and she left her studies to marry him and serve as his helpmate."
