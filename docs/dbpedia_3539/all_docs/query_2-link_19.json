        "text": "James Marsh, the British director of documentaries Man on Wire and Project Nim and a third of the very dark Red Riding TV trilogy, here turns in an accomplished but conventional biopic of Professor Stephen Hawking. Literately scripted by Anthony McCarten from the memoir by the subject’s ex-wife, Jane Hawking, the film follows the physicist from carefree cycling days in Cambridge, through the onset of motor neurone disease, to A Brief History of Time and the advent of the world’s most recognised electronic voice. It feels churlish to complain that the film is uncritical; we’re talking about one of the transcendent intellects of our age, so what’s to criticise? But this Working Title production is somewhat fuzzily life-affirming, and you wonder whether Hawking in his youth was quite as irrepressibly impish as Eddie Redmayne makes him here.\n\nEssentially an intimate marital drama rather than a career story, the film sometimes plays its ironies a little knowingly – at one point young Stephen shrugs that he has “no ideas”, whereas we all think of Hawking as idea incarnate. Redmayne’s quietly exuberant performance is admirable and engaging, never over-stressing its tour de force dimension. But the real colour is brought by Felicity Jones as Jane – crisp, sensitive, down-to-earth in a very suburban way. Marsh’s talent at creating vivid, textured images, with Benoît Delhomme behind the camera, brings an extra resonance, although (the odd illustrative effect notwithstanding) you don’t get that much sense of what Hawking’s achievement means. Not so much The Theory of Everything as everything but the theory."
