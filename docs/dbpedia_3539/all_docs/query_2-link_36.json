        "text": "I like Stephen Hawking, and appreciate his challenges in life and his contributions to physics, but really not any more than the other physics hero's of mine, that includes the old school crew we all know and love, and even some of the contemporary \"pop\" physicists. However, I know more about Stephen Hawking personal life than all of the others combined, and I didn't even seek to do so. It's just like you can't avoid it. I got enough of it from the dozens of documentaries he's been featured in even before the major twin TV series he hosted, \"Grand Design\" and \"Into the Universe.\"\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2203380/\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1655078/\n\nThose were Ok, but nothing stellar in my opinion (pardon the pun).\n\nNow we've got a major motion picture coming out about him, \"Theory of everything?\" Again? What about the film \"Hawking\" in 2004? Didn't that tell already the whole story? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(2004_film)\n\nThere was even another major film bio done on him last year with same title: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_(2013_film)\n\nAm I the only one that has had just about enough of this Hawking hero worship? I mean, we got the point already Stephen. How about we embrace a little humility and spend less time making feature films about ourselves and more time doing good physics?\n\nbilly_joule said:\n\nI think any celebration of Scientists in mainstream media is a good thing. For many viewers it'll be some of their only exposure to the world of science, however sensationalised/dramatised it is.\n\nWell, celebration is one thing, overdoing it is another. I'm not saying I don't think Hawkings' story isn't a fascinating or relevant one, I just don't think all this hoopla is going to be great for his legacy. I think it actually may have the opposite intended effect. Look at Feynman. Certainly he didn't face the challenges that Hawking has had and still does, but he had some serious unforseen health issues for the greater part of a decade before he died and did the best he could to stay out of the limelight (as far as I'm aware). He was more interested in letting his science speak for itself in terms of his legacy, and I think that paid off. He was reluctant even to receive the Nobel prize and all the fanfare that surrounded that, and would rather have not received it. I can't imagine him feeling comfortable with the attention Hawking gets and having multiple feature films made about him. I think this goes for Einstein as well, although he did want the Nobel prize (only to pay of Mileva and get her out of his hair, though :p)\n\nDataGG said:\n\nI agree with this.. This year is the year of 3 very interesting science-related movies: Stephen Hawking's, Alan Turing's and Interstellar... I wonder how that will affect the interest for science (physics and math mainly) courses..\n\nI don't know if I do agree with this. It is an interesting question, kind of a nature versus nurture one. I think the average person from the USA at least is exposed to plenty of science from several avenues, school, science channel, NASA, History, etc. from cable, and especially the internet. I'm going more for \"nature.\" If you're scientifically minded, you're going to pick up the bug from one of a number of these varied introductions, and most likely at a young age. I don't think you're going to see waves of adult \"re-entry\" students quitting their day jobs in order to take physics classes at the local community college because they went to see \"Gravity\" or \"Theory of everything.\" That doesn't mean I don't feel that the more science-based movies on the big screen the better, I do, it's just that I don't think that, as Billy_joule said:\n\nbilly_joule said:\n\nFor many viewers it'll be some of their only exposure to the world of science, however sensationalised/dramatised it is.\n\nI think the average person is exposed to quite a bit of science. The exposure is not the problem. It's the interest.\n\nBtw, what is this Alan Turing movie you're talking about? That's kind of my whole point here. I would go see a feature movie on Turing in a heartbeat, because I haven't been saturated with media and documentaries on him. I chose the name DiracPool as my handle a couple years back because I was fortunate enough to stumble upon the book, \"The strangest man\" by Farmello: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0465022103/?tag=pfamazon01-20\n\nPart of the hype behind the book was that it was one of a very few deep looks into this pivotal figure in physics. I'd much rather see a feature film made about him or one of the many other popular media unsung physics giants than another film bio on Hawkings.\n\nEdit: Oh, I almost forgot, if you're going to order the book, do it through PhysicsForums ;)\n\nDiracPool said:\n\nI don't know if I do agree with this.

I don't have a TV but last time I watched it it was full of garbage reality shows, ghost hunting, mermaids, dragons etc\n\nMedia is saturated with absolute rubbish IMO, anything vaguely related to good science is very welcome in my books."
