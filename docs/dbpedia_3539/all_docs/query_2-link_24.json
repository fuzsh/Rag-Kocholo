        "text": "LONDON — Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones have assembled for Oscar winner James Marsh‘s The Theory of Everything, the Universal backed Working Title Films produced movie about celebrated physicist Stephen Hawking.\n\nThe movie, penned by Anthony McCarten and inspired by Jane Hawking’s memoir Travelling to Infinity: My life with Stephen, the movie details the love story between the Cambridge cosmology student and Jane Wilde, the arts student he fell in love with at University in the 1960s.\n\nGiven just two years to live following the diagnosis of a fatal illness at age 21, little was expected from Hawking, a bright but shiftless student. He was galvanized by the love of Wilde and went on to be called the successor to Einstein, as well as a husband and father to their three children. He is still alive today.\n\nProduced by Working Title’s Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner and Lisa Bruce and McCarten, Universal Pictures International (UPI) will distribute the film internationally.\n\nRedmayne (Les Misérables) and Jones (The Invisible Woman) are cast alongside David Thewlis (The Fifth Estate), Emily Watson (Anna Karenina), Charlie Cox (Boardwalk Empire), Simon McBurney (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), Maxine Peake (The Village) and Harry Lloyd (Game of Thrones).\n\nFilming will take place in Cambridge and at other locations in the U.K."
