        "text": "The Theory of Everything isn't the first film about Stephen Hawking, the groundbreaking English cosmologist who was stricken with ALS in 1963, at age 21, and who, despite an initial prognosis of two-and-a-half years to live, has spent the better part of the last half-century confined to a motorized wheelchair and communicating via a computer speech synthesizer. There have been several documentaries about his life and work, beginning with 1991's Errol Morris-directed and Philip Glass-scored A Brief History of Time, titled after the 1988 bestselling book that made Hawking a worldwide celebrity. And in a 2004 BBC movie, Benedict Cumberbatch, in one of his earliest leading roles, portrayed Hawking's time as a Cambridge PhD student, just prior to and in the immediate aftermath of his diagnosis. (That's not to mention the many memorable, typically hilarious cameos Hawking himself has made on TV, in Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Simpsons, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien.) But director James Marsh's new cinematic iteration of Hawking's story out this weekend—based on a memoir by his former wife of 30 years, Jane—might be the most revelatory yet, thanks primarily to Eddie Redmayne's eerie, Oscar-deserving embodiment of Hawking. Here are a few of the most fascinating items from Hawking's biography as depicted in The Theory of Everything, and a couple equally astonishing tidbits that were omitted.\n\nFor a Man Who Doesn't Believe in God, Hawking's Career Seems Preordained\n\nIn one of The Theory of Everything's most touching scenes, Hawking, who has long denied the likelihood of a divine being, finally acknowledges to his then-wife Jane (played by Felicity Jones) that God might very well exist. This past September, at the Starmus astronomy festival in the Canary Islands, Hawking once again refuted the possibility and avowed his atheism. And yet his vocation as a cosmologist certainly seems as if it were prescribed by some higher power. In the Errol Morris documentary, Hawking's mother describes how, just after his birth, she went to a bookstore and bought an astronomical atlas, about which one of her sisters-in-law later remarked, \"This is a very prophetic thing for you to have done.\" And in the same documentary, Hawking points out the rather coincidental timing of his birth: exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo. \"I estimate about 200,000 other babies were also born that day,\" he says. \"I don't know whether any of them was later interested in astronomy.\"\n\nALS Not Only Didn't Hinder Hawking's Intellect—It Helped\n\nThough ALS would decimate Hawking's body—robbing him of the ability to walk, to write and type, and eventually to speak—the disease had the opposite effect on his mind. As one of his colleagues says in the 2013 documentary Hawking: \"As he gradually lost the use of his hands, he further developed his unique ways of thinking, by manipulating shapes and topologies in his head, and became even more advanced than the rest of us. He could move at lightning speed across the frontiers of knowledge and see things that nobody else could see. The disability forced him to carry himself in new ways, new directions.\" Hawking admits as much in the same documentary: \"By losing the finer dexterity of my hands, I was forced to travel through the universe in my mind and try to visualize the ways in which it worked.\" However, just as important as broadening his intellect, ALS strengthened Hawking's concentration. \"He always took a great interest in a lot of things in life,\" his mother says in the Morris documentary, \"and I don't know if he would have applied himself in the same way if he'd been able to get around. I can't think anyone's lucky to have an illness like that, but it's less bad luck for him that it is for some people because he can so much live in his head.\"\n\nHawking Was Interested in Another Big Bang\n\nOne thing ALS didn't rob Hawking of was the ability to get it on. The disease mostly spares the autonomic nervous system, which controls sexual arousal. Stephen and Jane's three children were all conceived after his diagnosis—their youngest a full 15 years after. And as The Theory of Everything humorously divulges, Hawking was no stranger to porno mags. (Penthouse was his preference.)\n\nHawking Basically Wanted to Be Nicholas Sparks...\n\n\"The decline in my health was a stark reminder that time was against me,\" Hawking says in the 2013 documentary. \"Yet despite the pressures on my family, I was determined to realize a lifelong ambition by writing a popular book about how the universe had begun. I wanted the book to be read by millions of people around the world like a bestselling airport novel... I felt sure that the mass market would want to know how the universe began.\" While his publisher was at first just as optimistic—according to the 1992 biography Stephen Hawking: A Life in Science, Bantam purchased the U.S. rights to Hawking's proposal for well over $100,000—his literary agent, Al Zuckerman, was far less so. \"I did not think it would work,\" Zuckerman says in the same documentary. \"If you look at all the other books in airports, there are none like that!\" It took nearly all of 1984 for Hawking to complete a first draft, and a 1986 release was planned. But during a trip to Geneva in the summer of 1985, Hawking contracted a life-threatening case of pneumonia. He only survived thanks to a tracheotomy, though this would claim what little remained of his speech. \"All hopes of finishing my book and perhaps even my career seemed to be over,\" Hawking says. Eventually, he would discover the computer speech synthesizer and get back to work on the manuscript. The revision process was arduous—with Hawking's PhD students at Cambridge relaying his comments by speakerphone to his editor in America and vice versa—and it wasn't until 1988 that the book was ready for stores. By then, though, Hawking's editor had left Bantam, and his replacement scaled back the first printing to a mere 40,000 copies. \"None of us really knew whether the book would be liked and would sell as we all hoped for,\" Hawking says. \"All we could do was give it a title, send it off to the printers, and wait.\" They didn't have to wait long. A Brief History of Time became an instant global sensation, selling more than 10 million copies to date in 40 languages and remaining on bestseller lists for over four years, earning it a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\n...And His Personal Life Is Ripped from a Sparks Novel"
