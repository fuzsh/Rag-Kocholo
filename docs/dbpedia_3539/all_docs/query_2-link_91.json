        "text": "Director: James Marsh; Screenwriters: Anthony McCarten, Jane Hawking; Starring: Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones; Running time: 123 mins; Certificate: PG-13\n\nIn The Theory of Everything, Eddie Redmayne tackles the gargantuan task of playing one of the most - if not the most - famous living scientists in the world: Stephen Hawking. Most of us know Hawking as he is today - the wheelchair-bound genius who communicates via a special speech-generating computer. Here, director James Marsh and writer Anthony McCarten, working from the memoir of Jane Hawking, take us back to the beginning, to the physicist's time as a young man pursuing his PhD at Cambridge.\n\nThis young version of Hawking that we meet is fun-loving, charming, a bit of a lazy student, but every bit the brilliant scientist that we know he will soon flourish into. The film takes time not only to explore the early genesis of some of Hawking's most exciting ideas and theories, especially those stemming from black holes and the beginning of the universe, but also the general decline of his physical health due to the motor neuron disease ALS.\n\nThis isn't a \"biopic\" in the strictest sense of the word, though it hits on all the highlights and seminal moments that those familiar with Hawking's story may come into this expecting. This is, first and foremost, a love story, chronicling the passionate, complicated and touching story of how Hawking and his first wife Jane met and gradually built a life together, adjusting to Hawking's increasing need to rely on her both as lover and caretaker.\n\nFor this film to work, the lovers had to work - thankfully, Redmayne and Jones have an easy, enchanting chemistry, not only at the beginning of the budding romance, but towards its end, as Hawking's health and ego place a strain on the ever-loyal Jane. There are several documentaries and a television movie (starring Benedict Cumberbatch) that may give better insight into Hawking the scientist, but the captivating feature of this film is the humanity Redmayne brings to this incredibly physical and demanding role.\n\nIt's the same appeal that a movie like Shakespeare in Love had, giving the viewer a window into the genius of hugely recognisable figures through a universal and highly accessible concept like love. Throughout the film, Hawking talks about his desire to find the simple, elegant equation for the beginning of the universe and thus everything. In many ways, this film is a kind of simple, elegant equation, a beautifully laid-out record of how Hawking's relationship with Jane was a pivotal and necessary catalyst for everything that came after.\n\n4"
