        "text": "\"Rivington Street was the lively one, eternally jammed with pushcart peddlers hawking their wares. They had every imaginable commodity, from a needle to a wedding outfit... Emotional, tempestuous, harrowing Rivington Street was perpetually a steaming, bubbling pot of human flesh.\"\n\n- D.W. Griffith\n\nVideo: Live Performance at Stockholm JFF 2012\n\nDownloads\n\nBabel on the Hudson: Silent masterworks at the New York Jewish Film Festival The New Yorker (Jan. 19, 2015)\n\nSynopsis\n\nThis short tale of Lower East Side life captures the hustle and bustle of Rivington Street through the lens of legendary Hollywood director D.W. Griffith. After the death of her mother, Ruth struggles to support herself as a seamstress. As she delivers her bundle of shirts to the factory owner, the owner's son steals some money and Ruth is accused of the crime. She then flees the ghetto and hides in the country where a young farmer takes her in and they fall in love.\n\nA Child of the Ghetto was made at the height of Griffith's career at Biograph, a period when he was perfecting the storytelling power of the film medium. Like Romance of a Jewess, this is a story of Lower East Side life, and Griffith again captures in near-documentary style the hustle and bustle of Rivington Street. Griffith's development of editing techniques since 1908 is evident; although both films are about the same length, A Child of the Ghetto has forty-six shots while Romance of a Jewess has only thriteen!\n\nThe movement from city slums to pastoral country differentiates A Child of the Ghetto from most other American Jewish films of this period. The city is seen as a place of hardship, exploitation, and false accusation, while the country offers health, trust, beauty, and love. Griffith seems to indicate that immigrant Jews would improve their lives by moving out of the ghetto, a possibility entertained by few other films. A Child of the Ghetto is also one of the earliest films to treat an interfaith romance unproblematically.\n\nSelected Screenings\n\n4th Jewish Culture Festival - Gdansk, Poland (2016)\n\nMaine Jewish Film Festival/Friends of the Kotzschmar Organ, with live accompaniment (2015)\n\nNew York Jewish Film Festival, with live accompaniment (January 2015)\n\nWorld Premiere of New Digital Restoration NCJF's 17th Annual Film Festival\n\nJewish Museum Prague (2013)\n\nStockholm Jewish Film Festival (2012)\n\nNCJF Digital Film Restoration\n\nSpecial Thanks to Massachusetts Cultural Council, Brandeis University, Stockholm Jewish Film Festival, Dan GrandÃ©r, Tom Gunning\n\n2014 Digital Restoration © The National Center for Jewish Film\n\nExecutive Director Sharon Pucker Rivo\n\nCo-Director Lisa Rivo\n\nTechnical Director Rich Pontius\n\nIntern Sam Bender\n\nFilm Transfer Colorlab\n\nPost Production Modulus Studios\n\nCredits\n\nDirector D.W.
