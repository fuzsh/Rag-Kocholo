        "text": "Following his musical turn in Les Miserables, rising star Eddie Redmayne might be making a run for Oscar. Deadline has word that the British actor has figured out his next project with Theory of Everything, a project that will see him playing Stephen Hawking for Man on Wire and Project Nim director James Marsh. Working Title is behind the film which will focus on the relationship Hawking has with his wife, though it's not clear if that's Jane Wilde, who was married to Hawking from 1965 to 1991, or Elaine Mason, married from 1995 to 2006. However, Redmayne is also being courted for another project.\n\nWhile a female lead is being sought for the Hawking film that would start shooting this fall, director Thomas Vinterberg is also trying to land Redmayne for his film Far from the Madding Crowd. The project would put Redmayne alongside Carey Mulligan and Matthias Schoenaerts, but reportedly, the actor has made Theory of Everything his top priority, likely because the kind of performance needed is more challenging and could really boost his career. Since Hawking doesn't actually speak himself, the role would be akin to something like Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot.\n\nIt's interesting that the film would only focus on Hawking's relations with his wife rather than the rest of his accomplishments, but romance with a man like Hawking has to be complicated and makes for quite the compelling story. The question is who should take on the role of Hawking's wife. Hopefully Marsh can round up another rising young talent for his second non-documentary film following Shadow Dancer with Clive Owen. We'll be keeping our eye on this Hawking project, and look forward to Redmayne's future career."
