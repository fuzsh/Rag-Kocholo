The film is scored by frequent Morris collaborator Philip Glass.\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThis project originated with executive producer Gordon Freedman, who brought it to Anglia Television. After acquiring the property, Freedman met with director Steven Spielberg for advice on how to make the project into a documentary film. Spielberg suggested Errol Morris as director. Morris had studied the history and philosophy of science at Princeton and later Berkeley, so was familiar with many of the topics in Hawking's book. Freedman's production company partnered with Anglia Television and Tokyo Broadcasting. David Hickman, of Anglia, became the film's producer.\n\nMorris only had a few days of access to film and interview Hawking. Because of Hawking's ALS, a disease that progressively affects nerve cells within the spine and brain,[3] Morris filmed various static shots of Hawking, his wheelchair, and the tools he used to communicate, such as his battery-powered computer-based communication system with an electronic voicebox (which was sponsored and provided by Intel Corporation[4]), to later edit together for the video component of Hawking's interview segments in the film.\n\nAlthough Hawking had an aversion to featuring his personal life in the film, Morris saw A Brief History of Time as being as much a biography as a science text, and much of his directing and editing work was dedicated to finding ways to depict ideas from theoretical physics and cosmology and then connect those ideas with details from the life of Hawking. He employed stylized interview sequences, graphic illustrations, and music written by Glass.[5] Morris also included clips from Disney's The Black Hole (1979).\n\nInstead of Morris traveling around and filming the various interview subjects in their native surroundings, all of the interviews for this film were shot on specially built sets on a sound stage in England.[6] Morris said he was \"very moved by Hawking as a man\", calling him \"immensely likable, perverse, funny...and yes, he's a genius.\"[7] He remembers that Hawking had posters of Marilyn Monroe in his office, and one of them fell down while they were filming. \"A fallen woman\", Hawking's speech synthesizer intoned. Hawking's mother, Isobel, is the first person we hear from in the movie, and near the end she describes her son as \"a seeker\" for truth. After the movie premiered, Hawking told Morris, \"Thank you for making my mother a star.\"[8]\n\nList of interviewees\n\n[edit]\n\n(in order of appearance)\n\nIsobel Hawking, Hawking's mother\n\nJanet Humphrey, Hawking's aunt\n\nMary Hawking, Hawking's sister\n\nBasil King, neighbor of the Hawkings\n\nDerek Powney, classmate of Hawking at Oxford\n\nNorman Dix, classmate of Hawking at Oxford\n\nRobert Berman, tutor of Hawking at Oxford\n\nGordon Berry, classmate of Hawking at Oxford\n\nRoger Penrose, mathematical physicist who worked with Hawking on Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems\n\nDennis Sciama, cosmologist and PhD supervisor for Hawking\n\nJohn Wheeler, theoretical physicist who coined the phrase \"black hole\"\n\nBrandon Carter, physicist\n\nJohn Taylor, physicist\n\nKip Thorne, astrophysicist and friend of Hawking\n\nDon Page, theoretical physicist, doctoral student of Hawking\n\nChristopher Isham, physicist\n\nBrian Whitt, physicist and editor of Hawking's A Brief History of Time\n\nRaymond Laflamme, theoretical physicist, doctoral student of Hawking\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe soundtrack for A Brief History of Time was composed by Philip Glass.
