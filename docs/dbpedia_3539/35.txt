World-renowned physicist Stephen Hawking is the subject of new documentary, HAWKING, directed by Stephen Finnigan. Hawking, most famous as the wheelchair-bound physicist with the electronic voice who wrote A Brief History Of Time, is probably the most recognisable scientist of our time. As well as a strong academic career he has also featured in several films and television shows including The Simpsons, and most recently The Big Bang Theory.

In order to make the film, Finnigan was allowed unique access into the private life of Hawking and those closest to him. Stephen Hawking himself narrates the film which charts the scientist’s journey from being an under achiever as a child to the PHD genius we know him as today. The film also delves into his Motor Neuron Disease diagnosis and how he handled being told that he only had two years left to live, over forty years ago.

The first poster has been released today. At first glance (see below) you might be fooled into thinking it’s a poster for a new sci-fi movie and not a documentary:

HAWKING is released in the UK on the 20th September 2013.
