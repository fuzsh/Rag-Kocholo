One way to list and rank prep boarding schools is by size of endowment. I found this list on another website which claims to be the most recent endowment amounts. The top two boarding schools by size of endowment both have over one billion dollars.

Phillips Exeter Academy–$1.150 billion

Phillips Academy at Andover–$1.058 billion

St. Paul’s School–$633 million

Deerfield Academy–$532 m

Hotchkiss School–$487 m

Lawrenceville School–$466 m

Culver Academies–$394 m

Choate Rosemary Hall–$392 m

Groton School–$350 m

Woodbury Forest School–$332 m

Peddie School–$321 m

Milton Academy–$310 m

Mercersburg Academy–$275 m

Middlesex School–$262 m

Taft School–$259 m

Episcopal High School–$230 m

Cranbrook Schools–$217 m

Loomis Chaffee–$203 m

St. Andrew’s School–$195 m

Hill School–$153 m

St. George’s school–$145 m

St. Mark’s School–$141 m

Northfield Mount Herman–$139 m

Thacher School–$137 m

Berkshire–$134 m

Baylor–$130 m

Blair Academy–$101 m

McCallie School–$93 m

Cate School–$90 m

Kent School–$87 m

Concord Academy–$72 m

Brooks School–$71 m

Wyoming Seminary–$60 m

Asheville School–$48 m

Portsmouth Abbey–$48 m

Tabor Academy–$44 m

Millbrook School–$36 m

Fountain Valley School–$38 m

Lawrence Academy–$29 m

Hun–$23 m

St. Andrew’s Sewanee–$19 m

Tallulah Falls–$30 m

Almost certainly some of these numbers need to be updated. I did not include several schools such as Miss Porter’s and other all female schools because they did not align with my project.

Some may prefer to list by endowment per student. In that case, I suspect that St. Paul’s School with an endowment of $633,000,000 and only about 540 students might be at the top of the list.

I did not include day-only prep schools. Typically, The Westminster Schools in Atlanta, Georgia tops that ranking.

I was just about to post the link ski posted. What is the purpose of this re-tread? It doesn’t provide any information that is useful in making a decision about a school. Perhaps we should post a list of boarding schools by the color of bricks in their buildings.

If there is some particular discussion the OP wishes to generate, it would be helpful to to put that context around the list. Otherwise, nothing to see here.

These are updated numbers from last year’s numbers.

For those who think that school endowments are irrelevant, I suggest that you read the threads concerning Hampshire College & recent college closings.

If you want to pretend that all the benefits of a private school education come without cost, then that can be your fantasy.

I am always amazed at those who disparage the importance of a school’s endowment.

For example, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford & MIT are usually regarded as the top 5 universities in the country. Is it just a coincidence that these same top 5 universities also have the top 5 endowments ?

Accordingly, Andover, Exeter, St. Paul’s, Deerfield, Lawrenceville, Hotchkiss. Choate & Groton are widely regarded as the top ranked & most prestigious boarding schools. Is it just a coincidence that all also rank among the top 10 endowments for all prep schools whether boarding or day ?

Alas, it is nearly impossible to find data that attributes a person’s success to their having attended a university with a large endowment. When you compare equally credentialed students, you find that “how” they approach college is more of a factor than the name on the diploma or the college’s ranking on a list designed to boost circulation and sell ads.

Are schools with high endowments more financially stable? Undoubtedly. Do they have shinier facilities and more robust marketing campaigns? Sure. Do their graduates have better teachers than students at other schools? Not necessarily.

@Publisher One might assume that a school with a higher endowment and higher financial aid budget would be more generous when providing FA to one’s child. THAT WAS NOT ACTUALLY THE CASE WHEN WE APPLIED. The most generous FA offer came from a smaller school with a smaller endowment.

Endowment per student might be a better measure of opportunity and stability, too, since larger schools have larger expenses, too… and endowments might be used for graduate programs that don’t directly benefit underclassmen. One of my best friends went to Harvard and only had one class taught by a professor her first year. (Nearly all of my freshman classes were small and taught by professors.)
