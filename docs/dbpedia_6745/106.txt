The impact of a crew endowment

Supporting an 80-person team requires a significant amount of funding. Assuming a 4% annual draw, a $1,500,000 crew endowment provides nearly $60,000 in vital funds for the annual operation of our expansive crew and waterfront program.

The crew endowment will support:

— Replenishment of crew shells on a 16-year cycle.

— Operating costs associated with our new boathouse, docks, boats, rowing tanks and equipment.

— Athletes hoping to participate in pre- and post-season travel opportunities, regardless of their financial circumstances.

Peg plaques

We will display personalized plaques beneath the 94 pegs in the boathouse's two team rooms. To secure a personalized plaque:

— Alumni who graduated within the past 10 years must donate $2,500 to the endowment.

— Alumni who graduated before 2013 must donate $5,000 to receive a plaque.

Don't miss this great opportunity!

Thank you!

As one of our longest standing programs at Brooks, the endowment will provide stability and growth for the program. Thank you for your consideration.
