        "text": "A: Your child’s education is financed by both your tuition and Altamont Fund gift. Because tuition only covers approximately 90% of our operating budget, charitable gifts are a necessary part of Altamont's healthy financial profile. Unlike tuition, contributions to the Altamont Fund are tax-deductible and allow each family to give at a meaningful level to which they are able.\n\nYour financial contributions to the Altamont Fund support the students and programs that make Altamont the great school that it is: talented teachers, small classes, library and instructional resources, technology, enriching arts and athletics programs, and much more.\n\nA: Altamont Fund gifts range from $10 to more than $15,000. Your gift will have a large impact on the school's programs, faculty and facilities. Your participation encourages others to give, helps the School receive foundation grants, and sends a message to our community that Altamont does make a difference.\n\nIdeally, current parents, grandparents, parents of alums, alumni, trustees, faculty, staff and friends identify Altamont as one of their top philanthropic priorities and recognize that their contributions make a significant difference.\n\nEvery gift, no matter the size, matters to the life of the school.\n\nA: Our fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30. Making your gift before June 30 ensures that your gift helps the current school year. The earlier we receive your gift, the earlier we can put it to work for all our students!\n\nA: First, as an ambassador for the school, your positive endorsement of the Altamont program to the broader community helps attract and retain mission-appropriate students.\n\nSecond, encourage others, such as grandparents who want to support the School and its mission, to contribute to the Altamont Fund.\n\nThird, the success of our Altamont Fund is dependent upon volunteers. We invite you to join us. Please contact our Advancement Office to learn more about how to become involved. Thank you!\n\nThe Altamont School is a tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The school’s Tax ID: 63-0302110. Most gifts accepted by Altamont are outright, where the school does not provide any goods or services in consideration of the gift. The Altamont Gala is an example where the school DOES provide goods/services like the cost of dinner or the Full Market Value of an auction item. The Advancement Department at Altamont sends detailed receipts for all contributions received. Contributions are tax deductible to the extent provided by law. Please contact your tax professional with specific questions.\n\nAmazon Smile\n\nYou shop. Amazon gives. When you shop at http://smile.amazon.com, Amazon will donate to your favorite charitable organization – The Altamont School. The process of selecting your organization is easy and you only have to do it once.\n\nInstructions: Visit the link above. 1 of 2 things will happen: 1) You will be prompted to sign in to your account OR 2) you will be asked to select a charity. Search for “Altamont School” and the School will immediately pop up. Click SELECT and automatically moving forward 0.5% of your purchases will be donated back to the School. Thank you so much!\n\nGifts to Altamont are a wonderful way to memorialize a special loved one or to honor a special time in someone's life. Such gifts are fully tax-deductible, and the person or family in whose name the gift is being made will receive a special card acknowledging the gift and the giver.\n\nDo you own a business whose services could be of-interest to Altamont? Are you personally looking to donate something tangible? We would love to hear from you! Donations of goods and services have often benefited the school and are certainly appreciated. Please understand that Altamont is not able to accept all gifts-in-kind as these gifts must align with a need of the school."
