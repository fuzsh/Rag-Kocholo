        "text": "Your donation contributes to the PBS mission of motivating students to love learning and to grow to be their best selves. This fund directly supports every aspect of the PBS experience, from faculty development and field trips to special speakers and art supplies. The Annual Fund allows us to:\n\nEnergize student learning and academic challenges by investing in ongoing curriculum innovations\n\nPrioritize the excellence of our core academic program: Math, literacy, social-emotional learning, and multigrade subjects\n\nOptimize each student’s academic success with new strategies and practices supporting differentiated instruction\n\nDeepen our excellence in assessing student performance data to help ensure that every student is challenged academically\n\nSupport professional development and training of our high-quality teachers who truly know and care for their students\n\nThese efforts are grounded in our conviction that a great school like PBS is always striving to be even better with aspirational, actionable, achievable initiatives.\n\nYour child is always the top priority at PBS, and we hope PBS is among your family’s top philanthropic priorities. We understand that every family’s ability to give is unique and encourage you to consider what a meaningful gift to the PBS Annual Fund is for your family. Annual Fund gifts have ranged from $10 to $300,000, and each one has made a positive impact on our school.\n\nReturning families: Returning families will be asked to contribute a specific amount based on their previous giving history. We hope that every returning family will consider an increase in their giving from the previous year given the cost of school expenses exceed the tuition increase from the last year.\n\nNew families: While new families will not receive a specific request for the Annual Fund, we would be more than happy to sit down with you and discuss what a meaningful gift might look like and how that gift would positively impact your child’s PBS experience. Any new or returning families who have questions or concerns about their Annual Fund contribution or would like to discuss their gift are encouraged to reach out to their Annual Fund Class Captains, the Annual Fund Co-Chairs, or the Advancement Office.\n\nWhile the Annual Fund is our most critical fundraising initiative, it is not the only one. Each spring we hold our Spring Benefit which supports our needs-based financial aid program and allows us to enroll as many families to the PBS community as possible. We ask that each family consider their overall Annual Giving to PBS and allocate their contribution to the Annual Fund and Spring Benefit, with consideration of the school’s needs and their giving preferences. During your tenure at PBS there will likely be additional fundraising initiatives or special campaigns to which you will be invited to participate. We aim to be as transparent as possible in our development efforts and will make every effort to provide information, answer questions, and show impact around any fundraising that takes place. The generosity of the PBS community is the foundation of all we do here, and every dollar contributed to our mission will be responsibly and effectively stewarded to create the best possible experience for your family, and for each family that makes up our unique community.\n\nThere are a couple ways to lend your talents to this initiative. Each year, two dedicated parents serve as our Annual Fund co-chairs, leading the charge in rallying support from our parent community. Additionally, a wonderful group of parents serve as Annual Fund Class Captains. Two volunteers from each grade act as ambassadors, advocates, and champions of this initiative, encouraging fellow PBS peers to make their gifts. You can find more details on these roles and information on who to contact if you are interested in participating by visiting our Class Captain page online."
