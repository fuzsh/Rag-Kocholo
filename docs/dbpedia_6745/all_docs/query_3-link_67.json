        "text": "For fifth-formers, our goal in the college counseling process at Brooks is to give students and their families a lot of time, great resources, and thoughtful guidance to make the search a fulfilling and self-directed one. We build time into the winter and spring for students to take advantage of the resources here, and we work hard to maximize the benefits of the time students spend thinking about and working on postgraduate plans. In the meantime, each fifth-former’s primary responsibility in this process is to start the year giving their best, academically, right out of the gate.\n\nWe meet with you the Friday morning of Parents’ Weekend to introduce ourselves and the program to you. Your formal work begins after winter break, when we have our first small-group meetings with your class. We utilize a combination of small group meetings and whole-class form meetings each week throughout the rest of the academic year, and each of you will meet at least three times with us individually this winter and spring as well.\n\nThe fifth-form college curriculum is built around five central pieces:\n\nA good deal of introspective writing and thinking\n\nAn introduction to the myriad resources at your disposal to inform your search, and the production of an exploratory list\n\nLearning to evaluate your own credentials\n\nWorking with your counselor to produce a balanced summer list of colleges and universities to explore, and\n\nActual application work including a draft of a college essay\n\nThis all occurs through regular group sessions and three individual meetings with your counselor. You will head into the summer before your senior year having done thoughtful, focused work on this process with our staff and resources close at hand.\n\nA thoughtful and effective college search begins with students getting to know themselves, and remains focused on fitting choices to students’ talents and interests.\n\nYou’ll be given ample opportunity to engage and make the process your own. We’ll help, and we’ll remain in contact with parents to keep things moving forward smoothly and productively at home. We look forward to working with you."
