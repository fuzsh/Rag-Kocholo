        "text": "The Alice and Joseph Brooks International Lecture on the Neurosciences was supported by an endowed fund created at Harvard Medical School in 1984 by Alice and Joseph Brooks and nearly 200 other generous donors they recruited. The Brooks fund supports lectures at Harvard Medical School by international neuroscientists recognized as experts in their fields. The fund also provides fellowships to international scholars working within the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School. The intention of both the lecture and fellowship programs is to enhance collegial interaction among Harvard Medical School neuroscientists and their peers around the world.\n\nAt the time they created the endowment, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks were noted for their philanthropic support of the arts and health care. Mr. Brooks was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lord & Taylor in New York City. He served in various capacities supporting New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, New York Public Library, the Museum of the City of New York, and the International Tennis Hall of Fame and Tennis Museum in Newport."
