        "text": "Your Support Inspires\n\nYou believe in boys and what they can become. We do, too.\n\nEvery day we gain new inspiration from the achievements of our boys on campus and Landon men all over the world. Our parents, alumni, and other friends invest in our school’s mission, our boys’ experience, and our boys’ potential so they will become the responsible and resilient leaders the world needs—so every boy will become the best version of himself.\n\nAnchor\n\nThe Landon Fund\n\nWith your support, we will define Landon as we head into the next century and beyond. We hope you will join us. There are many ways alumni, parents, and friends support Landon each year. The Landon Fund is an important part of our budget and is the first place most donors direct their support.\n\nGifts to the Landon Fund directly support the operating budget and all areas of the Landon experience. Whether it is academics or the arts, athletics or faculty development, financial aid or campus and facilities, we have seven different funds that you may choose from to support. The “Area of Greatest Need” fund allows us the flexibility to invest in our most urgent priorities.\n\nGifts to the General Endowment Fund are particularly valuable gifts as they allow Landon to direct the draw to the areas of greatest need during the budget process. General endowment funds are distributed throughout the operating budget and are used to support faculty development programs, financial aid, arts, and athletic programs. Your endowment gift impacts all areas of campus life and benefits each student and each teacher-coach-mentor, allowing Landon to deliver on its mission to prepare talented boys for productive lives as accomplished, responsible, and caring men.\n\nThe Ethan H. Freed ’11 Endowed Merit Scholarship was established in 2019 in memory of Ethan H. Freed, the eldest son of Susan and Jeffrey Freed and brother to Adam ’13 and Alex ’18. Through the Ethan H. Freed ’11 Endowed Merit Scholarship, we remember Ethan fondly and award a scholarship to a Landon boy who lives his life according to Ethan’s core beliefs of honesty, civility, perseverance, and good sportsmanship—key attributes of a Landon School education.\n\nBy providing necessary resources to deserving boys, the Ethan H. Freed ’11 Endowed Merit Scholarship will assist the school in attracting high-achieving, high-potential students and strengthen the school’s community of learners. The Ethan H. Freed ’11 Endowed Merit Scholarship directly supports Landon’s mission to nurture the whole boy—a critical point at the heart of an all-boys independent school education.\n\nTo further its commitment to academic and personal excellence, the Landon School seeks to grow the School's endowment. The Class of 1970 supports this important goal by establishing The James P. McEwan ’70 Endowed Scholarship. We honor our classmate, Jamie McEwan, whose exemplary character, integrity, and achievements celebrate the outcomes Landon seeks in its graduates. In establishing this scholarship, we remember Jamie's integrity in the fullest sense of that word—a deep and vigilant commitment to a life where all the pieces (mind, body, family, friends, community) are in dynamic interplay and harmony. We recognize that this scholarship directly supports the School's mission to nurture the whole boy—a critical point at the heart of independent school education. By providing financial resources to deserving students who demonstrate the highest standard of excellence as students and leaders among their peers, The James P. McEwan ’70 Endowed Scholarship will further the School's ability to enroll and sustain high-achieving, high-potential boys, thus strengthening the School's community of learners.\n\nThe Vanessa Burchett Endowed Scholarship was established by Dwaine Alleyne ’00, Nii Amaah K. Ofosu-Amaah ’00, and friends to honor Vanessa Burchett. In establishing this scholarship, we remember Vanessa’s deep and vigilant commitment to the teaching and mentoring of Landon’s youngest bears. Vanessa will be long remembered for her warm approach, ensuring the young men in her care would thrive in the world which awaits them. In addition, we recognize that this scholarship directly supports the school’s mission to nurture the whole boy—a critical point at the heart of independent school education. By providing financial resources to a Lower School student of color, the Vanessa Burchett Endowed Scholar demonstrates the highest standard of excellence as a student and leader among their peers. The Vanessa Burchett Endowed Scholarship will further the school’s ability to enroll and sustain high-achieving, high-potential boys, thus strengthening the school’s community of learners. Additionally, the Vanessa Burchett Endowed Scholarship demonstrates Landon School’s conviction to fully embrace the importance of diversity and equity in our community as we seek to be a place where all feel included and welcomed. This scholarship will be awarded once it is fully funded.\n\nThe Grayson W. Hanes '16 Endowed Scholarship was established in 2021 in memory of Grayson W. Hanes '16, son of Dana and Grayson S. Hanes. Grayson was a kind, thoughtful, and humble person. He cared so much for his fellow bears lifting their spirits with stories and encouraging words. Grayson always saw the good in people. He was insightful and profound, and those around him were drawn to his generous spirit. The Grayson W. Hanes '16 Endowed Scholarship encourages others to live selflessly like Grayson.\n\nThrough the Grayson W. Hanes '16 Endowed Scholarship, we remember Grayson fondly and award a scholarship to a Landon boy who lives his life according to Grayson's core beliefs of kindness, gratitude, and humility, values central to a Landon education. By providing necessary resources to deserving boys, the Grayson W. Hanes '16 Endowed Scholarship will assist the school in attracting young men who ground their actions in ethical principles exploring what makes an honorable life. In addition, the Grayson W. Hanes '16 Endowed Scholarship directly supports Landon's mission to nurture the whole boy—a critical point at the heart of an all-boys independent school education.\n\nTo further its commitment to academic and personal excellence, Landon School seeks to grow the school’s endowment. The Class of 1982 supports this important goal by establishing The Yogi Todd Endowed Scholarship in memory of Todd Breier ‘82. We honor our classmate whose achievements celebrate the outcomes Landon seeks in its graduates. In establishing this scholarship, we remember Todd as a student-athlete succeeding in multiple sports at Landon and at University of Virginia. Todd was a world traveler extraordinaire who enjoyed his many years teaching English to multiple generations of Taiwanese students. We recognize that this scholarship directly supports the school’s mission to nurture the whole boy—a critical point at the heart of independent school education.\n\nBy providing financial resources to deserving students who demonstrate the highest standard of excellence as students and leaders among their peers, The Yogi Todd Endowed Scholarship will further the school’s ability to enroll and sustain high-achieving, high-potential boys, thus strengthening the school’s community of learners.\n\nOf the many ways that teaching excellence is nurtured and recognized at Landon School, the awarding of an endowed faculty chair is one of the most significant. Peter Arnold '82 established The Peter M. Swinehart Chair in Literature & Composition in 2019.\n\nLiterary study necessarily confronts us with the richness of human experiences, helping us to appreciate common values and the differences between those experiences across cultures, places, and times. Peter M. Swinehart, a master of the English language, taught at Landon School for more than forty years, delivering excellence in education to generations of boys. Serving as a mentor to his colleagues, Mr. Swinehart was one of the early architects of the humanities program and instrumental in ensuring innovation and creativity was at the forefront of a Landon boys education. The Landon community will be forever grateful to Mr. Swinehart for his dedicated service to the teaching profession.\n\nIncome from the Peter M. Swinehart Chair in Literature & Composition exclusively supports the study of \"Literature of Accepted Critical Merit\" (LACM) and efforts to promote better writing among Landon students. The Peter M. Swinehart Chair in Literature & Composition will honor a member of the faculty who has demonstrated excellence in teaching LACM. Income from the Swinehart Chair will also support (1) teacher professional development in writing instruction focusing on LACM and (2) excellence in implementing methods to help students improve their writing.\n\nThe purpose of the gift is to establish The Baison Family Endowed Chair in Science at Landon School. The following language will be used in perpetuity to describe the purpose of the Chair:\n\nIn 2022, Elizabeth S. Baison and Gregory L. Baison established an endowed chair dedicated to the disciplines of science. Science, including computer science, has a rapidly changing knowledge base and expanding relevance to societal issues, and teachers will need ongoing opportunities to build their understanding and ability. Teachers also must have opportunities to develop an understanding of how students with diverse interests, abilities, and experiences make sense of scientific ideas and what a teacher does to support and guide all students. And teachers require the opportunity to study and engage in research on science teaching and learning, and to share with colleagues what they have learned. By recognizing and rewarding teaching excellence, the Baison Endowed Chair for Science generates funds for professional development to enhance the quality of a Landon education.\n\nThe purpose of the gift is to establish The Wenchel Family Endowed Chair in STEM at Landon School. The following language will be used in perpetuity to describe the purpose of the Chair:\n\nIn 2021, George Wenchel '65 established an endowed chair dedicated to the disciplines of science, technology, engineering and mathematics commonly known as STEM. Established to recognize faculty excellence, this gift honors a classroom teacher for their outstanding leadership in STEM education. By recognizing and rewarding teaching excellence, the Wenchel Family Endowed Chair for STEM generates funds for professional development to enhance the quality of a Landon education.\n\nThe Endowed Professional Development Fund for Learning Support was established to provide funding to ensure classroom teachers have access to conferences, workshops, and onsite seminars to fully understand how all boys learn, including those with learning differences. By identifying the instructional approaches, tools, and accommodations that lead to the greatest success for everyone, we seek to optimize the learning experience for every boy. The Endowed Professional Development Fund for Learning Support directly supports the work of the Center for Teaching and Learning to advance the awareness of the faculty regarding teaching strategies that engage all our boys.\n\nThe Class of 1957 Fund for Faculty Housing provides funding for faculty members and senior administrators to live either in residences located on or adjacent to campus or in apartments in nearby Bethesda. Given the high cost of living in the Washington, D.C., area, this endowed fund helps Landon recruit and retain both senior administrators as well as young teacher-coach-mentors. The Fund was established in 1992 by the Class of 1957 in honor of its 35th Reunion.\n\nThis fund was established by the family of John P. Leachman ’45 in his name. There were initial gifts from his three sons, Jack ’69, Tom ’72, and Scott ’77. In addition, other family and friends have contributed to this fund over the years. Each year, the Leachman family will be given three options or choices in which the fund may assist in areas like financial aid, academic support, or teacher/coach salaries.\n\nThe Bou Family Foundation Endowed Fund honors the dedication of the men and women of our buildings and grounds departments who ensure our campus meets the needs of our boys, our teacher-coach-mentors and our community each day. The Foundation was equally inspired by a desire to support the historic preservation of the Farmhouse, which was originally a tenants' home on the Andrews Family Estate. The Farmhouse later became the residence of the school's founders, Paul Landon and Mary Lee Banfield, and is now used for school meetings and special events.\n\nThe purpose of the Helen and Anderson Arnold ’78 Endowed Fund for Academic Enrichment is to provide financial resources to ensure that teaching practices at Landon are as current, creative, and engaging as possible, so that the School can tap the tremendous potential of all of its students. The resources will do this by supporting the work of the Center for Teaching and Learning and the learning specialists who are part of it as they work with teachers, students, and administrators to advance the quality of teaching at Landon and the awareness of the faculty regarding teaching tactics that engage all of our boys.\n\nMany companies match the charitable gifts made by their employees to the Landon School. Check our database to see if your employer matches donations. If your company has a matching gift program, please contact your human resources department to initiate the process. If your company is eligible, request a matching gift form from your employer and send it completed and signed with your gift. We will do the rest.\n\nCheck our Database\n\nA retirement plan, such as an IRA, can be a smart source for charitable giving. Below are two tax-efficient options for making a gift from your IRA during your lifetime or through your estate:\n\nQualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)\n\nIf you are 70½ years or older, an IRA charitable rollover gift allows you to direct up to $100,000* tax free to Landon each year from your traditional IRA, which satisfies your required minimum distribution and reduces your taxable income. Contact your IRA custodian to request a direct distribution to Landon School.\n\n*Married taxpayers who meet QCD requirements and file joint returns can donate $100,000 from each spouse’s IRA, for a total of $200,000 annually.\n\nBeneficiary Designation\n\nYou can designate Landon School as a primary, contingent, or co-beneficiary of your IRA or other retirement plan. You reduce your taxable estate and avoid income tax, while Landon receives the full amount of the untaxed gift. Simply request a beneficiary designation form from your plan custodian or bank branch.\n\nFor more information, please contact Director of Major and Planned Giving, Lucas Metropulos, at 301-320-1005 or lucas_metropulos@landon.net.\n\nLandon School can be listed as a beneficiary and/or owner of a life insurance policy. By naming Landon as the owner and beneficiary of a life insurance policy, you will receive an income tax charitable deduction, and the value of the policy will not be included in your taxable estate. Landon also accepts fully “paid up” policies, meaning there are no more premiums to pay.\n\nFor more information, please contact Director of Major and Planned Giving, Lucas Metropulos, at 301-320-1005 or lucas_metropulos@landon.net.\n\nBy giving your time as a member of our community, you’ll play a vital role in our commitment to Landon’s mission, students, and the students’ futures. Landon relies on its parents, grandparents, and alumni to serve as guest speakers, mentors, class agents, event hosts, and more.\n\nParents, please contact Director of Parent Programs Cindy Peters at 301-320-1046 or cindy_peters@landon.net for more information.\n\nAlumni, please contact Director of Annual Giving and Alumni Relations Michael McCabe at 301-320-1098 or michael_mccabe@landon.net for more information.\n\nYour Support Leads\n\nLeadership giving is critical to the success of The Landon Fund each year.\n\nMembership in the Leadership Council begins at a giving level of $2,500 cumulative during our fiscal year, July 1 to June 30. Leadership donors receive special recognition in Landon’s Annual Report and members will receive an invitation to the annual Headmaster’s Council event. The Leadership Council donor categories are listed below."
