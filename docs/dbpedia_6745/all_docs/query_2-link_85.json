The fund is a budgeted item and is forward funding, thereby directly impacting the operating budget for the following year. These gifts are unrestricted and support our students in tangible and measurable ways. Our goal is to achieve 100% participation.\n\nTrinity School is a nurturing community inspiring students to reach for every bit of their potential as students, athletes, artists, leaders, and friends. Your contribution can be the investment that secures their future.\n\nPlease give to the Trinity Fund Annual Campaign today. It's simple, it's effective, and it is the one opportunity for each and every member of our community to unite and support our Mission.\n\nEvery gift makes a difference for our students!"
