By focusing on the learning process and the development of 7 Essential Skills, The Governor's Academy teaches students how to think critically, creatively, and independently. We encourage students to acquire knowledge through hands-on activity, multi-disciplinary inquiry, analysis, and reflection. Many structures, including the advising system, extra-help sessions, and evening study hours--supervised by dormitory parents--help students learn to study and manage their time well. Our goal is to teach young people to become actively accountable for their own learning and to grow by learning with others. Classes meet for 60 and 90-minute periods, affording students and teachers more opportunity to explore subject matter in depth, from different perspectives and with a variety of classroom activities. In addition to traditional assessments such as tests and papers, students debate, conduct hands-on laboratory and field experiments, make oral presentations, research in groups, use technology to create presentations, and design their own portfolios. Students and faculty bring to The Governor's Academy a richness of experience, perspective, and diversity which adds immeasurably to the education of all. This is the spirit that inspires a community--this family--of learners. During the past decade, many new buildings have been erected or renovated, including the Math and Science Center, Library, Student Center, Performing Arts Center, renovated dining hall, new ice hockey arena, synthetic turf field, and dormitory.\n\nThe Governor's Academy (formerly Governor Dummer Academy) accreditations: New England Association of Schools and Colleges; Association of Boarding Schools\n\nSample of notable school alumni/alumnae:\n\nBooker T.
