        "text": "The impact of a crew endowment\n\nSupporting an 80-person team requires a significant amount of funding. Assuming a 4% annual draw, a $1,500,000 crew endowment provides nearly $60,000 in vital funds for the annual operation of our expansive crew and waterfront program.\n\nThe crew endowment will support:\n\n— Replenishment of crew shells on a 16-year cycle.\n\n— Operating costs associated with our new boathouse, docks, boats, rowing tanks and equipment.\n\n— Athletes hoping to participate in pre- and post-season travel opportunities, regardless of their financial circumstances.\n\nPeg plaques\n\nWe will display personalized plaques beneath the 94 pegs in the boathouse's two team rooms. To secure a personalized plaque:\n\n— Alumni who graduated within the past 10 years must donate $2,500 to the endowment.\n\n— Alumni who graduated before 2013 must donate $5,000 to receive a plaque.\n\nDon't miss this great opportunity!\n\nThank you!\n\nAs one of our longest standing programs at Brooks, the endowment will provide stability and growth for the program. Thank you for your consideration."
