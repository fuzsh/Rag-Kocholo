        "text": "At Brook Hill, our goal is that every student who walks the halls will become a better learner, leader, listener, problem-solver, and friend. Students are given the opportunity to excel academically, mature spiritually, and engage globally. The Brook Hill School is committed to training students to be confident in both their faith and their education. A Brook Hill education prepares them to read insightfully, think critically, solve problems logically, and communicate effectively within the framework of a Biblical worldview. Brook Hill students are encouraged to discuss ideas with genuine intellectual inquiry and Christian charity. A Brook Hill foundation equips them to make good decisions, grounded in the faith; to face the challenges of the real world, without being sheltered from them; and to impact others for God's glory. We believe in: The Pursuit of Academic Excellence, Providing Comprehensive Curricular, Co-curricular and Extra-curricular Programs, Spiritual and Character Formation, and A Biblical Worldview.\n\nSummary: Brook Hill attracts some of the finest educators in the United States. Over 70% of the Middle and Upper School faculty hold advanced degrees in their area of expertise, and all are committed to providing an education that integrates faith and learning. The curriculum provides a solid liberal arts education based on universal truths, foundational principles, enduring traditions, and the great literature of history. Education at Brook Hill strives to develop the whole student. A balance of instruction is offered so that students grow in knowledge, skills, and wisdom through the perspective of a biblical worldview. This strong balance contributes to the academic success that abounds at Brook Hill.\n\nDepartment Director Michelle Rozell\n\nStudent/Teacher Ratio: 9:1\n\nAverage Class Size: 15\n\nSummer Programs: Offered\n\nFull Time Teachers: 85\n\nNumber of AP Courses Offered: 29\n\nTeachers Holding Advanced Degrees: 70%\n\nNumber of IB Courses Offered: 0\n\nNoteworthy Information:\n\nMultiple National Merit Scholars, State Championships - Arts-Academics-Athletics\n\nLearning Support\n\nEvening Study Assistance\n\nLearning Center\n\nPeer Tutoring\n\nTechnology Center\n\nEnglish\n\nClassics\n\nHonors\n\nLiterature\n\nAP English Language\n\nAP English Literature\n\nAmerican Literature\n\nHistory\n\nHonors\n\nUnited States History\n\nWorld History\n\nForeign Languages\n\nSpanish\n\nReligion / Philosophy\n\nFaith\n\nMoral Philosophy\n\nPhilosophy\n\nReligious Studies\n\nThe Bible\n\nTheology\n\nWorld Religions\n\nHumanities / Social Sciences\n\nEconomics\n\nSciences\n\nAnatomy\n\nBiology\n\nChemistry\n\nEarth Science\n\nEnvironmental Science\n\nPhysics\n\nSports Medicine\n\nForensics\n\nLife Science\n\nRobotics\n\nMath\n\nComputer Studies\n\nRobotics\n\nDigital Media\n\nMusic\n\nChoral Music\n\nOrchestra\n\nVoice\n\nPerforming / Visual Arts\n\nActing\n\nCeramics\n\nDance\n\nDebate\n\nDrama\n\nDrawing\n\nGraphic Design\n\nPainting\n\nPhotography\n\nPortfolio\n\nPottery\n\nPublic Speaking\n\nStagecraft\n\nStudio Art\n\nTheater Arts\n\nTheater Design\n\nOrchestra\n\nSpecial Programs\n\nCommunity Service\n\nInternships\n\nLeadership\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nPhysical Education\n\nRobotics\n\nPublic Speaking\n\nStudent Council\n\nMaker Space\n\nDistinctive or New Programs\n\nStudents Selecting Specific Courses May Graduate With Over 60 College Credits Through Dual Credit And Ap Courses.\n\nDorm Life\n\nNumber of Dorms: 6\n\nAverage Students Per Dorm: 20\n\nNumber of Girls Dorms: 3\n\nNumber of Boys Dorms: 3\n\nDorm Amenities\n\nGame Room\n\nLaundry Facilities\n\nLounge\n\nWireless Internet\n\nFull Kitchen\n\nRefrigerator\n\nOther Dorm Amenities\n\nFull kitchen facilities for student use; Private pantries; Comfortable living areas; Large screen TV's; Multiple in-town & out-of-town trips and on-campus activities\n\nStudent Life\n\nWe're passionate about cultivating community and creating a fun, memorable student life experience.

We organize community activities on campus, take recreational trips in-town, as well as both cultural and fun trips to bigger cities like Dallas. Some of our out-of-town trips include: Professional Basketball, Soccer & Baseball games, festivals, fairs, symphonies, ballets, musicals, shopping, amusement parks, and many others.
