As you watch videos, browse photos, and read about our program, you’ll become acquainted with engaged, active, and joyful student-learners.\n\nYou’ll meet their teachers – dedicated early-learning and elementary educators and life-long learners in their own right whose commitment to academic excellence is matched with extraordinary care for children and their growth.\n\nYou’ll hear from their parents, as well, who partner closely with the school and show their commitment and generosity every day, in ways big and small.\n\nYou will read about the core values and mission that ground our school, tie us to the legacy of our visionary founders, and establish a moral foundation for PBS alumni who are making a difference in their communities.\n\nPhillips Brooks School distinguishes itself with a unique combination of academic strength and an emphasis on emotional intelligence. This approach to program excellence ensures that PBS children flourish because we pay attention to them as individual learners, in partnership with their families. PBS students graduate as confident and empowered learners.\n\nI invite you to visit so that you and your family can experience first-hand this extraordinary school and our beautiful campus. Come see the excitement on students’ faces, experience their teachers’ enthusiasm, and feel the strong sense of community.\n\nWarmly,\n\nDiane Rosenberg\n\nInterim-Head of School\n\ndrosenberg@phillipsbrooks.org"
