        "text": "The Nashoba Brooks Fund helps to ensure our School's financial sustainability by helping us bridge the gap between tuition revenue and actual operating costs. All gifts to the Nashoba Brooks Fund are used exclusively to support the operating budget and are spent the year they are made, thereby making a direct and immediate impact on the student experience. These unrestricted dollars give the School the flexibility to apply them to the areas where they are most needed. They can help to pay for books in the library; soccer balls; employee compensation; art supplies; class field trips; and so much more.\n\nEvery gift, no matter the size, is greatly appreciated. Participation is a heartfelt affirmation of the School's mission and enables us to reach our goals together. High participation across our community sends a powerful message that you support the mission and vision of the School, and inspires others to do the same. Your gift is counted toward participation in all the groups of which you are a member—parent, alumni, employee, grandparent, friend—and in all the class years with which you are affiliated.\n\nWe would love to talk to you more about giving to the Nashoba Brooks Fund. Please reach out by contacting Director of Annual Giving Amy Leahy, at aleahy@nashobabrooks.org or 978.369.4591.\n\nNashoba Brooks School is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Your contribution is tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law."
