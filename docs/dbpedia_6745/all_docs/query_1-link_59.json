        "text": "To increase access for students and families whose finances are a barrier to attending The Bush School. The Lavizzo Fund for Financial Aid (Fund) will support financial aid to students for tuition and other school-related expenses.\n\nBackground: As a member of The Bush School Class of 1972, Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey believes in the quality of a Bush education. Her parents, Dr. Blanche Sellers Lavizzo and Dr. Philip Lavizzo, instilled the value of quality education for all at an early age. Risa is now memorializing her parents' care and commitment to education by establishing an endowment fund in their name.\n\nDrs. Lavizzo left an incredible legacy in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest through their careers in medicine, but their stories are deeply rooted in education and justice.\n\nDr. Lavizzo-Mourey's pediatrician mother, Dr. Blanche Sellers Lavizzo, and surgeon husband Dr. Philip Lavizzo left medical practices in New Orleans, Louisiana, to pursue their careers in the Northwest.\n\nDr. Sellers Lavizzo was the first African American woman pediatrician in the state of Washington. She arrived in Seattle in July 1956 and began her pediatric practice in the Central District. She served as first medical director of the Qdessa Brown Children's Clinic, a program of Children's Hospital. Her presence and commitment to quality care with dignity was always a source of comfort to concerned parents.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 11, 1925, she was a friend and schoolmate of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Her father was the owner of one of Atlanta's largest black funeral homes. She graduated from Spelman College in 1946, and from Meharry Medical College in 1950. In 1975, she received a Masters in Public Health from the University of Washington.\n\nAn active force in the black community, she served on the board of the Girls Club of Puget Sound and as president of the Seattle Chapter of Links, Inc., a national black women's service organization. She contributed her time to many other community organizations including the Seattle Urban League, United Way of King County, and numerous health organizations.\n\nDr Lavizzo-Mourey's father, Dr. Philip V. Lavizzo was born in 1917 and was one of the first Board Certified African American doctors to practice surgery in the Pacific Northwest. He graduated from Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee and initially practiced medicine in New Orleans, Louisiana. Dr. Philip Lavizzo was hired as an assistant surgeon in the United States Public Health Service in Seattle.\n\nIn 1956-1957, Dr. Lavizzo served on the education committee of the Seattle Urban League. In 1965, he was appointed chairman of the personnel committee of the Seattle King County Economic Opportunity Committee (EOC) Board, the local government. The King County EOC managed a range of anti-poverty programs and initiatives in the area. Also in 1965, Dr. Lavizzo became one of the eleven founding members of the Alpha Omicron Boule of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity.\n\nAlthough both Blanche and Philip Lavizzo were committed to education and public service, both died prematurely and never saw the ways their investments in Risa's education especially the decision to enroll her in The Bush School paid off.\n\nIn memory of Ian Fair, The Bush School and Ian’s loving family and friends have established The Ian Fair Fund for the Methow Campus. To honor Ian’s vision and dedication, the Fund supports the integration of wilderness, cultural, and immersive experiential learning for students of The Bush School and the Methow Valley. Ian envisioned a unique and powerful opportunity for students from the east and west sides of the Cascades to engage with and learn from one another in the magic of the Methow Valley – a place Ian cherished and called home. Those involved with the program will carry forth his vision and infectious enthusiasm for teaching, the community, and the great outdoors. In his role as program coordinator, Ian was hired to launch an experiential and project-based curriculum on the new campus. Ian was the perfect partner to build bridges, generate big ideas, and share the beauty and wonder of the places and people of the Methow Valley. With passion, experience, and a generous heart, Ian immediately connected with students, colleagues, and the community to pave the way for a program to deliver on the school’s bold promise of sparking in students of diverse backgrounds and talents a passion for learning, accomplishment, and contribution to their communities.\n\nThe Ian Fair Fund for the Methow Campus\n\nMichaela Precourt\n\nMethow Campus Program Manager | The Bush School\n\nIn the 2020-2021 school year, programming at the Methow Campus had to be reenvisioned, as was the case with other areas of experiential learning through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPart of our work on the Methow Valley Elementary Family and Community Engagement committee in 2020-2021 was to address equity of access to summer camps and other out-of-school opportunities. With the shift of many organizations to online registration, there was a very real barrier for families who didn’t have reliable internet access, in addition to the cost of these programs. Working with the Counselor and English Language Learner Liaison at Liberty Bell High School, we pre-registered seven students for summer camps at The Bush School whose tuition was paid through The Ian Fair Fund for the Methow Campus. They enrolled in Art in Nature, Fly-fishing, and Orienteering with amazing instructors.\n\nNot only did these seven students have experiences that introduced them to new skills and strengths, the camps was richer due to their presence."
