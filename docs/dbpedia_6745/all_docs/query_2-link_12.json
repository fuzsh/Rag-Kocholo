        "text": "Far Brookâs Endowment has grown over the years to a total of $9,081,140, as of June 30, 2023, made possible through the generosity and vision of the Far Brook community â current parents, alumni families, and friends. A percentage of the income from these funds is directed toward the operating budget each year. The Endowment contributes to a strong overall financial basis for the school, supports increased scholarship opportunities for students, and provides greater flexibility for visionary educational programs.\n\nIn addition to its growing Unrestricted or General Endowment Fund, Far Brook also has a number of Restricted Endowment Funds which are outlined below. Please note that it is possible to add to any of these Funds, which honor and remember extraordinary current and deceased members of the Far Brook community and the wider world. Questions about special naming opportunities and formal Gift Acceptance Policies can be directed to theÂ Development Office.
