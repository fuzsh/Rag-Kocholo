Ball State University; M.B.A. University of Saint Francis\n\n260.665.4757 | email\n\nI enjoy helping, challenging and watching students grow. Valuation, competitive strategy and management practice consume a lot of my career interest. If you canâ€™t find me in the office or classroom, I can be found either with my family, playing with my dogs or getting into trouble. I worked at the school endowment fund and in a tool and die shop while at Ball State. After graduating I started as a staff accountant for a local multinational manufacturing company and received my graduate degree from Saint Francis. This helped me move through a variety of positions and collect differing levels of responsibility and experiences for the next 8 years. I was able to complete Greenbelt, Black Belt and leadership training, this helped me move from Cost Accountant to Margin Analyst, Plant Superintendent, ending my tenure as Plant Manager before receiving an opportunity to work at Trine."
