        "text": "This permanent fund was established in 2007 as a tribute to Champlain’s distinguished Accounting faculty who, at the time the fund was established, had over 200 collective years of experience. Funded by faculty, staff and primarily accounting alumni over the years, the scholarships awarded from this fund assist accomplished accounting students. Accounting Excellence Award recipients are selected annually by faculty members in the Stiller School of Business.\n\nThis fund was made possible by a gift from an anonymous corporate donor in 1983, with a major addition in 1995, and honors the College’s long-time trustee, business officer and friend, John Bankus, and his wife, Charlotte. The scholarship provides funds for Vermont students with financial need.\n\nThe fund is in loving memory of Owen H. Becker, a longtime friend of Champlain College’s Support-A-Student program. This permanent fund, established by Margaret Becker and her family in 2005, provides tuition assistance to at least one student each year that possesses the academic potential to succeed at Champlain, and requires significant levels of borrowing based on family financial circumstances. Preference is given to students from Connecticut and Vermont and those majoring in a business or human resources career area.\n\nThis permanent fund was established in 2007 and awards scholarships to an undergraduate student who is an orphan (both parents are deceased, and the applicant is not legally adopted) of United States citizenship. The recipient must have financial need and a GPA in high school or post-high-school education of 2.5 or better on a 4.0 scale. If there are no eligible students, based on the criteria above, foster children who are wards of the state may be considered for the scholarship.\n\nEstablished by trustee George Burrill and his wife Lola Van Wagenen in 2012, this permanent fund provides assistance to students receiving help from our New American Scholarship program. In any year where there might not be a New American in need, the funds will be used to provide assistance to students in our Vermont First Generation Scholarship Program. And lastly, if none of the earlier preferences are in need, the fund will provide general scholarship support.\n\nThis award was established in 1993 by faculty and staff at Champlain College with initial investments made in honor of Mary Sigler, Esq., a faculty member who had passed away. In 2012 a large addition was made by family and friends in memory of Deana Higgs-Gordon, a staff member who passed away suddenly. Ongoing additions by faculty and staff grow the endowment continually. This permanent fund provides scholarships to full-time students with financial need who show academic success in their field and demonstrate good citizenship in the classroom, residence halls, and social settings.\n\nThe Patricia Burns Conant Endowment is a permanent fund established in 2013 to provide scholarship assistance to single parent students who attend Champlain College. Generously established by Donna and Remo Pizzagalli, this fund memorializes their dear friend and long-time Champlain employee, Patricia Conant, who worked at Champlain from 1958 to 2006 in a number of positions including professor, career counselor and admissions associate director. Pat was a constant mentor and advocate for students, and in particular nontraditional students like the single parents this fund supports.\n\nFriends and colleagues of David Faigel, the founder of Champlain’s former Dental Assisting program, established this fund in Dr. Faigel’s memory in 1977. It is a permanent fund awarded to the Radiography Program student with the highest GPA after his or her first year, or to a student with the highest GPA in one of Champlain’s Healthcare programs.\n\nEstablished in 2012 by the Herschel L. Seder Family, and added to by family and friends, in honor of his beloved sister Betty Fishman, who passed away in 2011. Betty was a longtime friend and benefactor to Champlain College and served for 22 years on the Board of Trustees. She was a visionary leader in the Vermont community, continually connecting the right people with the right initiatives to make things happen. She founded a group of courageous women who provided lead support for the Single Parents Program at Champlain College. In 2002, she received the Champlain College Distinguished Citizen of the Year award. This permanent fund provides tuition assistance to students, with a preference for single parents financially struggling with the rigors of their academic program and the challenges of raising children at the same time, and often working part-time as well.\n\nNamed in honor of Holly D. Miller and Thomas H. Pierce, co-chairs of the Uncommon Ground Campaign, which was successfully completed in October 1997, this permanent endowment fund honors the duo’s tireless efforts, unique talents and tremendous inspiration. Funded by the Board of Trustees and the campaign cabinet, this fund supports Champlain students according to criteria set by its honorees.\n\nThis permanent fund was established in 1984 by the family, friends, colleagues and students of the late Mr. Newberry, a popular member of the Business Administration faculty. It provides financial assistance each year to deserving students in the Stiller School of Business, and students are eligible to receive it all four years they are enrolled.\n\nThe Patricia Pizzagalli Endowment Fund is a permanent fund established in 2002 to provide scholarship assistance, with a preference for a student referred by the King Street Youth Center who is continuing his or her education at Champlain College. In the event that there is no student from the King Street program, this scholarship may be awarded to a student from Chittenden County with financial need as determined by the Financial Aid Office at Champlain College.\n\nEstablished in 2010 by Frederick and Eleanor Pratt, long-time friends of Woodbury College, now Woodbury Institute of Champlain College, this permanent fund provides tuition assistance to students whose presence on campus will measurably increase the diversity of the Champlain body and additionally may serve as an inspiration to a wide range of Champlain students. To be eligible for the scholarship, students must be Vermont residents with a preference given to those who are the first in their family to attend college, or who reside in Vermont as New Americans.\n\nThis permanent fund was established in 2013 in memory of Sarah Elizabeth Ramsey by her family and friends after she passed away unexpectedly. In honor of her inspiring and passionate creativity and zest for life, and her love of travel abroad, this fund supports a rising sophomore, junior or senior marketing major who exemplifies Sarah’s qualities including drive, determination, creative and critical thinking, individuality, a passion for advertising and branding, and a thirst to experience all life has to offer. This need-based scholarship is awarded annually and given to a student, with a minimum 3.0 GPA, who has plans to travel or immerse themselves in an internship with the power to be transformative. Award recipients are selected annually by the Sarah Ramsey Strong Advisory Council. More information about this scholarship and the application process can be found here.\n\nEstablished in 1993 through a bequest from Mary Sigler, former faculty member, this permanent fund provides assistance to full-time students with financial need who show academic success in their field and demonstrate good citizenship. The Sigler Fund provides one or more non-renewable scholarships to first-year Stiller School of Business, majors who have demonstrated financial need, strong academic success in high school, outstanding citizenship and a desire to continue their leadership in College, and a “spirit of giving back” through community service activities.\n\nThis permanent fund was established in 2008 by Alan Stracke (former Champlain College professor) and his wife Lynda Reid (former Champlain College employee). This is the first Champlain College permanent endowment to provide financial assistance to Champlain College students studying at a Champlain Abroad campus for a semester or more. This fund is awarded by the Office of International Education.\n\nThe Sullivan Family, many of whom are graduates of Champlain College, including Michael Sullivan, Sr. ’67, Raymond Sullivan ’68, Peggy Sullivan ’68, and Michael Sullivan, Jr. ’90, established this permanent fund in 2010 to provide financial assistance to at least one student each year enrolled in the Stiller School of Business or a related entrepreneurial curriculum, with a preference for a student who might be involved in the BYOBiz program at the College. The student recipient must maintain a GPA of 2.7 and have the potential to succeed in business.\n\nEstablished by the Vermont Association of Broadcasters in 2007, this permanent endowed fund is to be used for students enrolled in broadcast-related majors, who maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0 and have the potential to succeed in the broadcast profession. A committee of faculty members from the Division of Communication & Creative Media will select the recipients of this scholarship.\n\nBrought over from Woodbury College when they joined with Champlain College in 2008, these endowed funds had been generously donated to Woodbury by three friends of the institution from 2002 to 2006, with a recent addition in 2008. The income earned continues to support the type of students or programs originally intended by the donors and carried out by Woodbury College, now the Woodbury Institute at Champlain College"
