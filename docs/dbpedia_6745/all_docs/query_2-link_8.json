Donations to this fund go to an endowed scholarship fund used for financial assistance.\n\nThis fund was established in 2006 by the Benvenuti family in recognition of the dedication, talent, and skills of the Nashoba Brooks faculty.

The second goal is to ensure that Nashoba Brooks teachers will continue to develop new practices based on recent research and innovative professional development offerings.\n\nThis fund was established in 2006 in memory of Head of School E.

In honor of Mikal, her family and friends created an endowment fund for the purpose of providing scholarship funds to a newly-enrolled student. Students qualifying for this scholarship will demonstrate financial need and represent diversity.\n\nThe Nash Flynn family established this fund in 1998 to support faculty enrichment, diversity, and financial assistance that would not otherwise be possible through the regular operating budget.\n\nThis fund was established in 2004 by a donation from the PA Auction of that year.
