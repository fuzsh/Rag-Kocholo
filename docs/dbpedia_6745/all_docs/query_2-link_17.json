The McLanahan Bookstore Fund will provide financial assistance to students receiving tuition aid, so that all will have the same access to the store's many offerings as they embark and continue on their Berkshire careers. The monies drawn from this endowment will support bookstore purchases, including school supplies, personal needs, and even Bear wear and snacks.\n\nSUPPORT TODAY\n\nEstablished by Henry H.

The Chair honors that rare history instructor whose teaching brings the past to life, making it relevant today and creating connections to the present that embolden students to think critically and creatively about the subject in a way they hadn’t before. The Chair also celebrates the instructor who naturally inspires the students he or she teaches, coaches, and advises, and instills in them a lifelong love of the discipline, the same way Henry H. Bard, Jr. was inspired by his history teachers while at Berkshire.\n\nEstablished by Henry H. Bard, Jr., Class of 1941 to honor Frank W.

Godman (1951-1970) through a bequest to Berkshire School.
