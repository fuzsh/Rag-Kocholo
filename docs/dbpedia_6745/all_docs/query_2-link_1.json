        "text": "Support the Brooks Fund today!\n\nAt Brooks School, we seek to provide the most meaningful educational experience our students will have in their lives.\n\nEvery year members of the Brooks community — alumni, parents, grandparents, faculty and friends —are asked to consider making a charitable contribution to the Brooks Fund. These collective donations provide vital resources to support our school from faculty salaries to financial aid to every aspect of maintaining our 270-acre campus.\n\nLast year, our community raised nearly $2.5 million for our school and helped cover more than 10 percent of the school's operating budget. Every Brooks Fund donor made an impact on the day-to-day experience of our teachers and students.\n\nThis year, we have set our Brooks Fund goal at $2.5 million. If you have questions about making your gift to Brooks, please contact Director of the Brooks Fund and Family Engagement Mary Merrill.\n\nI support the Brooks\n\nFund because . . .\n\n\"We both come from humble beginnings and found our way as a result of a good education. Because of that, we feel we should give our children the best education we can afford. If given a choice between offering our children an inheritance or a great education, education wins! We believe a great education will better serve them over time.\"\n\nMonique & Norbert Johnson P'24, P'26\n\nB\n\n\"I support Brooks because the school gave me so much, from the tools to succeed in college and beyond, to meaningful relationships and a desire to serve the communities I find myself in. Because of the privileges Brooks provided me, I feel a sense of duty to pay it forward so that future generations of students can find the same kind of fulfillment from their education that I had.\"\n\nAlumni Trustee Sathvik Sudireddy '15\n\nB\n\n\"As an alum and parent of three kids currently at Brooks, I donate to support the amazing academic programs that Brooks offers, as well as the critical opportunities it provides to students from all backgrounds. I have been fortunate to benefit from the support of Brooks in my career and am deeply invested in the lives of Brooks students — past, present and future.\"\n\nLori Caiazzo '91, P'25, P'26, P'27"
