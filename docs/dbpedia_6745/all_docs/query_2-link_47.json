        "text": "Leo H. Brooks Scholarship Fund\n\nDeadline: March 15th\n\nBackground\n\nLeo H. Brooks was born in Bainbridge, Georgia, on September 13, 1932. He graduated from Bainbridge High School then attended Florida State University and Troy State University majoring in physical education. He graduated from Troy State University in 1959 and in 1966 was awarded his Master’s Degree in Educational Administration from Mississippi College. After completing his undergraduate education, he taught social studies and coached athletics at Coffee High School in Douglas, Georgia, and then Mark Smith High School in Macon, Georgia for nine years. He then began more than twenty-four years of work as a school administrator in the Coffee County School System.\n\nAfter retiring with thirty-three years of service, Mr. Brooks was elected and served two four-year terms as a member of the Coffee County Board of Education. He served as Chairman for five of his eight years as a board member. Mr. Brooks passed away in 2014 at the age of 81.\n\nMr. Brooks was married to Beth Childs Brooks. They have one daughter, Lunday, who is married to Kevin Buffington of Columbus, Georgia, and three grandchildren, Brooks, Lillie and Eva Buffington.\n\nMr. Brooks had a life-long interest in supporting educational activities for young people. His longstanding interest led to the establishment of this scholarship fund which is intended to support the educational pursuits of students in the Coffee County Public School System.\n\nPurpose\n\nTo provide college scholarships for graduates of the public school system of Coffee County, Georgia. The scholarship may be used to pay for a student’s tuition, books, fees, supplies, and room and board.\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nApplicants must be graduating seniors or graduates of Coffee High School or of any other public high school as may in the future be operated by the Coffee County Board of Education. An initial scholarship will only be awarded to graduating seniors and current graduates who will matriculate to a college or university for the fall semester or quarter immediately following their high school graduation. The recipient of an initial scholarship will continue to receive the scholarship while they continue in attendance at a college or university of their choice provided they continue to meet the eligibility requirements hereafter set out.\n\nEnrollment as a full-time student in an accredited two or four-year college or university is required.\n\nStudents who have begun their college or university education must be making satisfactory progress as defined by their college or university and must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 or higher to be considered. The GPA will be tested annually at of the end of spring semester or quarter. Satisfactory progress will also be deemed to mean that a student may only miss one semester or quarter each academic year; provided, however, that the Foundation may waive this requirement if it determines to its reasonable satisfaction that their failure to attend is due to an unusual hardship, illness, or disability which is not expected to prevent their return to school for more than one additional semester or quarter. Eligibility for continuation of the scholarship will end on graduation from a college or university or the completion of four and one-half academic years of college or university education, whichever arrives sooner.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\nApplicants will be selected based on the following:\n\nScholastic merit—meaning that the student is average to above-average scholastically\n\nPersonal character\n\nFinancial need (Priority in selection for an initial scholarship award will be given to those students who are not eligible for the HOPE scholarship).\n\nPotential to succeed – indicators include grades, evidence of having overcome adversity, and participation in school, community, or religious organizations.\n\nAdditional Short Answer Questions and Attachments\n\nOn the last page, you will select the Leo H.
