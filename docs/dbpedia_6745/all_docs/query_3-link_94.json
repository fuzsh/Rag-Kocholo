        "text": "The California Endowment has named Kelli Washington as its next CIO, a spokesperson for the Endowment told CIO. Washington will succeed David Greenberg, who left the position at The California Endowment in June 2023 to become CIO of the Virginia Tech Foundation.\n\nMichael Wee is currently serving as interim CIO of TCE. Washington’s appointment will be effective September 16.\n\n“This is a 20-year journey for me, and I am ecstatic to be supporting The California Endowment in its mission in particular,” Washington said in a statement. “I’m looking forward to serving a mission-integrated portfolio that will lead to all Californians experiencing improved health outcomes.”\n\nThe California Endowment is a $4 billion, private nonprofit foundation that makes grants to expand healthcare access in the state of California. The endowment has made 22,000 grants over the past 26 years. The endowment makes grants across five focus areas: health systems, justice reinvestment, inclusive communities, power infrastructure, and schools.\n\n“Kelli brings with her decades of experience in the investment industry along with understanding the importance of ensuring positive health outcomes for all communities, which aligns perfectly with the mission and values of The California Endowment,” said Dr. Robert K. Ross, president and CEO of the California Endowment in a statement.\n\nWashington has more than 20 years of investment experience and is currently a managing director of research and investment strategy at Cleveland Clinic and was previously a managing director at Cambridge Associates. She was also previously an endowment officer at Bowdoin College and a portfolio manager at Edward Jones.\n\nWashington holds a bachelor’s degree from Washington University in St Louis and an MBA from the Yale School of Management. Washington is also a CFA charterholder.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nAnouk van der Boor Appointed CIO of The Directors Guild of America Pension\n\nNYU Appoints Michelle Knudsen as CIO of $5.9B Endowment\n\nAlex Bacchus Appointed Acting CIO of NZ Super"
