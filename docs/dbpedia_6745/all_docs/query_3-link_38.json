        "text": "Nucleus Phase\n\nBased on our master plan, we have determined a near-term list of needs for our school to better meet our mission more of the time. This phase of the greater Centennial Campaign will allow us to complete our plan for the campus core.\n\nThe Nucleus Phase of the campaign is focused on an established list of needs the school has long sought to address and to complete our vision for the center of campus. The total cost of the Nucleus Phase is $20,000,000, which is broken down below:\n\nNew admission building & Head of School’s office ($5,500,000)\n\nHead of School’s House renovation and technology infrastructure ($2,000,000)\n\nNew Main Entrance to the campus ($1,000,000)\n\nKeating Room expansion ($1,500,000)\n\nFaculty housing ($4,000,000)\n\nAcademic space work ($3,000,000)\n\nNew boathouse ($4,800,000)\n\nDEI Endowment ($1,000,000)\n\nEndowment\n\nIn addition to campus improvements, the Centennial Campaign will also raise a significant amount for the Brooks School endowment. A school’s endowment is vital to long term financial health. It makes the school less reliant on tuition revenue and annual giving, and it makes the school more competitive in key areas such as financial aid and teacher compensation. Our goal is to add $60 million to the endowment, making it the largest focused endowment campaign in the school’s history. Endowment gifts will be directed to four general areas:\n\nFinancial Aid ($30,000,000)\n\nFaculty Support ($10,000,000)\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion ($10,000,000)\n\nDormitory Renovation Fund ($10,000,000)"
