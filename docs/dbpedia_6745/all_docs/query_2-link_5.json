        "text": "The school we love was built by generations of people who gave their time, talents, energy, and financial resources to make our school what it is today. Generous gifts from parents of alumni, grandparents and faculty and staff built our $10.14m Endowment, the interest on which provides direct funding to support PBS students, families, faculty, and programs every year.\n\nSince its inception, the endowment has perpetually grown and is invested to ensure long-term financial stability and to support our educational programs, our faculty's professional development, and our tuition assistance program. Endowment monies are held in principal and invested by the school. The Board of Trustees has established two best practices: A policy that guides how the endowment is invested and the 4% interest cap on endowment contribution to the operating budget.\n\nSince 2014, PBS has grown the school’s endowment by $1.56m in new gifts and pledges. We continue to seek donors who are interested in making transformative gifts to the school’s endowment.\n\nGeneral Endowment\n\nGifts to the school’s General Endowment are unrestricted and support the school’s primary strategic priorities as outlined by the Board of Trustees, such as faculty development, instructional resources, technology infrastructure, and other strategic priorities.\n\nElizabeth Root Endowment for Tuition Assistance\n\nThe Elizabeth Root Endowment Fund for Tuition Assistance was established in 1997 to honor one of our founders. Ms. Root served PBS and its predecessor for 36 years and was Head of School from 1978 until 1997. She had a particular passion for ensuring that a PBS education was within reach of as many families as possible.\n\nMosbacher Scholarship Endowment Fund\n\nThe Mosbacher Scholarship Fund was established by the Mosbacher family to strengthen the PBS community by ensuring that it includes the brightest and most engaged students. The Mosbachers believe a well-rounded education is the greatest gift a child can receive.\n\nBeth Passi Endowment for Professional Development\n\nThe Beth Passi Endowment Fund for Professional Development was established in 2005 to commemorate the retirement of PBS’s third Head of School, Beth Passi. Ms. Passi’s legacy is her commitment to faculty and their ongoing education and professional development.\n\nLegacy Learning Endowment for Program Development\n\nThe Legacy Learning Fund for Program Development was established in 2006 to support research and development for academic programming across the curriculum. The objective is to support the core fundamentals of curriculum, math, language arts, and science programs, while adding and enhancing world cultures, service learning, communications, technology and much more."
