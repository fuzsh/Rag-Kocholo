The application typically takes less than 30 minutes, can be completed on a mobile device, and you may save your progress and return anytime. At the end of the application, there is a $60 fee to submit.\n\nPlease remember to return to your dashboard after you complete and submit your Clarity Application, as we may require you to upload additional materials or tax documentation.\n\nA detailed list of information and documents needed is outlined in the Family Application Guide.\n\nTo be considered for Financial Aid, both an Admissions Application File and a Financial Aid Application must be submitted."
