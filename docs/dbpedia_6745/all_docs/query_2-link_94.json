        "text": "The YWCA Quincy chose to open a fund with the Community Foundation in 2007 in response to a board member's requests that in lieu of gifts or accolades, they would rather have their Board service commemorated through a donation to an endowment with the Community Foundation.\n\nAfter allocating a portion of a private bequest to start the endowment, the YWCA has since celebrated the work of women in the community by building the YWCA- Quincy Fund in this manner.\n\nFrom new playground equipment to classroom chairs and supplies, since 2015 Friends of Unit 4 has helped bridge the funding gap that exists between school district needs in the northwestern portion of Adams County, Illinois and available funding.\n\nThe Friends of Unit 4 Fund, established in 2017, provides an additional avenue for gifts from donors who wish to support Unity Schools. The fund will provide a permanent source of funding to ensure the district’s students are provided opportunities to learn and thrive.\n\nIf you’re interested in starting a Designated Agency Endowment Fund, we’ll work with you step-by-step to reach your goal. Please contact us to get started."
