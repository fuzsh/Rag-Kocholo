The student takes responsibility for managing their own learning by engaging fully with the learning process, setting goals and steps to meet those goals, and reflecting on their work with the aim of improving future work. The student engages in all areas of the community with an aim to connect with their own passions.\n\nThe student recognizes that social justice responsibility is both an ongoing process and a goal, and understands the definitions and implications of systems of power, intersectional identities, and intercultural awareness. In their journey towards becoming an active change agent, the student understands how their actions impact various communities and advances equity, inclusion, and belonging for all."
