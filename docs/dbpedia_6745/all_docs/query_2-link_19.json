        "text": "Dear Professor V. Ramgopal Rao garu, this reminds me of Gandhi's response to how would independent India take care of its people: definitely not-British (colonial model; on moral grounds). The same ought to be the foundational tenet of Indian Science and Education policy. First what's wrong with following (in general and following in the footsteps of success, i.e. American pragmatism, with its 'truth is what I can get away with', in particular)? Here it is: Indian Institute of Science, in its eagerness to get a good global rank somewhere in the neighborhood of Amercian universities, started undergraduate programs, instead of calling into question the abuse of dotproduct that is the basis of a patently dubious practice of ranking. Now that Professor Thorp, Editor-in-Chief of Science Family of Journals, is calling for a \"Revolt against educational rankings\" (https://lnkd.in/gypPtnuk), for the very sensible reason alluded to earlier (cf. arbritary choices of weights involved in reducing anything and everything into a number that can be linearly ordered), all the trouble that we went to parrot/ape America is, mildly stated, yelling back: What's the point of independence, if we refuse to exercise it?\n\nNew Denver searched - CEO, Prosperity Denver Fund Prosperity Denver Fund (PDF) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit that offers financial reimbursement to qualifying nonprofits that provide college scholarships or other postsecondary training support to Denver students.

I wrote last week about new projections from FoundationMark -- and tried to put the numbers into context. Here's how grantmakers' assets stack up: - \"Foundation assets could soon reach double the value of the combined endowments of the top 700 richest U.S. universities\" - Disbursements (ie, grants plus some expenses) are \"projected to fall just short of $100 billion in 2023, twice the amount of a decade before. That’s more than all but five U.S. states’ expenditures\" - \"These figures do not even account for megadonors who do their giving without any foundations, most using what are often called philanthropic LLCs, such as MacKenzie Scott, Jeff Bezos, Laurene Powell Jobs, and Steve and Connie Ballmer\" -- ie, some of the biggest players in the field Thanks to John Seitz.\n\nWe are proud to announce our incredible Spring Forward Fund Finalists for 2023. These nonprofits have been selected for the chance to win $25,000! Learn more about our finalists below, and at https://lnkd.in/eG5XJzPj Alliance to Cure Cavernous Malformation is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving health outcomes for patients affected by the rare disease Cerebral Cavernous Malformation.

Team4Tech is a nonprofit impact accelerator bridging the digital equity gap in education to create inclusion and opportunities for under-resourced learners worldwide.\n\nGreat news for our city's children and our future from Ford. The Michigan Central Station Children's Endowment Campaign is a $10 million campaign to establish permanent endowments for 10 nonprofit groups serving Detroit-area youth. \"Generally speaking, Detroit's nonprofit community is under-endowed — if large chunks of it are endowed at all. That means many organizations have small, if any, cash reserves and are caught in a continual cycle of fundraising and grant writing to generate dollars to defray annual costs and, if they're lucky, to fund new programs. Endowments are intended to exist in perpetuity, cushioning financial and economic shocks by generating cash without touching the principal. And they can ease pressure.\"- @Dan Howes, The Detroit News. Article is paywalled."
