VH1 or Video Hits One is an American television network owned by ViacomCBS, based in New York. Warner Amex Satellite Entertainment first created VH1 after the division of the original owner of MTV and Warner Communications. The channel was launched back in 1985 as a cable music channel inspired by the success of its sister channel MTV. In the beginning, the purpose of the channel was to target older demographic contrary to MTV by playing music videos. Later on, VH1 shifted away from music videos and focused on reality TV programming with a major focus on celebrities and music bands.

Years later, after the channel developed itself it focused mainly on the 1980s mainstream pop and classic rock. VH1 even allocated one hour in the afternoon for country music videos. Inspired by MTV, VH1 also used MTV’s famous Kabel typeface font for music video credits.

VH1 also aired some non-music programming including a one-hour comedy show Standup Spotlight by Rosie O’Donnell with veteran comedians and amateurs. Different guests were hosted every week in the show called The Top 21 Video Countdown. Sometimes VH1 also had themed countdowns like Elvira hosting scary videos for Halloween in the year 1991.
