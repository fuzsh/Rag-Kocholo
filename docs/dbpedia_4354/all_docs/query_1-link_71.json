        "text": "Chanel West Coast is ready to be off the red couch and in the driver’s seat.\n\nThe 35-year-old is leaving Ridiculousness behind her, but she’s doing so to bring her fans even more epic content. And for those who will be sad to see her leave the MTV series after 12 years as host, she assures them it was the right thing to do.\n\n“I think this was just the natural time,” she told E! News’ Francesca Amiker in an exclusive interview. “And that it was the natural evolution of me. I think my fans saw everything I was doing outside of Ridiculousness, and I would constantly get comments and stuff like, ‘When are you gonna have your own show? When do we get to watch this?’ So it was just the natural next step.”\n\nBut while the decision may have come as a surprise for some, having her very own show has been a goal of Chanel’s long before she was ever on a TV screen (one that has finally come true, with the premiere of West Coast Hustle on July 18)."
