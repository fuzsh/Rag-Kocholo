        "text": "Still Kicking, Still Relevant\n\nWhile the Internet is the primary vehicle for watching music videos, the reality is that music videos are still a part of television programming today. In fact, contrary to the urban myth that there are no music videos on television anywhere in the world, a careful review reveals a number of stations that consistently play music videos, in the United States, and in various places around the globe.\n\nA sample of these include:\n\n4Music is a music and entertainment channel in the United Kingdom and available on some digital television providers in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n40 TV is a television channel in Spain.

Music videos played on the channel primarily consist of offerings from the indie rock, pop punk and hip-hop genres, along with limited original programming.\n\nM3 is a Canadian channel that is owned by Bell Media. As with its sister networks, the network is headquartered at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nMuch is a Canadian channel owned by Bell Media whose history primarily aired music programming, which in current years has been downplayed in favor of teen dramas and comedies.\n\nMusiMax is a Canadian French language Category A specialty channel focusing primarily on adult contemporary music.\n\nMusiquePlus is a Canadian French language Category A specialty channel that primarily airs music programming, including pop, R&B, and rock music videos; however, the network has increasingly branched out into entertainment programming, such as comedy, films, and reality shows.\n\nMusic 24 is an Israeli popular music channel which has different music-related shows, including interviews with musicians, live performances, music-oriented talk shows and programs which are dedicated to a specific genre of music.\n\nMusic Channel Romania, also known as MusicChannel or 1Music, is a Romanian music television channel, known for also airing Latin pop, adult contemporary, J-pop and K-pop among other genres that don’t receive significant airplay from other music stations. Compared by many to VH1, the TV station conceived many Top-Tens and Top-100s.\n\nMusic Choice (abbreviated as MC) is an American company that programs music and produces music-related content for digital cable television, mobile phone and cable modem users in the United States.\n\nMyx is a Filipino cable television network based in Quezon City. It is targeted to youth audiences with music videos as its primary content, a strategy reminiscent of the early days of MTV.\n\nMTV Live (formerly Palladia) is an American digital cable and satellite television network that exclusively broadcasts in 1080i high definition, music videos and music-related programming from Viacom-owned networks MTV, VH1, MTV Classic and CMT, along with other concert and live music programming from outside producers.\n\nPMC (shortened from Persian Media Corporation or Persian Music Channel) is a free-to-air satellite TV network owned by Persian Media Corporation with its headquarters in Dubai Media City, that is also widely viewed in Iran, the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Central Asia and Northern Africa via free-to-air satellite.\n\nRitmoson (Used to be”Ritmoson latino”) is a Mexico-based pan-Spanish American music video channel, part of Televisa Networks, owned by Televisa, the world’s largest Spanish-language broadcaster.\n\nAn important distinction should be made here and this is that the number of stations airing music videos itself is not so drastically reduced from the MTV hey day era. In fact the sample of 51 stations listed on this page came from a total review of 65 stations who originally aired music video programs. A 23% drop. Significant on the surface. But when one considers this as a reduction over the “era” of music videos, which spans over 35 years (if we use MTV’s August 1, 1981 station debut as its birth), this does not really convey the abandonment of the concept altogether. And actually, a number of stations did not actually cease operations, but merely transformed into another station on the list (BET Soul, for example, began as VH1 Soul). And of course, the success or failure of any television station cannot be attributed solely to the supposed transition of music videos to the Internet. If so, there would be no stations whatsoever. Station closures have innumerable factors involved so this “reduction” cannot be theorized as a “fact” of the disinterest in music videos as a whole. It is an accepted “fact” that MTV, alone, by shifting its focus on programming to reality shows and other productions, was the primary change agent. However, it is another “fact” that the majority of stations who aired music video programs in the past continue to do so today. MTV is actually an example of this. Contrary to popular belief, they have not stopped featuring music videos entirely, but have changed to just show them during the overnight time slots.¹"
