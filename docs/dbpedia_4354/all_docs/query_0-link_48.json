        "text": "Monday at midnight will mark 30 years since MTV bounded onto the media and pop culture scene with its moonman montage, followed by The Buggles' \"Video Killed The Radio Star\" as the first song in the video queue.\n\nThis weekend, one of the sister services it spawned will pay homage to the beginnings of the iconic brand with MTV30 OnVH1 Classic. Bowing on Saturday July 30 at 6 a.m., the three-day marathon will relive many MTV moments, spanning its video universe --some may remember Cyndi Lauper or Adam Ant as being all that -- as well as live musical performances, hit series, specials, promos and news events that intrigued a generation of watchers and their children.\n\nFor those really looking to get nostalgic, the original first hour of MTV's debut will air Sunday night, July 31, at midnight on VH1 Classic. Those who dare to return will see a host of music videos, including the catchy, if ultimately still unprophetic, Buggles' entry, which was trailed by Pat Benatar's \"You Better Run,\" Rod Stewart's \"She Won't Dance With Me,: The Who's \"You Better You Bet\" and Ph.D.'s \"Little Suzi on the Up.\"\n\n\"VH1 Classic viewers grew up with MTV, turning the \"I Want My MTV\" slogan into a battle cry for a generation,\" said Tom Calderone, president of VH1 and VH1 Classic, which celebrated its 11th anniversary this past May. \"That generation has grown up to become viewers of VH1 Classic, which is the perfect place to relive many of MTV's iconic moments that helped shaped music and pop culture around the world.\"\n\nThe marathon will also feature classic segments from the original MTV VJs: J.J. Jackson, Nina Blackwood, Mark Goodman, Martha Quinn and Alan Hunter.\n\nThere will be clips from classic network series, including Remote Control,YO! MTV Raps, Beavis and Butt-Head, Headbangers Ball, The Real World, Liquid TV and Club MTV, plus unforgettable moments from such specials as The MTV Movie Awards and Live Aid.
