        "text": "After receiving weeks of Twitter backlash and online criticism for its portrayal of black sorority girls, the network has decided to bring its reality show Sorority Sisters to an abrupt end this Friday night. The final three episodes will air back-to-back beginning at 9:30 pm.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nSorority Sisters follows nine Atlanta women from four historically black sororities. The show filmed this summer, and VH1 quietly announced the series just four days before it debuted in December. You might not have even known the show existed. Promotional materials were released with a whimper — the series didn't even have a social media presence until three days before it debuted. Then it premiered December 15 to an impressive 1.3 million viewers and an instant wave of backlash.\n\nSorority Sisters isn't a good show by any measure. The sprawling cast's nine main stars are hard to keep track of, and the drama feels canned. (Two rival sorority sisters — or \"sorors,\" as the show calls them — fight over their competing clothing boutiques.) But lots of reality TV is bad. The difference is that most reality-TV stars are only representing themselves. If they have a trashy moment, it's theirs alone. On Sorority Sisters, they're representing Greek organizations with a rich history.\n\n\"Although the sisters on Sorority Sisters don't wear their letters on air, they still destroy the brand with their manufactured bickering, fabricated conflicts and out-of-place sorority calls,\" wrote blogger Ernie Suggs, a member of the black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha.\n\nToni Morrison and Coretta Scott King were Alpha Kappa Alphas. Condoleezza Rice was an Alpha Chi Omega. Zora Neale Hurston was a Zeta Phi Beta. What would they think of \"grown women screaming at each other, cussing, calling each other names and in the same breath calling out the name of their Greek affiliating by saying, 'I'm a proud member of _____ Sorority, Inc.?'\" asked one Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n\nAfter 11 days of online backlash, Alpha Kappa Alpha suspended two of the show's stars, April McRae and Rwanda Hammond. McRae responded on Twitter two days later with the Maya Angelou poem \"Still I Rise.\" (\"You may write me down in history/With your bitter, twisted lies,/You may trod me in the very dirt/But still, like dust, I'll rise.\")\n\nAs criticism ran wild on Twitter with the hashtag #BoycottSororitySisters, sponsors began pulling their support for their show. The NBA, Victoria's Secret, McDonalds, Sports Authority, Hallmark, Honda, Ford, State Farm, Crayola, and Carmex all pulled their ads from airing during the show.\n\nAva DuVernay, an Alpha Kappa Alpha and critically acclaimed director of Selma, also threw her support behind the show's opponents.\n\nWithout sponsors, it's difficult or perhaps impossible for the show to go on. A petition to end the show now has more than 78,000 signatures, though it mistakenly identifies Mona Scott-Young, the executive producer of Love & Hip-Hop who was attached to an early version of Sorority Sisters, as someone who is currently involved with the show.\n\nLast week, VH1 aired a special episode exploring why each cast member decided to join the show and the controversy surrounding the series.\n\n\"Based on the feedback we saw on Twitter after Sorority Sisters: The Dialogue debuted last week, it was clear that the audience wanted to see the stories of the cast play out more fully,\" a rep for the network said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \"We felt it would be best to run the remaining episodes back to back, bringing the season full circle.\"\n\nWhile VH1 hasn't definitively canceled future seasons of the show yet, the network's decisions thus far don't look promising: The final episode will start at 11:10 p.m. and end just past midnight. It won't be repeated later that night for West Coast audiences.\n\nIt looks like this could be the final nail in the coffin for Sorority Sisters — and if it is, I doubt many will miss VH1's most controversial show."
