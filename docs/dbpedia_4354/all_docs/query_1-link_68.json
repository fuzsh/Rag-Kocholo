        "text": "AMERICA'S RELUCTANT HEROINE IS BACK\n\nAND THE N'S GOT HER!\n\nNOGGIN'S NEW NETWORK FOR TWEENS\n\nKICKS OFF SUMMER WITH DARIA\n\nTHE N UNVEILS A MARATHON OF THE TV MOVIE DARIA: IS IT FALL YET? ON TUESDAY, JULY 2, FOLLOWED BY FOUR NIGHTS OF BACK-TO-BACK EPISODES OF \"DARIA\" FROM WEDNESDAY, JULY 3 TO SATURDAY, JULY 6\n\nNew York, NY, May 28, 2002 -- Summer nights just got wittier as America's reluctant heroine is back every evening on The N! Noggin's new network for tweens will debut Daria, the hit animated sitcom from MTV, with two sizzling summer programming marathons. The N will celebrate the addition of Daria to its program schedule with a non-stop, marathon of her first original, 90-minute TV movie, \"Daria: It It Fall Yet?\" on Tuesday, July 2 from 8:00 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. (ET), with an encore presentation on Sunday, July 7 from 8:00 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. (ET).\n\nThe N will unveil the animated sitcom, Daria with four consecutive nights of back-to-back episodes of Daria from Wednesday, July 3 through Saturday, July 6 from 8:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. (ET).\n\nBeginning, Monday, July 8, Daria will settle into its regular airtime -- every evening, Monday  Sunday at 10:00 p.m. (ET/PT) only on The N.\n\nDaria: Is It Fall Yet? features the voices of Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl as Daniel Dotson (Jane's art teacher) and Carson Daly as David Sorensen (Quinn's tutor).\n\nIt's summertime as Daria and friends deal with their summer journeys, the heat rash, the mosquitoes, and the runny ice cream--they're all wishing is it fall yet? Bummed that she can't just sleep summer away, Daria finds herself forced into \"volunteering\" at the \"OK To Cry Corral,\" a summer camp for the overly sensitive and those who aspire to be. At camp, Daria comes face-to-face with a younger camper who eerily shares Daria's disposition.\n\nMeanwhile, Daria's very popular younger sister, Quinn, and her friends are having their own summer adventures. Quinn, submits to tutoring from no-nonsense David Sorensen in hopes of getting into the party school of her choice  but his immunity to her bag of flirting tricks leads her to wonder if she's losing her touch. Following Quinn's lead, the Fashion Club also gets tutored by David, with not so great results.\n\nDaria, which debuted on MTV in March of 1997, is a spin-off of Beavis and Butt-Head's only female friend. The 65-episode series chronicles the experiences of Daria Morgendorffer, a smart, funny and sardonic teenager blessed with an uncanny ability to turn potential disaster to her own advantage. Daria lives in Lawndale with her stressed-out, career-fixated parents, Helen and Jake, and her relentlessly cute and popular younger sister, Quinn.\n\nIn each episode of Daria, we find our heroine in exasperating situations that she combats with sarcasm and irony, but she then takes action and manages to turn things around for herself. Granted it is usually mischievous, but at least it amuses her until the time she figures out a way to escape.\n\nDaria was developed by Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis Lynn. The show is produced by Susie Lewis Lynn. Glenn Eichler is the story editor. John Andrews is supervising producer. Abby Terkuhle is executive producer.\n\nDaria: Is It Fall Yet? is executive produced by Glenn Eichler and Abby Terkuhle. Daria: Is It Fall Yet? is written by Glenn Eichler and Peggy Nicoll and the supervising director is Karen Disher. Cindy E. Brolsma and Amy Palmer are co-producers.\n\nMTV Networks, a unit of Viacom Inc., owns and operates five cable television programming services -- MTV: Music Television, MTV 2, VH1, Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite, and TV Land -- all of which are trademarks of MTV Networks. Information about MTV: Music Television and MTV 2 is available on MTV Online, on America Online (Keyword: MTV) and the World Wide Web (http://mtv.com).\n\nNoggin / The N, a joint venture between Nickelodeon and Sesame Workshop, currently reaches 25 million households via cable, digital cable and satellite. With two distinct program blocks, \"Noggin\" for preschoolers and \"The N\" for tweens  the network helps kids to figure out their lives with educational media on-air and online (www.noggin.com and www.the-n.com)."
