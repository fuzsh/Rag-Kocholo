        "text": "When he first started working at Viacom in 2004, Chris McCarthy harbored what he considered a shameful secret: his educational background. Then a freelance director of marketing for mtvU, MTV’s online network for college students, he kept quiet about the fact that he had received his MBA at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school, after studying commerce and engineering at Drexel University.\n\n“I was maybe the fifth MBA to get a job here, and I purposely did not talk about it, because at the time, it was so not a cool thing to do,” says McCarthy.\n\nWORK SMARTER - LEARN, GROW AND BE INSPIRED.\n\nSubscribe today!\n\nTo Read the Full Story Become an Adweek+ Subscriber\n\nView Subscription Options\n\nAlready a member?
