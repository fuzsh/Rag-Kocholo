        "text": "VH1 and its sister channel Logo have teamed up with social video platform Spreecast in an initiative aimed at connecting the networks’ talent with their fans.\n\nSpreecast, which was founded last year by Jeff Fluhr and has offices in San Francisco and New York, gives fans the opportunity to interact with stars in face-to-face video broadcasts online that thousands can participate in live, using only a browser and a webcam. Viewers have the capability to join celebrities on camera, or participate through text-based questions and chat. The broadcasts are recorded and immediately available for playback and sharing.\n\nSpreecasts already has teamed with Viacom Media Networks’ VH1 Digital and Logo Digital for VH1’s Love & Hip Hop Atlanta Face-to-Face Aftershow, Logo’s NewNowNext Vote Sound Off With Sandra Bernhard and the new digital-driven series Very VH1 With Kate Spencer.\n\nUpcoming Spreecasts will include an Elimination Lunch every Tuesday at noon ET over the course of the new season of Logo’s RuPaul’s All Stars Drag Race, which premieres Oct. 22. Fans will be able to talk to eliminated queens the day after their final episode.\n\n“[VH1 and Logo] really understand how to bring quality entertainment experiences to viewers in fresh and engaging ways,” Spreecast CEO Fluhr said. “Working with networks of this caliber certainly reinforces our belief that interactivity and social media are increasingly important in traditional media.”"
