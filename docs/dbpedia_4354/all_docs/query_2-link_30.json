        "text": "MTV, their university station mtvU, and sister station VH1 have all announced they will be simulcasting the Live 8 concert series as it happens July 2nd on their respective television stations.\n\nThe stations will not focus on one concert only, but will rather jump back and forth from various cities showing select performances. Logic leads us to believe Linkin Park will be one of those bands, but we're not guaranteeing anything. The special will air from 12:00PM EST until 8:00PM EST.\n\nWe'd like to remind visitors that AOLMusic.com will have the entire concert available streaming from their website as it happens.\n\nSource: Yahoo!\n\nThanks to Casey and blurredxnotes!\n\nI wish it wasn't mtv airing the shows, because it is the evil empire of \"music\" television, which has nothing to do w/ music. none of the channels resemble their starting points when they exclusively played music. MTV does have a larger audience than any other music network though. I would have been great if a network like cbs or nbc picked up the coverage though, exposure to the shows and more importantly to the issues would be a lot better."
