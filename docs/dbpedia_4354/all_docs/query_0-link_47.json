I love some of them, though, and I have their cds... Anymore songs anyone can add to the list of music used by vh1 and mtv on their shows? I've got to have that darn song!!!!! BTW, the vh1 fear factor episode will air again on may 5, I think, if anyone can watch it to see if they recognize the song I'm looking for it would be really nice. The clip I'm referring to takes place in the first half hour of the program, so you wouldn't have to watch it all!!!! I know I didn't (not into fear factor)!!!\n\nThat's a good one too, but not the one I NEED!!! Oh, vh1 is using \"Big Star\" by the Jayhawks on their new ads. I'm guessing you guys already knew this, but I was so proud of myself for finding it out on my own, without having to ask!!! lol\n\nLater\n\nOriginally posted by bbrocks@Apr 30 2004, 03:06 PM\n\nThat's a good one too, but not the one I NEED!!!

I believe it's called \"is you is or is you ain't my man\". I'm not sure who sings it, but would like to know. It's sung by a woman and the bass beat is the main part. Can anybody help me?\n\ndid you try looking at the mtv.com website? just look under 'the inferno' episode guide and they list what songs they used. but incidentally i think i might know the song...it could be dinah washington, and if it sounded like it was a remix, it could be \"is you is or is you ain't my baby\" ~dinah washington remixed by rae & christian off the album \"verve remixed\"...\n\nsound sample:\n\ntrack 4"
