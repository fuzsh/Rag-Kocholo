        "text": "Paramount+ doesn’t have an exclusive Tom Cruise channel hub, but it really should—all of the Mission: Impossibles are here, as well as the OG Top Gun and several other Cruise classics.\n\nSome shows and content will appear in two or more channel hubs, such as South Park: The Streaming Wars showing up under Comedy Central and Movies, and sports events in both Live TV and Sports. When in doubt, Paramount+’s search function works quickly and accurately.\n\nThe CBS channel hub (or brand) is the largest on Paramount+, featuring next-day streaming and full seasons of current network hits like Ghosts, The Equalizer, and Young Sheldon, as well as classics from decades ago like The Love Boat, Family Ties, I Love Lucy, Frasier, and The Twilight Zone. The CBS hub also gives you late-night and daytime content, like The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\nTo unlock SHOWTIME content on Paramount+, you’ll need the self-explanatory Paramount+ with SHOWTIME premium plan. That opens the door to streaming SHOWTIME classics like Dexter, Californication, Penny Dreadful, and Ray Donovan. You’ll also get current hits like Yellowjackets and The Chi alongside an expanded library of hit movies, documentaries, and adult-oriented programs. There’s even live Paramount+ with SHOWTIME East and West channels for those who prefer watching SHOWTIME the traditional way.\n\nParamount+’s Comedy Central channel hub isn’t limited to just stand-up specials and CC shows like Another Period, Workaholics, and The Daily Show; it also features corporate cousin series like Daria (from MTV), Hot in Cleveland (from TV Land), and Paramount+ original movies from South Park and Reno 911! Unfortunately, Comedy Central staple South Park isn’t on Paramount+ (you can watch South Park specials, but the main series is on Max).\n\nAs you’d expect, Paramount+’s MTV channel hub is overflowing with reality shows but features just a smattering of music content—just like MTV since the dawn of the 2000s. The MTV hub is a varied grab bag of shows also pulled from VH1, CMT, and Paramount Network, as well as Paramount+ originals like RuPaul’s Drag Race. For the Gen-X MTV crowd, you can also find classics like Ren & Stimpy, Beavis & Butt-head, and Jackass here.\n\nUnlike the all-over-the-place MTV hub, Paramount+’s BET channel is almost entirely made up of BET shows, with only a handful of Black-led series from other Paramount-owned networks. Hit the Floor, The Real Husbands of Hollywood, The Game, Being Mary Jane, and other BET hits are here, as well as recent-vintage series like Sister Sister, Moesha, and Everybody Hates Chris. On the reality side, BET also carries all of VH1’s Love & Hip-Hop and Black Ink Crew shows.\n\nIf you’re into historical series and documentaries, Paramount+’s Smithsonian Channel hub is the place to be. Besides scenic travel shows and cute animals in nature, the Smithsonian Channel hub also features hair-raising series like Air Disasters, Disasters at Sea, and Volcanoes: Dual Destruction. It’s like the HISTORY channel, but with more actual, you know, history."
