Programs like Total Recall Live and select episodes of MTV Unplugged (think Bob Dylan, Erykah Badu, and Nirvana) will also feature in the mix.\n\nThe launch will take place August 1, commemorating 35 years since the channel that was once dedicated exclusively to music videos debuted. The first show will be MTV Hour One, a rebroadcast of MTV's first 60 minutes of programming from 1981.\n\n(h/t Rolling Stone)"
