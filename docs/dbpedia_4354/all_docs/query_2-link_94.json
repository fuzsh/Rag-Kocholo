The channel primarily features music videos from the 1980s through to the 2000s (decade), although rare live performances from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s can be seen as well. VH1 Classic was first launched in the United Kingdom on 1 July 1999 and made available from the beginning to the whole of Europe. However, the current pan-European service was launched in 30 November 2004, when it became a separate feed from VH1 Classic UK. Like VH1 European, it broadcast from MTV Networks Europe's premises in Camden Town (London, UK). It is officially available to viewers all over Europe and Latin America (except the UK & Ireland and Italy and San Marino). Unlike VH1 Classic UK, the pan-European version of the channel is entirely devoid of advertisements, with round-the-clock music videos played out from MTV Networks Europe's comprehensive library in London."
