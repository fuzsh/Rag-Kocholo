        "text": "VH1\n\nVH1 (originally an initialism of Video Hits One) is an American pay television network based in New York City owned by ViacomCBS. It was originally created by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, at the time a division of Warner Communications and the original owner of MTV, and launched on January 1, 1985, in the former space of Turner Broadcasting System's short-lived Cable Music Channel. The channel was originally conceived to build upon the success of sister channel MTV by playing music videos targeting a slightly older demographic than MTV by focusing on the lighter, softer side of popular music. Like MTV, VH1 ultimately drifted away from music videos and into reality television programming, albeit with a focus on music personalities and celebrities, and shows targeting female audiences. VH1 is best known for franchises such as Behind the Music, the I Loveâ€¦ series, the Celebreality block, and Love & Hip Hop. As of January 2016, approximately 90.2 million US households receive VH1."
