        "text": "As NuvoTV and its chief creative officer and shareholder Jennifer Lopez wait for its parent company to complete a $226 million acquisition of Fuse TV, cable sources tell Billboard that making the purchase pay off could be an uphill battle.\n\nAt question is whether Nuvo, which has 34 million subscribers, can harness Fuse’s 74 million to raise its profile and ratings. Nuvo is unable to simply convert Fuse, which focuses on music videos and programming, to its format, which relies on reality shows, due to “definition of service” clauses in cable operators’ contracts with networks. These clauses enable operators to drop a channel or reduce its carriage fees if its ownership or programming changes. Nuvo could ill afford either. According to one cable executive, Fuse gets an average of 7 cents per subscriber per month in cable fees compared with MTV, which gets upwards of 50 cents.\n\nThe announcement of the deal indicated that Fuse and Nuvo will operate independently, and Michael Schwimmer, CEO of Nuvo parent SiTV, framed the deal as a two-channels-are-stronger-than-one strategy. Multiple networks packaged by a single owner do tend to fare better. For instance, Viacom’s low-rated Logo channel benefits from the clout of sister networks MTV and VH1. But, the executive says, “Fuse and NuvoTV together don’t create enough scale with operators or advertisers to matter.” In the first quarter, Fuse finished 89th out of 96 basic cable channels with total viewers in the 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. prime-time daypart, according to Nielsen. (Nuvo numbers are proprietary.)\n\n“They’ve got big distribution now,” says the executive. “The $226 million question is what they can do with it.”\n\nAs Fuse president – and current CEO of wellness network Veria Living – Eric Sherman says, “Schwimmer’s strategy of running separate networks is incredibly prudent, but in the long run, I imagine they would look to combine the two brands.” Ironically, sources note that Sean “Puffy” Combs’ music-focused Revolt TV, which was outbid for Fuse, would have made a more synergistic fit. Says Sherman: “While it’s a win for Nuvo and J-Lo, it would have been an even bigger win for Puffy and Revolt.”"
