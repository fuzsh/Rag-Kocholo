        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nHERE are two lessons that MTV can salvage from its widely disparaged coverage of Live 8: First, any broadcast of a global benefit concert, however well-intended, will suffer if you cut away too soon from a Pink Floyd reunion. Second, when you've shortchanged your audience, it sometimes pays to make public amends.\n\nWhen the MTV executive Van Toffler returned from his weekend trip to Live 8's London stage, he found the network awash in complaints about its hectic, rapid-fire treatment of the international event. So he began working the phones. After two days of talking to concert organizers and performers, he extended an olive branch to MTV's audience: 10 commercial-free hours of Live 8 would be shown on MTV and VH1 the next weekend.\n\nHe also spoke directly to the news media to address the lapses in the original broadcast and to announce the rebroadcast plans, a move that was met with a mixture of skepticism and told-you-so satisfaction by music fans in cyberspace. As rare as it is for networks to call for do-overs, the move represented something even more unusual for Mr. Toffler: a step onto center stage. \"I prefer not to be in the spotlight,\" he said in an interview recently at MTV headquarters in Times Square. \"I've always felt you prove yourself by doing the work and what you put out there on the screen.\"\n\nThere are a lot of screens for him to manage these days. Mr. Toffler's formal title -- president of the MTV Networks Music/Logo/Film Group, which includes MTV, VH1, digital all-video networks and a film production studio -- may be as cluttered as his 25th-floor office. The space is more like a walk-in museum of pop curiosities, decorated with artifacts like a Lil Jon-style rhinestone-encrusted pimp chalice and a framed photo of the kiss shared by Madonna and Britney Spears at the 2003 Video Music Awards, which the erstwhile Material Girl signed, \"To Van -- Dream On!\"\n\nThen there is Mr. Toffler himself, a lanky figure who at 46 looks less like the sort of savvy teenager who would curate such a collection than that kid's easygoing suburban dad. \"He runs a loose house,\" said Chris Rock, who co-starred in MTV Films' remake of \"The Longest Yard.\" \"There's never that thing where the boss walks into the room and people start talking differently. People pretty much talk the same around Van. Or louder.\"\n\nLately one of the loudest discussions, inside the building and out, is a long-simmering debate that has been reignited by the Live 8 controversy: can MTV exist as both a mass arbiter of pop culture and a pure music channel?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
