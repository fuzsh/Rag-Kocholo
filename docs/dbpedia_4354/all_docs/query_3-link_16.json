        "text": "Country Musics top songwriters live from Analog at The Hutton Hotel!\n\nSome of Country musics best join our Southern Rounds stage at ANALOG in NASHVILLE on AUGUST 14th: H. JACK WILLIAMS, DON POYTHRESS, GARRETT JACOBS with host Dave Kennedy. Hear these incredible songwriters who have written hits for WILLIE NELSON, BLAKE SHELTON, and BLACK STONE CHERRY.\n\nH JACK WILLIAMS is no stranger to stardom, from knocking on Richie Havens hotel room door to playing a demo to THE Clive Davis to working his way onto touring with The Who as an in-house songwriter. Known for his evocative storytelling and authentic voice, cementing his place as a troubadour of modern Americana which will all be showcased in his upcoming debut album. DON POYTHRESS has been writing and performing professionally since 1989. His numerous cuts have gleaned him CMA and ACM nominations and two ASCAP Awards. He has also been honored to play on some of the great stages such as The Grand Ole Opry, the Ryman Auditorium, The Louisiana Hayride, and The Bluebird Caf. GARRETT JACOBS was invited to play a writer’s round at the renowned Whiskey Jam, and by the end of the night was scheduling writing sessions throughout the week. In the first of these sessions, Garrett wrote what would become his debut single, “The Healing.” He recently released his single Just Like You along with a music video that was exclusively premiered on CMT where it debuted at #5 in CMTs 12-pack countdown.\n\nH. Jack Williams\n\nYoud be hard-pressed to find a life, a career, or a body of work quite like that of singer, songwriter, performer, composer, H. Jack Williams. From knocking on Richie Havens hotel room door to playing a demo to THE Clive Davis, to working his way onto touring with The Who as an in-house songwriter, Jack is no stranger to stardom. After getting off the road, Jack moved to Nashville and signed a publishing deal where he wrote with The\n\nOak Ridge Boys, who soon recorded Jacks songs Seasons and Everybody Wins. Jack then had his first major hit, co-writing with Allman Brothers Band member Warren Haynes Gregg Allmans Just Before The Bullets Fly.\n\nHe later connected with Academy Award winner Kevin Costner, whose band Kevin Costner & Modern West had recorded two of Jacks songs (including the Top 20 hit Love Shine), leading Costner to cut an additional five Jack tracks for his hit TV series TALES FROM YELLOWSTONE Soundtrack. In 2020, Jack released his first solo body of work called Halfway to Hell which reignited his love for the stage. He is currently in production on his debut Spoken Word record to be released starting in 2024 featuring a star-studded lineup of guest musicians and showcasing his evocative storytelling and authentic voice, cementing his place as a troubadour of modern Americana.\n\nYou can learn more about Jack here:\n\nhttps://hjackwilliamsmusic.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/h.jackwilliams/\n\nDon Poythress\n\nDon Poythress was born in Meridian, Mississippi, but has lived and worked in Nashville since 1986. He has penned songs that have been recorded by Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, Tim McGraw, Daryll Worley, Sir Cliff Richard, Brian Littrell (Backstreet Boys), Lincoln Brewster, Blake Shelton, Earl Scruggs, Kari Jobe, Philips Craig and Dean, Jake Owen, and Jason Crabb among many others.\n\nHis song A Little More Country Than That recorded by Easton Corbin went to #1 and was nominated for CMA and ACM Song of the Year. And Kelly Pickler had a hit with Things That Never Cross A Mans Mind. Other recent singles include Jake Owens Tell Me and The Henningsens I Miss You.\n\nHis Dove Award-winning Song “The Promise” as sung by The Martins, was awarded top recorded song in the Southern Gospel Category in 2004. He also won a 2011 Dove award for Jason Crabbs version of Joseph in the Inspirational Song of the Year category. His third Dove Award was for Karen Peck and New Rivers Revival in the Southern Gospel Category.\n\nDon is also known as a performer in his own right, appearing on such stages as the Grand Ole Opry, The Ryman Auditorium, The Louisiana Hayride, and a regular performer at The Bluebird Caf. He has taught songwriting workshops at Vanderbilt University, Belmont University, Nashville Songwriters Association International, BMI, ASCAP, The Christian Musician Summit, and many other places.\n\nHis latest album with Integrity Hossanna!

Juliet Tn for the last 28 years.\n\nYou can learn more about Don here:\n\nhttps://donpoythress.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/extremepoythress/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/donpoythress\n\nGarrett Jacobs\n\nGarrett spent his early years in Valdosta, Georgia. His father, a military man, relocated the family to Bossier City, Louisiana. After graduating high school in 2018, Garrett decided to make his first trip to Nashville, TN. There he was invited to play a writer’s round at the renowned Whiskey Jam, and by the end of the night was scheduling writing sessions throughout the week. In the first of these sessions, Garret wrote what would become his debut single, “The Healing.” Not long after the song’s release, Garrett signed deals with CAA and later Sony Music Publishing. Garrett recently released his single Smoke to all streaming platforms and he is currently writing and recording for future projects to take his Soultry Pop sound to the next level.\n\nYou can learn more about Garrett here:\n\nhttps://www.garrettjacobsmusic.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/garrett.jacobs/\n\nDave Kennedy (Host)\n\nDave Kennedy is a storyteller above all else, and its easy to see why. His songs paint a cinematic portrait of America as his characters journey through love, heartbreak, humor, sin, redemption, revenge, and perhaps even a few of the songwriters own footsteps along the way. Bringing these songs to life is a voice so soaring and powerful you cant help but be swept away into his world by the end of the first chorus. He navigates his way through each story and each world with a dynamic presence of both strength and subtlety that appreciates both the peaks and the valleys, the highways and the backroads, the loves lost and lingering in his mind.

It was the moment Huntley stepped onto the stage of The Voice for his blind audition. Seconds into his stunning debut performance, all four judges turned their chairs around to witness his incredible, undeniable talent.\n\nWeeks later, millions of viewers of the longstanding hit television series cast their votes for the singer, crowning him the victor of season 24. Now, Huntley takes the next steps on this amazing journey with the premiere of a pair of independently released, scintillating original singles Tell Me When Its Over and Fire and Flames.\n\nA Florida native turned Nashville transplant via small-town Virginia, Huntley discovered his vocal prowess as a teenager. He cultivated his powerful pipes first in heavy metal cover bands, then crafted his own captivating style of songwriting as he learned to play acoustic guitar. After high school, he left Virginia, bound for Music City, and spent a cold winter busking on Nashville streets, camping in Centennial Park, or crashing at a hostel or with friends.\n\nHe developed his own material, working out songs or improvising on the spot, collecting enough tips to survive, or sometimes not quite enough. Huntley retreated back to Virginia, continuing to grind away at his musical dream while raising his two children. In 2022, he issued an original track, Holdin On.\n\nHe was 33, making dinner for his family one evening when the phone rang; a rep from The Voice had seen a video on social media and was calling to ask if he was interested in auditioning. Huntley thought it was a telemarketing scam. It wasnt.\n\nHe toured in the wake of his Voice success, performing for tens of thousands and sharing the stage with his band of exceptionally talented and diverse musicians collected, as well, from the Mid-Atlantic region. In the spring of 2024, Huntley entered the Vault Studio in Hyattsville, Maryland, collaborating with engineer Jake Vicious to assemble the two new singles; a tandem of tunes reflecting on the delicate nature of relationships.\n\nThere is Tell Me When Its Over, his latest tantalizer, detailing the desire for fulfillment in life and love, beautifully articulated with acoustic guitar and the blistering vulnerability that can only be Huntley. He explains, At times, you feel like your own worst enemy in a relationship. But its bigger than that, too. I woke up with everything the world was supposed to be, in my hands, and I still felt an emptiness. A feeling of not yet being where I belong.\n\nIts a haunting piece, alternately recalling a spate of Huntleys heroes from Joe Cocker and Steven Tyler to Ray Charles and Amy Winehouse that stays with the listener long after the final words fade out.\n\nAnd theres Fire and Flames, an older entry, a pulsing ballad showcasing a stirring vocal performance that, as the title suggests, ignites and smolders, simmering intensely against a singular guitar and rising chorus. Its about being scared to speak up in the moment because youre afraid of what that could do to the world youre living in, Huntley says. You dont want to set your world on fire.\n\nIronically, perhaps, thats just what Huntley has done. Hes set the world on fire with his music, with his purity of heart, with his authenticity of soul. Its been a long road that each day extends remarkably beyond the moment those four chairs turned around.\n\nI came from nothing. Ive been through a lot of struggles. Everything can go wrong when things are going right, and everything can go right when things are going wrong. The Voice was an amazing experience, but its just part of my journey as to where Im headed now.\n\nABOUT GABE BAKER\n\nGabe Baker is a Texas-bred, Nashville-based multi-talented soul/folk singer-songwriter and cellist.

That album culminated years of slow building and provided the Raleigh, N.C. native the breakthrough he deserved. After an 18-month, rigorous run, he wasnt ready to take a deserved break.\n\nUpon Electric Cowboys release, Rashads creative ideas continued to flow. He reached out to friends and collaborators, like writer Gentle Nature and J.J. Whitefield of German funk group The Poets of Rhythm, and began to mold his new ideas into full-fledged songs. After the campaign for Electric Cowboy wound down, Rashad returned to his home state of North Carolina and got to work on his fifth studio album.\n\nAs the song ideas flowed, Rashad explored the importance of self-reflection and personal experiences, particularly themes of love and vulnerability. Drawing from that prism and channeling the joy of his recent engagement, the artist had plenty of positive momentum heading into the recording sessions.\n\nAfter Electric Cowboy was released, I thought hard about my intentions for the next album, shares Rashad. The objective was to make a record that echoes the spirit of my live shows and reflects the truest me.\n\nCarolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road is a tip of the cap to his home and will be released by the New West Records imprint Normaltown Records. At Killion Studios in Los Angeles, Rashad teamed with producer Sergio Rios (Neal Francis, Say She She, Orgone) to create an album chock full of memorable uptempo Southern Fried Funk. For the first time in Rashads career, he recorded live and straight to tape, capturing the true essence of these songs, which were brought to life by Dan Hastie (keys), Dale Jennings (bass), and Sam Halterman (drums).\n\nWorking with Sergio Rios as a producer allowed me to refine my vision while preserving the raw, infectious sound that feels most authentic to me, Rashad adds.\n\nWith an assist from Whitefield, Rashad captured the raw, crunchy sounds hed been hoping to incorporate into his recordings. The album also features the handy work of Mike Buckley (Daptones, Budos Band, Jalen Ngonda), who composed the horn parts, Blake Rhein (Durand Jones & The Indications), and Kendra Morris (Colemine Records). This is the album that finally captures the energy of Rashads high-octane live show onto wax. Black Pumas virtuoso Adrian Quesada and Will Grantham mixed Carolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road, giving Rashad the exact sound he sought to capture.\n\nRashad points to What We Live For as one of his favorite songs from the 10-song collection. In the past, hes hidden his personal lyrics underneath the power of his groove-laden instrumentals. Not here. He admits that hearing the finished version gave him chills and he teared up a bit. At its heart, its what Carolina Funk is about celebrating love. As tender as What We Live For is, Rashad didnt want to get too hung up on sentimentality. The songs rhythm and melody are club-ready with its funk soul.\n\nThe same goes for Run and Move. Describing the fears of vulnerability in a relationship, Rashad brings an astute perspective to describing human nature. Despite it being one of his favorite songs, he admits that it was one of the toughest to track in the studio. Even so, the collection captures Rashads ethos as an artist and is his most well-rounded to date.\n\nLike any great artist, Rashad writes in a fashion that is true to himself, yet has the ability for his rapidly expanding fan base to relate to. With Carolina Funk: Barn Burner on Tobacco Road, Rashad shows that he cant stop and wont stop channeling his creativity into funk-powered hits."
