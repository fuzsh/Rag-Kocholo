        "text": "Viacom-owned cable network Tr3s: MTV, Musica y Mas, targeting the Hispanic millennial generation, is adapting programs from its sister networks specifically for its niche audience.\n\nTr3s will be adapting MTV’s competition series From G’s to Gents and VH1’s Best Week Ever for two new shows set to debut in the fall, The Hollywood Reporter has learned exclusively. Additionally, the cable net has ordered a second season of the Wilmer Valderrama-produced docuseries, The Ricardo Laguna Project, centered on the Mexican-American BMX champion. Production begins this summer for a September premiere.\n\nPHOTOS: ‘American Idol’ Season 10 Finale\n\nDone in the vein of From G’s to Gents, which aired on MTV from 2008-09, Chongas to Reinas follows a similar format. Through a series of challenges and tests, the series will transform wild Latinas into well-mannered queens — while following the cattiness and drama in between. Casting for the host is underway, with the net eyeing a celebrity who has a “rags to riches” story and is authoritative but respected in the industry.\n\nBorrowing from VH1’s Best Week Ever, The Chisme Club features infamous Latino personalities and stand-up comics who reveal their favorite and most absurd pop culture news. Personalities set to participate include Mob Wives‘ Rene Graziano and Mayte Garcia, The Latin Divas of Comedy‘s Sandra Valls and Sara Contreras, Broads of Broadway‘s Cristina Galston, Joey Medina, Eric Nieves and others.\n\nPHOTOS: Broadcast TV’s Returning Shows for 2012-13 Season\n\nExpanding its efforts in music programming — and on the heels of the success of its first episode, “The Making of ‘Follow the Leader’ ” with Jennifer Lopez — Tr3s has committed to airing four more “making of” music video specials by year’s end. The Lopez episode, which aired in May 4, averaged 555,000 viewers.\n\nJust three months after Colombian singer Juanes taped an MTV Unplugged, which will air this month, the net has given the go-ahead on another concert special to air next year. An artist is being eyed for the new special, and an announcement expected shortly.\n\nThe Miami-based Tr3s is owned by Viacom International Media Networks and reaches 33.6 million households."
