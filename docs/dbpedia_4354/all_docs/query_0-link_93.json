        "text": "Pasadena, Calif. -- MTV: Music Television laid out its\n\nplans for its first slate of original movies, including a film about slain rapper Tupac\n\nShakur, at the recent Television Critics Association tour here.\n\nMTV will focus on three categories for its films: movies\n\nfeaturing music performances driven by distinctive sound tracks; stories based on or\n\ninspired by real life; and movies that capture the fun and frustration of growing up at\n\nthe end of the 20th century.\n\nMTV plans to produce four movies per year, according to\n\nexecutive vice president of programming Brian Graden. \"We're being very, very\n\nselective about the stories we choose,\" he said.\n\nBecause MTV is doing so few made-for-TV movies, it will\n\npremiere each one completely commercial-free, Graden added.\n\nAs for MTV's rationale for doing the films, he explained,\n\n\"We have three-minute videos and quick-cut soap operas and wild graphics to make your\n\nhead spin. But every once in a while, even we find a story that takes more than a\n\n30-second sound bite to tell and to tell well -- a story that matters to our\n\naudience.\"\n\nMTV is slated to air its first original movie, 2GETHER,\n\nthis winter, before the end of the year. It is about an inept music mogul who is trying to\n\ncreate the next hot boy band, and it spoofs behind-the-scenes music-industry politics.\n\nSome of the other movie titles MTV has in development are: Tupac:\n\nThe Early Years, which explores the pivotal early years of Shakur's life; Love Song,in which singer Monica makes her acting debut; Hop-Hopera, a rap version of\n\nclassic opera Carmen; The Exes, in which four ex-loves form a garage band; Anatomy\n\nof a Hate Crime, about the hate murder of gay student Matthew Shepard; The It Girl,\n\nabout a young woman who becomes a soap-opera star; Holding Patterns, about four\n\nteens who re-examine their lives when the plane they were supposed to have been on\n\ncrashes; Lady in a Cage, a remake of the cult classic; Jailbait, about a\n\nhigh-school jock accused of statutory rape; and Tag Team, about two losers who\n\nbecome heroes when they join the pro-wrestling circuit.\n\nMTV has also named Maggie Malina to the new position of\n\nvice president of original movies for television, and she will oversee their development\n\nand production.\n\nMTV's sister network, VH1, unveiled the airdates for its\n\nfirst two original movies at the TCA.\n\nSweetwater, a fact-based story about the trials and\n\ntribulations of the first band to play at Woodstock, will premiere Aug. 15 at 9 p.m.,\n\nstarring Kelli Williams, Michelle Phillips, Frederic Forrest and Adam Ant. In tandem with\n\nthe movie, VH1 will also air Woodstock: Behind the Music Aug. 8 at 9 p.m.\n\nVH1's second made-for-TV movie, Ricky Nelson: Original\n\nTeen Idol, will debut Aug. 22 at 9 p.m. Based on unauthorized biography Ricky\n\nNelson: Idol for a Generation, the movie chronicles the life of the TV star, teen idol\n\nand cultural icon. Its cast includes Jamey Sheridan, Sara Botsford and Gregory Calpakis.\n\nMTV and VH1 also have some unusual original series in the\n\nworks.\n\nAfter one year of development, MTV and Spiderdance Inc.\n\nhave created a daily music-trivia game show that brings TV and the Internet together, webRIOT.\n\nStarting this October, four contestants will play the game live in MTV's Times Square\n\nstudio, along with up to 250,000 online contestants.\n\nThe MTV Online players will play live against the show's\n\nbroadcast, completely in synch with the broadcast so that the multiple-choice answers on\n\ntelevision and on the computer screen pop in and out at the same time.\n\nThe top 10 online players of the day will have their names\n\nscrolled across the TV screen at the end of the show, and they will be eligible to win\n\nprizes. MTV staged a raucous demonstration of the game with TV writers during its session\n\nat the TCA tour."
