        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nReality TV winners can become highly successful, fall out of the limelight, or something in-between.\n\nWhile \"American Idol's\" Kelly Clarkson has an empire, \"The Voice's\" Javier Colon does not.\n\nHere's where some of our favorite singers, dancers, cooks, and creatives are today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichard Hatch won the very first season of \"Survivor\" in 2000.\n\n\"Survivor\" drops strangers onto a deserted island to test their survival skills, like finding food and shelter, as well as competing in challenges. Contestants then vote out one person, or castaway, per week. It's a formula that's worked for 42 seasons and counting on CBS, as well as for many international versions.\n\nHatch became both one of the first villains of the show and the first winner. He wound up winning the title of Sole Survivor with a $1 million prize in August 2000 at the conclusion of season one in Borneo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHatch has since appeared on several other reality TV shows ... and also spent several years in prison.\n\nSince then, Hatch, 61, spent 51 months (a little over four years) in jail for tax evasion after not paying taxes on his grand prize. He went back for another nine months after violating his probation, according to ScreenRant.\n\nHatch has also continued to appear on reality TV. He's made several more appearances on shows like \"The Apprentice,\" \"The Biggest Loser,\" and the Australian edition of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\"\n\nToday, Hatch still has strong ties to his \"Survivor\" days. Besides his appearance on \"Survivor: All-Stars\" in 2004, he uses his Instagram platform to sell his own \"Survivor\"-themed merchandise and autographed objects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEddie McGee won the first season of \"Big Brother,\" also back in 2000.\n\n\"Big Brother\" is an international phenomenon that follows strangers living in a house under surveillance while they form alliances and compete in challenges. Each week, a houseguest is evicted until there is a final contestant, who wins $500,000.\n\nThe American version is based on the original Dutch version that began in 1997. To date, there have been 23 seasons of \"Big Brother\" in the US on CBS and countless international versions and spin-offs, like \"Celebrity Big Brother.\"\n\nMcGee won the very first (American) competition after lasting 88 days in the house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcGee went on to act on TV and film, including on his own show.\n\nMcGee, 43, who lost his leg to cancer at 11 years old, has since become an actor. He has portrayed amputees in shows like \"Law and Order\" and movies like \"God's Pocket.\"\n\n\"If you are disabled, there is no one you can say, 'Hey, I can be like that character or that actor,'\" he told Living with Amplitude in 2017. \"So I struggle and strive every day and hope to one day be that guy who can inspire.\"\n\nHe also had his own show, \"Eddie's,\" where he played himself, supported by characters who work at his LA restaurant, which lasted for one season in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest friends Brennan Swain and Rob Frisbee were the first winners of \"The Amazing Race\" in 2001.\n\n\"The Amazing Race\" follows pairs as they travel the world, attempting to get to a final destination while overcoming physical and mental challenges.\n\nThe show has been going strong with 33 seasons of the original American version on CBS and several spin-offs. There have also been several international editions.\n\nThe season one winners were best friends Frisbee and Swain, who shared the grand prize of $1 million in 2001.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, Swain and Frisbee work in law and are still best friends.\n\nFrisbee, 49, has been working as an attorney and also started writing for TV and movies. Swain is a lawyer specializing in copyright and intellectual property, according to NewsWeek.\n\nSwain, 50, reminisced on their win in an Instagram post in 2021, writing, \"20 years later I can look back and realize what a life-changing experience it was,\" adding, \"I've been able to use my small dose of celebrity to raise money for many great charities and I've been able to continue to travel the world.\"\n\n\"I'm still best of friends with Rob and was honored with being the best man at his wedding and the godfather of his son,\" Swain wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2002, Kelly Clarkson was the first-ever winner of \"American Idol.\"\n\n\"American Idol\" is a singing competition geared toward letting amateur singers get a shot at fame by first auditioning for judges, and then getting voted on by the American public.\n\nIt aired on Fox between 2002 and 2016 before going off the air. It was then revived on ABC in 2018 and is still on now, airing for 20 seasons total between the two iterations.\n\nIn 2002, Clarkson won the singing competition, receiving a $1 million recording contract with RCA Records.\n\nDays after her win, she released her debut single, \"A Moment Like This,\" which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarkson has maintained her stardom, both as a singer and a TV personality.\n\nClarkson's songs have spanned pop, country, R&B, and soul, across nine successful albums during her career. She has won three Grammys, various country music awards, three Daytime Emmy awards, and has three No. 1 hits (and 10 top 10 hits) to her name.\n\nClarkson, 40, returned to her television roots, becoming a judge on \"The Voice\" in 2018. She and her teams have won four times within seven seasons.\n\nShe also started her own daytime talk show, \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" in 2019. In addition to interviewing guests, she performs \"Kellyoke\" on every episode.\n\nClarkson also co-hosted the first season of \"American Song Contest\" with Snoop Dogg in the spring of 2022. She's easily the most successful \"American Idol\" winner, to date.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdrianne Curry won the very first season of \"America's Next Top Model\" in 2003.\n\n\"America's Next Top Model\" was created by supermodel Tyra Banks in 2003. It was on UPN from 2003 to 2006, then moved to The CW after the two networks merged.\n\nAfter being cancelled by The CW in 2015, it was revived a year later by VH1, and now has a total of 24 seasons, or cycles. It hasn't officially been canceled, but it also hasn't had a cycle since 2018.\n\nIt also became a success abroad with over 50 international editions, like \"Britain's Next Top Model.\"\n\nFor the first season of \"America's Next Top Model,\" 10 women competed in challenges to prove their modeling skills. The winner was promised a Wilhelmina Models contract, a Marie Claire magazine photo spread, and Revlon cosmetics contract.\n\nCurry, who was just 21 at the time, was crowned the very first top model in 2003 after proving herself to judges Banks, Janice Dickinson, Kimora Lee Simmons, and Beau Quillian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurry has since retired from modeling and is living off the grid.\n\nIn a since-deleted 2020 Instagram post, Curry, 39, wrote, \"We were led to believe daily the winner would be instantly rich and a huge Revlon cover girl. This was a lie,\" according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nDespite this, she modeled for several magazines and booked campaigns before eventually retiring from that industry.\n\nShe also joined the cast of \"The Surreal Life\" where she met and started dating \"The Brady Bunch\" star Christopher Knight.

He released his album \"Gravity\" in 2016 and currently shares his music and covers on Instagram.\n\nRead next\n\nReality TV Entertainment\n\nAdvertisement"
