        "text": "VH1 should be forced to change its slogan of “Music First.”\n\nWhen music was its first priority, MTV’s sister channel couldn’t get arrested. And if it had managed to get arrested, it probably wouldn’t have rated more than a sentence in the dot, dot, dot sections at the bottom of TV-page wrapups.\n\nSo VH1 rededicated itself to celebrity – whether celebrity faded (“Where Are They Now”), celebrity before it would be certified (“Before They Were Rock Stars”), celebrity rationalizing and cannibalizing itself (“Behind the Music”), or celebrity interrupted (“Pop Up Video”).\n\nAnd the public bit, thus guaranteeing more celebrity stuff (a word we choose carefully) and guff (ditto) and less music.\n\nMusic has become but a nominal peg on which VH1 hangs its programming hat.\n\nWhich brings us to VH1’s theme for the week: “100 Greatest Women of Rock & Roll.”\n\nThe list will be scrolled out backwards, starting with No. 100, Erykah Badu, in a series of five one-hour specials telecast at 10 p.m. each night this week.\n\nEach has a different celebrity host. Jennifer Lopez (tonight) and former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell (tomorrow) can claim certifiable music celebrity.\n\nBut how are we to explain Julianna Margulies (Wednesday), Courteney Cox (Thursday) and Susan Sarandon (Friday) as hosts? Whether we love them or not – and we do – they are not significant to music.\n\nOh, sure, Cox got her big break as the young woman supposedly yanked at random out of the audience to dance with Bruce Springsteen in his video for “Dancing in the Dark.”\n\nAnd Hillary Clinton is married to a President who plays the saxophone with all-American mediocrity.\n\nSo she contributes an introduction to tonight’s countdown of the list that was voted on (and added to) by 500 to 600 of “the most influential women in society today, all of whom share a passion for music,” according to VH1’s press release.\n\nForget the fact that any list of 50 greatest TV commercials or 50 most beautiful people or 100 greatest movies or whatever, you can argue the rankings well into our next lives.\n\nIt’s what such lists are all about: getting you to talk about them in the absence of anything weightier to occupy your time.\n\nYou can also wage an honorable argument for or against the inclusion of No. 30 Rickie Lee Jones (a blip on the continuum in our humble opinion).\n\nBut Yoko Ono anywhere on this list, much less at No. 84? C’mon.\n\nEqually mystifying are the appearance of non-rockers Patsy Cline (whose name was not among those submitted to the influential balloteers but was written in and ranked No. 11), Ella Fitzgerald (ranked No. 13), Bessie Smith (No. 26), Joan Baez (No. 27), Barbra Streisand (who was on the list VH1 submitted for balloteers’ consideration and who ranked No. 31).\n\nOther performers who are admittedly laudable but who nonetheless stick out as non-rock oddities on VH1’s helpfully supplied list: No. 48 Dinah Washinton, No. 50 Sarah Vaughan, No. 62 Lena Horne, No. 65 Loretta Lynn, No. 73 Tammy Wynette, No. 89 Eartha Kitt, No. 93 Peggy Lee."
