        "text": "Benjamin Géza \"Ben\" Affleck-Boldt was born on August 15, 1972 in Berkeley, California and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to mother Chris Anne (Boldt), a school teacher, and father Timothy Byers \"Tim\" Affleck, a social worker. Ben has a younger brother, actor Casey Affleck, who was born in 1975. He is of mostly English, Irish, German, and Scottish ancestry. His middle name, Géza, is after a Hungarian family friend who was a Holocaust survivor.\n\nAffleck wanted to be an actor ever since he could remember, and his first acting experience was for a Burger King commercial, when he was on the PBS mini-series, The Voyage of the Mimi (1984). It was also at that age when Ben met his lifelong friend and fellow actor, Matt Damon. They played little league together and took drama classes together. Ben's teen years consisted of mainly TV movies and small television appearances including In den Fängen eines Fremden (1987) and Auf Kollisionskurs (1988). He made his big introduction into feature films in 1993 when he was cast in Confusion - Sommer der Ausgeflippten (1993). After that, he did mostly independent films like Kevin Smith's Mallrats (1995) and Chasing Amy (1997) which were great for Ben's career, receiving renowned appreciation for his works at the Sundance film festival. But the success he was having in independent films didn't last much longer and things got a little shaky for Ben. He was living in an apartment with his brother Casey and friend Matt, getting tired of being turned down for the big roles in films and being given the forgettable supporting ones. Since Matt was having the same trouble, they decided to write their own script, where they could call all the shots. So, after finishing the script for Good Will Hunting: Der gute Will Hunting (1997), they gave it to their agent, Patrick Whitesell, who showed it to a few Hollywood studios, finally being accepted by Castle Rock. It was great news for the two, but Castle Rock wasn't willing to give Ben and Matt the control over the project they were hoping for. It was friend Kevin Smith who took it to the head of Miramax who bought the script giving Ben and Matt the control they wanted and, in December 5, 1997, Good Will Hunting: Der gute Will Hunting (1997) was released, making the two unknown actors famous. The film was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Original Screenplay for Ben and Matt. The film marked Ben's breakthrough role, in which he was given for the first time the chance to choose roles instead of having to go through grueling auditions constantly.\n\nAffleck chose such roles in the blockbusters Armageddon - Das jüngste Gericht (1998), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Pearl Harbor (2001). In the early years of the 2000s, he also starred in the box office hits Spurwechsel (2002), Der Anschlag (2002), and Daredevil (2003), as well as the disappointing comedies Liebe mit Risiko - Gigli (2003) and Wie überleben wir Weihnachten? (2004). While the mid 2000s were considered a career downturn for Affleck, he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in Die Hollywood-Verschwörung (2006). In the several years following, he played supporting roles, including in the films Smokin' Aces (2006), Er steht einfach nicht auf Dich (2009), State of Play - Stand der Dinge (2009), and Ausgequetscht (2009). He ventured into directing in 2007, with the thriller Gone Baby Gone - Kein Kinderspiel (2007), which starred his brother, Casey Affleck, and was well received. He then directed, co-wrote, and starred in The Town - Stadt ohne Gnade (2010), which was named to the National Board of Review Top Ten Films of the year. For the political thriller Argo (2012), which he directed and starred in, Affleck won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Director, and the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture (Affleck's second Oscar win).\n\nIn 2014, Affleck headlined the book adaptation thriller Gone Girl - Das perfekte Opfer (2014). He starred as Bruce Wayne/Batman in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Suicide Squad (2016), and Justice League (2017). He reprised the role in Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and he will next appear as Batman in Aquaman - Lost Kingdom (2023) and The Flash (2023).\n\nRecently he has given praise-worthy performances in Out of Play - Der Weg zurück (2020) as a recovering alcoholic, The Last Duel (2021) (notably he also co-wrote the script), and a scene-stealing golden globe nominated performance in The Tender Bar (2021).\n\nCasey Affleck is a renowned American actor, filmmaker, and producer recognized for his captivating performances and commitment to independent cinema. With an Academy Award under his belt and a reputation as a powerful leading man, Casey Affleck has established himself as one of the most compelling and versatile actors in contemporary cinema. Throughout his career, he has consistently delivered performances of exceptional depth and nuance in a wide range of film genres.\n\nAffleck's breakout role came in Andrew Dominik's critically acclaimed character drama, \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" (2007). His performance as Robert Ford, a young man consumed by a complex cocktail of admiration and resentment for the notorious outlaw Jesse James (portrayed by Brad Pitt), earned him widespread recognition, including Academy Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations.\n\nHe solidified his critical acclaim with a starring role in his brother Ben Affleck's directorial debut, \"Gone, Baby, Gone\" (2007). This gripping neo-noir followed two Boston-based private detectives searching for an abducted young girl. Affleck's performance, showcasing both vulnerability and determination, further cemented his reputation as a rising dramatic force.\n\nThe following decade saw Affleck continue to diversify his roles, venturing outside the realm of independent drama to blockbuster productions. He was seen in Christopher Nolan's ambitious sci-fi epic \"Interstellar\" (2014) alongside an ensemble cast including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway. Affleck also appeared in Scott Cooper's gritty crime thriller, \"Out of the Furnace\" (2013), where he shared the screen with Christian Bale.\n\nHis versatility continued to shine with his performance in the independent film \"Ain't Them Bodies Saints\" (2013), showcasing a quieter, more brooding side to his acting talents. That same year, Affleck turned his attention to production, establishing The Affleck/Middleton Project with John Powers Middleton as a platform to develop and produce a diverse array of film and television projects.\n\nAffleck's directorial work came to fruition with the release of the mockumentary \"I'm Still Here\" (2010), which he directed, wrote, and produced, featuring Joaquin Phoenix in a performance art piece that blurred the lines between fiction and reality. This experimental project demonstrated Affleck's willingness to challenge conventional storytelling formats.\n\nIn 2016, Affleck returned to the spotlight with his career-defining performance in Kenneth Lonergan's profoundly moving drama, \"Manchester by the Sea.\" His portrayal of Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken man coping with immense loss, earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. This raw and unforgettable performance cemented Affleck's status as one of the industry's finest dramatic actors.\n\n2016 also saw Affleck star in several other notable films, including the action thriller \"Triple 9\" (2016) and Disney's historical drama, \"The Finest Hours.\" He further expanded his range with roles in independent films like David Lowery's \"A Ghost Story\" (2017), a meditative exploration of loss and the passage of time.\n\nAffleck has continued to take on challenging projects that have pushed his boundaries as an actor. Most recently, he starred opposite Elisabeth Moss in the psychological thriller \"Light of My Life\" (2019), which he also wrote and directed.\n\nHis upcoming projects include a pivotal role in Christopher Nolan's highly-anticipated \"Oppenheimer\" (2023), where he portrays theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer himself. Affleck is also slated to star in \"Slingshot\" (2024), a science fiction thriller set in space.\n\nCasey Affleck's talent for embodying complex, flawed characters with profound authenticity has made him one of the most sought-after actors in the industry. With his captivating performances, dedication to his craft, and his discerning eye for unique storytelling projects, the future remains bright for this remarkable actor.\n\nKnown for his breakthrough starring role on Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999), James Franco was born April 19, 1978 in Palo Alto, California, to Betsy Franco, a writer, artist, and actress, and Douglas Eugene \"Doug\" Franco, who ran a Silicon Valley business. His mother is Jewish and his father was of Portuguese and Swedish descent.\n\nGrowing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom Franco, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents' dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie's Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Voll daneben, voll im Leben (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries Tage voller Blut - Die Bestie von Dallas (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Hoffnungslos verliebt (2000).\n\nAlthough he'd been working steadily, it wasn't until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean - Ein Leben auf der Überholspur (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man's best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy.\n\nNext was Deuces Wild - Wild in den Straßen (2002) and City by the Sea (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean - Ein Leben auf der Überholspur (2001). He was seen in David Gordon Green's Ananas Express (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe's Das Lächeln der Sterne (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis' Im Tal von Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant's Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. Definitely growing out of his shyness, James Franco is turning into a legend of his own.\n\nJohn Cusack is, like most of his characters, an unconventional hero. Wary of fame and repelled by formulaic Hollywood fare, he has built a successful career playing underdogs and odd men out--all the while avoiding the media spotlight. John was born in Evanston, Illinois, to an Irish-American family. With the exception of mom Nancy (née Carolan), a former math teacher, the Cusack clan is all show business: father Dick Cusack was an actor and filmmaker, and John's siblings Joan Cusack, Ann Cusack, Bill Cusack and Susie Cusack are all thespians by trade. Like his brother and sisters, John became a member of Chicago's Piven Theatre Workshop while he was still in elementary school. By age 12, he already had several stage productions, commercial voice overs and industrial films under his belt. He made his feature film debut at 17, acting alongside Rob Lowe and Andrew McCarthy in the romantic comedy Class - Vom Klassenzimmer zur Klassefrau (1983). His next role, as a member of Anthony Michael Hall's geek brigade in Das darf man nur als Erwachsener (1984), put him on track to becoming a teen-flick fixture. Cusack remained on the periphery of the Brat Pack, sidestepping the meteoric rise and fall of most of his contemporaries, but he stayed busy with leads in films like Der Volltreffer (1985) and Lanny dreht auf (1985). Young Cusack is probably best remembered for what could be considered his last adolescent role: the stereo-blaring romantic Lloyd Dobler in Teen Lover (1989). A year later, he hit theaters as a grown-up, playing a bush-league con man caught between his manipulative mother and headstrong girlfriend in Grifters (1990).\n\nThe next few years were relatively quiet for the actor, but he filled in the gaps with off-screen projects. He directed and produced several shows for the Chicago-based theater group The New Criminals, which he founded in 1988 (modeling it after Tim Robbins' Actors' Gang in Los Angeles) to promote political and avant-garde stage work. Four years later, Cusack's high school friends Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis joined him in starting a sister company for film, New Crime Productions. New Crime's first feature was the sharply written comedy Ein Mann, ein Mord (1997), which touched off a career renaissance for Cusack. In addition to co-scripting, he starred as a world-weary hit man who goes home for his ten-year high school reunion and tries to rekindle a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie Driver). In an instance of life imitating art, Cusack actually did go home for his ten-year reunion (to honor a bet about the film's financing) and ended up in a real-life romance with Driver. Cusack's next appearance was as a federal agent (or, as he described it, \"the first post-Heston, non-biblical action star in sandals\") in Con Air (1997), a movie he chose because he felt it was time to make smart business decisions. He followed that with Clint Eastwood's Mitternacht im Garten von Gut und Böse (1997), in which he played a Yankee reporter entangled in a Savannah murder case.\n\nCusack has always favored offbeat material, so it was no surprise when he turned up in the fiercely original Being John Malkovich (1999). Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, he was almost unrecognizable in the role of a frustrated puppeteer who stumbles across a portal into the brain of actor John Malkovich. The convincing performance won him a Best Actor nomination at the Independent Spirit Awards. In 2000, Cusack was back to his clean-shaven self in High Fidelity (2000), another New Crime production. He worked with Steve Pink and D.V. DeVincentis to adapt Nick Hornby's popular novel (relocating the story to their native Chicago), then starred as the sarcastic record store owner who revisits his \"Top 5\" breakups to find out why he's so unlucky in love. The real Cusack has been romantically linked with several celebs, including Driver, Alison Eastwood, Claire Forlani and Neve Campbell. He's also something of a family man, acting frequently opposite sister Joan Cusack and pulling other Cusacks into his films on a regular basis. He seems pleased with the spate of projects on his horizon, but admits that he still hasn't reached his ultimate goal: to be involved in a \"great piece of art\".\n\nLiam Hemsworth was born on January 13, 1990, in Melbourne, Australia, and is the younger brother of actors Chris Hemsworth and Luke Hemsworth. He is the son of Leonie (van Os), a teacher of English, and Craig Hemsworth, a social-services counselor. He is of Dutch (from his immigrant maternal grandfather), Irish, English, Scottish, and German ancestry. His uncle, by marriage, was Rod Ansell, the bushman who inspired the film Crocodile Dundee - Ein Krokodil zum Küssen (1986).\n\nThe Hemsworth family lived primarily on Phillip Island, a small island located south of Melbourne. Following in the footsteps of his older brothers, who went into acting in their teens, Liam scored his first audition at age sixteen and appeared on the Australian TV series Home and Away (1988) and McLeods Töchter (2001) before taking on a recurring character role on the soap opera Nachbarn (1985), in which his brother Luke had also appeared. Roles on TV shows Elephant Princess (2008) and Satisfaction (2007) followed before Liam moved to the United States to pursue a big-screen career.\n\nAfter suffering two setbacks - his character was written out of the script for The Expendables (2010) days before filming and he lost the title role of Thor (2011) to his brother Chris - Liam was cast opposite Miley Cyrus in the Nicholas Sparks drama Mit Dir an meiner Seite (2010). The two, who played love interests in the film, soon started dating, and Liam appeared in Cyrus' music video \"When I Look at You.\" Following that film's modest commercial success, and the attendant press coverage of his rising career and high-profile romance, he was almost immediately thrust into leading man status, and was cast as Gale Hawthorne in the big-screen adaptation of the best-selling novel Die Tribute von Panem - The Hunger Games (2012). Following the blockbuster success of that film, Liam nabbed a number of roles, including a supporting part in The Expendables 2 (2012) and leading roles in the war drama Love and Honor - Liebe ist unbesiegbar (2013), the crime drama Empire State - Die Straßen von New York (2013), and the thriller Paranoia - Riskantes Spiel (2013). He reprised the role of Gale Hawthorne in Die Tribute von Panem - Catching Fire (2013), Die Tribute von Panem - Mockingjay: Teil 1 (2014), and Die Tribute von Panem - Mockingjay: Teil 2 (2015), played a hero fighter pilot in Independence Day: Wiederkehr (2016), a period Australian in Das Duell (2016), and a romantic comedy archetype opposite Rebel Wilson in Isn't It Romantic (2019).\n\nHemsworth married American singer and actress Miley Cyrus in December 2018, after a decade-long courtship.\n\nHandsome Texan Luke Cunningham Wilson was born in Dallas in 1971 to Irish-American parents originally from Massachusetts. The son of Laura (Cunningham), a photographer, and Robert Andrew Wilson, an advertising executive, he was raised with two brothers, Owen Wilson (the middle one) and Andrew Wilson (the eldest one). The three would all go on to make their careers in film, with Luke Wilson discovering his love of acting while a student at Occidental College. In 1993, the brothers Wilson collaborated with Wes Anderson to make Bottle Rocket (1993), which was initially a 13-minute short. The gleefully optimistic story of three Texans who aspire to become successful thieves Bottle Rocket (1993) premiered at the 1993 Sundance Festival where it attracted the attention of director James L. Brooks. With Brooks' help, the short became a full-length feature film released in 1996 under the same name, Durchgeknallt (1996). Afterwards, Wilson moved to Hollywood, setting up house with his two brothers and Anderson. The same year, Wilson also appeared in the coming-of-age drama American Dreamer - Charmante Lügner (1997). After large roles in three 1998 comedies, Bloody Wedding - Die Braut muß warten (1997), Bongwater (1998), and Verliebt in Sally (1998) (the latter two co-starring Drew Barrymore), Wilson went on to star in another three comedies the following year. The first, Dog Park - Bei Fuß, Liebling! (1998), was a Canadian film directed by link=tt0096626] alum Bruce McCulloch and featured Wilson as one of a group of twenty-something's undergoing the trials and tribulations of love. Der Diamanten-Cop (1999) starred the actor as the sidekick of robber-turned-policeman Martin Lawrence, while Kill the Man - Vom Kopiertrottel zum Millionär (1999) (which premiered at the 1999 Sundance Festival) cast him as the owner of a small copy center competing with a large chain store across the street. Though he would stick closely to comedy through 2001 with roles in 3 Engel für Charlie (2000) and Natürlich blond (2001), Wilson took a turn for the sinister in the thrillers Lethal Mistake - Bis zum letzten Atemzug (2000) and Soul Survivors (2001) before teaming again with his brother Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson to give one of his most memorable performances as Richie in Die Royal Tenenbaums (2001). In 2003, Wilson reprised two past roles, appearing in both 3 Engel für Charlie - Volle Power (2003) and Natürlich blond 2 (2003). That same year, he also scored a hit as one of the stars of Todd Phillips' Old School - Wir lassen absolut nichts anbrennen (2003). The year 2004 saw Wilson embark on The Wendell Baker Story (2005), a film he starred in, co-directed with brother Andrew Wilson.\n\nAlthough he made his film debut in the acclaimed independent film Durchgeknallt (1996), he initially got more recognition for his real-life role as Drew Barrymore's boyfriend than for his acting. Fortunately for Wilson, his onscreen talents outlasted his relationship with Barrymore, and he has enjoyed steady employment and increasing visibility through substantial roles in a number of films.\n\nActress and philanthropist Rooney Mara was born on April 17, 1985 in Bedford, New York. She made her screen debut in the slasher film Düstere Legenden 3 (2005), went on to have a supporting role in the independent coming-of-age drama Die Mädchen von Tanner Hall (2009), and has since starred in the horror remake A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010), the biographical drama The Social Network (2010), the thriller remake Verblendung (2011), and the romantic drama Carol (2015).\n\nPatricia Rooney Mara is one of four children of Kathleen McNulty (née Rooney) and NFL football team New York Giants executive Timothy Christopher Mara. Her grandfathers were Wellington Mara, co-owner of the Giants, and Timothy Rooney, owner of Yonkers Raceway, and her grand-uncle is Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney, the former Ambassador to Ireland. She is the great-granddaughter of Art Rooney, the founder of the Pittsburgh Steelers football franchise. Her father has Irish, German, and French-Canadian ancestry, and her mother is of Irish and Italian descent.\n\nAfter graduating from Bedford's Fox Lane High School, she went to Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia in South America for four months as part of the Traveling School, an open learning environment. She attended George Washington University for a year and then transferred to New York University, where she studied international social policy psychology and nonprofits. She took her degree from New York University in 2010. Her studies focused on non-profit organizations, as her family has a tradition of involvement in philanthropic causes.\n\nShe had thought of acting after watching old movies and attending musical theater, but did not think of it as a serious vocation and was afraid she might fail at this. As a result of her reservations, she appeared in only one play while in high school.\n\nShe began seriously focusing on acting when she was at New York University, appearing in student films. Inspired by her older sister, actress Kate Mara, she began to pursue the craft, auditioning for acting jobs at age 19. She appeared with her sister Kate in the video horror movie Düstere Legenden 3 (2005), billing herself as \"Patricia Mara\". As \"Tricia Mara\", she had guest roles on television and won her first lead in the movie Die Mädchen von Tanner Hall (2009), which was shot in the fall of 2007.\n\nShe originally auditioned for the supporting role of Lucasta in \"Tanner Hall\", a $3-million independent film, but director Tatiana von Fürstenberg was so impressed by the young actress, she had her return to audition for the lead role of Fernanda, which Mara won. Furstenberg was delighted with her nuanced performance, saying, \"Still waters run deep\".\n\nContinuing to call herself Tricia Mara, this was during the making of \"Tanner Hall\" that she considered changing her professional name to Rooney Mara, soliciting the advice of the cast and crew. After premiering at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, her performance in \"Tanner Hall\" brought the rechristened Rooney Mara a \"Rising Star\" award at the 2009 Hamptons Film Festival and a \"Stargazer Award\" at the 2010 Gen Art Film Festival.\n\nShe received her first lead role in a major feature, in the $35 million remake A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010). The movie proved disappointing at the box office, grossing only $63 million domestically and racking up a worldwide gross of just under $116 million. However, she was noticed by critics in the small but pivotal role of the Boston University undergrad Erica Albright who dumps Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network (2010). Director David Fincher subsequently cast her as the lead, Lisbeth Salander, in his thriller remake, Verblendung (2011), based on Stieg Larsson's Millennium book series. She received critical acclaim for her performance, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama.\n\nShe starred in the thriller film Side Effects - Tödliche Nebenwirkungen (2013), the independent drama The Saints - Sie kannten kein Gesetz (2013), and the acclaimed sci-fi romantic drama Her (2013). The following year, she starred in the adventure drama Trash (2014). She garnered further critical acclaim for her performance in Todd Haynes' romantic drama Carol (2015), for which she won the Best Actress Award at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama and the SAG, BAFTA, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nIn the spirit of her family's philanthropic endeavors, Rooney created Faces of Kibera, a charity that provides food, medical care and housing to orphans in Nairobi, Kenya's Kibra district, a small slum that houses a million people. There are many orphans as AIDS is rampant in the slum.\n\nCharlie Sheen was born Carlos Irwin Estévez on September 3, 1965, in New York City. His father, actor Martin Sheen (born Ramon Antonio Gerard Estevez), was at the time just breaking into the business, with performances on Broadway. His mother, Janet Sheen (née Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Charlie's father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Emilio Estevez, Renée Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry.\n\nAt a young age, Charlie took an interest in his father's acting career. When he was nine, he was given a small part in his dad's movie The Execution of Private Slovik (1974). In 1977, he was in the Philippines where his dad suffered a near-fatal heart attack on the set of Apocalypse Now (1979).\n\nWhile at Santa Monica High School, Charlie had two major interests: acting and baseball. Along with his friends, which included Rob Lowe and Sean Penn, he produced and starred in several amateur Super-8 films. On the Vikings baseball team, he was a star shortstop and pitcher. His lifetime record as a pitcher was 40-15. His interest and skill in baseball would later influence some of his movie roles. Unfortunately, his success on the baseball field did not translate to success in the classroom, as he struggled to keep his grades up. Just a few weeks before his scheduled graduation date, Charlie was expelled due to poor attendance and bad grades.\n\nAfter high school, Charlie aggressively pursued many acting roles. His first major role was as a high school student in the teen war film Die rote Flut (1984). He followed this up with relatively small roles in TV movies and low-profile releases. His big break came in 1986 when he starred in Oliver Stone's Oscar winning epic Platoon (1986). He drew rave reviews for his portrayal of a young soldier who is caught in the center of a moral crisis in Vietnam.\n\nThe success of Platoon (1986) prompted Oliver Stone to cast Charlie in his next movie Wall Street (1987) alongside his father and veteran actor Martin Sheen. The movie with its \"Greed is Good\" theme became an instant hit with viewers.\n\nShortly after, Stone approached Charlie about the starring role in his next movie, Geboren am 4. Juli (1989). When Tom Cruise eventually got the part, Sheen ended up hearing the news from his brother Emilio Estevez and not even getting as much as a call from Stone. This led to a fallout, and the two have not worked together since.\n\nThe fallout with Stone, however, did nothing to hurt Charlie's career in the late 1980s and early '90s, as he continued to establish himself as one of the top box office draws with a string of hits that included Young Guns - Sie fürchten weder Tod noch Teufel (1988), Die Indianer von Cleveland (1989), and Hot Shots! - Die Mutter aller Filme (1991). However, as the mid-'90s neared, his good fortune both personally and professionally, soon came to an end.\n\nAround this time, Charlie, who had already been to drug rehab, was beginning to develop a reputation as a hard-partying, womanizer. In 1995, the same year he was briefly married to model Donna Peele, he was called to testify at the trial of Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss. At the trial, while under oath he admitted to spending nearly $50,000 on 27 of Fleiss' $2,500-a-night prostitutes.\n\nHis downward spiral continued the following year when his ex-girlfriend Brittany Ashland filed charges claiming that he physically abused her. He was later charged with misdemeanor battery to which he pleaded no contest and was given a year's suspended sentence, two years' probation and a $2,800 fine. He finally hit rock bottom in May 1998 when he was hospitalized in Thousand Oaks, California, following a near-fatal drug overdose. Later that month, he was ordered back to the drug rehab center, which he had previously left after one day.\n\nDuring this stretch, Charlie's film career began to suffer as well. He starred in a series of box office flops that included The Arrival - Die Ankunft (1996) and Verschwörung im Schatten (1997). However as the 1990s came to end, so did Charlie's string of bad luck.\n\nIn 2000, Charlie, now clean and sober, was chosen to replace Michael J. Fox on the ABC hit sitcom Chaos City (1996). Though his stint lasted only two seasons, Charlie's performance caught the eye of CBS executives who in 2003 were looking for an established star to help carry their Monday night lineup of sitcoms that included Alle lieben Raymond (1996). The sitcom Two and a Half Men (2003) starred Charlie as a swinging, irresponsible womanizer whose life changes when his nephew suddenly appears on his doorstep. The show became a huge hit, breathing much needed life into Charlie's fading career.\n\nCharlie's personal life also appeared to be improving. In 2002, he married actress Denise Richards, whom he first met while shooting the movie Good Advice (2001). In March 2004, they had a daughter, Sam, and it was announced shortly after that Denise was pregnant with the couple's second child. By all reports, the couple seemed to be very happy together. However, like all of Charlie's previous relationships, the stability did not last long. In March of 2005, Denise, who was six-months pregnant, filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. She gave birth to a second daughter, Lola, in June of that same year. Their divorce became final in late 2006.\n\nEmilio Estevez was born on May 12, 1962, in New York City. He is the eldest son of actor Martin Sheen, who at the time was just breaking into the business. His mother, Janet Sheen (née Templeton), was a former New York art student who had met Emilio's father right after he had moved to Manhattan. Martin and Janet had three other children, Charlie Sheen, Renée Estevez, and Ramon Estevez, all of whom became actors. His father is of half Spanish and half Irish descent, and his mother, whose family is from Kentucky, has English and Scottish ancestry.\n\nHe lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side until his family relocated to Malibu in 1968. Before graduating from Santa Monica High School in 1980, Estevez had already had a small role as a messenger boy in Apocalypse Now (1979), that was ultimately cut from the film.\n\nThough his father had opted to use the stage name \"Sheen\" over his more ethnic birth name \"Estevez,\" Emilio chose to retain the family name, hoping to avoid riding his father's coattails. He also thought the double \"E\" set of initials was \"pretty.\"\n\nHe appeared in a few TV movies, the first of which was 17 Going on Nowhere (1980), before making his big-screen debut opposite Matt Dillon in 1982's Tex (1982). A part in Outsider: Rebellen ohne Grund (1983) followed, and Estevez made his first big splash as the punk rocker Otto in the cult classic Repo Man (1984).\n\nOriginally cast as Bender (The Criminal) in the seminal John Hughes flick Der Frühstücksclub (1985), Estevez took the part of Andrew (The Athlete) instead after Hughes could find no one else to fill the role. Another ensemble film, St. Elmo's Fire: Die Leidenschaft brennt tief (1985) came next. Then Estevez made his screen-writing debut with Jungs außer Kontrolle (1985), a film in which he also starred.\n\nHe then starred in the Stephen King thriller and cult hit Rhea M. - Es begann ohne Warnung (1986), . The ambitious young actor added directing to his palette with Wisdom - Dynamit und kühles Blut (1986) in 1986. Estevez went on to write, direct and star in the film Men at Work , Men at Work (1990) alongside his brother Charlie Sheen in 1989 . Originally written as an environmental comedy that follows two slacker garbage men who find a dead politician in a trash barrel,''Men at Work'' went on to be a moderate success and enjoys a \"cult\" status.\n\nEstevez jumped back into making studio films with hits like Die Nacht hat viele Augen (1987) and Young Guns - Sie fürchten weder Tod noch Teufel (1988), as well as their subsequent sequels.\n\nIn 1992, Emilio took on one of his most iconic and famous roles as Coach Gordon Bombay in Mighty Ducks - Das Superteam (1992). The enormously popular Disney film spawned two sequels and an NHL hockey team of the same name, but Estevez was interested in making more dramatic films.\n\nIn 1995, he agreed to make a brief appearance in Mighty Ducks 3 - Jetzt mischen sie die Highschool auf (1996) in exchange for Disney helping him finance and distribute another effort as actor-director, Heimatfront (1996). Though smiled on by critics, Heimatfront (1996) received a very limited distribution by Disney and thus went largely unseen. The War at Home, filmed in Austin, Texas, is an exploration of the effects of PTSD on a Vietnam veteran who has returned to his Texas family's home in 1972. The film co-stars Oscar winner, Kathy Bates, Estevez ' s father Martin Sheen and Kimberly Williams . The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 1996 as an Official Selection. Estevez continued to work in films, both behind and in front of the camera, including a fourth effort as director and star, Rated X (2000), which co-starred brother Charlie Sheen and was a selection at the Sundance Film Festival in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, Emilio made the motion picture Bobby. Bobby (2006), a \"day in the life\" film. Robert F. Kennedy Estevez wrote, directed, and acted in the picture, which, follows 22 characters in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4th, 1968 on the day Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated following his win in the California primary. The film remains one of the starriest ensemble cast ever assembled with Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, William H. Macy, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Laurence Fishburne, Harry Belafonte, Lindsay Lohan, Helen Hunt, Martin Sheen and many others in the cast. Distributed by The Weinstein Company, \"Bobby\" went on to be nominated for two Golden Globes, Best Original Song and Best Picture (Drama), as well as a Screen Actors Guild Best Ensemble nomination in 2006. He won a Hollywood Film Best Ensemble Award and received a 7-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival following his nomination for the prestigious Golden Lion for directing the film . The film had its North American premiere at the Toronto Film Festival where it was an Official Selection.\n\nIn 2009 Estevez filmed a new project which he wrote, produced and directed called, The Way, in Spain starring his father, Martin Sheen, in a story about a man who decides to make the Camino de Santiago after the death of his son in the French Pyrénées. It was released in the United States on October 7, 2011, following the premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 2010.\n\nIn 2019, Estevez released another feature film, The Public, starring Alec Baldwin, Christian Slater, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, Taylor Shilling, Michael K. Williams and Estevez himself, which he also wrote, directed and produced. The movie was shot entirely inside the downtown Cincinnati Public Library during the winter of 2017. Once again, The Public enjoyed it's world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 2018. The film was released in 2019 by Greenwich Entertainment and Universal Pictures.\n\nIn 2021, Emilio returns as Coach Gordon Bombay in the new Disney + series, The Mighty Ducks: Gamechangers.\n\nZooey Deschanel's quirky charm, striking blue eyes, and distinctively offbeat humor have made her one of the most beloved indie darlings of recent decades.

Her latest book is entitled \"Sage-ing While Ag-ing\"; Shirley's latest film is Valentinstag (2010), which debuted in theaters on February 12, 2010."
