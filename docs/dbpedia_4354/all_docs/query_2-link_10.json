        "text": "At 9 o'clock, Eastern time, on a recent Friday night, the cable-television music channel VH1 pre-empted its regular programming to sell concert tickets. By arrangement with the rock star Tom Petty, VH1 offered its viewers first crack at 19,200 prime seats -- 400 tickets, at $25 to $45 apiece, for concerts in each of the 48 cities on Mr. Petty's coming tour.\n\nIn the first 15 minutes of this experiment, viewers tried more than 500,000 times to call an \"800\" number that the channel flashed on the screen. Only a tiny fraction of calls got through to the 500 operators fielding them, but the flood indicated that many more people than usual were tuned in. The event had been heavily promoted on the channel and been written about in numerous newspaper articles.\n\nOn this trial run, VH1 was not retaining any proceeds from the ticket sales. On balance, though, it was a triumphant night for the channel, which for 10 years has been badly overshadowed by its corporate siblings at Viacom Inc. -- MTV and Nickelodeon.\n\nLong dismissed as a backwater for aging baby boomers with fossilized musical tastes, the network has recently been repositioned (losing, in the process, the hyphen that used to rest between \"VH\" and \"1\"). Now it is termed the place for \"MTV graduates,\" or viewers in their 20's and 30's who have an ear for contemporary, if not cutting-edge, music -- and the jobs and credit cards to fuel discretionary buying.\n\nIn other words, the kind of people who would call in -- on a mobile phone, perhaps -- for Tom Petty tickets.\n\n\"The viewers we're aiming at want this kind of entertainment, but they don't have four hours to stand in line for tickets,\" said John Sykes, president of VH1, in a telephone interview from his office in Manhattan. Mr. Sykes was hired in March by MTV Networks, which runs all three Viacom channels, to \"refocus\" VH1, which because of its cost structure and corporate connections is almost universally available on cable systems, and is quite profitable.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
