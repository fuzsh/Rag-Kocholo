        "text": "If you miss the days of music on your TV, rejoice! There is a new channel coming your way soon that will give you just that.\n\nFM is the name of the new music-focused venture, which Billboard reports will focus on music, specifically on lesser-known artists. While other channels that got their start thanks to music-related programming such as MTV and VH1 have moved more into reality television, several other networks have popped up in the past few years to fill the void. P. Diddy helped found Revolt TV, which has been growing at a healthy rate ever since. MTV and VH1 also has a sister channel named Palladia, which airs plenty of live music, as well as programs with musical familiar faces, such as Live From Daryl’s House, which stars Daryl Hall of Hall and Oates.\n\nFM seems like an attempt to compete with Viacom’s few music channels and Revolt TV, though it is getting a bit of a late start.\n\nThere is no word just yet on what kind of programming the channel will carry, but it would be nice to see music videos find their way back to television. Very few programs bother with the medium any longer, as outlets like YouTube have become to go-to place to see an artist’s latest clip. If FM could find an interesting new way to feature music videos, they may attract those that are still interested in turning on their TV to see what video-focused artists like Lady Gaga or Kanye West have cooked up now.\n\nFuse is owned by SiTV, which also owns NuvoTV, a channel focused on reaching the Latino market. The company made a bit and won Fuse last year, and ever since has been working on a rebranding. The channel announced a slew of new programs yesterday, with many involving music personalities in one way or another. Jennifer Lopez is working on one show through her production company, and rapper Big Freedia’s reality show has been renewed for two more seasons."
