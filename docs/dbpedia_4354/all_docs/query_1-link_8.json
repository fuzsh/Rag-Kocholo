        "text": "THIS year MTV Networks, which has been saying for some time that it has the best prices for its commercials among cable channels, wants to take on the big boys, the big broadcast networks.\n\nToday, for the first time, MTV will mount a full-fledged, networklike sales presentation for advertisers, complete with a performance by Elton John. The goal is simple: to steal ad money from the likes of ABC, NBC and Fox.\n\nCBS, being a sister network under the corporate parent, Viacom, is not a target of this campaign (and, for the most part, CBS attracts a different, older audience than most of the MTV channels). Mel Karmazin, the president and chief operating officer of Viacom, summed up the strategy:\n\n''I'm happy to take money away from News Corp, Disney and G.E.'' (The News Corporation is the parent of Fox; Disney is the parent of ABC; General Electric of NBC.)\n\nIn the past, MTV has trotted out its bigger networks -- MTV, VH1, Nick at Night, Country Music Television, TV Land, MTV2 and TNN (which is being rebranded again as an all-male network, this time called Spike) -- separately in smaller events looking to persuade advertisers to commit money to each channel. This time, like some other cable companies, including the Turner networks and the Discovery networks, MTV is trying to bundle its products for greater negotiating weight.\n\nAnd the numbers MTV will roll out do carry some weight. Among the 18-to-49-year-old audience that most networks covet, the seven MTV networks, taken together, beat every network in daytime audiences, virtually tie NBC in late-night audiences and are competitive even in prime time. That is the message advertisers will hear today, amid a display of MTV favorites including Ozzy and Kelly Osbourne, Pamela Anderson, and an opening parody of the hit MTV movie ''Jackass: The Movie.''\n\nThe MTV Networks event comes a week before the broadcast television networks present their 2003-4 schedules to advertisers and agencies at their own elaborate, star-filled events. The presentations serve as the prelude to the so-called upfront market, when the networks and Madison Avenue dicker on the price of buying commercial time ahead of the fall season.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
