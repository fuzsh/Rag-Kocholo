        "text": "This is a long thread(although not as long as it looks because there are two long quick-read lists in it that take half the space). But I had to vent my nostalgia. And I felt B&C was a more appropriate place for this than ZS because I'm talking about a television network that used to be all about music.\n\nVH1. It was originally MTV's little sister. While that may make the two networks sound like comrads, and while their ownership is one and the same, the reality is that VH1 was concieved as and always was the anti-MTV.\n\nIn the early days of 80s MTV, when they were still pretty much a music videos channel, Video Hits 1 - VH1 - was concieved essentially as 'MTV for older people'. Whereas MTV was only concerned with playing what was hip and popular on the given day, VH1's purpose was to play videos that would be desirable to the baby boomers(who were in their 20s and 30s at the time). So right from the very start, VH1 was essentially definied by the fact that it respected musical history, whereas MTV was a big celebration of today's fad.\n\nThat was the first era of VH1. Playing music videos geared towards those who were too old for MTV. It lasted from the beginning(1985) to 1994.\n\nIn 1994, VH1 started its fabled \"VH1: Music First\" format. While the first era was all about music videos, this era was all about programs talking ABOUT music and emphasizing the importance OF music. I believe this to be the single best era of any television music network in the history of television.\n\nWe all know these programs.\n\nBehind The Music\n\nEverybody knows BTM. Series was great because it educated a younger generation about a whole bunch of older artists, as well as a few newer ones - just look at this list of episodes(this isn't all of them):\n\nFleetwood Mac\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd\n\nTeddy Pandergrass\n\nBilly Joel\n\nLillith Fair\n\nAndy Gibb\n\nJim Croce\n\nThe Carpenters\n\nSonny Bono\n\nThe Mamas And The Papas\n\nMeat Loaf\n\nGladys Knight\n\nWillie Nelson\n\nJerry Lee Lewis\n\nRick Jamse\n\nDavid Crosby\n\nSelena\n\nJefferson Airplane/Starship\n\nOzzy Osbourne\n\nTed Nugent\n\nJoe Cocker\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nStudio 54\n\nKeith Moon\n\nBonnie Raitt\n\nCulture Club\n\nRobbie Robertson\n\nDef Leppard\n\nTony Orlando\n\nGloria Estefan\n\nJan And Dean\n\nHarry Chapin\n\nGloria Gaynor\n\nMadonna\n\n1968\n\nSteppenwolf\n\nJohn Denver\n\nBlondie\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nMetallica\n\nLionel Richie\n\nRick Springfield\n\nKC And The Sunshine Band\n\nREM\n\nMotley Crue\n\nDavid Cassidy\n\nBette Midler\n\nLeif Garrett\n\nHeart\n\nThe Day The Music Died\n\nDepeche Mode\n\nGrand Funk Railroad\n\nIggy Pop\n\nDuran Duran\n\nCher\n\nJulian Lennon\n\nAlice Cooper\n\nBlack Crowes\n\nTom Petty & The Heartbreakers\n\nMarianne Faithfull\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\n\nEric Burdon & The Animals\n\nDonna Summer\n\nLenny Kravitz\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic\n\nPoison\n\nQuiet Riot\n\nNatalie Cole\n\nMelissa Etheridge\n\nWoodstock\n\nBay City Rollers\n\nDonny & Marie\n\nPeter Tosh\n\nBad Company\n\nGlen Campbell\n\nSting\n\nAlan Freed\n\nThin Lizzy\n\nRocky Horror Picture Show\n\nDr. Dre\n\nBarry White\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\nGenesis\n\n1999\n\nThe Partridge Family\n\nMichael Hutchence\n\nCeline Dion\n\nRussell Simmons\n\nQuincy Jones\n\nRun DMC\n\nTina Turner\n\nElton John\n\nOasis\n\nNo Doubt\n\nThe Police\n\nThe Go-Go's\n\nAC/DC\n\nThe Monkees\n\nPublic Enemy\n\nThe Bangles\n\nPeter Frampton\n\nStyx\n\nIce-T\n\nCat Stevens\n\nChicago\n\nBadfinger\n\nBrian Setzer\n\nHuey Lewis & The News\n\nJourney\n\nDoobie Brothers\n\nRod Stewart\n\nBilly Idol\n\nMegadeth\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G.\n\nNeil Diamond\n\nPat Benatar\n\nREO Speedwagon\n\nTwisted Sister\n\nJudas Priest\n\nSinead O'Connor\n\nSublime\n\nHall & Oates\n\nForeigner\n\nBob Marley\n\nAerosmith\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nGuns'N'Roses\n\nVH1 Legends\n\nCompanion series to BTM - this was for those bands who had had a more significant historical impact on music.\n\nAlthough BTM was VH1's flagship show during those years, this one was better. This is one of THE greatest, most entertaining, inspiring, best put together rockumentary series' I have EVER had the pleasure of viewing. I can only hope they're all put on DVD one of these days.\n\nEpisodes include:\n\nThe Who\n\nGrateful Dead\n\nMarvin Gaye\n\nEric Clapton\n\nThe Doors\n\nU2\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nTina Turner\n\nCurtis Mayfield\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nElton John\n\nJohn Fogerty\n\nB.B. King\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan\n\nQueen\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nJanis Joplin\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\nJohn Lennon\n\nThe Pretenders\n\nGeorge Clinton\n\nThe Clash\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash, & Young\n\nNeil Young\n\nBee Gees\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nSam Cooke\n\nPink Floyd & Syd Barrett\n\nKiss\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nPop-Up Video\n\nThis was a fad in and of itself for a while there in the late 90s. Music videos with fact tidbits sprinkled about. It doesn't sound great but it works brilliantly.\n\nStorytellers\n\nSort of similar to MTV's Unplugged(one of the only music programs in MTV's history that remains relevant to this day), except that the performers told the stories behind the songs before or even while playing them. Great, great series.\n\nWhere Are They Now?\n\nYou know, where they'd catch up with your favorite has-beens from past decades.\n\nA show I don't remember the name of, but it was awesome\n\nI don't remember what it was called, but the concept was music videos in a blender. You'd see a minute of this video, and then it would 'mix' into a minute of that video, and then that would mix into a minute of a third video, and so forth. It was really sweet.\n\nDivas Live\n\nObviously not everybody's cup of tea, but still totally music related. The first one was the best, with Aretha Franklin, Gloria Estefan, Carole King, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, and Mariah Carey.\n\nThe List\n\nDoes anybody remember this show? It only lasted for one season but I looooooved it and really hope to get my hands on those episodes somehow.\n\nIt was where they'd get a group of 4-5 celebrities, sometimes all from the same show or band or whatever, and they'd sit in a circle and make top 5 lists(top 5 bands, top 5 rock songs, top 5 albums, top 5 pop songs, top 5 videos, top 5 this, top 5 that), and at the end the audience would get to vote on it. Fucking awesome show. Rob Gordon would have loved it.\n\n\"Movies That Rock\"\n\nThey'd make biograhic, sometimes partially fictional, films about the lives and careers of classic artists.\n\n100 Greatest...\n\nThese are still going on, but they started over a decade ago, during this era. They've done \"100 Greatest Songs Of The 80s\" and \"100 Greatest Songs Of The 90s\" recently, but back in the day it started with \"Top 100 Artists\", \"Top 100 Albums\", \"Top 100 Songs\", \"Top 100 Heavy Metal Acts\", \"Top 100 One-Hit Wonders\", etc etc.\n\nGod, this era of VH1 was so brilliant and timeless. They even aired old episodes of American Bandstand.\n\nAnd to top it all of, one of the big things they always talked about during that era was the VH1 Save The Music foundation...they wanted to raise money and awareness to keep music programs from being taken out of schools.\n\nSO, ANYWAY, in 2003 or so the ratings had lowerd and they changed their format to what it is today - reality shows(The Surreal Life, Celebrity Fit Club, Celebrity Rehab, America's Next Top Model) sprinkled with remnants of the old VH1(The 'I Love The...' Series among other things). This is still admittedly far better than the steaming pile of turd that is MTV's 'programming' nowadays, but still. You're more likely to catch repeats of old VH1 stuff on VH1 Classic, and even then, most of this stuff isn't there either because VH1 Classic is primarily a videos channel(nothing wrong with that). Although VH1 Classic has some nifty programming of its own - this new '60 Minutes: Classic' series is a great idea.\n\nI'm really indifferent to MTV's decline over the years, because I really don't think they ever hit the peak that VH1 did in the 90s and early 00s. But VH1's decline depresses the hell out of me. VH1 really held on, almost a decade longer than MTV did, before selling out to the times.\n\nBut we always have the memory.\n\nSorry for this long, nostalgic thread.\n\ninteresting thread...\n\nthinking about it, the change was inevitable. as you mentioned in your description of the design of the format at it's inception, it was geared to older music fans in the '80's. by the mid 90's, these fans were 10 years older, probably had families or more important things to do than watch VH1 all day. however, there was a new crop of 20-somethings with disposable income and free time, the farts who grew up watching MTV in the '80's (me and my generation!). after 10 years of whittling down our collective attention span with MTV, i think they reckoned it wouldn't change with aging, so the format became distinctly more MTV-like. instead of updating the playlist to accomodate the exciting new music of the '90's and early 2000's, they just made progressively more shows catering to our collective growing fascination with celebrity.\n\ni think VH1 began to lose it with 'behind the music'. to me, this represents when the programming began to focus on the celebrity aspect of musicians and lost focus on music. the show was sometimes interesting, but they made episodes for EVERYONE. and mostly they weren't interesting, just annoying. more about bickering bandmates than about the music and influences. i actually LOST interest in bands watching this show. that can't be good...\n\nstorytellers was, and still is, a great program. it's just scheduled so haphazardly. i never know when it's on. so i don't even try. and their decisions regarding which ones to air is mind-boggling. they showed that green day one about 10,000 times (and i like that album, but come on!). i think the smashing pumpkins episode was aired like twice. i've still never seen it...\n\nhow hard would it be to dedicate 2 or 3 hours to airing old MTV unplugged or 10 spot episodes on friday or saturday night. i'd gladly stay in to watch SRV's solo acoustic performance followed by radiohead from NYC 1997 followed by the cure playing toy pianos and bongos in a giant bed on their own unplugged . shit - i'd make a party out of it...\n\nin the end, VH1 has become more like E! television than anything else. i don't begrudge the programmers or executives. they want to give the viewer what the viewer wants. apparently, this is what we want...\n\nho hum...."
