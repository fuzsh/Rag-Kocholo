        "text": "Get Your 2024 MTV VMA Tickets!\n\nSome award shows may be swankier (and snobbier), but none are cooler than the VMAs. The fun-filled moments and fist-pumping tunes of the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards are still fresh in our minds, but we’re already looking forward to the 2024 edition of the VMAs. If you missed out on VIP VMA tickets last year, now is your chance to join our waiting list. As a VIP insider, you’ll be among the first to have access to our full selection of ticket packages. You could be front and center for an epic celebration of all things pop and pop culture.\n\nWhat to Expect at the MTV Video Music Awards\n\nWhile we can’t predict what will happen at the 2024 VMAs, we know that it’s going to be awesome. The VMAs are famous for their unforgettable moments. If you’ve tuned in over the past 40 years, you remember plenty of vignettes, such as Rage Against the Machine’s bass player’s show-stopping protest, Kanye West interrupting Taylor Swift’s Best Video acceptance speech, the Britney-Madonna lip lock and Howard Stern’s Fartman flying in from the rafters. Most of all, we can’t forget Miley Cyrus twerking, even though we try. Anything could happen at this year’s show! You don’t want to miss it!\n\nNominees and Voting for the 2024 VMAs\n\nOne thing we like about the VMAs, and we like a lot of things, is that the fans get to vote for their favorite performers. Other shows have changed their voting methods over the years. And some only rely on industry insiders to make the final cut.\n\nOn the other hand, MTV knows what matters: your opinion. Whether you’re into strong female songwriters like Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift or prefer the thick urban beats perfected by Megan Thee Stallion, Nicki Minaj and 24kGoldn, your vote will be counted.\n\nWho Won a VMA in 2023?\n\nEvery year, the list of VMA nominees is pure talent. Last year’s list of contenders was as strong as ever. Taylor Swift was the most-nominated artist with eight nods, and once again, she cleaned up winning awards for Artist of the Year, Song of the Year, Video of the Year, Album of the Year, Best Pop and more.\n\nMeanwhile, SZA claimed just one award for Best R&B despite reeling in six nominations. Ice Spice won us over as the Best New Artist. For a full list of nominees or to cast your vote, visit MTV.com. Fans can vote up to 20 times per day before the big event.\n\nMemorable Moments, Amazing Music and Unforgettable Fun\n\nMTV has been broadcasting hits morning, noon and night for more than 40 years, which is longer than many of today’s music fans have been alive. The very first VMAs were hosted by entertainment legends Bette Midler and Dan Aykroyd way back in 1984. Since then, the torch has been passed to an impressive string of A-listers ranging from Marlon Wayans and Eddie Murphy to LL Cool J and Nicki Minaj. The funny thing is, the show just keeps getting better!\n\nThere’s a reason why the VMAs are called the Super Bowl for youth. Untold millions of youngsters, along with the young at heart, (actually, over 320 million households in 150 countries) will be watching. Since each vote counts, fans are vested in the process and revel as each winner is revealed. Make sure to vote for your favorites because we’re ready to take you there when those adorable Moon Person trophies are handed out to the most deserving candidates.\n\nRed Carpet Looks and Show-Stopping Performances\n\nAnother thing fans have come to expect are controversial red carpet looks ranging from fabulous to flat-out fails. As one onlooker said, “They like to dress up, but they don’t know how.” However, these celebrities and their sexy dates definitely know how to entertain. While the outfits are a big part of this star-studded award show, it’s all about the music and the sizzling-hot live performances.\n\nWho’s Performing at the 2024 VMAs?\n\nUnfortunately, it’s too early to say exactly who will be performing at the 2024 VMAs. However, MTV organizes an impressive lineup of entertainers year after year, so it’s sure to be great. It’s one of the few award shows where you can see not one or two but a handful of the biggest stars performing their chart-topping hits. If you attended the award show in 2023, you probably still have a few Shakira songs stuck in your head. We’ll let you know as soon as the performers are announced. In the meantime, past performers have included:\n\nAnitta\n\nBad Bunny\n\nBlackpink\n\nDiddy\n\nDoja Cat\n\nDove Cameron\n\nEminem\n\nJack Harlow\n\nKane Brown\n\nLizzo\n\nMåneskin\n\nMarshmello\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\n\nSnoop Dogg\n\n2024 VMA Tickets From VIP Concierge\n\nEvery year, we put together several totally awesome VIP VMA ticket packages. We want you and your BFF(s) to enjoy the award show and performances up close alongside other privileged guests.

Like visiting Old Faithful on a trip to Yellowstone, it’s a must-see for any music fan. There’s a reason why this is one of our most popular VIP events year after year.
