VH1 was originally conceived to build upon the success of MTV by playing music videos targeting a slightly older demographic focusing on the lighter, softer side of popular music.[2] Like MTV, VH1 ultimately drifted away from music and into reality television programming; albeit with a focus on music personalities, celebrities, and shows targeting African-American audiences. VH1 is best known for franchises such as Behind the Music, the I Loveâ€¦ series, the Celebreality block, Love & Hip Hop, and Basketball Wives.
