Biography

Henry was not in the PEI Baptismal Index, but he was age 15 in the 1881 census of PEI, living with James and Ellen Ann. He was not with the family in 1891. On the 1900 US census, his mother indicated that some of her children had died before that date.

As well, his brother Albert Watson's death notice said he was the third son, but survived by only 6 brothers.

It is assumed that Henry died before 1891.
