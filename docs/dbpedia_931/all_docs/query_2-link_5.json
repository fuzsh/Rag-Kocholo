        "text": "James E Boulter, Ph.D. (he/him/his)\n\nI joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire in 2004 and now hold joint appointments in the Departments of Public Health & Environmental Studies (PHES) and Chemistry & Biochemistry. I earned my Ph.D. in analytical chemistry with a specialization in atmospheric sciences from the University of Colorado, Boulder. I teach classes in general, analytical, and environmental chemistry, as well as radiation, air pollution, and sustainability. My research activities are split between laboratory and field studies of a wide range of atmospheric particulate matter and their impacts on climate and human health and public surveys in the US and China focused on perceptions of and responses to climate change.\n\nOver the past two decades, I have given dozens of public presentations on topics including: planetary atmospheric science, global and regional climate science, perceptions of and responses to climate change, the intersection of religious faith and climate, renewable and carbon-free energy, climate policy solutions, and sustainability. I was the former chancellor’s sustainability fellow at UW-Eau Claire, was the founding director of the Watershed Institute for Collaborative Environmental Studies (now PHES) and the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies, and I currently serve as the faculty advisor to the Student Office of Sustainability and serve on the Chancellor's Advisory Council on Sustainability. I have contributed to a variety of advisory committees for the City of Eau related to sustainability, and in various leadership roles with the Eau Claire chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby.\n\nTeaching Interests\n\nENPH 422, Radiation, Air Pollution, and Health\n\nENV 101, Sustainability Basics and Beyond\n\nENV 395, as Building Sustainability in the Academy\n\nENV 389, Taking the Measure of Sustainability\n\nCHEM 344, Modern Applied Separations and Spectrometry\n\nCHEM 304, Environmental Chemistry\n\nCHEM 213, Quantitative Analysis\n\nCHEM 115, Chemical Principles\n\nResponsibilities\n\nChair, Public Health and Environmental Studies\n\nFaculty Mentor, Student Office of Sustainability\n\nChancellor's Advisory Council on Sustainability\n\nResearch and Creative Activities\n\nUsing CO2 as a tracer for indoor air quality (campus covid response) - with Dr. Crispin Pierce\n\nDevelopment of a novel analytical approach to quantify respirable silica in occupational settings\n\nAssessment of AfterFire wipes for removal of carcinogenic material from skin surrogates\n\nPublic perceptions, beliefs, and understanding of climate change in the US & China - with Drs.

Air and Waste Manage. Assoc. 46, 1996, pp.891-898, DOI: 10.1080/10473289.1996.10467525.\n\nBlake, D.M., Wolfrum, E., Boulter, J., Prairie, M., Showalter, S., Rodacy, P., Leslie, P., Strange, B., “Photocatalytic Oxidation and Reduction Chemistry and a New Process for Treatment of Pink Water and Related Contaminated Water” NREL/TP-430-21580. Golden, CO: National Renewable Energy Laboratory, October 1996, DOI: 10.2172/395626.\n\nMy doctoral research at CU Boulder focused on atmospheric particulate matter and heterogeneous gas/solid atmospheric chemistry. I developed and characterized an aerosol inlet designed to separate atmospheric aerosol particles from interstitial air to eliminate gas-phase interferences in chemical analysis. Another part of my thesis research involved field testing a prototype instrument by measuring ozone concentrations within the arctic boundary layer at Summit, Greenland as part of a broader mission to characterize reactions of tropospheric oxidants in the upper, porous layer of the snowpack.\n\nBoulter, J.E., Cziczo, D.J., Middlebrook, A.M., Thomson, D.S., Murphy, D.M., “Design and Performance of a Pumped Counterflow Virtual Impactor” Aerosol Sci. & Tech. 40, 2006, pp.969-976, DOI: 10.1080/02786820600840984.\n\nHelmig D., Boulter J., David D., Birks J.W., Cullen N., Steffen K., “Ozone and Meteorological Boundary-Layer Conditions at Summit, Greenland.” Atmos. Env. 36, 2002, pp. 2595-2608, DOI: 10.1016/S1352-2310(02)00129-2.\n\nMy postdoctoral research at SRI International - and my early research with undergraduate students at UW-Eau Claire - extended my focus on heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry research to reactions on the surfaces of particles found in the upper atmosphere (ca. 85 km). These included recombination reactions of monatomic oxygen on amorphous water ice and mineral particles at very low temperatures.\n\nBoulter, J.E., Morgan, C.G., Marschall, J., “Ice Surfaces in the Mesosphere: Absence of Dangling Bonds in the Presence of Atomic Oxygen.” Geophys.

The context of this work is consistent with my focus on atmospheric sciences, gauging public perceptions of climate change science and mitigation policy approaches in the US and China.\n\nStroik, P., Chakraborty, D., Ge, W., Boulter, J., Jamelske, E., “Effect of Reciprocity on Public Opinion of International Climate Treaties: Experimental Evidence from the U.S. and China”, Climate Policy, 19 (8), 2019, pp. 959-973.

Currently, we are working on in situ quantification of airborne respirable silica particulate matter using a novel, highly sensitive chemiluminescent analytical approach.
