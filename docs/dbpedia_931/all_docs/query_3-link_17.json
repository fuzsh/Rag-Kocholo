        "meta_description": "This paper explores how the recent critical reassessment of the biographer and antiquarian John Aubrey (1626&ndash;97) and the increasing availability of his writings can reveal new perspectives on Marvell&rsquo;s early reception. Aubrey read all available instances of Marvell&rsquo;s writing and studied them carefully and incisively, but criticism has not yet examined his engagement with Marvell as a comprehensive whole. This reveals that his primary interest was in data gathering: I use Aubrey&rsquo;s letters, unpublished research manuscripts, and his biographical study Brief Lives, alongside the papers of his friend and collaborator Anthony Wood, to demonstrate how Marvell&rsquo;s verse and prose were recognized as a valuable source for antiquarian and biographical research by early readers. For example, Aubrey emphasizes the importance of Marvell&rsquo;s often neglected epitaphs. Aubrey also recognized that there were potential limitations for researchers using Marvell&rsquo;s writing, not least his tendency to &ldquo;severe&rdquo; representations of his subjects. This severity could also endanger readers themselves, and I show how Aubrey and Wood tried to counteract accusations in the 1690s that they had shared the &ldquo;Advice to a Painter&rdquo; satires. This case demonstrates how the printed editions of the 1660s continued to possess an exceptional reputation for sedition which could be reactivated at moments of heightened political tension, and which far outstripped their actual content.",

        "text": "“He had not a generall acquaintance”: so wrote John Aubrey of Marvell’s social habits in Brief Lives, no doubt highly conscious of the sharp difference with his own lifestyle.1 Indeed, Aubrey told his close friend and collaborator Anthony Wood that the latter had persuaded him that he was uniquely “fit” to undertake his biographical studies “by reason of my generall acquaintance” (37). And perhaps Aubrey and Marvell could not seem more different, particularly in the portrait the former gives us of Marvell as a withdrawn and near-paranoid genius who “would not play the good-fellow in any mans company, with whom in his \\whose/ hands he would not trust his life” (344). Yet they were also strangely similar: ambiguous Anglicans who had dabbled with popery but who were enmeshed with the nonconformist networks of the Restoration; public spirited (albeit in very different ways), with a strong sense of what public service entailed, and notably alcoholic even to their contemporaries.2 They were also writers caught between manuscript and print, a divide which Marvell navigated with much greater alacrity. While the biography in Brief Lives has done long service as a minor staple of Marvell criticism, usually furnishing choice quotations to illustrate broader arguments, a full reassessment of what Aubrey and Wood can contribute to scholarship about Marvell and his immediate reception has been lacking. Today a growing body of research is asserting Aubrey’s fundamental credibility and providing much readier access to his manuscripts, with the forthcoming Correspondence supplementing Kate Bennett’s magisterial edition of Brief Lives (2015). It is time to stop cherry-picking from Aubrey. By finally considering his engagement with Marvell as a whole, we can recognize that he provides a rare record of a close and extensive reader.\n\nAubrey was highly attentive to both Marvell’s prose and poetry, but not necessarily in the ways that we might expect. He confirms but also complicates Marvellian scholarship, while leaving us with new questions in need of answering: for example, while he is a strong witness to the contemporary prominence of Marvell’s neo-Latin poetry, the verse he was actually interested in disrupts longstanding critical hierarchies. This article collects everything we know of Aubrey’s reading into a new narrative. It supplies an overview of what an Auberian perspective on Marvell looks like, beginning with the Marvell biography in Brief Lives, before examining the evidence for how Aubrey used his works. Characteristically, Aubrey’s testimony is at once specific and elusive. Such a study is also necessarily inseparable from the work of Aubrey’s fellow biographer Wood, who included a life of Marvell in his entry on Samuel Parker in his Athenæ Oxonienses (1691–92). For while their opinions on Marvell’s writing diverged immensely—Wood sided with his friend Andrew Allam in hating Marvell’s guts but grudgingly respecting his pen—they nonetheless collaborated extensively, and their differing approaches to shared information highlights what was unique in the readings of each. This included sharing copies of the “Painter” poems, and this paper will conclude by examining how the jeopardy associated with these documents could be reactivated two decades after they were initially circulated: one misjudged prank was enough to send both Aubrey and Wood into total panic.\n\nConclusion\n\nAubrey certainly admired Marvell as an accomplished artist, and as a writer whose work underpinned his own research, but he also believed that readers had to be wary of the arch-satirist’s severity. The “Painter” poems remained uniquely incriminating, while accusations in satires such as “Tom May’s Death” had to be strictly corroborated. Aubrey also believed that this severity influenced the politicized Harrington epitaph. Yet this performative refusal to “play the good-fellow” was also what made Marvell such a compelling character study for Brief Lives, and made his work so valuable to antiquarians. As a civic writer of epitaphs, satire and controversy Marvell produced grounded writing that could be mined carefully for facts in a way that the work of other writers, such as Milton and Dryden, could not. However challenging, severity was preferable to panegyric. The absence of any specific reference to Marvell as a lyric poet remains striking, but a wider view of Aubrey’s writing indicates that naming Marvell as “an excellent poet in Latin or English” may have been considered sufficient. Aubrey greatly admired Waller’s lyric poetry, for example, but his life of Waller similarly only named his published “Poems”, “his Panagyrique to Oliver”, and his “verses of the Bermudas” (375). In the end our evidence for Aubrey’s reading remains heavily skewed by the antiquarian focus of his note-taking. What remains without question amid this wider elusiveness is Aubrey’s appreciation for and interest in Marvell, and he is a fine reminder that Marvell’s readers can be as hard to pin down as the man himself.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to thank Esther van Raamsdonk, Edward Holberton and William Poole for valuable discussions about Marvell and Aubrey.\n\nCompeting Interests\n\nThe author has no competing interests to declare.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nAubrey, John.
