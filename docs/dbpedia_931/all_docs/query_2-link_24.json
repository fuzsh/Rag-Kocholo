        "text": "In this podcast episode, you’ll hear stories about a man overcoming his obesity and depression through the magic of MMA fighting, a model who escapes the insidious modeling industry, a volunteer who helps restore an historic C-47 aircraft for the commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of D-Day and a mother making a difficult decision on the day of an important hunt.\n\nNote that the quality of the sound is not as perfect as we would like it to be. These stories are really worthwhile and we want you to hear them. Thank you.\n\nDave Boulter is an athlete who can no longer play sports. The resulting depression and weight gain drive him to try a sport he never thought he would try — MMA fighting. He calls his story “That Didn’t Hurt So Bad!”\n\nDave Boulter is a New England boy who moved to Montana early in the Spring of 1993. He graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in Forestry specializing in Recreation Management. He has been making his living as a Stone Mason for approximately 20 years and is a veteran athlete and coach in Mixed Martial Arts.\n\nAinsley McWha begins her modeling career at 16 and is enthralled by the glitz and glamor before she discovers the dark side of the industry and finally escapes.\n\nNear the end of Ainsley’s story, an unfortunate thing happens: she is heckled by someone in the audience who is not listening fully to her story. This sort of behavior is never appropriate. At the live event, I made that clear after Ainsly finished. I mention this here because I kept the heckler in the edit and bleeped her comment. Doing so retains the flow of the story and shows Ainsley’s strength in pushing through to finish her story.\n\nAinsley calls her story “Seen & Not Heard”.\n\nAinsley McWha is a writer and essayist whose work appears in the current issue of Barrelhouse Journal and has previously been published in Grist, Tahoma Literary Review, Salon, and the Washington Post, among others. She was recently appointed as the chair of the Parks & Rec committee in the town where she lives. She has never seen the sitcom.\n\nRead Ainsley’s writing about her experiences as a model at Salon, The Washington Post, Huffington Post (1), and Huffington Post (2).\n\nMare at ainsleymcwha.com.\n\nJohn Haines knows nothing about airplanes and loves a good cause, so he volunteers to help make “Miss Montana” airworthy so she can join the D-Day Squadron and the Daks Over Normandy in commemorating the 75th Anniversary of D-Day on June 6, 2019. (Miss Montana is a historic C-47 aircraft in the Museum of Mountain Flying in Missoula.) John calls his story “75 Years is a Good Start”.\n\nJohn Haines was born and raised in Plains, MT and lived in Kumamoto, Japan for ten years. John currently works at Ace hardware so he can volunteer at the Museum of Mountain Flying.\n\nMolly Bradford awakens on the day of the hunt to the sounds of her son coughing with the croup and has to decide if she should cancel the hunt. She calls her story “The Push and the Pull – or – Spilling Milk”\n\nMolly Bradford is the CEO and Co-founder at GatherBoard, the makers of MissoulaEvents.net. Molly takes community connection seriously, as an active member of the Missoula startup ecosystem in addition to her children’s scholastic and community endeavors. Molly is an avid yet amateur gardener, cook, skier, and hunter who likes to put up mass quantities of food for the winter, race her husband and kids down the slopes and makes telecommuting from Mexico a family priority.\n\nTranscript : \"Tipping Point\" Part 2\n\n00:00\n\nwelcome to tell us something\n\n00:02\n\n[Applause]\n\n00:11\n\ndave bolter is a new england boy who\n\n00:14\n\nmoved to

of ottawa\n\n12:17\n\ncanada’s capital\n\n12:20\n\ni was a straight a student i benchwarmed\n\n12:23\n\nfor the basketball team\n\n12:25\n\ni’d never been on a date i happily wore\n\n12:28\n\nthe same baggy jeans and gray zip up\n\n12:30\n\nhoodie to school\n\n12:31\n\nevery day and the only fashion magazines\n\n12:34\n\ni ever flipped through\n\n12:36\n\nwere the 17s that came to my house every\n\n12:38\n\nmonth addressed my older sister\n\n12:41\n\nso it came as a huge surprise to\n\n12:42\n\neveryone but mostly me\n\n12:45\n\nthat after a series of events i won’t go\n\n12:47\n\ninto now\n\n12:48\n\ni was scouted discovered by one of\n\n12:51\n\nmanhattan’s top\n\n12:52\n\nmodeling agencies the weekend before my\n\n12:56\n\n17th birthday i was flown to paris to\n\n12:58\n\nwalk in my first fashion show\n\n13:01\n\nbackstage before the show christian dior\n\n13:04\n\nspring summer 95 that was held in the\n\n13:07\n\ncarousel de louvre\n\n13:08\n\ni sat next to models that even i had\n\n13:10\n\nheard of linda evangelista helena\n\n13:12\n\nchristensen\n\n13:13\n\ntyra banks the champagne flowed\n\n13:17\n\nthe camera flashes popped the show\n\n13:19\n\nitself was a blur\n\n13:21\n\nbut paris was so beautiful\n\n13:25\n\nthat’s what i told my friends and family\n\n13:27\n\nwhen i got home\n\n13:28\n\nand this is what i didn’t tell them that\n\n13:31\n\nat the fitting\n\n13:32\n\nthe day before the show when it was my\n\n13:34\n\nturn to get my outfit approved\n\n13:37\n\nthe designer an older italian man\n\n13:39\n\nstepped towards me\n\n13:41\n\nand without saying a word he ripped off\n\n13:43\n\nmy shirt\n\n13:45\n\nnext with his bare hands he tried to\n\n13:48\n\nreadjust my breasts\n\n13:50\n\ninto something that would better fit his\n\n13:51\n\ncreation as if i were merely a block of\n\n13:54\n\nclay\n\n13:55\n\nand when it was clear this wasn’t going\n\n13:56\n\nto happen he just turned and walked away\n\n13:58\n\nfrom me\n\n13:59\n\nleaving me standing there half naked in\n\n14:01\n\na room full of strangers\n\n14:05\n\ni rushed to find my own clothes that i\n\n14:07\n\nhad left folded in a neat pile in the\n\n14:08\n\ncorner somewhere\n\n14:09\n\nand i was stopped multiple times by\n\n14:11\n\nother models who said things like oh my\n\n14:13\n\ngod the designer noticed you and\n\n14:14\n\noh my god you are so lucky and as i\n\n14:17\n\nfought to hold back the tears welling in\n\n14:19\n\nmy eyes\n\n14:20\n\ni was confused because not only was the\n\n14:23\n\ndesigner’s behavior\n\n14:24\n\nacceptable it was enviable\n\n14:28\n\nand i don’t know how i knew it but i did\n\n14:31\n\nknow\n\n14:32\n\nin that moment that if i wanted to\n\n14:34\n\nsucceed in this business\n\n14:35\n\ni’d need to learn how to keep my mouth\n\n14:37\n\nshut and of course i wanted to succeed i\n\n14:40\n\nwas 16 years old\n\n14:42\n\nand i just been invited into this elite\n\n14:43\n\nindustry i was wooed by its promise of\n\n14:46\n\ntravel and money and fame\n\n14:48\n\nof escape one month after i graduated\n\n14:52\n\nhigh school when i was 17 years old\n\n14:54\n\ni moved to new york city unknowingly\n\n14:57\n\nabout to embark on a career\n\n14:58\n\nthat sells sex before i’d even had sex\n\n15:03\n\nfor the next three years i jumped from\n\n15:05\n\nmarket to market milan paris london\n\n15:08\n\nhamburg new york\n\n15:09\n\nand at first i loved it i shot for\n\n15:11\n\ncountless magazines i wore high-fashion\n\n15:13\n\nclothes on the runway\n\n15:15\n\nthere were vip parties complete with\n\n15:17\n\ncelebrity interactions there were free\n\n15:19\n\ndinners free drinks\n\n15:20\n\nand yet when i was 20 i couldn’t keep up\n\n15:22\n\nwith the pressures inherent in the\n\n15:24\n\nindustry anymore like\n\n15:26\n\nthe imposed thinness and the constant\n\n15:28\n\nrelocation\n\n15:30\n\nbefore the internet living abroad was an\n\n15:32\n\nextremely isolating experience\n\n15:35\n\nwhich only compounded my feelings of\n\n15:37\n\ndepression\n\n15:38\n\nand again i was confused because here i\n\n15:40\n\nwas surrounded by all these things\n\n15:42\n\nyou’re supposed to want\n\n15:43\n\nto have here i was surrounded by people\n\n15:45\n\nconstantly telling me how\n\n15:47\n\nlucky i was and yet i didn’t feel that\n\n15:50\n\nway\n\n15:51\n\nfortunately my parents insisted i go\n\n15:53\n\nback to school which i did and i got a\n\n15:55\n\ndegree in psychology\n\n15:56\n\nbut the spring before i graduated i was\n\n15:58\n\nscouted to model again\n\n16:00\n\nand i figured that modeling could be a\n\n16:01\n\ngreat way to make some money in the\n\n16:02\n\nshort term\n\n16:04\n\ni mean i possessed the skill set and i\n\n16:07\n\nfigured that i was strong enough to\n\n16:08\n\nhandle anything\n\n16:09\n\nthe industry threw out me this time\n\n16:11\n\naround i was sucked back in\n\n16:15\n\nin the fall of 2012 i was 35 years old\n\n16:18\n\nliving in new york and my job still was\n\n16:21\n\nmodel\n\n16:22\n\nand though the nature of the bookings\n\n16:24\n\nhad changed over the course of my career\n\n16:26\n\nfrom magazine covers and campaigns to\n\n16:29\n\nwhat\n\n16:29\n\nthose in the industry referred to as the\n\n16:32\n\ncloset\n\n16:33\n\ni spent days sitting in a windowless\n\n16:36\n\nroom sometimes as small as four by ten\n\n16:38\n\nfeet\n\n16:38\n\nsometimes bigger sometimes alone and\n\n16:41\n\nsometimes with other models\n\n16:42\n\nand i’d wait until somebody brought me\n\n16:45\n\nan outfit or\n\n16:46\n\n100 to try on and model for the buyers\n\n16:49\n\nfrom upscale department stores\n\n16:51\n\nand boutiques in the adjacent showroom\n\n16:55\n\nnow there are many times over the course\n\n16:56\n\nof my career when i probably should have\n\n16:58\n\nconsidered quitting\n\n17:00\n\nlike that first fashion show for example\n\n17:03\n\nor when i was 19\n\n17:04\n\nand an agent invited me into his office\n\n17:06\n\nand told me to not eat anything for the\n\n17:08\n\nnext two days\n\n17:09\n\nand over the next two weeks to really\n\n17:11\n\nwatch what i ate but\n\n17:12\n\ndrink a lot of water or when i was 25\n\n17:15\n\nand my agent suggested that i never tell\n\n17:17\n\nanyone i had a university degree\n\n17:20\n\nbecause it might make people feel bad\n\n17:21\n\nabout themselves\n\n17:23\n\nor when i was 31 or when i was 31\n\n17:28\n\nand a designer spit in my face on set at\n\n17:30\n\na photo shoot because\n\n17:32\n\nhe decided he didn’t like me\n\n17:35\n\nand while all of those instances and\n\n17:37\n\nothers made me\n\n17:38\n\nfeel less than worthless more than\n\n17:41\n\nworthless\n\n17:43\n\ni never said anything because i had\n\n17:44\n\nlearned from the start that to speak up\n\n17:46\n\nmeant to be difficult\n\n17:47\n\nand to be difficult meant to be\n\n17:48\n\noverlooked for jobs jobs that sometimes\n\n17:50\n\ncame\n\n17:51\n\nwith a huge paycheck\n\n17:54\n\nand that’s the thing about modeling the\n\n17:57\n\nmoney isn’t always there\n\n17:58\n\nbut the promise of money is\n\n18:01\n\nwhich is how i lasted in the business as\n\n18:04\n\nlong as i did\n\n18:05\n\nthat and as time passed i came to\n\n18:06\n\nbelieve i wasn’t capable of doing\n\n18:08\n\nanything else\n\n18:10\n\non a monday afternoon in november 2012\n\n18:13\n\nas i stood out in the showroom\n\n18:14\n\nmodeling my next outfit one of the\n\n18:17\n\nbuyers looked me in the eye\n\n18:18\n\nan older man and he said that shirt\n\n18:21\n\nmakes your belly look\n\n18:22\n\nbig that wasn’t a big deal i was\n\n18:26\n\nso used to comments like that comments\n\n18:27\n\ndissecting my appearance and telling me\n\n18:29\n\nwhat was wrong with me to my face\n\n18:32\n\ni was numb to comments like that what\n\n18:34\n\nmade this time so\n\n18:36\n\nspecial was that he said it to me as i\n\n18:38\n\nstood next to a model who had just\n\n18:40\n\nannounced in the closet that she was\n\n18:41\n\npregnant\n\n18:42\n\nfive months along she hadn’t told the\n\n18:46\n\nclient\n\n18:46\n\nyet and i got this because she like the\n\n18:48\n\nrest of us was hired for her exact\n\n18:50\n\nmeasurements\n\n18:51\n\nand to deviate even a centimeter meant\n\n18:53\n\nto possibly lose her job\n\n18:56\n\nso in cahoots with the dresser the woman\n\n18:58\n\nwhose job it was to\n\n19:00\n\nhelp us get dressed uh the pregnant\n\n19:02\n\nmodel ensured that all\n\n19:04\n\nof the baggier clothes went to her\n\n19:06\n\nleaving me with all the form-fitting\n\n19:08\n\nones\n\n19:10\n\nwhen i got home at the end of the day my\n\n19:12\n\nbooker called ainsley\n\n19:14\n\nare you on your period yes i said\n\n19:18\n\ni lied oh good i assured the client that\n\n19:20\n\nmust be the case but they still ask that\n\n19:22\n\nyou don’t come back to work this week\n\n19:26\n\nnow it’s important to note here that at\n\n19:27\n\nthis time i was in my second year of\n\n19:29\n\ngrad school getting an mfa in creative\n\n19:31\n\nwriting\n\n19:32\n\nbut i’m ashamed to say that up until\n\n19:34\n\nthree years earlier i hadn’t even known\n\n19:36\n\nthat an mfa in creative writing was a\n\n19:37\n\nthing\n\n19:38\n\ni had been so sheltered by this industry\n\n19:41\n\ni had remained so amenable to it\n\n19:44\n\nbut i had gravitated towards writing\n\n19:46\n\nbecause i had amassed so many stories\n\n19:48\n\nand i wanted to learn the best way to\n\n19:50\n\ntell them but i still didn’t know what i\n\n19:52\n\nwas going to do once my career ended i\n\n19:54\n\nmean it’s not like anyone in the\n\n19:55\n\nindustry cares to help you figure out\n\n19:57\n\nwhat’s next you’re valuable to them\n\n19:59\n\nuntil you just aren’t\n\n20:00\n\nso it was as if i existed every day\n\n20:02\n\nliving on a conveyor belt\n\n20:03\n\na lineup of hungry women behind me\n\n20:06\n\nthinner younger\n\n20:07\n\nprettier versions of myself ready to\n\n20:09\n\nknock me off\n\n20:10\n\nat any moment and into the oblivion of\n\n20:12\n\nold age\n\n20:15\n\nwhen i hung up the phone with my booker\n\n20:16\n\ni started to cry\n\n20:18\n\nand i knew in that moment something\n\n20:20\n\nneeded to change\n\n20:23\n\na year and a half later my then\n\n20:24\n\nboyfriend and i left new york city and\n\n20:26\n\nmoved to southeast idaho\n\n20:28\n\nof all places and into the house\n\n20:33\n\nand into the house that his\n\n20:34\n\ngreat-great-grandparents built in 1914\n\n20:37\n\ni’d never lived i’d never been to idaho\n\n20:40\n\nbefore but i’ve lived in many places and\n\n20:42\n\ni reasoned you can build a life anywhere\n\n20:44\n\nwhich is exactly what we’ve done over\n\n20:45\n\nthe past five and a half years\n\n20:47\n\nand it hasn’t always been easy i’ve\n\n20:49\n\nworked so many odd jobs i was a\n\n20:51\n\ncommunity counselor for a while\n\n20:53\n\ni was a substitute high school teacher\n\n20:55\n\nfor three days\n\n20:57\n\ni did it wasn’t for me i\n\n21:00\n\ni do copy editing for a home healthcare\n\n21:03\n\ncompany i even worked in a retail\n\n21:04\n\nclothing store for a while\n\n21:07\n\nand with each of those jobs i was lucky\n\n21:09\n\nto get paid in two weeks what i used to\n\n21:11\n\nearn\n\n21:11\n\nin a day sometimes even an hour as a\n\n21:13\n\nmodel\n\n21:15\n\nand yeah that was tough to take at first\n\n21:18\n\nbut now i can honestly say that even\n\n21:21\n\nthough i have far\n\n21:22\n\nless i have never felt luckier\n\n21:31\n\n[Applause]\n\n21:32\n\n[Music]\n\n21:36\n\nthat boyfriend became my husband we look\n\n21:38\n\nafter each other our home and a dozen\n\n21:40\n\nanimals\n\n21:43\n\ni have a garden i finally understand the\n\n21:46\n\nvalue of a hard-earned dollar\n\n21:48\n\nand i finally understand that my worth\n\n21:50\n\nas a human comes from more than being a\n\n21:51\n\ndesirable object\n\n21:58\n\nand it wasn’t until i left the industry\n\n22:02\n\nthat i understood the extent of the\n\n22:05\n\npsychological damage that had been\n\n22:06\n\ninflicted\n\n22:08\n\nthis industry that had socialized me\n\n22:11\n\nthis industry that had treated me the\n\n22:12\n\nsame at 36 as it had at 16\n\n22:15\n\nand i was the ideal candidate i’m\n\n22:17\n\nashamed to say i was an eager\n\n22:19\n\nmalleable teenager willing to do\n\n22:21\n\nwhatever it took in order to succeed\n\n22:23\n\nwhich is exactly what the industry is\n\n22:25\n\ncounting on\n\n22:26\n\nbut i’m more ashamed that i didn’t speak\n\n22:28\n\nup when i saw these things\n\n22:30\n\nthat made me feel uncomfortable\n\n22:34\n\nand the things that i knew were wrong\n\n22:37\n\nin january i’m about to start a new job\n\n22:39\n\ni was recently hired by the college of\n\n22:41\n\neastern idaho to create and teach\n\n22:43\n\ntheir first creative writing class for\n\n22:45\n\ncredit taught on campus\n\n22:48\n\nand i can’t

discover\n\n23:01\n\nthe transformative power that can come\n\n23:03\n\nfrom finally using them\n\n23:05\n\nthank you\n\n23:08\n\n[Applause]\n\n23:14\n\n[Music]\n\n23:36\n\nthank you

haynes\n\n25:04\n\ni am the volunteer coordinator out at\n\n25:06\n\nthe museum of mountain flying\n\n25:10\n\n[Applause]\n\n25:11\n\nbut it hasn’t always been that way on\n\n25:14\n\njanuary 3rd\n\n25:15\n\nof this year was my first day\n\n25:17\n\nvolunteering at the museum\n\n25:20\n\ni opened up the door and i saw a 75 year\n\n25:23\n\nold dc3\n\n25:25\n\nwell a nearly 75 year old dc3\n\n25:28\n\nit first came off the assembly line with\n\n25:30\n\nthe purpose of hauling people on cargo\n\n25:33\n\nduring world war ii it didn’t see\n\n25:35\n\nservice beyond the american borders\n\n25:37\n\nbut it would have a great life ahead of\n\n25:40\n\nit\n\n25:48\n\njohnson flying service bought it as a\n\n25:50\n\nsurf surplus plane\n\n25:52\n\nin 1946 and used it for smoke jumping\n\n25:55\n\nand and hauling cargo all over the\n\n25:57\n\nregion in\n\n25:58\n\nuh very rural areas\n\n26:02\n\nwhat i saw on that night was that we had\n\n26:04\n\na goal of getting it\n\n26:06\n\nto fly by march which was interesting\n\n26:09\n\nbecause\n\n26:10\n\nit had no engines on it\n\n26:13\n\nthe the interior was taken apart\n\n26:16\n\nand waiting for modern amenities like\n\n26:20\n\ngood insulation and avionics to be\n\n26:22\n\ninstalled\n\n26:23\n\nthere is no operational avion\n\n26:26\n\nor controls for the the flight it was\n\n26:29\n\nbasically a shell of the plane that it\n\n26:31\n\nwas about to become\n\n26:33\n\nwith that in mind my first job there was\n\n26:36\n\nto build\n\n26:37\n\nshelves for the red shed in the museum\n\n26:40\n\nand i thought well\n\n26:41\n\nthat’s not too sexy\n\n26:43\n\n[Laughter]\n\n26:46\n\nbut when i came back later a lot of the\n\n26:48\n\ntools and paperwork that were screwing\n\n26:50\n\nacross the floor when i got there were\n\n26:52\n\nin the shed and organized and you soon\n\n26:54\n\nrealized\n\n26:55\n\nthat it doesn’t matter what job you are\n\n26:57\n\ndoing\n\n26:58\n\nit is all important for the big picture\n\n27:01\n\nmy second job that i can remember doing\n\n27:03\n\nwas getting onto one of those scissor\n\n27:05\n\nlifts and going up\n\n27:06\n\ninto the nose of the plane with it in\n\n27:09\n\nmind\n\n27:10\n\nto take some of the hoses out that were\n\n27:12\n\nconnected to the\n\n27:13\n\nthe back of the dashboard that measured\n\n27:15\n\nthings like fuel and oil\n\n27:17\n\nand i was supposed to put the labels\n\n27:19\n\nthat were written on the hoses\n\n27:21\n\nonto the ports that they’re connected to\n\n27:24\n\nwhich became\n\n27:25\n\ninteresting fast because i saw two or\n\n27:28\n\nthree labels that said the exact same\n\n27:30\n\nthing\n\n27:31\n\nleft engine fuel possibly oil\n\n27:39\n\nwell february and march came\n\n27:43\n\nand went and we had a lot of progress\n\n27:45\n\nbut\n\n27:47\n\nthe plane hadn’t flown in about\n\n27:51\n\nsometime in april our lead mechanics\n\n27:53\n\nparents showed up from arizona and they\n\n27:55\n\ndrove up in their rv\n\n27:56\n\nand were they intended on staying for\n\n27:58\n\nabout two weeks\n\n28:01\n\nbill is one of those people that’s a\n\n28:02\n\ngood example of the type of volunteers\n\n28:04\n\nwe had out there he’s 70\n\n28:06\n\nplus years old and a dynamo he could be\n\n28:09\n\neverywhere at once\n\n28:10\n\nand working on just about anything on\n\n28:12\n\nthe plane and feel very comfortable with\n\n28:14\n\nit\n\n28:15\n\nand he would tell you a good story the\n\n28:17\n\nwhole time\n\n28:19\n\nhis wife age and some health issues had\n\n28:23\n\ncaught up with her\n\n28:24\n\nso what would happen in the afternoon is\n\n28:27\n\nshe would need a break\n\n28:28\n\nand go back to their rv and stay there a\n\n28:32\n\nwhile\n\n28:32\n\nand when she wanted to come back she’d\n\n28:35\n\nhonk the horn\n\n28:36\n\nand and bill would scurry off and wash\n\n28:39\n\nall the oil products off his hands\n\n28:41\n\nand bring her back out to to help us out\n\n28:45\n\nafter a few rounds of the honk honk one\n\n28:48\n\nof our volunteers said\n\n28:49\n\nthat’s love a few days\n\n28:52\n\nafter that it happened we’d hear hong\n\n28:55\n\nkong and a chorus of\n\n28:56\n\nthat’s love\n\n29:01\n\napril again a lot of progress\n\n29:04\n\nbut it was not or miss montana was not\n\n29:07\n\nairborne yet\n\n29:09\n\nbut we’re getting more and more\n\n29:10\n\nconfident as time went on\n\n29:12\n\nin the first week of may now keep in\n\n29:15\n\nmind we’re having our send-off gala for\n\n29:17\n\na plane that hadn’t flown on the weekend\n\n29:19\n\nof mother’s day\n\n29:21\n\non the saturday before mother’s day in\n\n29:23\n\nthe first week of may\n\n29:25\n\nwe realized if we’re going to practice\n\n29:28\n\nour jump for the normandy\n\n29:30\n\nceremony we needed a drop zone\n\n29:34\n\nin and i saw that as an opportunity\n\n29:37\n\nto pitch plains montana my hometown\n\n29:42\n\nit’s about an hour and a half drive but\n\n29:44\n\na 20-minute flight so it was perfect\n\n29:46\n\num now al charters who was our jump\n\n29:50\n\nmaster and i\n\n29:50\n\ndrove up to planes and al got about a 10\n\n29:53\n\nminutes\n\n29:54\n\nnoticed for this plan so he showed up to\n\n29:56\n\nthe hangar and he said\n\n29:57\n\nal we’re going up to planes to find a\n\n29:59\n\ndrop zone\n\n30:01\n\nmind you al isn’t very tall in stature\n\n30:05\n\nbut he can fill up a room with his\n\n30:08\n\nself-confidence\n\n30:09\n\nand sense of purpose and i was a little\n\n30:12\n\nintimidated by it\n\n30:13\n\num but i i was willing to take the risk\n\n30:17\n\ni’m back so\n\n30:21\n\nwe drove up to planes and we talked to\n\n30:23\n\nthe person who manages\n\n30:24\n\nthe airport up there and we went out to\n\n30:27\n\nvisit the airport\n\n30:29\n\nand and al looks around\n\n30:32\n\nand he says\n\n30:36\n\nit would work on a perfect day\n\n30:40\n\nand i think we both knew that a perfect\n\n30:43\n\nday is tough to plan\n\n30:44\n\nfor so we drove back and talked to the\n\n30:47\n\nmanager at the airport who is in\n\n30:49\n\nin high gear for lobbying for this\n\n30:51\n\nbecause he he wanted\n\n30:52\n\nan event like this to happen in little\n\n30:54\n\nold plains montana\n\n30:56\n\nand we said well maybe and i had the\n\n31:00\n\nidea of calling the people who owned the\n\n31:01\n\nholland ranch\n\n31:02\n\njust west of town the\n\n31:06\n\nso i called up daisy holland and i said\n\n31:09\n\ndaisy\n\n31:10\n\nhave you heard about the miss montana\n\n31:12\n\nproject\n\n31:13\n\nand she said well yes i have i said\n\n31:17\n\nyou know we need a drop zone for our\n\n31:20\n\npractice jump and we’d like to use your\n\n31:22\n\nfield just west of town\n\n31:23\n\ni said well sure so basically\n\n31:27\n\nwe had two 30-second conversations to\n\n31:29\n\nget yes so the support was there\n\n31:31\n\nand it was it was a really neat thing we\n\n31:34\n\nended up meeting with daisy\n\n31:36\n\nand the manager of the airport and we\n\n31:39\n\nwe got everything confirmed but we did\n\n31:42\n\nnot know\n\n31:43\n\nwhat day this would end up happening so\n\n31:45\n\nwe said we have to keep this a secret\n\n31:48\n\nfor any of you who have ever been to a\n\n31:50\n\nsmall town the best way to promote\n\n31:52\n\nsomething\n\n31:53\n\nis to tell people to keep it a secret\n\n32:00\n\nso that was the first week in may we had\n\n32:03\n\nour send off gala\n\n32:04\n\nwithout the plane flying on a saturday\n\n32:06\n\nnight and we\n\n32:07\n\npartied like it was gonna happen let me\n\n32:09\n\ntell you it was it was a really fun\n\n32:11\n\nevent\n\n32:12\n\nthat next sunday was mother’s day and\n\n32:15\n\nmy mom is in the audience i’d like to\n\n32:17\n\nsay thank you for allowing me to skip\n\n32:19\n\nmother’s day this year\n\n32:21\n\nbecause miss montana flew and i\n\n32:25\n\ngot the techs at work and i took off\n\n32:27\n\nfrom work and i showed up to the airport\n\n32:29\n\nand for once i was happy that miss\n\n32:31\n\nmontana hadn’t flown yet\n\n32:33\n\nwe there was about 60 of us out there\n\n32:36\n\nand a lot of us were the long-term\n\n32:39\n\nvolunteers there that that had put\n\n32:43\n\nsome of us were working 40 hours a day\n\n32:45\n\nand volunteering 30 or 40 hours on top\n\n32:47\n\nof that and it was absolutely fun i\n\n32:48\n\nwouldn’t trade it for\n\n32:50\n\nanything and that evening\n\n32:53\n\nthe plane took off and took its first\n\n32:55\n\nflight\n\n32:56\n\nin over 18 years and made it around the\n\n32:59\n\nvalley of missoula\n\n33:01\n\nwe were so excited it landed and for a\n\n33:03\n\nlot of us\n\n33:04\n\nthere may not have been a dry eye and\n\n33:07\n\nyou could blame it on the on the\n\n33:09\n\nspringtime allergies\n\n33:10\n\nor maybe the cool breeze that was\n\n33:13\n\nblowing but i’d like to think\n\n33:15\n\nit was all that perseverance and\n\n33:17\n\npatience\n\n33:18\n\nand hard work and hong kong that’s love\n\n33:28\n\nthat next day was a monday and they\n\n33:31\n\nstill needed to get some flight time so\n\n33:33\n\nthey took a practice flight up to\n\n33:35\n\nthrough my hometown the valley of plains\n\n33:38\n\nup to kalispell and back to missoula\n\n33:39\n\nwithout too much incident at least that\n\n33:41\n\nthey’ll talk about\n\n33:43\n\nand that night i had driven up to planes\n\n33:47\n\nand we made it official we were going to\n\n33:49\n\ndo our practice jump in planes and\n\n33:52\n\ni it was like christmas eve i was so\n\n33:54\n\nexcited i could barely\n\n33:56\n\nsleep so i had contacted\n\n33:59\n\na friend at the plain school system and\n\n34:02\n\nthey had let the entire school\n\n34:04\n\nout to watch this happen and they got\n\n34:07\n\nonto the football field\n\n34:08\n\nat 8 30 and guess what we weren’t going\n\n34:12\n\nto show up on time\n\n34:18\n\nthe plane had was going to fly\n\n34:21\n\neast to west so it flew over the entire\n\n34:23\n\ntown\n\n34:25\n\nright over the school and it was also\n\n34:27\n\nconveniently located the flight path\n\n34:29\n\nright between the hospital and the\n\n34:32\n\ncemetery\n\n34:33\n\nthankfully we didn’t need to use either\n\n34:35\n\none of those\n\n34:39\n\nthe the plane was coming and and we were\n\n34:43\n\nable to track it on flight tracker but\n\n34:44\n\nthe folks at the school didn’t know and\n\n34:46\n\nsome of the kids and teachers were\n\n34:47\n\ngetting a little impatient so they\n\n34:48\n\nstarted to walk back into the school\n\n34:50\n\nespecially the younger ones and a friend\n\n34:52\n\nof mine texted me well where’s the plane\n\n34:55\n\nand i said i gave it a few seconds\n\n34:56\n\nbecause i knew it was probably\n\n34:58\n\nbetween quinn’s hot springs and paradise\n\n35:00\n\nand i said\n\n35:01\n\nlisten and as that plane\n\n35:05\n\ncame into the valley you can hear those\n\n35:07\n\ntwo 1200 horsepower pratt and whitney’s\n\n35:10\n\nand it’s a two-for-one deal\n\n35:12\n\nyou feel it in both your heart and your\n\n35:14\n\nsoul\n\n35:16\n\nand it came over town and did a loop and\n\n35:19\n\ncame back out\n\n35:20\n\nand the first for the jump and the first\n\n35:23\n\npeople\n\n35:24\n\nto come out of the plane were kim\n\n35:25\n\nmaynard and amanda\n\n35:27\n\nholt kim happens to be one of the first\n\n35:30\n\nfemale smoke jumpers\n\n35:31\n\never and it was\n\n35:36\n\ndamn straight\n\n35:40\n\nso she came out and landed and\n\n35:43\n\neverything went off beautifully and we\n\n35:44\n\nmade a few more passes because\n\n35:46\n\nthere was several jumpers involved and\n\n35:50\n\nby the end of it we all gathered\n\n35:53\n\ntogether and that people were actually\n\n35:55\n\nspread out and it took a while to get us\n\n35:57\n\ntogether\n\n35:57\n\nand a recently retired smoke jumper who\n\n36:00\n\nlived in plains\n\n36:01\n\nhad brought vintage 1990 smoke jumper\n\n36:04\n\nbeer for this special occasion\n\n36:08\n\nthey say beer goes bad but boy it tasted\n\n36:10\n\ngood at 11 o’clock in the morning\n\n36:14\n\nwe’re the beer bottles were clanking and\n\n36:16\n\nwe were\n\n36:17\n\nabsolutely ecstatic that all systems\n\n36:19\n\nwere a go for mechanically and with the\n\n36:21\n\njumpers\n\n36:22\n\nand we came to realize right there\n\n36:25\n\nthat we went from knowing that we could\n\n36:28\n\ndo this\n\n36:29\n\nto actually proving it and miss montana\n\n36:35\n\nflew about 10 days later and left for\n\n36:39\n\nnormandy\n\n36:40\n\nand believe it or not it left missoula\n\n36:43\n\nwith\n\n36:44\n\nless than six or seven flight hours\n\n36:47\n\nand it made it to the east coast without\n\n36:49\n\nan incident and it took\n\n36:50\n\nthe blue spruce route back to europe so\n\n36:53\n\nit went\n\n36:54\n\nconnecticut maine up into canada and\n\n36:57\n\nnewfoundland\n\n36:58\n\nand a few places in greenland that i\n\n37:00\n\ncannot pronounce\n\n37:01\n\nreykjavik iceland scotland and down to\n\n37:04\n\nengland where they were staging for the\n\n37:05\n\nceremonies for normandy\n\n37:09\n\nwhen it was all said and done and they\n\n37:11\n\nmade it back to montana there was only\n\n37:12\n\none minor mechanical issue that was\n\n37:14\n\neasily taken care of\n\n37:16\n\nif you ask me i didn’t do the work\n\n37:21\n\num and it was absolutely amazing it was\n\n37:23\n\nonly the start\n\n37:24\n\nthroughout the summer we were involved\n\n37:26\n\nwith quite a few events\n\n37:28\n\nand one of them was to help commemorate\n\n37:31\n\nthe man gold’s tragedy that 12 smoke\n\n37:33\n\njumpers and a firefighter passed away in\n\n37:35\n\nnear helena\n\n37:36\n\nand it was very moving it happened to be\n\n37:38\n\nthe 70th anniversary of that\n\n37:40\n\nand another one was toward the end\n\n37:44\n\nin september we were able to go to\n\n37:46\n\nflorida and the bahamas\n\n37:48\n\nto do what the plane was built for and\n\n37:49\n\nhelp out the folks the folks that were\n\n37:51\n\nvery\n\n37:52\n\nin had a tough time due to hurricane\n\n37:55\n\ndorian we were flying 20\n\n37:57\n\n000 meals a day and it was hot barbecue\n\n37:59\n\nstuff i’ve never been in a plane that\n\n38:01\n\nsmelled so good\n\n38:05\n\nthank you so much and honestly the miss\n\n38:07\n\nmontana project could not have happened\n\n38:09\n\nwithout the support of so many people it\n\n38:11\n\nwas absolutely

leaning\n\n40:09\n\ninto the wet sandy bank\n\n40:11\n\nwith detailed certainty that a large\n\n40:14\n\nherd was going to\n\n40:15\n\nexit the forest and come into the field\n\n40:18\n\nat about sunset\n\n40:19\n\ni knew that there were at least three or\n\n40:21\n\nfour monster bucks\n\n40:23\n\nin the herd i looked up and the sun\n\n40:27\n\nwas about 15 minutes from setting over\n\n40:29\n\nthe bitterroot mountains\n\n40:30\n\nwhich meant there were only 45 minutes\n\n40:33\n\nof hunting hours left\n\n40:35\n\nand my pocket vibrated\n\n40:38\n\nit was a text from my husband spencer\n\n40:41\n\nwilliam\n\n40:41\n\nhas been crying off and on for a couple\n\n40:44\n\nhours and he won’t take a bottle\n\n40:46\n\nhow’s the hunt going\n\n40:51\n\nthe hunt was going great until then\n\n41:02\n\nalthough my breast pump lay a couple\n\n41:04\n\nhundred yards away in the truck and i\n\n41:06\n\nwas engorged under my camo\n\n41:09\n\ni thought to myself am i gonna call off\n\n41:12\n\nthis hunt for the second\n\n41:13\n\ntime today you see much earlier that\n\n41:16\n\nmorning i had woken up before my\n\n41:18\n\nalarm in a state of shock wondering why\n\n41:21\n\nthere was an\n\n41:21\n\namplified baby seal barking in the next\n\n41:24\n\nroom\n\n41:25\n\nbut it was not a seal it was my baby my\n\n41:28\n\nson\n\n41:29\n\nhe was actually struggling to breathe\n\n41:32\n\nand coughing with what would be his\n\n41:34\n\nfirst of nearly 20\n\n41:36\n\nbouts of croup i rushed to william’s\n\n41:39\n\ncrib\n\n41:39\n\nand picked him up and luckily i was able\n\n41:41\n\nto pretty quickly stabilize his\n\n41:43\n\nbreathing\n\n41:44\n\nand then the dread set in today was my\n\n41:47\n\nday to go\n\n41:48\n\nhunting it’s opening day i needed a day\n\n41:52\n\noff\n\n41:52\n\nand this hunt was a gift a friend of\n\n41:55\n\nmine with a farm south of hamilton had\n\n41:57\n\noffered me\n\n41:58\n\nan opening day mother’s hunt it was like\n\n42:01\n\na sure thing\n\n42:02\n\ngoing to the going to go hunting for for\n\n42:05\n\nvenison at the grocery store almost\n\n42:08\n\nand i thought to myself do i go on the\n\n42:11\n\nhunt do i cancel\n\n42:13\n\nis it fair to deprive myself of a day\n\n42:16\n\noff is it fair to leave my sick child\n\n42:18\n\nwith my husband and daughter\n\n42:19\n\ndo i cancel on taylor taylor and\n\n42:22\n\nmeredith had taught me to hunt\n\n42:24\n\na few years before that i primarily\n\n42:27\n\nhunted with other women and mothers\n\n42:29\n\nwe had a long-standing relationship with\n\n42:31\n\nour produce\n\n42:33\n\ngrowing fruits and vegetables trading\n\n42:35\n\nthem putting them up for the winter\n\n42:36\n\nit was a large group of women who wanted\n\n42:39\n\na similar relationship with their meat\n\n42:41\n\nthat they had with their produce so\n\n42:44\n\nspencer and i decided if william was\n\n42:46\n\ndoing better\n\n42:47\n\nduring the day and the hunt could be\n\n42:49\n\npostponed until the afternoon\n\n42:51\n\nthat was a good alternative and so\n\n42:54\n\nhere i was leaned in on the sandy bank\n\n42:57\n\nand i knew that the hunt was on\n\n43:00\n\njust a little while before i’d found my\n\n43:02\n\nposition i had walked over\n\n43:04\n\na well-trodden game trail with fresh\n\n43:07\n\nhoof prints in the sand\n\n43:08\n\nand droppings and tons of sign\n\n43:12\n\nof deer the hair was standing up on the\n\n43:15\n\nback of my neck\n\n43:17\n\ni was paying attention to the forest and\n\n43:19\n\ni knew i was in the right place\n\n43:22\n\nyou see i take the decision to bring\n\n43:25\n\nlife into the world\n\n43:27\n\nand the decision to take life from the\n\n43:29\n\nworld pretty seriously\n\n43:31\n\ni had done a lot to prepare for this\n\n43:33\n\nhunt\n\n43:34\n\nsighted in my gun nearly perfectly at\n\n43:36\n\n100 yards\n\n43:37\n\nsourced local non-lead ammo i had on\n\n43:41\n\ncamo\n\n43:41\n\nhunter orange a backpack a finely\n\n43:44\n\nsharpened\n\n43:46\n\nfield dressing kit proper nutrition\n\n43:49\n\nand as i sat there thinking about all\n\n43:52\n\nthis i realized that the forest was\n\n43:54\n\nquiet\n\n43:55\n\nthe squirrels were no longer chattering\n\n43:57\n\nin the background giving up my position\n\n43:59\n\nin the forest\n\n44:00\n\ni could hear the wings of the raven\n\n44:05\n\noverhead before i even saw it reminding\n\n44:08\n\nme of the sound of breath\n\n44:10\n\nwhile giving birth\n\n44:15\n\nand then the deer appeared like they\n\n44:18\n\nsometimes do\n\n44:19\n\na young spike buck ran out into the\n\n44:22\n\nfield a scout\n\n44:24\n\na couple fawns and does after that\n\n44:28\n\na larger buck and larger does i knew\n\n44:31\n\nthat this was not one of the trophies\n\n44:33\n\nbut this hunt was not about antlers it\n\n44:36\n\nwas about meat\n\n44:37\n\nso i sight i leaned into my gun and put\n\n44:40\n\nthe scope\n\n44:41\n\non one of the does just behind her front\n\n44:44\n\nleg where i knew the heart would be\n\n44:47\n\nand i calmed myself down so that it\n\n44:49\n\nwasn’t shaking before i took my shot\n\n44:55\n\nthose deep breaths before the final push\n\n44:58\n\nthat brings life into the world and the\n\n45:01\n\npull\n\n45:02\n\nthat takes it i shot that doe\n\n45:05\n\non opening day and it was a great shot\n\n45:08\n\non all accounts\n\n45:09\n\ni would find out later that i had shot\n\n45:11\n\nit through the heart\n\n45:13\n\nit jumped back a few yards and fell down\n\n45:15\n\nat the edge of the forest\n\n45:16\n\nthe rest of the herd scattered i took my\n\n45:19\n\ntime\n\n45:20\n\ncalming down for a moment in that sandy\n\n45:21\n\nbank then i texted spencer and taylor\n\n45:24\n\nand the landowner to let them know what\n\n45:25\n\nwas going on\n\n45:27\n\nand i approached the animal she had died\n\n45:29\n\nalmost immediately\n\n45:31\n\ni slipped some grass into her mouth and\n\n45:33\n\nput my hand on her neck to thank her\n\n45:34\n\nfor her sacrifice for my family and got\n\n45:37\n\nto work\n\n45:38\n\nlaying out my plastic bag for the heart\n\n45:40\n\nto take home to eb\n\n45:42\n\nmy field dressing kit no headlamp\n\n45:46\n\nit was supposed to be a morning hunt and\n\n45:48\n\ni’d forgotten my headlamp\n\n45:50\n\nand in my sleep deprived state no gloves\n\n45:54\n\ni had tons of baby wipes but no gloves\n\n45:58\n\nso i grabbed my knife with my bare hands\n\n46:01\n\nand started the incision down the\n\n46:03\n\nbreastbone and through\n\n46:04\n\nthe abdomen of the deer when i came to a\n\n46:06\n\nswollen\n\n46:08\n\nset of teats and i had to keep going\n\n46:12\n\ni sliced through and the milk spilled\n\n46:14\n\ninto the incision\n\n46:15\n\non my hands and my own milk spilled out\n\n46:18\n\nof my breasts and into my camo\n\n46:21\n\ntaylor came up and she quickly talked me\n\n46:24\n\ndown\n\n46:25\n\noff of what was about to be a bad\n\n46:27\n\nadrenaline trip\n\n46:28\n\nshe starts she steadied the dough\n\n46:32\n\nand she studied me she told me i had to\n\n46:35\n\nget to work\n\n46:35\n\nit was getting dark quickly we had no\n\n46:38\n\nlight and we were getting cold\n\n46:40\n\ni hastily and sloppily finished field\n\n46:42\n\ndressing the dough\n\n46:44\n\ni put the heart in a bag to bring home\n\n46:48\n\nwhile taylor found a stick to spread the\n\n46:50\n\nribs apart\n\n46:51\n\nto help it cool off more quickly i\n\n46:53\n\ncleaned up my hands and packed my bag\n\n46:56\n\nwe drugged the animal tired in the dark\n\n46:59\n\nwith no light\n\n46:59\n\nstumbling around in the field back to\n\n47:01\n\nthe truck convincing ourselves that\n\n47:03\n\nanother doe would nurse that fawn\n\n47:05\n\ntonight\n\n47:06\n\nand threw it in the back of the truck\n\n47:08\n\nsaying goodbye and thanks\n\n47:10\n\nto the farmer on our way out i dropped\n\n47:13\n\ntaylor at her mom’s about halfway home\n\n47:15\n\nwhere we ran into some other friends\n\n47:16\n\nwho’d been fishing that day\n\n47:18\n\nwe swapped stories of success there were\n\n47:20\n\nhigh fives and cheers but i was pretty\n\n47:22\n\nsad they all tried to convince me again\n\n47:25\n\nthat the fawn would be okay i got home\n\n47:28\n\nto a relatively quiet house\n\n47:31\n\nwilliam was eager to nurse and we\n\n47:34\n\ndrifted off into fit full sleep\n\n47:36\n\nthe next morning eb bounded outside in\n\n47:39\n\nher pajamas and jumped right up into the\n\n47:41\n\nback of the truck with the dough\n\n47:43\n\nshe was so excited to check it out did\n\n47:45\n\nyou bring me the heart mama\n\n47:47\n\ni did we cut the back strap out of the\n\n47:50\n\nback of the dough to have later for\n\n47:51\n\ndinner and went inside\n\n47:53\n\nwhere she played with it in the sink\n\n47:54\n\nsqueezing water in and out of the\n\n47:56\n\ndifferent valves and putting her finger\n\n47:58\n\nthrough the bullet hole\n\n47:59\n\nthat afternoon i took the dough and\n\n48:02\n\nwilliam to the butcher\n\n48:03\n\nsome years i have the bandwidth to do my\n\n48:06\n\nown butchering but this was not one of\n\n48:07\n\nthose years\n\n48:09\n\nthe butcher was so excited to see me in\n\n48:12\n\nfact he was about to do an interview\n\n48:13\n\nwith the local news station about the\n\n48:15\n\nsuccess of his female hunters on opening\n\n48:17\n\nday\n\n48:18\n\nas he told me his words not mine they\n\n48:21\n\nhunt with more finesse\n\n48:22\n\nand less ego he asked

his apron and a hollow wrinkled\n\n48:37\n\nface\n\n48:38\n\nand i told them about the fawn and the\n\n48:40\n\ndough and william and the milk and\n\n48:42\n\ni started to tear up and the hunchback\n\n48:45\n\nleaned over and he put his\n\n48:47\n\nhand on my shoulder and he said it’s\n\n48:50\n\nokay mama\n\n48:51\n\nyou’ve done nothing wrong you’ve\n\n48:53\n\nharvested a
