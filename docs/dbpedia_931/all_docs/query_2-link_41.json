        "text": "HARRIET DART broke down in tears after squandering a break lead in the deciding set of her Battle of Britain clash with Katie Boulter at Wimbledon... but amazingly still managed to win.\n\nThe Londoner, 27, had led 4-2 in the crucial third set, but saw herself fall 5-4 behind after dropping her serve.\n\nDuring the following change of ends, Dart buried her head in her towel and sobbed.\n\nTo her immense credit, she then regrouped to get up and hold serve to stay in the contest, levelling at 5-5.\n\nBoulter, 27, had taken the first 6-4, after both players struggled to find their best form.\n\nBetween them they hit 10 double faults during the opening set, with seven coming off the racquet of Dart.\n\nThe Londoner regrouped brilliantly in the second set, taking it 6-1 to force a decider.\n\nShe continued to be the better player during the first half of the third set, racing into a 4-2 lead, even having a break point to go 5-2 in front.\n\nAt this point her level dropped, with Boulter winning three consecutive games to go 5-4 in front.\n\nDuring the following changeover, Dart sobbed - but she managed to find her form again impressively.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\nBoth players then exchanged holds, with Dart holding her nerve to take it to a match tiebreak to 10.\n\nMore tears flowed as she went 6-2 down in the breaker.\n\nBut incredibly she managed to come back again, taking the tiebreak 10-8.\n\nFollowing her defeat, Boulter looked in disbelief, but did give Dart a cordial hug at the net - despite their rivalry.\n\nThe Leicester-born star hit an astonishing 75 unforced errors during the match, a statistic that ultimately went on to be her downfall.\n\nDart will play Wang Xinyu in the third round, after the Chinese star upset fifth seed Jessica Pegula.\n\nThe former quarter-finalist was beaten 6-4 6-7 6-1 over on No2 Court."
