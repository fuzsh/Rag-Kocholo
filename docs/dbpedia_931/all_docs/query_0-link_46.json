CONSITT BOULTER, M.A., F.S.A.\n\nJoseph Hunter, a name to be honoured by all Yorkshire topographers, once wrote as follows:—“The second layer of the population … the country families, who down to about 1670 had no higher designation than yeoman, are what a genealogist attending to any part of South Yorkshire should chiefly look to, and there will be something to reward his exertions.” [note 1] Some interest of this kind attaches to the manuscript volume from which the following extracts have been drawn. The writer of it, William Storr, of Scalm-park in the parish of Wistow, was one of a family long settled in Pickering-lythe, being found there early in the 16th century. [note 2] The chief interest, however, of the volume is not in his family (of which he has given a full account), but in the picture which it presents us of the ways and doings of a successful Yorkshire farmer 200 years ago. His father, perhaps because the old home had become too strait for a large family, moved southward, and took a lease of Scalm-park in 1678, where he died in 1695. Partly perhaps through his father’s diligence, but more no doubt by his own good management, the son was able in 1717 to buy the lease of the farm of 300 acres, of which his father had become the tenant only 39 years before.\n\nEvidence of that determination which is necessary to success is not wanting. We see, for instance, how Mr. Storr made the best of his poor corn in a bad harvest, how he rebuilt in brick the old farm-buildings of wood, how he planted trees {45} and set new fences, and, above all, how he built Scalm-house itself. Moreover, we see his force of character in the bold manner in which he several times pulled down an attempted obstruction of an old right of way. We find him copying records of old uses and rights, and carefully taking down from the mouths of antient men an account of old ways and boundaries, remembering how it is written, “Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.” [note 3] We get other glimpses of the man: e.g., the schooling of his sons; the books he read, probably on winter evenings, with an occasional newspaper from London; his knowledge of astronomy, which led him to observe an eclipse; his simple pharmacopœia; and the Yorkshire fairs which he attended. [note 4]\n\nThree other points remain; 1, there are a few scraps for the history and topography of the parish of Wistow; 2, an account of the customs of the manor from 1578 to 1711; 3, some Yorkshire customs, words, phrases and pronunciations, &c. With few exceptions I have not noticed the additions in later hands.\n\nThe volume is of paper, folio; the greater part blank. The covers are endorsed as follows: 1, “Willi Storr Book of Remarkes . … Brief Remembrance of sevrall small things known or Redd and noted for A Memorandm.” 2, “Will Storr Booke of the Customs Services and duties due to the lord Arch Bishop of yorke his grace from his Tenants Coppyholders of Wistow.” [note 5]\n\n(P. 23.)

Of Scalme.—Robert Storr my father Came to Scalme at ladyday 1678 & was joynt tenant with Robert Poole for 5 years & then Renewed the lease to himself in 1683 & After his death I Renewed the lease in 1700 & now I have Renewed the lease in 1712 & bought it in 1716|7.\n\nThe computation of Acres in the same is as follows: [note 13]—\n\nKeeper close, little lawnd, great lawnd, great horse close, far horse close, ote close, Raven Spurn, [note 14] new close, eller close, Ramper close, little West end, great West end, hopgarth, middow birk spring, summer birk spring, sheep field, hill close, great calf close, the 3 Acre Close is sharp {48} 3 a.; head lands, hedge lands & carr [reckoned with nearly every close]; in all 293 a. soe that with the garthes About the house Scalme contains near 300 Acres.\n\nOf building.—My father builded the Waggon house out of an old decade one & I built it again of brick & all the fould walls in 1714. I builded the barn att dam side out of An old decade one. I builded the garnars all new at my own Charge in 1700 Cost 40l. I likewise builded Scalme house at my own Charge in 1712 Cost — besides all leeding of timber, & Coles to burn bricks, & lime, & sand and bricks to the house from the kilne, worth 30l. I builded the dovecoat in 171– the waggan house & fould walls was built in 1714, & new stable in 1715.\n\nOf Quicksett.—My father sett all the Apple trees in litle orchard & I grafted the young ones in the great orchard my self, that is those at new house end. I sett the fence that the lane of both launds is seperated by in 1690. I sett the fence that Cuts keepers Close of, & I sett the fence that Cutts the Carr from the west end, & likewise the fence that Cutts the 18 Acre in two, & from the Carrs, & I seperated all the Cans from the hard land where they are taken off, & that fence that parts the 30 A. end was sett by me About 1699.

[1820, now let to 2 tenants, yearly rent £450.]\n\n(P. 83.) Of high wayes.—Memorandum when my father Came to Scalme the Road way to Cawood & Wistow was thorow the woods & out at a gate at the garth side of new hagg for Cawood & to Wistow out at a gate near the farr end of mosker hagg & so was for 20 years after but the woods growing so great we was forst to take down mosker hagg being the way to Selby, but in stead of the two wayes to Cawood & Wistow & saveing Mr. Haworth the setting us gates he gave me Will. Storr leave to have a way over the woods to Bishop dike side, so that if the tennant of new hagg should stop that way they may be obliged to sett two gates one to Cawood & another to Wistow when they take these woods in.\n\nThe way to hallings when I first did know them was (from Wistow to them) over the Common Ings & over brounill hurn & so over the leaven {49} acres & so Continued until Bishop Sharp [note 15] bought the Estate of Mr. Milner [note 16] & old Mr. Suger being steward to the lord bishop & so then became Steward for that Estate & Thomas Hothen liveing at halling house & haveing his way throw the leaven acres did William nalor sume damidge by neglects so nalor made Complaint to mr. Suger so mr. Suger Caused nalor to fence up the gatestead at halling garth side upon which I going to the halings from Wistow & finding it fenced I puld it down & soe did more times but mr. Suger forbad me & I being tennant was forst to desist but the true way to the halling house is over the leaven acres & had been time out of mind as I understud but if ever there be two stewards that is one for the lord Bishop & another for Mr. Sharp it may be Covered again, test. Will. Storr.\n\nThe foot way from Scalme park to Selby is on Scalme Closes & so over into the 2 springs at mosker hagg nook & out at a great oak tree [note 17] in the fence betwixt thorp lane end & the wood nouk but we have no horss way on the Closses but by leeve.\n\n(P. 38.) Of the woods.—The number of Acres Contained in the woods is as followes:—\n\nIn palding Hagg, [note 18] that is that part that lyes betwixt hammer sike [note 19] & the burns, & betwixt new hagg & mosker hagg, Contains in Acres 180. In West hill hagg, that is that part that lyes betwixt hammer sike and the dam next to Scalme park Contains in Acres 236 soe that these haggs Contains in all 416.\n\nIn pile hagg, that is that part that lyes betwixt the dam & A bank which goes from Rist park [note 20] to the pingle nuek Contains 220 Acres.\n\nIn hornington hagg, that is that part that lyes betwixt the Aforesd bank & new hagg, & bishop dike, & soe to the Common Contains 260 Acres soe these 2 haggs Contains in all 480 Acres, so that Rist park side, is larger then Scalme side haggs by 64 Acres.\n\nIn the new hagg is contained 80 Acres.\n\nThe Custam of these haggs is, that the tennant at new hagg hath the new hagg Alwayes in, but the other 4 haggs he keeps but 2 haggs in at A time & Changes Every seaven year, & when his seaven year is out he must fence in the other 2 haggs in from the Common for the next 7 {50} year: he tooke in the 2 haggs next Scalme at Candlemes 1710|11 & soe they will Continue untill 1717|18.\n\nThere is a bank Caled pale [note 21] bank which goes from mosker hagg nouke at Scalme, to larderlands nouke, Right over the haggs through barly Close which should once have devided the lower part of the woods from the Rest & have been alwayes in, but the warr [note 22] destroyed it, soe that the bank can hardly be seen.\n\nThis Account was taken out of An Abstract taken by george Hewley, [note 23] gent. & Willm. Strelly gent. And Edward Basse Esqr. About the year 1642 and Coppyed by Will. Storr in 1704.\n\nOf Bishop dike.—There is a Custam likewise that when Hornington hagg side is up that the tennant may take water out of bishop dike at a goat stock [note 24] near lader lands when they want water but the time of so doing must be betwixt sunn sett on setterday, to sunn Rise on monday & at no other time & this I was Informed off about the year 1679 by Mr. Needham then of new hagg & one John Chaddock an old man of Cawood who had been servant at the said hagg many years, & I beleeve the same Custome is at other Stocks for taking water out of Bishop dike.\n\n(P. 31.) Of Corn.—In the year 1698 I sould mean wheat at 1. 2. 6 A load, but good wheat was sould from that prize to 30 shillings in seed time. I had a parcill of wheat soe small that it would not sell in the markett soe that I put litles on it Amongst my bread Corn & soe got it sould, but at the last I had 7 load of it left, soe I went to Selby and bought 3 load of Rye & mixed it with that small wheat and then went with it to Wetherby market & there sould it to mary banks a baker for 21 shillings A load. That year likewise Corn grew green out of the ear as it stud streight upon An end, and likewise I did nott Cut any wintercorn that year untill the monday next before mickallmas day, & I had corn Comd green up for it had been sowne 2 weeks before. I sould ots that year for 1. 2. 6. A qtor to george smith, & I sould mary Child & John Jackson ots at the same prize in 1709 and all Corn was dear Accordingly & Continued at good prizes sume time after.\n\n(P. 32.) Of Rapes.—In 1685 my father did thresh Rape upon the 24th of August And in 1709 I sould to mr. Bever Rapeseed at 24 pound A last. {51}\n\nThe Best time to sow Rape is 2 weeks before lammas, & as long After, or if the ground be very good, later may doe. If Rapes be over prood [note 25] mow them, but then it must be done before they stalk, for if they be Cut below the Rose, it kills them.\n\n(P. 31.) Of Snow.—In the year 1698 did fall A snow upon the 21st day of Aprill being Aberforth fare day, and Another upon St. Hellin day [note 26] being the 3d of may the same year, and at night was A hard frost which did freze in sume houses, (which cold time made Corn dear).\n\nOf floods.—There hath been severall great floods but one is Remarkable because it hapened in sumner. It began to Rain the 13th of July and Continued till Wedinsday at noun & the flood was at height at Wistow on Setterday at noun. It swam load pikes [note 27] of hay in the hallings, and I lost there & in the Common Ings 50 load of hay, and the wether was so hott After it, that dust flew in the Roads very sore, & it did Rott the gras upon the ground with the heat of the sun, soe that it was A very lothsome smell to feell all over the lordship, & there was Abundance of hay & Corn lost in the lordship, and the ground would not keep Above half the stock the next year I mean on low grounds, & because the gras was soe Rotted Away it Caused Abundance of the Ings to be plowed which never was before. I lost with that flood near upon 100l. It was in the year 1706 that the sumer flood hapned at Wistow.\n\n(P. 62.) Of drought.—In the year 1714 was A very great drought and Scarsity of hay and beans but wheat and Rye was great Crops: hay was sould att 4 pence p stone att Wistow and Cawood but att leeds and that way for 6 pence or 8 pence and beans was in seed time above the price of wheat being above 10s. A load: the winter before the dry summer and the winter After was both soe dry that we had no accation to grip [note D] our plowing land nor was it soe much wett to make it Runn thrugh the watering place in the Bull fould, and in the latter winter was the great wind which blew down A great part of the windmills, it was the first of febuary 1714.\n\n(P. 61.) Of wind.—In the year 1714|5 upon the first day of febuary was the greatest wind that had been seen in any mans time: it was at highest betwixt 12 and 3 of the Clock, it blew downe about half of the windmills in the Cuntrey, and there was blown down A great number of barns, there was 8 blown down in Wistow & near 20 houses & barns at Selby; there was severall blown which was but buelded the sumer or 2 summers before; it did not leave one hay stack standing and at that time hay was very scarce for it followed A very dry summer; it tooke water out of Rivers and Carried it in the Ayre A very great way. I was Informed of A very Creedable man his name was John fforrist one that {52} sould fushtons, [note 28] at lived in lonkesb— [note B] within 10 myles of the sea that severall of his neighbors did Affirm that the sea water was brought to them and fell like Rain but was salt; it did not Reach within 50 myles of london nor farr north, it drove trees up by the Roots in great numbers.\n\n(P. 77.) Of Eclips.—This Eclips of the moon was as large as well can be, it fell on the 29th of August 1718, it began a litle before she did Rise, and about sunsett, which was Before 6 of the Clock [note E], she was near half an hour high when first discovered, and had lost Above half of her light, and she Continued near two hours totall Eclipsed, and she was one hour in gathering her light again, she was very Ridd while she was totall Eclipsed, and that side was Ridest which last lost her light—untill near the midle time, and after the other side was the Ridest, for about the midle time she was a duske Coller, so that it may be suposed she Receved that Ridnes from a second Cause, that is from the twilight, this was observed by me Will. Storr all the time. [note 29]\n\n(P. 24.) Before that Act [note 30] [of K. William iii.] A man’s powr only was to give Away A 3d part, if he had a Wife & Children & soe it was Called the death part, [note 31] because the dying man had power to give it Away, but if he had but A wife & noe Children then he might give Away, or if he had Children and noe wife he might Also give half Away, these Custams was Caled the Custam of the province of yorke.\n\n(P. 27.) If a man die Intestate & leave both Wife & Children & the Children have all been provided for in the father’s life time (by the father) then shall the Wife have half of the whole (Clear goods) & a third part of the Remainder, & the Rest to all the Children alike, so the Widdow will have four out of six lett the sume be what it will—the first division is by the Custom of the provence of yorke & the last part Cald the death part by the Statude of distribuetions.\n\n(P. 27.) Thos. Jobeson [?] at selby had 4 sisters & married Mary Sugden who had 3 brothers & one sister the said Thos & Mary had A Child & then both died Thomas Sugden the Child’s mothers brother took tuetion of the Child & soe had the goods & Chattles but the Child died & all the uncles & aunts both of the fathers and mothers side came in for shares which were alive but the Children of such uncles & aunts that was dead before the Child had no share. {53}\n\n(P. 35.)
