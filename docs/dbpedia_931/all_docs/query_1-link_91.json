        "text": "Cameron Norrie, Naomi Broady and Katie Boulter are one victory away from qualifying for the US Open.\n\nThe British trio all posted impressive wins in New York on Thursday, with Norrie and Boulter on the brink of making their debuts in the fourth and final Grand Slam of the year.\n\nNorrie, who has enjoyed a strong summer season on the hard courts of North America, beat Sekou Bangoura 6-4 7-5 in just 88 minutes.\n\nThe world No 226, born in Johannesburg, will now face Go Soeda of Japan who is ranked 95 spots above the Brit.\n\nMeanwhile, in the women's singles, 21-year-old Boulter enjoyed the best victory of her career against Danka Kovinic of Montenegro.\n\nBoulter, the world No 250, edged out the No 3 seed 6-4 2-6 6-4 in a tight encounter.\n\nThe only break of serve in the final set came in game nine and the Leicester-born player sealed her success on her second match point.\n\nBoulter, who made her Wimbledon debut in June, will face Turkey's Ipek Soylu for a place at Flushing Meadows.\n\nThe more experienced Broady survived a two-hour and 48-minute marathon in beating Turkey's Cagla Buyukakcay 7-5 6-7 (3-7) 6-4.\n\nThe 27-year-old appeared to be on her way to a straight-sets success, as she moved a set and 4-2 ahead.\n\nBut the world No 150 battled back to force a decider which became another nail-biter.\n\nBroady raced into a 5-2 lead, but was broken in game eight, then missed a match point in the ninth, before sealing a tense triumph in the next. She now takes on American Nicole Gibbs on Friday.\n\nBrits already in the US Open's main draw are Andy Murray, Kyle Edmund, Aljaz Bedene, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson.\n\nSky Sports Tennis will have all the action from the US Open covered via our website www.skysports.com/tennis with our live blogs and updates throughout the fortnight as the Grand Slam year reaches its climax.\n\nOn the move?
