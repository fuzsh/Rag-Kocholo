He lost to Cameron Norrie of Great Britain in straight sets, before claiming the biggest win of his career against then-world No. 2, Rafael Nadal of Spain. De Minaur lost in the fourth round of the Australian Open to eventual champion Novak Djokovic, in straight sets winning only five games.[133]\n\nAt the Rotterdam Open, De Minaur recorded his third top-5 win, defeating Andrey Rublev in his opening match. He made it to the quarterfinals before losing to Grigor Dimitrov, after having match points.[134]\n\nIn March, De Minaur won his seventh overall and first ATP 500 title at the Mexican Open, defeating Tommy Paul.[135] As a result, he returned to the top 20 in the rankings on 6 March 2023.[136]\n\nFollowing this run, at the 2023 BNP Paribas Open he lost in the second round in less than an hour and a half to Marton Fucsovics having received a bye in the first round.[137] At the 2023 Miami Open he also lost in the second round to Quentin Halys in a three hours and 20 minutes match with three tiebreaks.[138]\n\nOn grass, De Minaur reached a final at the Queen's Club Championships, losing to world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz.[139] He lost at Wimbledon in the second round to the unseeded Matteo Berrettini.\n\nAt the 2023 Los Cabos Open, he made it to the final, where he lost to top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas.

De Minaur lost in the final to Jannik Sinner in straight sets.[140] De Minaur's successful Canadian Open campaign was followed by a fourth round appearance at the US Open, where he was defeated by third seed Daniil Medvedev. Afterwards, De Minaur participated in the China Open, where he defeated Andy Murray in three sets after saving 3 match points in a lengthy 3-hour match, however, lost again to Medvedev in the following round. Consequently, he rose to a career-high singles ranking of world No. 11.\n\nDuring the indoor hardcourt swing, De Minaur defeated Andy Murray again at the Paris Masters in three sets in his first round, after saving a match point, becoming the first person ever to beat Andy Murray in their first 6 attempts and the first person to beat Andy Murray on clay, grass and indoor and outdoor hard court.[141] In his next match, he defeated Dušan Lajović in 3 sets for his 200th career win.[142] De Minaur received a walkover from Jannik Sinner in the round of 16, sending him into his second Masters 1000 quarterfinal of his career (both appearances came this year). He lost in 3 sets to Andrey Rublev.[143]\n\n2024: Top 10 debut, win over world No. 1, consecutive title in Acapulco, Roland Garros and Wimbledon quarterfinals\n\n[edit]\n\nDe Minaur started his year at the 2024 United Cup, where he lost to world No. 18, Cameron Norrie of Great Britain. He won against world No. 10, Taylor Fritz, in his first match of the year, to help Team Australia advance to the quarterfinals of the round-robin tournament, after they edged out the USA and Great Britain in game-winning percentage.[144] In the quarterfinals, he upset Novak Djokovic 6–4, 6–4 on Australia's way to a 3–0 victory, his first win over a world No. 1, and handed Djokovic his first loss in Australia since Hyeon Chung beat him at the 2018 Australian Open.[145] In the semifinals, he came from a set down to notch his third consecutive top-10 victory of the tournament, after beating world No. 7 Alexander Zverev. However, Australia failed to progress to the finals, following a 1–2 defeat to eventual champions Germany.[146] As a result, he became the first Australian to enter the world's top 10 since Lleyton Hewitt in 2006, and held the position for two weeks till 29 January 2024, marking the end of the 2024 Australian Open, where he reached the fourth round.[147][148]\n\nIn February, De Minaur competed at the 2024 ABN AMRO Open, where he was seeded fifth. He reached the final after upsetting second seed and world No. 5, Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinals and then defeating Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals.[149] In the finals, he lost to Jannik Sinner in straight sets, and thus, rose to a new career high ranking of world No. 9.[150][151]\n\nAt the 2024 Abierto Mexicano Telcel, de Minaur successfully defended his Acapulco title, defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals for the first time and defeating Casper Ruud in the final in straight sets. By doing this, de Minaur became the first player to defend a title in Acapulco since David Ferrer in 2012. At his following 2 tournaments, Indian Wells and Miami, he reached the 4th round, before losing to Alexander Zverev and Fábián Marozsán, respectively.\n\nDe Minaur began his clay season in Monte Carlo, where he defeated Stan Wawrinka, Tallon Griekspoor and Alexei Popyrin to reach his first Masters quarterfinal on clay. He lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets. After receiving a bye, he then defeated Rafael Nadal at Barcelona, before losing to Arthur Fils in the third round. In Madrid, de Minaur again faced Nadal, but lost to him in straight sets. He fared better in Rome, where he reached the fourth round before losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\nAt the French Open, de Minaur was seeded 11th. He beat Alex Michelsen and Jaume Munar to make his best result at the tournament and reach the third round. There, he beat Jan-Lennard Struff in 4 sets to go a round further. In the fourth round, de Minaur beat Daniil Medvedev in four sets to become the first Australian man to reach the quarterfinals of the French Open since Lleyton Hewitt in 2004.[152] He lost to Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals.[153] This run also resulted in his return to the top 10.\n\nAt the Rosmalen Open, De Minaur won his ninth ATP Tour singles title against Sebastian Korda in straight sets to start off the grass court season, becoming the first Australian to win the championship match since 2001. On the way to the title, he did not lose a set and also reached a career high of World No. 7 in the rankings on 17 June 2024.[154][155]\n\nAt Wimbledon, De Minaur made his first Wimbledon quarterfinals beating James Duckworth,[156] Jaume Munar,[157] Lucas Pouille (via walkover)[158] and Arthur Fils.[159][160] By getting to the fourth round, De Minaur became the first Australian in 19 years to reach four consecutive major fourth rounds, but withdrew before the quarterfinals due to a hip injury.[161][162]\n\nPlaying style\n\n[edit]\n\nDe Minaur is famous for his speed and agility on court, which have earned him the jocular title \"Speed Demon\" on the tour.[163]\n\nHe is known for his ability to retrieve seemingly impossible balls and hit winners from defensive positions or force opponents into making mistakes. His footwork and court coverage are considered some of the best on tour, though some have questioned the physical toll it could take on his body in the long-term. Despite this, his fighting spirit, \"never say die\" attitude and intensity on the court have earned him a huge fan base for a young player.[164]\n\nHis baseline game suits that of a counterpuncher, often retrieving balls and slowly constructing points. However, he is also known to inject sudden pace into rallies to surprise opponents, and often opts for a one-two combination on his serve, using the serve and a powerful groundstroke to end points quickly. His forehand is significantly better than his backhand on the offensive, and he often uses it to construct points or hit winners when attacking.[165]\n\nDe Minaur's serve is considered his main weakness in his game, with both his first and second serve being considerably weaker than his counterparts in terms of power and a relatively high double fault count, in which it's considered the main attacking point for opponents. His volleys were initially a weakness too, but have improved, moving towards a more transitional offensive game.[166]\n\nCritics point out that despite his defensive capabilities, de Minaur does not possess any real weapons to use against top opponents. Some have argued his defensive game is unsustainable physically in the long-term and is not sufficient to challenge better players, as he tends to play himself out of aggressive positions.[167]\n\nNational representation\n\n[edit]\n\nATP Cup\n\n[edit]\n\nDe Minaur made his ATP Cup debut for Australia in January 2020. He scored a victory against then world No.7 Alexander Zverev; which helped Australia claim a 3–0 victory over Germany.[168]\n\nIn 2022, he beat world No. 7 Matteo Berrettini (6–3, 7–6).\n\nDavis Cup\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early February 2018, De Minaur made his Davis Cup debut for Australia at 18 years of age, against then world No.5 Alexander Zverev from Germany in the opening rubber. He fell just short of a spectacular upset, losing in a fifth-set tiebreaker after at one point leading 3–0, (40–Ad.) in the decider.[169]\n\nOlympics\n\n[edit]\n\nDe Minaur was selected to represent Australia at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics (to be held in July 2021), but was forced to withdraw after testing positive for Covid-19.[170]\n\nUnited Cup\n\n[edit]\n\nDe Minaur made his United Cup debut for Australia in December 2022. He scored a victory against the world No. 2 Rafael Nadal, his biggest career win thus far. It was his eight top-10 career win and only his second in the top-5.[171] Despite this win Australia did not advance out of the group into the knockout stage. In 2024, de Minaur and team Australia were much more successful, advancing to the semifinals, helped by de Minaur winning against 3 top 10 players, including world no. 1 Novak Djokovic.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nSince March 2020, de Minaur has been in a relationship with British tennis player Katie Boulter.[172]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nGrand Slam tournament performance timelines\n\n[edit]\n\nKey W F SF QF #R RR Q# P# DNQ A Z# PO G S B NMS NTI P NH\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (P#) preliminary round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (Z#) Davis/Fed Cup Zonal Group (with number indication) or (PO) play-off; (G) gold, (S) silver or (B) bronze Olympic/Paralympic medal; (NMS) not a Masters tournament; (NTI) not a Tier I tournament; (P) postponed; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\n\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\nCurrent through the 2024 Wimbledon Championships.\n\nTournament 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 SR W–L Grand Slam tournaments Australian Open Q1 2R 1R 3R A 3R 4R 4R 4R 0 / 7 14–7 French Open A 1R 1R 2R 1R 2R 1R 2R QF 0 / 8 7–8 Wimbledon A Q2 3R 2R NH 1R 4R 2R QF 0 / 6 10–5 US Open A 1R 3R 4R QF 1R 3R 4R 0 / 7 14–7 Win–loss 0–0 1–3 4–4 7–4 4–2 3–4 8–4 8–4 10–2 0 / 28 45–27\n\nMasters 1000 tournament finals\n\n[edit]\n\nSingles: 1 (1 runner-up)\n\n[edit]\n\nOutcome Year Tournament Surface Opponent Score Loss 2023 Canadian Open Hard Jannik Sinner 4–6, 1–6\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nAlex de Minaur at the Association of Tennis Professionals\n\nAlex de Minaur at the International Tennis Federation\n\nAlex de Minaur at the Davis Cup\n\nAlex de Minaur at Tennis Australia"
