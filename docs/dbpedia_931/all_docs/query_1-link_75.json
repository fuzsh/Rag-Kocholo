        "text": "Lovely drop shot by Kopriva to save a break point as Djokovic threatened to break. That is the type of point which will test Djokovic’s knee and willingness to chase things down.\n\nDjokovic gets a second look at a break when he rifles a forehand winner down the line. But it is saved again by Kopriva with a backhand winner of his own.\n\nVintage Djokovic as he slides open stance to his left and places a backhand winner beautifully down the line. Kopriva did nothing wrong and is still facing a break point. However, once again the opportunity is squandered by Djokovic.\n\nDesperate defensive backhand by Kopriva is long, fourth break chance for Djokovic. Djokovic runs gingerly to his right and slices a forehand long.\n\nFifth break point of the game for Djokovic arrives after a Kopriva error. Deuce once more after Djokovic’s forehand floats long. Gorgeous drop shot by Djokovic is a winner, sixth time lucky?\n\nYes he is. Kopriva slices a backhand into the net and drops serve. Djokovic’s effort are finally rewarded.\n\nBy Max Stephens\n\nBill Johnston, 65, a lecturer at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, who had planned to buy resale tickets for Andy Murray with his daughter Zoe at Wimbledon, said:\n\nWe have talked about this, we thought today might be really historic because we want to pay homage to maybe one of Britain’s greatest sportsmen. We have enjoyed his talents over the years, but hey he is looking after himself and hopefully we will get to see him in the doubles.\n\nWe got Court No 1 tickets but we had just joined the resale queue, so we had hoped, we had a plan, a strategy to see Andy but that’s not to be unfortunately, but we wish him well. We would like to see him in the doubles, just wish him all the best. I queued for five hours yesterday and I eventually made it into the courts at 4pm so this is my second day.\n\nWhat are the words, It is just to pay respect to our greatest sportsman and recognise his amazing achievements, three Grand Slams that people would give a lot of money for, so well done Andy and if he signs out then good luck in the future. There is something about Andy’s legacy for anybody who is aspiring to be great in their sport or any area of work. I think he’s driven and I think he’s an inspiration.\n\nHis daughter Zoe Johnston, 28, an accountant and Lawn Tennis Association member, said she fully supported proposals to commemorate Murray’s legacy with a permanent statue at Wimbledon.\n\nMy sister is at work but she will be queueing every evening to see Andy and Jamie. She’s probably his [Andy’s] biggest fan.\n\nAndy Murray remains unable to use his right leg as he would like. When performing sprints at Aorangi Park – the training courts adjacent to Wimbledon – on Sunday, he was clearly unbalanced, with one leg working far better than the other.\n\nAs a result, he was unable to keep up with his coach – the former doubles player Jonny O’Mara – when they raced each other over short distances. This was a long way from the man who, according to his former fitness trainer Jez Green, used to be quicker than Usain Bolt over the first few steps.\n\nFor more on Murray’s withdrawal, click here\n\nIt’s something I wasn’t hoping to hear. I saw him practising a couple of days ago and he was moving OK. I though: ‘There’s a chance here’. I know he’d want to do it, but its; devastating news because it’s not the way he would have wanted to go out. He’d have loved to have given the British fans another look at him. For him to have played on Centre another time would have been special. Maybe he’ll do it in the doubles, but it’s very sad news for such a great, great player.\n\nAbsolutely, he will have tried everything possible with his team around him. We saw him practising and he looked OK but wasn’t really pushing himself to the limits. For Andy Murray, he’s not going to go out on court unless he thinks he can win the match. He obviously felt this was one step too far, so he decided to call it a day.\n\nHopefully [the doubles] will happen. It would be terrible if he didn’t play at all. Hopefully he’ll go out there and play even if he’s completely strapped up. And try to give it a go if at all possible.\n\nOh boy. When you think of the era that he was in, with [Rafael] Nadal, [Novak] Djokovic], [Roger] Federer, for him to have won three Slams, Olympic gold, Davis Cup… I remember just the courage, the fire, the will to will he’s had. You can’t teach that. We’re going to miss him. He’s the greatest athlete, in my opinion, in British sport, ever. I can’t believe it.”\n\nA statue for Murray on the grounds of Wimbledon is all but certain - and plans are in place for other tributes to the two-time champion.\n\nSally Bolton, the AELTC CEO, suggests plans remain flexible but the club is keen to “work with” Murray, who ended a 77-year wait for a men’s champion in 2013.\n\nThere is already a full-length statue of Fred Perry as well as a bronze bust of Virginia Wade on the grounds. Dorothy Round, Angela Mortimer, Ann Jones and Kitty Godfree, who won the first of her two Wimbledon titles 100 years ago, are also recognised.\n\nMurray confirmed last week that he is planning for Wimbledon and the Olympics to be the final events of his career. His appearances in the men’s doubles and singles this week remained subject to him passing a late fitness test on a back injury on Monday night. Bolton, however, says “we’ll be ready” to celebrate the 37-year-old’s career, and a statue somewhere in the grounds appears all-but-certain.\n\nWhen asked whether a space was being saved for a Murray statue next to Perry’s statue outside Centre Court, Bolton said “you could argue that’s a bit of an obvious location”.\n\n“I think as we reflect on the shape of these grounds, and we think about potential development over the road,” she said. The All England Club’s is pressing ahead with proposals to build 39 new tennis courts, including an 8,000-seater show court, on an adjoining former golf course it has acquired.\n\n“We’ve got time to think about where any kind of physical celebration of Andy’s career might be,” Bolton added. “And, in any event, we would want to work with Andy on that. He really, understandably, is not ready to have those conversations just yet. So we will make sure we get this right, because this is for all time. You think about Fred Perry. That will be for an all-time statue. And so we want to make sure it’s right. We can take our time to do that.”\n\nBolton said: “We have got a variety of plans sitting waiting to deliver” when Murray does finally announce he is quitting. “We’ll be ready whenever that happens,” she added.\n\nLiam Broady and John McEnroe have backed calls for a statue for Murray in recent weeks.\n\nGood morning and welcome to coverage of day two at Wimbledon.\n\nAll eyes are on whether Andy Murray will decide to play singles this year. He is due last on Centre Court against Tomas Machac of the Czech Republic.\n\nMurray practised against fellow Brit Kyle Edmund on Monday afternoon. While his movement was limited, he was able to win the practice set they played.\n\nTelegraph Sport was told on Monday by one insider: “I think he might start the singles just to have one last match on Centre. Yes, he could get that from playing the doubles, but it’s not the same thing for a champion to share the court with so many. It all depends on whether he feels that he will get battered by Machac or can be respectable.”\n\nMachac has a 2-0 head-to-head record against Murray but insists he is not taking anything for granted.\n\n“Andy is a great fighter so I think if he steps on the court he will be 100 per cent ready to play a whole match,” said Machac. “You need to win three sets so if he is not ready he will not play. But if he is standing on the court he will go for the win.”\n\nElsewhere, Katie Boulter, Jack Draper, Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans are all in action and hoping to reach the second round.\n\nAs is tradition at Wimbledon, defending women’s champion Marketa Vondrousova opens play on Centre Court at 1.30pm against Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.\n\nShe will then be followed by Novak Djokovic, who has made a miraculous recovery from knee surgery to be ready to face Vit Kopriva.\n\n“Obviously once the tournament starts, I’ll have more I guess sensations and more feedback from how knee reacts to a best-of-five Grand Slam match,” Djokovic said. “So far everything that was done was very positive.”"
