        "text": "Emma Raducanu suffered a nasty fall in her Rothesay Open semi-final clash with fellow Brit Katie Boulter, before their match was suspended due to heavy rain in Nottingham.\n\nThe match, which Raducanu advanced into after her quarter-final opponent was too unwell to play, was postponed on several occasions as rain fell across the Midlands.\n\nPlay won't resume on Saturday and the remainder of the semi between Raducanu and Boutler will take place on Sunday, alongside the opposite semi and the final.\n\nRaducanu won the first set in a gruelling 7-6 tiebreak, with the final point before play was stopped. An overhead winner from the 2021 US Open champion saw her take the set 15-13, before going over to speak with the umpire.\n\nThe 21-year-old explained that as rain continued to fall on the grass, the court became too wet to play. The official then came to wipe their hand on the court and agreed with Raducanu, calling an end to play, as Boulter was informed that one side of the court was more slippery than the other and the umpire did not want to risk any injuries.\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest Tennis news Join us on WhatsApp\n\nOur community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Boulter led 4-1 in the tiebreak and had three set points, but was unable to put Raducanu away and upon victory, pointed to her head, likely to indicate her strong mentality during the blockbuster clash."
