Seyboth Wild reached the third round here last year so he has some Roland Garros pedigree.\n\nThe chant of the set, incidentally, was \"Allez allez Gael\" to the tune of \"Everybody dance now\".\n\nTiafoe forces fifth set against Bellucci\n\nFrances Tiafoe has bounced back to win the fourth set against Mattia Bellucci after losing the second and third. He missed several opportunities to break Bellucci but was finally able to capitalise. The 25th-seeded American will attempt to complete the comeback in the fifth set.\n\nTough Grand Slam sequence continues for Maria Sakkari\n\nVarvara Gracheva gets revenge for a defeat in Rome to the Greek world No 7, winning 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nSakkari is the first top-ten player to go out of this year's French Open, and hasn't gone beyond the third round of her last nine Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnhappy times for the Brits across the Channel\n\nIt's a quick Eurostar back from Paris to London, but the British players in the Roland Garros draw would have preferred to be booking their tickets a bit later than this.\n\nBritish No 1 Cameron Norrie is out after going the distance against 25-year-old Russian Pavel Kotov, while Harriet Dart lost in straight sets to Linda Noskova.\n\nAfter Jack Draper and Andy Murray's first-round exits yesterday, Dan Evans — who plays 13th seed Holger Rune tomorrow — and Katie Boulter — who has to get past Paula Badosa — are the only representation left in the singles draws.\n\nMonfils turning back the clock\n\nAn unbelievable point just now from the 37-year-old Gael Monfils, somehow retrieving a drop volley and flicking away a forehand pass on the run after some incredible defence. His opponent Thiago Seyboth Wild gave him a big thumbs up afterwards. Monfils goes on to secure the double break and will serve for the opening set at 5-2.\n\nConflicting emotions for me – delighted to see such a good shot, but it inevitably means more involvement for the extremely loud brass band sat just in front of me.\n\nChecking in on the American men\n\nAmerican (14) Tommy Paul has beaten Pedro Cachin in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, 6-1.\n\nHis compatriot (25) Frances Tiafoe is having a tougher time though. He finds himself trailing two sets to one against Mattia Bellucci, 6-3, 3-6, 6-7(8). They're on serve 2-2 in the fourth set.\n\nLa Monf is in the building\n\nToday's night session features French legend, jump-smash master, and entertainer Gael Monfils, who faces Brazil's Thiago Seyboth Wild.\n\nMonfils provided one of the most memorable matches of last year's tournament, when he beat Sebastian Baez on one leg and a prayer on a raucous Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nHe's back there now and has made the perfect start, breaking Seyboth Wild to lead 2-1.\n\nFormer U.S. Open champion makes a statement return\n\nBianca Andreescu beat Serena Williams in Flushing Meadows to lift the trophy in 2019.\n\nFive years later, she's returning from a stress fracture in her back that has kept her out for nine months, and she's started with a straight-sets win.\n\nThe Canadian world No 228, who has been ranked as high as 4th in the world, took out Sara Sorribes Tormo of Spain 7-5, 6-1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElina Svitolina progresses after tight match on Suzanne-Lenglen\n\nAfter a stunning run to last year's Wimbledon semi-finals, Elina Svitolina has had a steady, but unspectacular time on tour. That's hardly a surprise: her form in 2023, shortly after giving birth and as her homeland Ukraine suffered in Russia's invasion, came as a surprise to everybody, herself included.\n\nShe's hit the front at the right time against a fading Karolina Pliskova, 5-2 and 40-15 up in the final set...\n\nShe might want to get this done: her husband Gael Monfils will be on Philippe-Chatrier in around 40 minutes.\n\nAnd she's done it. A tame strike from Pliskova and Svitolina passes her to take the match.\n\nGO FURTHER\n\nElina Svitolina: Ukraine’s unbreakable spirit is a big motivation for me\n\nNadal plays down hopes of Wimbledon return\n\nWhile Nadal was positive on his hopes for the upcoming Olympics, and even possibly next year's French Open, it doesn't sound like he will be back at Wimbledon this summer.\n\n\"Wimbledon looks difficult,\" he said. \"Difficult to make the transition to grass, and then having the Olympics on clay.\n\n\"I can't confirm anything, but I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that have happened to my body. I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nWho's in action now? Pt. 2\n\nAnd, on the men's side, there are seven matches being played right now:\n\nCameron Norrie 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, *5-6 Pavel Kotov\n\nFrancisco Cerundolo 6-3, 6-3 1-1* Yannick Hanfmann\n\nOtto Virtanen 6-4, *3-4 Filip Misolic\n\nFrances Tiafoe 6-3, 2-4* Mattia Bellucci\n\nLorenzo Musetti 6-3, 2-2* Daniel Elahi Galan\n\nTommy Paul 6-2 0-0* Pedro Cachin\n\nDenis Shapovalov *2-2 Luca van Assche\n\nWho's in action now?\n\nStarting with the women's side, there are five matches in progress:\n\nAhelina Kalinina 6-3, *6-5 Camila Osorio\n\nElina Svitolina 3-6, 6-4 1-0* Karolina Pliskova\n\nSara Sorribes Tormo 7-5 0-1* Bianca Andreescu\n\nMaria Sakkari 4-3* Varvara Gracheva\n\nHarriet Dart *0-0 Linda Noskova\n\nNadal: 'I was ready for more'\n\nNadal was pretty positive about his fitness and level of performance in his post-match press conference.\n\n\"I was not that far (away),\" he said. \"I played at a good level in all ways compared to how I was playing the weeks before. Happy that I finished healthy.\n\n\"I had a tough battle and I was ready for more.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the grounds: Gauff and Fernandez ease into second round\n\nPlenty of updates to bring you from around Roland Garros:\n\nCoco Gauff through in less than an hour after 6-1, 6-1 win against Julia Avdeeva\n\nLeylah Fernandez through similarly easily after 6-2, 6-0 win against Jessika Ponchet\n\nDanielle Collins has beaten fellow American Caroline Dolehide 6-3, 6-4\n\nBritish No 1 Cam Norrie leading Pavel Kotov after three sets (6-4, 3-6, 6-3), but a break down in the fourth\n\nZverev becomes the third player to beat Nadal at Roland Garros\n\nAnd that defeat — just the fourth Nadal has suffered in 116 matches — means Nadal has now been beaten by three players at Roland Garros.\n\nThe first player to beat the Spaniard at the French Open was Robin Soderling in the fourth round in 2009.\n\nAnd you won't be surprised to hear the player responsible for his other two defeats in Paris is Novak Djokovic; beating Nadal in the quarter-final in 2015 and the semi-final in 2021.\n\nZverev joins a very exclusive club.\n\nLoad more updates"
