        "text": "One of my most formative memories was going to London on the day Princess Anne married. It was Wednesday 14th November 1973, I was 16 and I went with my friend, Kevin. We decided that we would go to the capital with the express mission of avoiding the wedding. We had recently read Anthony Burgess’ A Clockwork Orange and were feeling rebellious like all proper teenagers must. I feel bound to point out just how atypical it was for either of us to read a novel. As first-generation Basildon new town inhabitants, our homes did not contain much literature, in fact I cannot remember reading any other fiction voluntarily until I started my studies at Winchester school of Art two years later (starting with Solzhenitsyn – “August 1914” would you believe!).\n\nWe started the day by not paying for our train tickets. In those says arriving at the barrier at Pitsea station when the train was about to pull out waving a £20 note was enough to make the guard curse and wave you through. From Fenchurch Street we wandered over to Liverpool Street and had a few pints at Dirty Dick’s.\n\nFigure 1 : This is the Dirty Dicks I remember. The ceiling remained untouched after a fire on the ground floor above, and even included a cat mummified in tar. Customers were at liberty to decorate the walls with anything they might have at hand.\n\nFrom there we headed for Leicester Square to watch Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange”. We were the only two members of the audience and sat in the centre of the auditorium with our legs resting over the seat in front, chain smoking with our Harrington jackets, thigh length Doc Marten boots and white jeans with high turn-up. We sat alone in the centre of the darkened cinema, laid-back and issuing plumes of smoke into the beam of projection. We provided an image that would not have been out of place in the film, and we knew it.\n\nFigure 2: Kevin and I would have fitted comfortably into this photograph.\n\nWe then made our way to Wembley Stadium to watch Bobby Moore lead England to a 0-1 defeat against Italy. We were 16 years of age but thought nothing of expecting to be served in a pub or being allowed entrance into a, then, X-rated movie (that, incidentally, Stanley Kubrick withdrew from public circulation for over 30 years because of its alleged capacity to incite violent behaviour), or deciding on the spur-of-the-moment to go to an international football match with no thought of letting our parents know. Fired by beer and Alex and his “droogs” we felt untouchable. I am pretty sure that day fixed the notion in me that you, and only you, are in control of your life and that rules are social fabrications. The claim made by A Clockwork Orange is that without the power to choose one’s path of action human behaviour has little meaning, and I buy into that idea as vehemently now as I did then.\n\nIt is not without irony or relevance that a few years later I embarked upon a 35-year long career dominated by bells and timetables!\n\nFigure 3: The end of the England v Italy match. In those days fans were at \"liberty\" to join the team on the pitch after the game– you just needed to be sure that you could outrun the police!\n\nThe above may not be a typical day in the life of a teenager in the early 70s, but it is one that demonstrates a particular engagement with society and describes how that is supported, or not, by technology, family, regulations and laws. For me, and maybe many other teenagers of the time, this was an ideal day. I suspect that by today’s standards our adventure might seem messy and unsafe, there was certainly something lawless about it, but for Kevin and I it was the epitome of our aspiration.\n\nLearning in a Digital Landscape\n\nTo contrast, the following was written to deliver to staff in preparation for moving a school into new, “IT Rich” accommodation a few years ago. I tried to place myself into the head of a contemporary teenager, a teenager engaged with society through technology and wanted to explore how their learning in this new IT rich environment might support them. By the time I wrote the paper I had changed my view of how we might introduce social networking to pupils:\n\nHannah’s story transpired not to be as described above, but no less telling. Later publications of this paper recognised that in all likelihood Hannah had not been bullied. She had in fact constructed the bullying scenario herself and was the author of forum posts directed to herself. The circumstances surrounding Hannah’s death are obviously more complex than first thought and here is not the place to discuss the truths of the event or pass judgement on a young lady who was obviously interpreting the use of the technological tools available to her in a troubling way.\n\nWhat this does indicate is that the relationship young people have with social media and other technologies is complex and might be expected of teenagers being left to roam in a landscape unmonitored and unguided. As Kevin and I lived out our subverted celebration of a Royal wedding in London that day, paying little heed to the expectations of adults and regulations, so do the youth of today using technology. Kevin and I were not naive or unworldly, nor lacking in intellect. We were though, unregulated and were allowed to pursue our wants unchecked by parents, ticket collectors and bar tenders.\n\nI hasten to add that I have since lived my adult life as a law-abiding citizen driven to contribute to society. But what occupies my thoughts now is that our day in London was in fact a formative one for me. It contributed to who I am as an adult.\n\nIf teenagers today live in a much more regulated society where such testing of societal structures in this way is more difficult, should we perhaps anticipate that young people seek a less regulated, less monitored landscapes in which to experiment with their freedoms? If my rebellious day out took advantage of certain liberties to help me grow, how and where might the young today grow in the same way?\n\nI wonder that it might be true that there are correlations between an increase of regulation and/or enforcement; the fading of the opportunity to identify with a popular youth cult; and the use of technology to interact with peers? I am sure that most of us are glad to be free of the roaming bands of skinheads or the violent clashes between mods and rockers I witnessed in my youth. Although having worked \"south of the river\" I am all too aware that teenage factions do still exist, the problem seems more localised than we saw in the past. Do we in fact see online today behaviours that have migrated into the digital landscape because our safe, regulated and controlled (ironically more and more through the application of technology) society no longer provides the \"loopholes\" that allow young people find the boundaries?\n\nIt remains an open question for me. I am in no way advocating that we purposely provide young people with opportunities to exercise poor or dangerous behaviour. I do however wonder if our programme to sanitise behaviour, in the same way we no longer allow children to play with mud or stroke a dog, is denying the benign teenager opportunities to develop immunities to extreme behaviours.\n\nI do however remain convinced, that the longer we wait before we join our young in the landscape with which they will spend the rest of their lives engaged, the more intractable unwelcome behaviours will become."
