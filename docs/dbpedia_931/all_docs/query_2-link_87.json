        "text": "KATIE BOULTER revealed the six-word message from her boyfriend Alex De Minaur following her Wimbledon exit.\n\nBoulter, 27, was dumped out in the second round in a Battle of Britain with rival Harriet Dart.\n\nThe pair do not see eye to eye and the Leicester ace was gutted to be beaten by her fellow Billie Jean King Cup star on the biggest stage.\n\nBoulter, who magnanimously hugged her conqueror at the net, made a staggering 75 unforced errors in the three-set marathon, which saw Dart burst into tears twice when trailing before coming back to win.\n\nBut Boulter's tennis player partner De Minaur was on hand to give her some much-needed words of encouragement.\n\nShe was asked about the benefit of having a boyfriend who is also on the tour and understands the difficulties of painful defeats.\n\nAnd Boulter revealed the simple but effective message from her other half.\n\nQuoting the Aussie, she said: \"Look, one match doesn't define my career.\"\n\n\"That's the first thing he said to me when I got off the court.\n\n\"He knows what he's talking about. It's not his first rodeo.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\n\"He's been through it all before. I'm lucky to have that support.\"\n\nDe Minaur was in Wimbledon action on Thursday morning and delayed his press conference by more than an hour to be in Boulter's player box on No1 Court.\n\nHe said: \"It's what happens in tennis, right? You have your good days, you have your bad days, and everything in between.\n\n\"Losing sucks. That's the reality of it. It doesn't matter whether you lose in the first round, in the final, or anything in between, it's never easy.\n\n\"But I think the most important thing for her is that this match doesn't define her in any way, shape, or form.\n\n\"I'm so proud of what she's done, what she's accomplished this whole grass-court season. She's just going to keep on kicking on.\n\n\"Ultimately, whether it's one way or the other, it's just being there for each other.
