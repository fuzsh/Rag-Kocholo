        "text": "Katie Boulter should break into the world’s top 100 after grinding past Barbora Krejcikova in three sets to reach the Tianjin Open quarter-finals.\n\nThe 22-year-old British star will now face top seed Karolina Pliskova in Friday’s last-eight encounter, after prevailing over world number 227 Krejcikova 6-3 1-6 6-3.\n\nBoulter dropped serve three times en route to conceding the second set, only to fire back and book her meeting with world number six Pliskova.\n\nSecond seed Caroline Garcia cruised past Chinese qualifier Zhang Yuxuan 6-3 6-4 to move into her 10th quarter-final in 2018.\n\nGarcia will now face Petra Martic, and expects a tough challenge despite beating the Croatian in straight sets earlier this season.\n\n“I played her in Madrid this year; she has a good serve and a good forehand, so I’ll have to play my best and see what I can do,” Garcia said.\n\nElise Mertens needed little more than an hour to sweep past Jana Cepelova 6-2 6-3 and into a last-eight meeting with Su-wei Hsieh, while Timea Bacsinszky rallied after a slow start to see off Misaki Doi 1-6 6-3 7-5 and will now face Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nSeventh seed Daria Gavrilova beat Romania’s Monica Niculescu 6-3 4-6 7-6 (3) in the second round at the Hong Kong Open.\n\nQiang Wang saw off Christina McHale of the United States 7-5 6-1, while top seed Elina Svitolina eased past Nao Hibino 6-0 6-3 and Shuai Zhang beat Lesley Kerkhove 6-1 6-7 (4) 6-1.\n\nAt the WTA Ladies Linz in Austria, Margarita Gasparyan upset second seed Kiki Bertens in a three-set thriller to win 7-5 2-6 7-6(3).\n\nGasparyan’s victory was her first over a top-10 player, two months after returning from almost two years out due to multiple knee injuries, and will play fifth seed Camila Giorgi of Italy in the quarter-finals."
