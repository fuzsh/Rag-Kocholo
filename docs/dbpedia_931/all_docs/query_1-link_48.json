        "text": "Reigning champion Katie Boulter came back from a set down to beat Emma Raducanu - booking her place in the Rothesay Nottingham Open final against world No.1 and 2021 Wimbledon runner-up Karolina Pliskova later today.\n\nAfter losing the first set tie-break late yesterday, Boulter rallied back to beat the 2021 US Open champion 6-7(13), 6-3, 6-4 in a combined three hours and 13 minutes.\n\n“What a match, what an incredible player – I know she’s only going to get better and better,” she said after the match. “She makes it so tough for you to close it out – I’m just happy to get through today.”\n\nIt was Boulter who came knocking at the door early against the Raducanu serve, which proved a theme throughout the rest of the match. At 3-3 she saw three break points come and go, but some excellent hands at the net followed by a Raducanu double fault edged the British No.1 ahead.\n\nThe reigning champion only continued to accelerate through the gears – closing the set out with back-to-back breaks before moving 4-2 ahead in the decider.\n\nDealing with the windy conditions and in the tightest period of the match, both players struggled on serve the rest of the way. Boulter lost her service game at 4-2 and then serving for the match at 5-3, but equally on return she was just too good. Looking for her third consecutive break on her first match point – Boulter ripped off her 54th winner of the match to make her second straight final in Nottingham.\n\n2016 champion Pliskova is into the final of the Rothesay Open Nottingham with a 6-7(9), 6-1, 6-4 win over Diane Parry.\n\nPliskova seemed to have full control in the opening set, breaking on the third service game in which she had break point and served for it at 5-4. However, Pliskova’s level hadn’t quite been that of her semi-final win over Ons Jabeur to start and Parry capitalised quickly on her chance to break and force the tie-break.\n\nWith both players missing set point opportunities – it took a stroke of luck from Parry on a lucky net cord at 9-9 facing Pliskova’s serve to give her the edge she needed to see out the set in an hour and 10 minutes.\n\nIt was an instant reply from the Czech, breaking on Parry’s opening service game of the second. Parry seemed to completely lose her rhythm just as Pliskova began to catch the ball sweetly off the return.\n\nA double break forced a decider and while Parry was able to hang in there, the writing appeared to be on the wall. The Frenchwoman had break point at 5-4 down to level it again, but the Czech was too strong on serve – seeing out the win in two hours and 25 minutes.\n\nKatie Boulter and Emma Raducanu will have to return tomorrow to complete their semi-final at the Rothesay Open Nottingham with the 2021 US Open champion leading by a set 7-6(13).\n\nBoth players were near enough faultless on serve through a highly competitive match on Centre Court. With nothing between them, it was clear very early on that the Lexus GB Billie Jean King Cup teammates would have to settle it in the tie-break.\n\nRaducanu had a slip on the baseline at 3-1 down as Boulter edged three points in front and seemed to have the advantage, but both players would go on to have set points in a tense battle. On her sixth opportunity to close the set after an hour and 20 minutes, Raducanu finally got the breakthrough with a smash winner to take the breaker 15-13.\n\nWith the conditions getting slippery and light starting to go, the decision was made to call play for the day.\n\nEarlier in the day, Karolina Pliskova booked a place in the semi-finals of the women’s singles draw after winning a marathon match against top seed Ons Jabeur 7-6(8), 6-7(3), 7-5.\n\nIn the battle of the former Wimbledon finalists, it was Pliskova who dominated the decisive final set. Although Jabeur was able to overturn an initial break of serve by the Czech, she struggled on serve – winning just 5/15 points off her second – and hit too many unforced errors in the business end of the match.\n\nPliskova will play France’s Diane Parry in the next round, who beat Australia’s Kimberly Birrell 6-3, 7-6(4).\n\nThe winner of which is set to face either Boulter or Raducanu in the final.\n\nMen's draw: Guaranteed British finalist\n\nCharles Broom, Billy Harris and Jacob Fearnley are through to the men’s singles semi-final at the Rothesay Open Nottingham.\n\nBroom got the upset of the day after defeating second seed Dan Evans 3-6, 6-3 6-2.\n\nWith the outdoor courts unplayable, the British duo had to play their quarter-final inside, which seemed to benefit qualifier Broom. After clinching the second set, Broom won the first eight points of the decider against the world No.62 as he went on to seal his best win of his career by ranking.\n\nHe'll play Harris progressed to the final four after his opponent Mikhail Kukushkin retired with the Brit leading 6-1, 2-1.\n\nThe Briton has now made back-to-back ATP Challenger semi-finals on grass after playing in Surbiton last week.\n\nFearnley picked up the biggest win of his career against world No.96 Juncheng Shang - knocking out the third seed 7-5, 7-5 in an hour and 42 minutes to set up a clash with Italy’s Mattia Bellucci in his first ATP Challenger Tour semi-final.\n\nThe TCU graduate – who won he men’s doubles in Nottingham last year – came from a break behind in the first set, before saving three break points trailing 5-4 in the second as he closed out the victory late on Saturday afternoon.\n\nBellucci made the final four after he knocked out 21-year-old Brit Jack Pinnington Jones 6-4, 7-6(0) in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe young Brit - who knocked out British No.1 Cam Norrie in the previous round - led 5-3 in the second and had six set points come and go as Bullucci's resilience saw him over the line in the tie-break.\n\nKatie Boulter is another step closer to retaining her Rothesay Open Nottingham title as she battled the weather and her opponent to reach a second consecutive semi-final at her home tournament.\n\nThe reigning champion beat fifth seed Magdalena Frech 6-2, 6-4 in an hour and 19 minutes to clinch her eighth successive win at the Lexus Nottingham Tennis Centre.\n\nAfter rain stopped play with Boulter leading 4-2 in the opening set – the British No.1 came out firing when the weather briefly decided to let up. The 27-year-old looked like a player on a mission as she overturned a 2-0 deficit to break twice early in the second set as well.\n\nBoulter has dropped just one set in her last eight matches in Nottingham and she is working her way back to title-winning form, commanding from the baseline and coming in to attack at every opportunity.\n\nThe reward for her victory will be an all-British semi-final against either Emma Raducanu or Fran Jones, guaranteeing a Briton in Sunday’s final.\n\nIn the first match on Centre, Jones got over the line against USA’s Ashlyn Krueger 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.\n\nThe bad weather stopped play yesterday with Jones serving for the match at 6-5, 30-30 in the decider. Despite the long wait to get back on court, Jones held her nerve to save a break point and hit two big first serves to see out her second win on grass.\n\nManchester United fan Jones, saw the lighter side in her post match interview on court. “I think that was a more excruciating wait than when Man United were up 2-1 against City in the FA Cup final,” she joked.\n\n“Definitely tested my worst attribute which is my patience. Ons (Jabeur) was telling me to serve two aces and I got a few first serves in so we’ll take it.”\n\nShe’ll now play Raducanu in the quarter-final later today, someone who she has become close with in recent weeks.\n\n“It’ll be a great match, no pressure on me I’ve just got to come, enjoy it and hopefully give the crowd a taste of what hopefully is the future of British tennis.”\n\nElsewhere, Ons Jabeur beat Linda Fruhvirtova 6-2, 6-1 to set up a quarter-final clash with fellow Wimbledon finalist Karolina Pliskova.\n\nHarriet Dart and Diane Parry are into the women's doubles final after the British, French duo got a walkover in the semi-final against Clara Burel and Camila Osorio.\n\nEmma Raducanu is safely into the quarter-finals of the Rothesay Open Nottingham after another dominant performance out on Centre Court.\n\nMeanwhile on Court 1, Jack Pinnington Jones produced the upset of the tournament so far – knocking out top seed and British No.1 Cam Norrie.\n\nRaducanu will make an appearance in the final eight of a grass court tournament for the first time in her career after she blitzed past Ukraine’s Daria Snigur 6-2, 6-2 in an hour and 20 minutes.\n\n\"It was an extremely tricky match,\" she said. \"I knew before I came on today that I needed to be on it because Daria is a really good player and grass court player especially.\n\n\"Today I could really hear and feel the support. It’s all of the Brits, it’s not just me – we’re all doing pretty well. We’re trying to take the title home again one of us.\"\n\nAfter going a break and 2-0 down to start the match, Raducanu quickly adjusted to Snigur’s unorthodox style. The 2021 US Open champion won six games in a row, losing just eight points to take a one set lead and kept her foot firmly on the gas.\n\nThe Brit will be encouraged by a strong serving performance – hitting 11 aces and saving seven of eight break points faced. As with her first match she had a more difficult time serving out the final game, but on her third match point, she connected on a big forehand that Snigur just couldn’t find an answer for.\n\nRaducanu could face fellow Brit Fran Jones in the next round. Jones is on court now against Ashyln Krueger of the USA.\n\nMen's draw: Pinnington Jones upsets idol Norrie in three sets\n\nPinnington Jones continues his excellent run at the Rothesay Open Nottingham with the biggest win of his career – knocking out world No.39 Norrie 1-6, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nAfter a slow start from the young Brit who lost the opening five games of the match, but once he settled on serve he quickly grew into the contest and played on the offensive against the former Wimbledon semi-finalist.\n\nThrough to his first ATP Challenger quarter-final, the 21-year-old came back from a break down in the decider and saved seven break points the rest of the way to seal the win on his first match point after two hours and 20 minutes,\n\nIt will be a victory that stands long in the memory of the young Brit – Pinnington Jones is currently studying at Texas Christian University (TCU) and earlier in the week said that alumni Norrie was one of his idols.\n\nHe'll play Italy's Mattia Bellucci in the final eight.\n\nDefending champion Katie Boulter is through to the quarter-finals at the Rothesay Open Nottingham on a day that has already seen four British singles wins – including Dan Evans, Charles Broom and Jacob Fearnley.\n\nThird seed Boulter beat Canadian Rebecca Marino 6-4, 6-3 in an hour and 16 minutes in a relatively straight forward match for the British No.1.\n\n\"A lot of it was about staying sharp, going with the flow and serving well - it was a battle,\" Boulter said.\n\n“I have some childhood memories here so I always get that warm fuzzy feeling every time I come out here. Being back where it all started reminds me how far I’ve come.\"\n\nFacing a different type of challenge to her first round match against fellow Brit Harriet Dart, Boulter looked fully in control as she sped off to a set and 3-0 lead in no time at all.\n\nMarino managed to salvage one of the two breaks of serve, but Boulter shrugged off the disappointment and lost just two points on serve the rest of the way.\n\nIn the quarters, she will play the winner of fifth seed Magdalena Frech up against Lexus Surbiton Trophy runner-up Tatjana Maria.\n\nLast year's semi-finalist Heather Watson bowed out in the second round to former world No.1 and 2021 Wimbledon runner-up Karolina Pliskova 6-4, 6-4.\n\nWatson bounced back from a set and a break down to lead 4-2 in the second before the Czech star reeled off four consecutive games to clinch a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nMen's draw: British trio book quarter-final spots\n\nEvans, Broom and Fearnley are through to the Rothesay Open Nottingham quarter-finals with four Brits now guaranteed for the final eight.\n\nEvans had to be at his best to beat Wimbledon boys’ singles champion Henry Searle 7-6(4), 7-6(5) in a highly competitive match.\n\nThe two-time champion’s experience shone through in the biggest moments as the British No.3 edged two tie-break sets in two hours and two minutes.\n\nSearle – who won three matches to get through qualifying and reach round two – looked more than ready to compete at this level with a serve that will cause almost every top player problems on the grass.\n\nEvans did well to keep his composure and his range when Searle appeared to tighten up slightly when serving to consolidate his second set break and in both tie-breaks.\n\nHe will move on to play Broom, who progressed into the final eight with the biggest win of his career against Lexus Surbiton Trophy champion Lloyd Harris 7-6(2), 2-6, 6-4.\n\nThe 26-year-old qualifier saved two break points in the decider before winning the last 11 consecutive points to see out a well-earned win. He's one of two British qualifiers to make the quarters so far.\n\nFearnley is into his first ATP Challenger singles quarter-final after beating fellow Brit Paul Jubb 6-1, 6-7(12), 6-3 in two hours and three minutes.\n\nThe 22-year-old got off to a lightning start out on Nottingham’s Centre Court and looked full of confidence off the back of his first win at this level only the day before.\n\nFearnley put in a commanding performance in the opener, spraying winners off both wings to break Jubb twice and take a one set lead inside 26 minutes.\n\nFearnley admitted earlier in the week that Jubb had been a big inspiration for Brits like himself competing in the NCAA out in America and he certainly brought his A-game against the 24-year-old from Hull.\n\nIt would have been easy for Fearnley to let his game drop after missing out on seven match points in the second set tie-break, the Brit came back with the perfect response. He released a huge backhand winner on his first break point of the set before closing out the set on his 10th match point.\n\nLexus Surbiton Trophy semi-finalist Billy Harris has moved on into the second round of the men’s draw with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Coleman Wong.\n\nWith poor light yesterday forcing the duo to return on Wednesday and finish their match, the Briton picked up where he left off against the 20-year-old ATP Next Gen star with the decisive break on the first game of the second set.\n\nHarris will play another rising star of the ATP Tour in 17-year-old Brazilian Joao Fonseca.\n\nEmma Raducanu’s impressive first round win and Fran Jones's maiden grass court victory has been just two of the British highlights of the day so far with Cam Norrie, Dan Evans, Henry Searle, Jake Fearnley, Jack Pinnington Jones and Charles Broom all heading into round two.\n\nRaducanu’s grass court comeback saw her pick up a dominant 6-1, 6-4 win over Japan’s Ena Shibahara.\n\n713 days since her last match on grass, the 21-year-old proved too strong on the return as she wrapped up the win in just an hour and 10 minutes.\n\n“It’s been a few weeks since I played a competitive match so I didn’t know how it was going to go, but I think my intentions were great from the start of the match,\" she said.\n\n“It’s amazing to be playing on home turf, it’s been ages since I last played in the UK. To come here and feel like everyone is behind me is really nice and I’m cherishing every moment.\"\n\nIn yesterday’s press conference, Raducanu said that her wrists were back ‘better than ever’ and the young Brit was certainly in promising form on Nottingham’s Centre Court.\n\nAfter saving break points on her opening service game, Raducanu simply overpowered Shibahara to move just one game away from victory at 5-1 in the second.\n\nHowever, the Briton was made to work for it. She lost the next three straight games, but just as Shibahara was looking to get back level, Raducanu sealed her sixth and most decisive break to round off her first career win at the Rothesay Open Nottingham.\n\nIn the second round, she will face Ukraine’s Daria Snigur, who earlier in the day knocked out second seed and compatriot Marta Kostyuk 6-3, 6-3.\n\nJones clinched one the upsets of the day as she knocked out eighth seed Caroline Dolehide 7-6(3), 6-3.\n\nThe 23-year-old came into Nottingham having never won a match on grass before and showed incredible fight to stave off all 10 of the break points she faced - including five set points serving to force a tie-break in the first set.\n\nHer next battle will come against American Ashlyn Krueger, whjo claimed a comfortable win over Yafan Wang earlier in the day. If Jones and Raducanu win their next matches, they will play each other in the quarter-finals.\n\nTop seed Ons Jabeur opened her account with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Camila Osorio, while Magdalena Frech, Tatjana Maria and Rebecca Marino all clinched victorie in the first round.\n\nMen's draw: Norrie through in three sets; Evans & Searle set up second round clash\n\nNorrie came through a tough contest with qualifier Sho Shimabukuro 6-1, 4-6, 6-3 in an hour and 44 minutes in the final match of the day.\n\nAfter a blistering start, the British No.1 had to dig deep in a tough third set. The Brit struck gold with a laser backhand down the line at 3-2 in the decider to set up his second break point of the set before the Japanese star fired long to give Norrie the break required to close out the win.\n\nNorrie is set to play TCU college alumni Pinnington Jones in the next round, after the 21-year-old came back from a set and 5-3 down to beat wild card Arthur Fery 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.\n\nEvans will play Wimbledon boys’ champion Searle in the second round of the Rothesay Open Nottingham in the second of two all-British clashes.\n\nTwo-time champion Evans booked his place in round two with a victory 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 win over Switzerland’s Dominic Stricker.\n\nReturning to finish the match after poor light stopped play yesterday Stricker overturned a break deficit before he was forced to take a medical timeout after a slip. The British No.3 seized his chance in the final stages – breaking for 5-3 before closing out the win in two hours and 20 minutes.\n\nHe now faces Searle, who knocked out 2021 runner-up and former world No.53 Denis Kudla 7-6(4), 6-4 in the first match of the day on Court 1.\n\nThe 18-year-old - who was supported by the LTA National Academy in Loughborough - clinched the one and only break of the match as he defeated the 31-year-old American to claim his third win so far at Nottingham this week.\n\nElsewhere, Fearnley has his first career ATP Challenger singles win after beating China’s Yunchaokete Bu 6-2, 7-5 in an hour and 23 minutes.\n\nFearnley – who ranked over 300 places lower than his first round opponent – broke on Bu’s opening service and never looked back. In the highest-ranking win of his career, the Texas Christian University star won over half of his points facing second serve and closed out the victory and his fourth break on his third match point.\n\nHe moves on to play Paul Jubb in the second round – guaranteeing a British quarter-finalist.\n\nBroom is also into the second round after coming back from a set down to beat Japan's Shintaro Mochizuki 6-7(9), 6-4, 6-2 in two hours and 20 minutes. He'll play Lexus Surbiton Trophy champion Lloyd Harris next.\n\nHowever, Jan Choinski lost out in his first round match against Alex Bolt 7-6(12), 7-5.\n\nChoinski had four set points in the opening set but couldn't find a way past the Australian's serve, who saw out the win without conceding a break.\n\nReigning champion Katie Boulter and former British No.1 Heather Watson are through to the second round at the Rothesay Open Nottingham after a testing day at the Lexus Nottingham Tennis Centre.\n\nMeanwhile in the men’s draw – Paul Jubb knocked out the seventh seed to reach the second round at Nottingham for the second time in his career as four Brits came through qualifying.\n\nDan Evans will return to finish his first round match tomorrow locked at 6-3, 4-6 against Switzerland's Dominic Stricker as poor light brought play to a close.\n\nBoulter won the standout match of the day against fellow Brit Harriet Dart 6-7(5), 6-4, 7-5 in three hours and 13 minutes to book a second round clash against either Viktorija Golubic or Rebecca Marino.\n\n“Full credit to her, that was an absolute battle and she’s an incredible grass court player,” Boulter said. “I just tried to fight and stay in the points because she played some seriously good stuff. I’m really happy to be through.”\n\nWith both players battling against the cold, windy conditions, the opening set saw eight breaks of serve, before Dart closed out four straight points from 5-4 down in the tie-break to edge ahead.\n\nBoulter beat Dart on her way to her first WTA title last year and raised her game in the second – breaking on the opening game and losing just four points off her first serve to draw level.\n\nDart battled back from 3-1 down in the decider but as the pair past the three-hour mark to 5-5, the defending champion edged in front once again. The British No.1 hit a brace of winners against the Dart serve and capitalised on an error from an attempted drop shot before she saw out the victory on her third match point.\n\nWatson got the Brits off to a winning start in the first match of the tournament on Centre Court – defeating American Kayla Day 4-6, 6-0, 6-4.\n\nWatson – who was a semi-finalist at the Rothesay Open Nottingham last year – was thrilled to get her comeback win and is feeling back to her best on the grass.\n\n“I couldn’t wait to get back on the grass this year,” she said. “The first day of training I felt at home, I felt I knew my identity as a player again and it’s just such a joy to play at home.”\n\nAfter falling behind an early break rain brought action to a halt after just three games and when the two returned, Watson looked far more settled. While the American was able serve out the set – Watson was on the ascent and quickly bagged the initial break in the second as Day showed signs that she was struggling with the conditions.\n\nHaving won seven straight games to level the score at one set apiece, Watson closed out the win with a break at 5-4 in the decider.\n\nHowever, Britain's Lily Miyazaki lost her opening match against Czech qualifier Linda Fruhvirtova 6-4, 7-5.\n\nEmily Appleton's run in Nottingham through qualifying to the main draw also came to an end at the hands of Australia's Kimberly Birrell 6-3, 7-5.\n\nMen's draw: Jubb through in straight sets; four Brits qualify\n\nBritish wild card Jubb knocked out world No.136 Duje Ajdukovic 7-6(1), 6-4 in the opening round to mark his second victory over a top seeded player on grass in the last two weeks.\n\nJubb edged a tight opening set with a dominant display in the tie-break, before taking full advantage of the Croatian's drop in focus during the second after questioning a call with the umpire. The 24-year-old kept his nerve and sealed back-to-back breaks to set up a second round match with either Yunchaokete Bu or Jake Fearnley.\n\nThere will be nine Brits in the ATP Challenger main draw this week after Wimbledon boys' champion Henry Searle and Britain's Fearnley, Jack Pinnington Jones and Charles Broom all came through qualifying.\n\nSearle - who knocked out last year's Lexus Surbiton Trophy runner up Jurij Rodionov in the first round - beat Australia's Luke Saville 6-4, 7-6(0) to earn his place in this year's draw.\n\nThe 18-year-old came back from a break down in the second set and hit 13 aces in the match to see out a win in an hour and 44 minutes.\n\n2023 men's doubles title-winner Fearnley beat world No.272 Mark Lajal 6-2, 6-4 to reach only his second ATP Challenger singles main draw.\n\nThe 22-year-old currently stars in the NCAA for Texas Christian University (TCU) where British No.1 Cam Norrie used to attend.\n\nHis college teammate Pinnington Jones defeated back-to-back Brits to reach the main draw - finishing with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Felix Gill. This is the Brit's first pro tournament of the year having recently been crowned 2024 NCAA Championships Most Outstanding Player.\n\nFinally, recent M25 Nottingham champion Broom extended his unbeaten record at the Lexus Nottingham Tennis Centre to seven matches after defeating Blake Ellis 6-4, 6-4."
