In this podcast episode, you’ll hear stories about a man overcoming his obesity and depression through the magic of MMA fighting, a model who escapes the insidious modeling industry, a volunteer who helps restore an historic C-47 aircraft for the commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of D-Day and a mother making a difficult decision on the day of an important hunt.

Note that the quality of the sound is not as perfect as we would like it to be. These stories are really worthwhile and we want you to hear them. Thank you.

Dave Boulter is an athlete who can no longer play sports. The resulting depression and weight gain drive him to try a sport he never thought he would try — MMA fighting. He calls his story “That Didn’t Hurt So Bad!”

Dave Boulter is a New England boy who moved to Montana early in the Spring of 1993. He graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in Forestry specializing in Recreation Management. He has been making his living as a Stone Mason for approximately 20 years and is a veteran athlete and coach in Mixed Martial Arts.

Ainsley McWha begins her modeling career at 16 and is enthralled by the glitz and glamor before she discovers the dark side of the industry and finally escapes.

Near the end of Ainsley’s story, an unfortunate thing happens: she is heckled by someone in the audience who is not listening fully to her story. This sort of behavior is never appropriate. At the live event, I made that clear after Ainsly finished. I mention this here because I kept the heckler in the edit and bleeped her comment. Doing so retains the flow of the story and shows Ainsley’s strength in pushing through to finish her story.

Ainsley calls her story “Seen & Not Heard”.

Ainsley McWha is a writer and essayist whose work appears in the current issue of Barrelhouse Journal and has previously been published in Grist, Tahoma Literary Review, Salon, and the Washington Post, among others. She was recently appointed as the chair of the Parks & Rec committee in the town where she lives. She has never seen the sitcom.

John Haines knows nothing about airplanes and loves a good cause, so he volunteers to help make “Miss Montana” airworthy so she can join the D-Day Squadron and the Daks Over Normandy in commemorating the 75th Anniversary of D-Day on June 6, 2019. (Miss Montana is a historic C-47 aircraft in the Museum of Mountain Flying in Missoula.) John calls his story “75 Years is a Good Start”.

John Haines was born and raised in Plains, MT and lived in Kumamoto, Japan for ten years. John currently works at Ace hardware so he can volunteer at the Museum of Mountain Flying.

Molly Bradford awakens on the day of the hunt to the sounds of her son coughing with the croup and has to decide if she should cancel the hunt. She calls her story “The Push and the Pull – or – Spilling Milk”

adaptive ski program at

great opportunity i was like wow this is

02:26

some really cool people to work with

02:27

adaptive skiing helping people out i get

02:30

to ski

02:32

win so i started getting close to

02:35

graduation time

02:38

there’s a really good

02:40

internship program back there and a

02:42

mountain

02:43

at a tashberg peak it was right down the

02:45

road from where my grandparents live

02:47

my parents are there all my friends i

02:49

was like okay so

02:51

drove back there three weeks into that

02:53

internship i was free skiing

02:56

with a paraplegic and an amputee

03:00

when i had a freak accident destroyed my

03:02

knee

03:04

03:06

reconstructive surgery two days later

03:09

two weeks after that those same two guys

03:12

that i was skiing with

03:14

had me skiing in a mono ski as if i was

03:16

a paraplegic my

03:18

my boss at the time was like i’m not

03:20

paying attention to this and she

03:23

avoided eye contact with me while i was

03:25

had my knee in the brace and

03:27

icing it in between runs you know with

03:29

my little cryo pack and

03:32

but i learned how to ski in a monastery

03:35

whole new experience it’s

03:36

fantastic so but i was

03:40

really missing montana that injury

03:44

caused a lot of setbacks with me i

03:46

started getting depressed i wanted to

03:48

move back to montana i couldn’t play

03:49

sports

03:50

you know skiing i could sort of do but i

03:52

was very limited no

03:53

sock or none of that so i don’t know i

03:56

was

03:56

missing montana started eating too much

04:00

and drinking beers and soda and

04:03

i don’t know i found out that i really

04:05

like to eat crappy food

04:08

but i started packing it on and i was

04:11

bummed out but i made up my mind i have

04:14

to get back to montana so i hustled back

04:16

to montana

04:17

2001 um like right after the world trade

04:22

went down i said i really need to get

04:24

out of the east coast and screw this

04:26

place so

04:27

i came back to montana um and

04:30

right i was here for about a year and

04:33

one of my good friends i was struggling

04:34

looking for a sport and soccer

04:36

nah but my buddy

04:40

suggested that i get into brazilian jiu

04:42

jitsu and i said what is that you know

04:44

and we

04:45

the ultimate fighting and ufc

04:48

and pride fighting championships out of

04:50

japan started coming in to

04:53

i don’t know popularity at that time the

04:55

early 2000s and

04:57

we would all get together and watch you

04:59

know these athletes wail on each other

05:01

and that’s kind of how i looked at it i

05:03

didn’t really see the

05:04

art of it but i agreed i was like all

05:08

right

05:08

i’ll try it you know so i got my ghee

05:11

and i went to

05:12

sakura down the road here on higgins and

05:15

i

05:15

uh yeah i found out quickly how

05:18

amazing that sport is you can really

05:21

cause a huge amount of damage to

05:23

somebody but

05:24

as soon as they tap you’re not injured

05:27

anymore

05:28

like you you can keep going you know so

05:30

i found that out but

05:31

you know through rolling i injured

05:33

myself whatever

05:36

kept training uh a little bit

05:39

off and on um still looking for a new

05:41

11:59

welcome ainsley mcguire

12:12

when i was 16 years old i lived in the

12:15

sleepy suburbs of ottawa

12:17

canada’s capital

12:20

i was a straight a student i benchwarmed

12:23

for the basketball team

12:25

i’d never been on a date i happily wore

12:28

the same baggy jeans and gray zip up

12:30

hoodie to school

12:31

every day and the only fashion magazines

12:34

i ever flipped through

12:36

were the 17s that came to my house every

12:38

month addressed my older sister

12:41

so it came as a huge surprise to

12:42

everyone but mostly me

12:45

that after a series of events i won’t go

12:47

into now

12:48

i was scouted discovered by one of

12:51

manhattan’s top

12:52

modeling agencies the weekend before my

12:56

17th birthday i was flown to paris to

12:58

walk in my first fashion show

13:01

backstage before the show christian dior

13:04

spring summer 95 that was held in the

13:07

carousel de louvre

13:08

i sat next to models that even i had

13:10

heard of linda evangelista helena

13:12

christensen

13:13

tyra banks the champagne flowed

13:17

the camera flashes popped the show

13:19

itself was a blur

13:21

but paris was so beautiful

13:25

that’s what i told my friends and family

13:27

when i got home

13:28

and this is what i didn’t tell them that

13:31

at the fitting

13:32

the day before the show when it was my

13:34

turn to get my outfit approved

13:37

the designer an older italian man

13:39

stepped towards me

13:41

and without saying a word he ripped off

13:43

my shirt

13:45

next with his bare hands he tried to

13:48

readjust my breasts

13:50

into something that would better fit his

13:51

creation as if i were merely a block of

13:54

clay

13:55

and when it was clear this wasn’t going

13:56

to happen he just turned and walked away

13:58

from me

13:59

leaving me standing there half naked in

14:01

a room full of strangers

14:05

i rushed to find my own clothes that i

14:07

had left folded in a neat pile in the

14:08

corner somewhere

14:09

and i was stopped multiple times by

14:11

other models who said things like oh my

14:13

god the designer noticed you and

14:14

oh my god you are so lucky and as i

14:17

fought to hold back the tears welling in

14:19

my eyes

14:20

i was confused because not only was the

14:23

designer’s behavior

14:24

acceptable it was enviable

14:28

and i don’t know how i knew it but i did

14:31

know

14:32

in that moment that if i wanted to

14:34

succeed in this business

14:35

i’d need to learn how to keep my mouth

14:37

shut and of course i wanted to succeed i

14:40

was 16 years old

14:42

and i just been invited into this elite

14:43

industry i was wooed by its promise of

14:46

travel and money and fame

14:48

of escape one month after i graduated

14:52

high school when i was 17 years old

14:54

i moved to new york city unknowingly

14:57

about to embark on a career

14:58

that sells sex before i’d even had sex

15:03

for the next three years i jumped from

15:05

market to market milan paris london

15:08

hamburg new york

15:09

and at first i loved it i shot for

15:11

countless magazines i wore high-fashion

15:13

clothes on the runway

15:15

there were vip parties complete with

15:17

celebrity interactions there were free

15:19

dinners free drinks

15:20

and yet when i was 20 i couldn’t keep up

15:22

with the pressures inherent in the

15:24

industry anymore like

15:26

the imposed thinness and the constant

15:28

relocation

15:30

before the internet living abroad was an

15:32

extremely isolating experience

15:35

which only compounded my feelings of

15:37

depression

15:38

and again i was confused because here i

15:40

was surrounded by all these things

15:42

you’re supposed to want

15:43

to have here i was surrounded by people

15:45

constantly telling me how

15:47

lucky i was and yet i didn’t feel that

15:50

way

15:51

fortunately my parents insisted i go

15:53

back to school which i did and i got a

15:55

degree in psychology

15:56

but the spring before i graduated i was

15:58

scouted to model again

16:00

and i figured that modeling could be a

16:01

great way to make some money in the

16:02

short term

16:04

i mean i possessed the skill set and i

16:07

figured that i was strong enough to

16:08

handle anything

16:09

the industry threw out me this time

16:11

around i was sucked back in

16:15

in the fall of 2012 i was 35 years old

16:18

living in new york and my job still was

16:21

model

16:22

and though the nature of the bookings

16:24

had changed over the course of my career

16:26

from magazine covers and campaigns to

16:29

what

16:29

those in the industry referred to as the

16:32

closet

16:33

i spent days sitting in a windowless

16:36

room sometimes as small as four by ten

16:38

feet

16:38

sometimes bigger sometimes alone and

16:41

sometimes with other models

16:42

and i’d wait until somebody brought me

16:45

an outfit or

16:46

100 to try on and model for the buyers

16:49

from upscale department stores

16:51

and boutiques in the adjacent showroom

16:55

now there are many times over the course

16:56

of my career when i probably should have

16:58

considered quitting

17:00

like that first fashion show for example

17:03

or when i was 19

17:04

and an agent invited me into his office

17:06

and told me to not eat anything for the

17:08

next two days

17:09

and over the next two weeks to really

17:11

watch what i ate but

17:12

drink a lot of water or when i was 25

17:15

and my agent suggested that i never tell

17:17

anyone i had a university degree

17:20

because it might make people feel bad

17:21

about themselves

17:23

or when i was 31 or when i was 31

17:28

and a designer spit in my face on set at

17:30

a photo shoot because

17:32

he decided he didn’t like me

17:35

and while all of those instances and

17:37

others made me

17:38

feel less than worthless more than

17:41

worthless

17:43

i never said anything because i had

17:44

learned from the start that to speak up

17:46

meant to be difficult

17:47

and to be difficult meant to be

17:48

overlooked for jobs jobs that sometimes

17:50

came

17:51

with a huge paycheck

17:54

and that’s the thing about modeling the

17:57

money isn’t always there

17:58

but the promise of money is

18:01

which is how i lasted in the business as

18:04

long as i did

18:05

that and as time passed i came to

18:06

believe i wasn’t capable of doing

18:08

anything else

18:10

on a monday afternoon in november 2012

18:13

as i stood out in the showroom

18:14

modeling my next outfit one of the

18:17

buyers looked me in the eye

18:18

an older man and he said that shirt

18:21

makes your belly look

18:22

big that wasn’t a big deal i was

18:26

so used to comments like that comments

18:27

dissecting my appearance and telling me

18:29

what was wrong with me to my face

18:32

i was numb to comments like that what

18:34

made this time so

18:36

special was that he said it to me as i

18:38

stood next to a model who had just

18:40

announced in the closet that she was

18:41

pregnant

18:42

five months along she hadn’t told the

18:46

client

18:46

yet and i got this because she like the

18:48

rest of us was hired for her exact

18:50

measurements

18:51

and to deviate even a centimeter meant

18:53

to possibly lose her job

18:56

so in cahoots with the dresser the woman

18:58

whose job it was to

19:00

help us get dressed uh the pregnant

19:02

model ensured that all

19:04

of the baggier clothes went to her

19:06

leaving me with all the form-fitting

19:08

ones

19:10

when i got home at the end of the day my

19:12

booker called ainsley

19:14

are you on your period yes i said

19:18

i lied oh good i assured the client that

19:20

must be the case but they still ask that

19:22

you don’t come back to work this week

19:26

now it’s important to note here that at

19:27

this time i was in my second year of

19:29

grad school getting an mfa in creative

19:31

writing

19:32

but i’m ashamed to say that up until

19:34

three years earlier i hadn’t even known

19:36

that an mfa in creative writing was a

19:37

thing

19:38

i had been so sheltered by this industry

19:41

i had remained so amenable to it

19:44

but i had gravitated towards writing

19:46

because i had amassed so many stories

19:48

and i wanted to learn the best way to

19:50

tell them but i still didn’t know what i

19:52

was going to do once my career ended i

19:54

mean it’s not like anyone in the

19:55

industry cares to help you figure out

19:57

what’s next you’re valuable to them

19:59

until you just aren’t

20:00

so it was as if i existed every day

20:02

living on a conveyor belt

20:03

a lineup of hungry women behind me

20:06

thinner younger

20:07

prettier versions of myself ready to

20:09

knock me off

20:10

at any moment and into the oblivion of

20:12

old age

20:15

when i hung up the phone with my booker

20:16

i started to cry

20:18

and i knew in that moment something

20:20

needed to change

20:23

a year and a half later my then

20:24

boyfriend and i left new york city and

20:26

moved to southeast idaho

20:28

of all places and into the house

20:33

and into the house that his

20:34

great-great-grandparents built in 1914

20:37

i’d never lived i’d never been to idaho

20:40

before but i’ve lived in many places and

20:42

i reasoned you can build a life anywhere

20:44

which is exactly what we’ve done over

20:45

the past five and a half years

20:47

and it hasn’t always been easy i’ve

20:49

worked so many odd jobs i was a

20:51

community counselor for a while

20:53

i was a substitute high school teacher

20:55

for three days

20:57

i did it wasn’t for me i

21:00

i do copy editing for a home healthcare

21:03

company i even worked in a retail

21:04

clothing store for a while

21:07

and with each of those jobs i was lucky

21:09

to get paid in two weeks what i used to

21:11

earn

21:11

in a day sometimes even an hour as a

21:13

model

21:15

and yeah that was tough to take at first

21:18

but now i can honestly say that even

21:21

though i have far

21:22

less i have never felt luckier

21:31

[Applause]

21:32

[Music]

21:36

that boyfriend became my husband we look

21:38

after each other our home and a dozen

21:40

animals

21:43

i have a garden i finally understand the

21:46

value of a hard-earned dollar

21:48

and i finally understand that my worth

21:50

as a human comes from more than being a

21:51

desirable object

21:58

and it wasn’t until i left the industry

22:02

that i understood the extent of the

22:05

psychological damage that had been

22:06

inflicted

22:08

this industry that had socialized me

22:11

this industry that had treated me the

22:12

same at 36 as it had at 16

22:15

and i was the ideal candidate i’m

22:17

ashamed to say i was an eager

22:19

malleable teenager willing to do

22:21

whatever it took in order to succeed

22:23

which is exactly what the industry is

22:25

counting on

22:26

but i’m more ashamed that i didn’t speak

22:28

up when i saw these things

22:30

that made me feel uncomfortable

22:34

and the things that i knew were wrong

22:37

in january i’m about to start a new job

22:39

i was recently hired by the college of

22:41

eastern idaho to create and teach

22:43

their first creative writing class for

22:45

credit taught on campus

22:48

and i can’t wait

22:50

[Applause]

22:53

i can’t wait to help my students

22:55

discover and develop their voices

22:58

but more than that i can’t wait to watch

23:00

as they discover

23:01

the transformative power that can come

23:03

from finally using them

23:05

thank you

23:08

[Applause]

23:14

[Music]

23:36

thank you ainsley

23:47

and thank you to everyone who is

23:48

actively listening

23:59

people who interrupt that’s not okay

24:07

[Applause]

24:09

think of it like this if you’re

24:10

conflicted it’s not consensual

24:21

john haynes was born and raised in

24:23

plains montana

24:24

[Music]

24:27

he lived in kumato japan for 10 years

24:31

john

24:32

currently works at ace hardware so he

24:34

can volunteer

24:35

at the museum of mountain flying

24:39

please note for the sake of clarity

24:42

the miss montana in the following story

24:44

is stunningly beautiful

24:47

she’s a 75 year old airplane please

24:50

welcome

24:51

john haynes

25:04

i am the volunteer coordinator out at

25:06

the museum of mountain flying

25:10

[Applause]

25:11

but it hasn’t always been that way on

25:14

january 3rd

25:15

of this year was my first day

25:17

volunteering at the museum

25:20

i opened up the door and i saw a 75 year

25:23

old dc3

25:25

well a nearly 75 year old dc3

25:28

it first came off the assembly line with

25:30

the purpose of hauling people on cargo

25:33

during world war ii it didn’t see

25:35

service beyond the american borders

25:37

but it would have a great life ahead of

25:40

it

25:48

johnson flying service bought it as a

25:50

surf surplus plane

25:52

in 1946 and used it for smoke jumping

25:55

and and hauling cargo all over the

25:57

region in

25:58

uh very rural areas

26:02

what i saw on that night was that we had

26:04

a goal of getting it

26:06

to fly by march which was interesting

26:09

because

26:10

it had no engines on it

26:13

the the interior was taken apart

26:16

and waiting for modern amenities like

26:20

good insulation and avionics to be

26:22

installed

26:23

there is no operational avion

26:26

or controls for the the flight it was

26:29

basically a shell of the plane that it

26:31

was about to become

26:33

with that in mind my first job there was

26:36

to build

26:37

shelves for the red shed in the museum

26:40

and i thought well

26:41

that’s not too sexy

26:43

[Laughter]

26:46

but when i came back later a lot of the

26:48

tools and paperwork that were screwing

26:50

across the floor when i got there were

26:52

in the shed and organized and you soon

26:54

realized

26:55

that it doesn’t matter what job you are

26:57

doing

26:58

it is all important for the big picture

27:01

my second job that i can remember doing

27:03

was getting onto one of those scissor

27:05

lifts and going up

27:06

into the nose of the plane with it in

27:09

mind

27:10

to take some of the hoses out that were

27:12

connected to the

27:13

the back of the dashboard that measured

27:15

things like fuel and oil

27:17

and i was supposed to put the labels

27:19

that were written on the hoses

27:21

onto the ports that they’re connected to

27:24

which became

27:25

interesting fast because i saw two or

27:28

three labels that said the exact same

27:30

thing

27:31

left engine fuel possibly oil

27:39

well february and march came

27:43

and went and we had a lot of progress

27:45

but

27:47

the plane hadn’t flown in about

27:51

sometime in april our lead mechanics

27:53

parents showed up from arizona and they

27:55

drove up in their rv

27:56

and were they intended on staying for

27:58

about two weeks

28:01

bill is one of those people that’s a

28:02

good example of the type of volunteers

28:04

we had out there he’s 70

28:06

plus years old and a dynamo he could be

28:09

everywhere at once

28:10

and working on just about anything on

28:12

the plane and feel very comfortable with

28:14

it

28:15

and he would tell you a good story the

28:17

whole time

28:19

his wife age and some health issues had

28:23

caught up with her

28:24

so what would happen in the afternoon is

28:27

she would need a break

28:28

and go back to their rv and stay there a

28:32

while

28:32

and when she wanted to come back she’d

28:35

honk the horn

28:36

and and bill would scurry off and wash

28:39

all the oil products off his hands

28:41

and bring her back out to to help us out

28:45

after a few rounds of the honk honk one

28:48

of our volunteers said

28:49

that’s love a few days

28:52

after that it happened we’d hear hong

28:55

kong and a chorus of

28:56

that’s love

29:01

april again a lot of progress

29:04

but it was not or miss montana was not

29:07

airborne yet

29:09

but we’re getting more and more

29:10

confident as time went on

29:12

in the first week of may now keep in

29:15

mind we’re having our send-off gala for

29:17

a plane that hadn’t flown on the weekend

29:19

of mother’s day

29:21

on the saturday before mother’s day in

29:23

the first week of may

29:25

we realized if we’re going to practice

29:28

our jump for the normandy

29:30

ceremony we needed a drop zone

29:34

in and i saw that as an opportunity

29:37

to pitch plains montana my hometown

29:42

it’s about an hour and a half drive but

29:44

a 20-minute flight so it was perfect

29:46

um now al charters who was our jump

29:50

master and i

29:50

drove up to planes and al got about a 10

29:53

minutes

29:54

noticed for this plan so he showed up to

29:56

the hangar and he said

29:57

al we’re going up to planes to find a

29:59

drop zone

30:01

mind you al isn’t very tall in stature

30:05

but he can fill up a room with his

30:08

self-confidence

30:09

and sense of purpose and i was a little

30:12

intimidated by it

30:13

um but i i was willing to take the risk

30:17

i’m back so

30:21

we drove up to planes and we talked to

30:23

the person who manages

30:24

the airport up there and we went out to

30:27

visit the airport

30:29

and and al looks around

30:32

and he says

30:36

it would work on a perfect day

30:40

and i think we both knew that a perfect

30:43

day is tough to plan

30:44

for so we drove back and talked to the

30:47

manager at the airport who is in

30:49

in high gear for lobbying for this

30:51

because he he wanted

30:52

an event like this to happen in little

30:54

old plains montana

30:56

and we said well maybe and i had the

31:00

idea of calling the people who owned the

31:01

holland ranch

31:02

just west of town the

31:06

so i called up daisy holland and i said

31:09

daisy

31:10

have you heard about the miss montana

31:12

project

31:13

and she said well yes i have i said

31:17

you know we need a drop zone for our

31:20

practice jump and we’d like to use your

31:22

field just west of town

31:23

i said well sure so basically

31:27

we had two 30-second conversations to

31:29

get yes so the support was there

31:31

and it was it was a really neat thing we

31:34

ended up meeting with daisy

31:36

and the manager of the airport and we

31:39

we got everything confirmed but we did

31:42

not know

31:43

what day this would end up happening so

31:45

we said we have to keep this a secret

31:48

for any of you who have ever been to a

31:50

small town the best way to promote

31:52

something

31:53

is to tell people to keep it a secret

32:00

so that was the first week in may we had

32:03

our send off gala

32:04

without the plane flying on a saturday

32:06

night and we

32:07

partied like it was gonna happen let me

32:09

tell you it was it was a really fun

32:11

event

32:12

that next sunday was mother’s day and

32:15

my mom is in the audience i’d like to

32:17

say thank you for allowing me to skip

32:19

mother’s day this year

32:21

because miss montana flew and i

32:25

got the techs at work and i took off

32:27

from work and i showed up to the airport

32:29

and for once i was happy that miss

32:31

montana hadn’t flown yet

32:33

we there was about 60 of us out there

32:36

and a lot of us were the long-term

32:39

volunteers there that that had put

32:43

some of us were working 40 hours a day

32:45

and volunteering 30 or 40 hours on top

32:47

of that and it was absolutely fun i

32:48

wouldn’t trade it for

32:50

anything and that evening

32:53

the plane took off and took its first

32:55

flight

32:56

in over 18 years and made it around the

32:59

valley of missoula

33:01

we were so excited it landed and for a

33:03

lot of us

33:04

there may not have been a dry eye and

33:07

you could blame it on the on the

33:09

springtime allergies

33:10

or maybe the cool breeze that was

33:13

blowing but i’d like to think

33:15

it was all that perseverance and

33:17

patience

33:18

and hard work and hong kong that’s love

33:28

that next day was a monday and they

33:31

still needed to get some flight time so

33:33

they took a practice flight up to

33:35

through my hometown the valley of plains

33:38

up to kalispell and back to missoula

33:39

without too much incident at least that

33:41

they’ll talk about

33:43

and that night i had driven up to planes

33:47

and we made it official we were going to

33:49

do our practice jump in planes and

33:52

i it was like christmas eve i was so

33:54

excited i could barely

33:56

sleep so i had contacted

33:59

a friend at the plain school system and

34:02

they had let the entire school

34:04

out to watch this happen and they got

34:07

onto the football field

34:08

at 8 30 and guess what we weren’t going

34:12

to show up on time

34:18

the plane had was going to fly

34:21

east to west so it flew over the entire

34:23

town

34:25

right over the school and it was also

34:27

conveniently located the flight path

34:29

right between the hospital and the

34:32

cemetery

34:33

thankfully we didn’t need to use either

34:35

one of those

34:39

the the plane was coming and and we were

34:43

able to track it on flight tracker but

34:44

the folks at the school didn’t know and

34:46

some of the kids and teachers were

34:47

getting a little impatient so they

34:48

started to walk back into the school

34:50

especially the younger ones and a friend

34:52

of mine texted me well where’s the plane

34:55

and i said i gave it a few seconds

34:56

because i knew it was probably

34:58

between quinn’s hot springs and paradise

35:00

and i said

35:01

listen and as that plane

35:05

came into the valley you can hear those

35:07

two 1200 horsepower pratt and whitney’s

35:10

and it’s a two-for-one deal

35:12

you feel it in both your heart and your

35:14

soul

35:16

and it came over town and did a loop and

35:19

came back out

35:20

and the first for the jump and the first

35:23

people

35:24

to come out of the plane were kim

35:25

maynard and amanda

35:27

holt kim happens to be one of the first

35:30

female smoke jumpers

35:31

ever and it was

35:36

damn straight

35:40

so she came out and landed and

35:43

everything went off beautifully and we

35:44

made a few more passes because

35:46

there was several jumpers involved and

35:50

by the end of it we all gathered

35:53

together and that people were actually

35:55

spread out and it took a while to get us

35:57

together

35:57

and a recently retired smoke jumper who

36:00

lived in plains

36:01

had brought vintage 1990 smoke jumper

36:04

beer for this special occasion

36:08

they say beer goes bad but boy it tasted

36:10

good at 11 o’clock in the morning

36:14

we’re the beer bottles were clanking and

36:16

we were

36:17

absolutely ecstatic that all systems

36:19

were a go for mechanically and with the

36:21

jumpers

36:22

and we came to realize right there

36:25

that we went from knowing that we could

36:28

do this

36:29

to actually proving it and miss montana

36:35

flew about 10 days later and left for

36:39

normandy

36:40

and believe it or not it left missoula

36:43

with

36:44

less than six or seven flight hours

36:47

and it made it to the east coast without

36:49

an incident and it took

36:50

the blue spruce route back to europe so

36:53

it went

36:54

connecticut maine up into canada and

36:57

newfoundland

please welcome molly bradford

40:03

six years ago i shot a doe on opening

40:06

day

40:07

just a moment before that i was leaning

40:09

into the wet sandy bank

40:11

with detailed certainty that a large

40:14

herd was going to

40:15

exit the forest and come into the field

40:18

at about sunset

40:19

i knew that there were at least three or

40:21

four monster bucks

40:23

in the herd i looked up and the sun

40:27

was about 15 minutes from setting over

40:29

the bitterroot mountains

40:30

which meant there were only 45 minutes

40:33

of hunting hours left

40:35

and my pocket vibrated

40:38

it was a text from my husband spencer

40:41

william

40:41

has been crying off and on for a couple

40:44

hours and he won’t take a bottle

40:46

how’s the hunt going

40:51

the hunt was going great until then

41:02

although my breast pump lay a couple

41:04

hundred yards away in the truck and i

41:06

was engorged under my camo

41:09

i thought to myself am i gonna call off

41:12

this hunt for the second

41:13

time today you see much earlier that

41:16

morning i had woken up before my

41:18

alarm in a state of shock wondering why

41:21

there was an

41:21

amplified baby seal barking in the next

41:24

room

41:25

but it was not a seal it was my baby my

41:28

son

41:29

he was actually struggling to breathe

41:32

and coughing with what would be his

41:34

first of nearly 20

41:36

bouts of croup i rushed to william’s

41:39

crib

41:39

and picked him up and luckily i was able

41:41

to pretty quickly stabilize his

41:43

breathing

41:44

and then the dread set in today was my

41:47

day to go

41:48

hunting it’s opening day i needed a day

41:52

off

41:52

and this hunt was a gift a friend of

41:55

mine with a farm south of hamilton had

41:57

offered me

41:58

an opening day mother’s hunt it was like

42:01

a sure thing

42:02

going to the going to go hunting for for

42:05

venison at the grocery store almost

42:08

and i thought to myself do i go on the

42:11

hunt do i cancel

42:13

is it fair to deprive myself of a day

42:16

off is it fair to leave my sick child

42:18

with my husband and daughter

42:19

do i cancel on taylor taylor and

42:22

meredith had taught me to hunt

42:24

a few years before that i primarily

42:27

hunted with other women and mothers

42:29

we had a long-standing relationship with

42:31

our produce

42:33

growing fruits and vegetables trading

42:35

them putting them up for the winter

42:36

it was a large group of women who wanted

42:39

a similar relationship with their meat

42:41

that they had with their produce so

42:44

spencer and i decided if william was

42:46

doing better

42:47

during the day and the hunt could be

42:49

postponed until the afternoon

42:51

that was a good alternative and so

42:54

here i was leaned in on the sandy bank

42:57

and i knew that the hunt was on

43:00

just a little while before i’d found my

43:02

position i had walked over

43:04

a well-trodden game trail with fresh

43:07

hoof prints in the sand

43:08

and droppings and tons of sign

43:12

of deer the hair was standing up on the

43:15

back of my neck

43:17

i was paying attention to the forest and

43:19

i knew i was in the right place

43:22

you see i take the decision to bring

43:25

life into the world

43:27

and the decision to take life from the

43:29

world pretty seriously

43:31

i had done a lot to prepare for this

43:33

hunt

43:34

sighted in my gun nearly perfectly at

43:36

100 yards

43:37

sourced local non-lead ammo i had on

43:41

camo

43:41

hunter orange a backpack a finely

43:44

sharpened

43:46

field dressing kit proper nutrition

43:49

and as i sat there thinking about all

43:52

this i realized that the forest was

43:54

quiet

43:55

the squirrels were no longer chattering

43:57

in the background giving up my position

43:59

in the forest

44:00

i could hear the wings of the raven

44:05

overhead before i even saw it reminding

44:08

me of the sound of breath

44:10

while giving birth

44:15

and then the deer appeared like they

44:18

sometimes do

44:19

a young spike buck ran out into the

44:22

field a scout

44:24

a couple fawns and does after that

44:28

a larger buck and larger does i knew

44:31

that this was not one of the trophies

44:33

but this hunt was not about antlers it

44:36

was about meat

44:37

so i sight i leaned into my gun and put

44:40

the scope

44:41

on one of the does just behind her front

44:44

leg where i knew the heart would be

44:47

and i calmed myself down so that it

44:49

wasn’t shaking before i took my shot

44:55

those deep breaths before the final push

44:58

that brings life into the world and the

45:01

pull

45:02

that takes it i shot that doe

45:05

on opening day and it was a great shot

45:08

on all accounts

45:09

i would find out later that i had shot

45:11

it through the heart

45:13

it jumped back a few yards and fell down

45:15

at the edge of the forest

45:16

the rest of the herd scattered i took my

45:19

time

45:20

calming down for a moment in that sandy

45:21

bank then i texted spencer and taylor

45:24

and the landowner to let them know what

45:25

was going on

45:27

and i approached the animal she had died

45:29

almost immediately

45:31

i slipped some grass into her mouth and

45:33

put my hand on her neck to thank her

45:34

for her sacrifice for my family and got

45:37

to work

45:38

laying out my plastic bag for the heart

45:40

to take home to eb

45:42

my field dressing kit no headlamp

45:46

it was supposed to be a morning hunt and

45:48

i’d forgotten my headlamp

45:50

and in my sleep deprived state no gloves

45:54

i had tons of baby wipes but no gloves

45:58

so i grabbed my knife with my bare hands

46:01

and started the incision down the

46:03

breastbone and through

46:04

the abdomen of the deer when i came to a

46:06

swollen

46:08

set of teats and i had to keep going

46:12

i sliced through and the milk spilled

46:14

into the incision

46:15

on my hands and my own milk spilled out

46:18

of my breasts and into my camo

46:21

taylor came up and she quickly talked me

46:24

down

46:25

off of what was about to be a bad

46:27

adrenaline trip

46:28

she starts she steadied the dough

46:32

and she studied me she told me i had to

46:35

get to work

46:35

it was getting dark quickly we had no

46:38

light and we were getting cold

46:40

i hastily and sloppily finished field

46:42

dressing the dough

46:44

i put the heart in a bag to bring home

46:48

while taylor found a stick to spread the

46:50

ribs apart

46:51

to help it cool off more quickly i

46:53

cleaned up my hands and packed my bag

46:56

we drugged the animal tired in the dark

46:59

with no light

46:59

stumbling around in the field back to

47:01

the truck convincing ourselves that

47:03

another doe would nurse that fawn

47:05

tonight

47:06

and threw it in the back of the truck

47:08

saying goodbye and thanks

47:10

to the farmer on our way out i dropped

47:13

taylor at her mom’s about halfway home

47:15

where we ran into some other friends

47:16

who’d been fishing that day

47:18

we swapped stories of success there were

47:20

high fives and cheers but i was pretty

47:22

sad they all tried to convince me again

47:25

that the fawn would be okay i got home

47:28

to a relatively quiet house

47:31

william was eager to nurse and we

47:34

drifted off into fit full sleep

47:36

the next morning eb bounded outside in

47:39

her pajamas and jumped right up into the

47:41

back of the truck with the dough

47:43

she was so excited to check it out did

47:45

you bring me the heart mama

47:47

i did we cut the back strap out of the

47:50

back of the dough to have later for

47:51

dinner and went inside

47:53

where she played with it in the sink

47:54

squeezing water in and out of the

47:56

different valves and putting her finger

47:58

through the bullet hole

47:59

that afternoon i took the dough and

48:02

william to the butcher

48:03

some years i have the bandwidth to do my

48:06

own butchering but this was not one of

48:07

those years

48:09

the butcher was so excited to see me in

48:12

fact he was about to do an interview

48:13

with the local news station about the

48:15

success of his female hunters on opening

48:17

day

48:18

as he told me his words not mine they

48:21

hunt with more finesse

48:22

and less ego he asked how my hunt had

48:26

gone

48:27

i told as i started to tell him his lead

48:30

processor came out from the back

48:32

hunched over with gnarled hands and

48:34

blood on his apron and a hollow wrinkled

48:37

face

48:38

and i told them about the fawn and the

48:40

dough and william and the milk and

48:42

i started to tear up and the hunchback

48:45

leaned over and he put his

48:47

hand on my shoulder and he said it’s

48:50

okay mama

48:51

you’ve done nothing wrong you’ve

48:53

harvested a fine

48:55

animal for your family

48:58

that fawn needed to wean so it could

49:00

survive the winter

49:02

and with that my suffering lifted

49:06

i loaded the baby into the truck and

49:08

headed home

49:10

that evening as i sat in our

49:12

hundred-year-old kitchen

49:13

nursing william watching my husband cook

49:16

fresh backstrap for dinner

49:18

and my daughter eager to help prepare

49:20

the heart for fritters

49:22

i was soothed by the rhythm

49:26

of the push and the pull thank you

49:29
