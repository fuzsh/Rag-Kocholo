        "text": "The Philippine Elections web archive documents the Philippine general elections of 2010 and 2019. In the Philippines, national elections for all positions above the barangay-level (barangay, being the smallest administrative division) take place every six years. Midterm elections occur at the three-year mark, with all seats in the House of Representatives, as well as gubernatorial, provincial, city, and municipal council seats contested. A portion of senate seats is also up for grabs during midterm elections.\n\n2010 came at the end of a six-year election cycle and saw the participation of the Liberal Party, Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban), Lakas-Kampi, National Peopleâ€™s Coalition (NPC), Bangon Pilipinas, Bagumbayan, Ang Kapatiran Party, and independents. With a crowded field of personalities and political families, the elections led to high turnout. Vote counting was eased with the introduction of automated systems, but was plagued by complaints about electronic voting and possibilities of election fraud. To document this election, the following have been included in the archive: websites of candidates, political parties and the news media captured around the time of the Philippine General Election of 2010.\n\nThe 2019 midterm elections took place in the context of a debate on federalism and were closely connected to initiatives and policies championed by President Rodrigo Duterte. Besides federalism, drugs, and extrajudicial killings were some of the main issues put before the people of the Philippines. For these elections, the collection includes human rights and NGO websites.\n\nStaff from the Library of Congress Jakarta Office and the Asian Division in Washington, D.C. selected the websites and reviewed the archived results.\n\nCollection Period:\n\nMarch 2010 to July 2010\n\nDecember 2018 to May 2019\n\nFrequency of Collection: The majority of sites in the collection were targeted for capture weekly, with fewer targeted for capture monthly."
