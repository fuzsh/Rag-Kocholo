        "text": "Elections have long granted the citizens the power to change the country's status quo. With thousands of seats to be filled up in the elections, one vote can either break or change a nation.\n\nElections take place for people to vote for executive and legislative branches of the government on a national, provincial, and local level. National elections are for putting in position a president and a vice president. National elections are also for the 12 Senate seats, 316 seats to the House of Representatives, 81 seats for governors and vice governors, and 782 seats to provincial boards in provinces. 146 seats to city mayors and vice mayors, and 1,650 seats to city councils in all cities, 1,488 municipal mayors and vice mayors, and 11,908 seats to municipal councils in all municipalities.\n\nHOW TO REGISTER\n\nPrior to registration, visit www.votepilipinas.com for everything you need to know about voter registration. You can also locate the active Office of the Election Officer (OEO) near you.\n\nDownload and fill-out the voter registration form but DO NOT sign yet. The form has to be signed in front of an election officer at the OEO.\n\nGo early to the OEO or registration center. Bring your own pen, face mask, vaccination card and valid IDs. Fall in line to your assigned queue (PWD, senior, pregnant, regular citizen) and submit your registration form.\n\nHave your biometrics captured.\n\nReceive your acknowledgement receipt and wait for your application to be approved by the Election Registration Board.\n\nHOW TO EXERCISE YOUR VOTE\n\nFind out where to vote through COMELECâ€™s Precinct Finder here.\n\nHave your temperature checked before entering the voting center.\n\nProceed to the Voters' Assistance Desk (VAD) to secure your precinct and sequence numbers and assigned room or clustered precinct.\n\nGo to your assigned room and introduce yourself to the Electoral Board by stating your name, precinct and sequence numbers.\n\nGet your ballot, ballot secrecy folder and marking pen and fill-out the ballot at the voting area.\n\nAccomplish the ballot by fully shading the oval appearing before the name of the candidate you wish to vote for. Do not overvote.\n\nFeed the ballot into the Vote Counting Machine (VCM).\n\nCheck your voter's receipt and then deposit it in the receptacle.\n\nHave your right forefinger nail stained with indelible ink.\n\nHOW TO EXERCISE YOUR VOTE IF YOU ARE PART OF THE VULNERABLE SECTOR\n\nGo to your precinct and look for the priority lane for senior citizens, PWDs, and pregnant women.\n\nPresent a valid government ID to the facilitator.\n\nWait your turn and cast your vote inside the precinct. You can bring a cheat sheet or a list of the candidates you want to vote for to make the process easier for you!\n\nOnce you're done, go to the vote counting machine and insert your ballot. For senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and illiterate voters, headphones will be provided, so you can clearly hear and follow the VCM instructions.\n\nIndelible ink will be applied to your forefinger nail as proof of voting.\n\nReview your voter's receipt and drop it into the receipt receptacle box."
