        "text": "110-1. Election Committee\n\n110-1.1 The Election Committee shall consist of three members, including the immediate Past President, who serves as Chair, and the two other most recently retired APA Presidents.\n\nIt shall be the responsibility of the Chair of the Election Committee (or his/her designee) to contact the nominees for President-elect to determine their willingness to appear on the final ballot. It shall also be the Chair's responsibility to notify the candidates for President-elect, Treasurer, Recording Secretary and Board of Directors of the election results.\n\n110-1.2\n\n110-1.2 As part of the selection process, prospective candidates for the Board of Directors, upon being slated, will be asked to identify and report to the Election Committee any instance within the last ten years in which the member:\n\n(1) has been the subject of an adjudicated finding or resolution by settlement of:\n\na) malpractice;\n\nb) unethical or unprofessional conduct resulting in a sanction by a voluntary professional organization, academic institution, state licensure board, or other governmental body; or\n\n(2) is currently the subject of a criminal indictment, civil complaint of malpractice, or formal complaint of unethical or unprofessional conduct by a voluntary professional organization, academic institution, state licensure board, or other governmental body.\n\nThe Election Committee will determine whether the prospective candidate can remain on the slate. The decision of the Election Committee can be appealed to the Board of Directors.\n\n110-2. Counting Systems\n\n110-2.1 Preferential nomination ballot. With the exception of nominations for President-elect, in any nomination specifying a preferential nominating ballot--that is, one in which there is a choice among an unlimited set of alternatives--the count shall be made by a weighted score. A number is assigned to the voter's first choice that is equal to the number of nominees to be selected, a number one less than this is assigned to the voter's second choice, and so on until the number of zero is reached or the voter's choices are exhausted. The candidate or candidates receiving the higher total weighted score are nominated.\n\n110-2.2 Preferential election ballot. In any election specifying a preferential election ballot--a ballot on which the voter is given a limited set of alternatives and chooses among them by placing them in rank order--the Ware System of the single transferable ballot shall be used in determining the result of the election. Ballots are distributed to the first unique choice on each ballot. If no candidate is elected, the one receiving the fewest choices is defeated and the ballots assigned to him or her are redistributed to the highest remaining unique choice, if any. As soon as any candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, he or she is elected. The procedure continues until one candidate has a majority or until all candidates but one are defeated. The remaining candidate is elected whether he or she has a majority or not.\n\nWhen the Hare System is used in an election for more than one vacancy, a quota is first established. A number equal to the total valid votes cast plus one is divided by one more than the number of offices to be filled. This number constitutes the quota. Counting then commences and continues as described in the preceding paragraph except that as soon as any candidate has been given a number of votes equal to the quota, he or she is declared elected. Any further ballots that would accrue to the elected candidate are distributed to the next subsequent unique choice, if any.\n\n110-2.3 President-elect nominations. In the nomination of candidates for the office of President-elect, each APA voting member may nominate up to five Members of the Association. The Election Committee shall then prepare for the final election ballot a slate including the names of up to five Members who receive the largest numbers of nominating votes provided those Members also have a minimum of thirty nominating votes. If there are not three Members who receive thirty or more nominating votes, the Election Committee shall slate the three Members who receive the largest number of nominating votes. The selection of the persons who receive the largest number of nominating votes and who are willing to serve if elected shall be determined by the use of the single transferable ballot (English System). Ballots shall be counted in the following manner: (a) ballots are sorted for first choice on each ballot; (b) the candidate(s) receiving the lowest number(s) of first place votes is declared defeated, and his or her ballots are transferred to the voter's second choice. This procedure does not use a quota. The process of declaring defeated the candidate having the lowest number of votes after each count, and of transferring their ballots to the voter's next choice of those candidates not yet defeated, continues. If there is no next choice, the ballot is declared exhausted and set aside. As each potential nominee achieves sufficient votes to be nominated, that person will be approached to ascertain willingness to serve. If a candidate is unwilling, the candidate's votes will be reallocated to the remaining nominees. (c) This process of counting continues until there are at least three candidates having the highest number of votes and who are willing to serve if elected.\n\n110-3. Ballots\n\n110-3.1 Election ballot: Biographical sketch. Whenever Council members receive a ballot listing candidates for offices or committees, a relevant biographical sketch of each nominee shall be included with the ballot.\n\n110-3.2 Election ballot: Statement of reasons. Whenever Council members are to vote for a nominee on an \"approve\" or \"disapprove\" basis, the ballot shall include a statement by the nominating board giving reasons for the nomination.\n\n110-4. Use of Mailing Labels for Campaigns\n\n110-4.1 The use of APA mailing labels to reach the electorate in support of any candidate(s) for office in any APA or divisional election is prohibited. APA will not supply labels for campaign activities for use in intra-organizational elections.\n\n110-5. Due Process, Challenges, Effective Dates, Terms\n\nFilling Vacancies\n\n110-5.1 Due process. No officer, director, or Council representative shall be prevented from participating in the activities of the body to which he or she was elected without due process, as provided by our parliamentary rules.\n\n110-5.2 Challenges of elections. Any questions relative to elections must be raised not later than the time of the election report by the Board of Directors to Council. Any question, once raised, may be deferred for subsequent determination by Council, and the person whose election has been questioned shall not take office until final approval has been voted by Council.\n\n110-5.3 Effective date. Unless otherwise specified, results of all elections are effective when Council accepts the report of election results.\n\n110-5.4 Terms of office. Unless otherwise specified, terms of office for all officers and board and committee members shall begin on January 1 of the year that follows their election to office.\n\n110-5.5 Filling vacancies (Officers). If any candidate for the office of President-elect, Recording Secretary or Treasurer withdraws or becomes ineligible before the election results are tabulated or before the start of his or her term of office, the result of the election shall be counted as if his or her name had not been on the ballot.\n\nIf a Recording Secretary or Treasurer resigns or cannot serve after his or her term has begun, he/she will be replaced as follows: 1) if more than half the term remains, there is a recount of the original ballot and the vote will be recounted as if the resigning memberâ€™s name had not been on the ballot. Based on the recount, the position shall be offered to the candidates in order of most votes received. If no candidate on the original ballot is eligible or willing to serve, the Board of Directors shall appoint a replacement to fill the vacancy; 2) if less than half the term remains, the Board of Directors shall appoint a replacement to fill the vacancy.\n\n110-5.6 Filling vacancies (Board of Directors). Seats vacated by members of the Board of Directors not serving ex officio shall be filled for the unexpired term in accordance with the preferential voting procedure in Association Rule 110-2.2. The winner shall be determined by a new count of the most recent Directors' election that redistributes to the candidates remaining on the ballot the votes of candidates not seated. Thus the determining ballots of any candidate who is seated on the Board of Directors are excluded from the recount. This procedure shall be followed in turn if any winner is ineligible or unwilling to serve.\n\n110-5.7 Filling vacancies (Board and Committee Members Elected by Council). If a candidate for any APA board or committee elected by Council withdraws or becomes ineligible before the election results are tabulated or resigns or cannot serve after election results are certified by the Elections Committee or after his or her term has begun, the vote will be recounted as if the resigning member's name had not been on the ballot. Based on the recount, the position shall be offered to the candidates in order of most votes received. If no candidate on the original ballot is eligible or willing to serve, a special election will be held if more than half the term remains, or if less than half the term remains, then the board or committee may appoint a person to fill the vacancy. In the case of appointment or special election, the board or committee shall attempt to choose an appointee or construct a slate of nominees with the same qualifications as originally sought unless the need no longer exists.\n\n110-5.8 Board and committee chairs. Unless otherwise specified, the chairs of each standing board and committee shall be elected by the group itself. Unless otherwise specified, chairs of all other boards or committees shall be chosen by the board or committee through which these committees report.\n\n110-6. Results Reported\n\n110-6.1 A tabular breakdown for both nominations and elections for Board of Directors, APA President-elect, and other contests, where possible, shall be sent on request to any member eligible to vote in the particular election. The report shall include: (a) the total number of votes cast, (b) the total number of candidates, and (c) the winning candidates and the votes each received. In addition to receiving this information, all other candidates shall also be informed of the number of votes they received.\n\n110-7. Guidelines for the Conduct of President-Elect Nominations and Elections\n\nNominations and Elections\n\n110-7.1 It is the intent of these guidelines to keep the amount of campaigning and electioneering for the office of President-elect within reasonable limits and to assist in the maintenance of a spirit of collegiality and essential fairness in such elections. These guidelines shall apply to the nomination and election process for the office of APA President-elect.\n\nA. Eligibility, Published Statements, Campaign Restrictions\n\nEligibility and appropriateness of members of the Board of Directors to stand for the APA Presidency. Members of the Board of Directors are eligible to stand for and accept nominations for the APA Presidency.\n\nEligibility and appropriateness of standing for the APA Presidency while standing for another APA office. Individuals serving in the APA Presidency cycle shall not hold offices within the Association other than the ex officio positions that accompany that office. A person elected to the APA Presidency shall, during the term of President-elect, President, and Past President, be restricted from holding any other APA office, including divisional offices, that is not an ex officio extension of the Presidential office.\n\nCall to membership of potential presidential nominees. An annual announcement on APAâ€™s website will invite presidential nominees to submit a brief statement (50 words or less) to accompany the President-Elect nomination ballot. The deadline for submission of such statements is close of business on February 15.\n\nStatement on the issues facing psychology. After the slate of candidates is announced, each one will be invited to provide a statement regarding their candidacy. The candidates' statement accompanying the election ballot should be confined to discussion of issues facing psychology and the APA and should not exceed 1,000 words. Coverage of the candidates in a question and answer format will be highlighted in issues of the APA Monitor on Psychology published between their nomination and the election, with a link to the full text on APAâ€™s website. Each board and committee reporting to Council or the Board of Directors will be invited to develop questions, which will be reviewed by the Election Committee. Taking into consideration input from the various constituencies, six (6) final questions reflecting important issues to APAâ€™s overall mission and strategic plan will be selected by the Election Committee and presented to each candidate. Their written responses will be edited for APA style by APA Monitor on Psychology editors and returned to the candidates for approval before appearing on APAâ€™s website. The answers to each question will be limited to 100 words. Each candidate will also be given the opportunity to write a short statement, not to exceed 300 words, as a lead into their questions and answers. The past president, as chair of the Election Committee, is responsible for enforcing these limitations.\n\nAppropriateness of a member of the Board of Directors endorsing a particular candidate. Since the Board of Directors is the executive committee of the Association as a whole, it should be viewed as being nonpartisan, and, as a matter of protocol, Board members should not endorse candidates for the office of President-elect.\n\nReporting of Campaign Funds. APA Presidential Candidates are required to report any financial support greater than $200 that they received while seeking nomination or election from August 1 of the preceding year of the election through two weeks prior to the start of the president-elect election balloting period. Financial support includes direct money payments, in kind services, advertising on behalf of the candidate, etc. Cash contributions to candidates must be documented with the source of the contribution. This will include support from any individual, group, organization, society, APA Division, State Association, or caucus of APA Council. Any honorarium and expenses for travel to present or speak to a group specifically regarding the candidateâ€™s nomination or election also must be reported. If there is a question about whether financial support is reportable, it should be reported.\n\nCandidates will report all contribution sources and amounts on a form approved by the Election Committee. Candidates must sign verifying that the report is complete and submit it to the APA Election Office no later than September 1. Candidates may not accept contributions after this date. The data will be made available to the membership on the APA Election website.\n\nSelling or providing APA mailing labels and email address lists. APA will not sell or provide mailing labels or email address lists for campaign purposes.\n\nUse of listservs (electronic lists). APA Central Office will not establish or provide listservs or other electronic communities for campaign purposes. However, list members may discuss APA elections and APA candidates on established lists to which they subscribe.\n\nB. Statement of Compliance with Guidelines\n\nAfter the Election Committee announces the candidates, each one will receive a copy of these guidelines. Each candidate must agree to and sign a statement acknowledging that he or she has received the guidelines, pledge to adhere to them, and will report to the Election Committee immediately any deviations from the guidelines of which he or she becomes aware.\n\nC. Promulgation of These Guidelines\n\nThe guidelines in their entirety shall appear on APAâ€™s website.\n\nD. Compliance\n\nMember complaints regarding violations of these guidelines will be addressed by the Election Committee. Upon receipt of a complaint, the Election Committee will provide the candidate with notice and an opportunity to respond to the allegations and/or to correct his or her report regarding campaign funds required by 110-7.1. A6. Recognizing that the goal of reporting requirements is to achieve transparency for the benefit of the voters, based on information it receives regarding a complaint, the Election Committee may also modify the APA election website to supplement or correct any information about candidate financial support.\n\n110-8. President-Elect Election\n\n110-8.1 The election of APA President-elect is conducted by the Election Committee. Association Rule 110-1.2 provides additional requirements regarding the selection process.\n\n110-8.2 Candidates are nominated by Fellows, Members, Associate members with voting privileges, and Graduate Student members with voting privilege. Nominations are made by preferential ballots, and up to five names may be listed in rank order. Nomination ballots are sent on or about March 1. The balloting period closes within 45 days. Only APA members are eligible for nomination.\n\n110-8.3 The APA President elect shall be elected by Fellows, Members, and those Associate members and Graduate Student members who have been granted voting privileges. The election ballot shall be preferential and shall list the names of up to five Members who receive the largest numbers of nominating votes provided those Members also have a minimum of thirty nominating votes. If there are not three Members who receive thirty or more nominating votes, the Election Committee shall slate the three Members who receive the largest number of nominating votes. Final election ballots shall be sent on or about August 1. The balloting period shall close within 45 days.\n\nEach candidate is invited to submit a statement, to be sent with the election ballot, of no more than 1,000 words, stating his or her opinion of issues facing psychology and of the role APA should play regarding these issues.\n\n110-8.4 Results are reported to the Board of Directors. Tallied results are reported to Council no more than 30 days after the ballot closes. Election results are published on APAâ€™s website.\n\n110-9. Recording Secretary and Treasurer Election\n\n110-9.1 Nominations are solicited from the voting Members of the Association. The slate is determined by the Board of Directors. There shall be at least two nominees on the final election ballot for Recording Secretary and Treasurer. Only APA members are eligible for nomination.

Preferential ballots are used.\n\n110-9.3 Results, with the final tally of votes cast, are reported to Council within 30 days.\n\n110-10. Chief Staff Officer Confirmation\n\n110-10.1 The Board of Directors shall appoint a search committee to identify candidates for the position of chief staff officer. After the search committee has identified a list of preferred candidates for the position, the committee shall forward the list of candidates to the Board of Directors. After the Board of Directors has completed its deliberations on the candidates and has selected the nominee for the position, the Board shall forward the nomination to the Council of Representatives for a confirmation vote.\n\n110-10.2 Confirmation requires a two-thirds affirmative vote of those voting. Those eligible to vote will be members of the current Council of Representatives.\n\n110-10.3 There is a minimum seven-day electronic balloting period for the confirmation vote. Results of the vote, with a tally of votes cast, shall be reported to Council by the Recording Secretary within two weeks following the close of balloting.\n\nThis section shall be reviewed by Council at three-year intervals beginning the first meeting of Council in 2023.\n\n110-10.4 110-10.4 There is a 30-day balloting period for the confirmation vote. Results of the vote, with a tally of votes cast, shall be reported to Council by the Recording Secretary within 30 days following the close of balloting.\n\n110-11. Chief Staff Officer Evaluation\n\n110-11.1 The performance of the chief staff officer shall be subject to an annual review. The Board of Directors is charged with the development of procedures and instruments designed for that purpose. Upon completing its evaluation of the chief staff officer's performance, the Board will communicate the results to Council in confidence.\n\nThis section shall be reviewed by Council at three-year intervals beginning the first meeting of Council in 2023.\n\n110-12. Chief Staff Officer Reconfirmation\n\n110-12.1 At such time as the chief staff officer is subject to reconfirmation, the evaluation form used for the evaluation described in Association Rule 110-11 shall address the chief staff officer's performance specifically in terms of his/her reconfirmation.\n\n110-12.2 Reconfirmation of the Chief Staff Officer requires a two-thirds affirmative vote of the Board of Directors. Those eligible to vote for reconfirmation shall be the current Board of Directors.\n\nThis section shall be reviewed by Council at three-year intervals beginning the first meeting of Council in 2023.\n\n110-12.3 The Recording Secretary will announce the results to Council within two weeks following the close of balloting. This section shall be reviewed by Council at three-year intervals beginning the first meeting of Council in 2023.\n\n110-12.4 There is a minimum seven- day balloting for the confirmation vote. Results of the vote, with a tally of votes cast, shall be reported to Council within two weeks following the close of balloting.\n\nThis section shall be reviewed by Council at three-year intervals beginning the first meeting of Council in 2023.\n\n110-13. Election of the members-at-large of the Board of Directors\n\n110-13.1 The Needs Assessment, Slating and Campaigns Committee (NASCC) conducts a comprehensive needs assessment and develops position descriptions based on the needs assessment for the open Board member-at-large seats. The descriptions are broadly disseminated to the membership when nominations are solicited. In the slating process, NASCC aims to maintain a Board balanced across areas of the discipline, diversity broadly defined and special skills or competencies relevant to current issues.\n\nMembers-at-large are elected by and from the voting Members of the Association. Slates of at least two candidates are developed by NASCC from the nominations received, and at least two alternates shall be identified from the nominees. In the slating process, NASCC will ensure there is always at least one early career psychologist member on the Board of Directors. Association Rule 110-1.2 provides additional requirements regarding the selection process.\n\nSlates of recommended candidates and alternates shall be submitted to the Board of Directors for review of 1) unrecognized conflicts of interest and 2) consistency with the results of NASCCâ€™s annual needs assessment. If, by majority vote of the Board, a candidate is unacceptable for one of these reasons, or if a candidate(s) has dropped out after NASCC slating, the Board will vote on a recommended substitution from the alternates. The Board will inform NASCC of any recommended substitutions and the reasons for its recommendation. NASCC will consider the Boardâ€™s review and feedback, and, by majority vote, determine the final composition of candidate slates, which shall not include any candidates excluded by the Election Committee pursuant to Association Rule 110-1.2.\n\n110-13.2 The election of the members-at-large on the Board of Directors is conducted by an independent audit firm. The election ballot is a preferential ballot.\n\nNASCC helps the Election Committee set limitations and criteria on campaigning and monitors adherence. It is also responsible for disseminating information about each candidate to the membership electronically and with the ballot.\n\n110-13.3 Results, with the final tally of votes cast, are reported to the membership within 30 days.\n\n110-13.4 NASCC will conduct a needs assessment and develop a slate of at least two candidates for the Public Member of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will select a candidate from the slate submitted by NASCC. If needed, the Board may request additional candidates from NASCC. The Public Member shall serve a three-year term. Association Rule 110-1.2 provides additional requirements regarding the selection process.\n\n110-13.5 The Chair and Chair-elect of Councilâ€™s Leadership Team serve as ex-officio members of the Board of Directors.\n\n110-14. Rules Governing Simultaneous Service\n\n110-14.1 It is the goal of this section that members not serve simultaneously on the Board of Directors at the same time as another elected or appointed APA position, and also that members not serve for more than one advisory group except as ex-officio, non-voting, and/or with certain other minor exceptions noted. To that end, sections 110-14.2, 110-14.3 and 110-14.5 identify specific groups as to which simultaneous service is prohibited and set forth qualifications for participation in election or appointment to the Board of Directors and advisory groups when a member is currently serving or has been elected or appointed to serve on another advisory group.\n\n110-14.2 Members of the Board of Directors shall serve simultaneously on the Board of Directors of the American Psychological Association Services, Inc., but not serve simultaneously on APA advisory groups, other than as ex-officio or liaison; in any elected positions in any Divisions or state/provincial/territorial psychological associations; or on governing bodies of other advocacy or political action organizations for psychologists or psychology that are national in scope.\n\n110-14.3 Members shall not serve simultaneously on any of the following advisory groups, except as ex-officio and/or non-voting members or if other exceptions are provided below.\n\nBoards\n\nAdvancement of Psychology in the Public Interest\n\nConvention Affairs\n\nEducational Affairs\n\nMembership\n\nPolicy and Planning\n\nPublications and Communications\n\nProfessional Affairs (except that one member is also a member of the Committee on Professional Practice and Standards)\n\nScientific Affairs\n\nCommittees\n\nAdvancement of General Applied Psychology\n\nAging\n\nAnimal Research and Ethics\n\nAssociate and Baccalaureate Education\n\nChildren, Youth and Families\n\nContinuing Education\n\nCouncil Leadership Team\n\nDisability Issues in Psychology\n\nDivision/APA Relations\n\nEarly Career Psychologists\n\nEthics\n\nEthnic Minority Affairs\n\nFellows\n\nFinance\n\nGlobal Psychology\n\nHealth Equity (ad hoc)\n\nHuman Research\n\nNeeds Assessment, Slating and Campaigns\n\nProfessional Practice and Standards (except that one member is also a member of the Board of Professional Affairs)\n\nRural Health\n\nSexual Orientation and Gender Diversity\n\nSocioeconomic Status\n\nPsychological Tests and Assessment\n\nTeachers of Psychology in Secondary Schools\n\nWomen in Psychology\n\nCommissions\n\nCommission for the Recognition of Specialties and Subspecialties in Professional Psychology\n\nCommission on Accreditation\n\n110-14.4 Members shall not run for election in the same calendar year for more than one of the following positions: President-Elect, Recording Secretary, Treasurer, member-at-large of the Board of Directors, Council Leadership Team Chair-Elect, Early Career Representative of the Council Leadership Team, member-at-large of the Council Leadership Team.\n\n110-14.5 Members shall not 1) simultaneously run for election (i.e., appear on an election ballot that is open for voting) for the Board of Directors and for any of the following advisory groups; 2) run for election for one of the following advisory groups if the term of service will begin prior to the end of a term the member is currently serving or has been elected or appointed to serve on one of the advisory groups listed in Association Rule 110-14.3.; 3) be appointed to one of the advisory groups listed in Association Rule 110-4.3 if service will begin prior to the end of a term the member is currently or has been elected or appointed to serve on one of these groups.\n\nBoards\n\nAdvancement of Psychology in the Public Interest\n\nConvention Affairs\n\nEducational Affairs\n\nMembership\n\nPolicy and Planning\n\nPublications and Communications\n\nProfessional Affairs\n\nScientific Affairs\n\nCommittees\n\nAdvancement of General Applied Psychology\n\nCouncil Leadership Team\n\nEthics\n\nFinance\n\nGlobal Psychology\n\nRural Health\n\nCommissions\n\nCommission for the Recognition of Specialties and Subspecialties in Professional Psychology"
