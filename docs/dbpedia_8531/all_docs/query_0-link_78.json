        "text": "Voting\n\nVoting in a local government election is not compulsory in Western Australia. However, all local electors are strongly encouraged to vote.\n\nAll eligible electors must enrol to vote. When you enrol to vote, you are enrolled for Commonwealth, State and local government elections. You can check your enrolment online.\n\nAll residents in a local government district who are enrolled on the State Electoral Roll are automatically enrolled on the corresponding local government roll.\n\nPeople who own or occupy property within a local government district, who meet the requirements of the Local Government Act 1995 and regulations can apply to their local government to be included on the roll as an owner/occupier, as long as they are eligible electors. A body corporate may apply to have up to two eligible electors to be included on the owner/occupier roll to vote on its behalf.\n\nAll eligible electors are allowed to vote once in any district or ward where they are enrolled. If a person lives within one local district or ward, and owns or occupies property in a different district or ward, they may be entitled to a vote in both areas, provided they are enrolled for both. For more information or to enrol as an owner/occupier, contact your local government.\n\nIn-person and postal voting\n\nWhere an in-person election is held, electors may apply for a postal vote, absentee vote or an early vote if they are not able to go to a polling booth on election day.\n\nReturning officers\n\nThe conduct of each local election is managed by a returning officer.\n\nThe Electoral Commissioner appoints returning officers for postal elections and in-person elections conducted by the WAEC. A list of these returning officers is available on the WAEC website.\n\nIf the local government decides to conduct the election, the chief executive officer of the local government is the returning officer, unless the local government decides to appoint another person to perform the function.\n\nFor these elections, please contact the relevant local government for more information.\n\nExtraordinary elections\n\nThe office of a member of council as an elected mayor or president, or as a councillor, becomes vacant in certain circumstances as listed in the Act.\n\nFollowing the 2023 election where optional preferential voting (OPV) is used, backfilling options will now apply to those candidates elected under the new Schedule 4.1 or Schedule 4.1A. Therefore a future vacancy may be filled by the first and second unelected candidates under Schedule 4.1A for the next 12-month period in lieu of holding an extraordinary election.\n\nThe first and second unelected candidates are the unsuccessful candidates who would have been next placed in the order of votes received. In the event that a position becomes available within 12 months of the current election, the first unelected candidate in the election for that position will be asked to complete the term of office. If they decline, the second unelected candidate will be asked to complete the term of office. If both candidates decline, an extraordinary election will be required to be held at a later date.\n\nActions are directly related to the time a resignation has been received, as there are options to either backfill (as mentioned above); apply to leave the vacancy unfilled in certain circumstances or to hold an extraordinary election in order to fill the vacancy.\n\nOther elections\n\nThe Act provides for elections to be held in certain circumstances, such as:\n\na restructure of districts or wards\n\nthe reinstatement of a council following suspension\n\nall offices become vacant\n\na council is dismissed.\n\nPublic notices\n\nPublic notice of local government elections are published in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The notices provide details about enrolling to vote, nominating to be a candidate in the elections, the ways in which a vote can be cast and the date of the election.\n\nReturning Officer Manual\n\nLocal government elections are an important means by which council members are held accountable for their performance as community representatives. Local governments play a key role in supporting the integrity of the election process.\n\nElections must be conducted to the highest standards of fairness and propriety to maintain public confidence in the democratic process. It is the returning officerâ€™s responsibility to ensure those standards are achieved.\n\nThe Returning Officer Manual is an important resource for returning officers.\n\nSchedule 2.3 Election Sheet\n\nThe direct election by the council of its mayor or president and of the deputy mayor or deputy president in all local governments is an important process. It is noted that only some class 3 and 4 local governments have a direct election of the mayor or president, with other local government conducting this as a vote of electors.\n\nThe DLGSC has prepared the Schedule 2.3 Election sheet to assist local governments in conducting elections in accordance with Schedule 2.3 of the Local Government Act 1995. This spreadsheet can also be used for the election of the presiding member and deputy presiding member of a committee of the council.\n\nThe spreadsheet can be used to assist in completing the distributions of preferences in the election in accordance with the requirements under the Local Government (Constitution) Regulations 1998."
