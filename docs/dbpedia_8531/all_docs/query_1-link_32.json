        "text": "The tandem of Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr. and Sara Duterte won the highest share of votes in the Philippine national elections, which took place on May 9, 2022. Winning by a landslide, Marcos, Jr. received nearly 59 percent of the votes, 31 percent higher than the vote share generated by his closest competitor, incumbent Vice President Leni Robredo. Meanwhile, Sara Duterte won over 61 percent of the votes for the vice-presidential race, far higher than the votes of her closest competitor Sen. Francis Pangilinan.\n\nThe continuation of the legacy of two families\n\nBongbong Marcos is the eldest son of former president Ferdinand Marcos, whose 20-year rule was toppled by a people power revolution. He initially ran for the vice presidency in the 2016 national elections, in which he lost to former vice president and close competitor Leni Robredo. Before running for national office, he served several terms as representative of the second congressional district of Ilocos Norte, his family’s origin. His most popular platform was lowering the current retail price of rice to 20 Philippine pesos per kilo. He will also temporarily head the Department of Agriculture.\n\nOn the other hand, the vice-president-elect Sara Zimmerman Duterte-Carpio is the daughter of former president Rodrigo Roa Duterte, whose term was marked with human rights violations due to his anti-drug campaign. Commonly known as Inday Sara, Duterte had been a long-time serving mayor and previously the vice mayor of Davao City after succeeding her father. She also became the youngest and the first female mayor of the city. The vice president will also serve as the Department of Education secretary during her term.\n\nThe Marcos administration will take over several economic downturns from the Duterte administration, including recoveries from the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. His presidency will also continue the “Build Build Build’ program and other projects in line to address the ballooning public debt, inflation, and rising unemployment.\n\nThe Filipino electoral system - explained\n\nEvery six years, Filipinos head to the polls to elect a new government. National elections will bring to power a new president, vice president, 12 new senators, 300 lower house legislators, and roughly 18 thousand officials such as mayors, governors, and their deputies. Registered voters must select one candidate from every position, regardless of their political parties. The president, vice president, and senators will serve six years while the other winners serve three-year terms. For the millions of Filipinos who are currently living or working abroad, they can also register to vote and send their votes to their respective precincts or embassies.\n\nAmid the surge of COVID-19 infections, the number of registered voters for the 2022 elections exceeded that of the 2019 elections. Consequently, the national voter turnout in 2022 reached over 80 percent, with the cities of Quezon and Manila being the most vote-rich cities nationwide."
