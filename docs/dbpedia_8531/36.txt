MANILA -- Philippine voters elect a new president on May 9, with four leading candidates, including Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the eldest son of the country's former dictator, vying to become the Philippines' next leader.

The country holds direct presidential elections every six years. With the constitution limiting presidents to a single term, the incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte, cannot run again -- although he still enjoys high approval ratings. Filipinos will choose their next president from among 10 potential successors.
