        "text": "Visitors who enter Luiten Food's premises get the feeling that it has only just been set up; it looks brand new. The middle part was completed in 2016 (and is apparently being polished and rubbed so well that it continues to look new) while the left building (which is attached to it) was officially put into use only three months ago. It is clear: Luiten Food is in a phase of stormy growth.\n\nBIG BY GAME\n\nLuiten is an importer and exporter of quality meat and nowadays also fish. Beef and lamb from 'Down Under', Spanish pork and French poultry are supplied to the wholesale, processing industry, retail and - yes, it is true - cruise ships. And last but not least: game! Because game, that's the family business, now run by the third generation: Lennert Luiten, who grew up with it. What is the core value of the company?\n\nDISTINCTIVE POWER\n\nLuiten Food is all about reliability. Lennert Luiten says: \"Our distinctiveness is everything in our control, from import to consumer packaging. In addition, we are able to participate at the highest level in certification, labelling, packaging and IT matters such as EDI and F-trace. The rule is: a deal is a deal in all areas\". Another important success factor according to Luiten is the flexible and flat organization. \"In contrast to large, bulky companies, we can introduce products much faster.\"\n\nREADING AND WRITING\n\nPiet van Rijn junior works at Luiten since 2013. After having worked at Interchicken for a number of years, he was asked to set up the retail department within Luiten, a department that produces for supermarkets at home and abroad. How do you set up the retail floor to serve these supermarkets so effectively? Well, one of the first things he did was looking if he could add ESPERA equipment to the machinery. Piet: \"At Interchicken there were four ESPERA machines and I could read and write with them. Much more user-friendly than other brands.\"\n\nEXTRA CARE FOR NEW CUSTOMERS\n\nPiet got the green light for it at Luiten Food. The enthusiasm for the new line was so great that two months later another line was bought. Van Rijn: \"We didn't expect that the demand for two-star poultry would grow so fast. But ESPERA's machines are plug-and-play. Once it's set up properly, it can handle anything.\" Koen Brands, Van Rijns technical contact at ESPERA, explains how this works. \"We always give extra care to new customers. Four people can come to our location in Eindhoven for training to learn how to operate the machine. And that also applies to technicians who do the maintenance\". Koen laughs: \"But that's not necessary here, because Piet does all that himself. And if he can't figure it out, he just calls our help-desk.\"\n\nROAD CARDBOARD SLEEVES\n\nWith the rapidly growing demand from retail, Luiten Food needed a line that could label pre-packed meat easier and faster. Traditionally, cardboard sleeves were applied over a skin pack with a top seal. One or more labels with up-to-date information (origin, weight, also incorporated in the barcode) were then applied separately. This took a lot of manpower and it was not fast enough. Moreover, supermarkets are actively looking for packaging with less material due to ecological aspects.\n\nUP-TO-DATE INFORMATION\n\nIt was Piet van Rijn himself (the 'Gyro Gearloose of Luiten'), who envisioned a line where a skin pack (without topseal!) would be weighed on the conveyor belt and would automatically receive a wrapping label with the actual information on it. Can that be done?', he asked Brands. Well, ESPERA was happy to take on that challenge, and it resulted in the very first line in the Netherlands that was able to do so. To achieve that, ESPERA integrated a NOBAC 500 (from the British company Ravenwood) behind an ESPERA ES7011 at Luiten Food. As a result, approximately 60 packages per minute are now provided with a label containing up-to-date information.\n\nwww.espera.com\n\nwww.luitenfood.com"
