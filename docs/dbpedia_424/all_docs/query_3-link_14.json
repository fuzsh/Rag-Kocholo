        "text": "1. An overview of data protection\n\nGeneral\n\nThe following gives a simple overview of what happens to your personal information when you visit our website. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in our privacy policy found below.\n\nData collection on our website\n\nWho is responsible for the data collection on this website?\n\nThe data collected on this website are processed by the website operator. The operator's contact details can be found in the website's required legal notice.\n\nHow do we collect your data?\n\nSome data are collected when you provide it to us. This could, for example, be data you enter on a contact form.\n\nOther data are collected automatically by our IT systems when you visit the website. These data are primarily technical data such as the browser and operating system you are using or when you accessed the page. These data are collected automatically as soon as you enter our website.\n\nWhat do we use your data for?\n\nPart of the data is collected to ensure the proper functioning of the website. Other data can be used to analyze how visitors use the site.\n\nWhat rights do you have regarding your data?\n\nYou always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge. You also have the right to request that it be corrected, blocked, or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in the legal notice if you have further questions about the issue of privacy and data protection. You may also, of course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.\n\n2. General information and mandatory information\n\nData protection\n\nThe operators of this website take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.\n\nIf you use this website, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.\n\nPlease note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches. Complete protection of your data from third-party access is not possible.\n\nNotice concerning the party responsible for this website\n\nThe party responsible for processing data on this website is:\n\nESPERA-WERKE GMBH\n\nMoltkestraße 17–33, 47058 Duisburg\n\nTelephone: +49-203-3054-0\n\nE-Mail: info@espera.com\n\nThe responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (names, email addresses, etc.).\n\nRevocation of your consent to the processing of your data\n\nMany data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.\n\nRight to file complaints with regulatory authorities\n\nIf there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the German state in which our company is headquartered. A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following link: https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html.\n\nRight to data portability\n\nYou have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.\n\nSSL or TLS encryption\n\nThis site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from \"http://\" to \"https://\" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.\n\nIf SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.\n\nGoogle reCaptcha\n\nWe use \"Google reCAPTCHA\" (hereinafter \"reCAPTCHA\") on our websites. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\"Google\").\n\nThe purpose of reCAPTCHA is to check whether the data input on our websites (e.g. in a contact form) is done by a human being or by an automated program. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyses the behaviour of the website visitor on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis begins automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For analysis purposes, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, time spent on the website or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google.\n\nThe reCAPTCHA analyses run completely in the background. Website visitors are not informed that an analysis is taking place.\n\nData processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting his web offers from abusive automated spying and from SPAM.\n\nFor further information on Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy, please refer to the following links: www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version).\n\nInformation, blocking, deletion\n\nAs permitted by law, you have the right to be provided at any time with information free of charge about any of your personal data that is stored as well as its origin, the recipient and the purpose for which it has been processed. You also have the right to have this data corrected, blocked or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in our legal notice if you have further questions on the topic of personal data.\n\n3. Data protection officer\n\nStatutory data protection officer\n\nWe have appointed Mprotect365 GmbH as data protection office for our company.\n\n4. Data collection on our website\n\nCookies\n\nSome of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.\n\nMost of the cookies we use are so-called \"session cookies.\" They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.\n\nYou can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.\n\nCookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.\n\nServer log files\n\nThe website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in \"server log files\". These are:\n\n• Browser type and browser version\n\n• Operating system used\n\n• Referrer URL\n\n• Host name of the accessing computer\n\n• Time of the server request\n\n• IP address\n\nThese data will not be combined with data from other sources.\n\nThe basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.\n\nContact form\n\nShould you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without your permission.\n\nWe will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.\n\nWe will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.\n\nNewsletter\n\nYour data\n\nThe newsletter is sent out based on the user's registration on the website or by e-mail. On our website there is the possibility to subscribe to a free newsletter. For this purpose, the user's e-mail address, first name and surname are required when registering for the newsletter.\n\nFor the processing of the data, your consent will be obtained during the registration process and reference will be made to this privacy policy. In connection with the data processing for the dispatch of newsletters, the data will not be passed on to third parties. The data will be used exclusively for sending the newsletter.\n\nLegal basis for data processing\n\nThe newsletter is sent out based on the user's registration on the website. The legal basis for the processing of data after registration for the newsletter by the user is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO, if the user has given his consent.\n\nPurpose of data processing\n\nThe collection of the user's e-mail address is used to send the newsletter. The collection of other personal data during the registration process serves to prevent misuse of the services or the e-mail address used.\n\nDuration of storage\n\nThe data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected. The user's e-mail address is therefore stored for as long as the subscription to the newsletter is active.\n\nPossibility of objection and removal\n\nThe subscription to the newsletter can be cancelled by the user concerned at any time. For this purpose there is a corresponding link in every newsletter.\n\n5. Plugins and tools\n\nYouTube\n\nOur website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.\n\nIf you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited.\n\nIf you're logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.\n\nYouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.\n\nFurther information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of YouTube under https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.\n\nGoogle Web Fonts\n\nFor uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly.\n\nFor this purpose your browser has to establish a direct connection to Google servers. Google thus becomes aware that our web page was accessed via your IP address. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.\n\nIf your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.\n\nFurther information about handling user data, can be found at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq and in Google's privacy policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nThis site uses the Google Maps map service via an API. It is operated by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4 Ireland.\n\nTo use Google Maps, it is necessary to save your IP address. This information is generally transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The provider of this site has no influence on this data transfer.\n\nThe use of Google Maps is in the interest of making our website appealing and to facilitate the location of places specified by us on the website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.\n\nFurther information about handling user data, can be found in the data protection declaration of Google at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/.\n\nMatomo (formerly Piwik)\n\nOur website uses the web analysis service Matomo. Matomo is an Open Source solution.\n\nMatomo uses \"cookies\". These are small text files, which your web browser stores on your terminal device and which allow an analysis of the website usage. Cookie-generated information about the use of our website is stored on our server. Your IP address is anonymised before it is stored.\n\nMatomo cookies remain on your terminal until you delete them.\n\nMatomo cookies are set on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. As the operator of this website, we have a legitimate interest in the anonymous analysis of user behaviour in order to optimise both our website and, if necessary, advertising.\n\nThe information stored in the Matomo cookie about the use of this website is not passed on. The setting of cookies by your web browser can be prevented. However, some functions of our website may be restricted as a result.\n\nYou can deactivate the storage and use of your data here. Your browser uses an opt-out cookie, which prevents the storage of Matomo usage data. If you delete your cookies, the Matomo opt-out cookie will also be removed. When you visit our website again, the opt-out cookie must be set again to prevent the storage and use of your data.\n\nFacebook\n\nOn our pages are plugins of the social network Facebook, 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA integrated. You can recognize the Facebook plugins by the Facebook logo or the \"Like\" button on our page. You can find an overview of the Facebook plugins here: developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/ When you visit our pages, the plugin establishes a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server. Facebook receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the Facebook \"Like\" button while logged into your Facebook account, you can link the content of our pages to your Facebook profile. This allows Facebook to associate visiting our pages with your user account. We would like to point out that, as the provider of the pages, we do not have any knowledge of the content of the data transmitted or its use by Facebook. Further information on this can be found in facebook's privacy policy at de-de.facebook.com/policy.php\n\nIf you do not want Facebook to be able to assign visits to our pages to your Facebook user account, please log out of your Facebook user account."
