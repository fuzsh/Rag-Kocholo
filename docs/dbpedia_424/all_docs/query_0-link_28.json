If you feel a question marked 'easy' should actually be marked 'pro', and if you have earned more than 20 KudoZ points, you can click the \"Vote PRO\" button to recommend that change.\n\nHow to tell the difference between \"easy\" and \"pro\" questions:\n\nAn easy question is one that any bilingual person would be able to answer correctly. (Or in the case of monolingual questions, an easy question is one that any native speaker of the language would be able to answer correctly.)\n\nA pro question is anything else... in other words, any question that requires knowledge or skills that are specialized (even slightly).\n\nAnother way to think of the difficulty levels is this: an easy question is one that deals with everyday conversation. A pro question is anything else.\n\nWhen deciding between easy and pro, err on the side of pro. Most questions will be pro.\n\n* Note: non-member askers are not given the option of entering 'pro' questions; the only way for their questions to be classified as 'pro' is for a ProZ.com member or members to re-classify it."
