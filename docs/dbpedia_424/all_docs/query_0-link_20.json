        "text": "Hola a todos.\n\nCould somebody please help me understand the difference between an imperative with a pronoun at the end, and just an imperative with no pronoun after?\n\nI know posts in this forum require a sentence to give context but in this caso I am just asking about the general gramatical rule, as it is something I have been unsure about for a while.\n\nSo what would be the difference between saying Espera and Esperate, or Ven aquí and Vente aquí. How does this same rule work with ir as well? Is it always Véte?\n\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nThe \"-te\" at the end doesn't add real meaning in this case, it is called \"dativo ético\" and it is used for emphasis and usually to denote affectionate involvement. It is a very idiomatic feature of the Spanish language, hard to master and to explain except by usage.\n\nSo what would be the difference between saying Espera and Esperate, or Ven aquí and Vente aquí. How does this same rule work with ir as well? Is it always Véte?\n\nHere you are mixing concepts.\n\n\"Vente aquí\" is dativo ético (of the imperative of the verb \"venir\")\n\n\"Vete\" (no tilde, please), is the imperative not of \"venir\" but from \"irse\", thereofore the final -te is part of the verb, there is no \"dativo ético\" there.\n\nIn general, you could say that pronouns in Spanish are sometimes used as emphasizers, just to add an extra oomph to the expression.\n\nBoth the 'pronombres de interés', and the 'dativo ético' (explained above) are cases of such use.\n\nYour examples with 'espérate' (with the alternating use of 'espera' and 'espérate', is one of those cases - the 'te' pronoun there is emphatic.\n\nThere is a standard verb 'esperar', that means just 'to wait'.\n\nAnd then there is 'esperarSE', the emphatic variant of 'esperar', that is used to express the same idea, but with a more emphatic tone; with a stronger sense of impatience, urgency, annoyance, etc.\n\nThis would be translated as 'You wait!' (an emphatic imperative), or some other similar one.\n\nThe emphatic uses of the pronouns are sometimes marked with an exclamative tone, so that is one feature that may help you identify them.\n\nIn spoken speech, they are said as exclamatives, pronounced emphatically and with a stronger accent. And in writing, they are identified by the use of exclamation marks. For example;\n\n'Si esperas por mí a la salida del trabajo, puedo llevarte a casa en mi coche.'\n\n'¡Espérate, que tengo que hablar contigo antes de que te vayas!'\n\nAlso, you may have noticed that the emphatic use is often associated with an immediate situation, that needs urgent action, so they are also often expressed as imperatives, while the non-emphatic use is more general (in these examples, a conditional).\n\n'Ven / vente' (from the verb 'venir') is another case similar to this one, of an alternation in the use of the verb, without and with an emphatic pronoun.\n\nThe case of 've / vete' (from the verb 'ir / irse') is a bit different, but very similar (and easily confused, no doubt!), in that it is also often employed as an emphatic usage. For example;\n\n'Me voy del trabajo a las 6. Si quieres que te lleve, llámame.'\n\n'¡Me voy! ¡Estoy harta de esperar...! ¡Llevo media hora esperando, y todavía no has llegado...!'\n\nThe similar case of 'ir / irse' was discussed here in a thread just a few days ago. Here is the link to it;\n\nTengo que ir/irme\n\nThere are many reasons which may cause a verb to require/allow a pronoun after it. It depends. It can be a direct or an indirect object (including the already mentioned \"dativo ético\" for some of your examples), it can be an impersonal structure, a kind of passive voice called \"pasiva refleja\", or what we call \"pronominal verbs\", whose characteristic is to have a pronoun as a part of the verb itself. These ones are indicated as \"prnl.\" in most dictionaries; many verbs allow a pronominal and a not pronominal form for the same meaning, while some others can have a different meaning depending on it. For instance \"ir\" means \"to go\" (to some place), while \"irse\" means \"to leave\" (from some place): ve ya a trabajar / vete ya del trabajo. But this is just one case, there's too much grammar here for being explained with a few rules."
