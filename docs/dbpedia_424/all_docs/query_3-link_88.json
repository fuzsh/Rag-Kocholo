        "text": "I was fortunate enough to be credentialed for this years Fantastic Fest! I will be attending remotely and, as is my usual modus operandi, trying to review films I think are less likely to get attention or that I won’t have a chance to see again. First up is F. Javier Guterriez’ The Wait / La Espera (Spain, 2023).\n\n~~~\n\nThe Wait / La Espera is a well-crafted Neo-Western/ folk horror-ish film that does not quite make it for me. In early 1970s Spain, Eladio (Victor Clavijo) moves his family to rural Andalusia to take up a post managing the hunting on the estate of local rural gentleman, Don Francisco (Manuel Morón). There is tension between Eladio and his wife Marcia (Ruth Díaz), but most of it is unspoken. The film makes all the use it can of the desert setting. The golden landscape fills the screen as Eladio teaches his Floren (Moisés Ruiz) to shoot a rifle, though Floren says he prefers the city and wants to be a veterinarian. And we see the smaller details of the land, too, ants crawling on a tomato torn open by birds, clothespins littering the rocky ground, dire remains in a pot of beans. As in other Westerns shot in Spain, characters’ expressions fill the screen, landscapes of resentment, grief, innocence, or indifferent malignancy. The visual story telling is excellent and assured, but sometimes a film needs to tell as well as show and I needed The Wait to do some telling when the folk horror and rural witchcraft elements begin to crop up on Don Francisco’s property and Eladio’s life and dreams.\n\nI love Westerns for their reliance on silence and their careful use of dialogue, but I needed more than the characters’ unspoken assumptions about their motivations for why they undertake what they do in The Wait. There is a vast territory between villainous monologues that awkwardly insert exposition and unspoken assumptions that the audience is assumed to share. It is entirely possible that I miss most of this unspoken understanding because I am not Spanish and I did not grow up in 1970s Spain under the Fascist dictator Franco and the almost feudal system The Wait presents. But I am picky about folk horror. For folk horror to work well, at least according to me, the filmmakers and the characters in the film folk horror scheme should have a clear understanding of the logic of the horror that is happening. This doesn’t mean that they have to explain all of it to the audience. The folk horror that does not work so well, at least according to me, often involves a rushed explanation at the end and either cinematic or narrative hand-waving about the devil or an ancient ritual and, you know, the olden times stuff. If the style is good enough or the explanation is delightfully weird enough, I will go along even then. With The Wait, we find out who is behind it Eladio’s suffering, but the reason for his suffering–what the antagonists gain from it–needed to be much more explicitly and with more shock than a close up of a goat head. For such a slow burn, and I love a slow burn, the ending feels rushed. It is not the final revelation of dreadful horror that a film this well-crafted deserves. And though I am willing to love a movie, especially a Western for its cinematography alone, I think The Wait suffers from not weaving in more folk horror elements sooner. As an aside, I wish The Wait had made more use of Don Francisco because Morón has such big Adolfo Celi energy. Both Marcia and Floren’s presence feel almost entirely symbolic—to spur Eladio to action–but Don Francisco, while still very much serving the machinery of the film, transcended his role in the plot.\n\nNone of this is to say that The Wait is a bad film. The acting is excellent. The cinematography and visual storytelling are fantastic. If you like Neo-Westerns, slow pacing that gives you time to appreciate everything on the screen, and actors acting their hearts out as tormented men, The Wait delivers all of that. It’s just that The Wait had such potential to be so much more.\n\nCW for The Wait / La Espera: suicide; child death; dog death.\n\nI received a review screener of the film.\n\nThe Wait screens again at Fantastic Fest 2023 :\n\nTuesday, Sep. 26 at 11:30 pm CDT, Theater 4.\n\n~~~"
