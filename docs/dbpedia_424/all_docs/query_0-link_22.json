This word isn't allowed in the global chat.\n\nIn english the word \"espera\" means \"wait\". It's a word very useful for spanish people especially when they play with their friends in CubeCraft. Also some new players feel confused when they try to use it.\n\nI think that spanish people can't say \"espera\" because the word \"pera\" is not allowed to say in global chat. In english the word \"pera\" means \"pear\"\n\nIn my opinion, It's inconvenient not to be able to use this word and a little annoying because some spanish people say \"sp3ra\" instead of \"espera\".\n\n#SpanishSquad\n\nMay 8, 2017\n\n#2\n\nNice suggestion! and good job Daniels <3 #SpanishSquad :P\n\n:)\n\nReactions: LanceDaniels\n\nMay 8, 2017\n\n#3\n\nI agree with you, because also I speak Spanish! @CyanYellow What do you think about this?

You are right, 'Espera' means wait, but it contains the word 'pera' which mean pear. But there are people who use the word 'perra' which means 'bitch'. They use the word 'pera' to by-pass the word 'perra'.\n\nOverall, I do agree with you to unblock it, but it will also be hard to make sure players don't by-pass it.\n\nMay 8, 2017\n\n#5\n\n@CyanYellow But I don't believe that the users use the word ''pera'' to want to say ''perra'', because they have a different pronunciation. o_O\n\nReactions: LanceDaniels\n\nCyan\n\nForum Expert\n\nDec 21, 2014\n\n9,760\n\n3,914\n\n279\n\nFreak Show\n\nwww.youtube.com\n\nMay 8, 2017\n\n#6\n\n@CyanYellow But I don't believe that the users use the word ''pera'' to want to say ''perra'', because they have a different pronunciation. o_O\n\nYou're right, but it's the closest they'll get to by-passing it.
