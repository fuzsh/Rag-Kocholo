        "text": "I'm not sure where you're getting a use of \"esperar\" with \"por\", unless it's the rhyming English preposition \"for\" of \"wait for\".\n\nSpanish \"esperar\" is a transitive verb meaning \"to wait for\", with no need of a preposition—\n\nunless you are waiting for a person, who will be the direct object and thus deserve to be introduced by personal \"a\".\n\n\"Estoy esperando a mi hermana, y los dos vamos a esperar el tren.\"\n\nHello, all! Could someone/someones explain to me when to use \"esperar por\" and \"experar a\"? I have read through a bunch of the forum posts, but can't seem to come up with a pattern.\n\nThanks bunches.\n\nIt might help you to think in terms of transitive and intransitive. Transitive \"esperar a\" means \"waiting for someone\" (espera a Juan; espera a su mamá), where that \"a\" is our personal a (used with people). \"Wait for\" (as in She waits for John) is actually intransitive in English, so don't let that fool you. Intransitive \"esperar por\" can have various meanings, depending on the use of the preposition \"for.\" You can tell it's an intransitive construction because you can replace \"por\" for another preposition or prepositional phrase and retain the same meaning:\" esperó por media hora (= esperó durante media hora/he waited for half an hour); espera por un retraso del vuelo (= espera debido al retraso del vuelo/espera a causa del retraso del vuelo/the delay of the flight is the cause of his waiting); espera por Juan (= espera en lugar de Juan/he waits instead of John). It follows then that espera a Juan is transitive and means \"he waits for John\" while espera por Juan is intransitive and means \"he waits instead of John.\""
