It reminded me that on my last primitivo I had wanted to take a detour to visit the 10th century church of San Pedro de Nora, but the path was totally overgrown and impassable. The Primitivo video shows that church (at about minute 2:23), so I am wondering if the path has been cleared or if anyone here on the forum has taken that short detour.\n\nThe video only deals with the part of the Primitivo that is in Asturias, but it is a very professional piece.\n\nLiana\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCP Central July 25, 2015\n\nCP Coastal July, 5, 2016\n\nBurgos to Santiago, Sept 2018\n\nCP Central 6/2020\n\nApr 16, 2020\n\n#11\n\nWhat a beautiful video! A question for anyone who can answer. I have walked 2 CP and 1 France from Burgos.\n\nI am physically fit/active, but unfortunately fractured my hip on my second Portuguese and recouped for 5 months. Was scheduled to walk another Portuguese, but watching this video has me second guessing. Do you all think it is doable and could I send my pack ahead if need be?

After my Camino was cancelled (would have started the Frances on Wed) I decided when I was able to go that I would do a different one that was not as well traveled to help support the albergues and locals. Would this be a good one to walk when things are open whenever that will be?
