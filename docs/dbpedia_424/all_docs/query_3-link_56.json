        "text": "The War of the Triple Alliance—in which Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay fought against Paraguay—resulted in that country losing much of its territory due to annexations by Argentina and Brazil. The most widely accepted explanation of the conflict maintains that under the administrations of Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia (1814–40) and Francisco Solano López (1862–70), Paraguay experienced intense economic growth despite its isolation (it was the first country in the region with a functioning railway system, for instance, which was inaugurated in 1861). That prosperity was seen as a threat by other countries in the region, especially Brazil.\n\nThe war resulted in a demographic catastrophe. Estimates of the country's population and losses vary widely, but according to one account, Paraguay's \"prewar population of approximately 525,000 was reduced to about 221,000 in 1871, of which only about 28,000 were men\" (Encyclopaedia Britannica, s.v. \"War of the Triple Alliance\"). The war was followed by a cholera epidemic. Smallpox, measles, and yellow fever were endemic. The 1886 census showed that there were 70 percent fewer men than women between the ages of fifteen and forty-five and that the birth rate was 17 percent lower than before the war. The demographic crisis that began in 1870 would begin to subside only after 1910. Some authors argue that the government enacted two policies to combat this state of affairs: immigration and free love (polygamy and polyandry). See Harris Gaylord Warren, Paraguay and the Triple Alliance: The Postwar Decade, 1869–1878 (Austin: Institute of Latin American Studies, University of Texas, 1978). Others assert that free love had been a part of Paraguayan history since before colonial times and that European settlers engaged in the long-standing Guaraní custom of polygamy. For that reason Paraguay came to be called \"Muhammad's paradise\"; chroniclers report that some of the conquerors had more than fifty wives who were forced to work long days at the loom. On these topics, and for a discussion of the modification of the concept of family as a result of the war, see Barbara Potthast-Jutkeit, \"The Ass of a Mare and Other Scandals: Marriage and Extramarital Relations in Nineteenth-Century Paraguay,\" Journal of Family History 16, no. 3 (1991): 215–39, and ¿Paraíso de Mahoma? o ¿País de las mujeres? El rol de la familia en la sociedad paraguaya del siglo XIX (Asunción: Instituto Cultural Paraguayo-Alemán, 1996).\n\nAlthough there are Wikipedia entries for very few of the artists mentioned in this text—or included in this exhibition, for that matter— there is a portal that offers access to information about them (www .portalguarani.com). There are also books such as Ticio Escobar, Una interpretación de las artes visuales en el Paraguay, vols. 1 and 2 (Asunción: Colección de las Américas, Centro Cultural Paraguayo-Norteamericano, 1982–84), and Josefina Plá, Olga Blinder, and Ticio Escobar, Arte actual en el Paraguay, 1900–1980: Antecedentes y desarrollo del proceso en las artes plásticas (Asunción: IDAP, 1983).\n\nThe other artists participating in the show were Joel Filártiga, Mariano Grotovsky, and José Laterza Parodi.\n\nStroessner was the first head of state to visit Augusto Pinochet after the coup in Chile. Pertinent to this context is the Plan Condor, which during the 1970s and 1980s linked the dictatorships in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and—to a lesser extent—Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. The US-backed plan entailed the exchange of intelligence for persecution (imprisonment, transport, and torture) of persons it considered subversive.\n\nInútil espera brings to mind Faith Wilding's poem Waiting, which the artist performed as a monologue at Womanhouse in Los Angeles in 1972. The poem \"condenses a woman's entire life into a monotonous, repetitive cycle of waiting for life to begin while she is serving and maintaining the lives of others.\" http://faithwilding.refugia.net/waiting.html.\n\nThe report of the Comisión de la Verdad y la Justicia (2008) stated that 3,470 persons were forced into exile by the regime and 17,348 left of their own volition. Fifty-seven percent went to Argentina.\n\nIn an interview Blinder explained, \"All those things I told you happened in the Stroessner years: being denied a visa to go to the United States; having to withdraw my prints from an international exhibition to which we were invited. As soon as they realized that there was another way to express condemnation, they started censoring. We were, by that point, enemies, known enemies. But before they hadn't realized [what we were doing].\" Olga Blinder, from an interview conducted by Ángel Mariano Jara Oviedo in 2007, quoted in his essay \"Algunos aspectos de la obra de Olga Blinder,\" http://paraguay.sociales.uba.ar/files/2011/08/P_Jara_2011.pdf.\n\nEscobar, Una interpretación, 2:227."
