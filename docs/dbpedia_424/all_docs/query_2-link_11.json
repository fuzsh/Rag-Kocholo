        "text": "Currently, they are backing vocalists for a globally touring band. Their distinctive sound and harmonious blend have already earned them widespread recognition. They are Espera from England, comprising Lyns, Mattie and Paige. Despite their diverse personalities, they are united by their shared passion for music, dedication, perseverance in their careers and, last but not least, their friendship. We spoke with them about their future plans, unforgettable touring experiences, and who they are behind the scenes.\n\nEspera\n\nLynsey Ward\n\nMathilda Riley\n\nPaige Phillips\n\nViQ: What do you think the sacrifices are and what are the values that come with the kind of professional commitment that you are currently in?\n\nLyns: A core value within Espera is that we remain true to and respectful of the vision and mission statement of every artist that we get to work with. We have spent years developing and diversifying our skillset, so finding ways to fuse what we do with the core fundamentals of an artist or band always feels like a true collaboration.\n\nPaige: Whichever band or artist we tour with, we want to make sure to check in with any members individually and ensure we are doing what we can to maintain a level of respect and professionalism. Whether this is via social media or out in public, weâ€™re an extension of the artists we work with and we have to respect boundaries of both members and fans!\n\nMattie: We love that itâ€™s not about us! Itâ€™s incredibly fulfilling to support and elevate an existing artistsâ€™ live setup. A large part of our job is growing and maintaining great relationships with everyone we work with so we aim to be as easy to work with as possible so we can slot effortlessly into any project. As with the touring lifestyle and schedule, remaining adaptable is key.\n\nWhat has been your most poignant experience with fans so far? How did it feel when they first started to recognize you or single you out in a story as Espera?\n\nLyns: It has been so wonderful to see so much positivity and genuine interest in what we do as a trio. We receive such heartfelt messages and comments every day, every interaction we have is a special one!\n\nPaige: I have to say, seeing so many fans in the audience cosplaying us is the most amazing and overwhelming feeling â€“ I get choked up (even on stage) seeing people put so much effort into it! The commitment to buying a whole outfit is super impressive. Another thing is that there are so many artists out there that create custom pieces based around what we do; itâ€™s so beautiful and we love seeing it!\n\nMattie: Itâ€™s not often that audiences and fans pay attention to the backing vocal section. We are so lucky and proud that so many people support us online and in person. In particular I love to see how creative people are in their artwork. Itâ€™s very flattering to have things created with our image in mind!\n\nIt is impressive that you are able to capture the attention of even the most devoted fans, yet you seamlessly blend together and become one with the music (instruments and vocals) as a whole. What do you believe is the secret to leaving such a memorable impression while still being able to stay in the background?\n\nLyns: We have been fortunate so far to have worked with folks that are happy with entrusting us with a great deal of creative decision making. From writing additional backing vocal parts to deciding what to wear on stage, weâ€™ve had the opportunity to really demonstrate great care and understanding for the material whilst also being able to stay true to ourselves and the flavour that we add.\n\nPaige: Generally speaking, in a live setting, the fans that come to the shows will have heard the studio version of the songs hundreds of times. Theyâ€™ll be able to pick up on subtle changes and notice the smallest alterations to songs they love, so even within our comparatively small addition to the shows, our parts donâ€™t go unnoticed. With that said, it is super important that we remain a completely textural element, and in no way overshadow / overpower lead vocals / other instruments. The fact weâ€™ve been trusted to take creative control with pretty much every artist weâ€™ve worked with is really cool, and something we donâ€™t take for granted.\n\nMattie: In a similar way to live orchestral reimaginings of an artistsâ€™ repertoire, backing vocals can be an incredibly emotive addition to live music. Fans and gig-goers attend concerts for the energy both in the crowd and on-stage. Many audience members know the discography inside-out so being able to add to and elevate songs with something new and exclusive to the live setting is very special to us!\n\nHow do you mentally and physically prepare for numerous performances and travels? What helps you maintain balance amidst this constant movement?\n\nLyns: Staying in touch with friends and family back home is essential for maintaining that connection to your life away from touring. It makes transitioning back to home life that bit less of a shock to the system.\n\nPaige: We all feel that itâ€™s pretty vital to stay in touch with friends / families / partners back home. Touring is very tiring, and keeping grounded by the people that are a constant in your life is key to staying happy. Looking after physical and mental health is key also â€“ I try to run or find a gym whenever I can, alongside spending as much time outdoors as possible!\n\nMattie: I think it really helps that weâ€™ve been close friends for so many years. The crazy schedule and not having much space or time for yourself â€“ itâ€™s a very specific experience, so Itâ€™s lovely to be able to have people Iâ€™m close with to talk things through! Additionally, trying to have a routine and exercise is great for breaking up the day and gives us the opportunity to appreciate some of the places we perform!\n\nStand â€“ YEBBA âœ¨ Weâ€™re having an amazing time with you all on tour. Hereâ€™s another one from our rehearsals ðŸ©¶\n\nThere are many musical genres and styles that may come into consideration before a potential collaboration â€“ but what is the primary factor you seek before entering one? What criteria must a production meet for you to envision yourself as part of it?\n\nLyns: Honestly as long as we feel that we have something meaningful to contribute that is authentic to us, I wouldnâ€™t count anything out!\n\nPaige: Weâ€™re all fans of a massive spectrum of genres and styles of music. Fortunately, the beauty of what we do means weâ€™d be able to collaborate and work with a whole host of artists â€“ as long as the project feels authentic and genuine alongside being something weâ€™re into, there probably isnâ€™t many doors weâ€™d close.\n\nMattie: The girls have said it all! We are very fortunate that everyone weâ€™ve worked with, thus far, has been lovely and passionate about what they do, so that is definitely a dreamy scenario and something weâ€™d love to continue!\n\nLyns, in addition to being a backing vocalist, is also the lead singer of Exploring Birdsong. Paige and Mattie, how much of a pull do you feel to sing in a separate band?\n\nPaige: Personally, I get the most satisfaction from being a backing vocalist when it comes to performing. I love writing music, but being front and centre has never appealed to me that much. So, I guess if I were to venture into other things, Iâ€™d love to ghost write and / or write & release songs of my own but limited to studio only! Maybe Iâ€™ll change my mind about that someday but thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m at right now!\n\nMattie: It used to be a big dream of mine to be an artist. However, I think the idea of an artist in todayâ€™s music industry is overwhelming. For me, the expectation to be an all-encompassing songwriter, social media manager, stylist, artist manager, performer and producer is a lot to take on for one person and the graft doesnâ€™t always equal success.\n\nSaying that, in the last year or so Iâ€™ve started to venture back into songwriting and Iâ€™m finding it very cathartic to write for myself.\n\nOne day in the future Iâ€™d love to release my own music, but for now, Iâ€™m enjoying every moment performing as a backing vocalist!\n\nYou have also recently worked with Malevolence. How long does it usually take to prepare for a new collab and whatâ€™s one thing you canâ€™t tune into or relate to? Any other genres you would like to try your hand at?\n\nLyns: It really just depends on what is required of us. If weâ€™re away, then folks tend to understand that we may take a little longer to get around to things than if we were at home. Generally speaking, it only takes a few weeks to get everything together with feedback from the artist.\n\nPaige: Malev were so fun to work with! Love those guys! Generally, it usually only takes a phone call to figure out exactly what is required of us girls, and a lot of the time the artist leaves us to arrange the parts. As mentioned previously, we love so many different styles of music itâ€™s hard to narrow it down â€“ but if we had to chooseâ€¦ maybe something gospel? Who knows!\n\nMattie: Having worked together for so many years, it doesnâ€™t take us long to learn and get comfortable with the arrangement. Once itâ€™s been OK-ed by the band/artist, blend is something we really focus on. Once we are happy that everything is sounding polished, itâ€™s up to the band whether theyâ€™d like further rehearsals with us or whether weâ€™ll meet them onstage for soundcheck. Either way, weâ€™re comfortable whatever their process! We donâ€™t specifically like one particular genre, but we definitely have artists weâ€™ve loved throughout our lives and would dream to work with. If I had to pick, though, maybe something folk-y or jazz orientated.\n\nA little bit of Nightlife from a stairwell in sunny California. ðŸ©¶ ðŸ“¹: Adamrosssi\n\nHow much has your vision for your future work and future requests changed in the last 3 years?\n\nLyns: I think itâ€™s fair to say that things have changed a lot for us in the past few years. We are incredibly grateful for the opportunities that we have been met with as a result of getting to be part of bigger shows rolling out across more territories. We love what we do, and what matters most to us is that we can continue to do so being proud that we are contributing something meaningful to the bands we work for and the audiences too!\n\nPaige: Wow, a lot has changed for us girls in the last 3 years. Itâ€™s still not something we can wrap our heads around â€“ back in university weâ€™d fantasise about becoming touring backing vocalists as a trio, but never in a million years did we think by now weâ€™d be working with so many amazing artists and bands that weâ€™ve dreamed of working with for years.\n\nMattie: The journey has been amazing! Weâ€™ve been lucky enough to experience tours at all levels and more recently experienced touring with large-scale production. Itâ€™s been useful learning from more experienced touring crew; what the courtesies and protocol is in a variety of touring-related situations and the roles within the camp. Going forward, weâ€™re excited to share our passion with more incredible artists in even more territories.\n\nIs there anything that you simply wouldnâ€™t leave home for a tour without?\n\nLyns: Nintendo Switch is an absolute must!!\n\nPaige: My running shoes! And Airtagsâ€¦\n\nMattie: Headphones, sleep aid and suncream!\n\nWhat has the last year taught you on a career and personal level? Was there anything you valued as a gift or a lesson? You have been on quite a journey of self-discovery. What do you carry with you, regardless of your future plans, because it motivates you, gives you life and strength?\n\nLyns: For me, the greatest gift that Espera keeps on giving is the love, warmth and unconditional support we have for one another. Touring is such a unique experience for each person in the touring party but knowing that I have two of my best friends around that have my back no matter what is so comforting. We are sharing something that people donâ€™t tend to get much insight into and knowing that someday we will be old and reminiscing about it all is very exciting too.\n\nPaige: Touring can be difficult â€“ being away from your loved ones and places of comfort for such elongated periods of time can be very challenging, and without a â€˜regularâ€™ routine, it can be tricky to find the balance between whatâ€™s â€˜real lifeâ€™ and what isnâ€™t. What Iâ€™ve personally found, is that no matter the challenges us three girls have faced, there has been unwavering support for one another and no matter what, our mental and physical health comes first. Itâ€™s great to know that your two best friends are with you, and you share the highs and the lows together.\n\nMattie: Weâ€™ll never take the opportunities weâ€™ve been given as a trio of best friends for granted. Weâ€™ve all seen some tough times while being on tour and the love we have for each other means that weâ€™ll always have support. Because of this, I think my confidence and conviction to assert myself as a professional has improved drastically. To know that the two most talented people I know want me around as much as they do really make my heart feel full!\n\nAnd finally, a bonus question: what would you do if you werenâ€™t playing music? Did you see music as your future from a young age, or did you consider other professions before you decided to do so?\n\nLyns: Music was the plan from quite a young age, but had it not worked out I think I would have liked to have been a special effects artist in television and/or film. I love seeing how visual effects are achieved and understanding the ins and outs of practical effects even more so!\n\nPaige: I have a qualification in dog grooming and love wildlife, so most likely something to do with animals!\n\nMattie: I never really had a plan for what I wanted to do, but I knew music and singing was something that gave me a kick from a young age! In my spare time, I love to create playlists of all different genres and moods and finding new music, so maybe creating playlisting for music streaming services or finding music for TV/film!\n\nI wish you ongoing success and thrilling moments together, and may your wildest dreams keep coming true!\n\nEspera\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTikTok\n\nPhotos: @adamrosssi, @blessuh\n\nby: ViQ"
