        "text": "Access to the lagunas takes you across several kilometres of a mixture of farmland and scrub where Red-legged Partridge, Crested Lark, Calandra Lark and other small passerines abound. This, in turn, attracts birds of prey such as Booted Eagle, Short-toed Snake Eagle and Montagu's Harrier in summer and during passage/winter Hen Harrier, juvenile Bonelli's Eagle and occasionally Spanish Eagle.\n\nAfter c5km from Espera you reach the first laguna - Laguna Hondilla - which is viewable from the track. This laguna, though, is choked with willow scrub and of the three the least productive laguna for birds although it usually holds the odd White-headed Duck and has had Red-knobbed Coot . Roughly 500m further on the largest laguna - Laguna Salada de la Zorrilla - comes into view on the left (as you come from Espera). A footpath takes you along the edge of the laguna but viewing is difficult thanks to a screen of bushes and reeds. A hide on the left after c300m gives a better view but you need a telescope and bushes and trees still obscure the view. Look here for Red-crested Pochard, White-headed Duck , Black-necked Grebe, Purple Swamphen and Greater Flamingo. Marbled Teal also occurs. Eurasian Coot are common but picking out its rarer relative here is very tricky as views tend to be distant. Osprey can be seen particularly as the local population (breeding & wintering) continues to expand. The reeds and scrub are home to a variety of warblers: Reed Warbler , Great Reed Warbler, Melodious Warbler , Sardinian Warbler, Greater Whitethroat and Zitting Cisticola.\n\nA further c1km along the path takes you to the last laguna - Laguna Dulce de la Zorrilla - which holds all the previously mentioned species but tends to be the best for Red-knobbed Coot. Once again viewing can be difficult as it is well screened by tall reads and scrub. Stone-curlew can also be found in the area."
