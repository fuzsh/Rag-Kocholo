        "text": "The mountains were in close sight now. The Verde road amongst many other roads was the only one that was full of bumps, small rocks and potholes. Sodo and Fillia were tarred, smooth and easy to navigate through to the mountains. The mountains there were nothing close to Verde’s. My parents had told me about its beauty and charm; one of the many reasons I always loved and desired Verde. The mountains are bright and colourful and most travellers prefer to go on the other roads. There are no bumps there, smooth roads and more people travel through the road. However, the road to Verde was bumpy. Choosing Verde was the biggest decision I had made in my life. I had left the easy routes and chosen this road.\n\nI needed all the help and strength I could get, and I couldn’t have been more grateful for the presence of my friend, Espera, by my side. He had given me his unwavering assurance that he would stand by me. In times of trouble, everyone has that one person they rely on, and I had selected Him to be that source of support in my life. Whether it was a subtle sigh or a gentle request for help, he would unfailingly be at my side without any hesitation.\n\nHowever, as we approached the mountains, I lost sight of him. There were more people now headed to Verde gate. With this crowd of people, I didn’t know how I missed Him. Every traveller has to cross a 5km underground pathway just before the gate. I wondered why Espera suddenly disappeared when I needed Him to get through this last big step. As I climbed a small piece of rock at the foot of the mountains, I saw Toku, the young boy I had met earlier. He assured me that the mountains are surely rewarding and refreshing, then gave me a bottle of water, encouraging me not to quit. Overcoming the urge to quit was a challenge every traveler had to conquer to reach the mountains. Throughout the journey, there were moments when I had almost quit. However, in various ways, He provided the encouragement that kept me going.\n\nWith His encouragement, I looked forward to what the mountains held in store for me. Deep down, I couldn’t wait to see the breathtaking sight of the mountains but much more, I yearned for the unfolding friendship with my newfound companion."
