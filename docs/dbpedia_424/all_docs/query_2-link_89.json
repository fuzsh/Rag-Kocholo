        "text": "When it comes to blending the raw intensity of post-hardcore with the atmospheric depth of post-metal, Mexico’s Satón is a name that undoubtedly stands out. Their latest full-length offering, “A La Espera Del Momento” (Waiting for the Moment), is a testament to their ability to wear their emotions on their sleeve, fusing angst, despair, and hope in equal measure.\n\nThe band’s evolution from their 2019 debut “Lleno de Hienas” is evident.\n\nWhile their roots in hardcore and screamo remain, “A La Espera Del Momento” sees them venturing further into the realms of mathcore, with discernible influences from icons like The Dillinger Escape Plan.\n\n““A la espera del momento” is an album where we talk about transitions through a perspective of fear and anguish. Having a hummingbird in flames for our album cover, is our way to honor mayan culture, it being a messenger between life and death, with us emphazising on the feelings of angst through fire.” – says the band.\n\nThe album is a roller coaster of emotions, oscillating between frenzied aggression and introspective melancholy. The track “YNQHDD” (Ya No Quiero Hablar De Depresión or I Don’t Want To Talk About Depression Anymore) stands out, addressing the vital issue of mental health and the importance of empathy and understanding.\n\nThe album kicks off with the track “La Llama,” setting the tone with its explosive energy and intricate instrumentation. As you delve deeper into the album, tracks like “Noni” and “Entre mibsuerte y tu negligencia” showcase the band’s penchant for blending chaotic riffs with poignant lyricism.\n\nThe album’s artwork, depicting a hummingbird engulfed in flames, pays homage to the Mayan culture, symbolizing the messenger between life and death. This theme of duality – life and death, hope and despair, love and loss – runs throughout the entire offering.\n\n“Lyric wise, this is a very personal album. We tried to be as honest as we could through the words and messages that we want to share, so that not only the music, but a general feeling could come through and listeners could relate to.” – comments Satón .\n\nSatón’s line-up, consisting of Emilio Domínguez on guitar/vocals, Gabriel Mendoza on drums, and Daniel Vega on bass, brings a unique synergy to their live performances. Their shows are a cathartic outpouring of raw emotion, with each member giving their all to ensure the audience feels every note and every word.\n\nIn a world where acoustic strums often dominate the airwaves, Satón reminds us of the power of distortion, screams, and raw emotion.\n\n“A La Espera Del Momento” is not just an album; it’s an experience – one that takes you on a journey through the depths of human emotion. Today, we dive deep into the details of this multi-style offering, with a special track by track commentary below.\n\n“We really hope that whoever takes the time to read through this, can have a better and more personal understanding of the general feelings we printed in our songs, that you can get to have an even bigger connection with the music and eventually with us as well.” – adds Satón.\n\n“We believe music is a language of its own, but we wanted to take the time in order to perhaps go even further and deeper in sharing with you.”\n\nSATÓN – “A LA ESPERA DEL MOMENTO”\n\nA la espera del momento by Satón\n\nNoni\n\nThis is the first song we wrote for this album. It came very natural for us, we had the need to start doing new things after our previous record. We think it came to be as easy as it could be, since we finally were aware of who we wanted to be as a band, being this the first time the three of us were in the writing process as the line up we are now.\n\nIn my opinion (Gabriel), the song was a way for me to let go of a really stressful and anguishing moment I lived in previous times. Lyrics talk about trying to be empathetic to a person who happen to live a very tragic moment, and me having the need to change places, so that we could share the pain or even me changing places in that period of time.\n\nWe also wanted to share this message through the music video for the song, although it’s not as obvious, you could get an idea of what we’re trying to portrait with it.\n\nEntre mi suerte y tu negligencia\n\nThis song I wrote to my brother (Emilio), it talks about his process dealing with frustration and how it affected me watching him in dispair. Through the song, it was the way, a vehicle, for me to be honest to him and share how much I value him and how much he’s worth, if he could only change the way he perceives himself.\n\nLa urbe\n\nThis song it’s written to the lack of humanity and empathy in a city where violence and ignorance is all you perceive on a day to day basis.\n\nTrying to connect with people in a city so big (like Mexico City), noticing the way human beings don’t even recognize each others as such is frustrating.\n\nWe know this is a general feeling everywhere in the world, but in our community, what we really want to achieve, is meaningful and real connections through sharing music and being in the moment when it comes to playing shows. Hopefully we get to do so every song we play.\n\nYNQHDD\n\n“IDWTTADA” (I Don’t Want To Talk About Depression Anymore).\n\nIt talks about the importance of acknowlaging depression and listening to each other, being able to put oneself in the shoes of others.\n\nMental health is something we all try to take care of on our daily basis, even more after living a lockdown and realizing how big our need for human connection is. As artists, we do need the feedback of people reacting to our sharing of music whe playing shows, not having that, we could see how it affected us mentaly, and now we wanna be aware that everybody needs human interaction and empathy towards this.\n\nMandíbula de cristal\n\nThis is a song in which, through a negative way, we state a motivational message.\n\nIt expresses the need of freeing yourself and stop priving yourself of being who you really are, showing and sharing your true colors.\n\nThe lyrics to this song, in the way they are screamed to the music, defenitely make us feel how liberating playing this song is.\n\nWe can feel ourselves angrily explosive in a very cathartic way.\n\nEl noveno aire\n\nThis song is anger at it’s core, lyrics talk about feeling alienated and in automode; being tired of being and becoming a robot who’s only end is to work, eat and sleep.\n\nIn the social and economic system we ended up developing ourselves, we find it hard to maintane a balance with making money to live and also pursuing making music; sometimes you get eaten by the need of money and become a feelingless robot.\n\nOf course that is something that enrages us! Hahaha\n\nA la espera del momento\n\nThis is a very melancholic song, written from my perspective (Emilio) of how anguishing and overwhelming it was for me to accompany my grandfather through his dementia. Looking how hard it is for him to confront his brief sane moments and him realizing and being aware of the whole situation.\n\nIn his own words “his time here is overdue, he is only in the wait of the moment”.\n\nMientes\n\nThis song is dedicated to my parents (Emilio), who have been struggling with bad habits in general and their lack of or capacity to communicate.\n\nThey’ve decided to ignore their diseases and not changing their ways living and continuing to blind themselves and don’t accept help.\n\nThis is hard for me, but through this song, I’ve also found a way of understanding that one can only get to a certain extent if people don’t want to be better or improve themselves when it’s more than obvious they’re hurting themselves.\n\nWe’ve decided to work on ourselves first, so that we can be there for our friends and family when needed.\n\nCírculos\n\nThis song came really quick lyric wise. It being a fats paced song, we immediatelly knew what it was gonna be about. About the way we tend to overthink things and end up getting stuck in our own thoughts not moving forward.\n\nWe tried to to the opposite with this one. Not overthinking it.\n\nUn Pacto\n\nThis is for my grandmother (Emilio), she was my unconditional protector. She was an artist, writer, but over all a very prived being; during her childhood she grew up in a very conservative enviroment, where all of her talents where chained to a wall.\n\nThis song is about how hard it was for me to loose her and the hatred I feel for never being able to see her entirely free.\n\nIf you have read this far, we really want to thank you for taking the time in doing so.\n\nIt means the world to us to be sharing this album and even more things in a personal way with you.\n\nWe really hope you enjoy, relate to and share “A la espera del momento”.\n\nFor more raw emotions, please follow our post hardcore / screamo playlist here:\n\nWant to keep the beat going?\n\nIDIOTEQ is a one-man DIY operation, tirelessly spotlighting the local cultural scenes and independent bands that often go unreported elsewhere.
