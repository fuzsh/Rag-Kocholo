        "text": "A roll-call of resplendent royals and glittering aristocrats gathered to witness the society wedding of Duke Carl of Württemberg and Princess Diane of Orléans 64 years ago this week. The couple married at Schloss Altshausen, south-west Germany, on 21 July 1960.\n\nDuke Carl of Württemberg was the second son of Philipp Albrecht, Duke of Württemberg and Archduchess Rosa of Austria, Princess of Tuscany. His elder brother, Ludwig, renounced his succession rights, and Carl became head of the House of Württemberg on the death of his father in June 1975.\n\nRead More\n\nWhen Lady Eliza and Lady Amelia Spencer spoke to Tatler about Althorp, South Africa and their aunt, Princess Diana\n\nIn a world exclusive, Lady Eliza and Lady Amelia Spencer opened up to Associate Editor Sacha Forbes in the March 2021 issue of Tatler. Rediscover the interview as the twins celebrate their birthday\n\nThe young aristocrat met his future wife in 1956, on board a cruise organised by Queen Frederica of Greece, the mother of Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, King Constantine II of Greece, and Queen Sofia of Spain. Princess Diane was the daughter of Henri of Orléans, Count of Paris, the pretender to the throne of France, and his wife, Princess Isabelle of Orléans-Braganza. Princess Diane was born in her mother’s native Brazil, owing to rules that prevented her father, as a pretender to the throne, from living in France. The family later relocated to Paris.\n\nIn a romantic twist, Carl and Diane’s families became entwined months before their wedding when the princess’s brother, Prince Henri, married Carl’s sister, Duchess Marie-Thérèse of Württemberg.\n\nOn the eve of the wedding, guests including the then Prince Juan Carlos of Spain (future King Juan Carlos I of Spain and father of King Felipe VI) gathered for a spectacular ball to toast the bride and groom. The bride sparkled in the Ruby Tiara and Parure, which proved the perfect accompaniment to a deep pink satin gown. According to the Royal Watcher; her future mother-in-law wore the Württemberg Sapphire Tiara, her sisters dazzled in the Orléans Royal Tiaras; her sisters-in-law were captivating in the Württemberg Royal Tiaras. Other notable attendees included Princess Maria Cristina of Savoy-Aosta.\n\nRead More\n\nShe was once called Rishi Sunak's secret weapon: how Akshata Murty rose from heiress to First Lady\n\nWe revisit when Akshata Murty let Tatler peek through the Downing Street door for the February 2023 issue…\n\nThe evening was a sumptuous celebration of the union between two of the continent’s grandest families. Women, splendidly attired in their finest ballgowns and family jewels, were twirled across the floor by dapper men dressed to the nines. There were official portraits of the couple, their families, and their friends, preserving the memory of this special occasion.\n\nThe following day came the wedding itself. The couple exchanged vows in front of their distinguished guest-list and the princess became the Duchess of Württemberg.\n\nThe Württemberg family business manages some 5,500 hectares of forest, 2,000 hectares of meadows and fields, 50 hectares of vineyards, other land in Germany and abroad, including forests in Canada and Austria, and company holdings. It also maintains some 70 cultural monuments of the House of Württemberg. The current headquarters of the estate is Friedrichshafen Castle.\n\nRead More\n\n‘Gold digger’, ‘bimbo’, ‘trapped in a loveless marriage’…, have we got Melania Trump all wrong?\n\nOn the eve of the US presidential election back in 2020, friends, DC insiders and Melania herself told Ben Judah how a small-time Slovenian fashion model rose to wear the mantle of First Lady\n\nThe duke and duchess went on to welcome four sons and two daughters and shared 16 grandchildren. Carl, Duke of Württemberg died in 2022 aged 85. He was survived by Diane, now 83. Their eldest son, Duke Friedrich of Württemberg, had been due to succeed his father as head of the family, however he tragically died in a car crash in 2018. Friedrich’s eldest son, Wilhelm, therefore succeeded his grandfather as Duke of Württemberg."
