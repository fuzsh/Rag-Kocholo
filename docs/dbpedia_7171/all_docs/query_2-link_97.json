        "text": "For other people called Princess Friederike of Hanover, see Princess Frederica (disambiguation).\n\nPrincess Friederike of Hanover (born 15 October 1954 at Salem, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is a member of the Royal House of Hanover. She is a niece of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nFull name[edit]\n\nThe full name of the princess in German is Friederike Elisabeth Viktoria-Luise Alice Olga Theodora Helena, Prinzessin von Hannover, Prinzessin von Großbritannien und Irland, Herzogin zu Braunschweig-Lüneburg.[1][2][3][4]\n\nFamily[edit]\n\nPrincess Friederike is the youngest child and only daughter of Prince George William of Hanover and his wife Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark. Her father, George William, was the second son of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, who had been the last reigning Duke of Brunswick, the pretender to the throne of Hanover and the seniormost male-line descendant of King George III of the United Kingdom. Her mother, Sophie, was born a princess of Greece and Denmark, being the daughter of Prince Andrew of Greece, himself the son of King George I of Greece.\n\nPrincess Friederike is closely related to the royalty of several countries. Her mother's brother is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, making Fredericke a niece of Queen Elizabeth II, who is her godmother. Her father's sister was Queen Frederica of Greece, making Fredericke the first cousin of King Constantine II of Greece and Queen Sofia of Spain. Fredericke is a descendant of Queen Victoria, King Christian IX of Denmark, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, and is thus linked in some way to nearly every royal family in Europe.\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nShe attended Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada in the late 1970s.[5]\n\nPrior to her marriage and move to Canada, Friederike was often mentioned in media reports as a potential bride for Charles, Prince of Wales.[5][3]\n\nMarriage and issue[edit]\n\nFriederike married Jerry William Cyr (born 16 January 1951), son of Gordon Paul Cyr and Emma Grandbois, on 17 August 1979 in Vancouver, Canada. Frederike and Jerry have two children:\n\nJulia Emma Cyr (born 17 September 1982 at St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada)\n\nJean-Paul Welf Cyr (born 6 March 1985 at Grace Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada)\n\nTitles and styles[edit]\n\n15 October 1954 – 17 August 1979: Her Royal Highness[2][3][4] Princess Friederike of Hanover\n\n17 August 1979 – present: Her Royal Highness Princess Friederike of Hanover, Mrs. Jerry Cyr\n\nAncestry[edit]\n\nReferences[edit]"
