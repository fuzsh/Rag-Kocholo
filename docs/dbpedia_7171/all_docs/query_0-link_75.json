His elder half-sister was Amalia of Oldenburg, Queen Consort of Greece.\n\nAnton was a charming prince and tried his best to please his worried father. His father was determined to keep his living son alive and make his wife Cecilia proud. Anton was patient but unlike his other half-sister and half-brothers he wanted to have a good education. He went to public academies which made his father concerned. When his father died Anton felt lonely but continued to take public academies.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn 9 November 1876, in Vienna, he married morganatically Baroness Natalie Vogel von Friesenhof (8 April 1854 Vienna-9 January 1937 Hungary). The couple had two children:\n\nCountess Alexandrine Gustava Friederike von Welsburg (11 October 1877 Vienna-13 April 1901 Austria); who died unmarried at the age of 23\n\nCount Gustav Gregor Alexander von Welsburg (29 August 1878 Hungary-29 November 1927 Switzerland); who married Countess Luise von Hahn and fathered three sons and one daughter.\n\nTitles and styles\n\n11 January 1936 – present His Highness Duke Elimar of Oldenburg\n\nAncestors\n\nReferences"
