It was made of gold and decorated with pearls, diamonds, sapphires and emeralds coming from the collection of Duke Charles Alexander of WÃ¼rttemberg, the so called Carolinischen Jewels. It is a corona clausa, or closed crown, made in the shape of a circlet with eight palmettes and eight arches surmounted by a gold globe with a big diamond cross on its top. It is not certain who had executed the crown but the royal court jeweller August Heinrich Kuhn seems to be the most obvious person to receive such a commission. Certain elements of the crown might have been a work of French jeweller Martin Guillaume Biennais, as they bear significant resemblance to the Bavarian crown which had been executed by him.\n\nSmall changes were made to the crown during the reign of King William I. These, however, did not affect the original shape of the crown. During the wars of 1866 and 1870 the WÃ¼rttemberg regalia were sent for safekeeping respectively to St Gallen in Switzerland and to Ulm. In 1918/1919 the regalia were prepared for dispatch to Switzerland. In 1945 they had been found by the French troops in the treasury of a bank in Biberach and were later handed over to the government of WÃ¼rttemberg. It was kept in the vaults of the Landesbank in Stuttgart. Since 1971 it has been exhibited in the Treasury of the Old Castle (The WÃ¼rttemberg Museum) in Stuttgart.\n\nThe Sceptre is probably a work of Nikolaus Thouret. It is simple in its empire style topped with a big emerald and a diamond cross. The emerald comes from the so called Carolinischen Jewels.\n\nThe Throne of WÃ¼rttemberg kings was executed in 1810 according to Nicolas Thouret's design. It is decorated with a royal crown placed between two gilt eagles.\n\nThe Crown of WÃ¼rttemberg (1806)"
