        "text": "Juan Carlos I (Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias, born January 5, 1938) is a member of the Spanish royal family who reigned as King of Spain from November 1975 until his abdication in June 2014.\n\nJuan Carlos was born to Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, and Princess María de las Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in Rome, Italy, where his grandfather King Alfonso XIII of Spain and other members of the Spanish royal family lived in exile following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. He was baptized as Juan Carlos Alfonso Víctor María de Borbón y Borbón-Dos Sicilias. He was given the name Juan Carlos after his father and maternal grandfather, Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.\n\nGeneralísimo Francisco Franco, the Spanish head of state who initiated the civil war by means of a coup d’état against the constitutional republic in 1936, took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, and in 1947 Spain’s status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. Juan Carlos’s father, Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona was the third son of King Alfonso XIII and Victoria Eugenie (daughter of Princess Beatrice, the fifth daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha) who had renounced his claims to the throne in January 1941. Juan was seen by Franco to be too liberal and in 1969 was bypassed in favour of Juan Carlos as Franco’s successor as head of state.\n\nJuan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza. Later, he attended the Naval Military School, the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid.\n\nIn 1962, Juan Carlos married in Athens Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark daughter of King Pavlos of Greece and Princess Frederica of Hanover (granddaughter of German Emperor Wilhelm II) first in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Church of St. Denis, followed by a Greek Orthodox ceremony at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. She converted from her Greek Orthodox religion to Roman Catholicism. The couple had two daughters and a son together: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe.\n\nDue to Franco’s declining health, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain’s head of state in the summer of 1974. Franco died in November the following year and Juan Carlos became king on November 22, 1975, two days after Franco’s death, the first reigning monarch since 1931; although his exiled father, Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona did not formally renounce his claims to the throne in favor of his son until 1977.\n\nExpected to continue Franco’s legacy, Juan Carlos, however, soon after his accession introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and begin the Spanish transition to democracy. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum, which re-established a constitutional monarchy. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert Spain to Francoist government in the King’s name. In 2008, he was considered the most popular leader in all Ibero-America.\n\nHailed for his role in Spain’s transition to democracy, the King and the monarchy’s reputation began to suffer after controversies surrounding his family arose, exacerbated by an elephant-hunting trip he undertook during a time of financial crisis in Spain where he broke his hip and was with his alleged mistress, Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein.\n\nAbdication\n\nSpanish news media speculated about the King’s future in early 2014, following public criticism over his taking an elephant hunting safari in Botswana and an embezzlement scandal involving his daughter Cristina, and her husband Inaki Urdangarin. The King’s chief of staff in a briefing denied that the ‘abdication option’ was being considered. On the morning of June 2, 2014, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy made a televised announcement that the King had told him of his intention to abdicate. Later, the King delivered a televised address and announced that he would abdicate the throne in favour of the Prince of Asturias.\n\nRoyal officials described the King’s choice as a personal decision which he had been contemplating since his 76th birthday at the start of the year. The King reportedly said, “No queremos que mi hijo se marchite esperando como el príncipe Carlos.” (English: “I do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles.”) As required by the Spanish constitution, any abdication would be settled by means of an organic law. A draft law was passed with 299 in favour, 19 against and 23 abstaining.\n\nOn June 18, he signed the organic law passed by parliament several hours before his abdication took effect. The Prince of Asturias was enthroned on June 19, 2014, as King Felipe VI of Spain and the new Kings daughter, Leonor became the new Princess of Asturias.\n\nJuan Carlos thus became the fourth European monarch to abdicate in just over a year, following Pope Benedict XVI (February 28, 2013), Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands (April 30, 2013), and King Albert II of Belgium (July 21, 2013).\n\nSince his abdication King Juan Carlos has retained, by courtesy, the title and style of King that he enjoyed during his reign.\n\nFranz Joseph I (August 18, 1830 – November 21, 1916) was Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, and monarch of many other states of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, from December 2, 1848 to his death. From May 1, 1850 to August 24, 1866 he was also President of the German Confederation, the successor state to the Holy Roman Empire. He was the longest-reigning Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, as well as the third-longest-reigning monarch of any country in European history, after Louis XIV of France and Johann II of Liechtenstein.\n\nFranz Joseph was born in the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna (on the 65th anniversary of the death his great-great grandfather Holy Roman Emperor Franz I of Lorraine) as the eldest son of Archduke Franz Karl (the younger son of Holy Roman Emperor Franz II), and his wife Princess Sophie of Bavaria. Because his uncle, reigning from 1835 as the Emperor Ferdinand, was weak-minded, and his father unambitious and retiring, his mother of the young Archduke Franz Joseph brought him up as a future Emperor, with emphasis on devotion, responsibility and diligence.\n\nDuring the Revolutions of 1848 the Austrian Chancellor Prince Metternich resigned (March-April 1848). The young Archduke, who (it was widely expected) would soon succeed his uncle on the throne, was appointed Governor of Bohemia on April 6, 1848, but never took up the post. As the revolutionaries of 1848 were marching on the palace, Emperor Ferdinand is supposed to have asked Metternich for an explanation. When Metternich answered that they were making a revolution, Ferdinand is supposed to have said “But are they allowed to do that?”\n\nEmperor Ferdinand was convinced by Felix zu Schwarzenberg to abdicate in favour of his nephew, Franz Joseph (the next in line was Ferdinand’s younger brother Franz Karl, but he was persuaded to waive his succession rights in favour of his son). Therefore, with the abdication of his uncle Ferdinand and the renunciation of his father (the mild-mannered Franz Karl) Franz Joseph succeeded as Emperor of Austria at Olomouc on December 2. At first Franz Joseph wanted to reign as Franz II but given that his grandfather Franz I was also known as Franz II as the last Holy Roman Emperor he decided to avoid any confusion and became known by his second as well as his first Christian name.\n\nFranz Joseph was troubled by nationalism during his entire reign. He concluded the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which granted greater autonomy to Hungary and transformed the Austrian Empire into the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. He ruled peacefully for the next 45 years, but personally suffered the tragedies of the execution of his brother, the Emperor Maximilian of Mexico in 1867, the suicide of his only son and heir-apparent, Crown Prince Rudolf, in 1889, the assassination of his wife, Empress Elisabeth, in 1898, and the assassination of his nephew and heir-presumptive, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in 1914.\n\nAfter the Austro-Prussian War, Austria-Hungary turned its attention to the Balkans, which was a hotspot of international tension because of conflicting interests with the Russian Empire. The Bosnian Crisis was a result of Franz Joseph’s annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908, which had been occupied by his troops since the Congress of Berlin (1878).\n\nOn June 28, 1914, the assassination of his nephew and heir-presumptive, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo resulted in Austria-Hungary’s declaration of war against the Kingdom of Serbia, which was an ally of the Russian Empire. That activated a system of alliances which resulted in World War I.\n\nFranz Joseph died in the Schönbrunn Palace on the evening of November 21, 1916, at the age of 86. His death was a result of developing pneumonia of the right lung several days after catching a coldwhile walking in Schönbrunn Park with King Ludwig III of Bavaria. He was succeeded by his grandnephew Karl I, who reigned until the collapse of the Empire following its defeat in 1918.\n\nHe is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna, where flowers are still left by monarchists.\n\nThe full list of title held by Franz Joseph (after the loss of the Lombardy in 1859 and Venetia in 1866):\n\nEmperor of Austria, Apostolic King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, of Slavonia, of Galicia, of Lodomeria, and of Illyria, King of Jerusalem, and so forth, Archduke of Austria, Grand Duke of Tuscany and of Cracow, Duke of Lorraine, of Salzburg, of Styria, of Carinthia, of Carniola and of the Bukovina, Grand Prince of Transylvania, Margrave in Moravia, Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia, of Modena, Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, of Auschwitz and Zator, of Teschen, Friuli, Ragusa and Zara, Princely Count of Habsburg and Tyrol, of Kyburg, Gorizia and Gradisca, Prince of Trent and Brixen, Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and in Istria, Count of Hohenems, Feldkirch, Bregenz, Sonnenberg, and so forth, Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro and of the Windic March, Grand Voivode of the Voivodship of Serbia, and so forth, Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nElizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and 1937. Prince Philip was the son of Prince Andreas of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg (a granddaughter of Queen Victoria).\n\nThey are second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through Queen Victoria. After another meeting at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939, Elizabeth—though only 13 years old—said she fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange letters. She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on July 9, 1947.\n\nThe engagement was not without controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links. Marion Crawford wrote, “Some of the King’s advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip’s foreign origin.” Later biographies reported Elizabeth’s mother had reservations about the union initially, and teased Philip as “The Hun.” In later life, however, the Queen Mother told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was “an English gentleman.”\n\nBefore the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Anglicanism, and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, taking the surname of his mother’s British family. Just before the wedding, he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the style His Royal Highness. However, he wasn’t made a Prince of the United Kingdom in his own right until 1958 when Her Majesty granted him that distinction.\n\nElizabeth and Philip were married on November 20, 1947 at Westminster Abbey. They received 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world. Because Britain had not yet completely recovered from the devastation of the war, Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the material for her gown, which was designed by Norman Hartnel. In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for Philip’s German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding. The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, was not invited either.\n\nToday I will begin a series on the life of King Charles I of England. In the coming weeks I will include entries on his marriage his accession to the throne, his reign and the English Civil War, culminating in his trial which I will cover on its anniversary this January.\n\nCharles I of England was the second son of King James VI of Scotland and Anne of Denmark, Charles was born in Dunfermline Palace, Fife, on November 19, 1600. At a Protestant ceremony in the Chapel Royal of Holyrood Palace in Edinburghon 23 December 1600, he was baptised by David Lindsay, Bishop of Ross, and created Duke of Albany, the traditional title of the second son of the King of Scotland, with the subsidiary titles of Marquess of Ormond, Earl of Ross and Lord Ardmannoch.\n\nJames VI was the first cousin twice removed of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and when she died childless in March 1603, he became King of England as James I. Charles was a weak and sickly infant, and while his parents and older siblings left for England in April and early June that year, due to his fragile health, he remained in Scotland with his father’s friend Lord Fyvie, appointed as his guardian.\n\nIn January 1605, Charles was created Duke of York, as is customary in the case of the English sovereign’s second son, and made a Knight of the Bat. Thomas Murray, a presbyterian Scot, was appointed as a tutor. Charles learnt the usual subjects of classics, languages, mathematics and religion. In 1611, he was made a Knight of the Garter.\n\nEventually, Charles apparently conquered his physical infirmity, which might have been caused by rickets. He became an adept horseman and marksman, and took up fencing Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate.\n\nHowever, in early November 1612, Henry died at the age of 18 of what is suspected to have been typhoid (or possibly porphyria) Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became heir apparent. As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, Charles automatically gained several titles (including Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay). Four years later, in November 1616, he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.\n\nDuchess Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (November 19, 1779 – January 4, 1801) was the maternal grandmother of Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\nDuchess Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Hereditary Princess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg\n\nLouise Charlotte was born Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, daughter of Grand Duke Friedrich Franz I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Her mother was Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg; her sister Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1784–1840) married King Christian VIII of Denmark.\n\nLife\n\nOn November 1, 1795, Louise Charlotte was engaged to King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. The engagement was arranged by Gustaf Adolf Reuterholm, the de facto regent of Sweden, who wished to keep his influence after the monarch was declared of legal majority by having a queen indebted to him for her position. The king himself was initially positive; the engagement was celebrated in the courts of Sweden and Mecklenburg and Louise Charlotte was mentioned in the official church prayer in Sweden. Empress Catherine the Great, however, wished her grand daughter Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna of Russia to be Queen of Sweden, and displayed dislike of the engagement.\n\nHeredity Prince and Princess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg\n\nUpon this many people told the king that Louise Charlotte, whom he had not seen, was not beautiful. About the same period, the monarch also fell in love with Ebba Modée. When the king was declared of legal majority in 1796, he broke off the engagement. Her father demanded compensation. In 1803, the matter was settled when the Swedish city of Wismar in Germany was turned over to Mecklenburg-Schwerin by a treaty in Malmö.\n\nAugust, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg\n\nIn Ludwigslust on October 21, 1797 she married August, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, a second cousin on her mother’s side. Their common ancestor was Duke Friedrich II of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1676–1732). The marriage was arranged against her will and was an unhappy one: her spouse abused her and she wished to leave him, but was forced by her family to stay. She was described as very blond, not attractive, somewhat hunchbacked but also as witty, talented, cultivated and with a pleasant manner, though more open than what was regarded as an ideal for the period.\n\nThree years later, on December 21, 1800 in Friedenstein Castle around 12.45 pm the Hereditary Princess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg gave birth her only child, a daughter, named Louise after her; this daughter later became the wife of Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and mother to Prince Albert, Prince consort of Queen Victoria. However, she never recovered from childbirth effects and died eleven days later, on January 1, 1801 at the age of 21, before August assumed the throne of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm I in Prussia, popularly dubbed the Soldier King, had created a large and powerful army led by his famous “Potsdam Giants”, carefully managed his treasury, and developed a strong centralized government. He was prey to a violent temper (in part due to porphyritic illness) and ruled Brandenburg-Prussia with absolute authority.\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm I in Prussia\n\nAs his eldest son and heir Crown Prince Friedrich (future King Friedrich II The Great of Prussia) grew, his preference for music, literature and French culture clashed with his father’s militarism, resulting in Friedrich Wilhelm frequently beating and humiliating him. In contrast, Friedrich’s mother Sophia of Hanover was polite, charismatic and learned. Her father, Elector George Louis of Brunswick-Lüneburg, succeeded to the British throne as King George I in 1714.\n\nCrown Prince Friedrich became close friends with Hans Hermann von Katte, a Prussian officer several years older than him and served as one of his tutors. When he was 18, Friedrich plotted to flee to England with Katte and other junior army officers. While the royal retinue was near Mannheim in the Electorate of the Palatinate, Robert Keith, Peter Keith’s brother, had an attack of conscience when the conspirators were preparing to escape and begged King Friedrich Wilhelm for forgiveness on August 5, 1730.\n\nFriedrich as Crown Prince (1739)\n\nCrown Prince Friedrich and Katte were subsequently arrested and imprisoned in Küstrin. Because they were army officers who had tried to flee Prussia for Great Britain, Friedrich Wilhelm leveled an accusation of treason against the pair. The king briefly threatened the crown prince with execution, then considered forcing Friedrich to renounce the succession in favour of his brother, August Wilhelm, although either option would have been difficult to justify to the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThe king forced Friedrich to watch the beheading of his confidant Katte at Küstrin on November 6, leading the crown prince to faint just before the fatal blow. Friedrich was granted a royal pardon and released from his cell on November 18, although he remained stripped of his military rank. Instead of returning to Berlin, however, he was forced to remain in Küstrin and began rigorous schooling in statecraft and administration for the War and Estates Departments on November 20.\n\nTensions eased slightly when Friedrich Wilhelm visited Küstrin a year later, and Friedrich was allowed to visit Berlin on the occasion of his sister Wilhelmine’s marriage to Margrave Friedrich of Bayreuth on November 20, 1731. The crown prince returned to Berlin after finally being released from his tutelage at Küstrin on February 26, 1732.\n\nBorn Christian Frederik Carl Georg Valdemar Axel on 3 August 1872 at Charlottenlund Palace near Copenhagen, known as Prince Carl of Denmark (namesake of his maternal grandfather the King of Sweden-Norway) was the second son of (the future) King Frederik VIII of Denmark and his wife Louise of Sweden (She was the only surviving child of Carl XV of Sweden and his consort, Louise of the Netherlands). Carl was also a younger brother of Christian X, a paternal grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark, and a maternal grandson of King Carl XV of Sweden (who was also king of Norway as Carl IV). He was christened on 7 September 1872 at Charlottenlund Palace.\n\nPrince Carl of Denmark\n\nPrince Carl belonged to the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg branch of the House of Oldenburg. The House of Oldenburg had been the Danish royal family since 1448; between 1536–1814 it also ruled Norway when it was part of the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway. The house was originally from northern Germany, where the Glucksburg (Lyksborg) branch held their small fief. The family had permanent links with Norway beginning from the late Middle Ages.\n\nSeveral of his paternal ancestors had been kings of independent Norway (Haakon V of Norway, Christian I of Norway, Frederik I, Christian III, Frederik II, Christian IV, as well as Frederik III of Norway who integrated Norway into the Oldenburg state with Denmark, Schleswig and Holstein, after which it was not independent until 1814). Christian Frederik, who was King of Norway briefly in 1814, the first king of the Norwegian 1814 constitution and struggle for independence, was his great-granduncle.\n\nPrincess Maud of Wales\n\nAt Buckingham Palace on 22 July 1896, Prince Carl married his first cousin Princess Maud of Wales, youngest daughter of the future King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Denmark, eldest daughter of King Christian IX and Princess Louise. Their son, Prince Alexander, the future Crown Prince Olav (and eventually king Olav V of Norway), was born on July 2, 1903.\n\nThe tomboyish Maud was known as “Harry” to the royal family, after Edward VII’s friend Admiral Henry Keppel, whose conduct in the Crimean War was considered particularly courageous at the time. Maud married relatively late, waiting until her late twenties to find a husband. She had initially wanted to marry a distant cousin, Prince Francis of Teck, younger brother of her sister-in-law Mary of Teck, wife of the future King George V of the United Kingdom. Despite being relatively impoverished from mounting gambling debts and being in a position to possibly benefit from Maud’s status, Prince Francis ignored her advances.\n\nPrince Carl and Princess Maud greet Queen Victoria at their wedding.\n\nAfter the Union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved in 1905, a committee of the Norwegian government identified several princes of European royal houses as candidates to become Norway’s first king of its own since 1387. Gradually, Prince Carl became the leading candidate, largely because he was descended from independent Norwegian kings. He also had a son, providing an heir-apparent to the throne, and the fact that his wife, Princess Maud, was a member of the British Royal Family was viewed by many as an advantage to the newly independent Norwegian nation.\n\nThe democratically-minded Carl, aware that Norway was still debating whether to remain a kingdom or to switch instead to a republican system of government, was flattered by the Norwegian government’s overtures, but he made his acceptance of the offer conditional on the holding of a referendum to show whether monarchy was the choice of the Norwegian people.\n\nAfter the referendum overwhelmingly confirmed by a 79 percent majority (259,563 votes for and 69,264 against) that Norwegians desired to retain a monarchy, Prince Carl was formally offered the throne of Norway by the Storting (parliament) and was elected on November 18, 1905. When Carl accepted the offer that same evening (after the approval of his grandfather Christian IX of Denmark), he immediately endeared himself to his adopted country by taking the Old Norse name of Haakon, a name which had not been used by kings of Norway for over 500 years. In so doing, he succeeded his maternal great-uncle, Oscar II of Sweden, who had abdicated the Norwegian throne in October following the agreement between Sweden and Norway on the terms of the separation of the union.\n\nKing Haakon VII of Norway\n\nThe new royal family of Norway left Denmark on the Danish royal yacht Dannebrog and sailed into Oslofjord. At Oscarsborg Fortress, they boarded the Norwegian naval ship Heimdal. After a three-day journey, they arrived in Kristiania (now Oslo) early on the morning of November 25, 1905. Two days later, Haakon took the oath as Norway’s first independent king in 518 years. The coronation of Haakon VII and Maud took place in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on June 22, 1906.\n\nHe became King of Norway when his grandfather, Christian IX was still reigning in Denmark; and before his father and older brother became kings of Denmark. During his reign he saw his father, his elder brother Christian X, and his nephew Frederik IX ascend the throne of Denmark, in 1906, 1912, and 1947 respectively. Haakon died at the age of 85 in September 1957, after having reigned for nearly 52 years. He was succeeded by his only son, who ascended to the throne as Olav V.\n\nWhen doing the post on the accession of Edward I of England I had at first included information on the historic length of his reign. Henry III reigned for 56 years, a record that would stand until the death of King George III in 1820 who had reigned for 59 years. Okay, if we’re counting England, Scotland and the United Kingdom equally, then the record set by Henry III was also surpassed by James VI of Scotland in 1625 who had reigned in Scotland for 58 years.\n\nElizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n\nIt gets confusing doesn’t it? The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as it is today consists of land that was historically separate with a complex history. So when analyzing lengths of reigns I believe it’s necessary to consider the separate nation-States along with the evolution of the lands these monarchs reigned over.\n\nAlthough we consider Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II the longest reigning British Monarch, and she definitely is, she really cannot be considered the longest reigning English or Scottish Monarch because those states no longer exist as separate entities and even though Her Majesty reigns over Scottish and English lands.\n\nI’ll link here why Elizabeth II should not be called the Queen of England or the Queen of Scots for that matter.\n\nElizabeth II is not the Queen of England!!!\n\nSo when determining who reigned the longest within the British Isles it’s necessary to take each political entity separately. Once you determine that you realize there are many states and kingdoms to consider. For example there are the many kingdoms within both England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland that existed before these kingdoms became single united Kingdoms. Then we must consider England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland as separate and independent states. Even the Kingdom of Great Britain and and the United Kingdom need to be dealt with individually.\n\nWilliam I, King of England, Duke of Normandy\n\nWhen examining the Early English kingdoms we recognize that there were four main kingdoms in Anglo-Saxon England:\n\n* East Anglia\n\n* Mercia\n\n* Northumbria, including sub-kingdoms Bernicia and Deira\n\n* Wessex\n\nThe other main kingdoms, which were conquered by others entirely at some point in their history, before the unification of England consisted of.\n\n* Essex\n\n* Kent\n\n* Sussex\n\nEngland could even be further divided as their were at least 15 minor kingdoms, some considered dukedoms, that also existed prior to the unification of England into a single Kingdom under the Wessex dynasty.\n\nSome of these 15 minor kingdoms were:\n\n* Deira\n\n* Dumnonia (only subject to Wessex at a later date)\n\n* Haestingas\n\n* The Hwicce\n\n* Wihtwara\n\n* Kingdom of the Iclingas, a precursor state to Mercia\n\n* Lindsey\n\n* Magonsæte\n\n* The Meonwara, a Jutish tribe in Hampshire\n\nJames I-VI, King of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nIn many cases the information and lists of Kings and their biographies are scant and little known and lost to history. I will not be considering these states in my assessments of the longest reigns within the British Monarchy.\n\nSo here is an official list of the realms I will be considering:\n\nAnglo-Saxon England:\n\n* East Anglia\n\n* Mercia\n\n* Northumbria, including sub-kingdoms Bernicia and Deira\n\n* Wessex\n\n* Essex\n\n* Kent\n\n* Sussex\n\nEarly Scottish Kingdoms\n\n1. Picts\n\n2. Dál Riata\n\n3. Strathclyde\n\n4. Bernicia\n\n5. Northumbria\n\nHenry VIII, King of England and Ireland.\n\nWales has an interesting history. By AD 500, the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rules. The kingdoms were:\n\n1. Gwynedd\n\n3. Powys\n\n4. Dyfed and Seisyllwg\n\n5. Morgannwg\n\n6. Gwent\n\nKingdom of England\n\nKingdom of Scotland\n\nPrincipality of Wales\n\nKingdom of Ireland *\n\nKingdom of Great Britain\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland/Northern Ireland\n\n* A note about Ireland. Prior to the Normandy invasion Ireland was divided into many many smaller kingdoms too numerous to mention. I will however highlight some ancient Irish Kingdoms but mostly this series will focus on the main English and Scottish kingdoms. The history of kingdoms within the Emerald Isle will have its own separate series.\n\nMary I (February 18, 1516 – November 17, 1558), also known as Mary Tudor, was the queen of England and Ireland from July 1553 until her death. She is best known for her aggressive attempt to reverse the English Reformation, which had begun during the reign of her father, Henry VIII. The executions that marked her pursuit of the restoration of Roman Catholicism in England and Ireland led to her denunciation as “Bloody Mary” by her Protestant opponents.\n\nMary was the only child of Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive to adulthood. Her younger half-brother Edward VI (son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour) succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine. When Edward became mortally ill in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he supposed, correctly, that she would reverse the Protestant reforms that had begun during his reign. On his death, leading politicians proclaimed Lady Jane Grey as queen. Mary speedily assembled a force in East Anglia and deposed Jane, who was ultimately beheaded.\n\nMary I, Queen Regnant of England and Ireland. Queen Consort of Spain, Naples and Sicily, Archduchess of Austria, Duchess of Milan.\n\nMary was—excluding the disputed reigns of Jane and the Empress Matilda—the first queen regnant of England. In 1554, Mary married King Felipe II of Spain, becoming queen consort of Habsburg Spain on his accession in 1556.\n\nDuring her five-year reign, Mary had over 280 religious dissenters burned at the stake in the Marian persecutions. After Mary’s death in 1558, her re-establishment of Roman Catholicism was reversed by her younger half-sister and successor, Elizabeth I, daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, at the beginning of the 45-year Elizabethan era.\n\nAfter Felipe II’s visit in 1557, Mary thought she was pregnant again, with a baby due in March 1558. She decreed in her will that her husband would be the regent during the minority of their child. However, no child was born, and Mary was forced to accept that Elizabeth would be her lawful successor. Mary was weak and ill from May 1558.\n\nFelipe II, King of Spain, Portugal, Naples and Sicily, Archduke of Austria and Duke of Milan.\n\nIn pain, possibly from ovarian cysts or uterine cancer, she died on November 17, 1558, aged 42, at St James’s Palace, during an influenza epidemic that also claimed the life of Reginald Pole later the same day. She was succeeded by her half-sister Elizabeth. Felipe II of Spain who was in Brussels, wrote to his sister Joan: “I felt a reasonable regret for her death.”\n\nAlthough Mary’s will stated that she wished to be buried next to her mother, she was interred in Westminster Abbey on December 14, in a tomb she would eventually share with Elizabeth. The Latin inscription on their tomb, Regno consortes et urna, hic obdormimus Elizabetha et Maria sorores, in spe resurrectionis (affixed there by James I when he succeeded Elizabeth), translates to: “Consorts in realm and tomb, we, sisters Elizabeth and Mary, here lie down to sleep in hope of resurrection.”\n\nElizabeth I, Queen of England and Ireland."
