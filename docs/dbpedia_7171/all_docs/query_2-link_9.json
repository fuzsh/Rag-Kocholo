        "text": "Queen Mathilde of Belgium was among the guests at the society wedding of Duchess Marie-Amélie of Württemberg to Baron Franz-Ferdinand von Feilitzsch in Altshausen, Germany, last week.\n\nThe bride, a descendant of one of Germany’s many defunct royal families, was the epitome of elegance in her A-line gown, which was also worn by her mother Princess Wilhelmine Marie zu Wied on her wedding day. The crowning glory was her twinkling Württemberg Diamond Tiara, which has been worn by members of the aristocracy dynasty for more than 60 years.\n\nWhen a German duke married a French princess in a high society wedding sprinkled with Euro royals\n\nRead More\n\nThe duchess is the daughter of Princess Wilhelmine and the late Duke Friedrich of Württemberg, who tragically died in a car crash in 2018. The duke, who was distantly related to the British royal family through a fourth great-grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II, was the heir to the House of Württemberg. He was also related to the Windsor’s through King George V’s wife Mary of Teck, who was born into a branch of the Württemberg dynasty.\n\nAs the father-of-the-bride is sadly deceased, Duchess Marie-Amélie of Württemberg, also known as Amelie, was walked down the aisle by her brother Wilhelm, who succeeded their grandfather Carl as the Duke of Württemberg in June 2022.\n\nThe duchess, a concert violinist, studied at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance and the Royal Academy of Music in London. Little is known about her new husband but he is the son of Baron Louis-Ferdinand Lazarus von Feilitzsch.\n\nRead More\n\nInside Nigeria’s ultra-glamorous royal wedding\n\nYusuf Buhari, son of then president Muhammadu Buhari, married Zarah Ado Bayero, the daughter of the Emir of Bichi, on 23 August 2021 – and no expense was spared\n\nThe couple exchanged vows in a Catholic ceremony at Kirche St. Michael Altshausen, which was adorned with romantic floral arrangements for the occasion. Following the service, the newlyweds left the church arm-in-arm before stopping to share a kiss for the camera. The wedding party processed down a red carpet past officials dressed in traditional costume, to reflect the local culture and heritage of the region. A ball was held at Schloss Altshausen that evening.\n\nSpectacular society weddings run in the family. The duchess’s grandfather Duke Carl of Württemberg met his future wife in 1956, on board a cruise organised by Queen Frederica of Greece, the mother of Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, King Constantine II of Greece, and Queen Sofia of Spain. Princess Diane was the daughter of Henri of Orléans, Count of Paris, the pretender to the throne of France, and his wife, Princess Isabelle of Orléans-Braganza.\n\nRead More\n\nRediscover Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan’s spectacular royal wedding\n\nCrown Prince Hussein, son of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania, married Rajwa Al Saif in a beautiful ceremony on 1 June 2023. Here, Tatler opens their wedding album in honour of the occasion\n\nIn a romantic twist, Carl and Diane’s families became entwined months before their wedding when the princess’s brother, Prince Henri, married Carl’s sister, Duchess Marie-Thérèse of Württemberg.\n\nOn the eve of the wedding, guests including the then Prince Juan Carlos of Spain (future King Juan Carlos I of Spain and father of King Felipe VI) gathered for a spectacular ball to toast the bride and groom. The bride sparkled in the Ruby Tiara and Parure, which proved the perfect accompaniment to a deep pink satin gown. According to the Royal Watcher; her future mother-in-law wore the Württemberg Sapphire Tiara, her sisters dazzled in the Orléans Royal Tiaras; her sisters-in-law were captivating in the Württemberg Royal Tiaras. Other notable attendees included Princess Maria Cristina of Savoy-Aosta.\n\nRead More\n\nWhy Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway’s wedding caused a public backlash\n\nAt first considered a controversial union, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit have lived their royal fairytale for more than 20 years\n\nWhile it wasn’t quite the same royal-studded affair for Duchess Marie-Amélie of Württemberg and Baron Franz-Ferdinand von Feilitzsch; it was still an elegant day to remember."
