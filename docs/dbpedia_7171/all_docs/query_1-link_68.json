        "text": "George I (George Louis; 28 May 1660 – 11 June 1727)[1] was King of Great Britain and Ireland, from 1 August 1714 until his death. He was also a Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBorn in Germany, he eventually inherited control of a large swathe of Lower Saxony, and his domains expanded during his lifetime as the result of a succession of European wars. At the age of 54, he ascended the British throne as the first monarch of the House of Hanover. Though many aspirants to the throne bore a closer relationship to his predecessor, Queen Anne, his mother, Sophia, had been designated heir by the Act of Settlement 1701 because of her Protestant faith. Sophia predeceased Anne by a matter of weeks, leaving the Protestant succession to George. The Jacobites attempted to depose George and replace him with Anne's Catholic half-brother, James, but their attempts failed.\n\nDuring George's reign in Britain, the powers of the monarchy diminished and the modern system of Cabinet government led by a Prime Minister underwent development. Towards the end of his reign, actual power was held by Sir Robert Walpole. George died on a trip to his native Hanover, where he was buried.\n\nGeorge I of Great Britain - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMarriage\n\nThe same year, George married his first cousin, Sophia Dorothea, thereby securing additional incomes that would have been outside Salic laws requiring male inheritance. The marriage of state was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income, and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle. Sophia was at first against the marriage, looking down on Sophia Dorothea's mother (who was not of royal birth) and concerned by Sophia Dorothea's legitimated status, but was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage.[7]\n\nIn 1683, George and his brother, Frederick Augustus, served in the Great Turkish War at the Battle of Vienna, and Sophia Dorothea bore George a son, George Augustus. The following year, Frederick Augustus was informed of the adoption of primogeniture, meaning he would no longer receive part of his father's territory as he had expected. It led to a breach between father and son, and between the brothers, that lasted until Frederick Augustus's death in battle in 1690. With the imminent formation of a single Hanoverian state, and the Hanoverians continuing contributions to the Empire's wars, Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. George's prospects were now better than ever, as the sole heir to his father's Electorate and his uncle's duchy.[8]\n\nSophia Dorothea had a second child, a daughter named after her, in 1687 but there were no other pregnancies. The couple became estranged—George preferred the society of his mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, by whom he had two daughters in 1692 and 1693, respectively;[9] and Sophia Dorothea, meanwhile, had her own romance with the Swedish Count Philip Christoph von Königsmarck. Threatened with the scandal of an elopement, the Hanoverian court, including George's brothers and Sophia, urged the lovers to desist, but to no avail. According to diplomatic sources from Hanover's enemies, in July 1694, the count was killed, possibly with the connivance of George, and his body thrown into the river Leine weighted with stones. The murder was claimed to have been committed by four of Ernest Augustus's courtiers, one of whom (Don Nicolò Montalbano) was paid the enormous sum of 150,000 thalers, which was about one hundred times the annual salary of the highest-paid minister. Sources in Hanover itself, including Sophia, denied any knowledge of Königsmarck's whereabouts.[10]\n\nGeorge's marriage to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, not on the grounds that either of them had committed adultery, but on the grounds that Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her husband. With the concurrence of her father, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in the Castle of Ahlden in her native Celle. She was denied access to her children and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the castle courtyard. She was however endowed with an income, establishment and servants, and was allowed to ride in a carriage outside her castle, albeit under supervision.[11]\n\nhow someone can shut off his children from their mother (and vice versa) is beyond me. was the need for revenge so great that he had to make his whole family suffer like that? did his children ever try to break in to the prison to see their mother?\n\nGeorge I was a cruel man who had no tender feelings for his wife at all. Their marriage was arranged by his mother, who personally hated Sophia Dorothea, but the lure of her inheritance was too great to resist.\n\nSophia never wanted to marry George either, but was forced to do so by her parents, who saw the match as an advantage for their daughter whose legitimacy was questionable.\n\nTheir relationship was cold and unemotional from the beginning and both were very unhappy. After Sophia's \"affair\" was exposed, George divorced her and had her imprisoned, even though he had had affairs of his own for some time. No one really knows if Sophia actually consummated her relationship with Christoph von Königsmarck - that was the presumption at the time.\n\nMost believe her children did not see her again after she was locked away.. and George II hated his father because of it. It was said that George I was furious with his daughter, the Queen of Prussia, when her court wore black mourning after Sophia Dorothea died.\n\nGeorge I only survived his ex-wife by four weeks.\n\nIs there a definitive list of people who had a better claim to the British Throne than George I when he succeeded in 1714? I've worked out a list of my own and have come up with 58 names ahead of him.\n\nWell, George I was the first in the Line of Succession based on the Act of Settlement.\n\nHowever, if we assume the Act was never enforced, then the Line of Succession* to Queen Anne (including those otherwise excluded by the aforementioned Act) in 1714 would include the following people: **\n\n1.

Maria Josepha of Austria (daughter of Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Luneburg)\n\n58. Maria Amalia of Austria (daughter of Wilhelmine Amalia of Brunswick-Luneburg)\n\n59. George I of Great Britain\n\n* A Line of Succession based on male primogeniture, no ban on Catholics, or unequal marriages (which didn't exist in Britain anyway).\n\n** All people are named by the titles and styles they were best known under, and not necessarily those they occupied at the time.\n\nThe succession was not TOO sure when Queen Victoria's father had to scramble to produce an heir, since the last heiress had died. If there were other waiting heirs I suppose the Duke of Kent would not have left his mistress of decades to marry a Protestant princess so that he might have a child when he was over 50, to secure the throne to his immediate family. Now that we see the list of 58 from an earlier generation, we might assume there still were heirs available other than the as-yet unborn Victoria. I believe one of the Duke's brothers also had an heir, in his middle age, but she was younger than Victoria.\n\nHave you ever read the sparse material about the Duke of Kent and his long term Catholic mistress? This couple were faithful to one another for many years but could not marry. I forget her name, except to say that she was descended on her mother's side from the illustrious Colonna's of Italy, who produced two popes, a poet, and many politicians. The poet was Vittoria Colonna.\n\nI read about this couple when I was looking for possible ancestors of myself in the royal lines, even illegitimate, to explain why I have the royal malady Porphyria. I found, thus, the longterm relationship of the Duke of Kent and his mistress, which some sources say produced offspring. The first offspring was Robert Woods, and I too have a Robert Woods ancestor, but reading the genealogy records at the Mormon church nearby (on microfilm) I see that Robert Woods, son of the Duke of Kent, was a generation off from my likely Robert Woods, and there are thousands of Robert Woods, anyway, in the pool--it's a common name. The Duke was supposed to have given his first son to his aide to raise back in Kent, and the son was supposed to have married Charlotte Grey, daughter of Earl Grey (of tea fame). Victoria suppressed knowledge of her father's illegitimate children--also something I read when reading about this--can't vouch for its truth.\n\nHowever, if George III's line completely died out (if none of the 12 people mentioned above left legitimate descendants), and all of them, for whatever reasons, died before 1837, then next in the Line would have been George II's other descendants.\n\nAs of 20 June 1837, they were:\n\n{Part 1}\n\n1.

I also haven't excluded any Catholics that may be on the list.\n\n-- I have included all descendants of morganatic marriages because there is no such thing in Britain: as long as the Monarch gave his/her consent, that's all that mattered. Legitimised children (those born out of wedlock but legitimised by their parents’ subsequent marriage) are not included since they have no rights according to British rules."
