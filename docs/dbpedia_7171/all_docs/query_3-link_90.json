        "text": "Georgian and her George\n\nI don't know I was looking to see who had put the info up to ask what their sources were.\n\nThere may be truth to the fact that there were rumours lol. Need to check the newspaper archives! Email Nicholson Baker, lol\n\nBest Regards\n\nGrey Wolf\n\nI am a Canadian Nakashidze descendant currently in Tbilisi doing family history research, and was even planning a trip to look around sanitorium in Abastumani. I was wondering if anyone has got behind the tales of Marquise de Fontenoy and the elusive \"Markshern7\"? Does anyone still believe that GD George married a Nakashidze?\n\nThis is the most reasonable citation I've found (automatically transcribed from page 5 of the National Tribune, September 6, 1906). That's not to say it's relevant to the question in any way.\n\nAlexander Gregor of Russia who was\n\nquite a brilliant light In diplomatic cir\n\ncles in Washington some years ago is\n\nunder examination for appropriating a\n\ndiamond ring valued at 10000 belong\n\ning to Countess Rodelloo de Porzfqs In\n\nthe course of a visit to Xerstear Castle\n\nBrittany M Greger said that ho had\n\nno knowledge of the presence of the\n\nrtag in his trunk where it wu found\n\nTHE NATIONAL TRIBUNE WASHINGTON D O THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 6 1000\n\nand he believed It was placed there by\n\nsome of the servants The Count and\n\nCountess maintajasd their iisPUbatlorii\n\nEDIT: No wonder I didn't find the source. I was looking in the wrong newspaper!\n\nEDIT: It's actually in the left column of this page.\n\nThanks. Yes, that is one of many \"news\" reports obviously all based on the \"news articles\" written by Marquise de Fontenoy. But are there any other sources that anyone has ever come across that are not based on her?\n\nYeah seconded. There's ABSOLUTELY no poof whatsoever that Grand Duke George ever married, let alone to a Georgian noble. More likely the Duke of Oldenburg did something else to piss off Nicholas II and the Dowager Empress and the Marquise de Fontenoy (who seemed to be a BS queen who had no clue what was really going on) embellished the truth. There's no RUSSIAN source collaborating this piece of fiction, so its obviously false.\n\nSo, I've found more \"info\" that George married, namely from Greg King, author of Tsar: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra who states:\n\n...George's time in the Caucasus, where he was said to have contracted not one but two morganatic marriages, the first with a native Caucasian woman in 1893 shortly after arriving at Abbas Touman. The union, said to have produced a child, was dissolved after two years. In 1894, he was believed to have contracted a second morganatic marriage, this time with a local woman, Mlle. Orkovska, who bore him two sons and a daughter. These children, allegedly given the surname of Romanovsky, as well as firm evidence to support either of the two unions, disappeared after the Revolution.\n\nPlus, from another source:\n\nAlso, in the Enciclopedia Universal Europeo Americana, a very reliable and most detailed encyclopaedia published in 70 volumes in Madrid in 1905-1930, which is full of biographical data on royals, it is said that Grand Duke Georgy Alexandrovich \"married morganatically princess Orkowska, who gave him three children\".\n\nAnother person to also mention George Alexandrovich's marriage is Coryne Hall in her book \"Little Mother of Russia\" on page 176. Ms Hall's book cites a Swedish source for her p.176 allegation. Plus, Pss Catherine Radziwill seems to be passing on some gossip that was near contemporaneous in St. Petersburg at the time about George marrying in her book \"Behind the Veil at the Russian Court\". Which makes me wonder is this a case of \"where's smoke there's fire\"?"
