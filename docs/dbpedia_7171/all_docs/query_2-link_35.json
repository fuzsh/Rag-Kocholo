        "text": "Now that you've emotionally recovered (sort of) from binge-watching Netflix's Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, the regency era spin-off, you might be wondering about the royal family tree that inspired the fictional story. The Netflix show covers young Queen Charlotte (India Amarteifio) and King George III's (Corey Mylchreest) early years of marriage as well as the birth of their first child, George IV. Easy enough to follow, right?\n\nBut the family tree becomes more complicated as time jumps in the show reveal that Queen Charlotte ended up having fifteen children in total. Following the death of her granddaughter, Princess Charlotte of Wales, Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel) scolds her thirteen living, adult children for the dozens of illegitimate babies they had conceived and implored them to find worthy partners to help produce a legitimate heir. Eventually, Prince Edward and his wife tell Queen Charlotte that they are pregnant with her first grandchild, Princess Alexandrina Victoria.\n\nBelow, all of the details you need to know about Queen Charlotte's full family tree, from her marriage to her children and her grandchildren.\n\nQueen Charlotte\n\nBorn: May 19, 1744\n\nDied: November 17, 1818\n\nQueen Charlotte was born Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and she married King George III when she was 17 years old.
