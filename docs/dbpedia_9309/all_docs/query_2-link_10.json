        "text": "Japanese musician\n\nYoshiki Hayashi (Japanese: 林 佳樹, Hepburn: Hayashi Yoshiki, born November 20, 1965), known as Yoshiki[5], is a Japanese musician, songwriter, composer, record producer, film director, and fashion designer. He is best known as the leader of the visual kei rock bands X Japan and the Last Rockstars, for which he is the drummer, pianist, and main songwriter.[6] He has been described by Billboard as a \"musical innovator\"[7] and named \"one of the most influential composers in Japanese history\" by Consequence.[8] Yoshiki's solo career includes several classical studio albums and collaborations with artists such as George Martin, Bono, will.i.am, St. Vincent, the Chainsmokers, Skrillex, Ellie Goulding, Stan Lee, Roger Taylor and Brian May of Queen, Gene Simmons and KISS, Nicole Scherzinger, and Sarah Brightman.\n\nIn 1999, at the request of the Japanese royal family, he composed and performed a classical song at a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement. Yoshiki also composed the theme for the 69th Golden Globe Awards[9][10] as well as for several anime and film soundtracks including Attack on Titan and Saw IV. In 2023, he made his directorial debut with the feature documentary film Yoshiki: Under the Sky.\n\nIn 2023, Yoshiki was selected as the first Japanese artist to be honored with a hand and footprint ceremony at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood in nearly 100 years.[11] In 2024, Variety selected Yoshiki as the International Achievement in Music honoree.[12]\n\nLife and career\n\n[edit]\n\n1965–1982: early years and Dynamite/Noise\n\n[edit]\n\nYoshiki was born on November 20, 1965, in Tateyama, Chiba Prefecture, as the elder of two brothers in a musically oriented family. His father was a tap dancer and jazz pianist, his mother played the shamisen, while his aunt played the koto.[13] He began taking piano lessons and music theory at age four.[14] He then became interested in classical works by Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert.[14] In elementary school, he played the trumpet in the brass band, and around age ten started composing songs for piano.[14] This period was a decisive point in his life. He was 10 years old when his father committed suicide; he found relief in rock music.[15][16] After discovering the music of American hard rock band Kiss, he started learning to play drums and guitar. Yoshiki was also influenced by works from Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Sex Pistols, David Bowie, Queen, the Beatles, Charged GBH and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.[17] Yoshiki formed the band Dynamite with his childhood friend Toshi in 1977. Dynamite changed its name to Noise a year later.\n\n1982–1997: X Japan\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: X Japan\n\nWhen Noise disbanded in 1982, Yoshiki and Toshi formed a new band, which they named X while they tried to think of another name, but the name stuck. In 1986, Yoshiki founded his own independent record label, Extasy Records, in order to distribute the band's music.[18] On December 26, 1987, the band participated in an audition held by CBS/Sony which led to a recording contract in August of the following year. The band's breakthrough came in 1989 with the release of their second, and major debut, album Blue Blood, which reached number six on the Oricon chart and charted for more than 100 weeks.[19][20] In 1990, the band received the \"Grand Prix New Artist of the Year\" award at the 4th Japan Gold Disc Awards.[21] In 1991 they released their hit million-selling album Jealousy, and were the first Japanese metal band to perform in Japan's largest indoor concert venue, the Tokyo Dome. The following year they announced the renaming of the band to X Japan in order to launch an international career with an American album release, however, this ultimately did not happen.\n\n1991–1999: solo work and Eternal Melody\n\n[edit]\n\nThat same year he began his first solo activities outside X. Collaborating with Tetsuya Komuro for the rock unit V2, with a concert on December 5 at the Tokyo Bay NK Hall[22][23] and the single \"Haitoku no Hitomi ~Eyes of Venus~/Virginity\" (背徳の瞳〜Eyes of Venus〜) in January 1992, which reached number two on the chart.[24] On December 12, Yoshiki released his first album, the classical compilation Yoshiki Selection,[25] which includes classical works, and its sequel followed six years later.\n\nIn 1992, he bought a recording studio complex in North Hollywood, California, US. Extasy Recording Studios would become where recordings for nearly all his projects take place, until he sold it in the 2010s.[26][27] In the early 1990s through his record label would debut million-selling bands Glay and Luna Sea. He began learning about jazz improvisation and orchestration.[14]\n\nOn April 21, 1993, he released his first original solo album, the classical studio album Eternal Melody, which was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and produced by the Beatles producer George Martin.[28] Besides including orchestral arrangements of X Japan songs, it contained two new songs as well. The album reached number 6 on the charts.[29] On November 3, the singles \"Amethyst\" and \"Ima wo Dakishimete\" (今を抱きしめて) were released and reached number five and three respectively on the charts.[30] The later single was a karaoke adaptation of the second orchestral song from the first single, but name credit went to TBS as it was the theme song to one of their dramas, recorded by the lead actors under the group name NOA.[31][32] In 1994, it was the 35th annual best-selling single and won the \"Excellence award\" at the 36th Japan Record Awards.[33]\n\nIn 1994, Yoshiki worked with Queen drummer Roger Taylor on a song he composed, \"Foreign Sand\", for which Roger wrote the lyrics. They performed the song at The Great Music Experience event in May,[34][self-published source?] partly backed by Unesco, which featured many other Japanese and Western musicians. The single was released in June, and reached the top fifteen in Japan, and 26th in the UK.[35] That same month, the Kiss tribute album Kiss My Ass was released, for which Yoshiki contributed an orchestral arrangement of \"Black Diamond\" played by the American Symphony Orchestra.[36][37]\n\nWith X Japan's popularity increasing, Yoshiki and the band collaborated with Mugen Motorsports and sponsored racer Katsumi Yamamoto, who drove for team \"X Japan Racing\" in the 1995 season of Formula Nippon.[38] In the 1996 season, they sponsored Ralf Schumacher with both him and the team winning the championship.[39] In 1997, Toshi decided to leave the band, claiming the success-oriented life of a rock star failed to satisfy him emotionally. The band's dissolution was officially announced in September 1997.[40] X Japan performed their farewell show at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997, making it the last of five consecutive New Year's Eve shows in that stadium.[40] Soon afterwards, in May 1998, the band's lead guitarist Hide died, and Yoshiki withdrew from the public scene, as he was battling suicidal thoughts and eventually sought the help of a psychiatrist.[41]\n\nYoshiki remained active as a producer for bands such as Dir En Grey,[27] and contributed a cover song for the 1999 Hide tribute album, Tribute Spirits. On November 12, 1999, a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement was held at the Tokyo Imperial Palace, for which Yoshiki composed and performed the song \"Anniversary\" at the request of the royal family.[42][43]\n\n2000–2009: Eternal Melody II, Violet UK and S.K.I.N.\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the beginning of the 21st century, he expanded his record label with sub-divisions, Extasy Japan and Extasy International in collaboration with Warner Music,[44] and produced several artists. In 2000, he collaborated with 7-Eleven on a series of TV commercials, for which he provided the songs \"Blind Dance\" and \"The Other Side\" by his solo musical project Violet UK.[45] Two years prior, he contributed the song \"Sane\" for the 1998 film In God's Hands.[46][47] The project idea was born in 1991,[48] when Yoshiki was recording in his studio, initially doing sessions with Mick Karn and Jane Child, but it was postponed. The music involves a fusion of trip rock, breakbeat, and classical piano strings.\n\nIn September 2002, he joined the dance-oriented pop group led by Tetsuya Komuro, Globe.[49] Though his only contribution was the single \"Seize the Light\" and, after recording an album, they went on hiatus with Yoshiki not rejoining them afterwards. On December 3 and 4, he held symphonic concerts with the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, at Tokyo International Forum.[50] Featuring female singers Daughter and Nicole Scherzinger, they performed older orchestral arrangements and songs created for Violet UK, such as \"Unnamed Song\", which was composed to mourn the victims of the September 11 attacks,[51] and \"I'll Be Your Love\", which was released the following year as the debut single for American-Japanese singer Dahlia and later used as the official theme song of the world's fair, Expo 2005.[52][53]\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, he provided the theme songs \"Kimi Dake Dakara\" and \"Sekai no Owari no Yoru ni\" for NHK's 50th anniversary commemorative broadcast and the 90th anniversary of Takarazuka Revue.[54][55] In 2004, he helped produce the South Korean rock band the TRAX,[56][57] and his composition \"Tears\" was used as the theme song for the film Windstruck, becoming the first Japanese song to be featured in a Korean film after World War II.[58][59] In 2005, a second classical solo album titled Eternal Melody II was released on March 23.[60][61] The next day, Yoshiki conducted the Super World Orchestra in the opening ceremony of the World's Fair in the performance of a classical version of \"I'll Be Your Love.\"[62] At the end of the same month, a DVD recording of his previous symphonic concert was released.[61] In December, the Violet UK song \"Sex and Religion\" was released via the iTunes Store,[63] and soon afterwards \"Mary Mona Lisa\" unofficially via Myspace.[64]\n\nIn 2006, Yoshiki appeared at the Otakon convention on August 6, where it was publicly announced that he would be forming a band named S.K.I.N. with rock singer Gackt, soon afterwards they were joined by Sugizo.[65] At the JRock Revolution Festival on May 25, 2007, which was organized by Yoshiki, it was announced that Miyavi was joining.[66] There were high expectations for the band, like to be the first Asian band to conquer the world charts, beginning with America,[67] and to lead a rock revolution and starting a new era of rock and roll, by opening the market for Japanese in the Western music industry.[68] But after their debut performance on June 29, 2007, at the Anime Expo in Long Beach, all activities were stopped.[69][70][71]\n\nThat same year he co-produced the soundtrack for the 2007 film Catacombs, which included the Violet UK song \"Blue Butterfly\" and was released by his Extasy Records International.[72][73] On October 22, 2007, X Japan's living members reunited and appeared together for the first time in over 10 years at a public filming of the promotion video for their new single \"I.V.\", which was created for the American horror movie Saw IV and played during the end credits but was not included on the soundtrack album.[74][75][76] On September 20, 2007, at a Catacombs preview in Japan, it was announced that Yoshiki would be producing the 2008 rock musical Repo!

This led to Yoshiki commenting on Twitter that: \"I think it's already trademarked.\" As a result of the band having the trademark for \"X Japan\", it is reported that \"Twitter Japan\" would instead be rebranded \"X Nippon\" instead.[179][180] Yoshiki said in an interview with Consequence that he respected Musk and he felt fans should decide the name of the platform.[181] \"Angel\" was released on July 28.\n\nOn August 2, Yoshiki announced the premiere of the feature documentary concert film Yoshiki: Under the Sky, which is the musician's debut as a film director.[182] Premieres in New York, London, and Los Angeles were also announced.[183] On August 4, 2023, the Last Rockstars released their second single, \"Psycho Love\" and announced a tour of the U.S. and Japan for November.[184]\n\nOn September 14, Yoshiki became the first Japanese artist to be honored with a hand and footprint ceremony at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood since the tradition began in 1927.[185][186] He dedicated it to his parents and former X Japan band members Hide and Taiji.[187] On November 14, Yoshiki received the Icon Award at the Stars Asian International Film Festival in Los Angeles.[188] On November 28, Yoshiki received the MAMA award for Favorite International Artist and performed \"Endless Rain\" with K-Pop artists Tomorrow x Together's Taehyun and Hueningkai, Boynextdoor's Jaehyun, Riize's Anton, and Zerobaseone's Han Yujin.[189][190]\n\nOn January 8. 2024, Sanrio announced that Yoshiki would compose the theme song for Hello Kitty's 50th Anniversary.[191] On March 27, Variety selected Yoshiki as the 2024 International Achievement in Music honoree.[12] On April 16, Yoshiki performed the U.S. National Anthem at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.[192] On July 6, the girl group Bi-ray, produced with Yoshiki, made their debut live performance on NTV's \"The Music Day\" with a preview performance of their first song \"Butterfly\".[193][194] On August 1, Yoshiki announced that he will undergo a critical third neck surgery in October, and that all scheduled musical activities after that will be either postponed or canceled.[195]\n\nInfluences\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen asked what the albums were the most influential for him, Yoshiki named Led Zeppelin IV by Led Zeppelin, Alive! by Kiss and Killers by Iron Maiden.[196] Yoshiki stated he loved \"the punkish elements\" of the albums by Iron Maiden[197] and that their work got him into punk rock.[198][199] He was into punk rock bands from the United Kingdom and Japan such as the Exploited, Chaos UK, Discharge, GISM, and Gauze around 1984.[198] He also cited the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and G.B.H. as his favorite bands.[197]\n\nYoshiki has also named Schubert's \"Unfinished\" Symphony and Beethoven's 5th Symphony as influences.[200] His favorite classical composers also include J. S. Bach, Schoenberg, Berg,[201] Tchaikovsky, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, and Chopin.[200]\n\nHe named John Bonham as his biggest drumming inspiration and cited Cozy Powell as the reason he started to play double bass drums.[202] He also likes Peter Criss,[203] Shuichi Murakami, Jun Aoyama from T-Square,[204] and Minato Masafumi from Dead End.[205] He picked George Winston, Keith Jarrett, Vladimir Horowitz, and Mishiba Satoshi from Kinniku Shōjo Tai as his favorite pianists.[14][206] The Köln Concert by Keith Jarrett inspired him to learn jazz theory and improvisation.[14] He also studied jazz piano under Dick Marx and Shelly Berg.[201]\n\nSongwriting and composition\n\n[edit]\n\nYoshiki composes his songs by hand, writing the score on paper before sharing with band members or collaborators.[207] In the 1990s, he experimented with various aliases on songwriting credits, including fictitious names such as Hitomi Shiratori (X Japan's \"Tears\"), Rei Shiratori (L.O.X.'s \"Shake Hand\"), and Tomomi Tachibana (Shizuka Kudō's \"Shinku no Hana\"), in order to separate his rock image from his \"softer\" works.[208]\n\nHe has composed lyrics and music for numerous artists including Glay (\"Rain\"), Dir en grey, and Seiko Matsuda.[209]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nYoshiki started his charitable work as a result of losing his father to suicide at a young age, saying he wanted to support children who have had traumatic experiences like he did.[210][211]\n\nIn 1995, in response to the Kobe earthquake, Yoshiki held an X Japan's Christmas Eve charity concert in Osaka, and presented the certifications of new pianos to students whose schools were damaged during the earthquake.[212]\n\nIn 2009, he invited 200 young orphans to attend two X Japan's concerts in January in Hong Kong, and donated money to a charity organization for orphans.[213] On March 29 and 31, he visited a town in the province of Sichuan, China, which was devastated by the earthquake in 2008, and donated musical instruments to the schools in the area.[214] He again invited children from the local orphanages in Taipei, Taiwan, to be the special guests in the X Japan's concert on May 30.[215] In 2010, he founded Yoshiki Foundation America, a California non-profit, public benefit corporation with tax-exempt status as a section 501(c)3.[216] On July 1, the foundation hosted a free benefit fan event for charity at Club Nokia, Los Angeles. Beneficiaries included the Grammy Foundation, Make-A-Wish Foundation, and St. Vincent Meals on Wheels.[216] In 2011, to provide aid to the victims of March 11's Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the Foundation in association with Yahoo! Japan organized the Japan Relief Fundraising Auction, and all the benefits were sent to the Japanese Red Cross.[216][217] Yoshiki auctioned one of his Kawai Crystal Grand CR-40 pianos, and with restructuring verification system by Yahoo! Auctions, because offers reached high as $20 million,[218][219] it got sold for $134,931.[220]\n\nIn 2014, Yoshiki Foundation America partnered with the MusiCares Foundation in an auction for a private dinner with Yoshiki. The auction awarded the two highest bidders each with a dinner and raised $62,000 for the Grammy Foundation and MusiCares.[221][222] In 2017, Yoshiki Foundation America donated $100,000 to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts through the MusiCares Foundation.[223] In 2018, the YFA organization donated 10 million yen to assist victims of flooding in Japan,[224][225] and an additional 10 million yen to assist recovery from the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake.[226][227]\n\nIn April 2019, Yoshiki donated $87,900 to Korea for a forest fire accident in Gangwon-do, Korea.[228] In June 2019, Yoshiki visited the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami where he made a $150,000 donation and held a masterclass for students, where he advised the future musicians to \"play every concert as if it is your last.\"[229][230] Yoshiki's efforts were recognized by the renaming of the Frost School of Music Dean's office as \"Yoshiki Dean's Suite\".[231] In August 2019, Yoshiki donated 10 million yen to support victims of the Kyoto Animation arson attack,[232][233] and $100,000 to the Earth Alliance Amazon Forest Fund to prevent destruction of the Amazon Rainforest.[234] In September 2019, Yoshiki donated 10 million yen to support disaster relief in his hometown of Chiba after it was struck by Typhoon Faxai,[235][236] and later volunteered for manual labor at the recovery site when he returned to Japan.[237][238] In October 2019, Yoshiki donated an additional 10 million yen to assist recovery in Japan from Typhoon Hagibis.[239] In December 2019, Yoshiki was named as one of Forbes Asia's 30 Heroes of Philanthropy for his contributions to \"disaster relief, orphanages and treatment for children with bone-marrow disease.\"[240]\n\nIn January 2020, Yoshiki donated $50,000 to the Australian Red Cross to aid bushfire victims and $50,000 to the Rainforest Trust's Conservation Action Fund.[241] In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, he donated $100,000 to the Recording Academy's MusiCares Foundation COVID-19 relief fund,[242] and $24,000 to several Meals on Wheels locations in Southern California.[243] That same month, the musician also donated 10 million yen to the Japan Red Cross in commemoration of the ninth anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake.[244] In April 2020, Yoshiki donated 10 million yen to Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine.[245] In May 2020, Yoshiki explained his charitable activities to The Japan Times: \"If you have a certain influence with people, I think it’s better for you to announce it. By doing so, you can provide awareness of the situation, as well as inform people about charitable organizations supporting the cause, and people may get inspired by your actions as well,\" said Yoshiki. \"The goal is to do as much good as we can for others.\"[210][211]\n\nIn March 2021, the Japanese government awarded Yoshiki the Medal with Dark Blue Ribbon for his charity work through Yoshiki Foundation America.[246] That same month, Yoshiki and MusiCares announced the formation of a $100,000 annual grant to help music creators and industry professionals with programs for depression, anxiety, suicide prevention and awareness, and other mental health concerns.[247] In March 2022, Yoshiki helped raise over US$9 million for humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine after

in October 2020, Kodansha announced Yoshiki's fashion photo book XY, shot at the Paramour Estate in Los Angeles.[277]\n\nOther brands\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2021, French fine crystal manufacturer Baccarat debuted a 180th anniversary version of its Harcourt glass at Paris Fashion Week 2022 designed by Yoshiki.[278]\n\nBusiness ventures\n\n[edit]\n\nYoshiki has launched several business ventures, including music recording, entertainment, wine, energy drinks, fashion, finance, and lifestyle products.[279]\n\nIn 1986 Yoshiki founded Extasy Records in Japan with money he received from his mother when she sold her business,[280] later established Extasy Japan and Extasy Records International, around 2000.[281] He also founded Japanese record label Platinum Records in April 1992 as an affiliate of PolyGram.[26]\n\nIn 1992, Yoshiki purchased One On One Recording, a recording studio complex in North Hollywood from Jim David, renaming it Extasy Recording Studios after his own record label in 1999.[26] He sold the studio in 2012, and it later became 17 Hertz Studio.[282] In April 1998, he bought Brooklyn Recording Studios, which housed the Los Angeles offices of Maverick Records, from owners Madonna and Freddy DeMann. He renamed it One On One South[26] before using it as the headquarters of Extasy Records International.[283] In 2013, Yoshiki bought The Pass, a Los Angeles recording studio previously known as Larrabee East.[284][285]\n\nOn May 15, 2000, Yoshiki invented a method for reproducing mp3 music and holds a patent for compressed music data playback technology.[286][287]\n\nIn 2009, with California winemaker Michael Mondavi, Yoshiki launched a wine brand titled \"Y by Yoshiki\", which consists of a Chardonnay and a Cabernet Sauvignon from a 2008 vintage.[288][289]\n\nIn 2015, the Yoshiki Channel was launched on Niconico Video, a Japanese video platform. The channel streams exclusive live shows and distributes links for movies and magazines.[290]\n\nYoshiki also has his own Hello Kitty product line, named Yoshikitty.[291][292]\n\nYoshiki has partnered with researchers to investigate music as therapy.[293] Yoshiki also has branded MasterCard and Visa credit cards,[294][295] and is an investor in Green Lord Motors.[296][297]\n\nIn May 2022, Yoshiki formed a business partnership with Coca-Cola Japan to create the energy drinks \"Real Gold X\" and \"Real Gold Y\", themed after Yoshiki's connection to rock music and classical music, respectively.[298][299]\n\nIn August 2022, French Champagne house Pommery announced a collaboration with Yoshiki as the brand's first co-release with a celebrity artist.[300][301] In July 2023, Pommery expanded the distribution to Germany after the Champagne set sales records in Japan.[302]\n\nEquipment\n\n[edit]\n\nYoshiki said he considers himself a groove drummer.[303] He normally wears a neck brace when playing the drums; as a result of his years of \"headbanging\" while drumming, he injured his neck and had to undergo surgery.[303][304] In 2015, Yoshiki stated he is more of a songwriter than a drummer.[202]\n\nTama Drums created a custom-made acrylic drum set for Yoshiki to use on stage, the ArtStar series. Yoshiki admitted that the clear acrylic shells are great for appearances, allowing the stage lights to color his drums with varying hues, but are not ideal sound-wise. He explained that the clear drums are difficult to play because they do not have the usual responsiveness of wooden shells and are not very durable; as they require much more physical pounding to deliver a good sound and that causes the heads to be essentially ruined after only a single concert.[202] Yoshiki's live kit uses two 24-inch (610 mm) kick drums, and centers the 14\" snare drum directly in front of him. He usually works with five tom drums: three rack toms with diameters of 12\", 13\", and 14\", and two floor toms with diameters of 16\" and 18\".[305] However, in the studio he uses a limited made titanium kit from Kitano drum called Tama Artstar II \"Titan Body\" with Evans coated heads.[202]\n\nYoshiki usually performs on a Kawai Crystal II Grand Piano CR-40A. Kawai also makes a Yoshiki-model grand piano of traditional wooden design.\n\nHe has a constant numbness of two fingers on his left hand that he says makes it difficult to play piano.[303] He also suffers from chronic tendonitis on his right hand, which may cause him to be unable to play musical instruments in the future.[306]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Yoshiki discography and X Japan discography\n\nSolo studio albums\n\nEternal Melody (April 21, 1993)\n\nEternal Melody II (March 23, 2005)\n\nYoshiki Classical (August 27, 2013)\n\nTours and concerts\n\n[edit]\n\nSolo\n\n[edit]\n\nDecember 3–4, 2002: Symphonic Concert, Tokyo International Forum, Tokyo\n\n2014: Yoshiki Classical World Tour Part 1[108][307]\n\n2016: Yoshiki Classical World Tour Part 2[122]\n\nJanuary 12–13, 2017: Yoshiki Classical Special with Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, Carnegie Hall, New York[129]\n\nAugust 26 and 29, 2017: Evening With Yoshiki, Nagoya, Osaka[308]\n\nJune 24, 2018: Lunatic Fest[309]\n\nJuly 13–16, August 31, September 1, 2018: Breakfast with Yoshiki, Evening with Yoshiki, Tokyo[310]\n\nAugust 9–12, 23–25, 2019: Evening/Breakfast with Yoshiki 2019 in Tokyo[311]\n\nAugust 11–15, 19–21, 26–28, 2022: Evening/Breakfast With Yoshiki 2022 In Tokyo[312]\n\nAugust 5–6, 11–13, 19–20: Evening/Breakfast With Yoshiki 2023 In Tokyo\n\n2023: Yoshiki Classical 10th Anniversary World Tour with Orchestra 2023 \"Requiem\" (Tokyo Garden Theater, Royal Albert Hall, Dolby Theatre, Carnegie Hall)\n\nWith X Japan\n\n[edit]\n\nWith Sarah Brightman\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Hymn: Sarah Brightman In Concert\" - 2019 (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco,[313] Tokyo (Yokohama),[314] and London[315])\n\n\"A Starlight Symphony: An Evening with Sarah Brightman\" - 2022 (Las Vegas and Mexico)[316]\n\n\"A Christmas Symphony\" - 2022 (Japan)[317]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: X Japan § Awards\n\nYear Award Category Nomination Result 1994 36th Japan Record Awards Excellence award[33] NOA: Ima wo dakishimete (今を抱きしめて) Won 2013 Billboard Japan Music Awards Classic Artist of the Year[318] Yoshiki Nominated 2016 Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards Asian Icon Award[121] Won 2021 Medals of Honor Dark Blue Ribbon Award[319] Won 2023 MAMA Awards[320] Favorite International Artist Yoshiki Won 2024 Variety International Achievement in Music[12] Won\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
