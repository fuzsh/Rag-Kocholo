        "text": "Scientists have shed light on what ancient Europeans looked like.\n\nGenetic tests reveal that a hunter-gatherer who lived 7,000 years ago had the unusual combination of dark skin and hair and blue eyes.\n\nIt has surprised scientists, who thought that the early inhabitants of Europe were fair.\n\nThe research, led by the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, Spain, is published in the journal Nature, external.\n\nThe lead author, Dr Carles Lalueza-Fox, said: \"One explanation is that the lighter skin colour evolved much later than was previously assumed.\"\n\nScandinavian links\n\nTwo hunter-gatherer skeletons were discovered in a cave in the mountains of north-west Spain in 2006.\n\nThe cool, dark conditions meant the remains (called La Brana 1 and 2) were remarkably well preserved. Scientists were able to extract DNA from a tooth of one of the ancient men and sequence his genome.\n\nThe team found that the early European was most closely genetically related to people in Sweden and Finland.\n\nBut while his eyes were blue, his genes reveal that his hair was black or brown and his skin was dark.\n\n\"This was a result that was unexpected,\" said Dr Lalueza-Fox.\n\nScientists had thought the first Europeans became fair soon after they left Africa and moved to the continent about 45,000 years ago.\n\n\"It has been assumed that it is something that happens in response to going from Africa to higher latitudes where the UV radiation is very low and you need to synthesise vitamin D in your skin. Your skin becomes lighter quite soon,\" explained Dr Lalueza-Fox.\n\n\"It is obvious that this is not the case, because this guy has been in Europe for 40,000 years and he still has dark skin.\""
