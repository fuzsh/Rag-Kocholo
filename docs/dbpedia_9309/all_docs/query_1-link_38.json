Do so like that start of Over Fussy, do like the way it sounds like it going to be off down the Autobahn in a relaxed kind of way before frantic rantic urgency kicks in like a mob of seagulls after your chips, wing on their wheels, well nothing like that really but it is still early morning here and this is a first taste of the new Hyper Gal album will wake you up and they don’t have Autobahns in Osaka, Japan d othey? Not rantic, they don’t rant and anyway there’s no such word, they do kind of flap, the two of them, a whole song and dance and intense pecking and it is a fine start, well not start, it isn’t the opening track of what, going on last night’s first listen to the whole thing (more on the whole of the album closer to release date) is a fine fine, as good as ever if not more so new album. Not the start, Over Fussy is the third track of the album called After Image than their label SkinGraft are officially announcing with this impressive Organ exclusive this gloriously sunny Friday morning. I still say they sound joyous, inviting, love that start (love the album cover image), frantic and rantic but nothing like that, glorious start to the day.\n\nThe album is out on September 13th, they play the UK in October including a London date of October 25th at the Shaklewell Arms, watch this space…\n\nLinks: Bandcamp / SkinGraft Records / Hyper Insta / Previous Organ coverage\n\nMore under the photo of the two of them…\n\nHere’s the Skin Graft take on things….\n\n“There’s something almost vapor-wave-adjacent about the glorious racket riled up by this pair. The effect of repetition throughout, the way the beat slips in and out of time, is hypnotic” – THE WIRE\n\nSpringing from Osaka, Japan’s cultural center and historical heart, comes HYPER GAL, a two-piece band consisting of visual artist Koharu Ishida on vocals and noise artist Kurumi Kadoya on drums.\n\nThe minimalist duo make maximum impact – stripping music down beyond the bare essentials, to create shimmering, no wave pop from blast beat drums, glittery keyboard loops and ethereal bubblegum vocals – laced with velvet and firecrackers.\n\nOn “After Image” HYPER GAL hold fast to their limited palette, but expand their reach. Working with a canvas larger than ever before, the band fearlessly alternate bold, avant-garde strokes with intimate, deliberate gestures. The result is a new world awash in a sea of endless possibilities – only visible with closed eyes and open ears.\n\n“Blends elements of noise, no wave, pop and blistering punk to create something remarkable and new… Endlessly inventive and challenging” – MAXIMUMROCKNROLL\n\n“These royalty of no-wave-pop don’t blink and their delivery is absolute. An exhilarating, total experience” – NOISE-FI\n\n“Indescribable, just listen to it for yourself. And don’t take any stimulants beforehand, you could end up in the emergency room” – OX FANZINE\n\n“It looks like noise, but there is too much color. Pop, but unsellable. Their music goes beyond barriers, genres and boundaries, as if a virus had been injected into a video game bringing delirious ruin to a perfect world” – SODA POP\n\n“Beautifully crafted, deviant and ideal for those who love off-road adventures…” – MUZZART\n\n“Intensely good. A beautiful challenge, a noise, relentless, not an onslaught, always inviting, like they want to pull you in rather than chase you away. Actually, this is joyous” – THE ORGAN\n\nPreviously\n\nORGAN THING: Japanese experimental two piece Hyper Gal’s Pure album lands via SkinGraft – They’re a beautiful challenge, a noise, relentless, not an onslaught, always inviting, like they want to pull you in rather than chase you away, actually this is joyous…"
