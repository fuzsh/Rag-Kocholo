The correct tag is S.K.I.N..\n\n5) Percussion group based on the North Coast of New South Wales, Australia\n\n1) Deborah Anne Dyer (aka \"Skin\") (born 3 August 1967, Brixton, London, England) was the lead vocalist of britrock band Skunk Anansie.\n\nAfter Skunk Anansie split, Skin released her debut solo album \"Fleshwounds\". The album was toned down from her Skunk Anansie days and seemingly Skunk Anansie fans never took to it. The album wasn't a massive success in the UK but three singles were released from it; \"Trashed\", \"Faithfulness\" and \"Lost\" (a double A-Side with \"Getting Away With It\"). Elsewhere in Europe, the album's success was greater. For example, in Italy it peaked at #6 in the album chart. In Germany, it peaked at #18.\n\nAfter releasing \"Fleshwounds\", Skin went on to perform various solo gigs around Europe. She was also support for the European leg of Robbie Williams' and Placebo's world tours. After touring, she began to record her second album, \"Fake Chemical State\" which was released in March of 2006, preceded by a new single 'Just Let The Sun' on March 6th 2006. The first single from this album was \"Alone In My Room\", a download only track released on November 7th, 2005. \"Alone in My Room\" was also the name given to Skin's first UK solo tour in 2 years, which kicked off in Berlin on 4th November, 2005.\n\nHer second album, Fake Chemical State, was released March 20th, 2006.\n\n2) Skin - British hard rock band fronted by Neville MacDonald with Myke Gray on guitars, Dicki Fliszar on drums and Andy Robbins on bass. http://www.skindex.co.uk\n\n3) Skin is also the name of one of Michael Gira's and Jarboe's projects aside of better known Swans\n\n4) S.K.I.N. is also a new project of former X JAPAN drummer YOSHIKI with former MALICE MIZER vocalist Gackt, LUNA SEA's former guitarist Sugizo and Dué le quartz former guitarist 雅-miyavi-.\n\n5) Skin is a four piece percussion group making groundbreaking grooves that reflect the multicultural society of Australia. They take musical influences from Polynesia, Africa, Asia and more, and create unique rhythms by experimenting with number patterns to make up rhythmic phrases. Some band members also play in Blue King Brown.\n\nShow More\n\nGenres:\n\nAlternative, Rock\n\n1) Solo artist formerly of Skunk Anansie\n\n2) British 4 piece Hard Rock band\n\n3) Swans\n\n4) Japanese \"Superband\" consisting of members of disbanded successful bands.
