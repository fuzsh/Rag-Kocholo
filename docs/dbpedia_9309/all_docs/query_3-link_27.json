        "text": "To the Editor,\n\nSkin bleaching, a multi‐billion dollar industry, 1 , 2 is a growing global public health issue that poses significant risks to consumers and presents dermatologists with challenges. Shah et al. 1 recently addressed this topic, uncovering the variety of skin‐lightening practices and misinformation that pervades social media. Amidst racial injustices and the Black Lives Matter movement wherein many people of color have begun to confront the prejudices in their own communities, furthering the discussion on skin bleaching by exploring its origins and colorism in our society is imperative.\n\nColorism, defined as a system of inequality that grants special advantages to lighter skinned individuals, 3 has historical significance in several regions of the world. In America, colorism dates back to slavery when mixed race children of slave owners and the enslaved were given certain rights of higher classes, deemed smarter, and regarded as more civilized. 4 , 5 Colorism in India is rooted in British colonial rule and perpetuated by the caste system, where lighter skinned individuals were afforded greater privilege, education, and opportunities. 2 , 4 In many African countries, colonialism promoted Eurocentric beauty ideals. Even in Europe, pale white skin was sought after until the mid‐20th century as it signified someone with wealth and status who did not have to labor in the sun. 2\n\nToday, the lasting effects of colorism are seen worldwide and perpetuated by the media. Lighter skin means more success in terms of career, marriage, education, and beauty in countries where skin lightening is a popular cosmetic practice. 2 , 4 , 5 South Asian media culture has reinforced skin tone discrimination by preferentially casting lighter skinned actresses in Bollywood movies, some of whom regularly endorse skin lightening creams. 4 Many have criticized Hollywood for the same issue, where lighter skinned actors/actresses are afforded more privileges than their darker skinned colleagues. This precedent culminates in an unhealthy standard set for children and specifically young girls, who are taught through stereotypes and media that if they are darker skinned they are less beautiful. 5 , 6\n\nNot only does skin tone discrimination cause people of color to turn toward risky skin lightening practices, but it also has detrimental effects on mental and physical well‐being. One study found that darker skinned African American women had significantly more physiological deterioration (found by multiple measures including blood pressure, cholesterol, waist circumference, and fasting glucose) and worse self‐reported health than lighter skinned African American women. 3 Another found that colorism was a significant predictor of negative self‐esteem among Pakistani women. 6\n\nDermatologists have a role in understanding the cultural and historical motivations behind skin bleaching practices and the impact that colorism can have on patients’ mental and physical health. By doing so, they can have honest conversations with their patients about perceived and desired skin tones and take a culturally sensitive approach in educating on the risks of skin bleaching practices. Beyond the scope of the clinic, there are ongoing efforts to raise awareness on the risks of skin lightening and promote the idea that all skin tones should be celebrated, such as with the Dark is Beautiful and Brown is Beautiful campaigns. 5\n\nIn summary, skin bleaching is a common cosmetic practice that has origins across the globe in discrimination and colorism. The preference for lighter skin tones is still evident in today's world and has harmful effects on well‐being. With a deeper and nuanced understanding of colorism, dermatologists can foster a culturally sensitive approach to addressing skin tone concerns with their patients."
