        "text": "Our ethnic origins influence the structure and appearance of our skin. When used in the context of skin, the term ethnicity also refers to the different environmental and cultural factors that impact on skin health and appearance.\n\nResearch in this area focuses on pigmentation. While challenged by both the limitations of categorisation and inconsistent findings, it shows that skin structure and concerns vary according to ethnic group. How we treat and care for skin and the products that we use should reflect these differences.\n\nAll ethnic groups have a similar number of melanocytes in their skin. What differs between ethnicities is the level of melanocyte activity, combined with how the cells are made up and grouped together. It is these differences that result in different shades of skin.\n\nAttempting to alter the shade of your skin can have an influence on its health:\n\nThe desire to tan amongst those with white skin leads to an increased susceptibility to skin cancers.\n\nThe quest of some women with dark skin to achieve culturally prized lighter skin tones can lead to the use of inappropriate, skin-damaging products.\n\nMelasma is a form of hyperpigmentation that appears on the face, generally the cheeks, bridge of the nose, forehead and upper lip and sometimes on other sun-exposed parts of the body, such as the forearms. It is similar in appearance to age spots but the darker affected areas are larger. It is most common amongst dark skinned, Hispanic and Asian individuals: the incidence of Melasma in pregnant Mexican women has been reported to be as high as 80%. Read more about causes and treatment in Melasma.\n\nAtopic Dermatitis is one of the most common diseases of childhood. An increasing problem in Western nations, it affects nearly 1 in 5 children. There is some research to suggest that dark skinned and Asian children are more likely to develop the condition in the first 6 months than their Caucasian and Hispanic counterparts. In one third of children the disease dies out during infancy but, for the others, it can continue into adulthood.\n\nAtopic Dermatitis is thought to be genetic. Research has also shown that children from developed countries living in urban areas where the intensity of pollutants is higher, as well as those living in cold climates, are more likely to develop the condition.\n\nOnce affected, there are a number of reasons why symptoms get worse. Sufferers are known to have a deficiency of important lipids and natural moisturising factors. As a result, their skinâ€™s barrier function is weakened, moisture loss increases and they are prone to dryness and itchy skin. Sufferers are also known to have an irregular immune function, which makes their skin more reactive to the environment and susceptible to inflammation.\n\nThe more skin is itched, the more bacteria is multiplied causing inflammation and further itching which worsens the condition.\n\nCaucasian children tend to get the most trouble on the skin creases where their joints meet (known as flexures) such as the elbows, wrists, behind the knees and fronts of the ankles.\n\nRead more about how to treat and care for Atopic Dermatitis.\n\nSkin care should reflect the individual skin type and condition. If you need further information to help you identify your skin type, and which treatment route to take, the skin test may be a useful diagnostic tool.\n\nThe basic guidelines for keeping skin healthy apply to all skin types and colours. Read more in caring for skin on the body and a daily skincare routine for the face.\n\nAll skin types need careful protection from UV rays, but the level of protection needed ranges according to skin colour. Read more in skin and the sun.\n\nCommon skin disorders can often lead to post-inflammatory pigmentation in skin of colour. It is important to consult a doctor or dermatologist with all skin concerns. Read more about treating and caring for pigmentation concerns.\n\nThose with darker skins should also seek dermatological advice before taking laser skin treatments or having chemical peels given that they are at a higher risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation."
