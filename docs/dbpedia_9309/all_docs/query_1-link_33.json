        "text": "First time-ever vinyl LP release of this steel pan + disco + dub material from the 1970s. This LP version consists of Steel An' Skin's 1979 debut 12\" single Reggae Is Here Once Again, featuring \"Afro Punk Reggae (Dub),\" a fine disco-dub workout (now a worldwide dancefloor favorite), plus tracks from their 1984 album Acid Rain. Three of those tunes, 1980s modern-soul/boogie-influenced \"Lady (Vocal),\" \"Lady (Instrumental)\" and also a typical Steel An' Skin performance \"Burning World\" appear only on this LP version (not on previous CD version). Steel An' Skin was a unit composed of young nightclub musicians born in Ghana, Nigeria, St. Kitts, Trinidad and the UK, who once performed with Ginger Johnson's Afrikan Drummers -- a highlife band under the tutelage of the late Ginger Johnson -- and played at Johnson's Iroko Country Club in Hampstead, London. Steel An' Skin began giving concerts and workshops in London schools, expanding nationwide to prisons, psychiatric hospitals and summer festivals, including the world-famous Notting Hill Carnival. The group combined an admirably brave, open and unironic mix of musical forms with a non-cynical approach to community outreach. Ultra-positive consciousness from Afro-Caribbean London, circa 1979. Features ex-members of the legendary 20th Century Steel Band (one of Grand Master Flash's favorites) sailing Trinidad-wise over gratifyingly intricate African ritual rhythms. Strong vocals compliment reggae, funk, disco and soul influences to form a relentless groove machine. Includes an insert in English and Japanese.\n\nOutstanding steel pan, disco and dub CD + DVD release and the third installment in Em Records' Steel Pan Series. Steel 'N' Skin were an Afro-Caribbean workshop band based in 1970s London, founded by Peter Blackman, featuring ex-members of 20th Century Steel Band (Grandmaster Flash's fave). Comprised of young nightclub musicians born in Ghana, Nigeria, St. Kitts, Trinidad and the UK, the group gave concerts and workshops in London schools, expanding nationwide to prisons, psychiatric hospitals and summer festivals. The group combined an admirably brave, open and unironic mix of musical forms with community outreach, non-cynical and untainted by preachiness or \"social work.\" Gratifyingly intricate African ritual rhythms and strong vocals compliment reggae, funk, disco and soul influences to form a relentless groove machine. This EM reissue consists of Steel 'N' Skin's 1979 debut 12\" single \"Reggae Is Here Once Again,\" featuring \"Afro Punk Reggae (Dub),\" a fine disco-dub workout, plus two tracks from their 1984 LP Acid Rain as well as one unissued track. The documentary DVD by Steve Shaw features perceptive commentary from Steel 'N' Skin's founder Peter Blackman, killer live and rehearsal footage of the band, workshop scenes and devastating views of inner-city Liverpool. Including liner notes written by Peter Blackman, English/Japanese text and rare photos. DVD running-time approximately 34 minutes; All-Region; NTSC."
