        "text": "Before NIVEA Creme's success story could begin, something entirely different had to be invented – Eucerit. Eucerit acts as an emulsifier and combines oil and water into an extremely fine, stable mixture. Fortunately, Dr Isaac Lifschütz had developed this completely new emulsifier by 1911. Dermatologist Professor Paul Gerson Unna admired Dr Lifschütz’s specialist knowledge in this area and presented it to Dr Oscar Troplowitz, chemist and co-founder of Beiersdorf. The latter immediately realised that the water-in-oil emulsion would form the perfect base for a cosmetic skin cream. All they now needed was a name. And to find one, Dr Troplowitz needed to look no further than the cream itself. Once the emulsion was finished, it had a snow white colour. The name NIVEA comes from the Latin words “nix, nivis” and means “snow”. When translated, NIVEA literally means “snow white”.\n\nIt all began in 1911, when the pharmacist and visionary entrepreneur Dr. Oscar Troplowitz recognised the potential in Eucerit, an emulsifier developed by the chemist Dr. Isaac Lifschütz.\n\nEucerit made it possible to bind water and oil into a stable cream, and was first intended for use in the medical field. Dermatologist Prof. Paul Gerson Unna appreciated Dr. Lifschütz’s expertise in his field and introduced him to Dr. Troplowitz, who immediately recognized that the water-in-oil emulsion would make the perfect basis for a cosmetic skin cream. All it needed now was a name.\n\nTo find it, Dr. Troplowitz didn’t need to look any further than the cream itself. Inspired by its snow-white colour, he called it NIVEA – a name derived from the Latin words nix (snow) and nivis (of snow).\n\nFinally, the years of research and creativity had paid off. In December of 1911, NIVEA was launched. The legacy of our first skincare cream was born.\n\nFrom the very start, it was Dr. Troplowitz’s goal to develop high quality products that were affordable to all. With NIVEA’s vast product range, which provides expert care no matter what your skin needs, Dr. Troplowitz’s vision has lived on. And it will continue to for the next 100 years.\n\nNIVEA has been globetrotting almost since the day we were born, thanks to a special skincare ingredient called Eucerit.\n\nInvented by one of NIVEA’s founding fathers, Dr Isaac Lifschütz, Eucerit made it possible for a skin cream to remain stable over time – which lead directly to the creation of NIVEA Creme in 1911. This was the first skincare cream that could be exported around the world without losing any of its quality or consistency.\n\nJust three years after NIVEA Creme made its debut in Hamburg, it was available on every continent, and nearly half of NIVEA’s sales came from overseas. By 1914, our products were produced not only in Hamburg, but also in Buenos Aires, Copenhagen, Mexico, Moscow, New York, Paris and Sydney.\n\nAt the time, this kind of rapid international expansion was unheard of in the skincare industry. We were in uncharted waters – which meant that we often had to employ a little ingenuity when introducing NIVEA to new markets.\n\nIn South Africa, for instance, all our advertising had to appear in not one, but three languages – English, Zulu and Xhosa. In the UK, we needed to replace NIVEA Creme’s blue tin with plastic packaging when we realized that British people associated the aluminum tins with shoe polish.\n\nIn cold countries like Austria, we emphasized our products’ ability to protect the skin from the snow, wind and rain. Meanwhile, the NIVEA Sun range and other products more suited to hotter climates were marketed much more heavily in countries like Australia. All of these practices continue to this day.\n\nToday, NIVEA is one of the world’s most trusted brands. Our products are available everywhere, from the far reaches of the Australian outback to the high altitudes of the Rocky Mountains. Yet most people in the countries in which our products are sold see NIVEA as a local brand, which is surely the highest compliment we could ever hope to receive from our fans. We look forward to bringing NIVEA to you and to people all over the world for the next 100 years and beyond.\n\nBy the 1960s, economic prosperity and rising car ownership saw more and more people take their holidays by the sea, and beach culture boomed. Once again, NIVEA was there to help people make the most of their time in the sun.\n\n“NIVEA caravans” were a common sight at international resorts throughout the 1960s and 70s, and they gave away the now-iconic NIVEA balls to anyone who’d brought a NIVEA sun protection product to the beach. Demand for these balls was so great that sometimes our caravans didn’t even make it to the beach – they’d be mobbed on the street before they could get there!\n\nIt was also around this time that scientists first began establishing the link between sun exposure, skin cancer, and skin damage, such as premature ageing. These discoveries spurred our researchers to develop groundbreaking products that would protect people from these effects, and make it easier to enjoy the sun safely.\n\nOver the next few decades, their breakthroughs led to a number of skincare innovations, including:\n\n• Sunscreens with SPF, or sun protection factor\n\n• Spray-on sunscreen\n\n• Moisturising sun creams, such as the NIVEA Sun Visage range\n\n• Specialised products for children, babies and sensitive skin\n\nThere’s no doubt beach culture and sun products have changed over the years. But NIVEA’s aim has always been the same: to help people of all ages enjoy the sun, wherever and whenever they want.\n\nNow, it’s common to walk into the chemist and see rows of men’s skincare products. But 90 years ago, men’s skincare consisted of little more than soap and water. Yet men have just as many skincare needs as women, if not more.\n\nThere was an obvious gap in the market. So in 1922, we introduced our first product for men, NIVEA Shaving Soap, followed a few years later by our first shaving foam. These products finally gave men the creamier shaving experience they had been searching for.\n\nBut there were more unique needs to address. And in 1980, we set another trend by releasing our alcohol-free After Shave Balm. For the first time, men had an affordable and widely available aftershave that soothed and relieved the irritation of shaving, rather than adding to it. It was an instant success and led to a revolution in men’s skincare.\n\nWhat we had proved was that men really wanted and needed their own products. And in 1986, we granted their wish. No longer would men have to use products that belonged to their wives, sisters or mothers. Now they could use NIVEA for Men, a range of skincare products just for them.\n\nFrom creams to electric razors. From oil control to anti-ageing. From face scrubs to body washes. The line-up of NIVEA for Men products has multiplied since that first jar of shaving soap. And it will continue to evolve as the skincare needs of men evolve.\n\nWorld Premiere from NIVEA - The First Creme with Q10When NIVEA was born 100 years ago, almost all of our research was conducted by just three people: Dr Oscar Troplowitz, Prof. Paul Gerson Unna and Dr Isaac Lifschütz.\n\nThings couldn’t be more different today. We now employ more than 850 scientists, and our Skin Research Centre in Hamburg is recognised as one of world’s most advanced skincare institutes.\n\n“Skin research has always been part of our formula for success,” says Dr Horst Wenck, our Corporate Vice President for Research. “That’s obvious when you look at how we’ve developed.\n\n“One of our first achievements was the development of the stable water-in-oil emulsion, Eucerit, which was the basis for NIVEA Creme. And NIVEA Creme took us into the age of modern skincare.”\n\nOver the years, our dedication to research led to many skincare advances that are taken for granted today. Skin cream, body lotion, SPF sunscreen, alcohol-free aftershave, the pump-action spray, skincare for mature skin, anti-ageing products with Q10 – all these and more were launched by NIVEA.\n\nBut before you can invent groundbreaking products like these, says Dr Wenck, you have to ask the right questions.\n\n“On one hand, we look at consumer preferences – what are people’s skincare expectations and needs? On the other hand, we conduct research into every single aspect of the skin. So based on what we know about the skin, we ask: what will support or stimulate the skin’s natural processes?\n\n“The combination of these two aspects makes it possible for us to create new and genuinely innovative skincare products.”\n\nDeveloping a new product is a painstaking process that requires years of research. Because while we all want products that make us feel good in our skin, our individual skincare needs are determined by many factors – including our skin type, race, gender, age and culture, as well as where we live.\n\nThat’s why every NIVEA product is tested on many different people, in a wide range of situations, before it goes on sale.\n\nOn top of this, all of our products must withstand a barrage of safety and effectiveness tests. Even seemingly minor details, such as how easily a product can be opened or closed, face extensive testing.\n\nAnd because we’re against all forms of animal testing, all of our research is carried out on our wonderful volunteer testers, or by using advanced lab techniques like cell culture tests.\n\nAs Dr Wenck said, “It can take three, five, or more years from the initial product idea to its market launch. You can’t compromise on quality.”\n\nAccording to Dr Wenck, the future of skincare promises to be “just as exciting as the last 100 years have been. We’re already working on a new generation of active ingredients that will take skin research into the next dimension.”\n\nWhat will be the next skincare breakthrough? Only time will tell…\n\nFor 100 YEARS we have created skincare products which means NIVEA understands skin like no one else, for any person, male or female and for any skin type – NIVEA for life.\n\nOur skin lets us feel the breeze of the wind, the warmth of the sun and the touch of the people we love.\n\nOur skin tells others how we feel. We blush when we are paid a compliment. We get goose bumps when we are frightened. And our skin is never more radiant than when we are happy.\n\nNIVEA understands skin like no one else. That’s why we create products that cleanse, nourish and protect your skin, while giving it exactly what it needs – gentle yet effective care that keeps your skin smooth, supple and radiantly beautiful.\n\nNo matter what you do, or where you live, we’re here to help you enjoy better skincare for life.\n\nWhether you’re male or female.\n\nYoung or old.\n\nFair or dark.\n\nOily or dry.\n\nSensitive or normal.\n\nOr anything in between.\n\nWe care for all your skin.\n\nFor life."
