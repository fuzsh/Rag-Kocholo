        "text": "Celebrity SkinStudio album by ReleasedSeptember 8, 1998RecordedApril 1997 – February 1998StudioConway Recording Studios (Los Angeles)\n\nRecord Plant West (Los Angeles) Quad Studios (New York City)\n\nOlympic Studios (London)Length50:28LabelDGC, Geffen\n\nCelebrity Skin is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Hole. Billy Corgan co-wrote the arrangements for five of the songs and played bass on three. As a member of Hole, former Smashing Pumpkins bassist Melissa Auf der Maur performs on the album as well.\n\nBackground[edit | edit source]\n\nThe original plan was to have Corgan as executive producer, who was a second choice after Brian Eno,[1] however, Corgan did not initially participate in, or contribute to the recording process.\n\nAccording to Courtney Love, her vision for the album was to \"deconstruct the California Sound\" in the L.A. tradition of bands like The Doors, The Beach Boys and The Byrds,[2] but she was struggling with the composition of the record and felt like she was \"in a rut\".[2] After sending early recordings of the songs to Billy Corgan, Corgan joined the band in the studio for a total of twelve days.[2] Love compared Corgan's presence in the studio to \"a math teacher who wouldn't give you the answers but was making you solve the problems yourself\",[2] and stated that he had her study key changes as well as melodies and phrasing from songs by Frank Sinatra and The Beatles:[2]\n\nWhat [Billy's] great at for me— what he did for me has nothing to do with Eric and Melissa. It has to do with me. I was in a rut, I could not even get out of bed. I didn't want to make this record, I didn't want do anything. I was dull, my blade was not sharp, and he's probably one of the only people on the planet that can challenge me. My craft was at this place and Eric and Melissa and Patty couldn't help me; they all have brilliance and craft, but because I'm in a band within a family context with them, they weren't outsiders enough to really just help me.[2]\n\nOf the album's twelve tracks, Corgan shares instrumental songwriting credits on five.[3]\n\nTrack listing[edit | edit source]\n\nAll lyrics by Courtney Love.\n\nNo.TitleMusicLength1.\"Celebrity Skin\"\n\nCourtney Love\n\nEric Erlandson\n\nBilly Corgan\n\n2:422.\"Awful\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nMelissa Auf der Maur\n\nPatty Schemel\n\n3:163.\"Hit So Hard\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nCorgan\n\n4:004.\"Malibu\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nCorgan\n\n3:505.\"Reasons to Be Beautiful\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nAuf der Maur\n\nCharlotte Caffey\n\nJordon Zadorozny\n\n5:196.\"Dying\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nCorgan\n\n3:447.\"Use Once & Destroy\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nAuf der Maur\n\nSchemel\n\n5:048.\"Northern Star\"Erlandson4:589.\"Boys on the Radio\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nAuf der Maur\n\n5:0910.\"Heaven Tonight\"Erlandson3:3111.\"Playing Your Song\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nAuf der Maur\n\n3:2112.\"Petals\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nCorgan\n\n5:29Total length:50:23\n\nJapanese bonus trackNo.TitleWriter(s)Length13.\"Best Sunday Dress\"\n\nLove\n\nErlandson\n\nKat Bjelland\n\n4:25Total length:54:48\n\nRelease history[edit | edit source]\n\nReleased Label Catalog ID Format Country External sites September 2, 1998 Geffen MVCF-24035 CD Japan [1][2] September 7, 1998 Geffen GED 25164 CD UK & Europe [1] September 8, 1998 DGC DGCD-25164 CD US [1]\n\nCharts[edit | edit source]\n\nCertifications[edit | edit source]\n\nCertifications for Celebrity Skin Region Certification Certified units/sales Australia (ARIA)[26] 2× Platinum 140,000^ Canada (Music Canada)[27] Platinum 100,000^ New Zealand (RMNZ)[28] Gold 7,500^ United Kingdom (BPI)[29] Gold 100,000^ United States (RIAA)[30] Platinum 1,000,000^\n\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\n\nReferences[edit | edit source]\n\n[edit | edit source]"
