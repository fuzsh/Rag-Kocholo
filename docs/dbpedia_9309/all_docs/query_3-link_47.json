        "text": "South Africa is marketed to the world as Mandela's rainbow nation, where everyone is proud of their race and heritage. But for some black South Africans there is such a thing as being too black.\n\nA recent study by the University of Cape Town suggests that one woman in three in South Africa bleaches her skin. The reasons for this are as varied as the cultures in this country but most people say they use skin-lighteners because they want \"white skin\".\n\nLocal musician Nomasonto \"Mshoza\" Mnisi, now several shades lighter, says her new skin makes her feel more beautiful and confident.\n\nShe has been widely criticised in the local media and social networking sites for her appearance but the 30-year-old says skin-bleaching is a personal choice, no different from breast implants or a having nose job.\n\n\"I've been black and dark-skinned for many years, I wanted to see the other side. I wanted to see what it would be like to be white and I'm happy,\" she says candidly.\n\nOver the past couple of years Ms Mnisi has had several treatments. Each session can cost around 5,000 rand (Â£360; $590), she tells the BBC.\n\nUnlike many in the country, she uses high-end products which are believed to be safer than the creams sold on the black market but they are by no means risk-free, doctors say.\n\n\"Yes, part of it is a self-esteem issue and I have addressed that and I am happy now. I'm not white inside, I'm not really fluent in English, I have black kids. I'm a township girl, I've just changed the way I look on the outside,\" she says.\n\nThe dangers associated with the use of some of these creams include blood cancers such as leukaemia and cancers of the liver and kidneys, as well as a severe skin condition called ochronosis, a form of hyper-pigmentation which causes the skin to turn a dark purple shade, according to senior researcher at the University of Cape Town, Dr Lester Davids.\n\n\"Very few people in South Africa and Africa know the concentration of the toxic compounds that are contained in the products on the black market and that is concerning. We need to do more to educate people about these dangerous products,\" says Dr Davids.\n\nHe says over the past six years there has been a significant increase in the number of skin lighteners flooding local markets, some of them legal and some illegal. This is what prompted their research.\n\nLocal dermatologists say they are seeing more and more patients whose skin has been damaged by years of bleaching - most of the time irreversibly.\n\n\"I'm getting patients from all over Africa needing help with treating their ochronosis. There is very little we can do to reverse the damage and yet people are still in denial about the side-effects of these products,\" says Dr Noora Moti-Joosub.\n\nIn many parts of Africa and Asia, lighter-skinned woman are considered more beautiful, are believed to be more successful and more likely to find marriage.\n\nThe origin of this belief in Africa is not clear, but researchers have linked it to Africa's colonial history where white skin was the epitome of beauty.\n\nSome have also suggested that people from \"brown nations\" around the world tended to look down upon dark-skinned people.\n\nMr Marcelle - known in this busy community as Africa's Michael Jackson - says his mother used to apply creams on him when he was young in order to make him appear \"less black\".\n\n\"I like white people. Black people are seen as dangerous; that's why I don't like being black. People treat me better now because I look like I'm white,\" he adds.\n\nEntrenched in the minds of many Africans from a young age is the adage \"if it's white, it's all right\", a belief that has chipped away at the self-esteem of millions.\n\nUntil this changes, no amount of official bans or public information campaigns will stop people risking serious damage to their health in the pursuit of what they think is beauty."
