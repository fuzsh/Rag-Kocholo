        "text": "Futuristic '80s movies predicted 2019 would be complete with flying cars, robotic clothing, and incredibly realistic holograms — and that vision becomes a reality every time Perfume takes the stage. Their electro-pop tunes, hi-tech sets, light-up dresses, and bionic-like choreography brings the futuristic fantasy to life. Coachella 2019 was no exception. Back in April, Perfume was officially the first Japanese girl group to perform at the music festival.\n\nThe group may be making history in America, but Perfume has been in the music game since the early 2000s. A-Chan, Nocchi, and Kashiyuka formed their trio as high schoolers in Hiroshima and rose to fame in 2007. For nearly two decades, they've consistently delivered two major things I look for in a girl group: signature looks and concerts that double as spiritual experiences.\n\nWhile in New York City on their recent world tour, I got to sit down with Perfume to talk about all things beauty, including, but not limited to, well, perfume. Honestly, I wish this was a video interview because A-chan had me cracking up with dramatic reenactments of her most prominent scent-related memories and dream beauty technology devices. Alas, I'll do my best to use my words to describe both instances and the rest of my time with the group.\n\nPerfume's signature looks\n\nFor those unacquainted with Perfume, one of the group's defining aspects is its members' individually distinct aesthetics. Since around 2007, all of them have stuck to specific hairstyles. I recently saw a photo of them from 2011 and could have sworn it was taken this year. That's how stringently the trio has adhered to their looks.\n\nNocchi always has a chin-length bob. \"At one point, I actually had long hair,\" she recalls. \"But I saw a picture of all three of us lined up and thought it was a little too heavy, so I decided to cut my hair.\" Nocchi loved the result so much that she's kept it up ever since. Every three weeks, she gets her bob cut to keep it short and sleek. When my eyes widen at her trim frequency, she asks if that's a lot. My hair is a similar length, so I tell her I often get too lazy and only go to the salon every two months or so. \"I’m like that a little bit, too,\" she admits.\n\nAs for Kashiyuka, \"I’m the one with the bangs and super straight, long hair,\" she says. When she says long, she means waist length. It's as majestic in person as you could imagine. Surprisingly, Kashiyuka says she uses the same amount of shampoo as everyone else. However, she estimates that she requires one more pump of hair treatment than the average person. The drying process takes about 30 minutes, and at night, Kashiyuka ties her hair into a low bun to protect it from damage. Her blunt bangs require a considerable amount of maintenance, too. Every two weeks, she gets them trimmed.\n\nUnlike the other members, A-Chan usually adds texture to her hair. \"Ever since elementary school, I had permed hair,\" she shares, adding that she'd pay for the treatment herself. \"My hairstylist recently told me to keep it straight, so now, he curls it.\" You can also catch A-Chan with a ponytail most of the time. In case you were wondering, yes, they do give her headaches. \"But if you’re a star, you can’t say that,\" she jokes.\n\nAnother beauty tool Perfume loves is an electronic brush that helps lift your face, as described by A-Chan. She bought it before Kashiyuka and Nocchi followed suit. \"Even though it’s expensive, it’s worth it,\" A-Chan says.\n\nIf they could invent their own beauty technology, Kashiyuka would create a bar that hangs from her bedroom door, which sprays sunscreen all over her body when she walks through it. A-Chan has a slight modification, though. She stands up to demonstrate the downsides of Kashiyuka's SPF bar and how to improve it. \"If you just walk through it, the sunscreen won’t get on you evenly,\" A-Chan explains. \"We’ll make it a frame, so you get it from all directions.\" Count me in.\n\nPerfume's scent memories\n\nOf course, I had to ask if any specific fragrances trigger memories for the ladies of Perfume. The question may be over-asked, but they've surprisingly never answered it for an English interview.\n\nImmediately, A-chan calls out Gucci Guilty. The manager they had while they were in high school drove a motorcycle and regularly doused himself with the iconic eau de toilette. After work, \"He would leave on his bike, and the only thing he'd leave behind was the Gucci perfume scent,\" A-Chan recalls, acting out her old manager zooming off into the sunset and leaving a dizzying cloud of patchouli and pink pepper in his wake. \"You could tell where our manager was because he'd leave the scent there.\"\n\nThe smell of a newly built house or building brings Nocchi back to being a 15-year-old moving into her first Tokyo dorm, which had just been constructed. Kashiyuka reveals that she doesn't have a particular scent-based memory. A whiff of osmanthus brings her joy, nonetheless.\n\nThe group also recently released a hand cream perfectly named Perfume of Perfume with a spicy lemongrass scent that's close to their hearts. \"This smells exactly like the oil that we put on before the show to give us confidence,\" A-Chan explains, holding up the small white-and-black tube. \"We wanted to give the users and our fans a little push on the back for every day.\"\n\nPerfume's Skin-Care Routines\n\nAnother topic Perfume has yet to discuss — even with each other — is the exact steps of their skin-care routines. Each of them follows regimens that are six to seven steps depending on the time of day. The trio also tends to seek out organic products, according to A-Chan. Their makeup artist swears by them, and seeing how amazing her skin looks inspired the members of Perfume to go organic too. Surprisingly, A-Chan says the U.S. is more advanced with its all-natural skin-care offerings. \"Everyone gets them here,\" A-Chan adds. \"It’s like an organic paradise.\"\n\nA-Chan's routine, in particular, starts off with eye makeup remover. Then, she moves on to double cleansing followed by a \"softener,\" which she leaves on for three minutes. I'm unsure why she washes it off, though, as softeners are usually essence-like — I'm guessing A-Chan uses one that's gently exfoliating. After rinsing off said softener, she slathers on a serum spiked with either ceramides or vitamin C. (If she could only use one skin-care product for a week, it would be the ceramide one.) Next, come toner and a milky lotion. \"If I’m in a good mood, I’ll do a mask,\" A-Chan adds.\n\nKashiyuka also starts her regimen with eye makeup remover. However, she only washes her face once, typically with a gel cleanser. Then, she pats on some toner. At night, oil and cream are later layered on. In the morning, she skips the oil and goes straight for the cream. \"Simple,\" she tacks on at the end before telling me about a J-beauty product I've never heard of before \"There’s a lotion called sun care lotion,\" she says. \"It’s not exactly sunscreen, but if you use it on daily basis, it protects your skin from UV light. I do that during the day.\" Excuse me while I look into this.\n\nLast, but not least, Nocchi approaches her combination skin like so: Eye makeup remover, oil cleanser, and toner. She always swears by a certain serum. \"There’s serum that balances out the oil and the water of your skin,\" she says. Next, Nocchi slaps on a face mask while she dries her hair. After she's done, she smears on oil — \"a lot of oil,\" Nocchi emphasizes. Finally, she puts on a cream."
