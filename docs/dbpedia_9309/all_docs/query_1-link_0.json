However, massive interest led to flooding of the servers, causing them to crash, and in a few hours ticket res ervations were temporarily stopped. On Thursday night of June 28, Skin performed for the first time at Long Beach Arena, supported on bass by Ju-ken, at the time a member of Gackt's live band. The concert began almost two and a half hours late, for unknown reasons. They performed around five songs, of which four were \"Gei-Sha\", \"Killing you softly\", \"Beneath The Skin\", \"Violets\", and most lyrics were in English. During the intermediate of the performance of \"Beneath The Skin\", Gackt and Yoshikiboth played piano, Sugizo was on violin and Miyavi played the traditional Japanese shamisen. At the end, Gackt announced that they would meet again."
