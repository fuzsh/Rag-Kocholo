Formed in Los Angeles, California in 2007, it includes Gackt, Miyavi, Sugizo and Yoshiki.\n\nI think it may be these?\n\nnever heard of them in my life! i shall have to investigate.\n\nMr eFestivals, any knowledge on the fact that Clutch have self-confirmed on myspace but they're on here as a rumour for Bloodstock?\n\nPLEASE let them be at Download!\n\nWould get interesting if S.K.I.N, Skin, AND Skin (skunk anansie) were ALL playing.... ok confusing more like. As there's so many diff ones are you sure it's the Japanese band? As as far as i'm aware they're not in the country at that point.\n\nI'm sure I saw Skin (90's band) play in a pub in Dundee.... years ago... I think..\n\nDid they have a song called Money??\n\nI doubt they'll get announced tonight\n\nThey haven't been announced for anything else yet\n\nIt will probably be the same acts that have already been announced for other European rock festivals in June, its been the patern so far"
