I'm thinking Gackt will more than likely be the vocalist, but that doesn't mean that Miyavi can't take the role of back up screamer

Gackt is the main vocalist. I am so happy!

They picked a cool name for their new band.

Skin....

I like it!

My dreams are nightmares, my life is pain, but because of this I have everything to gain.

Yes. It is officially true! They are debuting at the Anime Expo on June 29th. They will then tour the US, and then they will go to Japan. Maybe they'll tour somewhere close to Ohio. I hope so...

I wish I could be there for their first performance.....
