up on the rumours page its gone up as S.K.I.N. as to be confirmed

does anyone no if this is S.K.I.N the old rock band which spilt in 1998??

Skin (or S.K.I.N.) is a supergroup consisting of several Japanese rock musicians. Formed in Los Angeles, California in 2007, it includes Gackt, Miyavi, Sugizo and Yoshiki.

I think it may be these?

never heard of them in my life! i shall have to investigate.

Mr eFestivals, any knowledge on the fact that Clutch have self-confirmed on myspace but they're on here as a rumour for Bloodstock?

PLEASE let them be at Download!

Would get interesting if S.K.I.N, Skin, AND Skin (skunk anansie) were ALL playing.... ok confusing more like. As there's so many diff ones are you sure it's the Japanese band? As as far as i'm aware they're not in the country at that point.

I'm sure I saw Skin (90's band) play in a pub in Dundee.... years ago... I think..

Did they have a song called Money??

I doubt they'll get announced tonight

They haven't been announced for anything else yet

It will probably be the same acts that have already been announced for other European rock festivals in June, its been the patern so far
