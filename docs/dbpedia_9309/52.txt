1) Deborah Anne Dyer (aka "Skin") (born 3 August 1967, Brixton, London, England) was the lead vocalist of britrock band Skunk Anansie.

After Skunk Anansie split, Skin released her debut solo album "Fleshwounds". The album was toned down from her Skunk Anansie days and seemingly Skunk Anansie fans never took to it. The album wasn't a massive success in the UK but three singles were released from it; "Trashed", "Faithfulness" and "Lost" (a double A-Side with "Getting Away With It"). Elsewhere in Europe, the album's success was greater. For example, in Italy it peaked at #6 in the album chart. In Germany, it peaked at #18.

After releasing "Fleshwounds", Skin went on to perform various solo gigs around Europe. She was also support for the European leg of Robbie Williams' and Placebo's world tours. After touring, she began to record her second album, "Fake Chemical State" which was released in March of 2006, preceded by a new single 'Just Let The Sun' on March 6th 2006. The first single from this album was "Alone In My Room", a download only track released on November 7th, 2005. "Alone in My Room" was also the name given to Skin's first UK solo tour in 2 years, which kicked off in Berlin on 4th November, 2005.

Her second album, Fake Chemical State, was released March 20th, 2006.
