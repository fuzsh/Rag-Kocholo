        "text": "The Predator franchise has only gotten bigger and better in recent years. A science fiction action horror franchise centered on human interaction with a highly intelligent extraterrestrial race that loves to hunt. Produced by 20th Century Studios, the studio has been wanting to expand the franchise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter 2022 critically acclaimed Prey, the studio is reportedly eyeing Elle Fanning for the franchise’s upcoming flick, Badlands. However, fans are not sure about a female-led Predator movie seeing the box office disaster that Anya Taylor-Joy-led Furiosa has turned out to be despite brilliant critical reviews.\n\nPredator Franchise Reportedly Eyeing Elle Fanning as Its New Lead\n\nIt was announced earlier this year that 20th Century Studio was reportedly expanding its Predator universe by roping in Dan Trachtenberg as the writer and director of their newest standalone flick in the franchise, Bandlands. A priority for the studio apparently, Deadline recently reported that the studio is in negotiations with Elle Fanning as the movie’s lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCo-written by Trachtenberg and Patrick Aison, the details for the upcoming movie are yet to be revealed. However, it seems the studio is keen to make more female-led movies in the franchise after giving Amber Midthunder the lead in the critically acclaimed 2022 entry of the franchise, Prey.\n\nAlthough Midthunder was a relatively unknown star at that point, Fanning is a brilliant actress who has starred in several acclaimed projects. Furthermore, Fanning is also said to be a fan of the franchise, and hence, to have a more established star lead the franchise, the actress is said to be the perfect choice.\n\nAs per Deadline, Fanning leading the standalone flick is not confirmed as the negotiations are still going on. While we await for an official confirmation, some fans are not convinced that we need another female-led action movie seeing how Furiosa has been faring at the global box office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuriosa’s Box Office Performance Has Fans Worried for Badlands\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy‘s Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is the prequel to the Oscar-winning Mad Max: Fury Road. Premiering with brilliant critical and audience ratings, the movie has so far been failing at the global box office, having just accumulated a total of $114 million worldwide (via Box Office Mojo). A disappointing feat for a movie as grand as Furiosa, its box office performance has left fans of the Predator franchise worried, many of whom blame Taylor-Joy for its failure.\n\nThe franchise’s last flick, Prey was one of the best movies ever made despite starring a female in the lead and broke countless streaming records as per Deadline. With a sequel to the Amber Midthunder-starrer movie said to be in the works, Elle Fanning leading another standalone movie in the franchise has made fans worried seeing how Furiosa’s box office gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Elle Fanning being an incredibly talented actress with a strong filmography, fans are not convinced that now is the time to make another girl boss movie, especially in a franchise like Predator.\n\nWhether or not Badlands turns out like Furiosa, only time will tell. For now, we can only wait and watch!\n\nAdvertisement"
