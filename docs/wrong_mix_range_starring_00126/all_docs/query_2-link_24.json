        "text": "We have learned that Amber Midthunder has been cast in 20th Century Studios’ upcoming Predator film, which is about to begin filming in Calgary, Alberta. Sources say that she will play the lead role in the film.\n\nAmber Midthunder is an up-and-coming Native American actress, perhaps most known to fandom for her role as Kerry Loudermilk in Marvel and FX’s Legion. She currently stars in a series regular role as Rosa Ortecho in The CW’s Roswell, New Mexico. She is no stranger to sci-fi, as the show follows humans who help special aliens live undercover in a small rural town.\n\nMidthunder will next appear in Jonathan Heinsleigh’s The Ice Road starring Liam Neeseon, Holt McCallany, and Laurence Fishburne. After a remote diamond mine collapses in the far northern regions of Canada, an ice driver plots an impossible rescue mission over a frozen ocean to save the lives of the trapped miners. The Ice Road will hit Netflix on June 25.\n\nFollowing the success of 10 Cloverfield Lane, director Dan Trachtenberg’s take on Predator has been in the works since 2016 – long before the last film by Shane Black ever released. We have been following the project since late-2019, as we discovered the film’s title under the code name Skulls. Although, it seems they are still keeping this working title, which could suggest that Skulls may actually be what it’s called, but that’s just a guess for the time being.\n\nThis new Predator film is set to follow a Comanche woman who goes against the gender norms and traditions of her tribe to become a warrior. No other plot details or a potential release date are known yet, despite principal photography very close to beginning.\n\nPatrick Aison is writing the screenplay. He has previously been a co-executive producer for USA’s Treadstone, supervising producer/writer for Amazon’s Jack Ryan and a consultant for Legion – tying back to Midthunder’s involvement.\n\nJohn Davis will produce the film under the Davis Entertainment production banner. He has previously produced Chronicle, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., The Predator, Shaft, and Dolemite Is My Name. He also recently produced Dwayne Johnson’s Jungle Cruise for Disney.\n\n20th Century Studios will develop and distribute the film, one of their first projects since the Disney/Fox acquisition finalized back in 2019. 20th Century are currently in the final stages of filming a Home Alone reboot for Disney+, as well as in the midst of filming James Cameron’s various Avatar sequels, with the first set to release in theaters on December 16, 2022. The studio also recently wrapped filming on Ridley Scott’s The Last Duel, set for a theatrical release this October.\n\nMore notably, 20th Century just created major buzz by releasing the first trailer for West Side Story during the 2021 Oscars, which is expected to release in theaters later this December. Both of these films are expected to be 20th Century Studios’ major pushes for the next awards season.\n\n20th Century Studios is yet to respond to comment.\n\nGet all the major release dates for 2021 and beyond!"
