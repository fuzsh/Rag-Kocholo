        "text": "After Prey revitalized the Predator franchise in 2022, there's a new movie on the way. Prey director Dan Trachtenberg is set to return to the Predator universe with his next film, Badlands. And the standalone movie already has a star lined up with Elle Fanning.\n\nDeadline broke the story and revealed that Fanning is a fan of the Predator franchise. That helped the actress land a meeting with Trachtenberg and score a leading role. The report notes that Fanning hasn't closed her deal with 20th Century Studios yet. But assuming she does, Badlands may begin filming as soon as this year.\n\nFanning previously played Princess Aurora in Disney's Maleficent and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil. Some of her other credits include Super 8, The Neon Demon, The Beguiled, and 20th Century Women. She also starred in Hulu's The Girl from Plainville and The Great.\n\nIt's currently unknown if Badlands will also premiere as a Hulu exclusive or if it will follow in the footsteps of Alien: Romulus and bring the Predator franchise back to the big screen. No details about the plot or premise of Badlands have been revealed beyond the connection to the Predator franchise.\n\nIntriguingly, Deadline's report notes that Prey 2 remains in development with Amber Midthunder potentially reprising her role from the first film. If that happens, Midthunder would become the first lead performer in a Predator movie to return for a sequel.\n\nBadlands doesn't currently have a release date."
