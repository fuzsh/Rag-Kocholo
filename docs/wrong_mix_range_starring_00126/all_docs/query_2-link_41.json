        "text": "Director Shane Black has shared an image of the cast of “The Predator,” which is currently filming in Vancouver, Canada.\n\n“Stone killers with serious acting chops — but which of them will be chopped … by THE PREDATOR? (See what I did there?)” Black posted on Twitter, teasing the amount of death that is to come, although plot details are being kept tightly under wraps.\n\nBoyd Holbrook (“Narcos”), Keegan Michael-Key, Sterling K. Brown, Alfie Allen, Jacob Tremblay, Olivia Munn and Trevante Rhodes (“Moonlight”) star in the film.\n\nHolbrook stars in the film as an ex-Marine who discovers the existence of the titular alien species and is forced to lead the fight against them. Tremblay plays the marine’s son, an autistic boy who is bullied in school but becomes vital to his father’s mission as his ability to quickly learn languages proves to be a valuable tool.\n\n“The Predator” is slated by Twentieth Century Fox for a 2018 release and will be the first installment in the “Predator” series since 2007’s “Alien vs. Predator: Requiem.” The film is directed by Black, who co-wrote the screenplay with Fred Dekker (“Monster Squad”).\n\nThe original “Predator” movie came out in 1987 and famously starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as the leader of an elite special forces team on a mission to rescue hostages from guerrilla territory in Central America — before being hunted down an advance alien life form.\n\nSee the image below."
