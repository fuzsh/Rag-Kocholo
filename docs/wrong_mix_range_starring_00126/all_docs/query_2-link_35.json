Following the worldwide acclaim for \"Prey\", the new project appears to be a high priority for 20th Century Studios: The search for a suitable cast is in full swing. According to Deadline, the cast is now likely to be led by \"Maleficent\" star Elle Fanning, who is currently in negotiations with the studio."
