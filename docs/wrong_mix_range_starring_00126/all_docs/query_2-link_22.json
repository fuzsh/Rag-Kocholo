        "text": "On Thursday night, just hours after the news broke that she had successfully lobbied to cut a scene in which she appeared opposite a convicted sexual offender, Olivia Munn arrived at the midnight premiere of her new film, The Predator. She was joined by many of her male co-stars as well as director Shane Black, who after The Los Angeles Times broke the story said that he regretted casting his friend Steven Wilder Striegel and released a statement apologizing to “all of those, past and present, I’ve let down by having Steve around them without giving them a voice in the decision.”\n\nOne of those people, presumably, was Munn. But as she told Vanity Fair’s executive West Coast editor, Krista Smith, on Saturday, she has not actually heard directly from Black, her co-stars, or the studio since speaking on the record to the Times about her efforts to have the scene cut and the “unsettling” realization that Black had cast Striegel without disclosing his history. (A source close to the production later clarified that at least one co-star had, in fact, reached out.) At the premiere, Munn said that her co-stars—including Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, and Keegan-Michael Key—all stood to give Black what appeared to be an ovation at the beginning of the film. “I looked back and I see the guys standing up, and I was just confused because I hadn’t heard from them during the day. Everybody else was sitting down—it wasn’t like this massive standing ovation for him. I felt it was still appropriate to clap and cheer, but to actually make that gesture to stand up, especially in this moment . . . and privately I knew that no one reached out to me to say, ‘Are you O.K.?’ It did feel bad.”\n\nAs their press duties have continued, Munn said, many of her co-stars have canceled scheduled interviews with her; another, she said, walked out of an interview when the issue of the cut scene came up. When Munn decided to give a comment to the Times, she told Smith, she reached out to all of her co-stars privately to encourage them to make statements of their own. “I wanted them to not be blindsided the way I was blindsided, and I encouraged them to put out a statement once the L.A. Times reached out to us,“ Munn said. “I was surprised that none of them did. Again that’s their prerogative. Right now the reality is that there will be people who wear Time’s Up pins and say they support Time’s Up, [but] there will be people in Time’s Up who aren’t really down with the cause.”\n\nIn an interview at TIFF with The Los Angeles Times, alongside Munn and Augusto Aguilera, Rhodes said, “I wasn’t disappointed in Shane. I was disappointed in the situation, and I’m happy that Liv spoke up.”\n\nA representative for Keegan-Michael Key said in a statement, “Keegan was never booked to do an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. His last interview was scheduled after lunch, which he completed. He was always departing TIFF early so he could be home to spend the Jewish holiday with his wife. Furthermore, Keegan reached out to Olivia privately last week to let her know how proud he was of her and echoed that sentiment in many interviews since then.”\n\nOn Monday Boyd Holbrook sent the following statement via a representative: “I want to start by apologizing for this statement coming late in the current conversation. I do not take any of what has gone on lightly, and I want to speak from the most honest and genuine place possible. I have stated before, and I will state it again, I am proud of Olivia for the way that she handled a difficult and alarming situation, and I am grateful that Fox took the information seriously and took action swiftly. It is true that I pulled out of a small amount of press on Saturday, as this type of social commentary is new to me and given the nature of the originating crime, I felt further discussion could cause unwanted trauma and pain, neither of which I wanted to incite to the anonymous young woman. I now realize that my understanding of the situation was not the full picture and the last thing I want is for Olivia to ever feel abandoned or alone. We are in the midst of a very crucial and important time and it is imperative that we keep listening.”\n\nWhen asked for comment, a Twentieth Century Fox spokesperson said, “Our studio was not aware of Mr. Striegel’s background when he was hired. Several weeks ago, when the studio learned the details, his one scene in the film was removed within 24 hours. We were not aware of his background during the casting process due to legal limitations that impede studios from running background checks on actors.” Representatives for Black, Holbrook, and Rhodes did not provide comment.\n\n“I kind of feel like I’m the one going to jail,” Munn said. “I didn’t go to jail, I didn’t put this guy on our set. I had this scene deleted. Thank God, honestly, that there is social media. It’s the fans and news outlets that’s confirming it to me that what I did was the right thing. If I didn’t have that feedback, I’d kind of go a little crazy thinking, Why am I being treated like this? That’s not O.K., to feel like the bad guy.”\n\nAs the Los Angeles Times originally reported, Munn was tipped off that Striegel was a convicted sex offender, and notified Fox on August 15; though the Times report said that executives quickly worked to cut Striegel’s scene, Munn told Variety that the studio waited two days to tell her they‘d taken action, and in that time she told them she didn’t feel comfortable presenting at the V.M.A.s on August 20 unless the scene was cut. “Getting a convicted sex offender out of a movie that has global reach is extremely important, but the reality of what I’ve had to go through in this process of just finding out, it’s a crazy thing,“ Munn told Smith. “It’s like I stumbled upon something and now I’m being chased by everyone and isolated.”\n\nMunn has been working in Hollywood for over a decade, with recent roles in blockbusters like X-Men: Apocalypse and Ocean’s 8, but said that her recent experience has made her consider leaving the industry behind altogether. “I love being an actor, but if it comes at this cost, who wants it? Who cares? I’m so much more than who I am as an actor, and so many other things going on in my life. I love it, but they can take it, if that’s what it comes down to.”\n\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated to include a clarification from a source that at least one co-star had reached out to Munn. It has also been updated to include a statement from Keegan-Michael Key’s and Boyd Holbrook’s representatives.\n\nToronto Film Festival 2018: The Brightest Stars (and Biggest Breakouts)\n\n1 / 44"
