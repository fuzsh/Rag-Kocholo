        "text": "Emmy nominee Elle Fanning is in talks to star in “Badlands,” a standalone movie from Dan Trachtenberg that expands the “Predator” universe.\n\nTrachtenberg is set to direct the movie for 20th Century Studios from a script he co-wrote with Patrick Aison. “Badlands” comes following the success of Trachtenberg’s “Prey” — the “Predator” prequel which was a critical hit and broke records with its release on Hulu. The 2022 film was nominated for five Primetime Emmys, winning one for sound editing; “Prey 2” is in early development, with its star Amber Midthunder potentially returning. “Badlands” was announced in February, with the film expected to begin production later this year. Plot details are being kept under wraps.\n\nFanning recently wrapped a three-season run as executive producer and star of Hulu’s “The Great,” where she starred as Russian monarch Catherine the Great and earned her first Emmy nomination (for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series). Over the course of her 20-year career, Fanning’s resume ranges from playing Disney princess Aurora in the “Maleficent” movies to ripped-from-the-headlines drama in “The Girl from Plainville” and the family comedy “We Bought a Zoo,” as well as auteur-driven fare like Nicolas Winding Refn’s “The Neon Demon,” Mike Mills’ “20th Century Women,” and Sofia Coppola’s “Somewhere” and “The Beguiled.”\n\nBut among her first big roles was a breakout turn in J.J. Abrams’ 2011 sci-fi movie “Super 8.” Fanning plays Alice, one of a group of preteens who, in the summer of 1979, witness a train crash and investigate the series of unexplained events that follow it. Fanning will next be seen in James Mangold’s “A Complete Unknown,” where she plays Sylvie Russo opposite Timothee Chalamet’s Bob Dylan.\n\nShe is repped by UTA, TFC Management and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller.\n\nDeadline was first to report Fanning’s involvement. 20th Century Studios declined to comment."
