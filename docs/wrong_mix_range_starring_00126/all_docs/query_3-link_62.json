        "text": "Get ready to bring on all the feels because one of our favorite Camp Rock actresses is officially a married woman! Yep, we’re taking about Anna Maria Perez de Tagle. The Disney star exchanged vows with her longtime boyfriend, Scott Kline, on June 30, 2019, and we couldn’t be happier for her.\n\nThe 28-year-old shared the exciting news via Instagram on July 3, 2019. And get this, you guys — she even gave us a look inside the gorgeous wedding! She posted a collage of photos, and boy, did it look beautiful.\n\n“Introducing Mr. & Mrs. Kline!” she wrote. “This past weekend, I married the love of my life in the most beautiful, princess-inspired wedding gown by @theolivertolentino. Our wedding was even better than we ever imagined! We are so thankful to everyone who came and celebrated our special day! Love you all!”\n\nThe brunette beauty looked absolutely breathtaking in the white, lace gown, which had a train that was over 25 feet long and reportedly took over five months to make! She also wore a diamond tiara and a 30 foot long vail, and we seriously cannot stop gushing over her look.\n\n“P.S. You’re about to get wedding pictures overload for the next month,” she added.\n\nWe are definitely not complaining! We want as many photos as possible, Anna, please and thanks. During the celebration, Anna’s grandmother, Sylvia la Torre, who’s a famous singer, performed for the couple. And get this, you guys — Anna’s husband even hit the stage to serenade her. Yeah, it was truly a magical evening.\n\n“I met him about two years ago. We were set up by my cousin. Our first date was actually at Disneyland. At the end of the night, he gave me a bouquet of flowers and drove me home,” the Camp Rock star told ABS-CBN last month. “He’s very supportive of my career but if I ever do decide to take a break because of kids, he’s supportive of that also. But I still plan to still act, sing. We are still living in LA so we’ll be fine with that.”\n\nCongratulations to the newlyweds!"
