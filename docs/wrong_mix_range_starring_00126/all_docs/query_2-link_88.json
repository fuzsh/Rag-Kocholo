        "text": "By REBECCA ERINAH NAKIBERU\n\nFirst and foremost enter the realm of suspense and excitement as the highly anticipated Predator sequel, Badlands, makes a bold move by casting Elle Fanning as its star. Prepare to be captivated as Fanning steps into the heart-pounding world of alien hunters.\n\nFollowing the success of the Predator film Prey, director Dan Trachtenberg will be making more movies about the beloved alien hunter earlier this very year.\n\nExcitingly, the first of these new movies, Badlands, seems to have found its star. Elle Fanning is in discussions to join the latest Yautja hunt.\n\nHowever, details about the plot for the new Predator film are being kept tightly under wraps. The only confirmed information is that Badlands will feature a Predator, but it won't involve Bruce Springsteen or Terrence Malick.\n\nMost importantly ,Trachtenberg and Patrick Aison co-wrote Badlands, which is set in the future, unlike their previous film Prey. While Badlands won't be a direct sequel to Prey, a follow-up to Prey is still in development.\n\nIn addition to the above, Filming for Badlands is scheduled to start later this year, with Trachtenberg directing again. We're optimistic that this sci-fi action movie might hit screens next year. Considering how well Prey did with critics and streaming, it wouldn't be unexpected for Badlands to get a theatrical release.\n\nIf you're eager for more alien-based franchise action, Fede √Ålvarez's Alien Romulus is just a few months away. Also, Fanning will appear in James Mangold's upcoming Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown.\n\nFueling our imagination with possibilities, speculations arise about a potential connection between Badlands and Romulus and hence we are heading towards a new Alien Vs Predator narrative and so it's a captivating idea.\n\nIn conclusion, the prospect of a connection between Badlands and Romulus opens up intriguing possibilities for a new Alien Vs Predator storyline, igniting excitement among fans.\n\nPhoto credit :Empire online.com"
