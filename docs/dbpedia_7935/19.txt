LYRICS

Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania,

Mighty is your name,

Steeped in glory and tradition,

Object of acclaim.

Where brave men fought the foe of freedom,

Tyranny decried,

'Til the bell of independence

filled the countryside.

CHORUS

Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania,

May your future be,

filled with honor everlasting

as your history.

VERSE 2

Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania,

Blessed by God's own hand,

Birthplace of a mighty nation,

Keystone of the land.

Where first our country's flag unfolded,

Freedom to proclaim,

May the voices of tomorrow

glorify your name.
