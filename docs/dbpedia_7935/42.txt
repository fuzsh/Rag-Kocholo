The Historical Society of Pennsylvania is proud to be a National Audience Partner with the Smithsonian for their Raise It Up! Anthem for America campaign. To give Philadelphia a leading voice in the “Song Heard Round the World”, the U.S. Army Voices band led a group-sing of the national anthem at 4:00pm on Saturday, June 14, 2014, on the front lawn of the National Constitution Center. This event took place amidst Philadelphia’s Stripes & Stars festival, a daylong celebration of our nation’s flag and the U.S. Army.
