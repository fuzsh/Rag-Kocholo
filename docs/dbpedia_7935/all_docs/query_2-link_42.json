        "text": "This lecture will offer a journey through key moments in the 140-year history of the song that became Israel’s national anthem. How does a folk song acquire such a profound cultural resonance that its performances can trigger emotional reactions as diverse as pride, nostalgia, despair, and hate? A look at “Ha-Tikvah” offers a unique opportunity to tackle such questions. Examining critically the varied reception of this song, a more textured and alternative history of Jewish modernity emerges.\n\nAbout the Howard Jay Reiter Memorial Lecture\n\nEstablished by family and friends in memory of beloved Katz Center board member Howard Jay Reiter z''l, this lecture series shares insights and discoveries from Israeli scholarship with the University of Pennsylvania community.\n\nThis event takes place in person with reception to follow. There is also an option to attend via Zoom.\n\nRSVP HERE to attend in person.\n\nREGISTER HERE to attend via Zoom.\n\nPlease note registration is required for this program. Non–PennCard-holders will be asked to show ID to register at the door, space permitting."
