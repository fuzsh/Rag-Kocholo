        "text": "In 1901, Fred Lewis Pattee, then a professor at the college, recognized the institution’s lack of a “distinctly State College song,” noting that larger universities had adopted their own songs that represented togetherness and victory. “Without a college song there can be no real nucleus for sentiment, there can be no natural outlet for refined feeling, for loyalty, for enthusiasm, for devotion to alma mater,” Pattee wrote in the April 1901 issue of Free Lance, a precursor of the Daily Collegian. In that same issue he suggested the words that would later become the Penn State alma mater, though he encouraged other readers to submit their own ideas. Pattee’s words were to be sung to the music of “Lead Me On,” a song by Cauviere in the College Hymnal that was traditionally sung at commencement.\n\nAccording to the Penn State University Archives, Pattee’s song made its debut at the June 1901 alumni dinner during Commencement Week. After it was sung, Gov. James Beaver, president of the Board of Trustees, stood and proclaimed it “the official song of Penn State.”\n\nToday, the alma mater is nearly identical to Pattee’s original version, save for a few edits. The last two verses of Pattee’s original six have been omitted from today’s alma mater. Additionally, several words were updated to reflect the co-ed nature of the college: “at Boyhood’s Gate” was changed to “at Childhood’s Gate,” and “molded into men” was changed to “Dear Old State.”\n\nPenn State Alma Mater lyrics:\n\nFor the glory of Old State,\n\nFor her founders strong and great,\n\nFor the future that we wait,\n\nRaise the song, raise the song.\n\nSing our love and loyalty,\n\nSing our hopes that bright and free,\n\nRest, O mother dear, with thee,\n\nAll with thee, all with thee.\n\nWhen we stood at childhood’s gate,\n\nShapeless in the hands of fate,\n\nThou didst mold us, dear old State,\n\nDear old State, dear old State.\n\nMay no act of ours bring shame,\n\nTo one heart that loves thy name.\n\nMay our lives but swell thy fame,\n\nDear old State, dear old State.\n\nSoon we know a guiding hand\n\nWill disperse our little band,\n\nYet we’ll ever loyal stand\n\nState to thee, State to thee.\n\nThen Rah! Rah! for dear old State,\n\nFor our love can ne’er abate!\n\nRing the song with joy elate\n\nLoud and long, loud and long."
