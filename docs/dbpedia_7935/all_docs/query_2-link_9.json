Who knew?\n\n\"Pennsylvania\" became the state song in 1990, so it hasn't been on the history books for too long. It also should not be confused with the Bloodhound Gang song of the same name.\n\nHere are the lyrics for the official state song, courtesy of 50states.com.\n\nPennsylvania, Pennsylvania,\n\nMighty is your name,\n\nSteeped in glory and tradition,\n\nObject of acclaim,\n\nWhere brave men fought the foe of freedom,\n\nTyranny decried,\n\n'Til the bell of independence filled the countryside.\n\nChorus\n\nPennsylvania, Pennsylvania,\n\nMay your future be filled with honor everlasting as your history.\n\nPennsylvania, Pennsylvania,\n\nBlessed by God's own hand,\n\nBirthplace of a mighty nation,\n\nKeystone of the land.\n\nWhere first our country's flag unfolded,\n\nFreedom to proclaim,\n\nMay the voices of tomorrow glorify your name."
