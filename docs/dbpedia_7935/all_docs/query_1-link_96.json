All State Songs\n\nLYRICS\n\nI am thinking tonight of the Southland,\n\nOf the home of my childhood days,\n\nWhere I roamed through the woods and the meadows\n\nBy the mill and the brook that plays;\n\nWhere the roses are in bloom\n\nAnd the sweet magnolia too,\n\nWhere the jasmine is white\n\nAnd the fields are violet blue,\n\nThere a welcome awaits all her children\n\nWho have wandered afar from home.\n\nCHORUS\n\nArkansas, Arkansas, tis a name dear,\n\n'Tis the place I call \"home, sweet home\";\n\nArkansas, Arkansas, I salute thee,\n\nFrom thy shelter no more I'll roam.\n\nVERSE 2\n\n'Tis a land full of joy and of sunshine,\n\nRich in pearls and in diamonds rare,\n\nFull of hope, faith, and love for the stranger,\n\nWho may pass 'neath her portals fair;\n\nThere the rice fields are full,\n\nAnd the cotton, corn and hay,\n\nThere the fruits of the field\n\nBloom in the winter months and May,\n\n'Tis the land that I love, first of all, dear,\n\nAnd to her let us all give cheer."
