        "text": "Video: Watch these Pocono students show how to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” the right way.\n\n\"It is hard to sing. It covers a wide range — an octave and a fifth, or two full octaves if the singer takes the optional high note near the end — and has some big jumps in it, right from the beginning,\" said Susan Jordan, a private voice teacher and director of the East Stroudsburg High School South spring musical.\n\nSinging the anthem as it should be requires proper training, said K. Bernard Schade, founder and director of the Singing Boys of Pennsylvania, based in Wind Gap.\n\n\"There are so many untrained musicians performing today, and most of them aren't all that talented,\" he said.\n\n\"It is easy to see they are simply asking the wrong people to sing, and they are clueless,\" Schade said. \"They want popular names everyone knows, no matter what they sound like.\"\n\nThe flubs are not a result of nerves, according to Jack Hamblin, director of the Pocono Mountain Community Chorus in Swiftwater.\n\n\"TV caters to stars, so entertainers of various ilks are often chosen over trained singers — be they soloists or choruses. While entertainers may be outrageous in their presentation, it's hard for many of them to offer a respectful and pleasant-sounding rendition of a tough song,\" he said.\n\n\"It comes down to what sells air time on TV: Steven Tyler, Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera and so on.\"\n\nWhile the song may not absolutely require a trained voice to do it justice, Jordan said that most untrained singers should stay away from the optional high note.\n\nIn the first phrase — \"O say can you see by the dawn's early light\" — the pitches go low right away and then quickly ascend rather high, said James Maroney, associate professor of music and director of choral and vocal activities at East Stroudsburg University.\n\n\"Many celebrity singers are actually quite limited in their vocal technique, and largely perform songs that accommodate their limitations. So, when they try to sing a song that is vocally challenging, such as our national anthem, they often come up short,\" he said.\n\n\"Pop and rock singers belt,\" said Wendy Grice, co-artistic director of the Pennsylvania Lyric Opera Theater in Tannersville.\n\nThat means they push the lower portion of their voice up as far as they can to get the sound for that style of music. Normally, they would stay in a limited range, so that they don't have to push that voice too high.\n\n\"If they try to belt too high, they risk cracking or at the very least, sounding like a cat with its tail caught, if you get my drift,\" she said.\n\nMost pop singers find it difficult or nearly impossible to find a key low enough to keep the high note within range, she said.\n\nGood breath control is needed if you want to sing the long uninterrupted phrases needed to honor the \"true meaning of the words,\" Maroney said.\n\n\"Many singers chop up the phrases because they don't have good breath control. The song loses a lot of its impact when that happens.\"\n\nMaroney added that many singers botch the lyrics because they don't understand their meaning.\n\n\"To them it's often just random words,\" Maroney said. \"If you look at a lot of the songs nowadays, the lyrics are often rather self-centered. A lot of contemporary singers have trouble relating to words that are about things other than themselves.\"\n\nHaving stood on the football field directing his choir to sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Mets-Pirates game in Pittsburgh last year, Todd Mason, music director of the six JTL Choirs at J.T. Lambert Intermediate School in East Stroudsburg, has another explanation.\n\n\"I bet you didn't know that every place you stand on the playing field gives you a different sound,\" Mason said. \"It actually sounded different every time the choir sang the anthem during practice. It is a performer's nightmare.\""
