        "text": "At midnight on December 12th, 1963, Kenyan independence was declared. This momentous event marks the end of colonial rule and ushered in a newfound hope for Kenyans. To celebrate this monumental occasion, the Kenyan National Anthem was played to commemorate the start of Kenyan sovereignty. This anthem’s lyrics are deeply meaningful as they express a sense of liberation and joy. The anthem speaks of Kenya’s struggle against colonialism, toil in adversity, and determination for a brighter future. These inspiring words embody Kenya’s spirit of resilience and are a reminder that freedom is something that should never be taken for granted.\n\nThe title of the Kenyan National Anthem, “Ee Mungu Nguvu Yetu,” was written by Mzee Meza Moroa Galana alongside a team of composers. The song was adapted from a Pokomo lullaby and celebrated Kenya’s hard-fought independence. The meaning of the lyrics,” O God of all creation, grant us your strength,” reminds Kenyans that no matter how difficult our struggles may be, there is a greater power at work that can guide us through any situation.\n\nEe Mungu Nguvu Yetu\n\nNational Anthem of Kenya (Swahili)\n\nEe Mungu nguvu yetu\n\nIlete baraka kwetu\n\nHaki iwe ngao na mlinzi\n\nNatukae na udugu\n\nAmani na uhuru\n\nRaha tupate na ustawi.\n\nAmkeni ndugu zetu\n\nTufanye sote bidii\n\nNasi tujitoe kwa nguvu\n\nNchi yetu ya\n\nKenya tunayoipenda\n\nTuwe tayari kuilinda.\n\nNatujenge taifa letu\n\nEe ndio wajibu wetu\n\nKenya istahili heshima\n\nTuungane mikono pamoja kazini\n\nKila siku tuwe nashukrani.\n\n(English)\n\nO God of all creation,\n\nBless this, our land and nation.\n\nJustice be our shield and defender,\n\nMay we dwell in unity,\n\nPeace and liberty.\n\nPlenty be found within our borders.\n\nLet one and all arise\n\nWith hearts both strong and true.\n\nService be our earnest endeavor,\n\nAnd our Homeland of Kenya,\n\nHeritage of splendor,\n\nFirm may we stand to defend.\n\nLet all with one accord\n\nIn common bond united,\n\nBuild this our nation together,\n\nAnd the glory of Kenya,\n\nThe fruit of our labor\n\nFill every heart with thanksgiving.\n\nWant to help support the people of Kenya?\n\nThe American Foundation for Children with AIDS is committed to helping children infected and affected by AIDS in Kenya.
