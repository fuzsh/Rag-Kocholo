        "text": "If the South can be said to have had a national anthem at all, it would have been \"God Save the South.\" Written early in the war by George H. Miles (a Marylander writing under the pseudonym Earnest Halpin) and set to music by a composer with the marvelous name of Charles Wolfgang Amadeus Ellerbrock (the arranger of \"Maryland, My Maryland\"), it tempered the martial spirit of Julia Ward Howe's more famous \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" with the unwavering conviction that God would come to the aid of the embattled South. The first song to be published in the Confederacy, it was published in no fewer than nine editions. The first Southern publication was by A.E. Blackmar in New Orleans, followed by printings in Charleston, South Carolina; Macon and Savannah, Georgia; another New Orleans printing by a different house; and two in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe song showcases the South's strong sense of identification with Virginian George Washington, who was seen as a rebel by the British Crown during the American colonies' revolt against England. It echoed the belief of many Southerners that the War Between the States was the Second American Revolution.\n\nRebels before, our fathers of yore. Rebel's the righteous name Washington bore. Why, then, be ours the same, The name that he snatched from shame, Making it first in fame, foremost in war.\n\nAlthough many Southerners argue that Daniel Emmett's minstrel tune \"Dixie's Land\" deserves to be known as the Confederate national anthem, Richard B. Harwell points out in his 1950 publication Confederate Music that the song \"can hardly be said to meet the requirements of a national anthem, [although] it has become a truly national tune, permanently enshrined in the hearts of Americans in both the North and the South.\" That honor rightly belongs to \"God Save the South\" not just by virtue of its status as the new nation's first published song but also because of its stirring poetry and its outstanding musical setting.\n\nThe lyrics are:\n\nGod save the South, God save the South,\n\nHer altars and firesides, God save the South!\n\nNow that the war is nigh, now that we arm to die,\n\nChanting our battle cry, \"Freedom or death!\"\n\nChanting our battle cry, \"Freedom or death!\"\n\nGod be our shield, at home or afield,\n\nStretch Thine arm over us, strengthen and save.\n\nWhat tho' they're three to one, forward each sire and son,\n\nStrike till the war is won, strike to the grave!\n\nStrike till the war is won, strike to the grave!\n\nGod made the right stronger than might,\n\nMillions would trample us down in their pride.\n\nLay Thou their legions low, roll back the ruthless foe,\n\nLet the proud spoiler know God's on our side.\n\nLet the proud spoiler know God's on our side.\n\nHark honor's call, summoning all.\n\nSummoning all of us unto the strife.\n\nSons of the South, awake! Strike till the brand shall break,\n\nStrike for dear Honor's sake, Freedom and Life!\n\nStrike for dear Honor's sake, Freedom and Life!\n\nRebels before, our fathers of yore.\n\nRebel's the righteous name Washington bore.\n\nWhy, then, be ours the same, the name that he snatched from shame,\n\nMaking it first in fame, foremost in war.\n\nMaking it first in fame, foremost in war.\n\nWar to the hilt, theirs be the guilt,\n\nWho fetter the free man to ransom the slave.\n\nUp then, and undismay'd, sheathe not the battle blade,\n\nTill the last foe is laid low in the grave!\n\nTill the last foe is laid low in the grave!\n\nGod save the South, God save the South,\n\nDry the dim eyes that now follow our path.\n\nStill let the light feet rove safe through the orange grove,\n\nStill keep the land we love safe from Thy wrath.\n\nStill keep the land we love safe from Thy wrath."
