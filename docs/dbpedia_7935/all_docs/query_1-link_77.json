        "text": "The lyrics that George Washington probably heard sung to the tune of \"Yankee Doodle\" are not the words now known around the world. The earliest known appearance of the common words relating to \"pony, feather, and macaroni\" is in James Orchard Halliwell's The Nursery Rhymes of England.1 No earlier reference to these lyrics has been found.\n\nWashington probably did know the chorus about minding the music and the step. It comes from the Boston area in 1775 and was set to the tune we all know. The song must have struck home because by 1830, over one hundred more topical lyrics were printed, sung to the same tune and using the same basic chorus. In the twentieth century, this chorus was added to the \"macaroni\" verse from 1842, making up the song we know today.\n\nThe 1775 Lyrics\n\nAfter the battles at Lexington and Concord, the British controlled Boston from April 1775 until March 1776. In June 1775, George Washington arrived to take command of the patriot army that had assembled outside of the city to defend the rest of Massachusetts and lay siege to the British stronghold. The following song was probably written sometime after his arrival. It was created from story elements from three earlier New England-made lyrics. The uncomplimentary nature of verses 11-13 comes from the early months of Washington's command. The New England militia officers who were elected to their commands grumbled openly against the Virginian who was appointed by Congress. But by 1776, Washington was a hero in the eyes of most patriots and new songs lauded him as \"God-like Washington.\"\n\nThe Farmer and his Son's return from a visit to the CAMP.\n\nFather and I went down to camp,\n\nAlong with Captain Gooding,\n\nAnd there we see the men and boys\n\nAs thick as hasty pudding.\n\nYankey doodle keep it up,\n\nYankey doodle dandy,\n\nMind the music and the step\n\nAnd with the girls be handy\n\nAnd there we see a thousand men,\n\nAs rich as 'Squire David,\n\nAnd what they wasted every day,\n\nI wish it had been saved.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nThe 'lasses they eat every day,\n\nWould keep an house a winter;\n\nThey have as much that I'll be bound,\n\nThey eat it when they're mind to.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nAnd there we see a swamping gun,\n\nLarge as a log of maple,\n\nUpon a ducid little cart,\n\nA load for father's cattle.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nAnd every time they shoot it off,\n\nIt takes a horn of powder,\n\nAnd makes a noise like father's gun,\n\nOnly a nation louder.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nI went as nigh to one myself,\n\nAs 'Siah's underpinning;\n\nAnd father when as nigh again,\n\nI thought the duce was in him.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nCousin Simon grew so bold,\n\nI thought he would have cock'd it;\n\nIt scar'd me so I shriek'd it off,\n\nAnd hung by father's pocket.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nAnd captain Davis had a gun,\n\nHe kind of clapt his hand on't,\n\nAnd stuck a crooked stabbing iron\n\nUpon the little end on't.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nAnd there I see a pumpkin shell,\n\nAs big as mother's bason,\n\nAnd every time they touch'd it off,\n\nThey scamper'd like the nation.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nI see a little barrel too,\n\nThe heads were made of leather,\n\nThey knock upon with little clubs,\n\nAnd call'd the folks together.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nAnd there was captain Washington,\n\nAnd gentlefolks about him,\n\nThey say he's grown so tarnal proud,\n\nHe will not ride without them.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nHe got him on his meeting clothes,\n\nUpon a slapping stallion,\n\nHe set the world along in rows,\n\nIn hundreds and in millions.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nThe flaming ribbons in his hat,\n\nThey look'd so taring fine ah,\n\nI wanted pockily to get,\n\nTo give to my Jemimah.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nI see another snarl of men,\n\nA digging graves they told me,\n\nSo tarnal long, so tarnal deep,\n\nThey 'tended they should hold me.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.\n\nIf scar'd me so I hook'd it off,\n\nNor stopt as I remember,\n\nNor turn'd about 'till I got home,\n\nLock'd up in mother's chamber.\n\nYankey doodle, &c.2\n\nMany later settings of the tune of “Yankee Doodle” reflect other events, such as the surrender of General Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781.\n\nCornwallis led a country dance\n\nThe like was never seen, sir,\n\nMuch retrograde, and much advance,\n\nAnd all with General Greene, sir3\n\nA blaze of patriotic passion was ignited in 1798 by French spoliation of American shipping. The following song even refers to the use of the tune for many purposes.\n\nSing Yankee Doodle, that fine tune,\n\nAmericans delight in;\n\nIt suits for peace, it suits for fun,\n\nIt suits as well for fighting.\n\nYankee doodle (mind the tune)\n\nYankee doodle dandy,\n\nIf Frenchmen come with naked bum,\n\nWe’ll spank ‘em hard and handy.4\n\nKATE VAN WINKLE KELLER\n\nDECEMBER 2001\n\nNotes\n\n1.

Leo Lemay. \"The American Origins of \"Yankee Doodle.\" William and Mary Quarterly, July, 1976, 435-464.\n\nFor information on the music:\n\nIn 1909, in his Report on the Star-Spangled Banner . . . & Yankee Doodle (Reprinted: New York: Dover Publications, 1972), Oscar Sonneck wrote over 100 pages of convoluted text trying to deal with the myths and folk tales that surround the origins of the music for this song. He failed to find an answer. Since that time others have tackled the problem without convincing success. The pre-1760s source, if there is one, of the tune of \"Yankee Doodle,\" is unknown. Claims of earlier appearances are without foundation. It is entirely possible that this tune was newly written as a common march in the early 1760s and has no historical antecedent."
