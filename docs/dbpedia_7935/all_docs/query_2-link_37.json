New Jersey is the only state in the US without an official state song, but they do have a popular one that has been designated “the unofficial state song of New Jersey”.\n\nThere are a few states that actually have multiple songs too. The style of the song varies from state to state. Some sound like catchy anthems and some are just songs that celebrate the state."
