Freedom! Freedom!\n\nChorus\n\nHere has Justice erected its Throne\n\nwhich vile oppression ignores\n\nand, on its glorious stamp let us rejoice\n\nFreedom, freedom, freedom\n\nThis innocent and beautiful land,\n\nwhich owes its name to Bolívar,\n\nis the happy homeland where mankind\n\nenjoys the benefits of bliss and peace.\n\nChorus\n\nIf a foreigner may, any given day\n\neven attempt to subjugate Bolivia,\n\nlet him prepare for a fatal destiny,\n\nwhich menaces such brave aggressor.\n\nFor the sons of the mighty Bolívar\n\nhave sworn, thousands upon thousands of times:\n\nto die rather than see the country's\n\nmajestic banner humiliated.\n\nChorus"
