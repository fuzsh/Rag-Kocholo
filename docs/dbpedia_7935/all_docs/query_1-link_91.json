        "text": "In the event you've been living under a literal rock, Taylor Swift’s latest studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, is officially here...meaning it’s time for Swifties everywhere (guilty) to be in their feels and obsess over every single lyric for the next month and a half at least.\n\nNow, in the event you didn’t get the memo from our official Tortured Poets Department Chairman™️, the project is the musician’s 11th studio album. And though it was initially thought to have 16 tracks and four bonus numbers, Tay wound up blessing us with an additional 15 (!!!!!) songs at 2 a.m. the night she debuted the album—a welcome surprise fans thought might happen given...\n\nAnyway! Today, we’re here to talk about one of our absolute fave songs “Florida!!!”—which, btw, has a *chef’s kiss* assist from the iconic Florence Welch. While the tribute to the state might seem kinda ??? (or !!!, for that matter) given the singer was raised in Pennsylvania, her exes Joe Alwyn and Matty Healy are from the UK, and her current boyfriend Travis Kelce hails from Ohio, it kinda sorta makes sense if you think about it. Let us explain...\n\nOne theory is that the track alludes to Taylor’s relationship with Joe, given the singer’s first Eras Tour stop following the news of their split was Tampa, Florida, from April 13 to 15, 2023. She played three nights in the city before moving on to *drumroll, pls* Houston from April 21 to 23. Now, the reason this tidbit is so 🤯 is that one of the lyrics in “Florida!!!” reads, “So you pack your life away just to wait out the shitstorm back in Texas.”\n\nBut because Swifties are true masterminds (heh), this is far from the only postulation about the song. Case in point? Some have theorized that it’s about Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas’s split since the fellow musician filed for divorce from the actor in Florida back in September 2023.\n\nAmid her legal battle with Joe, Sophie and her daughters reportedly began living in Tay’s Tribeca home, per Page Six. The two also went out to dinner a buncha times and even attended a Kansas City Chiefs vs. New York Jets game in October 2023. Oh, *and* it was reported that one of Tay’s close friends—Brittany Mahomes—wanted “to set [Sophie] up” with one of Travis’s friends. “Brittany knows Sophie is newly single and has hung [out] with her before when Sophie attended one of the [Kansas City Chiefs] games. She would love to help play matchmaker,” a source dished to Us Weekly back in November.\n\n^ A moment for this iconic squad pic, pls!\n\nBtw, to make matters more 🥺 re: Tay and Sophie’s friendship, at the start of this year, the actor posted a touching tribute to her besties on Instagram alongside the caption, “2023 was the year of the girlies. 2024s forecast is looking fairly consistent.” And, yes, Tay makes the cut (along with Ms. Sabrina Carpenter!). Ahem:\n\nNow, if you’re not someone who loves to dwell on the potential lore of Taylor’s song lyrics (can’t relate) and prefer something a bit more concrete/less scandalous, here’s what “Florida!!!” is about according to the celeb herself c/o an iHeart Radio intro she took part in:\n\n“‘Florida!!!’ is a song that I wrote with Florence and the Machine, and I think I was coming up with this idea of like, What happens when your life doesn’t fit or your choices you’ve made catch up to you and you’re surrounded by these harsh consequences and judgment, and circumstances did not lead you to where you want to be and you just want to escape from everything you’ve ever known. Is there a place you could go?\n\n“I’m always watching like Dateline—people, you know, have these crimes that they commit. Where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida, you know? They like try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. And I think when you go through a heartbreak, there’s a part of you that thinks, I want a new name, I want a new life, I don’t want anyone to know where I’ve been or know me at all. And so that was the jumping-off point behind, Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida.”\n\nFlorence herself also opened up about the songwriting process with Tay, who apparently came up with “a concept and a story” for the track—“my favorite way to start songwriting,” she noted during her convo with . “I almost didn’t think of the scale of it,” the singer said of “Florida!!!” before adding, “There’s the sort of bigness of [Taylor Swift the phenomenon], and then there’s the Taylor I spend time with in the studio, who is just the sweetest and most down to earth.”\n\n“We had such a fun time,” Florence recalled of making the hit alongside Tay. “And then when it came out I was like, ‘Oh, sh*t!'” Truly obsessed with how we're not the only ones constantly in awe of Tay. 😂\n\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into “Florida!!!” and see what its lyrics are really about.\n\n[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]\n\nYou can beat the heat if you beat the charges too\n\nThey said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true\n\nAnd my friends all smell like weed or little babies\n\nAnd this city reeks of driving myself crazy\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]\n\nLittle did you know your home’s really only\n\nA town you’re just a guest in\n\nSo you work your life away just to pay\n\nFor a time-share down in Destin\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]\n\nFlorida\n\nIs one hell of a drug\n\nFlorida\n\nCan I use you up?\n\n[Verse 2: Florence Welch]\n\nThe hurricane with my name when it came\n\nI got drunk and I dared it to wash me away\n\nBarricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine\n\nWell, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time\n\nYes, I’m hauntеd, but I’m feeling just fine\n\nAll my girls got their lace and their crimes\n\nAnd your cheating husband disappeared\n\nWell, no one asks any questions here\n\n[Verse 3: Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]\n\nSo I did my best to lay to rest\n\nAll of the bodies that have ever been on my body\n\nAnd in my mind, they sink into the swamp\n\nIs that a bad thing to say in a song?\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Florence Welch]\n\nLittle did you know your home’s really only\n\nThe town you’ll get arrested\n\nSo you pack your life away just to wait out\n\nThe shitstorm back in Texas\n\n[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Florence Welch, Taylor Swift]\n\nFlorida\n\nIs one hell of a drug\n\nFlorida\n\nCan I use you up?\n\n[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]\n\nI need to forget, so take me to Florida\n\nI’ve got some regrets, I’ll bury them in Florida\n\nTell me I’m despicable, say it’s unforgivable\n\nAt least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida\n\nI need to forget, so take me to Florida\n\nI’ve got some regrets, I’ll bury them in Florida\n\nTell me I’m despicable, say it’s unforgivable\n\nWhat a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida\n\nIt’s one hell of a drug\n\nIt’s one hell of a drug\n\nLove loves me like this and I want to resist\n\nSo take me to Florida"
