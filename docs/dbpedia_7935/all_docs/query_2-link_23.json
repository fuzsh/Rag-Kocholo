(AP) — A Pennsylvania school district’s decision to remove a song from a recent student choral concert has divided the community and spurred a review by a civil rights group.\n\n“ Lift Every Voice And Sing,” a late-19th century hymn sometimes referred to as the Black national anthem, was among several songs that were to be performed during the May 7 show by the Spring Cove Middle School chorus. The Altoona Mirror reported that district officials cut the song the day before the concert, saying students had voiced concerns about the song and the “divisiveness and controversy in the nation.”\n\nThe district also received several calls from people regarding the song and its inclusion in the concert, officials said. This raised concerns about potential disruptions at the show.\n\nSchool Board President Troy Wright called the decision a “lose-lose situation” and said parents were threatening to pull their children from the concert over the song.\n\n“We can’t make everyone happy,” Wright told the newspaper. “We have to do the balancing act between who supports it and who doesn’t support it, and our job is trying to find the balance between it.”\n\nThe decision to cut the song was made by District Superintendent Betsy Baker and Middle School Principal Amy Miller. Baker said “Lift Every Voice and Sing” was one of many songs selected for the chorus by the music teachers who “picked songs that they felt were appropriate.” Because the chorus practiced other songs, one of those was picked to fill the slot.\n\n“We wanted everyone to feel comfortable,” Baker told the newspaper, saying the decision to cut the song was “clearly a divisive issue here” and stressing that race had nothing to do with the decision.\n\n“There was no right decision, but we focused on letting all of the kids participate in the concert,” Baker said.\n\nStephen Hershberger, whose son was among the students performing in the chorus concert, was among residents who criticized the decision.\n\n“Cutting the song just sends the message that a few individuals’ discomfort outweighs the perspective and care and concern of minority students and others who don’t have the same beliefs as them,” Hershberger told the newspaper.\n\nThe Blair County NAACP has said it executive board will proceed with a formal investigation into the district’s decision, the newspaper reported.\n\nOriginally Published: May 17, 2024 at 3:47 p.m."
