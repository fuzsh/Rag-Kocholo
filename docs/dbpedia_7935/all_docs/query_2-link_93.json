        "text": "Everyone on Twitter has seen the Philly election memes by now: Gritty grinning in front of Four Seasons Total Landscaping; a lawn chair holding a parking space in dirty snow; a greased-up streetlight pole waiting for an Eagles victory; Rocky Balboa, beat to shit, his arms held high. This is the Philadelphia that people who aren't from here know—where the stadium has a jail and we boo the children of people we don’t like.\n\nBut on my hometown-heavy feed, what stood out last week was all the dancing. Folks getting low for the vote count. The grandma in a parka and kente cloth kerchief pulling a hold-me-back James Brown, the kids breakdancing in front of Reading Terminal Market, the hipster with her hands in the air. Most of all, I loved seeing folks dancing to “Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now,” the 1979 song by and about Philadelphians.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe duo of Gene McFadden and John Whitehead, alongside Jerry Cohen, wrote and produced “Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now” at the height of the Sound of Philadelphia, the soul genre that brought us Teddy Pendergrass, the Spinners, and (eventually) disco. The song is a journey, from a simple opening about having “the groove” to an almost too on-the-nose declaration for this misbegotten year (“There’s been so many things that held us down/But now it looks like things are finally comin’ around”), followed by a hard-luck backstory. “If you’ve ever been held down before, I know you’ll refuse to be held down any more,” McFadden sings. It’s not merely about being down—it’s being “held down,” which, after the last four or 40 or 400 years, after “I can’t breathe” and “grab ’em by the pussy” and kids in cages and the Muslim ban… People in Philly were dancing to those lines, waiting for the song’s break, the moment of release that finally came on Saturday morning with Biden’s declared win.\n\nMcFadden and Whitehead grew up together in North Philly, writing their first hit, “Back Stabbers,” for the O’Jays in 1972. The song is about a faithless woman, but also the lack of faith that Black people feel in this country. Its appeal spread to broader audiences, who were paranoid about the endless war in Vietnam and Tricky Dick Nixon lying his way through Watergate. By the end of the 1970s, “Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now” offered a more hopeful message. Along with Cohen, a Jewish guy who could play the best boogie-woogie piano in the city, McFadden and Whitehead wanted to tell the world that life could and would continue to get better. The song became an unofficial Black National Anthem, the most reliable pick for school graduations, family reunions, and, as Colson Whitehead (no relation to John) memorialized in his novel Sag Harbor, every end of summer celebration.\n\n“Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now” was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios, a couple of blocks from where the Convention Center now stands. At that point, the Sound of Philadelphia was as emblematic of its hometown as Motown was for ’60s Detroit or Ruthless Records for ’80s Compton. The song itself follows Philadelphia International Records bosses Gamble and Huff’s hit-making formula: syncopated string and horn sections plus a disco backbeat, along with lyrics that could be about a private party or the world at large. Philly Soul musicians were a consistent and diverse crew, and the players on “Ain’t No Stoppin’ Us Now” were no different: an integrated but mostly Black rhythm section, and mostly (but not exclusively) white string and horn players. This last section included, on cello, my father Larry Gold, who also wrote some of his first string arrangements for the song’s accompanying album and received his first gold record for it.\n\nLast week at the Convention Center, when I saw people dancing to “Ain’t No Stoppin” Us Now,” I could feel the pavement their feet were hitting. I know that asphalt like I know the slate slab ground in Old City, left from when dockworkers rolled barrels down from the harbor and into the warehouses. Or the cracked, mostly dirt-and-weed squares that front the vacant lots in Kensington, where my dad grew up, and where the worst drug market in the country now thrives. The smooth sandstone steps of the Art Museum. The brick sidewalks in front of Ben Franklin’s print shop and Independence Hall, where long-dead white men wrote the rules Trump has been flouting. Our oft-invoked “founding fathers” could never have imagined the pileup of immigrants and descendants of slaves and loose women and revolutionaries dancing.\n\nI haven’t been able to walk on Philly’s sidewalks in coming on a year now, since the pandemic has taken away so much of our freedom of movement. I haven’t driven over the blue Ben Franklin Bridge, eaten a soft pretzel with mustard, taken a walk in the Wissahickon Woods. I haven’t seen the boarded-up fancy shops on Walnut Street or Kensington Avenue’s burnt-out storefronts after “rioters” “looted” in the spring. I wasn’t in the furious, joyous crush of my fellow Illadelphs when they pulled down the former Mayor and Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo’s statue by City Hall.\n\nThose folks were dancing in front of the Convention Center just a week after they’d been marching and running and screaming for Walter Wallace Jr., another Black victim of the cops’ hatred. Dancing isn’t a solution or an ending. But it’s something, to dance where you marched, to laugh where you screamed. That’s my Philly. Those are my sidewalks. That’s my song. Count every vote or we’ll come at you with what we got. Even from a fucking distance. Even with lawn chairs. Ain’t no stoppin’ us now."
