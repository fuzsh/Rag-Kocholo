As we hear it played out at the Euros 2020, here’s how this anthemic march came to be.\n\nThe İstiklal Marşı – or Independence March – was formally adopted as Turkey’s national anthem on 12 March 1921, two years before the Republic of Turkey was established, in 1923.\n\nWith troops fighting in the Turkish War of Independence, the new anthem served as motivational music for those at war, and as an aspirational hymn for a country yet to be created.\n\nToday, it is also the anthem of Northern Cyprus. Here’s a dive into its lyrics and history.\n\nRead more: Watch Andrea Bocelli perform at UEFA Euro 2020 Opening Ceremony\n\nWho wrote Turkey’s national anthem?\n\n724 poems were submitted to a competition to find the best original composition, that would form the words to Turkey’s anthem.\n\nA poem by Mehmet Akif Ersoy, who is regarded as among the greatest writers of his time, was adopted by the Turkish Grand National Assembly. His poem spoke to an affection for the Turkish homeland, long-desired freedom after the war, and a deep faith.\n\nA second competition took place to find the right musical setting for Ersoy’s poetry. 24 composers put forward their compositions, after which the Council chose the music of Ali Rifat Cagatay.\n\nEight years on, however, the music changed to a new composition by Osman Zeki Üngör, an established composer and the conductor of the Presidential Symphony Orchestra (watch today’s orchestra play below).\n\nTwo years later, the Turkish government commissioned Edgar Manas, a Turkish composer and conductor of Armenian descent, to arrange an orchestral version of Üngör’s melody. Manas’ arrangement is the version we hear today at state and military events, sporting events and school ceremonies.\n\nRead more: Turkish builders who worked tirelessly on concert hall treated to a concert\n\nWhat are the lyrics to Turkey’s national anthem?\n\nOnly the first two stanzas of the anthem tend to be sung at public events.\n\nKorkma! Sönmez bu şafaklarda yüzen al sancak,\n\nSönmeden yurdumun üstünde tüten en son ocak.\n\nO benim milletimin yıldızıdır, parlayacak;\n\nO benimdir, o benim milletimindir ancak.\n\nÇatma, kurban olayım, çehreni ey nazlı hilal!\n\nKahraman ırkıma bir gül; ne bu şiddet, bu celal?\n\nSana olmaz dökülen kanlarımız sonra helal…\n\nHakkıdır, Hakk’a tapan milletimin istiklal.\n\nWhat do they mean in English?"
