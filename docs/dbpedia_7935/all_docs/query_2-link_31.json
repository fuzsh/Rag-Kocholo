        "text": "PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- 19-year-old Melina Cruz, a college student from a Gold Star family, performed the National Anthem at the most recent Phillies home game.\n\nShe was raised in Northeast Philadelphia and recalls how singing helped her overcome a speech impediment at a very early age.\n\nThis was Cruz's fourth time performing at Citizens Bank Park. Each time she sings, she thinks of someone special.\n\nHer uncle, Teodoro Torres, Jr., was killed in the line of duty just the week before he was planning to return home. He was a recipient of a Bronze Star Medal and a Purple Heart.\n\nCruz wore her mother's Gold Star Lapel Button in memory of her uncle when she performed on June 5, 2024.\n\nNow a student at NYU Tisch School of the Arts, Cruz has a long list of musical dreams. Her biggest goal is to perform on Broadway."
