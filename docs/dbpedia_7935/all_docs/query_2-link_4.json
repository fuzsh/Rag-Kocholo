Dilley, 1894MusicAlexei Fyodorovich LvovAdopted1895 (by Pennsylvania)Relinquished1990 (by Pennsylvania)Succeeded by\"Pennsylvania\" (by Pennsylvania)Audio sample\n\n\"Hail, Pennsylvania!\" (instrumental)\n\n\"Hail, Pennsylvania!\" is a song written by Edgar M. Dilley (Class of 1897) as a submission to a University of Pennsylvania alumni committee-sponsored contest to write a song to the tune of \"God Save the Tsar!\", the national anthem of Imperial Russia, by Alexei Fyodorovich Lvov. Dilley was awarded $25 for creating it.[1] It served as the regional anthem of Pennsylvania until 1990 and now serves as the municipal anthem of Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nDilley was an assistant director with The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club. The piece was first performed by his group at its annual concert at the Academy of Music in 1895.[1] For many years, the song was performed at Franklin Field, when the football team suffered a loss. Today, the song is still performed at University functions and sporting events by The University of Pennsylvania Band and The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club.\n\nAside from becoming the alma mater of the University of Pennsylvania, the song also serves as the official song of Lackawanna County. Also, until 1990, the song served as the official song for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\nLyrics\n\n[edit]\n\nHail! Pennsylvania!\n\nNoble and strong;\n\nTo thee with loyal hearts,\n\nWe raise our song.\n\nSwelling to Heaven loud,\n\nOur praises ring;\n\nHail! Pennsylvania,\n\nOf thee we sing!\n\nMajesty as a crown\n\nRests on thy brow;\n\nPride, Honor, Glory, Love,\n\nBefore thee bow.\n\nNe'er can thy spirit die,\n\nThy walls decay;\n\nHail! Pennsylvania,\n\nFor thee we pray!\n\nHail! Pennsylvania!\n\nGuide of our youth;\n\nLead thou thy children on\n\nTo light and truth;\n\nThee, when death summons us,\n\nOthers shall praise,\n\nHail! Pennsylvania,\n\nThro' endless days![2]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nCheney, Edward Potts. History of the University of Pennsylvania, 1740-1940.
