        "text": "\"Montana\"\n\nLyrics: Charles Cohan\n\nMusic: Joseph E. Howard\n\nAdoption: 1945\n\nState Ballad\n\n\"Montana Melody\"\n\nLyrics: Carleen and LeGrande Harvey\n\nMusic: LeGrande Harvey\n\nAdoption: 1983\n\nHistory\n\nMontana’s state song was created under unusual circumstances that involved a Broadway musical, a party, and a great deal of enthusiasm. The Joseph Howard Production Company’s musical farce, The Goddess of Liberty, after finishing a three-week run on Broadway, was touring Montana in September 1910. After its performance in Butte, Joseph Howard was approached by a former member of his company, Mrs. E. Creighton Largey, who remarked that the play contained the song \"Illinois,\" but no song paying tribute to Montana. She challenged Howard, together with Charles C. Cohan, a local newspaper editor, to compose such a song for inclusion in the next performance. They completed the song in thirty minutes. Two days later, when the show came to Helena, the audience called for 12 encores of the song. At a party after the show, the governor, who had been in the audience, declared \"Montana\" the state song, but this designation did not become official until February 10, 1945.\n\n\"Montana Melody,\" written and composed by Carleen and LeGrand Harvey, was adopted as the official state ballad of Montana in 1983. The ballad was sung by 72 children from Jefferson High School in Helena when Governor Ted Schwinden signed the legislation.\n\nLyrics\n\n\"Montana\"\n\nTell me of that Treasure State\n\nStory always new,\n\nTell of its beauties grand\n\nAnd its hearts so true.\n\nMountains of sunset fire\n\nThe land I love the best\n\nLet me grasp the hand of one\n\nFrom out the golden West\n\nMontana, Montana, Glory of the West\n\nOf all the states from coast to coast, You're easily the best\n\nMontana, Montana, Where skies are always blue\n\nMontana, Montana I love you!\n\nEach country has its flow'r;\n\nEach one plays a part,\n\nEach bloom brings a longing hope\n\nTo some lonely heart.\n\nBitterroot to me is dear\n\nGrowing in my land\n\nSing then that glorious air\n\nThe one I understand.\n\nMontana, Montana, Glory of the West\n\nOf all the states from coast to coast, You're easily the best\n\nMontana, Montana, Where skies are always blue\n\nMontana, Montana I love you!\n\nCopyright © 1993-2024 World Trade Press.
