        "text": "The World Will Always Remember September 11\n\nThe ceremony in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania featured a welcome by Philadelphia Mayor Street and remarks by Pennsylvania Governor Schweiker followed by a ceremonial raising of the flag and a performance of the national anthem. United Flight 93 went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania on Sept. 11.\n\nA World United\n\nPresident Bush Salutes the Passengers of United Flight 93\n\n\"Our forefathers would salute the modern day sacrifice of the brave passengers on Flight 93, who, after reciting the Lord's Prayer, said, 'let's roll,' and stormed the hijackers, taking the plane down and probably saving thousands of lives on the ground.\"\n\nMrs. Bush \"We Will Always Remember\" United Flight 93\n\n\"A poet wrote, 'Love knows not its own depths until the hour of parting.' The loved ones we remember today knew  even in those horrible moments  that they were not truly alone, because your love was with them. And I want each of you to know today that you are not alone. We cannot ease the pain, but this country stands by you. We will always remember what happened that day, and to whom it happened.\"\n\nMrs. Cheney Remembers the Bravery of the Passengers on United Flight 93\n\n\"The men and women of Flight 93 were brave in a way few of us will even be called on to be, and they have inspired us. One proud citizen observed, \"In the past, the words of our anthem seemed abstract, referring to bravery in battles long over. But last weeks bravery, stemming from care and concern for others, was happening over and over before our eyes.\" . . . When we witness kindness, when we hear of heroism, we will remember them. And when we try ourselves to show regard for others and when we try ourselves to be brave, we will be creating the truest memorial for those who died on Flight 93.\""
