If you are watching the inauguration of Pennsylvania Governor-elect Tom Wolf, you heard the song "Pennsylvania." Chances are, you have never heard this song before.

We know we hadn't.

"Pennsylvania," it turns out, is the state song of Pennsylvania. Who knew?

"Pennsylvania" became the state song in 1990, so it hasn't been on the history books for too long. It also should not be confused with the Bloodhound Gang song of the same name.

Here are the lyrics for the official state song, courtesy of 50states.com.

Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania,

Mighty is your name,

Steeped in glory and tradition,

Object of acclaim,

Where brave men fought the foe of freedom,

Tyranny decried,

'Til the bell of independence filled the countryside.

Chorus

Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania,

May your future be filled with honor everlasting as your history.

Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania,

Blessed by God's own hand,

Birthplace of a mighty nation,

Keystone of the land.

Where first our country's flag unfolded,

Freedom to proclaim,

May the voices of tomorrow glorify your name.
