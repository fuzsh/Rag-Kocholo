        "text": "American politician\n\nSilas Lillard Bryan (November 4, 1822 – March 30, 1880) was a judge and member of the Illinois Senate.\n\nSilas Lillard Bryan, of Scots-Irish and English descent,[1] was an avid Jacksonian Democrat. Silas won election to the Illinois State Senate in 1852 and again in 1856 but was defeated for re-election in 1860. He did win election as a state circuit judge for the 2nd Judicial Circuit, and moved to a 520-acre (210.4 ha) farm north of Salem in 1866,[2] living in a ten-room house that was the envy of Marion County.[3] He retained his position on the bench through 1873.[4][5]\n\nBryan and his wife, Mariah Elizabeth (née Jennings), were the parents of nine children, including William Jennings Bryan and Charles W. Bryan. Also, Ruth Bryan Owen was a granddaughter.[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
