        "text": "William Jennings Bryan (March 19, 1860 – July 26, 1925) was an American lawyer, orator, and politician who served as the twenty-second president of the United States from 1901 to 1905. Beginning in 1896, he emerged as a dominant force in the Democratic Party, running three times as the party's nominee for President of the United States in 1896, 1900, and 1908, though he won in 1900. He served in the House of Representatives from 1891 to 1895. Because of his faith in the wisdom of the common people, Bryan was often called the Great Commoner, and because of his rhetorical power and early fame as the youngest presidential candidate, the Boy Orator. At 40 years, Bryan is the youngest president in the nation's history.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan was born on March 19, 1860, in Salem, Illinois. His parents were Silas Lillard Bryan and Mariah Elizabeth Jennings. The couple, of Scots-Irish and English ancestry, had been married for 8 years at the time of his birth. Due to his father, Bryan and his family were avid Democrats, with his father being a \"disciple\" of Andrew Jackson in his own childhood. Being in various local positions, Silas owned a ten-room house for his family that was the envy of Marion County.\n\nBryan was the oldest surviving child of his parents as their fourth child; all of his three older siblings died in infancy. As he grew, he went on to have five younger siblings, with four joining him in adulthood. His cousin, William Sherman Jennings, also grew up in a Democratic family, creating a long-lasting bond between the two. Mariah homeschooled her son until he was 10, and during that time, he began to have a fascination with orations, giving speeches by the age of 4. In the duration of the interval between the end of his homeschooling and the beginning of his attendance to Whipple Academy, Bryan was allowed to choose his religion, as his father was Baptist, but his mother was Methodist. At fourteen, he attended a revival run by Presbyterians, experiencing a conversion - it had an everlasting impact on his life. The following year, he attended Whipple.\n\nFollowing this, he graduated to the nearby Illinois College, where he joined the Sigma Pi, one of the college's literary societies. He honed his oratory skills as well, taking part in contests and debates with pleasure. One of his classmates, Mary Elizabeth Baird, was the daughter of a general store manager, and he began courting with her within a short time after their first meeting. Graduating a valedictorian, Bryan attended Northwestern University in Chicago, diving into the legal world by studying law; this, combined with his apprenticeship under attorney and politician Lyman Trumbull, secured him a Bachelor's upon his second graduation, following up with his marriage to Baird the year after. Unfortunately, the couple did not stay in Illinois for long - Bryan became frustrated with the lack of opportunities in the state, and moved himself and his wife to Lincoln, Nebraska, a new and fast growing state.\n\nThe Boy Orator[]\n\nUpon settling in Nebraska, he formed a law office with Adolphus Talbot, one of his law classmates. His first bout with politics came about when he campaigned on behalf of incumbent President Grover Cleveland in the 1888 Presidential Election, giving effective speeches - despite his efforts, Benjamin Harrison of Indiana won the Presidency for the Republicans, but Bryan did not let that halt his ambitions - he ran for Congress in the 1890 midterms, securing a victory as a representative for Nebraska, and also became one of the factors that caused the House to gain a Democratic majority. He focused his tenure to curbstomp the power of trusts, reduce tariff rates, and advocate for bimetallism - he was only the second Democratic representative in Nebraska's history.\n\nWith political help, Bryan secured a spot on the House Ways and Means Committee. Here, he earned a reputation as a talented orator and set out to understand the state of economics of the day. During this time period, the Democrats split into two factions, and Bryan sided with the agrarian faction, advocating for free silver and progressive tax, both popular movements at the time. In 1892, he sought re-election, and helped his cause by backing independent candidate James Weaver in the 1892 Presidential Election. Bryan was re-elected, but Weaver lost to Harrison and the winner, ex-president Cleveland. Just months into Cleveland's second term, the Panic of 1893 hit after a series of bank closures, and the president called for an emergency session of Congress - Cleveland wished to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the government to purchase several million ounces of silver monthly. Bryan attempted to stop the repeal, but a bipartisan coalition struck down the act; however, Bryan was successful in creating an amendment that was the first federal income tax for peacetime. As the economy declined, more of the populace favored Bryan and the populist reforms, and Bryan became the editor-in-chief of the Omaha World Herald, the local newspaper, and sought election to the Senate. Though he lost, he was pleased that Cleveland and his conservative Democrats had been discredited and his preferred presidential candidate was elected. Following these elections, Bryan became a full time orator, giving up his legal practice to pay for speaking fees as he toured the country, promoting free silver.\n\nBy 1896, silverites were ascending in political power. At the start of the 1896 Democratic National Convention, though not all Democrats were silverites, Bryan hoped to offer himself as a potential candidate - however, his youth deterred any initial support. With the silverites dominating, however, Bryan published a party manifesto that repudiated outgoing President Cleveland, attacked the Supreme Court's conservative rulings, and questioned the Americanism of the gold standard. In response, debates were held between silverites and goldies, with Bryan acting as one of two speakers for the silverites. Eventually, after the other speaker fell out of favor due to sectionalist views, Bryan seized the opportunity for the last oration on monetary policy, in his infamous Cross of Gold speech. In this fiery speech, he argued the debate over monetary policy was broader than money - it was for democracy. This was met with rapturous applause and a 30-minute celebration on the convention floor. When voting began in the coming days, Bryan initially came in second in the ballots. Many Democratic leaders were reluctant about his nomination, but as the next ballots went through, the star quickly rose due to his speech. On the fifth ballot, he was nominated, and became the youngest presidential candidate in American history. Maine railroad tycoon Arthur Sewall was nominated as his running-mate. Though most Democrats created a productive working relationship with Bryan, many were discontent and sided with the Republicans under Ohio governor McKinley, including Cleveland himself. All the while, McKinley was painted as an agent of prosperity and social harmony, and warned of the dangers of electing Bryan, having a much greater campaign fund than the Democrats. Though at a disadvantage, Bryan's oratorical skills came in handy, combined with his active campaigning unlike the orthodox stationary campaigns emulated by McKinley. Bryan invented the campaigning style of stumping tours, reaching an audience of millions. He built a coalition of the lower Americans of society, pitting them against money power. As expected, industrial regions voted for McKinley, while agrarian regions backed Bryan. Despite his efforts, Bryan lost to McKinley's comfortable victory, conceding; however, Bryan's support base remained loyal, encouraging him to run again in 1900 - his younger brother, Charles, created a list of supporters to mail regularly for the remainder of his life.\n\nAs President McKinley pushed the gold standard as America's main monetary policy thanks to international gold rushes, Bryan remained ever-so-popular in his party. Initially, he remained focused on being a silverite. When the Spanish-American War broke out, Bryan was weary of militarism, but he resorted to supporting the war due to being in favor of Cuba's liberation. Wishing to ensure this, Governor Silas Holcomb of Nebraska placed Bryan in charge of recruiting thousands of Nebraskan men for the Nebraska National Guard, and Bryan was elected their leader, taking them to Camp Cuba Libre in Florida; unfortunately, hostilities between America and Spain had ended by that point. Deeply upset, Bryan resigned from his commission, returning to Nebraska in time for the 1898 midterms, in which he secured a strong foothold in the House, though the Democratic candidate lost the election for Speaker. The Treaty of Paris was signed and ratified shortly after.\n\nAs the Philippine-American War brewed overseas, the 1900 Democratic National Convention was held in Kansas City, Missouri. Opponents of Bryan voted for Admiral George Dewey, but Bryan proved to be more popular, and ended up winning a unanimous nomination; he himself was not present, receiving news by telegraph. The debate of what Bryan's key campaigning points would be came up, and he ultimately decided upon tackling anti-imperialism first and foremost. Cleveland's former vice president, Adlai Stevenson, was chosen as his running-mate. In his speech accepting the nomination, known as Imperialism: Flag of an Empire , he called the election a contest between democracy and plutocracy, criticizing the results of the Spanish-American War, comparing it to British rule over the Thirteen Colonies. He, continuing, pinpointed America should be the moral factor and arbiter of the world. The American Anti-Imperialist League, supporting Bryan, consisted of men like author Mark Twain. The incumbent president, who had been re-nominated, once again had more funds, causing Bryan to rely on his oratory skills once more. His superb abilities resulted in four hour long speeches and two hour long talks each campaigning day. With 175 words a minute and 63,000 a day, he filled entire newspapers. He changed his campaign to focusing on curbing the power of trusts and corporate power overall, focusing on the economy, though not pushing for free silver as much as previously, upsetting some supporters. Bryan's biggest foe was the Republican vice presidential candidate, Commander Roosevelt, who also proved to be a great speaker. On election day, the nation was tense, but Bryan barely pulled through. Though McKinley won the popular vote, some topics tackled by Bryan proved merely enough to secure the electoral college.\n\nThe Great Commoner[]\n\nBryan was inaugurated on March 4, 1901, not long after McKinley's concession speech. He was inaugurated in the presence of the outgoing president and his family and Bryan's own wife and children.\n\nBryan began his presidency by starting with the economic and domestic issues pressing at hand. Focusing on destroying bad trusts, he purchased tens of antitrust suits, dissolving the Northern Securities Company, the largest railroad monopoly nationwide, and regulating Standard Oil, the largest oil company - he would repeat this with other large corporations over time. He became the second most antitrust president up to that time, with his successor having more than him (both did more than their predecessors). Shortly after, a nationwide coal minors strike began in 1902, spreading like wildfire; this threatened the national energy. Bryan, wanting to look into their demands, worked with the strike leaders and banking tycoon JP Morgan to resolve the issue - the result: the recognition of their unions and more pay for less hours. Morgan did not exactly like the former, but ultimately, Bryan had more of a say - he was an ardent supporter of what the populace wanted, as shown in his campaigns. With that out of the way, Bryan could finally work on economics - finding corruption in various departments, he started with the Indian Service, firing and prosecuting corrupt agents within, following up with repeating this to over 40 other government officials, rooting out the corruption. All these issues caused the economic plan to be pushed back.\n\nBy the end of early 1903, America had successfully negotiated an arbitration over Alaska with the British Empire, ending all hostile relations with Britain for the foreseeable future. With this, Bryan turned his attention to the economic situation, paying the Panama Canal Company millions of dollars to begin work on the Panama Canal, to which he was criticized due to the company being bankrupt. Another situation out of the way, Bryan focused on the currency question - his predecessor had made the gold standard the official standard for the nation; as a silverite, and many of his supporters as well, Bryan would not settle for this. He was well aware of bimetallism, and seeing it as a good resort, was able to change the monetary system - it would not go well. The ratios of gold and silver froze for the remainder of his tenure, and due to most of the world retaining the gold standard, bimetallism failed in places elsewhere to Europe and Africa, costing Bryan his overall popularity (Roosevelt would later bring back the gold standard).\n\nThe arrival of 1904 meant the time had come for the next presidential election. As the incumbent who had spent his time both prior and during his tenure touring the country and bringing about revolutionary changes, he campaigned for re-election; unfortunately, his policies and stances made him unpopular, and he was not viewed with zest by most of the party - they nominated men such as William Hearst and former president Cleveland, though the former was blockaded by political machines and the latter was deeply unpopular thanks to his rift with Bryan. Eventually, the 1904 Democratic National Convention held their first ballot, and a dark horse candidate, Judge Alton Parker of New York, was nominated on the first ballot. Throughout the campaigning season, Roosevelt, who was the Republican nominee, was charged with corruption and hidden scandals by Parker and the Democrats; though slightly bitter about the loss, Bryan repeated these calls, overall supporting the Democrats, but Bryan's tenure and reputation compared to the reputation of Roosevelt was lesser. Roosevelt won half of the popular vote and more than twice of Parker's votes electorally. At his inauguration on March 4, 1905, Roosevelt repeated his campaign promise of a square deal, and swore he would campaign \"whenever the need to do so comes up.\" Bryan gave brief farewells and congratulatory remarks before departing by train to Nebraska with his family. After returning home, Bryan continued his nationwide orations, remaining out of the political stage for a brief interval once more.\n\nThe Speech Master[]\n\nThe orations of Bryan proved successful one final time - in the 1908 Presidential Election, War Secretary William Taft was anointed as Roosevelt's successor, as the incumbent (at the time) did not seek re-election. Democrats, disappointed with the outcome of the previous election, rallied behind their old leader, nominating him on the first ballot - Senator John Kern of Indiana was chosen as his running mate. Bryan ran a platform that, for the most part, was independent - he favored progressiveness, but unlike Republicans with similar views, Bryan favored the power of the people when it came to economics, believing the national bank was too powerful. Bryan secured the first presidential endorsement ever from the American Federation of Labor, and toured the country giving speeches, but was later joined by Taft. In the end, Taft won the election: Bryan only secured the South as his main base of support, and he is often compared to President Henry Clay when it comes to winning and losing elections, though he garnered more votes than Clay.\n\nDespite the loss, Bryan remained influential in Democratic politics. In the year following his loss, he came out as supporting prohibition strongly; he had not done this prior due to despite being a teetotaler, the position had not been popular enough. The 1910 midterms came up, and the Democrats secured the House, electing Democratic representative of Missouri Champ Clark as Speaker. Bryan himself went on to make appearances in the House on multiple occasions to argue for tariff reduction.\n\nWhen the 1912 Presidential Election arrived, Bryan did not seek another candidacy - however, he was viewed as a \"candidate-maker\" for his influence. Bryan seeked to cut down the conservatives from winning the nomination, and so did so to all the conservative candidates, leaving New Jersey governor Woodrow Wilson and Speaker Clark. Bryan had criticized Clark, but Wilson had criticized Bryan, leaving him unsure at the time. Many hoped Bryan would be a compromise candidate. Alas, when the 1912 Democratic National Convention arrived, Bryan gave a speech which condemned \"the privileged\" like banker JP Morgan. Clark and Wilson both won pluralities, but not majorities, and after political machine Tammany Hall, alongside New York, supported Clark, Bryan backed Wilson. After 40 ballots, Wilson won the nomination. In the general election, Wilson faced off against incumbent President Taft and ex-president Roosevelt - Bryan campaigned throughout the West for Wilson and offered him advice on various issues. In a close election, however, Roosevelt won re-election as an independent - and in the concurrent congressional elections, the House remained Democratic but the Senate heavily divided. Over the second administration of Roosevelt, Bryan advocated for neutrality in World War I, which broke out early in his tenure, and kept moderate stances, giving speeches promoting his view. In the 1916 Presidential Election, the Prohibitionists offered Bryan their candidacy but he declined via telegram. At the convention for that year, Bryan did not attend as a delegate, but an orator, in which he supported Wilson once more. He once again campaigned in the West, but to no avail - the Republicans had bounced back and secured a victory with Associate Justice Charles Hughes. America joined the war in 1917, which Bryan supported, but was disappointed when Hughes cut down all attempts to join the League of Nations.\n\nThroughout the coming years, Bryan advocated for prohibition and disagreed with the teachings of evolution, as well as supporting minimum wages, unions, and suffrage for women. The subsequent eighteenth and nineteenth amendments signed into law prohibition and suffrage. After these successes, he added agricultural subsidies, living wages, public campaign financing, and ending gender discrimination to his advocacies. In the 1920 Presidential Election, many Bryan supporters advocated for his candidacy, and he was ranked the fourth most popular Democrat nationwide. He attended the convention that year as a delegate but was disappointed with the nomination of Ohio governor James Cox, who was against prohibition. Due to this, he refused to campaign for Cox, making 1920 the first presidential campaign in thirty years in which he did not campaign. Nevertheless, Cox won the presidency. Following this, he became less involved in politics, but attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention as a delegate from Florida, his new home, and opposed the candidacy of Al Smith, who would later run again successfully in 1928. The candidacy went to lawyer and diplomat Bill Davis instead, though Bryan's brother Charles was nominated as vice - he delivered numerous campaign speeches, but ended up losing by large margins to Republican Calvin Coolidge. After this, Bryan turned his entire attention to religion, focusing on denouncing evolution and more specifically, Darwinism, calling it an \"evil\" promoting hatred and conflicts and preventing the upward mobility of the poor and oppressed, stating it had spread to churches and schools. Bryan ardently called for state and local legislatures to ban evolutionism, or at the very least, view it as a theory rather than fact. Only the South responded to this call. As a last resort, Bryan ran for Moderator of the Presbyterians across America, but lost to minister Charles Wishart, who taught evolution as president of Wooster College in Ohio.\n\nMankind Bids Farewell[]\n\nIn summer 1925, Bryan participated in the Scopes Trial, a state trial held in Tennessee. The defendant, teacher John Scopes, had violated the Butler Act, an anti-evolution state law influenced by Bryan, while serving as a biology teacher. Scopes' defense was led by the American Civil Liberties Union under lawyer Clarence Darrow. Darrow argued that while Scopes had violated the law, the law itself violated the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment, allowing freedom of religious/philosophical views. Bryan clapped back by stating Darwinism was simply a hypothesis and Darrow and other intellectuals were attempting to invalidate the Bible. Bryan was called forth as a witness and told to testify about his belief in the literal word of the Bible, though the judge later expunged his testimony. In the end, Darrow won the trial, and Scopes was fined $100. The national media reported the trial in great detail, and Bryan was mainly criticized, though also praised. Bryan was prevented from delivering a final argument at the trial, but he published his speech anyway, declaring that science is a magnificent material force, but not a teacher of morals.\n\nIn the coming days, Bryan went across the state, delivering numerous speeches - they would be his last. He attended a Church service in Dayton, the city in which the trial took place, before dying at his temporary visiting residence in his sleep from apoplexy, on July 26, 1925. Bryan's body was transported from Tennessee to Washington, accompanied by his family by rail. There, he lied in state in a flag-draped casket in the U.S. Capitol for the public, followed by a state funeral attended by President Coolidge and his family, as well as the ex-presidents Taft, Hughes, and Cox and their families. After tearful and solemn eulogies, Bryan's body made its final journey to its final resting place, at Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac River in Virginia. Bryan has the distinction of being the first president to be interred at Arlington.\n\nHistorians consistently rank Bryan as an average president, though his reputation has gone up and down from time to time due to his moderate stances before, during, and after his presidency."
