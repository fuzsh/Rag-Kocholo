William Allen (Will) Bryan45,46,115,123,124,131,139,239,240,241,242,243 was born on 8 September 1849 in Sevier County, Tennessee.45,46,116,123,124,139,240,242,243 His death certificate says he was born 8 Sep in 1847. His tombstone says he was born 8 Sep 1849. Census data suggest that the 1849 date is correct. The fact that he was called Will Bryan rather than William or Bill is from family oral history as provided by Robert E. Bryan. The only written record that has been found that lists his given name as Will is the 1920 census.\n\nCensus: 1850, Sevier County, Tennessee,45 William 1 m w TN, enumerated Household of his father Peter H.

Will thereafter lived on the land the rest of his life. His wife Malissa continued to live in the same house until her own death eighteen years after Will died. The house is still standing, and is still occupied by the current owners.\n\nBook R, page 175, State of Tennessee, Sevier County. We Peter H. Bryan and wife Mary A.

It may have been a simple enumeration error. More likely, the ages for William Bryan age 74 and W. E. Bryan age 40 could have been reversed. Which is to say that the 74 year old man was probably William Enyard Bryan and the 40 year old man was probably William Allen Bryan. There were no other men named William Bryan in District 8 of Sevier County at the time.\n\nCensus: 1900, Sevier County, Tennessee.124 Dist. 8, Enumeration District 143, Sevier County, Tennessee, 6 Jun 1900, enumerated by James B.
