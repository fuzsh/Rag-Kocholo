        "text": "Jerita O’Bryan, age 82, passed away Thursday, December 29th, 2022, at Hays Medical Center. She was born October 28th, 1940, in Shreveport, Louisiana, to Estell Horn.\n\nJerita attended Mount Carmel High School in Florien, LA. She wore many hats throughout her life. She was a military wife for 38 years, moving frequently with each endeavor, always landing on her feet and ready to make the next place home for her family. She worked many jobs from being a stay-at-home mom, cashier, clerk, grade school secretary, and retired from the City of Hugoton as a power plant operator of 19 years.\n\nOn April 30th, 1956, she married her husband of 57 years, Lonnie Irvin O’Bryan, in Sabine Parish, Louisiana, who passed away on November 10th, 2013. During their marriage, they had three children, Lonnie (Buddy), Tracy and Kerry.\n\nJerita loved her flower garden, planting trees, birds (especially cardinals), doing ceramics, sewing, and crocheting afghans for her family. She also supported animal rescue and 4-H.\n\nIn her later years, Jerita’s retirement was spent selflessly raising an unexpected second family of three very young grandchildren with her husband, taking very little time for herself. They moved to Wakefield, Kansas in 2003, with a view of Milford Lake, which her grandchildren very much enjoyed as they grew up and went to school.\n\nIn May of 2021, she moved to western Kansas to be closer to family and to have the help she needed along the way, as she finally admitted she could no longer do it alone. She was preceded in death by her mother, Estell, husband Lonnie and granddaughter Karly Werry.\n\nJerita is survived by three children, son Lonnie O’Bryan & wife Dona of Carlton, daughter Tracy Noel & husband Vincent of Gove, and son Kerry O’Bryan of Shelbina. Seven grandchildren, Sean O’Bryan & wife Jeanine; Zane O’Bryan & wife Rosalie; Devin O’Bryan & wife Mariah, Ruby Noel, Ivee Noel, Gillian O’Bryan, and Shoshannah Estell; and seven great-grandchildren, Cora & Adrian Werry; Seven & Silas O’Bryan; Dreyson Noel-Harvey; Alyssa & Julius O’Bryan.\n\nNo Services were requested. In inurnment at a later date at the WaKeeney Veterans Cemetery in WaKeeney, KS\n\nMemorial contributions are suggested to Wakefield Public Library, 205 3rd St, Wakefield, KS 67487, or Faithful Friends Cemetery, 1442 Barn Road, Solomon, KS 67480. Donations may be sent to Schmitt Funeral Home, 336 North 12th Street, WaKeeney, KS, 67672\n\nCondolences may be left for the family by visiting www.schmittfuneral.com"
