Born on March 6, 1939, in Yeaddiss, Kentucky, Silas led a remarkable life filled with love, dedication, and service to others.\n\nSilas was a man of unwavering faith and spent countless hours reading his Bible. His spiritual devotion guided him throughout his life, offering him strength and solace in times of challenge and joy.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Silas proudly served his country as a United States Navy Veteran. His service in the Navy reflected his deep love for his homeland and the values it stood for. After leaving the military, Silas embarked on a career as a miner. He worked diligently in the mining industry for many years before transitioning to become an M.S.H.A. Inspector. Silas took pride in his work and upheld the highest standards of safety and regulation enforcement.\n\nOutside of work and military service, Silas enjoyed various hobbies and interests that brought him joy. He had a passion for playing the guitar and would often spend hours strumming melodies that resonated deep within him.

Engaging in outdoor activities like corn hole and golf also brought him immense pleasure.\n\nSilas made significant contributions to his community and actively participated in several organizations. He was dedicated to the Perry County DAV Chapter #64 as well as the DAV Auxillary, where he selflessly served those who had bravely fought for our country.

Napier of Yeaddiss, KY. He is also survived by step-son William Moore (Rhonda) of Cambridge, IN, and step-daughter Deborah Moore (Mitch) of Hazard, KY. Silas leaves behind eight grandchildren and a host of great-grandchildren who will cherish his memory for generations to come.\n\nTo honor Silas's life and offer support to those who loved him, visitation will be held on December 20, 2023, from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM at Walker Funeral Homes, LLC in Hyden, Kentucky. The funeral service will take place the following day, December 21, 2023, at 1:00 PM at the same location. Interment will follow in the KY Veteran Cemetery South East located at Hyden, KY.
