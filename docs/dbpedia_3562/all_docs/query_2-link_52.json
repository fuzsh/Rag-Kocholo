Henry Clay: Statesman for the Union. New York: W.W. Norton Co., 1991. Biography from Encarta Encyclopedia: Clay, Henry (1777-1852), American statesman, who was secretary of state under John Quincy Adams and an unsuccessful candidate for the presidency in 1824, 1832, and 1844. He was one of the most popular and influential political leaders in American history. His genius in the art of compromise three times resolved bitter political conflicts that threatened to tear the nation apart, winning him the title The Great Pacificator. Clay was born on April 12, 1777, in Hanover County, Virginia, to a middle-class family. After studying for the bar with the eminent George Wythe, Clay, at the age of 20, moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where he developed a thriving practice. He was blessed with a quick mind, a flair for oratory, and an ability to charm both sexes with his easy, attractive manner. That he loved to drink and gamble was no drawback in an age that admired both vices. Clay, ambitious for worldly success, married into a wealthy and socially prominent family and soon gained entry into Kentucky's most influential circles. While still in his 20s, he was elected to the state legislature, in which he served for six years, until 1809. Congressman Clay established his great reputation in the United States House of Representatives, where he served intermittently from 1811 to 1825. In his first term, he became one of the leading \"War Hawks\"-the young men whose clamor for hostilities with England helped bring about the War of 1812. Clay was selected as one of the commissioners who in 1814 negotiated the Treaty of Ghent, ending that war. In 1820-21 it was Clay above all who engineered the Missouri Compromise, quieting the harsh controversy that had erupted by maintaining an equal balance between free and slave states. Although he himself was a slave owner, Clay's views on slavery-as on most other issues-were moderate. He was thus able to command the support of men fearful of extremism. In the presidential election of 1824, after his own candidacy had failed, Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams, whom the House early in 1825 elected as the sixth president. When Adams named Clay secretary of state, his Jacksonian opponents charged \"corrupt bargain!\" The charge was unfair, but Clay was haunted by it throughout his subsequent career. Although Clay was a practical politician of flexible rather than rigid beliefs, he did emerge as the great champion of the \"American System.\" He called for a protective tariff in support of home manufactures, internal improvements (federal aid to local road and canal projects), a strong national bank, and distribution of the proceeds of federal land sales to the states. Whig Leader Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1831, Clay served in that body until 1842 and again from 1849 until his death. In 1833 he devised a compromise tariff that resolved the crisis brought on by South Carolina's attempt to \"nullify\" the prevailing tariff set by Congress. In the same period he became a leader of the new Whig Party that emerged to oppose Andrew Jackson's administration. Perhaps the most heartbreaking event of Clay's career was his close defeat in the presidential contest of 1844, when his reluctance to back the annexation of Texas cost him support in the South. Many believe that his greatest service to the nation came in 1850, when he helped win acceptance for a compromise that ended, at least temporarily, the threat of civil war over the issue of slavery in the new territories. He died in Washington, D.C., on June 29, 1852.\n\nContributed By: Edward Pessen\n\n\"Clay, Henry,\" Microsoft(R) Encarta(R) 98 Encyclopedia. (c) 1993-1997 Microsoft Corporation.

Her obituary from the Lexington Herald, March 30, 1920: Mrs. John Morrison Clay died Monday morning at her home, Ashland-on-the Tates Creek Pike. She was 85 years old and had been ill all winter, but not in a serious condition until with the last few weeks. Mrs. Clay was the widow of John Morrison Clay, the youngest son of Kentucky's famous statesman, Henry Clay. She was Miss Josephine D. Russell, the daughter of Col. and Mrs. William H. Russell, and was born in Fulton, Missouri. Her father was a well known man in public life, a jurist and statesman and the devoted friend of Henry Clay. She was twice married, her first husband having been Col. Eugene Erwin, the grandson of Henry Clay, who was killed at the Battle of Vicksburg, and Mrs. Clay's two daughters surviving her are the children of that marriage, Mrs. Minor Simpson, of Ashland-on-the Tates Creek Pike, and Mrs. M. W. Anderson of Kansas City who came several days ago called by her mother's illness. She leaves also five grandchildren, Eugene Erwin Simpson, Miss Josephine Simpson, Henry Clay Simpson, Henry Clay Anderson, and Matthew William Anderson. The funeral of Mrs. Clay will be held Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock at Christ Church Cathedral and the burial will be in the family lot at the Lexington Cemetery. In the passing of Mrs. Clay, Lexington loses perhaps the most remarkable woman of her generation, a writer of prose and poetry, a successful business woman, fearless and intrepid in spirit, brilliant in mind and admired for beauty, wit and all the womanly graces as well. She was engaged in activities which won for her a national fame, having been the world's most noted and successful woman owner and breeder of fine thoroughbred horses. At the death of her husband, Mr. John Morrison Clay, August 10, 1887, she succeeded to his business of rearing and racing thoroughbreds and under the Ashland colors, yellow and blue, won several of the classics of the turf. From an illustrated article which appeared in one of the magazines several years ago called \"The World's Most Noted Woman\" the following is quoted: \"With scarcely half a dozen brood mares in her possession, Mrs. John M. Clay, proprietor of the famous Ashland Stud in Kentucky, has had more great horses than a number of the famous stock farms in which thousands of dollars are invested.\" Mrs. Clay strolls among her mares and horses at will. They all seem to know her and have learned to appreciate the tender care with which she guards them. Of all persons interested in breeding and rearing the thoroughbred horse in America there are none as picturesque as this Kentucky authoress who, in spite of this and other business cares, finds time to give the public popular stories, her latest novel, \"Uncle Phil,\" being now in its second edition. The life of Mrs. Clay was closely interwoven with the Henry Clay family as her first husband, Col. Erwin, whom she met while on a trip to California, was the son of Henry Clay's fifth child, Anne Clay, his father being James Erwin of New Orleans. Being brilliant and accomplished her father took special pride in her and she was said to be more like him in intellect than any of his eleven children. Col. Erwin was an officer of the Sixth Regiment of Missouri Volunteers and was killed while leading a charge against the enemy at the battle of Vicksburg. He had been a leader on half a dozen battlefields where he was noted for his coolness, daring and bravery. After his death Mrs. Erwin and her children came to live at the home which was part of the original tract of land settled by Henry Clay more than 100 years ago and several years later was married to Mr. John Morrison Clay, the youngest son of the Sage of Ashland and the namesake of the founder of Morrison Chapel. Of the pioneer and aristocratic lineage on all sides it seemed the birthright of Mrs. Clay to perform unusual duties and to meet with success in her undertakings. While a girl she read the works of the world's greatest writers and with her observations on many trips with her father she was thus splendidly equipped. An article says of her that she first appeared in print against her will. She had been on a trip to Mexico and as they came through California she was asked to write of some of their experiences. She refused the requests, but her father required her to comply and after writing the article she added as a postscript, \"my father made me write this\". The editor was very much amused at this and when the article appeared it was widely read and copied in the other California papers. Mrs. Clay took great pride in her old home and its many valuable Clay relics. It was there that the wife of Henry Clay, Lucretia Hart, died. Among the most noted of the writings of Mrs. Clay were: \"John Logan\" dedicated to Henry Clay; \"Some Little of the Angel Still Left,\" \"Uncle Phil\" and her last work, \"The Sport of Kings,\" a group of racing stories. A patriot, a suffragist, a musician and a scientific gardener were some of the other qualifications of this wonderful Kentucky woman. During the Civil war she devoted a great deal of time to work for the soldiers and when the United States went to war with Germany she recalled her accomplishment of knitting and made more than 100 pairs of socks. She had not finished her self-imposed quota when the armistice was signed and she sent many of the pairs to Belgium to be presented to the common soldiers of that country who had won her admiration. She said that in all her life nothing had given her more pleasure than this knitting she had done for the soldiers. At a meeting of the International Conference of Women, held at Toronto, Canada, a few years ago. Mrs. Clay was asked to make all address. She could not be present but wrote the address and sent it to be read at the conference. Her subject was \"Women and the Professions.\" After expressing her opinion that women could succeed in all the professions, Mrs. Clay tells in the address of her experience as a horse breeder. She says that she sold one yearling for $8,200, which won three of the Kentucky Derby honors and the rich Realization stake at $41,000. The address was printed in the Kansas City Star and in several other newspapers. Private funeral services will be held for Mrs. Clay at Christ Church Cathedral Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the Very Rev. Robert K. Massie, dean of the Cathedral, officiating. The pallbearers will be Dr. Thomas Bullock, Thomas H. Shelby, W. K. Berry, James A. Todd, Colonel C. D. Clay, Captain T. J. Clay, Prof. Walter Patterson, Louis des Cognets.

Her obituary from the Lexington Intelligencer: DIED, very suddenly, on Thursday evening last, at The Woodlands, the seat of James Erwin, Esq., his amiable consort, Mrs. ANN B. ERWIN, the last surviving daughter of the Hon. Henry Clay, in the 29th year of her age. Her death, which was almost instantaneous, is supposed to have been caused by the rupture of a blood vessel. The funeral service was performed by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Smith, on Saturday morning; and her remains were conveyed to the vault, attended by a numerous train of citizens, which attested her worth, as well as the general sympathy and regret experienced on the occasion. She has left her honored parents and five children, with a heart-bleeding husband, and numerous other friends, to lament her untimely death. It is with our friends, as with our health, and a thousand other blessings - we rarely appreciate them as we ought, till we are taught their value, by a painful deprivation. Hence, when we are near relations and intimate connections are taken away, we are often led to exaggerate their virtues by posthumous praise. Hence the fulsome eulogy, which sometimes crowds the obituary column, or exhibits the vanity of the survivor, instead of the character of the deceased, on the marble monument. But this must not prevent departed merit from receiving the tributary notice, which is justly due. In the death of Mrs. Erwin, society has sustained no ordinary loss. With a mind highly cultivated and improved, with a taste which left nothing it touched unadorned, with a temper always cheerful, amiable and kind, with a deportment dignified and decided, yet simple, artless and condescending, in the unlimited enjoyment of all that wealth and affluence could bestow, she was yet not unmindful of that better part which could never be taken from her. Several years since, she became hopefully pious, and a communicant in the Protestant Episcopal Church, of which had since lived an exemplary member. In short, possessed of everything which could render life desirable to herself or her friends, she has been suddenly torn away, by a Wisdom which we dare not presume to scan, and is gone to reap the rich rewards which await \"the good and faithful servant,\" in another and a brighter world. \"The Woodlands\" are still there. The stately mansion - the hospitable board - the spacious gardens, the tasteful walks, the extensive pleasure grounds - the trees, the shrubs and the flowers - but where is the spirit that animated the whole? Gone, alas, forever! - and the once brilliant scene is now shrouded, not only in the gloom of winter, but in the habiliments of woe. Spring will, indeed, soon return - \"the Woodlands\" will again be decked in green - the flowers will again bloom, in all their wonted fragrance and beauty - and the gay tenants of the grove will again be warbling \"their native woodnotes wild\" - but where will be the Taste that contrived, the Hand that planted, and the Eye that enjoyed and gladdened this wilderness of sweets! - Where the lovely Form, that gave life, and interest and beauty, and song, and sentiment, to the whole? The heart-broken husband may be there, but he will be alone. The darling little ones, the prattling infants, may be there; but no maternal bosom on which to rest - to soothe their sorrows, or to participate in their joys. The fond and doting parents may call, but no daughter to embrace and welcome and them in. But we forbear. While our society deplores the painful event, by which it has been thus suddenly deprived of one of its brightest ornaments, we cannot but mingle our tears, with those of the bereaved relations, to whom the loss is irreparable. No event of this kind, in this city, could be more deeply felt, or more powerfully impress us with the serious truth that, In the midst of life we are in death; or, with the solemn admonition, \"Be ye also ready!\"\n\nAnne Brown Clay and James Erwin had the following children:\n\n33 i.

Her obituary from the Lexington Herald, March 30, 1920: Mrs. John Morrison Clay died Monday morning at her home, Ashland-on-the Tates Creek Pike. She was 85 years old and had been ill all winter, but not in a serious condition until with the last few weeks. Mrs. Clay was the widow of John Morrison Clay, the youngest son of Kentucky's famous statesman, Henry Clay. She was Miss Josephine D. Russell, the daughter of Col. and Mrs. William H. Russell, and was born in Fulton, Missouri. Her father was a well known man in public life, a jurist and statesman and the devoted friend of Henry Clay. She was twice married, her first husband having been Col. Eugene Erwin, the grandson of Henry Clay, who was killed at the Battle of Vicksburg, and Mrs. Clay's two daughters surviving her are the children of that marriage, Mrs. Minor Simpson, of Ashland-on-the Tates Creek Pike, and Mrs. M. W. Anderson of Kansas City who came several days ago called by her mother's illness. She leaves also five grandchildren, Eugene Erwin Simpson, Miss Josephine Simpson, Henry Clay Simpson, Henry Clay Anderson, and Matthew William Anderson. The funeral of Mrs. Clay will be held Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock at Christ Church Cathedral and the burial will be in the family lot at the Lexington Cemetery. In the passing of Mrs. Clay, Lexington loses perhaps the most remarkable woman of her generation, a writer of prose and poetry, a successful business woman, fearless and intrepid in spirit, brilliant in mind and admired for beauty, wit and all the womanly graces as well. She was engaged in activities which won for her a national fame, having been the world's most noted and successful woman owner and breeder of fine thoroughbred horses. At the death of her husband, Mr. John Morrison Clay, August 10, 1887, she succeeded to his business of rearing and racing thoroughbreds and under the Ashland colors, yellow and blue, won several of the classics of the turf. From an illustrated article which appeared in one of the magazines several years ago called \"The World's Most Noted Woman\" the following is quoted: \"With scarcely half a dozen brood mares in her possession, Mrs. John M. Clay, proprietor of the famous Ashland Stud in Kentucky, has had more great horses than a number of the famous stock farms in which thousands of dollars are invested.\" Mrs. Clay strolls among her mares and horses at will. They all seem to know her and have learned to appreciate the tender care with which she guards them. Of all persons interested in breeding and rearing the thoroughbred horse in America there are none as picturesque as this Kentucky authoress who, in spite of this and other business cares, finds time to give the public popular stories, her latest novel, \"Uncle Phil,\" being now in its second edition. The life of Mrs. Clay was closely interwoven with the Henry Clay family as her first husband, Col. Erwin, whom she met while on a trip to California, was the son of Henry Clay's fifth child, Anne Clay, his father being James Erwin of New Orleans. Being brilliant and accomplished her father took special pride in her and she was said to be more like him in intellect than any of his eleven children. Col. Erwin was an officer of the Sixth Regiment of Missouri Volunteers and was killed while leading a charge against the enemy at the battle of Vicksburg. He had been a leader on half a dozen battlefields where he was noted for his coolness, daring and bravery. After his death Mrs. Erwin and her children came to live at the home which was part of the original tract of land settled by Henry Clay more than 100 years ago and several years later was married to Mr. John Morrison Clay, the youngest son of the Sage of Ashland and the namesake of the founder of Morrison Chapel. Of the pioneer and aristocratic lineage on all sides it seemed the birthright of Mrs. Clay to perform unusual duties and to meet with success in her undertakings. While a girl she read the works of the world's greatest writers and with her observations on many trips with her father she was thus splendidly equipped. An article says of her that she first appeared in print against her will. She had been on a trip to Mexico and as they came through California she was asked to write of some of their experiences. She refused the requests, but her father required her to comply and after writing the article she added as a postscript, \"my father made me write this\". The editor was very much amused at this and when the article appeared it was widely read and copied in the other California papers. Mrs. Clay took great pride in her old home and its many valuable Clay relics. It was there that the wife of Henry Clay, Lucretia Hart, died. Among the most noted of the writings of Mrs. Clay were: \"John Logan\" dedicated to Henry Clay; \"Some Little of the Angel Still Left,\" \"Uncle Phil\" and her last work, \"The Sport of Kings,\" a group of racing stories. A patriot, a suffragist, a musician and a scientific gardener were some of the other qualifications of this wonderful Kentucky woman. During the Civil war she devoted a great deal of time to work for the soldiers and when the United States went to war with Germany she recalled her accomplishment of knitting and made more than 100 pairs of socks. She had not finished her self-imposed quota when the armistice was signed and she sent many of the pairs to Belgium to be presented to the common soldiers of that country who had won her admiration. She said that in all her life nothing had given her more pleasure than this knitting she had done for the soldiers. At a meeting of the International Conference of Women, held at Toronto, Canada, a few years ago. Mrs. Clay was asked to make all address. She could not be present but wrote the address and sent it to be read at the conference. Her subject was \"Women and the Professions.\" After expressing her opinion that women could succeed in all the professions, Mrs. Clay tells in the address of her experience as a horse breeder. She says that she sold one yearling for $8,200, which won three of the Kentucky Derby honors and the rich Realization stake at $41,000. The address was printed in the Kansas City Star and in several other newspapers. Private funeral services will be held for Mrs. Clay at Christ Church Cathedral Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock, the Very Rev. Robert K. Massie, dean of the Cathedral, officiating. The pallbearers will be Dr. Thomas Bullock, Thomas H. Shelby, W. K. Berry, James A. Todd, Colonel C. D. Clay, Captain T. J. Clay, Prof. Walter Patterson, Louis des Cognets. Burial services will be private.\n\nAt 23 years of age Andrew became the father of Lucretia Clay Erwin in Independence, MO, June 12, 1854.

The slave schedules for 1860 in Jackson County, Missouri list Eugene Erwin as owning one black female age 13.\n\nAt 30 years of age Andrew became the father of Mary Webster Erwin in Jackson Co, Mo, February 5, 1861. At 33 years of age Andrew became the father of Eugenia Erwin January 26, 1864. His biography from History of Kentucky by Judge Charles Kerr (Chicago and New York, 1922) follows: Col. Eugene Erwin was a soldier whose record of action and high character entitles him to all the honors paid a military career in every age of the world. He was born at Woodlands, adjoining Lexington, then the home of his father, James Erwin, whose wife was the favorite child of Henry Clay. Eugene Erwin lived for several years in Missouri. He was in Missouri when the war broke out between the North and South, and immediately offered his services to the Confederacy. His military career of about two years was most brilliant. He was a magnetic leader, was idolized by his soldiers, and until his heroic death he was almost constantly at posts of danger. He was commissioned major by the commander of the State Guards of Missouri, and participated in the battles of Wilson's Creek, Lexington and Sugar Creek, also Springfield and Elkhorn Tavern. Then on leaving Missouri and joining the forces east of the Mississippi he was made lieutenant colonel and given command of a battalion. He led the assault upon the attack of Iuka, after which he was commissioned colonel and assigned to the command of a regiment. He and his regiment were also assigned prominent places in the advance upon Corinth, and after that ill-starred attack, only thirty members of his regiment were able to answer roll call. His regimental flag carried in that and many subsequent engagements was never captured, and is now in the possession of his grandson Eugene Erwin Simpson of Lexington. Colonel Erwin himself was severely wounded at Corinth, but in a month had rejoined his command. At the beginning of the battle in front of Port Gibson, May l, 1863, he was ordered to re-enforce the left wing of the Confederate command, and after a forced march of eight miles made in 2 1/2 hours brought his command on the ground at a critical moment, when the entire left of the Confederates was threatened with defeat. To save the day he advanced the head of his column to a position within twenty yards of the enemy, and for an hour and a half his solitary regiment sustained the shock of the entire Federal attack. He went into the battle with 520 men, as the official report shows, lost in killed and wounded eighty-three, and by a remarkable skill in maneuvering and in deflective strategy fought and held his position until almost surrounded, and then under heavy fire made good his withdrawal, his individual command alone standing between an overwhelming defeat of the entire left wing of the Confederate army. Then followed the siege of Vicksburg, during which the Sixth Regiment of Missouri Infantry with its commander, Colonel Erwin, was assigned to emergency duty within the city, re-enforcing points against which the heaviest attack of the enemy was delivered. The climax of Colonel Erwin's career as a soldier came on the afternoon of the 25th of June, 1863. Ordered with his regiment to support some hard pressed Louisianans, who were defending a portion of the fortifications where the Federals had exploded a mine and were crowding through the shattered parapet, Colonel Erwin, shouting \"Follow me, boys\" rushed forward to lead the charge. Three musket balls passed through his body. At his fall his men with a hoarse, hungry roar of rage sprang out among the enemy. Then and there occurred the bloodiest fight of that memorable siege. When the paroled army passed out of surrendered Vicksburg only twenty-five of the Sixth Missouri were able to pass out with it. The brigadier-general's commission sent to Richmond to Colonel Erwin arrived too late--it had been canceled by death. Thereafter the Sixth Missouri as an individual unit lost its identity. Colonel Erwin was not only the idol of his own men, but his exploits commanded the admiration of his enemies. After he was wounded at Corinth special permission was granted Mrs. Erwin to come South through the lines, and after the surrender of Vicksburg General Grant furnished her with a pass and transportation to return to her home.\n\nHis obituary from The Daily Citizen, Vickburg, Mississippi issue of June 30, 1863 follows: OBITUARY COL. EUGENE ERWIN. Another brave and noble spirit has fallen. On Thursday evening, June 24th, Col. Eugene Erwin of the 6th Regiment Missouri Vols. was killed while mounted upon the works with a view to leading a charge against the enemy. He was struck with a minnie ball which passed through his body, killing him instantly. For several weeks previous to his death his health had been delicate, and at times compelled his absence from the field. During the siege of this place, he had more than once been driven to his bed, and on the day of his death he was out contrary to the advice and urgency of his friends, feeling, as he said, that it was his duty, so long as he could stand, to stand at his post. No one felt more than he did the importance of every man's discharging his duty - no one did more to discharge it. Col. Erwin, at the first outbreak of the war, left his home and family and offered himself a willing sacrifice upon the altar of his country's liberty. He has borne deprivation and hardships of [the duty?]. Throughout the campaigns of Gen. Price in Missouri, Arkansas and Mississippi, and this without a murmur, he has ever shown himself an excellent soldier and a gallant officer. More than a half dozen battlefields - Elk Horn, Corinth and Port Gibson included - hear testimony to his coolness and daring bravery. He was strict in discipline, yet generous, kind and true, possessing the confidence and esteem of all his men and officers. He esteemed religion highly, and did all in his power to promote its interests. Those who knew him best loved him most; for the more intimate the acquaintances, the brighter shown the excellence of his character. But he has fallen - fallen at his post defending the cause of justice and truth. At midnight's hour amid the roar of cannon and the whistling of enemy's balls, we bore him gently and laid him in the soldier's humble grave, where he shall rest in peace till he is called forth to his reward in the resurrection morn.\n\nHe by his example speaks --\n\n\"'Twere sweet to live, yet I can die, And in the grave forgotten lie, To know I have my duty done, And nobly life's last triumph won. Know ye my comrades in the field, I die a freeman's death; Cease not to wield the battleshield With life's last lingering breath - The banner which we bore on high, Still bid it all their hosts defy - For where the war tide wild shall wave, So fit to be a soldier's grave.\"\n\nHe leaves a wife and three sweet little girls to mourn his loss. May our Heavenly Father sustain and comfort them in their bed of bereavement and grant them all a happy reunion in ....

Desha was the son of William Campbell Preston Breckinridge and Issa Desha. Desha died February 19, 1935 at 67 years of age. His biography from The Kentucky Encyclopedia follows: BRECKINRIDGE, DESHA. Desha Breckinridge, newspaper editor and reformer, was born August 4, 1867, in Lexington, Kentucky, the son of U.S. congressman W.C.P and Issa (Desha) Breckinridge. He attended State College in Lexington and graduated from Princeton University in 1889. After studying law at Columbia University and the University of Virginia, he joined his father's Lexington law firm. In 1897 Breckinridge and his father bought the Lexington Herald, where Breckinridge served as managing editor and, after his father's death in 1904, as editor. A Democrat, Breckinridge was frequently at odds with both parties in championing such causes as regulation of business, child labor laws, improvements in education, prison reform, and women's suffrage. He married Madeline McDowell on November 17, 1898, and, largely through the pages of the Herald, the two became leaders of the Progressive movement in Kentucky. Active in thoroughbred racing, Breckinridge by 1922 was ranked as one of the top twenty horsemen in the country. In 1906 Breckinridge was instrumental in creating a state racing commission, under which pari-mutuel betting replaced bookmaking. Madeline Breckinridge died in 1920, and, on July 27, 1929, the widower married Mary Frazer LeBus. Breckinridge died on February 18, 1935, and was buried in Lexington Cemetery. See James Klotter, The Breckinridges of Kentucky, 1760-1981 (Lexington, Ky., 1986). MELBA PORTER HAY\n\nHer biography from the Encyclopedia Britannica: ENCYCLOPÆDIA BRITANNICA\n\nBreckinridge, Madeline McDowell b. May 20, 1872, Woodlake, Ky., U.S. d. Nov. 25, 1920, Lexington, Ky. née MADELINE MCDOWELL American social reformer whose efforts focused on child welfare, health issues, and women's rights. Educated in Lexington, Kentucky, and at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, she studied intermittently during 1890-94 at the State College (now University) of Kentucky. In 1898 she married Desha Breckinridge, editor of the Lexington Herald and brother of Sophonisba P. Breckinridge. In 1900 she began her career in social reform by urging the establishment of a settlement house near the impoverished rural town of Proctor, Kentucky. In the same year, she helped found the Women's Emergency Committee (later reorganized as the Lexington Civic League). The league agitated successfully for the establishment of playgrounds and kindergartens in poorer districts of the city and for legislation setting up a juvenile court system, regulating child labour, and compelling school attendance. Also in 1900 Breckinridge led in founding the Lexington Associated Charities, which organized community charity along modern casework lines.\n\nPlagued by tuberculosis, Breckinridge from 1905 was active in local, county, and state tuberculosis societies. She helped secure establishment of the state Tuberculosis Commission in 1912 and served as its vice president until 1916, in which year her fund-raising campaign culminated in the opening of the Blue Grass (later the Julius Marks) Sanatorium in Lexington. In 1906 she was appointed to the State Federation of Women's Clubs, and working through that body she campaigned successfully for legislation granting women the vote in school elections. From 1912 to 1915 and again from 1919 to her death, Breckinridge was president of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association, which worked to secure legislation recognizing the rights of married women to enjoy their own earnings, to make wills, and to be equal guardians of their children, as well as legislation limiting working hours for women and providing for women physicians in state mental hospitals, among other reforms. In 1913-15 she was a vice president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, on whose behalf she traveled and spoke widely, demonstrating a remarkable gift for oratory. The ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment by the Kentucky legislature in January 1920 was largely credited to her efforts. In 1920 she undertook an extensive campaign tour on behalf of the League of Nations and the Democratic Party.\n\nFrom the Women in Kentucky - Reform web site:�Madeline McDowell Breckinridge was Kentucky's foremost Progressive reformer. A founder of the Lexington Civic League and the Associated Charities, the person primarily responsible for the establishment of the Blue Grass Sanatorium and the Lincoln Model School, and the principal leader of the woman suffrage movement during the final years before ratification of the federal woman suffrage amendment, Madge Breckinridge was at the time of her death the most famous and influential woman in Kentucky.\" ---Melba Porter Hay, Ph.D.\n\nMadeline Breckinridge grew up at the family home, Ashland, built by her famous great- grandfather Henry Clay. In 1898, she married Desha Breckinridge, the editor of the Lexington Herald and brother of Sophonisba Breckinridge. Madeline Breckinridge's list of achievements is a long one. She was chair of the Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs from 1908-1912. During this time she successfully pushed for the passage of legislation allowing women to vote in school board elections. She was president of the Kentucky Equal Rights Association for two separate terms and vice-president of the National Women's Suffrage Association. The importance of her efforts in the fight for women's suffrage cannot be overstated by those in Kentucky and the rest of the nation. She died in November of 1920, shortly after the ratification of the 19th Amendment, and after she cast her first and only vote. She had lived to see a great dream realized.\n\n82 vii.

Great-granddaughter of Henry Clay, she was raised in her grandmothers' Victorian homes and on her father's horse farm. She attended Miss Ella Williams's School, then briefly Sayre School, Transylvania University, and the University of Kentucky. Her early poems and stories appeared in Town and Country Magazine and the New York Times and in local publications, and in 1923 the book Poems by Susan Clay was published in Chicago. On May 5, 1927, fleeing family interference, she eloped with Russian-born New York art dealer William Sawitzky. Only one poem was published after her marriage, appearing in Poetry: A Magazine of Verse in 1941. From 1927 to 1947 she helped Sawitzky conduct pioneering research on early American art, research she continued after his death in 1947. Sponsored by the New York Historical Society, she published articles on Reuben Moultrop, Ralph Earl, and Abraham DeLanoy. Susan Sawitzky wrote poetry for over sixty years and a short collection was published posthumously by the Kentucky Poetry Review in 1984. Her collected poetry speaks poignantly of her struggle against family and community for the right of self-expression and of the tenacity of traditional Southern values well into the twentieth century. Sawitzky died on July 11, 1981. Her ashes were scattered near a millpond at Stamford, Connecticut.

His biography from Encyclopedia of the History of Missouri, Vol. 1, Howard L. Conard, Editor, 1901, follows: Anderson, Matthew William, banker, was born December 20, 1836, on the farm of his father, four miles from Independence, Missouri. His parents were George W. and Sally (Stewart) Anderson, both of whom were natives of Kentucky and members of splendid Southern families, whose records for thrift and integrity are spotless. They were married in Kentucky and removed to Missouri in 1836, the year M. W. Anderson was born. They located on the acres that composed the old homestead for so many years, near Independence, and played no small part in the wonderful transformation which caused Western Missouri to blossom from a pioneer wilderness into luxurious cultivation during their years. The son was left upon his own resources early in life, on account of the death of his father, but proved equal to the stern task before him. He received a common school education in the schools of Jackson County, and had a good, practical preparation for the numerous undertakings which were to combine in making his life successful. In 1860 he was elected constable of Blue Township, in Jackson County, defeating six opponents in a race that was hotly contested. In those days the office of constable was equally renumerative with the office of sheriff. It was ably filled by the young man until the edict went forth that officeholders must take the \"Gamble oath.\" That order having been promulgated and Mr. Anderson being unwilling to swear against convictions which came from Southern blood, he gave up the office. In 1862 he went to New Mexico and engaged in the business of overland freighting, in the employ of Irvin, Jackman & Co. He followed that line of work for about six months. After returning to Missouri he became deputy sheriff of Jackson County, in 1868, under Charles Dougherty, and served in that capacity until 1870. Between the time of his return from New Mexico and his acceptance of the office of deputy sheriff he engaged in farming in Jackson County. The Democratic party nominated him for collector of Jackson County, but his first race was followed by defeat, James L. Gray being elected. His second candidacy was successful, however, and in 1872 he was elected collector by a large majority. The oath of office was taken in 1873 and he served as collector four years. During this time, having prospered in financial affairs, he was a silent partner in the banking house of Brown, Hughes & Co., paid considerable attention to the raising of fine stock and looked after a large ranch which he had purchased in New Mexico. When the Anderson-Chiles Banking Company of Independence was organized he was made president of the concern, and for several years it was one of the strongest private banking houses in western Missouri. In 1889 this bank was nationalized and Mr. Anderson was chosen president. Since that time he has been president of this strong establishment, which is known as the First National Bank, and his reputation as a careful, successful business man is firmly established. Mr. Anderson has large property holdings which require much attention, and not all of his time is devoted to the banking business. He is one of the most prominent dealers in fine cattle in Missouri, and his splendid herd of Bates shorthorns which graze on the pastures of his four hundred acre farm near Independence is considered the standard of its kind. In addition to the office of county collector Mr. Anderson received other honors from the people of his community, serving for eighteen years as a member of the city council of Independence. He is a member of the Episcopal Church and holds the office of senior warden in Trinity Church, Independence. He was married, in 1861 to Miss Julia Daniel, of Jackson County, Missouri. To them two children, daughters, were born. Mrs. Anderson died in 1888. The husband was the second time married in 1892, his bride being Miss Mary W. Ervin, daughter of Colonel Eugene Ervin, of Lexington, Kentucky. Colonel Ervin was a grandson of the distinguished Kentucky statesman, Henry Clay, and of such noble ancestry Mrs. Anderson and her two bright sons, Henry Clay and Matthew William, have reason to be proud.\n\nAnother genealogically rich biography from The United States Biographical Dictionar"
