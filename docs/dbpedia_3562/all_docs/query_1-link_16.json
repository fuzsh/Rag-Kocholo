        "text": "(1860 - 1925)\n\nWilliam Jennings BRYAN was born in this home on the 19th of March, 1860, in Salem, Marion County, Illinois. He was born to the Hon. Silas Lillard BRYAN and wife Mariah Elizabeth JENNINGS BRYAN.\n\nBilly, as he was called then, was born to one of the prominent citizens of Salem. His father had been born in Culpeper County, Virginia on the 4th of November, 1842, the son of John and Nancy (LILLARD) BRYAN. John was the son of William BRYAN, immigrant from Ireland of Scott-Irish and English descent. Nancy was from an old American family of British descent. Silas was a graduate of McKendree College in Lebanon (the oldest college in Illinois); had been elected Supt. of Marion County Schools in 1850; was admitted to the bar in 1851; elected Illinois State Senator as a democrat in 1852 and re-elected in 1856. The year following Willie's birth, his father became Judge of the 2nd Judicial Circuit, re-elected in 1867 and holding that position through 1873. His father was also a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1869. Willie's mother was born the 24th of May 1834 in Walnut Hill, Marion County, Illinois, daughter of Charles W. and Maria JENNINGS. Silas died in 1880 and Mariah in 1896. They are buried in East Lawn Cemetery in Salem, Illinois.\n\nBy the time Billy had reached the age of six, he had three ambitions: a Baptist minister; a pumpkin farmer; a lawyer. He would attain the last one. He would go to the court and sit on the step listening to his father conduct trials.\n\nBilly was taught by his mother until he reached the age of 10. He attended the Salem Academy that was located at 531 North College in Salem, Illinois. One of his favorite teachers was Mary Rand (PUTNAM) LEMEN, the wife of Rev. Benjamin F. LEMEN, who were friends of Abramham LINCOLN. Mary was the founder of the academy. She had also been one of the founders of McKendree College. The Salem Academy was destroyed by a tornado and never re-built. The Salem Armory and National Guard is now located there.\n\nAs Billy's father prospered and his family grew, he built a new home on the northwest edge of Salem. (See photo following) This was the house Billy grew up in. Unfortunately, the house burned down. There is a beautiful new home in the same location today, at the end of Bryan Lane, off of North Franklin. The circle drive in front of the house is made of brick from the original Bryan Home.\n\nIn 1875, at the age of 15, Bryan entered Whipple Academy in Jacksonville, Illinois. The academy was a prepatory department of Illinois College in Jacksonville.\n\nIn 1881, Bryan delivered the validictory speech at his graduation from Illinois College.\n\nIn 1883, Bryan graduated from Union College of Law in Chicago, after which he returned to Jacksonville to set up a law practice.\n\nIt was in Jacksonville where Bryan met his wife-to-be, Mary Elizabeth BAIRD. His main reason for returning to Jacksonville. They were married the 1st of October 1884.\n\nIn 1887, Bryan, his wife Mary, and their daughter, Ruth Baird BRYAN, who had been born on the 2nd of October, 1885, moved to Lincoln, Nebraska. The place they would call home for the rest of their lives. Bryan practiced law in Lincoln.\n\nIn 1890, Bryan was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He lost however, his bid for the United States Senate in 1894. In the autumn of 1894, Bryan became the Editor-In-Chief of the Omaha World Herald.\n\nIn 1896, during the Democratic Convention in Chicago, Bryan delivered his famous \"Cross of Gold\" speech. The day following the speech, Bryan became the youngest man ever nominated for president of the United States of America. Bryan was 36 years of age. Bryan was defeated in the general election by Republican William McKINLEY.\n\nThe above photo is that of William Jennings BRYAN's 1896 Presidential Campaign Photo taken with his relatives in Salem. It was taken in front of his cousin's, Molly WEBSTER's home on North Franklin.

Seated, Left to right: James BAIRD, P. PATTERSON, Andrew \"Andy\" BRYAN, Georgia BRYAN, Lesta BRYAN, Ruby LANGENFELD, Andrew Russell BRYAN aka Uncle Russ, unknown, William E. BRYAN, Laura (MILLSON) MARTIN, unknown, Lee WEBSTER, and Edward \"Ed\" BRYAN.\n\nAnd again in 1900, Bryan was the Democratic choice for president and again he was defeated by President William McKINLEY. In 1908, Bryan was chosen once again by the Democratic party as their candidate for president. He was defeated by Republican, William Howard TAFT\n\nIn 1898, Bryan became a Colonel of the Third Nebraska Volunteer Infantry during the Spanish American War, after volunteering his services to President William McKINLEY. After the war ended, Bryan resigned his commission.\n\nIn 1901, established his own newspaper, The Commoner, from which he furthered his political views.\n\nIn 1912, after Bryan had worked to get Woodrow WILSON as President of the United States, President WILSON appointed Bryan Secretary of State. Bryan negotiated treaties with 30 countries. Bryan resigned as Secretary of State in June 1915 in protest to President WILSON's actions concerning the German sinking of the Lusitania.\n\nIn 1925, Bryan became the prosecuting attorney at the \"Scopes Monkey Trial\" in Dayton, Tennessee. John Thomas SCOPES was hired to teach evolution in the school at Dayton, knowing that there would bring national attention to Dayton. It just so happened that Bryan was the keynote speaker at Scopes' high school graduation in Salem, Illinois in 1919. Bryan told Scopes that he would pay the fine if he were found guilty. The behind the scenes were not much like what the media made it out to be. Bryan's son, William Jennings BRYAN, Jr. and Scopes would go out and swim every day after the trial. Clarence DARROW was the defence attorney. He tried his best to make Bryan look foolish, with no luck, unlike what the movie about the trial showed. Bryan was a good attorney and also was quite funny. The people attending the trial loved him. Scopes was found guilty and was fined $100.00.\n\nOn Sunday the 26th of July, 1925, only five days following the trial, William Jennings BRYAN died during an afternoon nap at the age of 65. He was still in Dayton, Tennessee.\n\nThe Bryan Family\n\nWilliam BRYAN, from Ireland\n\nJohn and Nancy (LILLARD) BRYAN\n\nSilas Lillard and Maria Elizabeth (JENNINGS) BRYAN\n\nWilliam Jennings and Mary Elizabeth (BAIRD) BRYAN\n\nChildren of William Jennings BRYAN:\n\n1.
