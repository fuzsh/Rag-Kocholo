        "text": "Carter & Cato families from Hertfordshire/Buckinghamshire (related to the Dellor family)\n\nCarter Family Tree, Cato Family Tree\n\nCensus return transcriptions are with those of the Dellor family\n\nThere had always been an understanding by my great aunt Ivy Howard (and her brother, Alfred Howard, my grandad) that their grandmother was a Spanish-looking woman called Caroline Cato She even described her as a white-haired old lady who she used to visit with her mother Rose when she was a child. She told us that she had died around 1925 in the Clapton area. This, of course, led us to believe that Caroline Cato must be the name of Rose’s mother, wife of John Thomas Dellor.\n\nHaving already established that this grandmother did not come from the Howard side, we then found from Rose Dellor‘s birth certificate, that her mother was Ann Marie Carter, and in fact it was her that had died in 1925 in the Clapton area. Further investigations proved that John Thomas had never remarried and that his own mother was Maria Lingwood (wife of Jonathan Dellor).\n\nThe existence of the Spanish grandmother remained a mystery for a good few years. Caroline Cato must have existed, but who was she?\n\nThe clue came by accident, whilst looking at the freeBMD website for possible parents of Ann Marie Carter. We knew from her marriage certificate that her father was William Carter and by looking at any matches for marriages prior to 1844, I up came a match between William Carter and Caroline Cato! Therefore, the mystery lady turned out to be the mother of Ann Marie, and hence, Rose’s grandmother and Ivy’s great grandmother. A few years later when Roger Dellor showed me the photo he had of Ann Marie, it is clear that she does look Spanish and there the confusion was explained.\n\nBefore long, the family tree of the Carter family from Wheathampstead had been established, [thanks also to Arthur Holdford of Columbus, Ohio USA and his Carter webpage] 1 together with the family of Caroline Cato from Kimpton. I have continued the research into this family a little further back thanks to the growing number of online parish records. Some extra snippets of information have also recently been gleaned from the Carter links of Sandra Croft‘s Tribalpages 10. (Thank you Sandra!)\n\nAlso Thanks also Susan Cato, I now have further information on the Cato family tree, going back into Ivinghoe in Buckinghamshire, and now five generations back from Caroline and still not Spanish!\n\nSee the Carter family tree, and the Cato family tree\n\nAnn Marie Carter‘s family go back about 6 generations, all in Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire. There was a mill at Wheathampstead and one of the early tenants was a William Carter who leased the mill for £4 per year back in 1516! 9. There is also a Will of a William Carter of Wheathampstead in 1587 (which may be worth investigating). However, we have no idea as yet if either of these Williams are related to our Carters.\n\nThe furthest back we can go at this moment is with William Carter born about 1680. He married an Elizabeth and they had five children all baptised at Wheathampstead 2 :\n\nSarah Carter bp 5.4.1702 Wheathampstead Henry Carter b 3.12.1704, bp 4.12.1704 Wheathampstead\n\nWilliam Carter b 7.9.1708, bp 3.10.1708 Wheathampstead m abt 1738 to Mary d 1782 Gustard Wood, bur 20.1.1782 Wheathampstead10 Joseph Carter b and bp 23.7.1712 Wheathampstead Mary Carter bp 4.12.1715 Wheathampstead\n\nWilliam was a Husbandman and died in 1744 and was buried on 15th August 1744 at St. Helen’s Wheathampstead 10.\n\nWilliam Carter, the son of William and Elizabeth, was born on 7th September, 1708 at Wheathampstead. He married Mary (maiden name unknown, although there is a possibility: Mary Mayor of Hemel Hempstead married William Carter in Little Gaddesden on 30th September, 1736 12) in about 1738 and the had eight children all baptised at Wheathampstead 2:\n\nWilliam Carter b 11.12.1738, bp 24.12.1738 Wheathampstead m 6.9.1764 Wheathampstead to Rebecca Jeffrey bur 16.5.1817 Wheathampstead John Carter bp 28.9.1740 Wheathampstead Joseph Carter b 23.9.1742, bp 10.10.1742 Wheathampstead Mary Carter b 14.6.1745, bp 23.6.1745 Wheathampstead\n\nElizabeth Carter b 1.7.1748, bp 21.7.1748 Wheathampstead\n\nThomas b 6.1.1750, bp 8.1.1750 Wheathampstead\n\nThomas Carter b 15.3.1752, bp 6.4.1752 Wheathampstead Henry Carter b 4.9.1754, bp 14.9.1754 Wheathampstead\n\nWilliam was the publican of the Tin Pot Public House at Gustard Wood in 1756. The billeting record for that year states that the house was kept by William Carter with stabling for two horses. 10, 11\n\nHe died there in 1782 and was buried at Wheathampstead on 20th January.\n\nWilliam Carter, the son of William Carter and Mary (as yet unknown) was born on 11th December, 1738 at Wheathampstead.

I cannot be certain that this relates to our William as he was in the Wheathampstead parish in 1841. William and Mary were living at Gustard Wood at the time of the 1841 census 3 . Mary died there on 4th March, 1848 and was buried at Wheathampstead on 8th March. William, now widowed at the time of the 1851 census, was a journeyman Carpenter and lived next door to his son William. By the time of his death on 29th November, 1857 he had moved to the Union workhouse a St Albans 3. He was buried on 2nd December, 1857 at Wheathampstead.\n\nWilliam Carter was the son of William Carter, Carpenter and Mary Olds, born on 6th Dec 1807 and baptised on 3rd January, 1808 at Wheathampstead. He was an Agricultural labourer and married Caroline Cato, daughter of William Cato and Ann Burgoyne, on 17th April, 1841 at Wheathampstead. William and Caroline had four children 1:\n\nAmelia Carter b 26.8.1841, bp 27.2.1842 Wheathampstead m 23.8.1869 to Michael Barton\n\nAnn Marie Carter bp 29.12.1844 Wheathampstead m 9.9.1866 Islington to John Thomas Dellor d 2.7.1925 Hackney\n\nSelina Carter bp 7.3.1848 Wheathampstead\n\nMoses Carter bp 23.9.1849 Wheathampstead m1 2.1.1875 Kimpton to Mary Hillard m2 1890 Luton to Elydia Peacock d 22.3.1928\n\nAt the time of the 1851 Census, William and Caroline were living next door to William Senior at Gustard Wood with their children Amelia, Ann and Moses 3.\n\nTheir eldest daughter Amelia married Michael Barton, (a plumber, born abt 1844 in Cambridge) on 23rd August 1869. According to the 1871 census they already has a son William born abt 1867 3. They had the following children 2:\n\nWilliam Barton b abt 1867/8 Wheathampstead Ellen Barton bp 27.2.1870 Wheathampstead\n\nAnnie Elizabeth Barton bp 25.6.1871 Wheathampstead, d 1872 Amelia Barton bp 29.9.1872 Wheathampstead, d 1873 Alma Jane Barton bp 30.11.1873 Wheathampstead\n\nJames Barton b 1875 Wheathampstead\n\nAlice Ameila Barton bp 31.12.1876 Wheathampstead\n\nAmelia died in 1878 and Michael, a plumber is living with just his son William at the time of the 1881 census 3. The other four surviving children; Ellen, Alma, James and Alice were living with their grandmother, Caroline in Gustard Wood 3.\n\nTheir second daughter Ann Marie Carter born on 29th December, 1833 married John Thomas Dellor, son of Jonathan Dellor and Maria Lingwood on 9th September 1866 at Islington. She died in 1872 at Gustard Wood. See the Dellor family for more information.\n\nCaroline Carter (nee Cato) and her husband William were living at Wheathampstead in 1871 with their son Moses and granddaughter Ellen Barton. William died at Gustard Wood on 18th February, 1872 and in 1881 Caroline was living at Gustard Wood, Wheathampstead with her four grandchildren; Ellen, Alma, James and Alice Barton, as mentioned above. At the time of the 1891 she was living at the same address on her own. Her eldest three grandchildren are nowhere to be found but Alice was back with her father Michael, and his new wife Hannah and their children. Caroline died on 4th April 1891 at Gustard Wood.\n\nCaroline’s family can now be traced back anther six generations to William Cato/Catoe who lived in Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire. He was born in about 1620 and married Prudence Moores (1618 – 1679), daughter of John Moores in about 1641 4, 5.

[Information kindly given to me by their ancestor Richard Cato of new Zealand]. 14\n\nEdward Cato born in June 1707 was a collar maker and settled in Totternhoe, Bedfordshire. He married Elizabeth Jennings, on 17th February, 1734 by licence at Maulden, Bedfordshire 2. Edward and Elizabeth had eight children all baptised at Totternhoe St. Giles 2:\n\nWilliam Cato bp 21.12.1735 Totternhoe bur 3.11.1741 Totternhoe Edward Cato b abt 1736 bur 24.5.1749 Totternhoe Ann Cato b abt 1837 bur 27.5.1747 Totternhoe William Cato b? mentioned in will Thomas Cato bp 31.5.1747 Totternhoe bur 4.6.1747 Totternhoe\n\nThomas Cato b 2.1.1748 Studham, bp 9.6.1751 Totternhoe\n\nm 9.6.1775 Flamstead, Herts to Henrietta Maria Cross\n\nbur 9.10.1825 Harpenden Elizabeth Cato b abt 1749 m 13.11.1769 Totternhoe to William Coles Ann Cato b 20.9.1751, bp 29.9.1751 Totternhoe bur 23.5.1755 Totternhoe\n\nIn the will (dated 13th October, 1747) of William Jennings of Wall End, Maulden, who died on 2nd September, 1750, Elizabeth his niece now Elizabeth Cato is mentioned in discharge legacies as previously Elizabeth Cateaway, wife of Edward Cateaway, collar maker of Totternhoe? 13.\n\nElizabeth died in 1770 and was buried on 23rd May at Totternhoe St Giles.

He left a will dated 17th May, 1773 which was proved on 8th October, 1783 7. The will “of Edward Cato of Totternhoe in the county of Bedford, collar maker” mentions his second wife Mary, William, his eldest [surviving] son who he makes his sole executor, his son Thomas and his daughter Elizabeth Coles.\n\nThomas Cato was born on 2nd January, 1748 at Studham to Edward Cato and Elizabeth Jennings. He was a Collar Maker and married Henrietta Maria Cross on 9th June 1775 at Flamstead, Hertfordshire.
