        "text": "Avant-pop French duo Sages Comme Des Sauvages (Ava Carrère and Ismaël Colombani) come crashing back with a brand new release in the form of new single “Répare ou Pas” (translated as “Repair It or Not”) through Capitane Records and Rising Bird Music.\n\nDrawing on a myriad of influences from folk, world music, post punk, French chanson and electronics, “Répare ou Pas” is the first single from the upcoming album due later this year.\n\nThe track comes with a breakneck demolition derby-inspired music video which you can check out here:\n\nSpeaking about the single, the group say:\n\n“This is an anthem in the form of a question. Do we repair it or not? Faced with a world full of manufacturing vices and defects, we wonder if it is still worth mending everything. Isn’t our society similar to an old printer with planned obsolescence that refuses to print in colour? Have the gears just seized up or has the machine been sabotaged? What do we save in a world where everything is for sale or to be discarded? Do we fight or do we tinker? Somewhere between systematics and DIY approach, we dare to question.”\n\nThe accompanying music video, directed by Nicolas Adalbert, is a cinematic marvel full of stunts and adventures in technicolour of which the band had this to say:\n\n“There, these fans revive cars that no one wants anymore to give them one last lap, one final roll before their definitive journey to the scrapyard. And the dust raised by these battered sheets and by those who give them a last rescue becomes like a magical and haunting ritual, animated by the beauty of this question: Do we repair it or not?”"
