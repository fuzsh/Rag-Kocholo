        "text": "Photography has always been an integral part of design. Unfortunately, we’ve grown accustomed to seeing cheesy stock images of people in suits shaking hands. Not only are a lot of these stock photos tacky, but they cost a lot of money.\n\nThankfully, there’s been a growing number of websites with beautiful stock photography popping up all over the web. Best of all, they’re free!\n\nIn this post, we’ve curated a list of awesome websites for free stock photos.\n\nQuick Note About Licenses\n\nMany of these photographs are free from copyright restrictions or licensed under creative commons public domain dedication. This means you can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.\n\nHowever, some photos may require attribution.
