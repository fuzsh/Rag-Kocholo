        "text": "Dutch producer Bastian Benjamin is back with new track “Faux Pas” as well as the tantalising prospect of an album.\n\nInspired by Clark, Forest Swords, Lorn, and Massive Attack, his productions range from tightly wound club music to sprawling, atmospheric electronica. On “Faux Pas”, he leans more towards the former with squelchy acid synths driven forward by shuffling, snappy percussion.\n\nThis is the second track to be taken from the upcoming album, following “Mycelium” at the top of the month. The album is due for release on May 24 via Dutch label Who’s Susan and given his last EP on the label, and the two energetic tracks we’ve had from the album, there could well be more dancefloor moments on the LP.\n\nWhile we wait, hit play on “Faux Pas” up top."
