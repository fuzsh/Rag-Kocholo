        "text": "Tu ne le dit pas (You Don‚Äôt Say It) is a # 4 song from Myl√®ne Farmer‚Äôs ninth studio album, Monkey Me released on 3 December 2012.\n\nThe lyrics for Tu ne le dis pas was written by Myl√®ne Farmer. Music, arrangements, programming, keyboards and production: Laurent Boutonnat.\n\nI love this upbeat dancing song ‚Äì it has very happy tune all together. Here is an anecdote for you: When I have heard it the first time, I did something around the house and with all the noise around it sound it like ‚ÄúTu ne lo-li-ta‚Äù üòä üòä Imagine, my surprise!!! I thought that‚Äôs odd, why would Mylene re-sing it ‚ÄúMoi, Lolita‚Äù ? üòä\n\nBut seriously, the text of course is giving us a bone to chew on‚Ä¶I have no idea what ‚Äútu‚Äù didn‚Äôt say and why‚Ä¶I can only keep guessing and you know assuming is only making and an ‚Äúass‚Äù out of me and you and let it be so ‚Äì how very Pourvu qu‚Äôelles soient douces of me!\n\nI would interpret the text in a few possible ways:\n\nThe situation when you are with someone who would rather avoid talking about any serious and controversial matters and rather to keep it ‚Äúlight‚Äù and non-confrontational. Someone who ignores things hoping it will help to fix them‚Ä¶I never was that person‚Ä¶so I understand the frustration\n\n‚ÄúTu‚Äù as a humanity in a broad sense not addressing serious global issues and rather keeping it quiet and not to raising a voice about the world problems. Similar to the ‚ÄúC‚Äôest dans l‚Äôair‚Äù, it makes Mylene angry.\n\n3. or maybe she is talking about herself and her paralyzed abilities to really SPEAK UP. We know how much she really don‚Äôt say even in her lyrics‚Ä¶.The words seem to be only the tip of of her unspoken limitless universe.\n\nMonkey Me was recorded in France in 2012, at studio Guillaume Tell and at Calliphora Studio, Laurent Boutonnat‚Äôs personal studio located in his Ch√¢teau de l‚ÄôOise.\n\nThe mixing was carried out at Calliphora Studio by J√©r√¥me Devoise who also provided the sound as for all of Myl√®ne‚Äôs studio albums since Avant que l‚Äôombre‚Ä¶ in 2005.\n\nThe arrangements and programming are by Laurent Boutonnat.\n\nAll the music on the album was composed by Laurent Boutonnat. The comeback, since it was completely absent from Myl√®ne‚Äôs previous studio album, Bleu Noir in 2010.\n\nWe find musicians who have already collaborated with Myl√®ne in the past: Lo√Øc Pontieux drummer in 2005 on the album Avant que l‚Äôombre. .., the guitarist S√©bastien Chouard already present on the album Point de Suture in 2008 and the faithful Slim Pezin also on the guitar (who had not worked directly on Myl√®ne songs since 2001).\n\nNewcomer: St√©phane Chausse on saxophone.\n\nWe have to go back to Cendres de lune in 1986, Myl√®ne‚Äôs first album, to find the saxophone among the instruments used on a studio album.\n\nIt is thanks to Lo√Øc Pontieux that we learned the release of a new album by Myl√®ne for 2012. The musician indeed posted on September 04, 2012 on his Facebook page the message: ‚ÄúRecorded in August Mylene Farmer‚Äôs latest album‚Äù. The information did not escape the fans and although Lo√Øc Pontieux very quickly deleted it, it quickly spread on the net. Was it really done by accident‚Ä¶hmm‚Ä¶\n\nFor the choirs of certain songs, Myl√®ne called on Esther Dobong Na‚ÄôEssienne, chorister, in particular on all her tours since the 1996 Tour.\n\nAll the lyrics of the album are again written by Myl√®ne with the exception of Winter Night which takes up some lyrics from the song Chlo√© written in 1985 by Laurent Boutonnat.\n\nThe influences seem less numerous than in the previous albums.\n\nReference to the wise monkeys and above all, the title of the album was inspired in Myl√®ne by her little capuchin monkey E.T., and who shared her life for twenty-five years:\n\nI first necessarily thought of my little one with whom I lived for over twenty five years, I believe. And, I was thinking about this facetious side, this playful side. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm in too ski mpy clothes and ‚Ä¶ I want to laugh sometimes, too.‚Äù (Myl√®ne Farmer ‚Äì News from 20h TF1 December 02, 2012)\n\nThe photo of the album cover is signed Herv√© Lewis.\n\nThe album booklet does not contain any photo of Myl√®ne (photos of various objects by Nathalie Del√©pine).\n\nPhotos for the promotion of Nathalie Del√©pine‚Äôs album (studio photos and photos with the monkey Betty)\n\nThree photos of Natahalie Del√©pine offered in DR to the press. Nathalie Del√©pine was also the still photographer for the clips In the shade and I tell you everything. Bettina Rheims photographed Myl√®ne for the first time in 2013. The photos will be featured in the 2013 Timeless tour program.\n\nTF1 is the privileged partner for the promotion of the Monkey Me album, in particular when it is released.\n\nThe clip In the shade is broadcast exclusively on TF1 (long extract) and on the site of the channel myTF1 (in full) on December 01st.\n\nBroadcast of advertising spots on TF1 from December 3 to 26, 2012 (note that there will then be no other TV advertising campaign for the album).\n\nMyl√®ne is a guest of Claire Chazal‚Äôs 8pm newspaper on December 02.\n\nMyl√®ne guest of the 2013 NRJ Music Awardson January 26th to sing exclusively the second single from the album, Je te dis tout.\n\nAn interview in T√™tu\n\nWhy did you pose as a boy? MYLENE:I find it rather sexy ... I love the tuxedo. A timeless and refined garment. The cigar, the tuxedo, the pose, we irresistibly think of Marlene Dietrich ... Or Julie Andrews in Victor Victoria. Courageous women who did not hesitate to stir up trouble at a time when women were confined to the home. Most disturbing, ultimately, is the erotic impact these women have on men. Subversion stirs the senses... Would you have liked to live in those 1930s when sexual ambiguity was assumed, accepted and almost elevated to the rank of art of living? Probably not. This ambiguity was reserved for an artistic elite. Women had no other rights than that of living in the shadows, without being able to express their voice and what is more, constrained by a morality guided by a macho and backward society. In such a narrow space, only the power of seduction remained a sure bet. It is important but not enough to flourish. Could you or have you ever fallen in love with a woman? Of a beautiful person, man or woman, yes without hesitation. Love at first sight, passion exists. He who thinks he has mastered the impulse of the heart would be very imprudent. What is masculine in you? Nothing. I feel deeply as a woman with the qualities and the faults of a woman. What is fundamentally different between a man and a woman? Intuition, no doubt... Besides, aren't we talking about feminine intuition? Men and women are different, and this difference is an asset. Anything that tends to smooth out this difference is unnatural. Uniformity is the antechamber of boredom. Each person should be respected for their personality and not for chromosomal difference. Would you have liked to be a man? [Smiles.] No, I don't think so ... Or maybe out of curiosity, for a moment. To understand what sometimes remains a mystery. Do you think there is one music for men and another for women? Certainly not. A melody can pick up all of us. And reveal in us unexpected emotions. The music touches on feelings that go far beyond the question of sex. Jean-Paul Gaultier and, before him Yves Saint Laurent, erased the sartorial differences between men and women. Do you think they have done more for gender equality than a lot of noisy protest movements? They gave a figure to a time that was ready to accept it. It is a tribute of two men to the women of their lives ... [Smile.] Yves Saint Laurent and Jean-Paul Gaultier understood women with elegance. Greta Garbo or Lauren Bacall were women of crazy elegance. They had a style, much more than a fashion that comes and goes. The style endures. Genius couturiers have changed the lines. Do you behave exactly the same with your female friends and your male friends? Yes of course. And I effortlessly switch from one sartorial mood to another. From stiletto heels to Chaplin boots. I was a tomboy. But I like chic underwear. Hey ... I've never tried chic underwear with boots ... The question of marriage for all inflames French society. Are you in favor of it? I have already spoken about this. It seems to me that it was in T√™tu, by the way. I don't think this question should be looked at from a moral point of view. The Declaration of the Rights of Man begins with: \"Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.\" Many people have paid the price of their lives for this principle to be applied. My point of view is unambiguous: I prefer a gay marriage to a sad one. [Smiles.] What about adoption by same-sex couples? If it is the right of orphans to have a warm home, it is progress. Love heals wounds when it is real and genuine. How do you explain that you are so popular with gay people? I am not sure I can measure this community popularity. And it goes beyond any sexual orientation. Every artist has an identity link with his audience. The reasons are many, complex and mysterious. She told me - the first song on your new album - evokes a loving relationship between two women. Did you hesitate to write it or was it as natural as another text? When I wrote this song, we were not at the heart of the debate that animates our society. It came to me spontaneously like everything I write. The last verse says, \"She loves a girl, she feels on the edge of the ledge.\" From the edge of what? A rebound or a great leap into the void? A great leap into the void. When your heart is in your throat, you have the feeling that you are no longer compatible with life. This is what being at the edge of the ledge, at the end of the road ... Do you think that female homosexuality is less well accepted than that of men? I fear that‚Äôs true. It seems there is an inequality between men and women. Do you sometimes choose music or write texts specifically for this audience? No. When I write, I express ideas mixed with words and sounds. I throw bottles into the sea without knowing where they will end up. Sometimes they don't get lost in the ocean! Your record and your tour posters show you in platinum white. Is this the goal? I'm curious to see yourself differently! But don't worry: at the end of this astral journey, I will return to my body!\n\nüß°üíöüß°üíõüíôüíú\n\nThe album entered directly at the first place of the Top Albums and sold 147,530 copies in one week in France. It‚Äôs the best start of 2012 for an album. In just one month it will become the 9th best-selling album in 2012. It is certified triple platinum by Snep (300,000 copies) on December 31 and Polydor announces the diamond disc (500,000 copies) from January 3. 2013.\n\nAfter one year of operation, Monkey Me has sold more than 380,000 copies in France.\n\nSuccess also in French-speaking Belgium with a platinum disc (30,000 copies).\n\nIn 2015, the album was part of Snep‚Äôs export certifications with a Gold album for 50,100 sales since its release.\n\nremixes\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/search?q=Tu%20ne%20le%20dis%20pas%20mylene%20farmer%20remix\n\nRECEIVE ALL THE NEWS FROM MYLENEFARMER.COM VIA EMAIL\n\nlyrics with translation"
