        "text": "The whispers in the morning\n\nOf lovers sleeping tight\n\nAre rolling like thunder now\n\nAs I look in your eyes\n\nI hold on to your body\n\nAnd feel each move you make\n\nYour voice is warm and tender\n\nA love that I could not forsake\n\n(first chorus)\n\n‘Cause I am your lady\n\nAnd you are my man\n\nWhenever you reach for me\n\nI’ll do all that I can\n\nLost is how I’m feeling lying in your arms\n\nWhen the world outside’s too\n\nMuch to take\n\nThat all ends when I’m with you\n\nEven though there may be times\n\nIt seems I’m far away\n\nNever wonder where I am\n\n‘Cause I am always by your side\n\n(repeat first chorus)\n\n(second chorus)\n\nWe’re heading for something\n\nSomewhere I’ve never been\n\nSometimes I am frightened\n\nBut I’m ready to learn\n\nOf the power of love\n\nThe sound of your heart beating\n\nMade it clear\n\nSuddenly the feeling that I can’t go on\n\nIs light years away\n\n(repeat first chorus)\n\n(repeat second chorus)\n\n(Gunther Mende / Candy DeRouge / Jennifer Rush / Mary Susan Applegate)\n\nI was waiting for so long\n\nFor a miracle to come\n\nEveryone told me to be strong\n\nHold on and don't shed a tear\n\nSo through darkness and good times\n\nI knew I'd make it through\n\nAnd the world thought I had it all\n\nBut I was waiting for you\n\nHush now\n\nI see a light in the sky\n\nOh it's almost blinding me\n\nI can't believe I've been touched by an angel\n\nWith love\n\nLet the rain come down\n\nAnd wash away my tears\n\nLet it fill my soul\n\nAnd drown my fears\n\nLet it shatter the walls\n\nFor a new sun\n\nA new day has come\n\nA new day has come\n\nWhere it was dark now there is light\n\nWhere there was pain, now there's joy\n\nWhere there was weakness, I found my strength\n\nAll in the eyes of a boy\n\nHush now\n\nI see a light in the sky\n\nOh it's almost blinding me\n\nI can't believe I've been touched by an angel\n\nWith love\n\nLet the rain come down\n\nAnd wash away my tears\n\nLet it fill my soul\n\nAnd drown my fears\n\nLet it shatter the walls\n\nFor a new sun\n\nA new day has come\n\nA new day has come\n\nInstrumental\n\nChorus\n\n(Aldo Nova / Stephan Moccio)\n\nFor all those times you stood by me\n\nFor all the truth that you made me see\n\nFor all the joy you brought to my life\n\nFor all the wrong that you made right\n\nFor every dream you made come true\n\nFor all the love I found in you\n\nI'll be forever thankful baby\n\nYou're the one who held me up\n\nNever let me fall\n\nYou're the one who saw me through through it all\n\nYou were my strength when I was weak\n\nYou were my voice when I couldn't speak\n\nYou were my eyes when I couldn't see\n\nYou saw the best there was in me\n\nLifted me up when I couldn't reach\n\nYou gave me faith ‘coz you believed\n\nI'm everything I am\n\nBecause you loved me\n\nYou gave me wings and made me fly\n\nYou touched my hand I could touch the sky\n\nI lost my faith, you gave it back to me\n\nYou said no star was out of reach\n\nYou stood by me and I stood tall\n\nI had your love I had it all\n\nI'm grateful for each day you gave me\n\nMaybe I don't know that much\n\nBut I know this much is true\n\nI was blessed because I was loved by you\n\nYou were my strength when I was weak\n\nYou were my voice when I couldn't speak\n\nYou were my eyes when I couldn't see\n\nYou saw the best there was in me\n\nLifted me up when I couldn't reach\n\nYou gave me faith ‘coz you believed\n\nI'm everything I am\n\nBecause you loved me\n\nYou were always there for me\n\nThe tender wind that carried me\n\nA light in the dark shining your love into my life\n\nYou've been my inspiration\n\nThrough the lies you were the truth\n\nMy world is a better place because of you\n\nYou were my strength when I was weak\n\nYou were my voice when I couldn't speak\n\nYou were my eyes when I couldn't see\n\nYou saw the best there was in me\n\nLifted me up when I couldn't reach\n\nYou gave me faith ‘coz you believed\n\nI'm everything I am\n\nBecause you loved me\n\n(Diane Warren)\n\nWhen I was a little girl\n\nI had a rag doll\n\nOnly doll I’ve ever owned\n\nNow I love you just the way I loved that rag doll\n\nBut only now my love has grown\n\nAnd it gets stronger, in every way\n\nAnd it gets deeper, let me say\n\nAnd it gets higher, day by day\n\nAnd do I love you my oh my\n\nYeh river deep mountain high\n\nIf I lost you would I cry\n\nOh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby\n\nWhen you were a young boy\n\nDid you have a puppy\n\nThat always followed you around\n\nWell I’m gonna be as faithful as that puppy\n\nNo I’ll never let you down\n\nCause it grows stronger, like a river flows\n\nAnd it gets bigger baby, and heaven knows\n\nAnd it gets sweeter baby, as it grows\n\nAnd do I love you my oh my\n\nYeh river deep, mountain high\n\nIf I lost you would I cry\n\nOh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby\n\nI love you baby like a flower loves the spring\n\nAnd I love you baby just like Tina loves to sing\n\nAnd I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet\n\nAnd I love you baby, river deep mountain high\n\nOh yeah you’ve gotta believe me\n\nRiver Deep, Mountain High\n\nDo I love you my oh my, oh baby\n\nRiver deep, mountain high\n\nIf I lost you would I cry\n\nOh how I love you baby, baby, baby, baby\n\n(Ellie Greenwich / Jeff Barry / Phil Spector)\n\nEvery night in my dreams\n\nI see you, I feel you,\n\nThat is how I know you go on\n\nFar across the distance\n\nAnd spaces between us\n\nYou have come to show you go on\n\nNear, far, wherever you are\n\nI believe that the heart does go on\n\nOnce more you open the door\n\nAnd you’re here in my heart\n\nAnd my heart will go on and on\n\nLove can touch us one time\n\nAnd last for a lifetime\n\nAnd never let go till we’re one\n\nLove was when I loved you\n\nOne true time I hold to\n\nIn my life we’ll always go on\n\nNear, far, wherever you are\n\nI believe that the heart does go on\n\nOnce more you open the door\n\nAnd you’re here in my heart\n\nAnd my heart will go on and on\n\nThere is some love that will not go away\n\nYou’re here, there’s nothing I fear,\n\nAnd I know that my heart will go on\n\nWe’ll stay forever this way\n\nYou are safe in my heart\n\nAnd my heart will go on and on\n\n(James Horner / Will Jennings)\n\nWhen I was young\n\nI never needed anyone\n\nAnd making love was just for fun\n\nThose days are gone\n\nLivin’ alone\n\nI think of all the friends I’ve known\n\nWhen I dial the telephone\n\nNobody’s home\n\nAll by myself\n\nDon’t wanna be\n\nAll by myself\n\nAnymore\n\nHard to be sure\n\nSometimes I feel so insecure\n\nAnd loves so distant and obscure\n\nRemains the cure\n\nAll by myself\n\nDon’t wanna be\n\nAll by myself\n\nAnymore\n\nAll by myself\n\nDon’t wanna live\n\nAll by myself\n\nAnymore\n\nWhen I was young\n\nI never needed anyone\n\nMaking love was just for fun\n\nThose days are gone\n\nAll by myself\n\nDon’t wanna be\n\nAll by myself\n\nAnymore\n\nAll by myself\n\nDon’t wanna live\n\nOh\n\nDon’t wanna live\n\nBy myself, by myself\n\nAnymore\n\nBy myself\n\nAnymore\n\nOh\n\nAll by myself\n\nDon’t wanna live\n\nI never, never, never\n\nNeeded anyone\n\n(Eric Carmen / Sergei Rachmaninoff)\n\nWhat’s left to say?\n\nThese prayers ain’t working anymore\n\nEvery word shot down in flames\n\nWhat’s left to do with these broken pieces on the floor?\n\nI’m losing my voice calling on you\n\n‘Cause I’ve been shaking, I’ve been bending backwards ‘till I’m broke\n\nWatching all these dreams go up in smoke\n\nLet beauty come out of ashes\n\nLet beauty come out of ashes\n\nAnd when I pray to God all I ask is\n\nCan beauty come out of ashes?\n\nCan you use these tears to put out the fires in my soul?\n\n‘Cause I need you here, oh\n\n‘Cause I’ve been shaking, I’ve been bending backwards ‘till I’m broke\n\nWatching all these dreams go up in smoke\n\nLet beauty come out of ashes\n\nLet beauty come out of ashes\n\nAnd when I pray to God all I ask is\n\nCan beauty come out of ashes?\n\nCan beauty come out of ashes?\n\nRising tides, tears you cry every night seem never ending\n\nBut that’s just life, the last goodbye, high and dry it leaves you empty\n\nYou might think your world is ending but it won’t\n\nYou might think you need to give up, but you don’t\n\nCause you don’t have to move a mountain just keep moving\n\nEvery move is a new emotion\n\nAnd you don’t have to find the answers just keep trying\n\nThe sun will rise again, the storms subside again\n\nThis is not the end\n\nAnd you will love again\n\nSummer rain, day by day, sadness fades, the wound is healing\n\nAnd time goes by, eyes will dry, and you will find someone to heal with\n\nYou might think your world is ending but it won’t\n\nYou might think you need to give up, but you don’t\n\nCause you don’t have to move a mountain just keep moving\n\nEvery move is a new emotion\n\nAnd you don’t have to find the answers just keep trying\n\nThe sun will rise again, the storms subside again\n\nThis is not the end\n\nAnd you will love again\n\nYou will love again, again, love again\n\nYou will love again, again, love again\n\nCause you don’t have to move a mountain just keep moving\n\nEvery move is a new emotion\n\nAnd you don’t have to find the answers just keep trying\n\nThe sun will rise again, the storms subside again\n\nNo this is not the end\n\nAnd you will love, you will love, you will love\n\nAgain\n\nDan Wilson and Rosaileen Scher\n\nWhen you call on me\n\nWhen I hear you\n\nBreathe\n\nI get wings to fly\n\nI feel that I'm alive\n\nWhen you look at me\n\nI can touch the sky\n\nI know that I'm alive\n\nWhen you bless\n\nThe day\n\nI just drift away\n\nAll my worries die\n\nI'm glad that I'm\n\nAlive\n\nYou've set my heart\n\nOn fire\n\nFilled me with love\n\nMade me a woman on\n\nClouds above\n\nI couldn't get\n\nMuch higher\n\nMy spirit takes flight\n\n‘Cause I am alive\n\nWhen you call on me\n\nWhen I hear you\n\nBreathe\n\nI get wings to fly\n\nI feel that I'm alive\n\nWhen you reach\n\nFor me\n\nRaising spirits high\n\nGod knows that\n\nThat I'll be the one\n\nStanding by\n\nThrough good and\n\nThrough\n\nTrying times\n\nAnd it's only begun\n\nI can't wait for the\n\nRest of my life\n\nWhen you call on me\n\nWhen you reach\n\nFor me\n\nI get wings to fly\n\nI feel that\n\nWhen you bless\n\nThe day\n\nI just drift away\n\nAll my worries die\n\nI know that I'm alive\n\nI get\n\nWings to fly\n\nGod knows that I'm\n\nAlive\n\n(Kristian Lundin / Andreas Carlsson)"
