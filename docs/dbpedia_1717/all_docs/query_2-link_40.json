        "text": "Whether it was the members constantly stealing the show or SKZ going into rock star mode, there were many unforgettable moments. Upon the release of Stray Kids' single \"MIROH\" in March 2019, the year-old group told Billboard during an initial listening session that they imagined the song's anthemic dynamism could help to make themselves known at festivals and this is how, more than five years after the release of this song (and five number 1 albums on the Billboard 200 ranking), Stray Kids has kept its promises in terms of festivals and the even surpassed in many respects.\n\nHeadlining the second day of Lollapalooza 2024, SKZ arrived in Chicago on Friday night (August 2) for the biggest festival performance of his career, following major appearances earlier in the year at BST Hyde Park in London and at I Days in Milan. In addition to the release of \"ATE,\" which is currently the group's fifth consecutive track to chart on the Billboard 200, the members celebrated their multiple releases since their last stop in the United States as part of the Maniac World Tour in 2022-2023, with some special moments that illustrate the path traveled by the group.\n\nIt's in the company of a backing orchestra, as in London and Milan, that SKZ songs, like the new single \"Chk Chk Boom\", as well as fan favorites like \"TOPLINE\", \"Lonely St . \" and \"DOMINO\", benefited from a sound improvement which visibly pleased the leader of the Stray Kids, Bang Chan, who greeted the instrumentalists several times throughout the evening by telling them: \" I hope we have the opportunity to work together again » before the tour closes.\n\nHowever, beyond the heartwarming moments, including what seemed like an impromptu fan song to end, the Stray Kids also took advantage of Lolla to show off the true rock stars they are on stage and so we bring you to discover the seven best moments of the Stray Kids' performance during their appearance on the Lollapalooza stage.\n\nThe art of staging in “FREEZE”\n\nIt was after quickly capturing the public's attention with the 2023 single \"S-Class\" that the Stray Kids followed up with \"FREEZE\", a B-side from 2022's Maniac, which turned out to be a choice of very judicious repertoire to showcase their stage talent and musicality.\n\nAside from Changbin and Han's hip-hop prowess with lightning-fast rapping styles, Hyunjin caught all eyes by taking center stage during the dance sections, not to mention Lee Know's performance which exuded an undeniable ferocity as Seungmin’s high notes soared when he played with the guitarist.\n\nAlthough the performance was very intense, Han and Felix made everything look easy by affectionately wrapping their arms around each other during the verses. Despite the many high notes he had to play, even the youngest member, IN, quickly got comfortable, eventually taking off his leather jacket to reveal a sleeveless tee and constantly running towards the audience to encourage him to sing along with him.\n\nRemember that “S-Class” was a catchy introduction but “FREEZE” served as the ultimate hook, proving that the Stray Kids are real stars.\n\nHan's explicit 'Super Bowl'\n\nJust after “FREEZE”, Stray Kids followed up with “Super Bowl”, taken from their album 5-Star released in 2023, quickly confirming that this was not a typical K-pop performance but rather a a band ready to let loose and have fun, as evidenced by Han's playful lyric change before the final choruses. Indeed, instead of singing “Our dish here's so bussin'”, Han shouted “Our s- here's so bussin'!” \". Granted, Stray Kids fans have become accustomed to this explicit change during concerts, but it was somewhat unexpected to hear it uncensored on the Hulu live stream.\n\nThe decision was even more intriguing given that JYP Entertainment founder JY Park was on hand at Lollapalooza to witness the performance, but there was no denying Han's infectious, high-energy energy throughout the concert, which which is a good thing.\n\nAll about Felix\n\nAs an ambassador for the house of Louis Vuitton, Felix has gained worldwide recognition and recently made his debut on the runways of Paris Fashion Week, but Lollapalooza seemed like his time to fully assert himself as his rock- most authentic star.\n\nHe stood out for his lightning blonde hair, styled in flowing locks and small twisted braids, matched with superb white LV jackets, which made him look like a Greek god resplendent on stage. Throughout his performance, he often shifted from his typical deep voice to a more energetic octave, showing his vocal versatility and ability to come alive to better enthuse the crowd. To be convinced, just watch the performance of \"Charmer\", during which Felix twirled the sleeves of his vest around his shoulders and torso, revealing his abs and muscles, which unleashed the crowd and visibly shocked Han, his colleague in the group.\n\nFelix also frequently submerged himself in water, probably because of the Chicago heat, but he added a radiant, dripping aura to his stage presence. This is how he became a number one trending topic on social networks and above all established a new standard for K-pop artists, who must fully assume their rock-star attitude on stage.\n\nThe magic of “Maniac”\n\nIt was after a brief break to interact with the audience towards the middle of the set that the Stray Kids followed up five of their hits with an undeniable flagship track, “Maniac”, released in 2022. The piece is certainly impressive with its atypical production and its inspiring message, but the stage also allowed the group to be both casual and professional. Indeed, although members can wander and freestyle on stage, they can also seamlessly reform and return to their choreographed formations.\n\nUnlike K-pop groups who are known for their meticulously rehearsed choreography and CD-worthy vocals prepared for each performance, the Stray Kids' ability to freely switch between dance and freestyle modes is a testament to their success in such an industry. than America, where fans appreciate musicians who demonstrate authenticity and ease on stage.\n\nAlongside Bang Chan and Seungmin's high notes, \"Maniac\" showed another level of impressive stage performance for all eight members.\n\nHyunjin's show on water and stage\n\nIt can be said that no member of the group benefited as much as Hyunjin from the many bottles on stage because where the members of Stray Kids sprayed each other and the overheated Chicago audience, Hyunjin seemed to use the water in its own way.\n\nIn Lolla, he sported two very distinct looks and he always seemed soaked from head to toe, his white T-shirt becoming transparent due to the accumulated humidity, not to mention that the water accentuated Hyunjin's enigmatic presence on stage , which made it even more captivating.\n\nThe 24-year-old, a global ambassador for Versace, usually takes center stage for various dance sections, but at Lollapalooza, he took the stage in a more artistic (and more \"badass\") way. Barely had time to take center stage before he effortlessly stepped aside to let another member shine, not forgetting that his fierce stage presence is well known to STAY as well as K- fans. pop, and Lollapalooza allowed the world to see Hyunjin's true performing abilities.\n\nThe exceptional performance of “MIROH«\n\nThe track \"MIROH\" was inevitably one of the highlights of the album, given its anthemic production, but the Stray Kids took this five-year-old single to a whole new level with their performance at Lollapalooza. Indeed the original version presents the title with Felix's characteristic deep timbre, but the 23-year-old delivered the intro in an invigorating and captivating call to arms that allowed the song's intensity to grow with each moment to culminate, at the end of the song, in a fireworks display amid the gargantuan rhythms and screaming hooks of the song, thus giving an impression of true celebration and epic.\n\nAdditionally, cheers “Stray!” Kids! Woo! ” by SKZ and the fans during the performance of “MIROH” only made the spectacular ending even more perfect.\n\nBreaking the rules with “Haven”\n\nAlthough \"MIROH\" was the spectacular end to the evening, the Stray Kids still played other songs as a more relaxed encore, with a second rendition of \"TOPLINE\", the festival version of their latest single, “Chk Chk Boom,” as well as an impromptu performance of a special fan song to officially end the night.\n\nWhile the Kids bid farewell to the crowd several times, the guys kept coming back after hearing the crowd shout \"One more song!\" » which the members themselves began to repeat. So after “TOPLINE” and “Chk Chk Boom”, the members pressed leader Bang Chan to announce that they were going to perform another song so the latter pleaded in his friendly Australian accent: “ There are rules here and we have to leave at a certain time ! ” to which Han replied: “ No, you have to break the rules ! » .\n\nBang Chan then seemed convinced and told the audience: \" We will take responsibility if you get into trouble. » It was then after a quick meeting between the band members that they officially ended their set with the 2020 B-side, “Haven”.\n\nWhile “Haven” was the song that closed Maniac’s world tour, the lyrics particularly resonated on this occasion to cap off their career. » Do what you want…/ Right now, go out, do what you want » said the song, thus pushing the boundaries (of time) of their repertoire, but also acting as a warm reminder to their fans of the admiration and love that the Stray Kids have for their supporters, affectionately known as of “STAY”.\n\nOne of the last lyrics, \"I would like to stay with you\", is a double meaning for STAY while conveying their honest feelings and it is also a heartfelt way to end a moment that reinforced the true nature of rock star of the Stray Kids.\n\nWhat do you think of the Stray Kids' performance at Lollapalooza?
