        "text": "The 49-year-old Parisian, an Englewood resident and former maitre d' at manhattan's famous Daniel, on cars, food and how-despite a setback- life's still moving full speed ahead\n\nTip of the chapeau: \"I’m indebted to chef Daniel Boulud for giving me the opportunity to preside over one of the country’s finest venues for classic French cuisine. He taught me English too.\"\n\nCars for a cause: \"I always had a passion for cars, and a talent for restoring antique ones. I owned a Ferrari, a Porsche, a Lotus, a Maserati and several American cars from the ’50s. But I sold my collection to support my Manhattan restaurant, Bruno Jamais, for the last eight months prior to its closing on New Year’s Eve, a victim of the economy.\"\n\nAn era’s end: \"I’d like to thank the loyal patrons of my establishment over the past seven years.\"\n\nPlans for 2010: \"Finding myself and my next passion.\"\n\nThe race of life: \"Race-car driving is therapy for me, and I love the thrill of speed. Sometimes I race alone, other times I take a ‘co-pilot’ who is not afraid to go fast. The fastest I’ve driven is more than 200 miles an hour-on a Porsche track close to Paris.\"\n\nCurrent wheels: \"A Range Rover.\" Ultimate stress-buster: \"A long ride on my Harley-Davidson.\"\n\nFavorite meal: \"Not necessarily a complicated one, but one that’s well prepared and presented. Say, a rib eye or Porter- house steak with potatoes gratin or truffled mashed potatoes.\"\n\nGo-to healthy meal: \"Any type of lean fish and steamed vegetables.\"\n\nSip of paradise: \"I usually like a good Bordeaux such as Chateau Latour or Mouton Rothschild. In the summer, Paul Goerg Rosé Champagne.\"\n\nLocal dining: \"I like to go to Solaia, my friend Michel Bittan’s Italian restaurant in Englewood.\"\n\nWhy live in Bergen: \"It’s close to Manhattan, but has what I believe is a bet- ter quality of life.\"\n\nPersonal look: \"I like to wear Loro Piana and Berluti-sporty casual and chic. And watches that match my outfit, such as Panerai and Audemars Piguet.\"\n\nFrames of reference: \"I have a collection of art from the French artist Cyrille Margarit, who works with digital photos projected onto brushed aluminum. The pieces were on display at my restaurant.\"\n\nFilm favorites: \"The Shawshank Redemption, Midnight Express. And Basic Instinct – I’m a huge Sharon Stone fan.\" Must-see TV: \"Top Chef on Bravo.\"\n\nMusical choices: \"Jazz, classical and some ’80s pop. I like Ray Charles, James Brown and Billy Paul. Billy Paul’s ‘Your Song’ basically became a theme song for my restaurant. The customers would hear it at least once in an evening.\"\n\nQuartet of passions: \"Besides life and love, cooking, traveling, collecting car memorabilia-and my beautiful Siberian husky, Mr. B.\"\n\nTravel thrill: \"The island of St. Barts in the Caribbean.\"\n\nOn the nightstand: \"Car magazines.\"\n\nBestadviceever: \"To treat everyone with equal respect and always to act ethically, personally and professionally.\"\n\nEn famille: \"I have a daughter, Jessica, who is 26. She lives in France, has a boyfriend in the restaurant business and works for a temp agency that specializes in restaurants and the hospitality industry. And I am getting married in 2010 and trying to become a father again.\""
