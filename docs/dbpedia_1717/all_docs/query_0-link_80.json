        "text": "On iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Always-On display setting allows a dimmed version of your Lock Screen to stay visible, even when your iPhone is locked. By glancing at the dimmed screen, you can check essential information, like notifications, the date and time, and information in your widgets.\n\nThe display automatically turns off when iPhone is either face down or obstructed from view, not near a paired Apple Watch, when a CarPlay session begins, while Continuity Camera is in use, while Low Power Mode is on, while Sleep Focus is on, or at your usual bedtime.\n\nThe Always-On display setting is on by default. To turn it off, go to Settings > Display & Brightness, then turn off Always On Display."
