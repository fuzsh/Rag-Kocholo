        "text": "Kim Kitsuragi is a lieutenant of the RCM, and deuteragonist in Disco Elysium.\n\nBackground[ | ]\n\nKIM KITSURAGI – Detective, each of us has our part to play in the world. My part is to solve crimes. I am under no illusion that my role isn't a minor one, in the scheme of things... but I embrace it *because* it's my role, and it's yours too, detective, whether you accept it or not!\n\nChildhood and Ancestry[ | ]\n\nKim Kitsuragi was born in Revachol around '08 to half-Seolite parents; his paternal grandfather and maternal grandmother were from Seol.[7] He's never met his grandparents,[8] and cannot speak Seolite.[9]\n\nHis Seolite ancestry caused others to treat him poorly,[10] calling him racial slurs[11][12] and causing Kim to struggle with not being considered Revacholian,[13] despite being born and raised in Revachol. He prefers not to associate himself with Seol, instead calling himself a \"regular, garden variety Revacholiere.\"[14][8]\n\nWhen he was 2 years old, his parents were killed during the end of the Antecentennial Revolution. He was spared due to his young age.[15]\n\nAs a child, he dreamed of becoming an aerostatic pilot, and was particularly interested in the revolutionary air brigades.[16] He also had an affinity for the Franconigerian knights.[17] It is heavily implied that he was bullied in high-school for wearing glasses,[18] and is strongly against any unnecessary displays of force[19][20] against those who are \"weaker\"[21] because of this.\n\nAt one point, Kim had a complicated relationship with his given name, but decided not to change it.[22]\n\nRCM Career[ | ]\n\nKim has two decades of RCM service under his belt[23] and is assigned to Precinct 57,[24] he has solved a total of 102 cases (officially 104)[25]. Although he claims that he is neither the finest, nor the strongest officer at the Precinct, he is notorious enough for Trant Heidelstam to recognize him[26], and Harry to know his name and statistics offhand.[27] Jean Vicquemare also thinks highly of him, and says Precinct 41 would be flattered if he were to consider transferring.[28] Despite wearing glasses, he passes shooting courses 7 out of 10.[29] This is likely because he is farsighted.[30]\n\nKim joined the RCM in '31, at the age of 23, and worked as a juvenile police officer for the next 15 years. He tries to avoid teenagers to prevent setting off the Trauma-and-Stressor Disorder he developed during that time.[31] He was finally reassigned to homicide in '46, at 38. After 9 months of training to infiltrate a pinball ring, he became the pinball champion,[32] and the nicknames \"Kim 'Pinball' Kitsuragi\" and \"The Kimball\" stuck. He detests them both.[33]\n\nHe initially worked a year in Processing, handling bodies and evidence. He dislikes the whole department, considering them \"butchers and clowns\",[34] who are a \"wrecking crew\" routinely mishandling bodies and evidence.[35] Kim eventually earned his lieutenancy as a member of Criminal Investigation[36] and has since been decorated four times.[37] The last time he had killed anyone was in '47, four years prior to the case, and just a year after his reassignment.[38] His confirmed kill count is 6,[39] which may potentially be elevated to 8 after the Mercenary Tribunal, depending on the outcome.[40][41]\n\nSome time before his partnership with Harrier Du Bois, Kim had a partner who earned the nickname \"Eyes\" from having to show Kim things he was unable to see due to his farsightedness.[42] Their partnership ended poorly, and just saying his name aloud saddens Kim.[43] After the Mercenary Tribunal, an Empathy passive check reveals that Glen was not the first person to die in Kim's place, potentially hinting at a tragic end for Eyes.[44]\n\nPersonality[ | ]\n\nKim is a self-described \"torque dork\",[45] and enjoys maintaining and modifying his Coupris Kineema motor carriage.[46][47][48][49] His interest in motor carriages also appears to influence his music taste, as Kim listens to Speedfreaks FM. Though he is embarrassed by this, and denies being a \"speed-freak\",[50] as well as listening to the station at all,[51] he has the radio frequency committed to memory.[52] His interest in TipTop Tournée,[53] and pride in the engine power[54] as well as defensiveness of the speed[55] of his Kineema seems to suggest he is indeed a \"speed-freak\", however.\n\nDue to his past, Kim despises pinball[56] to an extreme degree[57] and tends to jump at opportunities to mention it.[58][59] He considers the historically themed pinball machines to be the worst.[60] and although Kim states he dislikes the \"fantastique\" science fiction themes of pinball,[61] he reads science fiction novels.[62]\n\nKim has played Wirrâl and is partial to sidhe and huldur races.[63] He also enjoys filling out the crossword outside of working hours.[64][65][66]\n\nKim is uncomfortable with emotional openness[67] and discussions about love, opting to hide in his notebook whenever the conversation turns to it.[68] He is afraid of becoming a joke,[69] and doing anything that earns him a reputation,[70] likely due to his past experiences being mocked for his pinball assignment. He dislikes dealing with personal affairs, and states that it's simply the nature of lieutenancy, however, it appears that this is untrue, as all lieutenants in the RCM are responsible for a team of lower ranking officers and have to deal with personal affairs quite frequently.[71] He is described as being even more \"repressed\" than Harry.[72]\n\nHe is aware of his bad habit of lecturing others, and has been working to stop himself from doing it.[73]\n\nKim writes almost everything down in his notebook, even if it appears to be inconsequential. He seems to have some trouble remembering details if he neglects to record them.[74] Kim states that he uses his notebook to make deductions and \"think\" by writing everything down rather than internally, like Harry does.[75] This can be observed while reading his notes[76] as well as through an Esprit de Corps passive check.[77] However, he is still capable of making associations without writing them out.[78]\n\nHe permits himself exactly one cigarette a day, usually at night when he goes over his notes,[79] though he is also shown to smoke after the tribunal once Harry awakens, with Endurance commenting that the cigarette has \"medicinal purposes\",[80] and again as during the final scene of the game while saying goodbye (if he is not recruited). It is implied that Kim has not quit smoking entirely because he would lose his \"cool factor\", and also relishes the control he holds over his addiction.[81]\n\nKim also tailors his clothing, stating that he is able to sew a lapel and center a back vent.[82]\n\nBeliefs[ | ]\n\nIn his twenties, Kim identified as a moralist, though now chooses to describe himself as someone who believes in the RCM.[83] It can be inferred that identifying as a moralist was potentially to appease his superiors in the organization, and he hesitates when asked directly.[84] He was once fond of the revolutionaries of the Antecentennial Revolution[16] which is implied to have influenced his interest in aerostatics.\n\nHe tends to mostly keep his opinions to himself, but openly disapproves of any form of discrimination based on race,[85] gender[86][87][88] or sexuality.[89][90] He loves Revachol above all else,[13] and fights to be seen as Revacholian, though he has never been treated as such by his fellow Revacholians, and is surprised when Harry states that he considers Kim a true Vacholiere.[91]\n\nKim is a follower of Dolorianism[92][93] and practices various Dolorian rituals, such as the Stations of the Breath[94][95] and crossing his chest in an X shape.[96] Yet, he claims he is not spiritual, as Dolorianism is considered secular in Elysium,[93] and is put off by religion.[97]\n\nMannerisms[ | ]\n\nKim maintains a relatively inexpressive and calm demeanor while on duty, with his intent being to project strength and represent the RCM positively.[98] He emotes primarily with his eyebrows,[99] and communicates through nods, both as a short and professional means of communication as well as to indicate sarcasm.[100] He conveys impatience by looking at his watch[101][102] and by tapping his foot[103][104][105]\n\nHe is described as being incapable of blushing;[106] instead, his ears turn red.[107] However, he may become flushed from anger.[108]\n\nBelongings[ | ]\n\nOrange nylon[109] aerostatic[110] bomber jacket[111] and dark green airman pants[112]\n\nThis is replaced with an identical black jacket[113] if the player has opened a new game in hardcore mode after having previously beaten the game in hardcore mode.\n\nOne[79] loose chestnut-scented[114] cigarette in his coat pocket[115]\n\nModified Coupris Kineema motor carriage\n\nContains a neatly organized pull-out toolbox with a red-tipped prybar, rubber-handled chaincutters, and Grundstellung RAO hand-cranked flashlight[116]\n\nElectronic[117] sports[118] wristwatch, on his left hand\n\nWallet[119]\n\nHandkerchiefs (multiple)\n\nBlue handkerchief[120][121]\n\nBlue checkered handkerchief[122]\n\nWhite handkerchief, lined with red. One corner is adorned with lace and a tiny embroidered \"Portier\"[123]\n\nMnemotechnique A6,[124] stored in an interior pocket[125]\n\nTwo blue[126] retractable[127][128] ball point pens[129]\n\nHe will lend the Blue Oblong Pen to Harry if necessary[130][131]\n\nSingle-shot Kiejl A9 Armistice[132], on a holster under his arm[133]\n\nSmall folding knife[134][135]\n\nTrigat Sunshine Mini, an instant color camera, in his coat pocket[136]\n\nRequires a metal-capped glass ampoule inserted into its side for every photo, which is broken following the shutter click and flash.\n\nInvolvement[ | ]\n\nAs Harry's partner for the duration of the case, Kim is always present unless someone has been arrested, he has gone to take the body to the morgue, or Harry sneaks out after saying good night after 21:00. Depending on Kim's opinion of Harry at certain key points of the investigation, the outcomes of various conversations and skill checks will change accordingly. While relatively easy to gain Kim's trust by simply treating him and others well, Kim disapproves of unprofessional behaviour[137]that casts the RCM in a bad light, such as extortion[138] and bribery,[139] and heavily disapproves of unnecessarily hassling civilians.[140] On a more personal level, insulting Kim, taking the side of racist and fascist ideology will lower his opinion of Harry, and he will confront him on several occasions about this. Taking drugs, drinking and smoking in front of Kim will not lower reputation with him, however, confiscating or asking for drugs will. The Goodest Of The Good Cops achievement is acquired by getting Kim to fully trust Harry, while reaching an all-time low will net the opposite Baddest Of the Bad Cops achievement.\n\nKim is first encountered on the first floor of the Whirling-in-Rags. He is impossible to miss, and will always join Harry before he is able to leave the building. Each morning he will be found either standing at the counter near Garte, or just outside Harry's shack in the Fishing Village on Day 3+.\n\nA passive Esprit de Corps check remarks that he would throw himself in harm's way for Harry, despite it being their first meeting.[141]\n\nFor two days prior to the first in-game day, Kim attemped to make contact with Harry, but he failed to meet up with Kim on both Saturday and Sunday due to his bender.[142]\n\nHarry is able to talk to Kim directly at any point during the investigation, both about the case and occasionally about himself.\n\nHarry can confess that he lost his entire memory, which Kim initially has trouble believing.[143] Over time he does come to trust that Harry is telling the truth about his amnesia, however, and even insists that it is true should Harry attempt to \"confess\" that it was a lie from the start.\n\nIf Harry shaves, Kim admits that he preferred the mutton chops, as they concealed the \"damage.\"[144]\n\nAs a part of the communist political vision quest, if the task Get yourself organised is active, Harry gains the option to smell Kim. He smells of the motor pool, where he spends much of his time, and of a cheap drugstore brand of aftershave he uses, which smells of pine needles.[145] If asked, he states that the brand is \"Taiga Super Special\", and that he likes the way it tingles, with it being the only part of shaving that he looks forward to.[146]\n\nIf Harry completes the Homo-sexual Underground thought, he can inquire about Kim's sexuality. Kim states that he is homo-sexual.[147]\n\nAsking Kim for a secret about himself leads to a display of the immense reserves of Authority which he very rarely invokes[148] upon Harry.[149] With the Jamais Vu update, it's possible to win the brow-off, and Kim will relent and tell Harry a secret. After this, the achievement Baddest Brow in Town will be unlocked.\n\nAn Interfacing thought orb may appear while walking in front of Kim's Kineema, which allows Harry to admire and discuss the vehicle with Kim. If Harry has enough points in Visual Calculus to suggest installing new helium headlights together, impresses Kim with his knowledge of the Kineema's engine prior to offering to help, and his reputation with Kim is greater than four, Kim will respond enthusiastically.[150] If Harry doesn't know enough about the inner workings of the vehicle, he will instead reply with a \"maybe\", which Rhetoric clarifies as meaning \"no\".[151] Alternately, if Harry knows enough about the engine, but his reputation with Kim is below four, he will instead say he'll \"think about it\" with Drama commenting that he's not enthusiastic about the idea.[152]\n\nIf Harry fails to pay his fee to the Whirling-in-Rags by the end of the day, Kim will sell a set of confiscated spinner hubcaps at the pawnshop for ✤ 200. He gives Harry the exact amount of money needed to pay off his debt, and pockets the rest for himself.[153] If Kim is not present when Harry sells the spinners, Harry is able to keep the full amount for himself.\n\nIf Harry has previously used speed or pyrholidon, asking Acele if she \"wants to party\"[154] will lead to Kim attempting to solicit drugs by pretending to be high.[155]\n\nIf Harry fails a red Authority check to get Kim to dance with him in the church, Harry calls Kim a racial slur. Kim leaves the building immediately after, and, if Harry follows him outside, he is given the choice to apologize or double down on it.\n\nThis will negatively affect Kim's opinion of Harry regardless of how high his reputation is.\n\nUnless the Mercenary Tribunal has already come to pass, Kim will leave for the rest of the day.\n\nIt is impossible to survive the encounter with Ruby unless Kim is in the party.\n\nMercenary Tribunal[ | ]\n\nSPOILER WARNING: Plot details for the main story follow. (Skip)\n\nKim shoots Ruud Hoenkloewen during the tribunal, though he only dies if Harry succeeds in either shooting Raul Kortenaer in the face, or hitting him with the Spirit Bomb. After Harry has been shot and Kim is preoccupied keeping pressure on his wound, a red Authority check determines Kim's fate. If the check is passed successfully, Harry is able to warn Kim of Phillis de Paule (or Kortenaer, if he was not killed earlier) approaching from behind, who Kim shoots and potentially kills. If Harry fails to warn Kim, he is shot and taken to Precinct 57's infirmary, and remains absent for the rest of the game (though he can still be \"seen\" in various Esprit de Corps passives). If he is incapacitated, Harry's partner becomes Cuno instead.\n\nSPOILERS END HERE. (Return)\n\nTrivia[ | ]\n\nKim's \"favourite blue thing\" is a blue police uniform, or blue police livery.[156]\n\nKim lives 20 kilometres away from Martinaise.[157]\n\nHis alarm is set for 6:50 AM; 40 minutes earlier than the time Harry wakes up each morning.\n\nIt is heavily implied that the unusually long period of time he spent working in the juvenile crimes unit is a direct result of the discrimination he faced from his colleagues at Precinct 57. When confronting Harry about his views on racism, he mentions having \"this conversation\" enough times in his life (though it may have been meant more generally).[10]\n\nDespite Kim's glasses appearing circular in artwork, they are described as being \"diamond-shaped\".[158]\n\nAlthough he seems to disprove of substance use on the job, if Harry has an amphetamine habit, Kim shows interest in taking speed in order to keep working the case after the tribunal.[159]\n\nKim also smoked weed when he was younger, and appears to be proud of this.[160]\n\nHe writes so quickly that his handwriting is nearly illegible.[161][162]\n\nKim is homosexual.[147]\n\nHe refers to Harrier Du Bois as \"the 41st\" in his notes - by his station number.[163]\n\nThere are rumours that Kim is working for La Puta Madre, but he insists that he is not.[164]\n\nHe has never really learned how to use radiocomputers.[165]\n\nKim prefers running to weightlifting, saying that it \"clears [his] head\".[166]\n\nKim is described as being shortish,[167] slim,[168] and scrawny.[169]\n\nKim reads the front page of the newspaper based on headline size.[66] This is likely due to his farsightedness.\n\nIf Harry agrees to holding a funeral for his sunken Coupris 40 Motor Carriage in a conversation with Lilienne Carter, Empathy will remark that Kim liked the idea, though he states that they don't have the time for it.[170]\n\nAfter completing Hardcore Mode for the first time, Kim's default orange bomber jacket will be swapped out for a black one on all subsequent Hardcore runs.\n\nBehind the Scenes[ | ]\n\nKim is voiced by Belgian actor Jullian Champenois in both The Final Cut and the original version of the game.\n\nChampenois was chosen for the role of Kim in the summer of 2019, citing the tone and personality of his voice as features that were favoured by the development team, as well as for his French accent, which was a requirement. Prior to this, he was a self-taught vocalist, and had only appeared in commercial voiceovers. After being chosen as Kim's voice actor, Champenois was given a beta version of the game to immerse himself into the world and become familiar with the character. Co-producer Kaur Kender told Champenois to use his natural speaking voice for Kim, which put Champenois at ease. He described the voice direction by Jim Ashilevi and Mikee Goodman as \"very professional but also very friendly.\"[171]\n\nPrevious showcases of the game (when it was still titled No Truce With the Furies) featured a different voice actor for Kim, with a much deeper voice, who remains unknown.[172]\n\nOn the official ZA/UM atelier website, Kim's Aerostatic Pilot Jacket, Aerostatic Crew Jacket, and Torque Dork Cargos list stats for each article of clothing, giving some possible insight into what his skillset may look like.\n\nHis orange bomber jacket is listed as giving +1 to Hand/Eye Coordination, while his black bomber is listed as giving +1 Interfacing and +2 to an exclusive Physique skill called Volta do Mar.\n\nHis cargos are listed as giving +1 to Interfacing and to another exclusive Motorics skill called Kinetic Dressage.\n\nKim's one-a-day cigarette habit may be inspired by a character in a previous PnP campaign headed by Robert Kurvitz. Trinidad Tranquille, Martin Luiga's character, had a \"system of smoking no more than five cigarettes per day to cut down on smoking costs\".[173]\n\nAccording to a ZA/UM developer, Kim's surname, Kitsuragi, was inspired by Neon Genesis Evangelion character Misato Katsuragi[174]\n\nGallery[ | ]\n\nConcept art\n\nConcept art\n\nUnused character model turnaround\n\nUnused character model profile\n\nUnused character model\n\nUnused hand-painted normal maps"
