        "text": "LinkedIn is sort of like your resume, on steroids. That is what I like to say when I work with folks who seek my advice on career matters. Just like with a resume, everything that I add to my LinkedIn profile should be carefully considered with the potential audience in mind. But LinkedIn is especially complex because users cannot be certain of the ultimate audience. So, while I can customize my cover letter and resume for a specific job, my LinkedIn profile can be seen by just about anyone, depending upon my security settings. Just in the past few weeks, visitors to my profile have included bankers, college professionals, engineers, students, social workers, and professionals of all sorts from the United States and probably 5 or 10 other countries! Unquestionably, it is tough to customize your profile to appeal to such a diverse audience.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to just express a true brand. What makes you unique? What makes you, you? What are you? Not in the sense of career and title necessarily but what sorts of threads make up your professional fabric. I am a big proponent of using the profile summary to express that fabric, but more recently I have been paying a lot of attention to the photographs that people use on their profiles and the message that I receive when I contemplate those photos.\n\nMost of us have heard the phrase “A picture is worth a thousand words” yet I wonder how many LinkedIn users contemplate that phrase when they, sometimes hastily, hunt for a photo to ‘complete’ their profile. I puzzle over some folks’ choice of photos and what might have been going through their mind when they clicked the “upload” button. Then again, maybe the message that I intend to convey with my photo is not the message that others receive when they look at the photo. When I chose my current photo, I was going for “Friendly, approachable, confident, professional, higher education leader and advisor.” Everything from the suit, to the smile, to the pillars that wrap around behind me were intended to send that message. I admit it, it was completely deliberate and when I eventually change my photo, rest assured, the next photo will be equally as intentional.\n\nPhotographs are an art form, so unquestionably they are open to interpretation and are not likely to be viewed the same way by each person. I look at a lot of profiles in my work. I mean a whole lot of profiles. In doing so, I have seen some photos that are just fantastic; in my view, they truly represent the fabric, the brand that the user is trying to convey. In other cases. . .well, I have to wonder. Here are some of the photographic faux pas (is that too harsh of a word?) that I have noticed on LinkedIn:\n\nThe Careless Crop: In the careless crop, a person has taken a photo of themselves, among a group of others and cropped themselves out, often in an uneven fashion and often leaving remnants of the people next to them, or chopping off parts of their own person in the process. Seriously? You do not have a good photo of just you, by yourself, in a decent shirt? Hmmm.\n\nThe Bridesmaid’s (or Groomsman’s) Blunder: This photo says, “Now, when was I last truly dressed up? I know, at my sister’s wedding!” Often combined with The Careless Crop (where you can see two additional bare or tuxedo-cladden shoulders, one to the right and one to the left), this photo sends the message “The best I have ever looked was when I was in a wedding (or on a night out with friends, or at that dinner party, or on New Year’s Eve).” Instead choose a photo that represents what you look like on your most professional day, on your job. Or if you espouse for advancement, dress for the job you intend to hold someday.\n\nSnugglin’ with Spot: Oh my. People and their pets! I love my dog, Bane. He is a fuzzy, fun, and energetic Bedlington Terrier and I often refer to him as “My other son.” Check him out in our selfie that is attached to this post. But no way Bane gets into my LinkedIn profile photo. Now, if you are a veterinarian or pet groomer, a pose that professionally includes an animal (minus the face-to-face cuddle, which might repulse some - not me, obviously) might be useful in sending a “I will be respectful, professional and kind to your pet” message.\n\nMe and My Snooggenz: I still see a lot of girlfriend/boyfriend, arm in arm in flannel shots out there (or just arm in arm in the ol' Homecoming or prom/formal apparel) Yuck! If you have a wife/husband occupational team where you preach or counsel together, this might make sense. My wife is endlessly supportive of who I am, what I do and my aspirations, but I still need to go out and get it done, pretty much on my own each day. What I am at work is somewhat different from what I am at home. Same person, similar characteristics, but a different view; as in my photo, the same guy, but in a suit. What are you professionally? If it is important for you to display a family image in your professional photo then a family shot makes sense, but make sure folks know which of the subjects in the photo is you.\n\nSilly Sammy Selfie: Oh dear. A pic of you, in a full length mirror (or worse, in the bathroom mirror or in a bikini or Speedo - blah!) pulling a selfie; cellphone camera and all. Nope. That is great for Instagram and Facebook but the audience you are dealing with in LinkedIn is not impressed (c'mon folks, think about your audience - LinkedIn is for grown-ups - it is not playtime). Try not to approach LinkedIn in the fun and frivolous way that you might other, more casual social media sites. A picture of you, taking a picture of you with your cellphone is just not appropriate for LinkedIn.\n\nHere in My Car, I Feel Safest of All (Remember the Gary Numan song?): Seriously? An armlength's shot of you driving? Is that really wise? It screams irresponsibility. Even a shot of you in the passenger seat or in the backseat of a car; a very strange message to send a potential connection. Folks, get a nice background, put on a professional (whatever your profession is) shirt or top and have someone snap a photo with a good camera phone. Nix the car photos; they look silly and the message. . .is unclear at best.\n\nThe Puny Person & The Ponderous Product: I recently saw a profile picture of a lady who works on large, impressive airplanes. The LinkedIn profile shot was taken from about 75 feet away and the whole aircraft along with this tiny, indiscernible human being were visible in the shot. Most people want to see you. It is possible to work with camera angles so that you can still convey the message, “This is me and I work on, design or build these huge things.” Want a shot with the whole product? Add a projects section and link to as many photos as you like.\n\nAfter The Earthquake: I call this shot “after the earthquake” because the subject either did an arms-length selfie or deliberately asked the photographer to take the shot at a weird angle. You know what I am talking about, the ol’ 45 degree angle shot? It looks like it was taken after an earthquake when the camera was jostled around. Don’t get me wrong. I love the creative angles when the subject is an artist, a photographer, an actor or someone in the creative arts. It sends the appropriate creative message, as long as the background also makes sense. But for business professionals, accountants. . .I’m not convinced. There are other ways for these folks to show creativity in their profiles.\n\nLondon Fog & Peter Pixel: Just an awful photo that is hazy (dirt/finger grease on the lens?) or one that is a low pixel image making the photo grainy or gritty looking. Today’s phone cameras are mostly excellent. Get someone with a Windows phone or IPhone to snap a new head and shoulders shot the next time you are looking professional.\n\nJeremy Jaundice: You know what I am talking about. The entire photo has this awful yellowish pallor. The face, the background, everything has this dull, yellow haze. People, take a new photo. Please! It's either the lighting or you have a lousy camera.\n\nMeet George Jetson (or worse, Peter Griffin): A disappointing attempt to equate one's personality with a cartoon or movie character (i.e. using a cartoon character or other strange image to \"represent\" oneself). I think this one baffles me the most, unless perhaps, the professional is a cartoonist or a contemporary artist.\n\nPatty/Pauley Partygirl/guy: The shot that was clearly taken at a party (note the partywear and, heaven forbid, glass of wine) with the open mouth, belly-laugh smile (alcohol-induced?). Please, replace this one, yesterday.\n\nThere are many other faux pas that I can think of but these are a few that I have seen more recently. Remember, LinkedIn gives you the opportunity to add a “Projects” section to your profile. Proud of your work? Want to display more photographs of you with your team, your products and with other artifacts in the foreground? Link to those images as part of the profile rather than using them as your main profile photo. Just some ideas to add to the Great Discourse.\n\nIt’s your future. Take charge!\n\nAs always, thanks for your readership. Now, let me describe my line of thinking. In my job, I play the part of a hiring manager. When people seek my ideas, I immediately transition to my \"alter ego”, i.e., someone with hiring influence in their profession. Then I look at their profile, resume, cover letter, or interview style from that unique perspective. If they reject my assessment, then they can ask someone with major hiring influence in their profession about things like their LinkedIn photo and or profile content. They should never just take my word for it, they should always seek dozens of opinions. When we put a profile out there for others to see, it is our responsibility to run an occasional quality check of the message(s) that it sends."
