        "text": "1929 painting by René Magritte\n\nThe Treachery of ImagesArtistRené MagritteYear1929MediumOil on canvasMovementSurrealismDimensions60.33 cm × 81.12 cm (23.75 in × 31.94 in)LocationLos Angeles County Museum of Art[1]\n\nThe Treachery of Images (French: La Trahison des Images) is a 1929 painting by Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte. It is also known as This Is Not a Pipe,[2] Ceci n'est pas une pipe[2] and The Wind and the Song.[3] Magritte painted it when he was 30 years old. It is on display at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.[1]\n\nThe painting shows an image of a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted, \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\", French for \"This is not a pipe\".\n\nThe famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? No, it's just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture \"This is a pipe\", I'd have been lying!\n\n— René Magritte[4]\n\nThe theme of pipes with the text \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\" is extended in Les Mots et Les Images,[5] La Clé des Songes,[6] Ceci n'est pas une pipe (L'air et la chanson),[7] The Tune and Also the Words,[8] Ceci n’est pas une pomme,[9] and Les Deux Mystères.[10]\n\nThe painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message[11] like the Alfred Korzybski's \"The word is not the thing\" and \"The map is not the territory\", as well as Denis Diderot's This is not a story.\n\nOn December 15, 1929, Paul Éluard and André Breton published an essay about poetry in La Révolution surréaliste (The Surrealist Revolution) as a reaction to the publication by poet Paul Valéry \"Notes sur la poésie\" in Les Nouvelles littéraires of September 28, 1929. When Valéry wrote \"Poetry is a survival\", Breton and Éluard made fun of it and wrote \"Poetry is a pipe\", as a reference to Magritte's painting.[12][13]\n\nIn the same edition of La Révolution surréaliste, Magritte published \"Les mots et les images\" (his founding text which illustrated where words play with images), his answer to the survey on love, and Je ne vois pas la [femme] cachée dans la forêt, a painting tableau surrounded by photos of sixteen surrealists with their eyes closed, including Magritte himself.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of paintings by René Magritte\n\nDirect and indirect realism – Debate in the philosophy of mind\n\nSelf-reference – Sentence, idea or formula that refers to itself\n\nSimulacra and Simulation – 1981 book by Jean Baudrillard\n\nSubtext – Aspect of communication that is not explicitly announced\n\nTheory of forms – Philosophical theory attributed to Plato\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nAllmer, Patricia.
