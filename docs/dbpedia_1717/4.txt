Papa, why do you play all the same old songs Why do you sing with the melody 'Cause down on the street something' goin' on There's a brand new beat and a brand new song In my life there was so much anger Still I have no regrets Just like you, I was such a rebel So dance your own dance and never forget N'oubliez jamais I heard my father say Every generation ha its way A need to disobey N'oubliez jamais It's in your destiny A need to disagree When rules get in the way N'oubliez jamais Mama, why do you dance to the same old songs Why do you sing only harmony 'Cause down on the street something's goin' on There's a brand new beat and a brand new song In my heart there's a young girls passion For a life long duet Someday soon someone's smile will haunt you So sing your own song and never forget N'oubliez jamais I heard my father say Every generation ha its way A need to disobey N'oubliez jamais It's in your destiny A need to disagree When rules get in the way N'oubliez jamais What is this game Searching for love or fame That's all the same One of this days You say that Love will be the cure I'm not so sure N'oubliez jamais I heard my father say Every generation ha its way A need to disobey N'oubliez jamais It's in your destiny A need to disagree When rules get in the way N'oubliez jamais
