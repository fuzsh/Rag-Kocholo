        "text": "Spinoza’s philosophy radically changed the framework of Western thought in the seventeenth century and deeply influenced its further development. Drawing on different traditions of thought, he created a system of philosophy that challenged the views of his contemporary readers in almost every domain. From his metaphysics to his epistemology, from his account of morals to his political theory, from his method of interpreting Scripture to the method of exposition that he employed in his main work – namely, the Ethics Demonstrated in Geometrical Order (1677) – there is not a single aspect of Spinoza’s philosophy which has not been thoroughly examined and discussed. Yet, Spinoza’s theses and arguments continue to influence philosophical debates. Spinoza’s substance monism, his identification of God with nature, his strict necessitarianism, his unique account of the mind–body relationship and of human affects, and his passionate defense of religious freedom and freedom of thought are still a source of inspiration for many thinkers and the focus of several studies, not necessarily related to the limited domain of the history of philosophy."
