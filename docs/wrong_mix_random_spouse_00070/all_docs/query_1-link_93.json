The quote on the pedestal reads: \"The goal of the state is freedom\" (Het doel van de staat is de vrijheid). \n\t\n\tAccording to the artist, the icosahedron (Icosaëder) is a symbol of Spinoza's thinking: the universe as a model, polished by the human spirit.\n\t\n\tBenedict De Spinoza (1632—1677):\n\tSpinoza was a Dutch Jewish philosopher, one of the foremost exponents of 17th-century Rationalism and one of the early and seminal figures of the Enlightenment. His masterwork is the treatise Ethics (1677).\n\t\n\tSpinoza’s cloak in addition to sparrows and parakeets carries roses. Spinoza wore a signet ring with a rose and the word 'caute', which means cautious. The name Spinoza is derived from the Portuguese esphino: thorn. Spinoza was born from Portuguese immigrants who came to Amsterdam as refugees.\n\t\n\tNext to Spinoza is a cut block of granite with twenty equilateral triangles, a reference to his profession. In addition, it also symbolizes the philosophy of the philosopher: the universe as a model, polished by the human spirit.\n\t\n\tThe mount is elliptical like the orbits of the planets in the universe.  Spinoza tried to contain and name the spiritual universe.\n\t\n\tNicolas Dings:\n\tNicolaas Dings was born in 1953 in Tegelen. After graduating from the City Academy in Maastricht, he left his native region and trained himself further in the profession at the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam.\n\t\n\tOn 24 November 2008, Amsterdam’s Mayor Job Cohen and Cultural Councillor Carolien Gehrels unveiled this monument by Nicolas Dings near the City Hall on the Zwanenburgwal, where the house in which Spinoza was born once stood. By commissioning to make a sculpture in honor of Baruch de Spinoza (later in life he called himself Benedictus de Spinoza) the Spinoza Monument Foundation wished to pay homage to one of the greatest thinkers of the 17th century and one of the most important cultural innovators in the history of mankind.",
