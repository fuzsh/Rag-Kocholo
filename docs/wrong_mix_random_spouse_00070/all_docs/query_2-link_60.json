        "text": "Critical heir of Cartesianism (an intellectual movement sparked by the thought of René Descartes), he is considered one of the three great rationalists of 17th century philosophy, along with the Frenchman René Descartes and the German Gottfried Leibniz, with whom he also had a small correspondence.\n\nSpinoza (1632-1677) was raised in the Portuguese-Jewish community of Amsterdam. He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the one divinity. The Jewish religious authorities issued a cherem (the highest Jewish rabbinic censorship and implies the exclusion of a person from the community to which he belongs) against him, which caused him to be expelled and rejected by Jewish society at the age of twenty-four (1656). He then resided in The Hague, where he dedicated himself to working as a lens polisher.\n\nIn philosophy, he is one of the main representatives of rationalism. His magnum opus, Ethics, was published posthumously in the same year of his death (1677). The work is characterized by a rationalism that opposes the Cartesian dualism of mind and body.\n\nSome commentators have suggested a pantheistic interpretation of Spinoza's philosophy, maintaining that there is an identification between the only reality (substance) and “God” or “Nature” (pantheism). In this interpretation, reality is eternal, infinite and perfect, but very different from the personal god of classical theism, and all things in the universe are simple \"modes\" of God, therefore, everything that exists tends to persevere in its be (conatus), in the case of human beings it manifests itself as the desire to live according to the dictates of their reason.\n\nIn his Theological-political treatise (1670) critically analyzed the Judeo-Christian religion, and defended the “freedom of philosophizing” and democracy. His political theory unified the purpose of the State and the ends of the individual (preserving his rational being) through social order, political authority and laws.\n\nSpinoza was frequently attacked for his political and religious views. His contemporaries frequently called him an “atheist,” although he did not deny the existence of God in any of his works. Harassed for his criticism of religious orthodoxy, his books were included in the Index librorum prohibitorum of the Catholic Church (1679). His work circulated clandestinely until it was claimed by great German philosophers of the early XNUMXth century: \"Schleiermacher [...] Hegel, Schelling all proclaim with one voice that Spinoza is the father of modern thought.\" His philosophical and moral achievements led to Gilles Deleuze to name him “the prince of philosophers.”\n\nfamily origins\n\nHe was born in Amsterdam (Netherlands) in 1632, from a family of Sephardic Jews who emigrated from the Iberian Peninsula, fleeing religious persecution.\n\nTheir family roots are in Espinosa de los Monteros, where the surname of their relatives was “Espinosa de Cerrato”. The Espinosas were expelled from Castile by the decree of the Catholic Monarchs of March 31, 1492, and decided to settle in Portugal. There they were forced to convert to Catholicism to continue remaining in the country when Manuel I of Portugal, the Fortunate, married Isabel of Aragon, eldest daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, and ordered the Jews who occupied important positions in the country to be baptized. by force (doctors, bankers, merchants, etc.). At that time one hundred and twenty thousand Jews were converted and the Espinosas were able to live in peace until the Inquisition was established in Portugal about forty years later. ​\n\nSpinoza's grandfather, Isaac de Espinosa, went to Nantes (his presence is attested in 1593), but he did not stay there, because Judaism was officially proscribed and because of the hostility that existed towards the “Marranos” and especially towards the Portuguese. Apparently expelled in 1615, he arrived in Rotterdam with his family, where he died in 1627. Gabriel Álvarez, father-in-law of Isaac and paternal great-grandfather of Spinoza, was sentenced to death on August 20, 1597 by the Portuguese Inquisition, although this sentence would be commuted to one of galleys (a penalty that was imposed on certain criminals and that consisted of rowing in the king's galleys. It was imposed for the commission of degrading crimes or for recidivism that could not provide for the rehabilitation of the convicted person). ​\n\nHis father, Miguel de Espinosa, was a reputable merchant and an active member of the Jewish community (synagogue and Jewish schools).\n\nEducation\n\nSpinoza was educated in the Jewish community of Amsterdam, where there was religious tolerance, despite the influence of Calvinist clerics. Despite having received an education linked to Jewish orthodoxy, for example, attending the lessons of Saúl Levi Morteira and Rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel (the man who negotiated with Cromwell the return of the Jews to England), he demonstrated a quite critical attitude towards these teachings and was self-taught in mathematics and Cartesian philosophy, with the help of Franciscus van den Enden, who gave him not only Latin lessons from the age of eighteen, but also \"new science\" instructing him in the ideas and works of Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Harvey, Huygens and Descartes.\n\nHe also read Thomas Hobbes, Lucretius and Giordano Bruno, and these readings distanced him from Jewish orthodoxy. To this, we can add the influences of the group of collegiate (collegians), liberal Dutch Protestant Christians, as well as Spanish-Portuguese Jewish heterodoxies represented mainly in the figures of Juan de Prado and Uriel da Costa.\n\nExpulsion from the Jewish community\n\nAfter his father died in 1654, the philosopher no longer had to keep his disbelief hidden out of respect for his father figure. He then became involved in a lawsuit with his half-sister regarding his father's inheritance. Having won Baruch, however, he renounced his large inheritance, taking only \"a good bed, with its linen.\" In the course of the lawsuit, Spinoza's orthodoxy was called into question. The leaders of the synagogue offered him a pension of nine thousand guilders if he left Van den Ende and returned to Orthodox Judaism; but Spinoza did not compromise and, on July 27, 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued an order of cherem (a kind of prohibition, rejection, ostracism or expulsion) against Spinoza, then twenty-three years old. The anathema in question was originally written in Portuguese, the translation of several fragments of the text is as follows:\n\n[…] for a long time [there was] news of the wrong opinions and erroneous conduct of Baruch de Spinoza and by various means and warnings they have tried to steer him away from the wrong path. As they did not obtain any result [...] they resolved [...] that he be [...] expelled from the people of Israel, according to the following decree [...]: [...] we expel, execrate and curse Baruch of Spinoza [...] before the Saints Books of the Law with their [six hundred and thirteen] prescriptions, with the excommunication with which Joshua excommunicated Jericho, with the curse with which Elisha cursed his sons, and with all the execrations written in the Law. Cursed be the day and cursed be the evening; damned is he when he lies down and damned is he when he gets up; damned when he leaves and damned when he comes back. May the Lord not forgive him. May the wrath and anger of the Lord be unleashed against this man and cast upon him all the curses written in the Book of the Law. […] We order that no one maintain oral or written communication with him, that no one render him any favor, [ …] that no one read anything written or transcribed by him.\n\nThe cherem against Spinoza in the Book of the Agreements of the Nation.\n\nThen he was banished from the city, which was divided into two groups:\n\nAshkenazim: Jews from Central Europe who, suffering strong persecution during the Middle Ages, emigrated en masse to Eastern Europe, but also to the Netherlands and England.\n\nSephardim: Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula and a group to which Spinoza belonged. It was a group partially influenced by the humanist tradition.\n\nThe Ashkenazim were a closed group. At some historical moment it seems that their norms were more orthodox and rigid than those of the Sephardim. It was the majority group in Amsterdam.\n\nAfter the expulsion, he retired to a suburb on the outskirts of the city and wrote his Apology to justify his abdication from the synagogue, a lost work that some authors consider a precedent for his Theological-political treatise (TTP). Furthermore, he maintained his dealings with Mennonite and collegiate Christian groups, with a fairly liberal and tolerant Christian character.\n\nIn keeping with the Jewish custom of having a job to support oneself, he had learned to polish glass lenses for optical instruments, especially for his friend the scientist Christiaan Huygens. Apart from earning a living with this work, he received, according to some of his biographers, a pension that his friend Johan de Witt obtained for him.\n\nWriting your works\n\nIn 1660 he moved to a house in Rijnsburg, a coastal town near Leyden, which is currently a museum dedicated to the philosopher and where he wrote his exposition of Cartesian philosophy, entitled Renati des Cartes Principia Philosophias (Descartes' principles of philosophy, PPC), with the appendix of the Cogitata Metaphysica (Metaphysical thoughts, CM), published in the summer of 1663 (Latin ed.; the immediate Dutch version appeared in 1664); These were the only two works published under his name during his lifetime. Its impact was so great that it made its author famous, whose home began to be frequented by all kinds of figures from the Dutch Golden Age, including Huygens and Jan de Witt. It is also believed that it was then that he composed his Brief treatise on God, man and their happiness. There he began an abundant correspondence with intellectuals from all over Europe, especially a fifteen-year correspondence with Henry Oldenburg, a German diplomat who was in London and one of the secretaries of the Royal Society. In the early years of 1660, he also began to work on your Tractatus de Emendatione Intellectus (Understanding Reform Treaty, TIE)​ and in the most famous of his works: the Ethics (E), completed in 1675.\n\nIn 1663 he moved to Voorburg, near The Hague, where he frequented liberal circles and became close friends with the physicist Christiaan Huygens and with the mathematician and then head of government (raadspensionaris) Jan or Johan de Witt, who offered his help regarding the anonymous publication of his Theological-political treatise (TTP) in 1670, a work that caused a great stir for its criticism of religion. These diatribes against the TTP, and also the barbaric murder (they even ate part of his corpse) of his protector and friend Witt in 1672 after the defeat of the Dutch army by the English, which was taken as a divine punishment because of the statesman's tolerance towards the unbelievers - a crime condemned by Spinoza with the pasquín Ultimi barbarorum, they convinced him not to publish new books as long as he lived; The works would circulate in copies without printing permission and in manuscript among his admirers. In the following years his isolation increased and, given the fear for his own life, at the beginning of 1673 he would negotiate “asylum in Livorno” with the Grand Duke of Tuscany through the mediation of the philosopher Lorenzo Magalotti.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
