        "text": "About the workâ€¦\n\nSometime after his sentence of excommunication Spinoza began working of the ideas which would eventually be published as The Ethics,[1] a book published posthumously from the fear of persecution from the charge of the blasphemy of pantheism.[2] Pantheism should be distinguished from \"panentheism\" which is the view that gods are in all things. Spinoza believed, much as Socrates believed, the excellent life is the life of reason in the service of one's own being. The soul seeks knowledge as a good; indeed, the soul's highest good is knowledge of God. Spinoza argues that the mind and the body are, in reality, only one thing but can be thought of in two different ways. The person who understands how the soul is part of the system of nature also understands, at the same time, how the soul is part of God. In sum, Spinoza's monism[3] is the deductive exposition of existence as the complete unity of God and nature. According to this view, human beings have no free will, and the world cannot be evil."
