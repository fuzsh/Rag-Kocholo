        "text": "One of Judaism’s most controversial figures, Baruch Spinoza was a radical free thinker led by strong moral principles despite his disbelief in an all-seeing God. Seen by many as Satan’s disciple during his life, he has been regarded as a secular saint in death.\n\nMany contradictory beliefs have been attached to him: liberalism, despotism, atheism, pantheism. But his defence of universal freedom is as important in our own time as it was in his.\n\nAward-winning historian Jonathan Israel is joined by Bard College professor Ian Buruma to discuss the boldest and most unsettling of the early modern philosophers, one who had a far greater impact on the Enlightenment than has previously been recognised."
