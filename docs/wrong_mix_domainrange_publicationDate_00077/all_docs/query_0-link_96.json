        "text": "I first read Harrison’s Stainless Steel Rat books when I was in college, but for some reason never found out about his other books. They’re not all comedies or satires either; it was Harrison who wrote Make Room Make Room, in which we discover the exact nature of Soylent Green, and West of Eden. That said, I prefer his satiric novels. They may be somewhat sophomoric in their humor–a garbage collector in Bill The Galactic Hero is named Basurero–but taking that into account they’re no less enjoyable than most YA novels.\n\nBill The Galactic Hero is possibly the best known, at least judging by the number of reviews on Goodreads; the number of sequels may have something to do with this. As the book begins, the eponymous hero is an innocent farm boy on an isolated backwash planet; as he is plowing a field with a robomule, the Galactic Armed Forces recruiting group marches by and dragoons him into the military. After adventures that I’m quite glad I didn’t have to live through, including a hellish basic training with one Deathwish Drang, fuse changing aboard the Christine Keeler while battling the Chingers and descending to quite literally the lowest depths of the Imperial Planet Helior, Bill makes his peace with the military, and the book ends approximately as it began: back on Bill’s home planet as the military recruiting troop marches past his family farm…\n\nAdmittedly, this is a low humor trashy science fiction take on what Joseph Heller did at greater length in Catch 22…but then (with apologies to the author!) what I’ve read of Harry Harrison’s work isn’t terribly sophisticated. The humor and writing style are at a clever high school or sophomoric college level (think Bored of the Rings) but then I’d heartily recommend this to any teenager interested in science fiction and/or signing up for ROTC. You’ll never look at the military or space opera with interest again, and you certainly won’t be able to read Asimov’s Foundation or Olivaw/Bailey books, Joe Haldeman’s The Forever War or indeed any science fiction novel which involves interspecies warfare with a straight face again…and don’t even try Battlefield Earth.\n\nStar Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers is a sendup of the space opera of the 1950s and 1960s with more than a soupcon of Cold War paranoia and stereotypes straight out of the Boy’s Own Magazine. Chuck van Chider and Jerry Courtenay are hearty red-blooded American college students who sublimate their [clears throat] desires into hearty exhausting sports and time consuming complex higher education; through a good natured jest, they discover that a bit of Chider Cheddar can power a space twister device powerful enough to shift a 747 hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye. When they test it, they discover that unless one calibrates carefully, the machine is powerful enough to transport them THOUSANDS of miles, and even light-years. This error leads them, and companions buxom Sally and Old John the school janitor cum Red Spy, on a merry jaunt across the galaxy before they managed to correctly adjust the device and, with a bit of a time twist, come home just as they’re leaving.\n\nI’ve never gotten more than a hundred pages or so into space opera books like the Lensman/men series before tossing them across the room in exasperation at their purple prose, implausible situations, testosterone laden posturing of impossibly brilliant and athletic male protagonists and misogyny. So what’s not to like about a sendup of space opera with a couple of overgrown McGyver style boy scouts, which additionally takes on Cold War paranoia, gender relations, and racial stereotyping? The whole book is something of a shaggy dog story with a twist ending, aside from the lampooning of the whole space opera subgenre of science fiction.\n\nThe Technicolor Time Machine did about as much for me in regards taking time travel seriously as Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers did Space Opera (I never was too keen on war books and movies.) The protagonist, a producer for an all but bankrupt movie studio, is approached by a Hungarian scientist, who had invented a time machine but been unable to find backing from more conventional scientific institutions in order to improve and expand the machine’s capabilities. Leasing it out to a studio is the only way he can earn money to continue research. Hendrickson, who must produce a blockbuster by Monday in order to reassure the studio’s investors, quickly arranges a Viking Discovery of America Extravaganza, complete with real Vikings. Just about everything goes wrong that can go wrong…and I’ll stop there so as not to give anything away, though I will only say “It ends happily. Mostly.”\n\nAs someone on GoodReads pointed out, this is the type of time travel story in which the “future” characters’ intervention in the past does NOT change the past and with it their present, as opposed to the “shoot your own grandfather and snuff yourself” variety, and as with Harrison’s other novels, the less seriously you take it, the better you’re going to enjoy it."
