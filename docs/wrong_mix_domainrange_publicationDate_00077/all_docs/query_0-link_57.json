        "text": "Harry Harrison: Harry has to be my favorite author. I first started with his Stainless Steel Rat books and there was no going back from there. I'd have to say that all Harry Harrison's books are excellent. The earlier Stainless Steel Rat books are his best. Among my favorites are Rebel in Time, One Step from Earth, the To the Stars series, the West of Eden series, the Deathworld series, and of couse, all the Bil the Galactic Hero books. Make Room, Make Room and Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers are also excellent. Another great among greats is Captive Universe. To date, I've read every book he's written. James P. Hogan: James Hogan is incredible. Almost all his books are excellent with great science and awesome stories. I first started reading Hogan with the Giants books and have never been able to stop. The depth and complexity of his novels keep me comming back. Among my favorites are Minds, Machines and Evolution, Endgame Enigma, Thrice Upon a Time, The Proteus Operation, Realtime Interupt, Code of the Lifemaker (and Inmortality Option), Voyage from Yesteryear and Two Faces of Tomorrow. To date, I've read every book he's written. Joe Haldaman: Joe Haldaman keeps me comming back for more. The first book of his I read was Forever War and I've managed to read it about twenty times since. All of his books are deep with strong stories. The man has a gift, I don't know if any other way to put it. Some of my favorites include Buying Time, None so Blind, Dealing in Futures, Tool of the Trade and All My Sins Remembered. I just wish he would write more books! To date, I've read every book he's written. Douglas Adams: Well, all I can say is he really should write more books. The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series is a true classic. I've read them so many times I've lost count. The Dirk Gently books are also wonderful! Waiting for more! Of course, I've read all his books (yeah, all seven). Michael P. Kube-Mcdowell: This is one talented guy with a long name. The Trigon Disunity books are really awesome. Quiet Pools and Exile were very good, but Alternites was excellent. It seems he's spending all his time writing Star Wars books now. Bummer. Michael McCollum: Michael writes great stuff. His books aren't deep but they are exciting and fun. I'm not sure what happened to this writer but his flow of books have stopped cold. The Antares books are my favorites (I wish he would FINISH the damn series!). Life Probe, Procyon's Promise and his others are all very good. More books, please! Oh yeah, I've read everything he's written. Leo Franskowski: Leo is a nut and his books are better for it. The Conrad Starguard books are a blast to be enjoyed over and over. Belive it or not, I haven't read all his books! I can't find Copernick's Rebellion anywhere and A Boy and His Tank just came out. Can't wait! Tom Clancy: I like Clancy's stuff. All his \"Jack Ryan\" books are very well thought out with great, compelling stories. I also really liked Red Storm Rising, although it seems a bit dated before it's time. I've read them all and I can't wait for more! Stephen Coonts: Stephen Coonts writes great stuff. The guy has some kind of magic. All his books are great. Flight of the Intruder was a breakthrough and he was able to take Jake Grafton into greater and more complex adventures. The Cannibal Queen is one of his best. A true story about his trip around the country with his son in a restored Steerman, it's engaging and thoughful. He's got two new books which aren't in paperback yet. I'll be checking everyweek and I can't wait to read them! Larry Bond: Allbooks and three great stories. Red Phoenix is really a work of art. Amazing story. His other books are all excellent and well worth reading. Check them out! Orson Scott Card: I first read part of Ender's Game in a short story Sci-Fi book. When I discovered the whole book I almost passed out. The whole Ender series is great and I really need to get off my rear and read his other books. I'm working on it! Greg Bear: Greg Bear is amazing. His books just blow you away. I started with The Forge of God and Anvil of Stars and was hooked. The \"Way\" books are his best, an absolutly stunning vision of one possible future. Hell, we almost named one of our cats \"Jart\"! All his stuff is good but I really like Blood Music, Strength of Stones, Hegira, Psychlone, and Moving Mars. I've read everything I could find and I'm still looking for more! Gregory Benford: Benford writes some seriously awesome hard science fiction. The Galactic Center books are a unbelievable collection of mind twisting stories. Heart of the Comet, Artifact and Matter's End are also great. I've read everything I can find and I'm getting more all the time. Larry Niven: What can I say, I'm hooked. I first read Footfall about five years ago and then went into high gear and read everything else. His work with Jerry Pournelle and Steven Barnes has produced some of his best stuff. My favorites include Lucifer's Hammer, World Out of Time, Gift From Earth, all the Ringworld books, all the Integral Trees books, Protector, The Mote in God's Eye, the Gripping Hand and the \"Exploration\" books (TheLegacy of Heorot, Beowulf's Children and Destiny's Road). The Descent of Anansi was also great. I've also read all the book collections with Gil Hammilton and Beowulf Shaeffer. I've read everything I could find and that's most of it. Waiting for more!"
