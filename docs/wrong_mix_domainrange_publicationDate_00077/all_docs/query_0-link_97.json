        "text": "I first knew Harry Harrison from reading \"A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!\" in my youth. Lots more people know him as the author of the extraordinarily popularStainless Steel Rat books and those who don't know him from that know him as the author of Soylent Green the classic movie starring that guy who played Moses (cue Burns shouting \"Soylent Green est Menchenflesh!)\n\nNow I know him as totally charming. Harry Harrison, who was just awarded the Nebula Grandmaster award, is just a ball of joy to be around. He's loquacious, captivating, and engaging. When I did his portrait for Where I Write he was nothing short of useful, wrapped around successful, stuffed inside gregarious. He's been a graphic designer (back when they did everything with pencils and razors), a comic book artist, a soldier, and a novelist, and he learned Great Things from all of them.\n\nI could listen to him all day. coppervale was quoting something that Frederick Pohl mentioned in his autobiography. It was very similar to something that Harry Harrison told me that day I was sitting on his sofa, trying to out drink him, -- I think it's useful for more than just people who write or draw, so I'll post it here:\n\nWhen I write, I just sit down and I write. If you can't do that, you can't be a writer. Even when you're sick. Sometimes I'd be very sick, coughing, with a fever and I'd be going down the stairs to work and my wife would say \"You're sick, don't work today\" -- but really, if you don't work, who else is going to do it?\n\n-- Harry Harrison\n\nWisdom from a titan. Work hard, everyone.\n\nWork hard. That's how you fill the dream gulch.\n\nFrom: ernunnos\n\n2009-05-13 06:09 am (UTC)\n\nJealous. So jealous. Are you guys wearing the same pilot watch?\n\nFrom: kylecassidy\n\n2009-05-13 05:22 pm (UTC)\n\nabout two weeks from now he goes back in time to give it to me so we can both wear it for this photo.\n\nactually mine's a citizen aqualand. i should have gotten the eco drive version. dang dang dang dang.\n\nFrom: circle23\n\n2009-05-13 06:50 am (UTC)\n\ndude\n\nare you drinking cheap swill with a titan??\n\nFrom: niamh_sage\n\n2009-05-13 07:48 am (UTC)\n\nHow utterly cool! :D I remember reading and loving Harry Harrison books in highschool. I have a bunch of Stainless Steel Rat too. (Ooo and I just remembered, when I was at university, a couple of friends and I riffed off the SSR series to produce a few very silly short stories in a similarly fantastical vein. I wonder where those are now?)\n\nFrom: habiliments\n\n2009-05-13 08:10 am (UTC)\n\nWhether or not you're actually drinking from that bottle, the simple fact that you're holding it like you are gives this picture extra levels of win.\n\nFrom: morlith\n\n2009-05-13 01:12 pm (UTC)\n\n+1! It's very easy to out-drink someone if they're using a glass and you're using a bottle!\n\nFrom: anyher\n\n2009-05-13 09:07 am (UTC)\n\n\"A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!\" is one of the first SF books, i read. Also \"Technicolor time machine\" was in some Soviet collection of American SF, i found and read in childhood. Harrison is so cool.\n\nFrom: kylecassidy\n\n2009-05-13 01:08 pm (UTC)\n\nEvery single one of his books is still in print in Russia. They love him extra there. He just did a big book tour there where they feted him like Tolstoy. (As well they should.)\n\nFrom: kejlina\n\n2009-05-13 11:08 am (UTC)\n\noh my god! you met Harry freaking Harrison! A few years ago I spent a summer reading my way through the Stainless Steel Rat series. I was amused by his frequent use of Esperanto in each book :)\n\nFrom: kylecassidy\n\n2009-05-13 01:10 pm (UTC)\n\nHe said; \"I speak 4 or 5 other languages -- including Esperanto, I speak it like a native.\"\n\nFrom: kylecassidy\n\n2009-07-15 12:26 pm (UTC)\n\ni asked him about esperanto and he said (gleefully) \"I speak it like a native!\"\n\nFrom: humanoid27\n\n2009-05-13 12:19 pm (UTC)\n\ni met him a few years back at Novacon. lovely man. i'm hoping he can make it to this years novacon.\n\nFrom: gandryyne\n\n2009-05-13 12:55 pm (UTC)\n\nLOVE the University of Roswell shirt! LOL!\n\nThis is a very coool series, K. Can't wait to see who else you have lined up! :)\n\nFrom: chairtomorrow\n\n2009-05-13 01:00 pm (UTC)\n\nI see that there's another artist who drinks Jim Beam like me and GG Allin.\n\nFrom: velvetfrogg\n\n2009-05-13 01:07 pm (UTC)\n\nTrying to outdrink him, huh? Is that why he has a glass and you have a bottle?\n\nFrom: kylecassidy\n\n2009-05-13 01:11 pm (UTC)\n\nIt's laborious work.\n\nFrom: i\n\n2009-05-13 01:15 pm (UTC)\n\ngreat quote, awesome author.\n\nFrom: jilder\n\n2009-05-13 01:29 pm (UTC)\n\nBill the Galactic Hero got me through high school. Which probably says a lot about my high school experience.\n\nFrom: katemckinnon\n\n2009-05-13 02:49 pm (UTC)\n\nThat's a great photo. I love this project.\n\nFrom: i_love_tazzus\n\n2009-05-13 03:12 pm (UTC)\n\nI'll have to read his books sometime... :)\n\nAh, you got a bottle of the best bourbon, sir.\n\nFrom: arkham4269\n\n2009-05-13 04:00 pm (UTC)\n\nFor those not on it, Neil Gaiman has an interesting take on the quote about working.\n\nOf course Neil was a bit surprising in today's post. Not to often you see an artist say something to a fan, \"George R.R. Martin is not your bitch.\"\n\nToday's comments by #1 Neil are very informative and I think all of us have felt like the guy who asked the question so I recommend everyone reading it.\n\nFrom: blu_muse\n\n2009-05-13 04:33 pm (UTC)\n\nThis is exacly why I love reading your LJ... you constantly make me re-think my perspective by sharing such great people. Thank you Kyle!\n\n(Deleted comment)\n\nFrom: kylecassidy\n\n2009-05-13 05:49 pm (UTC)\n\nits like trying to arm-wrestle charles atlas.\n\nFrom: roninspoon\n\n2009-05-13 06:02 pm (UTC)\n\nA Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah</a> is one of the best alternate history novels around. I love it, and Harrison is one of my favorite SF authors to this day.\n\nFrom: hhbarmaid\n\n2009-05-13 07:31 pm (UTC)\n\nAh Kyle, Another highly inspirational post! Lately I have found working hard to be... well... hard. Needed to \"hear\" this post much today. Thanks! Does not work for me to be jealous of you doing this project when I am not working hard enough to do one just as fabulous myself some day!\n\nFrom: kylecassidy\n\n2009-05-13 08:02 pm (UTC)\n\nYes, don't get jealous, get inspired. I think envy or jealousy or whatever that feeling in your gut is when you don't have something for show-and-tell but everyone else does can be very useful. Channeled properly it drives the engine of the world.\n\n(Deleted comment)\n\nFrom: kylecassidy\n\n2009-05-14 05:58 am (UTC)\n\nwe aim to please! get crackin'!\n\nFrom: jecook\n\n2009-05-14 02:45 am (UTC)\n\nWow, that's awesome."
