Jim and the twins, James and Bolivar, along with Agent Sybil, rush to investigate, tangle with a physicist who may or may not have lost his right hand, and end up in a place at the opposite extreme of the theological spectrum. Much chasing about, lots of special temporal gadgets, more people with silly names and sillier mannerisms, and the usual wise-cracking all follow, in the time-honoured SSR style, with just enough added grimness in grey Purgatory to save the story from being total fluff."
