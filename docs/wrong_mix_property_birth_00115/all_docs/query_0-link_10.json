        "text": "When I visited Mingo Junction, Ohio in March 2006, the main street next to the mill was alive car and foot traffic coming in and out of bars and pool halls and stores. When I went back in November 2009, the downtown was ghost town-quiet. Here is a closed pool hall and grill \"for sale\" I saw on that day.\n\nColin Higgins of Mingo Junction quotes his father as saying, \"It's not like we worked in some canning factory in some huge city. No. We built this entire community on the steel mills and because of that it wasn't just a job. We invested our lives in those mills! We built those mills, we ran those mills, we sweated our asses off and went without to strike for those mills! Don't tell me that there's something else those men can do! Go to school? These men are in their fifties with mortgages. When the well dries up, there's no big city for us to head to, no job we can get like the craftsmen. If you don't have that paper, you don't have nothing. And it never mattered anyway, when I think about how we used to give shit to anyone who drove a Jap car, because GM bought American steel, so we drove American cars. But once the gettin' was good and the price went up, they bought that Jap steel quicker than shit like we were nothing. And we marched on D.C. and asked for a tariff, something to give us a little room to squeeze in there, and there's some dick in a suit telling me that free trade is better in the long-run, and you just know that guys never seen the inside of a factory, or been to Mingo Junction where our little boys go to school and ask their daddies why they have to give up and shut up, why he's selling his things, why his mommy and daddy fight over the kitchen table every night with bills spread out! We had it all when we were organized, when it meant something to love what you do and protect what you love, but now we've got nothing. That's what we got when we signed that paper they pushed in front of us saying that we could end the strike today if we carved up the plan and a lot of good it did, goddamnit, can't you tell? So don't tell me it's stubborness, because these are the same men who had to swallow every inkling of pride that once streamed through their veins like his own blood and put his head down when he picks up that check at the unemployment line. Don't tell me it's laziness because we would've done anything to stay competitive. And don't dare to say that we're living in the past, because we were born steel men and its kinda hard to work at Wal-Mart after that.\"\n\nSep. 2023 image by author\n\nBy the time this photo was taken, many parts of the Mingo Junction steel mill had been demolished. It had not been fully active in 15 years. The old blast furnace, ore bridge, and associated buildings had been removed. But this part of the mill remained, although it seemed quiet and inactive on this day.\n\nSep. 2023 image by author\n\nAnother view of Mingo Junction, Ohio along the Ohio River.\n\nNov. 2009 image by author\n\nThese people living in the shadow of the former Wheeling-Pittsburgh steel mill at Yorkville, OH had a reason to be glad when this 2009 photo was taken: The mill's owner, Severstal Wheeling, had announced that it would reopen the cold rolling mill, which had been idled for most of the year. In 2012 the mill looked like it might go down the drain with its bankrupt owner, RG Steel, but Esmark Steel Group saved the day by purchasing the plant and giving it a new lease on life. However, the plant closed a few years later. It has since been torn down.\n\nImage courtesy of RG Steel\n\nInside the Yorkville mill. Originally a plate plant of Wheeling Steel, it was later a cold rolling mill. When the former Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel empire fell apart at RG Steel's bankruptcy, Esmark purchased this mill (again) and announced that they would reopen it as Ohio Cold Rolling Co. But the plant did not reopen, and the gas was turned off in March, 2013.\n\nImage courtesy of RG Steel\n\nShown here is the former Wheeling-Pitt mill at Martins Ferry, OH. At one time products manufactured here included \"SofTite\" galvanized sheets, galvanized roofing, corrugated culverts, hand-dipped ware,\n\nNov. 2009 image by author\n\nWheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and National Steel/Weirton Steel weren't the only steel companies to operate in the Wheeling-Steubenville part of the Ohio Valley. Some of these buildings were probably once part of Carnegie Steel Company's Bellaire Works.\n\nNov. 2009 image by author\n\nSteel wire stockpiled in Bellaire, OH.\n\nNov. 2009 image by author\n\nPlayground next to the old Belmont Lead Coated Steel Casket Company factory in Shadyside, OH.\n\n1942 image courtesy Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA-OWI Collection\n\nIn this vintage picture from Chase Brass & Copper Co. in Euclid, OH molten metal is being poured into a mold to form a billet.\n\nFeb. 2008 image by author\n\nFreighter vessels hibernating in front of aggregate and limestone processing plants in Fairport Harbor, OH.\n\nFeb. 2008 image by author\n\nFairport Harbor is frozen over in Winter.

The steel mill itself closed in 1980 and was demolished in 1989.\n\nJul. 2006 image by author\n\nAfter the steel mill closed the coke works continued to be operated under the name New Boston Coke. This operation closed in 2002 but here are the remaining coke ovens and coal processing building that remained in 2006. The metal doors on the ovens have been removed, leaving the refractory brick lining of the ovens naked."
