        "text": "Disclaimer\n\nThe information given below represents the best recollections, analysis, and interpretations of the author. The reader is strongly urged to examine the great volume of source materials, especially the many items that express conflicting views and opinions, and formulate his or her own conclusions.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI wish to acknowledge the efforts of many who have helped make this narrative possible. First, thank you to my wonderful wife Greta who has patiently kept so many balls in the air as I have had to divert so much time and energy to this endeavor. Secondly, I must express my deepest gratitude to my courageous proofreaders – Katrina Collins, Keith Parker, Brenda Wade, Barrion Palmer, David Slaton, and Bill Kuhn. In defense of my proofreaders, any grammar or spelling errors that remain in this narrative are the product of more recent edits on my part. Finally, many thanks must go to David Burger and IEEE for their willingness and ability to take my story public.\n\nDedication\n\nTo students everywhere whose achievements may have been untimely, especially those \"on the spectrum.\"\n\nPreface\n\nDecades ago, I had a series of encounters with a person with autism, a young boy prone to explosive \"meltdowns\" but who possessed an uncanny memory for historical documents and baseball statistics. That boy is now a college graduate and successfully employed, thanks to patient and loving parents, educators and employers who were willing to help, and very hard work on his part.\n\nThrough observation, I thought at the time that I had come to have some meaningful understanding of this autism, at least of the \"high-functioning\" variety, certainly understanding it enough that I could relatively easily recognize it in others. What I later came to learn, however, is that autism is often invisible, that many affected people are remarkably good at what is called masking, and they may become increasingly skilled as they get older. Masking is the physically, emotionally, and mentally exhausting process of putting on a face, of playing a role, of mimicking others' behaviors, in order to blend into \"neurotypical\" society.\n\nSo just how good can some be at this masking? The answer is astoundingly good. So good, in fact, that persons who think they understand the condition can even hide it from themselves... for decades.\n\nPersons like me.\n\nOn 14 April 2020 at the age of 55, thanks to Dr. Megan Crisler and her team at Silver Linings Neurodevelopment, I received a clinical diagnosis of \"Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1 Without Cognitive or Language Impairment,\" a condition still commonly known as \"Asperger's Syndrome.\" Having previously almost aced the two more popular Asperger's quizzes on the internet, the professional assessment came as little surprise. However, it was critical that I finally remove the last doubts. Suddenly, a life of continuous struggle, confusion, and exasperation had an explanation. I am still the same person as before the diagnosis, but now I see everything through an entirely different lens.\n\nEasily 99.9% or more of my narrative below was written before my Asperger's \"discovery.\" However, because I now more fully understand that I experience the world in a way that is very different from most, I think it is important that the reader have some appreciation of the autistic perspective. Autism, no doubt, contributed to my difficulties in trying to positively influence people and outcomes in the story you are about to read. It also very much colored how I processed what was happening. The autism \"spectrum\" is commonly misunderstood as a line ranging from non-existent to severe, with \"normal\" or neurotypical on one end and severely disabled, completely unable to function independently, on the other. On the outside, as we might measure it by how it appears to others, the concept is arguably useful. However, the spectrum that is autism is, in reality, a basket of mix-and-match traits, disabilities, and abilities. On the outside, one's autism might appear mild, but if there is one thing common to all forms of autism, it is its unrelenting intensity on the inside.\n\nThe reader might not sense that from my writing. He may note that I will offer little to nothing of my understanding of the motives or intentions of others in my account. Somewhat similarly, my viewpoint may seem largely that of an emotionally detached observer, only occasionally punctuated by glimpses of deep but mostly stifled frustration and bewilderment. Autistics, like neurotypicals, feel very normal and often forceful emotions. However, we struggle to communicate them and to perceive them in others. My grammar is instinctively pedantic, as carefully chosen words are my means of compensating for my overall difficulties in processing and executing the full bandwidth of human communication — eye contact, facial expressions, body language, and so forth. Thus, as I so often misunderstand others and am misunderstood in return, my necessary style of speaking gets reflected in my writing style.\n\nWhen I first set out to write this story, my purpose was largely therapeutic, to achieve some greater sense of closure to what was a baffling and traumatic experience. More recently, however, I have a new purpose, to present a case study in how the world is so sadly ill-suited to deal with autistics. We do not politic; we do not schmooze; we are inept at lying; our messages are encoded in our words and not \"between the lines;\" we only ask questions to which we actually want honest answers; and we have no mental coprocessing ability to be one person while simultaneously pretending to be another. Yet strangely to us, neurotypicals consider themselves the \"normal\" ones.\n\nThe narrative I will share is a necessary blend of non-technical and somewhat technical material. I would recommend that the non-technical reader simply skim the more technical sections. The more scientifically/mathematically-inclined person is encouraged to check my work. I must apologize to the reader for my difficulties in maintaining a consistent verb tense. The telling of this story requires frequent transitions forward and backward in time, making it challenging to maintain a consistent time reference. I must also apologize for frequent repeated cross-references; the web of confusion I will attempt to unravel is simply not conducive to a serial presentation.\n\nA Samarium Cobalt magnet levitates above a superconducting disc of Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide cooled with liquid nitrogen in a styrofoam cup (1987).\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn February of 1987, scientists at the University of Houston and The University of Alabama in Huntsville separately[1] announced the discovery of superconductivity above 90 K[2] in a material consisting of yttrium, barium, copper, and oxygen (YBCO[3]). Thirteen years later, Dr. Robert Cava of Princeton University, who has worked with the copper oxide superconductors since 1986 (then with Bell Labs), offered one of the more candid retrospectives of that event and the environment surrounding it:[4]\n\nThe excitement that electrified the physical science community after the discovery of superconductivity above the temperature of liquid nitrogen in early 1987 spread into the popular press and from there to the public at large. There were many newspaper stories, TV news reports, and several best-selling books written about the events surrounding the initial discoveries. These popularizations made some into heroes, some into villains, some minor players into geniuses, and some major players invisible. None of them ever matched my view of what actually happened. The accounts in this country seemed always to be a blend of the actual facts with American cultural values and stereotypes – such as our national pride, our desire to root for the underdog, and our need to associate remarkable historical events with the great deeds of individuals rather than the collective efforts of many different people.\n\n…the event that attracted everyone’s attention [came when] the story began to circulate that M. K. Wu at the University of Alabama [in Huntsville] and Paul Chu at the University of Houston (Wu was one of Chu’s former students) had found a superconducting copper oxide with a transition temperature of 90 K…\n\nAs of the time of this writing [2000], more than a dozen years after the determination of its composition and the filing of the patent applications, the U.S. Patent Office is yet to determine who rightfully holds the patent to this material. Aside from the ancient Zen question: “What is the sound of one hand clapping?” no other single question, it seems, has ever been more difficult to answer.\n\nRustum Roy, co-founder of the Materials Research Society, similarly observed in a letter to Chemical and Engineering News (to be covered, and cited, later in this narrative):\n\nEither these reporters [attributing the discovery to Paul Chu] know something the rest of us don’t, which I again ask them to reveal, or they are guilty of much poorer fact checking than most general magazines, such as the New Yorker. We have all been reading a lot about sloppiness and fraud in science. Is there an analogy here? Scientists, like politicians, are learning that the meta-reality created by the media is often more powerful than the reality. One would like to think that science journalists could serve as watchdogs-- not lap dogs-- of the general press. One would hope that the carefulness and modesty with words that has served science well would be the key attributes also of science journalism. Instead, as J. J. Gilman, senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and one of the nation's leading materials scientists, writes: \"Unfortunately, immoderate promotion has been on the rise. It has reached new heights in the newspeak world of superconductivity.\"\n\nFor those at least marginally familiar with some version of the YBCO discovery story, it will quickly become obvious that what I relate below has very little in common with the most widely disseminated accounts (perhaps consistent with Cava’s sentiment). Confined to the events having a causal relationship to finding the YBCO superconductor, the true story is, in fact, not particularly difficult to tell, as causality constrains us largely to a two-month period. It also can (and will) be corroborated with great precision by the evidence, and, unlike most accounts, is not one of brilliant scientists or their insightful vision (again in line with Cava’s perspective). The “science” (if one can call it that) is dirty and ugly, fraught with mistakes, blunders, and failures – many of them, which are, in my understanding, the basis on which success is often achieved.\n\nThe principal characters in this story are Paul Chu (University of Houston), M. K. Wu (UAH and former student of Chu), and myself, Jim Ashburn (UAH, Wu’s student at the time the discovery was made). Chu, by virtue of his position, has enjoyed many more forums for his oration than have I. His stories, at least with regard to the key events along the critical path to the discovery, have virtually nothing in common with my own (or, at times, each other). Wu’s story has rarely surpassed a couple of sentences in scope and has appeared to me to be an attempt to close the gap between Chu’s stories (and there are many) and mine. All three perspectives and more will be addressed in this narrative in varying degrees. Other characters in the story such as Ruling Meng (Houston), Pei-Herng Hor (Houston), and C. J. Torng (Huntsville) will be introduced as the narrative warrants.\n\nA photo from the fall of 1987 showing from left to right: Pei-Herng Hor (Houston), Ruling Meng (Houston), Laura Greene (AT&T Bell Labs), Jim Ashburn (Huntsville), Maw-Kuen Wu (Huntsville), and Ching-Wu “Paul” Chu (Houston).\n\nAs stories are told and retold, the telling and retelling itself can become its own fascinating tale, and such is the case here. The first part of this narrative will cover the events leading up to the discovery, the discovery itself, and to a lesser degree (as succinctly as I am able) the events leading up to the time of this writing. The second part is a closer examination of the “retellings,” many of which I will have introduced in the first part. Having collected so much material for so long, I have been rather snidely called by at least one critic YBCO’s “self-appointed curator.” That assessment is perhaps even true, but the position is only held reluctantly, and this narrative represents my best and most serious attempt to relay the baton.\n\nPart I, The Discovery of Superconductivity in YBCO\n\nLiquid nitrogen-cooled superconductor.[5] It is hard to say when this term might have first been used, only slightly less difficult perhaps to identify when it first appeared in print, and there is little doubt that the idea predated the reality by decades. Recall that superconductivity was an unexpected spoil on the quest for absolute zero, with the milestones along the way being the liquefaction of common gases – oxygen (90 K), nitrogen (77 K), hydrogen (20 K), and finally helium (4 K). Ironically, it has been some of these same temperatures in reverse that became the more prominent markers on the path towards making superconductivity more practical. For seventy-five years liquid nitrogen’s affordability and efficiency as a refrigerant had loomed as a seemingly unreachable goal, but thanks to the work of an insightful pair of scientists at IBM Zurich, 1986 would climax with the impossible seemingly within reach. On June 1st of that year, a paper appeared with little fanfare in the journal Zeitschrift für Physik by the title “Possible high Tc superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O system,” documenting evidence for superconductivity at an unprecedented 30 K.\n\nFar from Zurich, the summer of 1986 was quiet at the Physics Department of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. I was working there in the superconductivity lab with junior physics professor M. K. Wu and had just submitted my paperwork for the physical exam required to fly on NASA’s KC-135 (the “Vomit Comet”).[6] Our lab had been flying packages on that aircraft, exploiting the microgravity conditions to increase the critical temperature (or Tc, the temperature below which a given material will superconduct) of various superconducting alloys. The graduate student who had previously been tending the experiments found the experience quite literally nauseating, and I was slated to replace her. My plans, however, would never come to fruition.\n\nWith the start of the fall semester, Wu hired another graduate student, Chuan-Jue Torng, to help with the experiments.[7] “C. J.,” as he was known then (he now goes by the name “Terry”), was newly arrived from Taiwan. His English was a bit rough the first year, but he still quickly learned the routine of our lab.\n\nDecember 1987\n\nWu spent the first week of December 1987 at the fall Materials Research Society (MRS) Meeting in Boston, a semiannual event we rarely missed. It is my understanding that on the previous Friday, Wu’s former graduate advisor, Ching-Wu “Paul” Chu, from the University of Houston, along with a group from the University of Tokyo led by Koichi Kitazawa, independently presented results confirming the recent observations by Bednorz and Müller – possible superconductivity around 30 K in an oxide of lanthanum, barium, and copper (LBCO).[8][9] Kitazawa further revealed that his group had isolated the 30 K superconductivity to the barium-variant of a series of phases[10] (often called “double perovskites” at the time) first characterized in the early ‘80s by French chemists Claude Michel and Bernard Raveau.\n\nBy Chu’s accounts, he had called Wu over the weekend following the meeting, asking him to help track down a paper by the French group, presumably among the ones cited in the original Bednorz-Müller paper (either reference #16 or #21). Wu located the paper at the Redstone Scientific Information Center library[11] on the following Monday and immediately faxed it to Chu in Houston. By my recollection, Wu also retrieved on the same trip several related papers (including others by the Michel-Raveau team[12]) that I presume were also faxed. Copies that were given to me about the same time are still in my files as of this writing.\n\nAmong the titles were these:\n\nC. Michel, B. Raveau, “Oxygen intercalation in mixed valence copper oxides related to the perovskites,” Revue de chimie minérale 21.4 (1984): 407-425 (reference #16 in the Bednorz-Müller paper).\n\nN. Nguyen, J. Choisnet, J. Hervieu, B. Raveau, “Oxygen defect K2NiF4-type oxides: The compounds La2-xSrxCuO4-x/2+d,” Journal of Solid State Chemistry 39.1 (August 1981): 120-127.\n\nN. Nguyen, F. Studer, B. Raveau, “Oxydes ternaires de cuivre a valence mixte de type K2NiF4 deficitaires en oxygene: Evolution progressive d’un etat semi-conducteur vers un etat semi-metallique des oxides La2-xSrxCuO4-x/2+d,” Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids 44.5 (1983): 389-400.\n\nL. Er-Rakho, C. Michel, J. Provost, B. Raveau. “The Oxides La3-xLnxBa3Cu(II)5-2yCu(III)1+2yO14+y.” Journal of Solid State Chemistry 37 (1981): 151-156.\n\nThe first paper covered the phase to which Kitazawa had attributed the superconductivity in LBCO as well as its strontium and calcium cousins, in the abstract identified this way: La2−xAxCuO4−x/2+δ (A=Ca, Sr, Ba). Chu would later claim that the strontium substitution was his independently-conceived idea,[13] although both it and calcium were obvious candidates well before we had faxed the papers to Houston.[14] The second and third papers specifically focused on the strontium variant. In hindsight, the French group may have missed a Nobel Prize by simply failing to run their resistivity tests to lower temperatures. This is essentially the first of many near misses to be described in this narrative.\n\nThe fourth paper, which I will later identify as the “Er-Rakho et al. paper,” specifically describes substitutions of yttrium for lanthanum in a compound of lanthanum, barium, copper, and oxygen.[15] Chu will later claim to have independently conceived this substitution as well (a topic to be discussed ad nauseam in the pages to follow).\n\nAt least for a while, it would not be necessary in Huntsville to dream up new candidate materials, as the work by the French chemists included their examination of the electrical conductivity (down to 77 K) of a host of different compounds. Clearly, each showing metallic behavior[16] was a strong candidate for superconductivity.\n\nI feel compelled to interject here that I have no illusions about the inevitability of the YBCO discovery; after the Bednorz-Müller announcement, it was indeed only a matter of time. If not at Alabama, then perhaps at Bell Labs, or Bellcore, or Tokyo, or elsewhere within weeks or months, an opinion I believe would be shared by the vast majority of researchers in the field.[17]\n\nConcurrent with gathering some of the necessary reagents and additional equipment to work with the new materials, Wu, C. J., and I spent the remainder of the week on measurements of samples from our ongoing research. The previous two years had been devoted to studies of superconductivity in the immiscible alloys Ga-Bi and Al-In-Sn processed in microgravity conditions. It seems ironic now that we had previously been studying ways to turn one 7.7 K superconductor into an 8.3 K superconductor and another 6.5 K superconductor into a 7.4 K superconductor.\n\nDesigned for low melting point alloys, the furnaces we had used for our microgravity studies would be woefully inadequate for the copper oxides.[18] To mitigate this limitation, Professor Jack Davis, whose office was just across the hall from Wu’s, made available a furnace of his. Its capabilities would be marginal. An old but rugged piece of equipment housed in a stainless steel cabinet, the analog controller topped out at three digits – 999 °C. It would be several months before I would learn the significance of this constraint. Davis’s lab was also home to a second furnace being used by Jason Kinser,[19] a friend of mine and graduate student of Professor Elmer Anderson.[20] Jason was experimenting with vapor growth of zinc selenide crystals and would occasionally offer us the use of his furnace, which was capable of temperatures around 1200 °C. By the end of the second week of December, the preparation of our first copper oxide sample was under way using simple solid-state reaction[21] of oxides and carbonates.[22]\n\nA few of the reagents salvaged from the UAH superconductivity lab.\n\nWhen I first joined Wu, he had been recording results from his AC resistivity and magnetic susceptibility tests on a plotter. Using two low voltage supplies, input signals to the plotter would be offset so that higher sensitivities could be used. The plotter data would then be read manually (one of my jobs, of course) and then biased, scaled, and translated as necessary.[23] Typically, no more than 40 to 50 points would be obtained for each test to be entered into a computer by hand for charting. Having grown very weary of this chore, I seized an opportunity when Wu brought a Hyundai personal computer in the lab. I soon had the computer interfaced with the lock-in amplifier via its RS-232 interface, an A/D card receiving the thermocouple and germanium thermometer signals, and custom GW-BASIC programs[24] controlling everything, automatically adjusting the lock-in amp’s sensitivity, translating the thermometry signals to temperature, saving the data files, and plotting the results. Relatively bug-free by the time we began our work on the copper oxides, this new system enabled us to perform much more accurate tests at a much faster pace.\n\nTesting typically began on a new sample with simple four probe AC resistivity tests from room temperature down to 4 K. On occasion, magnetic susceptibility tests would be performed as well. An entry for each test was made in a hardbound laboratory notebook,[25] including the date, sample composition (sometimes abbreviated), type of test, data file name, inputs, and various notes.[26] All data was collected by the PC and saved to floppy disks. Incidentally, about fifteen years later, I challenged friends Drew Callan, Toby Flynn, and Matthieu Mollet to attempt to recover the data from the original disks. The file systems on many of the disks were damaged. Bit copies were performed, often with different results from each try. File fragments were often scrambled. The linked archive is my best effort at reconstructing the original results and can be cross-checked with any of my references to specific test results.[27]\n\nBy the following Monday, the 15th of December, we were testing our first copper oxides (UAH Lab Notebook page 11). While we initially recorded only “La-Sr-Cu-O” for the first several tests, my recollection was that the specific composition was La1.67Sr0.33CuO4 (as we will later note explicitly when we begin to vary the composition), one of the compounds studied by Michel and Raveau. With CaCO3 (the base mineral in limestone) even easier to come by than its strontium counterpart, La1.67Ca0.33CuO4 samples were prepared as well (UAH Lab Notebook page 12), guided in part by the earlier work of the French scientists as we worked up the alkali earth column in the periodic table (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg).[28] Having run so many tests on “single digits Kelvin” superconductors, the results of the resistivity test on sample #SR1, for example, seemed unreal – the apparent onset of superconductivity around 35 K. A second test, #SR2, confirmed the results. The following day, a test on sample #CA1 (La1.67Ca0.33CuO4) showed its resistivity taking a downward turn around 15 K.[29]\n\nAround mid-December, we received by mail some samples from the University of Houston. According to our records, at least one of the samples was identified in our notes as La3Ba3Cu6O14 (UAH Lab Notebook, page marked 12).\n\nSome of the samples received from Houston by the UAH team.\n\nI must pause here to point out that the La3Ba3Cu6O14 composition was almost certainly taken from a paper by the Michel-Raveau group; absent the more detailed structural analysis performed by the French scientists, Houston would have had little reason to normalize the composition to something other than La0.5Ba0.5CuO3-y (as indicative of the presumed perovskite-like structure), or possibly LaBaCu2O6-y if integer subscripts were preferred. This particular copy[30] came back to me by way of Ruling Meng (Chu’s lab manager) around 2009. Ironically, the Michel-Raveau group had, in the very same paper, explored partial substitutions of lanthanum with the other rare earth elements, including yttrium. In many ways, their compositions were even closer to the subsequently identified pure-phase YBCO superconductor than the initial mixed-phase material that will mark the discovery. Their paper further emphasizes the fact that the long-running (but irrelevant) contention about “who was the first among the Huntsville and Houston teams to suggest yttrium” is, at a minimum, no debate about brilliance on the part of anyone. It would seem to be more of a debate about who can read. While Chu would like many to believe that the Huntsville team’s work with yttrium was prompted by an idea of his, my recollection is that my “original” idea to at least consider yttrium was likely taken from this very paper, a publication whose existence prior to the discovery and its relevance to the copper oxide materials should be undisputed. I would additionally suggest that Chu’s “original” idea to consider yttrium likely came from the same source (as La3Ba3Cu6O14 almost certainly did). I will revisit the “whose idea was yttrium” question again later.\n\nThe first page taken from my old copy of the Er-Rakho et al. paper.\n\nWhatever the nature of the Houston samples or the reasons they were sent to us (my recollections on this are uncertain), our tests showed only partial transitions around 30 K.[31] Four tests were conducted on two different pieces from the first batch. A fifth test was conducted on December 22nd on a piece from a second batch (UAH Lab Notebook page 13). Concurrent with these tests, we in Huntsville continued to process samples of La1.67Sr0.33CuO4, varying the processing temperatures and times as well as exploring slight variations in the lanthanum-to-strontium ratios (UAH Lab Notebook pages 13-14), with an eventual trend towards lower levels of alkali earth substitution for lanthanum.\n\nTesting continued vigorously through the holidays with the exception of Christmas Day (see UAH Lab Notebook, page 14). It was some time during this period that I developed a concern about the inherent disorder of lanthanum and strontium in the so-called double perovskite materials. The base formula for most of our samples, La2-xSrxCuO4, could be thought of as a solid solution of La2CuO4 and Sr2CuO3.[32] In other words, lanthanum and strontium tend to randomly substitute for each other. Some discussions over Christmas with high-school friend Daniel Shultz,[33] who had just completed his ceramic engineering degree at Georgia Tech and recently enrolled as a graduate student at UAH, led to the idea of a makeshift ball-mill; if the physics was not conducive to a naturally ordered distribution, then ball-milling would at least help ensure that the starting mixture was at least as uniform as possible. My obsession with the La-Sr disorder will be strongly reflected in many of the compositions to be tested in January.\n\nBy the 27th of December, we had conducted a total of 29 resistivity tests and one magnetic susceptibility test on various La-Sr-Cu-O samples. Unfortunately, going into the latter part of the month, the pace of testing was evaporating our liquid helium at a faster-than-usual rate. With both the university purchasing office as well as government offices[34] closed for the holidays, we were unable to place an order for another tank.[35] As the last of our liquid helium evaporated, the minimum temperatures achieved in the last tests began to rise. With the school break, Wu decided that we should take a road trip to Houston to continue our testing. Chu will subsequently describe the trip as akin to going to receive our marching orders, something that could have been well-accomplished by phone. Liquid helium, on the other hand, is not so easily transferred by wire.\n\nAt the end of a 750-mile drive, testing resumed in Houston on the 29th of December (UAH Lab Notebook page 14) with emphasis, for the time being, on La-Sr-Cu-O samples under high pressures. I personally found the high pressure testing fruitless, but this had always been Chu’s interest and one that he had quite thoroughly imparted to Wu.\n\nEarly January 1987\n\nForty-two tests were conducted in Houston on test samples or lead (Pb) references through the early morning hours of January 3rd (UAH Lab Notebook pages 14-18). Later that evening, we headed back, staying overnight in a Motel 6 on I-10 in Louisiana before finally arriving in Huntsville on January 4th.\n\nIt would be January 9th before a new tank of liquid helium would arrive. A couple of days were spent processing existing data files and working with Daniel to make a crude ball mill for mixing and grinding samples. Concurrently, Daniel and fellow student Tony Xidis[36] worked with me to implement Daniel’s suggestion of using a coprecipitation method for fabricating the materials.[37][38] Meanwhile, Wu’s focus shifted towards a more in-depth study of the existing materials, especially the La-Sr-Cu-O system. His efforts would require the very best samples, which I hoped would play well into my desire to produce more uniform materials. Since our last few tests in Houston on a sample with less strontium, namely La1.8Sr0.2CuO4, had produced some of our sharper transitions, our attention shifted to materials with less of the alkali earth substitution for lanthanum, and with the slightly altered composition, calcium was revisited in a La1.8Ca0.2CuO4 sample.\n\nThe first samples recorded after returning to Huntsville were milled versions of these two compositions, labeled “finely ground” in our notebook (UAH Lab Notebook page 18).[39] The tests on January 7th were impatiently tested in liquid nitrogen while still awaiting the arrival of liquid helium, as good metallic behavior at the higher temperatures would still be indicative of a better quality sample. Several of the calcium tests on January 9th and 10th (including CA7, CA8, and CA9) subsequent to the arrival of the helium showed complete transitions centered around 20 K, while a sample of La1.8Mg0.2CuO4, made about the same time, was found to be insulating.[40]\n\nAt this point, the stage was set. Working up the alkali earth column on the periodic table had produced the following results:\n\nLa1.8Ba0.2CuO4, ~30 K superconductivity\n\nLa1.8Sr0.2CuO4, ~40 K superconductivity\n\nLa1.8Ca0.2CuO4, ~20 K superconductivity\n\nLa1.8Mg0.2CuO4, insulating\n\nA question then began to rattle around in my head concerning why the critical temperature peaked with strontium. It should be noted that many subsequent accounts out of Houston refer to frequent indications of “unstable” superconductivity as high as 70 K in samples containing barium. Thus, the barium compounds continued to be the focus of much of the Houston team’s work during this time. In contrast, we had seen no such indications, even in the Houston samples sent to us, and thus centered our attention on the strontium compounds, which showed the consistently highest transition temperatures.\n\nMy motivation for including these tedious details of the January activities is to counter many stories (several of which will be covered later in this narrative) that claim that the “direction” we supposedly received in Houston from Chu over the New Year’s holiday was to focus on yttrium materials. Together, Chu and Meng claim that the UAH strontium samples were of such “poor” quality[41] that Meng was tasked to take over the strontium work, but the UAH lab notebooks clearly show that the January focus continued to be on strontium compounds through at least the 23rd (UAH Lab Notebook page 24) while the Houston lab notes will indicate that the greater part of their effort continued with barium. It will be years after the discovery when I first learn that it is the Houston team who makes the first yttrium samples and, with them, the first yttrium failures.\n\nFollowing the 10 January results, the efforts over the next several weeks were intense, spawning several concurrent threads of activity. Thus, I must necessarily bounce around a bit as I try to weave in all of the relevant pieces and struggle to maintain a roughly chronological narrative.\n\nWith the second week of January, Wu began to spend increasing amounts of time at NASA’s Space Sciences Lab (about a six mile drive), especially in the labs of Frank Szofran (Hall effect) and Gretchen Perry (electron microscopy).[42] Based upon what records I could retrieve, Hall effect measurements were conducted on La-Sr-Cu-O samples[43] on January 7th, 8th, 12th, 13th, 19th, 20th, and 22nd.[44] Wu seemed to like the results obtained from the milled samples and used them for yet another series of high pressure measurements – 23 separate tests from January 11th through the 15th where my handwriting only briefly appears and then usually right before a test on a sample of interest to me (UAH Lab Notebook pages 20-22). Concurrent with both the Hall effect measurements and the latest series of high pressure measurements, Wu suggested that substitutions for the transition metal copper would represent a scientifically more significant finding,[45] thus beginning a series of La1.8Sr0.2CuO4 samples (UAH Lab Notebook pages 20-23) with the copper partially substituted with gallium (January 11th), aluminum (January 13th), silver (January 13th and 16th), and mercury (January 17th). To me, the choices seemed somewhat random, with emphasis often placed upon familiar elements. For example, much of our recent work had been with Ga-Bi and Al-In-Sn alloys.[46] Thus, gallium and aluminum topped the list. Silver shared the same column with copper, making it a marginally more logical choice (save its inability to form very stable oxides). A gold sample was similarly tried but stubbornly refused to oxidize, leaving visible gold particles within the matrix of the remaining material. The sample, which was deemed unworthy of testing, did strike me as sadly humorous at the time.\n\nThird Week of January 1987\n\nWe were making poor decisions from ignorance, and clearly some education would be useful before pushing ahead. While I was a bit slow coming to this recognition, the more knowledgeable reader may have long since recognized that we were neophytes in the area of crystal chemistry.[47] Incidentally, I will shortly cover Chu’s references to atomic radii as somehow relevant to these ionic compounds,[48] an error that earns him a spot among the tyros as well.\n\nDuring the prior fall quarter, I had taken my first solid state physics class, incidentally under Wu’s instruction. The text was Introduction of Solid State by Charles Kittel. Chapter 1 introduced elementary concepts of crystal structures, whereby atoms are modeled as simple hard spheres. Chapter 3 included a series of “periodic tables” with various properties of the elements – cohesive energies, melting points, bulk moduli, compressibilities, ionization energies, and then several pages later, atomic and ionic radii. It was this text to which I turned upon examining the curious trend in critical temperatures as the alkali earth elements were replaced in sequence. It seemed reasonable to me by mid-January to seek some property of those elements that demonstrated an extreme value with strontium. Unfortunately, the trends all appeared monotonic or irregular. With the last of the tables, though, I did notice something curious – from among the alkali earth metals, the ionic radius[49] of strontium (1.13 Angstroms) most closely matched that of lanthanum (1.15 Angstroms), for which it substituted. It seemed likely that the reason strontium samples produced the consistently highest critical temperatures was because, as it replaced the only slightly larger lanthanum, the degree to which it perturbed the crystal lattice was minimized. In short, it was the best fit.[50]\n\nCopy of the “Atomic and ionic radii” table from my textbook Charles Kittel. Introduction to Solid State Physics, Sixth Edition. New York: Wiley, 1986.\n\nI think it a good place here to address a couple of issues regarding the various “histories” of the discovery. It will be demonstrated soon that my ideas will take on a very important role in directing the compositions examined in Huntsville, and for a brief period immediately after the YBCO discovery, these ideas will even direct the compositions made in Houston. The final piece of evidence in support of this claim will actually come from the Houston lab notebooks, and with great precision. Of course, Chu’s claimed approach was fundamentally very different from mine. His numerous patent applications during the course of 1987 (beginning with his 12 January filing[51]) discuss at great lengths the idea of simulating the effect of pressure by “reducing interatomic distances” through substitutions of smaller atoms.[52] Chu never references the more applicable ionic radii (at least through the spring of 1987),[53] instead noting the largely irrelevant (although roughly correlated) atomic radii of the elements of interest.[54] He lists the atomic radius of barium as 2.22 Angstroms, strontium as 2.15 Angstroms, calcium as 1.97 Angstroms, and lanthanum as 1.87 Angstroms. Thus, he was unlikely to have ever made the matching-size observation I did given that with these values calcium, not strontium, is the better match to lanthanum. In any case, his argument seems to always be that smaller must be inherently better (as supposedly guided by his high pressure observations). Finally, given the very fundamental importance of atomic/ionic size in crystal chemistry, the idea that the Huntsville and Houston groups were independently giving these kinds of factors consideration should not be difficult to accept, especially since the specifics of the application were still very different.\n\nOver the course of the subsequent patent dispute, endless pages were devoted to debating the question of who among the Huntsville and Houston teams was the first to utter “yttrium.” I direct the reader’s attention to the list of “set-the-stage” compositions above as well as the table in the excerpts from Kittel’s textbook.[55] At this point in the story, it was known that combinations of lanthanum with strontium and, to a lesser degree, lanthanum with barium produced the consistently highest critical temperatures in the copper oxides. Note in the table from Kittel that lanthanum, barium, and strontium form four quadrants of a larger rectangle with yttrium being the fourth quadrant. Thus, I would suggest that the ridiculous dispute over who was the first to mouth “yttrium” is the functional equivalent of the same individuals, having taken a hypothetical group trip to the Four Corners Monument, foolishly arguing over who first had the idea of stepping on Colorado. Lastly, I must emphasize that ideas for new compositions were being thrown out at a brisk pace by virtually everyone in both labs, a pace far faster than samples could possibly be made or tested, and, as will be shown when I cover the Houston patent applications in greater detail, no one could best Paul Chu at throwing out compositions at a blistering rate.\n\nReturning to the core narrative, with the repeatedly disappointing results for the copper substitutions, combined with my now increased sensitivity to ionic radius, I waded in towards the end of Wu’s copper substitution series with one sample of my own to verify my suspicions that copper replacement would be an especially difficult path to higher critical temperatures. More carefully syncing valence and size to the copper, I had selected zinc (a firmly divalent choice with an ionic radius of 0.74 Angstroms very closely matching that of divalent copper). Fully expecting the partial substitution with zinc to destroy the superconductivity, the test on the 17th of January (UAH notebook page 23) confirmed my anticipation. The zinc, in fact, completely eliminated all metallic behavior, yielding a semiconducting resistivity curve trending ever upward with decreasing temperature.[56] This sample would mark the final attempt at copper alternatives and the motivation for another trip to the library.\n\nWith evidence mounting for the importance of carefully selecting elements with the appropriate valence and ionic radius, I refocused my attention on substitutions of the other metals. My dissertation, defended in November of 1990, describes the next steps:\n\nOf course, the first step was to try substituting stable divalent cations of the appropriate size in order to test the postulate. Because partial replacements of copper in (La,Sr)2CuO4-y with various nonmagnetic ions had already shown mercury to be among the least detrimental to the superconductivity (17 January), it was assumed that the relatively large Hg2+ ion (radius 1.10 Å) was actually occupying the lanthanum and strontium sites. However, given the low decomposition temperature of mercuric oxide (500 °C) and the extremely high vapor pressure of the metal above that temperature, the possibility that no mercury would remain in the samples after reaction was acknowledged. Nevertheless, considering its ionic size and stable divalent state, it was reluctantly chosen as the only element that could potentially rival strontium.[57]\n\nIt should be noted that from the ionic radius table from Kittel, mercury would seem to easily represent the best combination of valence and size to strontium. The actual test results on the ensuing mercury sample and their important role in the discovery will be revisited when I come to that point in the timeline.\n\nThe La1.8Ae0.2CuO4 (Ae=an alkali earth element) samples that had been the focus of our work were known somewhat interchangeably at that time as the “K2NiF4” or “double-perovskite” phases, in reference to their crystal structure. This provided me one key word, “perovskite,” as the basis for my library search. The first text of note that I found was entitled Structure, Properties, and Preparation of Perovskite-type Compounds.[58] Since naturally-occurring minerals with the perovskite structure are relatively common, I was also inevitably directed towards books on mineralogy. One in particular bore the title Mineralogy: Concepts, Descriptions, Determinations, and just inside its front cover was a simple chart of ionic radius vs. ionic charge for various elements (and furthermore showing La3+ and Sr2+ as having the same radius – probably part of the reason the table caught my eye).\n\nCopy of the ionic radius chart from L. G. Berry, B. Mason. Mineralogy: Concepts, Descriptions, Determinations. San Francisco/London: W. H. Freeman and Company, 1959.\n\nShortly thereafter I created my own hand-drawn version that became a convenient tool in the formulation of candidate superconductors.[59] Galasso’s perovskite book, however, was easily the most critical piece of the puzzle, in particular this line:\n\nThe largest group of complex perovskite type compounds has the general formula A(B’0.5B”0.5)O3. When the structure of the compounds is ordered, and most of them are, they adopt the structure shown in Fig. 2.5. It was postulated by Galasso et al. that an ordered distribution of the B ions is most probable when a large difference existed in either their charges or ionic radii.[60]\n\nThe statement refers to the smaller “B-site” in the crystal structure, but it seemed reasonable that the same principle could be easily applied to the larger “A-site.” With this, I seemed to have found a solution to the problem of the alkali earth substituting for lanthanum in a disordered manner – instead of trying to match lanthanum’s size perfectly, force an ordered distribution by replacing lanthanum and/or strontium with suitable substitutes having a larger size difference, thereby coercing an ordered distribution. Galasso’s book described how, to preserve the packing critical to sustaining the basic structure, the relative radii of the metal ions had to fall within certain constraints, or, in the case of a mix of metals in a given site in the crystal lattice, the weighted average of the radius had to fall within a particular range. My dissertation describes my conclusions this way:\n\nTwo constraints on the selection were assumed necessary. First, the average valence of the A ions should remain between 2.5+ and 3+ and preferably close to 2.9+ as with (Lao.9Sr0.1)2CuO4-y in order to preserve the mixed valency of the copper essential for conductivity. Second, in light of the extreme sensitivity of perovskites to the ionic sizes of their component ions, the weighted average volume of the A ions (or simply radius cubed, r3 = 1.51 Å3 in the case of the A’ = Sr2+, x = 0.1 compound) should be preserved in order to support and preserve the structure. The arguments for average volume as the appropriate constraint will be given elsewhere.[61]\n\nGiven the passage of twenty-five years, it is perhaps time to finally explain why average volume was chosen over average radius.[62] Beginning by noting the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the La1.8Ae0.2CuO4 (Ae=an alkali earth element) materials, I envisioned a single CuO2 plane from the structure and equal amounts of two different large metal ions (i.e., A’1.0A’’1.0CuO2). Now, instead of layers of A ions above and below the plane as in the actual structure, I simplified the problem to two dimensions by dropping one set into the plane.\n\nMy original derivation was lost, but I have included below a reconstruction done in the course of the YBCO patent battle. The circles along the edges represent oxygen ions, whose radius I neglected (in hindsight, a serious omission given that they are relatively large). The smallest circles on the vertices represent copper. Assuming the copper-to-oxygen bond length to be a constant length represented by the script letter “l,” one can derive a relationship suggesting that the sum of the squares of the radii of A’ and A” be held constant. I then simply presumed this result to extrapolate to a weighted sum in the event the relative amounts of A’ and A” differ from one-to-one and then to weighted volumes in the case of a three-dimensional problem. It should be noted here that as Wu was only vaguely familiar with the details of my efforts, it is at least remotely possible that my attempt at maintaining a constant copper-oxygen bond length overlaid with Chu’s subsequent attribution of the discovery to insights gained from high pressure measurements led Wu to morph Chu’s “reduced interatomic spacing” into the compromise term “optimal interatomic distance,”[63] thus crudely capturing the essence of both reality and Chu’s fantasy in a single phrase.[64] Note that in Wu's descriptions, “optimal interatomic distances” somehow pointed to a specific composition of elements with specific ratios, namely one with a relatively high (x=0.4) concentration of very large (Ba2+) ions. Chu's subsequent accounts of the discovery will only make the “somehow” ever more confusing. This work, on the other hand, will clarify the “somehow” in excruciating detail.\n\nReconstruction of derivation towards preservation of Cu-O bond length.\n\nMy dissertation again describes the next steps. I apologize for the lengthy quote but it would be difficult for me to describe the process now any better than when I first drafted this so many years ago:\n\nSince the sources consulted implied that even the largest quadravalent cations (e.g., Ti4+, Zr4+, and Pb4+) exclusively occupy the smaller B site in perovskites (as in the former high-Tc record holder for perovskites – Ba(Pb,Bi)O3) and later tests on January 18 and 19 suggested that the monovalent alkali metal ions Na+ and K+ (with sizes similar to Ca2+ and Ba2+, respectively) could not successfully substitute for strontium in (La,Sr)2CuO4-y, the possibility of increasing the difference in valence was eventually ruled out. Restricted to divalent and trivalent cations, all of the constraints could not be met concurrently. Since preservation of the structure was given highest priority, the precedence was assigned beginning with average volume, followed by average valence, and finally a near one-to-one ratio.\n\nBecause La3+ is the largest stable trivalent cation, a combination of a smaller trivalent cation and a larger divalent cation was the only alternative. Since partial substitutions of copper with the smaller nonmagnetic ions of Ga3+ (11 January) and Al3+ (13 January) had already been found to suppress superconductivity in the (La,Sr)2CuO4‑y compound, the size of the Cu3+ ion was assumed to represent an extreme lower bound on the size of the A ions. Thus, La3+ yielded to the smaller Y3+ ion (radius 0.93 Å) while the large Ba2+ ion (radius 1.35 Å) regained its position over Sr2+. Other possible trivalent cations were considered less promising because of unstable or high vapor pressure oxide forms, unpredictable valence states, large magnetic moments, and so forth, and some have since been proven suitable, or even superior, substitutes for yttrium, including thallium, bismuth, and most of the rare earth elements. The uncommon occurrence of perovskites with Y3+ as the exclusive A ion suggested that materials too close to the composition Y2CuO4 were unlikely to be isostructural with the La2CuO4 compound. Binary oxides containing yttrium and a smaller metal ion tend to prefer structures such as spinels or garnets over perovskite or perovskite-like structures.\n\nRestricted to an average ionic volume of the A ions dictated by (La0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4‑y and adjusting x in (Y1-xBax)2CuO4-y to match it, the composition (Y0.575Ba0.425)2CuO4-y was calculated and found to have a low but tolerable average valence of 2.575+ and a near one-to-one ratio of yttrium and barium. Since the composition approached the limit of the ability of the anticipated structure to maintain its stoichiometry through the formation of oxygen vacancies and trivalent copper and an ordered distribution of yttrium and barium ions would necessarily incorporate them in a ratio of small integers, the composition was later, and rather subjectively, rounded to the 3:2 ratio of (Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO4-y. Little consideration was given to the possible exact nature of the ordering and its implications for the crystal symmetry.[65]\n\nThus, some time on the weekend of the 17th and 18th of January, the composition (Y0.575Ba0.425)2CuO4, or equivalently Y1.15Ba0.85CuO4, appeared in my undated scratch notes alongside La1.8Hg0.2CuO4. That weekend proved to be an especially convenient time for me as, being one week before the Super Bowl, it represented the first weekend of the year without a meaningful [American] football game (the Senior bowl does not count).[66]\n\nMy undated scratch notes from the weekend of 17-18 January 1987.\n\nIt is perhaps a good time to use my scratch notes here to point out that the oxygen ratio was frequently omitted in our shorthand for the candidate compositions. Technically, the chemistry convention is that an omitted subscript implies a one, but in the case of these mixed-valence materials, the precise oxygen concentration in the processed samples was an unknown, a function of the processing conditions, and irrelevant to weighing out appropriate amounts of the starting materials (which could be oxides, carbonates, or even hydroxides of the appropriate metals). (Unfortunately, the patent court would ultimately interpret the frequently-omitted subscripts as implied ones and, ignoring a decade of arguments made by both sides in the case, decide against UAH based upon a point never raised by either party – that we made, quite impossibly via heating in air or pure oxygen, some kind of bizarre (Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO1 “sub-oxide.”[67][68])\n\nUp to this point in our work with the copper oxides, we had been able to locate every reagent of interest from somewhere within the UAH Science Building, usually the stockrooms that supplied the teaching labs. My pocket calendar will note on January 9th, for example, “Check P. Chem. & Guy Smith’s labs.”[69][70] Unfortunately, yttrium proved not so easily located. At this point, I consulted friend Daniel Shultz again. One must know Daniel to fully appreciate his energetic and contagious enthusiasm, but with my inquiry about where to best locate yttrium, his ceramic engineering background activated, and he began a lengthy and excited description of the amazing properties of yttria-stabilized zirconia, finally culminating with the suggestion that a ceramist would almost certainly possess some yttrium oxide. I knew of only one, Ed Ethridge at NASA’s Space Sciences Lab, the same building to which Wu was still making frequent trips in support of his more detailed studies of (La0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4. Friend and fellow student Jones Hamilton,[71] who frequented our lab to follow the latest developments, waded in about that time. I shared with him some of the cursory details of my ideas which, when combined with his independent fascination with the element yttrium, led him to quickly became the element’s biggest advocate.[72] Some years later, I asked him to compile his recollections, which he did and subsequently provided in a handwritten letter.[73]\n\nConsistent with Jones’ recollection, I asked Wu at least twice before his trips to NASA’s Space Sciences Lab to try to get some yttrium oxide from Ed Ethridge. On perhaps the second trip (probably on or about the 23rd of January), he returned with a supply of 99.99% pure yttrium oxide bagged inside a quart size “paint can” that appeared to have never been opened.\n\nI very recently contacted Ed Ethridge via LinkedIn to ask him of his recollections. Here is his response:\n\nLinkedIn Message from Ed Ethridge to Jim Ashburn, 29 July 2015.\n\nCombining Ethridge’s specific recollection of a Thursday with my estimate of January 23rd allows me to refine the date the yttrium oxide was acquired to Thursday, January 22nd. As will be shown shortly, the rest of his timeline is early by one week, but his days of the week (for processing, testing, the trip to Houston) are relatively accurate. In any case, he notes a very short timeline between the request for yttrium oxide and the discovery, inconsistent with Robert Hazen’s account (to be covered in detail later) and difficult to reconcile with the Houston story of Huntsville being tagged with the “yttrium task” in early January because we would be able to quickly obtain yttrium oxide from NASA.\n\nHaving recently followed up with Ethridge in the wake of the above message, I found that he had, in fact, located the old yttrium oxide container. We arranged to meet at Wilson Hall (the former UAH Science Building) where I posed for a picture with the can in exchange for a close-up of it.\n\nCan of Yttrium Oxide borrowed from Ed Ethridge, NASA Space Sciences Lab.\n\nGiven the story the Houston team will (in the course of my narrative) put forth to the USPTO of a YBCO discovery in Houston independent of the Huntsville team, it seems odd that Ethridge would have kept a reagent container for over 29 years now if he did not have every reason to believe it significant (reasons probably firmly entrenched in his mind well before the various myths and legends began to take root), but that analysis will be an exercise ultimately left to the reader. If there is any doubt concerning the age of the can, I would note that Consolidated Astronautics, by my best estimation, ceased to exist (at least under that name) around 1993.\n\nJumping ahead briefly to 2006, Ruling Meng (in her “perjury” affidavit – linked later when I cover it in detail) will claim to have been the one who suggested “NASA” as a source for yttrium oxide during our New Year’s trip to Houston. One can only imagine how she knew that upon our return to Huntsville we would be unable to locate yttrium oxide in the various stockrooms and labs we routinely checked within the UAH Science Building, places where we had successfully, up to that point, found every other reagent we had sought. Furthermore, suggesting we try “NASA” would not be particularly helpful given that, at least as of April 2008, Marshall Space Flight Center had 7000 government employees and 170 buildings on about 1800 acres (presumably all of these numbers were substantially higher during the peak years of the Space Shuttle program). I have recently been inquiring of several NASA personnel about the possible existence of a chemistry stockroom at the Marshall Space Flight Center. So far, I have found no one with any knowledge that there is or ever was a dedicated chemistry stockroom or its functional equivalent at the center.\n\nIt seems far more plausible to me that Ruling later read of the yttrium oxide search in the May 1987 U. S. News & World Report article[74] and subsequently convinced herself that she had prompted Wu. Not coincidentally, that article, in the same paragraph, mentions both the yttrium oxide coming from NASA and happens to quote me (I was rarely interviewed for national publications as those reporters typically contacted only Houston). I do not specifically recall speaking with that particular author, but I have no doubt that I was the one who related the story of searching for and obtaining the yttrium oxide. It was a significant event in my mind because so many friends assisted my search.\n\nIncidentally, just prior to the above, the article provides a bit of levity in describing the supposed key moment that yttrium was targeted (my emphases):\n\nEarly in January, he [Chu] and his partners hunkered down over old data and worked their way through the periodic table. Finally they got to yttrium [aka Colorado].\n\nIn the course of my prior discussions with Daniel on yttrium oxide, he pressed upon me some information that gave me pause in cracking the newly-received can by describing the critical importance to a ceramist of preserving the purity of his chemicals. I had never before worked with a material of such high purity and was quite honestly fearful of contaminating it. Thus, the can of yttrium oxide sat on the shelf for about five days as I turned my attention to more samples made with the student-grade materials, namely (La0.9Hg0.1)2CuO4.\n\nThrough the month of January, the different handwriting in the lab notebook offers a good indication of the relative interest between Wu and myself in what had become, at least for now, mostly parallel efforts. By Monday, January 19th, Wu’s handwriting[75] had all but disappeared from our notebook, appearing only once on January 23rd (UAH Lab Notebook page 24) with a test marked “Hall Effect Sample” that even includes a sketch of the leads attached in the arrangement used for such testing.\n\nLate in the writing of this narrative, I tracked down an email (dated 23 November 2011) that I had received from Daniel having asked him to document any recollections he had from the weeks leading up to the YBCO discovery. While the email does spoil a bit of the story, this point otherwise seems as good as any to interject it.\n\nEmail from Daniel Shultz recounting his memories of the events leading up to the YBCO Discovery.\n\nThere are several items of note. First, Daniel describes our coprecipitation and ball-milling work to “insure stoichiometric mixing of the components” and that those efforts extended into January. Second, he mentions our discussions about crystal structures and what he describes as “impurity effects,” in this context referring to the alkali earths that substitute in the La2-xAexCuO4-y materials. Third, he mentions my “hand-drawn table of element sizes and volumetric proportions,” referring to my chart of ionic radii and my corresponding “volumetric” considerations, and that the table had led me to believe that I could actually make yttrium work. Finally, it is a bit interesting that there is no mention of Wu (much less Chu) in his email. Granted, Daniel, by virtue of our longtime friendship, is not likely to be counted among the least biased of witnesses, so I will simply leave it to the reader to assess his credibility.[76]\n\nFinal Week of January 1987\n\nI took a break Super Bowl weekend, and if Wu came into the lab over those days, he apparently did no resistivity or susceptibility testing. By the following Monday, the mercury sample was ready for testing and became a pivotal event in the moments leading up to the YBCO discovery. Again, from my dissertation:\n\nYttrium oxide was finally obtained on Friday, 23 January just as the first (La1‑xHgx)2CuO4-y sample was being made. After 24 hours at 995 °C in air, it was removed from the furnace and tested the following Monday with some encouraging results – a stable, reproducible resistance drop around 38 K (just as anticipated based upon the similar ionic sizes of Hg2+ and Sr2+), apparent evidence that at least some mercury had indeed been retained in the material. From 26 to 28 January, transitions were detected in all seven tests on four different samples (two with x=0.075 and two with x=0.125) with onsets ranging from 37.0 to 39.5 K. The importance of ionic size and its connection with Tc seemed certain.\n\nJanuary 26, 1987 test results on La1.8Hg0.2CuO4.\n\nThe transitions in the mercury samples were partial, but the temperatures were precisely as expected.[77] My dissertation continues with the story:\n\n…on 28 January, motivated by the latest [mercury] results, yttrium oxide, barium carbonate, and copper oxide were mixed in the appropriate amounts to make (Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO4-y, thoroughly ground in a mortar and pestle, pressed into pellets, and placed in a furnace in air at 996±2°C for 24 hours, the same conditions previously used for most of the (La,A’)2CuO4-y materials.[78]\n\nThe tests on the mercury materials seem to have gotten Wu’s attention, but, as was his nature, he preferred a more systematic approach. Thus, when the container of yttrium oxide was finally opened, he asked that I make a sample of Y1.8Sr0.2CuO4, a straight substitution of lanthanum with yttrium in the then consistently highest-Tc superconductor La1.8Sr0.2CuO4. I did not express it at the time, but there were two reasons I was opposed to even trying Wu’s composition. First, I knew that there would be too many small ions to support a crystal structure even remotely like that of the (La,A’)2CuO4 materials. Second, other groups would have almost certainly tried such a straight substitution anyway.[79] Incidentally, the YBCO samples that will mark the discovery have long since disappeared (despite my many efforts to locate them[80]), but I do happen to still possess the container with Wu’s failed Y1.8Sr0.2CuO4 material.\n\nY1.8Sr0.2CuO4 sample container from UAH lab.\n\nAt the last second, I chose to slightly alter my original YBCO formulation. My dissertation states, “Since… an ordered distribution of yttrium and barium ions would necessarily incorporate them in a ratio of small integers, the composition was later, and rather subjectively, rounded to the 3:2 ratio of (Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO4 [equivalently, Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4].” That precise composition, which would very soon become the basis for the paper announcing superconductivity in YBCO, appears in this copy of my scratch notes.\n\nMy scratch notes page (undated) showing the first appearance of the Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4 composition.\n\nWhile I made Wu’s Y1.8Sr0.2CuO4 sample, I asked C. J. to make my Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4 sample. Both went into the furnace together. The next day, C. J. called in sick (and was unfortunately not present for the discovery). Upon removal from the furnace, Wu’s Y1.8Sr0.2CuO4 sample was found to be a favorable black-to-dark-gray color. A quick test with an ohmmeter showed it to be insulating. Thus, it was not tested. The Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4 sample, on the other hand, was a discouraging greenish color. My dissertation describes the events that followed this way:\n\n…the pellets [of YBCO] were… found to consist of black particles embedded in a green matrix. Despite the overall greenish color, they were not insulating. A small bar was cut, fitted with platinum leads, and lowered into a liquid helium dewar for testing… Just below 90 K, the resistivity began to drop rapidly, reaching zero (i.e., below the detectability threshold of the apparatus) near 50 K.\n\nThe results of that first test are shown here.\n\nResults from first test on Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4 from the afternoon of January 29, 1987.\n\nMy dissertation continues:\n\nFearing the possibility of false temperature readings, the same piece was quickly retested in liquid nitrogen, again with an onset near 90 K. As another batch went into the furnace, a second piece from the original batch was tested with similar results. Tests on samples from the second and third batches, impatiently removed from the furnace after two and four hours, respectively, were found to have even higher and sharper transitions. In all, eight tests on four samples from three separate batches were performed that day. All showed transitions with onsets ranging upwards from 89 K and averaging 93 K and midpoints nearing 93 K.\n\nThe resistivity of sample #3 (one of the better samples) is shown here.\n\nSome of the better results from January 29, 1987.\n\nSometime over the course of the afternoon, two other events of note occurred. I cannot speak with certainty to the order in which they occurred.\n\nFirst (not necessarily chronologically), Wu contacted Houston to tell Chu what we had observed. Chu will later record that the call occurred sometime around 5 p.m., and I would suggest that this is probably correct. It is my understanding that Wu first spoke with Pei-Herng Hor (one of Chu’s graduate students), but in addition to my hearing only one-half of the conversation, it was mostly in Chinese.[81] Sometime later that evening, perhaps after a second phone call with Chu, Wu decided we would go to Houston for the more definitive magnetic measurements.\n\nNote that Wu was convinced that without those measurements, it would be impossible (especially for UAH) to push a paper through a sufficiently reputable journal. I also recall during that general period expressions of concern (real or imagined, and by specifically whom, I do not recall) about referees holding up papers and leaking information to “competitors.”[82][83] Incidentally, Chu, who would become the de facto spokesperson for the effort, would demand and be granted a single referee for the paper. I will later discuss additional measures he would take to protect the details of the YBCO composition.\n\nSecond (again, not necessarily chronologically), Wu met with the chairman of the UAH Physics Department, Graeme Duthie.[84] I only learned of the details later through Duthie, who stated that, upon learning of the very loose and informal relationship between the Huntsville and Houston groups, he had urged that Wu and I go to the University of Oslo to perform the additional measurements. I can only presume that Duthie had friends there. Whatever the case, Wu decided that his former advisor Chu was the person most willing and best able to protect us from the mystical processes by which scientists so often lose credit for their discoveries.\n\nOn the morning of January 30th, samples in hand, we boarded a plane for Houston. Incidentally, we took the borrowed yttrium oxide (assuming Houston to have none; after all, we had no more knowledge of what they had been making than they of us), and I specifically recall being a bit nervous about the idea of having to explain to airport security why I was carrying a tightly sealed container of hundreds of grams of fine white powder.\n\nThe reader may note in the UAH lab notebooks that the tests on 29 January record the composition Yb1.2Ba0.8CuOy instead of Y1.2Ba0.8CuOy. “Yb” represents the element ytterbium, not yttrium. This regrettable move occurred because shortly after the press conference that would take place in Huntsville some weeks later I caught one of the reporters nosing through our lab notebook. I panicked (given that the composition was being kept secret until the paper was published) and inserted a “b” into the conveniently large space near the heavily slanting “Y.” I never imagined at that point that a patent interference would ensue between Houston and UAH and that the lab notebook would become necessary evidence. At the time, I naively believed that once the paper was published with the Huntsville team listed first, the claim would be secure. While the change in the Huntsville notebook was entirely my (very foolish) decision, a “Yb-for-Y” alteration was decidedly not my original idea. I will simply offer the documentation here in support of that assertion, direct attention to the relevant parts, and leave it for interpretation.\n\nThe first item is a page from Ruling Meng’s notebook.[85]\n\nFirst page from Meng’s Exhibit H as submitted in the patent interference.\n\nNote first the date of “29-30 January 1987” on the leading page. The correct date for this page is 30 January 1987, the date of my arrival with Wu in Houston; the “29-” is a later “edit,” as Meng does not routinely allow space after the day number to insert something akin to “-30” in the event the activities of the page span multiple days. In any case, Wu and I will be present in Houston at the time the contents of this page are penned. Now note the last composition on the first page and the first composition on the second page. A small “b” has been clearly inserted next to the Y, even though the metals and raw material weights indicate yttrium. This narrative will return shortly to these pages as they also include the most compelling evidence in support of my account of the YBCO discovery.\n\nThe second item is a galley proof retrieved from microfilm at least twelve years after the discovery.\n\nGalley proof of originally submitted version of the joint UAH/UH paper. Incidentally, Chu was the corresponding author. From Physical Review Letters.\n\nNote that three times (title, abstract, and body), “Yb” occurs where subsequently “Y” will appear in the final published version. I have very specific recollections of how this series of “typographical errors” came to be, but I will defer to Science Magazine’s Gina Kolata and her smartly entitled article to explore the potential causes.[86] Concerning the “effects” of such “typographical errors,” I have included here several copies of preprint requests received at UAH over the subsequent weeks.\n\nPreprint requests received by UAH during the weeks subsequent to the discovery.\n\nThe reader who is somewhat familiar with the more prominent versions of this story that have appeared over the years may conclude that my story, being so very different, could simply be a clever fabrication built largely upon an “average ionic volume” coincidence, discovered after the fact, between La1.8Sr0.2CuO4 and Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4. I will now address those potential concerns using, ironically, the same pages from Meng’s notebook above.\n\nUpon our arrival in Houston, Wu and I described my ideas to Chu, showing him my ionic radius chart and explaining how I had selected a pair of metals whose ions were both larger (barium) and smaller (yttrium) than the lanthanum/strontium tandem and in proportions that would fill the same space in such a way that it might preserve the distance between the copper and oxygen atoms. He was apparently sufficiently intrigued that I was asked to attempt to formulate additional new compositions based upon my premises. Unfortunately, Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4 had been the last of my more promising ideas. Nevertheless, I made an effort (hardly my best), the results of which just so happen to appear in Ruling Meng’s lab notebook.\n\nReturning to the page above from Meng’s Exhibit H that displayed the “Yb error” reveals a series of compositions with curiously precise (three digits) ratios. Five appear on that page with the pattern:\n\n[La1-x(YyBa1-y)x]2CuO4\n\nI will be focusing on the first three; the fourth and fifth listed simply vary “x” without updating “y.” The raw material weights appear on the bottom of that page through the next two pages. The page stamped H53 includes one additional composition of interest (numbered “6”) following the formula:\n\n[La1-x(LuyBa1-y)x]2CuO4.\n\nAgain, additional compositions are listed that simply vary “x” without updating “y.”\n\nThe formulas reflect the hastily cobbled idea of substituting for strontium a pair of larger and smaller ions in (La0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4, the composition that had been the basis for the original (Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO4 formula. An almost identical idea was manifest earlier in samples of La1.8(Ba0.5Ca0.5)0.2CuO4 and La1.8(Na0.6K0.4)0.2CuO4 that I had tested on January 18th in Huntsville.[87]\n\nThe mapping of corresponding compositions by sample number is as follows:\n\nYB-104 → LYB-1 → LLB-1\n\nYB-105 → LYB-2 → *\n\nYB-103 → LYB-3 → *\n\nYB-102 → * → *\n\nYB-101 → * → *\n\nThe asterisks represent samples that, for whatever reasons, were never made. The corresponding compositions are:\n\n(Y0.2Ba0.8)2CuO4→[La0.9(Y0.155Ba0.845)0.1]2CuO4→[La0.9(Lu0.149Ba0.851]2CuO4\n\n(Y0.3Ba0.7)2CuO4→[La0.9(Y0.26Ba0.74)0.1]2CuO4→ *\n\n(Y0.4Ba0.6)2CuO4→[La0.9(Y0.378Ba0.622)0.1]2CuO4→ *\n\n(Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO4→ * → *\n\n(Y0.8Ba0.2)2CuO4→ * → *\n\nPrior to the appearance of the four rightmost compositions (and not coincidentally, prior to our arrival in Houston), non-integers appearing in the sample formulas in Houston generally come in pairs such that the fractional substitution of the divalent element (most commonly barium or strontium) for the trivalent element (typically lanthanum) is usually drawn from the set of simple decimal fractions {0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, or 0.025} and, in any case, is never specified to more than two significant digits.\n\nThus, numbers like 0.155, 0.845, 0.26, 0.74, 0.378, 0.622, 0.149, and 0.851 are completely outside of the patterns that preceded them. Not coincidentally, upon our departure from Houston late on January 31st, the earlier rules quickly resume.\n\nThe mapping process for the above compositions is relatively simple and is basically identical to what I outlined in my dissertation – simply adjust the relative amounts of the non-copper metals until their average ionic volume is preserved. Doing the yttrium case first, the equations are as follows (canceling the 4/3 π factor from the sphere volume formula):\n\nx RY3 + (1-x) RBa3 = 0.9 RLa3 + 0.1 [y RY3 + (1-y) RBa3].\n\nBefore proceeding with the derivation, I will point out a couple of symbols and numbers that appeared along the margin of one of my scratch notes pages:[88]\n\nY .8044\n\nBa 2.4604\n\nWhile the symbols are cut off, the numbers are clearly visible in the copy of this page as it appeared in the August 1988 Science article entitled “Superconductor Credits Bypass Alabama.”[89] Thus, these numbers were in place at least two years before the first copies of Houston lab notebook become available for review by the Huntsville party in the course of the ensuing patent interference. If one looks up the ionic radii values for yttrium and barium from Kittel’s aforementioned table (numbers noted previously in my dissertation excerpts) and cubes those numbers, the results are:\n\nYttrium: 0.804357\n\nBarium: 2.460375.\n\nThese figures, when rounded to four digits right of the decimal, perfectly match those of my notes. Similarly, my other linked scratch notes page[90] includes “weighted volume” formulas down the right margin as part of what is much of the derivation of the YBCO formula. A copy of this page appeared in the Winter 1988 edition of UAH Magazine,[91] again well before copies of the Houston lab notes became available to the Huntsville party. A reconstruction of the equations as they appear is as follows. To match the ionic volume of the Y/Ba combination in Y2-xBaxCuO4 to that of the La/Sr combination in La1.8Sr0.2CuO4 (as described in my dissertation), the following quantities must be equated (again, dropping the 4/3 π):\n\n1.8 RLa3 + 0.2 RSr3 and\n\n( 2 – x ) RY3 + x RBa3\n\nA normalized version of this equality will appear in the continued derivation of the “Meng numbers” below. Plugging into the first expression the ionic radii from Kittel yields the first equation appearing in my scratch notes,\n\n1.8 * 1.153 + 0.2 * 1.133 = 3.026\n\nSetting the second quantity equal to this result yields the second equation appearing in my scratch notes,\n\n( 2 – x ) * R3 + x * r3 = 3.026\n\nwhere “R” represents the yttrium radius and “r” the radius of barium. Solving for x yields the next equation in my scratch notes (written here on one line),\n\nx = ( 3.026 - 2 R3 ) / ( r3 - R3 )\n\nPlugging in the ionic radii of yttrium and barium from Kittel yields the final equation,\n\nx(Y,Ba) = 1.4173 / 1.6560 = 0.856,\n\nmy initial estimate for the barium substitution, later truncated to 0.8 for the reasons described previously.\n\nResuming the reconstruction of the numbers in Meng’s notes, in retrospect (circa 1994), I discovered that I accidentally transposed the weights (the 0.1 and 0.9 figures above)[92] to yield the following equation,\n\nx RY3 + (1-x) RBa3 = 0.1 RLa3 + 0.9 [y RY3 + (1-y) RBa3].\n\nRecreating this error is critical to reproducing the specific compositions.\n\nAt this point, I apparently had noticed a shortcut that would greatly simplify the final equation. As described in my dissertation, the origin of the (Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO4 composition was linked to preserving the average ionic volume among the larger metal ions in (La0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4. Using this fact along with the nearly identical radii of La3+ and Sr2+ and the relatively small quantity of strontium,[93] I made the approximation,\n\nRLa3 ≈ 0.9 RLa3 + 0.1 RSr3 ≈ 0.6 RY3 + 0.4 RBa3.\n\nMaking the appropriate substitution in the above equation yields,\n\nx RY3 + (1-x) RBa3 = 0.1 [0.6 RY3 + 0.4 RBa3] + 0.9 [y RY3 + (1-y) RBa3].\n\nMaking the following substitutions,\n\nx = 0.6 + (x - 0.6)\n\n1-x = 0.4 - (x - 0.6)\n\ny = 0.6 + (y - 0.6)\n\n1-y = 0.4 - (y - 0.6)\n\nallows one to cancel several terms on both sides, leaving\n\n(x - 0.6) (RY3 - RBa3) = 0.9 (y - 0.6) (RY3 - RBa3).\n\nCanceling RY3 - RBa3 on both sides and solving for y yields the very simple equation\n\ny = [x - 0.6 (0.1)] / 0.9.\n\nNote that the only non-unity numbers which appear in the final result are the 0.9 and 0.1 figures from the (La0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4 composition and the 0.6 figure from the (Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO4 composition.\n\nInserting the values for x from samples YB-104, YB-105, and YB-103 (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively) yields,\n\nx=0.2 → y=0.15555..., 1-y=0.84444…\n\nx=0.3 → y=0.26666..., 1-y=0.73333…\n\nx=0.4 → y=0.37777..., 1-y=0.62222…\n\nNote that the values correspond almost exactly to those of the LYB series samples listed above. The variation in round-off and truncation may have been due to using a borrowed non-RPN calculator (I did not take my HP-15C and am clumsy with the parentheses buttons) and recording rounded results of the intermediate calculations on paper between steps. Note also that when 0.6, one of the critical numbers in the (Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO4 composition, is inserted, it reproduces itself, pointing to that composition as the focal point of the other compositions.\n\nThe shortcut mentioned above was only useful for the LYB series, but a shortcut for the LLB series can be derived from the LYB series results. Equating the Y-Ba and Lu-Ba average ionic volumes,\n\ny RY3 + (1-y) RBa3 = y’ RLu3 + (1-y’) RBa3.\n\nBecause the “R3” terms cannot be cancelled as before, the actual ionic radii must be utilized. Solving for y’ yields,\n\ny’ = [(RY3 - RBa3) / (RLu3 - RBa3)] y.\n\nI did not take the textbook I had used in my solid state physics class (the original source utilized for ionic radii mentioned in my dissertation) to Houston, but this was irrelevant since it gave no standard radius for Lu (see image from Kittel above). Since I do not recall the precise source I would have used at this point, for purposes of the analysis, I will use the ionic radii from a widely available, familiar, and likely source that happens to include a radius for Lu3+, the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. Drawing on my vintage 60th edition (1979-1980)[94] yields the following where, for self-consistency, the CRC values for the yttrium and barium radii are also employed (repeating digits indicated by underline):\n\ny’ = [(0.8933 - 1.343) / (0.8583 - 1.343)] 0.155 = 0.148499,\n\na very near miss for rounding to 0.149.[95]\n\nIt should be noted that within the Meng notebook these samples are the very first after the initial discovery where raw material weights are formulated. Thus, they were presumably the first samples made after the initial YBCO discovery. In fact, by all indications they were made even before attempts in Houston to reproduce the YBCO materials made in Huntsville.\n\nSummarizing the numbers in Meng’s notebooks alongside my reconstruction yields\n\n0.155, 0.845 vs. 0.155, 0.844\n\n0.26, 0.74 vs. 0.26, 0.73\n\n0.378, 0.622 vs. 0.377, 0.622\n\n0.149, 0.851 vs. 0.148499, 0.851501\n\nWith these figures as a reference, I would encourage the reader to compare the precision of my account with the remarkable imprecision of the other YBCO discovery stories examined in the pages ahead.\n\nMore recently (2020), I came upon a copy of one of the interrogatories from the Hor vs. Chu case (more on that later). While it is unsigned, it includes Chu’s answer to a question about the origins of the compositions discussed above. As I have provided a painfully detailed derivation of the numbers using equations specifically related to the origins of the YBCO superconductor (all during precisely the same time period), Chu’s \"explains\" that the precision of the numbers is \"likely the result of using a calculator to determine the required ratio of a particular element\" (page 5).[96] This would be analogous to being asked how one determines the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of unit length to be approximately 1.414 and responding, \"With a calculator.\" The correct answer, obviously, is Pythagorean’s Theorem. Of course, Chu had no option but to completely dodge the question with a cheeky[97] response because he does not have and has never had any specific knowledge of the true answer in the first place.\n\nI do not recall the test results on these samples except that there was nothing of note. The point of these laborious derivations is simply that my story is firmly anchored to three significant digits multiple times over to compositions appearing in a Houston lab notebook. In addition, these compositions were clearly given very high priority in Houston in the frantic window between the 90 K discovery in Huntsville and the subsequent submission of the corresponding paper one week later. Any credible account of the discovery should reasonably be able to explain the existence and derivation of these compositions and should furthermore explain why the Houston team was, at least for a brief time, actually taking its direction, not from its soon-to-be “superstar-in-residence,”[98] but instead from a 22-year-old student from a small public university in north Alabama. Incidentally, at my request, Chu was questioned about the origin of these samples during the ongoing Hor-Chu case (to be covered in detail in a later section dedicated to it). I have reason to believe his answer appears in his second interrogatory, but I am still (as of this writing) attempting to locate the document in the online archives. I can safely maintain that the answers will be found intriguing.\n\nI will also mention here that very late in the writing of this manuscript, I came across a test among Meng’s notes that I had previously dismissed as being on a sample of yttrium-barium-copper-oxide. I have linked the test results here.[99] I had rejected as stray the leading mark in the sample identifier (reading it as YB-3) until I realized that there was no sample by that moniker. Thus, it seemed likely that the mark is indeed the letter “L” and the identifier is actually for LYB-3, one of the three-digit precise samples that I had formulated.[100] Note that the date of the test on LYB-3 is 30 January, the same as the test on the sample identified as “Wu’s #2” (the first test we ran on one of the samples from Huntsville – to be introduced later) and the page number (H810) of LYB-3 indicates that it was at least tested prior to “Wu’s #2” (H807), noting that the “H” numbers on the test results (assigned in the original patent interference case) are consistently in reverse chronological order.[101] My recollection is that several of my “three digit precise” compositions were actually tested before the first of the 90 K superconductors we had brought from Huntsville (consistent with the order in which they appear in Meng’s notes). At a later point in this narrative, I will provide information on how the reader might obtain copies of more of these test results (a process in which I am involved as of this writing).\n\nIf, on the other hand, one concludes that my tedious derivations and their otherwise coincidental relationship with the critical YBCO composition are simply a clever fabrication, then one must believe that within hours of the discovery, I concocted a plan whereby I would somehow coax the Houston team to make compositions other than that of the newly discovered “Holy Grail of Physics.”[102] Then, a year later, I convinced Robert Pool of Science Magazine of my role in the discovery, getting him to publish my scratch notes where I slyly added the cubed radii of yttrium and barium. At about the same time, I work additional scratch notes into the UAH Magazine. All of this, obviously, so that I could finally draw attention to them almost three decades later in this 200 page rant falsely claiming to have invented the first liquid nitrogen-cooled superconductor.[103]\n\nOf course, Houston attorney Scott Chafin would be counted among those disputing my claim. In the ironically entitled article “Wu? Chu? Or Who?”[104] he was quoted as saying, “Dr. Chu suggested which materials and systems to research and test.” Given that everyone involved was making innumerable “suggestions,” this was, no doubt, literally true. The more pertinent question would ask whose suggestions were actually being “researched and tested” and, moreover, whose were successful. On the topic of irrelevant assertions, I would add Chafin’s continuation, “Wu might not have been involved in superconductors if he hadn’t been a student of Dr. Chu’s.” Obviously this, by extension, also applies to me, but since I really do not know where to start a discussion of how this supports Chu’s claim to YBCO, the analysis is left as an exercise for the reader.\n\nMoving on with the story, the magnetic tests in Houston confirmed superconductivity at 90 K and a draft paper was assembled, largely by Chu.[105] In it, Chu cleverly transformed my attempt to preserve the Cu-O bond length into some kind of connection with his high pressure studies,[106] suggesting that the discovery was the result of an explicit decision to “investigate… multi-phase… compounds instead of the pure K2NiF4 phase.” In contrast, I have clearly demonstrated that the intent of (Y0.6Ba0.4)2CuO4 was to preserve the K2NiF4 structure, not replace it.[107] Of course, given the visible mix of green and black materials in the samples and “preliminary X-ray powder diffraction patterns” (second page of the original paper) already indicating the absence of any K2NiF4 structure, it was too easy for Chu to suggest that multiple phases and a potentially new crystal structure had been the intent.[108] For the reader unfamiliar with the concept of multi-phase materials, the footnote here[109] should be reviewed.\n\nMy timid protestations to Wu about the claimed pressure connection went unheeded as the joint publication listing the Huntsville group first was submitted, appearing in Physical Review Letters in early March.[110] The aforementioned “Yb typo” would be included (per the image of the galley proof above) but corrected before going to print.\n\nFebruary 1987\n\nThe narrative now transitions to points subsequent to the discovery, but before I get into some of the more substantial parts of the post-discovery period, this seems a convenient time for a side trip through one lesser facet of the story. It may be of interest to the reader as it is one prominent point where pure serendipity played a very significant role. Most subsequent accounts simply avoided this issue, perhaps because any emphasis on serendipity might have been counter to achieving other objectives. Nevertheless, it is a part of the chain of critical events and, in my opinion, is worthy of preservation.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our work in the Huntsville lab had previously focused on metal alloys with low melting points. Thus, upon beginning our work with the copper oxide superconductors, we had relied on the previously-mentioned borrowed furnace, one whose analog controller simply displayed a maximum of three digits, that is, 999 °C. Thus, when the first YBCO sample went into the furnace, the temperature was actually about 100 to 150 °C below the widely preferred processing temperatures for the lanthanum-based materials that had been the focus of the superconductor community for weeks. We simply managed with the lower temperatures, although previously-mentioned fellow student Jason Kinser would occasionally allow us the use of his hotter furnace. It was only later found that the pure-phase YBCO superconductor melts incongruently around 1025 °C. For the Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4 composition formulated and made first in Huntsville, incongruent melting would have been unfavorable.[111] Thus, the low furnace temperature (a limitation the Houston lab records suggest was not a constraint there) was quite simply a matter of blind luck.\n\nA widely-held misconception by many of the groups working in the field was that the discovery was partly the result of a less favorable initial composition combined with overheating and incongruent melting, thus yielding samples with traces of the superconducting phase that were eventually isolated through a sequence of trial and error (consider Robert Hazen’s book to be covered in great detail in Part II). Interestingly, one such version of the story was related by James Gleick in an article from the summer of 1987:[112]\n\nDictated by Chu’s sense of atomic size; they mixed in the element yttrium for I.B.M.’s lanthanum. At first, the composition was all wrong. The furnace temperature had to be changed. But on January 29th…\n\nTo my knowledge, this is the only account that attempts to explain (erroneously) how the lower furnace temperature for YBCO came about. Incidentally, I do not know what a “sense of atomic size” is beyond the act of simply consulting a table of such values. As described previously with regard to Chu’s patent applications, he was not prone to use the more relevant numbers.\n\nOn the subject of the Houston patent applications, this is perhaps a suitable point in the narrative to cover the beginnings of the ensuing patent battle. Shortly after the discovery, both Huntsville and Houston independently filed patent applications. Some of what I report here regarding the applications is hearsay based upon knowledge conveyed to me later by UAH faculty and staff. However, in most cases, the information was corroborated by multiple individuals.\n\nI was told that representatives of UAH, including one or more attorneys on retainer with the university,[113] caught up with Wu in Washington (convenient since that was where the law firm was located) sometime in mid-February. Apparently, Wu indicated that Chu had already filed an application on 12 January (mentioned previously) that covered the Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4 composition and that he (Wu) would somehow be made a part of the Houston claim (search for dollar signs later in this manuscript). Wu reluctantly yields to the authority of the university, a brief description of the invention is obtained, and a sketchy application is filed. However, it trails the 6 February Houston application by days, and, by virtue of the timing, UAH becomes the junior party in the patent interference to follow, putting the school at a decided disadvantage.\n\nThere is nothing of great significance in the UAH application. It attempts to patent a single combination of elements – yttrium, barium, copper, and oxygen, specifies a range of ratios, notes the now lower preferred processing temperature, and initially lists but a single inventor – M. K. Wu.\n\nThe Houston applications, beginning with 12 January,[114] take a somewhat different tack, listing the following (my emphases):\n\n[L1-xMx]aAbOy\n\nwherein L is an element selected from the group consisting of lanthanum, lutetium and yttrium, or a mixture of one or more of these elements;\n\nwherein A is an element selected from the group consisting of copper, bismuth, titanium, tungsten, zirconium, tantalum, niobium, and vanadium or a mixture of one or more of these elements;\n\nwherein M is an element selected from the group consisting of barium, strontium, calcium and magnesium or a mixture of one or more of these elements;\n\nwherein x is a number in the range of about 0.075 to about 0.5,\n\na is a number in the range of 1 and 2,\n\nb is 1, and\n\ny is about 2 to about 4.\n\nGiven some knowledge of the history of oxide superconductors[115] combined with the fact that elements in a periodic table group tend to be chemically similar, it is not particularly difficult for one to discern most of the “rationale” behind the list of candidate elements.\n\nThe application goes on to describe that by replacing barium the “interatomic distances” are reduced (not preserved as had been my objective). The described processing actually includes quenching in an inert atmosphere, now known to be very unfavorable for the formation of almost all superconducting copper oxides.[116] The application then reiterates the importance of “reducing interatomic distances,” citing the previously-noted (and irrelevant in these ionic compounds) atomic radii of the various elements.\n\nIt is instructive here to consider how many combinations of elements are covered (a number that will increase substantially in subsequent applications). Excluding from each “mixture of one or more elements” the “null mixture” and considering that there are three L elements, eight A elements, and four M elements yields\n\n(23-1) × (28-1) × (24-1) = 7 × 255 × 15 = 26,775\n\ndifferent combination of elements, before considering the specific ratios or details of processing.[117] Chu will later mention in Robert Pool’s Science article from August of 1988[118] both his January 12th application along with reference to a “carefully planned substitution program.” I would presume that the patent application is at least somewhat reflective of that program.\n\nFor the sake of argument, however, assume that all single replacements (as opposed to “mixtures of one or more”) will be exclusively explored first in Houston, bringing the list down to 3 × 8 × 4 or a very manageable 56. In this way, one could conceivably arrive quickly at the composition responsible for the YBCO discovery (assuming the necessary ratios to somehow be known).\n\nI must forewarn the reader here that the next several pages are an excellent example of how each aspect of this ensuing story leads one into yet another and another. I will eventually return to the main line of the narrative, but keep in mind that here in the chapter covering the first month after the discovery is the point in time that the situation begins to quickly degrade and a purely chronological analysis becomes all but impossible.\n\nWe now turn to a more complete set of pages from Ruling Meng’s notebook.[119] The page stamped H476 shows what appears to be a short-lived series of samples exploring some “new” elements and at least roughly, briefly, and very incompletely paralleling the “carefully planned substitution program” presumed to be outlined by the 12 January patent application, including:\n\nCL-1 and CL-2, (La0.9Ca0.1)2CuO4\n\nCeS-1, (Ce0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4\n\nCeS-2, (Ce0.85Sr0.15)2CuO4\n\nCeB-1, (Ce0.9Ba0.1)2CuO4\n\nCeB-2, (Ce0.85Ba0.15)2CuO4\n\nML-1, (La0.9Mg0.1)2CuO4\n\nPL-1, (La0.9Pb0.1)2CuO4\n\nYS-1, (Y0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4\n\nYB-1, (Y0.9Ba0.1)2CuO4\n\nLuB-1, (Lu0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4\n\nLuS-1, (Lu0.9Ba0.1)2CuO4\n\nThe dates for these compositions can be narrowed to between the 7th of January (see the first column in the table on page H476) and the 18th of January (top of page H479). A second set of documentation from Meng[120] will show the raw material weights for some of these compositions being calculated on the 12th (starting on page H17) and 13th (starting on page H47) of January.\n\nOf the eleven compositions listed above, only six actually follow the patent application formulas (cerium and lead are outside the scope), only the cerium samples appear to explore more than one set of ratios, and the fractional substitution of the second (divalent or potentially divalent) element for the first (trivalent or potentially trivalent) element never exceeds 15%. Furthermore, the preferred processing temperature for these samples is indicated as 1100 °C in air. Keep these conditions in mind as sample YB-1 is examined in more detail below.\n\nThe simple calcium substitution (CL-1 and CL-2) yields a superconducting transition between 30 and 16 K, below that of its barium and strontium analogs (note columns on the right of page stamped H476). A few more calcium samples will be tested later (see bottom of page stamped H479). Otherwise, after this short run in quite partial fulfillment of the “carefully planned substitution program,” work appears to refocus on the La-Sr-Cu-O and La-Ba-Cu-O materials (see the page stamped H477). The early deviation from the “plan” is hardly unexpected, as even the least competent of scientists is likely to refine his path with each new sample and test or else be faced with exploring thousands if not millions or billions of combinations at a pace of perhaps a half dozen per day.\n\nOf course, of greatest interest here are the samples containing yttrium. The first, (Y0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4 (sample YS-1), is incidentally precisely the composition Wu will insist we try in Huntsville scarcely two weeks later.[121] Note that it is representative of the entire series where simple straight elemental substitutions (i.e., no or only minor adjustments to the ratios) are made for components in (La0.9Sr0.1)2CuO4 or (La0.9Ba0.1)2CuO4 (well-established as baseline compositions by then by producing consistently narrow transitions in the 30-40 K range) and using the same maximum processing temperature (1100 °C) preferred for those reference materials.\n\nThe second material, (Y0.9Ba0.1)2CuO4 (sample YB-1) hits the right combination of elements but is off-target on two counts. First, given what is, in hindsight, now known about the Y-Ba-Cu-O system, the barium substitution for yttrium (10%) is far too low to yield a material that would contain at equilibrium any portion of the 90 K superconducting phase. Second, again given what is now known, the processing temperature of 1100 °C is uncomfortably above the incongruent melting point of the 90 K superconducting phase (about 1025 °C) and the preferred processing temperature of no higher than about 950 °C. Thus, the elemental ratios combined with the high processing temperature would almost certainly have failed to produce a superconductor and would have been unlikely to yield even metallic behavior. In fact, this is precisely what is indicated in Meng’s notebook. Note the column on page H476 headed by the Greek letter “rho,” a symb"
