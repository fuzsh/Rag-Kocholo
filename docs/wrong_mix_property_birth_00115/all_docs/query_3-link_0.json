        "text": "A Comprehensive Review and Analysis of the Dean Martin Show holiday haul gathered by Time-Life from the archives of NBC\n\no\n\nBABY, IT‘S COLD OUTSIDE…But with a tray full of hot toddies poured from TV’s best variety show ever (see below), You’ve Got Dean To Keep You Warm.\n\no\n\nAs those who’ve been following recent events know, in the Northeastern U.S., the weather outside’s been frightful (actually, horrific might be a more apt description). But for those seeking pleasurable diversion, there’s a lot about the new Dean Martin Show releases that’s so delightful.\n\nJust last month, one of the star’s lesser-known Westerns, Something Big, gained new life on DVD. Now, with the approach of the December holidays, the elves in the Time-Life section of Santa’s workshop are bringing Dinophiles something even bigger.\n\nMonday, October 30, saw the unveiling of The Best of Of The Dean Martin Variety Show: Dean’s Ultimate Collection, loaded with 17 discs holding all of the material that made up the first three DMS sets from Time-Life: 1) The Best Of The Dean Martin Variety Show (June 2011); 2) King of Cool (November 2011); and 3) The Dean Martin Variety Show UNCUT (May 2012).\n\nBut the true standout items in this new package are:\n\n1) a first-time-on-home-video Christmas episode from the series’ 1968-69 season;\n\n2) a bonus DVD, containing three DMS episodes, that was heretofore available only with the King of Cool sets sold by Costco; and\n\n3) a condensed softcover version of the hardbound photo book previously introduced in 2011 with the Dean Martin: Cool Then, Cool Now CD compilation.\n\nThose who’ve already purchased the first three Dean Martin Show collections from Time-Life and who want only the 1968 Christmas episode can buy the latter separately; it was released as a standalone disc on November 6.\n\nUnfortunately, we’ve learned that T-L has no plans at this time to issue that King of Cool bonus disc by itself; so for now at least, the only way for diehard Dean devotees to get their hands on it is either to try to obtain it through Costco’s King of Cool collection, or bite the bullet and buy the Ultimate Collection — a decidedly pricey and prodigal option for those who already own the three DMS sets that comprise the bulk of the new 17-disc compendium. We hope that Time-Life will eventually make that bonus DVD available on its own for those of the company’s loyal customers who’ve already invested a substantial amount in the earlier Dean Martin Show treasuries.\n\nAs to what’s worthwhile about the musical content featured on that bonus disc, as well as on the 12/19/68 Christmas episode and the rest of the programs that constitute Dean’s Ultimate Collection, we offer the following detailed overview:\n\nHave Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\n\nMany were hoping that this would be the year that would finally witness the DVD debut of the 1967 Dean Martin Show episode known as “Christmas with The Martins and The Sinatras”. But with rights to that particular holiday favorite unattainable at present, the yuletide celebration from the series’ very next season proves to be a welcome and fulfilling stand-in, with plenty of charm of its own.\n\nJOY TO THE WORLD: Following a decorative opening sequence, Dean moves the party along with his customary yuletide icebreaker, “Marshmallow World”, assisted by the kind of Santa’s helpers one would anticipate meeting on his set — including familiar Dean’s Girl Jeri Jamerson (above left).\n\nIn a departure from the series’ normal routine, the festivities kick off not with Dean singing or doing a monologue, but with a rather elaborate production number one would more likely expect to see on the Jackie Gleason or Andy Williams shows than on Dean’s. Nevertheless, our host dives right into the spirit of the occasion — albeit with an arched eyebrow and a sense of bemusement — and plays a good sport as he allows himself to be made up as St. Nick, before yielding the stage to a panoply of dancing Santas, with backing vocals by Jack Halloran‘s choir.\n\nAnd leave it to the program’s resident music-master, Lee Hale, to tap his encyclopedic knowledge of the pop canon in coming up with a less-than-commonplace, yet still catchy ditty for the opening set piece — “Be A Santa”, plucked from an even-then mostly-forgotten 1961 Broadway musical called Subways Are For Sleeping, which, despite its short run (205 performances), boasted a pedigreed score (music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green) and cast (among others, Orson Bean, Carol Lawrence and Phyllis Newman).\n\nIn fact, from a musical standpoint, the ’68 Christmas show delivers quite a few satisfying moments, including performances by Dean and The Golddiggers (both apart and together), Dennis Weaver, and the entire cast offering a selection of traditional carols.\n\nJINGLE BELLES:Nice but never naughty, the winter ensemble of the 1968 Golddiggers treats viewers to a comfy rendition of “Santa Claus Is Coming To Town” (above), before snuggling up with Santa Baby (below) for the sort of sparkling medley that fans adore (and that we hope the generous Santas who package these DVDs will see fit to shower us with more of in the coming year — hint hint).\n\no\n\nPictured below, huddled around Dean (l. to r.) Front row: Deborah McFarland, Debbie Thomason, Susan Lund, Lynn Steiner; Second row: Brenda Powell, Kathy Brimer, Kathy Wright, Peggy Hansen; Top row: Diana Liekhus, Lezlie Dalton, Pamela Beth, Nancy Bonetti\n\no\n\nAn interesting footnote to this DVD reissue can be found at the end of the program, wherein a dizzying array of cameos by celebrities announcing charitable Christmas gifts for children includes several appearances that were clearly recorded during the 1970-71 season — two years after the ’68 Christmas episode first aired! To those who might wonder how this could be possible, the answer is supplied courtesy of Dean Martin historian John Chintala, who informs us that because Christmas Eve fell on a Thursday in 1970, the ’68 Christmas show was rerun that night, two years after its initial telecast, with several new cameos inserted. Thus, it’s obviously the tape of that rebroadcast, rather than the original ’68 airing, that’s been used as the master for this DVD release.\n\nTHE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY: Dennis Weaver elicits smiles not only from the show’s cast and crew, but their children, as well, as he captures the attention of the lads and lassies, joining their parents in attendance, with an offbeat holiday entry penned by singer-songwriter Tom Paxton — the folksy “My Favorite Toy”. (visible in the background, l. to r.: Dean’s Girls Diana Lee and Kate Kahn, and The Golddiggers’ Pamela Beth)\n\nThe one lump of coal in this otherwise jolly Christmas stocking is the excision of Dean’s couch number, “I’ll Be Home For Christmas”. Evidently, either the rights to the song couldn’t be secured at all, or else were simply too expensive to fit within the given budget. But if money was indeed the primary issue, we can’t help but wonder whether most prospective purchasers would have been willing to pay a little more in exchange for the chance to see their man croon that missing holiday tune.\n\nDespite its absence, the remaining bill of fare served up by the ’68 Christmas show is still a feast. And compared to the famine that we Dean Martin Show fans endured for so long, every morsel doled out to us is a gift to treasure, no matter what time of year it arrives.\n\nO COME ALL YE FAITHFUL: The episode’s cast gathers ’round the tree for a finale of traditional Christmas carols.\n\nAs we’ve done with past DMS release from Time-Life, we herein present a list of the musical numbers from the 1968 Christmas show, denoting which ones were included on DVD. Since none have been previously reissued, the Guthy-Renker column in this instance remains blank.\n\nORIGINAL AIR DATE: 12/19/68 Time-Life Guthy-Renker Opening Production Number, sung by Jack Halloran’s Choir & featuring Dean Martin, Dom DeLuise, Bob Newhart, Dennis Weaver, Dean’s Girls & dancers dressed as Santa Claus: “Look At That Face”; “Be A Santa” Disc 1 Dean Martin: “A Marshmallow World” Disc 1 The Golddiggers: “Santa Claus Is Coming To Town” Disc 1 Dean Martin & The Golddiggers: Medley: “Daddy” / “True Love” / “We Wish You The Merriest” Disc 1 Dean & Ken at The Piano Disc 1 Dean Martin: “I’ll Be Home For Christmas” Dennis Weaver: “The Marvelous Toy” Disc 1 Entire Cast: Medley of Christmas Carols: “Deck The Halls” / “Joy To The World” / “Silent Night” Disc 1 Dean Martin: “Christmas Is For Kids” (sung over footage of Christmas toys) Disc 1 Entire Cast: “We Wish You A Merry Christmas” Disc 1\n\nThe Second Time Around\n\nHaving already reviewed and devoted considerable coverage to the first and third Dean Martin Show sets from Time-Life, we wanted to focus here on the sophomore collection — King of Cool — since we did not survey it in-depth at the time of its original release, and because its presence in the new Ultimate Collection boxed set includes that hard-to-come-by bonus disc, once marketed exclusively through Costco stores.\n\nBefore assessing King of Cool, we’d like to remind our readers that a complete review and rundown of the musical content from Time-Life’s first DMS set — The Best Of The Dean Martin Variety Show — can be found by clicking HERE.\n\nAnd for a complete review and rundown of the musical content from Time-Life’s third DMS set — The Dean Martin Variety Show UNCUT — click HERE.\n\nRETURN TO ME: The just-released 17-disc Dean’s Ultimate Collection bundles all three previous Dean Martin Show sets from Time-Life — including an enhanced King of Cool collection containing a 7th bonus DVD, until now available only through Costco stores.\n\nAlthough it was The Golddiggers Super Site that broke the news of which episodes would be incorporated in Time-Life’s follow-up to its first Dean Martin Show collection, there were several reasons why we skipped reviewing the King of Cool package upon its initial release. For one, the same type of frustrating deletions of musical numbers — especially Dean’s — that plagued the maiden iteration also detracted from the second one, so there seemed little point in rehashing all of the factors attendant to that problem. In addition, Time-Life itself adopted a much more low-key approach to releasing the second edition, minus all of the promotional hoopla that accompanied the first, perhaps mindful of the severe criticism that greeted the heavy-handed edits of that initial effort.\n\nThe company redeemed itself substantially with the third set of Uncut episodes, and continues to make progress with the largely-intact ’68 Christmas Show. But with the King of Cool compilation now stepping up to the plate for another at-bat, via the Ultimate Collection, we thought it deserved a closer look.\n\nAs we indicated, most of Dean’s solo performances have been cut. Surviving are just a handful of his opening numbers and mid-show ballads, with two of the latter, as fate would have it, turning up on the bonus disc. The dearth of those couch songs is not only disheartening to fans, but something of a posthumous affront to the star of the show, given Lee Hale’s past acknowledgement that the couch song was the one number in each episode that Dean himself would pick.\n\nAs with the first T-L collection, the second one places a strong reliance on episodes with public domain tunes, in order to sidestep the often exorbitant costs of clearing copyrighted music for reuse on DVD. And of course, there’s no end to the exasperation caused by watching the credits at the end of each show roll over quick glimpses of segments chopped out of the abridged DVDs.\n\nThat said, we feel it important to re-emphasize that in the wake of vociferously negative reaction to the first two DMS collections, the folks at Time-Life, NBCUniversal and The Dean Martin Family Trust, to their great credit, have since gone a long way toward addressing and remedying these earlier shortcomings in subsequent releases.\n\nMoreover, lest we leave the impression that the King of Cool set doesn’t possess enough entertainment value to justify its cost (whether by itself or as part of Dean’s Ultimate Collection), we want to stress that the package’s 21 episodes on 7 discs have a great deal to recommend them, not the least of which are some 128 musical numbers — a sizable percentage of which have never been released before on DVD, and in fact, haven’t been seen anywhere since they were originally telecast decades ago.\n\nAmong the highlights:\n\nBIDIN’ MY TIME: The 1930 Gershwin classic is taken for a ride, both literally and comically speaking, in this Kerouacian update, driven by Dean and guest Shirley Jones (above) on Disc 2; but those who might be inclined to take the song’s title to heart, bypassing King of Cool in favor of waiting for what may lie ahead, would be leaving some priceless moments behind in the rear-view mirror.\n\no\n\nCRAZY RHYTHM: Barbara Eden (above) streams out of the genie’s bottle and back in time to the roaring ’20s for an energetic song-and-dance number, followed by a medley of flapper-fueled favorites with Dean (Disc 2, below).\n\no\n\no\n\nA COUPLE OF SWELLS: (above) Dapper Dean and beautiful Barbara McNair lend a high tone to “Bummin’ Around” (Disc 1).\n\no\n\nMOONLIGHT SERENADE: Dean and Edie Adams duet on “By The Light Of The Silvery Moon” (Disc 1).\n\no\n\nIT MUST BE HER: Vikki Carr lays it on the line with “If I Were Your Woman” (above), before joining Dean to declare that “Rainbows Are Back In Style” (Disc 2, below); and in an earlier episode from 1966 on Bonus Disc 7, she and Dean exchange glances on “Them There Eyes” (further below).\n\no\n\no\n\nROCK THE BOAT: The Dingaling Sisters sail “On The Good Ship Lollipop” (Disc 1) in a way that Shirley Temple probably never contemplated, but with a cargo full of talent and enough motion to stir even the calmest ocean (above, l. to r.: Lynne Latham, Tara Leigh, Taffy Jones, Michelle DellaFave).\n\no\n\nREMINISCING: (above) On the last episode of The Dean Martin Show’s freshman season, guest Liberace joins the program’s host for a musical retrospective of the year gone by (Disc 1).\n\no\n\nFEELS LIKE THE FIRST TIME: On Volume 4 of Guthy-Renker’s Dean Martin Show anthology, Greg Garrison mentions that it was not until the final episode of the series’ first season that Dean actually sang his signature theme, “Everybody Loves Somebody”, all the way through. However, the clip shown in conjunction with that observation is, in fact, taken not from the last episode of the first season, but from the final show of the second season. But on the Season One finale featured on Disc 1 of Time-Life’s King of Cool set, we get to see the authentic footage of the first time that Dean (above, with Ken Lane) sang “Everybody Loves Somebody” in its entirety on his show — a tradition that continued for the next five seasons of his series’ run.\n\no\n\nNOW IS THE HOUR: Kate Smith offers dramatic renditions of a pair of tunes from the late ’60s (above); teams with Dean for a medley of school-related songs (below); and brings down the house at the show’s end with her trademark delivery of “God Bless America” — all on the 3/20/69 episode contained on Disc 2.\n\no\n\no\n\nTALKIN’ (OR, MORE ACCURATELY, SINGIN’) BASEBALL: Root, root, root for the home team, which in this final inning of the March 30, 1967 ball game, fields (above, l. to r.) Eddie Fisher, Dean, Abbe Lane and Gene Barry (Disc 3). Earlier in the same stadium, Abbe strikes a more elegant pose on her version of the Edith Piaf classic “Milord” (below).\n\no\n\no\n\nDANDY: Dean was certainly no fan of rock ‘n roll, but a mellow ditty like Herman’s Hermits’ “There’s A Kind Of Hush” (Disc 3) could find a soft, comfortable spot within the show’s milieu.\n\no\n\nMAS QUE NADA: Well-known to regular DMS viewers, but also with a huge international following of her own, Caterina Valente, born in Paris of Italian heritage and capable of singing in 6 different languages, brings the cool swing and gentle sway of Brazilian bossa nova to the 12/15/66 episode, first with “So Nice,” the vocal variation on Walter Wanderley’s 1966 hit instrumental “Summer Samba” (above); then with Dean on a cover of Antonio Carlos Jobim’s 1963 evergreen, “One Note Samba” (below) — all on Disc 3.\n\no\n\no\n\nMAKE ‘EM LAUGH: Funny? Sure. But as connoisseurs of dance know, Donald O’Connor’s showbiz strengths extended far beyond yuks, as he demonstrates with a serious display of terpsichorean skill (above), before settling in with Dean for some lighter musical moments (below) — all on Disc 3.\n\no\n\no\n\nWE CAN WORK IT OUT: Who but The Dean Martin Show’s Musical Director, Lee Hale, could blend a standard such as “Almost Like Being In Love” from the 1947 musical Brigadoon with the 1971 soft rock hit “Sooner or Later”, originated by The Grass Roots, and make it work in such smooth accord as an exuberant cross-generational medley for Dean and The Dingaling Sisters (above, l. to r.: Lynne Latham, Tara Leigh, Michelle DellaFave, Taffy Jones) to open the 10/28/71 episode, seen on Disc 4.\n\no\n\nMAMA SAID, THERE’LL BE DAYS LIKE THIS: Rather than one of their more recognizable hits, Diana Ross and The Supremes chose “Mother Dear” for their one and only solo performance on The Dean Martin Show, included on Disc 4.\n\no\n\nTEARS OF A CLOWN: (above) Only the hardest of souls would be able to keep from getting at least a little misty-eyed watching Dean cheer up a forlorn Imogene Coca with a heart-rending version of “When You’re Smiling” on the 3/24/66 episode (Disc 4).\n\no\n\nTHREE LITTLE SISTERS named Laverne, Patty, and Maxene Andrews (l. to r. above), whose vocals were closely associated with the boogie-woogie sound of popular music in the early 1940s, update their repertoire with a pair of high-energy hits from the ’60s on the 12/9/65 episode of The Dean Martin Show (Disc 5).\n\no\n\nPUT ON A HAPPY FACE: Carol Lawrence (above) delivers an impassioned solo on “Funny Face”, before affecting a friskier mien with Dean on “Baby Face” (below).\n\no\n\no\n\nCHANCES ARE that Johnny Mathis aficionados will love his rendition of “I’m In Love For The Very First Time” on Disc 5 (above).\n\no\n\nI‘M IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE: And in that vein, “I’ll Take Love,”proclaims Robert Goulet (above) on the 12/8/66 episode (Disc 6).\n\no\n\nTHE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT: Deana Martin makes her TV singing debut, as well as her first appearance on her father’s series, on the December 8, 1966 episode (Disc 6), with the two cozying up on “Side By Side” (above). She then returns on the 1/28/71 episode (also Disc 6), this time joined by two of her siblings, plus a flock of other celebrity offspring (below, l. to r., Front row: Desi Arnaz, Jr., Meredith MacRae, Dean Paul Martin, Billy Hinsche; Back row: Maureen Reagan, Frank Sinatra Jr., Deana Martin, Gail Martin, Lucie Arnaz).\n\no\n\nLater in the same program, Deana (above left) vies with Lucie Arnaz (right) for the affections of Frank Jr. (center), as they sit and sing “Side By Side By Side”.\n\no\n\nIn two other musical performances from the 1/28/71 episode, Dean Paul Martin (above right) jams with Dino, Desi & Billy bandmates Billy Hinsche (left) and Desi Arnaz Jr. (center) on “Lady Love”…\n\n…while Meredith MacRae, Gail Martin, and Maureen Reagan (l. to r. below) put their own delicious spin on the cheeky “Triplets” number made famous by Fred Astaire, Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan in the 1953 MGM musical The Band Wagon.\n\no\n\no\n\nBE A PERFECT SLEEPER: Joey Heatherton’s sultry romp through “Nice ‘N’ Easy” on Bonus Disc 7 (above) is not only a sensual treat in and of itself, but undoubtedly also provided her with invaluable preparation for her future role as spokeswoman for Serta mattresses.\n\no\n\nDO THAT TO ME ONE MORE TIME: Although they already made a splash on the Guthy-Renker volumes, segments with Ella Fitzgerald (above, Discs 1 & 5), Louis Armstrong (below, Disc 5) and Ginger Rogers (further below, Bonus Disc 7) are nonetheless engaging enough to appeal to both Dino debutants and those up for a second go-round.\n\no\n\no\n\nGETTING TO KNOW YOU: Long-time, sharp-eyed viewers of The Dean Martin Show will have fun recognizing some familiar names and faces popping up in unexpected places in the King of Cool collection. On the 5/5/66 episode, the man behind the music on Dean’s series, Lee Hale (above left), steps in front of the camera to play straight-faced foil to singer-comedienne Dorothy Loudon (above right) and her looney advances.\n\nMeanwhile, for Golds and Dings fans, a couple of early appearances by future Dingaling Sisters will surely ring a bell: Helen Funai, who was a dancer on Dean’s series during its first two seasons before returning as a Dingaling Sister in Season 8, can be seen in the two stills below from Disc 1, first with Vic Damone, and then with other members of Dean’s cleanup squad…\n\no\n\n…while Lynne Latham (below left) takes part in the kickline on the 10/16/69 program (Bonus Disc 7), two years prior to her initiation into the Dingaling sorority.\n\no\n\nAs was true of T-L’s first and third DMS collections, the second installment comes with well-documented liner notes, save for one error and one omission. Regarding the former: The lineup for the 3/24/66 episode, included on Disc 4, lists the instrumental played by Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass as being “Winds Of Barcelona”. In point of fact, the band did perform that song on the episode in question, but it’s cut from the DVD. What’s actually shown is the other number that the Brass did on that occasion: “Bittersweet Samba”.\n\nA TASTE OF HONEY flavors the 3/24/66 episode, as Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass blow away the crowd with “Bittersweet Samba” (Disc 4).\n\nAs for what’s missing from the liner notes, that turns out to be a most agreeable surprise — an Easter egg in the form of one-third of the “Welcome To My World” medley from the close of the 10/22/70 episode. The portion retained is of Dean and The Golddiggers harmonizing on “Look For The Silver Lining”, and it’s actually the tune’s second appearance in this collection; Dean also sings a solo version of it on the 3/3/67 episode. But while there’s no disputing that it’s a lovely composition, there should also be no doubt as to why it made it past the executioner’s axe twice: Having been published before 1923, it’s in the public domain.\n\nMAKE THE WORLD GO AWAY: It seemed as though that was the attitude toward the “Welcome To My World” medleys when the Guthy-Renker volumes were put together, as not a single one of the lush, beloved closing segments from The Dean Marin Show’s 6th season made it into those earlier DMS compilations. The first breakthrough on this front came with inclusion of at least a portion of the medley from the 10/22/70 episode on Disc 4 of the King of Cool set (surrounding Dean above, clockwise l. to r.: Melissa Stafford, Tara Leigh, Patricia Mickey); and as we’ve previously reported, the first full-length WTMW medley was presented in its entirety on Disc 3 of last spring’s Uncut collection; so we can only hope that more will follow.\n\nIn Your Easter Bonnet — Without All The Frills Upon It\n\nSHAKING THE BLUES AWAY: Nipsey Russell and The Dingaling Sisters (above, l. to r.: Helen Funai, Michelle DellaFave, Jayne Kennedy, Lindsay Bloom) shake up a storm as part of the 4/12/73 episode’s salute to the 1948 MGM musical Easter Parade on Disc 6. But nothing can shake the feeling that something’s missing on DVD from the way the segment was originally broadcast. And indeed, something essential IS missing — namely, clips from the film itself, which were so deftly interspersed with fresh takes on the material by The Dean Martin Show’s cast — the same format employed week in and week out for every MGM musical tribute at the close of each episode during the DMS’ 8th season.\n\no\n\nBelow: The full cast at the conclusion of the Easter Parade finale (l. to r., Front row: Dom DeLuise, Kay Medford, Dean, Nancy Sinatra, William Conrad, Nipsey Russell; Back row: Helen Funai, Michelle DellaFave, Jayne Kennedy, Lindsay Bloom).\n\nAs Lee Hale has noted, Irving Berlin loved Dean’s show and always granted it permission to use his songs — which likely accounts for the composer’s estate giving its okay to the reuse of his tunes from Easter Parade for the King of Cool collection. But considering the fact that the Guthy-Renker DVDs managed to include tributes from two other MGM musicals WITH clips from the films intact, why is there no footage from Easter Parade on this set?\n\nIts absence not only leaves yet another gaping hole in one of Dean’s shows on DVD, but fails to take advantage of what one would think could have been a mutually rewarding cross-promotional opportunity that’s as old as the shows themselves. Here’s what we mean:\n\nWhen the clips were originally used on Dean’s series, they were furnished by MGM in exchange for a promotional announcement at the end of each program, touting one of the studio’s new, upcoming theatrical releases. But even though it might not have been realized at the time, of far greater long-term value to MGM than a quick plug for its largely forgettable modern flicks was the hefty exposure being given to some of the finest gems in the company’s library, via The Dean Martin Show. Suddenly, millions of viewers too young to have seen the studio’s musicals when they were first issued were discovering them on prime-time network television — a process that yielded a whole new generation of admirers. In fact, it was this very showcase that helped spur a latter-day revival of interest in these vintage titles, culminating in the That’s Entertainment series of motion pictures, which celebrated the Lion’s golden age musicals on a grand scale and raked in fresh coin for cash-strapped MGM in the 1970s.\n\nToday, with technology that enables anyone who wants to buy and own those musicals to do so, a potentially even more synergistic opportunity exists for cross-promoting The Dean Martin Show’s salute to MGM Musicals with DVD and Blu-Ray releases of those films, the distribution rights to which are now held by Time Warner. So it’s hard to see why retention of clips from those movies in DMS releases wouldn’t represent smart marketing and a win-win for all parties concerned.\n\no\n\nGLOW LITTLE GLOW WORM, GLOW: In interviews, Dean, like many crooners of his generation, always cited Bing Crosby as his major professional influence. Yet in his commentary on the Guthy-Renker volumes, Greg Garrison recounts how Dean once told him that it was actually The Mills Brothers’ Harry Mills (above), more than Crosby, that shaped his own performing style.\n\no\n\nWhile both showbiz vets doubtless had a significant impact, lending some weight to the Mills side of the equation is a segment on the 10/16/69 episode, seen on Bonus Disc 7, in which Dean attests to how Harry Mills gave him some sage advice early on in his career, and goes on to provide living proof of it, with an on-stage recreation of his first gig with The Mills Brothers in his hometown of Steubenville, Ohio (below: Dean with Harry Mills; and further below: Dean is flanked by Herbert and Donald Mills on the left and Harry Mills on the right).\n\nFor those considering a purchase of the Ultimate Collection boxed set, King of Cool helps round out the package. And for those who might have passed on it when it first came out, Time-Life’s second DMS outing is definitely worth a second look.\n\nAt the same time, with fresh servings of The Dean Martin Show on DVD promised for the year ahead, we hope that the recent trend of offering fewer episodes at a time, each with more meat on its bones (i.e., more musical content), will continue. It’s a recipe that should keep both preparers and consumers of these precious, tasty delicacies well-sated long past the holidays and beyond.\n\nFinally, once again, we present a Sondheimian (that is, a side-by-side-by-side) comparison of the musical segments featured in the 21 King of Cool episodes, contrasting what was on their original NBC broadcasts with what’s contained on the Time-Life DVDs and with what can be gleaned from the now-discontinued Guthy-Renker volumes, all with the aim of helping Dean Martin fans understand not simply what’s been left out of both T-L and G-R’s disc reissues, but more importantly, how they can fill in some of the gaps in their own collections.\n\nORIGINAL AIR DATE: 5/5/66 (Last Show of the 1st Season) Time-Life Guthy-Renker Dean Martin: “That Old Clock On The Wall” Guy Marks: “Granada” (a comical version of the song, followed by a monologue) Disc 1 Liberace: “Clair de Lune” (piano recital) Disc 1 Dean & Liberace (in place of Ken Lane) at The Piano: Song Parodies Dean Martin: “The Last Time I Saw Paris” Liberace: “The Poor People Of Paris” (instrumental) Dean Martin & Liberace: “I Love Paris” Dean Martin, Liberace & Guy Marks: “Lovely To Look At” (comical version, sung as an introduction to comedienne Dorothy Loudon) Dorothy Loudon: Musical Comedy Segment in which she sings “Every Little Movement (Has A Meaning All Its Own)”, “If You Talk In Your Sleep Don’t Mention My Name” and “I Just Can’t Make My Eyes Behave” to a phalanx of tuxedoed gents that includes The Dean Martin Show’s Musical Director, Lee Hale, and Choral Director, Jack Halloran Disc 1 Dean Martin & Liberace: Medley that applies special lyrics to the melodies of several w.k. standards — “After The Ball” / “And The Band Played On” / “Pretty Baby” / “Hallelujah” / “Rigoletto” / “Makin’ Whoopee” / “Ain’t We Got Fun” — in reviewing the highlights of the first season of Dean’s series.

We’ll report further details as we receive them.\n\nNow, on to our comprehensive look at the most recently-issued set:\n\nJUST IN TIME: Before Time-Life’s new 3-DVD set came along, many fans who yearned for whole shows believed their time for hope was running low. They figured all was lost, the losing dice were tossed, their bridges all were crossed, and there was nowhere to go. But with the release of six unedited episodes on May 22nd, most feel that the suppliers of this product found their way, changing life for the better that lucky day.\n\nAfter Time-Life‘s release during the past year of two separate collections of episodes from The Dean Martin Show — episodes marked by substantial edits that left fans disappointed and discouraged — the company’s third entry in the franchise proves to be the charm: The Dean Martin Variety Show Uncut, is, unequivocally, a cut above.\n\nWhat a pleasure it is — indeed, it feels like a luxury — to be able to view the programs in their entirety, the way they were originally broadcast on NBC, without watching in dread of those wince-inducing deletions that marred and scarred the two earlier sets of T-L’s DMS DVDs. From the NBC peacock at the top of the show to the network’s trademark snake and chimes at the bottom, these half-dozen gems are the real deal.\n\nAIN’T SHE SWEET…Yet sublimely saucy, too. Abbe Lane, fourth wife of Cuban bandleader Xavier Cugat and a fiery chanteuse in her own right, brought her powerful pipes and seductive charms to Dean’s show a number of times during the early years of the series — in this instance (above and below), cooing “Whatever Lola Wants”, from the musical Damn Yankees, on Disc 1.\n\no\n\nVOLARE: The 3/3/66 episode, seen on Disc 1, soars above the standard pop canon, as it takes on a decidedly Italian flavor with two quintessential Neopolitan songs. First, American soprano Marguerite Piazza beckons the audience to “Come Back To Sorrento”, before joining Dean (above) on a vocal journey to “Santa Lucia”.\n\no\n\nPUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME, HONEY: And if Dean’s involved, he may well have both arms occupied, as he does in this humor-tinged medley of songs about “Dames”, seen on Disc 1.\n\nIt’s A Good Day\n\nAs we noted last March, when The Golddiggers Super Site broke the news of what material this newest edition would feature, the Uncut discs emphasize quality over quantity: Instead of the 18 to 20 condensed episodes that comprised the first two 6-DVD sets and proved less than satisfying, we are treated this time around to 6 unabridged shows, ensuring that every musical number seen in the original telecasts, including Dean’s, has remained intact in its home video reissue (save for one that had been irretrievably damaged over time — for specifics, see our rundown of musical highlights at the end of this article).\n\nThe 6 Uncut episodes, spread over 3 DVDs, span the first six years (1965-71) of The Dean Martin Show’s 9-year run, with one show each from Seasons 1, 2 and 6, and three from Season 3. As such, this installment (with the exception of the episode from the ’70-’71 season) leans heavily toward the series’ early years, reflecting fashions and styles more café society than swinging ’60s, music more standards-oriented than pop-inflected, comedy more broad vaudeville than sharp satire, guest stars more Old Hollywood than New Wave, and a host still dark-maned, trim, full of youthful energy and enthusiasm, and in great voice.o\n\nMAKE ‘EM LAUGH: Many of the comedy routines on older variety shows seem passé when compared to today’s more explicit material, but several of the acts on the new Uncut collection, including the one above fronted by the team of Marty Allen (center) and Steve Rossi (right), are so zany that they hold up surprisingly well.\n\no\n\nI GOT RHYTHM: Indeed, George Gershwin’s ”Fascinating Rhythm”, as interpreted by Leslie Uggams (above), with an assist from Jack Sperling on drums (below), makes for fascinating viewing on the 1/12/67 episode, seen on Disc 1.\n\nThough her own 1969 variety series on CBS failed to catch on, Leslie frequently turned up on other star’s programs during the ’60s, and her standout performance here shows why.\n\no\n\nOH, YOU BEAUTIFUL DOLL: Dean sings it to a toy doll on Disc 2 (above), and romps with some live ones (including a pre-Dingaling Helen Funai, third from left below) on Disc 1.\n\nWith superb musical selections and diverse, highly entertaining lineups, these 6 episodes are a representative sampling of the formative years of Dean’s series that serves as a showcase not just for the performers on screen, but also the gifted men and women who toiled behind the scenes — not the least among them, Producer-Director Greg Garrison, whose creative decisions always kept the action moving and displayed on-camera talent to its best advantage; and Musical Director Lee Hale, whose endlessly ingenious arrangements infused the show with rich, glorious melodies that helped lift it above every other variety program of its era.\n\nSTEPPIN’ OUT WITH MY BABY: Whether tapping with dancer Barbara Perry (above) or with Dean (below), Eddie Foy Jr., best known of The Seven Little Foys immortalized in the 1955 Bob Hope film of the same name, mixes humor with years of honed show business polish to enliven the 1/12/67 edition of Dean’s show.\n\no\n\nSHALL WE DANCE?: Few ever did it better than Cyd Charisse, as she demonstrates to the appropriate accompaniment of “Music To Watch Girls By” (above & below), before attempting to coax some steps out of Dean (further below), who demurs with “I Won’t Dance”.\n\nWho Could Ask For Anything More?\n\nReaction to the new Uncut anthology has thus far been overwhelmingly favorable — in stark contrast to numerous and vehement complaints leveled against the excisions of the first two T-L sets — but even this latest release has drawn a few minor criticisms. Although we feel that these gripes are trifling and largely unjustified, we deem it important to address them, lest they cause anyone to think twice about purchasing an item that we believe should be a must-buy for anyone who’s a devotee of Dean, or for that matter, anyone who appreciates compelling musical performances.\n\nSome who’ve reviewed the Uncut DVDs have questioned the choice of episodes, finding them dated or just not terribly engaging. Many, though by no means all, of those unimpressed with these particular shows admit to being of a younger generation that came of age after variety programs had mostly faded from prime-time TV schedules. Having been conditioned by the faster pace of fare such as music videos, it may be that these individuals can’t quite fathom the appeal of more leisurely-paced song-and-dance offerings.\n\nSOME ENCHANTED EVENING: Lovely Barbara McNair enjoyed a two-year run, from 1969-71, with her own syndicated variety series, but found time both before, during and after to guest on other such skeins, as when she visited Dean’s for the 11/16/67 episode (above and below), shown on Disc 2.\n\nThen there are those who may be slightly older and whose view of the episodes in the Uncut collection is skewed by their having a better recollection of The Dean Martin Show’s later seasons, which, by contemporary standards, were certainly more modern in tone and appearance than the earlier seasons.\n\nOf course, assessments of this kind tend to be highly subjective and a matter of individual taste. Nevertheless, we would contend that what both of the aforesaid groups of folks may be overlooking is that the earlier episodes were simply a product of their time, in the same way that movies and musicals of the ’50s and ’60s have a different sensibility than those that followed in the ’70s and ’80s. All have their place, and for those who, no matter what their age, have deep affection for the vintage stuff (and fortunately, a large number of younger people seem to join their elders in this category), the Uncut collection will unquestionably hit the spot.\n\nS’WONDERFUL: A frequent visitor to The Dean Martin Show during its early seasons, Caterina Valente infused her performances with a continental flair that both sparkled when she soloed (above), and mingled gracefully with Dean’s style when the two worked in tandem (below).\n\nAnd in a seriocomic sketch on the 12/14/67 episode included on Disc 2 (above and below), she also matched the vulnerability and pathos of Dom DeLuise’s character with a delicately rendered turn of her own.\n\nOne or two online critics have also carped about the technical quality of the episodes that make up the DMS Uncut set. What they seem to forget is how we viewed those episodes when they first aired. Back then, the vast majority of us had only black-and-white sets, and even those lucky (and rich) enough to have color ones were watching on screens much smaller than today’s, with far lower resolution. As Denny Coyle, one of the many perceptive regular contributors to our sister website, Dean, Golds, and Dings, has rightly pointed out about the digitally remastered Uncut episodes, “the quality is at least as good or better than we saw when they were the originally broadcast so many years ago.”\n\nMY KIND OF GIRL: Make that girls, since it’s often the plural form of the female gender that one finds surrounding Dean — and in the case of the three above, their trio’s sobriquet even bears their boss’ name. Melissa Stafford, Julie Rinker and Diana Lee (l. to r. above and below) were actually the first ladies on the show to be called Dean’s Girls, a handle eventually applied to all of the series’ pre-Golddiggers/ Dingalings female singer-dancers. During the 1967-68 season, the vocalizing trinity both performed their own standalone numbers, and harmonized with the host, as on the episode depicted here, originally telecast on 12/14/67 and contained on Disc 2.\n\no\n\nI LOVE A PIANO: The first two Dean Martin Show sets from Time-Life included the banter that would take place on each week’s episode between Dean and his pianist, Ken Lane, but omitted most of the song parodies that were an integral part of the segment, to avoid having to pay for the rights to the music. Thankfully, because this third, Uncut collection truly lives up to its title, all of Lee Hale’s clever song send-ups have been left as is.\n\nCall Me Irresponsible\n\nNowadays, anyone with a website can profess to be a critic, and one extraordinarily uninformed character in this mold has gone so far as to allege that the episodes that make up the Uncut set really aren’t uncut at all. As his supposed proof, he cites a comedy sketch on one episode in which he detected an abrupt cut. What this person is apparently unaware of (most likely because he’s largely unfamiliar with the series) is that the original shows themselves were often trimmed, due to time requirements or to keep the programs’ pace flowing.\n\nThe simple fact is that besides the one musical number that Time-Life candidly acknowledged had to be snipped because it was unsalvageable, the 6 episodes in the Uncut collection are indeed COMPLETELY UNCUT — and anyone who would argue to the contrary is not only acting utterly irresponsibly, doing a huge disservice to Dean Martin fans, but also revealing himself to be, as George Will recently labeled Donald Trump, “a bloviating ignoramus.”\n\nWishin’ And Hopin’\n\nFinally, we’ve come across one or two fence-sitters online, who claim to be holding out for complete season sets. To them, we would say respectfully: Don’t hold your breath. The fact is that there are certain musical numbers from the series that, regrettably, may not be able to be shown again for years, if ever, no matter how much money might be thrown at their owners, either because the owners refuse to give their permission or because the rights are tied up in litigation or other commitments.\n\nConsequently, we would make the case that those of us of the generation most apt to treasure The Dean Martin Show are reaching an age when it would be foolhardy to postpone the pleasure of seeing what we can see now for a future outcome that may well never come to pass.\n\nWhat’s more — and this may surprise many, if not most, of our readers — even if they were feasible, we would actually advise against the issuance of full season sets, in favor of a more diversified release slate — and here’s why:\n\nMany of us are aware of what’s happened in the past when a TV series made its long-awaited debut on DVD, starting with its first season, only to sell poorly, with the result that later seasons wind up never making it to market.\n\nSince we already know that connoisseurs of The Dean Martin Show divide into different camps — those who prefer the early years, those more partial to the later ones, and those who like them equally — why take a chance on disaffecting a whole faction of Dino denizens by risking a complete season reissue that may not live up to sales expectations and therefore puts the kibosh on future releases?\n\nInstead, we’d advocate a more eclectic approach that takes the basic concept of the current Uncut set and expands on it: To please as many DMS fans at one time as possible — and help ensure that the whole project doesn’t run off the rails — we recommend that future releases offer one uncut episode from each season of the series. Since such a bundle would thus contain a couple of more episodes than the current Uncut release, it would obviously have to be priced somewhat higher, but even so, it would still be within an eminently affordable range. And this way, every fan would have some incentive to add future sets to his or her collection.\n\nI FEEL PRETTY: And if you were Joey Heatherton, why wouldn’t you? Six months before she would go on to co-host the very first season of the Dean Martin Presents The Golddiggers summer replacement series, the blonde sex kitten who had already sizzled on Dean’s program a number of times (including on his 1965 debut), as well as traveled the world on two USO tours with Bob Hope, set the stage ablaze on the 1/25/68 DM show (above and below), before returning later in the program with a sensitive ballad (further below), and then pairing up with Dean for a mod take on his hit, “Just In Time”, from the 1960 feature film Bells Are Ringing (still further below). All of it’s on view on Uncut‘s Disc 3.\n\no\n\nCOUNTRY ROADS: Years before he became more famous for co-hosting, with Roy Clark, the long-running hillbilly answer to Laugh-In, TV’s Hee Haw, Buck Owens and his Buckaroos were riding high on the country music charts. Dropping in on Dean’s hoedown in January ’68, the band tore through a spirited “How Long Will My Baby Be Gone” (above), before Buck teamed with Dino for “I’ve Got A Tiger By The Tail” — all seen on Disc 3.\n\nPLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC: Hatched by R&B songwriter/vocalist Rufus Thomas at the beginning of 1970, the soul-cookin’ “Do The Funky Chicken” was poached later that summer by The Golddiggers In London, wherein Tommy Tune strutted as lead rooster on the number, backed by several of the program’s resident chicks.\n\nBut it was in the fall of 1970, on Dean’s weekly wingding, that the tune really broke out of its shell, when Michelle DellaFave (second from left above, and again below) led her Dingaling Sisters Susie Lund (above left), Tara Leigh (third from left above), and Wanda Bailey (above right) through a torrid rendition that witnessed fringe (rather than feathers) flying fast and furious — as those who purchase the Uncut set can discover for themselves on Disc 3.\n\nThe Dings were also invited to serve up the “Funky Chicken” to American service personnel on Bob Hope’s 1970 USO Tour, and the whole country got a gander at it on Hope’s annual Christmas special, telecast on NBC in January 1971.\n\nSome 36 years later, Michelle, Susie and Wanda reunited to stage the number anew, this time before hundreds of vets (many of whom had seen them do it back during the 1970 Hope Tour) at the 2007 convention of the Vietnam Veterans of America. Since then, Michelle has gone on to entertain audiences with a solo version of the song, both in her own act and during her Blue Eyed Soul concerts with another Dingaling Sisters colleague and friend, Lindsay Bloom.\n\nNone of this, of course, does anything to resolve that age-old question of which came first — the chicken or the egg?…\n\nYou Do Something To Me\n\nPrecious few episodes of variety series have ever been released on DVD in their complete, original form, and that’s because obtaining the necessary rights to all of the musical numbers in any given episode is a tremendously complex, time-consuming and expensive proposition. Thus, executives at Time-Life, NBC Universal and The Dean Martin Family Trust deserve enormous credit for responding to the pleas of The Dean Martin Show’s fan base with bold and meaningful action— coming through with whole, uncut episodes of the best variety show ever made, at an amazingly reasonable price. For many of us who’ve patiently waited years for this moment to arrive, it’s almost too good to be true.\n\nSo, there must be a catch, right? Well, no, we promise that in this case, there is no catch…But we do have a concern — and it’s this:\n\nThere’s been some speculation online that the six shows in the new Uncut compendium were picked primarily because the rights to the music contained in them were available and could be cleared without incurring too much expense. While it’s hard to imagine that those factors wouldn’t be taken into consideration with regard to ANY home entertainment release, any bearing that they might have on this particular collection in no way diminishes how enjoyable these six programs are to watch. With their strong repeatability quotient, the shows are keepers in every sense of the word.\n\nWhat Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life?\n\nHowever, looking ahead, we can’t help but wonder about the prospects for potential future Dean Martin Show DVD releases. As we first reported back in March, those well-connected with this venture have told us that if this current set sells well, there will be more to come. And indeed, as we announced at the beginning of this piece, we’ve now learned that production of future editions will definitely proceed.\n\nBut will episodes that contain even more musical content than found in the six most recent ones — especially shows featuring long medleys and/or song-laden spots such as Musical Questions — prove possible to clear in their entirety?\n\nThat question brings us back once again to the issue of price and its relationship to the number of episodes packaged per reissue. It seems pretty clear that the overwhelming sentiment among fans is for fewer, uncut shows per set, versus a larger number of edited ones.\n\nBut to reinforce that point, fans need to support this current collection. The obvious way to do that is by buying a copy for themselves, but they can also aid the cause by purchasing it as a gift for someone else, and by letting the powers that be know, in online forums such as this one, how much we fans desire unabridged episodes.\n\nThe Dean Martin Variety Show Uncut is a breakthrough — one that all who love Dean and his series should hope represents not just a one-time experiment, but a turning point in the franchise’s history. However, if we want to keep the uncut collections coming, we need to make our voices heard — with both our words and our wallets. Because to go back to anything less than uncut episodes would be, as Marc Antony termed Brutus’ stabbing of Julius Caesar, “the most unkindest cut of all.”\n\nWHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD: It’s perhaps fitting that a Dean Martin Show collection that gave fans the unedited approach to episodes that they’d long craved would be topped off by a deliciously sweet coda that they’ve waited more than four decades to behold again.\n\nThe much-revered “Welcome To My World” medleys, blending three dulcet tunes on which Dean harmonized with The Golddiggers in a relaxed setting, capped each weekly edition of the series’ 6th season, sending viewers off to dreamland with the beautiful strains of Lee Hale’s arrangements, Van Alexander’s orchestrations, and the soft sounds of Dean and his girls gently streaming through the ether.

The purpose of this comparison was to point out what had been retained in the T-L discs vs. what had been excluded, and to let fans know how they could fill in some of the gaps.\n\nPresenting the same type of rundown for the new Uncut set is a much happier exercise, because we can demonstrate that all of the musical numbers (save for the one already mentioned and noted again below) have been left intact, and have little overlap with what’s come before from Guthy-Renker (incidentally, important news about the G-R volumes appears at the end of this article).\n\no\n\nORIGINAL AIR DATE: 3/3/66 Time-Life Guthy-Renker Dean Martin: “The Birds And The Bees” Disc 1 The Lettermen: West Side Story Medley: “Something’s Coming” / “Maria” / “Cool” / “Tonight” Disc 1 Abbe Lane (with dancers): “Whatever Lola Wants” Disc 1 Dean Martin, Abbe Lane & Sid Caesar: “Real Live Girl” Disc 1 Marguerite Piazza: “Come Back To Sorrento” Disc 1 Dean Martin & Marguerite Piazza: “Santa Lucia” Disc 1 Dean & Ken at The Piano Disc 1 Dean Martin: “Hands Across The Table” Disc 1 Dean Martin, Sid Caesar & George Gobel: “Dames” Medley: ““There Is Nothing Like A Dame” / “Smiles” / “Standing On The Corner” / “Girls” / “I Can Always Find A Little Sunshine In The Y.M.C.A.” Disc 1\n\no\n\nORIGINAL AIR DATE: 1/12/67 Time-Life Guthy-Renker Dean Martin: “A Marshmallow World” Disc 1 Steve Rossi: “My Lonely Room” Disc 1 Marty Allen & Steve Rossi: “Let’s Face The Music And Dance” Disc 1 Leslie Uggams (with Jack Sperling on drums & dancers): Medley: “Fascinating Rhythm” / “Slap That Bass” Disc 1 Dean Martin & Leslie Uggams: Medley: “Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive” / “Clap Yo Hands” / “Snap Your Fingers” Disc 1 Dean Martin & dancers: “Playmates” Station Break Tease Disc 1 Special Edition Vol. Dean & Ken at The Piano Disc 1 Vol. 14 Dean Martin: “I’ve Grown Accustomed To Her Face” Disc 1 Vol. 14 Eddie Foy Jr. & dancers mime to “Standing On The Corner” Disc 1 Eddie Foy Jr. (accompanied in dancing by Barbara Perry): “Gigi” (comic version) Disc 1 Dean Martin & Eddie Foy Jr. tap-dance to “Tea For Two” Disc 1 Dean Martin, Leslie Uggams, Eddie Foy Jr., Marty Allen, Steve Rossi, Jackie Mason: Back Porch Medley: “Sing Along” / “On Moonlight Bay” / “Heart Of My Heart” / “When You Wore A Tulip And I Wore A Big Red Rose” / “Toot Toot Tootsie (Goodbye)” / “Ma (She’s Making Eyes At Me” / “I’m Looking Over A Four-Leaf Clover” Disc 1\n\no\n\nORIGINAL AIR DATE: 11/16/67 Time-Life Guthy-Renker Dean Martin: “Turn to Me” Disc 2 Vol. 6 Cyd Charisse dances to “Music To Watch Girls By” Disc 2 Dean Martin & Cyd Charisse: “I Won‘t Dance” Disc 2 Dean & Ken at The Piano Disc 2 Dean Martin: “Nevertheless” Disc 2 Buddy Ebsen, Wisa D’Orso & Dean’s Girls: “I Like The Likes Of You” Disc 2 Vol. 20 Dean Martin & Buddy Ebsen: ‘Sam’s Song” Disc 2 Vol. 20 Barbara McNair: “Nothing Can Stop Me Now”;

Well, evidently, they weren’t just whistling Dixie.\n\nGuthy-Renker has, in fact, stopped marketing the discs — this time, for good — no doubt as a stipulation of the settlement of the lawsuit filed back in 2007 by NBCUniversal against G-R, Greg Garrison Productions and others. For the time being, individual volumes of Guthy-Renker’s Dean Martin Show collection can still be found on Amazon, ebay, and a few other websites — but, as they say in the advertisements, “When they’re gone, they’re gone.”\n\no\n\no\n\nIf you’d like to comment on this article or share your views about The Dean Martin Show on DVD, please feel free to do so in the space provided below.\n\nFor the latest updates on these and all other matters pertaining to Dean Martin, be sure to click the Like button on the Facebook page of our sister website, Dean, Golds and Dings, where you’re cordially invited to join not only other fans of Dean Martin but many alumnae of The Golddiggers and The Dingaling Sisters, as well.

In the final hour of prime-time each and every Thursday, the party was getting a glow on, and singing filled the air. In the shank of the night, they were doing it right, and much of America was there.\n\nBut the second major attempt to recapture the magic of this hippest-of-hip series and bottle it for home video has drawn lukewarm reviews at best and ignited a firestorm of fury among fans. In the piece that follows, we cover the heat, but also endeavor to shed additional light, on the subject at hand.\n\n“Wonderful, Wonderful Television.”\n\nIt’s the title lyric of one of those catchy jingles that served to introduce an assortment of regular segments that appeared on The Dean Martin Show during the course of its 9-year run from 1965-74 — indeed, the refrain pops up several times on the new 6-DVD Best of The Dean Martin Variety Show: Collector’s Edition recently released by Time-Life — and it’s a phrase that aptly sums up the high levels of both esteem and affection with which Dean’s original landmark series is regarded by its millions of fans throughout the world.\n\nBut with a substantial portion of the sweet sounds that once emanated from this finely-tuned instrument muted in the new Time-Life treasury drawn from the vaults of the network that first brought us the series, NBC, many are left to wonder what happened to so much of what made the show so great in the first place — the musical content.\n\nNow that Deana Martin, one of Dean’s daughters and a popular entertainer in her own right, has told columnists Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith that a second installment of material from her father’s series is already in the planning stages (a fact that we have independently confirmed with officials at both Time-Life and NBCUniversal), we thought that this would be the ideal time to take a comprehensive look at the first collection that went on sale a few weeks ago, examining what’s good about it, what’s not, and how any possible future editions could be improved.\n\nThen, in a Super Site exclusive, we provide a guide to how the musical selections found in Time-Life’s bundle of episodes stack up against both the musical components of those same episodes when they originally aired on NBC and what’s available in the earlier 29-volume Dean Martin Show anthology from Guthy-Renker.\n\nFor Shakespeare’s Hamlet, “The play’s the thing.” When it comes to The Dean Martin Show, for us — and judging from comments left on our website and others, for most fans of Dean’s series — the music’s the thing; and so, that is the aspect of the new DVD set on which we’ve herein trained our attention.\n\nA Blue, Blue Day\n\nIn our detailed preview posted here on the Super Site at the beginning of April, we reported that the framework of Time-Life’s new 6-DVD set would be formed around freestanding episodes from The Dean Martin Show’s original NBC broadcasts. But based on information that we received from sources connected with the project, we also conveyed the news that each of the episodes included would, in fact, run only 30 to 45 minutes in length. Inasmuch as those same episodes, when first broadcast on NBC, had running times of approximately 52 minutes, we predicted — all too accurately, as it turned out — that for DVD, the parts relegated to the chopping block would be musical in nature, due to the exorbitant cost of licensing DVD rights from composers and publishers.\n\nIn actuality, after screening all of the DVDs, we can attest to the fact that at least one episode clocks in at less than 20 minutes, with most averaging in the neighborhood of 25 to 35 minutes. What’s more, while we anticipated that many of the songs would face the executioner’s axe, we never imagined that such a huge proportion of them would be ones performed by the star of the show himself.\n\nI NEVER PROMISED YOU A ROSE GARDEN: Despite our cautionary note last Spring that Time-Life’s new Dean Martin Show collection would be released minus a good deal of each featured episode’s original musical performances, even many of those who read our preview of the set were caught off-guard by the extent of the cuts — not unlike Dean’s surprise at seeing Ralph Edwards emerge from his closet in the scene above, from Disc 4 of the T-L compendium (though probably no one would be too taken aback if “This Is Your Life, Dean Martin” brought forth a parade of “friends” such as those pictured here).\n\nYou’re Breaking My Heart\n\nOf the 20 episodes in the T-L package, only 5 retain Dean Martin‘s opening number, and not a single one of the ballads that he would perform in a relaxed mode, midway through the show — the segments that have been dubbed the “couch songs” — made their way onto this collection. Also absent are most of the song parodies that Dean would warble whilst sitting atop Ken Lane‘s piano. The banter from those segments remains — it’s simply the music that’s been extracted — as if no one familiar with the show’s format would notice.\n\nLOOK WHAT THEY’VE DONE TO MY SONG, MA: Fans have been disheartened to see most of Dean’s opening numbers, as well as all of his couch songs, removed from episodes contained in the new T-L set.\n\nI Can’t Help Remembering You\n\nBy contrast, even though the earlier Guthy-Renker compilation of Dean Martin Show highlights consisted of excerpts from different episodes and different seasons of the series’ run all mixed together, Greg Garrison, the Producer/Director of the program who oversaw assemblage of the G-R set, made sure that virtually all of its 29 volumes included one of Dean’s opening numbers near the beginning of the disc and one of his couch songs around the midway point — in keeping with the natural sequence and rhythm of the DM shows as they were originally telecast.\n\nAlmost all of the G-R volumes also included one of the Dean and Kenny piano vignettes, and every single one of those was left untouched, with the song parodies intact.\n\nThe employment of self-contained episodes in the new Time-Life collection was supposed to address one of the foremost complaints about the Guthy-Renker volumes — namely, that they took a scattershot approach to arranging footage from the series’ near-decade-long tenure. Ironically, with so many obvious gaps, choppy edits and abrupt transitions marring this newer outing, the end result seems like a pale, eviscerated abridgment of the original. Patchwork though they may have been, the G-R volumes at least sought to replicate the structure, if not the identical lineup, of the original series, and each one thus comes closer to succeeding as a more faithful facsimile of a whole Dean Martin Show episode than those found in the new T-L set.\n\nTHAT OLD TIME FEELIN’: Greg Garrison (above) and Lee Hale seemed to capture it on the Guthy-Renker volumes in a way that the new Time-Life set doesn’t.\n\nAll Or Nothing At All\n\nIn his running commentary on the Guthy-Renker discs, Greg Garrison notes that up until the time that he assumed the reins as Producer of Dean’s series a few weeks into its first season (after the first occupant of that job was fired by NBC because of the program’s initially low ratings), Dean’s role on the show was largely confined to that of being “a pointer”, à la Ed Sullivan — meaning, basically, an emcee who would introduce other acts.\n\nOnce fully in charge, Greg changed that situation by involving Dean to a much greater degree in the show’s comedy sketches and in song pairings with his guests. Lee Hale, The Dean Martin Show’s revered Music Director, avers this recollection of events in his own remarks on the new Time-Life set. And yet, by virtue of so many of Dean’s solos being excised from the latter collection, the role of “pointer” is precisely the status to which he frequently winds up being reduced on these new DVDs.\n\nAll Of Me, Why Not Take All Of Me?\n\nHowever, it’s not just a lot of the host’s numbers that have gone missing in action on this front; many of his guest stars’ showpiece turns have suffered the same fate (while others not only survived, but sparkle; more on that below). Compounding the frustration of those who’ve purchased this set is the fact that the opening and closing credits of each episode have been left unexpurgated, teasing viewers with tantalizing glimpses of personalities and scenes from the original telecasts that they never have a chance to see on the edited DVDs.\n\nAmong those who work in the entertainment industry, there’s a common saying about how to save a production that’s gone awry during shooting, whether it be a feature film or a TV show: “We’ll fix it in post” (in other words, salvage it in post-production, or editing). In the case of The Dean Martin Show, though, it’s the other way around: The original footage is just fine — it’s “in post” that so much of the heart and soul of the program has been lost beyond repair.\n\nIS THAT ALL THERE IS?: With so many of Dean’s solo numbers cut from the T-L DVDs, those viewing them who are too young to remember the original telecasts (a demographic that the promoters of this fare seem eager to court) are liable to wonder what all the fuss is about. Meanwhile, those of ALL ages familiar with the series can be forgiven for having a sense of déjà vu if they recognize, from not that long ago, segments such as Dean crooning with The Mills Brothers (above) and crooning and spooning with Lainie Kazan (below) — performances which, terrific as they are, were already part of the previously-distributed Guthy-Renker collection.\n\no\n\nOn The Sunny Side Of The Street\n\nFlaws aside (and we’ll try to pinpoint their root causes later in this piece), there are, to be sure, plenty of examples of “Wonderful, Wonderful Television” in the new 6-disc Time-Life collection that make it worthwhile to own — it’s just a shame that few of them appearing for the first time on DVD (that is, not already seen on the Guthy-Renker volumes) feature Dean.\n\nOf those that do, we’re delighted to see the inclusion of:\n\n• A cozy rendition of “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love” by Dean, Peggy Lee, and Jack Jones from the first year of the series; as well as a more modern variation on the same tune seven years later by Dean and The Dingaling Sisters.\n\nLOVE IS A MANY-SPLENDORED THING: Especially when a standard like “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love” is served up not just once, but twice in the new T-L set — first in 1965 (above), as sung by Dean, Peggy Lee and Jack Jones; and again (below) in a 1973 show opener by Dean and The Dingaling Sisters (l. to r.: Helen Funai, Michelle DellaFave, Jayne Kennedy, Lindsay Bloom).\n\no\n\n• A finale to the 9/29/66 episode that ended with Dean, The Andrews Sisters, Lainie Kazan, Tim Conway and Frank Gorshin, gathered ’round a piano — played by no less than Duke Ellington — to sing “Swingin‘ Down The Lane”.\n\n• Dean opening the 2/11/71 show with a rousing “Somebody Stole My Gal”.\n\n• Dean and Gene Kelly cheerfully harmonizing on a medley of “When You’re Smiling” and “I Want To Be Happy”.\n\n• Dean wrapping up the last show of the series’ third season with a contemplative ”Look For The Silver Lining”, followed by his annual, complete “Everybody Loves Somebody” closer.\n\n• Dean dueting with Kate Smith on “Let Me Call You Sweetheart”.\n\n• Dean and Janet Leigh getting intimate with a short, but cute “Put Your Arms Around Me, Honey”.\n\nIn truth, much to the chagrin of Dean’s fan base, who bought this package hoping and expecting to see more of him, the real showstoppers in this compendium turn out to be the liberal helpings of solo performances by some of the guest stars on the show. Among the standouts in this category making their DVD debut are numbers by Joel Grey (as we had hoped), Peggy Lee, Jack Jones, Michael Landon, Sammy Davis, Jr., Tony Bennett, The Andrews Sisters, Debbie Reynolds, Florence Henderson, Ethel Merman, Roger Miller, Kate Smith, Janet Leigh, and Eddy Arnold (for a complete rundown of their song selections, see the chart at the end of this article).\n\nC’EST MAGNIFIQUE: Even with much of the original series’ musical edifice torn away, among what’s left standing in the T-L collection are some real humdingers, including glittering production numbers by (above, from top) Joel Grey, Debbie Reynolds, Kate Smith, and Janet Leigh; as well as heartfelt vocal renderings by Roger Miller and Eddy Arnold (respectively, below).\n\no\n\nHave A Little Sympathy\n\nEven among the non-musical portions of the shows are a few intriguing tidbits here and there — none more fascinating than a surprise moment at the close of the premiere episode of the series’ third season, when, before saying goodnight, Dean advises his audience to “Do Yourself a favor. Tune in to Jerry Lewis‘ new show Tuesday night…because I’m going to.”\n\nNow, consider the circumstances: Dean had long since silenced the skeptics who believed after his break-up with Jerry that his career would sputter, while Jerry’s would thrive. Of course, just the opposite came true: By 1967, Dean was an international movie star, a hit recording artist, a leading draw in Las Vegas, and the highest-paid performer on television; and in its third season, his series would finish for the first time in the top ten. Although some of Jerry’s films made out well at the box office, his celebrity had undeniably faded from what it had been during the glory days of Martin and Lewis, as well as the heights that some had thought it might one day reach.\n\nThe team’s breakup had been marked by rancor, and the two hadn’t been on speaking terms for years. Yet here was Dean, taking the time on his own highly-successful show to give a gracious and generous plug to his erstwhile professional partner’s fledgling series. That effort by Jerry would struggle in the ratings and be off the air by the end of its second season (another regular series attempt by Jerry in 1963 lasted only 13 weeks), while Dean’s skein would continue for another 7 years. But to watch the magnanimous nod that Dean gave to his old colleague on that Thursday night in September 1967 affords some rare insight into the man’s character. It was pure Dean — that is to say, pure class.\n\n(EX-) PARDNERS: Dean gave Jerry Lewis’ nascent Tuesday night series a sincere promotional push on his own popular show.\n\nThere Is Nothing Like A Dame\n\n“Hey, where are the girls, pal?”\n\nAccording to Greg Garrison, that’s what Dean told him the guys back in his hometown of Steubenville, Ohio (and by extension, presumably all over the country) were wondering when they watched The Dean Martin Show. And, as Greg affirmed in his commentary on the Guthy-Renker reels, it was that thinking, along with Dean’s encouragement, that prompted him to keep the series’s regular cast well-stocked with a steady contingent of attractive female singers and dancers.\n\nBut the question of “Where are the girls, pal?” is also one that a lot of those (not only men, but women, too) who fondly recalled the programs’ sizable distaff presence found themselves asking when viewing the 29 volumes of the G-R collection. While various members of The Golddiggers, The Dingaling Sisters, and their predecessors (usually referred to as “Dean’s Girls”) can be seen from time to time on those discs, in production numbers and comedy sketches, they generally appear in the background.\n\nThe new Time-Life set isn’t much better on this score, but does take a few steps in the right direction. Although, regrettably, there are no fresh restorations of those prized medleys in which Dean and his resident gals make beautiful music together, and no numbers at all featuring The Golddiggers, there are several first-time-on-DVD breakthroughs: 1) The first opening song performed not just by Dean alone, but accompanied by The Dingaling Sisters; 2) the first “Club Dingaling” intro by The Dings to Rodney Dangerfield‘s stand-up comedy segment during the 8th season; and 3) the first full-length solo spots by any of Dean’s female troupes, with one song by The Dingalings, and another by the original trio christened “Dean’s Girls”, that’s followed by Dean chatting with the ladies and giving each one a chance to tell a little bit about herself.\n\nIt’s likely not enough to sate the gang in Steubenville (or anywhere else, for that matter) — but it’s a start.\n\nI’M LOOKING OVER A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER (THAT I OVERLOOKED BEFORE): The first set of Dingaling Sisters from the 1972-73 season of Dean’s series distinguish themselves both individually and as a quartet with their performance of “Four Of A Kind” (above, l. to r.: Helen Funai, Lynne Latham, Jayne Kennedy, Tara Leigh).\n\no\n\nLOVE FOR SALE: As Lee Hale recounts in his book Backstage At The Dean Martin Show, when the decision was made to let three of the gals in the chorus step into the spotlight with their own number, an impish Greg Garrison, who loved to push the envelope, dreamed up a name for the new trio that he knew would give NBC’s censors fits: The Hooker Sisters! Eventually, a tamer monicker was chosen — Dean’s Girls, comprising (above, l. to r.): Melissa Stafford, Julie Rinker, Diana Lee — and the group’s maiden performance, on the Nov. 23, 1967 episode, can be seen on Disc 6 of the Time-Life collection.\n\nI Don’t Know Why\n\nAs disappointing as some of the Time-Life collection’s edits and omissions may be, the handling of the set’s “bonus features” is exponentially — and inexplicably — worse.\n\nConstituting the extras are comments and reflections from a cadre of those who worked on Dean’s series, either regularly or as guest stars. In sections set apart from the original episodes, each of the notables invited to speak holds forth in individual turns that last anywhere from 9 to 18 minutes at a sitting, with three to four such extended soliloquies appended, back to back, to each of the six DVDs in the package. No interviewer is seen or heard on-screen during these segments; instead, the clunky and tedious device of title cards is used to pose questions, with long-winded answers then following.\n\nA few of the interviewees supply some pointed observations and compelling tales, but one is hard-pressed to glean much that’s meaningful amid a mountain of folderol resulting from a lack of editorial judgment that allows these personalities to ramble on at length. At times, it begins to resemble an exercise in free association, with the participants going off on maundering, often incomprehensible tangents about whatever comes to mind. It could be Phyllis Diller talking about Fang (the fictitious husband she invented for her comedy routines)…Florence Henderson venting about Kate Smith…or Norm Crosby opining about the tendency of some contemporary comics to use profanity in their acts…among other excursions into off-topic arcana.\n\nSay It Isn’t So\n\nWhat’s worse is that we’re once again taunted by the specter of musical sequences that never materialize. In this case, the lure stems from several of the subjects relating stories about scenes in which they appeared on Dean’s show, but which aren’t part of this collection.\n\nHence, we hear Angie Dickinson going into elaborate detail about a production number that she did on the show revolving around then-husband Burt Bacharach‘s hit tune, “I’ll Never Fall In Love Again” — but we’re never given the opportunity to see it. Dean’s daughter, Gail Martin, talks about being on the program on several occasions — yet not one of her performances is shown. In fact, neither Angie nor Gail is featured in ANY of the episodes in the Time-Life release.\n\nFlorence Henderson references a medley that she did with Dean in which the two of them took a pratfall, and while one of her solos from a different episode is included in this compilation, that duet with Dean that she mentioned is not (for the record, it does appear on Volume 2 of the Guthy-Renker set).\n\nAnd so these talking head sessions unfold, one after another, with nary a video clip or even a still photo woven in to illustrate any of the points being made.\n\n(HOW LITTLE IT MATTERS) HOW LITTLE WE KNOW: Some of the celebs taking part in the T-L set’s Bonus Interviews have some interesting things to say, but they’re ill-served by a static format and irrelevant queries, like the one above asked of Carol Lawrence, that prompt guests to dwell on non-germane topics.\n\nMy Favorite Things\n\nEven with those shortcomings, however, some of these witnesses to history come off better than others. Lainie Kazan is animated and concentrates her remarks on her experiences with Dean and working on his show. At least Jonathan Winters injects a little levity to break up the monotony. And Susan Lund (now Susie Ewing) adds some entertaining anecdotes about Dean’s series and her group, The Golddiggers (despite the fact that, as previously noted, The Golddiggers are all but invisible on the original episodes in the T-L set).\n\nThe one genuinely invaluable contribution comes from the lone interviewee whose domain was behind the cameras rather than in front of them — The Dean Martin Show’s Music Director and all-around go-to guy, Lee Hale. The elder statesman of the collective providing commentary on these DVDs, he’s also far and away the sharpest, most focused, most articulate, and most interesting. It’s just a pity that his remarks (as well as those of some of the others) weren’t more skillfully massaged into the proceedings, as was done with Greg Garrison’s input on the Guthy-Renker volumes.\n\nSENTIMENTAL JOURNEY: Lainie Kazan and Lee Hale are among those who wax eloquent and nostalgic about Dean and his series.\n\nAs Time Goes By\n\nNow, it may well be that those who assembled the Time-Life collection didn’t want to interrupt the continuity of the original episodes with commentary. Nonetheless, there are other, vastly more adroit and effective means by which these interviews could have been sewn into the fabric of the presentation. For instance, as is so often done with the DVD format, a separate audio track for commentary could have been included. Or if on-camera appearances, segregated from the original episodes, were desired, they could have at least been spliced together to achieve a brisker, livelier pace, and then interspersed with clips — or if that posed licensing (read: financial) difficulties, then, at a minimum, stills — to provide some stimulating visual accompaniment.\n\nBut let’s face it: The real purpose of these bonus interviews was padding — to fill in the gaping holes left by the chunks of original program footage that were discarded on the cutting room floor. Still and all, a more imaginative approach could have yielded much more satisfying results. As it is, the lazy, banal manner in which these commentaries were cobbled together gives new meaning to the old cliché “talk is cheap.”\n\nThe same cleaver that hacked away so much of the main attraction should have been wielded in equal measure on the extras. Indeed, it’s hard to envisage all but the most diehard Dean Martin fans having the patience to wade through the bulk of these ineptly-presented bonus segments. The show business pros who took part in these sessions deserve much better — and so does the audience.\n\nLET’S PUT OUT THE LIGHTS (AND GO TO SLEEP): Watching some of these bonus interviews, you may doze off before you can hit the switch.\n\nIt’s The Talk Of The Town\n\nAs those hungry for the first new Dean Martin Show offerings in eight years have had a chance to digest T-L/NBC’s freshly-prepared bill of fare, many have turned dyspeptic over the meager servings of solo numbers by Dean. Indeed, the preponderance of reaction on websites such as Amazon has been scathing, with some of the headlines of reviews by purchasers exclaiming: “Where Is Dean?”…“Really Sad”…“Very Disappointing”…“Sliced ’N Diced”…“Death By A Thousand Cuts”…“Dino Disaster!” As if that weren’t enough, in many cases, the reviews themselves have been even more caustic.\n\nPeople have described these shows as having been butchered — and they’re right in the sense that a lot of the programs’ musical meat has been stripped from the bone. Fans starving years for a feast and expecting fillet mignon have instead been served up a far more plebeian cut: chopped chuck (or ground round — take your pick).\n\nWe hope that the powers that be at Time-Life, NBC, and the Dean Martin Family Trust (whose imprimatur is also on these new releases) will heed these criticisms, as they are an important starting point for devising a better solution to the problem of satisfying consumer sentiment for the inclusion of more musical content.\n\nAt the same time, we recognize that this is a complex and thorny issue, and believe that the purveyors of this product need to do a better job of communicating that fact to the fans.
