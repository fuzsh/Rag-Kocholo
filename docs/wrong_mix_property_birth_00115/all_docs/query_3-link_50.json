Tombaugh\n\nAnd\n\nPublished 1930\n\nReprinted with Complete\n\nIndex added\n\nTombaugh Publishing House\n\nRochester, Indiana\n\n1978\n\nCopyright 1978\n\nJean C. and Wendell C. Tombaugh\n\n700 Pontiac Street\n\nRochester, IN\n\nMade in the United States of America\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOver a century ago five of the children of the Washington County, Pennsylvania pioneer, George Tombaugh, migrated from the home in Washington County, Pa., to the then West.\n\nThese five children were followed by a sixth of George Tombaugh's children in the year 1837, leaving but one of the seven children of George and Elizabeth Tombaugh in Pennsylvania. As time passed communication between the descendants of those members of the families who had early moved westward and their eastern kindred remaining in Pennsylvania gradually was abandoned until there was practically no acquaintance between them.\n\nIt was in the winter of 1912-13 that the chief compiler of this work met Mrs. Rosalie Ewing at Cambridge, Ohio, she being a granddaughter of Sarah (Tombaugh) Myers. From her he learned much of the history of those of the early Tombaugh families who had early located in Ohio and also he received from Mrs. Ewing a copy of certain traditions respecting early Tombaugh history which had been related by Amanda (Myers) Wurtz, a daughter of Sarah (Tombaugh) Myers, to Mrs. Alice Dean, a granddaughter of Sarah (Tombaugh) Myers, and committed to writing by Mrs. Dean.\n\nThese traditions with other traditions related about the early Tombaughs to the writer by his father, John Tombaugh, son of the Pennsylvania Matthias Tombaugh, were the means which led the writer to locate the historical records of the colonial Tombaughs at Harrisburgh, Pa., and at Lancaster, Pa.\n\nAll these traditions were obscure but their very obscurity was evidence of the existence of a considerable period of time in our early history past the time of the Washington County pioneer George Tombaugh which had been, until this research, as far in the past as our authentic history, other than obscure traditions extended.\n\nThe knowledge that we were of Pennsylvania German stock and the discovery in the archives of the Revolution of a Tombaugh, to us a stranger, by name of Frederick Tombaugh of York County, Pa., indicated that the place most likely to yield results in finding the early records of our people would be in Southeastern Pennsylvania. These records of the colonial Tombaughs were eventually located at Lancaster, Pa. Nor has the name been found in colonial times in any other State than Pennsylvania and only in the Southeastern part of that State.\n\nHowever, it was before these interesting records were found that at a reunion of the Tombaugh family held at Scenery Hill, Pa., August 12, 1927, that the writer was requested by the members of the family there present to prepare a history of the Tombaugh family.\n\nThe above mentioned reunion was the result of a desire of John M. Tombaugh and his wife, Alice, to honor their guests: Dr. L. H. Tombaugh and wife of Waukegan, Ill., a brother of John M. Tombaugh, and Mrs. Mildred Mann and her husband, William A. Mann, of Chicago, Ill., Mrs. Mann being a daughter of John M. and Alice Tombaugh.\n\nAfter the appointment of the writer to prepare a Tombaugh history, it was first contemplated to write only a history of the Pennsylvania Matthias Tombaugh group with reviews of the related families. But more extensive research indicated the desirability of a history of the entire family in America, so far as the facts were procurable.\n\nThis project had reached such progress by the time of the 200th anniversary reunion of the family on August 18, 1928, at the \"Haw Bottom tract\" of George Tombaugh, owned by one of his great-grandsons, W. Scott Tombaugh of Somerset Township, Washington County, Pa., that the completion of the work was assured.\n\nThe reunion was attended by representatives of six of the seven family divisions descended from George Tombaugh the pioneer, with the result that an acquaintance was again formed between the different branches of the family.\n\nThe authorities most largely consulted in preparing this work are Rupp's 30,000 Names, U. S. Census, Pennsylvania Archives, reports thereon by H. H. Shenk, Archivist; Lancaster, Pa., Court House records, and records of the Trinity Lutheran Church of Lancaster, Pa. The abstracts from these made by Miss Lottie Bausman, Genealogist. An article in Crumrine's History of Washington County, Pa. Records of Washington County, Pa., Court House, both these latter by Attorney Byron E. Tombaugh. Brumbaugh's Early Maryland Records. Prof. T. C. Tarr of Princeton University. Family records in Bibles. Transcripts on headstones, and many family records.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE NAME TOMBAUGH\n\nEarly in the preparation of this work it was learned that the spelling of our name Tombaugh was not found among the names listed in works on family names in Germany or Holland. This led to the conclusion that the name was anglisized of some other name and various conjectures were made as to what name Tombaugh was derived from.\n\nThe name of the emigrant ancestor on its first appearance is on the shipping list of the ship Albany and is not spelled Tombaugh, but Danbach. As this \"a\" is the old German \"a\" with the sound of the English \"o\" we thus find the name changed to Donbach in Rupp's 30,000 Names of Immigrants. We have three signatures of the emigrant ancestor and one of his wife. His three signatures are Donbog, Dannbock, and in joining in a deed with his wife, he signs Donboig, and she Donbe.\n\nIt is not until about 1750 that we find the spelling Tombaugh.\n\nAt the Lancaster County, Pa., Court House from that date forward we find the spellings of the name on perhaps twenty-five different occasions and possibly four-fifths of the spellings are Tombaugh, Tombough or Tombuch, with Tombaugh the most frequent.\n\nAt the court proceedings at the Lancaster, Pa., Court House, English was mainly used with the result that our name there assumes an anglisized form but at the Trinity Lutheran Church at Lancaster where the early Tombaughs attended, German was then the language used and in the birth registry of that church the spelling Tombaugh does not show, but the spellings there are Tannbach, Tanbach, Dannbach, Danbach and Dambach.\n\nFrom the examples given it is readily seen that the name begins with \"D\" about as frequently as with \"T\".\n\nThis confusion in the spelling of the name Tombaugh was not greater in our name than in other names and the language in general in Southeast Pennsylvania. A confusion so great between German and English as to result in that peculiar form of speech known as Pennsylvania German.\n\nIt is to Prof. T. C. Tarr of the Department of Modern Languages of Princeton University that the discovery of the name of which Tombaugh is a variant must be credited to.\n\nA number of the early spellings of the name was submitted to Prof. Tarr but the spellings Tannbach and Tanbach was not among the spellings sent as the writer regarded those as queer spelling. Prof. Tarr answered in substance that the only name among German names in which the changed sound from the German letters to English letters would produce the name Tombaugh was the German name Tannbach. The more detailed explanation which he gave was that the German word for brook was bach, but the spelling of this in English was baugh. That the \"a\" in Tann is the old German \"a\" with practically the sound of the English \"o\".\n\nThus the sound of the German Tannbach is in English Tonnbaugh, so close Tombaugh that the difference can be detected with difficulty.\n\nAs to the change from \"nn\" in Tannbach to \"m\" in Tombaugh, that is a regular change as \"n\" before \"b\" or \"p\" has a tendency to become \"m\", and in the anglisizing of this name the changes are clearly shown in the records at Lancaster, Pa. Tannbach means \"Brook of the fir forest.\" The fir tree which has given us the first element of our name is similar to the pines.\n\nThis method of naming families after natural objects has largely passed long ago.\n\nAnd a name originating as does Tannbach, in natural objects, may easily be of extreme antiquity--thousands rather than hundreds of years old.\n\nWe have seen in the early spellings of the name that it began frequently with \"D\" instead of \"T\"--the sound of these two letters are so close that etymologists regard them as interchangeable. This being true when Prof. Tarr's explanation that the original spelling of our name was Tannbach was received; the writer changed all the \"Ds\" where they began the name to the letter \"T\". This resulted in a very decided transformation. The numerous spellings of Dannbach and Danbach transformed to Tannbach. There being then over a dozen signatures of Tannbach among the German records.\n\nBut the inquiry may arise--Why were there so many and such diverse spellings of the name among the early signatures? As all indications are that the early members of our family were fairly well educated, these different name spellings could not be attributed to ignorance of spelling.\n\nIt appears that the different spellings of our name is largely an attempt to find a selection of letters of other languages to reproduce the sound Tannbach, as spelled by German letters. Thus in the case of the emigrant ancestor, it appears probable he had a working knowledge of four languages--German, English, Dutch and Frisic.\n\nAnd wherein he spells the name Donboig or Donbog, he is using the Dutch, as also is his wife, when she signs Donbe. But when they spell the name Dannbock, the effort is toward an English spelling.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE FIRST GENERATION - JOHN JACOB TOMBAUGH\n\nThe traditions of our family, and such documentary evidence obtainable, are in agreement as to the province of Germany from which the emigrant ancestor of the Tombaugh family came from. Thus the German settlers in Southeast Pennsylvania, who later became known as Pennsylvania Germans, and among whom were our ancestors, were largely from the vicinity of Saarbrucken and Kaisernlauntern in the old German Palatinate.\n\nThis Palatinate was formerly located between Alsace, France and Bavaria. It is now largely the Rhine province of Prussia and Bavaria.\n\nThe papers of the ship Albany, in which our ancestors made the passage, show that the passengers were Palatines--that is natives of the Palatinate.\n\nThe traditions of the family are that the emigrant ancestor was from Saarbrucken--a town not very far from Bingen, the fair Bingen on the Rhine of our school readers, with a possibility that a part of the Palatinate in which they had lived may have fallen in the division of that province to the state of Bavaria. This country from which our ancestor came from is described as a level, fertile farming country, rising into highlands back from the lower lying lands along the steams.\n\nWhile we have no direct information respecting our people and remote ancestry in Germany, yet as our name is partly derived from the fir forests, it is probable that in remote times they were dwellers in the forests and their labor was in connection with forest products, and their labor though arduous would be very healthful.\n\nFrom traditions we learn that our emigrant ancestor, Hans Jakob Tannbach, or as we now write it, John Jacob Tombaugh, traveled from his home in the German Palatinate to Holland, as a single man. We do not know to a certainty why he left the Palatinate, but as he was a member of the Lutheran Church and some years before he left, there had been persecutions of the Protestants by the Catholics.\n\nIt is quite possible that he, like many others at that time, went to Holland, where religious freedom was tolerated. Again tradition recalls that in Holland, John Jacob met and became acquainted with Maria Elizabeth, whose maiden name is not known. They were married. Tradition informs us that this couple spoke Frisic in their home, from which it is inferred that Maria Elizabeth was a native of Friesland of the north of Holland. Frisic, which they were supposed to speak, was an ancient tongue from which English is quite largely derived.\n\nAs we shall see later in this work, Frederich, who appears to have been the second child of John Jacob and Maria Elizabeth Tombaugh, was born two years before the family came to America. It is quite evident that this couple remained in Holland for some years after their marriage.\n\nHowever much uncertainty there may be in these various traditions, and our deductions based upon them, it is a matter of record that on the 22nd day of June, 1728, this family boarded the ship Albany at Rotterdam, Holland, to begin the journey to the new world. The passengers of the ship, Albany, on this journey, were thirty Palatines--heads of families--about one hundred passengers. The ship stopped for a time at Cowles, England, and then proceeded on the long journey across the Atlantic.\n\nHere tradition relates that when out on the ocean, those on board the ship were greatly alarmed by the cry of fire, however, this danger was passed, as were also the very real dangers from pirates and storms, that the small vessels of those times were forced to face.\n\nOn the 4th of September, 1728, the ship Albany arrived at the port of Philadelphia, Pa. We have a record of this fact, because this country was then under the sovereignty of Great Britain, and people arriving here from other countries, before being permitted to land, had to swear allegiance to the English king. These records, at Philadelphia, have been retained and from them we learn the date of the arrival of our early people. The City of Brotherly Love, when John Jacob Tombaugh and his family arrived, contained around 6,000 inhabitants. Although a frontier settlement, it was beginning to aspire toward literary achievement, as in the same year that our early people arrived, a certain young man named Benjamin Franklin, began publishing the Saturday Evening Post, which remains a prominent publication. It is quite possible that Benjamin and John Jacob were acquainted. Whether this be true or otherwise, we very much doubt if either of them ever imagined that in the course of 200 years, a descendant of each would be married to the other and be living on the far away Pacific Coast, as we shall later see herein is a fact.\n\nWe have no record where John Jacob Tombaugh and his family lived from 1728 to 1742, as he appears to have been a town man, although we do not know his occupation. They probably lived in or near Philadelphia, Pa., but we find no record of them in the Court House records, and so early was it in the history of this, the earliest city in Pennsylvania, that no church records go back so far; the earliest being only to 1746.\n\nThe next trace of John Jacob Tombaugh we find, is in the Court House records at Lancaster, Pa., where it appears that Jacob Tombaugh, on May 28th and 29th, 1742, bought a house, a plantation and two tracts of land, from John and Anna Cristy of that place, and this remained John Jacob Tombaugh's home until his death.\n\nShowing the conditions in Pennsylvania at that time had he ventured out as far west as Lancaster, Pa., when they came to America in 1728, he would have found a few farmers, but more trappers and Indian traders, and he and his family would have been in danger of the genuine scalp lifting savages.\n\nFrom 1742, until the date of his death, we find a number of references to Jacob Tombaugh in the Court House records of Lancaster, Pa.\n\nThus on August 15, 1750, Jacob sells to his son Frederich, one-half acre of land, and on December 8, 1756, he sells to Frederich a parcel of land in Lancaster Township, containing two acres, which adjoins a lot belonging to Eva Tombaugh; and on the same date, Jacob sells a tract of two acres to Conrad Bott, which land also adjoins Eva Tombaugh's lot.\n\nWe do not know to what age Jacob Tombaugh lived, but the burial record of the Trinity Lutheran Church at Lancaster, Pa., shows he died May 7, 1758, so that he had lived in America for nearly 30 years.\n\nHe was buried in the old cemetery of the Trinity Lutheran Church at Lancaster, Pa. A search for his grave was however unsuccessful, as the inscriptions on the very old headstones had been obliterated by the weather.\n\nJacob Tombaugh's will, dated May 5, 1758, and probated at Lancaster, Pa., May 18, 1758, follows in the form of an abstract:\n\nAbstract -- Will of Jacob Danbaugh\n\nIn Will Book 13, Vol. 1, page 235, (Register of Wills Office, Lancaster, Pa., I, Jacob Dannbaugh in the borough and county of Lancaster, and Province of Pennsylvania, Senior.\n\nItem--Two lbs. to and for the use and benefit of the Lutheran Church, in Duke Street, in the Borough of Lancaster.\n\nWife--Maria Elizabeth\n\nSon--Jacob to have 30 lbs. extra.\n\n(After provision for wife). Then everything divided equally among my six children, viz: Adam, Frederich, Maria Magdalena, Anna Maria, Maria Jacobina and Jacob.\n\nItem--My deceased son Adam's share to go to his four children: Margetha Barbara, Benjamin, George Frederich and Adam. And a bequest to Adam's wife, Eva Regina.\n\nExecutors--Bernard Hubley and Melchoir Snyder.\n\nWill signed--Jacob Danbog\n\nWe further learn from the records that on July 20, 1758, the executors of Jacob Tombaugh's will sold his home to Isaac Whitelock, and in Deed Book D., Page 479, Lancaster Co. Recorder's Office, we find that Maria Elizabeth Dombaugh acknowledges having received in full the legacy left her by her late husband, Jacob Tombaugh.\n\nSo closes the history of our emigrant ancestors, as we find nothing further about Maria Elizabeth.\n\nThe property owned by John Jacob Tombaugh in early times at Lancaster, Pa., is now in the built-up part of that city.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE COLLATERAL BRANCHES\n\nIt would appear from an examination of John Jacob Tombaugh's will, that he names his children therein in succession, according to their ages.\n\nThis conclusion is further strengthened by the marriages of their children, as the first three named in the will are married, while nothing indicates that the last three named in the will were married, when the will was made in 1758. Also in examining the ages of the children of Adam and Frederich in the birth registry of the Lutheran Church at Lancaster, Pa., we find those children of these two men whose ages are registered there. The ones whose ages are earliest are around 1750. While our Washington County, Pa., pioneer, who is according to tradition, Jacob, the younger's oldest child, was not born until 1761.\n\nTherefore, in writing the history of John Jacob Tombaugh's children, we assume Adam to have been the oldest. Adam's birth was before 1726, and he was born, probably in Holland, before the family came to America. We do not know lthe date of his marriage or the maiden name of his wife. Her name is given in the records as Eva Regina. Adam died May 29, 1755, and was buried in the old cemetery at the Trinity Lutheran Church in Lancaster, Pa. He died three years before his father John Jacob died, and Jacob directs in his will that Adam's share shall be divided equally among the four children of Adam and Eva Regina (Queen Eve).\n\nHere again John Jacob appears to have named these children in succession according to age. They are Margetha Barbara, Benjamin, born Jan. 21, 1749; George Frederich, and Adam, born Jan. 9, 1751.\n\nThe dates of Barbara's and Frederich's births, children of Adam, are unknown. We know nothing further of Adam's widow, Eva Regina, except that her father-in-law, John Jacob, made her a bequest in his will and that she owned a lot adjoining lands of John Jacob Tombaugh.\n\nBenjamin, the oldest son of Adam and Eva Regina, appears to have located in New Jersey. This conclusion is assumed from the fact that Simon Tombaugh, born 1770, in New Jersey, moved from that state to a Union Township, Ohio, in about 1822. The examination of the early records indicate Benjamin as the father of Simon. Simon Tombaugh was living in Ohio at the age of 80 as shown by the U. S. Census of 1850, as reported by Mrs. Alfred H. Beach, a genealogist of Wyoming. Simon Tombaugh's wife's name was Hannah, and she was 60 years old in 1850. Their children were Elizabeth, 29; George, 27; Catherine, 25; Mary, 25; Ellen, 22; Henry, 18; Henry Hart, 8, and Jackson Lucas, 18, in 1850. None of this family are known to be in Ohio in recent years.\n\nGeorge Frederich TOMBAUGH, son of Adam and Eva Regina, is doubtless the man who shows in the Archives of the Revolution from York County, Pa., as Frederich Dambach. Nothing further is known respecting him. But eight men of the name of Dambach were soldiers in the Civil War; two of them named Frederich. It is possible some of these are George Frederich's descendants. This is not certain as there is a Dambach family in Europe, judging by the name a mixed Holland and German family; from the Holland Dam, an impeded stream, and Bach, German for brook.\n\nAdam, probably the youngest son of Adam and Eva Regina, is known to have been in the Revolution as Adam Dambach, from Lancaster Co., Pa.\n\nOn Aug. 29, 1780, Adam Dambach married Susanna Funk, a Mennonite. Adam Dambach owned property in Lancaster County, Pa., and was a shoemaker by trade. He died in 1803.\n\nThere were three children in this family--Adam, Barbara and Susanna.\n\nThe son of Adam, the third of the name in this line, was not of age in 1803, when his father died. In 1815 he purchased land in Manor Township, Lancaster County, Pa. There were three sons in this family--Martin, Amos and Adam, the fourth in the line of that name. From these are descended the Dombach family which now number about three hundred individuals in Lancaster County, Pa., and elsewhere. Such of the history of the Dombach family, not gleaned from the records, was sent by Mr. Henry S. Dombach, a member of the Dombach family.\n\nThe second son of John Jacob and Maria Elizabeth Tombaugh was Frederich, according to a census return from Georgetown, Md., taken Aug. 22, 1776, when Frederich then lived there. He gave his age as fifty years. Therefore he was born in 1726, very likely in Holland and was two years old when the journey was made to America. From the registry of the Lancaster, Pa., Mennonite Church, established in 1736, it is shown that Frederich Dannbach, on Feb. 9, 1746, married Elizabeth Spanseiler.\n\nFrederich was a cooper by trade, but appears to have abandoned his trade and became an innkeeper at Lancaster. His name is found quite often in business transactions in the records of Lancaster County, Pa.; and about 1750 he spells his name Tombaugh, the first time the name is found under that spelling. The last time his name is found at Lancaster, Pa., is in 1770, when he satisfies a mortgage.\n\nBut, as stated herein, he was living in Georgetown, Md., in 1776, where his name was spelled by the enumerator as Donbock, but the name of his wife and names and succession of his children establish the identity of the family.\n\nAbout 1880, an agent who gave his name as Danley, visited some of the Tombaughs of Washington County, Pa. He claimed relationship with them, stating that they were descended from Jacob Tombaugh and he from Frederich; but that Frederich had made an alteration in his name and that he, the agent, went by the name of Danley. A check on this man's statement in some measure confirms it.\n\nIt appears that Frederich had taken the early spelling, Danbach or Donbach; had retained the first element of the name but had changed the bach part to ley, creating the name Donley or Danley. As neither the name of Frederich or any of his four sons show as Tombaugh or similar spelling, in the U. S. census of 1790, a search of that census shows Frederich Donally in Cumberland County, Pa. Further search shows his name there in 1779 as Frederich Donley; also he is shown for two year's service in the Revolution, where the name is spelled Donelly. Unfortunately no record is found of this family in the Court House records of Cumberland County, Pa. Also in the Pennsylvania Archives is found the name of Michael Donly, but whether this is Michael Tombaugh, son of Frederich, is unknown.\n\nWhat we know of Frederich TOMBAUGH's wife and children follows:\n\nHis wife, Elizabeth's age, in 1776, was forty-eight, according to the Georgetown, Md. census.\n\nThe children of Frederich and Elizabeth were: Maria Magdalene, born March 12, 1748; Johann Frederich, born January 20, 1751; Adam, born January 15, 1754; Elizabeth, born April 10, 1756; John Frederich, born November 19, 1757; Michael, born March 4, 1761; Johann Frederich, January 15, 1764; Anna Maria, born February 14, 1770. These names of Frederich and Elizabeth's children are from the birth registry of the Lancaster, Pa., Lutheran Church. It will be observed that there are three children in this list, named Johann Frederich. Where names are so duplicated in a family the presumption is that the ones first named died young.\n\nThere is one child of this family shown in the Georgetown, Md., census whose name is not found in the Lutheran birth registry at Lancaster, Pa. His name was Caltron, his age in 1776 is given as eight years; also a daughter, Drucilla, aged two years, and born after the family left Lancaster, Pa. Nothing more is known of the daughters of this family. Of the sons, Adam, the oldest of the sons of Frederich and Elizabeth, lived to maturity. From tradition it appears Adam was a seaman, and he is doubtless the Adam Tombaugh who was living in Brownsville, Pa., in 1809, and some of whose business papers were found among papers of like nature belonging to the first George Tombaugh of Washington County, Pa. His name was not his signature, but was spelled Tombaugh, by a certain Henry Wise. Whether Adam's own signature would be Tombaugh or Donley, we do not know; neither have we any further knowledge of this man.\n\nFrederich Tombaugh, Jr., son of Frederich and Elizabeth, does not appear to have been with the family at Georgetown, Md. He is probably the Frederich Tombaugh who shows in the Revolution from York County, Pa., in 1783, and for two other years not dated in the Archives of Pennsylvania.\n\nOf the other two sons of Frederich and Elizabeth, Michael, under the name of Donley, may be the one in the War of 1812. Of Caltron, nothing further is known, nor is anything known further respecting the daughters of Frederich and Elizabeth.\n\nOf the three daughters of John Jacob and Elizabeth Maria Tombaugh, the oldest from her father's will appears to have been married, but of the other two daughters, Jacobina Maria and Anna Maria, we have no further knowledge. In concluding this chapter of scanty and perhaps inaccurate history, an estimate of the number of descendants of John Jacob and Elizabeth Maria Tombaugh, is given. There appears to have been thirteen of the third generation, children of Adam Frederich and Jacob, who may have become heads of families. Supposing the sisters of the second generation to have the same number of children, gives a total of twenty-six heads of families in the third generation. Striking the average number of the descendants of Adam, of Lancaster County, Pa., and George, of Washington County, Pa., gives 500 each. This multiplied by the twenty-six of their generation, gives a grand total of possibly 13,000 descentants for our earliest ancestor.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nJACOB TOMBAUGH - SECOND GENERATION\n\nConcerning this man we have not much information. If we are right in the assumption that John Jacob Tombaugh names his children in his will in succession, according to their ages, then Jacob Tombaugh is the youngest son of John Jacob and Maria Elizabeth Tombaugh.\n\nWe do not know the exact date of Jacob Tombaugh's birth, but as his brother Frederich was born in 1726, and there are three sisters between him and Jacob, Jacob's birth would not be at an earlier date than the earlier seventeen-thirties. As no guardian shows for Jacob in Lancaster, after his father's death, in 1758, it is evident that Jacob was of age at that date. This would put his birth before 1737. In his father's will Jacob is the favored heir, as he receives an additional bequest of thirty-five pounds above the equal division of the estate among the six heirs. We do not find his name in the tax lists of Lancaster, Pa., which is good evidence that he left there soon after his father's death. His marriage occurred probably about 1760. We do not know his wife's first name, but her maiden name was Redd. It appears certain that she was a sister of that Nathaniel Redd, who in 1787, came from the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia to Washington County, Pa., and whose daughter Mary Ann, born 1770, married a Myers, and their son, George Myers, married Sarah Tombaugh, a grand-daughter of the Jacob Tombaugh of this sketch. There seems no doubt but what this family lived in Pennsylvania. But it is uncertain where they lived in the state.\n\nFamily tradition is to the effect that Jacob Tombaugh was a soldier of the Revolution. There were traditions that he was with Washington's army in the Valley Forge winter encampment. But there being no lists of the men in that encampment, we are uncertain about the tradition.\n\nIn Pennsylvania Archives, 3rd Series, Vol. XXIII, Page 459, Jacob Tombaugh, Private, April 22, 1778; Capt. John Whetzell's Co.; Col. Daniel McFarland's Regiment, ranging in Monongahela and Ohio Counties, now largely Allegheny, Washington and Greene Counties, Pa., and the panhandle of West Virginia. From April 22nd to July 25th, 1778, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThere is another entry in the Archives about Jacob, but it is practically the same as the above.\n\nThe tradition is that this ancestor died in the Revolution, and as we do not find his name in the Archives after July 25, 1778, the natural conclusion would be that his death occurred not long after that date. As to where Jacob or his wife died, or are buried, we have no knowledge.\n\nEfforts to find records about Jacob Tombaugh have been made in all the old county courts of southern Pennsylvania, northern Maryland, and of the counties in Virginia near the mouth of the Shenandoah, but unsuccessfully.\n\nBut in Jacob's times in the newer settlements, records were often incomplete in court, and few, if any, churches in central Pennsylvania have registries extending so far in the past.\n\nBut the question arises in the lack of direct records, how may we descendants of the pioneer, George Tombaugh, of Washington County, Pa., feel a reasonable certainty that the Lancaster County, Pa., family is the continuance of our line from the above George into the past?\n\nFirst--Traditions remembered are that we are a family from the German Palatinate. John Jacob Tombaugh, of Lancaster, was from the Palatinate.\n\nSecond--It is recalled that the Tombaugh's ancestor came over in the ship Albany, and that then there were children in the family. John Jacob Tombaugh came in the ship Albany, and there were children in his family.\n\nThird--The Tombaughs are a Pennsylvania family. The name is not found in the Colonial or Revolutionary Archives of any other state than Pennsylvania. The emigrants, who came from foreign ports then, before landing, had to swear their allegiance to the English king. Their oaths are kept in Philadelphia, Pa., and published as Rupp's 30,000 names, and among them is only one that later took the spelling, Tombaugh, and that is John Jacob Tombaugh or Donbach.\n\nFourth--It is known the Tombaughs are of Pennsylvania-German origin. Therefore we should find the ancestors of the family in southeastern Pennsylvania, which we do, and this family only of the name.\n\nFifth--The name Tombaugh is unknown in Germany or Holland, and so far as can be determined, was unknown until it shows in Lancaster, Pa., about 1750, as an anglicized form of Tannbach.\n\nSixth--Of the men of this family, at Lancaster, who by reason of age, could have been George Tombaugh's father, there are four. John Jacob Tombaugh and his three sons--Adam, Frederich, and Jacob. But John Jacob died three years before George's birth, Adam five years before George's birth, and in March, 1761, Michael was born in Frederich's family, and George was born in August, 1761, and there is no George in Frederich's family. This leaves Jacob alone, who could be George Tombaugh's father, of this family.\n\nSeventh--Besides George Tombaugh, there was a Jacob and a Frederich Tombaugh in the Revolution. Tradition is that George's father was in the Revolution. The Frederich Tombaugh in the Revolution, is apparently a first cousin of George's s, son of Frederich Tombaugh, Sr. This leaves Jacob Tombaugh, alone of those in the Revolution, who could have been father to George.\n\nEighth--The fact that George Tombaugh was in Georgetown, Md., seemingly when his Uncle Frederich lived there, is significant. All these various incidents harmonize. Even the names of the brothers at Lancaster, Pa., have been remembered to the present.\n\nThe Myers family record Jacob's name.\n\nThe second George Tombaugh's family recall Frederich.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Matthias Tombaugh family recall an early Adam Tombaugh.\n\nTradition is to the effect that George and his brother Matthias were the only children of their parents, and from the tradition that a guardian was appointed over them during a time in their minority, it appears that their parents were both dead before these sons came to Washington County, Pa., sometime before the early part of 1782.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nGEORGE TOMBAUGH - THIRD GENERATION\n\nWe shall not attempt to chronicle the life of probably the most remarkable man of our clan. The man whose energy and business ability laid the foundation from which flowed much of the success of his descendants.\n\nWe give the inscription on George Tombaugh's headstone to show the dates of his birth and death: \"George Tombaugh, died the 5th day of November, 1822, aged 61 years, 2 months, 20 days.\" This shows his birth was August 15, 1761. His death, November 5, 1822.\n\nEvidently he was the oldest child of Jacob Tombaugh; his brother, Matthias, being younger.\n\nGeorge Tombaugh was born in Chambersburg, Pa., as the tradition is remembered by the writer, but this is not given as a certainty.\n\nFor a time during his minority, after his parents' death, he was under a guardian. He came to Washington County, Pa., from Georgetown, Md., and we find his uncle, Frederich Tombaugh, living in that town in 1776.\n\nIt seems probable that after Jacob's death, in the Revolution, that his sons, George and Matthias, may for a time have made their home with their uncle Frederich, at Georgetown, Md. This would be between 1778 and 1782.\n\nIt is related that when George and Matthias came to Washington County, Pa., they had when they came to the Monongahela River but one small piece of money, which George lost when crossing the river on the ferry. The date of this horrid catastrophe was before April 8, 1782.\n\nThis is the earliest definite date we have of this man in Washington County, Pa. At that date he was a soldier of the Revolution in Captain James Craven's company, 5th Battalion, Washington County Militia.\n\nIt is possible that he was here somewhat earlier than April, 1782, as his name is found in a list of Stockley's Rangers, 1778-1783, from Washington County, Pa., but the date he was in this organization is not given.\n\nGeorge Tombaugh's name also appears as a member of Captain George Meers' Company of Washington County Militia in the Revolution. Then his hame is found in Captain Bane's Company, Crawford Expedition. In this his name is spelled \"George Tompoh.\"\n\nThen he receives compensation for his services in the depreciated currency of the Colonies, and last under the spelling of \"George Tompoh\" on December 8, 1789, he was awarded by the Supreme Council of Pennsylvania certain compensations for his provisions while employed as a militiaman on the frontiers of Washington County and for a blanket, a packsaddle and two bags, lost on the expedition under Colonel Crawford in 1782, amounting to two pounds, seven shillings and sixpence.\n\nBut according to tradition, George Tombaugh's loss in the Crawford expedition came near being much greater than the articles he was compensated for. While retreating from the savages, one of George's comrades lagged behind until the Indians were near him. George tried to save his comrade, but so close were they pressed by the Indians, that George had to make good his own escape, and while doing so the wind blew his hat off and he had to march back from the Sandusky, Ohio valley to Washington County, Pa., in his bare head.\n\nAfter the close of the Revolution we learn nothing more of this man until 1785, when he is granted a tract of land by the State of Pennsylvania, containing 98-1/4 acres, located on Pigeon Creek. This tract was called \"Haw Bottom\" and the average price of that time was paid, 27-2/3 cents per acre. The deed is signed by Governor Peter Muhlenberg.\n\nAs stated, this tract of land was on Pigeon Creek, near the headwaters of what we now call the South Branch. It was named Pigeon Creek, because in early days large quantities of wild plums grew on the banks of the stream, and in the fall of the year vast flocks of the passenger pigeons would gather to feast on the wild plums.\n\nThis \"Haw Bottom\" tract has remained in the family since George Tombaugh received it from the State. The grant was named from the haw tree. Presumably numbers of them grew on the tract when it was patented.\n\nBut getting title to land in George Tombaugh's day does not seem to have been all of the difficulty. There were such chores to be done as cleaning the forests, grubbing out the stumps and brush, building the necessary buildings for people and live stock. Doubtless the homesteaders were cheered in their labors by the chorus of innumerable bird songsters in the sylvan forests. Very likely the ears of the new settlers were more attuned to hear the war whoop of prowling savages, than to the harmonies of nature, however beautiful.\n\nIt is related that after George Tombaugh and his wife had become domiciled in their home, one day they heard a snoring noise upstairs; suspicion came to their minds that an Indian had slipped upstairs and fallen asleep. Examination, however, found it was the house cat that was enjoying a snooze and not a savage.\n\nIn addition to the troubles common to all the new settlers, George appears to have had troubles of his own. It seems other parties wanted the land he had been granted. Doubtless knowing the rather superstitious nature of many of the Germans, these parties staged a ghost scene. At night they surrounded the house with whirligigs, but in a lull of their ghostly music, they heard the ominous click of a raising flint lock hammer and their party adjourned without waiting for a second to the motion. George had come to stay.\n\nThe record of the exact date of the marriage of George Tombaugh and Elizabeth Gardner, has been lost.\n\nThe marriage was likely about 1785. The inscription on Elizabeth Tombaugh's headstone follows: \"Died February the 9th day, A.D. 1832, aged 73 years, 11 months.\" This places her birth March 9, 1758; her death, February 9, 1832.\n\nShe was born near Winchester, Va., and remained there some time before coming to Washington County, Pa. She remembered the Shenandoah Valley. Her parents were from Germany. It is known that others of her family came to Washington County, Pa., but it is not known whether her parents came to that county. It appears certain that Catherine Gardner, a sister of Elizabeth Tombaugh, married John Horn, and through this relationship the Tombaughs are related to the Swaglers, the Huffmans, the Amwell Horns, and the Beallsville Millers.\n\nElizabeth Tombaugh was small in size but of quick movements, and she had one quality needed in a pioneer's wife--courage. It is related that on one occasion wolves attacked their calves. George objected to taking the chance of chasing the wolves off, but Elizabeth supplied herself with burning torches and scared the wolves away, so they got neither calves nor Elizabeth.\n\nGeorge Tombaugh did not confine his activities alone to his farm, but also engaged in merchandising. In those days the farm product west of the mountains in Pennsylvania had either to be shipped over the mountains on pack-horses or down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans, and from there by ship to the eastern cities.\n\nGeorge Tombaugh would buy farm product and take it across the mountains by pack-horses to Baltimore and possibly to Philadelphia. His principal commodity on the return trip was salt, which was then produced sparingly, if at all, west of the mountains.\n\nOn one of his trips he was held up by a pair of robbers, at a place in the mountains known as the \"Shades of Death.\" He was unarmed, but the place being very gloomy, he pointed the butt of his black-snake whip at the robbers. They conceiving it was a rifle, made haste to leave.\n\nBesides these activities, George, in common with most of the other farmers of those times, very likely ran a distillery, and there was a story that he was in the Whiskey Insurrection.\n\nAs explained, the farmers in this area, because of distance to ship their product, had to condense their product as much as possible. The result was grains were distilled into liquor, and when Congress placed a tax on distilled products, it was a serious blow to the farmers west of the mountains, and they rose against it. It is related that the Federal officers had secured all connected in this affair, but three men.\n\nWhen the officers called, these three men were in an orchard back of the house, with an arrangement with the women in the house, if the officers called, to wave a tablecloth out of the window.\n\nThe names of these three men were Tombaugh, Letherman and Richardson. Whether their plan of escape succeeded we do not know.\n\nWhile George Tombaugh's ancestors, of the name, appear to have been town men, George's disposition towards agricultural life seems to have come from the Redds, who appear to have had lands in Virginia.\n\nAs time passed George added to his original tract, until at his death he owned over 400 acres in Pennsylvania.\n\nOne tract being on Pigeon Creek, the other on the National Road, about one and a half miles west of Scenery Hill, Washington County, Pa. Besides these two tracts, he owned a section of land in Stark County, Ohio. He appears, at times, to have owned other real estate, which he sold. In his church connections, the tradition is that in early life he was a Lutheran, but later in life his sympathies were with the Dunkards, of which church he was probably a member.\n\nThe John Spohn, who wrote his will, was likely that John Spohn who was for many years a minister in the Dunkard Church, and whose daughter, Rachel Spohn, later married Matthias, son of George Tombaugh.\n\nFrom his services in the Revolution, all of his descendants should be eligible to membership in the patriotic societies of the D. A. R. and the S. A. R. This should also be true from the services in the Revolution of George's father, Jacob Tombaugh, but in Jacob's case the proof would be less convincing.\n\nAfter the death of George Tombaugh, his wife, Elizabeth, lived for a time with her son, Matthias, but later lived with her son, George.\n\nBoth George and Elizabeth Tombaugh are buried on the \"Haw Bottom\" tract. The inscription on their headstones after a century, are still clear, and can be read without difficulty.\n\nRespecting the Matthias Tombaugh, brother of George, who came with him to Washington County, Pa., from Georgetown, Md., we quote from Byron E. Tombaugh's sketch of the family, in a Washington County history:\n\n\"The younger brother, Matthias, enlisted under General Harmer and participated in the defeat at Chillicothe. When the command was given to General St. Clair, Matthias remained with the army, and was killed in the disastrous campaign that succeeded.\"\n\nWill of George Tombaugh\n\nThe will of George Tombaugh, registered in Will Book No. 3, pages 520 and 521, Register's Office, Washington County, Pa., follows:\n\nIn the name of God Amen.

Elias P. Wise\n\nAccording to tradition, as it comes to me, the name of the emigrant member of the Wise family, was Adam. Hence like the race itself we begin with Adam.\n\nHe was born in Hessen-Darmstadt, Germany, in 1718. He married before coming to America. His wife's first name was Murialleas, whose family name is unknown.\n\nOne child, Andrew, was born six weeks before they took ship for America. As the child was weak and sickly the captain of the ship compelled them to make preparations for burial at sea, feeling assured that the child could not endure the rigors of a sea voyage. They made the preparations but the child lived, and died at the age of ninety-two years. I have this story from his own great-grandson./\n\nAdam and his wife settled near Hagerstown, Md. Here four more sons were born to them, named as follows: Peter, Frederick, Henry and Adam, Jr. The mother died young. Some time later the father married again, his wife's name this time being Catharine, whose family name is unknown. The family then moved to Washington County, Pennsylvania, and settled near the present location of Zollarsville.\n\nHere eight more children were born whose names follow: Jacob, Daniel, Abraham, Tobias, Mary, Mary Ann, Ulion and Judith.\n\nConsidering the emigrant Adam and his wives as the first generation the children of Adam would be counted as the second generation of the family in America. Of this second generation all the information I have is as follows: Andrew, the one born in Germany, went west in his later life and died in Indiana, where some of his descendants still live. Peter, the first born in America, lived a large part of his life in Washington County, Pa., but later he and all of his family except one moved to Stark County, Ohio, from which place some of them scattered to other regions. Frederick remained in Washington County. He founded the town of Fredericktown, Pa., on the Monongahela River, and indicated his antagonism to alcoholic stimulants and the liquor traffic by incorporating in every deed a provision against the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. Henry settled in Virginia and either he or his half brother Daniel, who also settled in that state, was the grandfather of Henry A. Wise of Civil War fame. Adam, Jr., remained in Washington County, Pa., where many of his descendants are now living.\n\nOf the remaining eight children, constituting Adam Wise's second family, I know little except the one fact already mentioned that Daniel settled in Virginia.\n\nAdam, the father, died June 9, 1781, at the age of sixty-three years.\n\nTracing our genealogy now from the second generation, we follow the line from Peter, the first born in America. He was born in 1757. His wife's name was Magdala, or Mary, Miller. His thirteen children were born in Washington County. They constitute the third generation of our family. According to his will, which is on record in the files of the probate office of Canton, Stark County, Ohio, the names of these children were as follows: Daniel, Andrew, Peter, Adam, Abraham, Jacob, Catharine (Shidler), Susannah (Tombaugh), Hanna (Zollars), Molly (Bricker), Elizabeth (Smith), Rebecca (----). One child died in infancy. All of the twelve, but one, moved sooner or later to Stark County, Ohio. Hannah Zollars married and lived all of her life in Washington County, Pa.\n\nIt is in the third generation of the family that two contacts are made with the Tombaugh family. Daniel, the oldest, and Susannah, one of the younger members of the family, married Tombaughs. Daniel married Elizabeth, and Susannah Jacob Tombaugh. Whether these two persons were brother and sister is not definitely known to me, but presumably they were. The part of the remaining history which has the largest interest for me, as a member of the family, is that which follows through the line of Daniel, the oldest of the third generation.\n\nIt may not be amiss here to say that descendants of Peter, of the second generation, are pleased to say that we are all eligible for membership in either the Sons of American Revolution, or the Daughters of the American Revolution. Peter Wise served in the Lancaster County, Pa., Militia, as private under Captain Lutz, in 1782. The record is found in Pennsylvania Archives, 5th Series, Vol. 6, page 305.\n\nDaniel, oldest son of Peter Wise, was the first to go west. Daniel and Elizabeth Tombaugh were married in the spring of 1809. They made a journey to Ohio, on horseback, crossing the Ohio River at Steubenville, and settling where the town of Middlebranch is now located. Here they built a log cabin, cleared some ground and planted their first garden. In the autumn they returned to Washington County, Pa., to spend the winter with their relatives. Here, at some time during the winter, their first child was born, whom they named Peter, the same being the grandfather of ex-Senator Atlee Pomerene. The following spring they returned to Ohio. Life in the wilderness then began in earnest. In 1810 twin sons were born to them, whom they named George and Daniel. In the following year, 1811, the father built the grist mill, ever since known as Wise's mill. In 1813 another son was born whom they named Elias Tombaugh. Two daughters, Sarah and Annie, were born later, making a family of six children.\n\nAbout this time, Peter, Daniel's father, came to Ohio, bringing other members of his family with him. Sometime between 1813 and 1816 a business transaction took place between father and son, by which the mill and certain other properties went into the hands of the father, Peter. In 1816 Daniel Wise died, leaving Elizabeth Tombaugh Wise a widow with six small children. The father, Peter Wise, and Mathias Tombaugh, brother of the widow, became executors of Daniel Wise's estate.\n\nIn 1821, October 2, the will of Peter Wise, of the second generation, father of Daniel, was written. The will indicates that he made the children of Daniel, being his grandchildren, co-heirs with his own children. By this will, the mill property went into the possession of Peter's two sons, Adam and Abraham, brothers of Daniel, who built it. January 5, 1855, the mill was conveyed to Adam's son, Aaron Wise. Aaron Wise died in 1859. At this time the mill went into the hands of George Wise, son of Daniel, who built it. George conveyed it to his son, Peter, and at his death the mill was acquired by his brother, Adam, who held it until the year of the writing of this account, viz., 1928, when it was sold to E. C. Baker for residence purposes. It thus remained in the possession of the one family one hundred and seventeen years.\n\nReturning again to our common ancestor, Daniel Wise, of the third generation. He died in 1816, leaving his wife a widow with six small children. The fact has already been noted that their grandfather made them co-heirs with his own children. I wish to record at this point some information, if it can be obtained, of the rearing of these orphan children.\n\nAfter some years of widowhood our grandmother married John Hoover. Of him nothing is known to me except that the correspondence of Reno G. Tombaugh of Washington, County, Pa., with the family of Herbert Hoover of present Presidential fame, indicates a possible connection between this Hoover and ancestors of Herbert Hoover, who lived in Knox County, Ohio. To this union were born three daughters, whose names were Malinda, Lucinda and Lydia.\n\nOf these half-sisters of the family I know little. Malinda and Lucinda married men named Shipley and Essig. They went to Indiana to live and further information is sought concerning them. Lydia died young.\n\nWe will now follow the descendants of our common ancestors, Daniel Wise and Elizabeth Tombaugh. They had six children, four sons and two daughters.\n\nPeter, fourth generation, oldest son of Daniel Wise and Elizabeth Tombaugh. Born (----); died (----); married, (1) Esther Baum.
