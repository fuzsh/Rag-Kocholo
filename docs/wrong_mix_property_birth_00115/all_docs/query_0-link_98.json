        "text": "Some Came Running is the story of US Army veteran and two-time author, Dave Hirsh (Frank Sinatra). Bitter from being sent to a boys’ home by his brother at age 12, Dave’s return to his hometown after 16 years shakes up the small town of Parkman, Indiana.\n\nUS 421, Milton, Kentucky\n\nIn the film’s opening scene, Dave is on a bus heading to the fictional town of Parkman, Indiana. Drunk, he was put on a bus in Chicago. Through the bus windows, the “Long View Inn” is barely visible.\n\nIn reality, the bus was heading down US 421 in Milton, Kentucky, heading toward the Milton-Madison Bridge. This building appears to be a private home, located on the bend.\n\nAlong US 421 in Milton, Kentucky.\n\nApproaching the Milton-Madison Bridge.\n\nMain Street (SR 56) – Madison, Indiana\n\nIn this scene, the bus is traveling through “Parkman, Indiana.”\n\nIt was filmed along Main Street (State Road 56) in Madison. The corner building above, to the right of the bus driver, seems to have been a pharmacy. It is now a nightclub/bar called The Electric Lady.\n\nCourthouse – Madison, Indiana\n\nIn this scene, Dave is surprised to find he has a traveling companion, a lovable floozy named Ginny, played by Shirley MacLaine.\n\nThe scene was filmed on the east side of Madison, with the courthouse in the background. Through the bus windows in the photo above, the building that now houses a Dollar General, is visible.\n\nThe Central Hotel – Madison, Indiana\n\nDave arrives in town, and immediately finds lodging at the “Parkman Hotel.”\n\nThis probably was a hotel at one time. I “think” it currently isn’t, I have seen no listings for it as a hotel, just a bar/tavern, called the Central Hotel.\n\nMain Street (SR 56) – Madison, Indiana\n\nDave’s brother Frank is quite shook up about Dave’s arrival in town. Feeling somewhat guilty about placing his younger brother in a boys’ home (yet all the while completely justifying doing so), Frank fears that Dave’s presence will break down the prominent social status he and his wife Agnes have worked so hard to attain. Frank is the owner of a jewelry store bearing his name, which he inherited from his father-in-law.\n\nThe location for Hirsh Jewelers was along Main Street in Madison. It is now a bookstore called Village Lights.\n\nMadison, Indiana\n\nDave also wastes no time finding the local drinking establishment, hanging out with people more of his own social status. He heads to Smitty’s Bar.\n\nYou won’t be bellying up to the bar now, just a massage table. This appears to be a place called Complementary Health.\n\nDave wastes no time in causing trouble, getting into a fight outside Smitty’s Bar.\n\nThis scene actually did take place along the side of the building that is now Complementary Health.\n\nDave is befriended by local professional gambler, Bama Dillert, played by Dean Martin. The house on the left, below, was used for Bama’s house, and exterior and interior scenes were filmed there.\n\nThe cool thing about this house, is it is for sale, and on the Century 21 website it shows interior photos (thanks to Pat for the suggestion to check the website). Not a set…the scenes at Bama’s house were filmed inside. We are tempted to go to an open house!\n\nIn this scene, Frank Hirsh is spending a little quality time with his secretary, parked down by the river.\n\nThey are driving along Vaughn Drive in Madison, following the Ohio River, this one facing east.\n\nAnd now facing west.\n\nParker Auditorium, Hanover College, Indiana\n\nIn this scene, Ginny, who is madly in love with Dave, is on her way to see her rival for Dave’s affections, Gwen French. Gwen and her father, Robert, are prominent citizens of Parkman. Robert is a professor at the local university and Gwen is a schoolteacher who is a big fan of Dave’s two books. Anxious to meet Dave and discuss his work, Gwen and Dave are immediately smitten with each other. Gwen encourages Dave regarding his third story, and helps to get it published.\n\nGinny is on her way to (nicely) confront Gwen about her intentions with Dave and to back out if Gwen wants Dave. Gwen, fearing a commitment to Dave due to his lower class associates, drinking, and gambling, falsely assures Ginny she has no interest in Dave, other than professional.\n\nThis scene was filmed at Hanover College, just west of Madison in Hanover, Indiana. From the same spot, trees now obscure the Parker Auditorium, visible in the above scene. I have also included a photo of Parker Auditorium, below.\n\nMain Street (SR 56), Madison, Indiana\n\nBama and Dave are driving through town, while preparation is underway for a local carnival.\n\nThe scene was shot on the east side of Madison, along Main Street.\n\nOhio Theatre, Main Street, Madison, Indiana\n\nMoffett Cemetery, Milton, Kentucky\n\nIn the interest of not revealing the ending, I won’t discuss the plot details any further…though it is obviously a funeral scene. It was filmed across the Ohio River in Milton, Kentucky, at the Moffett Cemetery.\n\nIt didn’t take us too long to find the area of the cemetery where this was filmed, it was fairly small, we could see it was close to the edge of the cliff, and there was a prominent monument in one scene, though we weren’t sure if it was a prop. There is a monument in the shot with Dean Martin that was a prop.\n\nIt was a lot neater, with no overgrowth 51 years ago!\n\nWe looked out for this area, unsure of whether this monument was also a movie prop.\n\nIt was real!\n\nThis view overlooks the Ohio River, with the Madison-Milton Bridge (US 421) to the right.\n\nPat did the honors of stepping into Frank Sinatra’s role.\n\nThe monument behind Dean Martin is a prop.\n\nMain Street (SR 56) – Madison, Indiana\n\nAs we headed back into Madison, we noticed this marker commemorating “Some Came Running” and its stars.\n\nAnd for those looking for some interesting tidbits, I have read where Frank Sinatra dreaded his time in Madison. He was not comfortable or happy with the idea of being stuck in such a small “hick” town. To help him tolerate his time in Madison, Frank wanted his best friend, Dean Martin, to accompany him and play professional gambler, Bama Dillert.\n\nDean was more than happy to oblige for his friend, and in fact, greatly enjoyed his time in Madison. Hailing from Steubenville, Ohio, Dean felt very much at home in the small, Midwest town of Madison. I have been to Steubenville also, and it is very similar to Madison."
