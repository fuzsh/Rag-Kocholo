RICHARD D. McCARTHY OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the New York Times, in its lead editorial Friday morning, makes several pertinent points regarding the decisions now fac- ing the administration in light of the apparent lack of a response from Hanoi to our peace offensive. The Times emphasizes that \"many factors counsel patience. The 2-month absence of North Vietnamese army units from combat in South Vietnam?which may signal a Hanoi desire to continue the diplomatic exchanges?is one such factor. Far more important is that fact that the military balance in South Viet- nam has been fundamentally trans- formed in the past year.\" The decisive new element, the Times points out, is the ninefold increase in American troops in South Vietnam. Meanwhile?. The newspaper observes? it has become evident that the bombing of North Vietnam failed to achieve either of its original two objectives. It failed to slow down the infiltration of men and supplies, which increased as the bombing intensified. And it failed to bring Hanoi to the confer- ence table. Warning against further escalation of the war, the Times warns: A further large-scale buildup would not end the military statement in South Viet- nam. As in the past, it would be matched by increased Vietcong recruiting, infiltration, and additional North Vietnamese units and ultimately?if the ground war expanded into Laos, Cambodia, and, perhaps, North Viet- nam?by the entrance of Chinese troops into the conflict. Apparently alluding to a letter from Gen. James M. Gavin, appearing in the latest Harper's magazine and to which I alluded in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of January 18, 1966, the Times concludes as follows: At the present, American forces are secure in their coastal positions and cannot be in- voluntarily dislodged. General Gavin's re- cent advice not to expand the war but to continue efforts to negotiate the peace, has the force of logic on its side. Under leave to extend my remarks, I include here the New York Times lead editorial of Friday, January 20: THE VIETNAM DECISION Failure of the Johnson peace offensive thus far to bring about formal negotiations with Hanoi inescapably raises the question: what course should the United States now follow? Much depends on Washington's evaluation of Hanoi's ambiguous public and private re- plies and on the official estimate of how long it is safe to keep the bombers grounded. Is Hanoi holding out for concessions? Or is Hanoi seeking to avoid a conference out of the conviction that the United States will get tired and withdraw? President Johnson expressed the latter belief yesterday. But his conclusion from this remains unclear, since he also said: \"The door of peace must be kept wide open.\" Many factors counsel patience. The 2- month absence of North Vietnamese Army units from combat in South Vietnam?which may signal a Hanoi desire to continue the diplomatic exchanges?is one such factor. Far more important is the fact that the mili- tary balance in South Vietnam has been fun- damentally transformed in the past year. The decisive new element has been the ninefold buildup of American troops in South Vietnam to a strength of about 190,- 000. South Vietnamese armed forces, in- cluding militia and police, now exceed 635,- 000. With South Korean, New Zealand, and Australian units, there are upward of 850,- 000 men in the field. And the backing of American air and naval strength gives these forces devasting firepower and unparalleled mobility. This buildup, in the words of President Johnson's state of the Union message, has put the enemy on notice that \"time is no longer on his side\" and that a Vietcong vic- tory now is \"out of reach.\" Meanwhile, it has become evident that the bombing of North Vietnam failed to achieve either of its original two objectives. It failed to slow down the infiltration of men and supplies, which increased as the bombing intensified. And it failed to bring Hanoi to the conference table. The bombing did force North Vietnam to turn from Peiping to Mos- cow for antiaircraft missiles and, even more important, for massive economic and techni- cal aid. But this unexpected dividend argues for a continued suspension of the bombing, rather than for its resumption. As White House Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy recently observed: \"It has been made clear to us over a long period of time that the Soviet Government hopes there can be a peaceful settlement.\" And Moscow has also made it clear that peace efforts cannot be carried on while North Vietnam is being bombed. The critical decision that confronts Presi- dent Johnson, therefore, is not whether to resume the early bombing of the north-- which even Republican leaders no longer press?but how to conduct the war in the south while continuing the probes for peace. The ground and air war in South Vietnam undoubtedly will resume fully after the lunar new year truce. What the President now must decide is whether to escalate that war in the south to a wholly new level by yielding to military requests for a doubling of Ameri- can forces. Such a move would finally con- vert the struggle from a Vietnamese conflict into an American war against Asians. A further large-scale buildup would not end the military stalemate in South Vietnam. As in the past, it would be matched by in- creased Vietcong recruiting, infiltration of additional North Vietnamese units and ulti- mately?if the ground war expanded into Laos, Cambodia, and, perhaps, North Viet- nam?by the entrance of Chinese troops into the conflict. At present, American forces are secure in their coastal positions and cannot be in- voluntarily dislodged. General Gavin's re- cent advice, not to expand the war but to continue efforts to negotiate the peace, has the force of logic on its side. The Late Honorable John Taber SPEECH OF HON. 0. C. FISHER OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, January 12, 1966 Mr. FISHER. Mr. Speaker, the late John Taber was a most valuable Member A295 of this body. He served with great dis- tinction for nearly 40 years. As a mem- ber of the Committee on Appropriations, once as chairman, he became known as the watchdog of the Treasury. In that capacity he was instrumental in saving American taxpayers untold billions of dollars. It is doubtful if any one Mem- ber has ever done more in that respect. John Taber was indeed a great Ameri- can. He was devoted to the cause of good government, of sensible restraint in the function of the Central Government, and of those fundamentals which make the competitive free enterprise succeed. During his long period of distinguished service Mr. Taber did more than his share in the preservation of our institu- tions. We need more men of his dedi- cation if our -Republic is to be preserved. An Intern's Views EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. TENO RONCALIO OF WYOMING IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. RONCALIO. Mr. Speaker, Mem- bers of Congress have had numerous oc- casions to utilize the fine services of sum- mer interns and are particularly grateful for the enthusiams and interest they bring to their responsibilities. Last summer I was pleased to have the services of Dan Spangler of Cody, Wyo., as a summer intern in my office. Dan, the son of Judge and Mrs. J. O. Spangler of Cody graduated in 1964 from the Uni- versity of Wyoming with a degree in political science. He was attending Stanford University when he was selected as an intern for the Wyoming congres- sional office. After a most satisfactory summer of employment Dan enrolled at the Uni- versity of London under a Rotary Inter- national scholarship. His exposure there to students from many countries has broadened his outlook on American for- eign policy. At a time when the senti- ments of some college students have created apprehension in the minds of many Americans, I am happy to note his thoughtful and responsible approach to this serious matter. I respectfully recommend his essay on Vietnam to the consideration of my colleagues as a worthy example of the mature outlook youth can offer when stimulated to take an active interest in the affairs of gov- ernment. His essays follows: j- VIETNAM The greatest problem of our time is how to achieve world peace. A world war could destroy civilization as we know it. Nuclear weapons have enabled the two great powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, to achieve a state of mutual deterrence. The threat to peace does not come from any di- rect conflict between these two states but from the possibility that they will become involved in what would begin as a limited war, then expand into a regional war until the interests of these two powers were di- rectly involved, leaving no other alternative but a world conflagration. The existence of Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 .INSSI*111141 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 A296 CONGRESSIONAL large numbers of new, unstable states creates a number of opportunities for limited wars to expand into regional and world wars. In this situation, it is essential that the United States maintain flexible policies so that an escalated war will not be the only alternative. Before the present war widens any further, it is essential that the U.S. Congress conduct a public debate to explore fully the alterna- tives to a wider war and to insure that U.S. policy in southeast Asia expresses the will of tile American people, historically, the area now know as North Vietnam has been the smallest but most densely populated sector of Indochina. North Vietnam was once controlled by China but in 939 Al). its people revolted and estab- lished their own kingdom. Due to popula- tion pressures and poor agricultural land, after 1069 the North Vietnamese advanced steadily into neighboring lands of the south and west, overrunning large portions of what is now South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This expansion continued for 800 years until it was halted by the imposition of French colonialism. After the Japanese invaded the area during World War H, French authority was never reestablished in the north and the northern drive to the south and west began once more. The French attempted to arrest this drive until their defeat at Dienbienphu in 1954. The Geneva Agreement of that year, which was never signed by the United States, called for a united Vietnam within 1 year. The agreement was never carried out, mainly because it was unrealistic and dangerous. Till: DIFFERENT FACTIONS Lt is unrealistic to attempt to unify areas which offer as many contrasts as North and South Vietnam. Life in North Vietnam is still greatly influenced by Chinese ways due to China's former domination cif the north and to the close proximity of the north to China. Geographically, North Vietnam is more closely linked with China than with South Vietnam. The north has adopted China's subtropical agricultural methods while the tropical south has a different way of life. There has long been a rivalry be- tween Hanoi. a former Chinese capital and a cultural and administrative center, on one hand, and Saigon, a French-created port, commercial, end agricultural marketing city on the other. Communications have never been good between the two areas. During World War 11, Hanoi took its orders from the Vichy regime while Saigon was the center for the Ganllists. In opposition to French colonial rule, nationalist leaders in the north identified with the Kuomintang in China while the Cao Gal and. Hoa Hoa fac- tions led the nationalists in the south. With Lhese profound differences in the develop- ment of North and South Vietnam, it is un- realistic to suppose that they could form a viable state. THE AREA The unification of Vietnam under the ag- gressive Communist regime of the north would be dangerous for the neighboring states; as well, which have riot forgotten the earlier period of Vietnamese invasion and domination. For, with the seizure of the. rich rice lands in South Vietnam, the well- trained and equipped northern army would. easily have Laos and Cambodia at its mercy.. haos is the largest, least populated country in. tedochina, and it has the least capacity to rieread itself. The country is deeply divided. ethnically an politically. Cambodia is also sparsely populated and is in a vulnerable strategic position. Ships using the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penis, on the Mekong River, have to pass through South Vietnam. The Mekong Delta is open to attack from coastal and interior routes which can be commanded from North Vietnam and Laos. Thus, it is essential to Use security of Cambodia that South Viet- nam and Laos are in friendly hands. To the RECORD ? APPENDIX January 24, _;966 POVERTY TIIE REAL EVIL Any successful foreign policy must be de- fined in terms of national interests and backed with adequate power. An American policy aimed at preserving the territorial integrity of Asian states while assisting in their economic and social development is In the American interest. The question that the American people and the U.S. Congress must now answer is whether or not that policy is backed by adequate power. There is no doubt that the United States ? is able to apply enough military power to prevent an overt Communist takeover. But this tactic, by itself, will never bring stability to the region. American foreign policy in southeast Asia must receive more support from another form of power, which is the ability of the United States to encourage social and economic development. Stability can be achieved only if progress is made in this area, for poverty is a necessary pre- requisite for the success of Communist revolutionary guerrilla warfare. Every successful Communist revolution, whether in Russia, China, Cuba, or Indo- china, has been based upon impoverished masses. The Vietcong would have collapsed long ago without support from the people in the countryside. It is futile for the United States to remain in South Vietnam unless a massive effort is made to unite the South Vietnamese people behind their government. This task cannot wait until the war is over because the war will never end until social and economic changes are made. Besides intensifying our efforts in present developmental programs, we should give re- newed thought to the development of the Mekong River,, which affects the livelihood of the entire Indochinese peninsula. The political fragmentation and strategic weak- nesses of northeast Thailand, Cambodia, South Vietnam, and Laos are due partly to obstacles which make the Mekong difficult to navigate. By helping the southeast Asian nations to harness and develop this vital waterway, the United States could score a great victory in the battle for peaceful change by stimulating the imagination and loyalties of people in the most troubled parts of the region and by providing the oppor- tunity for a better life to millions of Asians. CAUTION In clefendi:ng our national interests, we must proceed with restraint arid must view the scene from the vantage point of other nations, as well as our own. We must not allow ourselves to be placed in a position in which we no longer have any reasonable alternatives. As regard our policies in southeast Asia, the words of Bolingbroke are particularly relevant: \"Victories, that bring honor to the arms, may bring shame to the councils, of a na- tion. To win a battle, to take a town, is the glory of a general, and of an army. * * But the glory of a nation is to proportion the ends she pro :poses, to her interests and her strength; the means she employs, to the ends she proposes; and the vigor she exerts. to both.\" This is a time when momentous decisions must be made concerning future A mericon policies in southeast Asia. The decisions we make can be of vital importance to the fu- ture of mankind. Therefore, in this vesslon of congressional debate, let all opinions he voiced, let all factors be considered, and let us coldly calculate the effects of our past, present, and future actions. A:nd finally, let us remember the judgment of our posterity with the words of Abraham Lincoln: \"Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.\" west of Laos lies Thailand. The bulk of the Lao people live in Thailand, which has much reason to fear a Vietnamese-Laos combina- tion. In addition, from 50,000 to 80,000 pro-Communist refugees from Vietnam have settled in northeast Thailand since World War II. The instability and remoteness of north- eastern Thailand make it imperative that the northeastern border is occupied by a stable Laos. These compounded problems of na- tional security would be the consequences of a Vietnam united under a Communist re- gime. The expansionist tendencies of a Com- munist-controlled Vietnam would engulf the entire Indochinese Peninsula in large-scale warfare. As the war would expand, China would become more anxious to protect its borders and would play a larger part in the struggle. Eventually, the vital interests of such powers as India, Indonesia, and the So- viet Union might become directly involved. The security of Australia and New Zealand, both close American allies, depends: upon a stable situation in southeast Asia, as World War II demonstrated. Britain is pledged to the defense of Malaysia and could become drawn into a wider struggle. If the even- tually victorious powers in southeast Asia maintained close relations with china or fell under Chinese domination, the United States could :be subject to a grave threat. THE CIIINA ROLE It is difficult to tell if the Chinese always mean what they say but the Chinese leaders have pledged themselves to the destruction of the United States. In light of these pro- nouncements, the United States most keep a close watch on China, which is now .1 nuclear power. In the coming years, it may be ex- pected that China will achieve the capacity to deliver its nuclear weapons around the world. From our experience with the Soviet Union, it is clear that the best way to meet a nu- clear threat is with another nuclear threat. But, if southern Asia were in the control of hostile powers, the United States would face great problems in mounting a credible deter- rent to a Chinese nuclear force. Present-day missiles fired from the continental United States, can reach China only by crossing So- viet territory. This only in creases the danger that the Soviet Union would aline with China in a war against the United States. Although relations are tense between Russia and China, the Soviet Union has given no indication that it would prefer a non-Communist Chinese regime. BALANCE OF POWER Thus, the U.S. presence in Vietna:m can be seen as an effort at limiting the scope of armed conflict in southern Asia, to insure that the great powers are not drawn into an open conflict in a wider war. Such a wider war would be certain to result if the United States did liot provide a balance to the forces of North Vietnam. A balance of power strategy is utilized. to guarantee that no one power has enough strength to subdue the other states. Without the balance provided by the United States, and with North Viet- namese possession of the rich ricelands of South Vietnam, the balance in southeast Asia would be torn asunder. This would happen because the states of southeast Asia are so weak internally. But if the policies of the United States are suc- cessful, these countries will someday be able to stand on their own feet. Before this happens, great changes must take place for the area is woefully underdeveloped and many of the people lack any sense ol national identity and loyalty. These changes may come about in one of two ways- violently or peacefully. The Communists advocate violent change while the United States has always realized that peaceful change, through foreign aid and technical assistance, is in its best interests.

APPENDIX A297 Man Will Be Free EXTENSION OF REIVIAR OF HON. L. NIENDEL RIVERS OF SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the eyes of the world are fo- cused on the Far East today. For it is there that the question most sharply asked is: \"Will men be free or will men be slaves?\" And the answer from courageous men is that man will? live as a free individual. Mr. Speaker, the Honorable WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN DORN?my distin= guished colleague from South Carolina and a great American?underscored those points in a stirring speech January 23 at Taipei, Republic of China. His remarks are an inspiration to those who cherish freedom, a ray of hope to the nameless faces enslaved be- hind the Iron Curtain. His message was clear and should give pause for thought to those misguided despots laboring un- der the delusion that America is soft, or will fail her commitments in the Far East. His speech is of such import that I commend it for reading by the Members of the Congress. Under leave to extend my remarks in the Appendix of the RECORD, I hereby insert his message for the information of this body: MEN WILL BE FREE (Address by Congressman WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN DORN of South Carolina at the 12th annual Freedom Day Rally Taipei, the Republic of China, January 23) Mr. Chairman, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. I bring you the greetings and the admiration of the Congress of the United States and the American people. As a member of the advisory board of the Na- tional Captive Nations' Committee and on behalf of that committee I bring to you the best wishes of captive peoples all over the world. You, of the Republic of China, have won the enduring admiration of free peoples everywhere by your valiant and successful struggle to maintain the freedom of this island. You are the hope of freedom throughout the mainland. Your past is an inspiring saga of man's indomitable will to be free. Your present is a source of pride and hope to all who hate tyranny. Your future is nothing less than a promise to history. We gather here today to commemorate the courage of the 22,000 freedom fighters who defied tyranny and chose freedom instead. We gather here today to commemorate those throughout the world who have similarly struggled to escape terrorism and torture, those who continue the struggle for free- dom. We commemorate and pay homage to the millions who have died to preserve freedom. It is fitting and proper that we observe Freedom Day. May we be encouraged and inspired to go forth from this spot as the spark of a great crusade to free the world of enslavement and oppression. The valor of these 22,000 Chinese and Korean prisoners will remain forever an inspiration to those who cherish freedom. The eyes of the world are today focused on the Far East. For, as Abraham Lincoln said with reference to my own country, the world cannot continue half slave and half free. And it is here, in the Far East that the question is today being most sharply asked?will men be free or be slaves? It is here that the answer is being most plainly given. Men will be free. It will not be easy?and there is no rea- son to think that it will be quick?for free- dom faces a massive challenge in Asia, a challenge led by those as determined as they are evil. There will be disappointments, frustrations, and setbacks in the future as there have been in the past. But men will be free. They will be free because the determina- tion on the side of freedom is inexhaust- ible?and you are the proof of that. They will be free because the resources of the side of freedom are more than sufficient and the will to use those resources is as firm as rock. Let no one be in any doubt about the commitment of the United States to the cause of freedom in Asia. The propaganda from Hanoi and Peiping expresses the con- stant hope that the determination of the United States will weaken, that the effort of the United States will falter. They are en- gaging in a dangerous delusion if they believe their own propaganda. They are making the fatal mistake of tyrants when they misin- terpret a freeman's love of peace. Love of peace does not mean that we will meekly submit to tyranny. Love of peace does not mean that we will purchase it at the cost of freedom?ours or anyone else's. As Presi- dent Johnson said earlier this month in his state of the Union message, \"We do not in- tend to abandon Asia to conquest.\" The Far East is the key area of the world geographically, economically, and politically. If totalitarianism should conquer the Far East, then all of Asia would fall. With Asia In Communist hands, Africa would be con- quered. Western Europe would be out- flanked and the forces of freedom would be in grave peril. In Asia there are vast untapped resources of manpower, rubber, tin, oil, and uranium. These resources, under the control of Com- munist aggressors, would be used for con- quest and war. These resources, under Com- munist control, would not be used for peace or enlightment, for improved health and education. Under Communist control these vast resources would not be used for the advancement of freedom. They would be used for war and enslavement. May I remind you that the Communist aggressors consider the individual as mere grains of sand on the seashore to be used by the masters of tyranny for their own selfish aggrandizement. We believe man is created in the image of an all-powerful being. We believe that man has individual rights and aspirations, that he is entitled to dignity and individual liberty. This we be- lieve. This we will defend. Lenin is reported as having said the road to Paris is the road through Peiping. The Communists are ruthlessly liquidating the opposition and are proceeding on that road to Paris by way of southeast Asia, the Near East and northern Africa. To halt this blue- print for tyrannical power, conquest, and enslavement, the United States is spending Is blood and wealth in South Vietnam The United States manifested its devotion to the cause of freedom by expending the flower of its young manhood to defend that cause in Korea. Our Commander in Chief, President Lyn- don B. Johnson, is very wisely supporting with strength the freedom fighters in South Vietnam. President Johnson will not pre- side over the liquidation of freedom in Asia. He will instead preside over the restoration of freedom in Asia. He is a determined leader in the tradition of the Founding Fathers of? my country. By his courageous action, President Johnson has encouraged people throughout the world who are de- voted and dedicated to the cause of freedom. We support you, here in the Republic of China, with our wealth and with our armed might. Your struggle for freedom is ours. We will not withdraw and leave you to fight this battle alone. We are here to stay until freedom is secure in Asia and the aggressor collapses in his own evil structure. In the history of the struggle for freedom you have produced one of the giant figures of our time. General Chiang Kai-shek was among the first to understand the diabolical tactics and sinister designs of the Commu- nist world conspiracy. He began his heroic struggle to oppose communism on the main- land in the 1920's, and he has been a world- renowned champion in that struggle from that time to this. He and Madame Chiang long ago won the hearts of the American people and of freedom lovers everywhere. Madame Chiang is now in my country, and we welcome her both as a valiant ally and as a warm and honored friend. The Republic of China stands ready on the flank of Communist aggression. The Republic of China is blocking the road of Communist expansion to the islands of the Pacific. The Republic of China and the magnificent forces of the Republic of South Korea are a deterring force to the announced Communist plans to conquer India, south- east Asia, and move into the Middle and Near East. I salute you for this magnifi- cent contribution to world freedom. I salute you also for the assistance you are giving to the free world effort in Viet- nam. You are one of the almost 40 nations which are helping the gallant people of that beleaguered land build a better life at the same time that they defend themselves against a cruel aggression. Your country is giving assistance in the field of agriculture. You have built power stations. You have sent medical teams. You have trained more than 400 Vietnamese technicians. You have given warehouses, agricultural equipment, seeds and fertilizers, veterinary equipment and cattle, boats, airplanes, and over half a million textbooks. And you have been gen- erous in extending to our forces fighting in Vietnam both material facilities and hos- pitality. You are playing your full role as part of the fraternity of freemen opposing aggression in Vietnam. The United States is fighting in South Vietnam as a member of that fraternity of freemen. We are fighting there against stark Communist aggression by terrorism, in- filtration, sabotage, deception, and murder? the most diabolical and dangerous form of aggression. We are fighting in South Viet- nam to preserve the right of self-determina- tion of nationalities. We are fighting for peace, as opposed to the spread of war. We are fighting to help all of you in a righteous cause. We are fighting to prevent a world war. We are fighting to prevent a world holocaust of unparalleled carnage and de- struction. We are daily growing stronger, on land, on sea, in the air, and in space. This strength is for freedom. This military might is dedi- cated to your independence, to your liberty. It will never be used for aggression, slavery, and conquest. The United States has no territorial designs anywhere in the world. We are for liberty and individual dignity and freedom for peoples everywhere. We believe in lending a helping hand to the diseased and the underprivileged throughout the world. We are standing beside all of you in this struggle for freedom to preserve your ancient heritage, your art, your culture?which pre- cedes ours?to preserve your civilization, which began thousands of years before ours. We share your hopes and your aspirations for Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 MIME Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 A298 CONGRESSIONAL he future. En this age of science and astro- nautics, there is no room for Communist suspicion, hatred, bigotry, and deceit. I look to the future with hope and with confidence. I believe we are on the dawn of a new era. The magnificent progress made on this island shows what free societies can accom- plish. The growth in your production of both agricultural and industrial goods can only be described as startling. Your exports are rising, your economy is strong, your cur- rency is sound. Most important of all, the benefits of this prosperity are going to the people. I am proud that my country has assisted you in your efforts. And I know that you are proud that through your own efforts you have done so well that in your country we have been able to end our foreign aid pr gram. 'the iron curtain in Europe and Asia is a manifestation of an inferiority complex. The Iron curtain is necessary to hide tyranny and promote totalitarianism. The Iron Curtain is designed to keep people from knowing the truth?to prevent them from knowing the joys of freedom and self-determination of peoples, individual liberty, dignity, and ecu- menic opportunity. can assure you that the United States will stand firm throughout the world. We fought in Korea. We are fighting in Vietnam. We are with :you here. We were with you in Korea, in Quemoy, and in Matsu. We are supporting SEATO in southeast Asia and NATO in Europe. We will oppose Commu- nist aggression wherever it rears its ugly head. The time 11..s come to launch an offensive? an offensive of truth about freedom, the truth about stark Communist aggression and its sinister designs. We most offer hope for the captive peoples of the world to throw off the yoke of tyranny and again live in the sun- light of freedom. We must spread the truth, throughout the world, about Communist im- perialism and colonialism. We must tell the truth about class hatred and race prejudice of Communist imperialists?the truth about their liquidations, murder, and deceit. We must not reward Red Chinese aggres- sion by giving Red China a seat in the Unit- ed Nations. We must not dignify Red China by giving her a forum and a vote on the cause of freedom. We must not bolster her eco- nomic system with the trade of free nations and peoples dedicated to the cause of human dignity. It would be a grave mistake to bol- ster her sagging economy with the products of free enterprise nations. We must not make this same mistake again. The free nations of the world promoted trade with the dicta- tors of World War II. It was their acquisi- tion of products from free enterprise nations that largely enabled them to launch a war against private enterprise, property rights, dignity, and freedom of the individual. We cannot make this mistake again. Red China has the atomic bomb. She is perfecting the hydrogen bomb. Trade with the free world will enable her to have the hydrogen bomb, with which to launch an onslaught against civilization, in mass production at an early date. We must push our freedom offensive now. Captive nations and peoples hold the key to the future security, independence., and freedom of the world. Remain steadfast in your struggle for freedom. Captive nations are the \"Achilles heel\" of Red imperialist ag- gression. Communism, fears your yearning, your desire for freedom. Communism fears your courage and your-ability to someday rise and turn back the tide of tyranny. You have our hearts. You have our sym- pathy, our support, and our understanding. We share your hopes. We share your aspira- tions. Most of all, we share your sure and certain vision of the future: Men will be free. RECORD ? APPENDIX January 24, 1itiqq6 Misuse of Foreign Aid EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF E[ON. THOMAS M. PELLY OF WASHINGTON IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, January 18, 1966 Mr. PELLY. Mr. Speaker, a constitu- ent of mine, Mr. Jack Bird, who is a member of the Alaska Fishemen's Union, has posed some serious questions and charges pertaining to our foreign aid pro- gram in the Republic of Chile. Following one of the major earth- quakes in Chile, the U.S. forein aid program was stepped up to aid in the recovery from this major disaster. How- ever, it seems that this aid and subse- quent aid, according to Mr. Bird's memorandum, has not been allowed to filter down to those who were in rTeatest need. Charges of graft and corruption have often been voiced in this area and there is no valid reason why we should not establish rules for administering foreign aid. Mr. Speaker, the American public can- not be placated forever with pious an- swers and doubletalk which has no substa:nce of meaning. I have asked that the following memo- randum from Mr. Bird be investigated by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Also, I am sending a copy of this memo- randum to the officials of the CARE program so that they, too, may have the opportunity to look into the matter of CARE packages being sold, th is not reaching the poor. Mr. Speaker, with the thought that my colleagues and other readers of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD might be inter- ested in Mr. Bird's observations I include herewith the text of his memorandum: I would like you to take this miter up with interested parties,, regarding aid do- nated by the American people. In 1960, I was living in Coronel, south of Concepcion, Chile, in a very poor section. The industry is mostly coal mining and the wages were very low. While I wes there we had the largest earthquake in Chilean history. Here in America the queen made headlines in all the newspapers and there were vast sums of money and mate/eels do- nated for that area, which was the center of the cmake. I resided in that are,: for 3 months after the quake. And I didn't see any sign of materials or aid that were sup- posed to be donated for relief of the sictims. When I left Chile, people were still ramping in front of their ruined houses. Hui sired of thousands of people never knew of any aid. Where does this aid go? Four years later I was again lieing in Chile. This time in the north, in the small city of Iquique where I resided for 18 months. At various times, I hate seen CARE packages on display in the store for sale. I purchased 8 kilos of flour for 31/2 es- cudos, nearly $1. In the 18 months that I lived in Iquique, I never met anyone who had ever received a CARE package and there are hundreds of thousands of poor people there. They didn't even know such a thing existed. If we don't supervise the aid after it en- ters these countries, we are wasting our time and mciney. I think this is a job for our highly rated Peace Corps in those areas. It would at least give them something useful to do. I have worked in many areas where the Peace Corps people are stationed and only about 25 percent are qualified to contribute any- thing to these areas, such as doctors, nurses, teachers and skilled technic-ans?the rest are just there for 2 years. Example. I have seen pictures in maga- zines showing Peace Corps workers digging ditches in Latin America, when those people have known how to do that for 500 years. Also, two Peace Corps workers came to Iquique, age about 20, to teach fishing. When they got on a fishing vessel, they were lost; they had to learn from the Chilean crew members, much to the amusement of the Chileans. There are more Communists in Chile than I have seen anywhere else where I have worked. Most of the crew members that I instructed in fishing were Communiet. Allende, the Communist Party leader, gained in most depressed areas of Chile. And if we don't get to these poorer classes of people in the next 4 years, the Communist Party has a good chance of getting in. Therefore we must make sure we get credit for every dollar in aid we send there. I think that is where the Peace Corps would come in useful, to see that anything we send to these countries gets to where it is supposed to go. A national drive for good used clothing would be very welcome to these poor people. Nearly all American families have closets full of clothing they will never use again because they are tired of them. This ma- terial could be distributed by the workers of the Peace Corps, to be sure it gets to the right people. My information is that aid donated by the American people is delivered to the principal port in each country, and then trusted to some local agency which may or may not be honest. As an American taxpayer, I want to see us get full value for each dollar spent. JACK BIRD, Seattle, Wash.

The Weaver Appointment EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. LESTER L. WOLFF OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. WOLFF. Mr. Speaker, more than two-thirds of all Americans are city and suburban dwellers. In a real sense, the job of the Federal Government is now concerned with the care of the people in these areas. The job facing the newly appointed head of the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, the very able Robert C. Weaver, is a tremendously important one. His new Department must become the clearinghouse for urban and subur- ban problems. A recent editorial in the New York Times calls this appointment \"the begin- ning of another road along which vast flew strides must be taken toward better living conditions.\" I respectfully requested that the Times editorial on Dr. Weaver's appointment be included in the RECORD, and commend it to the reading of the membership of this body: [From the New York (N.Y.) Times, Jan. 15, 1966] THE WEAVER APPOINTMENT President Johnson's appointment of Robert C. Weaver as Secretary of the new Depart- ment of Housing and Urban Renewal has been long expected. A Harvard-trained economist, Dr. Weaver hay Government experience dating from the early days of the Roosevelt administration. He is dedicated and knows the field to which he has been assigned; he was deputy State housing commissioner and later New York State Rent Administrator under Governor Harriman. President Kennedy subsequently named him to the top housing post in the country. He has attained Cabinet level? first Negro in American history to do so? despite some criticism of his abilities and his imagination. If the appointment of Robert Weaver to his new post is the end of the road in the sense that the struggle to put a Negro in the Cabinet is won, so is it the beginning of another road along which vast new strides must be taken toward better living condi- tions. \"In some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and neighbor- hoods containing as many as a hundred thousand people,\" the President said in his state of the Union message. \"Working to- gether, private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all the other necessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to live the good life.\" It is Robert Weaver's task to direct and coordinate such an ambitious effort, and we wish him the best of luck in this monumental job. Eccles Speaks Out cn Vietna EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. GEORGE E. BROWN, JR. OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 20, 1966 Mr. BROWN of California. Mr. Speaker, in view of the continuing efforts by the President to seek a negotiated peace in South Vietnam, for which I am most grateful, and the pressure which he is undoubtedly being subjected to from many persons advocating total victory, I think we would all do well to note the recent words by Financier Marriner S. Eccles. I would like to request unani- mous consent to have printed at this point in the RECORD an article which appeared recently in the Los Angeles Times, January 4, 1966, wherein Mr. Eccles joins in urging that we not esca- late the war in Vietnam: FINANCIER ASSERTS UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT ESCALATE WAR SAN FRANcisco.?\"Under no circumstances should we escalate the war in Vietnam. Our position there is indefensible,\" says financier Marriner S. Eccles. Eccles declares, \"Contrary to Government propaganda, we were not invited by and have no commitment to any representative or re- sponsible Government of South Vietnam. \"We are there as an aggressor in violation of our treaty obligation under the U.N. Charter.\" Eccles' remarks appeared in the \"Letters to the Editor\" column of the Monday morning edition of the San Francisco Chronicle. Now 75, Eccles was assistant to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in 1934 and has held several positions on the Federal Reserve Board. U.S. ACTION CITED Eccles said that after the Vietnamese vic- tory over the French and the signing of the Geneva Treaty in 1954, the U.S. refused to allow free elections in Vietnam, \"knowing that Ho Chi Minh, the Communist leader of the north, was so popular he would unques- tionably win.\" \"The South Vietnamese Catholics, about 10 percent of the population, property owners, and business Interests in the large cities, are the strong anti-Communist supporters of A299 South Vietnam, and are the minority,\" he continued. \"We have provided large amounts of mili- tary and economic aid and supplied them with military advisers,\" Eccles said. \"But until the present administration came into office, we did not furnish American troops to help fight their war, until it was ap- parent they were being defeated. \"We have gradually taken over the direc- tion to their Government as well as their war until now it has become an American war rather than a Vietnamese war.\" ? As a result, Eccles said, \"we now have alined against us the powerful countries of China and Russia, including all the Communist world, with practically no support from the rest of the world in spite of Rusk's and Mc- Namara's recent appeals to NATO. \"Under these conditions,\" he concluded, \"we cannot win.\" World Is a Small One for Harriman EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. F. BRADFORD MORSE OF MASSACHUSETTS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. MORSE. Mr. Speaker, world leaders have continued to be amazed at the vitality and effectiveness of one of our most able Ambassadors, Gov. W. Averell Harriman. Governor Harriman's familiarity with the principal world fig- ures for more than a generation has as- sured his missions a friendly and respect- ful welcome wherever he goes. Yesterday, Chalmers Roberts of the Washington Post reported on an inter- view with the Governor following his most recent peace mission regarding the situation in Vietnam. I ask unanimous consent to include Mr. Roberts' article in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD: [From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Jan. 23, 1966] WORLD IS A SMALL ONE FOR HARRISON (BY Chalmers M. Roberts, Washington Post staff writer) In the dark of last Wednesday evening W(illiam) Averell Harriman, who will be 75 next November 15, ran down the ramp from his presidential jet at Andrews Air Force Base in nearby Maryland. It was the end of yet another talking trip. Harriman has been talking straight talk to presidents, prime ministers, dictators, and other assorted political potentates since Harry Hopkins introduced him to the Roosevelt in- ner circle in early New Deal days. For 22 days he zigzagged around the world as one of President Johnson's peace offensive envoys. Mr. Johnson put a lot of people into diplomatic orbit but somehow the memory fades of all but the extraordinary durable Harriman. For Harriman the only word is extraordi- nary. On this 35,000-mile trip he touched down in 12 world capitals?he was in Bang- kok 3 times?and none of them was new to him. Not only had he been to them all before but he had met every one of the leaders before with the single exception of Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser. GREETED BY MENZIES That wealth of experience clearly paid dividends, Australia's Robert Menzies, who came out to the airport in the late evening to greet him, was an old friend from World Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 A300 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX January 24., le06 War II days in London when the Aussie sat with the British War Cabinet. Or take Yugoslavia's President Tito. \"I saw him in Brdo\"?where they met again this time?\"back in 1951 when Yugo- slavia, after the break with Russia, feared Stalin would turn the satellites loose on him. We gave him planes and tanks.\" Harriman paused and added: \"When you've seen a man in his tough times, there's a certain relationship.\" In Warsaw-, Communist Party Boss Wladis- law Gomulka saw Harriman \"for old time's sake.\" He once had been a house guest in Harriman's New York residence, years after they first met during the war. \"The Shah of Iran,\" says Harriman, \"con- siders me one of his oldest friends. He stayed at my cottage in Sun Valley.\" Har- riman, whose father created the Union Pa- cific Railroad, was of course the man who created that ski resort. Harriman has a newspaperman's instincts about travel and he hasn't missed many cor- ners of the world. \"If you haven't been to a country,\" as he puts it, \"no matter how much information you have, you can't get a feel of it.\" In fact Harriman feels so strongly about the right of Americans to travel that he once hired Dean Acheson to fight a potential case for him right up to the Supreme Court. Back in the Eisenhower years, when he had finished a term as Governor of New York (he was involuntarily retired by the voters in favor of Nelson Rockefeller) Harriman de- cided he wanted to go to Communist China, E 1959 TRIP CALLED OFF At that time the State Department forbade such trips. But the test case never came off because at the last minute he received a mes- sage from Peiping saying it would not be con- venient to receive him that year, 1959. Of course, Harriman has been to China. He stopped off in Chungking, the wartime capital, to see Chiang Kai-shek en route home from IVIoscow in 1946. Everybody told him he ought to go on to Peiping but he had a date with Gen. Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo, and so he missed his only chance to get the feel of today's center of the Asian Commu- nist world. \"I was very serious in those days,\" he says with a sense of regret that he didn't put off the visit with the general another day or two to take in Peiping. 'rhe Governor?everybody calls him that and he loves it despite the fact that his political skills turned out to be in an al- most totally inverse ratio to his diplomatic abilities?had only 8 hours' warning of his latest trip. President Johnson called him at noon and he was airborne from Andrews at 8 p.m. But the Governor was not unprepared this time even though he thought it was to be a trip of only a few days. \"I've been caught several times before,'' lie explains, \"on being sent to the tropics. So usually take some tropical shirts along. I only wear one weight of wool suit anyway.'' Although the presidential jet, with its huge \"United States of America\" legend embla- zoned on each side, has a pair of bunks, the 6-f oot-l-inch Harriman spent only 3 or 4 nights aboard in bed. At each stop, too, em- bassy wives reached for the soiled shirts and. returned them in time for the Governor and, his two globe-girdling aids, Asian Commu- nist expert David Dean, and Christopher Squire, who is in charge of Hungarian af- fairs at State. Harriman took no secretary. He penciled his dispatches on a yellow pad and got them oil at the next stop. Dean and Squire al- ternated as note takers at the talks with the foreign leaders and then wrote up the detailed reports. Harriman has his own philosophy about diplomatic messages. \"I write them short to the President and There was no surfboarding this time. But and the Secretary of State. More people he mused to a companion: \"In my day, it read the short ones. But I make them very was much more dangerous; they didn't have much to the point. They have got to be that stabilizing fin on the back of the board reasonably entertaining. I learned that then.\" from the British. They pass around the Cabinet table the telegrams they get from their ambassadors. They never have a leak, either; I wish we could do as well. \"The Ambassador in Britain who writes the best has his career made. They have literary style. Sometimes exact reporting is not as important as being descriptive.\" Harriman, of course, won't discuss the substance of his peace mission other than to say that \"I got the impression that all the people I saw were anxious to see the fightin.g stop, although for differing rea- sons.\" \"The crocodile\" method is to come to the point and wrap it up quickly. He had 45 minutes at the Peshawar airport with Paki- stan's President Ayub Khan who, naturally, he has known since 1959. IN WARSAW AT 3:30 A.M. When he arrived in Warsaw, nonstop from Andrews, it was 3:30 in the morning by his wristwatch. But 45 minutes al ter the touchdown he was closeted with Poland's Foreign Minister Adam Rapacki. \"You can do an awful lot in an hour,\" he says. Harriman, of course, was acutely oriscious of the critical role the Sino-Soviet dispute plays in the war in Vietnam. Like other administration leaders, he feels that Mos- cow wants to see the war ended, that Peiping wants to see it continue and that Hanoi is trapped in between the two Communist giants. It was Harriman, after the German sur- render and before Japan fell, who inspired James Forrestal to write in his 1945 diary: \"He said the outward thrust of communism was not dead and that we might well have to face an ideological warfare just as vigorous and dangerous as fascism or nazism.\" And that at a time when most Americans were putting their postwar hopes on a continua- tion of the wartime alliance with the Soviet Union. Stalin himself confirmed Harrini an's dire views that October when he told him that \"we've decided to go our own way.\" It was President Kennedy who first deeply involved Harriman in the Far East, ,-specially in the China problem. Today he takes very seriously the hard words from Peiping such as Lin Piao's pronouncement that the under- developed nations of the \"countryside\" will surround and defeat the \"cities\" of North America and Western Europe. He wants Americans to fully appreciate the danger from China. But he does not worry that in turning their eyes to the .Par East they Will be bemused into thinking that Washington and Moscow are about to be- come allies. He figures the Russians will make it evident it can't come to that. Averell Harriman did not bring peace to Vietnam but he clearly enjoys the satisfac- tion of yet another job well clone. The trip was tiring; a cold turned into an ear infec- tion because of too-rapid descent and change in the cabin air pressure corning into Darwin, Australia. Winging home across the Pacific, he played bridge with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Senator JOHN SHERMAN COOPER, Dean, Squires, and Rush's aid, C. Arthur (Buck) Borg. Rusk, who had joined up in New Delhi and and who lives on his earnings, picked up a bit of change from Harriman who in 1952 was reputed to be worth $40 million. When they got to Honolulu and tile luxury of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, Harriman ducked into a sports shop, bought a $6.95 pair of wildly yellow swimming trunks and headed into the sea at Waikiki. George Paul Miller: The Conscience From California EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. JOSEPH E. KARTH OF MINNESOTA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. KARTH. Mr. Speaker. It has been my rare privilege during the last 7 years to know and to work with Congress- man GEORGE P. MILLER, On the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. Under his leadership the committee has considered the National Aeronautics and Space Administration authorization bills which have brought the country's space programs from very preliminary stages to full operation. Much credit for this successful achievement is due to Chairman MILLER'S knowledge and pa- tience and parliamentary skill. The magazine Challenge published by the General Electric Missiles and Space division recently printed an article about Congressman MILLER. So that our col- leagues can have the opportunity to read this excellent portrayal, I include it in the Appendix of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD: GEORGE PAUL MILLER: THE CONSCIENCE FROM CALIFORNIA (One of the first things a boy learns on getting a drum is that he's never going to get another one. One of the first things a nation learns about getting a GEORGE MILLER is that we need more like him.

Here he speaks out on competition? among people, in industry, and with Russia.) In a highly technical world like space, saturated with semantics like thermody- namics, gravity gradient, and accelerometers, if you were going to handpick a man in Gov- ernment to head up the House of Represent- atives Committee on Science and Astronau- tics, you wouldn't pick the manager of a travel agency that failed, or a man who was on relief in depression days, or an ex official of a State fish and game commission.

And you might pick him for this job of spearheading the annual authorization of America's $5 billion space program not be- cause of his technical background ( though he's an engineer and has learned the lan- guage); not because he's a tactful politician (though associates say he can settle disputes better than most), and not because of his experience (though he's served five Presi- dents).

Neither he nor his wife ever has been on relief. ' Edward Taylor of 810 North Illinois made it through the .eighth grade. He was in civil service work at Oak Ridge, Tenn.., then was - transferred to Fort Harrison \"until the sol- diers took over\" in 1949. Since then he has been unable to find steady employment. Most of the other men I talked with have similarly steady, modest backgrounds: They are grateful to have the curbstone job mart as a door to temporary employment. They prefer that it not be called the \"slave mar- ket.\" Their pay runs from '75 cents to $1.25 or 0.50 an hour as a rule, depending upon the type of work they get. Most of these good men are victims of the new technology. They are among 3 million employable but unemployed Americans. To most of these beyond the twenties or thirties, retraining and other war on poverty devices offer scant prospects. What they need is what Fred Gibson said is part of being a man?steady jobs. And they need them now. This strongly suggests a need for Federal action to create those jobs. It was Abraham Lincoln, not Karl Marx, who said the Government \"should do for the people what the people cannot do themselves or as well themselves.\" Affirmation: SPEEC OF HON. CHARLES L. WELTNER OF GEORGIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 13, 1966 Mr. WELTNER. Mr. Speaker, the university and college students of Geor- gia have initiated and organized Affirma- tion: Vietnam, a project which has my approval and unqualified support. My colleagues here in the House have ex- pressed their pride in these young people, and I join with them in applauding this expression of constructive patriotism. The original impetus came from a group of students at Emory University In Atlanta, and now includes representa- tion and support from most colleges and universities throughout the State. Its sponsors include Senators RICHARD B. RUSSELL and HERMAN TALMADGE and other notable Georgians and Atlantans, as well as the entire Georgia delegation to the House of Representatives. Remar M. Sutton, Jr., is providing excellent co- ordination of the movement in his capac- ity as general chairman. The culmination of Affirmation: Viet- nam will be a rally at Atlanta Stadium on February 12. It is a very special honor that Secretary of State Dean Rusk, a native Georgian and product of Georgia schools, will make the major address. Students have traditionally and his- torically occupied a unique place in our society. Their enthusiasm and intelli- gence-have been joined to many causes, and they have not hesitated to debate the issues with clear candor, and without regard to personal gain. In recent months, the students voice has often protested our commitment in southeast Asia. Therefore, this sponta- neous movement by Georgia students is deeply gratifying and reassuring. I am proud to be connected with this project, and I hope that the demonstra- tion of support for the reasoned princi- ples of our country's commitment will be noted by the rest of our Nation. Johnson and Party Repairing Image EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER OF CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, re- cently, under leave to insert my own re- marks and include extraneous matter, I had inserted in the RECORD an article by Walter Pincus relative to the Demo- cratic National Committee finances. Another of his articles on the same sub- ject appeared in the Sunday Star of January 23. In order to complete the story, the article follows: MONEY AND POLITICS--JOHNSON AND PARTY REPAIRING IMAGE (By Walter Pincus) Stung by recent criticism, President Johnson and his top political aids are moving to improve the Democratic Party's darkened fundraising image. At the same time, however, financial de- mands of this year's congressional election activities may resurrect the bad image just as fast as the Democrats try to knock it down. As a first step in image building, negotia- tions are underway to transfer some $600,- 000 raised by the newest $15,000 a page Dem- ocratic ad book to a bipartisan foundation which?with matching funds from the Re- publican National Committee?would openly conduct voter registration drives prior to next fall's election. The ad book, which drew funds from 68 corporations, was promoted by the Demo- crats last summer behind a veil of secrecy. As originally conceived, the proceeds were to go to Democratic candidates who dis- tribute the books at fundraising movie premieres. DIRECT MAIL PLAN As a second image-building step, the Dem- ocrats soon will begin a modest direct mail solicitation for small contributions. In re- cent years, the Democrats have received al- most 80 percent of their funds from donors of over $100?most of them $1,000 givers. An effort last year to stimulate small con- tributions through a contest was a dismal failure. So few people entered that win- ners at the State level have not even been announced. President Johnson, himself, started off the new fundraising approach with his cam- paign fund reform proposals in the state of the Union message. Among the sugges- tions?still to be transmitted in detail to Congress?was a tax relief proposal for poli- tical contributions. This is aimed at stimu- lating small donations. In contrast to the Democrats, the Republi- can Party has since 1962 reported raising a sizable proportion of its funds from donors of $100 or less. As politically attractive as the imagemak- ing proposals are, they actually will cost more money than they will raise. With the need to raise some $1 million this year to support the national Democratic program, party leaders hope their top fund- raiser?the President?will be able to carry Januaty 24, 1966 out appearances at five or six dinners around the country. The President's recent gall bladder opera- tion cost the national committee some $1 million. Almost $400,000 of that figure would have been collected at a California func- tion Johnson had planned to attend. When he was unable to go, the California promo- ters refused to hold the affair and held onto some $300,000 already collected. That event apparently has been rescheduled for April. TWO WASHINGTON EVENTS Several fundraising appearances of Vice President HUBERT H. HUMPHREY, which bring in additional funds to Washington, were canceled when the President asked him to stay in Washington during his postoperative period. This year, along with out-of-town Presi- dential appearances, the Democrats are plan- ning on two affairs in Washington to bring in money. The financial attraction of the Nation's Capital as a campaign fund source is irre- sistible. The entire take of an affair, rather than just half the proceeds, go to the Demo- cratic National Committee. In addition, the city is bulging with people who understand politics and respond to requests for contri- butions. Lobbyists, trade association representatives, and Government employees to make the city the best place to hold either a dinner?as has been suggested for this spring?or an entertainment gala?as is being talked of for midsummer. However, fundraising in Washington has its drawbacks?the prime one being the up- roar over organized Democratic solicitation of Federal employees. Such protests have developed over the past 5 years. All the attempts at imagemaking could be destroyed if the party resumes its intri- cate, organized, and illegal solicitation of Federal employees by their more politically oriented coworkers. INQUIRY IS CLOSED Last year, the Civil Service Commission and the Justice Department were forced to review the activities of officials in the Rural Electrification Administration after allega- tions were made and partially confirmed that tickets to the 1964 Johnson gala were being sold on office time to subordinates. Justice recently announced it had closed the inquiry without finding sufficient evi- dence to warrant prosecution. Such organized in-house soliciting also was planned for last year's Democratic con- gressional dinner. Though it was stopped in some departments after being revealed in the press, other agencies carried it on suc- cessfully. Another aspect of Democratic 1966 fund- raising will be promotion of the $1,000 a membership President's Club, which since 1961 has supplied a heavy proportion of the party's funds. Though it creates the \"fat cat\" image, the President's Club funds will be needed to provide the major part of this year's campaignmoney. Tomorrow, HUMPHREY and other top ad- ministration and party leaders will attend the New York City President's Club kickoff meeting. Over 500 have been invited to at- tend the closed briefing?and subsequently contribute $1,000 to the party. Similar events are being set up around the country, and probably will precede both the Washington and out-of-town fundrais- ing appearances of Johnson. SECOND AD BOOK DOUBTFUL The bad publicity generated by this year's ad book limits chances that another book will be attempted this year. However, if the need for funds deMand it, the Democrats may put together a volume to accompany the gala. Over 100,000 of this year's book?a valen- tine to President Johnson entitled \"Toward Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 January 24, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX Loisisyna.F. MAN HEADS HEART GROUP '1'he election of Philip P. Ardery as chair- man of the board of directors of the Ameri- can Heart Association was announced yester- day. Mr. Ardery, a Louisville lawyer, succeeds John D. Brundage. Gen. Dwight D. Eisen- hower continues as honorary chairman of the association. Mr. Ardery retired last July as a major gen- eral in the Air Force Reserve. In World War if lie won seven U.S. decorations and the Croix de Guerre. Active for more than a decade in heart as- sociation work, Mr. Ardery has been a mem- ber of the group's national board and execu- tive committee since 1958. In 1962 lie re- ceived the association's award of merit for distinguished service to its programs. One of Our Commissioners Is Missing EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. CRAIG HOSMER CALIFORNIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 20, 1966 Mr. HOSMER. Mr. Speaker, the fol- lowing communication has been sent by me to the House Republican conference, but I believe it may prove of interest to all our colleagues: Moans ENERGY COMMISSION VACANCY? FAILURE To FILL For almost 7 months?since July 1, 1965? a vacancy has existed on the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. This vitally important body with an annual budget exceeding $2 billion is functioning at 80 percent of its statutory manpower level. The management of its vast complex of scientific and indus- trial activities rides heavy on the shoulders of four rather than a proper complement of five supervising Commissioners. The input of thought, judgment, experience and wis- dom into Commission decisions affecting both U.S. nuclear defense and American progress in peaceful uses of the atom con- tinues month after month to remain starved by a factor of 20 percent. Yet the Johnson administration remains totally unconcerned. Washington hears not the slightest rumor whatever of any possi- bility of a new Commissioner to replace Dr. Mary I. Bunting, who returned to the campus of Radcliffe College last June 30. This regrettable state of affairs follows on the heels of an equally regrettable body blow to the Commission's farce level dealt by the same Johnson administration in 1964. This involved the appointment of Dr. Bunting herself in that year with the understanding and agreement of the White House that she would remain away from her teaching re- aponsibilities only for a year. During her year in Washington, Dr. Bunting proved to be a brilliant, hard working, and able Com- missioner. Expectedly, however, most of her year was devoted to learning the job. She left, therefore, at the very moment of emergence into a capability to assume her full share of the Commission's workload. The administration knew, or should have known, at the time it appointed her that ouch would be the case. There were other candidates for the 1964 vacancy who were willing and able to serve the full term, which Dr. Bunting was not. Nevertheless, she was selected, because at that moment the admin- istration was going through one of its peri- odic \"appoint women to office\" weeks. All of this is a record of bad government administration. The people should know it. They are entitled to something better. The Commission vacancy should be filled promptly by a person of high competence who will agree to serve the term. Roy Wilkins on Hogwash EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. ANDREW JACOBS, JR. OF INDIANA IN TIM HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. JACOBS. Mr. Speaker, a great deal of nonsense is being spoken and written today by individuals in an effort to ridicule this Nation's efforts to cope with the causes and effects of poverty. Two columnists writing in the current issue of the Indianapolis Observer pro- vide a most welcome change from what appears to be an increasingly active and deliberately misleading campaign. Neither Roy Wilkins nor John Ackel- raire, the Observer's columnists, will al- low to go unchallenged the bumper stickers which smugly proclaim, \"I'm fighting poverty. I work for a living.\" These two writers display honesty and realism in discussing the difficult cir- cumstances in which the unwilling vic- tims of the \"new technology\" find them- selves. For that reason, I take this op- portunity to insert their comments in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD; [Prom the Indianapolis (Ind.) Observer] Roy WILKINS ON HOGWASH It is easy for most white people to think of Negro life as one long physical hardship. They remember lynchings and the victims of beatings and shootings. They know about bombings and burned-out homes and churches. Where Negroes are free of all this, or most of it, the public cries out, along with the young California guardsman in Watts: \"What do they want? They never had it so good. These are not slums like Harlem.\" There are other cruelties besides lynching and the Negro is not insensitive to them. One is the popular myth that the race doesn't want to work, that it prefers wel- fare payments. Today the not-so-subtle insult is repeated by rightwing critics and speakers and parrots belonging to this or that society, but call- ing themselves generally, \"conservatives.\" The latest dig is to be found on automobile bumper stickers: \"I'm fighting poverty. I work for a living.\" The implication is as plain as it is smug. It says there is work aplenty for those who want to work. It says that those who do not work are deliberately choosing the as- sistance of antipoverty and welfare programs. It says, further, with an air of self-righteous- ness, \"We who work are paying the bills for those who choose to enjoy poverty.\" Every student of the most elementary eco- nomics of a capitalistic society knows this to be hogwash. and pretty smelly even for that concoction. Statistics don't mean so much to people who think and live by slogans, but the fact is that 3 million Americans are hunting for work and cannot get a job. In the midst of our affluence we simply have not solved the problem of what to do about workers dis- lodged by technology, not by laziness. One element of the formula for unemploy- ment is a dark skin. It is true nationally that the unemployment rate for Negroes is A279 twice that for whites, but in some locali- ties it is as much as four times the white rate. In the Watts district of Los Angeles last August 1 out of every 3 Negroes was un- employed. In Michigan computers are bringing thou- sands of different cars off the assembly line equipped by orders on punchcards. In Ohio a machine drills 250 cylinder blocks at once. In Louisiana a computer fills drums with chemicals. In Chicago a computer mixes and bakes cakes. On a single Dixie plantation a cottonpicking machine displaces 50 Negro families. These changes and wholesale regional and family disruptions and the myriad personal tragedies that flow from them will not be remedied by the auto-bumper philosophers. They are too busy working?until they reach the brutal cutoff age of 45, that is. [From the Indianapolis (Ind.) Observer! JOHN ACKELMIRE: THE DISINHERITED Come along to the slave market.. It is in front of the old city hall at Ohio and Ala- bama. The scene could be?but won't be? especially instructive to those social illiter- ates one generation removed from honest Hoosier barnyards who have managed to translate their fiscal luck in this fabulous economy into a self-righteous contempt for the unemployed. Each morning long before sunup 2 dozen or more jobless Negroes gather at the curb- stone on North Alabama in hope somebody will came by and offer them an honest day's toil. There are a few winos and incompe- tents among them. But the vast majority are versatile, able-bodied men about as des- perate for employment as it is possible to be. They arrive, poorly clad against the pre- dawn's icy bite, and they stand on the side- walk in orderly array until picked up or hope is abandoned. Do they enjoy poverty? Are they living high off the hog on welfare? Do they deserve to be insulted by bumper stickers reading, \"I'm fighting poverty, I work for a living\"? Fred Gibson is 62. He lives at 2238 North College and walks the distance each morning to the curbstone in the 200 block of North Alabama. He is twice a widower; his second wife died last February after a 26-year mar- riage. He has 4 grown children and 13 grandchildren. He is the sole support of one daughter, now separated from her husband, and two grandchildren. The daughter is ex- pecting a third child in 3 months. Fred Gibson has lived in Indianapolis more than 40 years. He never got beyond the fifth grade, although his felicitous manner of speech and wide range of self-gathered knowledge suggest considerably more formal education. In his time he has had some fair jobs?landscape gardening, construction work, hod carrying and fry cooking. The only really well-paying job he ever had, though, was a brief stint in a World War II war plant. He never has owned a house or car. But neither has he ever been on public welfare nor has he ever gone to a township trustee for relief. He has no police record. \"I have always tried to be a man,\" he said the other day, \"and part of that is holding a steady job.\" In recent times a steady job has eluded Fred Gibson. So he goes down to the curb- stone each morning in hope of a day's pick- and-shovel or tile-laying work. If he is lucky, he may make as much as $25 or $30 a week. His rent takes $16 of that. (\"I don't know how I'm going to pay this week's rent,\" he said.) Roy Conn, 55, of 303 West 10th, has lived in Indianapolis since 1928. He is a graduate of Louisville Central ' High School.

APPENDIX January 24, 1966 Into one sovereign and independent republic of the Ukrainian people. Although the Ukrainian Republic was recognized by a number of States, including the Government of Soviet Russia, it had no durable peace nor prosperty because Com- munist Russia invaded the Ukrainian state despite its previous pledges to respect and honor the Ukrainian independence. For nearly 31/2 years, without assistane from the Western World, the Ukrainian peo pie waged a heroic war against Communist Russia in the defense of sovereignty of their country but the gallant struggle came to a tragic end. The free Ukrainian state was subdued to a puppet regime of the Soviet Socialistic Republic. Since the Russian Communist enslave- ment with brutal oppression and domination there has been much suffering among these people. But despite the Communist yoke im- posed by 1VLOscow, the Ukrainian people never accepted the foreign domination and are con- tinuirig to struggle for freedom and national independence. Through a series of heroic and bloody uprisings and a steady resistance through underground warfare, the Ukrainian people have demonstrated their undying love of freedom and their opposition to alien slav- ery and oppression. Both the Congress and the President of the United States have recognized the legitimate right to freedom and national independence by enacting and signing respectively the \"Captive Nations Week Resoltuion\" in July 1959, which enumerated the Ukraine as one of the captive nations enslaved and domi- nated by Communist Russia, and is entitled to recognition and moral support by the American people and the free world at large. During the debate on colonialism in the U.N. Assembly in 1960 and 1961 a number of West- ern statesmen, including our Ambassador to the U.N. raised their voices in protest against the persecution of the Ukrainian people by the Communists. The cause of Ukrainian freedom and inde- pendence is no longer a patriotic desire since the Communist menace has spread into Asia, our shores in Cuba and Latin America, it has become a political necessity for the free world to recognize that an independent Ukraine would substantially weaken the Communist empire. Americans of Ukrainian descent in our great State of North Dakota are planning to celebrate the forthcoming 48th anniver- sary of the Ukrainian independence on Sun- day, January 23, 1966, in a solemn and fitting manner with special religious services and programs which will be heard on radio and TV over stations in Bismarck, Mandan, Mi- not, and Dickinson. We firmly believe that you are fully aware of the importance of Ukraine as an ally in the struggle against Russian Communist imperialism. We, therefore, respectfully re- quest that you make an appropriate state- ment on the floor of the Senate on or about the 22d of January in commemoration of the 48th anniversary of the Ukrainian independ- ence. This anniversary provides an appro- priate occasion not only for the U.S. Senate and American people but also for the U.S. Government to demonstrate their sympathy and understanding of the aspirations of the Ukrainian people. It may also provide better understanding by extending diplomatic relations to Ukraine, which is a charter member of the United Nations, by nominating an American of Ukrainian descent to serve on some diplo- matic post, and by the issuance of a com- memorative stamp in honor of Europe's free- dom fighter and Ukrainian poet, Texas Sheychenko. We extend our sincere thanks and appre- ciation for the favorable response in the past on this and other. matters, and we hope that you will continue to accept our expres- sions with meaningful understanding. Sincerely yours, DT. ANTHONY ZTJKOWSKY, President, UCCA, State Branch of North Dakota. Quick, Easy Solution to Vietnam EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. WILLIAM S. MOORHEAD OF PENNSYLVANIA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 13, 1966 Mr. MOORHEAD. Mr. Speaker, after a visit to Vietnam last month I con- cluded that the most important con- tribution the average American can make to the war in Vietnam is patience. There is no quick and easy solution. The nationally syndicated writer, Ralph McGill, in a recent column, com- pared the fighting conditions in Vietnam to an episode in our own history. He noted that Marion the Swamp Fox, using guerrilla tactics, \"kept a large force of well-equipped British troops engaged across a long period of time.\" Four major expeditions by the British against him were unsuccessful. Indeed it is frustrating to hold the power to devastate completely an entire enemy country and not be able to use that power. Mr. McGill's column, published in the January 13 issue of the Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, is an excellent answer to the question: \"Why not win in Vietnam?\" Under leave to extend my remarks I Include it at this point in the RECORD: NEITHER POWER NOE VICTORY ARE ENOUGH FOR VIETNAM (By Ralph McGill) ATLANTA.?\"Why not victory now?\" \"Why not win in Vietnam?\" \"Why don't we get it over with?\" \"What's wrong with winning?\" \"Why can't this great power kick out that rabble of guerrillas in Vietnam?\" These and other idiocies, born of frustra- tion, 'echo in the land of the free and the home of the brave. (It is a land that ought to understand, out of its own history, the frustration in Vietnam. Our own history includes Marion, the Swamp Fox. He based himself in a swamp and kept a large force of well-equipped British troops engaged across a long period of time. On four oc- casions, major expeditions were mounted against him. He eluded them. Marion was one of the factors that enabled final victory to be won. The more effective units of our continental army were, in effect, guerrilla troops, operating out of their knowledge of terrain and of living off the country.) The United States would win. Winning would, in a sense, be easy. Congressman CHARLES WELTNER, speaking in his Georgia district, said to the impatient and frustrated: \"Certainly, it would be a simple matter to bring about, within 24 hours, the utter devas- tation of all of North Vietnam. We could kill every able-bodied fighting man there? along with every little child, every woman, every old man?all within the twinkling of an eye. We can win?if winning means wiping out 16 million human beings; and if winning includes the very real chance of direct military engagement with Commu- nist China; end if winning includes the prob- able necessity for using nuclear weapons against Peiping; and if winning includes the possible destruction of Russia?after, of course, Russia has simultaneously de- stroyed 100 million American lives. \"We have the power to win?if we want to win under these circumstances. That power has gone unexercised, to the mount- ing frustration of us all, and to the in- creasing demand that we do something. We sincerely seek an honorable peace and, I am convinced, are willing to go the extra mile. We will not, however, negotiate a peace that would mean the inevitable loss of southeast Asia to the thralldom of China.\" The world should have learned out of its many wars and \"victories\" that great power is not enough?not nearly enough. Nor is \"victory\" enough. Two tremendous wars en- veloped most of the earth. They were \"won\" with a vast mobilization of power, men, ma- terials, and food. A Korean war was waged, bloodily and indecisively. It was said of this harsh conflict that it was waged to contain Communist aggres- sion. That was true. But it was not all the truth. We were then, as now, confronted with two Communist giants. Since that time, the second one, China, has detonated two nuclear devices. More are on the way. Russia, believing that communism eventu- ally will triumph, seems willing, in the face of power, to build her own economy and avoid aggression. China, with a growing birthrate and an increasingly serious lack of food and viability in her economy, believes in and seeks aggression. Yet, in the last 2 months her attempts to infiltrate and sub- vert African governments have failed. A plot to make Indonesia a Peiping puppet was thwarted. Peiping-trained Thailanders now are in open opposition in north Thailand. The story goes on and on. Neither power alone, nor victory alone, is enough. What this country seeks to do is to mobilize all our power?our wealth of goods, money and arms?to seek the slow way, a new sort of \"victory.\" Heart Group EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. JOHN SHERMAN COOPER OF KENTUCKY IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Appendix of the RECORD an article- from the New York Times of January 10, 1966, noting the election of Philip P. Ard- ery of Louisville, Ky., as chairman of the board of directors of the American Heart Association. Mr. Ardery distinguished himself in World War II, leading an air squadron on D-day and since has been equally distin- guished as a member of the bar and as a devoted worker in the field of civic af- fairs. I am sure that he will continue to pro- vide effective leadership to the American Heart Association as chairman of the board of directors. There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04: CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/01/04 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400010008-8 January 24, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ?APPENDIX ican system which our deliberations disclose as necessary. It seems to me that the task might be entrusted after this Conference to one or more bodies which would carry for- ward our work in preparation for a special conference, under article III of the charter, to meet possibly within the next 6 months. At this stage I should like to advance for consideration some of the ideas that the United States believes could contribute to making our organization a more effective instrument. First, the United States favors annual OAS meetings at ministerial level. The interac- tion and speed of developments in our hemisphere and elsewhere make it highly desirable that we meet with more regularity and frequency than we have before. The consultations should not be confined to our hemispheric problems alone. Developments in other areas might be reviewed both for their implications for us, as well as for what we might do to further the cause of peace and freedom elsewhere. Second, we should strengthen the organ- izational relationship among the key organs of the system: the Ministers, the Council, the Economic and Social Council, CIAP, and the Secretariat. Our objective should be to in- tegrate the various facets of our collective effort; to insure they are responsive to the agreed policies of governments; to insure that cooperation in the political, economic, social and cultural fields are mutually rein- forcing and to insure that new operational tasks are carried forward with administrative efficiency and dispatch. Third, in our forward planning we should think not only of measures to deal with a conflagration onee it has broken out, but also of preventive steps the Organization might helpfully take in a dispute or situation in this hemisphere before it has reached the crisis stage. There is wisdom in the old dip-. lomatic tradition?incorporated in United Nations clactrine--that bilateral disputes are best settled bilaterally. Nevertheless, the Council might be empowered to consider a dispute or situation at the request of one or more American Republics: to recommend procedures for peaceful settlement; and per- haps to recommend provisional measures de- signed to prevent an aggravation of the sit- uation. The Council, in carrying out such function:3, could avail itself of aiasytance from the Inter-American Peace Coinntittee, from special commissions, and from the Sec- retary General. Fourth, the United States would also sup- port strengthening the institution and role of the Secretary General, authorizing him to bring to the attention of the Council any matter which, in his opinion, may endanger peace and security in the hemisphere. Fifth, there is the question of joint ac- tion. Both in the Cuban missile crisis and In the Dominican situation, the discharge by the OAS of its responsibilities involved not merely the assumption of political responsi- bility but also the employment of units of the armed forces of various member states. These were contributed voluntarily and op- erated collectively under a combined com- mand. In the crises of 1962, this action was decisive. In the case of the Dominican Re- public, the Inter-American Peace Force made a vital contribution to the avoidance of need- iess bloodshed and the creation, of conditions for the Dominican people to determine their own future by votes and not by arms. Its importance is attested by the fact that the Provisional government has called upon it for continued assistance in the maintenance of peace and stability. The United Nations has, of course, had much more experience than has the OAS in this type of multilateral peacekeeping force. Many of your countries have made personnel available for both United Nations observation and military operations in sev- eral crisis situations. 111,11,,111 It may, therefore, be useful for us to ex- amine, in the light of experience and the nature of our collective responsibilities for paece and security in the hemisphere, and elsewhere, the desirability of establishing these voluntary contributions to interna- tional peacekeeping operations on a more orderly basis in advance of their possible future use by the OAS or by the U.N. If we face the fact that we live in troubled times, if we face the fact that there are those who seek with purpose and persistence to destroy democracy. I believe, if we are patient, we shall find a creative way so rec- ognize two important principles: first, we ought to be prepared to move fast and ef- fectively and, if possible, together when a dangerous situation arises in the hemisphere; second, none of our governments is prepared to engage its military forces except by a na- tional decision, at the highest level, in the light of particular circumstances. Sixth, I would note the need to avoid within our hemisphere competitive arms races. Our resources are desperately heeded for economic and social development. With all its imperfections we are blessed by the most mature and reliable system for re- gional security and peacekeeping on the face of the planet. As military budgets are form- ulated we should keep these facts before us? and the examples, past and present, if the burdens and consequences of all arms races. The experience of the Cuban missile crises gave to the Western Hemisphere a heightened awareness of the need to control modern weapons and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. One of the initiatives that received added impetus in 1962 was the pro- posal to create a nuclear-free zone in l.atin America. The United States has followed with keen and sympathetic interesi the efforts of Latin American countries to work oat agreed arrangements for excludins the proliferation, the stationing, or storage of nuclear weapons within the territory of Latin Arnerican States. We have noted the en- couraging progress toward this end which_ was made during the current year at discus ions in Mexico City. The United States believes the project of a nuclear-free zone in Latin America is constructive statesmanship iii the but tradition of the hemisphere. We wel- come the effort and would be glad to see it reach a successf ul conclusion. should also note that our membership mi y expand. The emergence of two new, independent, states?Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago? caused our organization to devise a formula for the admission of members. We found the formula without need to alter the char- ter. The door is now open to additional countries to join the OAS. We will wet nine them wholeheartedly at such time as they with to avail themselves of this opportuaity. VII This, as we see it, is the panorama of our common tasks. The intent of my country to work with you in the common quest for freedom and pros- perity has never been as strong as it is to- day?to build together and together to pro- tect what we are building. President Jehn- son has summed it up this way: -Our charter charges each American con- try to seek to strengthen representative democracy. Without that democracy and without the freedom it nourishes, material progress is an aimless enterprise, destroying the dignity of the spirit that it is really meant to liberate. So we will continuo to join with you and encourage democracy until we build a hemisphere of free nations Ileom Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle.\" Thus vie would reaffirm the faith of my Government in the effectiveness and vita liLy of our regional system. It has served to bring new levels of understanding and good will between our peoples. It has served to promote freedom and democracy, It has A277 served, and is increasingly serving, as a means for achieving material well-being and social justice for our nations. It has served to keep the peace in this hemisphere and to protect us from our enemies. The Organization has demonstrated its flexibility and adaptability to change in the past. I am confident that it will continue to do so in the future. The challenge in this old hemispheric sys- tem is like the challenge of domestic political life: to transform and modernize policies and institutions in harmony with abiding prin- ciples and values, so that the problems of today and tomorrow can be met. Together I am confident we shall meet that challenge. The 48th Anniversary of the Proclamation of Independence of the Ukraine EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. MILTON R. YOUNG OF NORTH DAKOTA IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES Monday, January 24, 1966 Mr. YOUNG of North Dakota. Mr. President, January 22 marked the 48th 'anniversary of the proclamation of in- dependence of the Ukraine. On this oc- casion, Americans of Ukrainian descent all across the land took part in special observances to once again bring to the attention of the world how a free, inde- pendent nation was forced under the yoke of communism. In a recent letter to me, Dr. Anthony Zukowsky, president of the North Da- kota branch of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, Inc., discusses the special programs planned for North Da- kota. These included special religious services which were broadcast over ra- dio and television throughout a broad area of North Dakota. In his letter, Dr. Zukowsky made an excellent case for setting forth the ne- cessity of maintaining our commitment to the people of the Ukraine and other nations who live under Communist tyranny. We cannot forget these people and their desire to obtain freedom. We must continue to support them and help them to advance in every possible way the independence they seek. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con- sent to have Dr. Zukowsky's letter printed in the Appendix of the RECORD. There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: UKRAINIAN CONGRESS COMMITIM, OF AMERICA. INC., STATE BRANCH OF NORTII DAKOTA, Steele, N.
