        "text": "Currently, computers are used for everything in life. For example, from researching for a large essay project to playing video games with friends. “From the outset, computers were weighed for both military and commercial significance, and hence they straddled the very institutional boundaries that central to this study. It is also significant that computers became valuable research instruments in nearly all disciplines.” (Akera, 2). The first digital computer was constructed in 1946 by John Mauchly, a professor, and Presper Eckert, an inventor. “They met by chance in 1941 at the University of Pennsylvania’s Moore School of Engineering. They soon developed a revolutionary vision: to use electricity as a means of computing--in other words, to make electricity \"think.\"” (McCartney, 1). They were ignored by their colleagues, but in 1943 they were becoming more well known and was funded by the U.S Army. The U.S Army was seeking for a contraption that can quickly calculate ballistic missile trajectories in wartime Europe and Africa (McCartney, 1). John Mauchly and Presper Eckert led a team that constructed the computer that occupied 1,800 square feet and weighed thirty tons. They named the large computer, ENIAC, Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. The process of building this machine was not an effortless task, Mauchly and Presper and their team had to overcome many problems\n\nA dramatic transformation in the advancement of technology has continued to evolve since the 1950’s. As computers started out, they were very expensive to make, they were slow and the computers were very basic. Now in days people can carry computers in their backpack but in the 90s, the computers would take up a whole room. The reason their computers were so large was because they required magnetic drums to store memory for the computer and vacuum tubes as switches and amplifiers. Today, these devices are built into our computers and other time they made them more compact. Also, as time went on, we received faster and more advanced technology. We are still using computers from the 1950s today; they are just highly advanced versions of their\n\nHome technology has taken a gigantic step since the 1970s as not only has the performance improved, but more families have begun to feel a necessity to have these appliances. In 1977 the Apple 2 Computer was released to the public. What was then considered an “ordinary computer for ordinary people” is now seen only in museums and dumps. The personal computer was one of the first personal computer with no additional parts required to buy, such as cases for the computer or a way to supply it power. The Apple 2 was also had great graphics for its time and was very easy to use for normal people. We now have computers in our phones, but in the 1970s the Apple 2 was one of the only computer that you could effectively use at work, school, or at home (computerhistory.org). However, all of that is nothing compared to the computers we currently use. Now most families have a laptop computer that is portable and has a long battery life without having to remain plugged into a power outlet. The computers have gotten\n\nIn 1980 the computer world was dominated by two college dropouts named Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. They started the revolutionary Apple Computer Company in 1976 originally after building a prototype user-friendly computer. Even though computers were invented forty years earlier, the first personal computer was the Apple II and it sold in the millions until 1994. The personal computers were used in schools to instruct children in computer use (Kallen 96-97). Before they were used in that manner, they were once large machines and used only at universities, big companies, and military. As time changed millions of Americans soon had a ‘personal’ computer in their home. They could be use it to read newspaper stories, buy things, do schoolwork, and play games (“1970s and ‘80s”). What else was popular in the 1980s is that doctors identified a virus that causes AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, was considered an epidemic for the first time. The disease spread in several way such as through sexual relations and through sharing the needles used to take illegal drugs. As the years went by, it became increasingly careful for people with their own activities (“1970s and\n\nDuring the 1970s, technology in the United States was still growing as personal computers were not as popular due to their bulky size. Not only were computers large in their form, they also cost more than what an average working class American could pay for. Due to the steppe price of a computer, they were considered more of a novelty item rather than a necessity for everyday use. Although personal computers were not yet seen in homes,\n\nComputers in general give people the ability to complete tasks that would have taken days or weeks to complete with the clicks of a few buttons. As technologies continue to grow the amount of adjustments that will be needed to make will be astronomical. However, society is aiming to help people gain the skills needed to push mankind further. In Davidson’s essay, she discusses how computers and technology can be put to many applicable situations. While working with her students, the “Duke students came up with dozens of stunning new ways to learn [and] almost instantly students figured out that they could record lectures on their iPods and listen to them for leisure” (Davidson 52). This advancement took a few weeks at one college campus in the United States when the technology was still being developed. Now, students have adapted to begin working across the globe to further society with new ideas for applying these technologies. These students now work diligently to make technology as effortless as possible so that their programs will be what will be used in the future. Gilbert discusses how when people are judged by a panel of others they tend to feel worse about themselves but, when dealing with computers people are only judged by one computer which tells them\n\nA man with ambition to be better, is a man that is unstoppable. Standing tall, with a book in one hand and his other hand is reaching out towards you. He wants you to come and join him in furthering your education, he wants you to not let the circumstances and odds that are against you; hold you back from gaining higher education. He wants you to do so, at the university he founded himself, he is Dr. William Hooper Councill. The statue of Dr. Councill on Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, is a direct symbolization and representation of the extraordinary individual that he was. Dr. Councill knew that with education, he could hold power and change the lives of others, and that is exactly what he spent the rest of his life doing and is continuing to do so even decades after his death.\n\nWhen I move into my dorm for my first year of college, there is no question of which quote I would put onto my wall. Jimmy Dean, one of my favorite old school country singers, once said \"I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.\" This quote has really stuck with me. It reminds me that life will not always go my way and it is imperative that I learn to do deal with whatever the world may throw at me.\n\nClubs of America is the world’s first and foremost monthly gift club specialist since 1994.

After a career change, his father moved the family to Santa Monica, California, where they remained until the death of James’ mother, Mildred when he was 9 years old. Unable to care for his young son, Winton Dean sent James back to Indiana to live on a Quaker farm with his paternal aunt and uncle in Fairmount. James stayed in Fairmount through High School, where he played basketball and participated in the Speech and Debate and Drama programs. (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000015/bio) James Dean was a performer; he tap-danced, acted in plays and explored all avenues of the performing arts. After high school graduation in 1949, James moved to Los Angeles to study pre\n\nOne of the more aggravating aspects of attending a strict religious school is that if anyone suspects a student to be acting outside of what is considered “normal,” the faculty will immediately be informed. There are no secrets there. Gossip travels faster than sound, and no one in a position of authority will take “no” for an answer. The day my class began our end-of-term research papers, though, marked the moment I discovered how terrible it could be. I would never have thought my teacher to be the kind of person to bring up the issue personally, but as soon as we turned in our drafts, he asked me to stay after class. The problem, he explained, was that I had chosen an extremely controversial topic to write about,\n\nDean Martin was born June 7, 1917 in Steubenville, Ohio. When he was born his birth name was Dino Paul Crocetti. Dean was born to an Italian father, Gaetano, and an Italian-American mother, Angela Crocetti. Dean’s father was an Italian from Montesilvano, in Abruzzo. His affectionate grandparents origins are believed to also be from Abruzzo even if it is not clearly known. When Dean was growing up he did have an older brother named Bill. Dean did only speak Italian until he started school. Dean attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, Ohio. Dean was ridiculed for his broken English and did not speak any English at all until he was five. He spoke an old Abruzzi Italian dialect. When Dean was sixteen years old he dropped out of high school in 10th grade because he thought he was smarter than his teachers."
