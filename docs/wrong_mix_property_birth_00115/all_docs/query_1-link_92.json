Jim died June 1, 2020, at the age of 82.\n\nJim was a great example that you can do anything you want to, as long as you are willing to pay the price. He turned his love for radio into a career of inspiring young people by teaching at Fullerton College and running its fm station. He started a comprehensive program at Fullerton in 1981 and realized that he needed to enlarge his own academics. While running the program, he worked weekends at KWIZ and Unistar’s AM Only channel AND went back to school. From 1969 to 1973, Jim was “the Mighty Quinn” on KMEN-San Bernardino.\n\nHe received a B.A. degree in business management from the University of Redlands in 1988 at the age of 50 and didn’t stop there. Three years later he received his M.S. degree in career and college counseling. His students filled 27 shifts per week on KBPK-Fullerton. His vocational advisory committee includes some of the most respected names currently working in Southern California radio.\n\nJim talked about his love for radio: “This wonderful, sometimes frustrating business, ever challenging but the greatest of all industries and definitely the mistress that owns us all – radio.”\n\nBAIRD, Jon: KNX, 2007-23. Jon is a reporter at KNX.\n\nHe has been part of the KNX news operation since June 2007 while covering a huge fire at Lake Tahoe.

Their on-air persona consisted of sending “shout-outs” to friends and listeners, giving “props” to people they like and good-natured “dissing” to certain other people -- including each other.\n\nThey started at KPWR in 1993 with a two-hour Friday night hip-hop show that was so popular they were soon moved to all-nights, then late-nights and by early 1994, mornings. In an OC Register interview in 1994, Eric said, \"We dj on the radio, but we don't consider ourselves radio djs. Everything we know is self-taught. We came from the streets.\" Their father owned a teen club in Bakersfield where they grew up, which explains their moniker. Former \"Power 106\" pd Rick Cummings justified the unusual morning team: \"In a market like Los Angeles, you'd better do something that's a breakthrough kind of thing, or you'll get lost in the shuffle.\" Eric and Nick left KPWR in the summer of 1999 and surfaced in afternoon drive August 30, 1999 at the Beat. They left in the summer of 2000. After a year at KMEL-San Francisco, they left in late 2001. Eric and Nick Vidal moved to Miami in early 2003. They are now syndicated.\n\nBaker, Cory: KGBS, 1978-89.

Todd works mornings at WKQC-Charlotte.\n\nBorn and raised in Seattle on April 7, 1971, Todd started working at his high school station in Bellevue, Washington, KASB. “I used to play dj as a child growing up listening to KJR [Channel 95] in Seattle. I set up two stereos so I could ‘mix’ the music like I heard on the radio. After hearing the ‘Rick Dees Weekly Top 40,’ I had it in my head that someday I must get on the air in L.A.”\n\nTodd’s second job was “Y-100”-Gillette, Wyoming, followed by KLYK-Longview, Washington, KDUK-Eugene, “Z100”-Portland and in Seattle KJR, KUBE and KPLZ. He joined Westwood One in 1998 and hosts “Saturday Night 80s” on the weekend, and during the week he is heard on the network's Bright AC format.\n\nBALDWIN, Mel: KNX, 1951-66 and 1980-91; KNX/fm, 1971.

He was 96-years-old.\n\nDuring Mel’s time at the CBS O&O, he hosted \"KNX Food Hour\" with Jackie Olden and later Melinda Lee.

Born Willis Bennett Ballance, \"Billo\" and a graduate of the University of Illinois, Bill worked at KOA-Denver and WBKB/TV-Chicago in the early 1950s.\n\nOne of the original \"Seven Swingin' Gentlemen\" when KFWB went \"Color Radio\" in 1958, Bill worked mostly evenings. Bill went to Denver and San Francisco following KFWB where he had impressive success. He then went to Honolulu’s KHVH, was later pd of KGMB and then returned to the mainland to KNBR-San Francisco.\n\nBill suddenly skyrocketed when he converted the routine rock-jock formula at KGBS into the \"Feminine Forum.\" His most lasting claim in Southern California radio was that he was the first to openly address sexuality, issues of sexual intercourse and sexual preference. By 1972 his \"Feminine Forum\" was syndicated in a number of major cities, simulcast in San Diego and he won the Gavin award that year. Bill gave the phone lines over to the ladies and listened. He wouldn't even call them housewives. They were women in Bill's mind - educated and intelligent - and he treated them that way. Between calls, he played the hits.\n\nBill was profiled in every major publication in the country, as well as the London Times and a Cosmopolitan cover story. Time magazine said, \"Bill has many imitators, but no rivals.\"\n\nIn March 1973, a front-page story in the Times reported that executive vp of Storer Broadcasting, Peter Storer, felt that the image of Bill's program had been \"colored and damaged by less-restricted imitators.\" As a result, it was announced that the program would be dropped. The FCC eventually concluded his show was \"not obscene,\" but it was too late. For all the attention his show attracted, Bill did it with taste. He knew the line not to cross, but his copycats didn't, and Bill got the blame, never getting true credit for his bold, sex-oriented broadcasting. His brilliant command of the language prevented his KGBS show from being dirty. His show was a lot like the old girlie magazines. It wasn't total nudity - it showed just enough to make it tantalizing. His tome, Bill Ballance Reveals How to Cope, had five printings.

Bill was part of the morning drive show on KNAC.\n\nDuring his two decades at KNAC, Bill evolved from weekend news to news director to operations director. “This seems like a long time with one station until you consider it covered five different owners, three different formats and two different jobs. I saved a lot of money that would be spent moving from station to station, city to city, by letting the changes come to me.”\n\nBill was born on October 25, 1948, in Peoria, Illinois. “This was a great place to grow up, learn to love radio, then move away!” In high school, his radio class included a daily show broadcast live on a local station. “This pretty much sealed my fate. Over the next couple of years, I also discovered that playing the same records every day was not as much fun as I thought it would be, and that going out on the street to cover news was. All the while, I kept sending tapes to the stations in Chicago.” Bill’s new radio career was interrupted by a war in Vietnam, which brought him to the navy and eventually Southern California. “While Vietnam and the navy had no lasting attraction to me, Southern California did. The weather was obviously better than Chicago, I met the girl I wanted to marry, and this was the place to be in radio. I enrolled in both the radio/tv and journalism programs at Cal-State, Long Beach…. and I’m still here.” From 1995 until 2003, Bill was the operations manger for Liberman Broadcasting.Bill left his post as operations manager at Liberman Broadcasting in the summer of 2002.\n\nBANKS, Doug: KDAY; KHJ; KFI, 1978-82. Doug worked afternoon drive for ABC Radio Networks for many years. He died April 11, 2016, at the age of 57. He dealt with a long battle with diabetes and continued to advocate to his listeners on the importance of getting updated doctor check-ups. At the time of his death, Doug was working afternoons at WVAZ-Chicago.\n\nThe Philadelphia-born, Detroit-raised Doug Banks began his radio career as an on-air personality for his high school’s radio station. Local station WDRQ took note of his talent and hired him for a temporary late-night weekend disc jockey spot. Even though he was the youngest dj, he quickly earned a permanent position. After high school, Doug turned a six-week trial into a multi-year position at KDAY in Los Angeles.\n\nWhen he left KFI, he did his first morning show in Las Vegas at KLAV. Next was KDIA in San Francisco, followed by Chicago at WBMX (now WVAZ), where he took the morning show from a 1.8 share to a healthy 5.6, beating rival WGCI.\n\nAfter much success in the mornings, Doug was offered the opportunity to do a nationally syndicated show. The Doug Banks Morning Show, hosted by Banks along with DeDe McGuire, rose to become one of the top-rated syndicated urban programs in America. Each week, millions of listeners tuned in to hear some of the most creative and innovative programming on the airwaves.\n\nIn 2008, Banks re-launched his nationally syndicated morning show in afternoon drive under the new name ‘The Ride with Doug and DeDe.’ In 2010, Doug’s show again found a new home with American Urban Radio Networks, changing it’s name back to ‘The Doug Banks Show.’ Over the years, Doug has received numerous radio awards, including being honored at the 12th Annual Living Legends Foundation Gala in New York City for his outstanding achievements and contributions as a trailblazer in the radio entertainment community.

Before there was a Kevin & Bean at KROQ, there was Ramondo and The Blade. From KPRI-San Diego, Raymond came to KROQ in the fall of 1980 to work middays. In the early 1980s, he was part of the morning drive show, Raymondo & Evans, and in 1982 he teamed with Richard Blade on the popular morning show, \"Raymondo and the Blade.\"\n\nTami Heide wrote: “Ramondo, you were always a good friend to me. I remember when we would hang out with your orange kitties at your place in Burbank. A huge loss for the KROQ family.”\n\nFreddy Snakeskin: “Just in time for Christmas, some truly terrible news for the whole KROQ extended family. I hadn't talked to him for a couple years, and had no idea he was even sick.”\n\nApril Whitney: “Feeling very sad this Christmas Eve after learning of the loss of one of my favorite friends, Raymond Bannister. Nearly 40 years of laughing, being there for each other, supporting and encouraging each other, enjoying each other. I’ve been lucky to call him my friend. So many great memories. I don’t want to let him go. Love you Raymond. See ya on the other side.”\n\n“Ramondo was the first person to put me on the radio,” wrote Jim Poorman Trenton. “Raymond was quiet in real life, and never received the kudos he should have for being a transcendent radio talent and all-around good guy. He was also really funny. I appreciate all you did for me and our friendship. R.I.P. Dude.\"\n\nRichard Blade was the other half of the KROQ team of Ramondo and Blade. Richard wrote a book titled World in My Eyes. He devoted a chapter to his partner and acquiesced to allow highlights from that chapter. The following is from Richard Blade: “Ramondo and Blade were flying high. The two of us just clicked together on the radio. Ramondo’s dry American wit and precise timing matched with my British enthusiasm and music knowledge worked well with the listeners and in just a few months we had hit number one in the ratings in virtually all of KROQ’s key demographics. We were friends off the air as well. We had both had similar experiences in radio, paying our dues and coming up through the smaller markets. Raymond’s last gig prior to KROQ was in San Diego at the rock station KPRI and just like me, he had fallen into an open spot on KROQ. Our morning show had a team of characters who appeared on the air with us including Rhonda Kramer, our flirtatious traffic reporter, and two surf reporters – this was Southern California after all – Rockin’ Fig and the Poorman. But we still had no budget! KROQ was notorious for being cheap. Our salaries were miniscule and while every other morning show in LA had a producer, a writer and a talent booker Raymond and I only had each other. But we made it work and fortunately, because of our mammoth ratings every record company, movie studio and tv station would come to us and ask to have their stars appear on our show. And it wasn’t just the tv stations and press agents pushing to get their clients on the air with us, they also wanted to use our growing popularity and name recognition to promote their shows, newspapers, and magazines by booking Ramondo and the Blade to boost their ratings and sell copies. Suddenly it was Raymond and I who were in demand, which took us by surprise. There were times we would look at each other and think, Holy shit! We were featured in the Los Angeles Times, Daily News, LA Weekly, BAM Magazine, The Press Telegraph – virtually every publication in Southern California came after us. Then we got a call from Playgirl magazine. This was big. It was national and international but we said yes – except I insisted that there be no nudity. Four months after the shoot the magazine came out with Kurt Russell on the cover and for the next few weeks Raymond and I would be met at all our gigs by fans clutching the magazine and wanting us to sign it. I have to admit it was a little disturbing to have a fifteen-year-old girl approach you with a Playgirl in her hand asking for an autograph. The main thing that differentiated us, and the rest of KROQ’s airstaff, from every other station in the market was the music. We played what nobody else would play and we played it first. Music was defined and pigeon-holed by its categories; you had Top 40, rock, oldies, hip-hop etc. but in Southern California a new genre was born, K-Rock music. Everyone called it that. We owned certain bands: Duran, The Cure, The Smiths, New Order, Depeche Mode, The Police, Tears for Fears, Talking Heads, Missing Persons, Berlin, Oingo Boingo. If you went to a record store and bought an album from one of those groups, and many more, you were buying K-Rock music. It was a phenomenon. KROQ became an adjective. And it was everywhere. Clubs all over LA and Orange County staged “KROQ nights,” meaning that was the music you would hear if you went there that evening. No other station in America had that kind of influence or following and the record companies knew it. There always seems to be a yin and yang in life and even as the station soared and “Ramondo and Blade in the Morning” hit new ratings heights, cracks started to appear. Two years prior to my arrival at KROQ, Raymond had been running an errand for the station. He was on his motorbike heading to Perkins Palace in Pasadena to drop off advertising copy when he was hit dead on in an intersection. His bike spun off the road and Raymond was flung over the hood of the car, but his foot caught in the radiator grill and the jarring impact shattered multiple bones in his leg. KROQ had no insurance coverage to offer Raymond, and with no money himself he had to settle for his leg being put in a cast and left to heal the best it could. Now, nearly three years later, his limp was becoming worse every day as the still-unhealed, jagged bones ground together causing him excruciating pain. To deal with this daily agony Raymond tried self-medicating. Unfortunately, his medicine came in a six-pack. As 1983 rolled on Raymond’s drinking became worse and worse. Each morning he’d arrive in the studio with a brown bag holding his Budweisers. At first I was at a loss for what to say. He was obviously in pain, and the alcohol wasn’t affecting his on-air performance, but I knew it wasn’t right. When he moved from twelve-ounce cans to sixteen-ouncers it reached the point where I had to do something; I had to step in to help my friend. I had no medical training so I went to a doctor who had just joined the KROQ team to co-host the weekend show, “Loveline.” In truth he hadn’t finished his medical training yet and was still a resident but we all called him Dr. Drew. I explained the situation to Drew the best I could and asked for his advice. Drew told me that with those kinds of multiple fractures caused by a traumatic injury being improperly treated for so long, there was danger of numerous complications which was probably why Raymond was in such constant pain. When I asked what a worst-case scenario was, Drew looked at me and said three words, “Worst case? Amputation.” I couldn’t bear the thought of my friend, my partner on air, and the man who had willing shared with me his amazing radio skills and impeccable timing possibly losing his leg. The next day, after our show, I had a serious talk with Raymond. I told him that from now on there would be no alcohol in the control room and if he brought any in there would be trouble. The next morning Raymond showed up at the station in a shocking state, I had never seen him that bad before. Rather than bring the alcohol into the studio he’d sat in the parking lot out back and drank it, all of it, one sixteen ounce can after another! He was toasted. I couldn’t let him on the air like that, it wouldn’t have been fair to the station, it wouldn’t have been fair to me but most of all it wouldn’t have been fair to Raymond. I grabbed him by the shoulders and walked him outside the small control room into the corridor. He slumped to the ground and went straight to sleep. He stayed like that throughout the duration of the show, even as the staff arrived and the station came to life. After I got off the air I marched Raymond into Pat Welsh’s office and demanded that Raymond be given help. Pat listened intently and to Raymond’s and my surprise he promised to take care of it. That morning marked an end and a beginning. It was the beginning of Raymond’s long battle to recover from that work-related injury that KROQ should have taken care of years before. He first went through a series of operations which required that his leg be broken again, then pinned, reset and cast correctly. After that, he was placed in rehab which he embraced with open arms. But it marked the end of Ramondo and Blade. I was given something I didn’t want, a chance to fly solo in the mornings. If I’d had the choice I would have stayed Raymond’s partner for my entire radio career. I can think of no kinder, more talented, funnier person to have been blessed to work with. But it was not just a career choice, it was a matter of Raymond’s life. When Raymond returned to the station almost six months later, he was a new man: clean, sober and without even a trace of a limp. He was given the afternoon show and a chance to have a real life. I still talk with him often and refer to him as my Obi-Wan Kenobi. But to millions of KROQ listeners he’ll always be the anchor of the Ramondo and Blade show.\n\nBANOCZI, Jack. KGGK; KNOB, 1966-87.

When she left GDLA, Jillian said: “There are many theories out there. I’ve definitely shared the truth,” said Jillian. She said she loved what she did. “I would have stayed. I would have taken a pay cut. It wasn’t about money. They told me they wanted to put me out in the field a couple of days a week. Wasn’t sure if they meant out to pasture. They said they were going a different route. I told them the news was becoming a dinosaur and that we were all about big social media and that we should do Twitter and I told them I could help them do that and bridge the gap. They said, ‘nope.’ So I decided to walk away and it was very hard for me. That show is horrible now.”\n\nRegular viewers to Good Day LA on KTTV/Channel 11 knew that Jillian loved radio. She was always quoting from something Howard Stern said.\n\n“When she talks about radio and Howard, Jillian lights up like a Christmas tree,” said John about his broadcasting partner. “She knows more about the radio industry than she does about tv, which is odd considering she made her career in tv. She follows it very closely.”\n\nJillian was very open about her breast cancer in 2018, which had spread to her lymph node,” she wrote on social media. She underwent a double mastectomy to combat the cancer. “To be honest, I just want the boobs gone and the cancer outta me. Then tackle the lymph node.

After four years working evenings and as the production director, he moved to KPLS-Orange. Originally Spanish New/Talk “La Voz” (“The Voice”), KPLS was changing formats in early 1993, and needed one person to do production, on-air, and operations work. “The owners had discovered the dubious wonders of automation.” The new format was Minneapolis-based Childrens Broadcasting Corporation’s Radio AAHS. “This was a not-much-sleep period, as I was still full-time at KCAQ for a few weeks as well.” Soon KPLS was fully staffed, the AAHS Network was up to 32 stations, and Bruce was named network ops-manager for the West Coast.

It has never been stronger, so this summer I made the very difficult decision to retire from USC at the end of this year. Within a few days I received a call from the search committee of the Classical station in Seattle looking for a new ceo. After meeting with them it was clear I could make a contribution there, so I accepted their offer to lead KING/fm, and I will begin in January. It was the perfect next chapter for me: an opportunity to make a positive impact on a great station in an incredible city.”\n\nBrenda thinks it is the right decision for her. “It is difficult to leave a great job working with and for outstanding people within the USC Radio Group and USC. I will miss it more than I can say. My husband will continue to be here so we are keeping our house and I will come back weekends.”\n\nUSC is in the process of putting together a plan for the search, but they will definitely do a nationwide search for the next President of the USC Radio Group.\n\nBarnes, Clarence: KIIS, 1999-2006; KMVN, 2006-09.

Thirty years later, his father still sits in the same seat. Brian goes to all the games but now has a different seat. He’s in the press box calling the action as the “Voice of the Illini,” carried on 45 stations throughout the Midwest. Not only does he do football for the University of Illinois but he also calls men’s basketball for the school.\n\nBut we know Brian as the two-season play-by-play voice for the Anaheim Angels during the 1998 – 99 seasons. How he got here to be the Angels broadcaster with Mario Impemba is a wonderful story of patience, tenacity and a lot of luck. And his audition process is something you’ve never heard before.\n\nA native of Tolono, Illinois, Barnhart graduated from Unity High School and Liberty University where he broadcast many of the sporting events. His exposure to the world of sports offered by his father spawned the idea of becoming a broadcaster. He paid his dues. Brian served as the play-by-play voice of the Lynchburg Mets and Salem Buccaneers before moving up to the Oklahoma City 89ers, the Class AAA affiliate of the Texas Rangers, from 1988 – 94. Barnhart then did high school football and other sports play-by-play for 11 years. He was also the voice for Oklahoma Baptist basketball from 1992 – 94 and Oklahoma City Blazers minor league hockey in 1993. From 1996 – 98, he handled news, sports and play-by-play at WWLS in Oklahoma City.\n\nIn 1997, Brian started the process of sending out audition tapes. He felt that a half-dozen years with triple A baseball had prepared him well, so he was ready for the major leagues. Brian was interviewed in Dallas for an opening with the Texas Rangers and ironically, the Dallas Mavericks NBA team. “I used to be in close touch with Mark Holtz, who used to do the Rangers and passed away a few years ago,” said Barnhart by phone from his office at the University of Illinois. “He gave me some critiques and advice. He said, ‘You’re a big league guy and you’re going to make it.’ That was a big encouragement. He said my delivery style was conversational and he said that was a hard thing to learn to do. So I’ve always tried to be aware of that no matter what sport I was doing. I wanted to be sure the listener was comfortable with me on the air. And it was always important to be giving the score and what stage of the game we’re in and what inning was being played. It was a good reminder from him that people are always tuning in and out of a game all the time.”\n\nAfter an onslaught of tapes were sent to major league ball teams, the Angels gave Brian a call in February of 1998. “Bob Starr had been ill the summer before and Mario, who is now in Detroit, had been handling much of the load by himself,” Brian remembered. “Starr told the ballclub that he wouldn’t be back for the ’98 season. They went through a lot of tapes in a hurry. I didn’t know that I had sent one specifically to the Angels but I knew I sent a bunch of tapes out.”\n\nAngel exec Andy Roundtree called Brian and invited him to Anaheim for an interview. Apparently Brian’s tape was the best of the 100 audition tapes. “When I got on the plane to California it really helped me to have already gone through the interview process in Dallas the year before. I knew kind of what to expect when I got there and the type of questions that might ask, knowing that if I didn’t get it I would just stay in Oklahoma City and continue to keep sending out tapes. But I did feel comfortable as I anticipated a Major League interview.” Yet the interview/audition process took the most bizarre turn. Brian flew into John Wayne Airport in Orange County and was picked up by an Angels staff member. He was taken to the then-Doubletree Hotel near the stadium, off the 57 Freeway.\n\n“I wasn’t nervous but I was excited about meeting everyone the next day.” The next morning there was a ‘FanFest’ going on at the Angels Stadium parking lot with many booths, games and activities. One of the activities was a trailer where a fan could go inside, sit in front of a monitor and microphone, put on earphones to hear the roar of the crowd and call the play. After calling the play, the fan got a tape of his play-by-play as a souvenir. The play they had on the screen was Jim Edmunds who made an unbelievable over-the-shoulder catch in center field against Kansas City. That was the play the fans got to describe.\n\n“Andy Roundtree stood in front of the trailer and said, ‘This may be your audition. Go for it.’” Now Brian is standing in line with a bunch of pimple-faced young kids with baseball caps on backwards and Brian is in a jacket and tie. “I sit down and put on these little headphones and thought, ‘here goes.’ I've called a lot of plays in my minor league career in my life. I’m used to it. I got it done, nailed it and they really got the excitement that I would bring. I think it was a test to see how I would do under pressure. When I got done all these people were looking at me like, ‘Who’s that?’”\n\nRoundtree and Angels president Tony Tavares huddled outside the trailer and Brian saw Tony tell Andy to hire him. “Did I just see him say what he said? I think there were a couple of things going on. They already heard my tape and they wanted to meet me in person before they made a hire, and after they heard me in the trailer they knew I had enough experience to do the job. It was the most unusual interview I’d ever been involved with.” They offered Brian a two-year contract. He had no agent but he had been pursuing a Major League job for a lot of years. They were in a hurry and the money they offered Brian worked for him. “I didn’t know what a typical play-by-play guy made at this level but I knew it was more than I was making at the time, which was $2,500 a month for Triple A ball and that was for eight months out of the year. I was very grateful for the opportunity.”\n\nBrian was named Sportscaster of the Year in Illinois for 2008 by the Illinois Broadcasters Association, as well as the 2007 “Silver Dome Award for Best Sports Play-by-Play’ for his call of Illinois’ football upset of #1 Ohio State. The Sportscaster of the Year Award was just the second awarded to a downstate Illinois broadcaster since 1959 by the National Association of Sportscasters and Sportswriters. The others have all been from Chicago: Pat Hughes (Cubs radio) and Len Kasper (Cubs tv) were the other two finalists this year.\n\nBARON, Buddy: KEZY, 1975-76.

The station eventually switched to adult contemporary. In 1967, Baron hired Jerry Hahn, who had been working at KLFM (now KBUE) in Long Beach.

Rona was more than a gossip columnist who appeared regularly on Good Morning America and later The Today Show as an entertainment reporter, she was one of the most feared woman in the industry. Anne Helen Petersen recently wrote an in-depth profile of Barrett at BuzzFeed. \"At the peak of her powers — back in the mid-’70s, when she was essentially practicing therapy on stars while millions watched — Rona Barrett drove around Hollywood in a Rolls-Royce with a license plate that read MS RONA, the nickname she’d picked up when she first started delivering Hollywood tidbits at the end of the ABC Evening News.\" She also dispensed entertainment reports on KFWB and KABC during the 70s and 80s.\n\nRona moved to the Santa Ynez Valley (think Chumash Casino/Solvang) in the 1980s and started The Rona Barrett Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the aid and support of senior citizens.The Grand Opening of the Golden Inn & Village, which was inspired by her father, Harry.

Barbara had quite the Southern California career – radio, tv and announcing. You may best remember Barbara from her years at Country KZLA. She had a long run from 1979 to 1993. She bought a community radio station in the East Hampton, New York. When her parents died two months apart, she decided to buy their house and return to her roots where she was born. “I tried everywhere to get a job in L.A. and all I got was, ‘We’ve got our female on the air,’ or that I was too well known from Country music so I wouldn’t fit their format,” said Barbara. “When my parents passed away suddenly I just couldn’t pass up on this house. I am in the middle of the woods. Every morning there are about a half dozen deer outside my door waiting for some food. I live on a little lake in Southampton and my driveway is 100 yards long to the road. I just couldn’t pass up living here.”\n\nBarbara sold her house in Burbank and is now engrained into the community of her early youth. “I tried doing voice work for a group in Oregon, Nevada, and Tennessee, but it just never panned out in order to make a living at it. In 2003, we started working on this radio project with our congressman.” Barbara’s community is closer to Connecticut than it is New York City.\n\nShe landed and launched her radio career near Cape Canaveral at WCKS-Cocoa Beach and WLOF-Orlando. After a brief stop at WLEE-Richmond in 1978, she joined KZLA. \"During the next 15 years I saw 2 locations, 3 sets of call letters, 3 corporate owners, 4 formats, 5 general managers, 11 program directors [I stopped counting the morning men], 3 shifts and I never changed jobs.” During this time at KZLA, Barbara hosted Top 40 Videos on KCOP/Channel 13 and was the announcer on the syndicated Singles Magazine tv show. She left the station after the combo sale with KLAC.\n\nBarry, Bill: KMPC, KZLA; KOST; KGIL, 1984-92. Bill hosted The Channel 5 Theatre on KTLA from 1971 to 1981 and the weekly Pinbusters show.

Lee reported overnight traffic and news at KRLA until 2019. Born in Glendale, he grew up in the San Fernando Valley listening to Top 40 KHJ and KRLA in the 60s. “At age 14 I experienced true culture shock when my parents left L.A and all that great radio for the redwoods of northern California,” remembered Lee. In the redwoods he could only hear one local AM station, nothing on fm and “just a bunch of static wafting out of a very distant San Francisco.”\n\nAfter high school in Willits, Lee attended college at Humboldt State University as a Radio/TV/Mass Communications major with a minor in Journalism. He started working at the college station, KHSC/fm in Arcata before getting his first commercial radio job as a 17-year-old weekend jock at KINS-AM & FM in Eureka.\n\nFollowing a stint in the Navy, Lee obtained a First-Class FCC license from the Bill Ogden Radio Operational Engineering School, which helped him get a morning anchor gig at all-News KARM in Fresno. He went on to work for the NBC News/Information Service and eventually a station in San Luis Obispo, and then to make ends meet he joined the airlines industry where he spent 21 years.\n\nThen came 9/11. Lee was caught up in the massive airline layoffs after the 2001 terror attacks. In 2007 he answered an ad for a Traffic Producer job at Airwatch, computer skills and radio experience preferred. “I could do that! Within a few months, after a 27-year absence from radio, I was on the air again with a weekend news shift on Salem's KRLA(870 AM), doing fill-in work the rest of the week.” He did that for over a decade. He's now retired.\n\nBarry, Thom: KLAC, 1987-93. Thom is a successful on-camera commercial actor.\n\nBARTEL, Dennis: KUSC, 1975-80; KUSC, 2007-17. Dennis, aka James Bartel, worked mornings at KUSC, after fourteen years on-air at WGMS-Washington, DC. He stepped down at KUSC after being diagnosed with State 2 Parkinson's.\n\n“Beethoven had no use for critics. “Beethoven even wrote letters to the newspapers deriding critics,” said Dennis. “He felt that critics do a disservice more often than not. I guess I feel the same. We’re not talking about individual critics, I’m sure they take their work seriously and do the very best they can, but we’re talking about the very act itself. The act of criticism seemed to Beethoven harmful in some ways. One person’s red meat is another person’s cow dung. I think people should be left to decide for themselves on a work of art. Beethoven seemed to think the same thing.\n\nPreviously he was the founding program director and an on-air personality at WJHU-Baltimore (1986-1990), and dj at WQED-Pittsburgh. His book of short stories Voyeurs was published in 2006. It contains two stories set at radio stations. His second book, High’d Up, was published in 2015.\n\nBARTH, Paul: KWIZ, 1971-74.

He was the program director for WFSX 92-5 Fox News, in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nIn 2008, he responded to a LARadio questionairre on how to make radio better. \"I worked for one of the most successful talk radio stations in the country (New Jersey 101.5), and there is not one, single syndicated show on the station. I’m not saying that syndicated shows are bad. They aren't. If you’re running a talk station and you can get Rush Limbaugh, you take him. But, it used to be that you would have one, maybe two syndicated shows, and the rest of your day was local. Now it’s the other way around. If you had a major, local issue wouldn't it be better to have someone living in the area, knowledgeable about what was happening, going on your airwaves? Or, would you rather have someone 3,000 miles away who MIGHT reference it, in passing, just to keep some affiliates happy?\"\n\nBartley, Dick. Dick hosts a number of syndicated Oldies programs.\n\nBass, Dick: KMPC, 1976-87. Last heard, the former Ram running back was the customer relations executive for a trucking firm, ICX.\n\nBASTIDA, Don: Don was director of ops at TotalTraffic for Clear Channel until the spring of 2012.

As you know me, you know that I’m also a writer and in recent years I have been making short films.\n\nDon’s father was a butcher and meat cutter for over 40 years. Don's parents never quite understood why their son didn’t get a job that would take him to retirement. But since then, they have been supportive. The fact of the matter is, the world has flattened out and has been turned upside down. And once you think about it, you only get about 25,000 days on earth. How do you want to spend these days?\n\nBASTIEN, Brian: KPOL; KFWB, 1968-77; KBIG/KBRT, 1977-80; KFWB, 1980-83.

He's still in syndication, based at WABC-New York.\n\nFor seven decades he didn’t smoke, drink, or otherwise partake in dangerous behavior, according to the Princeton Alumni Weekly. \"So when Batchelor was diagnosed in October 2018 with oropharyngeal cancer — more specifically, a malignant tumor at the base of the radio host’s tongue that threatened his ability to speak on air — it came as a shock. Cancer meant surgery and radiation, fatigue, and changes to his distinctive voice — maybe even no voice at all.\"\n\nIn November, John entered Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for surgery. He opted to walk into the operating room, through the maze of identical corridors, rather than ride a gurney. Batchelor said he wasn’t scared until noticing a massive chart detailing his case for doctors as he lay down for surgery.\"\n\nHe awoke to find the surgery a success. Next came six weeks of radiation therapy. By the end of the six weeks, Batchelor’s voice was ragged. Batchelor is now encouraging middle-aged men to have themselves checked for the largely symptomless cancer caused by HPV, the human papillomavirus.\n\nBAUER, Jacque: KWIZ, 1980-82; KIQQ, 1981-82; KBRT, 1982. Jacque was 18 years old when she started the late evening shift on KWIZ. She later went to work for a Christian record label, returning to her home in Denver. She spent a year in South Bend working for a promotion company.\n\n\"I wanted to check in and say thank you for the mention about my amazing broadcasting years in Hollywood and other stations,\" Jacque wrote in the summer of 2021.\n\n\"I was in South Bend for a stint for one year at WHME/Pulse FM in 1996 and then I went to Colorado Springs and worked at a station there.\n\nIn 2000, Jacque changed careers and started working full time in the mental health field. \"I’m currently in Tampa and I am now a Licensed Mental Health Counselor, LMHC, with my own private practice, 'Get Psyched Behavioral Health Services.' My current website is www.getpsychedtoday.com. I value the broadcaster’s I worked with through the years. Working with the top voices in Hollywood, Bruce Chandler, Tony St. James, Jay Coffey and Jim Carson at KIQQ will always the best of my professional broadcasting career,\" concluded Jacqueline Bauer Gibb\n\nBAUGH, Jeff: KFWB, 1988-2008; KNX, 2008-17; KFI, 2017-23. Jeff was an exceptional airborne traffic reporter at the three major news/talk stations. He co-authored, Stick With Us & We'll Get You There. He died June 6, 2023, of lung cancer.

Jeff won multiple Golden Mikes for his outstanding reporting. He covered virtually every major story in Southern California for 30 years.\n\nHis parents were married on December 6, 1941. One can only imagine what their day-after-wedding was like as D-Day unfolded. His mother and father were pilots. She got her pilot’s license in 1939. “I seem to remember them since the beginning of my time - my mom taking me to air shows, trips to Prospect Park and Riis Park in Brooklyn,” Baugh recounted over the years. “Her spirit was flying with me every day.”\n\nA very personal bio is linked here.\n\nBAXTER, Danny: KDAY; KRLA, 1964-65; KHJ, 1968; KGBS, 1969. At KRLA his sports show was called \"Inside the KRLA Book,\" which offered sports predictions and sports commentary. Off-the-air, his colleagues marveled at what a marvelous handicapper Danny was, especially at baseball. He was sports director of KHJ's 20/20 News.\n\nBorn June 26, 1924, Danny’s parents gave him up at birth and he lived in a Jewish orphanage until the age of 5. “I was boarded out to a family in the Bronx, where I spent most of the time down the street with his best friend, Milton Nadworney, and his family,” remembered Danny. “Milton had two brothers and one sister and they were all attorneys who constantly encouraged and corrected my speech, until I spoke perfect English.”\n\nAt 14, Danny was taken out of school by his mother and put to work in a factory making dinner trays for inmates at Sing Sing Prison. He never made it to high school. At 18, hoping to be a baseball player, he joined a White Sox minor league camp, but he was cut as a player. Danny decided to become an umpire in the minor leagues and he did that for a couple of years. “I took a course in baseball business management at Florida Southern Institute,” said Danny. “While there, I was ‘discovered’ and went to Idaho Falls, Idaho, to announce minor league baseball games.” He went on to call games in Newport News, Virginia, Columbus, Ohio, and he worked as a dj in Detroit between baseball seasons. In 1960, when the California Angel franchise began, Danny worked hard to become part of the broadcast team, but was ultimately disappointed that he wasn’t signed. He was hired to write a baseball handicapping column for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.\n\nLater that year, he joined KDAY, doing double duty as a dj and sports commentator. “I talked the station manager into hiring Tom Clay who was in Detroit. They also brought in Alan Freed and we also had Art Laboe in the afternoon. Two years later I joined KRLA. While at KRLA, a poll conducted by the Herald-Examiner showed me in a close second place behind Vin Scully as the most popular L.A. sportscaster,” remembered Danny.\n\nAt KRLA his sports show was called “Inside the KRLA Book,” which offered sports predictions and sports commentary. Off-the-air, his colleagues marveled what a marvelous handicapper Danny was, especially at baseball. “I credit ‘Emperor Bob’ Hudson for making a large contribution to whatever popularity I attained while at KRLA because Hudson was constantly talking with me about his knowledge of baseball – the game and its history.” Danny went on to work for KGBS, KHJ, KLAC, KFOX, and KHJ/Channel 9. He slowed down in 1982 following open heart surgery. Danny’s formal sports background began with his graduation from George Barr’s National League School for Umpires, according to a KHJ sales sheet. While a faculty member at New York City’s Cambridge School of Broadcasting, Danny originated and taught a sportscaster’s curriculum that covered all major American sports. Danny has umpired professional baseball throughout the South. His sports broadcasting credits include baseball play-by-play in Idaho radio, football play-by-play in Virginia and Ohio, and three years of radio coverage of the entire Southern California sports scene.\n\nDanny was living in Las Vegas when he died in August 2010, at the age of 86.\n\nBAXTER, Dennis: KCAA, 2004-09.

Born to late, I thought, but hey what's old is new again and that is what's happening with audiobooks. Acting the parts of several characters, not just reading. Funny how the world goes round.\"\n\nBAXTER, Ed: KROQ: KMPC; KIIS.
