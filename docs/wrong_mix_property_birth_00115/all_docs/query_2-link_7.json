        "text": "Dear DMFC : Hi, my name is Patty and I have been a fan of Dean Martin for a long time now. I grew up listening to his music at my grandparents and never appreciated it until about ten years ago. I am going to Vegas soon and I was wondering if anyone has seen the show \"The Rat Pack Is Back\" and if it is worth seeing. Where in Vegas can I to get some good memorabilia?\n\n(Patty - Ohio)\n\nDear DMFC : What a fun web site !!!! Good Job !\n\n(Richard Schultz)\n\nDear DMFC : I remember watching Dean Martin movies with my Dad as a child, everytime we would watch one my Dad would sing \"everybody loves somebody sometime\". It became our song I've been in love with Dean ever since. My Dad passed away February of 95 and Dean passed on December of the same year. It was like loosing my Father all over again. Now, listening to Dean Martin songs brings back only wonderful memories. Thank you so much for the Dean Martin Fan Center.\n\n(Rena)\n\nDear DMFC : I'll admit right off the bat I haven't always been a big fan of Dean Martin. But I didn't know anything about him until a few years ago, when I saw Swingers for the first time. I got the soundtrack, sang along to it, and since then, Dean's my man! His stuff (or that which I've been able to find) just hits me, you know? So now I look him up on the web, and this contest pops up, and there's an amazing amount of info to go along with it! Schweet! So that's why I'm entering. Hey, next year for one of my best friends' wedding, I'm singing \"You're Nobody 'till Somebody Loves You\" as the first dance! I'm pretty exited about that, and honored that they think my voice can do justice to Dean Martin. The cool part is, the groom is the guy I've known forever, but his fiance is the one who came up with the idea of me singing! I mean h***, I've made a name for myself at karaoke, but who would've guessed this'd happen?\n\n(Stitch)\n\nDear DMFC : I have just purchased the book, \"Backstage at the Dean Martin Show\" from my local bookstore, and found your flyer inside. The book is an absolute gem, and now that I have seen your web site, it only compliments everything and make a complete set for the avant Dean Martin fan. I see that you have a fan club that I can join, so I'm going back to investigate that page again. Thank you for all you have done.\n\n(Jeremy Howard - Oklahoma)\n\nDear DMFC : Hello. I've just got my hands on the \"We open in Venice\" recording. I just love these guys.\n\n(Michael Pettersson - Sweden)\n\nDear DMFC : Just a note to say that I really enjoyed the site. Dean was a tremendous influence on me. I loved his easy going personality and casual way with a song. Thanks for all that you do to keep his legacy alive for coming generations. All the best,\n\n(Lamar Pecorino)\n\nDear DMFC : My name is Filomena and I am an Italian American. I, my Parents, my 93 year old Grandmother, Siblings, Fiancé', and so many people I know are all Dean Martin Fans. My 22 year old cousin has all of Dean Martin's CD's. His movies, music, life, everything , were all so amazing and forever will be. He was an incredible Person as well as a wonderful entertainer. My Parents are turning 65 and 70 this month. Even if we do not hear from anyone we will always be the Biggest fans of Dean Martin. Thank you for your time and attention. God Bless All those associated with the Dean Martin Website.\n\n(Pat and Maria Cristina D'Amato - Massachuttes)\n\nDear DMFC: Can I just say simply that I am a big Dean Martin Fan?\n\n(Carolyn Lutter - England)\n\nDear DMFC : Just adding on to the email on Dean Martin's appearances on the Academy Awards. In fact, it was 1959, and Dean presented the Best Song award. He did not sing on that show. However, it should be noted he DID sing the nominated songs on several Academy Award shows. These included 1950 (Through a Long and Sleepless Night) 1951 (Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo with J. Lewis), 1954 (That's Amore), 1955 (Three Coins in the Fountain), 1956 (The Tender Trap), and 1958 (All the Way). Hope this helps out to all who may have wondered.\n\n(Steven Silverman - California)\n\nDear DMFC: My name is Robert Clarke Ford III. I consider Dino Paul Crocetti aka Dean Martin, to be the greatest entertainer of all time. Even greater than Sinatra. I consider 'Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime' to be the greatest song of all time. My second favorite is 'I Will'. I am so glad I found this site. I am interested in all aspects of his life. Please, let me hear from any fellow Dino freaks like I am. Right now, I am going to go listen to one of his CD's. I could listen to him everyday. I think June 7 should be a national holiday. I am saddened each Christmas for obvious reasons. But to me, Dino will live forever. Thank God for Dean Martin.\n\n(Robert Clarke Ford III)\n\nDear DMFC : Hi, Have been enjoying Dean Martin for many years. Have a question that has plagued me for a while...in which movie did Dean Martin sing \"Innamorata\"? Hope you can answer it...then, maybe I can get some sleep!! Thanking you in advance.\n\n(Lucy Weber)\n\nHi Lucy - The movie was \"Artists and Models\", one of Dean and Jerry's best. \"Innamorata (Sweetheart)\" spent twelve weeks on the top 100 in 1956.\n\nWeb Director - Dean Martin Fan Center\n\nDear DMFC : Hi, In addition to Deans' surprising Jerry on the Eddie Fisher show, The two were together one other time if memory serves me correctly. It was on the Academy Award TV show of either 1958 or '59. Jerry was the host and Dean one of the presenters.( He may have performed one of the nominated songs as well,but I'm not sure about that). At the finale all the presenters were on stage with Jerry and he got a big laugh when he cracked, \"... and they said Dean and I would never be on the same stage again.\"\n\n(Dennis Brislen - Nebraska)\n\nDear DMFC : My name is Michelle Burnette, and I am totally infatuated with Dean Martin. I am 15 years old, and have loved all of Dean's movies, and music for a little over 8 years now. I have so much of his stuff on my walls, and I am always watching his movies and listening to his cd's all the time. I love all of his songs, and have around 10 of his cd's right now. I have a lot of his movies that he is in : Ocean's 11 , Artists and Models, a four pack of Dean's and Jerry's Comedy hours, Robin and the 7 Hoods, and others. I have some posters of him across my walls, that include him with the Rat Pack in front of the Sand's.\n\nAll of my friends think I am crazy and weird because I like him, but\n\nthey have grown accustom to me liking him now. I have always wanted to go to Steubenville, Ohio to see all of his sites and his foundation. I was suppose to go this year with my friends family, but they decided not to go, and I was kinda upset. I love the site on Dean Martin, and copy the Tv Schedule all the time so I know exactly when his movies are going to air, and make sure I am definitely able not to miss them. I watch the movies that I have over and over, because I cannot get enough, and they don't get \"old\". I also listen to his cd's all the time. I love the song \"That's Amore\" the most out of every other one, because that is the first song that I heard that he sung.\n\nThe first time I ever saw dean was 8 years ago on a western that I\n\nwas watching with my dad ( I love Westerns). I had never seen him before, so I asked my dad who he was, so I went and found some cd's and a movie and fell in love with it all. I am also a member of your fan club this year, my parents finally they said I could only sign up for one year. Well thanks for all the information you guys put on the website, and I think that Dean Martin is better than any other singer and actor out there, and he will always be to me. I think that I am really his number one fan! Your Friend,\n\n(Michelle Burnette - Maryland)\n\nDear DMFC : We all know about the trillions of fake autographs that are being sold by people, mostly on the Internet. Now some of these these people are choosing to hide the bidders names so they are 'protected'. Protected from WHAT?!?! They are being protected from other's informing them of their fake autographs. And would you believe that innocent people out there are STILL bidding on these fakes? When will they learn? Oh well, But that isn't the real reason that I am writing. I have recently become aware of two other quick scam artists. One of them says that he has personal jewelry that belonged to one of the family members that he wants to sell. Another is an expert in record awards, and has been 'putting together' record awards (so called Dean Martin's) from various other REAL awards that are of lesser (non valued) artists, in order to command top dollar from the fakes. I just wanted others to be aware of these if you get contacted or see them for sale anywhere. COA's don't mean a thing unless they are from a very reliable source. (I love the guy who sells hundreds of Dean Martin photographs verified by a \"Forensic Expert\", and he even has a name made up for him!).\n\n(James Rothkoph - New York)\n\nDear DMFC : I know that Dean Martin had his own company to handle (and own) all of his work in motion pictures, recordings and television. Who was responsible for the decision to start the company? That had to have been one of the smartest moves in Dean's career.\n\n(Cody Barken - AUSTRALIA)\n\nHi Cody - A fellow by the name of Herman Citron. Very well know as a power agent at MCA, one of his clients was Dean Martin. It was Citron that started the trend for actors, actresses, screenwriters and authors to get a \"back-end\" royalty for their work. He was also the person responsible for starting \"Claude Productions\" with Dean (Claude was a shorter name for 'Claudine', one of Dean's daughters). Dean was able to have control of his future contracts and deals from 1960 on, by having his company administer the deals and scheduling. It was run like any big company with monthly meetings that both Dean and Jeanne would attend, along with appointed officials.\n\nLater on, Dean would also open many other companies to manage his assets, such as \"Ricon\" for his real-estate holdings (named after Ricci), Sasha Corporation (named after Sasha), etc...\n\nWeb Director - Dean Martin Fan Center\n\nDear DMFC : I left a message earlier, but I had another question that I forgot that I have been wanting to know. I have always heard that Dean Martin did not do anything with Jerry Lewis on TV or in the movies until they met again on stage when Frank Sinatra had Dean walk onto Jerry's MD Telethon. If they DID appear together at least once before, could you tell me at least once when they did?\n\n(Lonnie Tyler - Pennsylvania)\n\nHi Lonnie - On September 30, 1958, Dean surprised Jerry Lewis who was the guest on Eddie Fisher's Show, by walking on for a brief few minute, with a gleam in his eye you could see that he startling Jerry.\n\nWeb Director - Dean Martin Fan Center\n\nDear DMFC : Everyone in Steubenville, Ohio has their own Dean Martin story including my mother. Her favorite was that Dean's Mom was a seamstress and neighbor of her's on Sixth and Slack Street and eventually made my Mom's wedding dress while taking numerous fittings. Dino would somehow always be around telling funny stories, telling her in a kidding was not to marry my Dad to marry him. So instead of marrying Dino, she let him lead the wedding march at the reception.\n\n(Klajon - Ohio)\n\nDear DMFC : Thank you KDKA 1020 for the stories of Dean Martin!\n\n(Millie Smyth)\n\nDear DMFC : Wednesday morning I tuned into the Rob Pratte radio show on KDKA and heard his tribute to Dean Martin with Neil Daniels as his guest. All I could think of to say was: Memories Are Made of This, that's amore!\n\n(Carmine Catena - Pennsylvania)\n\nDear DMFC : I first saw Dean Martin in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Hotel when I was staying there on a business trip. I didn't want to go to his show, because I was a much younger person at the time, and thought that Dean Martin was for my parents. With the unanimous vote of the group, I went along anyway thinking I was just going to stop gambling for an hour and a half, to wait for Dean's show to end. Boy was I ever stunned! Not only was the presence of Dean Martin felt from the time he walked out onto the stage, but he captivated every minute of my attention with his natural singing and down to earth ways. The next night while everyone was off seeing Paul Anka down the strip, I was back at the MGM seeing Dean's show again. I have been back to Las Vegas several time since, but it is not the same. It is now so different, that I am so glad that I was able to see it how it use to be, and that I was able to sit front row at both Dean Martin shows that I saw.\n\n(Gail O'Connell - Illinois)\n\nDear DMFC : Just a few weeks ago I attended the party in Steubenville for Dean, and by accident tonight I turned on the radio and caught part of the show that KDKA had with Neil Daniels (who was at the party in Steubenville with Dean Martin's daughter, Deana Martin and her husband). I have had the happiest past few weeks that one can imagine. I now have this crazy urge to go out the the mall and with my credit card, buy up ever Dean Martin cd and movie that I can find. If they don't have it, I see that I can order stuff through your website, but that means that I'll have to wait a few days to receive it, and I may not be able to sleep, waiting.\n\n(Joan - Unable to sleep in Ohio)\n\nDear DMFC : Please tell Mr. Daniels and Mr. Pratte that the show they did about Dean Martin brought back so many wonderful memories. I was only a kid when I first heard of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. They entertained me for the rest of my life, even after they broke up the act, I still went to Jerry Lewis movies and listened to Dean Martin songs. Then as the years went on, it was a pleasure to watch TV and see Dean on his TV show, and Jerry doing his good work for the MDA on his telethons. My kids bought me a computer last Christmas, and it is so great that I have been able to learn at my age how to use it, because now I can visit your Dean Martin pages, and still keep knowing that Dean is with us. By the way, I'm 65 years old today!\n\n(Richmond Polena)\n\nDear DMFC : It's almost 3:00 AM here in Pittsburgh, and I could not wait to log onto your website address to find out all I could about my favorite singer of all time. Your program on KDKA is just excellent and I wish that I could have gotten through to ask you a question about Dean's drinking image, but you had answered it for another caller. This is so great!\n\n(Lonnie Tyler - Pennsylvania)\n\nDear DMFC : What a wonderful website! Growing up in this day and age I find it sad that we no longer have the influence of the \"glamour\" and smooth ways of the \"rat pack\". I was lucky enough to grow up with my grandparents who were big fans of Frank Sinatra, Benny Goodman, and my Grandpa's favorite - Tony Bennett - but as soon as I heard the golden voice of my love, Dean Martin, that was it for me. He was and always will be the epitome of \"cool\" to me - even though I am only 21 years old - age doesn't have to be a factor in appreciating true\n\ntalent and good looks. Although, sheepishly I have to admit my favorite song by him is the Christmas song that used to be played in my house during the holidays \"Baby it's cold outside\" (I believe it's called)...I just swoon like I'm living in 1960 when I hear it. :-) Anyway...thanks for the great site and I'll be back soon.... Sincerely,\n\n(Josie Brown)\n\nDear DMFC : I know that I am a bit late in leaving a message about the birthday party in Ohio, but I am so glad that Deana Martin was there on behalf of her father. I think that the family will be surprised to see how much of us still love their father.\n\n(Meredith Downing - Pennsylvania)\n\nDear DMFC : Your last issue of the Fan Club Magazine was great. I very much enjoyed the two articles on Nicholas Pike and the book signings with author Lee Hale. You keep us all up to date on everything. Would you please do an issue on the family of Dean's. What are his children up to, and the rest of his family? Thank you,\n\n(June Loriety - SWITZERLAND)\n\nDear DMFC: I just noticed a letter from JJ Farmer, where he says no one will remember Dean Martin in the future. I so strongly agree with your comments about the TV shows, but Dean will Never be forgotten. The proof of his memory living on forever is in the very website we are all looking at right this minute. Look at all the fans and all the current information that is here. I read posts from so many people that think the same way I do.\n\n(Barbie Atherton - CANADA)\n\nDear DMFC : I recently taped a program off E! that was all about Dean Martin. At the end I found your website address and was thrilled to find an organization like your for Dean Martin. He will always be remembered for his warm personality and great singing voice. I didn't like the very end of the special, but it seems that all these type of documentaries always try to find something 'seedy' to leave everyone wanting more, even if it's cheap shots.\n\n(Charles Spader - Washington)\n\nDear DMFC : I know that this sounds strange, but my first real love took me on our first date to a county fair on the 4th of July. We watched fireworks and he had Dean Martin music on the radio as we both had the best time and fell in love with each other. Now, every 4th of July, when I see fireworks, I always think of Dean Martin, and think about my first real love. By the way, I married my first real love almost 46 years ago, and we are still very much in love today.\n\n(Betty Mazeroski - Maryland)\n\nDear DMFC : Happy 4th of July. Here's to the biggest bright light in the sky, Dino ! Shine brightly down on us pallie.\n\n(R. Weiss - California)\n\nDear DMFC : I just discovered your web site from the True Hollywood Story on Dean Martin. He seemed to be a very interesting and well loved man. I am more curious about him now, than ever.\n\nRichard DeMark - New York)\n\nDear DMFC : Another half a year has gone by and still no TV shows. By the time anyone gets around to finally seeing them, no one will remember who Dean was.\n\n(J.J. Farmer)\n\nDear DMFC : I can not in adequate words express the feelings of loss over the passing of Dean Martin. Dean meant a lot to me throughout the years and as I love the way his music touched me, I nonetheless still ache from the loss...I hope you understand. Love, David\n\n(David 'Gentlebeing')\n\nDear DMFC: 'Rat Pack' is back out on the street by Mike Weatherford of the Review-Journal : Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack once had the run of the Strip. But a tribute show called \"The Rat Pack is Back\" will be homeless for a second time after it closes at the Sahara August 13. Sahara officials said Wednesday the show co-produced by entertainer David Cassidy will leave so it won't compete with an upcoming production starring magician Steve Wyrick, in which the Sahara has a larger financial interest. Both shows are priced in the $35 to $40 range, noted John McManus, the hotel's executive vice president and general counsel.\n\n\"We want to focus on Wyrick and building his show,\" McManus said. The Congo Room inhabited by \"Rat Pack\" will house a \"value-oriented\" afternoon or evening revue, with a low ticket price to generate foot traffic, McManus said.\n\nCassidy is on vacation this week. His publicist, JoAnn Geffen, said the entertainer and co-producer Don Reo are already in discussions with other hotels about a new home for the five-member cast and 12-piece band.\n\n\"The Rat Pack is Back\" first played at the Desert Inn from July to early December 1999, during which time it came under legal fire from Sinatra's heirs in a trademark infringement suit that's still pending. The show reopened March 25 at the Sahara. Though the Sahara venue is called the Congo Room, it's actually a retrofitted banquet room far removed from casino traffic. The original Congo Room was demolished in hotel renovations.\n\n\"The room was wrong and the hotel was wrong, but even in a bad place it did business,\" \"Rat Pack\" music director Lon Bronson said.\n\n(Barbara Pazmino - International David Cassidy Fan Club)\n\nDear DMFC : When Dean Martin had his show on NBC \"The Dean Martin Show\", is it fact or rumor that he received RCA stock for payment ? We understood that he perhaps had a controlling stock interest in the RCA company, and is it still in the Martin family ?We were told it was seen on biography? Thanks,\n\n(Bert Marv)\n\nHi Bert - Yes, RCA stock was a perk included in Dean's contract with NBC. No, he didn't have any controlling interest, but had a lot of shares that divided into multiple dividends worth a lot during the peak yield years. The RCA stock that Dean had does not exist as it did when he accumulated it. RCA had sold NBC to General Electric, and all common shares were called in and paid off about 15 or 20 years ago.\n\nThe family trust does have interest in many areas including other company shares and land ownings as well as control of the legacy of TVshows, Reprise Masters and a lot of other interests.\n\n(Web Director - Dean Martin Fan Center)\n\nDear DMFC : I just found your site for my favorite singer. It looks like I'm not alone. Thank you all Dean Martin Fans for lighting up my day by finding more of you out there!\n\n(R. Franklin)\n\nDear DMFC : I was wondering why Capitol hasn't released more of Dean Martin's Reprise material. I had heard that they were going to start in June bringing everything out. There is so much that we would like to hear from the original recordings.\n\n(Lisa Sarnay - ENGLAND)\n\nLisa - Since Capitol Records was recently acquired by Time/Warner in a merger/buyout deal, everything has been put on hold for the time being.\n\nThe whole MP3 market is also playing havoc on the record companies, and what they want to do with their catalog divisions at this point.\n\n(Web Director - Dean Martin Fan Center)\n\nDear DMFC : I heard about your fan club for Dean Martin on the Regis Philbin and Kathy Lee Show last week and the party you have for him in Ohio. I am glad to find a place to read all about my favorite singer and performer.\n\n(A. Harmon - Washington)\n\nDear DMFC : There is a bar here in Ireland called \"The Lounge\"that has started a show with singers playing Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra. The people in the area are going happy with excitment to see and hear the music once again. Everyone is crowing the bar at showtimes and it is always sold out. It is wonderful and they are good lads with good voices.\n\n(Perry Brown - IRELAND)\n\nDear DMFC : The latest newsletter is better than ever. I loved the story about Deana and her husband surprising the couple. It's nice to hear about Dean's children being as nice as their father seemed to be.\n\n(Tom Vaughn - Arizona)\n\nDear DMFC : Hello fellow Dino fans! The E! True Hollywood Story show about Dean will be rerun this week on June 27 at 9:00pm, June 28 at 10:00am and 4:00pm, and again on July 1 at 4:00pm. All times are Eastern/Pacific.\n\n(Dan Wilson - South Dakota)\n\nDear DMFC : I just received my latest copy of the Fan Center's magazine, and it is great! Thanks for the article on the new movie \"Return to Me\" and the interview with Nicholas Pike. It was very interesting. Keep up the good work!\n\n(Richard Taylor - New York)\n\nDear DMFC : I would just like to say that my wife and I attended the Steubenville weekend for the first time this year, and boy, was it fantastic! We really enjoyed the evening of film clips, the wonderful church service and the entertainers. It was a real thrill meeting Deana Martin, and having the opportunity to question her personally! It was also great to meet people, such as Mario and Helen Camerlengo, who knew Dino as a child and remember his parents also! And to see Steubenville itself and thereby try to understand Dino's young years has enriched our appreciation of his accomplishments. Our heartfelt thanks to all who make this possible. May they continue to do so with such enthusiasm, sincerity and warmth in the future. Every one who has an opportunity to attend in the future should plan to do so. We'll see you again!!Arrivederci!!\n\n(Kevin and Karen Grubb - Maryland)\n\nDear DMFC: I attended the Dean Martin Festival in Steubenville this year and had a fantastic time. It was so great to see and meet Deana Martin and John Griffeth. They were very gracious to all the fans signing autographs and sharing fond memories of their lives with Dean. The festival was highlighted by impersonators Tom Stevens and Joe Scalissi. At one point while Tom Stevens was performing Deana came up to the stage where Tom sang to her. Then she stood with him on\n\nstage and they both sang \"I Will\", Deana's favorite song. I bought one of Tom Stevens' CD's and his card was inside with his web site address on it. I would like to pass this along to all of Dean Martin's fans www.deanofdeans.com. Thank you for having such a great site commemorating one of the greatest entertainers of all time.\n\n(Bea Rodriguez - New York)\n\nDear DMFC : I just saw a listing on \"The Travel Channel\" for a show called \"Travel Channel Secrets : Rat Pack's Las Vegas\". I don't know anything about it, but it may be interesting. They list it for Monday, June 26 9:00 PM in my area. Maybe they will show clips of the Rat Pack? Who knows?\n\n(G. Swoger)\n\nDear DMFC : Dean Martin still rules!\n\n(Kevin Carnes - Washington)\n\nDear DMFC : I have just bought the \"Return to Me\" box set of cd's from the Bear Family and it is so excellent. You have done a fantastic job and I am hoping that you will continue this with the Reprise years of Dean's recordings next.\n\n(Lorrie Trauner - UK)\n\nDear DMFC : The MSNBC Special about Dean Martin was great! just saw a rerun of it and it did not dwell on any negative stuff and was packed with a lot of footage and clips.\n\n(Terry Ann Miller - California)\n\nDear DMFC : I thought that Dean Martin's birthday was on the 17th, but after reading the correct date (7th), I am still confused why Dean's party was on the 17th instead of the 7th. This is all so confusing.\n\n(Ted Monroe - Arizona)\n\nHi Ted - Dean's birthdate is the 7th. The reason that Steubenville, Ohio pushed the celebration ahead a week later was because the actual weekend conflicted with the many graduations and parties , and hotel rooms were filling up fast. They put it off a week to give more people and families a chance to make it this year. The turnout was great.\n\nWeb Director - Dean Martin Fan Center\n\nDear DMFC : I have just read the letters from people who went to the party for Dean Martin. I am so mad that I missed it from what I have read. Even Regis Philbin mentioned your club and party on his show, and I only live a few hours away. I am still kicking myself!\n\n(Mike Greenleaf - West Virginia)\n\nDear DMFC : I had a wonderful time this year at the party in Steubenville. It was a wonderful day. Deana Martin and her husband spent the whole day entertaining the crowd, and having a good time talking and taking pictures with everyone. For those that missed this year's party - you missed a great time! I know that the fan center will have pictures and stories from it in their magazine, so it will give me another chance to remember the fun. Thank you guys for everything. It was the best thing that's happened this year!\n\n(Joey Stamos - Pennsylvania)\n\nDear DMFC : The people that are behind the scenes in Steubenville really deserve all the credit. I have attended the weekends every year for the last three, and have spoken to many of the volunteers that actually sit there and miss all the shows and fun, just to man the booths and watch over everything. These folks are the ones who really deserve the applause. It's their hard work and efforts that raise the monies for the hospitals and schools, and they don't get any recognition. Thank you folks behind the scenes that give us all the joy of your hard work!\n\n(Clair Lorre - Ohio)\n\nDear DMFC : I don't think anyone mentioned anything about the church service that was held for Dean at the church that he attended as a child. It was so moving and so very nice. Deana Martin even said a few words about her father during the service. I too, also loved seeing those clips of Dean from his TV shows. It was nice to be able to ask both Deana and Neil Daniels questions, and having the correct answers given to us instead of hearing what others make up to say. I am also glad to see that Dean's family really did care about him, and are such down-to-earth like we all picture Dean being.\n\n(James O'Neal)\n\nDear DMFC : We are members of the fan club, and were so thrilled when we read about the news of the party they were having in Dean Martin's hometown. We live in Canada, so we had plenty of time to plan our vacation. It was so much fun and so exciting to see Deanna Martin there talking all about her father. The funny thing is that everything was absolutely free. That made me think. I can't recall ANYTHING being free, and having so many people turn out, all having a good time!\n\n(Mr. & Mrs. Tunney - CANADA)\n\nDear DMFC : WOW--- My husband and I had such a wonderful time. Your president spoke with us for the longest time, and was so nice. He gave us his card with your web address, and we didn't even know about all of this that they have for Dean Martin until we heard about it on the radio when he was being interviewed. Seeing Dean Martin's daughter made me almost cry, remembering just how special her father was to us through out the many years. She seemed to be having so much fun.\n\n(Karen Shoppe - New Jersey)\n\nDear DMFC : You guys put on one hell of a good time. Thank you so much for the fun weekend in Steubenville, Ohio. We planned our vacation this year around the event and will do the same next year. For those who missed it, you missed a great weekend!\n\n(Richard and Ginny MacDonald - New York)\n\nDear DMFC : I just left the film festival in Steubenville, Ohio where I had the best time! First of all, Neil Daniels brought a tape of clips and outtakes from Dean's shows that was very professionally assembled as a show in itself. It was FANTASTIC!. Then someone asked him if any of Dean's children would ever show up in Steubenville, when Neil said that he would leave that answer up to someone else, and this very attractive lady walked up and introduced herself. It was Deanna Martin. She was so gracious and even spoke to the crowd and asked if anyone had questions themselves. Since there was no announcement of them being there, it was the biggest surprise and so exciting to know that I was there for it! I will try and give more reports tomorrow.\n\n(Joey Stamos - Pennsylvania)\n\nDear DMFC : I saw your president, Neil Daniels on our NBC station during the news being interviewed, when the announcer said that a very special guest was going to arrive later. I decided to wait until tomorrow's day long party and skip the film festival tonight, when the late news came on and they said the Dean Martin's daughter was the special surprise guest. Now I kick myself for not going tonight! Will she be there tomorrow? I would just love to even get a glimpse.\n\n(Sue Sheppard - Ohio)\n\nDear DMFC : I first saw Dean Martin in the movies, and when he came to the UK to do his shows. I have been a fan of his, but I can't seem to get enough. He was such a handsome and interesting, but most of all talented person. We could sure use a little Dean Martin in our lives everyday.\n\n(R. Morgan - ENGLAND)\n\nDear DMFC : See everyone at Steubenville!\n\n(Casey Johnson)\n\nDear DMFC : I'm anticipating the Steubenville's party again this year. I hope that Neil Daniels will bring more film clips from Dean's TV Shows like he did last year. What a treat that was. I also enjoyed Joe Scallisi, the impersonator very much. He really has Dean Martin's personality without acting or pretending. I heard that this year it has a chance of raining, so to let everyone know to bring their umbrellas. See you all there!\n\n(Karen Smith - Ohio)\n\nDear DMFC : The Legends and Heroes segment on Dean Martin was very nice. It showed footage from Dean in London, along with an interview with his mother that I never saw before! Also Mort Viner said some words as well as some nice photographs from Dean's early years. If it gets re-run like so many of these do, I recommend that other fans tape this one.\n\n(Lucille Hopkins - Florida)\n\nDear DMFC : I can't wait for the Dean Martin party in Steubenville on Friday. This will be the first year that I can go.\n\n(Linda Tiuse - Pennsylvania)\n\nDear DMFC : I only caught the tail end of the MSNBC hour on Dean Martin, but it looked very interesting. Some footage from the more recent years and his final concert over in England. I hope that they will show it again.\n\n(Candy Martel - New York)\n\nDear DMFC : I just saw the Heroes and Legends segment on Dean Martin. Some nice footage that I haven't seen before. It was good.\n\n(John M. Newhan - Arizona)\n\nDear DMFC : I heard an interview with Lee Hale on Geoff Edward's radio talk show last night on talkamerica.com, and his stories about working with Dean Martin were very fascinating. I am happy to see that you have made his book available for sale, and I am ordering one right away. Dean Martin was the staple of entertainment in my household growing up, with not only my parents and brother, but our grandparents as well.\n\n(Jerry Katai - New Hampshire)\n\nDear DMFC : It's just about a week away from Steubenville Ohio's party for Dean Martin. This will be my very first time and I am looking forward to it very much. Thank you for E - Mailing me back with information about it. I can hardly wait. Dean has been my favorite singer all my life!\n\n(Gwen Coulter - Maryland)\n\nDear DMFC : Thanks for doing a show for Dean on his birthday on Chris DeBello's morning drive in New Jersey (WNNJ-1360).\n\n(Adley Johnson - New Jersey)\n\nDear DMFC : I think I am one the biggest Fan of Dino.Since I was a young boy of 14 years,Dino`s voice had me fascinated.His person,his laugh...all of him is singular.Today he would be 83 years old. Every year I think of him.\n\n(Rüdiger Baumgart)\n\nDear DMFC : Happy Birthday Dean. We miss you.\n\n(Shirley A. Chan)\n\nDear DMFC : Chris BeBello's show was the greatest. Thanks to Lee Hale, who wrote the book on Dean's TV show, and your fan club director, Neil Daniels. Too bad we can't have a weekly Dean Martin hour. Thanks again.\n\n(Sean Gann - New Jersey)\n\nDear DMFC : Great show on WNNJ this morning. Dean's birthday was my treat. All Dean nonstop\n\n(L. McCormick - New Jersey)\n\nDear DMFC : HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAN from all of your many fans who sorely miss you. We all know that you are looking down and singing us a song.\n\n(Kenny Rida)\n\nDear DMFC : I wasn't sure if today was Dean Martin's birthday or not, but I read it in my paper under famous people born today, and they mentioned this site to visit. You seem to be doing a splendid job for such a splendid performer. Thank you for letting me browse.\n\n(Colleen Weistfield - ENGLAND)\n\nDear DMFC : I am just remembering Dean Martin today because it would have been his birthday. I wish he was still here singing his great songs and making us all smile. I guess he still does that in spirit, even though he's not here in person. Cheers Dean!\n\n(L. Docker - California)\n\nDear DMFC : Happy Birthday Dino! We miss you!\n\n(The Gang at Mitzi's - Illinois)\n\nDear DMFC : Hello from Down Under! Are you absolutely certain that Dino was born on June 7? A lot of reference books have June 17 .. they also have June 7, so who's right?I note the Steubenville celebrations are on June 16/17 is that to coincide with his birthday on the 17th? I publish an almanac journal in Australia and I'd love to get the correct date confirmed. I assume if anyone knows you guys would ... has anyone seen any official documentation?Kind regards,\n\n(Greg Newman - AUSTRALIA)\n\nHi Greg-\n\nA typo in an old biography sent out by Reprise Records gave the wrong date of June 17th, and people have been reprinting this date wrong for years. Dean's official day of birth is June 7 . (We have a copy of his official birth certificate on file here).\n\nIn the past, Steubenville's Birthday Celebration weekends have always been around his birthday, June 7th... but this year they had decided to move it ahead one week because the date was conflicting with graduations, and all the hotel rooms were being booked up, leaving none for out-of-town visitors for Dean's celebration. Nobody thought that this would add to the confusion.\n\nWeb Director - Dean Martin Fan Center\n\nDear DMFC : I grew up in a house that only played songs from the great singers that my parents loved... Sinatra, Bennett, Andy Williams, Fisher, Damone, Matt Monroe, Jack Jones and most importantly, Dean Martin. Because Dean had a TV show, we were able to see more of him that the others. It was because of that, we probably listened to more of Dean than the others. Now, every time I hear a Dean Martin tune on the radio or maybe in a shopping mall or on TV, I am taken back to the best years of my life with my parents and brothers, back in the late sixties. It was much better and fun loving time with family and friends. I am glad that Dean had done his TV show, and equally glad that he recorded so many songs to bring back my wonderful memories. I guess you could say, Memories are Made of This.\n\n(Gene Tindly - Michigan)\n\nDear DMFC : I recently purchased the 8 cd box set on Dean Martin called \"Return to Me\", and I see that the president of your organization and club for Dean was the producer of the set. The store that I bought it at (Howard's) only had this one, but it says inside the one I bought that there is another 8 cd set just like this one, which must be volume one. It looks like it is called \"Memories Are Made of This\". I have asked my store to order it for me, but I wanted to tell you that I am so glad that there is such a nice set like this in honor of such a great singer. Dean Martin has always been my favorite, and not only am I very happy with the cd's, but the book that also came with it is fantastic. The biography by Mr. Chintala is wonderful, and all the pictures are wonderful also. I can';t wait until I get the first one. Take care friends.\n\n(Lucy McFadden - New York)\n\nDear DMFC : Dean Martian ran around with my Uncle when they were young. Dean would come over to my mothers home and be hanging\n\nout in the cellar and would sing to my mother and her sisters. 6 of them and all great looking. We live in New Castle Pa. which is not far\n\nfrom Youngstown Ohio. When I married I moved to Las Vegas for 18 years, I went to his show and had front seats. Dean Martin was sitting on a stool right in front of me and I yelled up to him , may I whisper something in your ear? And he let me I must say I was shaking when I stood up. I whispered in his ear the message my Uncle made me promise to say to him if I every saw him. I told him who I was and who my Uncle was and gave him the message.He looked at me and smiled and said to give him is love and his sisters to and then he laughed. I couldn't bring myself to tell him that my Uncle had passed away 2 years ago so I just said I will. I kept my promise to my Uncle.\n\n(Eva Travers)\n\nDear DMFC : Hi I just wanted to say your website is pretty good . I like it . I've been a fan of \"Dean Martin\" or should I say \"Dino Crocetti\" for about all my life and I'm 14 right now . It was really my grandfather who introduced me to Dino. My first songs I ever heard were That's Amore and Volare . My favorite is An evening in Roma .\n\n(Mastagee)\n\nDear DMFC : I love Dean Martin. Every so often I think about who I listen to the most on the cd at home or in the car, and Dean Martin is the one.\n\n(H. Lambre - Florida)\n\nDear DMFC : I haven't heard Regis Philbin mention much about Dean Martin on his talk show lately. He use to mention Dean about once a week, and it was one of those reasons that I made sure to tune in every day just to see if he was going to say anything. I have also heard, as everyone else has, about the new Ocean's 11 movie being assembled with Brad Pitt playing Dean's role. I don't think it's much to get charged up about. I'll bet there will be just small similarities between the original that Dean, Frank and Sammy did back in the 60's. Maybe it will make a few more people aware of the original and go out and rent it. It was a fun movie back then, and it's fun to compare how Las Vegas looked then compared to now. Anyway... If Regis is reading, please talk about our Dino again. We miss it!\n\n(Linda Pramlett - New York)\n\nDear DMFC : Happy Memorial Day to Dean's fans and friends!\n\n(Charlotte Artison - Wyoming)\n\nDear DMFC : I remember in the early 70's I was a little boy - it was a great pleasure to see Dean and Jerry's film's on the TV. You have to know that at this time Germany only had 3 TV programms and the films of Martin/Lewis were always a highlight!\n\nIn the mid 70's German TV ran Dean's Show !!! I liked it very much but the TV doesn't run it the way they do in the USA. They put it together with some other shows - and they made a TV special of all this shows.\n\nIt aired every Saturday. I remember that the shows always had Dean, Jerry and Engelbert Humperdink on it. Then they cancel it. And I never see Dean's show again !!!!\n\nThe next time I saw Dean was in the movie Cannonball Run. I like it very much and the second part of it too. I like Dean's part but in the following years I never spend a lot of time in Dean's old movies or songs. I remember the tour with Frank and Sammy - that they replace Dean. And I'm sorry to say that I don't remember Deans dead. At this time he was an actor and singer - like any other to me.\n\nThe years go by...... and in the late 90's it was a TV commercial that brings me back to the songs of Dean. They play a song of Dean in that spot. The song was : \"Your nobody till somebody loves you.\" I love this song - and i know that some more people do that because they send a hint of a best of CD from Dean later in this spot. So i went and bought this CD. What happened then...... you can imagine !!!!\n\nNow I have a lot of Deans CD'S some of his Movies and old TV specials. I play his Music every day. Read all I can get about Dean.\n\nThere is only one Biography in German, so I have to read the English books. When i visit the US (every year) I buy everything i can get :-) !\n\nToday i am so sorry that it don't happen sooner. I maybe had the chance to see in person. I had the chance to write to him. Now he's gone......and I'm so sorry for that !!!! So it is so important that people like you do such a great job to let Dino life forever !!! He will be life forever in our hearts !! Today he's like a friend.....his music helps when I'm down and lets me feel even better when I'm high. He will be forever in my life.\n\nI know that their are many people in the world how feel the same. And with all the love- for Dean- in the hearts of that people- he will forever be !!!!!\n\n(Uwe Knepper - GERMANY)\n\nDear DMFC : I wanted to know if Dean Martin's birthday was June 17th or June 7th. I heard both dates mentioned often, but after looking at your web site, I see that it was the 7th. I thought so. I am also very grateful to see his home at Steubenville, Ohio has a party for him. I would like so much to go, but it's hard because I live in Arizona, and it's so far to travel. When I sent you a letter, I found that your magazine you have shows the party with pictures and stories. That will be good for us that can not make it all the way there. Thank you.\n\n(Cathy Sawyer - Arizona)\n\nCLICK \"PREVIOUS POSTS\" BELOW FOR MORE!"
