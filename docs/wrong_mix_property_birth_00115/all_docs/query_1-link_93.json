I No. 3\n\ntanding outside the residence hall waving to Mom and Dad as they slowly\n\npull away in the now-empty station wagon, many new students are filled\n\nwith mixed emotions and unanswered questions on their first day of college.\n\n\"Will I meet new friends?\" \"Will I be able to handle the work?\" and even\n\n\"What should I do now?\"\n\nThis fall at Franklin and Marshall, the answers came quickly from the dozens of faculty,\n\nadministrators and upperclass students on hand to assist in freshmen orientation - a threeday program designed to facilitate the sometimes rocky transition from home and high school\n\nto college life.\n\nS\n\nThe Freshman Experience\n\nBridging the gap between\n\nhigh school and college\n\nFreshmen - Some\n\n}irst impressions\n\nT\n\nhey arrived In all slzes. shapes and attire.\n\nLicense plates on family cars advertised their\n\npoints of origin.\n\nThe Class of 1992 - with representation from\n\n34 states and 28 foreign countries - Is one of the\n\nmost diverse freshmen groups to ever arrive on\n\ncampus. One characteristic they shared on\n\n·moving-In day· was a customary case of stomach\n\nbutterflies.\n\nOf the seven freshmen Interviewed the first\n\nday of orientation, Saturday, Aug. 27, most\n\nnervously agreed that they were \"just a little bit\n\nnervous.· The general consensus was that the\n\nanxiety stemmed from leaving old friends and\n\nmaking new ones.\n\n\"The fear that I had was when I first visited\n\n(F&M) and didn't know anyone,· said Craig Wilson\n\nof Lewes, Del. He chose F&M because ·1rs small\n\nand frlendly with a good academic reputation.·\n\nWilson's fears the first day were somewhat\n\nallayed because he had met his roommate. Eugene\n\n-Yong-Soo- Sul, a few weeks before In a ·getacquainted session· at Sul's Pottstown home.\n\n\"Craig wrote to me first,\" Sul said. \"And then I\n\nFreshmen, page 7\n\n,I\n\nFreshmen on their \"first day\" - Craig Wilson\n\n(top}, Zachariah Kenyon and Diem-Suong with\n\nher brother Michael.\n\nL\n\nE\n\nT\n\nT\n\nE\n\nR\n\nS\n\nand here's to you, Mr. Robinson\n\n2\n\nMore on the greek derecognition\n\nI felt little personal concern\n\nwhen I learned that greek life\n\nhad been tenntnated at F&M.\n\nMy own fraternity, Pl Lamda\n\nPhi, had been defranchlsed\n\nearlier In the year, and I had no\n\nclose attachment to the other\n\nfraternities.\n\nBack In the 50's, If a student did not belong to a fraternity, there was little chance for\n\na full social life and decent\n\nmeals. Life at F&M has changed\n\nconsiderably tn the past 35\n\nyears. The school Is now coed,\n\nthe food Is good. and there Is an\n\nexcellent program of activities.\n\nWhen I read the letter\n\nwritten by Rob Robinson '51, tn\n\nthe August Issue ofF&M news, I\n\nrealized how different our tndividual experiences have been.\n\nI pledged Pi Lam In 1951. It\n\nwa s an excellent choice, second\n\nonly to my decision to attend\n\nF&M. We were non-sectarian\n\nand enjoyed the good fellowship\n\nexclusive to Americans. Most of\n\nthe brothers were J ewish . for\n\nthis was the only alterna tive\n\nfrom a religiously restricted\n\nfraternity. There were Protestant\n\nbrothers, Catholic brothers,\n\nGreek Orthodox brothers, black\n\nbrothers, even an Arab brother.\n\nThe glue that held this group\n\ntogether and gave a sense of\n\ncontinuity to the fraternity\n\nthroughout the years was Otha\n\nVance, our cook, and his wife,\n\nGrace. I couldn't Imagine Pl Lam\n\nexisting as It did without these\n\ntwo wonderful people. They were\n\nblack, and they were \"family.· I\n\nnever heard a racial or religious\n\nslur at our house.\n\nI'd like to mention that Pl\n\nLam gave me a scholarship. It\n\nwas customary to help brothers\n\nof modest means. A number of\n\nfraters paid reduced dues and\n\nreceived their meals at half price\n\ntn exchange for working tn the\n\nkitchen and waittng on tables.\n\nNo brother was ever given cause\n\nfor embarassment because of\n\nhis financial situation.\n\nThe use of alcohol was\n\nprohibited by the college In\n\nthose days, but we did some\n\ndrtnklng. On special occasions\n\nthere was beer. On big weekends there was some hard\n\nliquor. Did any of our brothers\n\nhave a drinking problem? Not to\n\nmy recollection. There was no\n\npeer pressure to encourage\n\ndrinking or smoking.\n\nWe had, as a fraternity, the\n\nhighest academic average on\n\ncampus; we contributed the\n\nmost to the various drives.\n\nSome of the brothers have\n\nachieved national and\n\nInternational importance tn\n\ntheir professions and In the\n\nservice of our country.\n\nWe played together and had\n\na great time; we studied together and achieved our goals; we\n\nlived together and learned how\n\nto Interact with our fellow men.\n\nThis was Pl Lam tn the early\n\n50's, and In my tnnocence I\n\nthought it was the same for\n\neveryone.\n\nIrving P. Lewis, D.D.S. '54\n\nLakewood, NJ.\n\n••••••••••••••••••\n\nEven though I am In favor of\n\nthe board's decision (to derecognlze) fraternities, they were very\n\nworthwhile tools for guidance\n\nand leadership prior to World\n\nWa r II . After that time, there\n\nwas such a variety of age and\n\nexperience within the brother hood that the idea of \"big\n\nbrother\" no longer seemed to\n\nwork as It had before.\n\nAll through life, one follows\n\nthe drumbeat of his choice. If,\n\n30 years down the road, you\n\nfind that your choice may have\n\nbeen wrong for you - you need\n\nto shoulder that blame yourself.\n\nCasting the blame on all your\n\nfraternity brothers tn a blanket\n\nstatement seems hardly fair.\n\nMr. Robinson was a fraternity brother of mtne. I considered him my friend and feel\n\n\"put upon· for being credited\n\nwith teaching him habits which\n\nI personally had not mastered.\n\nIt Is most offensive to have\n\nyour group named and some of\n\nthe member's shortcomings\n\nlisted for the public to review\n\nwhen every organization has a\n\ntreasure chest of Its own.\n\nMany of the thtngs Mr.\n\nRobinson \"learned\" from the\n\nfraternity were choice Items.\n\nSome brothers did not choose\n\nany one of these Items he lists.\n\n(Maybe thars one of the reasons\n\nI finished low tn scholastic\n\nachievement and low In\n\npopularity).\n\nThe \"fun\" I hold tn my memory concerning fraternity life\n\nconsists of the fasctnattng discussions we had on social and\n\nworld Issues. We met over\n\ngames of bridge or In casual\n\nconversation. I also treasure the\n\ntimes we would get tnvolved\n\nwith helptng various churches\n\ntn Lancaster. Many of these\n\nbrothers are now doctors,\n\nlawyers, educators and religious\n\nleaders. These memories are not\n\ndiminished by the tirade of Mr.\n\nRobinson.\n\nHarold J. Hartman '50\n\nLancaster, Pa.\n\n••••••••••••••••••\n\nThe reader response to the\n\nF&M news' coverage of the\n\nfraternity Issue made me\n\nchuckle out loud. Of course It\n\nwas biased ... F&M news Is an\n\nofficially sanctioned (not to\n\nmention funded) F&M\n\npublication. Read the disclaimer\n\nat the bottom of page 2.\n\nAnd as far as poor Rob\n\nRobtnson who learned all of his\n\n\"good\" habits from Sigma Pl,\n\nperha ps he hasn't yet realized\n\ntha t he, and not a fraternity to\n\nwhich he belonged, is respon sible for all he did and does. I\n\nthought that had to be learned\n\nbefore one graduated college,\n\nbut then again, higher education often depends on what one\n\nIs willing to learn.\n\nI was never a brother tn any\n\nfraternity, nor did I opt to attend\n\ntheir functions after freshman\n\nyear. Nonetheless, I feel violated\n\nby the forced prohibition (a\n\nparticularly apt description) of\n\nfraternities by the admtnlstratlon. Arthur Hooper was correct:\n\nthe fraternities were doomed\n\nfrom the mtnute Powell took\n\noffice. I know. 1 was there.\n\nPerhaps we should outlaw\n\nall groups, because some people\n\nform KKK groups. All I can say\n\nIs that the action seems to be\n\ncontrary to all that I learned\n\nduring my time at the liberal\n\narts tnstltutlon. And I learned to\n\ntake responsibility for my\n\nactions.\n\nGary Zenker '84\n\nKtng of Prussia, Pa.\n\n••••••••••••••••••\n\nI am truly amazed that\n\nsomeone who can hang an F&M\n\ndiploma on their wall can hang\n\ntheir personal character weaknesses on a social tnstltutlon.\n\nI was not a member of a\n\ngreek organization, nor do I agree\n\nwith all of their precepts. But I did\n\nenjoy the various functions and\n\nactivities that a number of greek\n\norganizations sponsored. Many of\n\nmy close friends are members of\n\ngreek organizations.\n\nI'm sorry that Mr. Robinson\n\nhad such harrowing and life\n\nchangtng experiences as a result\n\nof his participation tn Sigma Pl.\n\nBut I am sure he would agree that\n\nno one tied him up and forced him\n\nto do anythtng that he did not\n\nwant to do. I am appalled that any\n\nIndividual could blame thetr weaknesses upon an organization\n\nwhere thousands of people around\n\nthe country have participated unscathed. One man's drink might\n\nbecome another's obsession, but\n\none man's obsession Is no reason\n\nto take the opportunities and\n\nrelationships that greek organizations create away from those\n\nwho might benefit from them.\n\nPunishing everyone for the\n\nsake of a few has never been a\n\nviable solution. You would not kill\n\nthe individual to stop the cancer.\n\nNor s hould you take away a n tndividual's freedom of choice. If that\n\nshould ha_ppen. then they might\n\ndemand their freedom and choose\n\nto attend a college where choice Is\n\nnot restricted nor abolished. A\n\ntrue liberal arts school.\n\nThe fraternity system has Its\n\nfaults, but so does the college. It Is\n\nthe faults that need to be addressed and not the system as a\n\nwhole. Valid attempts should have\n\nbeen made to reform the greek\n\nsystem. Even If those reforms\n\nwere applied to a freshman class\n\nto follow through to graduation, at\n\nleast the changes would then be\n\ngiven the opportunity to take root.\n\nAttitudes such as Mr. Robtnson's and the current social life on\n\ncampus are an embarrassment to\n\nthe fine reputation that Frankltn\n\nand Marshall used to evoke.\n\nCheryl H.

It (learning) Is a matter of\n\nconcepts - understanding Ideas and being able to apply them,· he\n\nsaid. ·1 was told that (about college) but I didn't believe it. But it's\n\ntrue. I'm looking forward to more of a challenge Intellectually.·\n\nAs much as these students, as freshmen, were excited by the\n\nprospect of being challenged intellectually, many of them were also\n\nfrightened that they would be unable to handle it. As it turned out,\n\nthe worst-case scenario - failure - didn't happen; some were\n\npleasantly surprised by their abilities while others found they had\n\nto adjust their thinking about academics.\n\nBodnar, one of those ·excited and scared\" at the same time,\n\nwas satisfied with herself academically. ·1 was happy with what 1\n\nwas learning, how I was doing,\" she said. ·1 was a straight-A\n\nstudent In high school. I wasn't able to do that but I was able to\n\naccept that. That was a big step.·\n\nSefton Cohen '91 of Ardmore, Pa., learned the hard way about\n\nthe self-discipline required In college. ·1 went through an irresponsible change for a while,· he said. ·1 let things slide. I let papers go\n\nfirst semester. I paid for It. I got sick.· To do well In college you\n\nhave to take care of yourself, he learned: \"You must discipline\n\nyourself physically - make sure you eat right, get your sleep.·\n\nBut once you're self-disciplined, and provided you're selfmotivated, you can do well, he found: \"They always say how\n\nKim Heiser\n\ndifferences.\n\nThe idea for such a program stemmed from upperclass minority\n\nstudents who also volunteered throughout the two days along with\n\nvarious faculty members.\n\n\"Our goal was to put the students In contact with key\n\nadministrators and faculty members who would likely be supportive of\n\nthem and who teach courses of special Interest,\" Trachte said.\n\nIn addition to various social activities where the students had a\n\nchance to get to know each other, students were Introduced to local\n\nblack community leaders and organizations Including the Urban\n\nLeague and the NAACP, to \"show them what's available In the\n\ncommunity.\n\n\"Because there are a limited number of cultural networks and\n\nadult role models on campus, the Freshmen Achievement Program\n\nwill facilitate their getting In touch with a support group,\" Trachte\n\nadded. \"It also gave them a chance to meet some upperclass\n\nminorities who've survived and succeeded, Including some campus\n\nleaders like the president of the Black Student Union.·\n\nNext year, Trachte would like to see the program expanded to\n\nInclude a greater emphasis on some of the other minority groups, but\n\nfor now, \"It's clear that we're starting to do more In helping minorities\n\nmake the transition, but we've still got far to go.\"\n\n- Stacey Haag\n\nIm possible it Is to\n\ndo well. If you\n\nwork hard, you'll\n\ndo well. If you go\n\nfor help and\n\nparticipate In\n\nclass, you can get\n\nthe A's. It's hard,\n\nbut If you work.\n\nyou can do It.\"\n\nSometimes It\n\ntakes sacrifice,\n\ntoo, as Kim Helser\n\n'9 1 of Gettysburg,\n\nPa., learned:\n\n\"Academically, it\n\nwas a challenge. I\n\nput forth 110\n\npercent, as much\n\nas I could, and It\n\nAlena Bodnar\n\npaid off. But I\n\nsacrificed. I\n\nmissed out on some social aspects of college.·\n\nAnother big fear of freshmen Is not fitting In. Many of this\n\nyear's sophomores said they dealt with that fear by adopting a\n\npositive attitude. ·1 came In with an open mind; I was\n\nprepared by being ready for anything,· Bellamy said.\n\nWhat helped In his transition to college life was the\n\npositive attitudes of everyone around him from resident and\n\norientation advisers to professors and upperclassmen. The\n\nspeeches at Convocation Inspired him. He got this message:\n\n\"You couldn't have gotten here without potential, so it's up to\n\nyou to make a lot out of it,· Bellamy said.\n\n· 1 alleviated my fears by knowing that everyone was In the\n\nsame boat,· said Brooks. \"I'm used to having a million friends\n\naround like a blanket of security. I forced myself to take a\n\npositive attitude. I called my roommate. He seemed like a nice\n\nguy. I'm rooming with him again.·\n\nIt was hard leaving friends, family and hometowns behind,\n\nbut these sophomores, as freshmen, found that with the\n\nexception of one or two people, they missed their old friends\n\nless than they thought. and their families were always\n\navailable for long-distance talks. \"Your closest friends become\n\nyour college friends. They become your friends for life,· said\n\nCohen. \"They're the kind you never made before because you\n\nweren't living together. Now you are.·\n\nHelser said, \"Leaving my family was extremely hard for\n\nme, even though I'm just an hour and a half from home .· But\n\nshe made some\n\nclose friends, talked\n\nto her parents on\n\nthe phone as much\n\nas she needed to,\n\nand they visited.\n\nBeing at a small\n\ncollege also helped.\n\n·1 knew at a small\n\nschool I'd get a great\n\ndeal of attention,\n\nbut I was so pleased\n\nby the personal\n\nhelp. I was so\n\npleased with the\n\nfreshman adviser\n\nprogram and\n\norientation,\" she\n\nsaid. \"They really\n\ncater to you. They\n\nwant you to be\n\nhappy. They want to\n\nkeep you ... •\n\n- Linda Whipple\n\nDavid Brooks\n\nmm\n\n9\n\nF&M\n\n•\n\nPEOPLE\n\nLab manager finds job to be a labor of love\n\n10\n\nby Eric Baum\n\nWhen Bonnie Dennis talks about her\n\nkids, you better ask her for a picture of the\n\nfamily.\n\nShe will proudly pull out pictures of Liza\n\nwith her first pair of glasses, Opal sucking\n\non Frieda's ear, and Bonnie's daughter\n\nAmanda playtng In a creek with\n\nLiza. By the way, don't be\n\nsurprised that Frleda,\n\nLiza, Opal and Whiskey\n\nare covered with black\n\nfur. The \"kids\" Include\n\nfour chimpanzees that\n\nBonnie worked with at\n\nthe University of\n\nPennsylvania's compound\n\nin Honey Brook, Pa.\n\nNow, as lab manager\n\nat F&M's Whitely Psychology Lab, Bonnie takes\n\ncare of all the animals,\n\nfrom the 11 rhesus\n\nmonkeys and flocks of\n\nstarlings and chickens to the 150 b aby rats\n\nshe Is weaning for Psych l0's Skinner boxes.\n\nBonnie';, career began at 15 when she\n\nstarted working weekends at Federated Medical Resources, a large research facility funded by the universities and medical schools In\n\nPhiladelphia. In her six years there, h er work\n\nincluded cat breeding. raising hairless mice\n\nfor cancer research , and a stint with farm\n\nanimals before moving on to primates. Federated sent her to Association of Laboratory\n\nAnimal Science classes , where she received a\n\ndegree a s a laboratory animal technician.\n\nShe left Federated when funding for her\n\nwork ran out, and got a job at Dr. David\n\nPremak's research facility In Honey Brook.\n\nPremak had become renowned In behavioral\n\nscience for his work with the chimp Sarah,\n\nwhom he had taught to communicate using\n\nplastic chips as words. When she was four,\n\nSarah had begun by associating specific\n\nchips to specific foods and had progressed to\n\nthe point where she could read the six-chip\n\nsequence, \"Sarah insert apple pall pear\n\ndish,\" and would put the apple In the pall\n\nand the pear In the dish.\n\nBonnie ran diagnostic tests with Sarah\n\n- showing her a video of a girl dancing who\n\nfalls down, then presenting Sarah with cards\n\nshowing what the chimp associates with\n\ngood or bad 0V on or 1V offl, asking Sarah\n\nto make a good/bad choice. Funding again\n\nbecame a problem, and Sarah, now 29, was\n\nsent to Ohio State University. \"I miss her as\n\nmuch as the kids,\" Bonnie said.\n\nKnowing that they were going to get four\n\nbaby chimps, Premak sent Bonnie to the\n\nPhiladelphia Zoo lo work with Kiki, a baby\n\ngorilla, to learn how to work with baby primates. Then the center received the four they\n\nwould work with - Whiskey and Opal for\n\nlanguage, and Frleda and Liza for math.\n\n\"Raising them was a lot like raising kids.\n\nThey would lest you and end up getting\n\nyelled at, which was when they listened.\"\n\nBonnie has good cause to compare the\n\nchimps and kids, since her daughter\n\nAmanda grew up with them. \"Amanda\n\nwould go to work with me and spend a lot of\n\ntime playing with the kids, Bonnie said. \"She\n\nstill cries when we drive past the compound;\n\nshe wonders why they had to go·\n\nJust as a tea cher h as to learn the\n\ndynamics of a class, Bonnie had to learn the\n\npersonalities and quirks of each chimp.\n\nWhiskey was the classic over-achiever, who,\n\nwhen he was frustrated by a test, would cry\n\nand throw temper tantrums because he was\n\nmad at himself. The four chimps even\n\nformed their own little two-chimp cliques\n\nwithin the group - Whiskey with Liza and\n\nOpal with Frleda. \"When you work with\n\nthem you see how much like us they really\n\nare,\" Bonnie said.\n\nWhiskey and Opal took a long time to\n\nlearn their first words, sometimes frustrating Bonnie, who had to remain as patient\n\nas if she were teaching small children. \"It\n\ntook them months to learn their first two\n\nwords, then they began to grasp the concept\n\nand learned rather quickly.· Before she had\n\nfmlshed the language testing, Whiskey and\n\nOpal had acqutred eight verbs and close to\n\n30 nouns and were able to communicate on\n\na rudimentary basis with both questions\n\nand statements.\n\nBut language alone wouldn't demonstrate how intelligent the chimps were: a cat\n\nor dog can associate sounds with desired\n\nactions and responses. The chimps had to\n\ndemonstrate the same acquisition of concepts tha t a child would as it became more\n\nexposed to stimuli. All the chimps were responding well to these new tests except Liza,\n\nwho seemed unable to concentrate, giving\n\nup easily and retreating into a corner.\n\nIt was F&M psychology professor Roger\n\nThompson who had the answer. Thompson\n\nused to travel to the University of Pennsylvania's primate lab to do research. He real-\n\n!zed that Liza was having problems with her\n\nvision and contacted psychology professor\n\nFred Owens' brother. the New Holland.\n\nPa., optometrist Robert L. Owens,\n\nwho examined Liza. He confinned that she was farsighted\n\nand prescribed a pair of\n\nglasses, which Improved\n\nher performance\n\ndramatically.\n\nThe chimps\n\nthen began to work\n\nwith causality.\n\nBonnie would lay\n\ndown three ctrcles\n\nof paper in front of\n\nthe chimps, placing an apple in the\n\nfirst ctrcle and a\n\ncut a pple in the\n\nthird. The chimp\n\nwould choose from\n\na number of choices - a pen, a\n\nknife, or a cup of wa ter. and then place the\n\nobject tha t had caused the first object to\n\nbecome the third object in the center circle.\n\nAll four chimps were taught using diagnostic tests to determine if the chimps could\n\ndi!Terentiate between same and dilTerent.\n\nThey quickly learned to dilTerentlate between\n\nboth pictures and objects that were similar\n\nor dilTerent, and Bonnie moved on lo more\n\ndemanding tests of intelligence that even\n\nadults can have problems with - math.\n\nThe four chimps began by learning\n\nabout proportions. Bonnie would set before\n\nthe chimps a bottle half full of liquid and\n\ngive them a choice between two objects - a\n\nhalf of a potato, and a potato with only a\n\nquarter sliced out. Once the chtrnps had\n\nlearned to relate one-half of an object to one\n\nhalf of a nother,\n\nInstead of just putting one object that\n\nwas of the same proportion as the bottle,\n\nshe gave the chtrnps a choice between two\n\npiles of quarter-slices of potato. The chimps\n\nwere to associate the three-quarters full\n\nbottle with the three quarter-slices of the\n\npotato, demonstrating that they had begun\n\nto acqutre rudimentary mathematical skills,\n\nand in fact, Bonnie was seeing real progress\n\nin this when. once again, funding dried up\n\nand the institute was closed.\n\nThe chimps were sent back to the Primate Research Institute in New Mexico, a\n\nbreeding center for chimpanzees used across\n\nthe country in scientific resea rch. \"When\n\nthat truck pulled away. it was the worst day\n\nof my life.· Bonnie said.\n\nBut as hard as it was to separa te from\n\nthe chtrnps, she would go out to New Mexico\n\nto work with them again if she were needed.\n\n\"I have a girlfriend who worked with me\n\nat Honey Brook and she said, 'Never again.'\n\nShe wouldn't put herself through the pain.\n\nBut I can't help it. I like it, I'm good at it,\n\nand they deserve to be cared for by s omeone\n\nwho cares about them.·\n\nCOUNCIL•\n\nNEWS\n\nFor more information concerning each council, call the alumni contact for that area.
