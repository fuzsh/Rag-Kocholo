        "text": "Chapter 1: an ugly place\n\nBrady Huggett: Chapter 1: an ugly place\n\nStan Crooke told me something once that I've never forgotten. This was back in 2015, when I was interviewing him in a Hilton hotel, in San Francisco near Union Square. Stan was 69 years old then, gray hair, maybe a little less than 6 feet tall. His voice, then and now, has a pinched tone to it at times, which he attributes to allergies and “an Indiana nasal twang.” He has a damaged ring finger on his right hand, the middle joint dislocated so many times playing basketball in his youth that the top half juts at an angle. He is forthright, sometimes sharp in tone, but he also laughs easily, and he can be very funny. He was in San Francisco to attend a biotech conference, as CEO of a company he founded in 1989.\n\nStan grew up destitute, in downtown Indianapolis in the ’40s and ’50s. An “ugly place,” as he called it, and as we talked I asked him how he managed to overcome that neighborhood and his hard upbringing and get himself to college, and then beyond.\n\nStan Crooke: So, mostly desperation, and anger. And just the whole idea of having no hope, no aspirations. I mean, poverty is not the loss of money — though of course that’s sad. It’s the loss of dreams, it’s the absence of hope. That’s poverty.\n\nBrady Huggett: The absence of a real future.\n\nStan Crooke: Beyond that. At least from my perspective, it’s the inability to even dream, you know?\n\nBrady Huggett: His comment stuck with me because I immediately knew it was a truth. Poverty is ruinous not because it prevents buying new clothes, or having enough to eat. Those things are damaging in their own way, but poverty is ruinous because it stifles the ability to dream, as he said. It limits one’s vision of the future, and keeps it small.\n\nAnd so it is remarkable to me that Stan Crooke, who came from a background unique among scientific researchers, certainly unique in the biotechnology industry, was able to not only dream of a better life for himself, but to actually achieve it. And it is even more remarkable that in doing so, he became a champion for a brand new drug modality, keeping the technology afloat through decades of laboratory and marketplace failures. Until, finally, his company won approval for a drug that would provide hope and dreams for thousands of terminally ill kids.\n\nThis is the story of Stan Crooke’s life. It’s the story of the biotech company he founded, and it’s the story of a powerful drug discovery technology called antisense. Together, they cracked the degenerative disease known as spinal muscular atrophy, which had been stealing the lives of children, and traumatizing families since it was first discovered more than a century ago.\n\nFrom Nature Biotechnology, I’m Brady Huggett, and this is Hope Lies in Dreams.\n\n[theme music]\n\nBrady Huggett: Stan Crooke was born in Indianapolis in 1945. He’d always been told his birthday was March 28, but when he went in search of a birth certificate as an adult, the one he found in the Marion County records had been filed years after he was born, and it listed March 26. So he’s not entirely sure of the day, or possibly even the year, but either way, he thinks his life began near the end of March in 1945.\n\nHis family history is similarly cloudy, but he heard that his mother’s lineage — the Carley name — runs mostly through Indianapolis, except for a period of time when the family moved to Kansas only to be turned back by the Dust Bowl. What he does know is that his mother grew up during the Great Depression in a struggling family. And he knows that she gave birth to him when she was around 15 years old, though to this day he does not know who his father is or where, exactly, he was born.\n\nAfter his birth, his mother promptly left him with his grandmother and great grandmother, and he spent the first year of his life with them, squatting in a tar paper shack on the edge of the grounds of the Republic Creosoting Company in Indianapolis, alongside a railway line on the Southwest side of the city. Then they moved about 4 miles east, to 363 Terrace Avenue, into a tiny shotgun house, just over 500 square feet. Their blue collar neighborhood was less than two miles south of the heart of downtown, where tourists would come to take pictures of Indy’s iconic Soldiers and Sailors monument, but it must have felt much farther. The homes were valued at as little as $1,000 and could be rented for $20 or $30 a month. The men here were truck drivers, machinists, dock hands, bartenders, and the women mostly did not work outside the home. I asked Nelson Price, an Indianapolis historian, about the area at that time.\n\nNelson Price: That would have been the South Side. And it would have been a very hardscrabble area. A lot of Appalachian white families, not ethnically diverse, there would have been very few African Americans living there. There would have been no ethnic presence — the city at that point as a whole didn’t have an immigrant population. We weren’t a sea port, we were primarily a German heritage city. Those immigrants had come many generations before, so the city was pretty much either white or Black. And that would have been a very tough neighborhood to grow up in. Hardscrabble, working-class neighborhood. With the expectation that those kids are probably not going to grow up and go to college.\n\nBrady Huggett: Their new place had a living room that was maybe 8 feet by 12 feet. The house had a toilet but no tub, and the family washed up in the sink. Two of Stan’s cousins, a boy and a girl, lived with him there, and together the kids slept on the floor. It was a difficult, tenuous existence, not a book to be found in the little house, and not much happiness either, his grandmother and great grandmother seemingly always tired, emotionless.\n\nStan Crooke: It just, I mean you just didn’t say nice things. Uh, there were no nice things to say, really. I mean we were scrabbling around, trying to have enough money to eat, and they’d been doing that for a lifetime.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah.\n\nStan Crooke: And they were just beaten down. And, so — but they weren’t bad people. They were not mean. And they both liked one thing, and that was baseball.\n\nBrady Huggett: Both your grandmother and great grandmother?\n\nStan Crooke: Oh, they loved it. We didn’t have a TV, but they had a radio, and they’d listen to the Indianapolis Indians baseball team — it was the Triple A baseball team. And so, you know, very quickly I learned to love baseball. And that was the one joy they had. At night they’d sit — the living room was big enough for two rockers and this one little couch, and then the heater. And they’d sit in their rockers and listen to the radio broadcast of the Indianapolis Indians. As did I.\n\nBrady Huggett: When Stan was around 5, his mother came to claim him. She’d married a man, changing her last name from Carley to Crooke, and Stan began spending time with them, first in one place and then another, the second home a duplex of sorts located near the women’s prison, in the near East Side of Indianapolis. This neighborhood was maybe a little bit better, and there was a higher percentage of African Americans than his old neighborhood, but regardless, the differences were slight — it was still working class, still a tough place, the Blacks and the whites living separately. Stan moved in with his mother and began adjusting to his new life.\n\nStan Crooke: As I told you, my stepfather was a really good guy. I mean, a really nice man. You know, just a hard-working mechanic, who was great at his craft and who worked two jobs to try and make things go. And my mom had lots of needs, of course, and stuff.\n\nBrady Huggett: The “lots of needs” Stan is referring to is partially about prescription drugs. His mother was an addict, using amphetamines and barbiturates, he said, and later she also had rheumatoid arthritis, and took a lot of cortisone. That meant she was a kind of “test case” he said, for all the toxicities related to steroids. On top of all that, she wasn’t happy with her life either, and she showed it.\n\nStan Crooke: And she was a hater. She hated people who had Cadillacs because they were rich. She hated people who had Lincolns because they were pretending to be rich. She hated people in the neighborhood because they were poor. Uh, she hated people from Kentucky and Tennessee because they were coming up and taking our jobs from ‘good Hoosiers.’ Hate came quite naturally. She was one of the great haters of our time.\n\nBrady Huggett: That included across racial lines. Though being racist didn’t make her unique for the neighborhood, the state or the times.\n\nStan Crooke: Oh yeah, everybody was. I mean, it was just a, it was just a fact of life. I think I mentioned Crispus Attucks, the school.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah.\n\nStan Crooke: I don’t have many memories, but I have a stark memory of one of the rare gatherings or more than — maybe three or four people, I can’t remember — sitting around watching the basketball. And everybody hating Crispus Attucks because they were Black.\n\nBrady Huggett: Crispus Attucks, the all-Black high school named after the Black patriot killed in the Boston Massacre of 1770. In 1955, led by the great Oscar Robertson, Crispus Attucks won the state championship — the first time an all-Black school had done this in Indiana, or any other state in the nation. Stan was 10 years old at the time, and while he wouldn’t go so far as to say he had a “moral epiphany” while watching the game, he admits he was enthralled by the team, and the shocking talent of Oscar Robertson, and he remembers thinking he didn’t see “any reason to hate them.”\n\nThe Crispus Attucks victory won over a lot of people in Indianapolis — but drew out the hate in many, many others. And this was true in Stan’s neighborhood, which had plenty of hostility.\n\nStan Crooke: You know, where I grew up, the next poorest always hate the poorest, and we had a lot of Tennesseans and Kentuckians, and then ‘Hoosiers,’ and the whole environment was hate filled. I mean, it just was.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah, there’s that sort of scrabble at the bottom.\n\nStan Crooke: Uh-hm. Everybody fighting for scraps. And hating each other for having a scrap.\n\nBrady Huggett: And Stan’s mother, in particular, seemed filled with an anger that constantly leaked out.\n\nStan Crooke: The earliest memory I have, at home, with her, was the first bath she gave me. She had these long red fingernails, and she was cleaning my hair, ostensibly. And my scalp started bleeding and I watched blood in the water. I mean, that’s a bad memory.\n\nBrady Huggett: Stan would spend weekends with his cousins and his grandmother and great grandmother in that shotgun house until he was 9 or so, but the rest of the time he was with his mother. He never went to kindergarten, but he taught himself to read, from the scraps of comic books he’d pick up on the streets, so he was fairly prepared when his mother got him into grade school early. She needed a babysitter for him, because she had started a family with Stan’s stepfather, giving birth to his half sister and brother.\n\nHe got a morning paper route when he was somewhere between 8 and 10 — he can’t quite remember the year now. Waking up, and leaving the house in the dark, collecting his papers, distributing them to homes around the neighborhood. When he was finished, the sky still black, he’d buy a doughnut at a nearby bakery just as it opened — a kind of reward for himself. Then returning to his own house, and his bed, sometimes able to fall back asleep before school, sometimes not.\n\nThe paper route was seven days a week, and the money went to his mother, to help pay for her rheumatoid arthritis medication. “I just was tired all the time,” he told me, but this pattern helped form in Stan a work ethic he’d carry the rest of his life.\n\nSomewhere, amidst all this, he was moved up a grade because he was overachieving. Then in the 4th grade he was put in with the advanced kids, classmates he called “brainiacs” at the time. But he was such a “punk” he says, he was thrown out of it — a great chance ruined. Stan knew he was smart, but was too angry and too arrogant, too mouthy and too sure that these people couldn’t teach him anything, to get much out of school. He was constantly self sabotaging in this way. Just in general, he seemed to be careening through a childhood devoid of affection and without support.\n\nBut that’s the thing about Stan, and it’s one of his defining characteristics. He will not be a victim. He’s willing to hint at the stories of his past, especially now that he’s older, and admit he has some bad memories of that time. But he will not be pitied, and he’s always aware, always conscious that there are many others who have been through more than he has.\n\nStan Crooke: You know, there was a lot of, there was abuse that was not constant, not, not — my mother was easily annoyed and volatile. She was just physical. Whatever she had near you, she’d hit you with. Well, that tends to make you a little anxious. You know, because you don’t know when you’re gonna, when it’s going to go. But it’s not like somebody deliberately set out to destroy me, like other abusers. And there was nobody in my family — my family wasn’t — there are many families poorer. There were no hardened drug users, with, you know, the one exception.\n\nBrady Huggett: Your mother.\n\nStan Crooke: Yeah. And there were no, um, criminals. No repeat offenders. And I was surrounded by people who had it much worse. But, there was no joy. There was no aspiration. For reasons that make no sense, all those little moments that you celebrate, I didn’t experience. You know, really, I don’t remember a single time I was told, We love you. I don’t remember anyone putting their arm around me. I don’t remember getting a gift, Christmas or birthday or anything like that.\n\nBrady: But I don’t think everyone is as forgiving as Stan is. I spoke with Evan Crooke, Stan’s son, about his father’s upbringing, and that side of Evan’s family. Evan has a smile a lot like his dad’s, and sounds a little like him, too. He works in the independent film industry, running a distribution company. This is what he had to say about Stan’s family.\n\nEvan Crooke: His mom particularly was, from what I know, really, really bad. I mean really bad. And, I remember watching, uh, the movie Mommy Dearest, which is based on a true story, you know, about an actress who basically got abused by her mom, and who was abusive and so on. My dad’s a very strong guy, emotionally, so I don’t remember too many times where he actually, um, visibly broke down and was upset. And watching the movie, I remember him having to get up and walk out. I mean, he was upset, clearly. Later I learned that his mom did some pretty terrible things. Awful people, really not good.\n\nBrady Huggett: The grandmother and great grandmother too?\n\nEvan Crooke: No, from what I know the grandmother was decent, and if she wasn’t it would have been a lot worse. But he started a newspaper route that he was trying to earn a buck, if you will, at 8 years old, and all that money went to the family. So I think that’s where that came in, that he had a responsibility to take care of his brothers and family and his mom, financially at 8 years old. It’s insanity.\n\nBrady Huggett: He said his stepfather was a pretty decent fellow, in the end.\n\nEvan Crooke: Yeah, I never met — you know what? I never met any of them. Uh, I wanted to, before I learned more in depth about them. And I remember him telling me that, uh, I don’t think you would like them. [laughs]\n\nBrady Huggett: To clarify Evan’s comments, Stan had only one half brother, and his half sister. Anyway, some of this environment was caused by poverty. The stress and anxiety of it, the precarious nature of not having enough money. One summer, Stan spent the entire school break indoors, babysitting his half-siblings. The blinds pulled low, out of worry that social services might realize two young children were being left in the care of another child. These are the things that have to happen when there’s no money for child care, as Stan well knows. But it didn’t make it any easier at the time, for a boy who longed to be outside, playing ball.\n\nThe bottom line is that Stan did not have a great mother, and if she loved him at all, she was not good about showing it. And it’s safe to say he struggled to love her in return.\n\n[music]\n\n[ad]\n\nBrady Huggett: When Stan was 11 or maybe 12, he got a job in a corner drugstore — another formative moment for him. It was called The Tech Corner, located across from Arsenal Tech, a trade high school on the near eastside of Indianapolis. Stan enjoyed the work. He liked the routine of it, he liked the praise he received for doing a task well, and he liked the money, too — though, like with his paper route, that money went to help the family.\n\nHe started high school around age 12, at Arsenal Tech — young, but his mother had put him in grade school early, and he’d also skipped a grade. Tech is a big, looming place with thousands of kids, and I asked Nelson Price, the historian, about what it might be like for a 12 year old to be on that campus.\n\nNelson Price: Tech would be an intimidating place for someone at 12. And even beyond that, it wasn’t the largest high school in the country, but it was still an extremely large high school, at that point, with separate buildings, and in his case, older kids who probably had their own turf. I think you would have encountered a lot of challenges with acceptance there.\n\nBrady Huggett: Stan remembers it a lot like Nelson describes it. The school was maybe 75% white kids, and 25% Black when he was there, with the Black population rising, Nelson Price told me. Either way, almost all the kids were from working-class families, and it was a tough, mean place.\n\nStan Crooke: And then, I went to Tech, which was a big, very violent place. It looked just like the women’s prison. And it was violent, and I was little. And aggressive.\n\nBrady Huggett: So you’re young, younger than everyone else.\n\nStan Crooke: Young, little.\n\nBrady Huggett: Young, little and aggressive.\n\nStan Crooke: And too stupid to keep my mouth shut, so naturally I got beat up a lot. I’ll give you an example of the things that went on. I know this stuff sounds unbelievable, but one of the games that was played on the campus was, You’d put a quarter in front of you and stand there. And that became an invitation for someone to come up and take the quarter, and then there’d be a fight.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah.\n\nStan Crooke: And one day, this giant, big guy laid a dollar on the ground, which was a lot. I didn’t — I was just coming from class and I noticed the dollar on the ground. I thought, Holy Cow, it’s a dollar! I picked it up, took it, walked away. And I was just heading into the next building, getting ready to go up the stairs, and this giant hand clamped around my neck, lifted me up on the wall. [laughs] I won’t say the words he called me. And he said, You took my dollar. And I said, Oooh, oh, I didn’t know it was your dollar. I gave it back to him. If I hadn’t given it back to him I think I’d of been a dead guy about then.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah.\n\nStan Crooke: I mean, that stuff, that’s what went on. It was the sort of stuff that happens, at least in those days, in inner-city schools.\n\nBrady Huggett: He’s spending time in that school, and also working at The Tech Corner, which was filled with the same kind of crowd, students coming in between classes and after school let out.\n\nStan Crooke: I mean, The Tech Corner, there was a gang that could, you know, the folklore was that they could take the motor out of a car in 30 minutes in the dark. They made their living doing that. And there were lots of — it’s not like it is today. Drugs were not a big business. There were no guns. So it was so much easier. You know, if the business of drugs were available for me in those days, I’d have probably done it because it was entrepreneurial and it was a way to make money. And for sure, if I’d had access to a gun there was somebody I would have killed, because you get tired of getting beaten up.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yep.\n\nStan Crooke: But it’s nothing like as bad as life today is, in those environments. And so, sure, you can get beaten up, but you can survive getting beaten up. You can’t survive getting shot. And of course it was violent in the sort of capricious way violence is. You know, it just comes out of the blue.\n\nBrady Huggett: And by now, all that violence he just mentioned, and the constant threat of it, and the crime and the people he was hanging around with, had influenced him, too.\n\nStan Crooke: And, I got arrested, because my buddies and I were stealing stuff out of cars because we were too small to steal them.\n\nBrady Huggett: So you would just break the window and take whatever was in there.\n\nStan Crooke: Yeah, yeah.\n\nBrady Huggett: How old were you then?\n\nStan Crooke: 12?\n\nBrady Huggett: So they put you in, like a —\n\nStan Crooke: Juvie.\n\nBrady Huggett: Juvie, yeah.\n\nStan Crooke: Just one night. But that was enough. First of all, I had to sit in the house of the people who caught me. For about an hour, waiting on the cops. It was so humiliating, I felt so terrible.\n\nBrady Huggett: I bet.\n\nStan Crooke: These were just poor people, and I was stealing from them? I felt awful. So that humiliation was really good for me. And then I was scared. [laughs] I was in this cell with guys who were hardened.\n\nBrady Huggett: [laughs] Like 35 years old.\n\nStan Crooke: They were 17, but my god they were big, and they were mean. And a big-time terror fixed me of my hoodlum ways. I said no thanks.\n\nBrady Huggett: All right, so that was kind of the end of that?\n\nStan Crooke: The humiliation really mattered.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah.\n\n[music]\n\nBrady Huggett: Eventually he left The Tech Corner, and took a job at Rodenbeck Pharmacy, on East Michigan Street, about 7 blocks from the high school. He liked this place better. Working-class folks came in after the job, bought their booze, drank it on the sidewalk or street, talking to each other in the growing dusk, and then going home. It was less chaotic, more community, but still, the arrest and night in juvenile detention had solidified what Stan already knew about himself — that he wanted to get out of that neighborhood, that he wanted a different life than the one he’d been shown. That meant going to college. If he didn’t, he’d end up like everyone else he knew, meeting the same violent end that they were meeting. Like what happened to Rex Curtis.\n\nStan Crooke: You know, Rex Curtis, who got a full scholarship to Columbia when he was 17, he had acquired a new stepfather. And um, um. And he wanted the car, and his stepfather said no. And they lived next to A&P grocery store, so they parked their car over there in the far end of the lot on 10th Street in Indianapolis. I think it was 10th Street. And, um, so Rex was going to go take the car and his stepfather knew he was, and he was drunk and he waited for him in the backseat. And when Rex opened the door, he blew his head — blew his brains out with a shotgun.\n\nBrady Huggett: He shot his — it was his stepson?\n\nStan Crooke: Yeah. And I happened to be going by there, it was about 10 at night, and actually saw Rex dead on the porch of this house, where he’d run to to try to find help. All kinds of things like that happened.\n\nBrady Huggett: So he got shot, stumbled off and died?\n\nStan Crooke: Yeah. Uh-huh. And I had another friend, a car fell on him when they were working on it. And another who got shot. I mean, that’s what happens if you, if you’re just unlucky or if you continue in those kinds of activities.\n\nBrady Huggett: All of this — the people he hung around, the people who had more than he did, the rich people who had it easier, the people who were bigger and meaner than he was that pushed him around, the mother who hit him, who didn’t show him any affection — he took all this in, and it began to form something hard inside of him.\n\nStan Crooke: But mostly what got me was the feeling of powerlessness. And how unfair the whole damn thing seemed to me. And it made me furious.\n\nBrady Huggett: And that fury becomes its own kind of fuel for Stan. Anger can be a powerful motivator if it’s pointed in the right direction, and Stan was starting to figure out which direction he needed to point his. That anger would help him, would give him drive. And then, almost to his surprise, given his terrible relationship with his mother, he got another kind of help — from a female.\n\nStan Crooke: I don’t. I mean, I honestly don’t know what would have happened to me if I hadn’t met Nancy.\n\nBrady Huggett: Kids came into Rodenbeck’s pharmacy on their way home from school, to get a soda or some candy. And in that group was a blonde, green eyed, pretty teenager named Nancy Alder, who lived in the neighborhood. Her own home life was bad — her father was a mean drunk, who hit her mother. Nancy was a couple of years younger than Stan, but eventually he realized she was coming into the pharmacy to talk to him, and they began to form a bond. She was nice to him, supported him, showed him what love was. These two had an almost singular focus, which was to pull themselves out of the chaos of their families and get out of the lives they were leading. They were both smart, and driven, and believed in each other. And eventually, with Nancy helping him with the application, Stan took aim at college.\n\nStan Crooke: I filled out one application for college, which was for Purdue. And I went into aeronautical engineering because it was a four-year course, and I liked airplanes, I thought, and because I thought smart people were engineers. I’d never met an engineer, I didn’t know what an engineer was.\n\nBrady Huggett: But when you say that statement — that you thought that was what smart people did — it tells me that you wanted to be a smart person. In fact, that you knew that you were, you just wanted access to that life.\n\nStan Crooke: Yeah. Uh, it was very obvious to me that I was smart. I mean, I got told it, you know, when I got put in the special classes. But, I mean, older people would come into the drugstore all the time and ask me questions about history and literature and stuff. I just knew stuff.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah.\n\nStan Crooke: And taking tests. I never met a test I couldn’t ace.\n\nBrady Huggett: \"I never met a test I couldn’t ace.\" It must have been true for the SAT, because his grades weren’t going to get him into college, and somehow he got accepted into Purdue, into the aeronautical engineering program. Stan graduated from Tech in 1960 at age 16 — the first person in his family to earn a high school degree.\n\nWe are products of our environment, for sure. Though also, in some ways, our core is formed at birth. Stan likes to refer to himself as a “recombinational event” — the mix of his genes and his upbringing. He told me this little anecdote once, almost as an aside, and it was such a great image I felt I could immediately see what he’d been like as a boy, see his true essence.\n\nStan Crooke: Um, I was born happy. You know, when I was young, I’d have these what I’d call ‘light days.’ When I’d just wake up feeling so good. It took me some time to learn that I drove people crazy. Just, I was so happy.\n\nBrady Huggett: Light days. That was Stan Crooke as a boy, waking up to another day, feeling like he was filled with light, an exuberance spilling out of him, annoying his mother, his grandmother. But the world does change us, Stan’s right. And he changed as he grew. He became this mix, this recombinational event. He built an angry shell around himself, but underneath he was still that hopeful kid waking up to a “light day.” Stan has a compassionate, empathetic soul — it’s the reason he couldn’t make it as a thief. It’s true he was also scared by his night in juvenile detention, but looking at the family he had just stolen from humanized them, he could see the real-life repercussions of his actions, could see that they were as poor as he was, and he didn’t have the stomach for that.\n\nWhat he wanted was to leave town and never look back. He wanted an amnesia for all that happened to him in his life. He wanted to take Nancy’s hand, climb up to where the smart people were, and never think about his past again. Here’s Rick Hellman, who has been friends with Stan for nearly 50 years. Rick grew up in Chicago, and met Stan in medical school.\n\nRick Hellman: He didn’t, um, exhibit what I’d call angry-world phenomenon. But he’d talk about those things sometimes. But he didn’t like to talk about them. It’s sort of like, I guess it’s analogous to Holocaust survivors. When I grew up, I grew up in a neighborhood, people spoke German and Yiddish, and when you went to the foodstore, you saw a lot of people who had numbers, tattoos on the arms. Nobody talked about the Holocaust in the ’50s. Period. Or, I have an uncle, who it turned out was a war hero. And he was involved in World War II, and won the Silver Star and what have you. He never talked about the war, until the end of his life. Because it was so horrible. Um, I think that happens to some people. They did it. But now they are in another place.\n\nBrady Huggett: Another place. That was exactly what Stan wanted. And now he had a chance, because he’d been accepted to Purdue. He was going to make something of himself after all. He was about to begin what would be a twisting road through higher education.\n\n[theme music]\n\nThank you, now and always, to Stan Crooke. Thank you to Nelson Price, Indianapolis historian and author, for sharing his great knowledge of his city. Thanks to Rick Hellman, for his time and his insight. And thanks to Evan Crooke, for talking about his father.\n\nSound mix and original theme by Brian Flood. All art by Erin Dewalt. Hope Lies in Dreams was written and produced by me, Brady Huggett. Go to the homepage of Nature Biotechnology to find the landing page for this podcast, which includes a list of sources, historical photos and a transcript of this chapter. Chapter two will be out in a week. Until then.\n\nChapter 2: a winding path\n\nBrady Huggett: Chapter 2: a winding path\n\nIn 1960, Stan Crooke was accepted into Purdue University, for the aeronautical engineering program. Smart people, he thought, became engineers and they built airplanes and rockets. He was going to prove that he was as smart as those people. Or smarter, actually.\n\nThe first year of the program could be done at Purdue University extension, a satellite campus, of sorts, located north of downtown Indianapolis. Which meant that Stan would stay at home, be near his girlfriend Nancy, and still be able to work at Rodenbeck’s pharmacy, where he’d been trying to save money. When the semester started, he still couldn’t fully cover the tuition, but Frank Rodenbeck loaned him $300, and gave him a pair of used dress shoes to wear, and Stan’s higher education started. He bused to class every day, and when classes were over he took a mix of buses back to the Near East Side, and he’d work from 5 to 10 at Rodenbeck’s.\n\nStan treated college like he’d treated all the rest of his schooling — he put little effort into classwork, and just used his brain to pass the tests. There wasn’t much time for studying around his work schedule, and anyway, he hadn’t been able to afford all the textbooks.\n\nThis worked for a year. And then it became clear to Stan, and probably to the school, as well, that he was going to fail. From Nature Biotechnology, I’m Brady Huggett, and this is Hope Lies in Dreams.\n\n[theme music]\n\nBrady Huggett: In Stan’s second year at Purdue, he needed to be living on campus in West Lafayette, about 60 miles northwest of Indianapolis. This was in order to access the hangar where the aeronautical engineering students had their hands-on learning. It was the first time he had meaningfully traveled beyond the borders of Indianapolis in his life. In typical Stan fashion, he did not attend the campus orientation for his second year, because he was still working to secure the tuition money. So when he arrived among those red brick buildings he was sort of lost, and just in general feeling insecure. Plus, the classes were more difficult the second year — math, physics, aeronautics — or difficult if you’re not studying, as Stan mostly wasn’t, spending his free time working almost 40 hours a week at a pharmacy near the campus.\n\nAdding to all this, Nancy got sick. She’d had debilitating migraines since she was 14, sometimes bad enough to make her vomit. This was different, though, serious enough to put her in the hospital. There was no official diagnosis, and Nancy’s parents never told Stan much anyway, about anything, but regardless, he began hitchhiking back to Indianapolis once a week to see her.\n\nThis was on top of the hours at the pharmacy, and all the classes, and that advanced math, and the physics calculations. He was soon earning the worst grades of his life, “which is saying something,” he told me. His weight had fallen, and the worry over Nancy’s health had brought on a depression. It all suddenly seemed impossible. He took a long look around, saw the writing on the wall, and gave up on Purdue in his second year. Stan headed home to Indianapolis.\n\nMaybe it was better to stick with what he already knew. He transferred into Butler University’s school of pharmacy, the only trade school in Indianapolis. It was a 5-year program, the math much simpler — “I can add” Stan said — and that meant he could get by the same way he always had. Spend his free time working, not study much, and then pass the tests. That’s what he did.\n\nStan and Nancy got married in 1964, when she turned 17. Stan was just 19 himself. They moved in together and lived in East Indianapolis, but not long after their union, a cyst ruptured on Nancy’s ovary and she had emergency surgery to excise it. She wasn’t watched closely in the hospital after the surgery, she bled internally, and nearly died. Another moment of terror for Stan, and Nancy too, and another incident in Nancy’s long battle with her body.\n\nAmidst this trauma, Frank Rodenbeck sold the pharmacy to Jim Smith, who in turn sold it to someone else and then Jim opened a new place in a better neighborhood. In Stan’s third year of pharmacy school, Jim asked Stan to come work there. And to entice him, he made Stan a “tiny owner” of the new place.\n\nFor the last two years of pharmacy school, Stan basically ran Jim Smith’s business, he told me, helping triple the revenue with a higher profit margin. Now Stan was making good money, too. He and Nancy had a new car, and were thinking about buying a house. Stan figured this would be his life. Why not? It was already a big step up from where he had come.\n\nBut somewhere deep inside, Stan kept a small flame alive for a bigger dream. He must have, because he took the LSAT, the test required for law school admission. It was another half measure on his part — he had the scores sent to the law school at Indiana University, at Indianapolis, “not the good one in Bloomington,” he said, but he never actually applied anywhere.\n\nStan Crooke: And, one day I was home, and the secretary called and said, The Dean of the law school wants to speak to me. Well OK. And he said, You know, we have your test scores, but, strangely, we don’t have your application. And I said, Oh golly, I forgot to do that. And he said, Well here, let my secretary fill out that application for you. And, the secretary filled out my application. And that’s how I got into law school.\n\nBrady Huggett: Things like this seemed to happen to Stan all the time. This is why he says — to this day — that he’s the luckiest person anyone will ever meet. It happened again while he was still in pharmacy school. Stan had developed a tradition where he skipped the first week of every semester. Initially this was to keep earning tuition money, but by his fifth year it had become habit. In his absence that first week of his final year, he was elected a class officer. It was meant as a “middle finger to the school,” he said, because Stan often made dismissive comments during lectures or was sarcastic with professors. His classmates thought it a worthy joke to elect him as voice of the student body.\n\nBeing a class officer opened another door for him, again by chance.\n\nStan Crooke: Which meant for the first time in my life I had to be in the office of a dean. I didn’t know what a dean was. And the dean, to whom I’d been grossly unpleasant — I’m in the office, doing some dumb thing, and he says, What are you doing after you graduate? And I said, Oh, I don’t know, run a drug store. And he said, Have you ever considered graduate school? I said, No. What’s graduate school? And he says, Well, you know, we have a master’s program. Why don’t you go to graduate school here? I said, Well, OK. And so they filled out the application for me, or Nancy helped me, and I got into graduate school. And that’s how I ended up running a drug store, being in law school and going to graduate school all at the same time.\n\nBrady Huggett: Law school didn’t last. Being in the law buildings felt like “an old man’s hotel,” Stan said, and he dropped out after a week. So being an engineer was out, and now so was being a lawyer, but he did the graduate work at Butler and earned a master’s degree in pharmacy, and then fell back to his plan of running some drug stores.\n\nYet still that flame flickered in his chest. Could there be more? He thought maybe. And it stemmed from his time at Purdue, when he’d known a chemical engineering student named Gary Keener; a big, tough kid, whose dad worked in the steel mills. Gary was another son of the Midwest like Stan.\n\nStan Crooke: And we became good friends. And, I played a lot of chess in those days. Played tournament chess.\n\nBrady Huggett: Oh, you did?\n\nStan Crooke: Oh yeah. And I beat poor old Gary 500 straight games.\n\nBrady Huggett: [laughs]\n\nStan Crooke: He was a very competitive guy. But Gary was, an intellectual. It was the first time I’d run into anybody who thought as a way of living. I always thought, I always read, I liked history. I liked literature. That’s what I really liked. But then Gary dropped out and went to medical school.\n\nBrady Huggett: Stan had rarely gone to a doctor as a child. Or a dentist, as far as he could remember. He didn’t know much about medicine, beyond what pharmacy school had taught him, or what he had learned through Nancy’s hospital visits. Real medicine was a foreign world. But he stayed in touch with Gary after both had left Purdue, and watching Gary, and his wife, go through medical school made it a tangible thing, something Stan might actually achieve himself.\n\nAnd medical school also spoke directly to Stan’s desire to keep climbing.\n\nStan Crooke: I wanted the letters after my name. And I wanted that kind of control. That kind of prestige. And I was interested in cancer.\n\nBrady Huggett: When Stan had taken a class on cancer in pharmacy school — from yet another professor to whom he would not give his respect — he had what he felt was an original thought. Maybe what happens, he mused, is that when cells lyse, as they do in their normal life cycle, the DNA in the nucleus breaks down, and fragments enter the bloodstream, where they are taken up by other cells. This, he thought, must be the cause of cancer. In fact he was sure of it.\n\nHe was completely wrong, of course, but the exhilaration he’d felt at his “discovery” stuck with him, and in that moment he began to view science not as something you memorize and apply in certain situations, but as an exploration. And it stirred something in him.\n\nWith Nancy’s help filling out applications, he applied to a handful of mostly mediocre schools, including as far abroad as the University of Jamaica. He didn’t have much hope, since his grades in pharmacy school had “sucked,” he said, maybe a 2.5.\n\nTo little surprise, he got rejected by all of them, except Emory and Baylor University. The “two good schools” Stan marveled. And the acceptance letter for Baylor came from the chairman of the pharmacology department himself, Harris Busch, who suggested Stan come get both a PhD and an MD, and he invited Stan down to see the campus. On Baylor’s dime. Stan, who had grown up listening to all that baseball with his grandmother and great grandmother, and who loved the sport himself, thought it sounded like a good chance to see the Houston Astrodome, which was new at the time, so he accepted the offer, and he and Nancy flew down.\n\nThe medical school at Baylor was run by a super tandem of Harris Busch and Michael DeBakey. Busch as chairman of the pharmacology department, and DeBakey as chairman of the surgical department, and he was also president of the college after 1969. The trip changed Stan and Nancy’s lives. Or more precisely, meeting Harris Busch at his lab altered the trajectory of Stan’s life.\n\nStan Crooke: Nancy and I went in. I left her down in the lobby, said I’ll be back in an hour. Harris gave me a lab book, a white coat — I didn’t know anything about science — and said, Here’s your project. You’re going to sequence U1A RNA. Oh, OK. What’s an RNA? I mean, I didn’t know what RNA was. [laughs] Because I was trained in, you know, sort of, the most primitive pharmacology. It was pharmacy school pharmacology, of those days. And, along around 7 or 8 at night, I realized it was 7 or 8 at night. In those days I really didn’t eat anything, because I was just used to not eating. And I thought, Oh shit, and ran down. Nancy was still sitting there waiting for me. And that’s the first time I encountered scholarship. Uh, medicine.\n\nBrady Huggett: He was hooked on true science, and the voyage inherent in the world of research. Harris agreed to accept Stan as a PhD student, and Stan won a fellowship to Baylor. Suddenly “school made sense” Stan said, because he was getting paid to be there, instead of the other way around. And because he was earning money it made the lab feel like a job. And Stan had always excelled at work, ever since his first newspaper route.\n\nThus began one of the most important relationships in Stan’s life. Harris Busch became “the closest thing to a father that I’ve had,” Stan said. Harris, and his wife, Rose — also a researcher — introduced Stan to “power science,” to rigor, and high intellect. Just about anything good in life, actually, except love, which Nancy had already shown him.\n\nIn a way it was surprising that Harris took to Stan, considering Stan was so green. Harris was notoriously hard on his PhD students and he didn’t suffer fools. When Stan showed up to begin the program at Baylor, he could still see the remains of Harris’s past battles strewn about, like warnings.\n\nStan Crooke: Harris was a really tough cookie. I mean, when I arrived, Harris took one graduate student at a time, one PhD student, and the previous PhD student was just finishing. And the story goes, I wasn’t there, but the story goes that Harris got so mad at him, told him he was worthless and didn’t deserve an office and bodily drug his desk out into the hall. When I arrived, he was still sitting in the hall at his desk.\n\nBrady Huggett: [laughs]\n\nStan Crooke: So I wouldn’t want you to think of Harris as warm and fuzzy. [laughs]\n\nBrady Huggett: But Busch had come from a modest place himself. He’d served in the US Army, had worked for the US Public Health Service after World War II, and had climbed hard and long to his current position. He saw something of himself in Stan.\n\nStan Crooke: People were terrified of him. You know, I was born looking for a fight, so Harris and I just hit it off, you know. Years later I asked Harris why in the world he took me. And he said, I thought you were really smart and I’d never seen anyone as angry as you. [laughs]\n\nBrady Huggett: [laughs]\n\nBrady Huggett: Harris also introduced Stan to RNA — ribonucleic acid — the single strand of the four base pairs (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil) found inside cells that play a part in protein production. This, too, was a big deal. It would help shape Stan’s research interests for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter that initial visit to meet Harris, Stan and Nancy moved to Houston. In this new environment, with his intellect fully challenged and engaged, Stan began to thrive, finishing his PhD in less than three years, and finding people at Baylor who felt and thought the way he did.\n\nHe met John Rose in an elevator on the Baylor campus. John was in his first year of medical school there, another “flyover person,” as John said, who had grown up in St. Louis, though he’d gone to Princeton for his undergraduate degree. The two men bonded over being outsiders, of sorts, both geographically and culturally, in the middle of Texas.\n\nJohn Rose: We were the 10-percenters. Ninety percent was good ol’ Texans. And then there were 10 percent of us from the rest of the world. I was coming out of the Ivy League. Which was ground zero for, again, the cultural revolution in the late ’60s. So we had a similar, like I say, cultural and political viewpoint, which was not shared by a lot of Texans at that time.\n\nBrady Huggett: Can you tell me a little bit more about this Cultural Revolution idea? I mean I understand the ’60s was, you know, you had the Vietnam War, you had Martin Luther King, Civil Rights era. You’re talking about all that?\n\nJohn Rose: We had women’s liberation, we had the beginning of the gay liberation movement. That all was happening, basically between Boston and Washington, DC. And in California, of course. From basically the whole ’60s. And, again, I’m not sure what was happening in Indiana, but Stan was certainly very much for the new order.\n\nBrady Huggett: Nancy gave birth to Evan in Houston in the fall of 1969. A very difficult labor, Nancy hemorrhaged, and Evan was born with a low Apgar score. The test determines if a newborn needs immediate attention, particularly resuscitation, and scores range from 0 to 10. Evan had a score of 5 — worrisome enough, but not critical.\n\nStill, the whole event had been scary, and Evan was the only child they would have — Stan wanted more, but doctors told them another pregnancy would be too risky for mother or child.\n\nEvan would be difficult to raise — he was smart, but had dyslexia and a speech impediment that kept him from enunciating clearly until he was 7 or 8. The only one who could understand him in those years was Stan, Evan told me. When Evan entered high school he was trailing his classmates by 4 or 5 grade levels, but overcame the dyslexia almost through anger and sheer will, he said, and graduated with honors and made the Dean’s list. In this way, from the outside his life would look a lot like his father’s — a late bloomer who then flourishes.\n\nEvan’s early troubles added another layer to Stan’s now very full life in Houston. He was a husband with a partner who was sometimes quite sick, and the father to a child who needed special attention. All the while in the midst of a grueling Phd-MD program. But Stan has never shied away from work. The problem wasn’t exhaustion, but rather that there weren’t enough hours in the day to handle it all.\n\nStan won the award for the most outstanding student in pharmacology, and started medical school in 1971, his PhD complete. He met Rick Hellman in orientation — Stan was now mature enough to actually attend orientations — and they, too, quickly became friends. Both were already married, both from the Midwest (Rick from Chicago) and both from working-class roots. Rick’s wife Pat got along well with Nancy and they were a tight foursome. Stan and Rick spent free time playing basketball while Nancy and Pat talked, Evan right here with them, and then the group would eat a picnic meal, because there wasn’t money for going out.\n\nBy 1975, Stan was nearing the end of medical school and his residency. John Rose had signed up for the National Service Corps, to begin a career as a country doctor, someplace where the need was great. This appealed to Stan’s caregiver mentality, his sense of a higher purpose, and he and John discussed possible rural places they could set up a practice together.\n\nJohn Rose actually went on to have that career. He and a partner built a general practice in Brownsville, California, a town about 75 miles north of Sacramento, and still only around 1,200 people today. It’s the foothills of the Sierras, beautiful, and remote. During the next 45 years, John would see more than 250,000 patients, and his partner even more. It is satisfying medicine, the kind that requires creativity, and fast thinking.\n\nJohn Rose: I got a call for a guy that had a heart attack when he was putting a roof on a building. And we make house calls and things, so I actually made a roof call. I had to grab my little bag and climb up on a ladder on this roof where this guy was having a heart attack and stabilize him while the ambulance was coming. Uh, delivered a baby in a driving rainstorm at the office. We didn’t have time to get to the hospital. And while I was getting her ready, the lights went out. And the volunteer fire department showed up and they had these big searchlights, and so that’s how we delivered the baby. In the office. Uh, there are hundreds of little stories like this.\n\nBrady Huggett: Including once trying to shock a man back to life by using a car battery, because the office didn’t have a defibrillator. When I asked John about his career, he told me he could “look in the mirror with a clear conscience.” He’s done the kind of doctoring that really matters, providing care to people who have no other options. This was nearly Stan’s career, too. He would have been great at it, with his tireless work ethic, his understanding that the world is unfair and that many who need help don’t get it.\n\nBut that’s not what happened. Harris Busch wanted Stan to become head of the oncology division at Baylor, but that didn’t happen either.\n\nThe main reason is that Nancy was getting sicker. She had what doctors could only describe as a vasculitis. It was becoming a constant part of her life, and thus Stan’s, too. Fever, headaches, vomiting, weight loss, and bouts in the hospital. Whatever it was, it remained mostly undiagnosed and untreatable with any real efficacy. Finishing up medical school, Stan knew he was going to need money, not only for Nancy but Evan, too, who would require private schools for his learning disability. So Stan couldn’t be a country doctor, and he couldn’t become a full-time professor and an academic researcher, scrambling around for government grants.\n\nHere’s Rick Hellman.\n\nRick Hellman: Senior year, our last year, when everything should be roses, is when Nancy was becoming ill. And this was very, very difficult. They had these ideas about what we’re going to do, and he had to make some really, really tough decisions in the face of basically working your buns off. I mean you were — medicine there, although the acuity in medicine is difficult, the patients, you really worked hard. And he had to make this really tough decision about stepping into the world of pharmacology. I don’t think Harris Busch was happy about it, but he had to do it. He knew what he had to do.\n\nBrady Huggett: What he had to do, was go where the money was. In his residency Stan had been seeing cancer patients, in particular testicular cancer patients, sometimes being the one to reveal a terminal diagnosis. These conversations required such compassion and intimacy that Stan called it “an honor” to be the one trusted enough to have them. In his experience seeing these patients, he’d come across a cancer drug called bleomycin sulfate. It had a crazy chemical structure, he said, and it sometimes produced odd side effects in patients. The exact mechanism of action for the drug wasn’t known, but it was thought to inhibit both DNA and RNA synthesis, and stop protein production. In some tests it has been shown to arrest the cell cycle, and thus was used to treat cancers. Bleomycin fascinated Stan, and he wanted to work with the analogs, so he called up the company that had them, Bristol Laboratories, and asked for a job.\n\nThey hired him. “People like me,” Stan said, didn’t go to industry back then. And by that he meant people who were accomplished researchers, because Stan had already reached double digits in scientific publications from his work at Baylor. But he also had a master’s in pharmacy and an MD. Even the year at Purdue didn’t hurt. Those sidesteps on his way toward his true calling were now meshing into something unique in the drug making world. Stan once told me he was “born knowing how to make a drug.” If that wasn’t exactly true, it seemed like he was ready now.\n\nStan and Nancy packed up Evan and moved the family to Syracuse, New York, in 1975. He became assistant director of medical research at Bristol Laboratories.\n\nWhen he got there, Stan realized there was no molecular biology department at Bristol, and not one at the Upstate Medical Center where he did rounds with cancer patients. To develop drugs, Stan would need that kind of team, so he went to his boss at Bristol and asked if he could set up a lab at Baylor. His boss gave him $40,000. Stan turned to his old mentor Harris Busch, who offered attic space at Baylor and some aged lab equipment — centrifuge, a battered refrigerator. Stan got the lab running and applied for some National Cancer Institute grant money, which he won.\n\nIt was enough to get him started. He began flying to Houston every two weeks, and over the next 5 years, he trained 5 PhDs, including a researcher named Chris Mirabelli, and 2 master’s students, and the lab published around 100 papers. He also lectured at Baylor, condensing his classes around his trips. He’s funny and self-effacing in front of a crowd, and students liked him. He was voted favorite Baylor faculty member in the college of medicine more than once.\n\nBy any account, he flourished at Bristol Labs, too. Under his watch, the company got new indications approved for Bleomycin and Mitomycin C, as well as Cisplatinum, among other cancer drugs. The cancer program he built, with the help of the research lab at Baylor, was thriving. He’d been promoted several times, and by 1980 was a vice president. He had quickly made a name for himself in the industry, and people began calling.\n\nIncluding Smith Kline & French Laboratories, in Philadelphia. The pharmaceutical company was on the upswing and flush with money from Tagamet, a histamine H2 receptor agonist, approved for ulcers and other gastric disorders. It was the first drug of its kind. Stan saw a bright future for himself there, and a ladder to even greater heights.\n\nStan Crooke: My appetite was to win everything. To be in control of everything. I wanted to be an MD-PhD, I wanted to be a great scientist, I wanted to be the CEO of a big company, because that was the highest rung. Nothing more. Just that kind of naked, blind, uninformed ambition.\n\nBrady Huggett: Huh.\n\nStan Crooke: That’s the honest — that’s about as truthful as I can say it.\n\nBrady Huggett: SmithKline knew it had a weakness — it didn’t discover or develop drugs well. And they knew the money coming in from Tagamet would eventually be eroded by competition. They brought Stan on in 1980 as a Vice President, overseeing Research & Development. Stan Crooke knows how to make drugs, they thought, and that was exactly what they needed. The company allowed him to build a gleaming new research facility on 300 acres in Upper Merion, the northwest part of Philadelphia, and he brought in academic researchers from the University of Pennsylvania to consult and collaborate. He knew, even then, that academic research could be more fertile ground for drug discovery than the staid halls of big pharmaceutical companies. All he needed to do was gather the talent and then guide it.\n\nStan also gave himself plenty to do on the side. The University of Pennsylvania was rebuilding its pharmacology department, and asked Stan to join the faculty, which he did, overseeing a collection of talented PhD students, including Brett Monia and Rosanne Snyder. He had given up the lab at Baylor, but was still a full professor there and regularly flew down to teach. He had his own lab in the research facility he’d built in Philadelphia, and also had an office in the executive building downtown, where he’d go once or twice a week. Every couple of weeks he flew to London to check in on a research facility there, spending two days before flying home, where he’d crash in his own bed before going into the office the next morning. Maybe once a quarter he flew to Belgium to visit the R&D team, where he supervised the discovery of the first recombinant DNA hepatitis B vaccine.\n\nHe was also scheduled to go to Bangalore every year in December. But he never made it, not once in all his years at SmithKline. The reason was Nancy.\n\n[music]\n\n[ad]\n\nBrady Huggett: Stan loves literature. William Faulkner and Mark Twain, Emily Dickinson. A little Sylvia Plath. He likes art, too, likes the history of it. But he has no talent for it. That was Nancy’s skillset. She was a great pianist, for example, and followed contemporary music. For years her younger sister had lived with them in Philadelphia, and one Christmas the sister gave Nancy a collection of new albums. Nancy sat looking at the intricate art on the covers, and thought they were original enough that she could curate a show around them. She spent two years flying to LA and putting together a collection of album cover art, and Stan and her wrote an accompanying picture book. Both were a success, and led her to consider the other forms of art that musicians did, which she also turned into a show. Through this work, they got to know Cat Stevens. David Crosby. John Rose remembers coming to visit the Crookes in Philadelphia and Richie Havens was singing in their living room. Nancy once got to be on stage during a David Bowie concert.\n\nSo what can be said about the life of Nancy Alder? Or Nancy Crooke, for that matter? She emitted a kind of vibrant joy when healthy. John Rose adored her. Rick Hellman and Pat loved her, too. Nancy had met Stan when his general opinion of women was low, given all the abuse and disdain his mother dumped on him. Nancy had changed that, shown him how caring, supportive and gentle a woman could be.\n\nBut something was wrong with her immune system, and there was no fixing it. It was bad genes, or maybe emotional remnants from her unhappy childhood, that toxic environment she’d grown up in. Maybe just bad luck. Or maybe a mix of all that, as Evan thinks. She had been in and out of hospitals over the years, had seen specialists, and no one seemed to know how to heal her. In Philadelphia it all got worse. She was in the hospital every few weeks. Her weight dropped to less than 100 pounds. In her last couple of years she was often in bed, struggling with migraines, weak from the vomiting they caused.\n\nHere’s Rick Hellman.\n\nRick Hellman: She had this terrible vasculitis syndrome, basically, that was just refractory to therapy. And I don’t know the particulars, but I know she kept on having problems with clots and vasculitis, weight loss and fever, pain — I mean, it was not good. And there are these vasculitis syndromes, and I didn’t pry about the specifics, but that’s what — and it was chronic and unremitting.\n\nHere’s John Rose.\n\nJohn Rose: It was an unusual vasculitis, that uh, uh, it was tragic. And the whole Nancy situation is tragic. Just tore us all apart. She was a wonderful, wonderful woman. Brilliant, creative, artistic. Extremely lovable. It was just tragic to get this illness that they couldn’t do anything with. And uh. Yeah. It still hurts me to think about it.\n\nBrady Huggett: The last 10 years of the family's life had been difficult, the final five almost unbearable. Obviously for Nancy, but Stan and Evan, too. Never a big eater, in the last year of Nancy’s life Stan himself had shrunk down to 130 pounds. He was also driving himself hard at work, partly because hard work defines him, but also partly because it was a respite from the awful scenes at home, the sight of Nancy so frail, and the depression her long illness was pulling him into. He’d hired all the help he could — housekeepers, nurses. That had been the reason for his career in pharma: to get the money to care for his wife, and his son. He’d done that. But her illness just kept getting worse, and Stan could do nothing but to stand around helplessly and watch.\n\nStan Crooke: I guess maybe five or six years before she died, I came to the conclusion that I was never going to be happy again. Being not happy — people who have been that know it feels like you moved to a planet with gravity that is 10 times more. It’s just this weight that you feel. And Nancy had become, um — she was never who I thought she was, I created that. But she became less and less. I mean her life just wasted her.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah.\n\nStan Crooke: I just saw myself taking care of her for the rest of her life, and Evan. And finding whatever moments of happiness I could get, however I did it. And, um, I saw no way out. I mean, looking back, I’m really quite certain I could never survive that again.\n\nBrady Huggett: Until, finally, it was over. She died in 1984, at 37 years of age. Here’s Evan.\n\nEvan Crooke: So, I, uh, I went to school one morning and came back home and the housekeeper was in the kitchen, hysterical. There was nobody else in the house. I was about 14. And she didn’t want me going upstairs, and I knew instantly, I had a feeling that something terrible had happened to my mom. So I ran upstairs and then searched in the master bedroom. She wasn’t there. We were living in a pretty big house at that time. I went down to the other guest rooms and so on, and then I went into one room. It was a guest room. And I went in there and saw the bed, and she was not on the bed. I looked to the one side of the bed, she wasn’t there. I looked to the left side and she was there on the floor. Her feet were blue.\n\nBrady Huggett: Oh no.\n\nEvan Crooke: And so, I didn’t touch her. I was sort of in shock, I didn’t, um. It registered in my head that obviously seeing blue feet was not a good sign.\n\nBrady Huggett: Stan got the news at work, while in a meeting.\n\nStan Crooke: My assistant came in — I mean it was a big meeting, I was chairing it — and said that there was a problem at home, um, and I needed to leave. And it seemed very clear to me that something bad happened. And she drove me, she drove me home. But I didn’t know for sure that Nancy was dead until I walked into the house.\n\nBrady Huggett: By then Evan was at the neighbor’s, and Stan collected him there. A terrible day. It would reverberate throughout Evan’s life. It was something they all knew was coming, but the suddenness of it still was traumatic. And, as is often the case, the ones left behind struggled with guilt.\n\nEvan Crooke: I remember that the night before I had, uh — I was in puberty, I was very irritated with my mom the night before. Because we were sitting down to dinner and she, uh, she was, I don’t know. She was just sick. She was sick and having a hard time, or she was just chewing with her mouth open, or something. It was something that under normal circumstances I should have tolerated but I didn’t. I think, I can make all the excuses in the world, but I think I was angry at her illness. Quite honestly, and for being ill. And being weak. I think I was angry at her for being weak. So I wasn’t very pleasant the night before, and we sort of got into a little bit of a verbal argument. And I was not, um, as kind as I should have been. Or would want to be. So, the next day, when I found her dead, the second person to find her dead. Um, that was, that weight was quite heavy.\n\nBrady Huggett: For Stan, it was something bigger. Given how much Nancy had supported him in his youth, how he’d clung to her, and what she had taught him about love when he had no idea what it was, it is not unreasonable to say she had saved his life. So, beyond the pain of her passing, what hurt Stan was that in the end, even with his advanced degrees and his research, and his access to leading scientific minds, he could not save hers.\n\nThey had been married for 20 years, and known each other even longer. She was the most important person in his life for decades. Stan knows that, will never forget it. But in his darker, most reflective moments, Stan will admit it was also a relief when she passed. Because at times during those final years, life did not feel worth living, and the two of them seemed locked in a “death spiral,” he said, that would never end.\n\nNow it had. Nancy’s illness had kept her from fully participating in their life, but now Stan was truly on his own with his son. They had only each other, and in the wake of Nancy’s passing Stan and a teenage Evan formed an even tighter bond, forever loyal to one another. Maybe that helped.\n\nMaybe work also helped. There was always joy in the job for Stan, as there had been his entire life.\n\nBut SmithKline would come to an end, too.\n\n[music]\n\nBrady Huggett: Tagamet had been discovered and developed by SmithKline & French. The drug was a major breakthrough. The man responsible for it — James Black — would win the Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1988, for his work with beta blockers and H2-receptor blocking drugs. Tagamet was approved in the UK in 1976 and the United States the next year. It immediately began wracking up sales, and by the time Stan joined the company, Tagamet was sold in 100 countries. SmithKline bought Beckman Instruments in 1981 as a growth strategy and became SmithKline Beckman, but it could not stave off the inevitable. By 1983, the pharmaceutical company Glaxo had introduced a competitor called Zantac, another H2-receptor blocker, and the company mounted a heavy marketing campaign to support it. Tagamet still hit sales of ~$1 billion in 1986, making it the world’s first blockbuster drug, and then peaked in 1987 with $1.1 billion in sales — a massive amount of money at the time. But sales began to slip from there as Zantac took market share. SmithKline also had the diuretic Dyazide, which brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in 1986, but was hit by the first generic competitor in 1987. SmithKline had no blockbuster drug coming up behind Tagamet or Dyazide to replace all that lost revenue, and as share prices fell, the company took heavy pressure from stockholders. A merger seemed likely.\n\nDrug development. Research. That was Stan’s area. By 1988 he was worldwide president of Research & Development, overseeing 3,000 researchers and a budget of more than $400 million. It was his job to generate new drugs, and he’d been given free reign to do just that, building the research facilities in Upper Merion to accomplish that goal.\n\nAnd yet, the drugs Stan had “resurrected” did not sell, he told me. That included Auranofin, an oral organic gold compound for rheumatoid arthritis. It had high marketing predictions, but it fizzled when approved, and eventually the space would come to be dominated by the tumor necrosis factor drugs.\n\nStan thought the best thing to do was continue to invest in research. He was dead set against a merger, and he was “very aggressive” about making his thoughts known, he said. But his arguments were falling on deaf ears, especially because sometimes it seemed Zantac had simply marketed its way to the top. This was opening up a tension between Stan and upper management, and pretty soon it was clear that he “wasn’t willing to stay,” and that “they didn’t want me,” he said.\n\nBut there was something else, too. Everyone knew Stan was smart, and his work ethic was above reproach. He also had a reputation for being fair — he would never ask you to do something he himself would not. If he told you to be in the lab on Saturday, you were assured he would also be there. But he drove his employees hard, and he was demanding, as always. Some chafed at that. Here’s Fred Frank, one of the first original big-time bankers in the biotech industry, talking about what happened at SmithKline in those years.\n\nFred Frank: Well I knew Stanley from his prior places. And I knew him quite well at SmithKline. And actually, people don’t really realize, he was fired at SmithKline. And uh —\n\nBrady Huggett: Why?\n\nFred Frank: He’s, you know, he’s very demanding of his people. And um, little bit too much of a control freak. Brilliant guy. I mean his record of new product development is second to none. [laughs] He’s an amazing guy. But he doesn’t tolerate anything but the best. And a lot of people can’t live up to his standards.\n\nBrady Huggett: The firing stung. So much so that when Stan talks about leaving SmithKline to this day, he will stress that he was fed up with the glacial pace of big companies, and he’ll point out that he’d learned that pharmaceutical giants like SmithKline can be nearly incapable of innovating. Both statements are true enough. But that does not override the fact that they cut him loose in August of 1988, and replaced him with George Poste, Stan’s second in command.\n\nStan once told me his three biggest faults are that he is “intemperate, intolerant and impatient.” That can be seen in the angry arrogance of his high school years, and in pharmacy school too, where he didn’t bother showing up for classes and disrespected the instructors. That impatience can be hard on those who work beneath him. It’s possible he’d also adopted the confrontational culture he’d seen at Bristol, where the scientists briskly challenged any and all science in order to pressure test it. Or perhaps Stan had modeled his management style on Harris Busch, who had once dragged a PhD student’s desk out into the hallway and left it there, publicly belittling the man because his science wasn’t good enough.\n\nWhatever the case, Stan struggled to be a good manager at SmithKline. After his departure, The New York Times wrote an article on SmithKline’s inability to generate new drugs, and dropped the blame squarely at Stan’s feet.\n\nThe article described Stan’s integration of academic researchers into SmithKline’s culture as “an unusual strategy” and called it “notably unsuccessful.” The article paraphrased an academic consultant from the University of Pennsylvania as saying he doubted academics had “the correct orientation to find major drugs,” as if Stan had been foolish for thinking they did.\n\nOn top of that, SmithKline, having seen what Glaxo did with its Zantac marketing, decided it would have the strategic marketing people work more closely with research — a move that would take power away from the science team and give it to the salespeople.\n\nFor a person who had built a research group where there had been none, and who had worked tirelessly even as his wife’s health slowly declined, this was particularly wounding.\n\nStan Crooke: And that affected me for years. And, um, you know, I had all kinds of other, horrible life events going on at the same time. So it was one of the hardest things I’ve experienced, and it did me a lot of harm. It took me years to recover — that article. Because it wasn’t true and it wasn’t fair. I thought I was an enormous success at a very young age, and there were people who agreed and there were people who didn’t. And that really infuriated me, because I knew I had done great things.\n\nBrady Huggett: Firing Stan wasn’t going to fix SmithKline — in 1989 it merged with the Beecham group, forming the second largest pharmaceutical company in the world. But that was little consolation. Stan’s public rebuke hurt because he’d felt like an outsider for most of his life, staring up. And when he’d finally joined these powerful people, they pushed him back down.\n\nHere’s Jeremy Levin, the CEO of Ovid Therapeutics and former chairman of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization. He has deep experience in the biotech and pharmaceutical worlds.\n\nJeremy Levin: If I were that person, I wouldn’t have a chip on the shoulder, I’d be pretty damn mad.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah.\n\nJeremy Levin: Because to fight your way out of those circumstances and then to go into these very stately, very mechanistic, very process-oriented organizations. And then to be successful and then to be rejected? You know, that’s a hard pill to swallow.\n\nBrady Huggett: If Stan had let any of his anger go during his success at Bristol, if he’d felt it dissipate with the control he was given at SmithKline to build a research group in his model, now it was back. He had worked like a dog for a company and they had cast him out. SmithKline had told him his way of thinking was wrong, when he knew it was not. The anger felt like he was young again, like he was a poor kid in the near East Side of Indianapolis staring at the rich people, who were not as smart as he was, and who did not impress him, and they were the ones running the world.\n\nSo this is Stan at 43. His childhood sweetheart and mother of his child is gone. He’s trained in pharmacy. He has a PhD in pharmacology, has worked extensively with RNA. He’s an MD with years of experience seeing patients, and fully understands their needs, and their fears. He had seen firsthand the shortcomings in the ways big pharmaceutical companies make drugs.\n\nBut also, he’d been publicly blamed by SmithKline, and had his name dragged through the mud by the world’s leading newspaper.\n\nHe was furious. The end of his time at SmithKline confirmed only one thing — he needed to be in a position where he answered to nobody but himself, and he’d do innovative science the way he knew it should be done, and never deviate.\n\nIt turns out that is exactly the kind of person, the kind of temperament, needed to develop a brand new drug modality. And for months before his firing, he had been working on an exit plan from SmithKline.\n\n[theme music]\n\nThank you, now and always, to Stan Crooke.

Chapter three will be out in a week. Until then.\n\nChapter 3: San Diego restart\n\nBrady Huggett: Chapter 3: San Diego restart\n\nIn 1978 a Harvard researcher named Paul Zamecnik and colleague Mary Stephenson published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences titled “Inhibition of a Rous sarcoma virus replication and cell transformation by a specific oligodeoxynucleotide.” It showed that by using a short, single-stranded piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (or, DNA) it was possible to slow a virus’s ability to replicate.\n\nZamecnik and Stephenson published a second paper on their work at the same time, but in truth the concept had larger implications than just that. When DNA is unzipped in the nucleus, a sequence of precursor ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is formed from one strand. That precursor RNA is then transformed into messenger RNA and released into the cell cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein.\n\nDNA and RNA are made of nucleotides, and the pattern of nucleotides in messenger RNA that codes for a protein is called a ‘sense’ sequence. The sequence of nucleotides that is exactly complementary to that sense sequence is called the ‘antisense’ sequence.\n\nWhat this work pointed to was that if oligonucleotides, which are just short strands of nucleotides, could be created to bond to the ‘sense’ strand in the cell cytoplasm, it would be possible to manipulate protein production. And that would have tremendous applications in the fight against disease, well beyond stopping viral replication.\n\nThe most-used descriptor for this “antisense” technology among scientists is the word “elegant.” Beautiful might be another term. Partially this is because the technology is so simple — an attempt to harness something already present in nature. But also because it is extremely specific. It uses the Watson and Crick discovery that DNA is a double-stranded molecule held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotide bases. That “Watson and Crick” hybridization means that antisense drugs, if crafted correctly, could bind only to the desired target RNA, and nowhere else. This specificity has long been sought after in drug development. It is a holy grail of sorts.\n\nThe term antisense would become synonymous with Stan Crooke, and antisense oligonucleotides would define the rest of his professional life. From Nature Biotechnology, I’m Brady Huggett, and this is Hope Lies in Dreams.\n\n[theme music]\n\nBrady Huggett: Rosanne Snyder had grown up knowing she wanted to be a scientist, and by the fourth grade she’d narrowed that focus down, specifically, to making drugs. She followed that path all the way to grad school, and the University of Pennsylvania pharmacology program. Before making her choice to enroll, she met Stan to see if she’d fit into his lab. Because she “loved pharmacology,” she wanted the close tie to industry that Stan’s lab promised. When she met him she immediately picked up on his intelligence and felt his lab would be a great place to learn, but beneath that she could also sense that he was hard-driving and demanding. She went home and told her husband that if she could “survive” Stan’s lab, she “could survive anything in the world,” and she asked to join his group.\n\nOnce she was there, she began to see the other side of Stan, the warm, affable side that earned him those teaching awards at Baylor, the soft side that comes out when he’s focused on patients. She was “stunned,” she said, to find how nice he could be, how caring he was to his PhD students, encouraging them to come to him with questions, night or day.\n\nShe was aware of Nancy’s illness and, like everyone else, saw the physical toll it took on Stan, who grew so thin in Nancy’s last year. And while in his lab, she began to have issues with her own personal life. Her marriage was “dissolving,” she said, and she carried the stress of that with her to the bench. Stan, who knew something about using work as a lifeline, told her to focus on her research, “something you can control,” he said.\n\nThat helped. It also helped to get out of the house, and to exercise. She began playing tennis with some other grad students on Saturdays, and Stan, still just in his late 30s at that point, joined when he could. A true friendship formed. When Rosanne’s marriage was over, and after Nancy had died, their friendship changed into something stronger. In their own way they’d each lost someone, each watched a future they’d once envisioned disappear. They helped each other through the process, talked about it. And when it was in their respective pasts they were able to look at each other in a new way.\n\n“I don’t know,” Stan told me. “We just came together.”\n\nHe and Rosanne were married by the end of 1986, about two years after Nancy’s death, and a year after Rosanne finished her PhD. They are still together today.\n\nThat was the first step toward Stan rebuilding his life. The second thing he needed to do was get out of SmithKline, because the company was in dire financial trouble. It had publicly predicted annual growth of 10% and that was not going to happen, with Tagamet under fire from Zantac. Stan himself knew the end was near when he got a call from SmithKline CEO Henry Wendt.\n\nStan Crooke: I get a call one night from Henry saying that he’s got bad news. And, instead of being 10% growth in profits, we were going to decline profits by 30%. And that we had to announce it. Uh, when I got that call, I decided that there was no way that SmithKline was going to survive and certainly I wasn’t going to be running R&D. Because remember I had to retool all of R&D. And it was still, you know, much work left to do. And there had been nothing in the pipeline.\n\nBrady Huggett: That phone call was the beginning of the end. Stan wanted more time to finish what he’d started with his research division, but he knew that when SmithKline announced that massive drop in earnings it would open the company up for a merger, and would severely curtail research spending — neither of which was he willing to support. He also knew, in the back of his head, that if there was a merger — as it looked like there would be — his dream of someday being CEO of SmithKline was probably over.\n\nIn typical Stan fashion, through a series of meetings with the top echelon of SmithKline, he openly expressed his distaste for their plans. That didn't help matters. He made it clear that he would not stay if the company was going to consider a merger or cut research, and it also became clear that SmithKline “didn’t want me,” Stan said.\n\nSo it was only a matter of time. Well before SmithKline let him go in 1988, and laid the blame for their empty drug pipeline at his feet in The New York Times article, Stan was thinking of what might be next. And he had an idea.\n\nIt came from a symposium series he and George Poste, Stan’s second in command, had put together at SmithKline. Sometime in 1987, Stan thinks, they brought in Paul Ts’O, a biologist from Johns Hopkins University working on oligonucleotides as antiviral and anticancer agents. As Ts’O presented his work, in the audience Stan sat up a little straighter. The idea itself was “seductive,” he said. It was rational and used nature’s own solution to specificity. And it appeared to be a simpler way to make drugs than building proteins themselves.\n\nStan dug up the original Zamecnik papers describing antisense. It had been nearly 10 years since they had been published and for many of those years the idea had languished. Partially this was because no one could quite reproduce what Zamecnik had done, and that made it easy to dismiss, but also because making DNA segments at the time was expensive and labor-intensive, which meant the raw material needed to do experiments was basically out of reach. Since those seminal papers on antisense, the field had progressed hardly at all.\n\nThough Stan had gotten approval for a handful of new cancer drugs while at Bristol, and the franchise he built there had helped advance cancer treatment, he knew those drugs were shotgun blasts to the body. For all the damage they did to the cancer they were aimed at, they hit a lot of other stuff, too, and he hated that. There had to be a better way, and antisense seemed like the answer. Stan took the Zamecnik papers and went looking for Dave Ecker.\n\nDave Ecker’s family is originally from Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania. That's coal country. His grandparents on both sides worked in the mines, and his father did, too, until the mines closed in the ’50s and the family moved to New Jersey for factory work. Dave became a first-to-college kid, attending the College of New Jersey, and then he earned his PhD in biochemistry at Utah State University, before doing a postdoc at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nHe has a good sense of humor and a sharp mind for details and history. This is him.\n\nDave Ecker: He came down to my office, I mean, he was up here as the head of worldwide R&D, but he had his own research group, of which I was one. And he came down with a publication from Paul Zamecnik and he plunked it on my desk. And he said, Look at this concept. Think about this. If you could use oligonucleotides as therapeutics, they have this Watson-Crick specificity. And there is no better specificity in biology than the Watson-Crick interaction. That’s how nature stores information, that’s how nature transmits information. And he says, Wouldn’t it be awesome if we could make a category of drugs based upon that kind of specificity? And so that was, um, that was ground zero.\n\nBrady Huggett: Stan acknowledged antisense was “light years away” from being a therapeutic. But he still wanted Dave to try to run some experiments. SmithKline’s merger with Beckman Instruments in 1981 had given the company access to a DNA synthesizer — a short-lived model not as good as the ones being made by Applied BioSystems, but it allowed Dave to “make DNA” and that meant he could actually begin to explore oligonucleotides.\n\nIt was slow going. Any oligo you put into plasma degraded “within minutes” Dave told me, and for a while they didn’t make “anything that mattered.” Dave spent his off time thinking about what chemical modifications were possible to entice the oligonucleotides to last longer in the body, and then one day Stan floated a proposition.\n\nDave Ecker: It was 1988, I remember it was the summer time. And uh, because he was busy, he was head of worldwide R&D for a major pharma organization, we had to steal time whenever we could to go over our research. So I would go on the weekend, like I would go on Saturday out to his house and we’d shoot some hoops of basketball and I’d bring my data from the week. And we’d sit and talk science and so forth. When we were done one day, he said, I’m thinking about starting a company to do antisense, and we would leave SmithKline. And I said, OK. [laughs] Would you like me to come along? And he said, Absolutely, I’d like you to help me get it going.\n\nBrady Huggett: SmithKline had yet to fire Stan, but in his mind, he was already gone. And he’d formulated an exit plan.\n\nWhat Stan wanted was an organization that would focus on science, and science alone. It would be built around R&D — his strengths — and it would have nothing to do with the marketers, or the sales people who were currently getting more attention at SmithKline. If that top rung he’d been reaching for — big pharma CEO — was gone, he’d need to find some other way to lead the kind of company he thought drug development needed. He just wasn’t sure what form that might take.\n\nBack when he’d been at Bristol, he’d been friendly with one of the company’s finance people, Mark Skaletsky. Mark understood the ways in which drug research could be funded, and Stan went to him for his thoughts. Mark sent Stan to a venture capitalist he knew, named Chris Gabrieli.\n\nChris had once been a medical school student at Columbia, but his father — a physician and researcher himself — had gotten the family into financial trouble with a few “pipe dream” ideas, and Chris had to drop out. For lack of any other way to make money, Chris began shopping one of his father’s ideas to those same VCs who were “never willing” to back his father, he said. But with Chris behind the idea, it was better received. He founded a healthcare software company, named it GMIS, and eventually sold it for $250 million. That earned him in 1986 a position at Bessemer Venture Partners, a venerable name in the VC world.\n\nChris Gabrieli knew nothing about drug companies, but Genentech — a young flagship biotech on the west coast at the time — had recently gone public, and Bessemer thought this burgeoning industry might be worth investing in. It wanted Chris to launch the firm’s healthcare practice, and this meant that Chris was actively looking for biotech investments when Mark Skaletsky told him about Stan. Chris thought Stan at least would be a good person to meet.\n\nThis is Chris.\n\nChris Gabrieli: So, when I first met him, he was in an awesome office inside a new research and development building that he took a lot of pride in having helped build. He was a commanding presence, he had a huge office, he’s a commanding individual, as you know. Um, the next time I met him, in person, he had been relegated to this type of site where SmithKline, I think, sent people who were definitely leaving. He was at SmithKline Chemicals. He was in this chemicals factory, in sort of a crappy little office that, you know — he had been demoted-slash-moved out-slash something. I mean, I was very respectful of him, he was an MD-PhD, I was 27 or 28 years old, he was, 40s —\n\nBrady Huggett: 40-something, yeah.\n\nChris Gabrieli: So I certainly, I certainly didn’t say, like, Well you seem to be downwardly mobile here! [laughs]\n\nBrady Huggett: [laughs]\n\nBrady Huggett: It was clear that something was going on with Stan and SmithKline — the former head of worldwide R&D was now stuck in an off-site office, with chemical trucks groaning by on the highway outside the building. In their meetings, Stan asked Chris what he was looking at for investments. Chris had been researching a young company called Vertex, which was built around a protein crystallography technology that the founders hoped would open the door to new drugs. Vertex would, of course, go on to be a massively successful company, today valued at more than $50 billion, but the science back then was not revolutionary enough for Stan.\n\nChris Gabrieli: He told me, Well, protein crystallography, we all have protein crystallography. Why is that a small company? What’s the edge? So, I thought that was a pretty good argument. And I said, OK, well what’s a better idea? And he said, Well, there’s this thing called antisense oligonucleotides, which I’ve always thought would be interesting but I can’t even get my own people to research it, it’s too risky.\n\nI wrote down, frenetically, antisense oligonucleotides. I didn’t, you know, I didn’t know what that word really meant, but Stan didn’t seem like the kind of guy you’d admit your ignorance to.\n\nBrady Huggett: [laughs]\n\nChris Gabrieli: So, uh, I wrote it down, pretended like I knew what it was. He explained it pretty well and I read some more about it. And so that’s how — when I said to him, OK, well what’s your better idea? He told me what his better idea was.\n\nBrady Huggett: Soon enough Chris would see the article in The New York Times, blaming Stan for the empty pipeline. That did give Chris pause. But in truth, in those meetings, he was taken with Stan’s intelligence, his experience, and his conviction behind his “best idea.” While out looking for investments, Chris had already sensed that the academic scientists and mid-level pharma executives who were populating the nascent biotech industry at the time, “knew nothing” about making drugs, he said. But here was Stan, a man who had lived a big pharma life and had already ushered several drugs to the market, and who was also a top-level scientist. This combination seemed worth betting on.\n\nIt helped that Chris himself had been an entrepreneur, and knew what it took. Entrepreneurs, he thought, perform best when cornered, when they are in a desperate place, as he had been when he’d been forced to drop out of medical school. Failure was not an option for him at that point, and he got a whiff of something similar from Stan.\n\nChris Gabrieli: I believe entrepreneurs succeed because they have no other choice. And so here was a guy who had succeeded, and then, you know, had this black mark. And I thought, He is going to do — this is his best idea, and he is going to, you know, kill himself or others trying. That’s all you can ever do. The idea seemed big, and the guy seemed driven.\n\nBrady Huggett: And besides all that, it is difficult to hear about the machinations behind antisense and not marvel at its simplistic beauty. The problem was that even Stan didn’t know exactly what to do next. He thought they could finance a leveraged buyout some place, get a chunk of money on loan against the assets of a small pharma company, install Stan as the CEO and run it solely as a research unit. That would give Stan total control over operations, and they’d focus on antisense.\n\nBut Chris was a venture capitalist, not a banker. “What’s that old saying?” he said to me. “When you’re a hammer, everything looks like a nail?” Chris knew startups, and so everything to him looked like a startup. And he was convinced that was the correct vessel for Stan’s antisense dream. Stan agreed. Now all they needed was to construct the bones of the thing and convince Bessemer to write a check.\n\nChris Gabrieli: So I said to him, I’m interested. But you’d have to have, like, a business plan. Three or four days later, a full business plan — no perfect, but pretty damn good — shows up. He’s that kind of guy, right? And I look at this thing and I go, I love this guy. I want to work with this guy. Because normally people would take a month! Or six months! Or they’d say, I need you to hire me a consultant who writes business plans. And it was a pretty good business plan. And we dove right in.\n\nBrady Huggett: Chris went to his partners at Bessemer and asked for seed money. He came back with $50,000 and handed it over. This was the beginning of the company, in July 1988. Stan would be officially let go from SmithKline in a matter of weeks, and with that money they would begin to build an antisense company.\n\nStan and Rosanne’s house in Bryn Mar became an incubator of sorts. Chris Gabrieli is listed early on as a co-founder of the new company for his role in its financing, but the three scientific founders were Stan Crooke, Dave Ecker and Chris Mirabelli. Chris Mirabelli had gone to pharmacology school at Baylor for his PhD — mainly because they offered him a “free ride” he said — and Stan was his thesis advisor there, back when Stan was still at Bristol. When Stan moved to SmithKline and needed to start a molecular pharmacology department, he asked Chris Mirabelli to come aboard upon completion of his thesis.\n\nMirabelli has been at SmithKline about 8 years and risen to director of the molecular pharmacology department. He’d been investigating oligonucleotides with Stan, though they hadn’t been able to get SmithKline executives to “embrace it,” Mirabelli told me. He was an obvious fit for the new company, and Stan asked him to join.\n\nStan Crooke, who had lost Nancy and left behind his boyhood family, was creating a new one. He had Evan and Rosanne, and now his old students and co-workers were rambling around the house, too. Rosanne remembers that time as exciting, a handful of people always seemingly gathered in the kitchen or the living room, yellow legal pads in hand, talking about oligonucleotides, with her right there in the middle of it. What were the hurdles to using them in the body? What might their toxicology profiles look like? How could they be manufactured? How could they be delivered to the patient? And how would the Food and Drug Administration regulate all this? There was a lot to consider, but it did not seem insurmountable.\n\n[music]\n\n[ad]\n\nBrady Huggett: First, the new company would need an intellectual property lawyer, and to raise an official, sizable amount of funding. They also needed a name. Stan figured he’d call it Crooke Pharmaceuticals, but it was quickly pointed out that his last name was a branding problem. For a while they thought they would call the company Mercury, after the fleet-footed messenger god in Greek mythology, playing off the concept of messenger RNA as a drug modality. But the branding was off there, too — no one was going to buy drugs from Mercury Pharmaceuticals. Dave Ecker came up with Isis, the Egyptian god of healing, and that name stuck.\n\nThe other big question was where to place it. The biotech scene was growing in two main areas of the US then. The Bay area in San Francisco had Genentech. Cambridge in Boston had Biogen and Genzyme as flagships. The Isis team considered both locations, but Stan leaned toward California. Mainly, he said, because the weather was better. Real estate in San Francisco was already too expensive, but Stan had frequently flown to Carlsbad during his time at SmithKline to visit a Beckman Instruments division there, touching down into tiny Palomar airport. He remembered the area around the airport as being mostly undeveloped. Carlsbad is some 35 miles up Interstate 5 from San Diego, and he sent Chris Mirabelli out to scout the area, with the difficult job of trying to explain to potential landlords what Isis as a company was, and what they would need.\n\nChris Mirabelli: So I went, and I end up getting introduced to the landlord of what was called the Santa Fe, I think it was the Santa Fe Railroad Research complex, or whatever it was. There was no biotech going on.\n\nBrady Huggett: Yeah.\n\nChris Mirabelli: And so I remember going and meeting this guy, and I start to tell him what our business plan was. This guy is looking at me like — [laughs]\n\nBrady Huggett: [laughs] What are you talking about?\n\nChris Mirabelli: What are you talking about? [laughs]\n\nBrady Huggett: Dave Ecker made trips, too.\n\nDave Ecker: So I drove up here and scouted around and found this street called Faraday Avenue. It was dedicated to being, like, a future science park. Except there was no science on it at the time. There was golf companies and all kinds of other things. But somebody had envisioned science somewhere along the line because the streets are all named after scientists.\n\nBrady Huggett: [laughs]\n\nDave Ecker: So we found a nice spot and we leased half of a building. And, now again, 1988, 1989, the notion of building out a lab was foreign to any architect or building firm in the area. So I had to go sit with my chemist — we hired somebody to do the chemistry. And the chemist and I, we went down to an architect and we sat down and the architect says, Well, you’re gonna build a lab. So what’s in a lab?\n\nWell there’s benches.\n\nWell how high are they?\n\nI don’t know, they’re about to here. There’s plumbing in them.\n\nWhat kind of plumbing?\n\nWe had to basically sit and recapitulate in our minds what a lab looked like. And they\n\nhad to draw it up and go get plans approved by the city. It was like a nine-month process.\n\nBrady Huggett: Nine months was too long to sit around waiting, and anyway, that has never been Stan’s style. So they secured a temporary space in a town called Sorrento Valley, about 25 miles south of Carlsbad, allowing them to begin running experiments while they tried to nail down a first round of venture capital funding. Here’s Dave Ecker again, talking about Sorrento Valley.\n\nDave Ecker: There was, like, huge storage garages and stuff like that. So we found one, and occupied it, and uh, set up a lab. We built tissue culture hoods out of 2x4s and plastic. The chemistry area, we had these huge warehouse roll-up garage doors with the big pane where you raise this thing up. We put the chemistry in there. We managed to find how we could buy some fume hoods and the like. And, uh, we got started.\n\nBrady Huggett: When Brett Monia finished his thesis back in Philadelphia, where Chris Mirabelli had been his advisor, he joined the team in Sorrento Valley. By now they were into 1989. A roughshod group filled with enthusiasm and free from the constraints of SmithKline, but short on money and material. They learned that if all four hoods were turned on at once in their converted space, it sucked the air from the room and the chemists would pass out. This was “bad for morale” Stan wryly told me, and it isn’t exactly conducive to good science, either. But it didn’t seem to matter. Isis was consumed with the mission, high on what they were doing, and proper ventilation was something they’d fix, along with everything else, when they moved into their space up Interstate-5 in Carlsbad.\n\nThey soon added Frank Bennett, who had been at Baylor and then did his post-doc under Stan at SmithKline. He came on as a senior scientist at Isis. Why not? he thought. He already knew the team, and loved the idea of focusing on oligonucleotides full time. He figured they’d know within three years if the technology would succeed or fai"
