For the uninitiated, that is not a comment on the text, but rather the title of David Wong's (Jason Pargin) newest entry into the John Dies in the End series. Much like Wong's previous two novels, John Dies in the End and This Book is Full of Spiders, What the Hell Did I Just Read follows the misadventures of best friends John and David and David's girlfriend Amy, as they reluctantly battle evil forces from another dimension - forces that often only they can see. The comedy is consistent throughout the book series and cleverly low-brow, as one would expect from the editor-in-chief of Cracked. The title question is apt, however, as what sets this novel apart is its depth. While the previous books touched upon larger societal issues, on this round Wong brings a full artistic assault to the page as he heightens the meaning of the unreliable narrator by presenting the story via the different recollections of the three main characters as they fight an enemy that is able to change the way they perceive the world. As the true nature of the enemy is revealed, Wong skillfully questions the nature of human perception, and how that effects everything from basic animal instincts to parental love. Whether you are a looking for a fun sci-fi romp or a deeper exploration of nature of humanity, What the Hell Did I Just Read will keep you wondering just that until the end, and then wishing you could read more.\n\nAngels In The Sky\n\nRobert Gandt\n\nW. W. Norton & Company\n\n500 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10110\n\nwww.wwnorton.com\n\n9780393254778, 26.95, Hardcover, 464 pages\n\nClark Isaacs, Reviewer\n\nhttp://clarkisaacs.ning.com\n\nAll the activities in this non-fiction chronicle of Israel fighting for its independence are true! Robert Gandt is a sock-em - rock-em type of writer. His descriptive passages of the how non-Israeli pilots delivered their flight expertise to the enemies of Israel earned them the title of Angels in the Sky!\n\nIn 1947 and 1948, Israel had to fight for credibility to become a State of Israel. It was not enough that the United Nations partitioned Palestine creating both Jewish and Arab States, which were to exist side by side. No, it was a time when even with this mandate, Israel had to physically fight with its surrounding neighbors in a death struggle both on the ground and in the air. This book is about the air battles, how they fought, how pilots flew, and most of all where the planes came from. Angels also is a memorial to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice in pursuit of freedom for the Israeli people.\n\nThough many of the pilots who died were Israeli, many came from other countries. Britain, Canada, United States, and South Africa were the countries of origin for members of fellowship of conscientious air force fighters tagged with the title of \"Bagel Lancers.\"\n\nRobert Gandt describes with exacting detail the airfields, which housed the many different planes flown by this specialized squadron. He visited each of them and spent considerable time doing his research chronicled in the extensive bibliography, which lists not only his sources, but also describes life after the war of many of those who he wrote about in the pages of this epic tale.\n\nWhat you will like best about this book is the manner in which history is interspersed with descriptive passages about air battles and bombing raids. How the ingenuity of some men in acquisition of planes from Czechoslovakia led to the founding air force. Planes obtained from the United States government had their own unique acquisition.\n\nNo story about the foundation of the Jewish State would be complete without mentioning the various transporting of guns, ammunition, and crews that performed the day-to-day laborious tasks involved. These people are front and center, but one element not left out is that many of those who were a part of Angels in the Sky were not Jewish! They were patriots who felt the need to insure freedom to the people of Israel!\n\nThis is a FIVE Star book you cannot put down; highly recommended.\n\nFatal North: Murder and Survival on the First North Pole Expedition\n\nBruce Henderson\n\nBruceHendersonBooks\n\nwww.BruceHendersonBooks.com\n\n9780451409355, $5.99 Kindle, $14.99 PB\n\nVicki Hill\n\nReviewer\n\nFATAL NORTH: MURDER AND SURVIVAL ON THE FIRST NORTH POLE EXPEDITION examines Charles Francis Hall's intense drive to discover the North Pole in 1871, his mysterious death, and the survival of those in the crew left behind. Bruce Henderson wrote TRUE NORTH: PEARY, COOK, AND THE RACE TO THE POLE, and is one of the best at historically based adventure stories. His writing \"reads itself\" because of his to-the-point crystal-clear style.\n\nHenderson shows his mastery of structure by beginning the book with the expedition to the Danish territory of Greenland in 1968 to investigate Hall's grave, and ending the book with the results of the autopsy and investigation.\n\nEven though Hall was not an expert seaman or scientist, \"he had traveled more than three thousand miles by dog sledge, hunted with Eskimos, learned to build an igloo, and developed a taste for seal blubber\". A major theme of the book is the knowledge of the Eskimo crew members, and how it was often discounted. For example, Henderson gives us this succinct and enlightening description of how igloos were built and food obtained for the expedition.\n\n\"First, the ground was leveled off, and then the half of the floor farther from the entrance was slightly raised above the other half. The raised part at the back was the parlor and bedroom; the front part was the workshop and kitchen.\" And this concerning the vital art of seal hunting: \"A native hunter sometimes remains sitting over a seal hole - bundled up in skins and not moving or making a sound - for as long as forty-eight hours before getting a chance to strike. And if the first stroke is not accurate, the game is lost.\"\n\nThe account of the voyage details the betrayal of probably the most appalling group of scientists (Bessels and Meyer) and sailing master (Buddington) to ever be assigned to a polar expedition. The second half of the book recounts the rescue of the crew stranded on the ice for 197 days due to the treachery and incompetence of those who took the ship after Hall's death.\n\nThanks to the description of the 1968 expedition, and Henderson's dedication to evoking the past, we can better understand the dark forces that defiled the noble aims of arctic exploration, and why Charles Francis Hall was a hero.\n\nAndrea's Bookshelf\n\nWe're Amazing 1,2,3!\n\nLeslie Kimmelman, author\n\nMary Beth Nelson, illustrator\n\nBig Golden Book\n\nc/o Random House Children's Books\n\n1745 Broadway, 10-1, New York, NY 10019\n\nwww.randomhouse.com/kids\n\n9781524766214, $10.99, HC, 32pp, www.amazon.com\n\nElmo introduces his longtime friend Julia to Abby, who's a little confused at first because Julia isn't saying hello.

But in December 1941, the Empire of Japan invades the colony. The family is quickly dragged into a spiral of violence, repression, and starvation. To survive, they entomb themselves and their friends in the Leung mansion. But this is only a temporary reprieve, and the Leungs are forced to send their children away. The youngest boy, Chung-Man, escapes with some of his siblings, and together they travel deep into the countryside to avoid the Japanese invaders. Thrown into a new world, Chung-Man befriends a young couple who yearn to break free of their rural life. But their friendship ends when the Japanese arrive, and Chung-Man is once again taken captive.

Yet it is not truly an autobiography. That sounds confusing and, if you begin this book expecting a conventional novel, it will be.\n\nThe author (and probably the narrator, too) believes in travelling between genres. In interviews, Chaudhuri has said that he has always \"explored the edges of what is conventionally called fiction\" and that he is uneasy with accepting certain stable categories. He believes that there is always an element of imagination in non-fiction and that there is always an element of truth in imaginative writing.\n\nSo, Friend of my Youth, is more like an imaginative memoir than a novel. Amit, the narrator, returns to his homeland, India, and to places in which he once lived, and he sees them anew whilst remembering his earlier impressions and recording new ones.\n\nAmit's 'friend of his youth', Ramu, is his \"oldest surviving friend in Bombay\". Not that other friends are dead, but they have just lost touch. Ramu is not a close friend, just someone Amit always expects to see again, someone who is reliably always there. But on this current visit to Bombay, Ramu is in rehab for his long-term drug addiction and is not to be contacted. Amit ponders their casual reliance on each other, remembers things about their past meetings, and, when Ramu is unexpectedly released from rehab, their meetings with each other are both familiar and strange.\n\nAmit remembers the terrorist attack which partly destroyed the Taj Hotel in Bombay. He sees the reconstruction which is new, yet strangely re-creates remembered rooms, restaurants and meals. Much has gone but there are still shops where he has always shopped for his mother, shopkeepers who know the family, hotel staff who recognise him and who knew his father. Past and present merge. So it seems that \"In the Taj, time moves both backward and forward. I check out; someone else arrives. Suitcases follow the bell boy's trolley. Nothing has changed\". And exploring the area around the hotel with Ramu it seems that things \"haven't changed very much. Yet it's all different\". In many ways this offers a parallel to the way Amit remembers the past and views the present.\n\nAmit Chaudhuri, the author, writes like the poet he is. His prose is simple but rich. His memories and his descriptions are vivid and arresting. And the boundaries between fact and fiction are so blurred that there is a seductive allure to this near autobiography, near memoir. You feel that you are getting to know the author and his life, but his philosophy of travelling between genres and of self-representation through art make it impossible to know what imagination has woven into his story.\n\nIn the end, the unattributed quotation from a work by Benjamin Franklin with which this book begins is a guide to the source of Chaudhuri's approach to novel-writing. He clearly supports Franklin's view that \"In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest the tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it\". Friend of my Youth is nothing like a traditional novel and should be read with Franklin's view in mind.\n\nThe Good People\n\nHannah Kent\n\nLittle, Brown & Company\n\nc/o Hachette Book Group\n\n1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10104\n\nwww.hachettebookgroup.com\n\n9780316243964, $27.00, paperback, 386 pages\n\n\"It is out of respect that I call them the Good People, for they do not like to be thinking of themselves as bad craturs\". \"...'tis true that they sometimes cause mischief, and that is why people come to me....I have the knowledge and the cure if the fairies do be striking you or taking the profit out of your animals or crops, or the power out of your legs\".\n\nNance Roche is the local 'handy woman'. She helps women in childbirth. She leads the keening and knows how to release the soul of the newly dead. And she also has 'the knowledge', passed on to her by 'Mad Maggie', and can use herbs and charms to deal with the fairies.\n\nIn 1825, in the remote Irish village where the newly widowed Nora lives and cares for four-year-old grandson, Micheal, superstition is deeply embedded in the lives of the people. The sudden death of Nora's husband, Martin, at the crossroads where the unbaptised are buried, and surrounded by inauspicious omens, causes consternation. The mysterious spastic condition of her grandson, too, is the subject of suspicion. And when the doctor and the priest fail to cure Micheal, it is clear to Nance Roche that the real Micheal, who had been a beautiful healthy child until the age of two, has been stolen by the fairies and a fairy child left in his place.\n\nThe new priest of the village is determined to stamp out the ungodly practices of his parishioners. He opposes all Nance does and, when Micheal dies during one of her fairy-banishing rituals, the police and the courts become involved.\n\nA young girl, Mary, who has been employed by Nora to help care for Micheal becomes involved in all this and she, too, is accused of assisting in Micheal's death.\n\nThe core of the book, however, is not the trial for murder, but the lives of the villagers, the strength of their superstitious beliefs, and the way in which these influence all their actions. All of Nance's charms and rituals are done to oppose evil, to protect and heal, and to ensure health and survival. The villagers believe in this and believe in her powers, often with good reason, since her herbal remedies effect cures. The tension between religion and folk-superstition, justice and judgement - all is part of the story and all is demonstrated through the lives of Hannah Kent's characters.\n\nAs the quotation below (chosen at random from many others) shows, Kent writes beautifully about the Irish land and climate:\n\n\"December arrived and bled the days of sunlight, while the nights grew bitter, wind-rattled. The water that pooled outside beneath the doorstep was tight with ice by morning and starlings lit upon the thatched roofs of the valley, circling the smoking chimney holes for warmth\".\n\nShe is good, too, at suggesting the suspicions, and the half-hidden secrets and gossip which pervade the lives of the village people. And she has clearly done a great deal of research about Ireland in the 1820s; about folk-lore, herbal lore, folk-beliefs; and about the customs and yearly events and celebrations which shaped village life. The trouble, for me, is that every bit of research seems to have been written into the story. Sometimes this adds interest but at other times, as in the Sahmain (Halloween - All Souls' Night) scaring of Nora I found it overly contrived.\n\nThe use of accents on names (Micheal, Nora, Aine, Sean, Eilis) which made me stop and wonder about their pronunciation each time I met them; the often untranslated Irish words and phrases dotted into the text; the archaic language - all of this began to grate. It became predictable that yet another disaster would occur and be put down to magic. And I found the extent and depth of the villagers' belief in folk-superstitions overdone and hard to credit. My grandmother (born in the late 1890s) was, like Nora, early widowed and she lived in a small, gossipy, country village, She followed some superstitious practices and knew of a woman in the next village who, reputedly, had the magical power to stop horses outside her house and had broken a man's arm by witchcraft. None of these things governed her life in the way the superstitions of Hannah Kent's villagers govern theirs. Perhaps it was different eighty years earlier and in an Irish Catholic community.\n\nFrom the start, too, Nora's hiring of a girl to help her care for her grandson bothered me. Nora had a small, poorly furnished, thatched cottage (presumably rented like most of the houses in the village), a few chickens and one cow. She sold butter and eggs when she could and her husband had been employed to dig ditches. Would a recently widowed woman, in winter when crops are scarce, fields bare and cows give less milk, have even considered hiring help? Could she have afforded to do so?\n\nThese caveats aside, The Good People is well written, has many tense and exciting moments, and will delight readers who love stories full of Irish characters, fairies and magic.\n\nThe Necessary Angel\n\nC.K.Stead\n\nAllen and Unwin\n\nhttps://www.allenandunwin.com\n\n9781760631529, A$32.99, paperback, 220 pages\n\nC.K.Stead's characters live in a Parisian society in which intelligence is valued and literature and politics are widely discussed. So, although the themes of the book are of love and fidelity, the characters are sophisticated, witty and urbane.\n\nMax Jackson, who has lived in Paris \"long enough to feel at ease if not at home\", is an expatriate New Zealander, a writer and a part-time academic in the Department of Comparative Literature at the Sorbonne Nouvelle. He is currently helping to organise a conference - a journee d'etudes - on eight French and English poets who were killed or wounded in World War 1, and he is also trying to work on a critical book about the authors Doris Lessing and V.S.Naipaul.\n\nSylvie Reynard, who has recently joined the Department, is also part of the organising committee and after a conference meeting she and Max get swept up in the Paris streets by Midsummer Night revellers and end up in Sylvie's flat. Their attraction is mutual but both already have partners.\n\nSylvie is living with a dour German, Bertholdt Volker, who is temporarily working in Paris and whose wife is in Berlin. Max and his French wife, Louise, are currently occupying separate floors in the house which she owns, but their separation is still tentative and they are still very much involved in each other's lives and with their two small children. Louise is also an academic at the Sorbonne Nouvelle, ranked above Max in the hierarchy there, and she is immersed in editing a new edition of major novel by Flaubert.\n\nTo add to Max's uncertainties, a student (not from his classes) appears in his university room to discuss a poem he had written long ago but which she has discovered and found 'thrilling'. She is a devotee of Gurdjieff, describes herself as 'mad', and tells him she is taking Lithium for a mental problem. Max is wary, fascinated and flattered by her determination to resurrect the long-buried poet in him.\n\nThis sounds like a run-or-the-mill, tangled, love story but Stead makes it much more than that. Paris and the French way of living are essential to the mood of the book and the actions of the characters. Literature, literary references, and detailed discussion of books like Martin Amies so-called 'Holocaust novel', occur quite naturally in the text. And recent political and terrorist events in France are part of general conversation. In addition, an old painting owned by Louise, which is believed by her wealthy extended family to be an authentic Cezanne (but which has never been formally authenticated), suddenly disappears from the wall of her living room. Jealous family members and the 'mad' student, Helen, are possible culprits.\n\nStead's writing is sophisticated, thoughtful, often wryly funny, and a pleasure to read. Through Max, he makes dry comments about the culture of French academia, and about writers like Naipaul: \"The publishers put it out as a novel but it's really autobiography - and not interesting....He just sweats it out as a writer, doesn't mention his wife - and goes for walks!\". And, at one point, we sit in on a provocative lecture which Max gives on Nabokov's Lolita. Stead's other characters are complex and interesting. And through Helen, the 'mad' student, he explores the disordered, intuitive thinking of an intelligent but mildly disturbed mind.\n\nStead, like Max, is a New Zealander and a writer. He is currently an emeritus professor of English at the University of Auckland, New Zealand Poet Laureate, and recipient of the Prime Minister's Award for Fiction and is a Member of the Order of New Zealand.\n\nDr. Ann Skea, Reviewer\n\nhttp://ann.skea.com\n\nBethany's Bookshelf\n\nWhy I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race\n\nReni Eddo-Lodge\n\nBloomsbury Circus\n\nc/o Bloomsbury Press\n\n175 Fifth Avenue, Suite 315, New York, NY 10010\n\nwww.bloomsbury.com\n\n9781408870556, $27.00, HC, 272pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: In 2014, award-winning British journalist Reni Eddo-Lodge wrote about her frustration with the way that discussions of race and racism in Britain were being led by those who weren't affected by it. She posted a piece on her blog, entitled: 'Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race'.\n\nHer words hit a nerve. The post went viral and comments flooded in from others desperate to speak up about their own experiences. Galvanised by this clear hunger for open discussion, Reni decided to dig into the source of these feelings.\n\nNow with the publication of an a comprehensive and detailed study of book length \"Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race\" deftly explores issues ranging from the eradication of black history, to the political purpose of white dominance, to whitewashed feminism, to the inextricable link between class and race.\n\nIn the pages of \"Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race\", Reni offers a timely and essential new framework for how to see, acknowledge and counter racism. It is a searing, illuminating, absolutely necessary exploration of what it is to be a person of colour in Britain today -- and offers universal insights applicable to American race relations as well.\n\nCritique: Offering extraordinary and articulate insights into contemporary race relations, \"Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race\" is impressively informative, exceptionally well written, organized and presented, and an essential, core addition to both community and academic library Contemporary Social Issues in general, and Race Relations supplemental studies lists in particular.

As they blend their different voices to create something beautiful, LGBTIQ singers stand together and make themselves heard.\n\nComparing queer choral performances to the uses of group singing within the civil rights and labor movements, \"A Queerly Joyful Noise\" maps the relationship between different forms of oppression and strategic musical forms of resistance. \"A Queerly Joyful Noise\" also explores the potential this queer communal space creates for mobilizing progressive social action.\n\nA proud member of numerous queer choruses, Professor Balen draws from years of firsthand observations, archival research, and extensive interviews to reveal how queer chorus members feel shared vulnerability, collective strength, and even moments of ecstasy when performing. The result is \"A Queerly Joyful Noise\" that will serve as a testament to the power of music, intimately depicting how participation in a queer chorus is more than a pastime, but a meaningful form of protest through celebration.\n\nCritique: A unique and seminal study, \"A Queerly Joyful Noise: Choral Musicking for Social Justice\" is exceptionally informative and extraordinarily well written. An important and primary work of original scholarship, \"A Queerly Joyful Noise\" features sixteen pages of Note, an eight page Bibliogrpahy, and a five page Index.

After years of battling addiction and depression, and coping with the tragic loss of her father at a very early age, Tyra's worst fear had come true. Larry had been shot down over the Laotian jungle while flying a top-secret mission, just two weeks before their daughter's second birthday.\n\n\"Where the Water Meets the Sand\" is Tyra Manning personal memoir in which she recounts how she was able to persevere in the face of devastating loss. With courage, love, and determination, she overcame her grief and fulfilled promises she made to Larry before he left for Vietnam. She ultimately earned a doctorate of education from the University of Kansas and became one of the nation's top school superintendents.\n\nWhen Tyra received a call from the air force in 2006, she was able to keep one last promise to Larry. His remains had finally been excavated after thirty-five years, and she was able to honor his wish to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\"Where the Water Meets the Sand\" explores themes of loss, depression, addiction, courage, and love and offers hope to individuals and families who have also dealt with the loss of someone close to them.\n\nCritique: An extraordinary and impressively candid account, \"Where the Water Meets the Sand\" is a compelling read from cover to cover and will prove to be an enduringly popular and valued addition to both community and academic library Contemporary American Biography collections. Thoughtful, thought-provoking, and ultimately inspiring, it should be noted for personal reading lists that \"Where the Water Meets the Sand\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $7.99).\n\nThe Good Bohemian\n\nMichael Holroyd & Rebecca John\n\nBloomsbury Press\n\n175 Fifth Avenue, Suite 315, New York, NY 10010\n\nwww.bloomsbury.com\n\n9781408873625, $35.00, HC, 352pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: Twelve days before her twenty-fourth birthday, on the foggy morning of Saturday 12 January 1901, Ida Nettleship married Augustus John in a private ceremony at St Pancras Registry Office. The union went against the wishes of Ida's parents, who aspired to an altogether more conventional match for their eldest daughter. But Ida was in love with Augustus, a man of exceptional magnetism also studying at the Slade, and who would become one of the most famous artists of his time.\n\nIda's letters to friends, to family and to Augustus reveal a young woman of passion, intensity and wit. They tell of the scandal she brought on the Nettleship family and its consequences; of hurt and betrayal as the marriage evolved into a three-way affair when Augustus fell in love with another woman, Dorelia; of Ida's remarkable acceptance of Dorelia, their pregnancies and shared domesticity; of self-doubt, happiness and despair; and of finding the strength and courage to compromise and navigate her unorthodox marriage.\n\nIda is a naturally gifted writer, and it is with a candor, intimacy and social intelligence extraordinary for a woman of her period that her correspondence opens up her world. Ida John died aged just thirty of puerperal fever following the birth of her fifth son, but in these vivid, funny and sometimes devastatingly sad letters she is startlingly alive on the page; a young woman ahead of her time (almost of our own time) living a complex and compelling drama here revealed for the first time by the woman at its very heart.\n\nCritique: \"The Good Bohemian: The Letters of Ida John\" by experienced biographer Michael Holroyd in collaboration with Rebecca John (who is an London-based artist and granddaughter of Augustus and Ida John.) draws upon such primary materials and resources as the intimate letters from Augustus John's first wife, Ida, thereby revealing the untold and candid story of married life with one of the great artists of the last century. An inherently fascinating read from cover to cover, \"The Good Bohemian\" is exceptionally well organized and presented, making it an ideal and unreservedly recommended addition to both community and academic library Biography collections. It should be noted for personal reading lists that \"The Good Bohemian\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $12.96).\n\nSusan Bethany\n\nReviewer\n\nBonnye's Bookshelf\n\nPsycho-Analysis Khedlar's Story Psychological Thriller of How a True Psychopath is Born - Book One: The Beginning\n\nCatherine Nuza\n\nwww.catherinenuza.com\n\nPublication Consultants\n\nP. O. Box 221974, Anchorage, Alaska 99522-1974\n\nwww.publicationconsultants.com\n\n9781594337291, $17.95, Paperback\n\n9781594337307 $9.99, e-book, 242 pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: Khedlar is an adult as this thriller begins. He takes you through the present with frequent flashbacks to prior parts of his life. As the book begins the story he weaves is straightforward, but as the story moves along, you can see and be as fooled by life events as he is. His bizarre childhood is horrible, but not enough to turn him into the psychopath he becomes, but the threads start there. The reader moves from reality to questioning what reality is to reality that conflicts with any previous reality, and only at the end does the reader finally understand how the threads that connect us to clear reality can be utterly deceptive and mind breaking. Even the reader gets lost in what's real. It's not that Khedlar's experience causes the reader to end up sympathetic to what Khedlar does, but the reader, starting with no understanding of the psychopath, can gain a bit of understanding how the mind can be removed from normal to psychopath\n\nCritique: Catherine Nuza has written many words to replace what a short chapter in a non-fiction book could provide in knowledge. In doing so, she takes the reader through not only the surface experience of how the mind can be brought to ruin but also the opportunity to share experientially Khedlar's views as the reader moves through the book. The experience of reading the book adds depth to the surface knowledge of a non-fiction chapter, instead becoming a virtual reality. For the mental health uninitiated this can be a disturbing book. The work is amazing in what it has to offer even if disturbing. I highly recommend this book for academic and community libraries.\n\nHomestead Girl: The View From Here\n\nChantelle Pence\n\nwww.ChantellePence.com\n\nCopper River Press\n\nP. O. Box 956, Slana, Alaska 99586\n\n9780692773642, $TBA pbk / $9.99 Kindle amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: Homestead Girl is a memoir of Chantelle Pence, whose parents brought her to Alaska as a young child, where she grew up on an original homestead. The memoir essentially covers her adult life while raising a family with occasional flashbacks to earlier times. The part of Alaska where she lives is seriously remote: Slana (population 147) near Tok (population 1,258) in the eastern part of central Alaska. It is an Ahtna Native area where her family settled and became part of the area. She has experienced feeling an occasional outsider among the Natives where she and her family were in the minority. She went through youthful feelings of guilt as having somehow been responsible for problems today's Natives face. The environment includes Mt. Sanford, a jaw-droppingly beautiful, snow-covered mountain, visible in her remote setting. It is 2,000 feet higher than Mt. Rainier in Washington State. Pence grows up transplanted and lives her life in true Alaskan style. She and her Native spouse raise three children. Resilient, when the local schools closed, they moved temporarily to Anchorage so their children could attend school. The telling of her first son's suicide is a haunting reminder of the tale of too many Natives in this state. In her remote home, running water indoors is a later-in-life luxury. Through it all, Pence's sensitivity to nature all around her is touching, though not surprising. Her description of following her husband's trap line alone and discovering a beautiful lynx trapped is especially Alaskan and poignant.\n\nCritique: Chanelle Pence chose to write her memoir in short essays grouped into three sections: The Ancestors, The People, The Place. Her prose is poetic and her observations inspiring. She has the combination of connection to people regardless of who they are, a sensitivity to nature, and a realistic view of life. That combination gives her an amazing sense of gentle strength that comes across to the reader. The essay approach, nonetheless, lets her power punch her messages in ways that provide the reader time to ruminate on some of the essays, something that's helpful to gain the full impact of the words. I highly recommend Homestead Girl: The View From Here for libraries with Alaskan themes and for community libraries everywhere.\n\nBonnye Matthews, Reviewer\n\nwww.booksbybonnye.com\n\nBuhle's Bookshelf\n\nThe North End Revisited\n\nJohn Paskievich\n\nUniversity of Manitoba Press\n\n301 St. John's College, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, R3T 2M5\n\nwww.uofmpress.ca\n\n9780887557972, $39.95, PB, 240pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: The Canadian city of Winnipeg's North End is one of North America's iconic city neighborhoods and a place where its city's unique character and politics have been forged. First built when Winnipeg was the \"Chicago of the North\", the North End is the great Canadian melting pot, where First Nations and Old World immigrants cross the boundaries of ethnicity, class, and culture. It is a world of babas in babushkas and onion-dome churches, but also of poverty and resilience. Like New York's Lower East Side, the North End is also the place which forged its city's political identity of resistance and revolt.\n\nJohn Paskievich grew up in Winnipeg's North End, and for the last forty years he has photographed its people and its spirit. Paskievich's films (many of which were made for the National Film Board of Canada), follow the lives of different outsiders, from Slovakian Roma to stutterers.\n\nIn \"The North End Revisited\" Paskievich brings together many of the photographs his now classic book The North End (2007) and adds 80 additional images to present a deep and poignant picture of a special community. Texts by critics Stephen Osborne and Alison Gilmour and film scholar George Melnyk explore the different aspects of Paskievich's work, and add context from Winnipeg's history and culture.\n\nCritique: An extraordinary photographic study, \"The North End Revisited\" is an inherently fascinating volume from first page to last. This compendium of captioned black-and-white photos is unreservedly recommended for personal, professional, community, and academic library Canadian History collections in general, and Canadian Photography supplemental studies lists in particular.\n\nLegendary Lumber\n\nJoe Orlando, Tom Zappala, Ellen Zappala, authors\n\nPeter E.

Whether it is a thin-handled weapon built for bat speed or a hefty war club crafted for durability, the bat is the baseball player's most customized piece of equipment.\n\nFor each player featured in \"Legendary Lumber\", readers will find both a narrative highlighting a significant offensive accomplishment, as well as the story about the bat itself. They will learn about the interesting characteristics of each gamer along with specific player ordering habits, the distinct bat preparation and relative scarcity of the gamers featured.\n\nThese bat stories are brought to life with brilliant images and information, and along with the narratives of the players, make for a fascinating and fun read. \"Legendary Lumber\" presents a brief history of the baseball bat, and tips about collecting professional model bats. The players selected represent a cross section of baseball history, from the early days to the present-Nap Lajoie, Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente, Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and the ultra-popular stars of the post-1980 period such as Cal Ripken, Jr., and Derek Jeter. From stick magicians like Keeler to Suzuki and all of the greats in between, there is something here for everyone.\n\nCritique: Beautifully and profusely illustrated from cover to cover, \"Legendary Lumber: The Top 100 Player Bats in Baseball History\" is a remarkably impressive compendium of detailed information that is extraordinarily well organized and presented. An absolutely 'must read' for all dedicated baseball fans, \"Legendary Lumber\" is unreservedly and whole heartedly recommended for personal, community, and academic library Sports History collections in general, and Baseball history supplemental studies reading lists in particular.\n\nInfluencing Hemingway\n\nNancy W.

Hemingway's personal relationships and experiences influenced the content of his fiction, while the progression of places where the author chose to live and work shaped his style and rituals of writing. Whether revisiting the Italian front in \"A Farewell to Arms\", recounting a Pamplona bull run in \"The Sun Also Rises\", or depicting a Cuban fishing village in \"The Old Man and the Sea\", setting played an important part in Hemingway's fiction. The author also drew on real people, including parents, friends, and fellow writers, among others, to create memorable characters in his short stories and novels.\n\nIn \"Influencing Hemingway: The People and Places That Shaped His Life and Work\", Nancy W. Sindelar (a board member of the Ernest Hemingway Foundation of Oak Park) introduces the reader to the individuals who played significant roles in Hemingway's development as both a man and as an artist -- as well as the environments that had a profound impact on the author's life. In words and photos, readers will see images of Hemingway the child, the teenager, and the aspiring author -- as well as the troubled legend dealing with paranoia and fear.\n\n\"Influencing Hemingway\" begins with Hemingway's birth and early influences in Oak Park, Illinois, followed by his first job as a reporter in Kansas City. Sindelar then recounts Hemingway's experiences and adventures in Italy, France, Spain, Key West, Florida, and Cuba, all of which found their way into his writing. \"Influencing Hemingway\" concludes with an analysis of the events that preceded the author's suicide in Idaho and reflects on the influences critics had on his life and work.\n\nThough much has been written about the life and work of the Nobel prize-winning author, \"Influencing Hemingway\" is the first publication to carefully document in photographs and letters the individuals and locales that inspired him. Featuring more than 60 photos, many of which will be new to the general and academic reader, and unguarded statements from personal letters to and from his parents, lovers, wives, children, and friends, this unique biography allows readers to see Hemingway from a new perspective.\n\nCritique: Extraordinarily well researched, written, organized and presented, \"Influencing Hemingway: The People and Places That Shaped His Life and Work\" is a seminal work that is impressively informed and informative. An absolutely essential and core addition to both community and academic library collections in general, and Ernest Hemingway supplemental academic studies lists in particular, it should be noted for students and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"Influencing Hemingway\" is also available in a paperback edition (9781538102404, $16.95) and in a digital book format (Kindle, $9.99).\n\nWillis M.

An authority on the occult after years of rigorous training, John Silence is more interested in curing a home of an ancient haunting than in curing a head of the common cold.

Born in Leucate, Aude, France, he was the son of artist painter Georges-Daniel de Monfreid and knew Paul Gauguin as a child. De Monfreid was famous for his travels in the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa coast from Tanzania to Aden, Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula and Suez, that he sailed in his various expeditions as adventurer, smuggler and gunrunner (during which he said he more than once escaped the Royal Navy coast-guards cutters).\n\nA nobleman, writer, and adventurer De Monfreid lived by his own account \"a rich, restless, magnificent life\" as one of the great travelers of his or any age. Infamous as well as famous, his name is inextricably linked to the Red Sea and the raffish ports between Suez and Aden in the early years of the twentieth century. De Monfreid had a long life of many adventures around the Horn of Africa where he dodged pirates as well as the authorities.\n\nIn \"Adventures of a Hashish Smuggler\", De Monfreid, who was not particularly law-abiding by nature and was essentially a professional gunrunner, tells the story of his one foray into the world of hashish smuggling during the 1920s. The source of the hashish was Greece, where hemp was openly grown. The market was Egypt, where the British government had banned the popular drug.\n\nWhen De Monfreid got the notion of going to Greece to purchase hashish to smuggle into Egypt, he didn't even know what hashish looked like. De Monfreid arranged to have 600 kilos of hashish brought from Greece to Marseilles and then into Djibouti, a French colony. From there, he sailed with it in his own \"boutre\" or dhow and a loyal crew of natives (assembled when he had run the pearl-diving operation) up the Red Sea to Suez, from where the shipment was carried on to Cairo by camel caravan. Along the way de Monfreid had several close calls and met a number of colorful characters.\n\nShortly after de Monfreid's venture, the Greek monarchy was turned out and the Second Hellenic Republic was declared. Under strong pressure and with economic inducements from Great Britain, the new Greek government outlawed the production of hashish.\n\nCritique: Originally published in 1935 and now brought back into print for the benefit of a whole new generation of appreciative readers, \"Adventures of a Hashish Smuggler\" is an extraordinary account that is an inherently fascinating read from cover to cover.

From millions of comic books fans of the 1960s through billions of moviegoers around the globe, Stan Lee has touched more people than almost any person in the history of popular culture.\n\nIn \"Stan Lee: The Man behind Marvel\", biographer and cultural historian Bob Batchelor offers an eye-opening look at this iconic visionary, a man who created (with talented artists) many of history's most legendary characters. In this energetic and entertaining biography, Batchelor explores how Lee capitalized on natural talent and hard work to become the editor of Marvel Comics as a teenager. After toiling in the industry for decades, Lee threw caution to the wind and went for broke, co-creating the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Hulk, Iron Man, the X-Men, the Avengers, and others in a creative flurry that revolutionized comic books for generations of readers. Marvel superheroes became a central part of pop culture, from collecting comics to innovative merchandising, from superhero action figures to the ever-present Spider-Man lunchbox.\n\nBatchelor examines many of Lee's most beloved works, including the 1960s comics that transformed Marvel from a second-rate company to a legendary publisher. This book reveals the risks Lee took to bring the characters to life and Lee's tireless efforts to make comic books and superheroes part of mainstream culture for more than fifty years.\n\n\"Stan Lee: The Man behind Marvel\" not only reveals why Lee developed into such a central figure in American entertainment history, but brings to life the cultural significance of comic books and how the superhero genre reflects ideas central to the American experience. Candid, authoritative, and utterly absorbing, this is a biography of a man who dreamed of one day writing the Great American Novel, but ended up doing so much more -- changing American culture by creating new worlds and heroes that have entertained generations of readers.\n\nCritique: Impressively informed and informative, exceptionally well written, organized and presented, Stan Lee: The Man behind Marvel\" is an extraordinary biographer that is a 'must read' for the legions of Stan Lee fans.

At all times \"Vladimir Burtsev and the Struggle for Free Russia\" sets Burtsev's life in the wider context of Russian and European history of the period.\n\n\"Vladimir Burtsev and the Struggle for a Free Russia\" offers insights into such topics such as European police collaboration, European prison systems, international diplomatic relations of the time and Russia's relationship with Europe specifically.\n\nOf special note is the extensive use of original archival research and previously untranslated Russian source material that are also deftly incorporated throughout the text.\n\nCritique: A truly impressive work of original and seminal scholarship, \"Vladimir Burtsev and the Struggle for a Free Russia\" is a a critically important study that will be appreciated by all historians of modern Russia and the Russian Revolution upon which it is based.

It's existed since the beginning of time in prehistoric cave paintings, ancient gods and tribal rituals. It lives on today - not just in the sports mascots and cartoon characters we see everywhere, but in stage plays, art galleries, serious literature, performance art - and among furry fans who bring their make-believe characters to life digitally, on paper, or in the carefully crafted fursuits they wear to become the animals of their imagination.\n\nIn Furry Nation, author Joe Strike shares the very human story of the people who created furry fandom, the many forms it takes - from the joyfully public to the deeply personal - and how Furry transformed his own life.\n\nCritique: Furry Nation: The True Story of America's Most Misunderstood Subculture lives up to its title as a fascinating study of a fandom subculture centered on anthropomorphic animals. To stereotype all \"furries\" as sexual fetishists is to ignore the prevalence of anthropomorphic animals in human culture, from cave paintings to animated movies to graphic novels and newspaper comic strips. Furry Nation offers an honest, candid glimpse into all aspects of American furdom, from comics and conventions to real-life \"fursuits\" and stage plays - and yes, the sexual fetishes that some (but not all!) anthropomorphic enthusiasts find pleasurable. Highly recommended.\n\nThe Toad of Dawn\n\nOctavio Rettig Hinojosa\n\nDivine Arts Media\n\nwww.divineartsmedia.com\n\n9781611250466, $18.95, PB, 192pp, www.amazon.com\n\nSynopsis: Dr. Octavio Rettig Hinojosa is a Mexican doctor who works with the sacred medicine 5-MeO-DMT found in the secretions of the Sonoran Desert Toad (Bufo Alvarius).\n\nPart autobiography, part introduction to entheogens and visionary substances, \"The Toad of Dawn: 5-MeO-DMT and the Rising of Cosmic Consciousness\" by Dr. Hinojosa gives an overview of the history, use, and the benefits of the toad medicine, and reveals how it can be used to initiate people on a spiritual path.\n\nIn the pages of \"The Toad of Dawn\" Dr. Hinojosa shows that 5meO-DMT derived from the secretion of the Sonoran Desert Toad is the most profound, most healing entheogen available, even more so than Ayahuasca, LSD, DMT, Psilocybin etc. \"Dr. Hinojosa thinks of it as the Master of all entheogens, the one thing that brings someone closest to God, the Divine Source, to the big meaning behind all, and declares it to be the most powerful healer on this planet.\n\nCritique: Exceptionally well written, organized and presented, \"The Toad of Dawn: 5-MeO-DMT and the Rising of Cosmic Consciousness\" will be of special and particular interest to students of psychotropic substances upon the human brain. An inherently fascinating and impressively informative read, \"The Toad of Dawn\" is especially recommended for academic library Ethnogenic Substances collections and supplemental studies lists.

While many of these examples make headline news today they also contradict reality, the state of things as they exist. It's also a denial of absolute truth, the theme of Randy Alcorn's newest book, \"Truth: A Bigger View of God's Word.\"\n\nIn this release Randy pens two hundred, one-page meditations that take readers into God's Word to look for truth because God's Word is anchored in truth and never changes, unlike secular societies view of truth. The devotions, numbered one through two-hundred, are concise and take only minutes to read. Each reading begins with a Scripture verse that sets the theme for a short reading and concludes with an inspirational quote.\n\nFor example, Day 40's reading features a theme of trust. Scripture is from Proverbs 3: 5-6, \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.\"\n\nThe brief devotion reminds readers, \"God welcomes our prayers\" which are reinforced by faith and trust in the Lord, while understanding the outcome is in God's hands. Our part is to pray and submit to God's teaching and guidance even in the most difficult of circumstances.\n\nCharles Spurgeon's quote, \"...faith's rare wisdom enables us to march on in the dark with infallible accuracy, since she places her hand in that of her Great Guide,\" completes this reading.\n\nOther readings focus on belief, Satan's lies, Christian's lack of motivation, spiritual amnesia, temptation, the spiritual family, Heaven, God's grace, truth, sexual immorality and much more.\n\nThe devotions rich biblical teachings feature concepts of reliable truth that leave no room for relativism, a belief that considers truth in light of current knowledge, behaviors and secular morality.\n\nIf you long for a transforming truth that combats feelings and circumstances, a view that detects the deceits of an increasingly secular society, \"Truth: A Bigger View of God's Word\" belongs on your bookshelf. It's a book that equips readers to recognize absolute truth and find their \"place in God's plan.\"\n\nLoving Moments: 59 Inspirational Stories of the Many Faces of Love (Divine Moments) Compiled & Edited by Yvonne Lehman\n\nGrace Publishing\n\nPO Box 1233, Broken Arrow, OK 74013-1233\n\n9781604950298, $12.99, http://grace-publishing.com\n\n\"Loving Moments,\" number eight in Yvonne Lehman's \"Moments\" compilation series, features \"59 Inspirational Stories of the many Faces of Love.\" The books royalties, as in eight other books in the \"Moments\" series, are dedicated to Franklin Graham's evangelical organization, Samaritans Purse.\n\nPacific Northwest authors, Terri Elders, Beverly Hill McKinney, Lydia Harris and Colleen R.

For example, Lydia's story, \"A Valentine for Jesus, my Bridegroom,\" (pg. 27) features a theme of valentines, hearts and God's love that inspire readers to examine their commitment to the Lord in light of His sacrifice. For example, is your heart devoted to praise, thankfulness and patience or is your heart divided, self-centered and unforgiving?\n\nTerri Elders narrative, \"All Those Years Ago,\" (pg. 85) is about life-milestones, time-capsules a son's love and their shared love of music.

While that was bad enough, \"...that wasn't the worst of it.\" Eight high school students had committed suicide since September and soon four more would follow garnering the high school and town the headline: \"Masonville Suicide Saga.\"\n\nThe suicides and move had made life more difficult for Owen who already had to cope with his mother's drinking. Still, he had earned a place on the high school's track team, met Jess, his soon-to-be-girlfriend and was surrounded by a group of great new friends even though they couldn't understand why he never invited them home.\n\nWhen Owen unexpectedly met a weird old man in the woods behind the school who promised to tell him what was causing the suicide epidemic if Own drank water drawn from an underground water source, he did. The water had tasted normal going down and then sudden pain \"hijacked his gut with the worst stomachache ever and his head throbbed!\" Overwhelmed with the pain, Owens's last fear-laden thought was \"I don't want to be number thirteen!\"\n\nSoon Owen will see chains around his mother, friends, teachers and classmate's necks with braids that protrude from the back of their heads labeled humiliation, shame, guilt and more. He will also see other dark beings like demoniacs he identifies as Creepers and angelic beings he's convinced are Warrior angels. Yet Own is the only one who sees these things.\n\nThus, begins a darkly sinister narrative of demonic activity and supernatural illusions in a fictionalized account of good versus evil with human souls as the prize.\n\nAfter reading a third of \"The Delusion,\" I thought the story very dark and wondered if teens should read it. Until the introduction of Ray Anne who has no shackles, chains or cords, who instead emits \"a brilliant, golden glow\" and Owen sets out to learn her secret and the story changes.\n\nThis well-drawn story elaborates on and reveals how Satan entraps people with negative feelings, experiences and behaviors. Gallier writes from a biblical perspective about a thought-provoking spiritual realm with a complex and gripping tale that carries a powerful punch. Fans of Ted Dekker and Frank Peretti will enjoy this action-packed story.\n\nGail Welborn, Reviewer\n\nhttps://plus.google.com/112878134284824899387\n\nGrace's Bookshelf\n\nBorn\n\nJon Boisvert\n\nwww.jonboisvert.com\n\nAirlie Press\n\n9780989579957 $16.00 amazon.com\n\nI love this guy. I nearly called him up to tell him. Boisvert's poems are described as \"surreal\" but they are more than real to me. Stark and wry - Magritte's paintings are as close a visual that comes to mind. When I read Boisvert, poetry landscapes become a kinetic tapestry of wonder, loss and love. The only way to make sense of all this, he seems to say, is to turn objects of the world to a different dynamic. I don't know anyone who's doing it better than this poet. The question is: How does strange become do beautiful? Why is it that mysteries unfolded here are so clear? How does simplicity reveal depth? These questions have no answers but they live for me with the great staying power of this book. Everything on these pages delineates something left behind - not apparent but pretext and context, the nature of suffering, sometimes to the point of humor. Here is full truth. I want to tell the author these poems are understood.\n\nPoet\n\nThere's a poet in town who's better than me.\n\nI hear him on the esplanade give directions\n\nto a tourist. Left, right. It sounds so\n\nbeautiful that I stop him, too. What do you\n\nwant, he says beautifully. Just speak more, I\n\nplead, say anything, count to ten. Look at\n\nthat, he says after he's done, pointing to ten\n\nflamingos gathered at the water's edge.\n\nThank you, I say, standing under ten black\n\nballoons.\n\nThe Drowning Boy's Guide To Water by Cameron Barnett. Autumn House Press. 92 pages.\n\nSome poets say things others dare not say. The good news is that Barnett does it significantly. He hollows out American tragedies, filling them with hard truths made permanent with poetry and story. Race is the issue and the shaping circumstances described here are visceral. Passion and meaning memorialize blacks who have been sacrificed over the years. His stories are his teachings; and his teachings show a promise unfulfilled - yet by the act of art, suddenly we believe we're finding a way out. How does this happen? Barnett takes our troubled times and breaks them down to individuals and events mandating our best attention. He generates, with perfection, language and tone that fit the victory of bravery for black people who were victimized, by expanding memory to durability. Poetry's metabolism is raised in this book with honesty and integrity.\n\nBlack Locusts\n\nThere are no gardens in my neighborhood,\n\njust three black locust trees\n\nin my backyard.\n\nAll spring, cream-white petals\n\nblooming like baby teeth,\n\nnectar drooling from the center.\n\nIn the summer they stand\n\nas if for a portrait,\n\nlined up like siblings\n\nin the corner of my window.\n\nI grow fond of how they bend\n\ntoward each other.\n\nBy autumn they droop\n\nand withdraw like moody teens,\n\nleaving all their trash behind them.\n\nThey are the children I pray every night to have.\n\nIn western Pennsylvania\n\nthree seasons go by in a day.\n\nI'm used to it.\n\nI take the leaf blower to their bases,\n\na stay-at-home father cleaning out\n\nand rearranging rooms while empty-nesting,\n\nwhistling all the while.\n\nLater, when winter comes,\n\nI watch kudzu creep up their trunks,\n\nwrapping itself over every inch,\n\nstealing away the last bits on sun.\n\nBefore the first snowfall I'll sharpen a hatchet,\n\nread up on girdling, stand at the window,\n\nand wonder which sort of death they deserve.\n\nAdvice from the Lights\n\nStephen Burt\n\nGraywolf Press\n\n250 Third Avenue North, Suite 600, Minneapolis, MN 55401\n\nwww.graywolfpress.org\n\n9781555977894 $16.00 pbk / $9.99 Kindle amazon.com\n\nIn the poem \"Palinode with Playmobil Figurines\" Burt writes of a mythical family, \"...None of them know how low/ the imagination recedes...\" and then we have a whole book to prove the opposite. Burt's imagination is optimized by his humor and glamorous idiosyncrasies. Each poem is a way of lambasting conformity and replacing it with trust for the fanciful. Recurring themes are we will not be heard, or; what we wish is not worthwhile, or; we have few alternatives; etc. but these are merely conventions so Burt's poems can prove them untrue. \"Advice or Prayer for Airports\" says, \"...Let the technology work/ until it fails// Until it is free/ to rust...\" but instead of annihilation the poem proposes, \"...We should protect one another...\"\n\nAnd so curiously and courageously Burt keeps saving us by making poems that are small cultural changes - one device is to make a prophetic statement and wrap it in personal detail then take a hit for the team by being the fall guy for the poem. In \"My 1983\" the poem ends with a teacher's admonition: \"... We'd like you to think/ about what might be interesting to your friends, not just about what's interesting to you.\"\n\nPoems about the Speaker's young years are funny and sweet even though Burt is always making a fist - but don't be scared - when it opens only magic silk scarves and white doves fly out.\n\nAfter Callimachus\n\nSo reactionaries and radicals complain\n\nthat I have no proprietary mission,\n\nno project that's all mine;\n\ninstead, I am like a child flipping Pogs\n\nor building with Minecraft bricks, although I'm past forty.\n\nTo them I say: keep rolling logs\n\nfor one another, but don't waste my time\n\nimposing your inappropriate ambition:\n\nmarathon runners and shock jocks gain\n\nby going as far as they can, but the sublime,\n\nthe useful, and the beautiful in poetry\n\nare all inversely correlated\n\nwith size: shorter means sweeter.

First check out the blurbs on the back. Two are from \"Some guy Michael owed $5\" and the other \"CL's Cousin.\" If that doesn't give you pause, try to imagine two guys writing one poem, and then another poem, swapping lines, like Click and Clack or Cheech and Chong, but this time with intelligence, sophistication and a consummate knowledge of language (the high jinx kind.) Never mind sanity. (It's way overrated.) Strap yourself to the bed post and read this. It's really funny. From \"BIRD (BRAIN) SONG,\" \"Just because it rains doesn't mean you washed/ your car...\" from \"SATELLITES,\" \"Don't take offense at me saying this, /but your brain has been removed and replaced/ with circuits, space jelly, and an alien clam...\" From \"PINK MOONS AND BLACK DOGS,\" \"I can't remember the name/ but there was a song I'd never/ heard playing when you left...\" From \"I TOLD YOU,\" \"The world is burning. Throwing hundred-dollar/ bills into the flames won't put out the fire...\"\n\nI promise I haven't used them all up. There's plenty more for you. The trouble is we'll never know who wrote which line by whom. Here's a poem written by Bledsoe and Gushue or maybe Gushue and Bledsoe.\n\nYou Deserve Better\n\nThe queen's not hiring any new fools - not even\n\nto polish her crown. So I've got on these tights\n\nfor nothing. Tell me why I was born to see\n\nthe universe in a swirl of hair, time clogging\n\nup the drain. Something smells like cinnamon,\n\nand I can't seem to set it ablaze. I'm drowning\n\nin love. Please don't touch me. Please don't stop\n\ntouching me. I hate everything about you\n\nthat could ever pity me for hating everything\n\nabout this. The best views are the ones\n\nthat make you the most dizzy. You, for example,\n\nwhen I was watching you sleep. You weren't\n\nthe stars. You were the empty space the stars\n\nwanted to fill.\n\nKilling Summer\n\nSarah Browning\n\nSibling Rivalry Press\n\nhttp://siblingrivalrypress.bigcartel.com\n\n9781943977406 $14.93\n\nSarah Browning is a social activist; and poetry is a social action that stays. The book is a portrait of time spent in Italy reconciling a marriage, a compassionate look at our everyday struggles, and there are also poems that hark back to the vagaries of college days - coming-of-age - but what I like best is the way Sarah Browning tells us what a woman is. In \"The great Books, or All Theory and No Practice\" she ends, \"... We didn't care about size. We would have done with/kisses, vague gropings in the woods, a book to tell us/how to love the boy in the world, the father and the land./The book of longing for each of us still writing. \"\n\nAn ekphrastic poem I like is \"Photo of a woman with nipples and a cigarette: \"Is she baring or bared? //The flame is a nipple. I shake//when I see it. The nipples wing //the woman into me. They hum//in the kitchen late at night.//I am red wine in the glass.//I am a crumpled napkin//on the table. I am the flame.//I am traveling to the dark lips.//The flame will soon expire.//No, it won't.\"\n\nBecause Browning is a rebel and makes change in society Bigtime, her sense and sensibility about 'the personal' is like being invited into a room no one has gone and where she doesn't hide. She writes of love and friendship along with social commentary but how she does this makes all the difference. Each line in her poetry deserves the one before and the one after. This instructs the reader to keep moving - game on - there's more ahead - we want to stay with the story because Browning knows how to unfold and reveal, gradually gracefully, making emotional connections stanza to stanza. Motion is her strong point and this is led by feeling, exposed from image. I could describe her poetic style as a slow unleashing, or a gradual revealing. This is why there's no way we would turn away from her. The world of words shows who we are: light, heat, sorrow, song. It's all here. She's on the A team.\n\nMore and More\n\nThe trick is not to be so satisfied\n\nwith more and more of everything\n\nthat feeds a grievous hunger.\n\nBruce Weigl\n\nI can't seem to account for my heart -\n\nenormous crow on the telephone pole\n\ncawing three times across the hidden\n\npart of the neighborhood - alleys,\n\ngarages, cars on blocks, spilled\n\nchicken bones and diapers.\n\nThe church bells are starting up.\n\nIn the dream, an old love appeared\n\nand called to me. I couldn't reach him,\n\neven the dream a cliche, each door\n\na false beginning.\n\nThe church bells play \"America the Beautiful.\"\n\nThe mourning dove echoes a big wind\n\nin the oak tree. Somewhere, as ever, a siren -\n\nno Sunday morning peace. I outstare\n\nthe neighbor's cat. I think there is no god\n\nlolling in the clouds, enjoying\n\nthe praise. So I beg forgiveness\n\nof the cat, the overgrown garden.\n\nThere will always be two stories.\n\nMine will be the bad dream,\n\ncliche, tut-tut.\n\nHow to Prove a Theory\n\nNicole Tong\n\nwww.nicoletong.com\n\nWashington Writers' Publishing House\n\nwww.washingtonwriters.org\n\n9781941551134 $15.98 70 pages\n\nWell-structured words and clear thoughts collaborate to make beautiful declarations. These are poems of many theories. Among others, \"Inaccurate Theory\" where the speaker becomes one with nature; \"Wistful Theory\" about the losses of the earth; \"Pink Pill Theory\" is about human perception; \"Some Theory\" is the hope for belonging, especially to \"place' - but what is a Theory? The dictionary tells us theory is \"a system of ideas intended to explain something based on general principles outside of the thing to be explained.\" What a perfect definition for poetry! Tong begins with an emotional supposition and then explores this with image and feeling. Her tone is meditative, her language always chosen not for applause lines, but to say something the best way possible. Reading Tong we forget life's chaos and only care for her yearnings that are so well said; and Tong is not afraid to be quiet. This really works on the page.\n\nIntimacy Theory\n\nfor John\n\nIn light of the river, the way it turns.\n\nFirst a gathering of ice. Then snow\n\nbuilding a false start of the river's edge.\n\nTell me what's empirical: winter at my back\n\nall season, snow turns to rain in my hair.\n\nTell me how many times today my body has\n\nworked against itself. Thinking of you is\n\nsomething like breath. A slow release of time\n\nbuilt up in my mouth. When there are no words,\n\nno idiom will do: tie the knot, tie one on,\n\ncut ties, tongue-tied. You are anything\n\nbut an obstruction. You are everything\n\nif not each moment before. O\n\ntransitivity. O verb waiting to be.\n\nStarshine & Clay\n\nKamilah Aisha Moon\n\nFour Way Books\n\nhttps://fourwaybooks.com/site\n\n9781935536956 $15.95\n\nMoon writes anthems, restoring life from ruin, memorializing those exploited, displaced, murdered. Each poem's a jewel for those lynched, hunted, killed. The massacre at Emmanuel AME Charleston, South Carolina 6.17. 15 is titled \"Felicia Sanders's Granddaughter, 5:\" \"...Grandma was on top of me, warm. /Perfume, powder, sweat and smoke/stung my nose. I felt her heart/beating fast, so fast like after I run/but there was nowhere to run...\" and in the poem \"Samaria Rice, Tamir's Mother\" \"... Broken hearts bound/by yellow tape. Done living at this address of can't, /of never again, of not sorry for our loss. /Feels pointless, let me live the whole truth now/that my family has been shattered...\" Literature triumphs when one has to recuperate from its force. When does Kamilah Aisha Moon make a difference? Whenever she writes a poem; there's no high fat content in these words. It's learned truth, muscular and viable.\n\nIt all works because of technique. Moon begins each poem a different way. Her entries are like entering a room with great expectations. Her poems come from a mind softened many nights in reading, before the writing occurs. It's a learned work with managed strategies of good craft as carriage. Poets who try for levels of persuasion don't persuade. Poets like Moon who rely on the radical facts of our humanity, and describe them well, produce a physical as well as mental response. Some poems here make my heart beat fast. This heroic writing is in the spirit of Nina Simone's Mississippi Goddamn!\n\nStaten Island Ferry Ride\n\nBoarding the boats, we risk\n\nMiddle Passage riptides\n\nstill rolling in,\n\nbadged sharks\n\nin blue.\n\nToday we board to march\n\nfor Eric Garner.\n\nHooked by hysterical\n\narms, he thrashed\n\nlike a caught thing\n\non the sidewalk.\n\nWe roil past Lady Liberty.\n\nDraped in a dingy gown,\n\nher smudged face\n\nstares back.\n\nWeeds grasp\n\nher hem.\n\nAmerican Software\n\nHenry Crawford\n\nhttp://henrycrawfordpoetry.com\n\nCW Books\n\n9781625492319 $19.00 89 pages\n\nCrawford's work is gloriously original and heartbreakingly truthful. He sometimes creates new complex presentations with experimental punctuation and page aesthetics. This requires equilibrium and dexterity keeping the words intact. Invention's circumstance is a tricky matter, but Crawford knows stories become special events by surprising content with form. Crawford has a canny ability to get into the psyche of personalities, having them explain themselves - Lyndon Johnson, Lee Harvey Oswald, Kurt Cobain, Richard Nixon - the monologues don't call for judgment; this is the quality to praise; one feels that these unlikely candidates get a natural strength from their own words. They make no apologies and merely tell what powered their lives. Poems about the Speaker's young life show some fierce hearts and inhumane characters, but the poems don't shirk their duties to transform. This is a luminous collection where the poet takes big chances interspersing mechanical detail, like mental notes, within the line. By this the author shows us who he is - someone willing to reorient words to challenge meaning, and with more than a little courage, trust the consequences.\n\nFour Small Stories\n\n1.

In the poem \"Tools,\" she writes, \"A woman's body has everything in it/to save her life//if you must/use your legs as raft/heel as hammer/ teeth as machete//monthly blood as healing salve/milk for building//breasts as shelters/learn to breathe//use your locks to suture every wound/learn to scream//learn to scream/learn to speak//learn to live/within the smallest muscle of your heart.\"\n\n\"This Pure Light\" is a five-page eight- stanza poem, telling the story of a son who needs a kidney, interwoven with the conflicts all mothers face, that they not may not be worthy of their child's life.
