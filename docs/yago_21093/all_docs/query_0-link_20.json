        "text": "Throughout the ages, many women have tried to make an impact on the world, many without success. There are those, however, who are able to break the bonds that held women to certain positions in society. Some of these women who were able to break from tradition made an immense impact on the society of their time and upon history in general. One of these amazing women is Catherine de' Medici, an Italian woman who eventually became Queen of France.\n\nCatherine de' Medici was born to the Medici family of Florence in 1519. Her parents were Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino and Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne. Both of her parents died shortly after her birth leaving her as the sole heiress to all of the possessions and holdings of the Medici family. After her parents' deaths, she had no close relatives to care for her. Her father's distant relative Cardinal Guilio de' Medici came to Florence to take control of the Florentine government and to care for the young Catherine.\n\nIn 1527, when Catherine was eight years old, the Medici palace in Florence was attacked by an angry mob of Florentines. Her relatives who lived in the palace with her decided to flee the palace but they were ordered by the rebellion leaders to leave young Catherine behind, so that they would have a valuable hostage in the future. After young Catherine was taken hostage she was placed in various convents in and around the city. While in these convents she received an education that allowed her to be one of the best-educated women of her time.\n\nWhen the Florentine rebellion was finally crushed by Guilio d'Medici, now Pope Clement VII, she was sent to Rome to reside with him. Once there, her marriage arrangements were made. Clement and King Francis I of France arranged that Catherine was to be married to his second eldest son, Henry of Orleans. Now at age 14, she was described as, \"small and slender, with fair hair, thin and not pretty in face, but with the eyes peculiar to all the Medici\" (Young 393).\n\nHer arrival at the palace in France for the wedding ceremonies was supposedly a time of great celebration. Catherine wanted a great impression on the Royal Court of France. Although short in stature, she wanted to make a grand entrance. In order to do this she consulted a Florentine artisan for help, who had presented her with the first example of the modern high-heeled shoe. Her arrival in France, while wearing these shoes, caused quite a stir.\n\nAfter her marriage to Henry of Orleans, she traveled and saw much of France. King Francis I, now her father-in-law soon realized what a wonderful traveling companion his new daughter-in-law was. Other than Francis, Catherine had not a friend in all of France and was not looked highly upon by the French people, especially the nobles, who called her \"the Italian woman\".\n\nKing Francis' eldest son, the Dauphin Francis, died in 1536, leaving Henry of Orleans as the heir to the French throne. This caused quite a commotion throughout France. The French did not want an Italian woman to become their queen. Many French hoped for Catherine to do something wrong to keep her from ever reaching the throne. Many thought that she would never have children and that her time in there would be short, but between the years 1543 and 1555 Catherine had ten children, three of which died in infancy. Of those that survived three of them, Francis, Charles, and Henry, would later serve as Kings of France.\n\nIn 1547, Catherine's beloved father in law, Francis I died. Her husband of 14 years became King Henry II of France, and Catherine was now the Queen. Catherine's severe unpopularity with the French people became greater than ever. Their new queen was not of royal blood and she was Italian-- not a good combination according to the French.\n\nCatherine's marriage was also not very pleasant. Although she loved him deeply, Henry was more in love with his mistress, Diane de Poitiers, with whom he spent much of his time. What made matters worse, Diane had almost complete control over the weak-minded Henry. Through Henry, Diane de Poitiers gained much influence in the governing of France. This severely bothered Catherine, but she did not cause problems or create a stir. She kept her personal feelings and attitudes to herself.\n\nIn 1559, Catherine's husband died in a tournament accident and her eldest son Francis II came to the throne. Like his father, he was weak of mind. Francis II only ruled for 17 months and upon his death in 1560, Catherine's second son, Charles IX came to the throne at age ten. This allowed Catherine to become Queen Regent of France, and she served as such until Charles IX's death. She also served as Queen Regent for her third son, Henry III.\n\nDuring her reign, Catherine de' Medici faced many problems including the religious wars involving the Huguenots in France and the French hatred toward her. She overcame such obstacles, managed to uphold the power of the monarchy, and protected the claims of the Valois dynasty.\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\n\nBaumgartner, Frederic J. Henry II.
