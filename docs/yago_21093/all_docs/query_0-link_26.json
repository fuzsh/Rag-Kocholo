        "text": "By the summer of 1557 when the first season is set, Catherine and Henry's marriage deteriorated completely. While the two put up a facade of strength, they barely talk to each other. [1]\n\nBut everything changes in the fall of 1557. Eager to keep Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland an ally in the hope of one day taking England, Henry agrees to legitimise Sebastian so that he and Mary may wed and rule France one day. By reverting the line of succession to Sebastian, Henry would strip Francis and the rest of his and Catherine's children of their right to rule. Not only that, he would also finally be able to do away with Catherine and marry his long-time mistress, Diane de Poitiers. [2]\n\nNaturally, Catherine protests against it, but Henry's mind has already been made up. He decides to send her to a convent, but when he realises that the Medici queen has a far reach, he insteads locks her in The Tower to be guarded day and night, at least until he returns from Rome. [2]\n\nUnder considerable pressure from the Medici family, the Pope refuses to see Henry. Since he is unable to get an annulment, he returns to French court with the aim of killing Catherine on the grounds of adultery instead. He has a long line of witnesses, each more unassailable than the last, with the inclusion of Richard Delacroix, his childhood friend and ally. However, Catherine and Henry soon reconcile and the king rethinks his decision to have his wife beheaded. [3]\n\nWhile Catherine focuses on discrediting Sebastian by digging up dirt on his Pagan past, Mary and Sebastian plot Catherine's demise in return, using her past as their weapon. As they learn, Catherine secretly had a love child, Clarissa, with Richard Delacroix. When Henry finds out, Richard is executed and any hope of a settlement between Catherine and Henry is crushed. [3]\n\nCatherine is soon to be beheaded, when the exiled Francis returns to court in order to talk his father out of killing his mother. Nostradamus also returns, with a vision that changes everything once again. He had a vision of a life in which Francis and Mary are happily wed and Francis is alive. Once he tells Catherine, she tells Francis, and he sets out to get Mary back. [4]\n\nFrench court is full of joy at Mary and Francis' Wedding, and even Henry is forgiving. Now that the line of succession has returned to Francis, he has no reason to get rid of Catherine. Their relationship is pacified for now. [4]\n\nA few months later, just as Mary and Francis return from their honeymoon, Henry begins showing signs of madness. When the Archduke and Archduchess of Bohemia come to court to resolve a minor conflict, Henry takes a liking to the Archduchess, and she to him. But as they're making out, he accidentally throws her out of a window. By doing so, he opens the door to the possibility of war with Bohemia. [5]\n\nLuckily, war is avoided, and the incident taken care of, but it wouldn't be the last. [5] Just a few days later, Catherine hears from Lady Kenna, Henry's mistress, that he strangled a prostitute. Then a servant not long after. Catherine asks Henry to have a physician check on him, but he argues that kings don't get ill. [6]\n\nWhen a servant named Penelope is titled Queen of the Bean, she beguiles the king to the point that she secures herself a spot at the king's side for longer than just a day. She even manipulates him into turning against Catherine, so that she is safe from Catherine's wrath and attempts to poison her. [7]\n\nAs Henry begins neglecting his state duties and paying more attention to Penelope, Catherine takes over. She does her best to ensure that Henry's madness is kept under wraps, because she knows the scandal that would ensue if it got out. [8]\n\nBut that doesn't mean she accepts the role that Penelope plays in her every day life. At one point, she calls life with the girl \"untenable\" and devises a plan to get rid of Penelope in a way that won't anger Henry. She enlists Kenna's help in executing the plan and in return promises her a grand reward. [9]\n\nIt works and Henry casts Penelope out of his life forever. [9] Catherine continues ruling on Henry's behalf, keeping generals on her side in case the mercurial king spontaneously decides to invade England. But Henry later summons Catherine and Francis and tells them that he found out a while ago. He hired new generals, loyal only to him, and already sent men to England. [10]\n\nBy spring of 1558, the campaign to retake Calais proves victorious for the French, thanks to the aid of the Duke of Guise's army. The French army returns home, undefeated but depleted. From what it seems, Henry's thirst for England is sated by the victory as he vows to celebrate the men who played a key role in winning, called the \"Heroes of Calais\". [11]\n\nBut in private, he has already begun mobilizing his forces to invade England. When Catherine finds out via her network of spied called The Flying Squad, she informs Francis and Mary and the three brainstorm their next move. Francis is confident he can talk his father out of doing what will inevitably end in needless bloodshed, and while Mary and Catherine say they give him time, they secretly begin plotting to kill the king. [11]\n\nCatherine calls off the poisoning attempt at the last minute, but there is already another plot afoot to assassinate the king, one which increases his paranoia to new highs and endears him to the Duke of Guise, whom he views as his saviour for warning him about the attempt on his life. [11]\n\nHenry's madness reaches a fever pitch when he summons everyone to the courtyard in the middle of the night to watch as he runs his sword through an innocent man. The slaughter sends a message to Francis, Mary, and Catherine that Henry is irredeemable and must be stripped of power. The three decide to stage a coup, but before the plan can be executed, Henry is gravely wounded at a jousting tournament. [12]"
