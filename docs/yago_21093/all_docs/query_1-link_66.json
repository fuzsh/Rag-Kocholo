        "text": "The Serpent Queen, a televised, fictionalised version of Catherine, is worth watching for the joy of seeing the Châteaux of the Loire in all their magnificent glory. Those of Amboise, Chenonceau, Chambord and Villandry enjoy a lot of air time.\n\nThe film makers worked during the pandemic lockdown because they could film in the empty rooms, halls and gardens where Catherine lived. No visitors meant no revenue so the Châteaux were glad of the filming fees and free publicity. Not that they need it. They are already world famous.\n\nWhy the writers saw fit to make it up as they went along instead of sticking to the facts is weird. The real story is so much more interesting.\n\nThe character of Angelica is pure fiction. Why she is there is a mystery. Worse. The writers depict her as having a lesbian affair with Diane de Poitiers no less. Ludicrous.\n\nThey have Catherine say that her husband Henry II was tolerant of the New Religion (Protestantism). No. Staunchly Roman Catholic, he said it was heresy.\n\nHenry died following the marriage of his daughter Elisabeth, not after the marriage of his son the Dauphin Francis to Mary Queen of Scots. And why was Mary in a black wig? She was famous for her red hair. In mourning for her husband she is shown in a white dress. Why? Black was the official colour for mourning in the Valois Court. Anne of Brittany was the first to wear black after the untimely death of her beloved husband Charles VIII. When Jean Clouet painted a portrait of Mary in mourning, she was wearing a white veil over a black dress.\n\nWhat was authentic was Catherine’s fractious relationship with her. Mary was the daughter of a King. Catherine was from a family of money lenders. Catherine once asked Mary why she did not curtsey to the Queen of France. Mary asked her why she did not curtsey to the Queen of Scotland. Worse. Mary adored Diane de Poitiers and often stayed with her at her Chateau near Paris.\n\nEqually authentic was the cruel way Catherine was treated at Court for twenty-five years. She was at best ignored at worse sniggered over. Diane de Poitiers was Queen of France in all but name. She and Catherine are portrayed as being daggers drawn. Not so. Even though Henry and Diane made no effort to hide their obsession with each other, Catherine suffered in dignified silence.\n\nIf Catherine in real life really did turn into Lady Macbeth, given the humiliation she endured, it’s entirely understandable. In fact, although after Henry’s death Catherine could have brought the heavens down on Diane, she didn’t. True she took Château Chenonceau from her but she gave her Chateau Chaumont in exchange. Under the circumstances Catherine was very generous to her usurper.\n\nPost by Pamela (BA History of Art). Artwork by Mark.\n\nRead more about Catherine in these blog posts:"
