Dark Castle Entertainment has set Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Thandie Newton, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges and Idris Elba to star in "RocknRolla," the crime tale Guy Ritchie wrote and is directing.

Production began June 19 in London. Joel Silver is producing with Ritchie, Steve Clark-Hall and Susan Downey. Warner Bros. will distribute.

Story concerns a Russian mobster who orchestrates a crooked land deal, putting millions of dollars up for grabs and attracting all of London's criminal underworld.

The film, budgeted at less than $20 million, will be done in the fast-paced, low-budget style of Ritchie's early films, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels," and "Snatch."
