        "text": "Get updates throughout the day in our Cannes 2000 special report.\n\nCANNES — Producer Joel Silver and director Robert Zemeckis continue to build their Dark Castle Entertainment library on the shoulders of cult horror helmer William Castle. With a three-picture Dark Castle deal in place with Warner Bros., Zemeckis is slated to direct “Macabre,” a $15 million-$20 million remake of the 1958 Castle title.\n\nPic will follow the production of “13 Ghosts,” a remake of the film that Castle directed and produced for Columbia in 1960. Commercials helmer Steven Beck will make his feature-directing debut with “Ghosts,” which begins production July 17.\n\n“Macabre,” like most Dark Castle titles, will be repped internationally by J&M Entertainment, which also handled the label’s debut, the Castle remake “House on Haunted Hill.” Since the original “13 Ghosts” was produced by Col and is part of the studio’s library, however, that remake will be released by Warners domestically and by Columbia TriStar Intl. overseas.\n\nThe remaining titles on Warners’ Dark Castle slate have not been decided, but among the top contenders is a remake of Castle’s “The Tingler.”\n\nGap financing for the Dark Castle titles is provided by Hal Sadoff and Myles Nestel’s MM Media Capital Partners, which also backs titles produced under Silver’s genre label, Zinc Pictures. Helkon Media has an output deal for Dark Castle product in all German media.\n\n“Macabre” will rep a stylistic switch for Zemeckis, who recently wrapped the big-budget films “Cast Away” and “What Lies Beneath.” “Macabre” will be shot in a rough style reminiscent of the films produced by the Dogma 95 filmmakers collective.\n\nHaunted past\n\nDark Castle, launched in early 1999, previously produced last year’s “House on Haunted Hill,” starring Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen. Budgeted at $15 million, the remake has earned $80 million worldwide.\n\nMuch as in the original Castle movies that inspired his company, Silver says gimmicks will play heavily in the production and release of the Dark Castle titles. And, like William Castle — who wasn’t above employing devices such as electric seat buzzers timed to go off at particularly terrifying points of “The Tingler,” or insuring those who bought tickets to “Macabre” against “death by fright”– Silver said he’s not interested in mundane devices like 3-D glasses.\n\n“We’re going to have visual effects no one has seen before,” said Silver, who plans to use “The Matrix” f/x house Manex to provide enhanced frights for “13 Ghosts.” “We want to make very scary movies, and we hope to scare the shit out of people.”\n\nSilver and Zemeckis previously partnered with Richard Donner, Walter Hill and David Giler on HBO’s “Tales From the Crypt” series and its two feature spinoffs.\n\nIn the original “Macabre,” a doctor’s daughter is kidnapped and buried alive, and he is given just five hours to find and rescue her. The producers are now out to writers on the project.\n\nSilver is currently prepping four films for summer production starts. In addition to “13 Ghosts,” he is readying “Exit Wounds” starring Steven Seagal and DMX, which will start shooting July 24; “Swordfish,” starring John Travolta, is slated for an August start; and the first title under the Zinc Pictures label, “Proximity,” starring Rob Lowe and James Coburn, goes into production in June.\n\nAlso in Silver’s pipeline are two sequels to the worldwide hit “The Matrix.”\n\nSilver’s most recent production, “Romeo Must Die,” starring Jet Li, has earned nearly $60 million domestically to date."
