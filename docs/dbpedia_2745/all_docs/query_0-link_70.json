        "text": "Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Thandie Newton, Idris Elba and Chris “Ludacris” Bridges have been cast in RocknRolla, Guy Ritchie‘s return to the caper genre being produced by Joel Silver’s Dark Castle Entertainment.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter says Butler stars as a One Two, a street-smart mobster who has learned to play both sides of the fence, and Wilkinson is playing the lethal head mobster, Lenny Cole, part of London’s old mob regime, which is quickly losing ground to the wealthier foreign mob.\n\nNewton acts as One Two’s love interest, Stella, an accountant with ties to the underworld, and Elba acts as Mumbles, One Two’s partner. Bridges is playing Roman, an American trying to break into the music scene in London.\n\nRitchie wrote the screenplay and is directing the movie, which is set in motion when a Russian mobster orchestrates a crooked land deal and millions of dollars are thrown up for grabs, with all of London’s criminal underworld players wanting in on the action."
