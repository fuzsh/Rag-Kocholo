        "text": "News out of the virtual Cannes market via The Hollywood Reporter has revealed that actress Olivia Munn will star and produce a new action flick titled Replay from The Exchange and Dark Castle Entertainment.\n\nThey’re comparing the film to a mix of John Wick, The Raid, and The Terminator.\n\nReplay is the story of Erin Staffer (Munn), whose husband is kidnapped and murdered. Now, armed only with illegal, bleeding-edge tech and a hopeless plan, Erin must do everything in her power to change the past and save him.\n\nMunn is best known for taking smaller supporting roles in films like X-Men: Apocalypse and The Predator but it sounds like this might be her chance to etch-out an action vehicle for her very own.\n\nThe action film is currently in pre-production stages with Jimmy Loweree writing and directing.\n\nThey’re now seeking international buyers."
