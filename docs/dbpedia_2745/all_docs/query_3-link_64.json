        "text": "Possession horror is on trend this year, and that looks to continue with Judgment of the Dead. THR reports that the upcoming horror movie will star Mohamed Karim and give an Egyptian spin on the possession formula.\n\nKarim will star and produce Judgment of the Dead. Stuart Ford’s AGC will co-produce with Karim’s MK Global Entertainment.\n\nThe actor will play “Dr. Sherif Hawass, a renowned Egyptologist who must save the world, and the woman he loves, after an artifact he unearths releases an ancient evil.”\n\nThomas M. Hewlett wrote the screenplay for Judgement of the Dead based on Karim’s original idea.\n\nInterestingly, Judgment of the Dead was initially announced in 2021, under the title Book of Chaos, as a Dark Castle Entertainment (Orphan, House of Wax) feature. Dark Castle initially launched in 1998 by Joel Silver, Robert Zemeckis and Gilbert Adler and most recently produced Simon Barrett’s directorial debut, Seance, and last year’s Orphan: First Kill.\n\nKarim is a major star in the Middle East and has recently appeared in action films A Score to Settle with Nicolas Cage and A Day to Die with Bruce Willis and Frank Grillo. Could that signal a possession horror with an action twist? Time will tell.\n\nAGC International handling worldwide rights for the project. AGC more recently handled Neill Blomkamp’s Demonic in 2021 and Late Night With the Devil, a 70s-era supernatural horror film starring David Dastmalchian, that premiered earlier this year at SXSW.\n\nStay tuned for additional details on this new possession horror feature as they arrive.\n\nA sequel to Spookies is in the works, Bloody Disgusting has exclusively learned.\n\nFrank Farel, co-writer and producer of the 1987 cult classic, announced the news during a live interview with The Barrens Hideout Podcast at Dark Arts Festival in Lincoln, RI over the weekend.\n\n“Remarkably, [Spookies] has done well enough in its revival that I’m at the start of raising financing for a sequel,” Farel revealed. “I’m hoping to get a couple of name horror actors into it. I’m also looking to make a film that is almost an anti-sequel. I don’t just want to rehash what was done the first time.\n\n“I don’t want to even make a typical sequel. I want to make something that’s an animal of its own. It’s different in so many ways. The way I’m doing it, it’s almost intended as a mockery of what happened to our original film.”\n\nFinanciers infamously took the movie from Farel and directors Brendan Faulkner and Thomas Doran in post-production. Another filmmaker, Eugenie Joseph, was hired to helm new scenes that were edited into the previous footage, resulting in the bizarre monster mash that is Spookies.\n\n“To tell the truth, I hated it,” said Farel. “I hated what had been done to the film. It was not our film. It was sort of taken apart and reassembled. It was just not the film we had made. We did not like anything about what was done to it. However, Vinegar Syndrome brought it to Blu-ray, and suddenly the fans took to it.”\n\nIn Spookies, a group of stranded friends take shelter in an abandoned mansion, where they meet a myriad of demonic creatures under the control of an evil warlock.\n\nFarel described his sequel script as “a love letter to the fans who have made it possible to make another Spookies movie simply because they responded so positively to the first one that was not readily available to see for many, many years.”\n\nKeep an eye on The Barrens Hideout for the full conversation with Farel in the near future."
