        "text": "A 13 Ghosts television series just might be on its way. Patrick Mediate (Primordial Pictures) and Aaron McLane (SFX Supervisor, Fear the Walking Dead) have shared an exclusive update with Dread Central announcing their partnership with Dark Castle Entertainment to develop and pitch a 13 Ghosts television series to Sony Pictures Television. Last seen in Steve Beck’s and Dark Castle’s own 2001 remake, this would mark the first project for the property in two decades and the first time it was serialized for television. While nothing has been greenlit yet, we’re still psyched at the idea of this new series.\n\nCheck out some pitch deck images from the team below:\n\nIt is undoubtedly cool stuff. Key elements of the series appear in the concept art (it’s electric), and there’s even a nod to Kaneto Shindō’s Onibaba. It parallels nicely with the proposed structure for the series, pitched as a thirteen-episode run with an ensemble cast where each episode explores the origins of a different ghost. The creators note:\n\n“Every culture in the world has its ghost stories, and this re-imagining of 13 Ghosts presents an international sampling of these supernatural tales. The ghost stories within each episode will have their own stylistic look and feel that will be explored and influenced by each individual director. This makes our ghost vignettes stand out stylistically as they set the theme for each episode.”\n\nAdditionally, there is a proposed AR component for 13 Ghosts that would allow audiences to download an app and see additional ghosts both on-screen and in their own homes as the series airs.\n\nAshley Robinson, a co-producer of Fear the Walking Dead, is also attached.\n\nWhat do you think? Does a 13 Ghosts television series sound exciting to you? Let me know over on Twitter @Chadiscollins. Also, let me know your favorite of the ghosts. Mine is undoubtedly the Angry Princess."
