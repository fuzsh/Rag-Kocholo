        "text": "One of the highlights of being a horror movie fan in the 2000’s was the release of the new Dark Castle flick. While not Oscar content, this was an era when Hollywood produced fright flicks with big budgets. That means big names. Bigger sets. And amazing production design. We’re all hoping this kind of tentpole horror makes a return. But until then, join us as we rank every movie produced by Dark Castle.\n\nRELATED: Dark Castle Made Good Again?\n\nCheck out the list below!\n\n12.

Return to House on Haunted Hill\n\nFashion editor Ariel (Amanda Righetti) refuses to believe her sister’s scary stories about the abandoned insane asylum on Haunted Hill. But, when her sister is found dead of an apparent suicide, Ariel and her boyfriend, Paul (Tom Riley), find a journal in her apartment that has information about a cursed statue worth millions, hidden on the asylum’s grounds. The discovery leads deranged anthropology student Desmond (Erik Palladino) to kidnap the couple, forcing them to help find the statue.\n\nRELATED: THE CONJURING Writers Had ‘Crazy Story’ For HOUSE OF WAX Dark Castle Prequel\n\n10. Whiteout\n\nThe only U.S. Marshal assigned to Antarctica, Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) will soon leave the harsh environment behind for good; in three days, the sun will set and the Amundsen-Scott Research Station will shut down for the long winter. When a body is discovered out on the open ice, Carrie’s investigation into the continent’s first homicide plunges her deep into a mystery that may cost her her own life.\n\n09. The Hills Run Red\n\nA group of horror movie fanatics are looking for the filming location for a movie that has been rated as the bloodiest movie of all time. However, they discover something eerier than any horror film, namely that the plot of the film really happened.\n\nRELATED: This Day in Horror History: GHOST SHIP from Dark Castle Was Released in 2002\n\n08. The Reaping\n\nHilary Swank plays a former Christian missionary who lost her faith after the tragic deaths of her family. Now she applies her expertise to debunking religious phenomena. When a series of biblical plagues overrun a small town, she arrives to prove a supernatural force is not behind them. But soon finds science cannot explain what’s happening. Instead, she must regain her faith to combat the evil in the swamp.\n\n07. Gothika\n\nThe life of psychiatrist Halle Berry is derailed after she nearly hits a girl with her car one night. Later, she wakes up in her own mental hospital under the care of her peer, Robert Downey Jr. Completely disoriented, she’s accused of killing her own husband, but she has no memory of anything after she encountered the girl. Slowly she begins to uncover what happened but has to escape the asylum to solve the mystery.\n\nRELATED: Wicked Trailer for Dark Castle & Vincenzo Natali’s SPLICE\n\n06. Splice\n\nGeneticists Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley specialize in creating hybrids of species. When they propose the use of human DNA, their pharmaceutical company forbids it, forcing them to conduct experiments in secret. The result is Dren, a creature with amazing intelligence and physical attributes. At first, Dren exceeds their wildest dreams, but as she grows at an accelerated rate, she becomes their worst nightmare.\n\n05. Ghost Ship\n\nIn a remote region of the Bering Sea, a boat salvage crew discovers the eerie remains of a grand passenger liner thought lost for more than 40 years. But once onboard the eerie, cavernous ship, the crew of the Arctic Warrior discovers that the decaying vessel is anything but deserted. It’s home to something more deadly and horrific than anything they’ve encountered in all their years at sea. Best opening scene ever.\n\n04. House of Wax\n\nA gang of college friends, including Wade (Jared Padalecki) and his girlfriend, Carly (Elisha Cuthbert), are en route to a school football game when they wind up with a flat tire in a ghost town. They are forced to seek help in the only place that’s open: the local wax museum. Once inside the spooky and seemingly abandoned building, they find the works on display are not quite what they seem — and the group soon discovers it’s being hunted by the insane twin brothers who run the museum.\n\nRELATED: 20 Years Later: Underrated Dark Castle Horror Movie THIRTEEN GHOSTS Deserves a Second Look\n\n03.

House on Haunted Hill\n\nA millionaire with theatrical tendencies, Stephen Price (Geoffrey Rush) invites a number of people to stay in a vast creepy building that used to be an insane asylum. Stephen, accompanied by his bitter wife, Evelyn (Famke Janssen), offers a million dollars to anyone who can stay the whole night without leaving out of fear. When Stephen and Evelyn are trapped with their guests, they quickly realize the house really is haunted — and the spirits dwelling within are very angry.\n\nRELATED: ORPHAN Prequel in the Works at Dark Castle\n\n01. Orphan\n\nDevastated by the loss of their unborn baby, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) decide to adopt a child. At the orphanage, both feel drawn to a little girl (Isabelle Fuhrman) named Esther, and soon the couple take their new daughter home.
