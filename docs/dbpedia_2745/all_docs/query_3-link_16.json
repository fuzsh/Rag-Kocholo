        "text": "\"I was intrigued by the concept of this architecture,\" actress Embeth Davidtz said of her role in the film. \"I wanted to see how they do this in a modern context rather than the usual, old, haunted house.\" The centerpiece of Thirteen Ghosts is the house that formerly belonged to eccentric ghost-collector Cyrus Kriticos, where the eponymous ghosts are imprisoned.\n\n\"Reflections were a really big thing in the house,\" production designer Sean Hargreaves said. \"How can we design a house with glass and not have reflections? That was a really tough challenge.\"\n\nHargreaves had previously worked on the art department of films as diverse as Candyman, Se7en, The Fifth Element, and The Cell, and he has since gone on to work on blockbusters like Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Endgame, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. For Thirteen Ghosts, Hargreaves was faced with the task of designing one of the most elaborate sets ever conceived - the film's puzzle box house of glass, brass, and gears, where the walls were all windows engraved with Latin incantations and spells.\n\nThe house set featured glass walls and rooms that moved around. With so much glass in the picture, getting shots with no reflections of the crew was a tricky task. The solution? More light. The floors were made of glass tiles that could be lit from below which, along with lights from above, helped to cut down on glare. The image was then darkened in post-production.\n\nThough the original 13 Ghosts had plenty of weird specters - including a flaming skeleton, a homicidal chef, and a headless lion tamer - none of them were really explored too thoroughly. While the same is mostly true of the ghosts in the remake (at least on-screen), each one of the new film's ghosts was a member of what the movie calls the \"Black Zodiac,\" and their history was revealed in-depth in a special feature included with the home video release on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nThis feature, called \"Ghost Files,\" was narrated by F. Murray Abraham himself, and provided the in-universe history of each ghost, as well as how they fit into the so-called \"Black Zodiac.\"\n\nThe design of the house in Thirteen Ghosts was inspired by the architecture of the New York Science Museum. Constructed indoors on the Bridge Studios lot in Vancouver, the house involved more than three miles of etched glass, all of which had to be made by hand.\n\nRather than actually etching the 8,500 square feet of glass used in the construction of the set, production designer Sean Hargreaves rendered the \"etchings\" of Latin spells and incantations on a plastic overlay which was then stuck to the surfaces of the glass. Besides all that glass and plastic, the crew hired bridge welders to connect all the parts of the house together. It took almost five tons of steel to get the job done.\n\nThirteen Ghosts is, of course, a remake of William Castle's 1960 original, which was stylized as 13 Ghosts. By the time 13 Ghosts came around, Castle was already famous for his gimmicks, having employed them to great effect in films like Macabre, House on Haunted Hill (which Dark Castle had remade just two years before Thirteen Ghosts), and The Tingler. For his latest idea, he needed a gimmick to end all gimmicks, and he eventually hit upon the \"ghost viewer\": a pair of old-fashioned two-color 3D glasses that allowed the audience to decide whether or not to see the ghosts.\n\nIt was the first of Castle's gimmicks to be baked into the celluloid itself, as Dan Whitehead explains in the essay that accompanies the Indicator Series Blu-ray edition of 13 Ghosts. Though the original film was in black and white, the scenes with the ghosts had a blue filter, while the ghosts themselves - added in post-production - were red. If the audiences looked through one window in the \"ghost viewer,\" they could see the ghosts. If they looked through the other, the ghosts were invisible.\n\nThe \"ghost viewers\" weren't Castle's first idea for a gimmick for 13 Ghosts, however. As he recounts in his autobiography, Step Right Up! I'm Gonna Scare the Pants Off America, \"It was in France that I got an idea for a gimmick for my next picture.\" Castle describes buying a boarded-up house that \"looked haunted\". What was the gimmick? \"Have 20 million keys made - all but one with the same number. That one key fits the lock on this door. Keys will be passed out in theaters all over the world during the picture, and the lucky person with the right key owns this haunted house.\"\n\nWhen Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis teamed up with writer/producer Gilbert Adler to form Dark Castle Entertainment, it was a labor of love.\n\nOriginally, the production shingle, an offshoot of Silver's Silver Pictures, was formed exclusively to remake some of William Castle's classic ghost films from the 1950s. The first of these was the 1999 remake of House on Haunted Hill. After Thirteen Ghosts, however, the production company diversified, releasing its Ghost Ship remake in 2002 and the studio's first original horror film, Gothika, in 2003.\n\nWhile Dark Castle rolled out one more remake - 2005's House of Wax, a reboot of the hit 1953 Vincent Price vehicle - the production house soon began to bankroll original projects, diverting into action and thriller films within a few years.\n\nAccording to Silver, the decisions about which movies go under the Dark Castle banner and which don't are \"generally budget-based.\" As the producer told Collider, \"Pictures that we can make for a certain price go to Dark Castle, and the ones that cost more than that go somewhere else.\" The producer also points out that the dozen or so films initially released under the Dark Castle name have grossed more than $1 billion.\n\n\"That's the one thing Joel Silver said to me when we started,\" director Steve Beck told IGN. \"'We've got to keep the glasses.' We had meetings about them, you know, wouldn't it be cool maybe to have the audience have glasses in the theaters too.\"\n\nUnfortunately, while the \"ghost viewer\" goggles still found their way into the script of 2001's Thirteen Ghosts, the idea of the audience members getting their own \"ghost viewers\" didn't get very far. \"In the end,\" Beck said, \"we have them in the movie and we've tried to make them as cool as possible.\"\n\nIronically, Thirteen Ghosts hit multiplexes just a couple of years before 3D films began to fill cinemas, starting with James Cameron's IMAX film Ghosts of the Abyss. Dark Castle founder Robert Zemeckis got in on the game in short order, releasing his CG-animated film Polar Express in 3D in 2004."
