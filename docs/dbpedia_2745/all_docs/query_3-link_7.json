        "text": "When it was released back in 2001, Dark Castle Entertainment’s remake Thirteen Ghosts (stylized as Thir13en Ghosts) didn’t exactly set the box office on fire, scaring up just $68 million worldwide on a sizable production budget of $42 million. Reviews for the film were also largely negative at the time, making it both a financial as well as a critical misfire.\n\nBut the times, well, they have changed. Like many horror movies over the years, director Steve Beck’s Thirteen Ghosts has been re-evaluated in the two decades since its original theatrical release, becoming something of a fan favorite here in 2023. Fans have come to appreciate the gruesome effects, the big budget production design, and the titular monsters themselves, which came equipped with their own backstories thanks to a DVD special feature that we’ve written about in the past. And it’s safe to say Dark Castle has noticed this renewed interest.\n\nFrom what we’ve been told, Dark Castle views Thirteen Ghosts as the “Crown Jewel of their library,” as well as “a property that is long overdue for a resurrection.”\n\nIn fact, you may have seen a report on Dread Central earlier this month that teased an upcoming Thirteen Ghosts television series, which is “reportedly in development” at this time.\n\nThe proposed project comes courtesy of Patrick Mediate (Primordial Pictures), Aaron McLane (VFX Supervisor, Fear the Walking Dead), and Ashley Robinson (co-producer, Fear the Walking Dead), Dread Central notes in their exclusive report, with the trio working in direct conjunction with Dark Castle Entertainment on an extensive pitch that will essentially allow each of the film’s ghosts to get their own episode of a TV series.\n\nMediate and McLane told Dread Central for their exclusive report, “Every culture in the world has its ghost stories, and this re-imagining of 13 Ghosts presents an international sampling of these supernatural tales. The ghost stories within each episode will have their own stylistic look and feel that will be explored and influenced by each individual director. This makes our ghost vignettes stand out stylistically as they set the theme for each episode.”\n\nSo what’s the deal here and how likely is this project to actually get off the ground? Bloody Disgusting hopped on the phone last week to pick Patrick Mediate’s brain a little bit more.\n\nFor starters, Mediate made it a point to mention the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, which have ensured that no forward momentum on their proposed Thirteen Ghosts series is able to happen at this time. But once those strikes come to an end, Mediate, McLane, Robinson, and Dark Castle Entertainment will be hitting the ground running and pitching away.\n\nEven once the strikes clear, however, there’s a pretty major hurdle for the team to overcome. Sony currently owns a portion of the rights to Thirteen Ghosts, and without Sony’s approval, Dark Castle is unable to actually bring this planned television series to life. So while the team at Dark Castle is all-in and ready to go, the ball is going to end up in Sony’s court.\n\nFrom what we’ve been told, the project was actually pitched to Sony shortly before the WGA strike began, but again, there can be no forward momentum on those talks at this time.\n\nMediate explains to Bloody Disgusting, “Having Dark Castle’s support and blessing is only one part of the equation since Sony Pictures Television owns 50% of the rights. Right now the future of this being a series at all is completely in Sony’s court as we pitched to them right before the strike occurred.”\n\nIf Sony and Dark Castle can come to some kind of agreement – either Sony joins forces with Dark Castle on the series or they merely give Dark Castle the green light to do what they wish with the property – the plan on Dark Castle’s side is to essentially use the ending of the 2001 movie as the springboard for a deep dive into the mythology of each of the monsters. As you may recall, the ghosts are freed at the end of the movie, and they walk off into the woods. The series pitch from Mediate’s team would shine individual spotlights on each of those characters.\n\nAdditionally, Bloody Disgusting has been told that the fan-favorite character known as The Jackal would be a major player in the series, and the plan is to also delve into the creation of the machine that was built to contain the various ghosts, known as the Basileus Machine, as well as the ancient book that served as the film’s Necronomicon, the Arcanum.\n\nMediate elaborates, “It had always been clear to us that there was so much to be explored in the backgrounds of the ghosts so it’s only natural that we created each episode to explore and examine their origin stories, personalities, plights, and fates. These stories act as through-lines that intertwine with the mysterious legacy of Cyrus Kriticos and his present extended family, who have just become caretakers of the Kriticos Compound.”\n\n“One of the incredible things about unconventionally structuring the narrative in this way is that we can cleverly, and oftentimes surprisingly, have the ghosts’ pasts actually influence all of the parallel narratives that unfold throughout each episode which we feel will offer a fresh, extremely unique storytelling experience for the viewer,” he continues.\n\nMediate also teased an AR component to the series, which sounds like something original 13 Ghosts director William Castle would be playing with if he were alive today. The concept would be for AR technology to allow fans to invite the show’s ghosts into their own home, playing with the “Ghost Viewer” gimmick that was employed in both the 1960 and 2001 movies.\n\nThe team’s “comprehensive development deck” for the series also touches upon plans for subsequent seasons of the series, even if that’s a cart-before-the-horse situation at this time.\n\nMediate tells us, “We do envision an entire universe for the 13 Ghosts: The Series franchise that lives on eternally after the first season and goes on to explore different planes of mortal and Post-Mortal realities; it’s actually going to be something pretty profound that could be an enormous testament to the worlds we lay the groundwork for with the first season. Long and short, this is absolutely going to be a series with stories and three dimensional characters that fans are going to want to join up with for multiple seasons.”\n\nThe good news here is that Dark Castle Entertainment is looking to return to the horror genre in a big way, not only with the planned Thirteen Ghosts series but also with potential revivals of other properties in their catalogue. The company recently released 2021’s Seance and 2022’s Orphan: First Kill, and those look to be the beginning of a revival for the brand.\n\nDark Castle was formed in 1998, originally with the intention of remaking William Castle horror classics for modern audiences. Horror films made under the Dark Castle umbrella include House on Haunted Hill (1999), Thirteen Ghosts (2001), Ghost Ship (2002), Gothika (2003), House of Wax (2005), Orphan (2009), The Hills Run Red (2009), and Splice (2010).\n\nWould you like to see a Thirteen Ghosts television series from Dark Castle in the near future? Again, the ball is in Sony’s court. So if you want to see it, you know who to demand it from.\n\nThe team tells Bloody Disgusting, “We’re hopeful that when the strike ends we can bolster up enough support to get the series completely greenlit with a solid distributor so the fans need to make it known that they want this vision and want this as a series now more than ever.”\n\nMediate ends our conversation with a promise to the fans of Thirteen Ghosts.\n\n“As a united force with Dark Castle who firmly stand behind our vision, we want to be sure this series respects and pays homage to the deep roots of the original William Castle cult classic and its enormous existing fan base, while reinventing its ensemble of characters and narrative arcs to propel the property into the 21st century to give attract a whole new universe of fans.”\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and The Blob director Chuck Russell makes his long-awaited return to horror with Witchboard, a remake of writer/director Kevin S. Tenney’s original 1986 movie that premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival last week.\n\nMadison Iseman (I Know What You Did Last Summer), Aaron Dominguez (Only Murders in the Building), Antonia Desplat (Shantaram) and Charlie Tahan (Ozark) star in the horror movie. Director Chuck Russell co-wrote the script with Greg McKay.\n\nIseman stars as Emily, a former addict who works with her fiancé Christian (Dominguez) and a group of their friends to open an organic café, refurbishing an old carriage house in New Orleans’ French Quarter. When Emily finds an antique pendulum board, she unwittingly becomes a pawn in a bewitching battle over her soul. It’s a premise that only loosely resembles the original film; Witchboard forgoes the Ouija board in favor of something far more ancient in the occult realm.\n\nChuck Russell, speaking with Bloody Disgusting, explained what it was about Witchboard that brought him back to horror after a lengthy hiatus.\n\nThe filmmaker tells us, “Well, honestly, I wanted to get back to the horror genre. I’ve been keeping an eye out for that over the course of my career, and I wanted to do something even scarier and more imaginative. I wanted to top my other two horror films because the fans of those original films I did as a young director, Elm Street 3 and The Blob, are still thanking me for it, to my astonishment. It’s a great, entertaining, cathartic genre and one of the most lively genres to sit with an audience.”\n\n“You can really tell if your film is working or not if you’re sitting in a good horror film audience,” he continues. “So I thought Witchboard was a little bit like The Blob and that it’s very pop culture resonant, but there’s room to explore the idea. Honestly, I’ve been interested in pendulum boards. I’ve researched supernatural things over the course of my career, cautiously, honestly, because you bump into some pretty interesting people. But pendulum boards are so visual.”\n\n“And Hitchcock is one of my inspirations,” Russell continues. “Many directors were inspired by him, but his use of what he called MacGuffins, which were props in movies, is very inspiring to me. I knew what I could do with the camera on a pendulum board and what had never been investigated spiritually. Historically, it’s a real thing. The pope in the 1700s outlawed pendulum boards. That’s why Ouija boards even exist. You’d get burned at the stake if you used the divination tool of a pendulum over a board with mystical symbols on it, and so that gave birth eventually to the Ouija board. But the fact is that we use it for spell casting and divination and contacting spirits, so it left me with a wide palette to use in this film. I thought I could honor the original, but there were ways to explode it and do, hopefully, my most imaginative and scary horror film.”\n\nThe director used the 1986 original only as a loose inspiration. Russell explains, “I allowed myself to be inspired by it and honor what Kevin Tenney did, which he really created a subgenre of Ouija board horror in movies. It was the first one. There were three of them, I guess, but there were no witches, which was my first issue. It’s the greatest title ever. Where’s the witch? So, I got to explore Wicca in a way, again with some real legit research and then having imaginative fun with it. I’ve never seen a witch’s cat used in a legit horror film. The familiar was a real thing in the mythology of Wicca, so we got to use a wonderful cat that Madison and I both had an incredible time working with.”\n\nFor his witch, Russell enlisted Antonia Desplat as Naga Soth, one of the figures battling over Iseman’s Emily. Because Witchboard includes a more expansive lore with actual witchcraft, Emily’s journey looks drastically different from Tawny Kitaen’s Linda in the 1986 film. While that means a more robust arc for the character, Iseman mostly had eyes for her costar Tatiana, the impressive cat who plays the witch’s familiar in the film.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to work with a cat,” jests star Madison Iseman about what drew her to the role. “That’s partially a joke. But actually, there’s just so much fun to play with, I think, in the script. It’s just an action-packed, fun story, so there were just a lot of things to play with. Especially looking at different roles and characters; Emily goes through every single wave of emotion humanly possible, which, as an actor, is just fun to dive into. Chuck was obviously a huge draw for me, too. I’ve been a big fan of his for a very long time. So it was an easy yes, just from the beginning, and I’ve always wanted to work with a cat, and Tatiana was the best. I love her. I wish she was here today.”\n\nRussell expands on Iseman’s character, “Her character experiences nightmares, very dangerous hallucinations, a form of body swapping, and time travel. And what’s interesting is there’s never any confusion because of the way she played it, and so you can tell. I don’t want to give away too much with spoilers and things, but we pushed the envelope, and I got to do everything I ever wanted to do in horror in this film.”\n\n“Also, Chuck’s so great with his practical use of effects, and I think that was a huge draw as well, and I think it’s a part of our film that shines,” Iseman adds.\n\nBut was working with the cat everything that Iseman hoped it would be?\n\n“Honestly, it was the greatest moment of my life,“ Iseman gushes. “She was so talented. I’ve never been more impressed by an actress in my life. She could do everything. [Chuck Russell] let me play with Tatiana some. There’s some improv that gets added with the cat, which I think helps, too.“\n\nChuck Russell said in his director’s statement on the film that he considers it to be the third in his trilogy of horror fantasy experiments. While the filmmaker did pour everything he had into Witchboard, the door is always ajar when it comes to more horror.\n\n“I put everything I hadn’t tried into this film. I hope that fans of my work will recognize my touch,” he tells us. “But we have dreams; we have deadly hallucinations. We have body swaps; we have literal time travel. It’s fun in that regard, but number one is to scare the hell out of people, and I think we’ve done that, too.\n\n“Look, I’ve been fascinated with pendulum boards and alternate realities my whole career, and it was my first opportunity. Pendulum boards have never been used in the genre, and I can’t believe it because of the history of pendulum boards. But as a cinematic device, as a visual device, it’s excellent. I got to design the board with real mystical symbols and things that I know represent good and evil, and where that board takes us if the audiences respond to the film, and I hope they will; I know it’s out there for you guys, but the sequel is a world we’ll get to go a little further. That’s sure the intention.”"
