        "text": "American film production label\n\nDark Castle Entertainment is an American film production studio and a division of OEG Inc. It was formed in 1998 by Joel Silver, Robert Zemeckis, and Gilbert Adler.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nDark Castle Entertainment's name pays homage to William Castle, a horror filmmaker from the 1950s and 1960s. When first formed, the goal was to remake Castle's horror films. After two remakes, it moved on to producing original material, along with remakes of non-Castle films. Starting with RocknRolla, the company began producing films in genres other than horror. While most of the company's films were initially poorly reviewed by critics, their 2009 film Splice eventually received better reviews.\n\nDark Castle Entertainment originally acquired the US rights to The Loft, as they did for Splice, with the intention of releasing the film through Warner Bros. When Joel Silver moved his office to Universal Pictures (with whom Silver had a 5-year, 12-picture, North American marketing and distribution deal[1]), he took Dark Castle, and the film, with him. Universal planned to release the film on August 29, 2014, but the studio pulled it from the schedule in favor of Legendary Pictures' As Above, So Below. Universal and Dark Castle dropped the film, which was then picked up by Open Road Films and released on January 30, 2015.[2][3][4][5]\n\nJason Blum reportedly has spoken to Silver twice about a co-production between Blumhouse Productions (with whom Universal has a 10-year first-look deal[6]) and Dark Castle, for Universal to distribute, but they have yet to find the right project.[7]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease date Film Director(s) Distributor October 29, 1999 House on Haunted Hill William Malone Warner Bros.
