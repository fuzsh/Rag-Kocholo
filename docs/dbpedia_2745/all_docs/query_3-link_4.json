        "text": "LOS ANGELES–Joel Silver had already produced four episodes of the highly successful Lethal Weapon film series and had released the first of the three Matrix films when he decided to go another way. In 1999, Silver and Oscar-winning director Robert Zemeckis ( Forrest Gump ) released House on Haunted Hill , the debut picture from their new company, Dark Castle Entertainment. That movie and the next film from the company, Thir13en Ghosts , were remakes of movies by 1950s horror master William Castle, after whom the company was named. Dark Castle's movies, which include remakes of House of Wax and Ghost Ship , have brought modern special effects to old-style horror.\n\nThe latest Dark Castle film is The Reaping , which stars Hilary Swank as a former minister who has success debunking miracles until she goes to a small Louisiana town that appears to be beset by biblical plagues. The movie opens April 6 in Vancouver.\n\nIn a Los Angeles hotel's interview room, Silver says that Dark Castle is changing its approach to making movies and that it will have more control over its films now that it is responsible for funding them. \"This film [ The Reaping ] is the last one that was funded by Warner Bros.,\" he says. \"In the future, we will be financing our own films and we will be doing a lot of different things. Up until now it has just been horror films, but we have a thriller coming out called Whiteout , and we have some action films and even urban comedies, and the choice of what we do will depend on what comes in to us. Once I decided to raise money and take control of the company, I wanted to broaden it a bit. For instance, we are going to make a deal with [U.S. cable channel] Sci Fi to do a series of shows with them. We are also doing a pilot for CBS that is kind of a vampire pilot, so we will still be staying close to it [horror], but we will tweak them here and there.\"\n\nSilver says the decision to take control of the company was also influenced by the need to create effects for bigger films like The Reaping . He says the needs of studios are not necessarily the same as the needs of filmmakers. \"When we made our earlier movies, we were able to set a date and time and go, but some of the [recent] movies are full of visual effects, far more than the studio realizes.”¦We had a scene that we had shot that was supposed to have [CGI] locusts and there were no locusts. It was just the characters in front of a house. I mean, the studio is okay with the movie, but they wanted to push it forward and sometimes we just can't do that.\""
