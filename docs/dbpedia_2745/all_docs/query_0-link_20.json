        "text": "Dark Castle Entertainment is a division of Silver Pictures, a production house affiliated with Warner Bros. (1999–2013) and Universal Pictures (2014–present). It was formed in 1999 by Joel Silver, Robert Zemeckis, and Gilbert Adler. Susan Downey was the Vice President of Development until February 2009, a term running congruent to her tenure as a VP of Production at parent company Silver Pictures.\n\nDark Castle Entertainment's name pays homage to William Castle, a horror filmmaker from the 1950s and 1960s. When first formed, the goal was to remake Castle's horror films (very similar to another production company Platinum Dunes). After two remakes, it moved on to producing original material, along with remakes of non-Castle films. Starting with RocknRolla, the company began producing films in genres other than horror. Initially, most of the company's films were mostly critically panned, however recently their films have been received better by critics, including RocknRolla, Orphan, Splice and Unknown.\n\nFilms[]\n\nDracula (2015)\n\nThe Dark House (2015)\n\nFanon variations[]\n\nThe Dark House - Black and white"
