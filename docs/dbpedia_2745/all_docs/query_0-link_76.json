        "text": "DVD Sales - Open on Fire!\n\nFebruary 10th, 2009\n\nNew releases dominated the DVD sales chart this week, taking the top three spots, four of the top five, and seven of the top ten. This includes a surprise number one film, Open Season 2, which took first place with 554,000 units sold, and it was the only release to crack $10 million with opening week sales of $11.07 million. More...\n\nDVD Rentals - Lake Viewed on the Home Market\n\nFebruary 10th, 2009\n\nWhile Lakeview Terrace only managed third place on the sales chart this week, it led all new releases and took first place on the rental chart, generating about 33% more revenue than last week's winner, Max Payne More...\n\nDVD Releases for January 27, 2009 - Part II\n\nJanuary 27th, 2009\n\nOne of the longest lists in a while this week, but there's a lack of quality at the top. There are a number that are of interest, like Zodiac on Blu-ray, The Bourne Trilogy on Blu-ray, and others, none rise to the level of DVD Pick of the Week. The list was long enough that it has to be split up, and the second part can be found here. More...\n\nDVD Releases for January 27, 2009 - Part I\n\nJanuary 27th, 2009\n\nOne of the longest lists in a while this week, but there's a lack of quality at the top. There are a number that are of interest, like Zodiac on Blu-ray, The Bourne Trilogy on Blu-ray, and others, none rise to the level of DVD Pick of the Week. The list was long enough that it has to be split up, and the second part can be found here. More...\n\nSlumming it on the Per Theater Chart\n\nNovember 19th, 2008\n\nSlumdog Millionaire could be something we've been looking for all year, a limited release hit that will break out into mainstream theaters. It opened with just over $360,000 in 10 theaters over the weekend for an average of $36,002, and it already has $428,000 since Wednesday. Second place on the per theater chart went to the number one release of the week, Quantum of Solace, which earned an average of $19,568. The only holdover in the $10,000 club was The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, which showed remarkable strength in earning an average of $12,484 this week. That was down just 16% despite its theater count more than doubling. More...\n\nNo Escape from Per Theater Chart\n\nNovember 11th, 2008\n\nThis week the leader on the per theater chart was also the leader of the overall box office chart as Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa opened with a very impressive average of $15,559 in more than 4,000 theaters. Second place went to The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas, which opened with $250,000 in 17 theaters for an average of $14,887, suggesting at least some potential to expand. The Alphabet Killer was a surprise entry in the $10,000 club, as it earned $11,000 in its lone theater in Rochester, New York. Likewise, JCVD made an impressive debut with just over $20,000 in 2 theaters for an average of $10,060. More...\n\nPer Theater Chart takes one on The Chin\n\nNovember 5th, 2008\n\nWe have a surprise upset on the per theater chart as My Name is Bruce came out of nowhere to win the race to the top with $16,432 in one theater. I don't know how well it will expand, and its reviews suggest it won't, but no matter what happens theatrically, it should be a big hit on the home market. Noah's Arc: Jumping the Broom remained in second place with an average of $14,866 in five theaters. That was a greater than 50% drop-off, which is extremely high for a limited release and suggests limited potential to expand. Likewise, Synecdoche, New York fell harshly this past weekend but still added almost $100,000 in nine theaters for an average of $11,040. One last note, Let the Right One In expanded its theater count to seven and just missed the $10,000 mark with an average of $9,528. More...\n\nHigh School Repeats a Grade\n\nNovember 4th, 2008\n\nWith Halloween falling on a Friday, the box office practically lost one day out of three over the weekend, which explains why the overall box office was down 34% to $87 million. Coincidentally, the box office was down a nearly identical 35% from the same weekend last year. However, not only did Halloween cut into the box office, this time last year was the beginning of November, which is historically a much more lucrative month at the box office, and both of these are mitigating factors. Year-to-date, 2008 has brought in just under $7.79 billion, compared to 2007, which earned just over $7.79 billion during the same time period. More...\n\nCan Halloween Scare Up Some Business?\n\nOctober 30th, 2008\n\nIt's Halloween tomorrow, and let me tell you something, Halloween sucks when you are on a diet. However, this year I get to share my pain, as the only thing worse than Halloween without Tootsie Rolls, is Halloween at the box office. With so many kids out trick or treating, they won't be heading to the movie theaters. Neither will their parents, or people who want to stay at home and hand out candy, or those who just want to avoid dealing with all of the pedestrian traffic. It is such a headache that the last time Halloween fell on a Friday, which was 2003, no movies opened wide that day. (Although Brother Bear expanded wide the next day.) This time around we have two movies opening wide (Zack and Miri Make a Porno and The Haunting of Molly Hartley) and two films are expanding wide (RocknRolla and Changeling). Perhaps these risky moves will pay off. However, there is almost no chance it will keep up with last year's pace, since this time last year was the beginning of November instead of the end of October. More...\n\nPer Theater Chart is Rocking\n\nOctober 15th, 2008\n\nTwo limited releases performed amazingly on this week's per theater chart with RocknRolla earning first place with an average of $20,672 in seven theaters. Second place went to Happy-Go-Lucky with an average of $18,467 in four. Meanwhile, last week's winner, Rachel Getting Married, remained potent with an average of $16,505, despite tripling its theater count. More...\n\nMovie Website Reviews for Weekend of October 10, 2008\n\nOctober 12th, 2008\n\nThere are plenty of sites on this week's list, but the best of these sites are only above average and none of them rise to the level of an award worthy site. Hopefully next week will be better. More...\n\nLimited Releases are Rocking and Moviegoers are Happy\n\nOctober 11th, 2008\n\nThe official start of Awards season is nearing, and the number of potential mainstream hits coming out in limited release is growing. Of the dozen films on this week's list, there are a few of note, including Happy-Go-Lucky, RocknRolla, and Breakfast with Scot, but for wildly different reasons. More...\n\nCast Updates - October 2, 2008\n\nOctober 2nd, 2008\n\nThis week's round of new casting information contains updates for Paper Man, Sherlock Holmes, Kung Fu Panda 2, and more! More...\n\n2008 Preview: October\n\nOctober 1st, 2008\n\nSeptember ends, and for that we are all very grateful. However, while we are entering the final push for 2008 at the box office, things don't look too rosy for the upcoming month. First of all, there are way too many films opening, including eight that are opening or expanding on the first weekend. Of those two, maybe three will thrive. Most will sink without being noticed, which could negatively affect the overall box office going forward. On the other hand, there are a few films opening this month that could be players come Awards Season, which is just around the corner. Perhaps this will help a few mid-level hits rise above the crowd. More...\n\nInternational Details - Journey on the International Box Office\n\nSeptember 21st, 2008\n\nJourney To The Centre of the Earth opened in first place in Australia by a huge margin with $2.87 million on 362 screens, more than four times its nearest competitor. Overall the film made $6.41 million on 1417 screens in 27 markets for a total of $57.65 million, with a few smaller openings from now till its debut in Japan at the end of October. More...\n\nInternational Details - Wanted Still in Demand\n\nSeptember 14th, 2008\n\nWanted failed to reach first place during its opening in Germany, but still rose dramatically earning sixth internationally with $6.13 million on 1590 screens in 29 markets for a total of $147.68 million. In Germany is finished in second place behind The Dark Knight's third weekend of release earning $3.18 million on 444 screens, which is still impressive. Next up is Spain this weekend, while it opens wide in Japan next weekend and China early in October.
