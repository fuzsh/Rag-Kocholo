Now, it may seem strange – a dad taking his six year old to see a Bond film – but, strangely, something happened there in that…\n\nWanna know how to break into the move and TV biz? Know where all the bodies are buried. In order to do that, you have to be in on the burying process. If you’re not leading the body-burying op, you must be assisting.

A team of strangers comes together to make something they all believe in. And then there’s “Bordello Of Blood”. Where a team of strangers got together – and simply got “stranger” with each other.
