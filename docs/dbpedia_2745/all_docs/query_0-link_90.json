Institution research<br />-685800223520<br />One of the main production institutions for horror movies is Dark Castle entertainment that were responsible for films such as House on haunted hill, Thirteen ghosts and Orphan. Dark Castle Entertainment is a division of Silver Pictures, a production house joined with Warner Bros. It was formed in 1999 by Joel Silver, Robert Zemickis and Gilbert Adler.<br />Their intentional goal was to keep the spirit of William Castle alive by updating and modernizing his films into newer, scarier stories. Their first film debuted in 1999 and was a remake of the late Castle's 1959 version House on Haunted Hill. With the achievement of their first movie, Dark Castle then went on to remake Castle's 1960's movie of 13 Ghosts, with a more up to date story of their own. The company then decided to create their own original story line, which is when they produced Ghost Ship. Their next film, Gothika, was another new story, but in 2005, Dark Castle went back to its roots and remade Castle's House of Wax, a film that the Vincent Price stared in. Dark Castle has made many remakes and originals but starting early 2008, they've branched out with not only doing adaptations in the comic world (their first adaptation being the comic Whiteout,) but they've gone off into the action category with the new Guy Ritchie film RockNRolla.<br />Dark Castle aims on releasing fifteen films within the next six years in both theatre realizes and direct-to-DVD.<br />"
