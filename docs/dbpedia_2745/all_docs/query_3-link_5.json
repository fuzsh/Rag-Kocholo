        "text": "Dear Darker side of film,\n\nI hope you don’t mind contacting you – I wondered if you’d be interested in my indie-British horror comedy “Mark Macready and the Archangel Murders”. The film has received several screenings over here in the UK, all have gone down brilliantly, we also recently received a five star review from Gorezone magazine. The film has now been selected to screen at several film festivals across the UK and we’re waiting to hear from over a dozen US festivals.\n\nI wondered if you’d be interested in taking a look at the film and perhaps running a piece on it? It’s a film that’s really changing things up on the short film scene here in the UK and we’re hoping it’ll encourage more independent filmmakers to make more high concept shorts and move away from the traditional gritty British shorts.\n\nThanks so much for your time, I really look forward to hearing from you,\n\nCheers\n\nRyan\n\nHello Drew,\n\nMy name is Chris Conlee. I’m a professional motion picture and television editor, living and working in Hollywood. A couple years ago I got an opportunity to direct my first feature film; it’s a 1/2 million dollar alien possession flick called, Evilution, and it’s set to be released by BrinkDVD on Nov. 17th, 2009.\n\nYou can view the most recent trailer at:\n\nAnyway, as I’m very interested in promoting the release of my film, I was wondering if you’d be interested in seeing a screener and/or doing an interview with myself or anybody else on the crew that might be of interest to you? We’d dearly love the help.\n\nHere’s the movie’s IMDb page:\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032749/\n\nAnd the official homepage:\n\nhttp://www.evilutionthemovie.com\n\nIf you’re going to be anywhere near Los Angeles, the film is also screening at this year’s ShriekFest on Sunday, Oct. 4th at 4pm.\n\nThanks for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChris Conlee\n\nDirector / Editor\n\nhttp://www.ChrisConlee.com\n\n818-694-2112\n\nSara Finder permalink\n\nDear Editors,\n\nWe are AFTER DARK FILMS, the film studio and production company best known for Horrorfest “8 Films To Die For,” an annual, nationwide theatrical event.
