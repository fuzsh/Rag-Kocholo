        "text": "Paramount Players has picked up the domestic rights to horror thriller Orphan: First Kill from eOne and Dark Castle.\n\nThe movie, now in post-production, is a prequel to Dark Castle’s 2009 movie, Orphan, which was distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nEOne and Dark Castle co-financed the prequel that was directed by William Brent Bell, who previously helmed The Boy and The Devil Inside.\n\nFirst Kill centers on Leena, a murderous sociopath who looks like a child due to a medical condition. Following an escape from an Estonian psychiatric facility, Leena comes to America by impersonating the missing daughter of a wealthy Connecticut family. But Leena’s new life as “Esther” comes with an unexpected wrinkle and pits her against a mother who will protect her family at any cost.\n\nIsabelle Fuhrman reprises her role from the original movie and now also serves as an associate producer on the new movie. Julia Stiles stars as the mother with Rossif Sutherland, Matthew Finlan and Hiro Kanagawa rounding out the cast.\n\nDave Coggeshall wrote the script. Alex Mace, Hal Sadoff and Ethan Erwin produced along with James Tomlinson.\n\nDavid Leslie Johnson, who wrote the original for Dark Castle, executive produced along with Daryl Katz, Chloe Katz, Paul Marcaccio, Victor Moyers and Kyle Irving. Co-producers are Kelly Gallagher and Robert Bell.\n\nNo release date has been set."
