K. (GAMER)\n\nReviewed on 5/10/2019...\n\nGothika - Halle Berry shines in this! A must for the suspense horror fans!\n\nHouse of Wax - Fun but nothing beats the original Vincent Price original!\n\nGhost Ship - This by far has one of the eeriest opening scenes! Lots of actors and actresses that you know in this!\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n\"Great Deal!\"\n\nLorraine M. Skelton | USA | 07/16/2007\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Dont listen to the other reviewer, this is a great new wave horror Box Set! Shop around, I found my Box Set cheaper! Still a great buy! A great set to add to your DVD Collection!\"\n\nGreat Value for good old campy horror flicks\n\nRocco B | Utah USA | 02/01/2009\n\n(3 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Very good value for the movies. I really like House on Haunted Hill and Thirteen Ghosts. The other movies for me were good, but not my favorites. Fun group of movies for when in the mood for some horror. Plus Paris Hilton gets killed in House of Wax. That was a plus right there.\"\n\nGreat \"B\" Movie Horror with Grade \"A\" budgets\n\nK. McClintock Jr. | Springfield, Or | 01/14/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"These films entertain me each time I view them. What more can you ask for? The production values are 2nd to none and the stories rock. I and my family love them for what they are. Classic horror tales told with modern techniques. I for one hope that Silver and Zemeckis continue to put out these high quality \"B\" grade horror films.\""
