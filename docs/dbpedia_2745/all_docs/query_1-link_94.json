        "text": "Ghost Ship is the latest film from Dark Castle Entertainment – a production company headed by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis – the creators of the horror flicks Thirteen Ghosts and House on Haunted Hill. And while the group's previous pictures have been remakes of old William Castle films, Ghost Ship is their first original production.\n\nOur friend Garth over at Dark Horizons was fortunate enough to hook up with the production in Gold Coast, Queensland, and filed a lengthy set report today. The story begins in 1962, aboard the Italian luxury liner Antonia Graza. But the ship vanishes at sea and is never seen again... until... Present day, the crew of an Alaskan salvage tug are dispatched to an abandoned ship in a remote region of the Bering Sea. The crew leaves their tug and attempts to sail the ship back to port, but the inhabitants are not at rest and the crew must unlock the secret of what happened the night the Antonia Graza disappeared.\n\nThe film stars Julianna Marguiles and Gabriel Byrne in the two lead roles. Miss Marguiles describes her character saying, \"She's a very self-sufficient, technically capable hero of the movie in that she saves the sinking evil ship and tries to save souls and in doing so further take care of the future by not allowing this to happen again. She's tough, her and Murphy (Gabriel Byrne's character) are partners in owning the rig that they operate. I think she's very proud of what she does, she's very...not that so much she's a loner, but more that she has accepted this world out at sea so she's alone a lot, and this crew is her family, the only family she has – so in that sense she's a loner, so her world is her work which in a way it a little sad but I think she really takes pride in it – that's all she has.\""
