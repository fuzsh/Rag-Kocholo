The Parti Rakyat Sarawak or PRS (English: Sarawak Peoples' Party) is a multiracialist & nationalist political party in Sarawak and Malaysia overall. The party was founded in the wake of the de-registration of the Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak and later Sarawak National Party in December 2003 by a breakaway faction led by the late Tan Sri Dr. James Jemut Masing and Dato' Sng Chee Hua. It is one of the former constituent members of the Barisan Nasional. PRS is currently the second largest local political party in Sarawak, after PBB. Following the fall of BN in the 2018 general election and in the aftermath of meeting between all Sarawak-based BN coalition parties on 12 June 2018, PRS left the coalition to form a new Sarawak-based coalition of Sarawak Parties Alliance.[2] As of August 2023, the party's membership population is 348,700 members. Currently, there are 135 Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) branches which are actively found throughout Sarawak.
