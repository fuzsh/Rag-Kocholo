Before the coalition was formed in June 2018, the parties won 19 out of 31 seats when they contested in GE14 under the BN banner.\n\nPakatan Harapan (PH) said on Sunday that the coalition is aiming to win more than 90 seats in Peninsular Malaysia before working with a coalition in East Malaysia to form the government.\n\nThis will be possible if the voter turnout this year is more than 70 per cent, Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) deputy president Rafizi Ramli said."
