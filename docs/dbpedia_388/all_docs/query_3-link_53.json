        "text": "KUCHING: Datuk Snowdan Lawan has reiterated his call for an open contest for the president post in Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) to ensure a strong and democratic leadership.\n\nThe PRS Youth chief said most importantly the party remains united and any differences are settled through negotiation and consensus.\n\n“It is crucial for senior members to make way for younger leaders, though specific positions have not been decided.\n\n“The party aims to accommodate all members, possibly through appointed posts such as secretary general and treasurer, as outlined in the party constitution,” he told reporters when met after officiating at the prize-giving ceremony for DayakDaily’s “Gastronomy and I: My Favourite Dish” writing competition held at Imperial Hotel here today (July 6).\n\nHe said a date for the party’s Triennial Delegates Conference (TDC) which is due in 2025, is yet to be scheduled.\n\n“The last TDC was held in 2022 without any party elections. The Supreme Council has the authority to extend the date if necessary, depending on the party’s readiness and ground conditions,” he added.\n\nWhen asked if he’s aiming for a specific post if the TDC were to happen next year, Snowdan said he needed to talk about the matter with the Supreme Council members.\n\n“Of course, in politics, you tend to go higher. One cannot remain stagnant. You have to give way to the younger ones.\n\n“So, of course, your aim is to go higher and give way to the younger ones to take your place. That is common. But how high it depends, I do not know.\n\n“We leave the decision to the grassroots and party members. They often provide feedback—some positive, some negative. This is quite common. Ultimately, the majority will decide,” he said."
