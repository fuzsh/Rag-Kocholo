He became an independent and won in the 14th general election (GE14). He joined PKR in 2018.Sng began his political career with the now-defunct Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak (PBDS) in 2001 before leaving to join Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS), from which he was sacked for trying to topple the party president.\n\nSng took over as Sarawak PKR chairman after Selangau MP Baru Bian quit the party last year.\n\n“It is not really a surprise that Sng decided to quit PKR as he has been ‘jumping around’ and does not seem to have a firm political stance. His resignation is actually a blessing in disguise for PKR,” Awang Azman said.\n\nHe said Sarawak PKR should now focus on attracting voters from among young working professionals instead of worrying about who should lead the state chapter.\n\n“It is time for the party to move on and focus on the young voters.”\n\nHe said the party remains relevant in Sarawak although left with only one MP – Miri representative Dr Michael Teo – to ensure checks and balances of those in the ruling coalition.\n\nSarawak PKR had six MPs after Sng and Lubok Antu MP Jugah Muyang, who also won as an independent candidate in GE14, joined the party in 2018. However, Baru, Puncak Borneo MP Willie Mongin and Saratok MP Ali Biju quit after the Sheraton Move last year, followed by Jugah in June.\n\nThe party also holds three state seats.\n\nMeanwhile, political analyst James Chin of the University of Tasmania’s Asia Institute said it was not a big surprise that Sng quit PKR as the rumours had been going around for quite some time.\n\n“He can only declare support for Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin instead of joining PPBM as he is not a Bumiputera. What is interesting now is which party will he join?\n\n“He will be partyless for a while. I am sure he has his plan ready and (is) just waiting for the right time,” he said.\n\nChin said Sng’s resignation also showed that the opposition in Sarawak was divided, which would be an advantage to the ruling Gabungan Parti Sarawak in the next state election.\n\nExpert Cited"
